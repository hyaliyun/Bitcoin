Origins They originally formed as a duo by Steve Poltz, Robert Driscoll. This evolved into a quartet (1993-1996) featuring Steve Poltz, \\"Dr.\\" Robert Driscoll, drummer Stinky and bassist Gregory Page. Which evolved into a trio (1997‚ÄìPresent) featuring Steve Poltz, drummer Stinky and bassist John Castro. History The Rugburns group (not to be confused with the Los Angeles area Rugburns 1986‚Äì1989) formed and began playing in the local San Diego, CA area as a duo. In the beginning, Steve Poltz and Robert Driscoll were acoustic duo playing in various coffeehouses and bars including the Blarney Stone Pub, the Mission Beach Club, Innerchange Coffee House, Megalopolis, and Java Joe's. They would sometimes be joined by Gerald \\"Child\\" McMullin making them a temporary acoustic power trio. The group released several self-produced cassette tapes in this band formation and were becoming a huge local draw and favorite in San Diego. Debut album, Morning Wood - 1994 After the group signed a contract with Bizarre/Planet Records in 1993 (a label associated with Herb Cohen, who had earlier managed Linda Ronstadt, Tom Waits and Frank Zappa). The duo wanted to add a rhythm section for a full, 'radio friendly' sound. It was then, the duo permanently changed to a foursome with bassist singer/songwriter Gregory Page and drummer Stinky. The quartet released their debut album Morning Wood which was produced by Buddy Blue (of The Beat Farmers), in early 1994. With funny, witty and sometimes bizarre lyrics, the band began to experience their first taste of national exposure; playing a sold out show at world- famous Cleveland Agora Theater and Ballroom. The songs \\"Hitchhiker Joe\\" and \\"Me and Eddie Vedder\\" would go on to be the most recognizable tracks on the album. The song \\"Hitchhiker Joe\\" (written by Steve Poltz and Steve Foth of the San Diego Band C.L.A.) received a large amount of national airplay and held the No. 1 slot on the nightly \\"Top 10\\" for several weeks on San Diego station 91X in early 1994. The video for \\"Hitchhiker Joe\\" was filmed at a local San Diego high school, and was directed by Michael Addis, who went on to direct several feature films. Poltz's girlfriend at the time was singer-songwriter Jewel, and she also appeared in the video. \\"Me and Eddie Vedder\\" is a strident introspection on the preposterous possibilities of overdosing in a hotel room alongside Eddie Vedder. The experience concludes with Vedder and Poltz overdosing while an 8-track player is blaring the Houses of the Holy album. EP \\"Mommy I'm Sorry\\" - 1995 In early 1995, the band released an EP called \\"Mommy I'm Sorry,\\" which included the song \\"Dick's Automotive,\\" which is a favorite at The Rugburns shows. After \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic saw one of the band's sold out performances at the Hollywood Troubadour, he met the band and soon after wrote a similar song, \\"Albuquerque\\". The album also contains a cover of the theme song of the children's television series Sesame Street. Second album; Taking the World By Donkey - 1995 In 1995, the band signed a deal with Priority Records. The Rugburns released their second full-length album in late 1995, Taking the World By Donkey, which again featured a generous helping of acoustic guitars spiked with edgy lyrics. The humor and cutting wit was still in the songwriting but there was an addition of a few darker themes. \\"The Ballad of Tommy and Marla\\" tells the sad tale of a couple that becomes hooked on crystal meth and eventually have their entire lives destroyed by their drug abuse, but in an endearing and fun manner. After the band's back to back touring of the entire United States, Gregory Page left the band to pursue a solo career and was replaced with John Castro. Soon after Page had departed, Driscoll left the band because of tour related health issues but recovered well and returned to teaching high school, his first profession. The band was to be known from then on as a trio: Steve Poltz, John Castro and Stinky. The Rugburns were now achieving their biggest national fame. The national fame was in part because of radio play and the constant touring year to year. A serious boost came when the Jewel Kilcher fans, known as Everyday Angels began to follow the group and post about them on the Everyday Angels internet chat group. For several years, Steve Poltz and Jewel had been together romantically. Poltz \\"co-wrote\\" her biggest hit, \\"You Were Meant for Me\\" and also appeared the video for the song. On Jewel's \\"Tiny Lights\\" tour, the Rugburns were the opening act and her backing band. Steve Poltz solo It was at this time that Poltz was trying to create a solo career alongside the Rugburns. Poltz then released two solo albums on the Mercury label: One Left Shoe (1997) and Conversations Over a Cerveza (1998). Then after being dropped from Mercury, Poltz self-released several other albums: Answering Machine (1999), Live at Largo (2000), Live at the Basement DVD (2003), Chinese Vacation (2003), The Barn (2007), Tales from the Tavern CD/DVD (2007), Unraveling (2008), Traveling (2008) and Dreamhouse (2010).

The antenna is connected to the screw terminals to the left of center. Electronic filters are a type of signal processing filter in the form of electrical circuits. This article covers those filters consisting of lumped electronic components, as opposed to distributed-element filters. That is, using components and interconnections that, in analysis, can be considered to exist at a single point. These components can be in discrete packages or part of an integrated circuit. Electronic filters remove unwanted frequency components from the applied signal, enhance wanted ones, or both. They can be: *passive or active *analog or digital *high-pass, low-pass, band- pass, band-stop (band-rejection; notch), or all-pass. *discrete-time (sampled) or continuous-time *linear or non-linear *infinite impulse response (IIR type) or finite impulse response (FIR type) The most common types of electronic filters are linear filters, regardless of other aspects of their design. See the article on linear filters for details on their design and analysis.  History  The oldest forms of electronic filters are passive analog linear filters, constructed using only resistors and capacitors or resistors and inductors. These are known as RC and RL single-pole filters respectively. However, these simple filters have very limited uses. Multipole LC filters provide greater control of response form, bandwidth and transition bands. The first of these filters was the constant k filter, invented by George Campbell in 1910. Campbell's filter was a ladder network based on transmission line theory. Together with improved filters by Otto Zobel and others, these filters are known as image parameter filters. A major step forward was taken by Wilhelm Cauer who founded the field of network synthesis around the time of World War II. Cauer's theory allowed filters to be constructed that precisely followed some prescribed frequency function.  Classification by technology =Passive filters Passive implementations of linear filters are based on combinations of resistors (R), inductors (L) and capacitors (C). These types are collectively known as passive filters, because they do not depend upon an external power supply and they do not contain active components such as transistors. Inductors block high-frequency signals and conduct low- frequency signals, while capacitors do the reverse. A filter in which the signal passes through an inductor, or in which a capacitor provides a path to ground, presents less attenuation to low-frequency signals than high-frequency signals and is therefore a low-pass filter. If the signal passes through a capacitor, or has a path to ground through an inductor, then the filter presents less attenuation to high-frequency signals than low-frequency signals and therefore is a high-pass filter. Resistors on their own have no frequency- selective properties, but are added to inductors and capacitors to determine the time-constants of the circuit, and therefore the frequencies to which it responds. The inductors and capacitors are the reactive elements of the filter. The number of elements determines the order of the filter. In this context, an LC tuned circuit being used in a band-pass or band-stop filter is considered a single element even though it consists of two components. At high frequencies (above about 100 megahertz), sometimes the inductors consist of single loops or strips of sheet metal, and the capacitors consist of adjacent strips of metal. These inductive or capacitive pieces of metal are called stubs. =Single element types= A low-pass electronic filter realised by an RC circuit The simplest passive filters, RC and RL filters, include only one reactive element, except hybrid LC filter which is characterized by inductance and capacitance integrated in one element.Dzhankhotov V., Hybrid LC filter for power electronic drives: Theory and Implementation, 2009 = L filter = An L filter consists of two reactive elements, one in series and one in parallel. = T and œÄ filters = Low-pass œÄ filter High-pass T filter Three-element filters can have a 'T' or 'œÄ' topology and in either geometries, a low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, or band-stop characteristic is possible. The components can be chosen symmetric or not, depending on the required frequency characteristics. The high-pass T filter in the illustration, has a very low impedance at high frequencies, and a very high impedance at low frequencies. That means that it can be inserted in a transmission line, resulting in the high frequencies being passed and low frequencies being reflected. Likewise, for the illustrated low-pass œÄ filter, the circuit can be connected to a transmission line, transmitting low frequencies and reflecting high frequencies. Using m-derived filter sections with correct termination impedances, the input impedance can be reasonably constant in the pass band.The American Radio Relay League, Inc.: \\"The ARRL Handbook, 1968\\" page 50 =Multiple-element types= Multiple-element filters are usually constructed as a ladder network. These can be seen as a continuation of the L,T and œÄ designs of filters. More elements are needed when it is desired to improve some parameter of the filter such as stop-band rejection or slope of transition from pass-band to stop-band. Active filters Active filters are implemented using a combination of passive and active (amplifying) components, and require an outside power source. Operational amplifiers are frequently used in active filter designs. These can have high Q factor, and can achieve resonance without the use of inductors. However, their upper frequency limit is limited by the bandwidth of the amplifiers. Other filter technologies There are many filter technologies other than lumped component electronics. These include digital filters, crystal filters, mechanical filters, surface acoustic wave (SAW) filters, bulk acoustic wave (BAW) filters, garnet filters, and atomic filters (used in atomic clocks).  The transfer function  :see also Filter (signal processing) for further analysis The transfer function H(s) of a filter is the ratio of the output signal Y(s) to that of the input signal X(s) as a function of the complex frequency s: :H(s)=\\\\frac{Y(s)}{X(s)}. The transfer function of all linear time-invariant filters, when constructed of lumped components (as opposed to distributed components such as transmission lines), will be the ratio of two polynomials in s, i.e. a rational function of \\\\ s. The order of the transfer function will be the highest power of \\\\ s encountered in either the numerator or the denominator.  Classification by topology  Electronic filters can be classified by the technology used to implement them. Filters using passive filter and active filter technology can be further classified by the particular electronic filter topology used to implement them. Any given filter transfer function may be implemented in any electronic filter topology. Some common circuit topologies are: * Cauer topology ‚Äì passive * Sallen‚ÄìKey topology ‚Äì active * Multiple feedback topology ‚Äì active * State variable topology ‚Äì active * Biquadratic topology ‚Äì active Classification by design methodology Historically, linear analog filter design has evolved through three major approaches. The oldest designs are simple circuits where the main design criterion was the Q factor of the circuit. This reflected the radio receiver application of filtering as Q was a measure of the frequency selectivity of a tuning circuit. From the 1920s filters began to be designed from the image point of view, mostly being driven by the requirements of telecommunications. After World War II the dominant methodology was network synthesis. The higher mathematics used originally required extensive tables of polynomial coefficient values to be published but modern computer resources have made that unnecessary.Bray, J, Innovation and the Communications Revolution, Institute of Electrical Engineers Direct circuit analysis Low order filters can be designed by directly applying basic circuit laws such as Kirchhoff's laws to obtain the transfer function. This kind of analysis is usually only carried out for simple filters of 1st or 2nd order. RL filter frequency response Image impedance analysis : This approach analyses the filter sections from the point of view of the filter being in an infinite chain of identical sections. It has the advantages of simplicity of approach and the ability to easily extend to higher orders. It has the disadvantage that accuracy of predicted responses relies on filter terminations in the image impedance, which is usually not the case.Matthaei, Young, Jones Microwave Filters, Impedance-Matching Networks, and Coupling Structures McGraw-Hill 1964 Constant k filter response with 5 elements Zobel network (constant R) filter, 5 sections m-derived filter response, m=0.5, 2 elements m-derived filter response, m=0.5, 5 elements Network synthesis : The network synthesis approach starts with a required transfer function and then expresses that as a polynomial equation of the input impedance of the filter. The actual element values of the filter are obtained by continued-fraction or partial-fraction expansions of this polynomial. Unlike the image method, there is no need for impedance matching networks at the terminations as the effects of the terminating resistors are included in the analysis from the start. Here is an image comparing Butterworth, Chebyshev, and elliptic filters. The filters in this illustration are all fifth-order low-pass filters. The particular implementation ‚Äì analog or digital, passive or active ‚Äì makes no difference; their output would be the same. center As is clear from the image, elliptic filters are sharper than all the others, but they show ripples on the whole bandwidth.

The theaters mostly had white owners (the recently restored Morton Theater in Athens, Georgia, originally operated by \\"Pinky\\" Monroe Morton, being a notable exception and Douglass Theatre in Macon, Georgia owned and operated by Charles Henry Douglass) and booked jazz and blues musicians and singers, comedians, and other performers, including the classically trained, such as operatic soprano Sissieretta Jones, known as \\"The Black Patti\\", for black audiences. History The association was established following the work of vaudeville performer Sherman H. Dudley. By 1909, Dudley was widely known as the \\"Lone Star Comedian\\" and had begun an attempt to have a black-owned and operated string of venues around the United States. By 1911 Dudley was based in Washington, D.C. as general manager and treasurer of the Colored Actors' Union, and set up S. H. Dudley Theatrical Enterprises, which began buying and leasing theaters around Washington and Virginia. By 1916 the \\"Dudley Circuit\\" had extended into the south and Midwest, enabling black entertainers to secure longer-term contracts for an extended season; this circuit provided the basis for T.O.B.A. His circuit was advertised in a weekly column published in black newspapers, \\"What's What on the Dudley's Circuit\\", and by 1914 it included over twenty theaters, \\"all owned or operated by blacks and as far south as Atlanta.\\" T.O.B.A. was formally established in 1920 by people associated with Dudley's circuit. Its President was Milton Starr, owner of the Bijou Theater in Nashville; Theater Owners Booking Association (T.O.B.A.), Musicians Local No.627. retrieved 15 November 2015 its chief booker was Sam Reevin of Chattanooga. The organization had more than 100 theaters at its peak in the early to mid 1920s. Often referred to by the black performers as Tough on Black Artists (or, by Gertrude \\"Ma\\" Rainey, as Tough on Black Asses), the association was generally known as Toby Time (Time was a common term for vaudeville circuits). It booked only black artists into a series of theatres on the East Coast and as far west as Oklahoma. T.O.B.A. venues were the only ones south of the Mason-Dixon line that regularly sought black audiences, according to one reference. T.O.B.A. paid less and generally had worse touring arrangements, which the performers had to pay for themselves, than the white vaudeville counterpart. But like white vaudeville, T.O.B.A. faded from popularity during the Great Depression, collapsing in late 1930 when Dudley sold his chain of theaters to a cinema company.Lauterbach, p.38 Operations and performers According to writer Preston Lauterbach, \\"a basic TOBA troupe carried about all the variety a single stage could hold, not to mention all the personalities one sleeping car could hold\\", including tap dancers, comedy teams, actors, and blues singers. Their backdrops, costumes and props moved with them. Its earliest star performers included singers Ethel Waters, Gertrude Ma Rainey, Bessie Smith, Edmonia Henderson, Mamie Smith, Minto Cato and Adelaide Hall; comedian Tim Moore with his Chicago Follies company (which included his wife Gertie); the Whitman Sisters and their Company; musicians Fletcher Henderson, Fats Waller, Louis Armstrong, Noble Sissle, Eubie Blake, Joe \\"King\\" Oliver, and Duke Ellington; comedians Sandy Burns, Salem Whitney Tutt, Boots Hope, Seymour James, and Tom Fletcher; future Paris sensation Josephine Baker; songwriter and pianist Perry Bradford, the mime Johnny Hudgins; dancers U. S. Thompson, Walter Batie, Earl \\"Snakehips\\" Tucker, and Valaida Snow; and many others. In addition, later well-known names such as Florence Mills, Lincoln \\"Stepin Fetchit\\" Perry, Hattie McDaniel, Mantan Moreland, Jackie \\"Moms\\" Mabley, Dewey Pigmeat Markham, Johnny Lee, Marshall \\"Garbage\\" Rogers, Amanda Randolph, Chick Webb, Cab Calloway, a young William Basie (before he came to be called \\"Count\\") on tour with Gonzelle White, and four-year-old Sammy Davis, Jr. all performed on the T.O.B.A. circuit. The death of White's husband was blamed on poor conditions at the theaters. The most prestigious black theaters in Harlem, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C., were not part of the circuit, booking acts independently; the T.O.B.A. was considered less prestigious. Many black performers, such as Bert Williams, George Walker, Johnson and Dean, Bill \\"Bojangles\\" Robinson, Tim Moore, and Johnny Hudgins, also performed in white vaudeville, often in blackface.

An energy-plus house (also called: plus-energy house, efficiency-plus house) produces more energy from renewable energy sources, over the course of a year, than it imports from external sources. This is achieved using a combination of microgeneration technology and low-energy building techniques, such as: passive solar building design, insulation and careful site selection and placement. A reduction of modern conveniences can also contribute to energy savings, however many energy-plus houses are almost indistinguishable from a traditional home, preferring instead to use highly energy-efficient appliances, fixtures, etc., throughout the house. PlusEnergy is a term used in building design to describe a structure that produces more energy than it uses. The term was coined in 1994 by Rolf Disch when building his private residence, the Heliotrope as the first PlusEnergy house in the world. Disch then went on to refine the concepts involved with several more projects built by his company Rolf Disch Solar Architecture in order to promote PlusEnergy for wider adoption in residential, commercial and retail spaces. Disch maintains that PlusEnergy is more than just a method of producing environmentally-friendly housing, but also an integrated ecological and architectural concept. As such, PlusEnergy is intended to be superior to low- energy or zero-energy designs such as those of Passivhaus. Technical approach The PlusEnergy approach uses a variety of techniques to produce a building that generates more energy than it consumes. A typical example is to capture heat during the day in order to reduce the need to generate heat over night. This is achieved using large North and South facing window areas to allow sunlight to penetrate the structure, reducing the need for energy use from light bulbs. Triple-paned windows (U-value = 0.7) trap this heat inside, and the addition of heavy insulation then means the structure is already warm in the evening and therefore needs less heating. In the Sun Ship, a commercial, retail and residential PlusEnergy structure, techniques such as phase changing materials in the walls and vacuum insulation are also used. This permits maximum availability of floor space without compromising efficient insulation. Social and community aspects An important part of the PlusEnergy approach that differentiates it from similar concepts is that the owner or tenant of a PlusEnergy building should be able to live and work comfortably in it without sacrificing lifestyle or normal living standards. For example, solar panels are made aesthetically pleasing so that they are integrated into the fa√ßade of the structure. This reflects PlusEnergy's emphasis on community planning and integration, with aspects of transportation, water management and communication also being seen as part of the design. PlusEnergy design also emphasises the importance of sustainable development on communities in general. An energy-efficient community is seen as generating positive identification and community pride. Rolf Disch says he attracts a high quality of tenant, innovative undertakings and creative work places through his designs. Ecological urban planning techniques like traffic management with wide, attractive walkways, bicycle routes and connections to public transportation are all part of the PlusEnergy ideal. At the Solar Settlement for example, tenants and owners incorporate bicycle and car- sharing, and the neighborhood has an extensive car-free zone with many public transportation connections. Example projects=Heliotrope Built in 1994 as the private residence and special project of Rolf Disch in Freiburg, the Heliotrope is claimed by its designer to be the first building in the world to create more energy than it uses, being reliant on entirely renewable power, and being emissions free and CO2 neutral. The structure rotates to track the sun, which allows it to use a large amount of natural sunlight and warmth during the day. Several different energy generation technologies are used in the building, including a dual-axis solar photovoltaic tracking panel, a geothermal heat exchanger, a combined heat and power unit (CHP) and solar- thermal balcony railing to provide heat and warm water. These in combination with the large amounts of insulation allow the Heliotrope to produce between four and six times its energy usage depending on the time of year. The building is also fitted with a grey-water cleansing system and built-in waste composting. After the success of Freiburg‚Äôs Heliotrope, Hansgrohe contracted Rolf Disch Solar Architecture to design and built another Heliotrope to be used as a visitors' center and showroom in Offenburg, Germany. A third Heliotrope was then built in Hilpoltstein, Bavaria to be used as a technical dental laboratory.

The project, called Solar Settlement, won 2002 House of the Year, 2002 Residential PV Solar Integration Award, and Germany‚Äôs Most Beautiful Housing Community, 2006. Built between 2000 and 2005 in the Vauban quarter of Freiburg, the Solar Settlement is intended as an example of Disch‚Äôs vision of a ‚Äúfundamental environmental imperative‚Äù. As of 2011, the homes have had more than 8 years of full occupancy and each produced more than 5,000 Euros ($5,600) of surplus energy a year, from which the owners of the houses have benefitted. Made from Black Forest timber, the wood interior and natural lighting provide for happily lit spaces and a natural flow from room to room. The tenants at the Solar Settlement claim not to have made any compromises in their living standards, and that they have benefitted environmentally and economically. Sun Ship The Sun Ship, located next to the Solar Settlement in Freiburg, uses its for retail, commercial and residential space. The Sun Ship houses a supermarket, convenience store and caf√© on the first floor, offices and work spaces on the 2nd and 4th floors, and 9 penthouses on its roof. Notable aspects of the building are its vacuum insulated walls, ventilation with 95% heat recovery, triple paned windows, and solar-panelled fa√ßade. As the first positive energy office building worldwide, the Sun Ship exhibits not only high energy efficiency but also a pleasant environment to work in. The office spaces are flanked on both the North and South ends entirely with windows, which captures natural sunlight and minimizes the energy wasted by artificial light. In addition to the office and retail space, two conference rooms provide space for lectures, meetings and as a showroom.

It is headquartered in Montreal. In 2012, the company signified its intent to dissolve, but is still undergoing liquidation as of 2020. History ACE Aviation Holdings was created as Air Canada emerged from bankruptcy in 2004; By the end of 2005, ACE completed restructuring and achieved reduced costs through outsourcing, automation and process simplification. One of the more significant changes was the merging of its six small airlines into Air Canada and Air Canada Jazz. ACE was not only a solution to Air Canada's bankruptcy, but also a strategic move by Robert Milton to create a portfolio of independent air transportation services companies out of what was Air Canada. Among the companies in addition to Air Canada which was taken public after formation of ACE was the frequent flyer program Aeroplan. Aeroplan's initial public offering valued the company at , which was several times the valuation of the airline itself. In 2005, ACE contributed in equity investment to the merger of America West Holdings and US Airways Group, which resulted in US Airways emerging from its second bankruptcy. In 2008, ACE completed its divestment of Aeroplan and Air Canada's regional airline affiliate, Jazz. After these divestments, ACE retained a 75% stake in Air Canada and a 23% stake in Air Canada Technical Services. On May 9, 2012, the company received a certificate of intent to dissolve, marking the end of any future activities by the company.

Born in the inner-city Melbourne suburb of Collingwood, Ryder was known as the \\"King of Collingwood\\" for his long association with the local cricket team. An all-rounder, he claimed 612 wickets and scored 12,677 runs in 338 district matches. Career Ryder at the crease He played in four series against England and one against South Africa. In 1921‚Äì22, he averaged more than 100 in a series against South Africa. Ryder was an aggressive batsman and strong on the drive. He was also a useful medium-pace bowler. His best performance was an innings of 201 not out against England, made in six and half hours at Adelaide in 1924‚Äì25. This included century partnerships of 134 (with Tommy Andrews) and 108 (with Bert Oldfield). He made 88 in the second innings. In 1926‚Äì27, he made his highest first-class score of 295 (in four hours) for Victoria against New South Wales, in a world record team total of 1,107. Ryder smashed six sixes, including two in three balls, and was out attempting to hit another six to bring up his triple century. For over 50 years after his retirement, he held the record for games played and runs scored in Melbourne District Cricket, before being passed by district stalwart John Scholes. Ryder's bowling brought him 150 wickets for Victoria and 805 in all grades and he was an outstanding fieldsman, who once caught five English batsman in a Test innings. Selector Ryder's career as an Australia team selector was unusual. As Test captain, he was on the selection panel for the 1930 Ashes tour of England, but was out-voted for a place on the team, and the captaincy passed to Bill Woodfull. In 1946, he was made a selector again and held the post for 23 years, forming a long association with Sir Donald Bradman and Chappie Dwyer. Statistics and legacy Jack Ryder's career performance graph. He remains the only Test cricketer to be run out in both innings of his debut Test match. Ryder was also the first Australian to complete a Test Career of more than 20 innings with a batting average over 50.00. He was the oldest former player present at the Centenary Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in 1977. He died just weeks after the match. Ryder's long district cricket career for which he is best known spanned 37 years, from 1906‚Äì07 until 1942‚Äì43. His career of 338 games was played almost entirely for Collingwood, except for six games for Northcote in 1933‚Äì34 and 12 games for the VCA Colts in 1939‚Äì40. He scored 12,677 runs at 41.83 with 37 centuries, and took 612 wickets at 16.83 with 46 five-wicket hauls. The medal for the outstanding player of the season in Melbourne Premier Cricket is named in his honour, and was first presented in 1973‚Äì74. He holds the record for facing the most number of balls in a single test innings when batting at number seven position(461) He was also inducted into the Australian Hall of Fame by the CA in 2015.https://www.cricketaustralia.com.au/about/awards-and-events/australian- cricket-awards ReferencesExternal links * * Category:1889 births Category:1977 deaths Category:Australia national cricket team selectors Category:Australia Test cricket captains Category:Australia Test cricketers Category:Australian Cricket Hall of Fame inductees Category:Australian cricketers Category:Cricketers from Melbourne Category:Victoria cricketers ","title":"Jack Ryder (cricketer)"},{"id":"1866588","text":"right The Heidelberg Tun (), or Great Heidelberg Tun, is an extremely large wine vat contained within the cellars of Heidelberg Castle. There have been four such barrels in the history of Heidelberg. In 1751, the year of its construction, the present one had a capacity of 221,726 litres (58,574 U.S. gallons). Due to the drying of the wood its current capacity is 219,000 litres (57,854 U.S. gallons). One hundred and thirty oak trees were reputedly used in its construction. It has only rarely been used as a wine barrel, and in fact presently enjoys more use as a tourist attraction, and also as a dance floor since one was constructed on top of the tun. History Heidelberg's large wine barrel Heidelberg Castle has a history of enormous barrels; today's barrel (Fass) is the fourth in the history of the Neckar town. # Johann- Casimir-Fass (1591) # Karl-Ludwig-Fass (1664) # Karl-Philipp-Fass (1728) # Karl-Theodor-Fass (1751) When the French army captured the castle, the soldiers believed the empty wine barrel to be full of wine; their hatchet marks left on the barrel were later visible to tourists. According to tradition and local legend, the eternal keeper of the enormous Tun remains Perkeo of Heidelberg, once a court jester and master of the castle‚Äôs spirit production (and a famously Herculean wine drinker). The barrel in literature The Tun, circa 1900. The Tun is referenced in Rudolf Erich Raspe's The Surprising Adventures of Baron Munchausen, Jules Verne's novel Five Weeks in a Balloon, Victor Hugo's Les Miserables, Washington Irving's The Specter Bridegroom, Mary Hazelton Wade's Bertha, Mark Twain's A Tramp Abroad and Wilhelm Busch's Die fromme Helena. It can also be found in Herman Melville's Moby-Dick as well as in Lyrisches Intermezzo by Heinrich Heine, later used in the song cycle Dichterliebe by Robert Schumann for the final song \\"Die alten, b√∂sen Lieder (The old evil songs)\\". Ezra Pound made reference to the Heidelberg Tun and to the legendary Perkeo in Canto LXXX of The Pisan Cantos (published 1948). The vast but empty vat, purposeless and deprived of its original use, is made to \\"rhyme\\" with the emptiness of war and the poet's own need to be filled with human companionship, of which he was deprived while incarcerated in the US Army Detention Center outside Pisa, Italy. The English writer Jerome K. Jerome visited it in 1890, during his return trip from Oberammergau: Anton Praetorius, the first Calvinistic pastor of the parochy of the wine-producing community of Dittelsheim, visited nearby Heidelberg, the centre of Calvin's theology in Germany. Impressed by the immensity of the Johann-Casimir-Fass, he wrote a poem in 1595 praising the barrel as an apparent proof of the superiority of Calvinism, entitled Vas Heidelbergense (Poem on the Great Wine Barrel in the Castle of Heidelberg).

An all-rounder, he captained the Australian team in eleven Tests, winning five, losing two with another four finishing in draws. In a Test career delayed by First World War he scored 1,352 runs at an average of 45.06, including four centuries. Collins was also a successful rugby league footballer, winning the 1911 NSWRFL season's grand final with the Eastern Suburbs club. Collins was a keen gambler, a pastime that became habitual during his time as a soldier in the Great War. After the war, he played with the Australian Imperial Forces cricket team (AIF XI) that toured England, South Africa and Australia and was later appointed captain of the team. He was not a stylish or forceful batsman, preferring to rely on nudges and deflections to score runs. His slow left arm off-spin, bowled from a two step run up, was seldom seen after the AIF XI tour. On return to Australia, he made his Test d√©but against England at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) scoring 104 in the second innings; the fifth Australian to score a century on Test d√©but. He was appointed captain of the Australian team in 1921 in South Africa, when the previous captain, Warwick Armstrong, fell ill. His Test career finished in disappointment and in a cloud of suspicion when Australia lost the Fifth Test and the Ashes against England in 1926. While some former players and cricket administrators suspected a case of match fixing, no material evidence supporting this has emerged. After his retirement from cricket, Collins used his gambling knowledge to start a career in horse racing, working as a bookmaker and commission agent. Early career Collins was born in Darlinghurst, an inner suburb of Sydney, the son of Thomas, an accountant, and Emma (n√©e Charlton). He attended Albion Street (Superior) Public School, where he showed an aptitude for cricket and rugby union. He played his early cricket with Paddington Cricket Club, bowling left arm spinners and batting well enough to be selected at 19 for the New South Wales cricket team (NSW).Pollard, p. 294‚Äì296. He made his first-class cricket debut against South Australia in 1909‚Äì1910 and was disappointing, scoring three and one and taking 1/35. He played one further match for the season, against Victoria. For the next two seasons, his opportunities at first-class level were limited but he managed to play against the touring South African and English sides. Collins also played first grade rugby league at this time in the New South Wales Rugby Football League premiership. He played at in Eastern Suburbs' grand final win of the 1911 NSWRFL season alongside the great Dally Messenger. He is sometimes confused with, but was not, the Bert Collins who played in Brisbane for Toombul's club, gaining selection for Queensland in 1912. Collins's first full season for NSW was in 1912‚Äì1913, playing ten matches and scoring 598 runs at an average of 42.71. He finished the season with 282 against Tasmania at Hobart. During the 1913 Australian winter, Collins was part of an Australian team that toured North America, playing Gentlemen of Philadelphia and a combined Canada‚ÄìUnited States team. First World War and Services XI In 1915 Collins was one of 417,000 Australians who enlisted and was a member of the First Australian Imperial Force (AIF) as a reinforcement for the Australian Light Horse. He served in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign and later on the Western Front, carting ammunition to the artillery shelling the German lines. At the end of the War, Collins was a Lance Corporal.Robinson, p. 148. Following the war he was included in an Australian Imperial Forces cricket team, touring England in 1919. Charles Kelleway, an officer, was the captain of the team for the first six matches. Despite Collins's rank Field Marshal Birdwood, the former commander of the Australian Corps, asked him to take over the captaincy for the remainder of the tour. Some of his colleagues were officers such as Jack Gregory and Nip Pellew. Collins proved a capable and popular captain with the team losing only four of twenty eight matches during the tour. He scored 1,615 runs including five centuries at an average of 38.45 and took 106 wickets at 16.55 apiece. Collins with the AIF team in London, 1919 On their way home the AIF team played ten matches in South Africa, eight of them first-class, remaining undefeated in this section of the tour. While Jack Gregory relished the conditions, the local newspapers acclaimed Collins as the finest player in the touring team.Pollard, pp. 932‚Äì933. Collins scored 602 runs in South Africa at an average of 50.58 and took 39 wickets at 16.53. In a match at the Old Wanderers ground in Johannesburg against the South African XI, Collins scored 235 from a total of 441 in the first innings as the AIF XI won by 8 wickets. On arrival back in Australia, the AIF team played three first-class matches, defeating the reigning Sheffield Shield champions New South Wales and perennial Shield powerhouse Victoria. A likely victory against Queensland was frustrated due to torrential rain. The results in Australia demonstrated the strength of the AIF team and within a few months of the team's dissolution, Collins would make his Test d√©but, along with his AIF team-mates, Gregory, wicket-keeper Bert Oldfield and the batsmen Johnny Taylor and Nip Pellew. Test career=D√©but Collins's batting stance Test cricket returned from its hiatus in 1920 with the English touring Australia. Collins, also a selector, was one of six AIF XI players to make his d√©but in the First Test of that series.Haigh, pp. 270, 284. The First Test was played on Collins's home ground, the Sydney Cricket Ground and Collins had reason to feel at home, scoring 70 and 104. Collins was only the fifth Australian to make a century on Test d√©but. Collins scored another century in the Third Test at the Adelaide Oval, batting 258 minutes for 162, helping Australia to a 119 run victory. Over the 1920‚Äì1921 series, Collins made 557 runs at an average of 61.88. The Australians toured England in 1921, the first representative tour since the disastrous 1912 Triangular Tournament. Collins was included in the squad that would win the series comprehensively, three Tests to nil. In the First Test at Trent Bridge, Collins broke his thumb, ruling him out of the next two internationals. He returned to the team for the Fourth Test, after Australia had already wrapped up the series. England had fought back well and Australia were forced to defend grimly. Batting for over four and a half hours with what Wisden described as \\"inexhaustible patience\\", Collins scored 40 runs in Australia's only innings to force a draw. Collins scored 1,222 runs in all matches on tour at an average of 33.94. Captain On the return trip to Australia, the Australian team stopped in South Africa for a short tour. Due to illness, captain Warwick Armstrong was unable to take part in any of the matches and as a result Collins was appointed captain in his place. The first two Tests were drawn but Australia won the third Test and the series at Cape Town. In the second Test of the series, Collins scored a remarkable double century (203) on the matting pitch at the Old Wanderers ground in Johannesburg, unearthing a range of shots he had rarely used. With Gregory, who scored 119, the pair put on a partnership of 209 in 85 minutes, destroying the South African bowling.Robinson, p. 150. In six matches played, Collins scored 548 runs, including two centuries at an average of 60.88. Caricature of Collins on a cigarette card The next international visitors to Australia were the English team of 1924‚Äì1925, under the captaincy of Arthur Gilligan. In the First Test at Sydney, Collins opened the batting and scored 114. Batting with a young Victorian in his d√©but Test, Bill Ponsford, Collins was confident enough to shelter him from the brilliant swing bowling of Maurice Tate. Ponsford went on to make a century (110) on d√©but.Robinson, p. 151. Ponsford later said \\"I was most grateful for Herbie taking [Tate's bowling] until I was settled in. I doubt I would have scored a century but for his selfless approach.\\" In the Second Test at Melbourne, chasing 600, the English pair of Jack Hobbs and Herbert Sutcliffe batted throughout the third day for an unbroken partnership of 283. Before play commenced the next day, Collins said to his profligate leg spinner, \\"You're going straight on to get Hobbs if we're to have a chance\\". The first ball of the day, Mailey bowled a full toss. Collins moved the field, leaving a gap in the offside field. The next ball was another full toss and Hobbs, looking to hit it into the gap, missed it all ends up and was bowled for 154. The Adelaide Test was a thriller with England needing 27 runs to win the Test with two wickets in hand. Collins, ever the gambler, threw the ball once again to Mailey, who was not known for his accuracy or containment. The gamble paid off with Mailey dismissing Tich Freeman and Gregory removing Gilligan at the other end to win the Test by eleven runs and secure The Ashes. Australia won the series four Tests to one. During the Adelaide Test, Collins was approached by a \\"well known racing identity\\" who offered him ¬£100 to throw the match. Collins rejected the approach and suggested to team mate Arthur Mailey that they throw the visitor down the stairs. Controversy and retirement The 1926 tour of England would be Collins's last. Partly as a result of a wet English summer, the first four Tests of the five-Test series ended in draws. Collins had a disappointing tour, suffering from neuritis and in constant pain from arthritis. He missed the Third and Fourth Tests when admitted to hospital but recovered to resume his place as captain for the Fifth Test. The Fifth Test, played at the Oval, saw England win the toss and bat. They compiled 280, Mailey taking five wickets. Australia responded with 302, dismissed late on the second day. At stumps, England ‚Äì in their second innings ‚Äì were 0/49. A violent thunderstorm inundated the ground overnight, rendering the pitch sticky. Collins attracted a great deal of negative attention by using the inexperienced Arthur Richardson as a main strike bowler at the expense of the likes of Mailey and Clarrie Grimmett.Perry, pp. 126‚Äì131. The English openers, Hobbs and Sutcliffe, took advantage of this by compiling a 172-run opening partnership. England were bowled out in their second innings for 436, 415 runs ahead. Australia were dismissed for 125, losing the match by 289 runs. The Test was to be Collins's last. Such was the disappointment at losing the Ashes, Collins was stripped not only of the New South Wales captaincy but also that of his local club, Waverley.Harte (1993), pp 300‚Äì301. Former players, including his former Waverley captain, the influential Monty Noble, publicly criticised Collins' captaincy. Hunter Hendry, viewing the match from the stands, suspected Collins threw the match. Despite his reputation as a gambler, there is no material evidence that Collins ever fixed the result of any cricket match. Rugby league career In the 1911 cricket off season Collins played rugby league for Sydney's Eastern Suburbs club. A , Collins played alongside rugby league \\"immortal\\", Dally Messenger when the Eastern Suburbs club won its first ever premiership.Whiticker, p. 95. He is sometimes confused with, but was not, the Bert Collins who played in Brisbane for Toombul's club and represented Queensland on three occasions. Tommy Andrews in the 1930s Outside cricket Collins was an enthusiastic gambler, renowned by his team mates for finding any reason to bet. Mailey stated that Collins's haunts \\"were the racetrack, the dog track, a baccarat joint at Kings Cross, a two-up school in the Flanders trenches and anywhere a quiet game of poker was being played.\\" His New South Wales team mate Hal Hooker remarked of Collins: > He would bet on anything‚Äîperhaps he was the original of the saying about > flies crawling up the window. Waiting on a railway line he would bet on how > many trains would pass through the opposite platform. how may carriages > would be on the next one, how many carriage windows would be open. In a > train he would produce a brass top stamped Put and Take‚Äîhe paid or collected > according to which way it fell when it stopped spinning.Robinson, p. 153. Collins was known for all night poker sessions before going out to open the batting but refused to play against his fellow cricketers, seeing no challenge in taking money from novices. His gambling attracted some criticism and Collins was seen by many, including some cricket administrators, as an inveterate gambler. Collins working as a bookmaker He turned his interest in gambling into a career, taking out a bookmakers' licence for a period and he served as a steward at pony races in Sydney. Neither role appealed to him as much as acting as a commission agent for other bookmakers. Collins would \\"lay- off\\" for bookmakers over committed on certain horses, placing large bets carefully and with cool calculation. He won and lost two fortunes on the track and at one stage required the assistance of the New South Wales Cricketers Fund to support him and his invalid mother. He re-enlisted in the Australian Army during the Second World War, stationed at Victoria Barracks with the rank of sergeant. In 1940, Collins, then aged 51, married 24-year-old Marjorie Paine, the daughter of a race steward. The marriage produced a son before ending in divorce eleven years later; a petition served by Collins was not defended by his wife.Robinson, p. 154. After his divorce, Collins continued to frequent gambling clubs at Kings Cross, participating in all-night poker sessions. Despite giving up smoking late in life, his lungs failed him and he died of cancer in 1959, aged 70. Playing style and personality Graph of Collins' Test batting performance. Collins was short, no more than and slight. As a batsman, he was not an extravagant strokeplayer, preferring to avoid risk and leave balls on a good length where possible.Robinson, pp. 149‚Äì150. He batted with very little backlift and at first inspection could seem strokeless, scoring only from pushes and prods, nudges and dabs. His patience was renowned with the contemporary cricket writer Ray Robinson remarking \\"[Collins] had an implacable trench warfare style that in difficult times earned admiration from his own side, put bowlers on the road to exasperation and sent onlookers through the doors of bars.\\" His one bold shot was an over- the-shoulder hook shot, finishing standing on his right foot, his left foot six inches in the air. Deficient in driving power, bowlers learnt to lessen his scoring power by pitching the ball well up. He often batted without the protection of gloves, especially on easy pitches. Collins bowled his slow left arm spinners off two steps, with seemingly little effort. In South Africa while bowling, a batsman was heard to yell \\"Collins is getting weary, Why don't you carry him to the wicket?\\"Robinson, p. 147. After his efforts for the AIF team he seldom bowled long spells again. Popular with his men, Collins was respected for his faith in his team mates and his ability to relate to different personalities. The Test leg-spinner, Arthur Mailey noted, \\"I learnt more of the psychology of cricket from Collins from all the hundreds of cricketers I met.\\"Robinson, p. 152. Bert Oldfield said of Collins, \\"He studied every player's temperament and acted accordingly.\\" Collins was undemonstrative, expecting his fieldsmen to look at him every after every delivery and adjust their position in response to his slight hand movements or even a bent finger. He was last to shower at the end of a day's play, preferring to sit in a corner in silence. His team mates assumed that he was contemplating the day's action and pondering on the next day's possibilities. He was a successful Test captain, leading Australia to five wins and two losses; four matches finished in draws. Many nicknames attached themselves to Collins, including \\"Lucky\\" and \\"Horseshoe\\" as a result of his reputation for fortune, especially when it came to tossing the coin. His players called him \\"Maudy\\" (probably because of his left-handedness) and \\"Nutty\\"; it is unclear if this was because he used his \\"nut\\" (head) or was a hard nut to crack. Mailey nicknamed him \\"The squirrel\\", claiming that Collins eyes glowed at night, enabling him to see better at night than by day. Collins has a bohemian character who enjoyed all night poker and baccarat sessions and evenings at the opera. \\"Poker Face\\", indeed, was another of his nicknames. He had a light tenor voice himself and would sometimes sing at parties. While in the army, Collins became a chain smoker but he remained a teetotaller, save for an occasional glass of celebratory champagne.

Overview NCSIST was established by the Republic of China government to serve as a military R&D; and systems integration center. In 2014 it became an administrative corporation owned by the Government of Taiwan. NCSIST is involve in product development, manufacturing, delivery, total life cycle sustainment and maintenance. NCSIST fulfills a function comparable to the American Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) but they also assume mixed roles in competing for and awarding research and development, integration and manufacturing contracts. Along with the Aerospace Industrial Development Corporation NCSIST it is considered to be one of the two Taiwanese prime defense contractors. History=Early history 9M14 Malyutka cutaway Gearing class destroyer underway in 1952 Prior to the establishment of NCSIST, Taiwan had a poorly organized national defense industrial program, but the nation was faced with an increasing military threat from the People's Republic of China and a drawdown in international support and exclusion from international forums. The Republic of China would need to build its own set of hardware, instruments, laboratories, and test sites if it was to secure its independence and security. Preparation for the NCSIST began in 1965, ground was broken on the Shinshin Campus in 1966, and the institute was formally inaugurated in 1969. Early work includes various missile and radar systems, as well as systems integration for ROC military aircraft and ships. The NCSIST was also, and remains, active in military construction. After the United States switched diplomatic recognition from the Republic of China to the People's Republic of China the Institute became even more important as Taiwanese authorities felt they could no longer view the United States as a reliable defense partner. In the 1970s, the Institute replicated and produced the 9M14 Malyutka wire-guided anti-tank guided missile as the Kun Wu. The ROC had obtained the 9M14 Malyutkas from South Vietnam. Due to the dated design and low priority placed on anti-tank weapons by the armed forces it was not widely adopted. By the mid 1970s the Institute employed about 2,000 professionals. In the late 1970s the Institute embarked on a project to create a short-range ballistic missile prototype known as the Ching Feng. The project was intended as a pilot project to build the necessary skills needed for a long range missile program. The Ching Feng was a single stage missile which could carry a 450 kg warhead up to 110 km. The type was displayed publicly in 1981 but production was cancelled in 1982 because of significant problems with the solid rocket motor and the guidance system. Overall the type resembled the American MGM-52 Lance. The follow on missile to, to be named Sky Horse, was also abandoned in 1981 under US pressure although interest in the type was revived in the 1990s after the Third Taiwan Strait Crisis. In the 1980s the Institute worked with Honeywell to design a distributed open architecture combat system to replace the obsolete MK 37 Gun Fire Control System aboard Taiwan's Gearing-class destroyers. This system, called the Modular Combat System (MCS), was the first distributed open architecture combat system in the world and featured easily upgradable COTS components. The system had challenges but did the job and was affordable with the architecture, computer, and software all being developed in Taiwan. In the 1990s Taiwan was faced with tightening restrictions on arms imports from the international community as well as instability caused by the transition from authoritarian to a democracy system. The Institute responded the these challenges by widening the scope of its R&D; programs and implementing a system of vertical integration. In the late 1990s NCSIST developed a space launch platform based on their ballistic missile technology but this program was put on hold under a combination of US pressure and a promise to subsidize Taiwanese satellite launches using commercial American companies such as SpaceX. In 2011 NCSIST awarded MiTAC a NT$70 million (US$2.22 million) contract to build one prototype ‚ÄúRadar Vehicle for Field Operation and Air Defense.‚Äù In 2015 police in Taoyuan took into custody three workers and one manager from MiTAC on charges of forgery of data and fabrication of test results. The tender required the vehicle to be able to advance at 8 km/h up a 40 degree incline, the vehicle MiTAC delivered could only advance at 6 km/h. In addition three NCSIST staff were detained on suspicion of colluding with the MiTAC employees to fabricate the test results, these staff then presented the fabricated results to their superiors for approval. The Taoyuan District Prosecutors‚Äô Office began investigating after receiving a tip. Modern history Mk 13 missile launcher with SM-1 First model of the Hsiung Feng III Anti-Ship Missile In 2014 NCSIST was made an administrative corporation by the government, ending its period of secrecy and opening up the opportunity to partner with foreign corporations and export equipment internationally. The new corporate Board of Directors had their first meeting on April 18, 2014. The transition removed a number of restrictions for employees who were now no longer members of the military. Due to the end of the US Navy‚Äôs support of the SM-1 missile system NCSIST has taken over support for the system including production of replacement rocket motors. The same approach was taken for the SM-1‚Äôs Mark 13 missile launcher. In 2016 NCSIST was awarded a $16.7m contract to carry out a life extension program for the Republic of China Air Force‚Äôs stocks of MICA and Magic 2 air- to-air missiles. These two missiles arm the ROCAF‚Äôs Mirage 2000 fighter aircraft. In 2017 NCIST exhibited again at International Defence Exhibition in Abu Dhabi after a twelve year absence. They exhibited 39 items. In the mid 2010s NCSIST partnered with AIDC and the Republic of China Air Force (ROCAF) to create an advanced jet trainer based on the F-CK-1. AIDC is the prime contractor on the project with NCSIST taking a supporting role. Originally designated the XT-5 Blue Magpie but ruled out as the T-5 Brave Eagle the aircraft is based on the two-seat version of the F-CK-1 but with non- afterburning engines, greater fuel capacity, more stable wing profile, and the removal of the internal gun. The first of four prototypes, designated A1, was rolled out in September 2019. Low rate production is intended to commence in 2021 with mass production beginning in 2023. NCSIST is participating in the development of the first domestic Taiwanese AUV. In 2019 NCSIST launched an 80-ton 28m long high speed catamaran research and test vessel named the Glorious Star (ÂÖâÊ¶Æ‰πãÊòü). Built in the Lungteh Shipbuilding in Yilan County the purpose of the vessel is to shorten the research and development process for naval weapon systems. In 2019 Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen ordered the NCSIST to accelerate mass production of the TK-3 and HF-3 in response to increasing Chinese military power and bellicosity. In addition to stepping up missile production the President also ordered NCSIST leadership to focus building up their talent pool and increase partnerships with academia, industry and government at home and abroad. Mass production of the long-range Yun Feng supersonic cruise missile began in 2019. In 2019 NCSIST opened Taiwan‚Äôs first national unmanned aerial vehicle test site in Miaoli County. The test site is managed in partnership by NCSIST, the Miaoli County government, and the Ministry of Transportation and Communications (Taiwan). The site features a 20m runway and is rated for testing UAVs up to 150 kg in weight. They also entered into an agreement with Asustek Computer Inc to collaborate on cloud-based storage, artificial intelligence, and Internet of Things technology. In November 2019 NCSIST tested a new short range anti-ship missile from the Glorious Star which while weighting significantly less than the Hsiung Feng II is said to have the same range. In March 2020 NCSIST conducted live fire daytime and nighttime artillery and UAV detection tests which where observed by a People's Liberation Army Navy Hsiang Yang Hung-class survey vessel. In April 2020 Chang Chung-Cheng (ÂºµÂø†Ë™†) replaced Gao Chung-Hsing (Êù≤‰∏≠Ëàà) as the president of NCSIST. Gao had courted controversy by deliberately misinterpreting The Classified National Security Information Protection Act. Chang Chung-Cheng is a retired major general who served in the Combined Logistics Command as well as the Armaments Bureau. In July 2020 NCSIST was awarded a NT$4.8 billion (US$163 million) contract to produce 516 sets of secure high frequency radios for the Taiwanese military. The military side of the contract will be handled by the Navy with a deadline for delivery in late 2023.  WMDs  The institute developed nuclear weapons during the Cold War. In 1967, a nuclear weapons program began under the auspices of the Institute of Nuclear Energy Research (INER) of CSIST. After the International Atomic Energy Agency found evidence of the ROC's efforts to produce weapons- grade plutonium, Taipei agreed in September 1976 under U.S. pressure to dismantle its nuclear weapons program. Though the nuclear reactor was soon shut down and the plutonium mostly returned to the U.S., a secret program was revealed when Colonel Chang Hsien-yi, deputy director of nuclear research at INER, defected to the U.S. in December 1987 and produced a cache of incriminating documents. At present there is no claim that any nuclear weapons program is being pursued.

Passive house () is a voluntary standard for energy efficiency in a building, which reduces the building's ecological footprint. It results in ultra-low energy buildings that require little energy for space heating or cooling. A similar standard, MINERGIE-P, is used in Switzerland. The standard is not confined to residential properties; several office buildings, schools, kindergartens and a supermarket have also been constructed to the standard. Passive design is not an attachment or supplement to architectural design, but a design process that integrates with architectural design. Although it is principally applied to new buildings, it has also been used for refurbishments. By late 2008, estimates of the number of Passive house buildings around the world ranged from 15,000 to 20,000 structures. As of August 2010, there were approximately 25,000 such certified structures of all types in Europe. The vast majority of passive structures have been built in German-speaking countries and Scandinavia.  History  The Passivhaus standard originated from a conversation in May 1988 between Bo Adamson of Lund University, Sweden, and Wolfgang Feist of the Institut f√ºr Wohnen und Umwelt (Institute for Housing and the Environment, Darmstadt, Germany). Later, their concept was further developed through a number of research projects, aided by financial assistance from the German state of Hessen. Much of the early 'Passive Houses' were based on research and the experience of North American builders during the 1970s, who ‚Äì in response to the oil embargo ‚Äì sought to build homes that used very little or no energy. These designs often utilized the sun as a heat source and the term 'passive house' was possibly derived from the passive solar features of these houses, such as the Saskatchewan Conservation House and the Leger House in Pepperell, Massachusetts. An early book explaining the concepts was The Passive Solar Energy Book by Edward Mazria in 1979.  First examples  The eventual construction of four row houses (terraced houses or town homes) was designed for four private clients by the architectural firm Bott, Ridder and Westermeyer. The first Passivhaus residences were built in Darmstadt in 1990, and occupied by the clients the following year.  Further implementation and councils  In September 1996, the Passivhaus-Institut was founded in Darmstadt to promote and control Passivhaus standards. As of 2010 an estimated 25,000+ Passivhaus structures have been built. Most are located in Germany and Austria, others in various countries worldwide. In 1996, after the concept had been validated at the Institute in Darmstadt, with space heating at 90% less than that required for a standard new building at the time, the Economical Passive Houses Working Group was created. This group developed the planning package and initiated the production of the innovative components that had been used, notably the windows and the high-efficiency ventilation systems. Meanwhile, further passive houses were built in Stuttgart (1993), Naumburg, Hesse, Wiesbaden, and Cologne (1997). Products, which had been developed for the Passivhaus standard were further commercialized during and following the European Union sponsored CEPHEUS project, which proved the concept in five European countries in the winter of 2000‚Äì2001. The first to be certified was built in 2006 near Bemidji, Minnesota in Camp Waldsee of the German Concordia Language Villages. The first US passive retrofit project, the remodeled craftsman O'Neill house in Sonoma, California was certified in July 2010. In the United States, the concept of passive design was first implemented by Katrin Klingenberg in 2003 when she built a passive home prototype named \\"The Smith House\\" in Urbana, Illinois. From here, she and builder Mike Kernagis co-founded the e-cological Construction Laboratory (e-colab) in 2004 to further explore the feasibility of affordable passive design. This eventually lead to the inception of the Passive House Institute United States (PHIUS) in 2007. Since then, the PHIUS has released their PHIUS + 2015 Building Standard and has certified over 1,200 projects and across the United States. In 2019, Park Avenue Green, a low-income housing building in New York, became the largest certified Passive House in North America. Ireland's first Passive House was built in 2005 by Tomas O'Leary, a Passive house designer and teacher. The house was called 'Out of the Blue'. Upon completion, Tomas moved into the building. The world's first standardised passive prefabricated house was built in Ireland in 2005 by Scandinavian Homes, a Swedish company, that has since built more passive houses in England and Poland. The first certified passive house in the Antwerpen region of Belgium was built in 2010. In 2011 the city of Heidelberg in Germany initiated the Bahnstadt project, which was seen as the world's largest passive house building area. A company in Qatar was planning the country's first Passive House in 2013, the first in the region. The world's tallest passive-house is located in the Bolueta neighborhood in Bilbao, Spain. At , it is the world's tallest building certified under the standard in 2018. The $14.5 million, 171-unit development (including a nine-story companion to the high-rise) consists entirely of social housing. Gaobeidian, China hosted the 23rd International Passive House Conference in 2019, and is home to Gaobeidian Railway City apartment complex is the world's largest passive house project. China is taking a leadership role in passive house construction, with \\"73 different companies making windows to Passive House standards.\\"  Standards  The dark colours on this thermogram of a Passive house, at right, shows how little heat is escaping compared to a traditional building to the left. While some techniques and technologies were specifically developed for the Passive House standard, others, such as superinsulation, already existed, and the concept of passive solar building design dates back to antiquity. There was other previous experience with low-energy building standards, notably the German Niedrigenergiehaus (low-energy house) standard, as well as from buildings constructed to the demanding energy codes of Sweden and Denmark.  International Passivhaus Standard  The Passivhaus standard requires that the building fulfills the following requirements: * Use up to per year for heating and cooling as calculated by the Passivhaus Planning Package, or a peak heat load of , based on local climate data. * Use up to per year primary energy (for heating, hot water and electricity). * Leak air up to 0.6 times the house volume per hour (n50 ‚â§ 0.6 / hour) at as tested by a blower door; or up to per square foot of the surface area of the enclosure.  Recommendations  The specific heat load for the heating source at design temperature is recommended, but not required, to be less than 10 W/m2 (3.17 btu/(h‚ãÖft2)). These standards are much higher than houses built to most normal building codes. For comparisons, see the international comparisons section below. National partners within the 'consortium for the Promotion of European Passive Houses' are thought to have some flexibility to adapt these limits locally.  Space heating requirement  If a building meets the Passivhaus standards, it does not need conventional heating systems, though some heating will still be required and most Passivhaus buildings include supplemental space heating. This is normally distributed through the low-volume heat recovery ventilation system that is required to maintain air quality, rather than by a conventional hydronic or high-volume forced-air heating system, as described in the space heating section below.  Passive House Institute US Standard  The PHIUS + 2015 Standard primarily focuses on reducing negative effects of building operations, for any type of building. This standard also uses climate data sets to determine specific building performance criteria for different regions. Such information is determined using metrics that represent a space where significant carbon and energy reduction overlap with cost- effectiveness. Overall, the PHIUS database includes more than 1000 climate data sets for North America. The Institute believes that this approach to the Standard is essential, as North America has variety of different climates and different passive measures may be more effective than others. The standard is based on five principles: airtightness, ventilation, waterproofing, heating and cooling, and electrical loads. Within these principles, projects must pass building specified blower door, ventilation airflow, overall airflow, and electrical load tests; buildings must also achieve other measures such as low- emission materials, renewable energy systems, moisture control, outdoor ventilation, and energy efficient ventilation and space conditioning equipment. All buildings must also pass a quality assurance and quality control test ‚Äì this is implemented to ensure that the building continues to adhere to the regional criteria set forth by the PHIUS‚Äô climate data. These tests and analyses of operative conditions are performed by PHIUS raters or verifiers. These are accredited professionals from the PHIUS that are able to perform on-site testing and inspections to ensure that the newly constructed building is adhering to the construction plans, created energy models, and desired operating conditions.  Construction costs  In Passivhaus buildings, the cost savings from dispensing with the conventional heating system can be used to fund the upgrade of the building envelope and the heat recovery ventilation system. With careful design and increasing competition in the supply of the specifically designed Passivhaus building products, in Germany it is now possible to construct buildings for the same cost as those built to normal German building standards, as was done with the Passivhaus apartments at Vauban, Freiburg. On average passive houses are reported to be more expensive upfront than conventional buildings - 5% to 8% in Germany, 8% to 10% in UK and 5% to 10% in USA. Evaluations have indicated that while it is technically possible, the costs of meeting the Passivhaus standard increase significantly when building in Northern Europe above 60¬∞ latitude. European cities at approximately 60¬∞ include Helsinki in Finland and Bergen in Norway. London is at 51¬∞; Moscow is at 55¬∞.  Design and construction  low-energy building techniques and technologies. Achieving the major decrease in heating energy consumption required by the standard involves a shift in approach to building design and construction. Design may be assisted by use of the 'Passivhaus Planning Package' (PHPP), which uses specifically designed computer simulations. Below are the techniques used to achieve the standard.  Passive solar design and landscape  Passive solar building design and energy-efficient landscaping support the Passive house energy conservation and can integrate them into a neighborhood and environment. Following passive solar building techniques, where possible buildings are compact in shape to reduce their surface area, with principal windows oriented towards the equator ‚Äì south in the northern hemisphere and north in the southern hemisphere ‚Äì to maximize passive solar gain. However, the use of solar gain, especially in temperate climate regions, is secondary to minimizing the overall house energy requirements. In climates and regions needing to reduce excessive summer passive solar heat gain, whether from direct or reflected sources, brise soleil, trees, attached pergolas with vines, vertical gardens, green roofs, and other techniques are implemented. Exterior wall color, when the surface allows choice, for reflection or absorption insolation qualities depends on the predominant year-round ambient outdoor temperature. The use of deciduous trees and wall trellised or self attaching vines can assist in climates not at the temperature extremes.  Superinsulation  Passivhaus buildings employ superinsulation to significantly reduce the heat transfer through the walls, roof and floor compared to conventional buildings. A wide range of thermal insulation materials can be used to provide the required high R-values (low U-values, typically in the 0.10 to 0.15 W/(m¬≤¬∑K) range). Special attention is given to eliminating thermal bridges. A disadvantage resulting from the thickness of wall insulation required is that, unless the external dimensions of the building can be enlarged to compensate, the internal floor area of the building may be less compared to traditional construction. In Sweden, to achieve passive house standards, the insulation thickness would be (0.10 W/(m¬≤¬∑K)) and the roof (U-value 0.066 W/(m¬≤¬∑K)).  Advanced window technology  Typical Passive House windows. To meet the requirements of the Passivhaus standard, windows are manufactured with exceptionally high R-values (low U-values, typically 0.85 to 0.70 W/(m¬≤¬∑K) for the entire window including the frame). These normally combine triple-pane insulated glazing (with a good solar heat-gain coefficient, low-emissivity coatings, sealed argon or krypton gas filled inter-pane voids, and 'warm edge' insulating glass spacers) with air-seals and specially developed thermal break window frames. In Central Europe and most of the United States, for unobstructed south-facing Passivhaus windows, the heat gains from the sun are, on average, greater than the heat losses, even in mid-winter.  Airtightness  Building envelopes under the Passivhaus standard are required to be extremely airtight compared to conventional construction. They are required to meet either 0.60 ACH50 (air changes per hour at 50 pascals) based on the building's volume, or 0.05 CFM50/sf (cubic feet per minute at 50 pascals, per square foot of building enclosure surface area). In order to achieve these metrics, recommended best practice is to test the building air barrier enclosure with a blower door at mid-construction if possible. Passive house is designed so that most of the air exchange with exterior is done by controlled ventilation through a heat- exchanger in order to minimize heat loss (or gain, depending on climate), so uncontrolled air leaks are best avoided. Another reason is the passive house standard makes extensive use of insulation which usually requires a careful management of moisture and dew points. This is achieved through air barriers, careful sealing of every construction joint in the building envelope, and sealing of all service penetrations.  Ventilation  Use of passive natural ventilation is an integral component of passive house design where ambient temperature is conducive ‚Äî either by singular or cross ventilation, by a simple opening or enhanced by the stack effect from smaller ingress with larger egress windows and/or clerestory-operable skylight. When ambient climate is not conducive, mechanical heat recovery ventilation systems, with a heat recovery rate of over 80% and high-efficiency electronically commutated motors (ECM), are employed to maintain air quality, and to recover sufficient heat to dispense with a conventional central heating system. Since passively designed buildings are essentially air-tight, the rate of air change can be optimized and carefully controlled at about 0.4 air changes per hour. All ventilation ducts are insulated and sealed against leakage. Some Passivhaus builders promote the use of earth warming tubes. These are typically around in diameter, long at a depth of about . These are buried in the soil to act as earth-to-air heat exchangers and pre-heat (or pre-cool) the intake air for the ventilation system. In cold weather, the warmed air also prevents ice formation in the heat recovery system's heat exchanger. Concerns about this technique have arisen in some climates due to problems with condensation and mold. Alternatively, an earth to air heat exchanger can use a liquid circuit instead of an air circuit, with a heat exchanger (battery) on the supply air.  Space heating  In addition to the heat exchanger (centre), a micro-heat pump extracts heat from the exhaust air (left) and hot water heats the ventilation air (right). The ability to control building temperature using only the normal volume of ventilation air is fundamental. In addition to using passive solar gain, Passivhaus buildings make extensive use of their intrinsic heat from internal sources‚Äîsuch as waste heat from lighting, white goods (major appliances) and other electrical devices (but not dedicated heaters)‚Äîas well as body heat from the people and other animals inside the building. This is due to the fact that people, on average, emit heat equivalent to 100 watts each of radiated thermal energy. Together with the comprehensive energy conservation measures taken, this means that a conventional central heating system is not necessary, although they are sometimes installed due to client skepticism.Zeller, 2010. p.BU1. Example: in the case of the Landau home described in the NYT's article, several insurance companies refused to insure their home when they were told there was no home furnace in the structure, fearing that they would be held financially liable for frozen water pipe damage. Instead, Passive houses sometimes have a dual purpose 800 to 1,500 watt heating and/or cooling element integrated with the supply air duct of the ventilation system, for use during the coldest days. It is fundamental to the design that all the heat required can be transported by the normal low air volume required for ventilation. A maximum air temperature of is applied, to prevent any possible smell of scorching from dust that escapes the filters in the system. The air-heating element can be heated by a small heat pump, by direct solar thermal energy, annualized geothermal solar, or simply by a natural gas or oil burner. In some cases a micro-heat pump is used to extract additional heat from the exhaust ventilation air, using it to heat either the incoming air or the hot water storage tank. Small wood-burning stoves can also be used to heat the water tank, although care is required to ensure that the room in which stove is located does not overheat. Beyond the recovery of heat by the heat recovery ventilation unit, a well designed Passive house in the European climate should not need any supplemental heat source if the heating load is kept under 10 W/m¬≤. Because the heating capacity and the heating energy required by a passive house both are very low, the particular energy source selected has fewer financial implications than in a traditional building, although renewable energy sources are well suited to such low loads. The Passive house standards in Europe determine a space heating and cooling energy demand of pear year, and peak demand. In addition, the total energy to be used in the building operations including heating, cooling, lighting, equipment, hot water, plug loads, etc. is limited to of treated floor area per year.  Lighting and electrical appliances  To minimize the total primary energy consumption, the many passive and active daylighting techniques are the first daytime solution to employ. For low-light days, non-daylighted spaces, and nighttime, the use of creative-sustainable lighting design using low- energy sources can be used. Low-energy sources include 'standard voltage' compact fluorescent lamps, solid-state lighting with LED lamps, organic light- emitting diodes, PLED ‚Äì polymer light-emitting diodes, 'low voltage' electrical filament-Incandescent light bulbs, compact metal halide, xenon, and halogen lamps. Solar powered exterior circulation, security, and landscape lighting ‚Äì with photovoltaic cells on each fixture or connecting to a central Solar panel system, are available for gardens and outdoor needs. Low voltage systems can be used for more controlled or independent illumination, while still using less electricity than conventional fixtures and lamps. Timers, motion detection and natural light operation sensors reduce energy consumption, and light pollution even further for a Passivhaus setting. Appliance consumer products meeting independent energy efficiency testing and receiving Ecolabel certification marks for reduced electrical-'natural-gas' consumption and product manufacturing carbon emission labels are preferred for use in Passive houses. The ecolabel certification marks of Energy Star and EKOenergy are examples.  Traits of passive houses  Typically, passive houses feature: * Fresh, clean air: Note that for the parameters tested, and provided the filters (minimum F6) are maintained, HEPA quality air is provided. 0.3 air changes per hour (ACH) are recommended, otherwise the air can become \\"stale\\" (excess CO2, flushing of indoor air pollutants) and any greater, excessively dry (less than 40% humidity). This implies careful selection of interior finishes and furnishings, to minimize indoor air pollution from VOC's (e.g., formaldehyde). This can be counteracted somewhat by opening a window for a very brief time, by plants, and by indoor fountains. * Because of the high resistance to heat flow (high R-value insulation), there are no \\"outside walls\\" which are colder than other walls. * Homogeneous interior temperature: it is impossible to have single rooms (e.g. the sleeping rooms) at a different temperature from the rest of the house. Note that the relatively high temperature of the sleeping areas is physiologically not considered desirable by some building scientists. Bedroom windows can be cracked open slightly to alleviate this when necessary. * Slow temperature changes: with ventilation and heating systems switched off, a passive house typically loses less than per day (in winter), stabilizing at around in the central European climate. * Quick return to normal temperature: opening windows or doors for a short time has only a limited effect; after apertures are closed, the air very quickly returns to the \\"normal\\" temperature. * Some have voiced concerns that Passivhaus is not a general approach as the occupant has to behave in a prescribed way, for example not opening windows too often. However modelling shows that such concerns are not valid.  International comparisons  * In the United States, a house built to the Passive House standard results in a building that requires space heating energy of per heating degree day, compared with about per heating degree day for a similar building built to meet the 2003 Model Energy Efficiency Code. This is between 75 and 95% less energy for space heating and cooling than current new buildings that meet today's US energy efficiency codes. The Passivhaus in the German-language camp of Waldsee, Minnesota was designed under the guidance of architect Stephan Tanner of INTEP, LLC, a Minneapolis- and Munich-based consulting company for high performance and sustainable construction. Waldsee BioHaus is modeled on Germany's Passivhaus standard: beyond that of the U.S. LEED standard which improves quality of life inside the building while using 85% less energy than a house built to Minnesota building codes. VOLKsHouse 1.0 was the first certified Passive House offered and sold in Santa Fe New Mexico. * In the United Kingdom, an average new house built to the Passive House standard would use 77% less energy for space heating, compared to the circa-2006 Building Regulations. * In Ireland, it is calculated that a typical house built to the Passive House standard instead of the 2002 Building Regulations would consume 85% less energy for space heating and cut space- heating related carbon emissions by 94%.  Comparison with zero energy buildings  A net zero-energy building (ZEB) is a building that over a year does not use more energy than it generates. The first 1979 Zero Energy Design building used passive solar heating and cooling techniques with air-tight construction and super insulation. A few ZEB's fail to fully exploit more affordable conservation technology and all use onsite active renewable energy technologies like photovoltaic to offset the building's primary energy consumption. Passive House and ZEB are complementary synergistic technology approaches, based on the same physics of thermal energy transfer and storage: ZEBs drive the annual energy consumption down to 0 kWh/m2 with help from on- site renewable energy sources and can benefit from materials and methods which are used to meet the Passive House demand constraint of 120 kWh/m2 which will minimize the need for the often costly on-site renewable energy sources. Energy Plus houses are similar to both PassivHaus and ZEB but emphasize the production of more energy per year than they consume, e.g., annual energy performance of ‚àí25 kWh/m2 is an Energy Plus house.  Tropical climate needs  In a tropical climate, it could be helpful for ideal internal conditions to use energy recovery ventilation instead of heat recovery ventilation to reduce the humidity load of ventilation on the mechanical dehumidification system. Although dehumidifiers might be used, heat pump hot water heaters also will act to cool and condense interior humidity (where it can be dumped into drains) and dump the heat into the hot water tank. Passive cooling, solar air conditioning, and other solutions in passive solar building design need to be studied to adapt the Passive house concept for use in more regions of the world. There is a certified Passive House in the hot and humid climate of Lafayette, Louisiana, USA, which uses energy recovery ventilation and an efficient one ton air-conditioner to provide cooling and dehumidification. Solar access is a very important factor in any design of a passive house as it allows the structure to use the solar energy to heat and light the space naturally, and to replace electrical water heaters with solar-energy-based water heaters.

An opening batsman, Bardsley played 41 Tests between 1909 and 1926 and over 200 first-class games for New South Wales. He was Wisden's Cricketer of the Year in 1910. Career A strong domestic season in 1908‚Äì09 ‚Äì 748 runs from 9 innings at an average of 83.11 ‚Äì led to Bardsley's inclusion in the 1909 Australian squad to tour England for the Ashes. After making his debut at Edgbaston, in the city of Birmingham, Bardsley struggled for runs in the Test arena, returning scores of 2, 6, 46, 0, 30, 2, 9 and 35 in his first eight innings. In the Fifth Test, at The Oval, London, however, Bardsley became the first Test cricketer to score a century ‚Äì 100 runs or more ‚Äì in both innings of a single Test match.https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/152630069 The 1910‚Äì11 series against South Africa in Australia was Bardsley's strongest Test series ‚Äì 573 runs at 63.67 in nine innings. The following year, against England, he struggled somewhat and was replaced by the aging Syd Gregory for the Fifth Test. Bardsley returned to Test form in the inaugural Triangular Test series (featuring England, Australia and South Africa in England) ending the series as the leading run-scorer (392 runs at 65.33 from 6 innings). World War I robbed Bardsley of five years of his playing career. By the time Test cricket resumed in 1920, Bardsley was aged in his late-thirties. His form was not the same; in the 21 Tests Bardsley played from 1920 to 1926, he managed only one century. Maintaining his position in the Australian Test squad proved to be difficult, especially considering the fine form of younger opening batsmen Bill Ponsford, Bill Woodfull and Herbie Collins. Despite his Test woes, domestically Bardsley continued to average in the high-30s ‚Äì low-40s for New South Wales throughout much of the early-1920s. Warren Bardsley was 43 years old when he made his last Test tour of England, in 1926. After captain Herbie Collins was felled by illness after the Second Test, the captaincy duties fell on Bardsley, despite his inexperience in that field. Both matches under Bardsley's tenure ended in a draw. He was also the oldest captain to make captaincy debut at the age of 43 years and 216 days. Bardsley played all five Tests in the 1926 series; his undefeated innings of 193 at Lord's in the Second Test would be his highest Test score, and made him the oldest player to score a Test century for Australia.Cricinfo ‚Äì Records ‚Äì Test matches ‚Äì Ninety on debut It also created a record for the highest individual score in a Test Match at Lord's (beaten in 1930 by Bradman's 254).Philip Bailey, Philip Thorne and Peter Wynn-Thomas, Who's Who of Cricketers (London, 1984), p. 66 Personal life After his retirement from Test and first-class cricket, Bardsley would briefly serve as a national selector. He continued to play club cricket for Glebe into his fifties. This longevity was attributed to rigorous exercise, rarely eating meat, and abstaining from alcohol and tobacco.Derriman. Philip. (1987). The Top 100 & the 1st XI: The Top 100 Australian Cricketers and the Best Eleven of All Time.

The last time they met, leaving the funeral of Dr. Rowley Pope, Jack Fingleton asked Bardsley his thoughts: \\"I was just thinking,\\" said the old cricketer, \\"what a great bloke old Doc was. I was thinking of him, and then I just happened to see So-And-So across there, and I thought, Poor old So-And-So. By cripes, he's looking old.

Researchers are not certain when these monuments were built, but the generally accepted range is between the third century B.C. and the sixteenth century AD. Archaeologists have also found pottery sherds, human burials, and some grave goods and metals around the megalithic circles.whc.unesco.org/en/list/1226 \\"Stone Circles of Senegambia 2006 A small collection of these can be found in the British Museum's study collection that was donated by the colonial administrator Sir Richmond Palmer.British Museum Collection They include an iron bracelet and two spears. Among these four main areas, there are approximately 29,000 stones, 17,000 monuments, and 2,000 individual sites. The monuments consist of what were originally upright blocks or pillars (some have collapsed), made of mostly laterite with smooth surfaces. The monoliths are found in circles, double circles, isolated or standing apart from circles (usually to the east) in rows or individually. These stones that are found standing apart outside the circles are called frontal stones. When there are frontal stones in two parallel, connected rows, they are called lyre-stones. The construction of the stone monuments shows evidence of a prosperous and organized society based on the amount of labor required to build such structures. The stones were extracted from laterite quarries using iron tools, although few of these quarries have been identified as directly linked to particular sites. After extracting the stone, identical pillars were made, either cylindrical or polygonal, with averages at two meters high and seven tons. The builders of these megaliths are unknown. Possible candidates are the ancestors of the Jola people or the Wolof but some believe that the Serer people are the builders. This hypothesis comes from the fact that the Serer still use funerary houses like those found at Wanar.Laport et al. 2012, p. 415  World Heritage Sites  The Gambia: * Stone circles of Kerr Batch * Stone circles of Wassu Senegal: * Stone circles of Sine Ngay√®ne * Stone circles of Wanar Wassu dalasi banknote.

Ozanne. During this expedition Ozanne and his team excavated the double circle at Kerbatch.Holl et al. 2007, p. 130 Wanar The area of Wanar is located in the Kaffrine district of Senegal, and is made up of 21 stone circles and one double circle. There are also numerous lyre-stones. In fact, one third of all Senegambian lyre-stones are located at Wanar.Laport et al. 2012, p. 418 All of the monuments found at Wanar seem to mark burials, according to the archaeologists working there. Researchers have also determined that the site was a burial ground first, and the stones were added later for ritual uses. Construction for this area can be narrowed down to between the seventh and fifteenth centuries A.D. A current dating program that has begun is yielding estimates that date the construction of the double circle to between the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.Laport et al. 2012, p. 421 A 2008 excavation was conducted on the double circle at Wanar, and two types of burials were distinguished: simple burials that consisted of large pits sealed with a mound, and more complex burials that were deep with narrow mouths. There was also a presence of perishable materials found in the burials, such as brick and plaster, that suggests the existence of funerary houses built at the time of burial.Laport et al. 2012, p. 411 Stone circles at Wassu. Two types of stones were found at Wanar: tall and slender stones that tended to be cylindric; and shorter, squatter, trapezoidal shaped stones as well. There is a trend found in which frontal lines do not match up with their corresponding circles, which may suggest a chronological order that the monuments were constructed. There are many other clues to be found at Wanar that can tell about what these monuments originally looked like. For instance, the inner ring of the double circle features fallen monoliths that all fan out from the center of the monument. This may suggest, coupled with findings of drystone around the monument, that there used to be drystone beneath the monoliths, and the cylinder made up of the inner ring and drystone was once filled with earth, so that when it collapsed due to outward pressure, the stones all fell outward as well. This theory is not refuted by the fact that the stones of the outer ring fell in all different directions, lacking outward pressure.Laport et al. 2012, p. 417 Pottery shards were also found scattered around the site, buried in different layers of earth. The certain layers in which the pottery was found says that some deposition occurred after the fall of the drystone, but before the collapse of the monoliths. In other words, pottery may have been deposited at this monument after total and/or partial abandonment of the monoliths. Overall, the destruction of this double circle was a slow disintegration over time, as opposed to one large and sudden collapse. Based on all of these findings, researchers have developed a possible model for the funeral activity sequence that took place at Wanar. The sequence has three distinct phases: Phase one includes cutting the graves in the subsoil with funerary rites, such as covering the graves with mounds; phase two is when the standing stones were raised around the mounds; phase three consisted of erecting frontal stones. Phase three may also have been when these monuments became sites of ritual activities and ceramics started getting deposited around them. The creators of this model recognize that other sequences are possible, and the order for the sequence of events at the double circle may have been different as well.Laport et al. 2012, p. 421 Sine Ngayene Sine Ngayene is the largest of the four areas, and home of 52 stone circles, one double circle, and 1102 carved stones. It is generally accepted that the single burials found here predate the multiple burials that are associated with the construction of the stone circles. The site of Sine Ngayene is located just northwest of Sine, Senegal, at the coordinates of 15¬∞32‚Ä≤W, 13¬∞41‚Ä≤N.Holl et al. 2007, p. 131 In 2002, an expedition was launched in the Petit-Bao-Bolong drainage tributary; it was called Sine-Ngayene Archaeological Project (SNAP). The team found iron smelting sites and quarries located close to the monument sites. They also found evidence of hundreds of homes nearby, dating around the time of the monuments, clustered in groups of 2‚Äì5 with remnants of house floors and pottery shards. This evidence suggests the existence of small, linked yet independent communities. Researchers also suggest the possibility that these megalithic cemeteries could have been a focal spot of the cultural landscape and served the purpose of bringing people together. The site of Sine Ngayene has a Y-shaped central axis with a double circle (called Diallombere) located at the center of the three branches. Originally this site was surrounded by hundreds of tumuli (burial mounds) that leveled over time through erosion.Holl et al. 2007, p. 128 Evidence suggests that the burials occurred first with the stones being erected later, exclusively for the burials. Often frontal stones were erected on the East side of the stone circles. Archaeologists at Sine Ngayene have constructed a timeline with four distinct, successive cycles. These cycles are based on materials buried in successive layers and the monument construction chronology of the double circle at the center of the site. The approximate date range assigned to this timeline ranges from 700 A.D. to 1350 A.D.Holl et al. 2007, p. 127) =Cycle One= Materials for the first cycle are located at approximately 1.6-2.0 meters below the surface and are dated between 700 and 800 A.D. The main finding for this cycle was a large, oblong-shaped pit with a concentration of human remains in the form of a secondary burial. The remains were found with five iron spearheads and a copper bracelet. The pit was backfilled and capped with a mound overlaid with scattered laterite blocks. Researchers estimate that the outer circle of stones was built after the initial burial, and two large frontal stones were added.Holl et al. 2007, p. 136 =Cycle Two= The layers analyzed for the second cycle are located at approximately 1.0-1.6 meters below the surface and date between 800 and 900 A.D. For this layer, another oblong-shaped burial pit was discovered.Holl et al. 2007, p. 138 However, this burial area consisted of more selective human bones, mostly long bones, and skulls, buried in discrete episodes. These were also linked to secondary burials. Overall there were ten skulls, thirty long bones, and one iron spearhead found.Holl et al. 2007, p. 140 =Cycle Three= Cycle three encompassed material between 0.5 and 1.0 meter below the surface, and dates to between 900 and 1000 A.D. This time period is when the inner circle of monoliths is speculated to have been built. Within this layer, a laterite slab was also discovered, which may have been used as a sacrificial table. The majority of the findings, however, consisted of clay sherds, selected bones (long bones and skulls), and human teeth deposited with pottery.Holl et al. 2007, p. 143 It is during this time in which the monument evolved from a selective burial ground, to a broader ritual place, becoming more of a \\"public monument\\". There was a shift from burials to offerings during this cycle.Holl et al. 2007, p. 144 =Cycle Four= This cycle contains material located from the surface to approximately 0.5 meters below the surface, and is dated from anywhere between 1235 and 1427 A.D. During this period there seems to be a low intensity use of the monument, and some things recovered from this layer may be accidental re-depositions. The majority of findings from this zone were small bone fragments buried with laterite blocks, located primarily in the inner circle of the monument. There were also some sherds found in one spot, and a secondary burial pit containing: 70 bones, seven turquoise beads, and two copper rings. This may suggest long-distance trade among the people who used the monuments. Overall, cycle four contained a mixture of offerings and secondary burials.Holl et al. 2007, p. 146  Additional stone circles in Senegambia  * Stone circles of Dialla Kouna * Stone circles of Farafenni * Stone circles of Garan * Stone circles of Kabakoto * Stone circles of Kau-ur * Stone circles of Kaymor * Stone circles of Kerr Jabel * Stone circles of Keur Bakary * Stone circles of Keur Bamba * Stone circles of Keur Katim Diama * Stone circles of Kuntaur Fulla Kunda * Stone circles of Lamin Koto' * Stone circles of M√©dina Sabak * Stone circles of Niani Maru * Stone circles of Nioro Kunda * Stone circles of N'jai Kunda * Stone circles of Palan Mandika * Stone circles of Payoma * Stone circles of Wind√© Walo See also *Cekeen Tumulus *History of Senegal *History of the Gambia Notes External links  * The Senegambian Megaliths Project, http://www.mae.u-paris10.fr/prehistoire/IMG/pdf/Senegambian_Megaliths_Project.pdf * The Wassu Stone Circles on Google Street View, https://goo.gl/maps/BTQj37cY2UgHBKcv7 (Published: October 2019) References *\\"Stone Circles of Senegambia\\", 2006.

At the time of his retirement, he had played a world-record 58 Test matches during a career spanning 1890 to 1912. A right-handed batsman, he was also a renowned fielder, particularly at cover point. Biography Gregory was born at Moore Park, New South Wales, not far from the present site of the Sydney Cricket Ground, attending Sydney Boys High School.Australian Sporting Representatives. shsobu.org.au The Gregorys were Australia's first cricketing dynasty. Syd's father Ned Gregory was one of the eleven Australians selected to play in a match against England at the MCG in 1877 ‚Äì a match later designated as the first-ever Test. Ned Gregory served as curator at the SCG, occupying this position at the time of the birth of Syd. Syd Gregory's uncle Dave was Australia's first Test cricket captain, and his nephew Jack was the nation's most feared fast bowler of the 1920s. Syd Gregory made his first- class debut for New South Wales in the season of 1889‚Äì90. Six months later, he was selected to tour England with the Australian team. Altogether, Gregory toured England a further seven times ‚Äì in 1893, 1896, 1899, 1902, 1905, 1909 and finally in 1912 ‚Äì and South Africa once (1902). He is one of only three cricketers to have batted in every position of the batting order, from one to eleven, in his Test career. Syd Gregory scored Australia's first double hundred in a Test in Australia in 1894‚Äì95 but his 201 was not enough to save his team from a remarkable defeat. They made England follow on after amassing 586 but the visitors then made 437 and bowled Australia out for 166 to pull off an astonishing victory by 10 runs. It was the first time a Test had been won after following on and remained the only occurrence until the famous Headingley Test in 1981. In 1912, six of Australia's leading cricketers ‚Äì including captain Clem Hill ‚Äì refused to tour England for the inaugural Triangular Test series. A largely untried team, led by Gregory, was selected in its place. Although Australia lost only one of its six Tests, the cricket was overshadowed by the Australian team's poor behaviour. Gregory was heavily criticised for his inability to control the off-field antics of members of his team. Away from cricket, Gregory was initially employed by the postal service before opening a \\"men's shop\\" ‚Äì containing a tobacconist, barber and sporting store among others ‚Äì with two business partners in Sydney's King Street in the mid-1890s. In 1896, he married a woman named Maria Sullivan. When his business failed in 1902, Gregory was forced to take a clerical job at the Water Board. Syd Gregory died on 1 August 1929 at Randwick, an eastern suburb of Sydney. He was 59. Career highlights *Test debut: vs. England at Lord's, London, 21‚Äì23 July 1890. *Final Test: vs. England at The Oval, London, 19‚Äì22 August 1912. *Highest Test score: 201 vs. England at the Sydney Cricket Ground, 14‚Äì20 December 1894. This was the first instance in which a double-century was scored in a Test on an Australian cricket ground. *Captaincy record: Gregory captained Australia six times, winning two and losing one (three drawn). *Syd Gregory was one of Wisden's five Cricketers of the Year in 1897. *Syd Gregory has played the most Test matches by a non-Englishman at Lord's. Assessment In 1948 the New Zealander Dan Reese made this assessment of Gregory as a cover-point: > From Vernon Royle to Hobbs, England has had many fine cover-points, but none > to equal Australia's Syd.

Islam in Switzerland has mostly arrived via immigration since the late 20th century. Numbering below 1% of total population in 1980, the fraction of Muslims in the population of permanent residents in Switzerland has quintupled in thirty years, estimated at just above 5% as of 2013. The Federal Statistical Office reported the religious demographics as of 2013 as follows (based on the resident population older than 15 years): total population of Muslims aged 15 or older: 341,572 (confidence interval ¬±1.8%, i.e. ¬±6150, based on a total (100%) of 6,744,794 registered resident population above 15 years). This corresponds to 5.1%¬±0.1% of total (adult) population. A majority is from Former Yugoslavia (estimated at 56% as of 2010, most of them from Kosovo); an additional 20% (2010 estimate) is from Turkey. This is due to the fact that in the 1960s and 1970s Switzerland encouraged young men from Yugoslavia and Turkey to come as guest workers. Initially these young men were only planning on staying in Switzerland temporarily, however, revised Swiss immigration laws in the 1970s permitted family regrouping. Consequently, these men ended up staying in Switzerland as these new laws allowed the wives and children of these young men into the country. Since this time period, most of the Muslim immigration to Switzerland stems from asylum seekers arriving primarily from Eastern Europe. The vast majority of Muslims in Switzerland adhere to the Sunni branch.http://www.pewforum.org/files/2009/10/Muslimpopulation.pdf Some famous Muslims of Switzerland include Tariq Ramadan, Frithjof Schuon, Titus Burckhardt, Xherdan Shaqiri and Isabelle Eberhardt. Demographics The largest concentration of Muslim population is in the German speaking Swiss plateau. The cantons with more than 5% Muslim population are: *8.17% Basel- Stadt *7.72% Glarus *7.63% Solothurn *7.54% St. Gallen *7.14% Aargau *7.02% Schaffhausen *6.51% Thurgau *6.49% Z√ºrich *6.24% Geneva *5.61% Basel-Landschaft *5.22% Vaud Geneva is the only non-German-speaking canton where the Muslim population (6.24%) is slightly above the average (5.40%). Another remarkable demographic feature in comparison to other European countries is the relatively equal distribution throughout the countryIslam in Switzerland (compare Islam in the United Kingdom). No administrative unit has more than 8.55% of Muslim population, and no town or village more than 16.8%. The lowest percentage of Muslims in a canton is 1.82% (the Italian-speaking Ticino). 88.3% of Muslims in Switzerland are foreigners (56.4% from former Yugoslavia, mostly Bosniaks, and Albanians from Kosovo), 20.2% from Turkey and 6% from Africa (3.4% from North Africa). 10,000 of the 400,000 Muslims could be converts. History In the 10th century, Arabs and Amazighs from their Mediterranean Fraxinet base settled in the Valais for a few decades. They occupied the Great St. Bernard Pass and even managed to reach as far as St. Gallen to the north and Raetia in the east.Wenner, M. (1980). \\"The Arab/Muslim Presence in Medieval Central Europe.\\" International Journal of Middle East Studies, Vol.12 No.(1), 59-79. doi:10.1017/S0020743800027136 Islam was virtually absent from Switzerland until the 20th century. It appeared with the beginning of significant immigration to Europe, after World War II. A first mosque was built in Z√ºrich in 1963 by the Ahmadiyya community. Muslim presence during the 1950s and 1960s was mostly due to the presence of international diplomats and rich Saudi tourists in Geneva. Substantial Muslim immigration began in the 1970s, and accelerated dramatically over the 1980s to 1990s. In 1980, there were 56,600 Muslims in Switzerland (0.9% of total population). This ratio quintupled over the following thirty years, notably due to the immigration from Former Yugoslavia during the 1990s Yugoslav War. While the Muslim demographics is still growing rapidly, the rate of growth has decreased after the early 1990s. The growth rate corresponded to a factor of 2.7 over the 1980s (10% per annum), a factor of 2.0 over the 1990s (7% p.a.), and a factor of about 1.6 over the 2000s (5% p.a.).Wohnbev√∂lkerung nach Religion (bfs.admin.ch) The burka was outlawed in the canton of Ticino after a citizen initiative to hold a referendum. With 65% in favour of a ban and it was ruled that the ban was constitutional, the ban took effect in July 2016. Those who violate the law face a fine of up to CHF 10,000. One of the primary figures behind this burka ban is now attempting to ban Muslims from praying in public. In 2017, an Imam was charged for inciting violence by calling a sermon for Muslims who refused to pray to be burned alive. In 2018, a Muslim couple was denied citizenship when they refused to answer questions from members of the Lausanne naturalisation board if they were asked by people of the opposite sex. Their behaviour was found to disrespect a fundamental principle of the Swiss constitution, equality between men and women. In September 2018, a ban on face-covering veils was approved with a 67% vote in favour in the canton of St Gallen. The largest Islamic community organisation in Switzerland, the Islamic Central Council, recommended that Muslim women continue to cover their faces. Organizations Swiss Muslim organizations begin to form in the 1980s. An umbrella organization (GIOS, Gemeinschaft islamischer Organisationen der Schweiz) was formed in Z√ºrich in 1989. Numerous organizations were formed during the 1990s to 2000s, including * 1994 Organisation Muslime und Musliminnen der Schweiz * 1995 Vereinigung Islamischer Organisationen Z√ºrich (VIOZ), Zurich * 1997 Basler Muslim Kommission, Basle * 2000 Koordination Islamischer Organisationen Schweiz (KIOS), Berne * 2002 Vereinigung islamischer Organisationen des Kantons Luzern (VIOKL), Lucerne * 2003 Dachverband islamischer Gemeinden der Ostschweiz und des F√ºrstentums Liechtenstein * 2006 F√∂deration Islamischer Dachorganisationen in der Schweiz (FIDS) * 2009 Islamic Central Council of Switzerland (ICCS; German Islamischer Zentralrat Schweiz IZRS), Berne. IZRS is a comparatively minor organisation (with an estimated 960 members in 2010) but has a disproportionate media presence because of its radical Salafist orientation and because a disproportionate number of its members (an estimated 10%) are native Swiss converts.Katia Murmann, Schweiz am Sonntag, 17 April 2010. Mosques Mosque of the Turkish cultural association in Wangen bei Olten. It is estimated that there are 260 mosques and prayer rooms with connected services in Switzerland. Switzerland has the second lowest mosques per Muslim inhabitant, with about one mosque to every 4000 Muslims in Switzerland. There are two Swiss mosques which predate 1980 and the rapid increase of immigration of Muslims from the Balkans and Turkey over the following decades. Today, there are numerous mosques and prayer rooms across the country, predominantly in the urban parts of the Swiss plateau.International Religious Freedom Report 2006 Switzerland In 2007 the Bern city council rejected plans to build one of the largest Islamic cultural centers in Europe.Bern city says no to Islamic cultural centre, Swissinfo, June 1, 2007 Four Swiss mosques have minarets, there is a mosque in Zurich, a mosque in Geneva, a mosque in Winterthur, a mosque in Wangen bei Olten. The latter was erected in 2009 following several years of political and legal disputes. In the wake of the Wangen minaret controversy, a popular initiative was passed with 57.5% of the popular vote in November 2009, introducing a ban on the construction of new minarets. The four existing minarets are not affected by the ban.Rightwingers want nationwide vote on minarets, Swissinfo, May 3, 2007Swiss Referendum Stirs a Debate About Islam. Wall Street Journal Europe, 06 November 2009 Although the Swiss People's Party received the popular vote, their campaign was particularly shocked by the conversion to Islam of Daniel Streich, a council member within the party. The campaign also prompted concerns from other countries of how the Swiss electorate is increasingly shifting towards the right.  Attitudes  In a 2018 survey conducted by Switzerland's Federal Statistics Office, 29% of Swiss respondents said they mistrusted Islam and 11% said they mistrusted Islamic followers. Comparatively, in 2016, 14% of Swiss respondents said that they mistrusted Islamic followers.

He captained the Australian team in ten Tests, winning five and losing five. A prolific run scorer, Hill scored 3,412 runs in Test cricket‚Äîa world record at the time of his retirement‚Äîat an average of 39.21 per innings, including seven centuries. In 1902, Hill was the first batsman to make 1,000 Test runs in a calendar year, a feat that would not be repeated for 45 years. His innings of 365 scored against New South Wales for South Australia in 1900‚Äì01 was a Sheffield Shield record for 27 years. The South Australian Cricket Association named a grandstand at the Adelaide Oval in his honour in 2003 and he was inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame in 2005. A short and stocky left-handed batsman, Hill had a crouched, somewhat awkward stance. He gripped the bat low on the handle, playing with a strong bottom hand. His batting style was nonetheless attractive and effective and he was especially strong on the leg side and when cutting. Able to score quickly when required, he was also recognised for his patience and strong defence. Hill normally batted at No. 3 and, along with his contemporary Victor Trumper, he was a mainstay of the Australian batting line-up in the early years of the 20th century. Hill had a strong throwing arm and was an excellent outfielder. He was a popular team-mate and captain, respected for his directness, honesty and cheerfulness. He played his first first-class cricket match for South Australia while still a schoolboy, aged 16. By the time he was 19, he had been included in the Australian team touring England in 1896, where he made his Test match d√©but. At the Melbourne Cricket Ground two years later, Hill scored 188; his maiden Test century and still the highest score in Ashes Tests by a player under 21. He was named one of Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1899, despite missing half the English season due to illness. In the 1901‚Äì02 season, Hill was dismissed in consecutive innings for 99, 98 and 97. In total he was dismissed between 90 and 99 five times in Test cricket. In 1903‚Äì04, Hill was at the centre of a riot at the Sydney Cricket Ground after he was adjudged run out in a Test match against England. With Roger Hartigan he still holds the Australian Test record partnership for the eighth wicket‚Äî243, made against England at the Adelaide Oval in 1907‚Äì08. Hill had a strained relationship with Australian cricket authorities. He turned down an invitation to tour England in 1909 due to his unhappiness with the contract terms offered. Despite this, he was appointed Test captain in 1910‚Äì11 for the series against South Africa. His Test cricket career ended in controversy after he was involved in a brawl with cricket administrator and fellow Test selector Peter McAlister in 1912. He was one of the \\"Big Six\\", a group of leading Australian cricketers who boycotted the 1912 Triangular Tournament in England when the players were stripped of the right to appoint the tour manager. The boycott effectively ended his Test career. After retiring from cricket, Hill worked in the horse racing industry as a stipendiary steward and later as a handicapper for races including the Caulfield Cup. Hill died in 1945 aged 68 when thrown from a tram in Melbourne in a traffic accident. Early life Hill was born on 18 March 1877 in Adelaide, South Australia, to Henry John Hill (known as John) and his wife Rebecca, n√©e Saunders, and grandson of Henry Hill MHA. Clem was one of eight sons and eight daughters in a family that was heavily involved in cricket. His father scored a century (102 not out) for North Adelaide against the touring Kent County Cricket Club, reportedly the first century scored at the Adelaide Oval.Pollard (1988), pp. 530‚Äì533. Six other brothers played for South Australia and in 1912‚Äì13 there were several instances of three Hill brothers in the same representative team. Clem's father was prominent in the Methodist Church and sent Clem to be educated at Prince Alfred College, the local Methodist school. \\"Inter-collegiate\\" matches, the annual fixtures against rivals St Peter's College, were fiercely contested. Hill played his first inter-collegiate match at the age of 13, keeping wicket and batting at number ten. His hands suffered from keeping wicket to the fast bowling of future Test team-mate Ernie Jones, leading to a decision to concentrate on batting.Robinson, pp. 116‚Äì126. At 16, he scored 360 in the inter-collegiate match, a schoolboy record, bettering the mark made earlier by Joe Darling. Despite this, a school sportsmaster threatened to leave him out of the School XI (cricket team) if he continued to play the risky hook shot. Hill made his first-class cricket d√©but in March 1893 while still a schoolboy, just nine days past his 16th birthday. Included in the South Australian team to play Western Australia at the Adelaide Oval, he failed to score a run; he was dismissed for a duck in the first innings and was 0 not out in the second as South Australia won by 10 wickets. In the 1894‚Äì95 season, at 17 years of age, he played the touring English team led by A.E. Stoddart, scoring 20 in his only innings in the match. Later the same season, Hill became a regular member of the South Australian team, making his Sheffield Shield debut against Victoria. Batting at number nine, he scored only 21 but the manner in which he made them saw the Australian Test wicket-keeper Jack Blackham declare the discovery of another great batsman. The English team returned to the Adelaide Oval and this time Hill scored his maiden first-class century, 150 not out, against quality bowlers including Tom Richardson and Bobby Peel. So good was the quality of Hill's batting that when he reached his century a cab driver spectator, sitting on his cab, \\"cheered end clapped so much [he] fell through the roof of the vehicle\\".Rufus, \\"Out among the People\\", The Advertiser, 16 January 1933, p. 10. In his first season of regular first-class cricket, Hill scored 335 runs in nine innings at an average of 47.85. Hill was also a talented Australian rules footballer and played for the South Adelaide Football Club during the 1890s and early 1900s. Test cricket=Selection and early career Hill topped the averages for South Australia in the 1895‚Äì96 season, scoring 371 runs in seven innings. An Australian team to tour England in 1896 was selected towards the end of the season and Hill was not included. A disappointed Hill responded by scoring 206 against New South Wales, who were captained by an Australian selector, Tom Garrett. Experienced cricket watchers were impressed with Hill's ability at such a young age to control the strike, scoring 154 from his side's last 197 runs. Following this performance, public demand saw the selectors draft the 19-year-old Hill into the touring squad. Hill was one of four batsmen touring England for the first time; Joe Darling, Frank Iredale and Harry Donnan were the others. All four scored more than 1,000 runs for the tour with Hill scoring 1,196 runs at an average of 27.81.Australia in England 1896. CricketArchive. Retrieved on 21 December 2008. According to Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, Hill \\"was a brilliant success\\" and his batting on good wickets during the tour was \\"first rate\\". Hill made his Test d√©but in the First Test at Lord's. Australia collapsed in the first innings to be all out for 53 with Hill bowled by George Lohmann for one. England made 292 runs in reply but the second innings saw an Australian fightback. The captain, Harry Trott (143), was partnered by Syd Gregory (103) to help Australia to a score of 347, setting England 109 runs to win. Hill failed again scoring only five, bowled this time by Jack Hearne. Rain made England's task a little more difficult but they were able to make the runs for the loss of only four wickets. Hill played in the remaining two Tests, but managed to score only 30 runs in the series. Australia lost the series and the Ashes by two Tests to one. The next Ashes series was held in 1897‚Äì98 with Stoddart again assembling an English team to tour Australia. The team included players such as K.S. Ranjitsinhji and George Hirst. The touring team's first match on arrival was against South Australia and Hill batted well, scoring exactly 200. The First Test was played in Sydney and a minor controversy ensued when officials abandoned the first day's play due to earlier heavy rain without consulting the two captains. The delay did not seem to affect the English who batted first and scored 551, including centuries by Ranjitsinhji and Archie MacLaren. The Australians were forced to follow-on after making 237. Batting again, Hill scored 96 but England managed to win the match by nine wickets. The Second Test was played in Melbourne and Australia fought back, winning by an innings and 55 runs with Hill scoring 58. Another innings victory in the Third Test in Adelaide saw Australia leading the series two Tests to one. Hill in the early 1900s The teams returned to Melbourne for the Fourth Test. England started the match brilliantly, reducing Australia to 6/58See scoring (cricket) for an explanation of cricket score formats. This score and all others in the article follow the Australian format of wickets fallen followed by runs made. on a pitch that assisted the bowlers. Hill, aged just 20, was watching at the non-striker's end as the wickets fell. Hugh Trumble came to join him and together they began to rescue the Australian innings. When Hill reached his maiden Test century, he had scored all but 42 of his side's runs. Hill played balls pitched outside leg stump particularly well and drove beautifully throughout the innings.Frith, p. 59. At the tea interval, Hill, feeling refreshed, mentioned to Trumble that he thought he would \\"have a go at them now\\". The experienced Trumble cautioned Hill, replying \\"You young devil, you have to stop there. Go along as you have been doing.\\" Hill and Trumble made 165 runs batting together, still a record for a seventh wicket partnership in Ashes Tests. Hill was 182 not out at the end of the day's play, the highest first-day innings against England in Australia, and leaving the ground was greeted by a barrage of photographers. After a rest day, Hill added only six more runs before being dismissed at last by Hearne. His innings remains the highest in Ashes Tests by a player under 21. Batting for 294 minutes he gave only the one chance at dismissal. The journalist and former Test player Tom Horan wrote \\"Hill's innings will be talked of when the smallest boy who saw it will be white with the snows of time.\\" Australia won the Test by 8 wickets to recover the Ashes. That summer, Hill scored 1,196 runs in 19 innings including five centuries, the first Australian to score 1,000 runs in a home season. Consolidation During the Australian team's tour of England in 1899, Hill required surgery to remove a growth in his nose. The after-effects of the operation were more serious than expected; Hill lost an alarming amount of weight and strength and missed around half of the tour. Before this, Hill was recognised by Wisden Cricketers' Almanack as the best of the Australian batsmen that English summer. He scored 301 runs in three Tests at an average of 60.20, and was named as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year. His best performance of the series was in the Second Test at Lord's. Hill scored 135, sharing a partnership of 82 with Victor Trumper, who was playing only his second Test match. Trumper went on to score 135 not out. Hill, who was dropped by Ranjitsinhji fielding at slip when he had made 119, batted for 4 hours and hit 17 boundaries. Australia won the Test, the only one to have a definite result, by 10 wickets and retained the Ashes.Wynne-Thomas, pp. 229‚Äì230. Hill standing in front of the Adelaide Oval scoreboard after scoring 365 against New South Wales in 1900‚Äì01 In 1900‚Äì01, Hill made a then record Sheffield Shield score for South Australia against New South Wales at the Adelaide Oval. He batted for 8 hours and 35 minutes for 365, including 35 boundaries. The record stood for 27 years until beaten by Bill Ponsford. Hill averaged more than 100 runs for the season. England returned to contest the Ashes in 1901‚Äì02, under the captaincy of Archie MacLaren. The English team was weakened by the unavailability of players such as Ranjitsinhji, Hirst, C.B. Fry and Wilfred Rhodes. The surprise selection was Sydney Barnes, who had played most of his cricket in the Lancashire League.Wynne-Thomas, pp. 51‚Äì52. Repeating the result of the series three years earlier, Australia lost the First Test but won the next four comfortably to retain the Ashes. Hill was the leading run scorer in the series, with 521 runs including 99, 98 and 97 in successive innings. He is still the only person to achieve this most unusual feat.Martin-Jenkins, pp. 186‚Äì187. Hill was the victim of bad luck during this sequence of scores between 90 and 99. At Melbourne during the New Years Test he scored 99; the first time a batsman was dismissed one run short of a century in Test cricket.Meher-Homji, p. 27. In the first innings in the next Test in Adelaide, having scored 98, Hill was caught by Johnny Tyldesley who was standing on the bicycle track surrounding the oval. Tyldesley attempted to call Hill back but Hill declined, saying the captains had agreed that the fence was the boundary, not the track. Under modern laws, he would have been not out and the shot would count as six runs, allowing him his century. In the second innings, Hill's poor luck continued. He chopped down on a ball when 97 and then, to his horror, saw the ball rolling back towards his stumps. He attempted to hit the ball away from the stumps but accidentally knocked the leg bail and was out, bowled. The English writer, Simon Wilde, has described this sequence as an \\"unparalleled spell of nonagenarians' neurosis\\". Hill visited England for a third time in 1902 with the Australian team who won their fourth successive Test series. In the process the Australians \\"beat the records of all their predecessors in the country\\" by losing only two of 39 matches during the tour. For the second time, Hill scored more than 1,000 runs in an English summer; 1,534 at an average of 31.95 including four centuries. Rain affected the first two Test matches at Edgbaston and Lord's and both teams moved to Sheffield without a win. The Third Test, the only Test match played at Bramall Lane, saw Hill play one of his finest innings on a poorly prepared pitch that made batting difficult.Roebuck, pp. 79‚Äì80. Australia batted first and could only score 194, Barnes taking 6 wickets for 49 runs. In return Monty Noble and Jack Saunders bowled England out for 145 and Australia led by 49 runs on the first innings. When Reggie Duff was dismissed in the second innings, Hill joined Trumper at the wicket. The pair scored 60 runs in half an hour before Trumper was out, caught by the wicket-keeper. He was followed quickly by the captain, Darling, out for a duck. Syd Gregory was the next batsman and with Hill added 107 runs in only 67 minutes. In semi-darkness and facing fast and accurate bowling on a poor pitch, Hill pushed on to reach his century after 115 minutes of batting. He had given two difficult chances, one at slip when 74 and in the outfield at 77 before he was caught by MacLaren from the bowling of Jackson for 119. Australia won the Test by 143 runs. The final two Tests were thrillers. Australia won the Fourth Test at Old Trafford by a mere three runs with Trumble taking ten wickets for the match. England won the Fifth and final Test at The Oval by one wicket. Chasing 263, England were 5/48 when Gilbert Jessop began an extraordinary display of hitting, scoring a century in only 75 minutes to help England to victory.Roebuck, pp. 133‚Äì134. Of Hill's form during the tour, Wisden Cricketers' Almanack said \\"Clement Hill played many fine innings, his best performance being in the Test match at Sheffield, but, even allowing for the soft wickets, I do not think he was so great a batsman as in 1899.\\" On the return trip to Australia, the touring team stopped in South Africa to play three Tests, the first Tests between the two nations. Hill was the most successful Australian batsman in the series, scoring 327 runs at an average of 81.75. In the First Test he made 145 when Australia was in trouble after following-on, an innings described in Wisden as \\"marred by very few mistakes\\". In the Third Test, Hill batted through much of the Australian first innings to make 91 not out. Australia won the Test by ten wickets and the series two Tests to nil. Establishment Hill attempts to stop a pitch invading dog in the Fourth Test in Melbourne in 1908. For the first time under the auspices of the Marylebone Cricket Club, an English team travelled to Australia for the 1903‚Äì04 season to contest the Ashes. Contrary to expectations before the tour, the English won the series and the Ashes three Tests to two. Hill trailed Trumper and Noble in the series averages, making 276 runs at 27.60 without ever getting to 100 in an innings. In the First Test, Hill was at the centre of what Wisden described as a \\"very regrettable and indeed disgraceful [crowd] demonstration\\". Batting with Trumper, Hill had run well past the stumps at the bowler's end for a fourth run. The English return gave the Australian pair an opportunity for an overthrow. Hill had to run the entire length of the pitch. Albert Relf at mid- on gathered and threw to the wicket-keeper, Dick Lilley who removed the bails and appealed for the run out. Umpire Bob Crockett gave Hill out. Hill could not believe the decision as the ball had passed behind him when he slid his bat to make his ground. The crowd were also convinced that Hill was not out and began to hoot, chanting \\"Crock!, Crock!, Crock!\\" Bottles were thrown onto the surrounding cycle track and the English captain Plum Warner threatened to take his team from the ground. At the end of the day, Crockett required a police escort when leaving the ground. Hill's best performance of the series was at his home town, Adelaide, in the Third Test. Hill scored 88 before being dismissed by Ted Arnold, caught by the wicket-keeper. Australia won the Test by 216 runs. Hill toured England for the last time with the 1905 Australian team. The Test series was dominated by what was seen as uninspired cricket with England retaining the Ashes two Tests to nil.Wynne-Thomas, pp. 237‚Äì238. The Australian batting suffered from a lack of steadiness and Hill was one of the Australians criticised by Wisden that season; \\"[Hill] would certainly have met with more consistent success if he had retained his old self-control. He was somewhat indiscriminate in hitting at the off-ball, and many a time his impatience cost him his wicket.\\" However Wisden praised his fielding, saying \\"Trumper, Hill, and Hopkins did any amount of fine work in the deep field\\". The Australians recovered the Ashes from the 1907‚Äì08 English team, winning the series four Tests to one. England were hit by the loss of their captain, Arthur Jones who contracted an illness that threatened to develop into pneumonia, causing him to miss the first three Tests. Hill, batting with team- mate Roger Hartigan playing his first Test match, set a record in the Third Test in Adelaide. Suffering from influenza and unable to field in the English first innings, Hill joined Hartigan at the fall of the seventh wicket. During his innings, Hill vomited beside the pitch and had to quickly leave the field several times. The pair managed to bat on and take the match into a fourth day. Hartigan, whose leave from work had expired, was relieved to receive a telegram from his employer: \\"Stay as long as you are making runs.\\" When Hartigan was dismissed for 116, the pair had together made 243 for the eighth wicket‚Äîstill an Australian Test record. With Sammy Carter, Hill continued before finally dismissed by Jack Crawford for 160, after 5 hours and 19 minutes of batting. At the end of his innings Hill was close to collapse but his efforts assisted his team defeat the English by 245 runs. Captain Australia were due to tour England to contest the Ashes in 1909. Hill, along with other senior players, was fighting against a proposal to move the management of international tours away from the players to the new Australian Board of Control for International Cricket Matches. Hill by now was a team selector and strongly opposed the selection in the team of 40-year-old Peter McAlister, who Hill claimed \\"was past his best\\" and \\"not suited to English conditions\\".Haigh, p. 169. McAlister was also a member of the selection panel and was able to secure a majority for his selection. Hill accused his fellow selectors of conspiracy and said he had \\"decided to wash his hands of the affair\\" and that \\"he did not consider that the best men had been chosen\\". Hill's relationship with McAlister would remain fractious. Hill was also a delegate on the Board of Control, representing the South Australian Cricket Association (SACA). At the Board meeting in February 1909 to set the terms to be offered to the players selected for the tour, the SACA delegates were outvoted on every point.Haigh, p. 170. Hill declined to accept the terms offered. Since his marriage in 1905, Hill had spent considerable time away from his wife with his commitments during two Test series against England and this may have also influenced his decision not to tour. Hill (centre, third from left) was captain of the 1911‚Äì12 Australian team. When Hill returned to the Test team it was as captain for a series against the visiting South Africa national cricket team in 1910‚Äì11. The South Africans, led by Aubrey Faulkner, had a novel bowling attack consisting of several googly bowlers, such as Bert Vogler, Reggie Schwarz and Faulkner himself and the slow left-arm wrist-spin bowler Charlie \\"Buck\\" Llewellyn. The South Africans started the tour well, defeating a South Australian team unable to handle the unusual bowling approach.Pollard (1988), pp. 987‚Äì988. Hill, after consulting with other players, settled on a strategy of hitting the bowlers off their length with aggressive batting. Hill showed the way in the First Test at Sydney, scoring his first 100 runs in 98 minutes. In a partnership with Warren Bardsley, the pair scored 224 runs in only two hours. After just 3 hours and 20 minutes at the crease, he was dismissed for 191; his highest Test score. Australia won the Test by an innings and 114 runs. Australia won the Second Test in Melbourne after bowling the South Africans out for 80 in their second innings, but the South Africans fought back to win the Third Test in Adelaide by 38 runs. Australia won the Fourth Test by 508 runs after being sent in to bat by South Africa, who hoped to trap them on a rain-affected wicket. The Australians managed to end the first day's play at 8/317 to avoid the trap and win the Test. In the second innings, Hill hit another century (100) in only 100 minutes, with Wisden noting that he \\"play[ed] especially well\\". Australia won the final Test and the series four Tests to one. Brawl and boycott Hill's Test career ended in controversy amid another dispute with the Board of Control. He was once again appointed captain of the Australian team against an English side captained by Johnny Douglas in 1911‚Äì12. The English team included bowlers of the calibre of Barnes and Frank Foster and, after losing the first Test in Sydney, won all four remaining Tests to secure the Ashes. Hill had a lean season with the bat, managing 274 runs at an average of 27.40. The England bowlers were clearly superior to the Australian batsmen; Trumper was the only Australian to score a century during the Tests.Wynne-Thomas, pp. 66‚Äì68. While this series took place, the Board of Control made plans to usurp the commonly accepted right of the players to appoint the team manager when touring England. In response, a group of senior players, including Hill, threatened to withdraw from the next tour, to take place in 1912, unless their choice, Frank Laver, was appointed.Haigh, pp. 215‚Äì217. Matters came to a head when Hill sent a telegram to fellow selector, Peter McAlister, urging the inclusion of the New South Wales all-rounder Charlie Macartney in the team for the Fourth Test in Melbourne. The reply from McAlister‚Äîa member of the Board of Control who still bore some animosity towards Hill from past commentsSee above '\\"strongly opposed the selection in the team of 40 year old Peter McAlister, who he claimed \\"was past his best\\" and \\"not suited to English conditions\\"'‚Äîto Hill's request was \\"... Still opposed to Macartney's inclusion. If Iredale (another selector) agrees with you as to Macartney's inclusion, I favour yourself standing down not Minnett.\\" Hill saw the offer to remove himself from the team as sore provocation and his team-mates scorned the suggestion. Australia lost the Third Test by seven wickets. Macartney wrote later, \\"Persistent ill-feeling seriously affected the morale of the side.\\" At a meeting held after the Test, the Board of Control rejected the players' petition and declared that the manager would be appointed by the Board alone. At a \\"special meeting\\" two weeks later, the Board appointed George Crouch from Queensland to the position of tour manager. The following day, 3 February 1912, the selection committee met in Sydney to decide the team for the Fourth Test. It was the first time Hill and McAlister had met since the exchange of telegrams. The pair exchanged insults with McAlister sharply criticising Hill's captaincy. Hill retorted, \\"In England, Armstrong wouldn't play under you. Did you ever win any except second rate games?\\" McAlister replied, \\"I am a better captain than Trumper, Armstrong and yourself put together. You are the worst captain I have ever seen.\\" Hill then warned McAlister to stop insulting him but McAlister repeated the remark. Losing control, Hill struck McAlister a blow across the face. The two then grappled for around ten minutes. Blood was drawn, staining their clothes and splashing on the other men present, Iredale and secretary Sydney Smith. At one stage, fearing that one or both combatants would fall through the window and onto the street, Smith grabbed hold of Hill's coat-tails. The fight ended with a bloody McAlister lying on the floor and Hill, unmarked, standing over him. Hill told Smith he could no longer work with McAlister. Smith then asked Hill to put his resignation in writing and the Board accepted it that evening. The crowds at the Melbourne and Sydney Tests gave Hill three cheers when he arrived at the wicket. When Hill reached the batting crease in his last Test at Sydney, the umpire Bob Crockett said \\"there were tears in his eyes\\".Haigh, pp. 224‚Äì225. An in camera investigation into the fracas took place; the Board's only comment on the meeting was to report that it had been \\"satisfactorily settled\\". Hill was then offered an invitation to take part in the 1912 Triangular Tournament in England. Hill declined the invitation, along with Warwick Armstrong, Trumper, Carter, Noble and Vernon Ransford, who collectively became known as the \\"Big Six\\". He never played Test cricket again. Retirement and legacy An innings-by-innings breakdown of Hill's Test match batting career, showing runs scored (red bars) and the average of the last ten innings (blue line). The blue dots indicate an innings where he was not dismissed. At the age of 43, Hill returned to first-class cricket for one match to assist in its re- establishment in Australia after the Great War. In support of the benefits of some former colleagues, he played in a further two first-class matches with his best score of 66 coming in a game against Victoria. His last match was for an Australian XI against New South Wales played to support Bill Howell's benefit. In all Tests, Hill scored 3,412 runs at an average just under 40 runs per innings and including seven centuries. When he retired he had scored more runs in Test cricket than any other player; a record he held for 12 years until surpassed by Jack Hobbs. In 1902 Hill was the first to score 1,000 Test runs in a calendar year; the next to do so was Denis Compton 45 years later in 1947. Prolific in Australian state cricket as well, he headed the South Australian first-class averages on ten occasions between 1895‚Äì96 and 1910‚Äì11. In successive innings in 1909‚Äì10 he scored 175 against Victoria in Adelaide, 205 against New South Wales and 185 against Victoria in Melbourne. He was the only Australian to score more than 17,000 runs in the period before pitches were protected from rain. In club cricket he averaged more than 100 runs for the season on three occasions. In 2003, the South Australian Cricket Association named the new southern grandstand at the Adelaide Oval the \\"Clem Hill Stand\\" in recognition of his contribution to South Australian cricket. Hill was inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame in 2005. Outside cricket Hill served an engineering apprenticeship at the government workshops in Islington. On retirement from cricket, however, Hill began a career in horse racing administration. He was employed as a stipendiary steward with the South Australian Jockey Club and the Adelaide Racing Club and in 1937 he was appointed handicapper for the Victoria Amateur Turf Club (VATC) in Melbourne. At the VATC he was responsible for setting the weights for the Caulfield Cup, one of Australia's richest and most prestigious horse races. He served in this role for six years before poor health saw him take a less demanding role at the Geelong Racing Club. Hill married Florence \\"Florrie\\" Hart, granddaughter of William Hart M.L.C. in Tasmania in 1905. The couple settled in Adelaide and raised two daughters, Lesley and Brenda. When he took up his role with the VATC, Hill and his family moved to Toorak, an eastern suburb of Melbourne. In 1945, Hill was thrown from a tram in a traffic accident on busy Collins Street in inner Melbourne. He was taken to Royal Melbourne Hospital and died there soon after aged 68. His body was returned for burial at North Road Cemetery in the Adelaide suburb of Nailsworth. Style and personality Hill demonstrating his unusual grip and stance Short and stocky, Hill was a gifted batsman who could score quickly when required. Wisden described Hill as a \\"specially brilliant batsman on hard pitches\\". He had an awkward crouched stance, gripping the bat low on the handle. This limited his forward reach and power and reduced his effectiveness when driving but he compensated for this with quick footwork. Hill's strong bottom hand and his keen eye allowed him to play the cut shot cleanly and with confidence and to hit powerfully on the leg side. He preferred batting against fast bowling rather than slow and medium pace bowlers and he was a fearless exponent of the hook shot. Hill had a tendency to get out in the \\"nervous nineties\\", being dismissed six times between 90 and 99 in Test matches.Clem Hill Batting analysis, runs scored between 90 and 99 , Cricinfo. Retrieved on 19 December 2008. This included a sequence in the 1901‚Äì02 series against England of 99, 98 and 97 in successive innings. An excellent fielder in the deep, Hill had a powerful throwing arm. During a match at Leeds during the 1902 tour of England, he threw a ball from near the boundary, knocking down the stumps at one end and rebounding to hit the stumps the other end. During the same tour at Old Trafford, Hill made a catch that Wisden claimed \\"will never be forgotten by [those present]\\". A Dick Lilley hit to square leg looked likely to clear the boundary. Hill himself said he raced for it with a view simply to save a boundary. In the event, he ran round 'close to the boundary' from his position at long on, aided by the wind seemingly holding up the ball to take the catch low down in front of the pavilion in his outstretched hands; one that Wisden said \\"few fieldsmen would have thought worth attempting\\". Hill was a man of high ideals and was popular with his fellow players. Pelham Warner commented on his pleasant nature and Robert Trumble, an author and son of Hugh Trumble, recalled him as honest, direct and without guile. An anecdote told about Hill had him hitting a low shot into shadows where Warren Bardsley was fielding. He completed one run and then asked the umpire if the ball had been caught. The shadow made it impossible for the umpire to see, so Hill then asked Bardsley, \\"Did you catch it?\\" When Bardsley replied in the affirmative, Hill immediately walked to the pavilion. When England won four Tests in a row in 1911‚Äì12, Hill managed to retain the confidence of his players. Frank Iredale wrote that Hill was a cheery skipper whose men were happy under his leadership. Despite breaking many records, Hill showed little awareness of them. When watching Jack Hobbs break his record for the most runs in Test cricket at Headingley in 1926, it was Hobbs' wife sitting nearby who had to remind Hill that the record was previously his.

He made 37 centuries ‚Äì including a best of 284 in 1902 ‚Äì and set several partnership and high-score records for his State team. He played 42 Tests for his country, and captained the team for 15 of these between 1903 and 1909. Only the 12th captain of his country, he won eight of these games, lost five and drew two. Between his first Test in January 1898 and his last in August 1909, he scored 1,997 runs at 30.25 and took 121 wickets at 25.00. He complemented his only century, 133 in 1903, by scoring 16 half-centuries. Noble played 39 of his 42 Tests against England, and the other three against South Africa. In later life, he coached and played for club level teams, including Paddington Cricket Club with which he had a long-standing connection throughout his career. He moved from banking to dentistry, and published his exegesis on cricket, Gilligan's Men. His elder brother, Ted Noble, also played briefly for New South Wales. In 2006, he was inducted into the Cricket Hall of Fame by the CA. Career Noble was born in Sydney on 28 January 1873. He was the youngest of eight sons of Joseph and Maria Noble, who emigrated from Egham, Surrey, England. He \\"made a name\\" for himself in grade cricket with the Paddington club and first played for New South Wales (NSW) as a teenager. He toured New Zealand with NSW in 1893, and in 1894 scored a 152* against an England touring team under Andrew Stoddart which drew English attention to his batting. This cemented his place in the state side, and he was a significant contributor to NSW's consecutive Sheffield Shield victories in 1895‚Äì96 and 1896‚Äì97. Noble in 1932. Over the summer of 1897/98, Stoddart returned with another England team and were defeated in four of the five Ashes Test matches. Noble, whose first-class form had earned him selection, scored 17 in Australia's only innings of 520, then took one wicket as England stumbled to 315 all out. Following on Noble routed the tourists with 6/49. He ended the series with the best bowling averages for both teams. Australia returned to England in 1899, and Noble experienced his first overseas tour. He scored 116 in a warm-up match and \\"impressed English critics chiefly by his patience and defence.\\" He played in all five Tests, scoring 367 runs at 52.42, with four half centuries, and took 13 wickets at 31.23. At Manchester he scored 60 and 89, withstanding English bowling for eight and a half hours. Wisden would later record on his death that \\"his patience equalled his skill in defence, while at times he used his height and reach with full effect in driving, pulling, forcing the ball off his legs, and cutting either square or late ‚Äì a batsman of rare style and execution without any sign of weakness.\\" He was in particular noted for his ability to cater his technique to English conditions. He was named Wisden Cricketer of the Year for 1900. Noble faced England in Australia over the winter of 1901/02, scoring 138 runs at 15.33, and taking 32 wickets at 19.00. He then returned to England in 1902 as \\"the best all-rounder\\" under Joe Darling. In a warm-up match at Hove against Sussex, he scored his career-best 284 in a then world-record partnership of 428 with Warwick Armstrong. He scored 1,416 runs across the tour, at 32.93, and took 98 wickets, though in the Test series he scored only 129 of these runs at 18.42. 1902/03 saw a further 92 runs at 23.00, including another half-century, and took six wickets. Noble was elected to the Australian captaincy for the 1903/04 Ashes series, however England were victorious. In 1905 the leadership reverted to Joe Darling for the tour of England, but Australian again lost the rubber. Noble nevertheless scored 2,084 runs at 44.34 across the entire tour. His bowling was viewed as weaker than normal, however Wisden credited his innovative captaincy and field settings. He led his team to England once more in 1909, and reversed a hitherto unsuccessful tour for Australia with innovative captaincy and bowling. In his final Test at The Oval on 9 August 1909, he scored two and 55, though he went wicketless. Noble returned to State cricket, where in 1908 a testimonial match at the Sydney Cricket Ground had earned him ¬£2,000. He continued at New South Wales until 1920, however with seasonal returns of 23, 54, 201, 80 and 13 runs and wicket totals that surpassed two per season only twice in the years either side of World War I, Noble was past his prime. He retired in 1920 and moved into banking, and then dentistry. He wrote and published several works on cricket: Gilligan's Men (1925), The Game's the Thing (1926), Those Ashes (1927), and The Fight for the Ashes (1929) and also became a noted commentator and broadcaster. He continued his association with Paddington Cricket Club, and worked for a time coaching junior cricket teams. He died in Sydney on 22 June 1940, survived by his brother who died a year later. He was also a church bell ringer, and reportedly visited many towers in England while on cricket tours. Graph of Noble's Test batting performance.

He captained the Australian team in two Tests, winning both. Trumble took 141 wickets in Test cricket‚Äîa world record at the time of his retirement‚Äîat an average of 21.78 runs per wicket. He is one of only four bowlers to twice take a hat-trick in Test cricket. Observers in Trumble's day, including the authoritative Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, regarded him as ranking among the great Australian bowlers of the Golden Age of cricket. He was named as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1897 and the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame, established in 1996, inducted him in 2004. A tall and thin off spinner, Trumble delivered the ball at a quicker pace than most spin bowlers, using his height and uncommonly long fingers to his greatest advantage. He was at his best on the softer pitches of England, but his accuracy and variations in pace enabled him to take wickets on the harder pitches of Australia. He was a dependable lower order batsman and a fine fielder in the slips. He was recognised as a shrewd thinker about the game and was popular with team-mates and opponents, with a penchant for practical jokes. Trumble made his Test debut during the Australian cricket team's tour of England in 1890, but was unable to secure a permanent place in the Australian side until the 1896 tour of England. When the Australian team next toured England in 1899, Trumble scored 1,183 runs and took 142 wickets; only George Giffen before him had achieved the \\"double\\" of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets as part of a touring team in England. He was appointed captain of Australia in 1901‚Äì02, when Joe Darling was unavailable due to farming commitments. He retired after the 1902 Australian tour of England but was coaxed back in 1903‚Äì04. In his last Test match, Trumble took a hat-trick, his second, in front of his home town supporters in Melbourne. Off the field, Trumble worked for the National Bank of Australasia, rising to the position of manager of a local branch despite his cricket commitments interrupting his banking career. In 1911, he was appointed secretary of the Melbourne Cricket Club, overseeing the development of the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) into a stadium capable of holding over 70,000 spectators. He held this post until his death in 1938 from a heart attack, aged 71\\\\.  Early life and career  Trumble was born in the inner Melbourne neighbourhood of Collingwood, Victoria in 1867, the son of William, born in Northern Ireland and superintendent of an insane asylum, and Scottish- born Elizabeth (n√©e Clark). His elder brother, John, also played Test cricket for Australia and his younger brother, Thomas, was a public servant who served as Secretary for the Department of Defence from 1918‚Äì27,In the Australian government, a departmental secretary such as the Secretary of the Department of Defence is the senior public servant in a government department; as opposed to the Minister for Defence, a political position. See Australian Public Service#Organisational Structure for further detail on the split between the two roles. and then official secretary to the High Commissioner for Australia in London. Trumble spent part of his early life in the western Victorian town of Ararat before returning to Melbourne, settling in suburban Camberwell. He was educated at Hawthorn Grammar School and played his early cricket for Kew Cricket Club. Encouraging his sons' early love of cricket, William Trumble‚Äîa keen cricketer who bowled leg breaks for South Melbourne Cricket Club‚Äîset out a cricket pitch at the family home.Perry, pp. 90‚Äì93. He placed a feather on a good length and urged his sons to aim at it when bowling. Known for his accuracy, Hugh later said, \\"Of course I couldn't repeatedly hit the feather, but I soon reached the stage when I was always pretty close to it\\" Trumble transferred to the Melbourne Cricket Club for the 1887‚Äì88 cricket season and was an immediate success. He took 36 wickets that season, finishing with an average of 6.77 runs per wicket; the best in the club, beating his teammate and Australian Test bowler Fred Spofforth. He made his first-class cricket debut for Victoria that same season, selected to play against a touring English XI led by Middlesex batsman George Vernon. His first match for Victoria against Australian opposition was against New South Wales at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Bowling with Spofforth, in the first innings Trumble took seven wickets for 52 runs.  Test cricket = Early struggle  Early in the 1889‚Äì90 Australian season, Trumble endured a period where he was not able to take wickets consistently. With selection of the Australian team to tour England in 1890 due at this time, Trumble was anxious about this poor run of form. Noting his anxiety while playing, a friend offered him a beer during the lunch break to revive his spirits. Previously a teetotaler, Trumble enjoyed his first taste and ordered another before re-entering the field of play. Feeling relaxed, although wondering about his steadiness of step, Trumble took a succession of wickets to ensure his selection in the Australian team.Robinson, pp. 88‚Äì94. Trumble finished the season with 27 wickets at an average of 14.20 per wicket. The 1890 Australian team touring England was relatively inexperienced.Pollard (1988), p. 405. The team missed the all-round ability of George Giffen, who had refused to join the squad, thinking it unlikely the tour would be a sporting or financial success.Robinson, p. 62. The Australians won 13 matches on tour, losing 16 and drawing 9. Trumble made his Test cricket debut in the First Test against the English team at Lord's Cricket Ground. He took only one wicket, dismissing Bobby Peel caught and bowled for 1. Batting at number eleven in the first innings he made 1 not out and in the second, 5 runs batting at number ten. Despite this lack of success, he retained his spot in the team for the Second Test at The Oval where he failed to take a wicket. He was selected for the Third Test at Old Trafford but continuous rain saw the match abandoned without a ball being bowled. Trumble played 28 first-class matches during the tour, scoring 288 runs at an average of 8.47 and took 52 wickets at an average of 21.75. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack wrote, \\"Reports from Australia had led us to expect a great deal of ... Trumble\\" but his \\"straightness and regular length [were] insufficient to compensate for an obvious lack of 'devil' and variety\\". Trumble was not selected for the Australian team to play Lord Sheffield's touring English team in 1891‚Äì92. He did not return to the Australian team until his selection in the squad to tour England in 1893. Before the Test matches he took 14 wickets for 116 runs (14/116) against the Players followed by 12/84 against Kent at Gravesend. He played in all three Test matches in 1893, taking 6 wickets at an average of 39.00. Trumble scored 58 runs in the Tests with a highest score of 35 but had more success in the other matches, scoring 774 runs, including one century in all first-class matches on tour. Wisden noted that \\"An immense improvement on his form of three years before was shown by Hugh Trumble, who bowled consistently well all through the tour\\" and \\"... the reports of Hugh Trumble's improvement in batting were amply borne out, his hitting in many matches being remarkably fine\\". When Andrew Stoddart's English team visited Australia in 1894‚Äì95, Trumble played only one Test, the Second at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. In the first innings, England scored 75 runs with Trumble taking 3 wickets. England fought back in their second innings, scoring 475 runs to win the Test by 94 runs; Trumble failed to take a wicket.  Established cricketer  An autographed photograph of Trumble taken in 1907, three years after his retirement from international cricket Trumble was selected in the Australian team to tour England in 1896, despite a poor domestic season in 1895‚Äì96 that saw his place in the touring squad seriously questioned by pundits. The leading cricket journalist, Tom Horan said that as much as he personally liked Trumble, he could not see him as a member of a team for the England tour that season. It was, however, during this tour that Trumble finally established a permanent place in the Australian line up. Wisden said of Trumble when listing him as one of its Cricketers of the Year, \\"...it was not until his third visit, during the past season, that Trumble convinced Englishmen he was entitled to rank among the great bowlers of Australia\\". In that season, Trumble took 148 wickets at an average of 15.81. He was seen as Australia's leading bowler who \\"was able to inspire [the English] batsmen with a feeling of apprehension\\". Wisden's summary of the 1896 Australian tour said of Trumble, \\"His great strength lay in the combination of spin with extreme accuracy\\" and \\"he was on all wickets distinctly the best bowler on the [Australian] side\\". England won the First Test at Lord's by 6 wickets, Trumble taking one wicket in each innings. The Second Test at Old Trafford was more closely fought. Despite K. S. Ranjitsinhji scoring a \\"marvellous\\" 154 and Tom Richardson \\"bowling in his finest form\\" the Australians managed to hold on for a 3 wicket victory. The Australians required 125 runs to win in their second innings and were expected to make this target easily. Richardson's skilful bowling however saw Trumble and Kelly batting together with only 3 wickets in hand but with 25 runs still to make. Against excellent bowling and in a tense atmosphere, the pair managed to bat Australia home with the last runs taking an hour to score, mainly in singles. Trumble made 17 not out to follow his 24 runs in the first innings and his 4 wickets. With the series tied at one Test apiece, the Third and final Test was played at The Oval in London. On a pitch damaged by rain, the English batted first and were dismissed for 145. Trumble took 6 wickets for 59 runs, including a 9-over spell of 5 wickets for 10 runs. England fought back to bowl the Australians out for 119. In turn, the Australians restricted England to 84 runs with Trumble taking 6 wickets for 30, to leave Australia requiring 111 runs in their second innings to win the match. Bobby Peel and Jack Hearne combined to bowl Australia out for 44 runs to win the Test by 66 runs and retain the Ashes for England . In the three Tests, Trumble took 18 wickets at an average of 18.83 runs per wicket. Trumble played in every Test of the 1897‚Äì98 series against the touring English, who were again captained by Stoddart. England won the First Test in Sydney by 9 wickets with Trumble's 70 runs the highest score in the Australian first innings. Under the captaincy of Harry Trott, Australia fought back to win the Second Test in Melbourne by an innings and 55 runs. Trumble took 8 wickets in the match and in partnership with Monty Noble bowled the English out for 150 runs in the second innings. Australia won the Third Test in Adelaide by an innings and 13 runs; Trumble made 37 runs in the Australian innings and took 1 wicket for the match. In the Fourth Test, Trumble combined with Clem Hill in a 165 run partnership for the seventh wicket, described by Wisden as the turning point in the innings. Australia won the match by 8 wickets. Australia won the Fifth Test and the series four Tests to one. For the series overall, Trumble took 19 wickets at an average of 28.15 runs per wicket and scored 170 runs at an average of 36.20. The 1899 Australian tour saw Trumble score 1,183 runs and take 142 wickets; he was only the second Australian, after George Giffen, to score 1,000 runs and take 100 wickets in an English season as part of a touring team. In the Test series, Trumble took 15 wickets at an average of 25.00 and made 232 runs at an average of 38.66. Wisden said of Trumble's batting that season, \\"[Trumble] played so consistently well as to make it clear that if he had not been a bowler he would have been a great batsman\\". Dry pitches saw his bowling average fall off a little from the 1896 tour but Wisden stated that he \\"bowled quite as well as in 1896\\" and \\"[he] never seemed easy to hit, and whenever the ground gave him least advantage ... he was deadly\\". Australia won the Second Test by 10 wickets and with the other Tests finishing in draws, they retained the Ashes in a one Test to nil series victory. Trumble played particularly well in the Third Test at Headingley, where he took 5 wickets for 60 runs and was the highest run-scorer in the Australian second innings with 56. These efforts led him to achieve the number 1 ranking in ICC Test Bowler Rankings for the year 1899 (he retained it for the next 5 years).  Hat- tricks and captaincy  At the age of 34, Trumble was chosen to captain the Australian team against England in 1901‚Äì02 when Joe Darling withdrew to manage his farm in Tasmania after the first three Tests. Australia won the two remaining Tests‚Äîthe only occasions that Trumble would captain his country in Test cricket‚Äîto win the series four Tests to one. Earlier, in the Second Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, Trumble took a \\"hat-trick\\"; only five hat- tricks had been taken in the previous 24 years of Test cricket. He dismissed Arthur Jones, John Gunn and Sydney Barnes in successive balls to complete an Australian victory by 229 runs.Meher-Homji, p. 28. In the Third Test in Adelaide, Trumble captured 6 wickets for 74 runs in the England second innings and made 62 not out to help the Australians win the match by 4 wickets. After this success with the bat, Trumble‚Äîin his new role as captain‚Äîpromoted himself to open the batting alongside Victor Trumper. He made only 6 runs, handing the opening batsman role to Reggie Duff for the second innings. Australia won the Test by 7 wickets with Trumble not required to bat a second time. In the Fifth Test, again in Melbourne, Trumble took 5 wickets for 62 runs to help restrict England to a lead of 45 runs after the first innings. In the second innings Trumble took another 3 wickets and, combined with Noble's 6 wickets, helped Australia win by 32 runs. Trumble and Noble were the most successful Australian bowlers during the series. Together they took 60 wickets in the Tests: Noble 32 at an average of 19.00 and Trumble 28 at an average of 20.03. Trumble (third from left in the back row) with the 1902 Australian touring team, widely recognised as one of the strongest ever to represent Australia.Robinson, p. 84. \\"The 1902 team was widely recognised as such not only its own batting, bowling and fielding merits, but because it met England at full strength.\\" Trumble's last cricketing tour of England was in 1902, with Darling returning to captain the Australian team. Early in the tour, Trumble broke his thumb at practice, causing him to miss the first month of the English season. Despite this, when he returned for the final three Tests he took 26 wickets. In the Fourth Test at Old Trafford, Trumble took 10 wickets. This included 6 wickets in the second innings when he combined with Jack Saunders to bowl England out for 120; securing an Australian victory by 3 runs. Trumble, recalling his final over of the match, said \\"With the ball greasy [wet] and my boots unable to get a proper foothold on slippery turf, it was the most trying over I ever bowled.\\" In the Fifth Test at The Oval, Trumble made 64 runs in the first innings and followed this with 8 wickets for 65 runs in the English first innings. He took another 4 wickets in the English second innings, but this was not sufficient to prevent an English victory by one wicket. Darling bowled Trumble unchanged from the Pavilion end throughout both innings of the match. Wisden praised Trumble's bowling saying \\"Trumble, paying us his fifth visit, bowled perhaps better than ever\\", but remarked that \\"it must be said that the wet weather and soft wickets were all in his favour\\" After playing in one Test match against the South African team on a stopover when returning from England to Australia, Trumble retired from Test cricket, aged 35. When Australia lost to the English tourists in the First Test in Sydney in 1903‚Äì04, Trumble was persuaded to return for the Second Test under the captaincy of Noble. He was immediately successful taking 4 wickets for 107 runs in the first innings and 5 for 34 in the second, but was unable to prevent England from winning the Test by 185 runs Selected for the remaining four Tests, his 24 wickets in four Tests made Trumble the most successful Australian bowler in the series. The writer Roland Perry described Trumble's final Test match as \\"the most dramatic and memorable farewell performance ever by a bowler\\". In front of his home town supporters in Melbourne, he took 7 wickets for 28 runs, including a hat-trick, to bowl Australia to victory; Wisden describing his bowling in the second innings as \\"practically unplayable\\". The hat-trick, his second in Test cricket, consisted of the dismissals of Bernard Bosanquet, Plum Warner and Dick Lilley on 7 March. He went on to take the wicket of Ted Arnold, ending the match and his career in international cricket.  Style and personality  Trumble was tall and thin, in height. His long face featured prominent ears and a large nose, while his long arms and uncommonly long and strong fingers assisted his bowling.Pollard (1988), pp. 1069‚Äì1071. The cricket writer Ray Robinson said of Trumble: \\"El Greco, with his lengthening touch would have liked to draw Trumble. Hugh's lantern shaped head set on a column of a neck would have given the Spaniard a halfway start.\\" English cricketer and author Plum Warner called him \\"That great camel, Hughie Trumble.\\" Trumble demonstrating his bowling action, using his height and long arms to advantage When bowling, Trumble made the most of his height, bringing the ball over the full extent of his right arm. His action was described by his team-mate and bowling partner, Monty Noble, as \\"sidelong and insinuating, with his neck craned like a gigantic bird\\". He bowled off spinners with an impeccable length at medium pace and was able to swing the new ball. He had a well-disguised slower ball, hoodwinking batsmen such as Stanley Jackson, who said, \\"You old devil. You get me caught-and- bowled whenever you like but I'll pick that slow one sooner or later.\\" He preferred English pitches, saying he hardly saw one on which he could not get some turn and the temperate weather allowed him to bowl all day. In Australia, Trumble had to work harder for his wickets on firmer pitches, relying on his change of pace and consistent accuracy; he claimed he could land the ball on a saucer away five times out of six. Johnnie Moyes named him as an \\"immortal of the art\\" who succeeded by \\"attacking the batsman's strength\\". W. G. Grace called him \\"the best bowler Australia has sent us\\". While Trumble was able to score 1,183 runs during the 1899 tour of England, the demands of bowling did not allow him to consistently score heavily. His long, prehensile fingers helped him make a reputation as a fine slips fieldsman and he was the first to take 20 catches in an Australian season. English cricketer Johnny Douglas said, \\"Trumble should not be allowed on the cricket field‚Äîhis natural place would be up trees in the bush.\\" He practised slip fielding by catching a tennis ball thrown against a brick wall; he believed this practise trained him not to \\"snatch\\" at the ball but allow it to fall into his safe hands. Trumble was known for his cleverness on the field. C. B. Fry said of him, \\"He is the most long-headed, observant and acute judge of the game, a perfect master of the whole art of placing fieldsmen and changing bowlers.\\" On one occasion when captaining his state side, Victoria, he deliberately bowled two wides that his fieldsmen allowed to roll to the boundary to score four runs for his opponents. This was done to save his tired bowlers from having to bowl again immediately, as his opponents would have been required to follow-on (bat twice in a row), at the time compulsory. When questioned by an onlooker about the dubious sportsmanship of the action, he replied, \\"I had to do it, old chap, but I wonder what my father will think of it?\\" Trumble was respected by his teammates and opponents; New Zealand cricketer, Dan Reese, who played against and alongside Trumble said, \\"His subtle humour, his fund of cricket stories, his kindness, and, above all, his judgment, made him a man of exceptional character.\\" He was popular with team-mates and opponents alike, with a weakness for practical jokes. On board a ship travelling to England, Trumble offered to coach unsuspecting fellow travellers in various deck sports such as quoits. Accepting Trumble's advice, they were made to contort themselves into a number of ludicrous positions to the amusement of his team-mates and other onlookers in the know. To prolong the joke, in his own games Trumble would adopt the same peculiar stance and method he advocated.  Legacy and statistical analysis  An innings-by-innings breakdown of Trumble's Test match batting career, showing runs scored (red bars) and the average of the last 10 innings (blue line). The blue dots indicate an innings where he was not dismissed. \\"The first of the great off spinners of the Test-match age\\", in 32 Tests, Trumble took 141 wickets at an average of just over 20 runs per wicket. He took 5 wickets in an innings on nine occasions and 10 wickets in a match three times. On retirement, he had taken more wickets in Test cricket than any other player; a record he held for nearly 10 years until surpassed by Sydney Barnes. It wasn't until Dennis Lillee 75 years later that anyone was able to better Trumble's 141 wickets against England. While mainly a bowler, Trumble batted well enough to make 851 runs in Test cricket at an average of 19.79 with a highest score of 70. Trumble was also prolific at first-class level. He took 929 wickets, including 5 wickets in an innings on 69 occasions, and as a batsman, he made 5,395 runs with three centuries and a highest score of 107. For Melbourne Cricket Club, he took just under 400 wickets and scored more than 3,000 runs; winning the club best bowling average on six occasions and the best batting average once. Trumble was particularly effective in England. After taking 52 wickets on his first tour of England in 1890, his other four visits to England‚Äîin 1893, 1896, 1899 and 1902‚Äîsaw him take over 100 wickets in first-class matches. In 1899, he scored 1,183 runs making him one of only four Australians, with George Giffen, Warwick Armstrong (both three times) and Jack Gregory, to take over 100 wickets and make over 1,000 runs on a tour of England. The ICC player rankings have been applied retrospectively to cricket history and Trumble achieved the top ranking as a bowler. By June 1896, he was ranked fifth in the world and never again slipped lower; from 1899 until his retirement he was the first or second best bowler in the world according to the ratings. As a batsman, Trumble's ranking peaked at twelfth in the world after the Third Test in Adelaide in 1901‚Äì02. Trumble was the first player to take two hat-tricks in Test cricket. Both hat-tricks were taken against England at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, where Trumble played his club cricket. Hat-tricks are extremely rare; in over 131 years of Test cricket to March 2008, there had only been 37 Test hat-tricks and only Jimmy Matthews and Wasim Akram been able to repeat Trumble's feat of taking a second.  Off the playing field  Trumble in later years, when he was secretary of the Melbourne Cricket Club Trumble joined the National Bank of Australasia in 1887 to begin a career in banking. While the bank often allowed him time to practice, his frequent absences with cricket meant his career progression was slow; after each of his five tours of England he returned to find junior bank officers promoted over him. Nevertheless, he was appointed accountant at the Richmond branch in 1903 and after his retirement from cricket in 1908, manager of the Kew branch. A loyal clubman, Trumble served on the committee of the Melbourne Cricket Club (MCC) from 1900‚Äì01 to 1910‚Äì11 and was made a life member in 1904. In 1911 he resigned from the bank to become MCC club secretary; a position he held for 27 years until his death. In this role, he played a leading part in reconciling the club and the Victorian Cricket Association after a period of some friction between the two bodies. He was instrumental in attracting quality cricketers to the club including Bert Ironmonger, whom Trumble saw play on a visit to Queensland. During his term as secretary, the Melbourne Cricket Ground was expanded to a capacity of over 70,000 spectators. Trumble was a prominent writer about and elder statesman of the game and was conspicuous in his support for journalists calling at any hour. From time to time, Trumble acted as a selector of the Victorian cricket team.Haigh, p. 200. In 2001, Trumble was selected in the Melbourne Cricket Club Team of the Century, and in 2004 he was inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame for his contribution to the sport in Australia. In 1899, aged 31, Trumble met and fell in love with Florence Christian, aged 19 from Queensland. The couple were married in 1902, with the wedding timed to allow a honeymoon trip accompanying the Australian cricket tour of England. An injury to his thumb freed Trumble from cricket commitments for a while, to his new wife's delight. Together, the couple had eight children; six sons and two daughters. One son, Robert, a renowned musician and writer, dedicated his first book, The Golden Age of Cricket, to his father. Trumble died aged 71, from a heart attack in his home in the Melbourne eastern suburb of Hawthorn.

As captain, he led Australia in a total of 21 Tests, winning seven and losing four. In Test cricket, he scored 1657 runs at an average of 28.56 per innings, including three centuries. Darling toured England four times with the Australian team‚Äîin 1896, 1899, 1902 and 1905; the last three tours as captain. He was captain of the Australian cricket team in England in 1902, widely recognised as one of the best teams in Australian cricket history. He was a stocky, compact man and a strong driver of the ball, playing most of his cricket as an opening batsman. He was a patient batsman and was known for his solid defence, but he was able to score quickly when required. In Sydney in 1897‚Äì98, he scored 160 in 165 minutes, including 30 boundaries to assist his team in defeating the English. He was the first man to score 500 runs in a Test series and was also the first to score three centuries in a series. His captaincy was disciplinarian in nature but his teammates respected his broad cricket knowledge. Even tempered with a strong personality, he was a stickler for fair play on the field. His teammates gave him the nickname \\"Paddy\\" due to a supposed resemblance to the Australian boxer, Frank \\"Paddy\\" Slavin. His cricket career was interrupted several times due to his obligations as a farmer, first growing wheat in South Australia, and later as a wool-grower in Tasmania. He was a member of several bodies dedicated to agriculture in Tasmania, including the responsible authority for the Royal Hobart Show. He was a pioneer in activities such as rabbit eradication and pasture improvement. He entered politics in 1921, standing as an independent in the Tasmanian Legislative Council, where he was a forceful speaker. He retained his seat in the Tasmanian Parliament until his death following a gall bladder operation in 1946. Early life and career Darling was born on 21 November 1870 in Glen Osmond, South Australia, the sixth son of John Darling, a grain merchant and his wife Isabella, n√©e Ferguson. He was educated at Prince Alfred College, where he took an interest in cricket. At the age of 15, he scored a record 252 runs in the \\"inter-collegiate\\" match, the annual fixture against fierce rival St Peter's College. His future Test teammate, Clem Hill, would later beat this record, scoring 360. Not long after, he was included in a combined South Australian/Victoria XV that played the Australian XI in 1886. He made only 16 runs, but the manner in which he made them saw senior players hail him as a future champion.Pollard, pp. 322‚Äì325. His father, disapproving of Darling's fondness for sport, sent him away from his cricket and Australian rules football teams to spend twelve months at Roseworthy Agricultural School. Later, Darling worked in a bank for a time and before his father appointed him manager of one of a wheat farm. Working on the farm added size and strength to an already stocky and athletic frame.Robinson, pp. 75‚Äì87. He was selected for the South Australian team at age 19, but his father would not allow him time off the farm to play. After two years in the bush, Darling returned to Adelaide and cricket. He opened a sports store on Rundle Street, Adelaide and was soon selected to represent South Australia in inter-colonial cricket. He made his first-class cricket debut against New South Wales at the Adelaide Oval; scoring 5 and 32 as South Australia won the match by 237 runs. The next season, against the touring England team captained by Andrew Stoddart, Darling made 115, his maiden first-class century. Test career=Consolidation Darling in 1896 The First Test of 1894‚Äì95 against England, at the Sydney Cricket Ground, saw Darling make his Test debut. In an innings where Australia make 586 runs, including centuries for George Giffen and Syd Gregory, Darling was dismissed for a golden duck, bowled first ball by Tom Richardson. He played in all five Tests in the series, scoring 258 runs at an average of 28.66 per innings. He was included in the Australian team to tour England in 1896, where he topped the scoring aggregates for the tour with 1555 runs at an average of 29.90, including three centuries. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack stated that Darling \\"proved himself perhaps the best of present-day left- handed batsmen\\" during the tour. England won the series two Tests to one. Andrew Stoddart brought another team to Australia to contest The Ashes in 1897‚Äì98. Australia won the series comfortably, four Tests to one. Darling started the season poorly, scoring a duck and one against the tourists for South Australia in a match in which teammate Clem Hill scored a double century. Darling went on, however, to dominate the series with the bat. His maiden Test century, 101 in the First Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground after Australia was made to follow-on, was the first made by a left-hander in Tests. It was not enough to prevent England winning by nine wickets. In the Third Test in his home town of Adelaide, Darling scored 178 runs and Australia won the match by an innings and 13 runs. He reached his century by hitting Johnny Briggs over the eastern gate and into the nearby park. This is the only time in Ashes Tests where a player has reached 100 with a hit out of the ground. During this innings, he also became the first player to hit a six in a Test in Australia (prior to 1910, a six was awarded only if the ball was hit out of the ground). He later also hit the first six in a Test in England. Returning to Sydney for the Fifth and final Test, Darling scored 160 runs from 253 scored in total. He batted for 165 minutes, hitting 30 boundaries as Australia successfully chased 273 in the fourth innings. His first 100 came in 91 minutes; at the time, the fastest Test century scored. By the end of the season, Darling became the first player to score 500 runs in a series and the first player to score three centuries in a series. Captaincy Darling c. 1905 Darling was chosen by his teammates as captain for the 1899 Australian team touring England. The team was one of the strongest seen in England to that time, with the cricket reference book Wisden stating, \\"By common consent the [1899 Australians] formed the strongest combination that had come from the Colonies since the great side captained by Mr. W. L. Murdoch in 1882.\\" and that \\"Darling proved himself one of the very best captains that ever took a team into the field.\\" The Australians lost only three of the 35 matches they played on the tour, winning 16 and another 16 finishing in draws.Pollard, p. 408. The only Test to reach a decisive result was the Second Test at Lord's, where Australia won by ten wickets due in part to centuries by Hill and Victor Trumper and a ten wicket haul by fast bowler Ernie Jones. Aside from Hill, Darling was seen by Wisden as the best batsman among the Australians. Wisden claimed, \\"Up to a certain point the responsibilities of captaincy seemed to tell against Darling, but during the last weeks of the tour he played marvellous cricket.\\" Over the tour, he scored 1941 runs at an average of 41.29, topping both the averages and the aggregate for his team, and was named as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year. Darling's deeds as a cricketer had reconciled his father to his sporting endeavours, but not to his sports store operation. In 1900, his father purchased \\"Stonehenge\\", a sheep station covering in central Tasmania and ordered Darling to run the property on pain of exclusion from his will. Darling complied with his father's wishes and moved his family to the remote station, along a dirt track from the nearest town, tiny Oatlands. Darling stood out of first-class cricket for nearly two years. It was not until December 1901 that Darling was convinced to return by the Melbourne Cricket Club to captain the Australians against the touring English for the first three Tests only. The English, captained by Archie MacLaren, won the First Test in Sydney convincingly by an innings and 124 runs. The Second Test in Melbourne was played on a rain-affected pitch. MacLaren won the toss and sent Australia in to bat on the \\"sticky wicket\\". Within three hours, both teams had been dismissed; Australia holding a lead on the first innings of 51 runs. Realising the danger the pitch held to his leading batsmen, Darling re-ordered the batting line-up and opened the batting himself alongside Hugh Trumble. The pair held out the English for 90 minutes; Darling considered his 32 runs one of his best innings. Nevertheless, Barnes managed to grab five wickets in the final half-hour to leave the Australians 5/48See scoring (cricket) for an explanation of cricket score formats. This score and all others in the article follow the Australian format of wickets fallen followed by runs made. when stumps was called. Twenty five wickets fell in the day's play. Importantly, Australia had a 99-run lead and batsmen of the calibre of Hill, Trumper, Reggie Duff and Warwick Armstrong still to bat. The next day, on a perfect pitch, the Australian batsmen established a match- winning lead, eventually winning the Test by 229 runs. In the Third Test in Adelaide, Australia became the first team to score over 300 runs to win the fourth innings of a Test match. Darling, along with Hill and Trumble, led the record making run chase; Darling scored 62 runs. Hugh Trumble captained the final two Tests as Darling returned to his farm. Australia won both Tests and the series to retain The Ashes.Perry, pp. 76‚Äì91. Return to cricket Darling agreed to once again lead the Australian cricket team in England in 1902. In what was a very cold and wet summer, the Australian team won a close fought series against the strong English team two Tests to one. Given the strength of the opposition, this Australian team is often referred to as one of the best Australian teams ever assembled. The team included players of the calibre of Trumper, Hill, Armstrong, Trumble and Monty Noble; all of whom would be later included in the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame. The team lost only two matches during the tour, with Wisden saying, \\"No travelling team ever strove harder for victory or more completely subordinated all personal considerations to the prime object of winning matches. They formed a splendid all-round combination\\". Darling (centre, middle row) with his famed 1902 touring team The First Test at Edgbaston finished in a draw. Rain saved the Australians after they were dismissed for only 36 in their first innings; Wilfred Rhodes took seven wickets for only 17 runs.Frith, p. 75. Rain again ruined the Second Test at Lord's when the final two days were washed out.Frith, p. 77. The Third Test, the only Test match played at Bramall Lane, saw Australia win by 143 runs due in part to a century by Hill and Noble taking 5/51. Darling was dismissed twice by Barnes without scoring, the first Test captain to make a \\"pair\\". Australia won the Fourth Test at Old Trafford by three runs; Trumble took ten wickets for the match. The last batsman, Fred Tate, came in with England needing eight runs to secure victory. Darling brought the field in and Trumble prevented Rhodes scoring from the last three balls of his over. This left Tate to face Jack Saunders, who dismissed him with the fourth ball of his over to win the match for Australia. England won the Fifth and final Test at the Oval by one wicket. Chasing 263, England were 5/48 when Gilbert Jessop scored a century in 75 minutes to help England to victory. The star for the Australians was Trumper who scored 2,570 runs, easily beating Darling's own record for a colonial batsman in an English season set in 1899. So important was Trumper to the Australian team that Darling, who had previously checked that all the Australians were on board the carriage to the ground, was later simply to ask \\"Is Vic aboard?\\" before giving the driver the go-ahead. Darling himself had a mixed tour with the bat. On the return trip to Australia, the touring team stopped to play three Tests against South Africa, the first between the two nations. Australia won the series two Tests to nil, but Darling's own form was poor. In successive innings, Darling made 0, 14, 6, 4 and 1. After the tour, he returned to Stonehenge and took a two-year break from first-class cricket. In his absence, Monty Noble captained the Australian team against the touring English in 1903‚Äì04. Final tour and retirement Before the Australian team to tour England in 1905 was selected, Darling returned to first-class cricket for South Australia. He won selection in the touring squad and was named as captain. A weaker Australian bowling attack saw Darling resort to defensive measures throughout the tour. These measures included directing Armstrong to bowl his leg breaks down the leg side, where Darling had placed up to seven fielders. These measures, unpopular with the English public, saw 19 matches on the tour finish in draws, three more than the 16 matches won by Australia. Wisden said, \\"Leaving aside Duff's long score at the Oval, Darling was the finest batsman on the side in the Test games, playing superb cricket under very trying conditions.\\" At Old Trafford in the Fourth Test, he made 73 out of 105 in less than ninety minutes. His innings included thirteen boundaries, all but one of them being drives. Despite his efforts, England still won the Test by an innings and 80 runs. After losing six tosses against his English opposite number Stanley Jackson during the summer, Darling decided on a different approach before the Scarborough Festival match late in the tour. At the toss, he approached Jackson stripped to the waist and suggested, in fun, a wrestle for choice of innings. The 1905 tour was Darling's last Test cricket foray, as he claimed that continuing to tour was unfair to his wife. He retired from first-class cricket during the 1907‚Äì08 season. In his first-class career, Darling made 10635 runs, including 19 centuries at an average of 34.52. In club cricket in Adelaide, Joe scored heavily. He averaged 144 for East Torrens Cricket Club in 1899‚Äì1900, 98.66 for Adelaide Cricket Club in 1896‚Äì97 and 86.20 for Sturt Cricket Club in 1904‚Äì05. He continued to make runs in Tasmanian club cricket right through middle age. In 1921, he made 100 runs in an hour, including 29 in one eight-ball over playing for Claremont Cricket Club. At age 52, he made 133 not out during a successful run chase where his team, Break-o'-Day, made 6/219 in 90 minutes. He was contemptuous of the newly formed Australian Board of Control for International Cricket Matches (now known as Cricket Australia), who he saw as attempting to remove control of international cricket tours from the players. He would often refer to cricket administrators as \\"Dead Heads\\". He later represented the Tasmanian Cricket Association as a delegate to the Board of Control. Outside cricket Parliamentary portrait of Darling Following his retirement from big cricket, Darling returned to his Tasmanian sheep station, where he was involved in a range of agricultural activities. He pioneered measures to eradicate rabbits, an introduced pest then in plague proportions throughout Australia. He was an active member of organisations such as the Tasmanian Stock Holders and Orchardists' Association and the Royal Agricultural Society of Tasmania, the organising body of the Royal Hobart Show. Darling imported South Australian merino rams to improve his flock, and his wool topped the Hobart sales on several occasions. He also introduced subterranean clover to Tasmania. In 1919, Darling moved from Stonehenge to Claremont House, around which the Hobart suburb of Claremont later formed. He was elected to the Cambridge electorate in the Tasmanian Legislative Council in 1921 as an independent. He retained his position in the Parliament until his death in 1946. In Parliament, one of his colleagues was Charles Eady, his teammate from the 1896 tour of England. Darling was recognised by his colleagues as a forceful, no-nonsense speaker. In the 1930s, he won an exemption from land tax for small farmers, and toward the end of his parliamentary career, a Royal Commission was appointed to investigate charges Darling had made regarding maladministration. The findings of the commission, released after his death, saw a government Minister and two others found guilty of accepting bribes. Darling was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1938 New Year Honours in recognition of his work as a member of the Legislative Assembly. Darling married Alice Minna Blanche Francis, a wheat farmer's daughter from Mundoora, South Australia in 1893. Together they raised 15 children: ten sons and five daughters. After surgery for a ruptured gall bladder, Darling died in Hobart on 2 January 1946. He was buried at Cornelian Bay cemetery after a Congregationalist ceremony and was survived by his wife and twelve of his children. Style and personality Paddy Slavin Darling had a stocky, compact build, standing and weighing . His teammates thought his dark hair, blue eyes and moustache were similar to the boxer, Frank \\"Paddy\\" Slavin, and he answered to the nickname \\"Paddy\\" during his time in cricket. His time working on his father's farm had developed his strength. During his first game for South Australia, he was challenged to a naked wrestle by the fast bowler and ex-miner Ernie Jones, an informal initiation into the team. To his teammates' surprise, Darling managed to defeat the much larger Jones. The left-handed Darling was a strong driver of the ball who showed the batsman the full face of the bat. When necessary, he was a dour defender of his wicket. His fellow players thought that was sometimes unnecessarily defensive in his approach to batting and that he was at his best when driving hard. His South Australian and Australian teammate George Giffen thought that no Australian's cut shots travelled faster past point. Darling holds the record for the most innings in a complete Test Match career (60), without being dismissed lbw.. Darling had a strong personality and an independent outlook. Those who knew him well thought him destined to be a leader in whatever he undertook. He shunned strong drink and tobacco and found it difficult to tolerate overindulgence in alcohol. Normally even- tempered, he did show displeasure at the heckling from the crowd at Lord's at his obstinate defensive effort in the face of an Australian batting collapse. He was a stickler for fair play, but his actions against the English batsman KS Ranjitsinhji would today be seen as gamesmanship. During the bowler's approach and after the bowler had looked at the field, the Australian fielders moved behind Ranjitsinhji's back. This worried the Indian prince when playing his leg glance and eventually saw him left out of the English team. The journalist Ray Robinson wrote that \\"of all Australian captains he came closest to being a disciplinarian\\". Regardless, his teammates continued to select him as captain, trusting in his knowledge and understanding of the game. On a wet day during the 1899 tour, a delay in play saw some of the Australians accept an invitation to the Player's tobacco factory in Nottingham. While away, the weather cleared and play began with Darling leading a team of five Australians and five substitutes onto the field. Darling later called a team meeting that saw the culprits fined ¬£5 for breaching team rules. His approach to the hard- drinking Ernie Jones was similarly tough. To ensure that the fast bowler would not drink to excess, he selected Jones as twelfth man in a match against an English county team. When Jones refused to play, a team meeting saw him facing expulsion from the team. Darling spoke to him privately and made it clear that without an apology to his teammates and a promise to curb his drinking, he would be on the next boat bound for Australia. The firm and prompt action had a lasting effect on team discipline during his time as Australian captain. Wisden noted that \\"as a captain he inspired his men to reveal their best form.\\" As a captain he was a reformer, suggesting rule changes that included making six runs the reward for clearing the boundary rather than the entire ground, and using of sawdust to fill holes in bowler's run-ups.

Although Trott was a versatile batsman, spin bowler and outstanding fielder, \\"... it is as a captain that he is best remembered, an understanding judge of human nature\\".Robinson (1996), pp. 67‚Äì74. After a period of some instability and ill discipline in Australian cricket, he was the first in a succession of assertive Australian captains that included Joe Darling, Monty Noble and Clem Hill, who restored the prestige of the Test team. Respected by teammates and opponents alike for his cricketing judgement, Trott was quick to pick up a weakness in opponents. A right-handed batsman, he was known for his sound defence and vigorous hitting. His slow leg-spin bowling was often able to deceive batsmen through subtle variations of pace and flight, but allowed opposition batsmen to score quickly. Trott made his Test debut in 1888, on a tour of England, and would tour England another three times (in 1890, 1893 and 1896), scoring more than 1000 runs on each occasion. For the 1896 tour, Trott was elected captain by his teammates. Despite England winning the series two Tests to one and retaining The Ashes, Trott's ability as a captain was highly regarded. In the return series in Australia during the 1897‚Äì98 season, Trott's team was more successful, winning the five-Test series 4‚Äì1 and regaining The Ashes. At a time when the federation of the Australian colonies was under discussion, the victory saw Trott praised as a \\"national institution\\" and his team as having \\"done more for the federation of Australian hearts than all the big delegates put together\\". A severe mental illness abruptly ended Trott's Test career at the age of 31. After a series of seizures in 1898, he suffered from insomnia, apathy, and memory loss. Failing to recover lucidity, he was committed to a psychiatric hospital for over a year. After he was discharged, he eventually returned to cricket, and continued to play for his state, Victoria, and club, South Melbourne, into his forties. After his retirement, Trott served as a selector for Victoria for a number of years. Outside of cricket, he worked as a postman and mail sorter. He died of cancer in 1917, aged 51. Early life and career Born in Collingwood, an inner suburb of Melbourne, Trott was the third of eight children born to accountant Adolphus Trott and his wife Mary-Ann (n√©e Stephens).Haigh (2004), pp. 107‚Äì115 His younger brother Albert also became a Test cricketer. The siblings played their junior cricket with the local Capulet club. Harry transferred to South Melbourne, which played in Melbourne's pennant competition, after scouts for the club noticed him playing park cricket. In his first season, the 18-year- old Trott recorded the best batting average and bowling average for the team. Trott made his first-class debut for Victoria against an \\"Australian XI\\" on New Year's Day 1886, scoring four and 18 not out. Two months later, he played his first inter-colonial match, against South Australia at the Adelaide Oval. Batting, he scored 54 runs; his innings included a memorable hit over the leg side boundary from the bowling of leading Test all-rounder George Giffen, and he captured seven wickets for the match with his bowling. In 1886‚Äì87, Trott hit a double century for South Melbourne in a match against St Kilda and appeared for Victoria against Alfred Shaw's touring English team, claiming four wickets for 125 runs (4/125). During the next summer, he played for a non-representative \\"Australian XI\\" against Arthur Shrewsbury's XI and George Vernon's XI, two English teams touring Australia simultaneously. His chances for inclusion in the Australian squad for the forthcoming tour of England were enhanced when a number of leading players made themselves unavailable.Harte (2003), p 154. However, Trott's batting credentials were modest: he had scored only one half-century in 29 first-class innings. At this point, Trott had enjoyed more success with his bowling. Prior to the Australian team departing for England, a change to the leg before wicket (LBW) law that would aid bowlers of Trott's style seemed imminent. The former Australian player Tom Horan wrote: \\"There is no bowler in England who has such a fast leg-break, and on a fine, firm pitch many a batsman has saved his wicket by his legs or body in opposing Trott's deliveries.\\"Horan (1989), pp. 128‚Äì129. Test cricket=First tours of England Included in the Australian squad to tour England in 1888, Trott was selected in the team for the First Test at Lord's. He had an inauspicious Test debut: he made a duck in the first innings and three runs in the second, and did not bowl. The Australians won the game by 62 runs, only their second Test match victory in England. However, England retained The Ashes by winning the remaining two Tests and Trott's influence on the series was negligible: he did not pass 20 in an innings, and he failed to take a wicket. Nevertheless, his performances in the other matches of the season prompted Wisden Cricketers' Almanack to write that he, \\"... fully justif[ied] his selection by scoring the highly creditable total of 1,212 runs, with an average of over 19 per innings\\", and that his fielding was \\"excellent at point\\". Wisden was less complimentary about his bowling: \\"We have no great opinion of Trott's leg break bowling, and think it probably too slow to be effectual against good batsmen.\\" Trott's opportunities were limited as his teammates Charles Turner and John Ferris, \\"monopolised the bowling\\". Trott was an outstanding fielder, usually at point On his return to Australia, Trott's batting continued to improve. He scored 172 runs for an Australian XI against New South Wales, his maiden century in first-class cricket. The Sydney Morning Herald wrote that the innings \\"... stamped him as a batsman of the highest class\\". In first-class matches, Trott posted 507 runs (at 39.00 average) and claimed 25 wickets (at 17.44 average) for the summer, and hit a double century in a club match against Melbourne. Another good all-round season in 1889‚Äì90 ensured his place for the next trip to England. The 1890 Australian team touring England was relatively inexperienced.Pollard (1988), p. 405. The team missed the all-round ability of George Giffen who had refused to tour, thinking it unlikely the tour would be a sporting or financial success.Robinson (1996), p. 62. The Australians won 13 matches on tour, losing 16 and drawing 9. Trott scored 1,211 first-class runs (at 20.87 average) with a highest score of 186 against Cambridge University Past and Present, and captured 20 wickets. Disappointed by Trott's performances, Wisden felt that he \\"... barely maintained the reputation he had so honestly gained during the tour of 1888 ... it cannot be said that he came up to expectations\\". Australian revival and Wisden Cricketer of the Year In 1891‚Äì92, Lord Sheffield's team (captained by W. G. Grace) toured Australia, the first English side to do so in four years. The presence of Grace contributed to a revival of interest in the game that had waned due to a surfeit of international tours and indifferent performances by the Australian team.Harte (2003), p173. The Australians won the series 2‚Äì1 to regain The Ashes. In the first Test at Melbourne, Trott scored three and 23, but had greater impact with the ball. Requiring 213 runs for victory, England's score reached 60 before their first two batsmen were dismissed. The Australian captain Jack Blackham then gambled by calling on Trott's often inaccurate bowling. Trott took two quick wickets and the English innings never recovered.Whitington (1974), p 45. In returning 3/52 for the innings, Wisden noted that Trott \\"bowled admirably\\". The remaining two Tests were less productive for Trott: he finished with 48 runs (at an average of 8.00) and 6 wickets (at an average of 35.00) for the series. A reorganisation of Australian cricket took place in the wake of the tour. The first national body to control the game, the Australasian Cricket Council (ACC), was formed to co-ordinate the Australian Test team. Previously, private entrepreneurs and the players themselves organised international cricket. Lord Sheffield donated money to the ACC, which was used to purchase a trophy for the champion domestic team. Trott appeared in Victoria's inaugural Sheffield Shield match, against New South Wales in December 1892. He scored 63 and 70 not out in a winning effort. The ACC appointed Trott as one of the six players to select the touring team for England.Harte (2003), pp 176‚Äì177. The Australian team toured England in 1893 to compete for The Ashes. The English won the series one Test to nil, with two drawn to recover The Ashes. Playing in all three Tests, Trott scored 146 runs in the series at an average of 29.20 and in all first-class matches he scored 1269 runs. While Trott did not take a wicket in the Tests, he took 38 wickets in all first-class matches that season. In the Second Test at the Oval, Trott scored 92 runs in the second innings after the Australians were forced to follow-on; an innings described as \\"really superb cricket\\" and \\"the finest exhibition he has ever given in England\\". England, regardless, still won the match by an innings. Trott was named as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year. Wisden noted that Trott \\"batted uncommonly well ‚Äî much better than in 1890\\" but that when bowling he \\"did a good many brilliant things against the weaker teams, but he was nearly always expensive and very rarely successful when opposed to batsmen of high class\\". The Trott brothers The Australian team pictured during the summer of 1894‚Äì95. Harry Trott is at the far left of the middle row, and his younger brother Albert is seated at front, on the right. Andrew Stoddart led an English team to Australia in 1894‚Äì95 to defend The Ashes. A feature of the summer was the emergence of Albert Trott and the performance of the brothers in tandem. Playing for Victoria against the touring side, the Trotts claimed twelve wickets and held eight catches between them; Harry scored 63 in the second innings. During the second innings of the traditional Christmas fixture against New South Wales, Albert claimed five wickets, took three catches (two from Harry's bowling) and made a run out. In between these two games, England won the first Test at Sydney‚Äîa remarkable turnaround after they had been forced to follow-on‚Äîby bowling the Australians out for 166 in the second innings. The second Test at Melbourne saw another English victory; Trott played a rearguard innings of 95 in the second innings, to no avail. Attempting to stay in the series, Australia dramatically revamped their team for the next Test at Adelaide. Albert Trott, making his Test debut, was one of four inclusions while Harry was elevated to open the batting. In a match played in intense heat throughout, Harry Trott made 48 on the opening day before he was run out. Albert was the dominant player of the match with innings of 38 not out and 72 not out (both scored from the number ten position), and a bowling return of 8/43 in England's second innings. Australia won the match by 382 runs. In a Sheffield Shield match that followed, the Trotts extricated Victoria from a difficult situation. Chasing 155 to win, New South Wales fell for 99 with Albert taking four wickets and Harry five. In the fourth Test at Sydney, Australia batted first and scored 284 runs (Albert Trott 85 not out) before England were bowled out for 65 and 72 on a wicket affected by heavy rain. Opening the bowling in the first innings, Harry Trott dismissed Archie MacLaren, Johnny Briggs and Stoddart. The fluctuating fortunes of the Test series created immense interest in the deciding Test at Melbourne. Spectators arrived from all over the country, with special trains laid on from Adelaide and Sydney.Harte (2003), p 185. Harry Trott's all-round contribution was a score of 42 in each innings, six wickets and two catches, but England won The Ashes by chasing a target of 297 runs in the second innings, which they reached with six wickets in hand. Even in England, \\"the interest was greater than had ever been felt in matches played away from [England]\\". During the following summer, Trott again acted as a Test selector, along with the incumbent Test captain George Giffen and former captain Percy McDonnell.Harte (2003), p 187. When choosing the Australian team for the previous tour of England, Giffen used his influence to ensure the selection of his younger brother, Walter. The team chosen for the 1896 tour of England included a number of promising young players, including Joe Darling and Clem Hill, both of whom went on to captain Australia. Albert Trott was a controversial omission, in light of performances in the previous Ashes series, but he accompanied the team on their voyage and later settled in England. He had a successful career with Middlesex and appeared for England in two Test matches against South Africa. The cricket historian David Frith records that when the Trott brothers encountered each other on an English street, they merely exchanged acknowledging nods and kept walking.Frith (1984), p 36. Captain of Australia Trott While the team was en route to England, the players elected Trott as captain ahead of George Giffen. On the opening day of the first Test at Lord's, England bowled Australia out in 75 minutes for only 53 runs on a pitch thought to be good for batting. In reply, England made 292 with Trott taking two wickets. In their second innings, Australia was still 177 runs in arrears with three wickets down when Syd Gregory joined Trott at the crease. Their partnership of 221 runs led Wisden to record that, \\"as long as cricket is played ... cause the match to be remembered\\". Trott's score of 143 (the only Test century of his career) was not enough to prevent England winning by six wickets. In the second Test at Manchester, Australia again batted first, scoring 412 runs; Frank Iredale making 108 and Trott 53. At the beginning of England's first innings, Trott opened the bowling with his flighted leg-spin. It was unusual for a leg-spinner to take the new ball, but the move‚Äîa \\"stroke of genius\\" according to Wisden‚Äîwas successful as he dismissed Stoddart and W. G. Grace for low scores. Both batsmen were deceived by Trott's flight and stumped by the wicket-keeper. England totaled 231 and, forced to follow on, scored 305 runs in the second innings, K. S. Ranjitsinhji making 154 not out. In a tense finish, Australia made the 125 runs needed for victory with three wickets in hand. On a pitch affected by rain, England won the series and The Ashes, defeating Australia in the Third Test by 66 runs; Australia were bowled out for 44 runs in the second innings, at one stage having lost nine wickets for 25. Trott made 1297 runs and took 44 wickets in first-class matches on the tour. Of his batting Wisden said \\"Trott's average is a little disappointing, but when a special effort was required he was not often at fault.\\" and he bowled \\"on a good many occasions with fair results\\". However it was as a captain that Trott earned most plaudits. Wisden rated Trott as \\"with the exception of [Billy Murdoch], ... incomparably the best captain the Australians had ever had in this country\\". Although the team was considered successful, in spite of the failure to recapture The Ashes, the problems between the players and the administrators continued. Before the team departed Australia, the players arbitrarily replaced one of the selected players without recourse to the ACC. After the final match in England, Trott and his players broke an agreement to return home in time for the 1896‚Äì97 Australian season. Instead, they organised matches in North America and New Zealand. \\"A national institution\\" Fond of hats, Trott was seldom seen without one.Trott retained the captaincy when Andrew Stoddart returned to Australia with his English team in 1897‚Äì98. Stoddart's team got away to a good start when they won the First Test in Sydney by nine wickets, K. S. Ranjitsinhji scoring 175 runs. With Joe Darling, Trott devised a plan to curb Ranjitsinhji's run scoring. An exponent of the leg glance, \\"Ranji\\" would take a last look at the field before he took guard. Taking advantage of this fact, after he took strike, the Australians deliberately weakened the off side with two men placed about away from him. Bowling a leg side line, the Australians aimed for a catch from a shot played to that side.Pollard (1986), p. 139. Darling said of the plan, \\"As soon as he had his last look and the bowler was at the point of delivering the ball, we shifted positions by a few yards, sometimes one way, sometimes the other. Occasionally, only one would move and sometimes none would move. [...] This eventually put him clean off his game.\\" The English captain Archie MacLaren agreed saying, \\"Ranji is in a blue funk\\". Regardless of the tactics, Ranji made 457 runs at an average of 50.77 for the Test series. Australia fought back to win the Second Test in Melbourne by an innings and 55 runs with Trott scoring 79 runs. The Third and Fourth Tests were both won by Australia as they retrieved The Ashes. The Fifth and final Test in Sydney would be Trott's last. In the Sydney heat, Australia won the Test by 6 wickets but Trott had an attack of sunstroke. This caused him to lose the sight in one eye before his last Test innings, where he made 18 runs. In a review of the Test series Wisden noted that \\"the Australians owed much to the unfailing skill and tact of Trott as a captain\\". During the course of the Test series, a major convention was in progress to discuss the proposed federation of the Australian colonies. However, the victory over England dominated the attention of the Australian public and some newspapers decried the focus on cricket when important matters were being discussed. Another editor remarked in defence of the public, \\"We believe that Harry Trott and his ten good men and true have done more for the federation of Australian hearts than all the big delegates put together.\\" In reply to complaints about leave granted to Trott to play cricket, his proud employers at the Post office responded \\"Harry Trott is a national institution.\\" Passers-by, including men and their families, would stop and look at Trott's home in Albert Park \\"with the deference of worshippers at a shrine\\", in the words of cricket writer Ray Robinson. The impetus for federation did not extend to the administration of cricket, however. The ACC continued to attract criticism for being ineffectual and at a meeting of the Victorian Cricket Association in July 1898, Trott (in his capacity as a delegate for the South Melbourne club) tabled a motion that Victoria secede from the ACC.Coleman (1993), p 186. Although the proposal was defeated by a single vote, Trott was one of twelve Test players who signed a letter to the ACC secretary calling for the disbanding of the organisation.Harte (2003), p 196. Failing to win the support of the players, the ACC folded in January 1900 following the withdrawal of the New South Wales Cricket Association.Harte (2003), p 202. Illness and recovery Less than six months after leading his team to victory over England, Trott endured a severe mental illness. While visiting his mother on 8 August 1898, Trott collapsed and lost consciousness. Later, on the train home with his wife, he had another convulsive fit and yet another at 10 pm that evening, in the presence of a doctor. Trott passed in and out of consciousness over the next four weeks, unable to work or even communicate. His supporters raised ¬£453 to send him for two weeks at a private retreat at Woodend, a small town north- west of Melbourne. The treatment was unsuccessful and Trott continued to suffer from insomnia, memory loss and apathy. Hospitalisation Kew Asylum, circa 1885‚Äì1887‚Äîaround ten years before Trott's commitment Because Trott's illness precluded his selection for the 1899 Australian team to England, the Australian captaincy passed to Joe Darling. On 8 May 1899, Trott was committed to the Kew Asylum, a psychiatric hospital in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne. The facility opened in 1871 during an era when large asylums were in vogue. By the time of Trott's admission, expert opinion had changed; in January 1898 The Argus reported a specialist's claim that the asylum was likely to make a patient, \\"just mad enough to be put under restraint\\"‚Äîthat is, worse rather than better. Trott was recorded as suffering \\"dementia\\" and \\"alcoholism\\", although there is little empirical evidence for either diagnosis. Cricket writer Gideon Haigh suggests that his symptoms would possibly be identified in modern times as depressive psychosis and treated with antipsychotics or electroconvulsive therapy. Doctors observed that Trott continually stood in one place, showing little interest in events around him. A doctor noted on Trott's file: \\"Refuses to converse not appearing to be able to follow what is said to him. Answers questions in monosyllables. Does not rouse up when subjects are spoken of that formerly he was interested in.\\" Attempting to reach him, doctors sent Trott to play cricket, which he did in a \\"mechanical, indifferent fashion\\". In a departure from normal hospital procedure, he was allowed newspapers reporting the details of Darling's Australian side in England; this left him unmoved. Trott's friend Ben Wardill, the secretary of the Melbourne Cricket Club, visited in November 1899 but Trott did not recognise him. A fellow patient, when released, wrote of Trott: \\"Here is a well-known cricketer, whom we once treated as a hero. But alas! Like everything else, times have changed and he is almost forgotten.\\" Return to cricket In February 1900, Trott played in a cricket match for the asylum team against the North Melbourne Rovers club. To the astonishment of his treating doctors and his teammates, he scored 98 runs in 40 minutes, including 20 fours and a six. While the doctors remained cautious about his chances of recovery, Trott played in further matches against other visiting teams and in April 1900, he took a hat-trick against a team from the Commercial Travellers Association. Declared to be \\"recovered\\", Trott was discharged after spending 400 days at Kew Asylum. He returned to the South Melbourne team and captained Victoria against Tasmania at Launceston (taking eight wickets) during the 1900‚Äì01 season, but otherwise failed to recapture the form that made him captain of his country. To aid his convalescence, the Postmaster-General's Department‚ÄîTrott's employer‚Äîtransferred him to the post office at Bendigo in central Victoria.Perry, p. 75. In 1902‚Äì03, he turned up uninvited to a Bendigo United Cricket Club practice session and asked to join in. He played five first-class matches during 1903‚Äì04, scoring 268 runs at an average of 26.80 and taking 13 wickets at 23.53 runs each. In his final appearance of the season, he led Victoria against Plum Warner's touring English team. He captained the Carlton club for two seasons, before spending two seasons with Fitzroy. During the 1907‚Äì08 season, he led XVIII of Bendigo against the touring English team and made a farewell first-class appearance against the tourists for Victoria. Opening the bowling, Trott returned 5/116, including the wickets of England's leading batsmen Jack Hobbs and George Gunn. Trott later returned to South Melbourne, where he played until the age of 44. He led the club on a tour of New Zealand in 1912‚Äì13 and in the next season (his last) he topped the club's batting and bowling averages, for the fifth time as a batsman and the third time as a bowler. Personal life Recent photo of Trott's house, where passers-by stopped to look \\"with the deference of worshippers at a shrine\\" Trott spent his entire working life in the Post Office, employed as a postman and mail sorter. He married Violet Hodson in Fitzroy on 17 February 1890 and the couple had one son. In 1911, Trott became a selector for the Victorian team when Hugh Trumble resigned to take the secretaryship of the Melbourne Cricket Club. Trott's high standing in the cricket community saw the other candidate for the position withdraw rather than oppose him.Haigh (2001), p. 222. In 1912, Trott took the side of the \\"Big Six\\", the Australian cricketers opposed to the newly formed Australian Board of Control for International Cricket's attempt to wrest control of touring Australian sides from the players. At an \\"indignation meeting\\" at the Athenaeum Hall on Collins Street in Melbourne, the Argus reported Trott as saying that \\"to say he was disgusted with the Board of Control was to put it mildly\\" and that \\"[h]e would like to shake hands with the six men who had stood out against the Board\\".Haigh (2001), p. 232. At the age of 51, Trott died of Hodgkin's lymphoma, at his home in inner-suburban Albert Park on 9 November 1917. He was buried at Brighton Cemetery where, two years later, a large monument was erected over his grave, paid for by the Victorian Cricket Association and cricket enthusiasts.Coleman (1993), p 292. His great-grandson, Stuart Trott, played 200 games for St Kilda and Hawthorn in the Victorian Football League between 1967 and 1977.Main, p. 441. The South African-born English cricketer Jonathan Trott says he is a distant relation to Harry and Albert Trott. Trott's role in Australian cricket was recognised by the clubs for which he had played. Until 2005, Trott's club team, South Melbourne Cricket Club was based at Harry Trott Oval in Albert Park, while Bendigo United Cricket Club, for whom Trott played in 1902, still play at the Harry Trott Oval in the Bendigo suburb of Kennington. Context An innings-by- innings breakdown of Trott's Test match batting career, showing runs scored (red bars) and the average of the last 10 innings (blue line). Playing style The authoritative cricket journal Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, in an obituary, wrote \\"Australia has produced greater cricketers than Harry Trott, but in his day he held a place in the front rank of the world's famous players. He was a first-rate bat, a fine field at point, and his leg breaks made him a very effective change bowler.\\" As a batsman, Trott scored his runs mostly in front the wicket. He often lifted his on-drives and was an exponent of the late cut. George Giffen said of Trott, \\"On a good wicket, I have seen Harry Trott adopt forcing tactics worthy of the big hitter, and in the very next match play keeps on a difficult pitch with wonderful skill.\\"Pollard (1988), pp. 1068‚Äì1069. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack described Trott as \\"one of the soundest [Australian batsman], combining as he does vigorous hitting with a strong, watchful defence\\". Trott was able to obtain turn from all types of pitches bowling his loopy leg spinners, through varying his pace and flight. He was noted for giving young batsmen a full toss on the leg side, allowing the batsman to hit it to the boundary. The next ball would seem identical, but for a subtle change in the position of a fielder, resulting in a catch and the comment, \\"That first ball was to give you confidence, son. The second to teach you a lesson.\\"Haigh (2001), p. 24. Warwick Armstrong, a childhood admirer and later teammate of Trott, said \\"Trott had an almost uncanny knowledge of batsman who were likely to succumb to his wiles and after he had met with a success, he would at once take himself off and put on some other bowler of a different type.\\"Haigh (2001), p. 25. Wisden thought his bowling was \\"too slow to be effectual against good batsmen\\" and \\"that though he may now and then get a wicket, runs are sure to come at the rate of six or eight an over\\". Clem Hill said, \\"As a captain Harry Trott was in a class by himself‚Äîthe best I ever played under. Harry was quick to grasp a situation. He saw an opponent's weakness in a second. [...] Time and time again, he got a champion batsman's wicket by putting on a bowler he knew the batsman did not like.\\" The English batsman K. S. Ranjitsinhji considered Trott as a captain \\"without a superior anywhere today\\". Wisden thought him, \\"with the exception of [Billy Murdoch] ... incomparably the best captain the Australians had ever had in this country.\\" The sporting newspaper The Referee wrote, \\"[Trott's] bowlers felt he understood the gruelling nature of their work and that they had his sympathy in the grimmest of battles.\\" Some English professional cricketers thought less of Trott's captaincy; wicket-keeper William Storer said, \\"I like a captain to have a settled plan, [Trott] just seemed to do whatever he thought of at the moment.\\" Personality Trott's sense of humour was well known. He originated a persistent myth that workers at the Sheffield steelworks generated extra plumes of smoke when the Australians were batting at nearby Bramall Lane, in order to reduce the quality of the light. When Australia played the Gentlemen of Philadelphia in the United States, a local reporter asked Trott why Australians did not play baseball. He replied: \\"Running around in circles makes us giddy.\\" When Trott, a humble postman, met the Prince of Wales (later Edward VII) in 1896, his teammates admired his natural ease of manner in the presence of royalty. Given a cigar by the Prince, Trott simply smoked it, to the surprise of those who thought a royal souvenir worth keeping. With this in mind, Trott later played a practical joke when he returned home. Gathering cigar butts on board the ship before disembarking in Australia, he distributed them to his friends claiming it was the one given to him by the Prince of Wales; he asked the recipients not to tell others in case it provoked jealousy. Trott was extremely fond of hats; a teammate described him as \\"... the only man I have seen who, in the nude, had to have a hat on his head\\". Jack Pollard wrote \\"It was said that [Trott] never made an enemy and was universally admired.\\" His rival, England captain Archie MacLaren said \\"I would give anything to play the game as keenly and yet as light-heartedly as Trott's lads did.\\"Pollard (1986), p. 140. He was \\"imperturbable, good- humoured ... few Australian captains have been better liked and respected\\". NotesReferences   * *Perry, Roland (2000).

The solutions of a first-order differential equation of a scalar function y(x) can be drawn in a 2-dimensional space with the x in horizontal and y in vertical direction. Possible solutions are functions y(x) drawn as solid curves. Sometimes it is too cumbersome solving the differential equation analytically. Then one can still draw the tangents of the function curves e.g. on a regular grid. The tangents are touching the functions at the grid points. However, the direction field is rather agnostic about chaotic aspects of the differential equation. Definition=Standard case The slope field can be defined for the following type of differential equations :y'=f(x,y), which can be interpreted geometrically as giving the slope of the tangent to the graph of the differential equation's solution (integral curve) at each point (x, y) as a function of the point coordinates. It can be viewed as a creative way to plot a real-valued function of two real variables f(x,y) as a planar picture. Specifically, for a given pair x,y, a vector with the components [1, f(x,y)] is drawn at the point x,y on the x,y-plane. Sometimes, the vector [1, f(x,y)] is normalized to make the plot better looking for a human eye. A set of pairs x,y making a rectangular grid is typically used for the drawing. An isocline (a series of lines with the same slope) is often used to supplement the slope field. In an equation of the form y'=f(x,y), the isocline is a line in the x,y-plane obtained by setting f(x,y) equal to a constant. General case of a system of differential equations Given a system of differential equations, :\\\\frac{dx_1}{dt}=f_1(t,x_1,x_2,\\\\ldots,x_n) :\\\\frac{dx_2}{dt}=f_2(t,x_1,x_2,\\\\ldots,x_n) :::\\\\vdots :\\\\frac{dx_n}{dt}=f_n(t,x_1,x_2,\\\\ldots,x_n) the slope field is an array of slope marks in the phase space (in any number of dimensions depending on the number of relevant variables; for example, two in the case of a first-order linear ODE, as seen to the right). Each slope mark is centered at a point (t,x_1,x_2,\\\\ldots,x_n) and is parallel to the vector :\\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ f_1(t,x_1,x_2,\\\\ldots,x_n) \\\\ f_2(t,x_1,x_2,\\\\ldots,x_n) \\\\ \\\\vdots \\\\ f_n(t,x_1,x_2,\\\\ldots,x_n) \\\\end{pmatrix}. The number, position, and length of the slope marks can be arbitrary. The positions are usually chosen such that the points (t,x_1,x_2,\\\\ldots,x_n) make a uniform grid. The standard case, described above, represents n=1. The general case of the slope field for systems of differential equations is not easy to visualize for n>2. General application With computers, complicated slope fields can be quickly made without tedium, and so an only recently practical application is to use them merely to get the feel for what a solution should be before an explicit general solution is sought. Of course, computers can also just solve for one, if it exists. If there is no explicit general solution, computers can use slope fields (even if they aren‚Äôt shown) to numerically find graphical solutions. Examples of such routines are Euler's method, or better, the Runge‚ÄìKutta methods. Software for plotting slope fields Different software packages can plot slope fields.

Hezekiah Ochuka was the centre of the August 1, 1982 attempted coup, which the then president Daniel Arap Moi survived in less than a day. The 29-year-old was a Grade 1 ‚Äì the second lowest rank in the military. Hezekiah was an unapologetic individual who assumed the title of chairman of a so-called \\"People's Redemption Council\\" that planned to replace President Moi. Hezekiah's military knowledge and connections made it manageable for him to form a military heist on the Kenyan Government. Hezekiah was not successful in his attempt to completely overthrow his homelands government; but he did manage to have control of the whole country of Kenya for six hours. Early life and career Ochuka, of the Luo Nation was born in Nyakach, Kisumu District. After attending Naki kabete Primary School and Mirogi Secondary School, Ochuka was recruited into the Kenya Air Force on September 14, 1976 in Mombasa. Hezekiah was raised by a single mother and his three older brothers. Being around a majority of men Hezekiah was always influenced by masculinity being that he was raised by his older brothers when a majority of the time the mother was working hard labor jobs to provide for the a family of four boys. He underwent eight weeks of military training at Lanet Army Barracks in Nakuru, and was posted to Eastleigh Air Base. Between 1976 and 1978, he underwent basic trade training in electrical devices and instruments[citation needed], and worked in hangars and bays. From October 30, 1978 to January 21, 1980, he attended a course in RAF Cosford, UK, after which he worked as a Senior Private Grade-I, the second lowest rank in Kenya's military. The Coup On August 1, 1982, Ochuka ruled Kenya for approximately 6 hours, after he led a group of low ranked Air Force servicemen in a coup d'√©tat attempt. The country woke up in confusion as heavy gunfire filled the air. A group of rogue soldiers led by Ochuka had seized power at night after storming the National broadcaster V.O.K(now KBC) where they announced that they were now in charge of the country and were being fought by the loyal soldiers. They forced a group of Air Force fighter pilots to bomb the State House at gunpoint. The supposed \\"trusted\\" pilots pretended as if they were listening to orders given to them by their chief, but instead once in the air dropped bombs over Mount Kenya forests. President Moi later announced that loyal army and police units had crushed an attempted coup on his civilian government. The putsch was quickly suppressed by forces commanded by Chief of General Staff Mahamoud Mohamed, a veteran Somali military official. They included the General Service Unit (GSU) ‚Äî a paramilitary wing of the police ‚Äî and later the regular police. At least 9 civilians were killed and scores of casualties were reported at the three air force bases. Kenyan Hospitals reported that 50 civilians were treated for gunshot wounds. More than 300 air force personnel were later captured and detained but the colonel who led the coup (Ochuka) was still at large. Ochuka subsequently escaped to Tanzania. He was later extradited to Kenya along with a few more leading accomplices and found guilty in 1987.  After the Coup  After Hezekiah was captured from Tanzania he was then to be taken back to his home of Kenya to be tried and was found guilty of all charges against him and his team of low ranked air force men. Ogidi (one of Hezekiah's coup accomplices) was told that next morning that Hezekiah and Raila had been shot by the Air Force by accident. For that reason Ogidi was told to pick them up, not sure which one of the two took the initiative to make the call for help. This call ended up being a setup just to capture Ogidi himself. The end came shortly thereafter. Ogidi left the Ngong Road house and drove towards town and on reaching the Grosvenor Hotel, he then found a road block mounted by army personnel under the command of a Navy officer. Ogidi and Opwapo were arrested. Ogidi was taken to Army headquarters and Opwapo was later brought as well. At the time of arrest, Ogidi had (a sub-machine gun) and 32 rounds of ammo which were all taken by the army. Later, Ogidi was transferred to Kamiti Maximum Security Prison. Ochuka was hanged after being convicted of treason following a court martial as well Ogidi.

An all-rounder who batted in the middle order and often opened the bowling with medium-paced off-spin, Giffen captained Australia during the 1894‚Äì95 Ashes series and was the first Australian to score 10,000 runs and take 500 wickets in first-class cricket. He was inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame on 26 February 2008. Early life and career Giffen was born in the Adelaide neighbourhood of Norwood in 1859 to Richard Giffen, a carpenter and his wife Elizabeth (n√©e Challand). He played cricket with enthusiasm as a boy and attracted the notice of two brothers, Charles and James Gooden, who coached him. He started his cricket career with Norwood Cricket Club, later moving to the West Adelaide club.Pollard, pp. 467‚Äì469. Early in 1877 he played for South Australia against a visiting East Melbourne team making 16 and 14, the highest score in each innings, but South Australian cricket was then much below the standard of the two eastern colonies. In November 1877 he made his first-class cricket debut against Tasmania. Giffen made 47 runs and took 4 wickets for 16 runs in the Tasmanian first innings. Tasmania was forced to follow-on (bat twice in a row) and in the second innings Giffen managed to capture another 2 wickets. It was not until November 1880 that the first regular match between South Australia and Victoria took place at Melbourne. Giffen made 3 and 63 and took two wickets for 47 in the first innings. In the follow-up match in Adelaide later that season, Giffen took 5 wickets for 59 runs (5/59); Victoria won the match by 151 runs. He became a regular member of the South Australian team and although he took a few seasons to develop his full powers, if he failed as a bat he usually made up for it with a good bowling performance. Test cricket=Beginning Giffen, only 22 years old, made his Test debut in Melbourne against England in 1881‚Äì82. Having just joined the postal service, Giffen was almost hesitant to ask for leave.Robinson (1996) pp. 59‚Äì65. Giffen made 30 runs before being bowled by Tom Emmett but was unable to take a wicket. Left out of the side for the Second Test in Sydney, he returned for the Third Test. Australia won the match by five wickets by Giffen made only two runs and was not given a chance to bowl. In the final Test of the series, Giffen captured his first Test wicket‚ÄîWilliam Scotton stumped by Jack Blackham for 27. He took 2/17 and, with the bat, made 14 in a drawn match. Australia won the series two Tests to nil. Giffen was selected to tour England with the Australian team in 1882. He was moderately successful, taking 32 wickets at an average of 21.84 and making 699 runs averaging 19.02. In the celebrated match against England‚Äîlater designated a Test match‚ÄîGiffen made 2 runs in the first innings but was dismissed by Ted Peate for a \\"duck\\" in the second. Australia, through a magnificent bowling effort from Fred Spofforth and Harry Boyle, won the match by seven runs. The match was the origin of the term \\"The Ashes\\" for Test series between the two nations. A mock obituary placed in The Sporting Times lamented \\"the death of English cricket\\" and noted that \\"The body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia.\\"Pollard (1988), pp. 43‚Äì44. Ivo Bligh and his English team arrived in Australia in 1882‚Äì83 determined to win back \\"the Ashes\\". In the First Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, Giffen made 36 runs, his highest Test score to date. He followed this with his best figures with the ball, capturing 4/38 in the England second innings, helping Australia to a nine wicket victory. In the Second Test, Giffen made a \\"golden duck\\", dismissed first ball without scoring but took 4/89 in England's only innings; the English won the Test by an innings and 27 runs. Giffen was promoted to open the batting for the Third Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground, where he made 41 and 7 England won the Test by 69 runs, winning the first Ashes series 2‚Äì1. thumb In February 1884, Giffen became the first Australian to take all ten wickets in a first-class innings, taking 10/66 for an Australian XI against the Rest. Later that year, he was once again included in the Australian team to tour England, led by Billy Murdoch. The Australians lost the three Test series one Test to nil, but had the best of the two drawn matches.Wynne-Thomas (1989), p. 214. In the Second Test at Lord's, Giffen top- scored in the first innings, making 63 runs;. England won the Test by an innings and 5 runs. Giffen took 81 wickets in England at an average of 19.60, however he \\"tended to be expensive\\". His best batting performance for the tour was 118 against Lancashire; a match in which he also took a \\"hat-trick\\". An English team led by Alfred Shaw toured Australia in 1884‚Äì85 to contest the Ashes. England won the First Test by eight wickets but the match was overshadowed by a dispute between the teams; the Australian team wished a larger share of the match profits. As a result, most of the Australian team, including Giffen, made themselves unavailable for the next two Tests. This action was unpopular with the Australian public. Charles Kingston, then South Australian Attorney-General, said \\"the Australian eleven would have the reputation of having sacrificed the cricketing honour of their nation to monetary considerations\\". Giffen and the others returned for the Fourth Test in Sydney where Australia won by eight wickets; Giffen taking 7/117 in the England first innings. England won the Fifth Test by an innings and 98 runs, retaining the Ashes in a 3‚Äì2 series victory. Record breaker Giffen, in a sign of things to come, made a remarkable double for South Australia against Victoria in March 1886. He captured 17 wickets for the match‚Äîincluding 9/91 in the first innings‚Äîand made over 100 runs. Five years later, against Victoria in November 1891, he repeated the feat even more impressively, scoring 271 runs in South Australia's innings and taking 9/96 and 7/70 in Victoria's two innings. The Australian team touring England in 1886 did not meet with much success, losing all three Tests. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack remarked that \\"there is nothing to place the [Australians] on any higher standard than would have been attained by any good county team that went playing about the country\\". Giffen made only 60 runs for in the Tests and took only four wickets. In the other matches, however, Giffen was more successful. He made 1424 runs for the tour‚Äîonly Sammy Jones scored more for the Australians‚Äîand took 154 wickets, including five wickets in an innings no less than 13 times. George Giffen set the record for becoming the first player to complete the double of scoring 1000 runs and 100 wickets in Test history Style and legacy George Giffen's Test career batting graph. His first class performances include many achievements. Nine times he scored a century and took 10 wickets in the one match. Twice he scored a century and took more than a dozen wickets. No other cricketer in the world has ever done it. He is the only bowler in the world to snare 16 wickets in a match five times. He was the first to take 17. When he was 24 he became the first bowler outside England to get a whole side out with 10‚Äì66. He is the first Test cricketer to score 1000 runs and take 100 Test wickets. He is also the first Australian to take 1000 first-class wickets and score 10000 runs. Giffen's best figures were 271 runs and 16 wickets (9/96 and 7/70) for the match for South Australia vs. Victoria in 1891. In all he scored 18 first-class centuries, 4 of them doubles. Giffen also performed well in English conditions. On each of his five tours he topped both the batting and bowling overall tour averages, yet another unique Giffen feat. The great all rounder led Australia in four of the five Tests during 1894 tour. His 34 Test wickets was a series record at that time and he also scored the most runs for that series. Giffen played his last Test in 1896 but remained a force at the first-class level for some time, at the age of 41 he captured 13 English wickets to steer South Australia to a victory over the tourists. Three years later he finished his career with scores of 81, 97 not out and 15 wickets (7/75 and 8/110) against Victoria. Giffen was a robust batsman noted for his driving he also had a fine cut and glance. A slow to medium pace bowler he was brilliant with his deceptive off spin and the master in flight and changes of pace which he took many wickets. George though has often been accused of more than a sprinkling of nepotism, using his influence to try to help his brother Walter Giffen. Walter played Test cricket for Australia despite below average performances for South Australia and when George was named Captain of the 1894 tour Walter having made 11 runs in his three Tests to date and a poor domestic season was also named, many believing because of George's influence over the selection. He has also been accused of causing the demise of cricketer Charlie Turner who was the country's leading wicket taker at the time, and then, in the following test which Australia needed to win, opening the bowling with himself. George Giffen has a grandstand at the Adelaide Oval named after him. He died in Parkside, South Australia. In 2008 he was inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame Personal life Giffen also played Australian rules football at a high level, representing the Norwood Football Club for whom he is credited as kicking their first ever goal in the South Australian Football Association. \\"He would cap brilliant runs that paralysed all opposition with superb kicks, turning in a moment the whole tide of play.\\", an observer at the time said. He wrote an autobiography entitled With Bat and Ball.Barclay's World of Cricket ‚Äì 2nd Edition, 1980, Collins Publishers, , p576.

He served as the first President of Yeshiva College from 1915 until his death in 1940. The Bernard Revel Graduate School of Jewish Studies at Yeshiva University, as well as the former Yeshiva Dov Revel of Forest Hills, are named for him. Early years Revel was born in Prienai, a neighboring town of Kaunas, then part of the Russian Empire, now in Lithuania. He was a son of the community's Rabbi Nachum Shraga Revel. His father was his first teacher, and when Nachum Revel died in 1896 he was buried next to his close friend Rabbi Yitzchak Elchanan Spektor - indicative of his knowledge and stature. He briefly studied in Telz Yeshiva, attending the lectures of its Rosh Yeshiva Rabbi Yosef Leib Bloch. He was also taught by the renowned Rabbi Yitzchok Blazer and learned in the Kovno kollel. Revel received semicha at the age of 16, but it is not known from whom. Thereafter, the young scholar earned a Russian high school diploma, apparently through independent study. He also became involved in the Russian revolutionary movement, and following the unsuccessful revolution of 1905, was arrested and imprisoned. Upon his release the following year, he emigrated to the United States. United States Immediately after his arrival, Revel enrolled in New York's RIETS yeshiva. He received a master of arts degree from New York University in 1909. Around this time, one of America's senior rabbis and president of the Union of Orthodox Rabbis, Rabbi Bernard Levinthal of Philadelphia, visited the yeshiva and, after discussing Talmudic topics with the new student, invited him to come to Philadelphia as the rabbi's secretary and assistant. Revel accepted the post and began to familiarise himself with the alien milieu of American Jewry. At the same time, he began attending law school in Philadelphia, but eventually decided that the law was not his calling. In 1911, he earned a doctorate of philosophy from Dropsie College, the first graduate of that school; his thesis was entitled \\"The Karaite Halakhah and Its Relation to Sadducean, Samaritan, and Philonian Halakhah\\". In November 1908, Revel was introduced to his future wife, Sarah Travis of Marietta, Ohio, whom he married in 1909. The members of the Travis family were wealthy Oklahoma oil-men, and Rabbi Revel moved to Tulsa, Oklahoma to join the family business after finishing his doctorate. However, even while serving as an assistant to his brother-in-law Solomon in the petroleum business, and amassing his own fortune, Rabbi Revel's primary occupation continued to be his Torah study. RIETS and Yeshiva College In 1915, Harry Fischel, on the Board of Directors of the newly merged RIETS, asked Revel to come back East and head the institution. In him, Mr. Fischel saw a learned and forward thinking educator to lead the yeshiva on the path of becoming a college. Rabbi Revel took up the position and was appointed RIET's first president and Rosh yeshiva. Revel's Philosophy Revel's writings and students were most important to him. However, Revel never abandoned the role of scholar to become solely an administrator, though he was known by his students as one. His research illustrates a unique usage of pilpulistic and Talmudic investigation. It was his new halakhic-historic approach, of quoting even non-rabbinic sources, such as Josephus and Philo, for context that set him apart. Besides for his research, Revel channeled his intellect towards strengthening the foundation of Jewish Orthodoxy in America. He was most concerned with problems of maintaining traditional observance in the modern setting. He sought to build up an educational system for American Jewry where they would not feel alienated. In his speeches, Revel rarely, if ever, used difficult Torah language. Instead, he used very simple terms that were readily understandable. At a speech for the Rabbinic Council of America (RCA) Revel praised ‚Äúthe light of human reason‚Äù, and declared ‚Äúthe ascending spirit of mankind will triumph.‚Äù Revel consistently maintained that secular knowledge in Judaism was never separate from the study of Torah. He emphasized the importance of unifying Judaism and secular studies. Often speaking of the, ‚Äúharmonious union of culture and spirituality,‚Äù he believed that knowledge of the liberal arts would broaden one‚Äôs understanding of Torah. However, Revel's dedication to Orthodox Jewry was undisputed. For instance, he forbade the use of a female vocalist in the 1926 Music Festival, as a female singer is a violation of Orthodox Jewish law. He did not allow Reform Jews to serve on Yeshiva College‚Äôs national board of directors. He was also staunchly opposed to mixed seating in synagogues. He wrote: \\"Yeshiva aims at unity, at the creation of a synthesis between the Jewish conception of life, our spiritual and moral teaching and ideals, and the present-day humanities, the scientific conscience and spirit to help develop the complete harmonious Jewish personality, once again to enrich and bless our lives, to revitalize the true spirit and genius of historic Judaism.\\" One of Revel‚Äôs main reasons for founding RIETS and Yeshiva College was, ‚Äúso that these men may not be lost to us [through assimilation].‚Äù Revel wanted Yeshiva to become a place where American Jews could feel comfortable, take pride in their religion, and not be restricted by anti-Semitic sentiments. Revel also added Bible, Hebrew, and Jewish History to the curriculum in Yeshiva College. He did this for several reasons, although one of them was to outdo Jewish Theological Seminary, a non- orthodox institution, which did not have Bible studies at the time. Although Revel viewed the liberal arts as a way to educate and integrate Jews with Torah values, he perceived the sciences as too ‚Äúmechanistic‚Äù and ‚Äúsoulless‚Äù to be useful in integrating Judaism with secular culture. Karaite research Revel's primary scientific scholarly interest was Karaism. His constant study and research in this area developed from his Dropsie College doctoral dissertation, The Karaite Halakhah and its Relation to Sadducean, Samaritan, and Philonian Halakhah (1912). Earlier scholars like Simha Pinksker had aimed to show that Karaites \\"were the source of all intellectual achievement of medieval Judaism.\\" According to this school of thought, the Massorah, with its beginnings of grammatical and biblical exegesis, belongs to the Karaites; the Rabbanites were merely imitators. This notion was challenged by Revel. Revel was interested in the origin of Karaism, its causes and early development. He maintained that the question of the origin of Karaism is bound up with the problem of the origin of the Karaite halakha, which is of vital importance for understanding the history of Tradition. Revel essentially traced the individual Karaite laws to their respective sources. Other achievements Revel was a presidium member of the Union of Orthodox Rabbis from 1924, later being appointed its honorary president, and authored many articles on Jewish subjects in various Hebrew periodicals such as the Jewish Quarterly Review, Yagdil Torah, Ha-Pardes, and various Yeshiva student publications. He started writing a commentary to the Jerusalem Talmud in Philadelphia, but this was never published. He was an associate editor of Otzar Yisrael, the Hebrew Encyclopedia. In 1935 he became the first vice president of the Jewish Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1986, he appeared on a $1 U.S. Postage stamp, as part of the Great Americans Series.Scott catalog # 2194. U.S. engraver Kenneth Kipperman, who designed the stamp, was suspended for including a tiny Star of David, invisible to the naked eye, in Revel's beard.

The rokosz, formed on 5 August 1606 by Miko≈Çaj Zebrzydowski, Jan Szczƒôsny Herburt, Stanis≈Çaw Stadnicki, Aleksander J√≥zef Lisowski and Janusz Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç in Stƒô≈ºyca and Lublin, was caused by the growing dissatisfaction with the King among the nobility (the szlachta). In particular, the rebels disapproved of the King's efforts to limit the power of the nobles, his attempts to weaken the Sejm (the Polish parliament) and to introduce a hereditary monarchy in place of the elective one. The rebellion (1606‚Äì1608) ended in the defeat of the rebels. Despite the failure to overthrow the King, the rebellion firmly established the dominance of the szlachta over the monarch in the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian political system.  History  The Polish nobles gathered at the rokosz formed a konfederacja and outlined their demands in 67 articles. They demanded Sigismund III's dethronement for breaching the Henrician Articles, and the expulsion of the Jesuits from the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth. They further demanded that the Sejm appoint state officials instead of the king; that local officials should be elected and not appointed and that Protestant's rights should be expanded and protected. The 1607 Sejm rejected the demands. Meanwhile, the rebel nobles gathered in Guz√≥w. In 1607 the Royal Army, led by Hetman Jan Karol Chodkiewicz was sent to pacify the rebels. A full scale battle ensued on July 5/July 6 (sources vary), with 200 casualties, which resulted in the victory of the Royalist forces. 17th century depiction of the rebellion. By 1609, the rebellion was over. Two years after the start of the revolt, the rebellious nobles formally surrendered to the king at the 1609 meeting of the Sejm, which became known as the Pacification Sejm. In return for their surrender the rebels were granted leniency. Many royal supporters, including Hetman Chodkiewicz, had successfully argued for amnesty for the rebels. Despite the failure of the rebellion, it nevertheless ruined any chance that Sigismund III had to strengthen his role in the government. Polish historian Oskar Halecki wrote: :\\"The first rebellion in Polish history had sinister consequences. Royalty lost, to great extent, the moral prestige it had enjoyed... The Polish constitution was henceforth regarded as sacrosanct and the king had to renounce not only the idea of making any far-reaching changes in it, but even any reform.\\"Oskar Halecki, Antony Polonsky, A history of Poland, Routledge, 1978, , Google Print, p.144 After the rebellion, King Sigismund attempted to funnel the nobles' restless energy into external wars. This, combined with other factors, led to the official Commonwealth involvement in the Polish-Muscovite War (1609‚Äì18), which followed the Dimitriads (1605‚Äì09).

During his prolific career he painted well over a thousand works. Born in Detroit in 1926, Richard Kozlow's formal training was limited to his abbreviated studies at Cass Technical High School and the College for Creative Studies. After his 1946 discharge from the World War II US Navy, Kozlow spent two years painting and working in New York City. Although his work had achieved some success (and a favorable New York Times mention), he returned to Detroit to marry the love of his life and \\"get a job\\". At this time (as throughout his career), his paintings used materials in new ways, delving into the textures of old walls and peeling posters. He won (among others) the Museum Purchase prizes of the Detroit Institute of Arts and the Butler Art Institute. Mexico Despite a successful Detroit advertising career, winning creative awards and large salaries, in 1960 he left it all to live and paint in San Miguel de Allende, Mexico. Here he applied the new techniques he'd developed to creating the first of the misty mountain paintings which earned his international reputation. Thus began the pattern of the rest of Richard Kozlow's life. With stays in between in Detroit and many short journeys, he lived and painted in beautiful places. In Majorca, Spain in 1962. In England in 1965. In Costa Rica in 1975. In Portugal and Spain in 1977. And so forth. Each sojourn was followed by a successful show. And, while the Kozlow touch was unmistakable in every show, his methods continued to evolve. In the 1980s, he left his acrylics to achieve a new softness using oil paints. The allegorical \\"Soul of Mexico\\" paintings celebrated the spirit and the festivals of the Mexican people among whom he had lived so many times. Richard Kozlow has had exhibitions in every region of the US and several foreign countries. Although the beautiful Kozlow landscapes have always been much in demand by collectors, many of his most powerful works are black tempera depictions of bloody bullfights, holocaust victims, and his enigmatic mid-90s \\"Masks\\" series. Kozlow's work had always fallen into a middle and almost unique area: far too modern to describe him as a classic landscapist, yet too representational to put his paintings into a museum's modern wing. Recently there has been a renewed interest in Kozlow's works among art scholars, partly on the strength of his late-nineties paintings, complex self- portraits symbolizing the forces pressing on the life of a great artist.

The first of only two players born in Ireland to play Test cricket for Australia, Horan was the leading batsman in the colony of Victoria during the pioneering years of international cricket. He played for Australia in the game against England subsequently designated as the first Test match, before touring England with the first representative Australian team, in 1878. Four years later, he toured England for the second time and played in the famed Ashes Test match at The Oval. An aggressive middle-order batsman renowned for his leg-side play, Horan supplemented his batting by bowling medium-pace in the roundarm style common to his era, and once captured six wickets in a Test match innings. During a season disrupted by financial disputes and a strike by leading players, he captained Australia in two Test matches of the 1884‚Äì85 Ashes series, but lost both games. Horan's form peaked between the ages of 26 and 29 when he scored seven of his eight first-class centuries, including a score of 124 in a Test match on his home ground at Melbourne in January 1882. In 1879, Horan began writing a weekly newspaper column that continued until his death 37 years later. He established himself as the first Australian cricket writer who had played the game at the highest level, thus paving the way for many players to enter the media. Bill O'Reilly, the noted Australian player-writer of the twentieth century, described him as, \\"the cricket writer par excellence\\". Horan's documentation of the early years of Australian cricket are the basis for many works on the subject: Gideon Haigh wrote that any, \\"serious scholar in the field ... should probably acquaint himself with Tom Horan.\\" An anthology of his articles was published for the first time in 1989 when he was posthumously inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame for his writing. In part, his citation read, \\"... it was as the first nationally known cricket writer that he made his major contribution to the game.\\" Early years Born in the town of Midleton near the Irish city of Cork, Horan emigrated to Australia with his parents and siblings as a small child. In Melbourne, he attended Bell Street School in Fitzroy and formed a friendship with Jack Blackham; Blackham encouraged in Horan a love of cricket. Horan made his first-class debut for Victoria in the season of 1874/75. Test cricket=1st Test 1876‚Äì77 At age 23, Tom Horan was selected to play in the first Test between Australia and England in March 1877. Australia won the toss and elected to bat. After the fall of the first wicket, that of Nat Thomson, Horan made his way to the wicket. At 23 years 7 days old he was the youngest Test Cricketer at that time. He passed George Ulyett, the England No: 4, who was 2 years 138 days older than Tom Horan. When Jack Blackham, the Australia No: 8 Batsman, came out to bat Tom Horan dropped to 2nd youngest as Jack Blackham was 64 days younger. With Charles Bannerman (who would eventually retire hurt on 165), Horan put on 38 runs for the second wicket before he was dismissed for 12. In the second innings, the young batsman made twenty, the highest score in Australia's 104 all out. Australia won the historic match by 45 runs. Later Test career Although he was not selected to play in Second Test of the inaugural Test series, Horan did enjoy a regular place in the Australian Test team into the mid-1880s. His highest Test score of 124 was made in the First Test of the 1881/82 season against England. Horan toured England twice, in 1878 and 1882, but played only one Test in that country, at the Oval in 1882. Caricature of Horan in 1878 In 1884, the Australian Test team ‚Äì minus Horan ‚Äì demanded a significant pay rise. When organisers refused the request, the team went on strike. With the Second Test against England due to start in Melbourne, selectors were forced to choose an entirely new team. Horan was selected as captain. His team consisted on nine debutants (five of whom never played Tests again). Australia lost the Test by 10 wickets. In the following Test, Horan, having been stripped of his captaincy duties, made a significant impact with the ball, returning figures of 6/40 from 37.1 four-ball overs in England's first innings at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Horan played his final Test on 21 March 1885. He scored a duck in the first innings and made 20 in the second before being bowled by William Attewell, and bowled three wicketless overs for five runs as England took an innings victory. Writing He turned his attention to journalism, writing a regular cricket column for The Australasian, a weekly published by Melbourne's Argus newspaper. Haigh writes that Horan \\"was not an adventurous stylist: he wrote, instead, with his ears and eyes, with a sense of the telling remark and the evocative detail.\\" He never attached his own name to his writings, preferring to use the pseudonym \\"Felix\\". Horan continued contributing to The Australasian until his death in 1916. Personal life In May 1879, Horan married Kate Pennefather, the daughter of a Melbourne police officer. They had nine children. Two of Horan's sons played first-class cricket for Victoria in the early 1900s.

The college delivers awards in ministry and theology and was one of the first Australian non-university providers to offer an accredited bachelor's degree and a research doctorate. Over 16,000 people have graduated since the foundation of the college, one- third of these since 2006. It is a company limited by guarantee as of September 2007. The primate of the Anglican Church of Australia, Philip Freier, the Archbishop of Melbourne, presides as chairman at a general meeting of the Australian College of Theology Limited. He also served as the chair of the directors from 2002 until 2007. His successor was David Barr, who served as chair until 2014. Richard Cardew then served as chair until 2018, followed by Greg Hammond (Interim) until 2019. The current chair of the board is Roger Lewis. The current dean is Graeme Chatfield (Acting), following Martin Sutherland's retirement on 31 January 2020. History The college was established by the 1891 General Synod of the Church of England in Australia and Tasmania. The college was founded in order to provide for the \\"systematic study of divinity\\", especially among clergy and ordination candidates, there being In 1899, there were four awards of the College - the Associate in Theology, the Licentiate in Theology, the Scholar in Theology, and the Fellow of the College of Theology - and about 30 students. Today the College offers a wide range of accredited higher education awards catering not only for the specialised needs of ministerial and missionary candidates but also for the needs of lay people interested in an understanding of the Christian faith and its implications for contemporary life. The ACT is a national consortium of affiliated colleges with 16 theological and Bible colleges approved to deliver its accredited courses. Over 1,500 equivalent full-time students, or over 3,000 individual active students and research candidates, are enrolled in courses each year. On 12 November 2004, the delegate of the Minister for Education, Science and Training approved the college as a higher education provider (HEP) under the Higher Education Support Act 2003 (Cth). This approval took effect in March 2005. As a HEP, the ACT administers the FEE-HELP program, by which students enrolled in accredited higher education courses of the ACT may receive an income contingent loan for their tuition fees. In addition, as a HEP under the Higher Education Support Act, the ACT was required to undergo a quality audit conducted by the Australian Universities Quality Agency (AUQA). In November 2006, the college was the first non-self- accrediting HEP to be audited. The AUQA audit report was completed in January 2007 and publicly released on the AUQA website in February 2007. The process was repeated in 2011 and the college underwent a Cycle 2 quality audit by AUQA. The report of the audit was publicly released on the website of the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency in March 2012. In July 2010, the college received self-accrediting authority under the terms of the National Protocols for Higher Education Approval Processes. This authority was due to be reviewed by 30 April 2015. The college is the first institution to be awarded self-accrediting status under the protocols. This means that the college can accredit its own courses in theology and ministry within the scope of the self-accrediting authority specified by the Department of Education and Training in New South Wales.

He acquired his nickname during a cricket tour of England in 1884 from his love of London sightseeing tours which cost two pence or \\"tuppence\\". Scott was born in Toorak, Victoria, and soon moved to Melbourne, where he began to play cricket at a high level. He made his first- class debut in February 1878, and was soon chosen for the Australian team. By the time of the 1886 Australian tour of England, he had been appointed captain, but he remained in England at the tour's conclusion to pursue a career in medicine, and played no further first-class cricket. Scott began as a right arm fast-medium bowler and achieved his best analysis of six wickets for 33 runs on his first-class debut. But it was as a middle order batsman that Scott developed into an international player. He scored four first-class centuries, including one for Australia when he scored 102 at The Oval in 1884. Scott assumed the leadership of the Australian team following a dispute between English and Australian authorities which resulted in the dropping of Billy Murdoch, the Australian captain. However, the team which he led was afflicted by internal disputes over which he could exert no authority, and the tour was unsuccessful. Scott returned to Australia as a qualified medical practitioner. He retired from cricket and set up a practice in the rural New South Wales town of Scone, where he later served as mayor and chief magistrate. He died at Scone of typhoid in 1910. Early years Scott was born at Toorak, Victoria on 26 December 1858 to John and Elizabeth Scott. His father was secretary of the Melbourne Gas and Coke Company. Scott was educated at Wesley College and the University of Melbourne, from which he and two of his brothers graduated in medicine.Robinson, p. 49. Scott was spotted by Sam Cosstick, an influential figure in Victorian cricket, when playing for his college aged thirteen; Cosstick remarked: \\"That little nipper will make a good 'un!\\" Scott played successfully for St Kilda Cricket Club as a schoolboy. Fully grown, Scott was 5 ft 9 in (175 cm) tall and weighed 11 st 8 lb (73.6 kg). First-class career=Victoria: 1878‚Äì1884 Scott's obituary in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack said that \\"in his young days he was a fast bowler, but his reputation as a cricketer was gained entirely as a batsman\\". Scott made his first-class debut at the age of nineteen in February 1878 when he played for Victoria against New South Wales at the Association Ground in Sydney. He scored just 2 and 0 but distinguished himself as a fast-medium bowler in the New South Wales second innings by taking a career-best six for 33. His next match for the colony was not until March 1882 when he played against South Australia at the Adelaide Oval. South Australia won by 31 runs. Scott, who opened Victoria's first innings, scored 9 and 10. Wisden recorded that Scott's potential was first noticed in 1882 and he became a Victorian regular in the 1882‚Äì83 season. In the opening match of the 1883‚Äì84 season, Scott scored 114 not out against New South Wales at the Melbourne Cricket Ground and Wisden said this innings \\"was the main cause of his being given a place in the Australian team that came to England in 1884\\". 1884 tour of England Tup Scott pictured front right with the 1884 Australian cricket team Scott had a very successful tour in 1884 with Australian team, under the captaincy of Billy Murdoch. In its summary of the tour, Wisden said: \\"Scott (who had not visited England before) proved an emphatic success\\". Scott made only 12 in the First Test at Old Trafford but achieved large scores in the other two. In the Second Test at Lord's, he scored 75 and 31 not out. Wisden recorded that \\"Scott once more proved how well he merited a place in the team. He was admirably supported by Boyle, and before parting was effected 69 runs were put on for the last wicket. Scott played cool, confident, skilful cricket.\\". Commenting on Australia's second innings, Wisden said: \\"On the last day Scott made a gallant effort to save the innings defeat, but without avail. He was highest scorer in both innings of the Australians, and his total of 105 for once out was a very fine performance\\". When caught for 75 in the first innings, he became the first player to be dismissed by a substitute; the catcher was his own captain, Murdoch, who was fielding as a substitute for England. Scott scored 102 in the Third Test at The Oval. Wisden stated: \\"Scott was batting three hours and a half for his 102, out of 207 put on while he was in\\". His partnership of 207 with Murdoch for the third wicket was the first time a partnership of 200 had been achieved in a Test.Harte, p. 134. Among his other successes on the tour, Scott scored 82 not out against the Gentlemen at Lord's, 79 against Gloucestershire at Clifton College Close Ground and 65 in the second match against Gloucestershire at College Ground, Cheltenham. He appeared in 31 first-class matches on the tour, scoring 966 runs in 50 innings at an average of 23.00 with the one century and six half-centuries. He held 24 catches and took 3 wickets. During the tour, Scott acquired his nickname \\"Tup\\" through his love of London open-topped bus rides, each of which cost two pence, or \\"tuppence\\".Robinson, p. 50. Victoria: 1884‚Äì1886 Having returned to Melbourne in November 1884, Scott became embroiled in a dispute between the Australian team and a touring English team formed by James Lillywhite, Alfred Shaw and Arthur Shrewsbury. On 1 November, while the returning Australian team was still at sea, the Australian newspaper The Age reported that the English tourists \\"are not desirous of playing any matches in Australia against Murdoch's Eleven\\".Harte, p. 136. When the English team played Victoria later in the month, Scott was one of seven Victorians, all members of Murdoch's team, who refused to take part. Consequently, the Victorian Cricket Association suspended the players pending an inquiry. When the English team travelled to Sydney, the New South Wales contingent of Murdoch's team also refused to play. It was not until 27 December that details of the dispute became generally known when The Age published correspondence between Lillywhite and the Australians' manager George Alexander which revealed a disagreement about the share of the gate money from the first two Tests to be played in January and February. Members of the 1884 Australian team, including Scott, made up the entire home side in the First Test but boycotted the second match, forcing Australia replace the entire team. On 17 January 1885, The Australasian published an account written by Scott, Joey Palmer, Harry Boyle and Jack Blackham of alleged \\"underhand dealings\\" by John Conway who was representing the English team's interests.Harte, p. 137. In late February, Scott played in the third Test. Australia won by six runs but Scott failed. He was not selected for either of the two remaining Tests and played no further first-class cricket that season. Before the 1885‚Äì86 season began, the Melbourne Cricket Club announced that it was to send an Australian team to England in 1886. It was the first time the club had formed a touring party and the historian Chris Harte says it did so largely on the advice of Lord Harris, who convinced them a team with official club backing would be \\"far better received in England\\".Harte, p. 139. At a meeting of the Melbourne Cricket Club on 12 December 1885, it was announced that thirteen players including Tup Scott had agreed to form \\"the strongest all-round team available in the colonies\\".Harte, p. 140. Scott played three first-class matches in the 1885‚Äì86 season. He began with 111 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground for Victoria against New South Wales, which helped his team win by an innings and 69 runs. His good form continued with 74 for an Australian team against his home colony, the tourists winning by 10 wickets. But in the final match, playing for Victoria against New South Wales at the Association Ground, he was dismissed for 16 and 0 as his team lost by 150 runs. While playing cricket that season, Scott completed the third year of his medical course at Melbourne University. 1886 tour of England Tup Scott pictured 3rd left (front row) with the 1886 Australian cricket team The Melbourne Club was aware that, in the aftermath of the 1884‚Äì85 dispute, there were proposals in England to ban certain Australian players. The club decided to omit former captain Murdoch, Bannerman and Percy McDonnell from the team. This move caused widespread criticism, especially as Boyle, Tom Horan and Hugh Massie had already declared themselves unavailable. Scott, now aged 27, was chosen as captain.Harte, p. 141. In Wisden's view: \\"It was a misfortune for Scott ... Under happier circumstances he might have got on well, but fortune was against him\\". Harte comments that it was Scott's \\"misfortune in a way to be following the blazing success of Murdoch's captaincy with a team that looked good on paper but was, in fact, growing jaded\\". The tour was a great disappointment for Australian cricket. The team won only nine of its 39 matches and were soundly beaten in the Test series, but the real difficulty was the indiscipline of some players.Harte, p. 142. According to Wisden, quarrels began among the players during the opening match at Sheffield Park, Uckfield and Scott had \\"neither the strength of character nor the experience as a leader that the difficulties of his position demanded\\". Scott and the team manager Ben Wardill spent a lot of time adjudicating quarrels and the stress of the captaincy impacted Scott's performances as a batsman. The 1887 edition of Wisden bemoaned the absence of Murdoch, saying: \\"W. L. Murdoch, who was chief in the field of the three teams of 1880, 1882, and 1884, may not have exhibited all the qualities which go to make up that rare and valuable being, an ideal captain ‚Äì but he certainly had a larger experience and a stronger will than the gentleman who, with the best of intentions, and the greatest sincerity of purpose, led the team of 1886\\". Tup Scott's Test career batting graph. England won the First Test at Old Trafford by four wickets. Wisden called it a \\"remarkable match\\" and described Scott's innings of 47 in the second innings as \\"capital batting\\". This was the closest Australia came to beating England in the series and Wisden said \\"they made a splendid fight of it\\". In the Second Test at Lord's, Australia had two low totals and were well beaten, Wisden remarking that \\"the Australians thus suffered a most crushing and decisive defeat by an innings and 106 runs\\". Wisden commented on the poor form of the Australians in the third Test which meant \\"England was left with another decisive victory, by an innings and 217 runs\\". W. G. Grace made his highest Test score of 170 after he was dropped by Scott when he had scored only six runs. Scott made only 110 runs in his six Test innings at 18.33 including his highest score of 47 at Old Trafford. But Australia's batting was poor with only one half-century scored for the team in the series. Scott played some good innings and totalled 1,278 runs on the tour at an average of 22.03 with a best score of 123 against Middlesex at Lord's. In an innings of 67 not out against Yorkshire at Bramall Lane, Sheffield he scored 22 runs in one four-ball over from Saul Wade, which is still the record for the most runs scored of a four-ball over in first-class cricket history. Retirement At the end of the tour, Scott decided to remain in England to complete his qualification as a medical practitioner. On his return to Australia, he went into medical practice and retired from cricket.Harte, p. 143. Years later, Scott was asked if he would have liked to continue playing and he replied: \\"I have captained Australia and hit a Test century. Many would have liked two such honours as these\\". Scott made 85 first-class appearances of which only 17 were in Australia; he played 68 times on his two tours of England. The cricket writer Ray Robinson suggests that Scott's batting \\"was noted for grit rather than gaiety\\" but he did sometimes reveal an adventurous streak as shown when he landed a ball from A. G. Steel onto the pavilion roof at The Oval and by his assault on Saul Wade's bowling at Bramall Lane. In 1884, England found that Scott was the hardest man to bowl out in the Australian team. Later years Scott began his medical career in June 1888 as a surgeon at the mines in the East Australian Cordillera. In July, he married Mary Minnie Mickle at St Kilda, Victoria and they eventually settled at Scone, New South Wales; Robinson wrote that Scott \\"undertook the life of a pioneer country doctor with a spirit service that won him even greater esteem than (his) Test deeds\\".Robinson, p. 51. Scott is said to have dealt with unpaid accounts by ruling them out of his books. He was elected mayor of Scone and held office for three years, also serving as the town's chief magistrate. On 23 September 1910, Tup Scott died of typhoid. When a new hospital opened in Scone, the townspeople named it the Scott Memorial Hospital.

He is famous for an armed rebellion against King Sigismund III Vasa, the Zebrzydowski Rebellion, a rokosz named after himself. It took place in 1606, and was defeated by 1607. After the failed rebellion, he sponsored the creation of the Roman Catholic monastery of Kalwaria Zebrzydowska, which is regarded as one of the most important pilgrimage sites of Poland. Miko≈Çaj Zebrzydowski is one of the personas on the famous painting by Jan Matejko: Skarga's Sermon. Biography=Early life Zebrzydowski was born in 1553 in Krak√≥w, into a family which became powerful and influential in the second half of the 16th century. His grandfather Jan Zebrzydowski (died probably 1538) was a royal rotmistrz. His father Florian, who died in 1566, was a castellan of O≈õwiƒôcim and Lublin, and a court hetman. Florian Zebrzydowski authored a book on military discipline, titled Poruczenie wojenne. Miko≈Çaj's mother, Zofia (n√©e Dzik), came from a petty szlachta family. Miko≈Çaj was their only known child. From 1565 to 1569 he attended a jesuit collegium at Braniewo. He took part in wars of Stefan Batory against Gda≈Ñsk (1577), and against the Tsardom of Russia. In the Livonian campaign of Stephen B√°thory, Miko≈Çaj Zebrzydowski was the rittmeister of a 150-strong hussar regiment. He fought in several battles in that conflict, after which in 1582 returned to Poland. Probably due to protection of Jan Zamoyski, he was nominated the starosta of Stƒô≈ºyca, and in 1585, was named the starosta of Krak√≥w. In 1583 he married Zofia (n√©e Herburt), with whom he had two kids, son Jan Zebrzydowski (husband of Barbara Lubomirska), and daughter Zofia. His wife died in 1610. Politics During the 1587 free royal election, he supported Sigismund Vasa, and financially supported Vasa's faction in the War of the Polish Succession (1587‚Äì88). After the conflict, he was named Voivode of Lublin and court hetman. In 1595, Zebrzydowski participated in Jan Zamoyski's raid to Moldova, and in 1601, was promoted to the title of Voivode of Krak√≥w. In ca. 1605, he became dissatisfied with King Zygmunt's attempts to strengthen royal power and weaken the nobility. The King tried to reform the administration and the treasury, also to create a permanent army. Zebrzydowski opposed it, as in his opinion, royal plans were a threat to the so-called Golden Liberty. \\"Skarga's Sermon\\" by Jan Matejko. Zebrzydowski is standing in the center, left to the man in the golden robe. Rebellion An opposition to the king have led to a rokosz during 1606-1608, with Zebrzydowski among its leaders. Zebrzydowski first voiced his opposition during a Krak√≥w Voivodeship sejmik in Proszowice (16 February 1606). He stated that in order to restrain the King and control the Sejm, the nobility had to gather near Warsaw, adding that the homeland was in danger. His speech was warmly welcomed, and on 23 February, the sejmik of Lesser Poland, which took place in Nowy Korczyn, rejected royal plans, urging the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian nobility to concentrate at Stƒô≈ºyca, on 9 April. Since the rebellious nobility, gathered at Stƒô≈ºyca, had no idea how to fight the King, another meeting was called in Lublin, on 5 June. There, the nobility called a meeting at Sandomierz (6 August), while royal supporters gathered in nearby Wi≈õlica. Both camps wrote lists of their demands, called the Wi≈õlica Bills and the Sandomierz Bills. After King's rejection of the Sandomierz Bills, the rebels called for a pospolite ruszenie, and the two camps faced each other at Janowiec, where leaders of the rebellion, Miko≈Çaj Zebrzydowski and Janusz Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç, apologized to the King (8 October 1606). The rebellion, however, did not end, as news of it reached Greater Poland. On 14 February 1607, local nobility gathered at a sejmik in Ko≈Ço urged their Lesser Polish brethren to complete the rebellion, and to meet on 28 March in Jƒôdrzej√≥w. By that time, however, the rokosz lost its momentum, and the rebel camp was first moved to WƒÖchock, then to Sieciech√≥w, and finally to Czersk. On 24 June 1607, near Jeziorna (pl), the rebels renounced their allegiance to the King. On 5 July 1607 they were defeated in the Battle of Guz√≥w, which ended the rokosz. Zebrzydowski himself made his peace with the King on 24 August 1608 in Krak√≥w. Final years After the rebellion, Zebrzydowski continued to participate in political life of Poland. He did not fight in the Polish‚ÄìMuscovite War (1605‚Äì18), instead sending a few hundred of soldiers to guard the Transilvanian border against the possible invasion of Gabriel Bathory. He also appeared at the Sejms in 1613 and 1615, publicly supporting the King. After his death in 1620, he was buried in a Benedictine habit.

Later, however, he unexpectedly \\"changed the front\\" and escaped with his army. In 1603 Stadnicki attacked Konstanty Korniakt from Bia≈Çobok to whom he owed a large fortune. He invaded the villages of Krzemienica, Czarna and Albigowa, which were pledged, plundered the peasants and burned the farms. During the invasion of So≈õnica, Stadnicki plundered all the goods gathered there and captured Korniakt, whom he transported to ≈Åa≈Ñcut , keeping his castle in the dungeons for half a year, until he and his mother and brother signed a settlement waiving their claim to damanges from his invasion of So≈õnica. During the court in Przeworsk, Stadnicki tried to kill two Korniakt's legal advisors: Adam ≈ªydowski and Andrzej ≈öwidnicki, who miraculously escaped from the city. He waged a private war with the staroste of Le≈ºajsk, ≈Åukasz Opali≈Ñski . Opali≈Ñski captured his residence in ≈Åa≈Ñcut together with the city in 1608. Stadnicki, however, in retaliation took Opali≈Ñski's residence together with the city of Le≈ºajsk. Eventually near Tarnawiec , where 6,000 people were gathered, on August 14, 1610, he lost to Opali≈Ñski. He died in retreat after the battle, and with him about half a thousand of his soldiers. He had hidden in the forest but when he carelessly leaned out from behind the logs of wood he was noticed by the Cossacks. Stadnicki was finished by Tatar Persa. After his death, 10 wounds from punches and sword thrusts were calculated on his body. Opali≈Ñski regretted that Stadnicki was not taken alive, but he rewarded Persa, who received ennoblement and surname Macedonian at the next parliament. Legend has it that Stadnicki's severed head was brought to Lublin by one of the suitors of the beautiful Miss Regina ≈ªegocianki, to win her heart and carry her stuck in the pole after Lublin.  Stadnicki in Art  Stanis≈Çaw Stadnicki is one of the characters on the painting by Jan Matejko: Kazanie Skargi (The Sermon of Piotr Skarga).

A specialist wicket-keeper, Blackham played in the first Test match at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in March 1877 and the famous Ashes Test match of 1882. Such was his skill in the position that he revolutionised the art of wicket-keeping and was known as the \\"prince of wicket-keepers\\". Late in his career, he captained the Australian team. Early life Blackham was born in the inner-Melbourne suburb of Fitzroy North, the son of newsagent Frederick Kane Blackham and his wife Lucinda (n√©e McCarthy). Blackham became a bank clerk, and held a position in the Colonial Bank of Australasia for many years. It is said that his thick dark beard, perceived then as a sign of an equable and reliable nature, reassured his customers. His brother-in-law was George Eugene \\"Joey\\" Palmer. Cricket career Blackham was included in the first eleven of the Carlton Cricket Club as a batsman at the age of sixteen. He first appeared for the Victorian team in 1874, and remained an automatic selection as the team's wicket-keeper for over twenty years. He was a member of the first eight Australian cricket teams to visit England. He was one of the first wicket-keepers to stand up close to the stumps, even to the fastest bowlers, wearing gloves that Jack Pollard describes as \\"little more than gardening gloves\\". He eliminated the need for a long-stop, and Pollard says that \\"... in England on one of his trips there a group of clergymen complained that he was a danger to the wellbeing of cricket, encouraging as he did the abolition of long-stop, the clergy's traditional fielding spot in village teams.\\" Blackham was selected for the very first Test match, held at Melbourne in March 1876/77. Australia's leading bowler Fred Spofforth refused to play in the match, because Blackham was preferred to Spofforth's New South Wales teammate Billy Murdoch. In the Test match, Blackham took three catches and made the first Test-Match stumping, when he dismissed Alfred Shaw off the bowling of Tom Kendall in England's second innings. In 1878, he represented his country for the first time overseas, as a member of the inaugural Australian cricket team to tour England and North America. Described by teammates as the \\"prince of wicket-keepers\\" and one of Australia's first cricketing heroes, \\"Black Jack\\" Blackham (nicknamed for his dark beard) was Australia's regular wicket-keeper from 1877 to 1894. Test career Jack Blackham spent most of the 1st day of the 1st Test Match in the Home Dressing Room as he was batting at No: 8. He made his Test debut when Ned Gregory, Australia' No: 7 achieved the dubious distinction of being the 1st Test Batsman to score a duck. Australia were 143 for 6. He became Charles Bannerman's 7th partner (Bannerman was 107 not out). Jack Blackham was 22 years 308 days old and became, at that time the youngest Test player in Test cricket. Previously the youngest had been Tom Horan (Australia No: 3) who was 64 days older than Jack Blackham. His final Test As a right-hand batsman, Blackham was a useful lower-order player. At the age of forty, he played his last Test Match at the SCG against Andrew Stoddart's English team. As Blackham spun the coin on that opening morning, \\"Stoddy\\" remarked, \\"Someone will be swearing directly, Jack. I hope it's you.\\" Blackham at the stumps It was not: Blackham won the toss and elected to bat, and made 74 runs in a partnership of 154 with Syd Gregory, who scored 201. This helped Australia on its way to a massive (and apparently unassailable) total of 586. After England followed on, Blackham's men were eventually left to make just 176 in the final innings to win. They had scored 113 for the loss of just two wickets at the close of play on the fifth evening, but it rained hard during the night. Jack Blackham's Test career batting graph. Blackham's veteran teammate George Giffen, however, slept right through the storm and was blissfully unaware of it when he got up the following morning, a bright and sunny one. Giffen greeted his captain cheerily at breakfast but was met with a face as \\"long as a coffee-pot\\". Blackham told him what had happened and forecast ominously the danger as the Australian team travelled to the ground, the carriage leaving deep furrows in the moist turf. Blackham was right to be so concerned: on a horrific \\"sticky dog\\", his side eventually collapsed to 166 all out, losing the match by ten runs. At the close, with the Englishmen celebrating, \\"Blackham walked up and down the balcony like a caged tiger, muttering 'Cruel luck ‚Äì cruel luck'.... In short, the team were thoroughly cut up seeing victory thus snatched away.... 'The rain beat us,' said some of them.\\" \\"No!\\" retorted the Prince of Wicketkeepers. \\"The sun beat us\\" ‚Äì which was probably closer to the mark. Blackham injured himself in this match and never played Test cricket or kept wickets again. Summary In his 35 Tests, which included Australia's first seventeen Tests, Blackham made 800 runs at an average of 15.68 (highest score of 74), and dismissed 60 batsmen (36 caught, 24 stumped). In 45 matches for Victoria he scored 1600 runs at 22.85, with one century (109 in 1884), and dismissed 451 batsmen. However, his value as a batsman cannot be judged by averages, as he was often at his best when the game was at a critical stage. He was not a success as a captain as he worried too much when off the field. After his retirement in 1895 a match for his benefit was arranged, and an annuity was bought with the proceeds. He captained Australia in eight matches, winning three. His nervous temperament meant that he worried over small setbacks, and could not bear to watch close finishes. Blackham was also a leading Australian rules footballer for Fitzroy Football Club in the Victorian Football Association (VFA) during the 1880s.Atkinson, G. (1982) Everything you ever wanted to know about Australian rules football but couldn't be bothered asking, The Five Mile Press: Melbourne. . p. 182. Blackham later invested his earnings from his tours of England, without success. A lifelong bachelor, he died in Melbourne, Victoria with his funeral proceeding from St Paul's Cathedral to the Melbourne Crematorium the next morning.  Recognition  In 1996 he was made one of the ten inaugural inductees into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame, the others being Fred Spofforth, Victor Trumper, Clarrie Grimmett, Bill Ponsford, Sir Donald Bradman, Bill O'Reilly, Keith Miller, Ray Lindwall, and Dennis Lillee.

Linear codes are traditionally partitioned into block codes and convolutional codes, although turbo codes can be seen as a hybrid of these two types. Linear codes allow for more efficient encoding and decoding algorithms than other codes (cf. syndrome decoding). Linear codes are used in forward error correction and are applied in methods for transmitting symbols (e.g., bits) on a communications channel so that, if errors occur in the communication, some errors can be corrected or detected by the recipient of a message block. The codewords in a linear block code are blocks of symbols that are encoded using more symbols than the original value to be sent. A linear code of length n transmits blocks containing n symbols. For example, the [7,4,3] Hamming code is a linear binary code which represents 4-bit messages using 7-bit codewords. Two distinct codewords differ in at least three bits. As a consequence, up to two errors per codeword can be detected while a single error can be corrected. This code contains 24=16 codewords. Definition and parameters A linear code of length n and rank k is a linear subspace C with dimension k of the vector space \\\\mathbb{F}_q^n where \\\\mathbb{F}_q is the finite field with q elements. Such a code is called a q-ary code. If q = 2 or q = 3, the code is described as a binary code, or a ternary code respectively. The vectors in C are called codewords. The size of a code is the number of codewords and equals qk. The weight of a codeword is the number of its elements that are nonzero and the distance between two codewords is the Hamming distance between them, that is, the number of elements in which they differ. The distance d of the linear code is the minimum weight of its nonzero codewords, or equivalently, the minimum distance between distinct codewords. A linear code of length n, dimension k, and distance d is called an [n,k,d] code. We want to give \\\\mathbb{F}_q^n the standard basis because each coordinate represents a \\"bit\\" that is transmitted across a \\"noisy channel\\" with some small probability of transmission error (a binary symmetric channel). If some other basis is used then this model cannot be used and the Hamming metric does not measure the number of errors in transmission, as we want it to.  Generator and check matrices  As a linear subspace of \\\\mathbb{F}_q^n, the entire code C (which may be very large) may be represented as the span of a set of k codewords (known as a basis in linear algebra). These basis codewords are often collated in the rows of a matrix G known as a generating matrix for the code C. When G has the block matrix form \\\\boldsymbol{G} = [I_k  P], where I_k denotes the k \\\\times k identity matrix and P is some k \\\\times (n-k) matrix, then we say G is in standard form. A matrix H representing a linear function \\\\phi : \\\\mathbb{F}_q^n\\\\to \\\\mathbb{F}_q^{n-k} whose kernel is C is called a check matrix of C (or sometimes a parity check matrix). Equivalently, H is a matrix whose null space is C. If C is a code with a generating matrix G in standard form, \\\\boldsymbol{G} = [I_k  P], then \\\\boldsymbol{H} = [-P^{T}  I_{n-k} ] is a check matrix for C. The code generated by H is called the dual code of C. It can be verified that G is a k \\\\times n matrix, while H is a (n-k) \\\\times n matrix. Linearity guarantees that the minimum Hamming distance d between a codeword c0 and any of the other codewords c ‚â† c0 is independent of c0. This follows from the property that the difference c ‚àí c0 of two codewords in C is also a codeword (i.e., an element of the subspace C), and the property that d(c, c0) = d(c ‚àí c0, 0). These properties imply that :\\\\min_{c \\\\in C,\\\\ c eq c_0}d(c,c_0)=\\\\min_{c \\\\in C, c eq c_0}d(c-c_0, 0)=\\\\min_{c \\\\in C, c eq 0}d(c, 0)=d. In other words, in order to find out the minimum distance between the codewords of a linear code, one would only need to look at the non-zero codewords. The non-zero codeword with the smallest weight has then the minimum distance to the zero codeword, and hence determines the minimum distance of the code. The distance d of a linear code C also equals the minimum number of linearly dependent columns of the check matrix H. Proof: Because \\\\boldsymbol{H} \\\\cdot \\\\boldsymbol{c}^T = \\\\boldsymbol{0}, which is equivalent to \\\\sum_{i=1}^n (c_i \\\\cdot \\\\boldsymbol{H_i}) = \\\\boldsymbol{0}, where \\\\boldsymbol{H_i} is the i^{th} column of \\\\boldsymbol{H}. Remove those items with c_i=0, those \\\\boldsymbol{H_i} with c_i eq 0 are linearly dependent. Therefore, d is at least the minimum number of linearly dependent columns. On another hand, consider the minimum set of linearly dependent columns { \\\\boldsymbol{H_j}  j \\\\in S } where S is the column index set. \\\\sum_{i=1}^n (c_i \\\\cdot \\\\boldsymbol{H_i}) = \\\\sum_{j \\\\in S} (c_j \\\\cdot \\\\boldsymbol{H_j}) + \\\\sum_{j otin S} (c_j \\\\cdot \\\\boldsymbol{H_j}) = \\\\boldsymbol{0}. Now consider the vector \\\\boldsymbol{c'} such that c_j^{'}=0 if j otin S. Note \\\\boldsymbol{c'} \\\\in C because \\\\boldsymbol{H} \\\\cdot \\\\boldsymbol{c'}^T = \\\\boldsymbol{0} . Therefore, we have d \\\\le wt(\\\\boldsymbol{c'}) , which is the minimum number of linearly dependent columns in \\\\boldsymbol{H}. The claimed property is therefore proved.  Example: Hamming codes  As the first class of linear codes developed for error correction purpose, Hamming codes have been widely used in digital communication systems. For any positive integer r \\\\ge 2 , there exists a [2^r-1, 2^r-r-1,3]_2 Hamming code. Since d=3, this Hamming code can correct a 1-bit error. Example : The linear block code with the following generator matrix and parity check matrix is a [7,4,3]_2 Hamming code. : \\\\boldsymbol{G}=\\\\begin{pmatrix} 1\\\\ 0\\\\ 0\\\\ 0\\\\ 1\\\\ 1\\\\ 0 \\\\ 0\\\\ 1\\\\ 0\\\\ 0\\\\ 0\\\\ 1\\\\ 1 \\\\ 0\\\\ 0\\\\ 1\\\\ 0\\\\ 1\\\\ 1\\\\ 1 \\\\ 0\\\\ 0\\\\ 0\\\\ 1\\\\ 1\\\\ 0\\\\ 1 \\\\end{pmatrix} , \\\\boldsymbol{H}=\\\\begin{pmatrix} 1\\\\ 0\\\\ 1\\\\ 1\\\\ 1\\\\ 0\\\\ 0 \\\\ 1\\\\ 1\\\\ 1\\\\ 0\\\\ 0\\\\ 1\\\\ 0 \\\\ 0\\\\ 1\\\\ 1\\\\ 1\\\\ 0\\\\ 0\\\\ 1 \\\\end{pmatrix}  Example: Hadamard codes  Hadamard code is a [2^r, r, 2^{r-1}]_2 linear code and is capable of correcting many errors. Hadamard code could be constructed column by column : the i^{th} column is the bits of the binary representation of integer i, as shown in the following example. Hadamard code has minimum distance 2^{r-1} and therefore can correct 2^{r-2}-1 errors. Example: The linear block code with the following generator matrix is a [8,3,4]_2 Hadamard code: \\\\boldsymbol{G}_{Had}=\\\\begin{pmatrix} 0\\\\ 0\\\\ 0\\\\ 0\\\\ 1\\\\ 1\\\\ 1\\\\ 1\\\\ 0\\\\ 0\\\\ 1\\\\ 1\\\\ 0\\\\ 0\\\\ 1\\\\ 1\\\\ 0\\\\ 1\\\\ 0\\\\ 1\\\\ 0\\\\ 1\\\\ 0\\\\ 1\\\\end{pmatrix}. Hadamard code is a special case of Reed‚ÄìMuller code. If we take the first column (the all-zero column) out from \\\\boldsymbol{G}_{Had}, we get [7,3,4]_2 simplex code, which is the dual code of Hamming code. Nearest neighbor algorithm The parameter d is closely related to the error correcting ability of the code. The following construction/algorithm illustrates this (called the nearest neighbor decoding algorithm): Input: A received vector v in \\\\mathbb{F}_q^n . Output: A codeword w in C closest to v, if any. *Starting with t=0, repeat the following two steps. *Enumerate the elements of the ball of (Hamming) radius t around the received word v, denoted B_t(v). **For each w in B_t(v), check if w in C. If so, return w as the solution. *Increment t. Fail only when t > (d - 1)/2 so enumeration is complete and no solution has been found. We say that a linear C is t-error correcting if there is at most one codeword in B_t(v), for each v in \\\\mathbb{F}_q^n. Popular notation Codes in general are often denoted by the letter C, and a code of length n and of rank k (i.e., having k code words in its basis and k rows in its generating matrix) is generally referred to as an (n, k) code. Linear block codes are frequently denoted as [n, k, d] codes, where d refers to the code's minimum Hamming distance between any two code words. (The [n, k, d] notation should not be confused with the (n, M, d) notation used to denote a non-linear code of length n, size M (i.e., having M code words), and minimum Hamming distance d.) Singleton bound Lemma (Singleton bound): Every linear [n,k,d] code C satisfies k+d \\\\leq n+1. A code C whose parameters satisfy k+d=n+1 is called maximum distance separable or MDS. Such codes, when they exist, are in some sense best possible. If C1 and C2 are two codes of length n and if there is a permutation p in the symmetric group Sn for which (c1,...,cn) in C1 if and only if (cp(1),...,cp(n)) in C2, then we say C1 and C2 are permutation equivalent. In more generality, if there is an n\\\\times n monomial matrix M\\\\colon \\\\mathbb{F}_q^n \\\\to \\\\mathbb{F}_q^n which sends C1 isomorphically to C2 then we say C1 and C2 are equivalent. Lemma: Any linear code is permutation equivalent to a code which is in standard form. Bonisoli's theorem A code is defined to be equidistant if and only if there exists some constant d such that the distance between any two of the code's distinct codewords is equal to d. In 1984 Arrigo Bonisoli determined the structure of linear one-weight codes over finite fields and proved that every equidistant linear code is a sequence of dual Hamming codes. Examples Some examples of linear codes include: * Repetition codes * Parity codes * Cyclic codes * Hamming codes * Golay code, both the binary and ternary versions * Polynomial codes, of which BCH codes are an example * Reed‚ÄìSolomon codes * Reed‚ÄìMuller codes * Goppa codes * Low-density parity- check codes * Expander codes * Multidimensional parity-check codes * Toric codes * Turbo codes Generalization Hamming spaces over non-field alphabets have also been considered, especially over finite rings (most notably over Z4) giving rise to modules instead of vector spaces and ring-linear codes (identified with submodules) instead of linear codes. The typical metric used in this case the Lee distance. There exist a Gray isometry between \\\\mathbb{Z}_2^{2m} (i.e. GF(22m)) with the Hamming distance and \\\\mathbb{Z}_4^m (also denoted as GR(4,m)) with the Lee distance; its main attraction is that it establishes a correspondence between some \\"good\\" codes that are not linear over \\\\mathbb{Z}_2^{2m} as images of ring-linear codes from \\\\mathbb{Z}_4^m. More recently, some authors have referred to such codes over rings simply as linear codes as well.

She is best known for her appearances with World Championship Wrestling between 1999 and 2001 and with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling from 2008 to 2011. Early life As a \\"military brat\\", Shannon Claire Spruill was born on July 17, 1975, at the Wiesbaden Army Airfield, a United States Air Force base in Wiesbaden, West Germany, where her father was stationed. In 1976, her family returned to the United States, residing first in Salt Lake City, Utah, then in Savannah, Georgia and finally on the Scott Air Force Base in St. Clair County, Illinois. They relocated to Oxford in the United Kingdom for three years, before moving to the Ramstein Air Base in Germany until 1987, when her father, by then a Lieutenant Colonel, retired. In 1985, she had a small, uncredited part in the film Santa Claus: The Movie. In March 1998, Spruill graduated from Georgia State University, with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Film and Video production, with minors in Acting and Music. She went on to work in Media Production, before pursuing full time acting. Professional wrestling career=World Championship Wrestling (1999‚Äì2001) In November 1999, she responded to a World Championship Wrestling (WCW) contest looking to acquire new talent and was hired. In WCW, Spruill played Daffney, the mentally deranged, besotted girlfriend of David Flair, managing him and Crowbar. One of Daffney's hallmarks was a piercing scream when she was lurking at ringside. The gimmick was based in part on Mallory Knox, the character played by Juliette Lewis in the film Natural Born Killers. Spruill has cited Batman supervillainess Harley Quinn as the original inspiration for the character. Spruill's first appearance was on the December 6 episode of Nitro, when she was shown sitting on her bed and chanting Flair's name. On May 8, 2000, Daffney was appointed by Vince Russo to wrestle Miss Elizabeth in Miss Elizabeth's first wrestling match. On May 15, 2000, Daffney and Crowbar defeated WCW World Cruiserweight Champion Chris Candido and his girlfriend Tammy Lynn Sytch in a mixed tag team match and were declared co- champions. The following week on the May 22 episode of Nitro, Crowbar and Daffney faced one another to determine the undisputed World Cruiserweight Champion. Crowbar held back during the match, but still dominated the smaller Daffney. After Candido entered the ring and hit Crowbar with a reverse piledriver, Spruill inadvertently pinned him while trying to revive him and thus became the second woman ever to hold the Cruiserweight Championship. Her reign lasted until June 7 when Lieutenant Loco pinned Disco Inferno in a three-way title defense while Daffney was hurt following interference from Miss Hancock. Daffney went on to feud with Hancock, who had stolen the affections of Flair. Daffney defeated Hancock in the promotion's first ever Wedding Gown match after Hancock removed her own dress. Daffney then became solely the valet for Crowbar. She had a brief feud with Shane Douglas's valet, Torrie Wilson, but was sporadically used as a wrestler. Daffney's gimmicks included frequently changing hair color, a wide selection of T-Shirts decorated with amusing or bizarre slogans, and her loud screams. She began screaming at the suggestion of WCW writer Ed Ferrara. She was released by WCW on February 2, 2001 due to budget cutbacks (WCW itself was purchased by its rival, the World Wrestling Federation, a month later). Independent circuit (2002‚Äì2013) Daffney during an Anarchy Championship Wrestling event in March 2009 Spruill opted to continue wrestling, attending Dusty Rhodes' Turnbuckle Championship Wrestling training camp in Kennesaw, Georgia for eight months. She made several appearances for the fledgling Total Nonstop Action Wrestling promotion in 2002 as Shannon and Shark Girl (valet of Shark Boy), and worked for Xtreme Pro Wrestling in 2003 as Lucy, the manager of Vic Grimes. She also appeared in Ring of Honor, where she debuted on April 26, 2003 as Lucy, the valet of the Second City Saints. In July 2003, Spruill was signed to a developmental deal by World Wrestling Entertainment. She worked in Ohio Valley Wrestling as the manager of Aaron Stevens until she was released on December 17 of the same year. After her release from WWE, Spruill decided to retire from professional wrestling. Intending to focus on her acting career, she sold her wrestling boots to her then-roommate, Mickie James. While retired, Spruill worked as a personal trainer. In June 2005, she posed for a website owned and operated by wrestling divas Francine and Missy Hyatt. In February 2006, Spruill returned to the independent circuit. Spruill debuted in Women's Extreme Wrestling on April 6 under the ring name Lucy Furr (\\"Lucifer\\"), acting as a lumberjill in a match between Amy Lee and Tai Killer Weed. On June 2, 2006 in Irondale, Alabama, Spruill faced El Mexico for the NWA Wrestle Birmingham Junior Heavyweight Championship. With the help of her manager, Robert Fuller (who referred to Spruill as his \\"Million Dollar Baby\\"), Spruill defeated El Mexicano to win her third wrestling title. In February 2007, she began making appearances with Georgia Wrestling Promotions both as a manager and a referee. In April 2007, Spruill debuted as Daffney for Shimmer Women Athletes. She conducted an interview where she revealed her goal was to return to what she did from the beginning of her career and that was to manage. Later that evening she appeared as the manager of the wrestler MsChif. In April 2008 she began wrestling as her Shark Girl character. However, she returned to wrestling as Daffney after only a couple of months. On November 8, 2009, Daffney teamed with Rachel Summerlyn against the International Home Wrecking Crew at Volume 27, only to turn villainous by abandoning Summerlyn during the match, causing a loss to the IHWC. Later in the night on Volume 28, Daffney got disqualified in a match with Summerlyn, after she did not release an illegal hold off her opponent. On April 11, 2010, at the tapings of Volume 31, the evil Daffney defeated Summerlyn in a No Disqualification match. On June 27, 2010 Daffney won her only Women's Championship defeating Rachel Summerlyn in the 1st round of Anarchy Championship Wrestling's 2010 American Joshi Queen of Queens Tournament. She lost the title in the 2nd round to Jessica James. On April 6, 2013, Daffney returned to Shimmer Women Athletes at the promotion's first ever internet pay-per-view, Volume 53, where she appeared as the manager of Regeneration X (Allison Danger and Leva Bates). Total Nonstop Action Wrestling Spruill re-emerged in TNA on the June 5, 2008 episode of TNA Impact! as Daffney. She was planted in the audience along with fellow wrestlers Amber O'Neal and Becky Bayless. The three women volunteered to wrestle Awesome Kong in the $25,000 Challenge. Daffney was selected and subsequently defeated by Kong. =The Governor (2008‚Äì2009)= In December 2008 Spruill started playing the role of Alaska governor Sarah Palin in skits involving the Beautiful People. On the January 15 episode of Impact!, it was revealed by Taylor Wilde and Roxxi that \\"Sarah Palin\\" was indeed fake, and it had all been a big joke by Roxxi and Taylor to get revenge on The Beautiful People. The next week she was seen in an interview with Lauren, where they made fun of the Beautiful People. The Beautiful People then proceeded to viciously attack \\"The Governor\\" before being pulled away by Cute Kip as Spruill lay injured. On the February 5, 2009, episode of Impact!, she made her return by attacking the Beautiful People, this time complete with entrance video and theme. She made her PPV debut at Destination X in a winning effort when she teamed with Roxxi and Wilde to defeat The Beautiful People and Madison Rayne. =Daffney; alliance with Dr. Stevie (2009‚Äì2010)= Abyss in a Monster's Ball match at Slammiversary As a result of having her hair cut by the Beautiful People on the March 19 episode of Impact!, Spruill transformed into her old Daffney ring name and gimmick on the April 2 episode of Impact!, when she appeared in on-screen psychiatrist Dr. Stevie's office for a therapy session. On the April 16 episode of Impact!, she teamed with Stevie's other patient Abyss to defeat the duo of ODB and Cody Deaner in a mixed tag team match. She competed in the Queen of the Cage match at Lockdown against ODB, Madison Rayne and Sojournor Bolt, but failed to win the match. On the May 14 episode of Impact!, Daffney turned heel by assaulting Taylor Wilde, because she did not save her when The Beautiful People cut her hair. At Sacrifice Wilde defeated Daffney, who had Abyss and Dr. Stevie in her corner, in the first ever Monster's Ball match. After she and Dr. Stevie began associating themselves with the returning Raven, Daffney defeated Wilde with their help in a rematch on the June 4 episode of Impact with her swinging fisherman suplex named the Lobotomy. The following week Daffney assaulted Wilde backstage after provoking her by attacking her on-screen best friend, backstage interviewer Lauren, earlier on the same night. Daffney and Raven were defeated by Abyss and Taylor Wilde at Slammiversary in a Monster's Ball mixed tag match. During the match Wilde slammed Daffney onto a pile of thumbtacks. The following Thursday on Impact!, she and Wilde faced off in the first ever \\"Match of 10,000 Tacks\\", which she lost. At Bound for Glory, Daffney interfered in a Monster's Ball match between Abyss and Mick Foley, who had assigned Abyss' rival and Daffney's associate Dr. Stevie as the special guest referee of the match. During the match Abyss chokeslammed Daffney from the ring apron through a barbed wire board, although reports indicated she had suffered a broken arm, it was later reported to be inaccurate although she had instead suffered a concussion. On the November 12 episode of Impact!, Raven once again returned to TNA to reform the group of himself, Dr. Stevie and Daffney. =Singles competition and departure (2010‚Äì2011)= Daffney posing in the ring in 2010 Daffney spent the next couple of months mainly managing Stevie and Raven, before making her in-ring return on the February 18, 2010, episode of Impact!, losing to the TNA Women's Knockout Champion Tara via disqualification, after hitting her with a toolbox. After the match, Daffney continued her assault, before being dragged away by Dr. Stevie. The following week on Impact! she annihilated ODB in similar fashion as it was noted that she had her eye set on the title. On the March 8 episode of Impact!, Daffney cost Tara and her tag team partner Angelina Love the Knockouts Tag Team Championship by hitting her with the Women's Knockout Championship belt during a match for the vacant titles. At Destination X Daffney failed in her attempt to win the Knockout Championship from Tara, but managed to steal her spider Poison from her after the match. The following day on Impact! Daffney used distraction from Poison to pin Tara in an eight wrestler tag team match to earn her a First Blood match for the Women's Knockout Championship the following week. The following week Tara defeated Daffney in a First Blood match after hitting her with a toolbox. The following week Daffney was one of the four winners in an eight knockout Lockbox match, contested for four keys to four boxes containing prizes. During the contest Tara, one of the three other winners, won back Poison, while Daffney came up empty handed and was forced to strip down, but before she could she was attacked by Lacey Von Erich. The attack resulted in a match on the April 19 episode of Impact!, where Daffney, now seemingly a face, and a partner of her choice, ODB, unsuccessfully challenged Von Erich and Velvet Sky for the TNA Knockouts Tag Team Championship. At the following day's Impact! tapings, Daffney was injured in a dark match against Miss Betsy in her tryout match and was taken to a hospital, where she was diagnosed with a deeply bruised sternum, a severe stinger, and a concussion. On May 26 it was announced that Spruill had been cleared to return to wrestling. She made her return at the June 14 tapings of Xplosion, wrestling once again as a heel and defeating Taylor Wilde with the help of a chain, only to have the referee of the match catch her afterwards, leading to Wilde defeating her after a restart. On the December 9 episode of Impact!, Daffney teamed with Sarita in a first round match of a tournament for the vacant TNA Knockouts Tag Team Championship, where they were defeated by the Beautiful People (Angelina Love and Velvet Sky). This marked Daffney's final appearance for TNA as on March 15, 2011, her contract with the promotion expired and was not renewed. Spruill announced that she had filed a workers' compensation claim against TNA for injuries suffered while wrestling for the promotion, believing she had been put in an unsafe working environment. Spruill later also claimed that she did not believe she could ever wrestle again due to the accumulated injuries she had suffered during her career. The lawsuit was settled out of court on March 8, 2013. Wrestlicious (2009‚Äì2010) In early 2009 Spruill took part in the first season tapings of Wrestlicious, which started airing in March 2010, using the character of Draculetta. She debuted on March 17 in the main event of the third episode of Takedown, teaming with White Magic in a tag team match, where they lost via disqualification to the team of Lacey Von Erich and Amber Lively. Shine Wrestling (2012‚Äì2015) In July 2012, Daffney began working as the \\"hostess\\" of the new Shine Wrestling promotion. She held the position until May 2013, when she returned to the role of a manager. Daffney became a villainess in July 2015, when she became the manager of the Iron Maidens, sending them to attack various tag teams during matches. Ring of Honor Wrestling (2018) In August 2018, Daffney made an appearance on Ring of Honor wrestling television for the Women of Honor Championship tournament between Sumie Sakai and Kelly Klein. After Sakai defeated Klein for the tournament, Daffney and the other women congratulated Sakai for her victory. Personal life Spruill was married to guitarist Rich Ward of Stuck Mojo and Fozzy. On July 19, 2011, Spruill was arrested in Hillsborough County, Florida for \\"driving under the influence with property damage\\". Spruill later pleaded guilty to the charges and was sentenced to one year probation and a fine of $1,580.

However, it is a general purpose template engine, with no dependency on servlets or HTTP or HTML, and is thus often used for generating source code, configuration files or e-mails.  History  FreeMarker had a somewhat hectic history until about 2004, caused by paradigm shifts and other significant changes on multiple occasions. FreeMarker 1 (now known as FreeMarker Classic, a separate project) was originally written by Benjamin Geer and Mike Bayer. From 2002, the new project lead was Jonathan Revusky, who released FreeMarker 2, which started a sequence of several substantial changes. The main goal of the changes was to make the template language more strict, i.e., to detect as many of the typos and other typical mistakes as possible. Also, automatic object wrapping was introduced, along with gradual advancement of the type system of the template language. The language has gained many power-user features, such as more powerful macro programming capabilities and namespaces. The language has reached a quite settled state with version 2.3, released in 2004 Q3. As of 2016, the product has remained backward compatible. No significant backward incompatible changes are expected in the FreeMarker 2 series in the future. In late 2015, FreeMarker was granted to the Apache Software Foundation, where it has entered the Apache Incubator, and in 2018-03-21 it has become a fully accepted Apache project.  Example  The following template: Hello \${name}! You have the following messages: <#list messages as m> **\${m.from}:** \${m.body} processed by FreeMarker will produce something like: Hello Joe! You have the following messages: **Tim:** Please don't forget to bring the conference papers! **Cindy:** Can you give me a visit this afternoon? **Richard:** Don't forget the papers this time! Variables like \\"name\\" and \\"messages\\" are coming from outside the template, and thus the template author has to deal with the presentation issues only. The template remains the same regardless if these variables are coming from a database or from a cookie or calculated in whatever other ways. Also the exact Java API (and hence the class) of the values can be hidden in FreeMarker using a technique called object wrapping. For example, \\"messages\\" seems to be a list or array of JavaBeans that have \\"from\\" and \\"body\\" properties, but it might as well be something very different, and the template is not affected (as long as a proper object wrapper is used).

Tea plays an important role in some countries. It is commonly consumed at social events, and many cultures have created intricate formal ceremonies for these events. Afternoon tea is a British custom with widespread appeal. Tea ceremonies, with their roots in the Chinese tea culture, differ among East Asian countries, such as the Japanese or Korean versions. Tea may differ widely in preparation, such as in Tibet, where the beverage is commonly brewed with salt and butter. Tea may be drunk in small private gatherings (tea parties) or in public (tea houses designed for social interaction). The British Empire spread its own interpretation of tea to its dominions and colonies, including regions that today comprise the states of Hong Kong, India, and Pakistan, which had pre-existing tea customs, as well as regions such as East Africa (modern-day Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda) and the Pacific (Australia and New Zealand) which did not have tea customs. The tea room or teahouse is found in the US, the UK, and Ireland. Different regions favour different varieties of tea‚Äîwhite, yellow, green, oolong, black, or post-fermented (dark)‚Äîand use different flavourings, such as herbs, milk, or sugar. The temperature and strength of the tea likewise vary widely. Bubble tea Bubble tea, pearl milk tea (), or boba milk tea () is a tea beverage mixture with milk which includes balls of tapioca. Originating in Taiwan, it is especially popular in East Asia and Southeast Asia, including Japan, South Korea, China, Hong Kong, Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Singapore, as well as India, Sri Lanka, Europe, Canada, and the United States. It is also known as black pearl tea or tapioca tea. Taiwanese tea culture also encompasses a more traditional Chinese tea culture followed by Han Chinese on the island. Wild tea was first found in Taiwan by the Dutch East India Company. Since then, successive waves of immigration from mainland China to Taiwan have left a legacy of influences on tea culture. East Asia=China Chinese tea, gancha Due to the importance of tea in Chinese society and culture, tea houses can be found in most Chinese neighbourhoods and business districts. Chinese-style tea houses offer dozens of varieties of hot and cold tea concoctions. They also serve a variety of tea-friendly or tea-related snacks. Beginning in the late afternoon, the typical Chinese tea house quickly becomes packed with students and business people, and later at night playing host to insomniacs and night owls simply looking for a place to relax. There are formal tea houses. They provide a range of Chinese and Japanese tea leaves, as well as tea making accoutrements and a better class of snack food. Finally there are tea vendors, who specialize in the sale of tea leaves, pots, and other related paraphernalia. Tea is an important item in Chinese culture and is mentioned in the seven necessities of (Chinese) daily life. During the Tang Dynasty, Lu Yu found that the plants which grow under shady hillsides produced poor quality tea, often resulting in abdominal distension. The common methods of making tea at the time were boiling the water and tea leaves at the same time. The water was heated in a cauldron on a brazier to the first boil level, which was described as \\"fish eyes‚Äù. Appropriate salts were added into the water with a view to enhancing the flavor of the tea. Two periods In China, at least as early as the Tang Dynasty, tea was an object of connoisseurship; in the Song Dynasty formal tea- tasting parties were held, comparable to modern wine tastings. As much as in modern wine tastings, the proper vessel was important and much attention was paid to matching the tea to an aesthetically appealing serving vessel. Historically there were two phases of tea drinking in China based on the form of tea that was produced and consumed, namely: tea bricks versus loose leaf tea. Tea brick phase A tea brick made for the Russian Imperial Army of Czar Nicholas II Tea served before the Ming Dynasty was typically made from tea bricks. Upon harvesting, the tea leaves were either partially dried or were thoroughly dried and ground before being pressed into bricks. The pressing of Pu-erh is likely a vestige of this process. Tea bricks were also sometimes used as currency.Forbes, Andrew; Henley, David (2011). China's Ancient Tea Horse Road. Chiang Mai: Cognoscenti Books. ASIN: B005DQV7Q2 Serving the tea from tea bricks required multiple steps: *Toasting: Tea bricks are usually first toasted over a fire to destroy any mould or insects that may have burrowed into the tea bricks. Such infestation sometimes occurred since the bricks were stored openly in warehouses and storerooms. Toasting likely imparted a pleasant flavour to the resulting tea. *Grinding: The tea brick was broken up and ground to a fine powder. This practice survives in Japanese powdered tea (matcha). *Whisking: The powdered tea was mixed into hot water and frothed with a whisk before serving. The colour and patterns formed by the powdered tea were enjoyed while the mixture was imbibed. The ground and whisked teas used at that time called for dark and patterned bowls in which the texture of the tea powder suspension could be enjoyed. The best of these bowls, glazed in patterns with names like oil spot, partridge-feather, hare's fur, and tortoise shell, are highly valued today. The patterned holding bowl and tea mixture were often lauded in the period's poetry with phrases such as \\"partridge in swirling clouds\\" or \\"snow on hare's fur\\". Tea in this period was enjoyed more for its patterns and less for its flavour. The practice of using powdered tea can still be seen in the Japanese Tea ceremony or Chad≈ç. Loose- leaf tea phase Five Yixing clay teapots showing a variety of styles from formal to whimsical After 1391, the Hongwu Emperor, the founder of the Ming Dynasty, decreed that tributes of tea to the court were to be changed from brick to loose-leaf form. The imperial decree quickly transformed the tea drinking habits of the people, changing from whisked teas to steeped teas. The arrival of the new method for preparing tea also required the creation or use of new vessels. *The tea pot was needed such that the tea leaves can be steeped separately from the drinking vessel for an infusion of proper concentration. The tea needs to be kept warm and the tea leaves must be separated from the resulting infusion when required. *Tea caddies and containers also became necessary to keep the tea and conserve its flavour. This was because tea leaves do not preserve as well as tea bricks. Furthermore, the natural aroma of tea became the focus of the tea drinking due to the new preparation method. *A change in Chinese tea drinking vessels was evident at this point. Smaller bowls with plain or simple designs on the interior surfaces were favoured over the larger patterned bowls used for enjoying the patterns created by powdered teas. Tea drinking in small bowls and cups was likely adopted since it gathers and directs the fragrant steam from the tea to the nose and allows for better appreciation of the tea's flavour. Teawares made with a special kind of purple clay (Zisha) from Yixing went on to develop during this period (Ming Dynasty). The structure of purple clay made it advantageous material with tiny and high density, preferred for heat preservation and perviousness. Simplicity and rusticity dominated the idea of purple clay teaware decoration art. It soon became the most popular method of performing Chinese tea ceremony, which often combines literature, calligraphy, painting and seal cutting in Chinese culture. The loose-leaf tea and the purple clay teaware is still the preferred method of preparing tea in Chinese daily life. =Tibet= Butter tea in a bowl Butter, milk, and salt are added to brewed tea and churned to form a hot drink called Po cha (bod ja, where bod means Tibetan and ja tea) in Tibet, Bhutan, and Nepal. The concoction is sometimes called cha su mar, mainly in Kham, or Eastern Tibet. Traditionally, the drink is made with a domestic brick tea and yak's milk, then mixed in a churn for several minutes. Using a generic black tea, milk and butter, and shaking or blending work well too, although the unique taste of yak milk is difficult to replicate. (see recipe) Tibet tea drinking has many rules. One such concerns an invitation to a house for tea. The host will first pour some highland barley wine. The guest must dip his finger in the wine and flick some away. This will be done three times to represent respect for the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha. The cup will then be refilled two more times and on the last time it must be emptied or the host will be insulted. After this the host will present a gift of butter tea to the guest, who will accept it without touching the rim of the bowl. The guest will then pour a glass for himself, and must finish the glass or be seen as rude. There are two main teas that go with the tea culture. The teas are butter tea and sweet milk tea. These two teas are only found in Tibet. Other teas that the Tibetans enjoy are boiled black teas. There are many tea shops in Tibet selling these teas, which travelers often take for their main hydration source. =Hong Kong= The English-style tea has evolved into a new local style of drink, the Hong Kong- style milk tea, more often simply \\"milk tea\\", in Hong Kong by using evaporated milk instead of ordinary milk. It is popular at cha chaan tengs and fast food shops such as Caf√© de Coral and Maxims Express. Traditional Chinese tea, including green tea, flower tea, jasmine tea, and Pu-erh tea, are also common, and are served at dim sum restaurants during yum cha. Another Hong Kong speciality is lemon tea - served in cafes and restaurants as regular black tea with several slices of fresh lemon, either hot or cold, with a pot of sugar to add to taste. In 1979, local drinks manufacturer Vitasoy introduced a packaged brand, which remains popular and is gaining market traction in mainland China.Cooler than marijuana? Hong Kong‚Äôs iconic Vitasoy drinks brand is on a high thanks to Chinese memes, SCMP, 1 Jan 2019Homegrown Hong Kong: the wholesome story of Vitasoy, SCMP Other brands followed suit in Hong Kong.  Korea  The Korean tea ceremony or darye (Ëå∂Á¶Æ) is a traditional form of tea ceremony practiced in Korea. Darye literally refers to \\"etiquette for tea\\" or \\"tea rite.\\" The chief element of the Korean tea ceremony is the ease and naturalness of enjoying tea within an easy formal setting. Central to the Korean approach to tea is an easy and natural coherence, with fewer formal rituals, fewer absolutes, greater freedom for relaxation, and more creativity in enjoying a wider variety of teas, services, and conversation. Japan A one cup sized, glazed Japanese cast-iron teapot from the T≈çhoku region, intended for collectors Green tea's traditional role in Japanese society is as a drink for special guests and special occasions. Green tea is served in many companies during afternoon breaks. Japanese often buy sweets for their colleagues when on vacation or business trips. These snacks are usually enjoyed with green tea. Tea will also be prepared for visitors coming for meetings to companies and for guests visiting Japanese homes. A thermos full of green tea is a staple on family or school outings as an accompaniment to bento (box lunches). Families often bring along proper Japanese teacups to enhance the enjoyment of the traditional drink. The strong cultural association the Japanese have with green tea has made it the most popular beverage to drink with traditional Japanese cuisine, such as sushi, sashimi, and tempura. At a restaurant, a cup of green tea is often served with meals at no extra charge, with as many refills as desired. The best traditional Japanese restaurants take as much care in choosing the tea they serve as in preparing the food itself. A cup of Matcha tea and a piece of sweet cake Many Japanese are still taught the proper art of the centuries-old tea ceremony as well. Still, the Japanese now enjoy green tea processed using state of the art technology. Today, hand pressing‚Äîa method demonstrated to tourists‚Äîis taught only as a technique preserved as a part of the Japanese cultural tradition. Most of the ubiquitous vending machines also carry a wide selection of both hot and cold bottled teas. Oolong tea enjoys considerable popularity. Black tea, often with milk or lemon, is served ubiquitously in cafes, coffee shops, and restaurants. Major tea-producing areas in Japan include Shizuoka Prefecture and the city of Uji in Kyoto Prefecture. Other infusions bearing the name cha are barley tea (mugi-cha) which is popular as a cold drink in the summer, buckwheat tea (soba-cha), and hydrangea tea (ama-cha). Southeast Asia=Myanmar Myanmar is one of very few countries where tea is not only drunk but eaten as lahpet‚Äîpickled tea served with various accompaniments. It is called lahpet so (tea wet) in contrast to lahpet chauk (tea dry) or akyan jauk (crude dry) with which green tea‚Äîyeinway jan or lahpet yeijan meaning plain or crude tea‚Äîis made. In the Shan State of Myanmar where most of the tea is grown, and also Kachin State, tea is dry-roasted in a pan before adding boiling water to make green tea. It is the national drink. Tea sweetened with milk is known as lahpet yeijo made with acho jauk (sweet dry) or black tea and prepared the Indian way, brewed and sweetened with condensed milk. It is a very popular drink although the middle classes by and large appear to prefer coffee most of the time. It was introduced to Myanmar by Indian immigrants some of whom set up teashops known as kaka hsaing, later evolving to just lahpetyei hsaing (teashop). It is common for Buremese to gather in tea shops drinking Indian tea served with a diverse range of snacks. Green tea is customarily the first thing to be served free of charge as soon as a customer sits down at a table in all restaurants as well as teashops. Teashops are extremely prevalent, and are open for breakfast till late in the evening, with some even open for 24 hour catering for long distance drivers and travellers. =Lahpet= Lahpet served in a lacquer dish Lahpet (pickled tea) is served in one of two ways: # A-hlu lahpet or Mandalay lahpet is served in a plate or traditionally in a shallow lacquerware dish called lahpet ohk with a lid and divided into small compartments‚Äîpickled tea laced with sesame oil in a central compartment, and other ingredients such as crisp fried garlic, peas and peanuts, toasted sesame, crushed dried shrimp, preserved shredded ginger and fried shredded coconut in other compartments encircling it. It may be served as a snack or after a meal with green tea either on special occasions or just for the family and visitors. A-hlu means alms and is synonymous with a novitiation ceremony called Shinbyu although lahpet is served in this form also at hsun jway (offering a meal to monks) and weddings. Invitation to a shinbyu is traditionally by calling from door to door with a lahpet ohk, and acceptance is indicated by its partaking. # Lahpet thouk or Yangon lahpet is pickled tea salad very popular all over Myanmar especially with women, and some teashops would have it on their menu as well as Burmese restaurants. It is prepared by mixing all the above ingredients without the coconut but in addition includes fresh tomatoes, garlic and green chilli, and is dressed with fish sauce, sesame or peanut oil, and a squeeze of lime. Some of the most popular brands sold in packets include Ayee Taung lahpet from Mandalay, Shwe Toak from Mogok, Yuzana and Pinpyo Ywetnu from Yangon. Hnapyan jaw (twice fried) ready-mixed garnish is also available today. Thailand Thai tea (also known as Thai iced tea) or \\"cha-yen\\" () when ordered in Thailand is a drink made from strongly-brewed red tea that usually contains added anise, red and yellow food colouring, and sometimes other spices as well. This tea is sweetened with sugar and condensed milk and served chilled. Evaporated or whole milk is generally poured over the tea and ice before serving without mixing to add taste and creamy appearance. Locally, it is served in a traditional tall glass and when ordered take-out, it is poured over the crushed ice in a clear (or translucent) plastic bag. It can be made into a frapp√© at more westernised vendors. It is popular in Southeast Asia and in many American restaurants that serve Thai or Vietnamese food, especially on the West Coast of the United States. Although Thai tea is not the same as bubble tea, a Southeast and East Asian beverage that contains large black pearls of tapioca starch, Thai tea with pearls is a popular flavour of bubble tea. Green tea is also very popular in Thailand, spawning many variations such as barley green tea, rose green tea, lemon green tea, etc. Thai green tea, however, is not to be confused with traditional Japanese green tea. Thai green tea tends to be very heavily commercialised and the taste is sweeter. Vietnam Tea is cultivated extensively in the north of the country, making Vietnam one of the world's largest exporters. The word in the Vietnamese language is tr√† ( or ) or ch√® ( or ). It is served unsweetened and unaccompanied by milk, cream, or lemon. Traditionally tea is frequently consumed as green tea (tr√† xanh). Variants of black tea (ch√® t√†u) is also widely used although frequently scented with Jasminum sambac blossoms (ch√® nh√†i, tr√† l√†i). Hu·∫ø is renowned for its tea scented with Nelumbo nucifera stamens (tr√† sen). In Vietnamese restaurants, including eateries overseas, a complimentary pot of tea is usually served once the meal has been ordered, with refills free of charge. South Asia Tea plantation, Sri Lanka India A chai wallah in Varanasi India pours a cup of tea One of the world's largest producers of tea, India is a country where tea is popular all over as a breakfast and evening drink. It is often served as masala chai with milk, sugar, and spices such as ginger, cardamom, black pepper and cinnamon. Almost all the tea consumed is black Indian tea, CTC variety. Usually tea leaves are boiled in water while making tea, and milk is added. Offering tea to visitors is the cultural norm in Indian homes, offices and places of business. Tea is often consumed at small roadside stands, where it is prepared by tea makers known as chai wallahs. There are three most famous regions in India to produce black teas- Darjeeling, Assam and Nilgiri. \\"Strong, heavy and fragrant\\" are 3 criteria for judging black tea. Darjeeling tea is known for its delicate aroma and light colour and is aptly termed as \\"the champagne of teas\\", which has high aroma and yellow or brown liquid after brewing. Assam tea is known for its robust taste and dark colour, and Nilgiri tea is dark, intensely aromatic and flavoured. Assam produces the largest quantity of Tea in India, mostly of the CTC variety, and is one of the biggest suppliers of major international brands such as Lipton and Tetley. The Tetley Brand, formerly British owned and one of the largest, is now owned by the Indian Tata Tea Limited company. On April 21, 2012 the Deputy Chairman of Planning Commission (India), Montek Singh Ahluwalia, said that tea would be declared as national drink by April 2013. Speaking on the occasion, former Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi said a special package for the tea industry would be announced in the future to ensure its development. The move was expected to boost the tea industry in the country, but in May 2013 the ministry of commerce decided not to declare a national drink for fear of disrupting the competing coffee industry. Pakistan Tea is popular all over Pakistan and is referred to as chai (⁄Üÿßÿ¶€í). During British Rule tea became very popular in Lahore. Tea is usually consumed at breakfast, during lunch breaks at the workplace, and in the evening at home. Evening tea may be consumed with biscuits or cake. Guests are typically offered a choice between tea and soft drinks. It is common practice for homeowners to offer tea breaks to hired labour, and sometimes even provide them with tea during the breaks. Tea offered to labour is typically strong and has more sugar in it. In Pakistan, both black and green teas are popular and are known locally as sabz chai and kahwah, respectively. The popular green tea called kahwah is often served after every meal in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the Pashtun belt of Balochistan. In Lahore and other cities of Punjab Kashmiri chai or cha is common, brought by ethnic Kashmiris in the 19th century. Traditionally, it is prepared with Himalayan rock salt, giving it its characteristic pink color. It is taken with Bakar khani as well as Kashmiri kulcha (namkeen/salty version of Khand kulcha). Namkeen chai or noon/loon Cha or commonly called Kashmri chai and sometimes sheer (milk) cha or sabz chai (green tea as the same tea are used for making khahwa/green tea) is sold and seen in Gawalmandi kiosks with salt for Kashmiri as well as with sugar and pistachios for non-Kashmris. In the northern Pakistan regions of Chitral and Gilgit-Baltistan, a salty buttered Tibetan style tea is consumed. Sri Lanka In Sri Lanka, black tea is usually served with milk and sugar, but the milk is always warmed. Tea is a hugely popular beverage among the Sri Lankan people, and part of its land is surrounded by the many hills of tea plantations that spread for miles. Drinking tea has become part of the culture of Sri Lanka and it is customary to offer a cup of tea to guests. Many working Sri Lankans are used to having a mid-morning cup of tea and another in the afternoon. Black tea is sometimes consumed with ginger. In rural areas, some people still have their tea with a piece of sweet jaggery. West Asia=Iran An Iranian family catering black tea for President Ali Khamenei in their house, February 1987. Tea found its way to Persia (Iran) through the Silk Road from India and soon became the national drink. The whole part of northern Iran along the shores of the Caspian Sea is suitable for the cultivation of tea. Especially in the Gilan province on the slopes of Alborz, large areas are under tea cultivation and millions of people work in the tea industry. That region covers a large part of Iran's need for tea. Iranians have one of the highest per capita rates of tea consumption in the world and since old times every street has had a Ch√¢ikh√¢ne (Tea House). Ch√¢ikh√¢nes are still an important social place. Iranians traditionally drink tea by pouring it into a saucer and putting a lump of rock sugar (qand) in the mouth before drinking the tea. Turkey Turkish tea, served in a typical glass As of 2016, Turkey tops the per capita tea consumption statistics at . 2016 tea per capita stat Turkish tea or √áay is produced on the eastern Black Sea coast, which has a mild climate with high precipitation and fertile soil. Turkish tea is typically prepared using √ßaydanlƒ±k, an instrument especially designed for tea preparation, essentially an on-top-of-the-kitchen-range replacement for the more traditional samovar. Water is brought to a boil in the larger lower kettle and then some of the water is used to fill the smaller kettle on top - demlik - and steep several spoons of loose tea leaves, producing a very strong tea. When served, the continually cooking water from the bottom part is used to dilute the strong tea from the top part on a per cup basis, giving each serving the choice between strong (\\"koyu\\"/dark) or weak (\\"a√ßƒ±k\\"/light). Tea is drunk from small glasses to enjoy it hot in addition to show its colour, with lumps of beetroot sugar, either dissolved in the cup for sweetness, or pressed between the tongue tip and upper palate for reduced sugar intake (kƒ±rtlama). To a lesser extent than in other Muslim countries, tea replaces both alcohol and coffee as the social beverage. Within Turkey the tea is usually known as Rize tea. In 2004, Turkey produced 205,500 tonnes of tea (6.4% of the world's total tea production), which made it one of the largest tea markets in the world, with 120,000 tons being consumed in Turkey, and the rest being exported.About Turkey:Geography, Economics, Politics, Religion and Culture, Rashid and Resit Ergener, Pilgrims' Process, 2002, 0-9710609-6-7, p.g. 41 In 2010 Turkey had the highest per capita consumption in the world at . As of 2013, the per- capita consumption of Turkish tea exceeds 10 cups per day and per year. Tea is grown mostly in Rize Province on the Black Sea coast.\\"tea\\" Africa=Egypt Tea is the national drink in Egypt. In Egypt, tea is called \\"shai\\".The book of cities by Philip Dodd Tea packed and sold in Egypt is almost exclusively imported from Kenya and Sri Lanka. The Egyptian government considers tea a strategic crop and runs large tea plantations in Kenya. Green tea is a recent arrival to Egypt (only in the late 1990s did green tea become affordable) and is not as popular. Egyptian tea comes in two varieties: Koshary and Saiidi. Koshary tea, popular in Lower (Northern) Egypt, is prepared using the traditional method of steeping black tea in boiled water and letting it set for a few minutes. It is almost always sweetened with cane sugar and is often flavored with fresh mint leaves. Adding milk is also common. Koshary tea is usually light, with less than a half teaspoonful per cup considered to be near the high end. Saiidi tea is common in Upper (Southern) Egypt. It is prepared by boiling black tea with water for as long as 5 minutes over a strong flame. Saiidi tea is extremely heavy, with 2 teaspoonfuls per cup being the norm. It is sweetened with copious amounts of cane sugar (a necessity since the formula and method yield a very bitter tea). Saiidi tea is often black even in liquid form. Besides true tea, herbal teas (or tisanes) are often served at the Egyptian teahouses, with ingredients ranging from mint to cinnamon and ginger to salep; many of these are ascribed medicinal qualities or health benefits in Egyptian folk medicine. Karkade, a tisane of hibiscus flowers, is a particularly popular beverage and is traditionally considered beneficial for the heart. Libya Libyan Tea and peanuts Libyan tea is a strong beverage, black or green, served in small glass cups with foam or froth topping the glass. it is usually sweetened with sugar and traditionally served in three rounds. mint or basil is used for flavoring and traditionally the last round is served with boiled peanuts or almonds. Mauritius Tea plays an important part in the culture of Mauritius. Tea drinking allows for socialising with it commonly being served to guests and in the workplace. The Mauritian peoples usually consume black tea, often with milk and sugar. Mauritius is a producer of tea, initially on a small scale when the French introduced the plant into the island around 1765. It was under later British rule that the scale of tea cultivation increased. Three major tea producers dominate the local market these are Bois Cheri, Chartreuse and Corson. The signature product is the vanilla-flavoured tea which is commonly bought and consumed on the island. Morocco Moroccan mint tea Morocco is considered the largest importer of green tea worldwide.Morocco tea imports from China hits $56 million mark AngolaPress Tea was introduced to Morocco in the 18th century through trade with Europe. Morocco consumes green tea with mint rather than black tea. It has become part of the culture and is used widely at almost every meal. The Moroccan people even make tea performance a special culture in the flower country. Moroccan tea is commonly served with rich tea cookies, fresh green mint leaves, local \\"finger shape\\" brown sugar, and colorful tea glasses and pots. Drinking Moroccan tea is not only a luxury of tongue, but also the eyes. Sahel Sahelian tea set In the Sahel region on the southern fringe of the Sahara, such as in Mali, green gunpowder tea is prepared with little water and large amounts of sugar. By pouring the tea into the glasses and back, a foam builds on top of the tea. Sahelian tea is a social occasion and three infusions, the first one very bitter (\\"bitter as death\\"), the second in between (\\"flavorful as life\\") and the last one rather sweet (\\"sweet as love\\") are taken in the course of several hours. Drinking tea is a social activity that is accompanied by conversation and storytelling. Central Asia Tea was transported to Central Asia by way of the Silk Road. In Kazakhstan traditional tea is black traditionally with milk, in Uzbekistan traditional tea is green. Europe=Czech Republic and Slovakia Specific tea culture has developed in the Czech Republic in recent years, including many styles of tearooms. Despite having the same name, they differ from British tearooms. Pure teas are usually prepared with respect to their country of origin, and good tea palaces may offer 80 teas from almost all tea- producing countries. Different tea rooms have also created blends and methods of preparation and serving. Although less visible than in the Czech Republic, tea culture exists in Slovakia. Tea rooms are considered an underground environment by many, but they continue to pop up almost in every middle-sized town. These tea rooms are appreciated for offering quiet environments with pleasant music. More importantly, they are usually non-smoking, unlike most pubs and caf√©s. Germany A German teapot with a hinged lid, 18th century The region of East Frisia is noted for its consumption of tea and its tea culture.Tea Ceremony Strong blends of Assam tea, Ceylon and Darjeeling (East- Frisian Blend) are served whenever there are visitors to an East Frisian home or other gathering, as well as with breakfast, mid-afternoon, and mid-evening. The traditional preparation is as follows: A Kluntje, a white rock candy sugar that melts slowly, is added to the empty cup (allowing multiple cups to be sweetened) then tea is poured over the Kluntje. A heavy cream \\"cloud\\" (\\"W√∂lkje\\"‚Äîa diminutive of 'cloud' in Frisian) is added to the tea \\"water\\", the sugar represents \\"land\\". It is served without a spoon and traditionally drunk unstirred, i. e. in three tiers: In the beginning, one predominantly tastes the cream, then the tea and finally the sweet taste of kluntje at the bottom of the cup. Stirring the tea would blend all three tiers into one and spoil the traditional tea savouring. The tea is generally served with small cookies during the week and cakes during special occasions or on weekends as a special treat.East Frisian tea served in traditional patterned tea service. The tea is said to cure headaches, stomach problems, and stress, among many other ailments. The tea set is commonly decorated with an East Friesian Rose design. As a guest, it is considered impolite to drink fewer than three cups of tea. Placing your cup upside down on the saucer or your spoon in the cup signals that you are finished and want no more tea. Russia Glass of tea in a Kolchugino, a classic Soviet glass holder, commemorating Soviet space exploration The podstakannik ('–ø–æ–¥—Å—Ç–∞–∫–∞–Ω–Ω–∏–∫'), or tea glass holder (literally \\"thing under the glass\\"), is a part of Russian tea tradition. A Russian tea glass-holder is a traditional way of serving and drinking tea in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, other CIS and ex-USSR countries. Expensive podstakanniks are made from silver, classic series are made mostly from nickel silver, cupronickel, and other alloys with nickel, silver or gold plating. In Russia, it is customary to drink tea brewed separately in a teapot and diluted with freshly boiled water ('pair-of-teapots tea', '—á–∞–π –ø–∞—Ä–æ–π —á–∞–π–Ω–∏–∫–æ–≤'). Traditionally, the tea is very strong, its strength often indicating the hosts' degree of hospitality. The traditional implement for boiling water for tea used to be the samovar (and sometimes it still is, though usually electric). Tea is a family event, and is usually served after each meal with sugar (one to three teaspoonfuls per cup) and lemon (but without milk), and an assortment of jams, pastries and confections. Black tea is commonly used, with green tea gaining popularity as a more healthy, more \\"Oriental\\" alternative. Teabags are not used in the traditional Russian tea ceremony, only loose, large-leaf black tea. In Russian prisons, where alcohol and drugs are prohibited, inmates often brew very strong tea known as 'chifir', in order to experience its mood-altering properties. France A sign for a Salon de Th√© in the shape of a teapot in Paris While France is well known for its coffee drinking, afternoon tea has long been a social habit of the upper- middle class. Mariage Fr√®res is a famous high-end tea shop from Paris, active since 1854. The French tea market is still only a fraction of the British one (a consumption of per person a year compared to about in the UK), but it has doubled from 1995 to 2005 and is growing steadily. Tea in France is of the black variety, but Asian green teas and fruit-flavoured teas are becoming increasingly popular. French people generally drink tea in the afternoon. It is often taken in salons de th√©. Tea is generally served with some pastries, both sweet and pastries made especially for tea. Ireland An Irish caf√©, The Tea Junction in Ballyvaughan, County Clare, Ireland Ireland is the second- biggest per capita consumers of tea in the world with consumption of per person per year. Although broadly similar to tea culture in the United Kingdom, Irish tea culture's main distinguishing feature are the slightly spicier and stronger flavours than traditional English Blends. Popular brands of tea sold in Ireland are Barry's, Bewley's and Lyons. Portugal Tea growing in Portugal takes place in the Azores, a group of islands located west of Mainland Portugal. Portugal was the first to introduce the practice of drinking tea to Europe as well as the first European country to produce tea. In 1750, terrains ranging from the fields of Capelas to those of Porto Formoso on the island of S√£o Miguel were used for the first trial crops of tea, delivering of black tea and of green tea. A century later, with the introduction of skilled workers from the Macau Region of China in 1883, production became significant and the culture expanded. Following the instructions of these workers, the species Jasminum grandiflorum and Malva vacciones were introduced to give 'nobility' to the tea aroma, though only the Jasminum was used. This tea is currently traded under the name of the processed compound, Gorreana, and is produced by independent families. No herbicides or pesticides are allowed in the growing process, and modern consumers associate the production with more recent organic teas. However, production standards concerning the plant itself and its cropping have not changed for the last 250 years. United Kingdom Black tea with just added‚Äîand not yet stirred in‚Äîmilk The British are one of the largest tea consumers in the world, with each person consuming on average per year.http://faostat3.fao.org/home/index.html ‚Üí Download ‚Üí Food Supply ‚Üí Crops Primary Equivalent Tea is usually black tea served with milk and sometimes with sugar. Strong tea served with milk and optionally one or more teaspoons of sugar, usually in a mug, is commonly referred to as builder's tea for its association with builders and more broadly with the working class. Much of the time in the United Kingdom, tea drinking is not the delicate, refined cultural expression that the rest of the world imagines‚Äîa cup (or commonly a mug) of tea is something drunk frequently throughout the day. This is not to say that the British do not have a more formal tea ceremony, but tea breaks are an essential part of the working day. The term is often shortened to 'tea', essentially indicating a break. This term was exported to the game of cricket and consequently to most other countries of the former British Empire. History Box for the storage of loose tea leaves known as a tea caddy The popularity of tea dates back to the 19th century when India was part of the British Empire, and British interests controlled tea production in the subcontinent. It was, however, first introduced in the UK by the Portuguese Catherine of Braganza, queen consort of Charles II in the 1660s and 1670s. As tea spread throughout the United Kingdom and through the social classes, tea gardens and tea dances developed. These would include watching fireworks or a dinner party and dance, concluding with an evening tea. The tea gardens lost value after World War II but tea dances are still held today in the UK. Some scholars suggest that tea played a role in the Industrial Revolution. Afternoon tea possibly became a way to increase the number of hours labourers could work in factories; the stimulants in the tea, accompanied by sugary snacks, would give workers energy to finish out the day's work. Further, tea helped alleviate some of the consequences of the urbanisation that accompanied the industrial revolution: drinking tea required boiling one's water, thereby killing water-borne diseases like dysentery, cholera, and typhoid. Tea as a meal An example of a full afternoon tea service. In the United Kingdom tea is not only the name of the beverage, but also the name of a meal. The kind of meal that a person means depends very much on their social background and where they live. The differentiation in usage between dinner, supper, lunch and tea is one of the classic social markers of British English (see U and non-U English). Commonwealth countries Afternoon tea and its variants are the best known \\"tea ceremony\\" in the Commonwealth countries, available in homes and commercial establishments. In some varieties of English, \\"tea\\" refers to a savoury meal. Taiwanese bubble tea, known locally as pearl milk tea, has become widely popular in urban Australia and New Zealand, with multiple chains in every major city. North America=Canada In Canada, various types of tea are used by many different indigenous tribes as healing and ceremonial medicines. For example, Ojibwe and Cree tribes in Ontario use Cedar Tea during sweat lodge ceremonies to cleanse and nourish their bodies. When European settlers arrived on North American shores, it was the indigenous people that taught them to make pine needle tea to help cure their scurvy; pine needles are a great source of vitamin C. Tea remains a popular hot drink among Canadians of European (especially British and Irish) heritage. Black orange pekoe tea and other breakfast style teas may be drunk with the morning meal or as a part of a mid-morning or afternoon break. These types of teas are typically served with milk and sugar. Red Rose and King Cole are some of the more well-known Canadian brands of tea, and the Tim Hortons chain of caf√©s serves their ready- to-drink hot ‚Äústeeped tea‚Äù, a strong breakfast-style tea. Cookies, tea biscuits or scones, and other pastries may accompany any tea that is served, but formal ‚Äúafternoon tea\\" in the British tradition is typically confined to tourist destinations, such as Victoria‚Äôs Empress Hotel or Toronto‚Äôs Royal York Hotel. United States Iced tea is popular in the United States In the United States, tea can typically be served at all meals as an alternative to coffee, when served hot, or soft drinks, when served iced. Tea is also consumed throughout the day as a beverage. Afternoon tea, the meal done in the English tradition, is rarely served in the United States, although it remains romanticized by small children; it is usually reserved for special occasions like tea parties. Rather than drinking tea hot, many Americans prefer tea served with ice. In fact, in the United States, about 80% of the tea consumed is served cold, or \\"iced\\". Iced tea has become an iconic symbol of the Southern United States and Southern hospitality, often appearing alongside summer barbecue cooking or grilled foods. Iced tea is often made as sweet tea, which is simply iced tea with copious amounts of sugar or sweetener. Iced tea can be purchased like soda, in canned or bottled form at vending machines and convenience stores. This pre-made tea is usually sweetened. Sometimes some other flavorings, such as lemon or raspberry, are added. Many restaurants dispense iced tea brewed throughout the day from upright containers. Decaffeinated tea is widely available in the United States, for those who wish to reduce the physiological effects of caffeine. Before World War II, the US preference for tea was equally split between green tea and black tea, 40% and 40%, with the remaining 20% preferring oolong tea. The war cut off the United States from its primary sources of green tea, China and Japan, leaving it with tea almost exclusively from British-controlled India, which produced black tea. After the war, nearly 99% of tea consumed was black tea. Green, oolong, and white teas have recently become more popular again, and are often touted as health foods. Fast food coffee chains have made a huge impact on how Americans are exposed to herbal and exotic teas. Once considered a rarity, chai, based on Indian masala chai, has actually become a popular option for people who might drink a caff√® latte. Although not as commercialized, Taiwanese-style Bubble tea has also become popular in the United States in recent years, often served in small local cafes in the same style as many coffee drinks. South America=Argentina While Argentina is mainly a coffee culture due to its roots in Spain and Italy, Argentina shares in the unique mate culture of the Rioplatense region. Argentines are known for carrying around a mate, or gourd, and bombilla, a special straining straw, to share mate with friends, family, and strangers throughout the day. The tea itself is known as yerba mate. Brazil Brazilian tea culture has its origins with the infused beverages, or ch√°s (), made by the indigenous cultures of the Amazon region. It has evolved since the Portuguese colonial period to include imported varieties and tea-drinking customs. There is a folk knowledge in Brazil which says that Brazilians, mainly the urban ones, have a greater taste for using sugar in teas than in other cultures due to the lack of habit to unsweetened drinks. Chile Chilean tea consumption per capita ranks amongst the highest in the world, and is by far the highest within Latin America. Chile's tea culture draws back to both English immigration and the general Anglophilia within the Chilean elites during the 19th century, with consumption of the drink spreading quickly among all social classes as inexpensive alternatives reached the market. Besides black and green tea, Chileans often store herbal infusions, such as chamomile and matico. Although there isn't a fixed moment of the day for tea consumption (it being a common breakfast alternative to coffee, and also a regular after-lunch staple), it is most commonly associated with the late afternoon meal of the once (lit. 'elevenses' in Spanish, though contrary to most variations of the meal it is not a morning snack), which most Chileans report as having instead of dinner.

The Congo Basin is located in Central Africa, in a region known as west equatorial Africa. The Congo Basin region is sometimes known simply as the Congo. The basin begins in the highlands of the East African Rift system with input from the Chambeshi River, the Uele and Ubangi Rivers in the upper reaches and the Lualaba River draining wetlands in the middle reaches. Due to the young age and active uplift of the East African Rift at the headlands, the river's yearly sediment load is very large but the drainage basin occupies large areas of low relief throughout much of its area. The basin is a total of 3.7 million square kilometers and is home to some of the largest undisturbed stands of tropical rainforest on the planet, in addition to large wetlands. The basin ends where the river empties its load in the Gulf of Guinea on the Atlantic Ocean. The climate is equatorial tropical, with two rainy seasons including very high rainfalls, and high temperature year round. The basin is home to the endangered western lowland gorilla. The basin was the watershed of the Congo River populated by pygmy peoples, and eventually Bantu peoples migrated there and founded the Kingdom of Kongo. Belgium, France, and Portugal later established colonial control over the entire region by the late 19th century. The General Act of the Berlin Conference of 1885 gave a precise definition to the \\"conventional basin\\" of the Congo, which included the entire actual basin plus some other areas. The General Act bound its signatories to neutrality within the conventional basin, but this was not respected during the First World War.  Congo region  Congo is a traditional name for the equatorial Middle Africa that lies between the Gulf of Guinea and the African Great Lakes. It contains some of the largest tropical rainforests in the world.

It is home to okapi, bonobo and the Congo peafowl, but is also an important source of African teak, used for building furniture and flooring. An estimated 40 million people depend on these woodlands, surviving on traditional livelihoods. At a global level, Congo's forests act as the planet's second lung, counterpart to the rapidly dwindling Amazon. They are a huge \\"carbon sink,\\" trapping carbon that could otherwise remain carbon dioxide. The Congo Basin holds roughly 8 percent of the world's forest-based carbon. These forests also affect rainfall across the North Atlantic. In other words, these forests are crucial to the future of climate stability, a bulwark against runaway climate change. A moratorium on logging in the Congo forest was agreed with the World Bank and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (RDC, R√©publique D√©mocratique du Congo) in May 2002. The World Bank agreed to provide $90 million of development aid to RDC with the proviso that the government did not issue any new concessions granting logging companies rights to exploit the forest. The deal also prohibited the renewal of existing concessions. Greenpeace is calling on the World Bank to \\"think outside the box\\" and use the forest's potential in the battle against climate change. If these woodlands are deforested, the carbon they trap will be released into the atmosphere. It says that 8% of the Earth's forest-based carbon is stored in the RDC's forests. Predictions for future unabated deforestation estimate that by 2050 activities in the DRC will release roughly the same amount of carbon dioxide as the United Kingdom has emitted over the last 60 years. The government has written a new forestry code that requires companies to invest in local development and follow a sustainable, twenty- five-year cycle of rotational logging. When a company is granted a concession from the central government to log in Congo, it must sign an agreement with the local chiefs and hereditary land owners, who give permission for it to extract the trees in return for development packages. In theory, the companies must pay the government nearly $18 million rent a year for these concessions, of which 40% should be returned to provincial governments for investment in social development of the local population in the logged areas. In its current form, the Kyoto Protocol does not reward so-called \\"avoided deforestation\\"‚Äîinitiatives that protect forest from being cut down. But many climate scientists and policymakers hope that negotiations for Kyoto's successor will include such measures. If this were the case, there could be a financial incentive for protecting forests. L‚Äô√éle Mbiye in Kisangani is part of the Sustainable Forest Management in Africa Symposium project of forest ecosystem conservation conducted by Stellenbosch University. RDC is also looking to expand the area of forest under protection, for which it hopes to secure compensation through emerging markets for forest carbon. The main Congolese environmental organization working to save the forests is an NGO called OCEAN, which serves as the link between international outfits like Greenpeace and local community groups in the concessions.

Professional wrestling career=World Wrestling Federation (1999) Webb was hired by the World Wrestling Federation to make a one night appearance initially as a model.http://lornemarrfitafter45.ca/alicia-webb/ On January 11, 1999, Alicia debuted on Raw as \\"Ryan Shamrock\\", the kayfabe younger sister of Ken Shamrock. Val Venis flirted with her at ringside before his match, which led to Ken Shamrock running out and viciously attacking Venis, warning him to stay away from her. After giving Venis a beating, Billy Gunn appeared at the ring and flirtatiously mooned Ryan. Ken then went after Gunn, challenging him to an Intercontinental title match at the Royal Rumble. On January 25, Ryan was officially introduced to the viewers by Val Venis. It was revealed that she had starred with Venis in the fictional pornographic film Saving Ryan's Privates. At St. Valentine's Day Massacre, Ryan slapped Ken across the face, which caused him to lose his match to Venis. On February 13, Ken Shamrock viciously attacked Val Venis and the WWF referees during an interview. On February 15, Ryan helped Venis win his match after she was accidentally knocked off the apron only to be dumped by Venis following. That same night backstage, Billy Gunn tried consoling Ryan only to be attacked from behind by Ken. On March 1, Ryan came down to the ring during a match involving Venis, Shamrock and Goldust and was kissed by Goldust afterwards. On March 8, Ryan managed Goldust in a match against Ken. At Wrestlemania 15, Ryan and The Blue Meanie were in Goldust's corner for the Fatal Four Way match for the Intercontinental Championship, which Road Dogg retained. On the April 5 episode of Raw, The Undertaker and his disciples decided to sacrifice Ryan as a way of sending a message to Stephanie McMahon and Vince McMahon. The next week on April 12, Ryan was found by Mankind in the boiler room. Later in the night, The Undertaker revealed to Ken that Ryan was in the boiler room. As Ken found Ryan, who was being consoled by Mankind, they were attacked by the Ministry of Darkness and The Undertaker grabbed her by the hair and called her \\"a little slut\\". Having disappeared from the WWF for over a month, Ryan returned on the May 16, episode WWF Heat, distracting Droz during a tag team match, causing a loss against The Brood. Ryan then joined the Pretty Mean Sisters (PMS) stable with Terri Runnels and Jacqueline. She was depicted as a heel alongside Terri Runnels and Jacqueline Moore. On an episode of RAW, GTV revealed footage of the Pretty Mean Sisters in the locker room wearing towels. After being with PMS for three months, Webb was released from the WWF in July 1999. Webb later claimed that she was released because she refused to sign a five-year contract with the company. Other accusations were that Joanie Laurer had hated her and often messed with her possessions in the locker room. There were plans apparently by Vince McMahon to do an incest angle between Webb and her storyline brother Ken Shamrock, whom she was dating in real life at the time.http://www.icelebritieshub.com/ryan-shamrock-wrestler-biography-2/ World Championship Wrestling (1999‚Äì2000) Webb later debuted in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) on their Nitro show as \\"Symphony\\", the valet of The Maestro late in 1999. She was depicted as being \\"very nice\\" and also grew flowers and roses. On December 23, 1999, Symphony, Madusa and Spice were in a promo with Evan Karagias to show how women \\"act\\".https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMKWV-Rl8Y4 On February 21, 2000, Symphony turned down a date from Buff Bagwell. After managing the Maestro for five months, the Maestro was released from WCW. In August 2000, Webb was also released from WCW. Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2002) She made her debut for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) as \\"Aleesha\\". Following this, Webb began to appear as a talent scout, appearing on the ramp and accepting money from various wrestlers. The storyline didn't go anywhere and Webb left the promotion shortly thereafter. AAA (2007‚Äì2009) In May 2007, she began working with the Mexican promotion AAA while managing X-Pac, whom she also dated during this time. While managing X-Pac, Webb became part of La Legi√≥n Extranjera until sometime in 2009.http://www.cagematch.net/?id=2&nr;=2371&page;=8 Independent circuit (1999-2013) Webb made her debut for the National Wrestling Alliance as Ryan Shamrock, competing in an Evening Gown match against Bobcat on October 30, 1999.http://smartmarkvideo.com/nwa-new-jersey-oct-30-1999-n-brunswick-nj She then wrestled on the Independent circuit against wrestlers such as Nicole Bass, Kara Slice, and Taylor Matheny as well as managing Ken Shamrock. On August 17, 2013, Webb managed Daivari in a match where he lost to Matt Hardy, who was managed by Reby Sky.

The Pyramid Texts are the oldest ancient Egyptian funerary texts, dating to the late Old Kingdom. They are the earliest known corpus of ancient Egyptian religious texts. Written in Old Egyptian, the pyramid texts were carved onto the subterranean walls and sarcophagi of pyramids at Saqqara from the end of the Fifth Dynasty, and throughout the Sixth Dynasty of the Old Kingdom, and into the Eighth Dynasty of the First Intermediate Period. The oldest of the texts have been dated to c. 2400‚Äì2300 BC. Unlike the later Coffin Texts and Book of the Dead, the Pyramid Texts were reserved only for the pharaoh and were not illustrated. The use and occurrence of Pyramid Texts changed between the Old, Middle, and New Kingdoms of Ancient Egypt. During the Old Kingdom (2686 BCE ‚Äì 2181 BCE), Pyramid Texts could be found in the pyramids of kings as well as three queens, named Wedjebten, Neith, and Iput. During the Middle Kingdom (2055 BCE ‚Äì 1650 BCE), Pyramid Texts were not written in the pyramids of the pharaohs, but the traditions of the pyramid spells continued to be practiced. In the New Kingdom (1550 BCE ‚Äì 1070 BCE), Pyramid Texts were found on tombs of officials.  History of discovery and publication  French archaeologist and Egyptologist Gaston Maspero, director of the French Institute for Oriental Archaeology in Cairo, arrived in Egypt in 1880. He chose a site in South Saqqara, a hill that had been mapped by the Prussian Egyptologist Karl Richard Lepsius in 1842, for his first archaeological dig. There, Maspero found the ruins of a large structure, which he concluded must be the pyramid of Pepi I of the Sixth Dynasty. During the excavations he was able to gain access to the subterranean rooms, and discovered that the walls of the structure were covered in hieroglyphic text. Maspero contacted the 'director of the excavations' in Egypt, Auguste Mariette, to inform him of the discovery. Mariette concluded that the structure must be a mastaba, as no writing had previously been discovered in a pyramid. Merenre I, one of the earliest pyramids in which Maspero discovered the Pyramid Texts.alt=A photograph of the mound of sand that comprises the destroyed remains of the pyramid, called 'Merenre's beauty shines', which belonged to Merenre Nemtyemsaf I. Maspero continued his excavations at a second structure, around one kilometre south-west of the first, in search of more evidence. This second structure was determined to be the pyramid of Merenre I, Pepi I's successor. In it, Maspero discovered the same hieroglyphic text on the walls he'd found in Pepi I's pyramid, and the mummy of a man in the sarcophagus of the burial chamber. This time, he visited Mariette personally, who again rejected the findings, saying on his deathbed that \\"[i]n thirty years of Egyptian excavations I have never seen a pyramid whose underground rooms had hieroglyphs written on their walls.\\" Throughout 1881, Maspero continued to direct investigations of other sites in Saqqara, and more texts were found in each of the pyramids of Unas, Teti and Pepi II. Maspero began publishing his findings in the Recueil des Travaux from 1882 and continued to be involved until 1886 in the excavations of the pyramid in which the texts had been found. Maspero published the first corpora of the text in 1894 in French under the title Les inscriptions des pyramides de Saqqarah. Translations were made by German Egyptologist Kurt Heinrich Sethe to German in 1908‚Äì1910 in Die alt√§gyptischen Pyramidentexte. The concordance that Sethe published is considered to be the standard version of the texts. Samuel A. B. Mercer published a translation into English of Sethe's work in 1952. British Egyptologist Raymond O. Faulkner presented the texts in English in 1969 in The Ancient Egyptian Pyramid Texts. Between 1926 and 1932, Gustave J√©quier conducted the first systematic investigations of Pepi II and his wives' pyramids ‚Äì Neith, Iput II, and Wedjebetni. J√©quier also conducted the excavations of Qakare Ibi's pyramid. He later published the complete corpus of texts found in these five pyramids. Since 1958, expeditions under the directions of Jean-Philippe Lauer, Jean Sainte-Fare Garnot, and Jean Leclant have undertaken a major restoration project of the pyramids belonging to Teti, Pepi I, and Merenre I, as well as the pyramid of Unas. By 1999, the pyramid of Pepi had been opened to the public. Debris was cleared away from the pyramid while research continued under the direction of . The corpus of pyramid texts in Pepi I's pyramid were published in 2001. In 2010, more such texts were discovered in Behenu's tomb. To date, Pyramid Texts have been discovered in the pyramids of these pharaohs and queens: { style=\\"text-align:left;\\" - style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\" Unas  Dynasty V  pharaoh ca. 2353-2323 BCE - style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\" Teti  Dynasty VI  pharaoh ca. 2323-2291 BCE - style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\" Pepi I  Dynasty VI  pharaoh ca. 2289-2255 BCE - style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"  Akhesenpepi II  Dynasty VI  wife of Pepi I - style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"  Merenre I  Dynasty VI  pharaoh ca. 2255-2246 BCE - style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"  Pepi II  Dynasty VI  pharaoh ca. 2246-2152 BCE - style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"  Neith  Dynasty VI  wife of Pepi II - style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"  Iput II  Dynasty VI  wife of Pepi II - style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"  Wedjebetni  Dynasty VI  wife of Pepi II - style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"  Behenu  Dynasty VI  probable wife of Pepi II - style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"  Qakare Ibi  Dynasty VIII  pharaoh ca. 2109‚Äì2107 BCE }  Purpose  The spells, or utterances, of the Pyramid Texts were primarily concerned with enabling the transformation of the deceased into an Akh (where those judged worthy could mix with the gods). The spells of the Pyramid Texts are divided into two broad categories: Sacerdotal texts and Personal texts. The sacerdotal texts are ritual in nature, and were conducted by the lector priest addressing the deceased in the second person. They consist of offering spells, short spells recited in the presentation of an offering, and recitations which are predominantly instructional. These texts appear in the Offering and Insignia Rituals, the Resurrection Ritual, and in the four pyramids containing the Morning Ritual. The writing in these texts (Dramatic Texts) suggests the formulation of these texts may have occurred around the time of the Second and Third dynasties. The remaining texts are personal, and are broadly concerned with guiding the spirit out of the tomb, and into new life. They consist of provisioning, transition, and apotropaic or protective texts. The provisioning texts deal with the deceased taking command of his own food-supply, and demanding nourishment from the gods. One example of these texts is the king's response in Unas' pyramid. The transition texts otherwise known as the Sakhu or Glorifications are predominantly about the transformation of the deceased into an Akh, and their ascent, mirroring the motion of the gods, into the sky. These texts form the largest part of the corpus, and are dominated by the youngest texts composed in the Fifth and possibly Sixth dynasties. Apotropaic texts consist of short protective spells for warding off threats to the body and tomb. Due to the archaic style of writing, these texts are considered to be the oldest, and are the most difficult to interpret. These utterances were meant to be chanted by those who were reciting them. They contained many verbs such as \\"fly\\" and \\"leap,\\" depicting the actions taken by the pharaohs to get to the afterlife. The spells delineate all of the ways the pharaoh could travel, including the use of ramps, stairs, ladders and, most importantly flying. The spells could also be used to call the gods to help, even threatening them if they did not comply. It was common for the pyramid texts to be written in the first person, but not uncommon for texts to be later changed to the third person. Often this depended on who was reciting the texts and who they were recited for. Many of the texts include accomplishments of the pharaoh as well as the things they did for the Egyptian people during the time of their rule. These texts were used to both guide the pharaohs to the afterlife, but also to inform and assure the living that the soul made it to its final destination.  Appearance in pyramids = Pyramid of Unas  alt=Photograph of Unas' burial chamber. A tall but damaged black sarcophagus stands near the west wall. The walls surrounding the sarcophagus painted to resemble reed mats, and the royal palace fa√ßade. The gabled roof is painted with five-pointed gold stars. The west gable is inscribed with horizontal lines of hieroglyphs. These spells serve to protect the pharaoh in his sarcophagus. The texts first appeared in the pyramid of the last pharaoh of the Fifth Dynasty, that belonging to Unas. A total of 283 spells appear on the subterranean walls of Unas' pyramid. These spells are the smallest and best- preserved corpus of the texts in the Old Kingdom. Copies of all but a single spell, PT 200, inscribed in the pyramid appeared throughout the Middle Kingdom and later, including a near-complete replica of the texts inscribed in the tomb of Senwosretankh at El-Lisht. Unas' pyramid, situated between the pyramids of Djoser and Sekhemkhet in North Saqqara, was the smallest of those built in the Old Kingdom. It had a core built six steps high from roughly dressed limestone, encased in a layer of carefully cut fine white limestone. It had a base length of with an incline of 56¬∞ which gave the pyramid a height of . The substructure was accessed through an entrance in the pavement of a chapel on the north face of the pyramid. The entry led into a downward sloping corridor, followed by a 'corridor-chamber' with three granite portcullises that guarded the entrance into the horizontal passage. The horizontal passage ends at the antechamber of the substructure and is guarded by a fourth granite portcullis. The antechamber connects to two further rooms, a room with three recesses for holding statues called the serdab to the east, and the burial chamber with the ruler's sarcophagus to the west. The roofs of both the antechamber and burial chamber were gabled. With the exception of the walls immediately surrounding the sarcophagus, which were lined with alabaster and painted to resemble reed mats with a wood-frame enclosure, the remaining walls of the antechamber, burial chamber, and a section of the horizontal passage were covered with vertical columns of hieroglyphs that make up the Pyramid Texts. Unas' sarcophagus was left without inscription. The king's royal titulary did not appear on the walls surrounding it, as it does in later pyramids. The west gable of the burial chamber is inscribed with protective spells; in later pyramids the gable was used for texts commending the king to Nut, and, from Pepi I onwards, also for Sakhu, or 'glorifications', for the transformation into an Akh. The other walls of the burial chamber are primarily dedicated to ritual texts. The north wall, along with the northern part of the east wall and passage, is dedicated to the Offering Ritual. Spatial considerations required that part of the ritual be inscribed on other walls, and likely explains the omission of the Insignia Ritual altogether from the pyramid. The Offering Ritual, from the 'initial libation' to the 'dedication of offerings', occupies the north wall; it is arrayed into three horizontal registers. Kurt Sethe's first edition of the pyramid texts contained 714 distinct spells. Later additional spells were discovered, for a total of 759. No single edition includes all recorded spells. The set up and layout of the Unas pyramid were replicated and expanded on for future pyramids. The causeway ran 750 meters long and is still in good condition, unlike many causeways found in similar ancient Egyptian pyramids. In the pyramid of Unas, the ritual texts could be found in the underlying supporting structure. The antechamber and corridor contained texts and spells personalized to the Pharaoh himself. The following example comes from the pyramid of Unas. It was to be recited in the South Side Burial Chamber and Passage, and it was the Invocation to New Life. Utterance 213: > Ho, Unis! You have not gone away dead: you have gone away alive. > Sit on Osiris's chair, with your baton in your arm, and govern the living; > with your water lily scepter in your arm, and govern those > of the inaccessible places. > Your lower arms are of Atum, your upper arms of Atum, your belly of > Atum, your back of Atum, your rear of Atum, your legs of Atum, your > face of Anubis. > Horus's mounds shall serve you; Seth's mounds shall serve you.  Offerings and rituals  The various pyramid texts often contained writings of rituals and offerings to the gods. Examples of these rituals are the opening of the mouth ceremony, offering rituals, and insignia ritual. Both monetary and prayer-based offerings were made in the pyramids and were written in the pyramid texts in hopes of getting the pharaoh to a desirable afterlife. Rituals such as the opening of the mouth and eye ceremony were very important for the Pharaoh in the afterlife. This ceremony involved the Kher-Heb (the chief lector priest), along with assistants, opening the eyes and mouth of the dead while reciting prayers and spells. Mourners were encouraged to cry out as special instruments were used to cut holes in the mouth. After the ceremony was complete, it was believed that the dead could eat, speak, breathe, and see in the afterlife. The Egyptian pyramids are made up of various corridors, tunnels, and rooms, each of which have differing significance and use during the burial and ritual processes. Texts were written and recited by priests in a very particular order, often starting in the Valley Temple and finishing in the Coffin or Pyramid Room. The variety of offerings and rituals were also most likely recited in a particular order. The Valley Temple often contained an offering shrine, where rituals would be recited.  Queens with pyramid texts  Pyramid texts were found not only in the tombs of kings, but those of queens as well. Queen Neith, who was the wife of Pepi II, is one of three queens of the 6th dynasty whose tomb contains pyramid texts. The pyramids of the other two queens (both also thought to be wives of Pepi II), Iput II and Wedjebetni, also contained tombs inscribed with texts. Those of Neith have been kept in much better condition. Compared to the tombs of the kings, the layout and structure of those that belonged to these queens were much simpler. But the layout of the texts corresponded to similar walls and locations as those of the kings. For example, the Resurrection Ritual is found on the east end of the south wall. Due to the fact that the pyramid of Neith did not contain an antechamber, many of the spells normally written there were also written on the south wall. The texts of Queen Neith were similar and different from those of the kings in a few additional ways. Like those of the kings, the use of both the first and third person is present in these pyramid texts. Neith's name is used throughout the texts to make them more personal. Many of the pronouns used throughout her pyramid texts are male, indicative of the parallels between the texts of the kings and queens, but a few female pronouns can be found. The texts also contain spells and utterances that are meant to be read by both the spirit herself as well as others addressing her.  Examples  After death, the king must first rise from his tomb. Utterance 373 describes: :Oho! Oho! Rise up, O Teti! :Take your head, collect your bones, :Gather your limbs, shake the earth from your flesh! :Take your bread that rots not, your beer that sours not, :Stand at the gates that bar the common people! :The gatekeeper comes out to you, he grasps your hand, :Takes you into heaven, to your father Geb. :He rejoices at your coming, gives you his hands, :Kisses you, caresses you, :Sets you before the spirits, the imperishable stars... :The hidden ones worship you, :The great ones surround you, :The watchers wait on you, :Barley is threshed for you, :Emmer is reaped for you, :Your monthly feasts are made with it, :Your half-month feasts are made with it, :As ordered done for you by Geb, your father, :Rise up, O Teti, you shall not die! The texts then describe several ways for the pharaoh to reach the heavens, and one of these is by climbing a ladder. In utterance 304 the king says: :Hail, daughter of Anubis, above the hatches of heaven, :Comrade of Thoth, above the ladder's rails, :Open Unas's path, let Unas pass! Another way is by ferry. If the boatman refuses to take him, the king has other plans: :If you fail to ferry Unas, :He will leap and sit on the wing of Thoth, :Then he will ferry Unas to that side!  Cannibal Hymn  Utterances 273 and 274 are sometimes known as the \\"Cannibal Hymn\\", because it describes the king hunting and eating parts of the gods: They represent a discrete episode (Utterances 273-274) in the anthology of ritual texts that make up the Pyramid Texts of the Old Kingdom period. Appearing first in the Pyramid of Unas at the end of the Fifth Dynasty, the Cannibal Hymn preserves an early royal butchery ritual in which the deceased king‚Äîassisted by the god Shezmu‚Äîslaughters, cooks and eats the gods as sacrificial bulls, thereby incorporating in himself their divine powers in order that he might negotiate his passage into the Afterlife and guarantee his transformation as a celestial divinity ruling in the heavens. The style and format of the Cannibal Hymn are characteristic of the oral-recitational poetry of pharaonic Egypt, marked by allusive metaphor and the exploitation of wordplay and homophony in its verbal recreation of a butchery ritual. Apart from the burial of Unas, only the Pyramid of Teti displays the Cannibal Hymn. :A god who lives on his fathers, :who feeds on his mothers... :Unas is the bull of heaven :Who rages in his heart, :Who lives on the being of every god, :Who eats their entrails :When they come, their bodies full of magic :From the Isle of Flame... The Cannibal Hymn later reappeared in the Coffin Texts as Spell 573. It was dropped by the time the Book of the Dead was being copied.  In popular culture  In the first scene of Philip Glass's opera Akhnaten, the phrase \\"Open are the double doors of the horizon\\" is a quotation from the Pyramid Texts. More specifically, it seems to come from Utterance 220. The American death metal band Nile made a song, \\"Unas Slayer of the Gods\\" which contains many references to the Pyramid Texts, including the Cannibal Hymn. In the 2001 action-adventure movie, The Mummy Returns, when Imhotep gets a jar full of dust and blows it, he quotes part of the Utterance 373 and the dust turns into mummy warriors. The 2013 BBC programme Ripper Street, Colonel Madoc Faulkner (Iain Glen) refers to a variant of Utterance 325  References  Notes  Sources        * *  Further reading   Timofey T.

That is, if the filter outputs signals R and S for two input signals r and s separately, but does not always output Œ±R + Œ≤S when the input is a linear combination Œ±r + Œ≤s. Both continuous-domain and discrete-domain filters may be nonlinear. A simple example of the former would be an electrical device whose output voltage R(t) at any moment is the square of the input voltage r(t); or which is the input clipped to a fixed range [a,b], namely R(t) = max(a, min(b, r(t))). An important example of the latter is the running-median filter, such that every output sample Ri is the median of the last three input samples ri, ri‚àí1, ri‚àí2. Like linear filters, nonlinear filters may be shift invariant or not. Non- linear filters have many applications, especially in the removal of certain types of noise that are not additive. For example, the median filter is widely used to remove spike noise ‚Äî that affects only a small percentage of the samples, possibly by very large amounts. Indeed, all radio receivers use non- linear filters to convert kilo- to gigahertz signals to the audio frequency range; and all digital signal processing depends on non-linear filters (analog-to-digital converters) to transform analog signals to binary numbers. However, nonlinear filters are considerably harder to use and design than linear ones, because the most powerful mathematical tools of signal analysis (such as the impulse response and the frequency response) cannot be used on them. Thus, for example, linear filters are often used to remove noise and distortion that was created by nonlinear processes, simply because the proper non-linear filter would be too hard to design and construct. From the foregoing, we can know that the nonlinear filters have quite different behavior compared to linear filters. The most important characteristic is that, for nonlinear filters, the filter output or response of the filter does not obey the principles outlined earlier, particularly scaling and shift invariance. Furthermore, a nonlinear filter can produce results that vary in a non-intuitive manner.  Linear system  Several principles define a linear system. The basic definition of linearity is that the output must be a linear function of the inputs, that is :\\\\alpha y_1(t) + \\\\beta y_2(t) = H \\\\left { \\\\alpha x_1(t) + \\\\beta x_2(t) \\\\right } for any scalar values \\\\alpha \\\\, and \\\\beta \\\\,. This is a fundamental property of linear system design, and is known as superposition. So, a system is said to be nonlinear if this equation is not valid. That is to say, when the system is linear, the superposition principle can be applied. This important fact is the reason that the techniques of linear-system analysis have been so well developed. Applications=Noise removal Signals often get corrupted during transmission or processing; and a frequent goal in filter design is the restoration of the original signal, a process commonly called \\"noise removal\\". The simplest type of corruption is additive noise, when the desired signal S gets added with an unwanted signal N that has no known connection with S. If the noise N has a simple statistical description, such as Gaussian noise, then a Kalman filter will reduce N and restore S to the extent allowed by Shannon's theorem. In particular, if S and N do not overlap in the frequency domain, they can be completely separated by linear bandpass filters. For almost any other form of noise, on the other hand, some sort of non-linear filter will be needed for maximum signal recovery. For multiplicative noise (that gets multiplied by the signal, instead of added to it), for example, it may suffice to convert the input to a logarithmic scale, apply a linear filter, and then convert the result to linear scale. In this example, the first and third steps are not linear. Non- linear filters may also be useful when certain \\"nonlinear\\" features of the signal are more important than the overall information contents. In digital image processing, for example, one may wish to preserve the sharpness of silhouette edges of objects in photographs, or the connectivity of lines in scanned drawings. A linear noise-removal filter will usually blur those features; a non-linear filter may give more satisfactory results (even if the blurry image may be more \\"correct\\" in the information-theoretic sense). Many nonlinear noise-removal filters operate in the time domain. They typically examine the input digital signal within a finite window surrounding each sample, and use some statistical inference model (implicitly or explicitly) to estimate the most likely value for the original signal at that point. The design of such filters is known as the filtering problem for a stochastic process in estimation theory and control theory. Examples of nonlinear filters include: * phase-locked loops * detectors * mixers * median filters * ranklets Nonlinear filter also occupy a decisive position in the image processing functions. In a typical pipeline for real-time image processing, it is common to have many nonlinear filter included to form, shape, detect, and manipulate image information. Furthermore, each of these filter types can be parameterized to work one way under certain circumstances and another way under a different set of circumstance using adaptive filter rule generation. The goals vary from noise removal to feature abstraction. Filtering image data is a standard process used in almost all image processing systems. Nonlinear filters are the most utilized forms of filter construction. For example, if an image contains a low amount of noise but with relatively high magnitude, then a median filter may be more appropriate.

She is best known for her stint in World Championship Wrestling under the ring name Asya. Early career Prior to her professional wrestling career, Wolf was originally a model for bikinis and Hawaiian Tropic. While modeling, Wolf began bodybuilding and won several titles on both the state and national level. Professional wrestling career=World Championship Wrestling (1999-2000)Beginnings= In March 1999, Wolf began appearing as a head nurse to tend to Ric Flair when he was (in storyline) put into a mental institution. She then appeared in several vignettes with him before becoming his valet upon his return to WCW. On the May 3, 1999 episode of Nitro, the Head Nurse accompanied Flair to the ring as he then called out \\"Macho Man\\" Randy Savage, whom he was feuding with. When Savage and his own valet, Gorgeous George, came out to the ring, Flair called security on Savage, resulting in George being choked out by the Head Nurse. The nurse was introduced as Double D when she, along with Ric Flair, Arn Anderson, and Samantha, accompanied Flair's son David to his United States Heavyweight Championship contest against Dean Malenko at the Bash at the Beach. During the match, Double D confronted Anderson, who got into the ring. Malenko intervened and, hesitating to hit a woman, instead locked her into his cloverleaf submission hold. Ric Flair took the opportunity to hit Malenko with the U.S. title belt to allow David to pin Malenko to retain the title. =The Revolution= On October 25 at Halloween Havoc, The Filthy Animals showed a video of them kidnapping Ric Flair and leaving him in the desert. After the video, they were attacked in the ring by Perry Saturn and Dean Malenko, who were members of the Revolution. The Animals' manager, Torrie Wilson, was kidnapped by Double D, who was introduced as Asya, the newest member of the Revolution. The name change was in reference to Chyna, who competed for WCW's rival the World Wrestling Federation, as well as implying that Asya was superior to Chyna since \\"Asia\\" is bigger than \\"China\\". Later on in the show, when the Filthy Animals attacked Malenko during a match against Chris Benoit, the Revolution used Torrie to blackmail the Animals into retreating. On the November 8 episode of Nitro, Asya made her in-ring debut as she and Malenko defeated Rey Misterio, Jr. and Torrie Wilson in a mixed tag team match. Three days later, on Thunder, the Revolution interfered in a match between Sid and Perry Saturn before being taken down by Sid. Asya stood up to Sid, who attempted to powerbomb her but was attacked by Rick Steiner. The following week on Nitro, Asya defeated Kimberly Page by disqualification with rival Torrie Wilson as guest referee. Post-match, Asya confronted Torrie only to be slapped by her. Asya responded by throwing her out of the ring. Page then tried to help Torrie by jumping on Asya's back to apply a sleeper hold only for Asya to snapmare her down. Later on in the show, Kimberly attempted to choke Asya out with her belt, leading to Asya's former ally David Flair coming out with a crowbar in hand to ward off Kimberly. In a twist, Asya hit David with a sidewalk slam before trying to hit him with his own crowbar. Flair recovered and then suplexed her before hitting Revolution member Shane Douglas with his crowbar before leaving the ring. The feud between the Filthy Animals and the Revolution concluded on November 21 at the Mayhem pay-per-view as Perry Saturn, Dean Malenko, and Asya defeated Eddie Guerrero, Billy Kidman, and Torrie Wilson in an elimination match, although Asya was the third competitor eliminated from the match. =Face Turn= Following the feud with the Filthy Animals, Asya began a string of several short-lived feuds. On the December 6 episode of Nitro, she wrestled fellow bodybuilder-turned- wrestler Midnight to a no contest. Following the match, Asya attacked Midnight until the Revolution came out and attacked Midnight with their flag. Three days later on Thunder, Asya fought \\"Hacksaw\\" Jim Duggan to a no contest. Asya finished her feud with Midnight as she, Saturn and Malenko defeated Midnight and Harlem Heat the following week on Nitro. At Starrcade, the Revolution (Shane Douglas, Perry Saturn, Dean Malenko, and Asya) defeated Jim Duggan and the newly reunited Varsity Club (Kevin Sullivan, Rick Steiner, and Mike Rotunda) after the Club turned on Duggan during the match. On the December 23 episode of Thunder, Asya, Saturn, and Malenko lost to Billy Kidman, Eddie Guerrero and Jim Duggan. On the January 6, 2000 episode of Thunder, Asya challenged Cruiserweight Champion Madusa for her title, but lost after the Revolution turned on her. Asya then feuded with the Revolution during house shows, teaming up with Chavo Guerrero, Jr. against Malenko and Saturn, losing to them twice before defeating them twice to end the feud. On January 10, Oklahoma made misogynistic comments before saying that he could beat any woman in the ring and that he would go on to beat Cruiserweight Champion Madusa. In response, Asya came out to the ring and gave Oklahoma a beating before Madusa came out. Six days later at Souled Out, Asya and former Nitro Girl Spice attacked Oklahoma during his title match with Madusa. Oklahoma managed to roll up Madusa for the win but after the match, Asya and Madusa poured barbecue sauce over him. After this, Asya began making sporadic appearances. On the April 15 episode of WorldWide, Asya lost to Mona via disqualification after Little Genie interfered. Post-match, both Asya and Genie attacked Mona before being pulled off by referees. On the May 3 episode of Thunder, both Mona and Asya were the only females in a battle royal between the Millionaire's Club and the New Blood to determine a contender for the World Heavyweight Championship, but they were both eliminated early on. =Alliance with Dale Torborg= On the June 14 episode of Thunder, Asya returned to WCW television disguised as a Sting fan at ringside. When Vampiro told her to remove her mask, she responded by spitting a red liquid into his face. Vampiro's opponent, The Demon (Dale Torborg), then appeared in the ring and the announcers revealed that The Demon and Asya were legit engaged. After Vampiro defeated the Demon, Asya tried to help her fianc√© but received a Nail in the Coffin from Vampiro. The Demon chased Vampiro away before tending to Asya in the ring and later retired his Demon gimmick. Five days later on Nitro, Vampiro called out Torborg and asked him \\"don't you have something missing in your life?\\", leaving Torborg puzzled by the question before the lights went out. Asya, who had accompanied Torborg, disappeared, prompting Torborg to go after Vampiro. The lights went out again and Vampiro also disappeared, escaping in a black hearse. On the June 21 episode of Thunder, Torborg attacked Vampiro, demanding to know where Asya was. Instead, Vampiro told him he would never know unless he became the Demon again. Torborg then followed Vampiro to a gravesite that Vampiro said Asya was in there. Vampiro hit Torborg with a shovel before getting Asya out of the trunk of his hearse. On the June 28 episode of Thunder, Vampiro came out proclaiming to have gotten rid of Sting, whom he was also feuding with, as well as Torborg and Asya. During his promo, the lights went out and Asya appeared in the ring before spitting a red liquid in his face as she did weeks prior. Torborg then attacked Vampiro with a baseball bat as the lights went out again and both Asya and Torborg were gone. The following week on Nitro, Asya was injured (in storyline) by an explosion during her entrance to the ring. Torborg wanted to tend to Asya in the hospital when a hooded figure (later revealed as Vampiro) handed him the Demon costume. Retirement On August 25, 2000, Wolf was released from her WCW contract. Personal life Wolf graduated with a degree in biotechnology. Wolf married Dale Torborg on October 5, 2000. The couple had their first child, a daughter named Sierra Raye, on August 18, 2005.

Sulfoquinovosyl diacylglycerol (SQDG), as the dipalmitoyl ester  Discovery, structure and chemical properties  In 1959 A. A. Benson and coworkers discovered a new sulfur-containing lipid in plants and identified it as sulfoquinovosyl diacylglycerol (SQDG). The sulfolipid structure was defined as 1,2-di-O-acyl-3-O-(6-deoxy-6-sulfo-Œ±-D- glucopyranosyl)-sn-glycerol (SQDG). The distinctive feature of this substance is carbon bonded directly to sulfur as C-SO3. Sulfonic acids of this type are chemically stable and strong acids.Barber and Gounaris, 1986  Biological occurrence and functions  SQDGs have been found in all photosynthetic plants, algae, cyanobacteria, purple sulfur and non-sulfur bacteria and is localised in the thylakoid membranes, being the most saturated glycolipid.Janero, Barrnett, 1981 SQDGs have been found to be closely associated with certain membrane proteins. In some cases the (electrostatic) interactions may be very strong, as suggested by the inability of saturated SQDG molecules associated with purified chloroplast CF0-CF1 ATPase to exchange with other acidic lipids.Pick et al., 1985 It was shown also that SQDGs protect CF1 against cold inactivation in the presence of some ATP. CF1 bound to membranes was found to be much more resistant to heat and cold than solubilised protein. Mitochondrial coupling factor F1 is similarly protected by phospholipids and SQDGs although, in that case, both were equally effective.Bennun and Racker, 1969Livn and Racker, 1969 Information about SQDG and the Rieske protein interaction in the cyt b6f structures is also present. SQDGs seem to be involved in the turnover of cyt f in a similar manner like D1 and raises the question of whether a similar mechanism underlies the role of SQDG in the assembly of both subunits.De Vitry et al. 2004 Extensive SQDG accumulation was observed in apple shoot bark and wood (Okanenko, 1977) and in pine thylakoid during the autumn hardening,Oquist, 1982 while heat and drought action upon wheat,Taran et al., 2000 at NaCl action in the halophyte Aster tripolium.Ramani, Zorn, Papenbrock, 2004 SQDG also inhibits viral development by interfering with DNA-polymerase and reverse transcriptase activity.Ohta et al. 1998, 2000  Biosynthesis  Biosynthesis of sulfoquinovosyl diacylglycerol (SQDG) from UDP-glucose. In cyanobacteria and plants, SQDG is synthesized in two steps. First, UDP-glucose and sulfite are combined by UDP- sulfoquinovose synthase (SQD1) to produce UDP-sulfoquinovose. Second, the sulfoquinovose portion of UDP-sulfoquinovose is transferred to diacylglycerol by the glycosyltransferase SQDG synthase, to form SQDG .  Degradation  SQDGs degrade during sulfur starvation in some species such as Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. This response is for the redistribution of its sulfur to make new protein.Sugimoto K et al. 2007 A wide range of bacteria cleave SQDG to form sulfoquinovose, and then metabolize the sulfoquinovose through a process termed sulfoglycolysis. SQDG are cleaved by enzymes termed sulfoquinovosidases.

Earth radio leakage research In order to sample the radio signature of Earth from an external site and thus test whether TV broadcasting is in fact the principal component, Sullivan and S. H. Knowles used the Moon as a passive reflector of Earth's radio frequency leakage. Using the 305-m Arecibo radio telescope, a wide range of frequencies were scanned between 100 and 400 MHz.

Songtan achieved city status in its own right in 1981, five years earlier than Pyeongtaek, but merged, along with Pyeongtaek County, into Pyeongtaek City in May 1995.ÏÜ°ÌÉÑÏùò Ïó∞ÌòÅ Most residents still consider it to have an identity separate from the rest of Pyeongtaek City. To appease some discontent at the merger Pyeongtaek city officials decided to keep the Songtan City Hall intact and convert it into a branch office of the Pyeongtak City Hall, as shown in the picture above, where Songtan residents can still go for city provided services. At consolidation, Songtan had over 110,000 residents, slightly less than the population of pre- consolidation Pyeongtaek City. The district has an administrative office which formerly served as Songtan City Hall. Songtan's best known feature is Osan Air Base, a United States Air Force base which spawned the growth of the area and is a major factor in the district's economy. Songtan Station and Seojeong-ri Station serve Songtan, and connect Songtan to Seoul and other cities like: Cheonan, Osan, Suwon, and Anyang via the Seoul Metropolitan Subway on Seoul Subway Line 1 . In addition to regular subway trains, Seojeong-ri Station features some Korail trains and Seoul Subway Line 1 Express subway trains. Pyeongtaek Station is two stops south of Seojeong-ri Station on Seoul Subway Line 1 and has a larger Korail Station. Administrative History *1914 ‚Äì Songtan Township (myeon) formed as part of Jinwi County (gun) *1924 ‚Äì Jinwi County renamed Pyeongtaek County *1963 ‚Äì Songtan Township promoted to Songtan Town (eup) *1981 ‚Äì Songtan Town promoted to Songtan City (shi), absorbing Seojong Township *1995 ‚Äì Songtan City, Pyeongtaek County and Pyeongtaek City merge into Pyeongtaek City Osan Air Base Osan Air Base is a forward deployed base of the United States Air Force. Osan City lies ten miles north of Songtan, but was the closest settlement of appreciable size when the base was built in 1951‚Äì52. Anecdotal evidence also suggests that Osan was chosen as the name because the names of nearby hamlets were difficult to pronounce (Seojong-ri was the closest town that existed at the time, two miles south). Osan hosts U.S. Air Force and Republic of Korea Air Force units. Outside the base Songtan continues to grow southward and eastward from the base and is now a major bedroom community for Seoul and Suwon workers. Hundreds of large multi-story apartment buildings house these commuters. Farther away from the base, Songtan appears as any other city in Gyeonggi-do, with high-rise apartments stretching to the south. Cityscape gives way to rural farmlands immediately west and about two miles east of the base. From the downtown bus station, buses run to Seoul, which is roughly 45 minutes north. In 2005 the subway/train line from Seoul connected to Cheonan, with a station in Songtan. Songtan connects to many other cities: Osan, Suwon, and Seoul to the north; and Pyeongtaek, Cheonan, and Daejeon to the south. There is a sizable foreign population; American military, Filipino and, before 9/11 Russian, reside in the immediate vicinity of the base with an increasing Chinese presence of small merchants. Sinjang Shopping Mall Immediately outside the base is a district with many bars, dance clubs, small shops, relator's offices and restaurants. This area is commonly referred to by foreigners as \\"downtown\\" or \\"the Ville\\" but is officially known as Sinjang-dong Shopping Mall. On weekends the streets are crowded with local residents, tourists, shoppers, military members (U.S and R.O.K.) and general partiers clogging the streets and enjoying the \\"festive\\" atmosphere. Famous for hostesses called \\"Juicy girls\\" who supply drinks to the customers, most downtown bars feature pool, darts, loud American music (mainly hip-hop, rock, and classic rock) and hookahs as the main attractions. Dart and pool leagues are somewhat popular among the military population. There is a growing music scene at bars that have local bands play on weekend nights. Small shops are a large part of the Shinjang area. In 1996 a portion of the main street leading off Osan AB was remade into a pedestrian mall, the Shinjang Shopping Mall. Some Americans are eager to buy custom-made clothing at prices somewhat cheaper than in the U.S. from the skilled artisans who line the mall. There are also leather workers and painters, hanji, traditional Korean souvenirs, and blanket shops which cater to the Americans. Customers may haggle with the shop owners to obtain the best deal, and the shop owners are usually willing to do the same. Some of the businesses are well-known food chains like McDonald's,http://mcdonalds.co.kr/#/home Popeyeshttp://popeyes.co.kr and Baskin-Robbins; however, most are small, individually owned shops, restaurants, and bars. Lining the middle of the pedestrian mall and streets are pojangmacha (small tents and carts) offering traditional Korean street foods such as hotteok, tteokbokki, mandu, and dakkochi (skewered chicken) better known in the area as chicken-on-a-stick. There are also small vendor tables selling colorful socks, hats, masks, tee-shirts, and other items and 'gray-market' tents selling copied DVDs. Sinjang-dong Shopping Mall is unique from many shopping strips in Korea because of its relatively large American/foreign presence. Thus, most stores, restaurants, and establishments are bilingual (English/Korean) and many accept US dollars as well as South Korean won. Before June 2013 Sinjang-dong Shopping Mall was known as a seedy collection of \\"Juicy\\" bars that catered exclusively to American military. It was filled with Filipina and, in smaller numbers, Russian and Korean \\"Juicy\\" girls who worked as hostesses or dancers in bars to provide company and, in some cases, sexual services to patrons in exchange for the patron buying the girl juice drinks priced 10,000 won and higher.http://www.stripes.com/news/juicy-bars-said-to-be-havens-for- prostitution-aimed-at-u-s- military-1.8019http://www.stripes.com/news/pacific/entertainment-district- outside-osan-ab-declared-off-limits-1.225653 Following a crack-down by United States Forces Korea (USFK) officials, those establishments that got out of the juicy bar business have remade themselves into dance clubs and sports bars. Some are thriving, but some have closed as the 140 bars in Songtan battle for the patronage of area servicemen. Those that chose to remain in the Juicy bar business have been placed off limits to military personnel.http://www.stripes.com/news/juicy-bars-air-force-puts-squeeze-on- businesses-linked-to-human- trafficking-1.238446http://www.stripes.com/news/special-reports/juicy-bars-in- south-korea/usfk-general-tells-troops-to-stay-away-from-unscrupulous- businesses-1.234230 The military authorities have no jurisdiction over the private businesses off base. However, they can order the service members under their jurisdiction to not do business with those who do not meet particular standards. Being put off limits can mean that a business loses nearly all of its customers, so many owners begrudgingly comply with the base's requirements. Many owners have complained that essentially this gives the US military de facto authority over the Korean businesses. Song's Plaques and Coins shop in the Sinjang Shopping Mall supplies a large portion of the challenge coins used throughout the US military.

Bryan is the 26th Triple Crown Champion and the 15th Grand Slam Champion in WWE history and headlined several major pay-per-view events, including WrestleMania XXX. Danielson was previously signed to WWE, then known as the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), for an 18-month period from 2000‚Äì2001, and made additional uncontracted appearances for the promotion until 2003. Prior to joining WWE for his third stint in 2009, Danielson wrestled for various companies internationally using both his real name and the ring name American Dragon, which later became his nickname. David Shoemaker of ESPN's Grantland noted that Danielson \\"was widely regarded as the best wrestler in the world before he got the call-up from WWE\\". He wrestled for Ring of Honor (ROH) from 2002 to 2009, being recognized as a \\"Founding Father\\" of the promotion, where he was a one-time ROH World Champion and one-time Pure Wrestling Champion, at some point unifying both titles. He was the first winner of ROH's annual Survival of the Fittest tournament in 2004. Danielson also wrestled extensively in Japan, winning the GHC Junior Heavyweight Championship in Pro Wrestling Noah and the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship (with Curry Man) in New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW). Between WWE, ROH and Japanese promotions, he held a dozen total championships. Danielson also won numerous titles on the independent circuit, including two PWG World Championships, the FIP Heavyweight Championship and the wXw World Heavyweight Championship. From May 2014 to December 2014 and from April 2015 to March 2018, Bryan was either injured or recovering from injury. In February 2016, Danielson retired from professional wrestling due to medical issues (including seizures) arising from multiple concussions and a brain lesion. That July, he became the SmackDown General Manager following the return of the brand extension. In March 2018, Bryan was formally cleared by doctors and returned to in-ring competition at WrestleMania 34. He regained the WWE Championship for the first time in four years later that November.  Early life  Bryan Lloyd Danielson was born on May 22, 1981, in Aberdeen, Washington, the son of a lumberjack and a therapist. His parents got divorced when he was young. During his childhood, Danielson was shown a professional wrestling magazine by a friend and since became a fan of wrestling. He considered himself antisocial in high school but competed in sports such as American football. Danielson has cited a number of wrestlers as influences to his style including Toshiaki Kawada, Mitsuharu Misawa, and William Regal. He has also made mention of modeling his wrestling on that of Dean Malenko and Chris Benoit in his early career, then using Brazilian jiu-jitsu as a platform to develop his own style.  Professional wrestling career = Early career (1999‚Äì2000)  During his sophomore year of high school, Danielson decided to pursue a pro wrestling career and attempted to train at Dean Malenko's wrestling school in Florida. However, by the time he graduated from school in 1999, Malenko's school had closed down. Following a friend's suggestion, he instead began training under Rudy Gonzalez and veteran wrestler Shawn Michaels at the Texas Wrestling Academy (TWA) in San Antonio, Texas. After his wrestling debut in December 1999, Danielson toured Japan with Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling (FMW) alongside Lance Cade, a fellow trainee from the TWA, and they competed in several tag team matches. He won the TWA Tag Team Championship with Spanky in March 2000, but they dropped the titles back to Jeremy Sage and Ruben Cruz two weeks later.  World Wrestling Federation (2000‚Äì2001) While touring the country's independent circuit, Danielson was signed to a developmental deal by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) to work in their developmental system and was assigned to Memphis Championship Wrestling (MCW), where he gained exposure and was trained by WWF competitor William Regal, whom he credited as being instrumental in the development of his career. During this time, he adopted his moniker of the \\"American Dragon\\". WWF severed its ties with MCW in 2001, but not before Danielson won the MCW Light Heavyweight Championship and the MCW Tag Team Championship with Spanky. After 18 months with the company, he was released from his WWF contract in July 2001. Danielson revealed in his 2015 autobiography that he was close to being called up to the main roster during the 2001 Royal Rumble match: he explained that the WWF thought of using him as one of their key figures in the newly created cruiserweight division, which was inspired by World Championship Wrestling (WCW).  Japan (2001‚Äì2004)  Danielson went to Japan after his release from the WWF, competing in Japan's premier promotion, New Japan Pro- Wrestling (NJPW), where he used his American Dragon persona and donned a red, white and blue mask reminiscent of a dragon. As a part of the junior heavyweight division, Danielson had success in both singles and tag team competition in the company, winning (without wearing a mask) the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship with Curry Man on March 12, 2004. WWE appearances (2002‚Äì2003) In 2002, Danielson wrestled two matches for the renamed World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) despite not being a contracted performer for the company. He was quickly defeated by both Sean O'Haire and Little Guido in his two appearances. He went on to make four additional non- contracted appearances for WWE in 2003 on its secondary shows, Velocity and Heat, initially as enhancement talent before being allowed to compete in longer matches; he wrestled Jamie Noble at a Velocity taping in January, Rico at a Heat taping in February, John Cena at a Velocity taping also in February, and made his final appearance in November in a tag team match against Paul London and Spanky at a Velocity taping, in which he was partnered with John Walters. This was his final appearance for the promotion for over five years.  Ring of Honor  Founding father (2002‚Äì2005) = Danielson posing in 2004 In 2002, Danielson joined the independent promotion Ring of Honor (ROH), where he is acknowledged as a \\"Founding Father\\" of the company. On February 22, he competed in the main event of the company's debut event, The Era of Honor Begins, in a three-way match against Christopher Daniels and Low Ki. One of his matches with Austin Aries, performed on August 7, 2004 at Testing the Limit, lasted seventy-four minutes before Aries was finally declared the victor. One of the more notable rivalries he had in the early years in the company was with Homicide, as the two fought numerous matches with a variety of stipulations, culminating in a steel cage match on May 13, 2005 at The Final Showdown, where Danielson was victorious. Despite winning the company's inaugural Survival of the Fittest tournament in 2004, Bryan did not win a ROH title. In 2005, Danielson explained in the company's newsletter, The ROH Newswire, that he had quit ROH after being frustrated by his inability to defeat Austin Aries for the ROH World Championship. It was later revealed Danielson had become frustrated in general with professional wrestling and planned to take some time off to evaluate his career options. However, Danielson had several dates booked in Europe and Japan, leading fans to believe that the periodical was likely a storyline claim for Danielson's absence during this period. = ROH World Champion (2005‚Äì2006) = Danielson defeated James Gibson for the ROH World Championship at Glory by Honor IV on September 15, 2005. The rest of the year saw Danielson have successful title defenses even against wrestlers from other companies, such as Pro Wrestling Noah star Naomichi Marufuji at Final Battle on December 17. At the beginning of 2006, Chris Hero, a representative from Combat Zone Wrestling (CZW), invaded ROH and targeted Danielson‚Äîthe two exchanged words over the internet before having a match together, with nearly the entire roster of both companies embarking on an interpromotional feud.Meltzer, Bill. \\"The ROH-CZW Philly Turf War.\\" Pro Wrestling Illustrated May 2006: 40‚Äì43. Danielson became personally invested in this feud and invaded CZW himself, which led to him having physical altercations with a number of CZW wrestlers. Hero intensified the rivalry, leading to the two wrestling at ROH's Hell Freezes Over event on January 14, where Danielson successfully defended the ROH World Championship. On July 15 at Death Before Dishonor IV, he soon filled the vacant slot on ROH's five-man team which participated in one of CZW's more popular attractions, a steel cage match called the Cage of Death, a ten-man tag team match in which a man from each team starts in the cage and a random wrestler enters periodically thereafter. During the match, Danielson turned on his team by assaulting his rival Samoa Joe before leaving the match and effectively abandoning his involvement in the animosity between the two promotions. As the interpromotional hostility with CZW heightened, Danielson also defended against challengers from the rival company, who had signed an open contract for any CZW wrestler willing to challenge for the ROH World Championship. Former champion Samoa Joe also challenged Danielson at Fight of the Century on August 5, but their match ended in a 60-minute draw. Danielson in the ring in 2006 While having the ROH World Championship, ROH faced the issue of having another title with seemingly equal value, the ROH Pure Championship. Danielson and the ROH Pure Champion Nigel McGuinness had a match to unify the titles. They met at April 29 in a match fought under pure wrestling rules and McGuinness left Danielson outside the ring after a chair shot to win by countout‚Äîthis was enough to retain the Pure title, but not to win Danielson's World Championship. They had another unification match in McGuinness's native England; ROH decided that there had to be a winner, with a title changing hands by countout and disqualification and a draw forcing a restart. Danielson won the match on August 12 and retired the Pure title as its last champion (the title would be reinstated in 2020).. During a match with Colt Cabana on August 26, Danielson suffered a real injury when he separated his shoulder, tearing two tendons in it and he tore another tendon in his chest. Danielson returned at Glory by Honor V: Night 2 on September 16 and was challenged by Kenta, a guest competitor from NOAH, due to the two company's talent exchange agreement‚ÄîDanielson again retained his championship. At Final Battle on December 23, Danielson's fifteen-month title reign finally ended after he lost to Homicide at his 39th defense and he subsequently took time off from wrestling in order to heal his shoulder. = Final feuds and departure (2007‚Äì2009) = On May 11, 2007, Danielson returned to ROH at Reborn Again and defeated Shane Hagadorn and Adam Pearce in separate matches. On May 12, ROH filmed its first pay-per-view, Respect is Earned, which had Danielson team with ROH World Champion Takeshi Morishima against Nigel McGuinness and Kenta. Danielson's team won after Danielson made Kenta tap out to his signature submission hold, the Cattle Mutilation. Danielson vied to contend for the ROH World Championship by defeating McGuinness at Domination on June 9, which appeared on the company's next pay per view named Driven which took place on June 23, but was aired on September 21. This allowed him, now as a fan favorite, to challenge Morishima for the title at Manhattan Mayhem II on August 25 in a losing effort in which he also suffered a legitimate detached retina. Following surgery, he fought Morishima again in a match at Man Up on September 15, but the referee stopped the match since Danielson was unable to respond to him. In a rematch at Rising Above on December 29, Morishima was disqualified. Morishima returned to the company at Final Battle on December 27, 2008 in a match billed as a \\"Fight Without Honor\\" in which both men were allowed weapons and which Danielson won. Danielson commented in March 2012 on how he felt validated at Final Battle 2008, because he and Morishima managed to get 2,500 people to see the show in New York City. As part of ROH's agreement with Pro Wrestling Noah, the company held a show in Japan named Tokyo Summit on September 14, where Danielson wrestled GHC Junior Heavyweight Champion Yoshinobu Kanemaru and won the championship. Following his victory, NOAH allowed him to defend the title in Ring of Honor, with his first defense being at Glory By Honor VII on September 20, defeating Katsuhiko Nakajima. However, this was his only successful defense as he returned to Japan on October 13 to lose the title to Kenta. Following his loss, Danielson challenged McGuinness for the ROH World Championship at the next ROH pay-per- view Rising Above on November 22, in a losing effort. Ring of Honor made its national television debut with the program Ring of Honor Wrestling and Danielson made his television debut in the main event of its third episode on February 28, 2009 by defeating Austin Aries. In the fall of 2009, Danielson signed with WWE after a farewell tour with ROH, during which he challenged Aries for the title again and lost. On September 26 at Glory by Honor VIII: The Final Countdown, he won his last match in the company against McGuinness, who was also having his final match with the company.

In 2003, Danielson also toured the United Kingdom for British promotion, All Star Wrestling (ASW). While he was in the United Kingdom, Danielson won the World Heavy Middleweight Championship on May 6 in an eight-man one-night tournament in Croydon defeating James Mason.

On September 4 at Guerre Sans Fronti√®res during his last night in PWG, Danielson defeated Chris Hero to win the PWG World Championship for the second time and immediately vacated it afterward. Following his return from his injury in 2007, the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) published a video of Danielson stating his intent to challenge for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, as the establishment that sanctioned the title at the time, Total Nonstop Action Wrestling, was relinquishing the title back to the NWA. A tournament, titled Reclaiming the Glory, was held to determine the new champion with Danielson making his way to finals, scheduled to compete Brent Albright on September 1, but due to the eye injury he sustained at ROH's Manhattan Mayhem event, he withdrew from the tournament and instead acted as the referee of the match.

In 2009, Danielson also signed a short-term contract with German wrestling promotion Westside Xtreme Wrestling (wXw). Shortly after his debut, Danielson won the wXw World Heavyweight Championship against Bad Bones and held it over a month before losing it to Absolute Andy.

His name was given by William Regal. Bryan made his debut on the inaugural episode of NXT on February 23, losing by submission to then World Heavyweight Champion Chris Jericho and being attacked by his storyline mentor The Miz for disrespecting him earlier in the show. Over the next several weeks, Bryan failed to win a single match, but despite a record of 0‚Äì5 he was ranked first in the inaugural Pros' Poll on the March 30 episode of NXT. After losing five more matches on NXT, Bryan got his first victory on the May 10 episode of Raw by pinning Santino Marella in an eight-on-four handicap match. The following night on NXT, he was eliminated from the show along with Michael Tarver as neither man had confidence in themselves to win the competition. Despite his elimination, he appeared on the following episodes of NXT, being interviewed by Matt Striker and attacking both Michael Cole and The Miz. On the May 31 episode of Raw, Bryan was granted a match against The Miz by guest host Ashton Kutcher, which he won and threw Miz into Cole at ringside after the match. On the June 7 episode of Raw, the faction known as The Nexus (NXT rookies from season one) invaded the WWE ring, attacking John Cena and causing destruction around the ringside area. On June 11, Danielson was fired from WWE for being too violent, strangling ring announcer Justin Roberts with his own neck tie. Danielson noted that WWE apologized to him for his release, explaining that they \\"had sponsors they had to deal with\\".

Return to the independent circuit (2010)  After being released, Danielson received several offers to sign with other wrestling companies, being contacted by TNA, albeit indirectly and some Japanese promotions. Two weeks after his departure from WWE, Danielson made his return to the independent circuit on June 26, defeating Eddie Kingston at the CHIKARA event We Must Eat Michigan's Brain in Taylor, Michigan.

On the July 22 episode of SmackDown, Bryan declared he would cash in his Money in the Bank briefcase at the following year's WrestleMania. After several months of losing matches, Bryan began a feud with then World Heavyweight Champion Mark Henry on the November 4 episode of SmackDown after Henry challenged Bryan to a non- title match to prove that Bryan could not become champion. During the match, Big Show knocked out Henry, making Bryan lose by disqualification. As his friend, Big Show then urged a groggy Bryan to cash in his championship match, but Henry recovered and attacked both Bryan and Big Show before the match could start. Bryan suffered attacks from Henry the following two weeks. On the November 25 episode of SmackDown, Henry was knocked out again by Big Show, at which point Bryan cashed in his briefcase for a title match and quickly pinned Henry, but SmackDown General Manager Theodore Long revealed that Henry was not medically cleared to compete and voided the match, so Henry remained champion and the briefcase was returned to Bryan. Bryan later admitted he betrayed his principles by not waiting for WrestleMania, but explained he felt strongly about exacting revenge on Henry and realized he may not make it to WrestleMania due to Henry's continued attacks. Regardless of his briefcase, Bryan won a fatal four-way match on the same episode of SmackDown to become the contender for Henry's championship. On the live November 29 episode of SmackDown, Henry managed to pin Bryan to retain the title in a steel cage match. Also in November, Bryan started being involved in a romantic storyline with AJ.

In the following weeks, tension was teased between Bryan and Big Show, with Big Show unhappy about Bryan taking the World Heavyweight Championship from him and Bryan being displeased about Big Show's lack of appreciation for Bryan's help in matches against Henry. As World Heavyweight Champion, Bryan turned into a villain as he gradually showed signs of overconfidence and arrogance, with Bryan beginning to partake in excessive victory celebrations, even when he won his matches by disqualification or countout. Despite AJ's declaration of love for him, Bryan avoided saying that he loved her in return. The kiss with AJ that cost Bryan his World Heavyweight Championship to Sheamus at WrestleMania XXVIII in 18 seconds In January 2012, Bryan successfully defended his title three times: the first occasion against Big Show when Bryan goaded Mark Henry into attacking him and causing a disqualification; the second occasion a no disqualification rematch with Big Show which ended abruptly after Big Show accidentally ran into AJ, hospitalizing her within the storyline for which Bryan blamed him; and the third occasion against Henry in a lumberjack match when Bryan provoked the lumberjacks to interfere and cause a no contest. This culminated in a triple threat steel cage match to exclude outside interference at the Royal Rumble on January 29, where Bryan escaped the cage after freeing himself from Big Show's grasp to retain the championship. At Elimination Chamber on February 19, Bryan defeated Big Show, Cody Rhodes, The Great Khali, Santino Marella and Wade Barrett in an Elimination Chamber match to retain the World Heavyweight Championship. After the match, Royal Rumble match winner Sheamus attacked Bryan and chose him as his WrestleMania opponent for the World Heavyweight Championship. In March, Bryan began to mistreat AJ, publicly demanding her to shut up and claiming that she always got in his way. Despite these actions, AJ continued to stand by Bryan. Bryan's reign as world champion ended at 105 days when Sheamus defeated him in 18 seconds at WrestleMania XXVIII due to Bryan being distracted with receiving a good luck kiss from AJ. On the following episode of SmackDown, Bryan blamed AJ for his world title loss and ended their relationship. Despite AJ's attempts to mend their relationship, Bryan cruelly rebuffed her multiple times, leaving AJ an emotional wreck. At Extreme Rules on April 29, Bryan failed to regain the World Heavyweight Championship from Sheamus in a two-out-of-three falls match, losing two falls to one. = Team Hell No (2012‚Äì2013) = Bryan feuded with CM Punk for the WWE Championship in 2012 after losing the World Heavyweight Championship The next night on Raw, Bryan became the number one contender to CM Punk's WWE Championship when he won a Beat the Clock challenge by defeating Jerry Lawler in under three minutes. Bryan received his title shot at Over the Limit on May 20 and suffered a controversial loss‚Äîwhen Bryan rolled back onto his shoulders as he applied the \\"Yes!\\" Lock, Punk tapped out immediately after the referee counted a pinfall win for Punk. Shortly before Over the Limit, Bryan interfered in a match between Punk and Kane to frame Punk attacking Kane with a steel chair, leading to a three-way feud. During this time, a jilted AJ turned her affections to both Punk and Kane. On the June 1 episode of SmackDown, Bryan's interference caused WWE Championship match between Punk and Kane to end in a double disqualification, resulting in a triple threat match being set up on June 17 at No Way Out, where Punk managed to retain the title after AJ distracted Kane. On the June 25 episode of Raw, Bryan defeated Punk and Kane in a non-title three-way elimination match to earn another shot at the WWE Championship. At Money in the Bank on July 15, Bryan failed to capture the WWE Championship again from Punk in a no disqualification match with AJ as special guest referee. The following night on Raw, AJ accepted Bryan's marriage proposal, On Raw 1000, Bryan's storyline wedding ended in failure when AJ left Bryan at the altar and instead accepted Mr. McMahon's offer of the position of permanent Raw General Manager. Bryan's night turned from bad to worse as he was later attacked by The Rock and insulted by celebrity Charlie Sheen. Kane offers to \\"hug it out\\" with Bryan AJ's rejection of Bryan turned him into an angry and bitter individual and resulted in Bryan lashing out at audiences. AJ continued to exact her revenge on Bryan by denying him a WWE Championship shot and instead forcing him to face Kane on August 19 at SummerSlam, where Bryan emerged victorious. As a result of Bryan and Kane's issues, AJ enrolled them in anger management classes hosted by Dr. Shelby and they were later forced to \\"hug it out\\". At the arrangement of Dr. Shelby and AJ, the two adversaries formed a team whose constant bickering and infighting even during matches inadvertently resulted in them defeating The Prime Time Players (Titus O'Neil and Darren Young) to become the number one contenders to the WWE Tag Team Championship on the September 10 episode of Raw and then defeating champions Kofi Kingston and R-Truth to win the championship on September 16 at Night of Champions. Bryan and Kane made their first successful title defense the following night on Raw, defeating the former champions in a rematch. The following week on Raw, \\"Team Hell No\\" was chosen as the official team name via a Twitter poll while Team Rhodes Scholars (Cody Rhodes and Damien Sandow) started a feud with Bryan and Kane, turning Bryan into a fan favorite once again. On October 28 at Hell in a Cell, Team Hell No lost to the Rhodes Scholars via disqualification, but retained their title. This was followed by a rematch on the November 14 Main Event, where Team Hell No defeated the Rhodes Scholars to retain the WWE Tag Team Championship. On the November 26 episode of Raw, after Kane lost to WWE Champion CM Punk in a non- title match, he was assaulted by The Shield (Dean Ambrose, Roman Reigns and Seth Rollins) and Bryan and Ryback, who both attempted to save Kane, suffered a similar fate. This attack had the effect of uniting Bryan and Kane and after The Shield and Team Hell No, along with Ryback, attacked each other on the December 3 episode of Raw, all six men were decreed to face each other in a Tables, Ladders and Chairs match on December 16 at TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs, where The Shield was victorious after pinning Bryan. Team Hell No went on to defend the tag team titles through the end of the year, retaining against Team Rhodes Scholars on the following Main Event and against 3MB (Drew McIntyre and Heath Slater) on the December 31 episode of Raw. Bryan ended 2012 having wrestled the second most televised and pay-per-view matches that year with 90. On January 27 at the 2013 Royal Rumble, Team Hell No retained the WWE Tag Team Championship against Team Rhodes Scholars. During the Royal Rumble match, Bryan eliminated Kane and was in turn thrown out of the ring by Antonio Cesaro‚ÄîKane caught Bryan before he touched the floor and despite Bryan's begging dropped him to complete his elimination. On the February 4 episode of Raw, Bryan was inserted into the World Heavyweight Championship number one contender Elimination Chamber match when he defeated Rey Mysterio, after which the returning Mark Henry attacked both men. On February 17 at Elimination Chamber, Bryan was the first man eliminated from the match, courtesy of Henry. On April 7 at WrestleMania 29, Team Hell No defeated Dolph Ziggler and Big E Langston for another successful title defense. Team Hell No rekindled their rivalry with The Shield the following night on Raw after saving The Undertaker from an ambush by them. On the April 22 episode of Raw, Team Hell No and The Undertaker were defeated by The Shield in a six-man tag team match. The Shield went on to take out Undertaker and rack up wins over Bryan and Kane in both singles and tag matches that also included WWE Champion John Cena. On May 19 at Extreme Rules, Bryan and Kane lost the WWE Tag Team Championship to Shield members Seth Rollins and Roman Reigns, ending their reign at 245 days. = Yes Movement (2013‚Äì2014) = Bryan in July 2013 As he being pinned led to the loss of the tag team titles, Bryan became obsessed about proving that he was not the weak link of Team Hell No and as a result became even more aggressive, but his overzealous behavior led to Team Hell No losing their rematch against Rollins and Reigns on the May 27 episode of Raw. When Kane tried to reassure Bryan, he replied with harsh rebukes that alienated Kane from him and as a result Bryan was paired with Randy Orton despite their poor relationship to face a common enemy in The Shield. During this storyline, Bryan was praised as the best performer in WWE and having an unmatched connection with crowds by critics, peers and veterans of the professional wrestling industry. On the June 14 episode of SmackDown, Bryan (with Kane and Orton as his tag team partners) ended The Shield's unpinned and unsubmitted streak in a televised six-man tag match by forcing Rollins to submit. On June 16 at Payback, Bryan and Orton's poor teamwork resulted in an unsuccessful challenge for Rollins and Reigns' WWE Tag Team Championship. The following night on Raw, while the status of Team Hell No was left up in the air after both members considered individual pursuits, Bryan and Orton faced off in a no disqualification match that Orton won via referee stoppage after Bryan suffered a legit nerve injury, which was a stinger resulting in Bryan being unable to feel both his arms for the rest of the match. On the June 21 episode of SmackDown, Bryan defeated Orton, but to Bryan's dismay it was via countout. On the following Raw, Bryan decisively defeated Orton via submission in a street fight and later continued his hot streak by picking up wins over Sheamus and Christian. On July 14 at Money in the Bank, Bryan competed in the WWE Championship Money in the Bank ladder match, during which Bryan was attacked by Curtis Axel, a non- participant, which ultimately prevented him from winning the match that was won by Orton. On the July 15 episode of Raw, WWE Champion John Cena picked Bryan to be his opponent for the WWE title match at SummerSlam. This led to Bryan being embroiled (in storyline) in the McMahon family's internal feud, with WWE chairman Vince McMahon against Bryan due to Bryan's image not fitting of McMahon's vision of a typical WWE wrestler, while WWE chief operating officer Triple H was in support of Bryan. On the July 22 episode of Raw, Bryan ran a gauntlet match to prove his worth as number one contender, defeating Jack Swagger and Antonio Cesaro in succession while his third opponent Ryback was disqualified after performing a powerbomb on Bryan through a table. The following week on Raw, Bryan was forced to face Kane and emerged victorious, but Kane attacked him after the match. On August 18 at SummerSlam, Bryan defeated Cena to win his first WWE Championship, but after the match special referee Triple H performed his Pedigree finishing move on Bryan, leading to Randy Orton cashing in his Money in the Bank contract to win the title from Bryan. The next night on Raw, Triple H and the McMahons endorsed Orton as \\"the face of the WWE\\" while labeling Bryan a \\"B+ player\\" and forming The Authority faction, claiming that the company was looking for Orton as champion instead of Bryan, who also assumed the top babyface role (heroic character) in WWE with Cena being out injured. With Triple H threatening to fire anyone who disobeyed him, Bryan was left alone to take on and suffer attacks from Orton and The Shield. On September 15 at Night of Champions, Bryan defeated Orton to regain the WWE Championship, but he was stripped of the title the following night on Raw by Triple H after referee Scott Armstrong said he had made a fast count the previous night resulting in Bryan's win while Bryan denied that Armstrong was working for him. Armstrong was then kayfabe fired by The Authority while Bryan and Orton faced off again for the vacant title on October 6 at Battleground in a match that ended in a no contest after Big Show interfered and knocked out both men. Bryan once again challenged Orton for the vacant championship on October 27 at Hell in a Cell, but was unsuccessful after the special guest referee Shawn Michaels hit Bryan with a superkick for attacking his best friend Triple H. The following night on Raw, Bryan confronted Michaels, who offered a handshake, but Bryan put Michaels in the \\"Yes!\\" Lock. Later that same night, Bryan was attacked by The Wyatt Family. Bryan then found an ally in former rival CM Punk, as the duo defeated Luke Harper and Erick Rowan of The Wyatt Family on November 24 at Survivor Series, However, the entire Wyatt Family defeated Bryan in a handicap match on December 15 at TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs, with Wyatt attempting to recruit Bryan in the previous weeks. On the final Raw of 2013, Bryan defeated Harper and then Rowan in a gauntlet match so that he could face Wyatt, whereupon Harper and Rowan interfered for a disqualification and beat him down. Bryan then acknowledged that no matter how many times the fans chanted \\"Yes!\\" or supported him, it was not enough for \\"the machine\\", so he gave up and decided to join The Wyatt Family. On the January 13 episode of Raw, after Wyatt and Bryan lost to The Usos in a tag team steel cage match, Wyatt was attempting to \\"punish\\" Bryan for their lack of success since he joined the group, but Bryan attacked him and the rest of The Wyatt Family. Afterwards Bryan discarded the blue overalls he had been wearing as a member of The Wyatt Family, scaled the cage and led the live audience in a \\"Yes!\\" chant. At the 2014 Royal Rumble on January 26, despite Bryan losing to Wyatt in a singles match and later not participating in the Royal Rumble match, the audience continued to chant for Bryan during the Royal Rumble match and the WWE World Heavyweight Championship match between Cena and Orton. Bryan closed WrestleMania XXX by celebrating his win of the WWE World Heavyweight Championship On the January 27 episode of Raw, Bryan qualified for the Elimination Chamber match for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship at the eponymous pay-per-view by teaming up with John Cena and Sheamus to defeat The Shield via disqualification. Meanwhile, he also continued his feud with The Authority as Kane attacked him on multiple occasions, attempting to injure Bryan before his Elimination Chamber match on February 23, in which Bryan survived until he was one of the final two participants, but defending champion Randy Orton retained after Kane interfered in the match by attacking Bryan. On the March 10 episode of Raw, Bryan and multiple fans occupied the ring (while WWE road crew members dressed in Bryan T-shirts posed as fans outside the ring) and refused to leave, resulting in an irate Triple H agreeing to Bryan's demand for a match at WrestleMania XXX, with the stipulation that the winner would be inserted into the WWE World Heavyweight Championship match at the event. At the event on April 6, Bryan defeated Triple H and was inserted into the title match, but Triple H attacked Bryan after their match. Despite a storyline injury and interference from The Authority and a crooked referee, Bryan prevailed over Batista and champion Randy Orton in the WrestleMania main event to win the WWE World Heavyweight Championship. Pro Wrestling Torch editor Wade Keller analyzed (and Danielson later confirmed in his memoir) that Bryan's WrestleMania journey was due to several factors: the fans' rejection of Batista and continual support of Bryan over the previous six months (even when he joined The Wyatt Family) as well as CM Punk legitimately walking out on WWE after the Royal Rumble. Both Bryan and Chris Jericho later said that Bryan's original WrestleMania XXX opponent was supposed to be Sheamus. The Pro Wrestling Torch Newsletter wrote: \\"Leading into WrestleMania 30, the Daniel Bryan vs. Triple H program was the top draw of Raw each week. Coming out of WM30, Bryan as new WWE World Hvt. champion has been solidified as a ratings draw\\". This trend continued until at least May 2014, when Bryan had to undergo neck surgery due his first of the two major injuries that would eventually force him to retire in February 2016. On the Raw following WrestleMania XXX, Triple H used his authority to grant himself a title match against Bryan, who was then attacked by Orton, Batista and Kane just before the match which ended in a no contest and Bryan's retention when The Shield interfered to chase away Bryan's adversaries. Stephanie McMahon enticed Kane to return to his masked self which Kane complied and was granted a future title match against Bryan and proceeded to carry out a brutal attack against Bryan which led to a scripted injury to give him time off to mourn his recently deceased father. At Extreme Rules on May 4, Bryan defeated Kane in an Extreme Rules match to retain his title. = Major injuries and first retirement (2014‚Äì2016) = WWE World Heavyweight Champion in April 2014 At some point in time, Bryan lost all strength in his right arm and required neck surgery. On the May 12 episode of Raw, he was attacked by Kane and stretchered away that same night to justify his absence. On May 15, Bryan underwent successful neck surgery, with a cervical foraminotomy to decompress the nerve root having been performed. Two weeks later on Raw, when Bryan refused to relinquish his title Stephanie McMahon threatened to fire Bryan's wife Brie Bella, if Bryan did not give up his title on June 1 at Payback. The ultimatum resulted in Bella \\"quitting\\" WWE so that Bryan did not have to give up his title. However, when it was revealed that Bryan would not be able to compete at Money in the Bank and defend his title, The Authority stripped him of the WWE World Heavyweight Championship on the June 9 episode of Raw, ending Bryan's third reign at 64 days. Due to his injury, Bryan was largely off WWE TV during this period. Months after the neck surgery, Bryan's strength still had not returned to his arm. Many doctors felt a second surgery was needed, while others told Bryan he would not be able to return to wrestling. Bryan contemplated further elbow surgery, but instead went to Denver to undergo the Muscle Activation Techniques program, which successfully returned the strength to his right arm. To prepare for his in-ring return, he trained in kickboxing and jujitsu. On the November 24 episode of Raw, Bryan returned to WWE, taunting the recently deposed Authority. As guest general manager for that episode of Raw and the November 28 episode of SmackDown, Bryan arranged punishments for those allied with The Authority. Apart from scheduling a chairs match between Kane and Ryback for TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs on December 14, Bryan also affirmed that he would return soon. Bryan told WWE management that he wished to be the \\"face of SmackDown\\" to increase the show's viewership. Bryan returned to the ring on the January 15, 2015 episode of SmackDown, with his opponent Kane being disqualified due to The Authority's interference and later that night Bryan won the six-man tag team main event. The next week on SmackDown, despite more interference by The Authority, Bryan defeated Kane in a no disqualification main event to keep his Royal Rumble match spot. Bryan entered the 2015 Royal Rumble match at number 10, managing one elimination before being eliminated by Bray Wyatt in the first half of the match, causing the Philadelphia crowd to repeatedly chant for him during the second half of the match while booing other wrestlers entering the match, including eventual winner and fellow \\"good guy\\" Roman Reigns. On the January 29 episode of SmackDown, Bryan ended his feud with Kane by defeating him in a casket match. On the February 2 episode of Raw, Bryan defeated Seth Rollins, earning the right to face Roman Reigns at Fastlane, as the winner of the Fastlane match would challenge Brock Lesnar at WrestleMania 31 for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship. At Fastlane on February 22, Bryan lost to Reigns, failing to make his entry to WrestleMania main event. After Fastlane, Bryan set his sights on the Intercontinental Championship for WrestleMania 31, where he was one of multiple wrestlers who came to possess champion Bad News Barrett's title belt while defeating Barrett in non-title matches. On the March 12 episode of SmackDown, Bryan declared his entry into the multi-man ladder match for the Intercontinental title at WrestleMania 31. After Bryan was pinned twice within a week by fellow ladder match entrant Dolph Ziggler, the Pro Wrestling Torch Newsletter reported that \\"WWE has made it clear where Bryan stands after starting to lose regularly now\\". WWE's storylines for Bryan since his return were widely criticized. Dave Scherer of Pro Wrestling Insider questioned \\"bringing Bryan back for the Rumble in the first place\\" if there was no intention of letting Bryan win. Benjamin Tucker of Pro Wrestling Torch criticized WWE for having \\"watered down\\" Bryan's heroic character to a \\"sneaky, backstabbing, cheap, aggravating jerk\\" for the feud against Roman Reigns. Mike Tedesco of WrestleView wrote in March that WWE \\"killed Daniel Bryan and Randy Orton dead in the last two months. It takes a special bunch of nincompoops to pull that off\\". Jake Barnett of Pro Wrestling Dot Net said that Bryan being labeled a \\"turd\\" was \\"asking fans to disbelieve what they see with their own eyes\\" and \\"will do nothing to calm down the conspiracy theorists who insist WWE is intentionally cooling off Bryan to make Reigns look better in comparison\\". In a piece for the Wrestling Observer, Zach Dominello was \\"dumbfounded and disheartened\\" that \\"after returning from a very serious injury, WWE's bright idea is to put Bryan in one of the most dangerous matches possible at WrestleMania\\", while having \\"dragged Bryan down to the levels of R-Truth and Stardust\\". Intercontinental Championship at WrestleMania 31 Bryan won the Intercontinental Championship ladder match at WrestleMania 31 on March 29. This made him one of six wrestlers at the time to achieve WWE's new Grand Slam due to winning every active title in WWE (except for female- exclusive titles), while also making him WWE's 26th Triple Crown Champion having won the WWE, World Heavyweight, Tag Team, United States and Intercontinental Championships. The next night on Raw, Bryan defeated Dolph Ziggler in his first successful title defense, before they were attacked by Barrett only for Sheamus to return and chase off Barrett before attacking Bryan and Ziggler. Bryan lost to Sheamus on the April 2 SmackDown by countout when Barrett interfered. During the match, Bryan split his forehead open on the broadcast table, causing him to bleed and later requiring stitches for the wound. On the April 16 episode of SmackDown, in his last in-ring match for nearly three years, Bryan teamed up with United States Champion John Cena to defeat WWE Tag Team Champions Cesaro and Tyson Kidd by submission. Following the April 16 episode of SmackDown, WWE pulled Bryan from wrestling on the remainder of WWE's touring of Europe as a \\"precautionary measure\\". Bryan's scheduled title defense at Extreme Rules on April 26 against Bad News Barrett was later canceled as Bryan was \\"medically unable to compete\\". Less than a week later, WWE stopped advertising Bryan from all future live events or television tapings. After about a month off television, Bryan returned on the May 11 episode of Raw to explain that after having undergone an MRI he would be out for an unknown period of time and could possibly have to retire (though the nature of his injuries were not revealed), therefore he relinquished the Intercontinental Championship. On the Elimination Chamber pre-show on May 31, Bryan stated that he would eventually wrestle again. In July, Bryan revealed that his injury was concussion-related and claimed that he had been cleared to return to the ring by external medical professionals and was waiting for WWE to clear him. During his time away, he trimmed his signature beard and cut his hair short, donating his hair to Wigs 4 Kids, a charity similar to that of Locks of Love. On February 8, 2016, Bryan retired due to medical reasons. Later on that day's episode of Raw, broadcast from Bryan's home state of Washington, Bryan gave a retirement speech expressing his gratefulness for the happiness wrestling had brought him. The following day on ESPN, Bryan revealed that he suffered ten documented concussions while wrestling, but more might have been undocumented or misdiagnosed. He said a recent EEG reflex test revealed slowing and a small subacute or chronic lesion in his brain's temporoparietal region, which explained Bryan's post-concussion seizures and led to his retirement decision. Bryan had been cleared by a doctor for the Arizona Cardinals and passed a concussion test at UCLA with \\"flying colors\\", but WWE's head of medical Joseph Maroon refused to clear him. Journalist Dave Meltzer suggested that this may have been because of Maroon having been portrayed in a negative light in the film Concussion. Initially, Bryan requested his release from WWE and was looking to return to NJPW and ROH as well as work in Mexico for Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL), but the request was turned down by Vince McMahon. Bryan underwent a new test, where the lesion in his brain was discovered, after which he himself made the decision to retire. On Thank You Daniel, a WWE Network tribute to Bryan, he confirmed that he had been asked about working for WWE in a different capacity while comparing this to \\"a partner breaking up with you, getting married to someone else and then asking you to be best friends\\", expanding to say that he needed time to heal emotionally before he could agree to such an offer. During this period, WWE confirmed that Bryan would continue to appear for the company in a non in-ring role alongside his wife Brie Bella, who served as a WWE Ambassador following her retirement from in-ring competition on April 3 at WrestleMania 32.. Recognized as a WWE Legend, Bryan co-hosted the WWE Network tournament Cruiserweight Classic alongside SmackDown commentator Mauro Ranallo in mid-2016. = SmackDown General Manager (2016‚Äì2018) = With the inception of WWE's second brand split, Bryan was appointed by SmackDown General Manager on the July 18 episode of Raw. Along with SmackDown commissioner Shane McMahon, Bryan played a vital role in the WWE draft. After SummerSlam on August 21, Bryan unveiled two new championships exclusive to the SmackDown brand: the SmackDown Women's Championship and the SmackDown Tag Team Championship. As part of his General Manager duties, Bryan co-hosted Talking Smack with Renee Young, a post-show interview segment on the WWE Network. The segment frequently became the site for heated altercations between Bryan and The Miz; Bryan openly expressed his disdain while Miz complained about being mistreated. The two continued to feud for the rest of the year, with Miz often running away from Bryan when a physical altercation was teased. These altercations were intertwined with Miz feuding over the Intercontinental championship with Dolph Ziggler. Following another verbal clash on Miz TV at the November 1 episode of SmackDown, Bryan decided to trade Miz to Raw if he failed to regain the championship from Ziggler. Miz defeated Ziggler on the 900th episode of SmackDown Live on November 15 to become a six-time Intercontinental Champion. On the October 11 episode of SmackDown, Bryan and Shane challenged the Raw brand to three 5-on-5 traditional Survivor Series elimination tag team matches at the event of the same name as a means to determine which brand was superior. On the October 17 episode of Raw, Raw Commissioner Stephanie McMahon and Raw General Manager Mick Foley accepted Bryan's challenge. On the April 10 and 11, 2017 episodes of Raw and SmackDown, Bryan was involved in the 2017 Superstar Shake-up in which brand's former champions Alexa Bliss, Bray Wyatt, Dean Ambrose, The Miz, Heath Slater and Rhyno were traded to Raw. Bryan later took time off from WWE television for paternity leave and returned on the June 20 episode, during which he stripped Carmella of her Money In The Bank briefcase and suspended James Ellsworth due to his interference in the match. On the August 1 episode of SmackDown, Bryan appointed Shane McMahon as a guest referee for United States Champion AJ Styles's title defense against Kevin Owens at SummerSlam, thereby triggering a long-term feud between Owens and Shane that would ultimately also involve Bryan himself. Bryan was again absent from television after being attacked by Kane on the October 30 episode of Raw. He returned on the November 14 episode of SmackDown. After Survivor Series Bryan became deeply involved in Shane McMahon's feud against Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn, favoring the latter two. On the November 21 episode of Smackdown Shane was about to fire the two for attacking him during their Survivor Series interbrand elimination match against Team Raw, which SmackDown ultimately lost. To settle the dispute whether Owens and Zayn should be fired, the two were scheduled to wrestle Randy Orton and Shinsuke Nakamura at Clash of Champions with Owens's and Zayn's jobs on the line. During the match Shane and Bryan acted as guest referees and come to blows: after Shane intentionally stopped a count at two during a pinfall attempt by Zayn, while Bryan made a fast count to give Owens and Zayn the win. Over the following weeks, Bryan kept on favoring Owens and Zayn by giving them multiple opportunities at AJ Styles's WWE Championship, first in a handicap title match at the Royal Rumble and then by including Owens and Zayn among the five challengers at Fastlane. During the latter match, Shane broke up pinfall attempts by Owens and Zayn, resulting in a brutal attack by Owens and Zayn on the following SmackDown. = In-ring return and \\"The New\\" Daniel Bryan (2018‚Äì2019) = Bryan returned to in-ring competition at WrestleMania 34 At that time, after more than two years of evaluations, reviews of his medical history and neurological and physical evaluations, Bryan was cleared by three external independent neurosurgeons, neurologists and concussion experts ‚Äî in addition to Joseph Maroon ‚Äî to return to WWE in-ring competition on March 20. On that day's SmackDown Live, Bryan thanked fans for their constant support and vowed to wrestle again. In his role as General Manager, he (kayfabe) fired Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn for attacking Shane McMahon the week before, resulting in Owens and Zayn attacking Bryan. In response, Bryan expressed regret over favoring them and scheduled a tag team match at WrestleMania 34 pitting himself and Shane against Owens and Zayn, with the latter being rehired if they win. At the event on April 8, Bryan and McMahon won after Bryan made Zayn submit in his first match since April 2015. As a result of being medically cleared, Bryan resigned as general manager. Bryan participated in the 50-man Royal Rumble match at the Greatest Royal Rumble event as the first entrant, lasting for 76 minutes‚Äîthe record for longest time in a Royal Rumble match‚Äîbefore being eliminated by Big Cass in the final three. Bryan defeated Cass at Backlash on May 6 and Money in the Bank on June 17. On the June 26 episode of SmackDown Live, Bryan was aided by Kane in a post-match attack from The Bludgeon Brothers, thus reuniting Team Hell No. At Extreme Rules, Team Hell No lost to The Bludgeon Brothers, after Kane was attacked pre-match with Bryan having to compete in a handicap match. After months of goading and later avoiding Bryan‚Äîas well as getting involved in Team Hell No's feud with The Bludgeon Brothers‚ÄîBryan competed against long- time rival The Miz at SummerSlam, but lost due to an undetected use of brass knuckles. Following SummerSlam, Miz mocked Bryan by delivering a fake retirement speech and Bryan's wife Brie Bella returned as his partner. At Hell in a Cell on September 16, Bryan and Bella lost to Miz and Maryse after Maryse pinned Bella. At Super Show-Down on October 6, Bryan defeated Miz to earn a WWE Championship opportunity against AJ Styles at Crown Jewel on November 2. However, in wake of the Khashoggi death incident he refused to work the Crown Jewel event in Saudi Arabia and the storyline was altered so that their match took place on the October 30 episode of SmackDown Live, which Bryan lost. On the November 6 episode of SmackDown Live, Bryan was named team captain of SmackDown at Survivor Series on November 18, but later had to share this role with The Miz. WWE Champion in January 2019 On the November 13 episode of SmackDown Live, Bryan defeated AJ Styles to win the WWE Championship for the fourth time following a low blow. After the match, he attacked Styles, turning heel for the first time since 2012. As a result of his title win, Bryan was removed from Team SmackDown at Survivor Series with Jeff Hardy taking his place on the team. Instead, he faced WWE Universal Champion Brock Lesnar in an interbrand champion vs. champion match, which he lost. Two days later on SmackDown Live, Bryan explained his actions, stating that he was following his dreams and that the fans were not with him during his recovery to return to the ring. He then christened himself as \\"The New\\" Daniel Bryan, and a rematch between Bryan and Styles for the title was scheduled for TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs, where he successfully defended the title. At the Royal Rumble on January 27, 2019, Bryan successfully retained his title against Styles once again, this time following interference from the returning Rowan. On the January 29 episode of SmackDown Live, Bryan threw the standard title belt in a garbage can (bemoaning the fact it was made from leather) and introduced a new belt, made from \\"entirely sustainable materials\\". Bryan was then scheduled to defend his championship in an Elimination Chamber at the Elimination Chamber event on February 17, where he successfully retained the title by last eliminating Kofi Kingston. At Fastlane, Bryan was originally scheduled to defend his championship against Kingston, but after Mr. McMahon replaced Kingston, Bryan successfully retained the title in a triple-threat match against Kevin Owens and Mustafa Ali. Bryan eventually defended the championship against Kingston at WrestleMania 35, where Bryan lost, ending his fifth world championship reign at 145 days. After WrestleMania, Bryan was briefly sidelined by an undisclosed injury, but was cleared to return to action on April 30. On May 6, Bryan competed on his first match on Raw since March 2015, where he lost to Kingston in a WrestleMania rematch, ending their feud.

Reigns suspected Rowan as his attacker due to seemingly incriminating video footage, but Bryan instead revealed that the attacker was merely a man who resembled Rowan. However, Rowan later turned on Bryan and revealed that he was the attacker the entire time, ending the alliance between the two. On the September 24 episode of SmackDown Live, Bryan was saved by Reigns from an assault from Rowan and Luke Harper. Bryan then joined with Reigns to take down Rowan and Harper, thus turning face in the process. At Hell in a Cell, Bryan teamed with Reigns to defeat Rowan and Harper. On the November 8 episode of SmackDown, Bryan was attacked by Universal Champion \\"The Fiend\\" Bray Wyatt. In response, Bryan challenged Wyatt for the Universal Championship at Survivor Series, which Bryan lost. On the following SmackDown, after Wyatt challenged Bryan to another match, Bryan accepted the challenge and said that the Yes Movement is back. During the Yes chants, Wyatt appeared as The Fiend and attacked Bryan, ripping out his hair and beard. Bryan, sporting a clean shave and hair cut short, returned at TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs to attack Wyatt. On the December 20 episode of SmackDown, Bryan defeated The Miz and King Corbin in a triple threat match to earn another Universal Championship match at the Royal Rumble on January 26, 2020, but Bryan was again unsuccessful at the event. After the Royal Rumble, Bryan began a rivalry with Drew Gulak, who claimed to have \\"found holes in Bryan's game\\". This led to a match being made for the Elimination Chamber pay-per-view on March 8, which Bryan won. On the March 13 episode of SmackDown, Bryan formed an alliance with Gulak, as Gulak managed Bryan during his match against Cesaro, where both were subsequently attacked by Cesaro, Shinsuke Nakamura, and Intercontinental Champion Sami Zayn. On the March 27 episode of SmackDown, after Gulak defeated Nakamura, Bryan earned an Intercontinental Championship match against Zayn at WrestleMania 36 which he lost. On the May 15 episode of SmackDown, Bryan defeated Drew Gulak in the quarter finals of a tournament for the vacant Intercontinental Championship.

Bryan ultimately lost to AJ Styles in the finals on the June 12 episode of SmackDown.  Professional wrestling persona  Bryan in his signature \\"Yes!\\" T-shirt while addressing the audience Bryan wearing a robe at WrestleMania XXVIII Danielson has spent the majority of his career without an overt character in favor of becoming popular with the fans through his monikers, signature mannerisms and wrestling ability, while his attire has varied as well, with the majority of his tenure wearing a pair of short trunks,Murphy, Dan. \\"Report Cards of the Stars\\". Pro Wrestling Illustrated July 2008. 152. but also ventured into wearing a mask for a time in Japan as an extension of his American Dragon persona. A notable part of Danielson's persona is his mannerisms and the reaction he inspires from the crowd during the course of his matches that include: * During his time in ROH, Danielson made his way to the ring to his entrance song (\\"The Final Countdown\\") and once in the ring he stood on the top turnbuckle and sang the refrain along with the fans in attendance.Castle, Al. \\"The Best in the World: Is this more than hype?\\" Pro Wrestling Illustrated February 2009. 50. His theme song is now a variation of \\"Ride of the Valkyries\\". * After winning the ROH World Championship, Danielson displayed traits of a villain-like persona, starting to behave more aggressively and threatening to the fans as well as taking more liberties with the rules, but despite his rulebreaking character he still retained a certain level of popularity with the fans as well as his upholding of the company's Code of Honor, ROH's storyline rules of wrestler conduct, allowing him to perform as a more neutral character. * During his initial reign as ROH World Champion, telling the ring announcer to add an extra note about him appertaining to the current circumstances around his match‚Äîthis was generally insulting the crowd or his opponent. * At the beginning of Danielson's ROH matches the crowd chanted \\"You're gonna get your fucking head kicked in!\\" at Danielson's opponent. * After winning WWE's World Heavyweight Championship, Bryan began shouting \\"Yes!\\" repeatedly on his way to the ring and after defeating an opponent, crediting mixed martial arts fighter Diego Sanchez with the inspiration. This chant grew in popularity and has been even heard outside WWE events such as at Major League Baseball, National Hockey League and National Basketball Association games as well as at music concerts, in particular at Andrew W.K. concerts in both Glasgow and Manchester, England. After turning into a villainous character at the start of 2012, Bryan slowly turned against the fans and after WrestleMania XXVIII in April he began chanting \\"No!\\" instead of \\"Yes!\\". Bryan claimed that the fans were mocking him by chanting \\"Yes!\\" so he chanted \\"No!\\" back at them, but this then further encouraged the crowd to chant \\"Yes!\\" to annoy him as he was a villain. Shortly after turning back into a heroic character, Bryan began saying \\"Yes!\\" again, but would still shout \\"No!\\" when in a negative situation or showing disdain towards a critique which also involved crowd participation. * Bryan's \\"Yes!\\" chant again entered popular culture in late 2013 and early 2014. During Michigan State's regular-season victory over arch-rival Michigan, Spartans guard Travis Jackson celebrated a touchdown with a \\"Yes!\\" chant. (republished by WWE) On January 7, the university honored the football team, fresh off victory in the Rose Bowl, during halftime of the men's basketball home game against Ohio State. Jackson again led Bryan's chant, this time with the entire home crowd, especially the student section, joining in. The event quickly went viral and drew extensive coverage on ESPN's SportsCenter. One contributor to Yahoo! Sports speculated that this event and the associated media coverage led WWE to turn Bryan away from The Wyatt Family. In the wake of Bryan's championship victory at WrestleMania XXX, the Pittsburgh Pirates began using the \\"Yes!\\" chant as a rallying cry, gradually replacing the Zoltan gesture the Pirates had been using the previous two years and it is said that Pirates first baseman Gaby S√°nchez, a huge wrestling fan, was behind the team using the \\"Yes!\\" chants. In May, members of the San Francisco Giants started using the chant and hand gesture to celebrate home runs. This led to Bryan performing the chant at a Giants playoff game and actively supporting the team all the way to the World Series, which the Giants won against the Kansas City Royals in seven games. Bryan was also a part of the team's victory parade. Fans of the New York Islanders now use the \\"Yes!\\" chant after every Islanders goal scored during home games. * On several occasions, such as during the 2013 Slammy Awards, fans have successfully hijacked segments in which Bryan was either not involved in, or involved only secondarily, with his \\"Yes!\\" chant. In the case of the \\"Championship Ascension Ceremony\\" segment, the fan's continuing \\"Yes!\\" chants forced John Cena to go off-script and acknowledge Bryan (especially since the show was held in Seattle) even though the segment was supposed to be about Cena and Randy Orton's impending title unification match. * Danielson, who was a vegan in his day-to-day life previously, incorporated his vegan lifestyle into his villain-like persona to elicit heat from the crowd. * Throughout his career, Bryan has been known as a submission specialist. In his initial run on the independent circuit, he utilized a bridging double chickenwing, named Cattle Mutilation, to finish his opponents. This style has continued throughout his WWE career, where he used an omoplata crossface, which depending on his persona at the time he called either the LeBell Lock, \\"No!\\" Lock, or \\"Yes!\\" Lock. After his return to active performing in 2018, he began using a heel hook to finish matches. * Shortly after capturing the WWE Championship for a fourth time, by low blowing A.J. Styles and turning into a villainous character at the end of 2018, Bryan changed his in-ring persona, beginning to smile more often in a sinister way and not leading any \\"Yes!\\" chants, which resulted in him receiving heat from the crowd. After Survivor Series in November of that year, Bryan also started to repeatedly call the fans \\"fickle\\" while he claimed that the \\"old\\" Daniel Bryan that the people loved and the Yes! Movement are dead before christening himself as the \\"new\\" Daniel Bryan. Bryan's on-screen character then became an ultra-environmentalist who constantly chastises the WWE fans for their blatant consumerism, damaging the environment, while also bashing them for consuming meat, proclaiming that animals were being harmed, including fellow wrestlers such as Mustafa Ali just because they drive an SUV. Two days after the 2019 Royal Rumble, Bryan threw the standard title belt in a garbage can (bemoaning the fact it was made from leather) and introduced a new custom belt with the same design as the standard belt, but made from entirely sustainable materials (such as the strap being made from hemp and the front and side plates carved from the wood of a naturally fallen oak tree) to go with his current persona.  Other media  Danielson was prominently featured in the Wrestling Road Diaries documentary, which was filmed in 2009 before he signed with WWE. In 2011, Danielson recorded a single with Kimya Dawson that was a tribute to wrestling legend \\"Captain\\" Lou Albano. In 2013, Danielson recorded the voice for the character Daniel Bryrock in the animated film The Flintstones & WWE: Stone Age SmackDown!, which was released on March 10, 2015. On July 21, 2015, Danielson published an autobiography entitled Yes: My Improbable Journey to the Main Event of WrestleMania which was co-written by Craig Tello. Danielson was one of the judges on the sixth season of Tough Enough. After his relationship with Brie Bella became a regular feature on E! Network reality series Total Divas, he became part of the cast of the spin off series Total Bellas. Danielson, as Daniel Bryan, has featured in 10 WWE games, starting with WWE '12 in 2011 to WWE 2K Battlegrounds, released in 2020. He was the alternate cover star of WWE 2K14, alongside Dwayne \\"The Rock\\" Johnson. He made his first video game appearance under his real name in WWE 2K19, which featured a showcase story mode based on his career in WWE.  Personal life  Warrior Award by Danielson at the 2015 WWE Hall of Fame ceremony On April 11, 2014, Danielson married WWE wrestler Brie Bella, with whom he had been in a relationship for nearly three years. On April 6, 2016, nearly two months after Danielson's retirement, Bella also semi-retired from wrestling in order to start a family with him. They have a daughter named Birdie Joe Danielson (born May 9, 2017). On August 1, 2020, Brie gave birth to their second child, a boy. In 2009, Danielson relocated to Las Vegas, Nevada, where he began training in MMA at Randy Couture's Xtreme Couture gym. He was also roommates with Xtreme Couture's head grappling trainer, Neil Melanson. Danielson became a vegan in 2009 after suffering from elevated liver enzymes and several staph infections. In 2012, he was awarded a Libby Award from PETA for being the Most Animal-Friendly Athlete. That same year, Mayor Micah Cawley of Yakima, Washington declared January 13 \\"Daniel Bryan Day\\". Later that year, Danielson explained that he was no longer a vegan due to his inability to find vegan food while traveling with WWE. He later elaborated that he had developed a soy intolerance and could not find enough non-soy vegan food, but he still keeps a mostly vegan diet on the road. In 2018, it was reported that both he and his wife are vegetarians. Danielson has stated that he has vitiligo. In October 2012, a social media campaign was started in an attempt to help Connor Michalek meet Danielson, his personal hero. Michalek was six years old at the time and suffered from cancer of the brain and spine. The campaign succeeded, with Danielson meeting Michalek at the Consol Energy Center in December 2012 and again in October 2013. Danielson is a self-described environmentalist and endorsed Green Party nominee Jill Stein in the 2016 United States presidential election. Danielson is a fan of the Seattle Seahawks, and wore Seahawks inspired ring gear at SummerSlam 2018.

Led by Cardinal Jesus Hate and JJ Bedsore (AKA Colin Smith and Jamie Cantwell), the band formed in the early 1980s under the name \\"Coming Blood\\". Their music is a blend of hardcore punk, Oi!, heavy metal, football chants and shock rock. Many of their songs criticize religion or discuss political or philosophical topics. Career Their first single, \\"Megalomania\\", ridiculed the Pope. Doctor Wild Thing played drums on 'Megalomania'. Their second single release \\"Stark Raving Normal\\" (a double A side with Mesrine) criticized one- dimensional patriotism, apathy and mediocrity. The Cardinal calls himself a punk secular humanist. Their first album, False Gestures for a Devious Public featuring Evo (ex Angelic Upstarts,Warfare & Major Accident)on drums (1983), hit the UK top 30 and was voted one of the year‚Äôs best releases by Sounds magazine. They used to be managed by Garry Bushell, and their song \\"Such Fun\\" was on the Oi! compilation album Oi! Oi! That's Yer Lot!. 'False Gestures For A Devious Public' 1983 also included the song 'Mesrine' which was an anthem about the French iconoclastic gangster Jacques Mesrine. 'Mesrine' by The Blood was released in 1983 which preceded the release of the film of the same name that was made in 1984. J.J. Bedsore died in 2004 of multiple organ failure due to years of chronic alcoholism. On 10 December 2006, (International Human Rights Day) The Blood was reformed by the Cardinal and some of his friends to release the song, \\"Kill The Pimps\\", on the Eyeline Productions record label. The song criticizes governments that turn a blind eye to human trafficking. On 11 September 2007, The Blood released their first acoustic DVD, Samurai Lullaby, on the Eyeline Productions record label. The film footage on this DVD is taken from the tragedy of 9/11. On 1 June 2008, The Blood released an acoustic CD album punk@theopera. The concept album reveals the voyage of two young people who struggle to free themselves from human-trafficking pimps and a tyrannical religious cult. In 2010, The Blood's latest work came out, a self-penned album, by The Cardinal, @thebodysnatchersball. On 8 June 2012, The Blood is reformed by The Cardinal, Chema Zurita a.k.a. 'Sonic Offender' and Jesus Ruiz. The new Spanish members of The Blood both grew up in the same town in Alicante. Chema Zurita also being a regular bass player with the Uk Subs. In December 2012 and throughout 2013 the band toured the East and West coast of US, Canada, France, Spain, and Japan bringing the early years anthems back to life as a tribute to The Cardinal and JJ Bedsore's work. In March 2014, The Blood released \\"Chorus of Legends\\", an anthem composed for the World Cup in Brazil 2014. In August 2016, The Cardinal published Vagabond Vendetta, an autobiographical fantasy which is set in the Republic of Frestonia. In chapter eleven of the novel The Cardinal executes Jimmy Savile, Rolf Harris and Stuart Hall based on the historic evidence that Sex Pistol, Johnny Rotten gave to the BBC in 1978.

Pressed glass (or pattern glass)A Brief History of Antique Pressed Glass is a form of glass made using a plunger to press molten glass into a mold. It was first patented by American inventor John P. Bakewell in 1825 to make knobs for furniture. The technique was developed in the United States from the 1820s and in Europe, particularly France, Bohemia, and Sweden from the 1830s. By the mid-19th century, most inexpensive mass-produced glassware was pressed (1850‚Äì1910). One type of pressed glass is carnival glass. Painted pressed glass produced in the early 20th century is often called goofus glass. The method is also used to make beads.

The nephew of fellow wrestler Hulk Hogan, he is best known for his appearances with World Championship Wrestling in the late 1990s under the ring name Horace Hogan. Professional wrestling career=Early career (1990‚Äì1991) Bollea was trained by Boris Malenko, debuting on the Floridian independent circuit in January 1990 under the ring name \\"Horace Boulder\\". Bollea competed for promotions such as the International Championship Wrestling Alliance. Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling (1991‚Äì1992) In May 1991, Bollea joined the Japanese promotion Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling. In mid-1991, Bollea formed a dominant tag team with a fellow gaijin wrestler, The Gladiator. The duo engaged in a long-running feud with Atsushi Onita and Sambo Asako. In April 1992, Bollea began tagging with Sabu. On May 7, 1992 in Tokyo, Bollea and Sabu defeated Onita and Tarzan Goto for the WWA World Martial Arts Tag Team Championship. They held the championship until May 24, 1992, when they were defeated by Goto and Gregory Veritchev in Tokyo. In the same month, Bollea teamed with Negro Casas and Tim Patterson in a six-man tag team bout against Onita, Goto and El Hijo del Santo that received a rare \\"five star\\" ranking from the Wrestling Observer Newsletter. Bollea continued to compete with FMW until December 1992. World Wrestling Federation (1993) In January 1993, Bollea joined the World Wrestling Federation as \\"The Predator\\". He made his televised debut on the January 31, 1993 episode of WWF Wrestling Challenge losing to El Matador. This was his sole televised match in the WWF, as he competed exclusively at house shows for the remainder of his tenure. He was used primarily as a jobber, losing to wrestlers such as Jim Brunzell, Jim Powers, and Marty Jannetty. Bollea made his final appearance with the WWF in August 1993. New Japan Pro Wrestling (1993) In April 1993, Bollea toured Japan with New Japan Pro Wrestling, wrestling as \\"Axe Boulder\\". Extreme Championship Wrestling (1995) In early 1995, Bollea briefly performed with Extreme Championship Wrestling under the ring name \\"Prey of the Dead\\". Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling (1995‚Äì1996, 1998) In mid-1995, Bollea returned to FMW. He joined the stable \\"Lethal Weapon\\" with Hisakatsu Oya, The Gladiator, Mr. Pogo, and Ricky Fuji. He and Oya began teaming together, and won the FMW Brass Knuckles Tag Team Championship from Daisuke Ikeda and Yoshiaki Fujiwara on December 21, 1995 in Yokohama. Their reign lasted until January 5, 1996, when Jason the Terrible and Super Leather defeated them in Tokyo. World Championship Wrestling (1997-2000) Returning to America, Bollea debuted in World Championship Wrestling. On the February 23, 1997 episode of WCW Worldwide, Bollea, as Horace Boulder, defeated J.L. (Jerry Lynn). At Spring Stampede 1998 on April 19, 1998, Boulder officially debuted helping Raven defeat Diamond Dallas Page for the WCW United States Heavyweight Championship and joining Raven's Flock in the process, under the name \\"Horace Boulder\\". He remained in the Flock until the stable disbanded on September 13, 1998. The fall of 1998 would hold one of the most crucial moments in Horace's wrestling career. Hollywood Hogan, backed by fellow New World Order (nWo) Hollywood members, revealed on the October 19, 1998 episode of WCW Monday Nitro that Horace was the son of his dead brother. Showing a sincerity not seen in previous years, he continued by proclaiming his love to his family and offering Horace a membership in the nWo. The mood quickly took a turn for the worse, however, when Hollywood Hogan bashed his nephew with a steel chair, causing a wound that would require several stitches. He continued by throwing his nephew off a stretcher and mercilessly beating him. During this time, Hogan was involved in a heated rivalry with The Ultimate Warrior, and this scene worked as a testament to Hulk's fragile state of mind. With fellow nWo members standing in bewilderment, Hogan took the mic and said \\"If I could do this to someone I love, imagine what I'm gonna do to you, Warrior!\\" Despite their unsettling confrontation, Horace joined the nWo (not the babyface Wolfpac led by Kevin Nash, but the Hollywood version led by his uncle) at Halloween Havoc 1998 on October 25, 1998, by interfering on his uncle's behalf during the final match between Hollywood Hogan and The Warrior. Thereafter, he began using the ring name \\"Horace Hogan\\" to signify his blood ties with Hulk Hogan. He would wrestle for the nWo both in singles competition and tag teaming with the likes of Scott Norton, Stevie Ray, and Vincent, as well as Brian Adams in early 1999 where they came very close to winning the WCW World Tag Team Championship feuding with The Four Horsemen. Hogan also participated in a WCW Thunder battle royal for leadership of the nWo Hollywood faction. When the nWo Elite and B-Team began to dissolve in 1999, Horace began competing for the WCW Hardcore Championship. Horace and his uncle began feuding with Billy Kidman and the New Blood in April 2000, with Horace helping Hogan defeat Kidman at Slamboree 2000 on May 7, 2000. Hogan defected to the New Blood, however, after the leader of the New Blood, Eric Bischoff, offered him Kidman's girlfriend Torrie Wilson in exchange for his assistance. Horace feuded with his uncle until the 2000 Great American Bash on June 11, 2000, when he refereed a rematch between Kidman and his uncle fairly, allowing his uncle to defeat Kidman after interference from Torrie who gave Hulk brass knuckles, which he would use to get the win. After Hulk Hogan left WCW in July 2000 due to a legitimate incident with Vince Russo that happened at that year's Bash at the Beach pay-per-view, Horace left the promotion. Worldwide appearances (2000‚Äì2002) After leaving WCW, Bollea began wrestling around the world, appearing with promotions including the X Wrestling Federation, the World Wrestling Council and Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling. World Wrestling Entertainment (2002) In 2002, Bollea was signed to a developmental contract by World Wrestling Entertainment. He was assigned to the Ohio-based Heartland Wrestling Association development territory. In September, Bollea was recalled to the main roster, wrestling dark matches for the SmackDown brand. He remained with WWE until being released later that month. Following his release, Bollea wrestled briefly on the independent circuit before retiring from professional wrestling to work in the construction industry. Personal life Bollea is the son of Alan Bollea, brother of professional wrestler Terry \\"Hulk Hogan\\" Bollea, making him Hogan's nephew. Bollea's parents separated when he was a child. In 1986, his mother, Martha Alfonso, was murdered by her boyfriend, and his father died of a drug overdose. Bollea has two sisters. The late professional wrestler Michael \\"Mike Awesome\\" Alfonso was Bollea's cousin. The duo were childhood friends, with Bollea encouraging Alfonso to wrestle and helping him secure a job with World Championship Wrestling in the late 1990s. Bollea has two daughters.

The 0th graded component R_0 is sections of the trivial bundle, and is one-dimensional as V is projective. The projective variety defined by this graded ring is called the canonical model of V, and the dimension of the canonical model is called the Kodaira dimension of V.

A line bundle is called big if the Iitaka dimension equals the dimension of the variety. Properties=Birational invariance The canonical ring and therefore likewise the Kodaira dimension is a birational invariant: Any birational map between smooth compact complex manifolds induces an isomorphism between the respective canonical rings. As a consequence one can define the Kodaira dimension of a singular space as the Kodaira dimension of a desingularization. Due to the birational invariance this is well defined, i.e., independent of the choice of the desingularization.

The first festival began on Friday 27 October 1978, and has been held every year since. The festival is Ireland's biggest jazz event and attracts hundreds of musicians and thousands of music fans to the city each year. Jim Mountjoy founded the festival in October 1978. Mountjoy was a marketing manager of the Metropole Hotel in the city at the time, and, faced with filling his property for the weekend, scheduled the first jazz festival to coincide with the newly instituted October bank holiday. A small committee was formed and obtained sponsorship from John Player & Sons. The country's first jazz festival successfully attracted thousands of jazz fans. Guinness became the major sponsor in the 1980s. As festival director between 1978 and 1986, Mountjoy also introduced a Pub Trail, a Jazz Boat (from the UK) and a Jazz Train (from Dublin) to expand the festival. He also travelled to the UK, mainland Europe, Canada and the United States to promote the festival. Non- jazz artists also play at the festival - for example the 2015 line-up included Gary Numan, The Boomtown Rats, and The Coronas. The inclusion of non-jazz performers prompted some analysts to query whether the \\"festival has strayed from its roots\\". Since the 1990s, average annual festival visitor numbers have exceeded 40,000 - with visitors travelling from many parts of the world. In 2016, over 1,000 musicians from 20 countries were scheduled to perform to more than 40,000 visitors.

M. Kaye, published in 1978, which tells the story of an English officer during the British Raj. There are many parallels between this novel and Rudyard Kipling's Kim that was published in 1900: the settings, the young English boy raised as a native by an Indian surrogate mother, \\"the Great Game\\" as it was played by the British Empire and Imperial Russia. The novel, rooted deeply in the romantic epics of the 19th century, has been hailed as a masterpiece of storytelling. It is based partly on biographical writings by the author's grandfather, as well as her knowledge of and childhood experiences in India. It has sold millions of copies, caused travel agents to create tours that visited the locations in the book, and inspired a television adaptation and a musical play. Plot summary Ashton Pelham-Martyn (Ash) is the son of a British botanist travelling through India; he is born on the road shortly before the Sepoy uprising of 1857. His mother dies from childbed fever shortly after his birth, and his father dies of cholera a few years later. He is entrusted to his Hindu ayah (nanny) Sita to be brought to his English relatives in the city of Mardan. After discovering that all English feringhis have been killed during the uprising, Sita adopts the dark-skinned Ash and takes him in search of safety. They eventually find refuge in the kingdom of Gulkote where Ashton, now going by the name Ashok, forgets his English parentage and grows up as a native Indian boy. While working as a servant for Lalji, the young yuveraj (crown prince) of Gulkote, Ashton befriends the neglected princess Anjuli, in addition to the master of stables, Koda Dad, and his son Zarin. At the age of 11, Ashton uncovers a murderous conspiracy against Lalji and learns he himself will be killed for interfering with the plot. Promising Anjuli he will return for her one day, he and Sita escape the palace with assistance from friends Sita and Ashok have made within the palace over the years, and flee from Gulkote. The ailing Sita dies en route, but not before revealing to Ash his true parentage and entrusting him with the letters and money his father gave her before his death. Ashok makes his way to the military division Sita instructed him about, and they recognise him; now known by his English name, Ashton is turned over to English authorities and sent to England for a formal education and military training. At age 19, Ashton returns to India as an officer in the Corps of Guides with Zarin on the Northern Frontier. He quickly finds that his sense of place is torn between his newfound status as Ashton, an English \\"sahib\\", and Ashok, the native Indian boy he once believed he was. After going AWOL in Afghanistan (to restore the honour of his soldiers, penalized for losing weapons to border raiders) Ash is suspended from The Guides and sent to escort a royal wedding party across India. The party is in fact from the former kingdom of Gulkote, now known as Karidkote after merging with a neighbouring princedom, and Anjuli and her sister Shushila are the princesses to be married. Also in the wedding party is Anjuli's younger brother, the prince Jhoti. After revealing himself as Ashok to Anjuli, Ash falls in love with her, but is unable to act on his feelings as she is not only betrothed to another but belongs to what is now an alien culture, across a divide which they can no longer bridge. Over the months that follow, Ash thwarts a plot to murder Jhoti, and falls into increasing despair over his unrequited love for Anjuli. While caught in a dust storm together, Anjuli reveals her love for Ash, but rebuffs his pleas to run away with him out of duty to her sister as a co-bride in an arranged marriage. Ash is forced to watch Anjuli be married off to the lecherous rana of Bhithor and return to his duties in the military. Two years later, Ash receives distressing news that the rana of Bhithor is dying, and that his wives are to be burned alive in the Hindu ritual of suttee. Racing to Bhithor, Ash and his friends manage to rescue Anjuli and take her to safety; this rescue results in the death of not only Ash's beloved horse but also most of the human members of the party. He insists upon marrying Anjuli, despite the insistence of all other members of his group of acquaintances, including Anjuli, that this is not only unnecessary but against God's Law. Here the book's focus shifts from the relationship between Ash and Anjuli to England's and Russia's political wrangling in the regions north of what were the Indian borders at the time. In England's desire to expand its territory into Afghanistan, Ash is sent into the country as a spy to relay information that will help England establish a permanent foothold in the area. What follows is an account of the first phase of the Second Afghan War, culminating in the September 1879 uprising that killed the English envoy in Kabul. This part of the story is told mostly from the perspective of Ash's best friend Walter \\"Wally\\" Hamilton. After the uprising in Kabul, Ash and Anjuli set out in search of a paradise in the Himalayas ‚Äì \\"the far pavilions\\" ‚Äì free of prejudice where they can live out their lives in peace. Critical reception On November 5, 2019, BBC News listed The Far Pavilions on its list of the 100 most influential novels. Characters in The Far Pavilions * Ashton Hillary Akbar (Ashok) Pelham- Martyn * Anjuli-Bai * Koda Dad Khan * Biju Ram * Mrs. Viccary * Shushila-Bai * Belinda Harlowe * Kaka-ji Rao * Walter Hamilton * Zarin Khan * Sita * Lalji * Captain Stiggins * Jhoti * Cavagnari * Wigram Battye Film, TV and theatrical adaptations=Miniseries For HBO and Goldcrest, and first screened in 1984 in the UK, Peter Duffell directed a five-hour three-part television miniseries based on the novel, starring Ben Cross as Ashton, Amy Irving as Anjuli, Omar Sharif as Koda Dad and Christopher Lee as Kaka-ji Rao. It was HBO's first mini series, the complete version runs for 300 minutes, and the parts were entitled \\"Return to India\\", \\"The Journey to Bhithor\\", and \\"Wally and Anjuli\\". (The current DVD release split each of these parts into two, creating 6 parts each of about 50 minutes, added a credit section at the newly created break in each part, and in addition removed the titlecard names of the original parts.) A theatrical release of the series, entitled Blade of Steel, ran 140 minutes, cutting half the story. Although conventional in storytelling and photography, the mini series has ample production value (at a budget of $12 million it was the most expensive made-for-cable movie at the time)Tom Shales, 'TV Previews Plodding \\"Pavilions\\"', The Washington Post (21 April 1984). and is faithful to the book, although cutting short the youth of Ashton before his return to India, and transposing the Afghan rebellion and Ash's rescue of Anjuli. Carl Davis composed the score, which is a much-sought-after collector's item. Much of the film was shot in the precincts of Samode Palace. Goldcrest Films invested ¬£6,755,000 in the production; it incurred a loss of ¬£2 million. Musical A stage musical adaptation of The Far Pavilions, produced by Michael E. Ward, with music composed by Philip Henderson, premiered at the Shaftesbury Theatre in London's West End on 14 April 2005, after two weeks of previews. Despite being booked until 14 January 2006, The Far Pavilions closed on 17 September 2005, following an announcement on 17 August 2005. The musical received mixed reviews, but its closing early was attributed to a steep drop in ticket sales subsequent to the 7/7 London bombings. Budgeted at 7 million pounds, the musical's cast featured Hadley Fraser as Ashton, Simon Gleeson as Walter, Gayatri Iyer as Anjuli, Kulvinder Ghir as the Rana of Bhithor and Kabir Bedi as Kahn Sahib. Whilst in India in March 2006 (to scatter M M Kaye's ashes over Lake Pichola) Michael E. Ward announced that he had written the script for a sequel to The Far Pavilions, entitled Fireflies, whose projected stage premiere was to be in Mumbai in January 2007, with Ward hoping for a subsequent London stage engagement and a film version. There are no evident subsequent reports of any progress in this projected sequel to The Far Pavilions. The Far Pavilions was adapted for BBC Radio 4 in the UK. It was broadcast in twenty 15-minute episodes between 31 January 2011 and 25 February 2011, and repeated on BBC Radio 4 Extra in July and August 2015 and in February 2020. DVD release The 1984 television mini-series was made available on DVD in the UK and US, distributed by Acorn Media UK. ReferencesExternal links * A page dedicated to author M. M.

Modern puffed grains are often created using high temperature, pressure, or extrusion. People eat puffed grains in many ways, but it can be as simple as puffed grain alone and with sugar or salt for taste. Commercial products such as corn flakes and Corn Pops mix many ingredients into a homogeneous batter. The batter is then formed into shapes then toasted and/or extruded. This causes them to rise, but not puff or pop. Puffed grains are very healthful if plain, but when other ingredients are mixed with them they lose some of their previous health benefits.\\"Puffed Rice Nutrition.\\" LIVESTRONG.COM. N.p., n.d. Web. 08 Apr. 2013. Puffed grains are popular as breakfast cereals and in the form of rice cakes. While it is easy to recognize that cereals came from whole grains, the expansion factor for rice cakes is even greater, and the final product is somewhat more homogeneous. History The oldest puffed grain was found in west-central New Mexico in 1948 and 1950. Ears of popcorn were found that were up to 4,000 years old. These pieces of puffed grain were smaller than a penny to two inches in size and can be made in a similar way to popping popcorn.\\"History of Popcorn.\\" History of Popcorn. N.p., n.d. Web. 08 Apr. 2013. Rice has been puffed since ancient times using a technique called hot salt frying in which parboiled rice (e.g. steamed and then dried) is puffed by preheated salt. The modern process of making puffed grains was invented by Dr. Alexander P. Anderson in 1901 in Red Wing, Minnesota. He was doing an experiment dealing with the effect of heat and pressure on corn starch granules where he put them in six glass tubes, sealed them, and put them in an oven until they changed color. When Dr. Anderson took them out and cracked them open an explosion happened, he had made the corn starch turn into a puffed, white mass.\\"Dr. Alexander P. Anderson - 1982 Inductee.\\" Minnesota Inventors Hall of Fame -. N.p., n.d. Web. 08 Apr. 2013. Dr. Alexander's invention of puffed grain was first introduced at the World's Fair in St. Louis in 1904. The puffed grain was shot from a battery of eight guns and on a poster, it was called ‚ÄúThe Eighth Wonder of the World.‚Äù Manufacture Puffed rice can be produced using the simple but effective method of hot salt frying. Salt is heated in a pan until it is hot enough to pop rice added to it within seconds. Parboiled or dried pre-cooked rice is added to the heated contents of the pan and stirred. Puffing starts almost immediately and completes in less than a minute and the rice is scooped out by a sieve. Puffed grain machine in Haikou, Hainan, China. Sometimes called a \\"popcorn hammer\\" High pressure puffed grain is created by placing whole grains under high pressure with steam in a containment vessel. When the vessel's seal is suddenly broken, the entrained steam then flashes and bloats the endosperm of the kernel, increasing its volume to many times its original size. Video showing process using large corn kernels in a roadside machine in Haikou, Hainan, China. Puffed rice or other grains are occasionally found as street food in China, Korea (called \\"ppeong twigi\\" Îª•ÌäÄÍ∏∞), and Japan (called \\"pon gashi\\" „Éù„É≥ËèìÂ≠ê), where hawkers implement the puffing process using an integrated pushcart/puffer featuring a rotating steel pressure chamber heated over an open flame. The great booming sound produced by the release of pressure serves as advertising. Manufacturing puffed grain by venting a pressure chamber is essentially a batch process. To achieve large-scale efficiencies, continuous-process equipment has been developed whereby the pre-cooked cereal is injected into a high pressure steam chamber. It then exits the steam chamber via a Venturi tube to an expansion chamber, where the puffed cereal is collected and conveyed to the next process step. These devices, generally called stream puffing machines, were perfected in the latter half of the 20th century in Switzerland and Italy, but are now available from manufacturers in China as well.

Objects * Description of plant and animal species residing in the tree-summits. Mainly ancient forests and tropical forests are studied. * Study of forest ecosystem dynamics, change drivers and other factors that shape forest systems. * Collection of meteorological data. Meteorological studies can help researchers measure the efficacy of forest canopies in offsetting global climate change. Researchers at the Agricultural Research Service have calibrated a model for forest canopies that measures and estimates the amount of carbon a forest canopy absorbs/releases due to photosynthesis/respiration. The research found that the forest canopy shifted from a carbon ‚Äúsink‚Äù (of net carbon absorption due to photosynthesis) to a carbon ‚Äúsource‚Äù (of net carbon respiration) following the defoliation of the canopy due to the gypsy moth. This research helps scientists determine the role of trees in offsetting carbon released into the atmosphere, which contributes to global warming, and the biological influences that impact it. Chief discoveries * 90% of animal and 50% of plant species in tropical rainforests live in the upper levels of the large trees. As many as 1000 different insects have been collected from one tree. * Tropical forests require a minimum area to develop their crucial micro climate and to provide habitats for larger mammals. * While grown forests continue to store carbon dioxide, young forests store up ten times more. Canopy research is a relatively new scientific field which was hampered for a long time by lack of means of access to the tree canopies and lack of appropriate means of housing researchers. Climbing gear, tree houses, canopy walkways, cranes, airships and inflatable platforms resting on the treetops have lately overcome these barriers. * Cranes have proven to offer the best three-dimensional access. The effort to set them up is worthwhile, as most research projects are long term. * Airships (or dirigibles, or blimps) offer the best means of accessing large areas of canopy. * Tree houses are best for housing because they offer dry, light and secure accommodation without cutting down an area of forest.

It is an independent and autonomous member of the Southern Baptist Convention and the Baptist State Convention of North Carolina (BSCNC). As of May 2005 it had 100 members. The church was involved in a 2005 controversy after the pastor allegedly expelled members because of their political views. History The church was built in 1965. Purge of members The church received mass media attention in May 2005. During a May 2 deacons' meeting, its pastor Chan Chandler allegedly told any members who had supported John Kerry in the 2004 United States presidential election to leave. This statement was reportedly captured on audio tape. Nine members of the church, including at least one deacon, left the meeting at that point. Chandler then allegedly declared an impromptu business meeting, and a majority of the 20 church members present voted to expel those who left. Chandler had been vocal in earlier months that he considered voting for the Democratic Party tantamount to supporting homosexuality and abortion. Forty church members threatened to terminate their membership in protest against the actions taken at the meeting.Church removes members for political views, deacon says The Biblical Recorder The BSCNC called the actions attributed to the church leadership \\"highly irregular\\" and warned that they could threaten the church's tax-exempt status.Politics Prompt Church Tax Questions Washington Post Groups campaigning for church-state separation called for the Internal Revenue Service to consider removing the church's tax-exempt status on the grounds that it engaged in political advocacy.East Waynesville Action 'Highly Irregular' North Carolina Baptists A writer in Christianity Today said the negative comments about John Kerry cross a line and could have fomented negative tax action. He noted, however, that the parish suffered from a demographic split. Dubbing it \\"Chandlergate\\" he noted that according to the Raleigh News and Observer, 35 Chandler followers left the sanctuary when Chandler resigned. In speaking to the Baptist Press, Chandler attempted \\"to clarify whether the nine people were in fact voted out of the church, Chandler said they initially left voluntarily.\\" He also told the Baptist Press: \\"I don't know how these folks voted,\\" Chandler told Baptist Press. \\"And I never endorsed any candidate.\\" But he admits he preached about the \\"unbiblical values\\" of John Kerry, particularly in regard to abortion and homosexuality. He also claimed to have \\"mentioned two Republicans' names\\" as unbiblical examples. He opined that he made \\"negative endorsements\\" but \\"never a positive endorsement\\" of a candidate.> On May 10, 2005 Chandler resigned as pastor.Pastor Accused of Running Out Dems Resigns He denied that the actions at the meeting were politically motivated, but did not give his version of events. The BSCNC offered to assist the church in healing the rift between the factions. At least some of the former parishioners continued to be disgruntled, and contemplated taking further actions, including hiring an attorney. The dispute focused attention on the limits, if any, on the relationship of sermonizing from the pulpit and the political activities of religious practitioners. An opposing view is that a church, being a voluntary association, has an inherent right to discipline and choose its members incidental to its rights of Freedom of religion and Freedom of association, which should not be interfered with by the state.

History Kingham Hill was purpose built by the Christian philanthropist Charles Edward Baring Young in 1886. He put his faith into practice by establishing it as a place where boys with a boarding need could be educated and prepared for life. In the early days the school was a virtually self-sufficient community. It had a farm, a wide range of workshops, a school building, a chapel, a sanatorium and various boarding houses. The Founder ensured that every Kingham boy learned their ‚Äòletters‚Äô, gained a trade and had the benefit of understanding the Christian faith. On leaving they could progress to accommodation and opportunities in London or emigrate to a farm the Founder owned in Canada and make their life in the New World.

Quercus) native to southern Europe and southwest Asia, from northern Spain (Pyrenees) east to the Crimea and the Caucasus. It is also found in France and parts of central Europe. Habitat Downy oaks typically grow in dry, lime-rich soils. It is a submediterranean species, growing from the coastline to deep in the continent. Its optimum is in the submediterranean region, characterized by hot dry summers and cool winters with little rain fall. In western and central Europe, downy oak is confined to areas with submediteranean microclimate (gorges, sandplains, steppe slopes) or to coastlines of former lakes. Description Quercus pubescens is a medium-sized deciduous tree growing up to 20 m. Forest-grown trees grow tall, while open-growing trees develop a very broad and irregular crown. They are long-lived, to several hundred years, and eventually grow into very stout trees with trunks up to 2 m in diameter. Open-grown trees frequently develop several trunks. The bark is very rough, light grey and divided into small flakes. Large trees develop very thick whitish bark cracked into deep furrows, similar to the pedunculate oak but lighter in colour. The twigs are light purple or whitish, tomentose. The buds are small (3‚Äì6 mm) and blunt, light brown. The leaves are leathery usually 4‚Äì10 cm long (rarely to 13 cm) and 3‚Äì6 cm wide, usually widest beyond the middle. The leaves group at the ends of twigs. The upper leaf surface is dark green and rough, the lower light green. Both leaf surfaces are covered with minute pubescence which is sometimes lost in older leaves by late summer. The young expanding leaves are whitish or pinkish with very soft tomentum. The leaf shape is very variable, divided into 3-7 pairs of deep or shallow lobes, which are usually divided into a few sublobes. The lobes are usually blunt, rarely sharp. The apex is usually wide and round. The base of the leaf is heart shaped, widely rounded or sometimes pointed. The petioles are 4‚Äì15 mm (rarely to 22 mm) long, stout and pubescent. The leaves are persistent late into the autumn, remaining green up to early winter. They eventually turn russet or brown and fall off. The Quercus pubescens acorns are light brown to yellow, 8‚Äì20 mm long, usually thin and pointed. The acorn cups are light grey to almost white, with pointed, overlapping scales, covered with tomentum. The acorn stalks are thick and pubescent, up to 2 cm long. The acorns usually occur in groups of 2-5 on the same stalk.

According to scholar Jonathan A.C. Brown, although \\"the Ash'ari school of theology is often called the Sunni Sufi 'orthodoxy,'\\" \\"the original ahl al-hadith, early Sufi creed from which Ash'arism evolved has continued to thrive alongside it as a rival Sunni 'orthodoxy' as well.\\" According to Brown this competing orthodoxy exists in the form of the \\"Hanbali √ºber-Sunni orthodoxy\\". Al-Ash øarƒ´ was notable for taking an intermediary position between the two diametrically opposed schools of theological thought prevalent at the time. He opposed both the Mu øtazilites, who advocated the extreme use of reason in theological debate and believed the Quran was created, as opposed to uncreated. Ashari refuted this by stating \\"if the Quran was created then that implied God created this knowledge, and thus did not have knowledge of the Quran before this, and this contradicts God's omnipotence as he is all knowing, and therefore must have always had knowledge of the Quran\\". The Zahirites, Mujassimites and Muhaddithin, were also opposed to the use of philosophy or kalam, and condemned any theological debate altogether.M. Abdul Hye,Ash‚Äôarism, Philosophia Islamica. Al-Ash øari's school eventually won \\"wide acceptance within some sects of Sunni Islam. However Shiaism do not accept his beliefs, as Ashari's works involved refuting shiaism and the mutazila, which was the doctrine held by shiaism. His original versions of his text did not survive. Muqaltu Islamiyyah. Due to his efforts, Al-Ash øarƒ´ came to be revered by sects of Sunni Sufi Muslims for having successfully \\"integrated the rationalist methodology of the speculative theologians into the framework of Sufi orthodox Islam.\\" Biography Al- Ash'ari was born in Basra,John L. Esposito, The Islamic World: Abbasid- Historian, p 54. Iraq, and was a descendant of the famous companion of Muhammad, Abu Musa al-Ashari.I.M.N. Al-Jubouri, History of Islamic Philosophy: With View of Greek Philosophy and Early History of Islam, p 182. As a young man he studied under al-Jubba'i, a renowned teacher of Mu øtazilite theology and philosophy.Marshall Cavendish Reference, Illustrated Dictionary of the Muslim World, p 87. He remained a Mu øtazalite until his fortieth year and he abandoned al-Jubba'i's doctrines in his fortieth year after asking him a question al-Jubba'i failed to resolve over the issue of the supposed divine obligation to abandon the good for the sake of the better (al-s√¢lih wa al- aslah). At that time he adopted the doctrines of the sifatiyya, those of Ahlu- s-Sunnah. He left Basra and came to Baghdad, taking fiqh from the Shafi\`i jurist Abu Ishaq al-Marwazi (d. 340). He devoted the next twenty-four years to the refutation of \\"the Mu\`tazila, the Rafida, the Jahmiyya, the Khawarij, and the rest of the various kinds of innovators\\" in the words of al-Khatib. His student Bundar related that his yearly expenditure was a meagre seventeen dirhams. His three best-known disciples were al-BƒÅhilƒ´, a·π£-·π¢u øl≈´kƒ´, and Ibn MujƒÅhid, all of whom transmitted the doctrines of their master to what later became the flourishing school of KhorƒÅsƒÅn. After al-Ash øarƒ´ died, his disciples slowly disentangled the main lines of doctrine that eventually became the stamp of the Ash øarite school. Al-Ash'ari saw Muhammad in a dream 3 times in Ramadan. The first time, Muhammad told him to support what was related from himself, that is, the traditions (hadiths).William Montgomery Watt, Islamic Philosophy and Theology, p 84. Al-Ash'ari became worried as he had numerous strong proofs contradictory to the traditions. After 10 days, he saw Muhammad again: Muhammad reiterated that he should support the traditions. So Al-Ash'ari forsook Kalam and started following the traditions alone. On the 27th night of Ramadan, he saw Muhammad for the last time. Muhammad told him that he had not commanded him to forsake Kalam, he had only told him to support the traditions narrated from him (Muhammad). Thereupon Al-Ash'ari started to advocate the Hadith, finding proofs for these that he said he had not read in any books. After this experience, he left the Mu øtazalites and became one of its most distinguished opponents, using the philosophical methods he had learned. Al-Ash'ari then spent the remaining years of his life engaged in developing his views and in composing polemics and arguments against his former Mu øtazalite colleagues. He is said to have written up to three hundred works, of which only four or five are known to be extant.I. M. Al-Jubouri, Islamic Thought: From Mohammed to September 11, 2001, p 177. Views After leaving the Mu øtazili school, and joining the side of Traditionalist theologians al-Ash'ari formulated the theology of Sunni Islam.John L. Esposito, The Oxford History of Islam, p 280. He was followed in this by a large number of distinguished scholars, most of whom belonged to the Shafi'i school of law.http://www.arabnews.com/node/211921 The most famous of these are Abul-Hassan Al-Bahili, Abu Bakr Al-Baqillani, al-Juwayni, Al-Razi and Al-Ghazali. Thus Al-Ash'ari's school became, together with the Maturidi, the main schools reflecting the beliefs of the Sunnah. In line with Sunni tradition, al-Ash'ari held the view that a Muslim should not be considered an unbeliever on account of a sin even if it were an enormity such as drinking wine or theft. This opposed the position held by the Khawarij.Jeffry R. Halverson, Theology and Creed in Sunni Islam: The Muslim Brotherhood, Ash'arism, and Political Sunnism, p 77. Al-Ash'ari also believed it impermissible to violently oppose a leader even if he were openly disobedient to the commands of the sacred law. Al-Ash'ari spent much of his works opposing the views of the Mu øtazili school. In particular, he rebutted them for believing that the Qur'an was created and that deeds are done by people of their own accord. He also rebutted the Mu øtazili school for denying that Allah can hear, see and has speech. Al-Ash‚Äôari confirmed all these attributes stating that they differ from the hearing, seeing and speech of creatures, including man. He was also noted for his teachings on atomism.Ash'ari - A History of Muslim Philosophy The Salafis argue that he had accepted the Salafi theology before his death. Legacy The 18th century Islamic scholar Shah Waliullah stated: :A Mujadid appears at the end of every century: The Mujadid of the first century was Imam of Ahlul Sunnah, Umar bin Abdul Aziz. The Mujadid of the second century was Imam of Ahlul Sunnah Muhammad Idrees Shaafi. The Mujadid of the third century was the Imam of Ahlul Sunnah, Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari. The Mujadid of the fourth century was Abu Abdullah Hakim Nishapuri.Izalat al-Khafa, p. 77, part 7. Earlier major scholars also held positive views of al-Ash'ari and his efforts, among them Qadi Iyad and Taj al- Din al-Subki.Fatwa No. 8001. Who are the Ash'arites? - Dar al-Ifta' al- Misriyyah Works The Ashari scholar Ibn Furak numbers Abu al-Hasan al- Ash'ari's works at 300, and the biographer Ibn Khallikan at 55;Beirut, III, p.286, tr. de Slaine, II, p.228 Ibn AsƒÅker gives the titles of 93 of them, but only a handful of these works, in the fields of heresiography and theology, have survived. The three main ones are: *Maqalat al-Islamiyyin wa Ikhtilfa al- Musallin (\\"The Discourses of the Proponents of Islam and the Differences Among the Worshippers\\"), an encyclopaedia of deviated Islamic sects.,ed.

For example, Richard McCarthy, in his Theology of Ash'ari, writes, \\"...I am unable to subscribe wholeheartedly to the proposition that the ibƒÅna, in the form in which we have it, is a genuine work of al-Ash'ari,\\" comparing the creed in that book to the creed found in al- Ash'ari's MaqƒÅlƒÅt.

A university-based school of theology, Candler educates ministers, scholars of religion and other leaders. It is also one of 13 seminaries affiliated with the United Methodist Church.  Mission Statement  Candler School of Theology is grounded in the Christian faith and shaped by the Wesleyan tradition of evangelical piety, ecumenical openness, and social concern. Its mission as a university-based school of theology is to educate‚Äîthrough scholarship, teaching, and service‚Äîfaithful and creative leaders for the church's ministries throughout the world. History Candler School of Theology In March 1914, the Methodist Episcopal Church, South (MECS) and Vanderbilt University, a flagship institution of higher education for the church, severed ties. MECS appointed an Educational Commission to establish a university in the Southeast that would be a place where pastors-in-training at Vanderbilt could continue their education by the fall. Asa Candler, founder of The Coca-Cola Company and brother of commission chair Warren Candler, promised one million dollars for the endowment of the southeastern university. The commission voted unanimously to locate it in Atlanta. Emory College in Oxford, Georgia, agreed to become the undergraduate division of the university and the university was given the name Emory University in recognition of the college's history. In September 1914, the theology school began instruction at Wesley Memorial Church, moving to the Druid Hills campus in 1916. In 1915, the Emory University trustees voted to name the theology school Candler, though the meeting minutes don‚Äôt indicate definitively whether the name is in honor of Warren or Asa Candler. In 1922, Candler faculty elected to offer admission to female students, despite the fact that the Methodist Episcopal Church, South did not offer a path to ordination for women. It wasn‚Äôt until 1938 that Mary Vaughn Johnson became the first woman to be awarded Emory's bachelor of divinity degree. The United States‚Äô involvement in World War II decreased enrollment at Candler, and focused the school's training of remaining students for military chaplaincy, a vocation that half of the graduating class of 1943 pursued. Kiyoshi Tanimoto, a 1940 graduate of Candler, was serving a Methodist church in Hiroshima when the atomic bomb is dropped. Tanimoto later devoted his life to helping the survivors and speaking out for nuclear disarmament. Despite the U.S. Supreme Court's Brown v. Board of Education decision in 1954, Georgia resisted attempts at racial integration. In 1957, 80 white religious leaders signed what became known as the ‚ÄúMinisters‚Äô Manifesto‚Äù calling for an end to segregation in the city's schools. A year later, Atlanta newspapers published another open letter from Emory faculty and administrators reiterating the need to integrate the public schools; nearly the entire theology faculty signed the letter. In 1965, Candler's first black student, Otis Turner, enrolled. In 1971, Charles Gerkin led the design of a three-year program of supervised ministry as a curriculum requirement. In addition to field placements at sites ranging from hospitals and homeless shelters to local churches, the program also included time for reflection seminars led by faculty. This program came to be known as Contextual Education, or ConEd. In 1974, the Anglican Studies program began. Later renamed Episcopal Studies, the program is the oldest university-based Episcopal ministry education program in the country. In 1975, Candler librarian Channing Jeschke persuaded Dean James T. Laney to purchase the Hartford Theological Seminary library collection, which grew the library's holdings from 90,000 volumes to more than 300,000. That same year, the theology building began renovations to serve as a library for the new collection. In 1976, the building was renamed Pitts Theology Library in recognition of Margaret Pitts and her father, William I.H. Pitts, and the Pitts Foundation's assistance in purchasing the Hartford collection. In 1978, Roberta C. Bondi became the first female faculty member on the tenure track of the theology school. Though Candler had employed female visiting professors and untenured lecturers, Bondi's appointment marked the first time a woman was officially on faculty. That same year, Paul Rudolph was retained to design a new chapel, and in 1979, U.S. President Jimmy Carter presided over the groundbreaking of Cannon Chapel, named in honor of former dean William R. Cannon. In 1990, Robert M. Franklin, Jr. launched Candler's Black Church Studies Program. Franklin later would become president of Morehouse College and returned to Candler in 2014 as the inaugural James T. and Berta R. Laney Chair of Moral Leadership. In 1991, the Program in Women's Studies was launched under part-time director Kris Kvam; it would later be renamed the Program for Women in Theology and Ministry. That same year, Nancy Ammerman founded Candler's Baptist Studies Program. In 2007, Jan Love became Candler's first female dean. Candler School of Theology observed its centennial in the 2014-15 academic year with a series of events that acknowledged Candler's contributions to theological education and to the church during the past 100 years; its role within and contribution to Emory University during the past 100 years; its vision for addressing the challenges and opportunities facing theology in the 21st century; and the accomplishments of Candler's faculty, alumni and friends/donors. Three members of the faculty are fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences: E. Brooks Holifield, Carol A. Newsom, and Carl R. Holladay. Academics=Degrees and Accreditation Candler School of Theology has been accredited by the Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada (ATS) since 1938.

The library also acquires materials in contiguous areas that are related to the history of other religious traditions (especially early Judaism), the interpretation of Jewish and Christian scriptures (e.g., historical and philological works related to the ancient Near East, Greece, and Rome), the history of Christianity (e.g., political and social history of the lands in which Christianity spread), the development of Christian theology (e.g., philosophy, ethics, literature), and the practice of Christian life and ministry (e.g., music, sociology, psychology). While most materials collected are in English, German, French, and Latin, materials in other languages are also acquired as necessary. The Pitts Library subscribes to more than 1,100 periodicals, with special strength in titles from sub-Saharan Africa, and typically adds over 7,000 volumes to its collections annually. The Special Collections of the library are extensive, including over 130,000 rare or special books and nearly 2,500 linear feet of unpublished archival materials. These collections include: * Over 3,500 books and several rare manuscripts documenting the history of the Protestant Reformation in Germany to 1570, * About 11,000 early North European theological dissertations, * About 15,000 works of English and American hymnody and psalmody, * Over 35,000 books and extensive archival materials related to English religious history from 1660 to 1920, and * Extensive institutional records of Methodist organizations and of organizations concerned with pastoral care and theological education. Margaret A. Pitts, a devout Methodist and supporter of its educational institutions, was responsible for much of the library's growth, providing substantial gifts for new acquisitions. In 1976, the library was named in honor of Pitts and her father, W. I. H. Pitts.  Institutes and Initiatives = Luce International Initiative  In 2011, Candler School of Theology received a grant from the Henry Luce Foundation to create a model curriculum for internationalism for accredited North American seminaries. The grant has enabled the school to develop faculty and student exchanges, organize seminars and propose new forms of pedagogy in order to build and sustain reciprocal relationships with partner schools abroad and transform its curriculum at home.  Youth Theological Initiative  In 1993, Dr. Craig Dykstra partnered with Candler School of Theology and Lilly Endowment, Inc. to create the Youth Theological Initiative. Since then, the program has focused on developing theologically-grounded, socially-conscious ministries with youth and young adults, by educating and preparing youth ministers, and leading a summer program for high school students to engage in justice-seeking theological education. In addition, the Initiative conducts research into the theological perspectives of youth.  World Methodist Evangelism Institute  The World Methodist Evangelism Institute provides opportunities for pastors and lay persons to earn continuing education credits while gaining experience in evangelism in other cultures, offers training in faith-sharing in a non-confrontational approach, and provides opportunities for seminary students to engage with students from other seminaries across the world. Since its founding in 1982, this joint ministry of Candler School of Theology and the World Methodist Council has sponsored 59 major seminars in more than 121 countries around the world.  Certificate in Theological Studies  The Certificate in Theological Studies program is a collaborative project of the Atlanta Theological Association (ATA) and Arrendale State Prison‚Äôs Chaplaincy Department. It is a yearlong program of theological education for incarcerated women, with classes designed and taught by graduate students and faculty from four ATA schools: Candler School of Theology, McAfee School of Theology at Mercer University, the Interdenominational Theological Center and Columbia Theological Seminary.  Candler School of Theology Honor's Day  A variety of prizes in recognition of vocational and academic achievements by students and staff are awarded annually at the Candler School of Theology Honors Day. Awards for vocational excellence and community service include the Claude H. Thompson Award for work in the area of justice and reconciliation, the Berta and James T. Laney Award in Contextual Education, the Charles Owen Smith Award, the Fellowship Seminarian Award, the Hoyt Hickman Award, the Community Service Award, the John Owen Smith Award, the Ruth Sewell Flowers Award, and the Frederick Buechner Prize for Excellence in Preaching. Awards for academic excellence include the United Methodist Foundation for Christian Higher Education Award, the United Methodist First Career Seminary Award, the United Methodist Scholarship Seminary Award, the Myki Mobley Award, the Nolan B. Harmon Award, the John D. and Alice Slay Award, the Chad Davis Memorial Award, the Boone M. Bowen Award, the Russell E. Richey Award, the G. Ray Jordan Award, and the Academic Excellence Awards.  Buildings and Facilities = Rita Anne Rollins Building (Phase I)  Completed in 2008, the 65,000-square- foot Rita Anne Rollins Building houses Candler School of Theology classrooms, administrative and faculty offices, community gathering spaces, and Emory's Center for Ethics. The building supports SMART technology and reflects Emory's architectural style and its commitment to sustainability, featuring Italianate design with marble and stucco exteriors and a clay tile roof, as well as LEED silver certification from the U.S. Green Building Council. In recognition of the support of the O. Wayne Rollins Foundation of Atlanta, Emory University named Phase I of the new Candler School of Theology building in memory of the late Rita Anne Rollins. Candler School of Theology's Phase II building project was completed in August 2014 and connects the classrooms and administrative offices in the Rita Anne Rollins Building with the Pitts Theology Library, as well as the Wesley Teaching Chapel, new group study rooms for students, a glassed-in atrium and an outdoor plaza. The building is located at 1531 Dickey Drive.  Candler School of Theology Building (Phase II)  Candler's Phase II building project is connected to the Rita Anne Rollins Building. Completed in August 2014, the building includes a new home for Pitts Theology Library, an exhibit gallery, an 80-seat lecture hall, the Wesley Teaching Chapel, group study rooms, a glassed-in atrium, an outdoor plaza and office space for Candler's IT staff and Pitts Library staff. Like the Rita Anne Rollins Building, the building supports wireless technology and reflects Emory's iconic architectural style and its commitment to sustainability, with expected LEED certification from the U.S. Green Building Council.  Pitts Theology Library  For its first 99 years, Pitts Theology Library was housed in the oldest building on the Emory Campus, constructed in 1915. The School of Theology originally occupied the top floor, and the university chapel occupied the Durham Reading Room. The original library for the School of Theology was held in the room that most recently contained the periodical collection. Pitts Library moved to the Phase II building in 2014. The library now provides an elevator, wireless access, expanded seating options, and enhanced accessibility, as well as proximity to the classrooms and staff offices for the Candler School of Theology. Cannon Chapel - Interior  Cannon Chapel  Cannon Chapel, named for William R. Cannon, who was dean of Candler School of Theology and later a bishop of the United Methodist Church, was designed by internationally acclaimed architect Paul Rudolph, son of one of Candler School of Theology's first graduates. Ground was broken for the chapel on August 30, 1979, by President Jimmy Carter. The building was consecrated on September 30, 1981. The building houses the office of the Dean of the Chapel, Candler School of Theology's Office of Worship, a large chapel, meeting space, and academic classrooms. Weekly services including Catholic mass and University Worship take place in this building.  Swanson Art at Candler  Candler School of Theology holds an extensive collection of the work of Los Angeles artist John August Swanson. Noted for his finely detailed, brilliantly colored paintings and original prints, Swanson has works displayed in some of the world's most prestigious venues, including three museums of the Smithsonian Institution: The National Museum of American History, The Smithsonian American Art Museum and The National Air and Space Museum, The Art Institute of Chicago, London's Tate Gallery and Victoria and Albert Museum, the Vatican Museums‚Äô Collection of Modern Religious Art, and the Biblioth√®que Nationale in Paris, among others. Candler's holdings‚Äîcurrently 55 pieces‚Äîcomprise the largest single collection of Swanson's art in the world.  Affiliated Organizations  The Aquinas Center of Theology, the Center for the Study of Law and Religion, the Graduate Division of Religion, Methodist Review, Office of Religious Life, and the Practical Matters Journal are among many organizations at Emory or affiliated with the university that are associated with the work and programs of Candler.

History  Archway TowerArchway Tower was built in 1963 by the UK government. In 1967, the building was sold off and rented back on a 42-year lease and used for Social Security. The building was empty for several years before becoming home to the Public Guardianship Office in 2001, which became the Court of Protection and the Office of the Public Guardian in 2007. In October 2007, the tower was sold by Wichford plc to Scarborough Property Group.[2] The Court and the Office of the Public Guardian vacated the building in 2011. After sitting vacant for 2 years, Essential Living purchased Archway Tower in 2013 for ¬£6 million[3], with plans to make the building \\"one of the country‚Äôs biggest office to residential conversions\\".  Refurbishment for rental = Design  The project involved the change of use from commercial to residential and a re-cladding. The change of use and refurbishment of a 50-year-old building presented significant challenges. Whilst the 1960s construction was very robust, the construction tolerances acceptable during construction of the building have been very different to those at time of the refurbishment. This meant that interfaces between the old structure and the new fa√ßade needed to be very well thought through and detailed. Issues such as cold bridging, loading factors and the use of asbestos were all addressed during the design phase.  Completion  After 2 years' construction the renamed building reopened on 1 September 2016. Vantage Point now has 118 studio, 1-bedroom and 2-bedroom rental flats on floors 1-15, along with shared amenity space on the 16th and 17th floors.  In popular culture  Archway Tower is said to have inspired the song \\"Archway Towers\\" by New Model Army. Toppers' House in Nick Hornby's 2005 novel A Long Way Down is said to have been indirectly inspired by Archway Tower, but also by the eponymous Archway over Archway Road.

It deals with the coming and death of Joachim Stiller, a messiah-like figure, and has magical-realist elements in it. A film based on the novel was made in 1976. Plot summary The main character in the novel is Freek Groenevelt, a 37-year-old journalist living in Antwerp. From a caf√©, he witnesses four workers breaking up a street and then closing it up again, for no apparent reason. When he decides to write an article about the event, he is contacted by a member of the Antwerp city council, Mr. Keldermans. Mr. Keldermans explains to Groenevelt that things are happening which he does not understand and make him afraid. Groenevelt is sceptical at first, but Keldermans seems honest and Groenevelt leaves in a state of confusion. He then receives a letter from Joachim Stiller, in which Stiller announces that the event he witnessed is a portent. To Groenevelt's confusion, the letter is stamped one and a half years before he was born. Later on, Groenevelt goes to visit the editors of a literary magazine, \\"Atomium\\", which has published a very critical article about him. One of the editors, Simone Marijnissen, explains that they have received a letter from, again, Joachim Stiller, asking them not to criticize Groenevelt. They thought that Groenevelt had written the letter himself and saw this as a reason to attack him. Over the next few days, Joachim Stiller continues to manifest himself. He writes another letter to Marijnissen, and Groenevelt finds a 16th- century book, written by a German theologian from Augsburg called Joachim Stiller. Groenevelt and Marijnissen (who are fast falling in love with each other) visit an art historian, who determines that the letter is thirty-eight years old: again, just one year older than Groenevelt. A graphologist determines that Stiller's handwriting is exactly what he would expect from a man \\"who doesn't exist at all, but could nonetheless write\\". Marijnissen spends the night in Groenevelt's apartment, and they are awakened by the sounds of a carillon, which nobody else seems to hear. Then, the telephone rings, and an unknown person promises: \\"One day I will free you from all your fears.\\" Then, as persistent rumours announcing the end of the world start to run around the city, Groenevelt contacts Keldermans, who explains that these rumours have been spread by people unknown. He had detailed some police officers to keep things quiet, but these have disappeared without a trace. Groenevelt, now understandably nervous, visits a psychiatrist, but apart from high blood pressure, nothing seems to be wrong. He does remember an episode from his early youth, when he witnessed a rocket attack in the Second World War. An American soldier was mortally wounded in the attack, and suddenly Groenevelt remembers the GI's name: Major Joachim Stiller, Longwood, Massachusetts. When Groenevelt comes home, Marijnissen tells him she is expecting their child. Furthermore, a letter from Joachim Stiller has arrived, telling them that he will arrive on Friday evening. On Friday evening, Groenevelt and Marijnissen go to the train station, where they meet Keldermans. At half past nine, a man comes out of the station, whom Groenevelt recognises as the American soldier from his youth. The man smiles, and says: \\"I am Joachim Stiller\\", but immediately after that he is hit by a truck. Later, at the police station, it proves impossible to identify the man. Three days later, when Groenevelt and Marijnissen try to visit Stiller's body, it has disappeared. Keldermans's connection with Joachim Stiller is also revealed: his daughter has died in the same attack that Groenevelt has witnessed.

It was a victory for a French force of seven ships over a Dutch force of five ships and the convoy it was escorting. The battle On this date the French privateer Jean Bart found a Dutch convoy of 112 merchant ships, escorted by five Dutch ships near Dogger Bank. The French had more warships and more cannons than the Dutch. Furthermore, the French crews were very experienced and led by an exceptional commander, so the outcome of the battle was very predictable. But the French had to hurry, because a large English squadron under admiral John Benbow was aware of the French presence and was looking for them. The battle started on 19:00 h. when Jean Bart on the Maure attacked the Dutch flagship, the Raadhuis-van-Haarlem. the Dutch fought valiantly for three hours until their captain was killed. Then they surrendered and so did the 4 other ships, one after another. Jean Bart captured and burned 25 merchant ships until Benbow's squadron of 18 ships approached. The French squadron fled towards Denmark. They remained there until July and then slipped through the allied lines into Dunkirk with 1200 prisoners, on September 27.

An aviso (Portuguese and Spanish term for \\"advice\\", \\"notice\\" or \\"warning\\", formerly also an adviso) was originally a kind of dispatch boat or \\"advice boat\\". The term was later adopted by the French and Portuguese navies to classify their medium-sized warships designed for colonial service. The term continued to be used in the French Navy to classify the patrol frigates until 2012, when the remaining ships of the class were reclassified as offshore patrol ships. It is equivalent to the modern use of \\"sloop\\" in other countries. Description The Dictionnaire de la Marine Fran√ßaise 1788‚Äì1792 (by Nicolas-Charles Romme) describes avisos as \\"small boats designed to carry orders or dispatches\\".

In \\"The polymodal logic of provability\\"G. Japaridze, \\"The polymodal logic of provability\\". Intensional Logics and Logical Structure of Theories. Metsniereba, Tbilisi, 1988, pages 16-48 (Russian). Japaridze proved the arithmetical completeness of this system, as well as its inherent incompleteness with respect to Kripke frames. GLP has been extensively studied by various authors during the subsequent three decades, especially after Lev Beklemishev, in 2004,L. Beklemishev, \\"Provability algebras and proof-theoretic ordinals, I\\". Annals of Pure and Applied Logic 128 (2004), pages 103-123. pointed out its usefulness in understanding the proof theory of arithmetic (provability algebras and proof-theoretic ordinals). Japaridze has also studied the first-order (predicate) versions of provability logic. He came up with an axiomatization of the single-variable fragment of that logic, and proved its arithmetical completeness and decidability.G. Japaridze, \\"Decidable and enumerable predicate logics of provability\\". Studia Logica 49 (1990), pages 7-21. In the same paper he showed that, on the condition of the 1-completeness of the underlying arithmetical theory, predicate provability logic with non-iterated modalities is recursively enumerable. InG. Japaridze, \\"Predicate provability logic with non-modalized quantifiers\\". Studia Logica 50 (1991), pages 149-160. he did the same for the predicate provability logic with non-modalized quantifiers. In 1992‚Äì1993, Japaridze came up with the concepts of cointerpretability, tolerance and cotolerance, naturally arising in interpretability logic.G. Japaridze, \\"The logic of linear tolerance\\". Studia Logica 51 (1992), pages 249-277.G. Japaridze, \\"A generalized notion of weak interpretability and the corresponding modal logic\\". Annals of Pure and Applied Logic 61 (1993), pages 113-160. He proved that cointerpretability is equivalent to 1-conservativity and tolerance is equivalent to 1-consistency. The former was an answer to the long-standing open problem regarding the metamathematical meaning of 1-conservativity. Within the same line of research, Japaridze constructed the modal logics of toleranceG. Japaridze, \\"A generalized notion of weak interpretability and the corresponding modal logic\\". Annals of Pure and Applied Logic 61 (1993), pages 113-160. (1993) and of the arithmetical hierarchyG. Japaridze, \\"The logic of arithmetical hierarchy\\".

Japaridze is best known for founding Computability Logic in 2003 and making subsequent contributions to its evolution. This is a long-term research program and a semantical platform for \\"redeveloping logic as a formal theory of (interactive) computability, as opposed to the formal theory of truth that it has more traditionally been\\".G. Japaridze, \\"Introduction to clarithmetic I\\". Information and Computation 209 (2011), pages 1312-1354. In 2006G. Japaridze, \\"Introduction to cirquent calculus and abstract resource semantics\\". Journal of Logic and Computation 16 (2006), pages 489-532. Japaridze conceived cirquent calculus as a proof-theoretic approach that manipulates graph-style constructs, termed cirquents, instead of the more traditional and less general tree-like constructs such as formulas or sequents. This novel proof-theoretic approach was later successfully used to \\"tame\\" various fragments of computability logic,G.

It was also used to (define and) axiomatize the purely propositional fragment of independence- friendly logic.G. Japaridze, \\"From formulas to cirquents in computability logic\\".

The birth of cirquent calculus was accompanied with offering the associated \\"abstract resource semantics\\". Cirquent calculus with that semantics can be seen as a logic of resources which, unlike linear logic, makes it possible to account for resource-sharing. As such, it has been presented as a viable alternative to linear logic by Japaridze, who repeatedly has criticized the latter for being neither sufficiently expressive nor complete as a resource logic. This challenge, however, has remained largely unnoticed by the linear logic community, which never responded to it. Japaridze has cast a similar (and also never answered) challenge to intuitionistic logic,G. Japaridze, \\"In the beginning was game semantics\\". Games: Unifying Logic, Language and Philosophy. O. Majer, A.-V. Pietarinen and T. Tulenheimo, eds. Springer 2009, pages 249-350. criticizing it for lacking a convincing semantical justification the associated constructivistic claims, and for being incomplete as a result of \\"throwing out the baby with the bath water\\".

In \\"On the system CL12 of computability logic\\",G. Japaridze, \\"On the system CL12 of computability logic\\". Logical Methods is Computer Science (in press). on the platform of computability logic, Japaridze generalized the traditional concepts of time and space complexities to interactive computations, and introduced a third sort of a complexity measure for such computations, termed \\"amplitude complexity\\". Among Japaridze's contributions is the elaboration of a series of systems of (Peano) arithmetic based on computability logic, named \\"clarithmetics\\".G.

The return of the king and his court from exile on the Continent led to the replacement of the Puritan severity of the Cromwellian style with a taste for magnificence and opulence, and to the introduction of Dutch and French artistic influences. These are evident in furniture in the use of floral marquetry, walnut instead of oak, twisted turned supports and legs, exotic veneers, cane seats and backs on chairs, sumptuous tapestry and velvet upholstery, and ornate carved and gilded scrolling bases for cabinets. Restoration silver is characterized by embossed motifs for tulips and naturalistic fruit and leaves. New types of furniture introduced in this period include cabinets on stands, chests of drawers, armchairs and wing chairs, and day beds. The growing power of the English East India Company resulted in increased imports of exotic commodities from China and Japan, including tea, porcelain and lacquer, and chintzes from India. This led to a craze for chinoiserie, reflected in the development of imitation lacquer (Japanning), blue and white decoration on ceramics, flat- chased scenes of Chinese-style figures and landscapes on silver, and new forms of silver such as teapots, as well as colourful Indian-style crewelwork bed- hangings and curtains. Other developments in the Restoration period were the emergence of the English glass industry, following the invention of lead glass by George Ravenscroft around 1676, and the manufacture of slipware by Thomas Toft. After the accession of William III and Mary II in 1689, Restoration style was superseded by William and Mary style.

Biography It is believed that John Cobb was apprenticed in 1729 to Timothy Money (fl 1724‚Äì59), a Norwich upholsterer.>Artfact (see link below) In 1755 he married Sukey, a daughter of the cabinetmaker Giles Grendey, and is said to have acquired a ‚Äòsingularly haughty character‚Äô, strutting ‚Äòin full dress of the most superb and costly kind...through his workshops giving orders to his men‚Äô, and on one occasion earning a rebuke from George III.J T Smith in his Nollekens recounts anecdotes of his pompous behaviour and comments on his tendency to elaborate costume. He worked with William Vile from 1750 until 1765 in premises at No, 72, the corner house of St Martin's Lane & Long Acre.The London Furniture Makers 1660‚Äì1840 by Sir Ambrose Heal, p 38 ‚Äì Dover Publications () In the early 1750s, William Hallett, another cabinetmaker of the time, formed a working syndicate with Vile & Cobb.The Independent 1992 (see link below) Vile and Cobb supplied furniture to the leading patrons of the day including George III and Queen Charlotte, the 1st Earl of Leicester at Holkham Hall, the 4th Duke of Devonshire at Chatsworth and the 4th Duke of Bedford at Woburn Abbey. Vile and Cobb held the Royal Warrant from 1761 until April 1764 when Vile retired. While Vile created works in an Anglicized Rococo style, Cobb‚Äôs furniture of the 1770s was executed in an elegant Neoclassical style.Britannica Online Cobb was well known for his haughty disposition which did not always endear him to his customers, so it was no surprise that the Royal Warrant was awarded to two of their employees William France and John Bradburne instead of Cobb himself. Some of Cobb's work is in the Royal Collection at Buckingham Palace. Following Vile's retirement in 1764, Cobb carried on in business with the assistance of his foreman, Samuel Reynolds (fl 1751‚Äì85). He made furniture to very high standards and earned a reputation for exquisite marquetry: Hester Thrale, the writer and friend of Dr Johnson, compared the inlaid floors at Sceaux, France, to ‚Äòthe most high prized Cabinet which Mr Cobb can produce to captivate the Eyes of his Customers‚Äô. Inlay in tropical woods, particularly satinwood, was an important element of Neo- classical furniture. In 1772‚Äì4 Cobb produced an ‚ÄòExtra neat Inlaid Commode‚Äô and two stands en suite for Paul Methuen at Corsham Court, Wilts, which survive in situ. In 1772 he was implicated in the smuggling of furniture from France. His most extensive work was for the 6th Earl of Coventry at Croome Court, Worcs, between 1765 and 1773. This included a large mahogany wardrobe and extensive seating in the new Neo-classical style. It is recorded that he received commissions for work at a number of other houses, including Burton Hall, Lincs, Uppark, W. Sussex, Audley End, Essex, and David Garrick‚Äôs villa at Hampton, Middx. Furniture was also supplied for Strawberry Hill, home of Horace Walpole from 1760 to 1771.Description of Strawberry Hill by ToynbeeHorace Walpole in his Description of Strawberry Hill, refers to the furniture which Mr. Cobb made for the bed in the Holbein Chamber as ‚Äì 'of purple cloth lined with white satin, a plume of white and purple feathers on the centre of the tester'. After Cobb‚Äôs death in 1778, Samuel Reynolds operated in partnership with John Graham at Cobb‚Äôs address at 72 St Martin‚Äôs Lane, London, until 1785.

Ravel published an orchestral version in 1910 using two flutes, an oboe, two clarinets (in B), two bassoons, two horns, harp, and strings. The Pavane lasts between six and seven minutes and is considered a masterpiece. History Ravel described the piece as \\"an evocation of a pavane that a little princess might, in former times, have danced at the Spanish court\\". The pavane was a slow processional dance that enjoyed great popularity in the courts of Europe during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.Brown, Alan. Grove Music Online, Oxford Music Online, accessed 15 November 2011 This antique miniature is not meant to pay tribute to any particular princess from history, but rather expresses a nostalgic enthusiasm for Spanish customs and sensibilities, which Ravel shared with many of his contemporaries (most notably Debussy and Alb√©niz) and which is evident in some of his other works such as the Rapsodie espagnole and the Bol√©ro. Ravel dedicated the Pavane to his patron, the Princesse de Polignac, and he probably performed the work at the princess's home on several occasions. It was first published by Eug√®ne Demets in 1900, but it attracted little attention until the Spanish pianist Ricardo Vi√±es gave the first performance on 5 April 1902.Larner, pp. 60 and 227 The work soon became very popular, although Ravel came to think of it as \\"poor in form\\" and unduly influenced by the music of Chabrier.Simpson, p. 2 Ravel intended the piece to be played extremely slowly ‚Äì more slowly than almost any modern interpretation, according to his biographer Benjamin Ivry.Ivry, p. 23 The critic √âmile Vuillermoz complained that Ravel's playing of the work was \\"unutterably slow\\".Orenstein, p. 312 However, the composer was not impressed by interpretations that plodded. After a performance by Charles Oulmont, Ravel mentioned to him that the piece was called \\"Pavane for a dead princess\\", not \\"dead pavane for a princess\\".Oulmont quoted in Nichols, p. 84 When asked by the composer-conductor Manoah Leide-Tedesco how he arrived at the title Pavane pour une infante d√©funte, Ravel smiled coyly and replied, \\"Do not be surprised, that title has nothing to do with the composition. I simply liked the sound of those words and I put them there, c'est tout\\".Rocky Mountain News (Sunday, 8 March 1970) But Ravel also stated that the piece depicted a pavane as it would be danced by an Infanta found in a painting by Diego Vel√°zquez. When Ravel published his orchestrated version of the Pavane in 1910, he gave the lead melody to the horn, and specified a non-generic instrument: the score calls for \\"2 Cors simples en sol\\" (two hand-horns in G). The teaching of the valveless hand-horn had persisted longer in the Paris Conservatory than in other European centers; only in 1903 had the valve horn replaced it as the official horn of primary instruction. The orchestral score was published in 1910. The premiere was given on 27 February 1911 in Manchester, England, conducted by Sir Henry Wood. Reviewing the concert, the critic Samuel Langford called the work \\"most beautiful\\" and added, \\"The piece is hardly representative of the composer, with whom elusive harmonies woven in rapid figuration are the usual medium of expression. In the Pavane we get normal, almost archaic harmonies, subdued expression, and a somewhat remote beauty of melody.\\"\\"The Gentlemen's Concerts\\", The Manchester Guardian, 28 February 1911, p. 6 The first gramophone recording of the Pavane was made in 1921 in Paris. A later recording, made in Paris in 1932 is sometimes thought to have been conducted by the composer, but was actually conducted by Pedro de Freitas Branco, under the supervision of Ravel, who was present at rehearsal and the recording session.Orenstein, p. 536 Ravel himself made a piano roll recording of the piece in 1922. (His performance is approximately five minutes and forty seconds in length.) Adaptations In addition to numerous recorded performances within the classical repertoire, the Pavane maintains a significant presence in popular music. In particular, the song \\"The Lamp Is Low\\" was adapted from it.Orenstein, p. 599 More recently, the Pavane appears in dozens of popular albums under both French and English forms of its title. It was recorded by Pedro Aznar on his eponymous album (1982), in which he made use of synthesizers instead of acoustic instruments. Some unusual interpretations include another electronic versions by William Orbit in Pieces in a Modern Style (2000), Isao Tomita (1979) and the all-female synthesizer quartet Hello, Wendy! (2014). Edgar Meyer recorded a version for double bass and piano on his CD Work in Progress (1990), a solo bass guitar version by Jimmy Earl (1995), Ali Aiman's minimalist/electronic adaptation in his Overture EP (2014) and Hayley Westenra's vocal adaptation \\"Never Say Goodbye\\", which appears in her album Pure (2004).

It was fought between the Irish Republican insurgents called the United Irishmen and British Crown forces composed of regular soldiers, militia and yeomanry. The attack on the town of New Ross on the River Barrow, was an attempt by the recently victorious rebels to break out of county Wexford across the river Barrow and to spread the rebellion into county Kilkenny and the outlying province of Munster. Preparations On 4 June 1798, the rebels advanced from their camp on Carrigbyrne Hill to Corbet Hill, just outside New Ross town.Wheeler & Broadley, p.129. The battle, the bloodiest of the 1798 rebellion, began at dawnIt began at about 5 a.m. on 5 June 1798 when the Crown garrison was attacked by a force of almost 10,000 rebels, massed in three columns outside the town. The attack had been expected since the fall of Wexford town to the rebels on 30 May and the British garrison of 2,000 had prepared defences both outside and inside the town. Trenches were dug and manned by skirmishers on the approaches to the town while cannon were stationed facing all the rapidly falling approaches and narrow streets of the town to counter the expected mass charges by the rebels, who were mainly armed with pikes. Attack Bagenal Harvey, the United Irish Leader recently released from captivity following the rebel seizure of Wexford town, attempted to negotiate surrender of New Ross but the rebel emissary Matt Furlong was shot down by Crown outposts while bearing flag of truce. His death provoked a furious charge by an advance guard of 500 insurgents led by John Kelly (of ballad fame) who had instructions to seize the Three Bullet Gate and wait for reinforcements before pushing into the town. To aid their attack, the rebels first drove a herd of cattle through the gate. The Battle of Ross - illustrated by George Cruikshank (1845) The Three Bullet Gate (19th century) Another rebel column attacked the Priory Gate but the third pulled back from the Market Gate intimidated by the strong defences. Seizing the opportunity the garrison sent a force of cavalry out the Market Gate to attack and scatter the remaining two hostile columns from the flanks. However the rebel rump had not yet deployed and upon spotting the British manoeuvre, rallied the front ranks who stood and broke the cavalry charge with massed pikes. Street fighting The encouraged rebel army then swept past the Crown outposts and seized the Three Bullet Gate causing the garrison and populace to flee in panic. Without pausing for reinforcement, the rebels broke into the town attacking simultaneously down the steeply sloping streets but met with strong resistance from well-prepared second lines of defence of the well-armed soldiers. Despite horrific casualties the rebels managed to seize two-thirds of the town by using the cover of smoke from burning buildings and forced the near withdrawal of all Crown forces from the town. However, the rebels' limited supplies of gunpowder and ammunition forced them to rely on the pike and blunted their offensive. The military managed to hold on and following the arrival of reinforcements, launched a counterattack before noon which finally drove the exhausted rebels from the town. Massacres No effort to pursue the withdrawing rebels was made but when the town had been secured, a massacre of prisoners, trapped rebels and civilians of both sympathies alike began which continued for days.https://www.historyireland.com/18th-19th-century- history/the-scullabogue-massacre-1798/ Some hundreds were burned alive when rebel casualty stations were torched by victorious troops and more rebels are believed to have been killed in the aftermath of the battle than during the actual fighting. Reports of such atrocities brought by escaping rebels are believed to have influenced the retaliatory murder of over 100 loyalists in the flames of Scullabogue Barn. Aftermath Casualties in the Battle of New Ross are estimated at 2,800 to 3,000 Rebels and 200 Garrison dead. An Augustinian Friar at New Ross on 5 June 1798, the day of the Battle, entered in the Augustinian Church Mass Book the following in Latin: \\"Hodie hostis rebellis repulsa est ab obsidione oppidi cum magna caede, puta 3000\\", (\\"today, the rebel enemy was driven back from the assault of the town with great slaughter [carnage], estimated at 3000\\".)Butler, Near Restful Waters, p. 99.

Most of the dead Rebels were thrown in the River Barrow or buried in a mass grave outside the town walls, a few days after the Battle. The remaining rebel army reorganised and formed a camp at Sliabh Coillte some five miles (8 km) to the east but never attempted to attack the town again. They later attacked General John Moore's invading column but were defeated at the battle of Foulksmills on 20 June 1798.

IBM Linux Technology Center, 2010 The project's main software product is Heartbeat, a GPL-licensed portable cluster management program for high-availability clustering. Its most important features are: * no fixed maximum number of nodes - Heartbeat can be used to build large clusters as well as very simple ones * resource monitoring: resources can be automatically restarted or moved to another node on failure * fencing mechanism to remove failed nodes from the cluster * sophisticated policy-based resource management, resource inter-dependencies and constraints * time-based rules allow for different policies depending on time * several resource scripts (for Apache, DB2, Oracle, PostgreSQL etc.) included * GUI for configuring, controlling and monitoring resources and nodes  History The project originated from a mailing list started in November 1997. Eventually Harald Milz wrote an odd sort of Linux-HA HOWTO. Unlike most HOWTOs, this was not about how to configure or use existing software, it was a collection of HA techniques which one could use if one were to write HA software for Linux. Alan Robertson was inspired by this description and thought that he could perhaps write some of the software for the project to act as a sort of initial seed crystal to help jump start the project. He got this initial software running on 18 March 1998. He created the first web site for the project on 19 October 1998, and the first version of the software was released on 15 November 1998. The first production customer of the software was Rudy Pawul of ISO-NE. The ISO-NE web site went into production in the second half of 1999. At this point, the project was limited to two nodes and very simple takeover semantics, and no resource monitoring. This was cured with version 2 of the software, which added n-node clusters, resource monitoring, dependencies, and policies. Version 2.0.0 came out on 29 July 2005. This release represented another important milestone as it was the first version where very large contributions (in terms of code size) were made by the Linux-HA community at large. This series of releases brought the project to a level of feature parity-or-superiority with respect to commercial HA software. After version 2.1.4, the cluster resource manager component (responsible for starting and stopping resources and monitoring resource and node failure) was split off into a separate project called Pacemaker, and the resource agents and other \\"glue\\" infrastructure were moved to separate packages. Thus with the version 3 series, the name Heartbeat should be used for the cluster messaging layer only.

A free expansion of a gas can be achieved by moving the piston out faster than the fastest molecules in the gas. equilibrium is retained for each part but not for the whole system The Joule expansion (also called free expansion) is an irreversible process in thermodynamics in which a volume of gas is kept in one side of a thermally isolated container (via a small partition), with the other side of the container being evacuated. The partition between the two parts of the container is then opened, and the gas fills the whole container. The Joule expansion, treated as a thought experiment involving ideal gases, is a useful exercise in classical thermodynamics. It provides a convenient example for calculating changes in thermodynamic quantities, including the resulting increase in entropy of the universe (entropy production) that results from this inherently irreversible process. An actual Joule expansion experiment necessarily involves real gases; the temperature change in such a process provides a measure of intermolecular forces. This type of expansion is named after James Prescott Joule who used this expansion, in 1845, in his study for the mechanical equivalent of heat, but this expansion was known long before Joule e.g. by John Leslie, in the beginning of the 19th century, and studied by Joseph-Louis Gay-Lussac in 1807 with similar results as obtained by Joule.D.S.L. Cardwell, From Watt to Clausius, Heinemann, London (1957)M.J. Klein, Principles of the theory of heat, D. Reidel Pub.Cy., Dordrecht (1986) The Joule expansion should not be confused with the Joule‚ÄìThomson expansion or throttling process which refers to the steady flow of a gas from a region of higher pressure to one of lower pressure via a valve or porous plug. Description The process begins with gas under some pressure, P_{\\\\mathrm{i}}, at temperature T_{\\\\mathrm{i}}, confined to one half of a thermally isolated container (see the top part of the drawing at the beginning of this article). The gas occupies an initial volume V_{\\\\mathrm{i}}, mechanically separated from the other part of the container, which has a volume V_{\\\\mathrm{0}}, and is under near zero pressure. The tap (solid line) between the two halves of the container is then suddenly opened, and the gas expands to fill the entire container, which has a total volume of V_{\\\\mathrm{f}} = V_{\\\\mathrm{i}} + V_{\\\\mathrm{0}} (see the bottom part of the drawing). A thermometer inserted into the compartment on the left (not shown in the drawing) measures the temperature of the gas before and after the expansion. The system in this experiment consists of both compartments; that is, the entire region occupied by the gas at the end of the experiment. Because this system is thermally isolated, it cannot exchange heat with its surroundings. Also, since the system's total volume is kept constant, the system cannot perform work on its surroundings.Note that the fact that the gas expands in a vacuum and thus against zero pressure is irrelevant. The work done by the system would also be zero if the right hand side of the chamber were not evacuated, but is instead filled with a gas at a lower pressure. While the expanding gas would then do work against the gas in the right-hand side of the container, the whole system doesn't do any work against the environment. As a result, the change in internal energy, \\\\Delta U, is zero. Internal energy consists of internal kinetic energy (due to the motion of the molecules) and internal potential energy (due to intermolecular forces). When the molecular motion is random, temperature is the measure of the internal kinetic energy. In this case, the internal kinetic energy is called heat. If the chambers have not reached equilibrium, there will be some kinetic energy of flow, which is not detectable by a thermometer (and therefore is not a component of heat). Thus, a change in temperature indicates a change in kinetic energy, and some of this change will not appear as heat until and unless thermal equilibrium is reestablished. When heat is transferred into kinetic energy of flow, this causes a decrease in temperature.V.A. Kirillin, et al, Engineering Thermodynamics,(1981) Mir Publishers, Chapter 7.7 p.265 In practice, the simple two-chamber free expansion experiment often incorporates a 'porous plug' through which the expanding air must flow to reach the lower pressure chamber. The purpose of this plug is to inhibit directional flow, thereby quickening the reestablishment of thermal equilibrium. Since the total internal energy does not change, the stagnation of flow in the receiving chamber converts kinetic energy of flow back into random motion (heat) so that the temperature climbs to its predicted value. If the initial air temperature is low enough that non-ideal gas properties cause condensation, some internal energy is converted into latent heat (an offsetting change in potential energy) in the liquid products. Thus, at low temperatures the Joule expansion process provides information on intermolecular forces. Ideal gases If the gas is ideal, both the initial (T_{\\\\mathrm{i}}, P_{\\\\mathrm{i}}, V_{\\\\mathrm{i}}) and final (T_{\\\\mathrm{f}}, P_{\\\\mathrm{f}}, V_{\\\\mathrm{f}}) conditions follow the Ideal Gas Law, so that initially :P_{\\\\mathrm{i}} V_{\\\\mathrm{i}} = n R T_{\\\\mathrm{i}} and then, after the tap is opened, :P_{\\\\mathrm{f}} V_{\\\\mathrm{f}} = n R T_{\\\\mathrm{f}}. Here n is the number of moles of gas and R is the molar ideal gas constant. Because the internal energy does not change and the internal energy of an ideal gas is solely a function of temperature, the temperature of the gas does not change; therefore T_{\\\\mathrm{i}} = T_{\\\\mathrm{f}}. This implies that :P_{\\\\mathrm{i}} V_{\\\\mathrm{i}} = P_{\\\\mathrm{f}} V_{\\\\mathrm{f}} = n R T_{\\\\mathrm{i}}. Therefore if the volume doubles, the pressure halves. The fact that the temperature does not change makes it easy to compute the change in entropy of the universe for this process. Real gases Unlike ideal gases, the temperature of a real gas will change during a Joule expansion. Empirically, it is found that almost all gases cool during a Joule expansion at all temperatures investigated; the exceptions are helium, at temperatures above about 40 K, and hydrogen, at temperatures above about 200 K. This temperature is known as the inversion temperature of the gas. Above this temperature gas heats up during Joule expansion. Since internal energy is constant, cooling must be due to the conversion of internal kinetic energy to internal potential energy, with the opposite being the case for warming. Intermolecular forces are repulsive at short range and attractive at long range (for example, see the Lennard-Jones potential). Since distances between gas molecules are large compared to molecular diameters, the energy of a gas is usually influenced mainly by the attractive part of the potential. As a result, expanding a gas usually increases the potential energy associated with intermolecular forces. Some textbooks say that for gases this must always be the case and that a Joule expansion must always produce cooling.Pippard, A. B. (1957). Elements of Classical Thermodynamics, p. 73. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, U.K.Tabor, D. (1991). Gases, liquids and solids, p. 148. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, U.K. . In liquids, where molecules are close together, repulsive interactions are much more important and it is possible to get an increase in temperature during a Joule expansion.Keenan, J. H. (1970). Thermodynamics, p. 414. M.I.T. Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts. It is theoretically predicted that, at sufficiently high temperature, all gases will warm during a Joule expansion The reason is that at any moment, a very small number of molecules will be undergoing collisions; for those few molecules, repulsive forces will dominate and the potential energy will be positive. As the temperature rises, both the frequency of collisions and the energy involved in the collisions increase, so the positive potential energy associated with collisions increases strongly. If the temperature is high enough, that can make the total potential energy positive, in spite of the much larger number of molecules experiencing weak attractive interactions. When the potential energy is positive, a constant energy expansion reduces potential energy and increases kinetic energy, resulting in an increase in temperature. This behavior has only been observed for hydrogen and helium; which have very weak attractive interactions. For other gases this \\"Joule inversion temperature\\" appears to be extremely high. Entropy production Entropy is a function of state, and therefore the entropy change can be computed directly from the knowledge of the final and initial equilibrium states. For an ideal gas, the change in entropyTipler, P., and Mosca, G. Physics for Scientists and Engineers (with modern physics), 6th edition, 2008. pages 602 and 647. is the same as for isothermal expansion where all heat is converted to work: :\\\\Delta S = \\\\int_i^f dS = \\\\int_{V_i}^{V_f} \\\\frac{P\\\\,dV}{T} = \\\\int_{V_i}^{V_f} \\\\frac{n R\\\\,dV}{V} = n R \\\\ln \\\\frac{V_f}{V_i}. For an ideal monatomic gas, the entropy as a function of the internal energy U, volume V, and number of moles n is given by the Sackur‚ÄìTetrode equation:K. Huang, Introduction to Statistical Physics, Taylor and Francis, London, 2001 : S = nR \\\\ln \\\\left[\\\\left(\\\\frac VN\\\\right) \\\\left(\\\\frac{4\\\\pi m}{3h^2}\\\\frac UN \\\\right)^{\\\\frac 32}\\\\right]+ {\\\\frac 52}nR. In this expression m is the particle mass and h Planck's constant. For a monatomic ideal gas U = (3/2)nRT = nCVT, with CV the molar heat capacity at constant volume. In terms of classical thermodynamics the entropy of an ideal gas is given by : S(V,T)=S_0+nR\\\\ln\\\\left(\\\\frac{V}{V_0}\\\\right)+nC_V\\\\ln\\\\left(\\\\frac{T}{T_0}\\\\right) where S0 is the, arbitrary chosen, value of the entropy at volume V0 and temperature T0.M.W. Zemansky, Heat and Thermodynamics, McGraw-Hill Pub.Cy. New York (1951), page 177. It is seen that a doubling of the volume at constant U or T leads to an entropy increase of ŒîS = nR ln(2). This result is also valid if the gas is not monatomic, as the volume dependence of the entropy is the same for all ideal gases. A second way to evaluate the entropy change is to choose a route from the initial state to the final state where all the intermediate states are in equilibrium. Such a route can only be realized in the limit where the changes happen infinitely slowly. Such routes are also referred to as quasistatic routes. In some books one demands that a quasistatic route has to be reversible, here we don't add this extra condition. The net entropy change from the initial state to the final state is independent of the particular choice of the quasistatic route, as the entropy is a function of state. Here is how we can effect the quasistatic route. Instead of letting the gas undergo a free expansion in which the volume is doubled, a free expansion is allowed in which the volume expands by a very small amount Œ¥V. After thermal equilibrium is reached, we then let the gas undergo another free expansion by Œ¥V and wait until thermal equilibrium is reached. We repeat this until the volume has been doubled. In the limit Œ¥V to zero, this becomes an ideal quasistatic process, albeit an irreversible one. Now, according to the fundamental thermodynamic relation, we have: :\\\\mathrm{d}U = T \\\\mathrm{d}S - P \\\\mathrm{d}V. As this equation relates changes in thermodynamic state variables, it is valid for any quasistatic change, regardless of whether it is irreversible or reversible. For the above defined path we have that dU = 0 and thus TdS=PdV, and hence the increase in entropy for the Joule expansion is :\\\\Delta S=\\\\int_i^f\\\\mathrm{d}S=\\\\int_{V_{0}}^{2V_{0}} \\\\frac{P\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}V}{T}=\\\\int_{V_0}^{2V_0} \\\\frac{n R\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}V}{V}=n R\\\\ln 2. A third way to compute the entropy change involves a route consisting of reversible adiabatic expansion followed by heating. We first let the system undergo a reversible adiabatic expansion in which the volume is doubled. During the expansion, the system performs work and the gas temperature goes down, so we have to supply heat to the system equal to the work performed to bring it to the same final state as in case of Joule expansion. During the reversible adiabatic expansion, we have dS = 0. From the classical expression for the entropy it can be derived that the temperature after the doubling of the volume at constant entropy is given as: :T = T_i2^{-R/C_V} = T_i2^{-2/3} for the monatomic ideal gas. Heating the gas up to the initial temperature Ti increases the entropy by the amount :\\\\Delta S = n\\\\int_{T}^{T_i}C_{V}\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}T'}{T'}= nR \\\\ln 2. We might ask what the work would be if, once the Joule expansion has occurred, the gas is put back into the left-hand side by compressing it. The best method (i.e. the method involving the least work) is that of a reversible isothermal compression, which would take work W given by :W=-\\\\int_{2V_0}^{V_0} P\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}V =- \\\\int_{2V_0}^{V_0} \\\\frac{nRT}{V} \\\\mathrm{d}V=nRT\\\\ln 2=T\\\\Delta S_{gas}. During the Joule expansion the surroundings do not change, so the entropy of the surroundings is constant. So the entropy change of the so-called \\"universe\\" is equal to the entropy change of the gas which is nR ln 2. Real-gas effect Joule performed his experiment with air at room temperature which was expanded from a pressure of about 22 bar. Air, under these conditions, is almost an ideal gas, but not quite. As a result the real temperature change will not be exactly zero. With our present knowledge of the thermodynamic properties of air Refprop, software package developed by National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) we can calculate that the temperature of the air should drop by about 3 degrees Celsius when the volume is doubled under adiabatic conditions. However, due to the low heat capacity of the air and the high heat capacity of the strong copper containers and the water of the calorimeter, the observed temperature drop is much smaller, so Joule found that the temperature change was zero within his measuring accuracy.

It was designed as a profit making venture, independent of as much government control as possible, in an attempt to maneuver around some of the limitations of legislation governing public universities. It was the brainchild of former Vice-Chancellor Alan Gilbert. It also allowed the public university to operate a management model and mission more akin to private market-driven universities in the USA (like the University of Phoenix). MUP's main potential markets were businesspeople and students of languages and international development, both in Australia and overseas. Facilities A new area of buildings was built immediately south of the main University of Melbourne campus, and one was earmarked for MUP. Controversially, this development involved the removal of old terrace houses and a lawn bowls club. However the upset was placated somewhat by the restoration of other buildings and the creation of a new public square. Despite the strong efforts of its parent, MUP's early life was less than successful, and it was downgraded to operating from the Hawthorn Language Centre in a Melbourne suburb. The multimillion-dollar building in which MUP maintained a small office was soon taken over by the public university, and named the \\"Alan Gilbert Building\\". Distance learning A major part of MUP's work was to produce curriculum for distance education courses to be delivered through the Universitas 21 (U21) platform, and latterly in its own right. The distance education platform U21Global struggled to attract interest, and demand for its courses fell well below expectations. U21Global was ultimately sold to a private operator, with heavy losses. The situation was made worse when the federal government changed its rules, allowing public universities to offer full fee paying courses to a broader range of people. This was also a time when more Australian universities started opening overseas campuses and otherwise delivering their courses offshore, as well as more actively bringing foreign students to Australia. Re-accreditation MUP attracted the scrutiny of the Labor state government in 2001, but was subsequently re-accredited in 2003, with targets to increase research performance. However, its future dimmed when Alan Gilbert accepted a position at the University of Manchester in England in 2003. His successor, Glyn Davis, proved to be much more centrist, and was not fond of the private entity. John Cain, former Premier of Victoria, was one of MUP's most vocal critics, and his book Off Course pointed to shortcomings of MUP. Closing On June 7, 2005, only months into his term, Glyn Davis announced that Melbourne University Private would close. Some of it, including the School of Enterprise, was merged with the University of Melbourne and continues to function, but the Hawthorn English Language Centre remained a separate entity. Other parts, including the international projects arm, were sold. The Chief Executive officer, David Lloyd, resigned at the time of the press announcement. Alan Gilbert declined to comment on the decision of his successor. Over its eight-year life, the university lost A$20 million, although this is believed to be a conservative estimate given the pre-startup investment costs, which Cain and other critics put as high as A$150 million. At the announcement of its closure, the private university had 600 fee-paying students, a growing number but less than targeted (2500 were hoped to be enrolled in 2008).

His father was a draper. Educated locally at St. Grellan's Boys' National School and St. Joseph's College, Garbally Park, some of his earliest work was published in The Fountain, the Garbally college annual. After leaving school, Hogan travelled to France, ending up in Paris just after the student riots of 1968. He later studied at University College Dublin (UCD), where he received a BA in 1972 and an MA in 1973. In 1971 he won the Hennessy Award. The Irish Writers' Co-operative, formed by writer Fred Johnston, Neil Jordan and playwright Peter Sheridan at a meeting in a Dublin restaurant, were to publish Hogan's The Ikon Maker, which was also the Co-op's first publication. While in Dublin, he worked as a street actor and had a number of plays ‚Äì A Short Walk to the Sea, Sanctified Distances, and The Squat ‚Äì produced in the Abbey Theatre and the Project Arts Centre. RT√â and BBC Radio broadcast some of his plays, including Jimmy. He also published stories in small magazines such as Adam and the Transatlantic Review. Later he moved to London, living in Tooting, Catford and Hounslow and then later as a lodger in the Hampstead home of Anthony Farrell, a young Irish publisher. Friends and acquaintances from this period included: writer Jaci Stephen, biographer Patrick Newley, Kazuo Ishiguro and his partner, Lorna. Hogan also participated in poetry and literature readings held at Bernard Stone's Turrett Bookshop on Floral Street in Covent Garden. His debut novel, The Ikon-Maker, was written in 1974 and published in 1976. It deals with a mother's unwilling recognition of her son's homosexuality. In 1977, he was the recipient of the Rooney Prize for Irish Literature, though this event remained undiscovered in America for several years until the Pittsburgh Press reported the revelation to its readers in 1981. In 1978, he participated in the Santa Cruz Writers Conference. In the early 1980s, Hogan was represented by Deborah Rogers' literary agency, which also had Peter Carey, Bruce Chatwin, Ian McEwan and Salman Rushdie on its books. In 1980, he won the John Llewellyn Rhys Prize for his Diamonds at the Bottom of the Sea collection of short stories. In 1981, he appeared in Granta. In 1989, Hogan left London and was a Hudson Strode Fellow at the University of Alabama. In 1991, Hogan was awarded a place on the DAAD (German Academic Exchange) Berlin Artists' Programme fellowship which enabled him to live in that city. It was in Berlin that he fell in love with Sammy, who has since died, with Hogan moving on to Prague, griefstricken, where he wrote his book Farewell to Prague. Hogan returned to Ireland in 1995, living in Clifden, County Galway. For a period, he lived in an old caravan in County Limerick along North Kerry/West Limerick border. In 1997, he lectured in short fiction at the University of California, San Diego. He was a judge in the 2005 Frank O'Connor International Short Story Award, worth ‚Ç¨50,000. Interested in history, painting, traveller culture, he has used a typewriter since he was a child and finds the modern transition to computers difficult. Suspicious of the telephone, he prefers to communicate using postcards. Sexual assault Hogan was convicted of sexually assaulting a 15-year-old boy. The assault happened on 11 November 2006 in a house Hogan was renting. He was given a two- year suspended jail sentence, placed on the sex offenders register, and ordered not to have unsupervised contact with children. The judge, Carroll Moran, made the judgement that Hogan had a \\"moderate to low\\" level chance of re-offending. However, Hogan's parole officer, Nora Brassil, stated in an earlier hearing that Hogan saw the assault as \\"a mutual sexual incident/ relationship\\". She was concerned that if Hogan did not see what he had done as wrong, he might re-offend. Readings * 1970s: Participated in readings in The Sarsfield Bar, Rutland Street. Limerick.

An aide to General Ulysses S. Grant during and after the war, he was President Grant's private secretary at the White House, Superintendent of Buildings and Grounds for Washington D.C., and a Florida-based federal inspector of lighthouses. Babcock continued to serve as lighthouse inspector under Grant's successors Rutherford B. Hayes, James A. Garfield, and Chester A Arthur. A native of Vermont, Babcock graduated third in his class at West Point in 1861, and served in the United States Army Corps of Engineers throughout the Civil War. As Assistant Engineer and aide-de-camp for district commander Nathaniel P. Banks, in 1862 Babcock worked on fortifications to aid in defending the nation's capitol from Confederate attack. Babcock later served as aide-de-camp for Ulysses S. Grant and participated in the Overland Campaign. He was promoted to brevet brigadier general in 1865 and continued on Grant's staff during Reconstruction. In 1867, Babcock warned Grant of a white supremacist insurgency that used Confederate symbolism to intimidate blacks in the South. After Grant became President in 1869, Babcock was assigned Grant's Secretary to the President of the United States‚Äîin modern terms, the chief of staff‚Äîand he served until his departure from the White House in 1876. Young and ambitious, critics considered Babcock the Iago of the Grant administration. He remained on the Army rolls during his service in the White House, which limited the ability of Congress to oversee or influence his activities. This circumstance became an issue when he was accused of crimes while in office. In addition to his position in the White House, Grant appointed Babcock Superintendent of Public Buildings and Grounds for Washington, DC. In 1869, Grant sent him on a mission to explore the possibility of annexing the island nation of Santo Domingo to the United States, but the Senate, led by Charles Sumner, rejected the proposal. Babcock's tenure under Grant was controversial. He was criminally indicted twice over corruption charges. Grant shielded Babcock from political attack out of a loyalty bond that stemmed primarily from their shared battle experiences during the Civil War. After Babcock was indicted as a member of the Whiskey Ring in 1875, Grant provided a written deposition on Babcock's behalf‚Äîa first for a sitting president‚Äîwhich was admitted at Babcock's 1876 trial, and resulted in his acquittal. Upon his return from St. Louis, Grant gave in to pressure from Secretary of State Hamilton Fish and forced Babcock to leave the White House. A second indictment, in 1876, over the Safe Burglary Conspiracy, ended in an acquittal, but further alienated Babcock from Republicans who favored government reform, while public opinion turned against him. Despite dismissing him from the White House, Grant did not desert his wartime comrade; in February 1877, he appointed Babcock Inspector of Lighthouses for the Federal Lighthouse Board's Fifth District, a low-profile post that did not attract undue public attention. In 1882, President Chester A. Arthur additionally appointed Babcock as Inspector of Lighthouses for the Sixth District. Babcock was the chief engineer overseeing plans for the construction of the Mosquito Inlet Lighthouse. He died on duty in 1884 when he drowned off Mosquito Inlet in Daytona Beach, Florida. Babcock's historical reputation is mixed; his technical engineering expertise, efficiency, bravery in battle, and Union loyalty were offset by his involvement in corruption, deception, and scandal. Contrary to most of his contemporaries, Babcock also held no racial animosity, which played a part in his advocacy of Grant's plan to annex Santo Domingo. Early life  Orville E. Babcock was born on December 25, 1835 in Franklin, Vermont, a small town located near the Canada‚ÄìUS border close to Lake Champlain. Babcock's father was Elias Babcock Jr. and his mother was Clara Olmsted.Dictionary of American Biography (1928), Babcock, Orville E., p. 460 While growing up, he received a common education in the schools of Berkshire, Vermont. At the age of 16, Babcock was appointed to the West Point Military Academy (USMA), where he graduated third in a class of 45 on May 6, 1861. His high class ranking enabled Babcock to select his branch, and he chose the Engineers, as did most top graduates of his era. Civil War (1861‚Äì1865) =Constructed Washington D.C. defense works The American Civil War was beginning as Babcock was graduating; he was commissioned as a Brevet Second Lieutenant in the Corps of Engineers, and assigned to duty as an Assistant Engineer for the military district that included Washington. His first mission was the undertaking of efforts to improve the defensive works of Washington, D.C. and protect the city from attack. On July 13, 1861, Babcock was assigned to the Department of Pennsylvania. In August, he received his commission as a second lieutenant, to date from his West Point graduation in May; he was assigned to the Department of the Shenandoah, and constructed military fortifications on the Potomac River and in the Shenandoah Valley while also serving as aide-de-camp under Major General Nathaniel P. Banks. From August through November, Babcock worked again on improving the fortifications surrounding Washington, responding to increased apprehension the Union capital was vulnerable to attack and capture by the Confederate Army. Peninsula campaign Orville E. Babcock (left) and Orlando M. Poe (right), Union Engineers in Ft. Sander's salient. Photograph by Barnard, 1863‚Äì1864. On November 17, 1861, Babcock was promoted to First Lieutenant, Corps of Engineers, and a week later was assigned to the Army of the Potomac. During the months of February and March, 1862, while General Banks moved to Winchester, Virginia, Babcock set up military fortifications at Harper's Ferry and guarded pontoon bridges crossing the Potomac River. During the Peninsula Campaign, Babcock served bravely at the Siege of Yorktown with the Army of the Potomac's Engineer Battalion and was brevetted as a captain to rank from May 4, 1862. For the next seven months, Babcock built bridges, roads, and field works. For his service, in November, 1862, Babcock was promoted to Chief Engineer of the Left Grand Division of the Army of the Potomac. In December 1862, during the Battle of Fredericksburg, Babcock served on Brigadier General William B. Franklin's engineering staff. Vicksburg, Blue Springs, Campbell's Station On January 1, 1863, Babcock was promoted to permanent captain and brevet lieutenant colonel, and was named the Assistant Inspector General of the VI Corps until February 6, when he was named the Assistant Inspector General and Chief Engineer of the IX Corps. As Chief Engineer of the IX Corps, Babcock surveyed and projected the defensive fortifications at Louisville and Central Kentucky. Moving westward to help secure the Mississippi River from Confederate control and divide the Confederacy in two, Babcock fought with the IX Corps at the Battle of Vicksburg and the Battle of Blue Springs, and the Battle of Campbell's Station. Knoxville campaign Battle of Fort Sanders Babcock was part of XXIII Corps, and served under Union engineer Captain Orlando M. Poe. Poe and Union engineers, that included Babcock, built several fortifications in the form of bastioned earthworks near Knoxville. One was Fort Sanders, just west of downtown Knoxville across a creek valley. It was named for Brig. Gen. William P. Sanders, mortally wounded in a skirmish outside Knoxville on November 18, 1863. The fort, had an innovative design, and was a salient in the line of earthworks that surrounded three sides of the city, rose above the surrounding plateau and was protected by a ditch wide and deep. An almost insurmountable vertical wall rose above the ditch, slippery and frozen. Inside the fort were 12 cannons and 440 men of the 79th New York Infantry. In front of the ditch, telegraph wires were strung at knee height across tree stumps, possibly the first use of such wire entanglements in the Civil War, to entangle Confederate soldiers that would assault the Fort. The Battle of Fort Sanders was brutal by 19th Century standards. The Confederates moved to within 120-150 yards of the salient during the night of freezing rain and snow and waited for the order to attack. Entangled by the telegraph wire, Confederate soldiers were shot by Union soldiers atop the wall. After crossing the ditch, the Confederates were unable to dig footholds, men climbed upon each other's shoulders to attempt to reach the top of the wall. Union soldiers rained fire into the assault, including musketry, canister, and artillery shells thrown as hand grenades. A succession of color bearers was shot down as they planted their flags on the fort. For a brief time, three flags reached the top, those of the 16th Georgia, 13th Mississippi, and 17th Mississippi. After 40 minutes of battle, the Confederates broke and retreated. The battle ended in a lopsided Union victory. After fighting in the Knoxville Campaign, at the Battle of Fort Sanders, Babcock became the Chief Engineer of the Department of the Ohio and was promoted to brevet major on November 29, 1863. Overland Campaign Lieut. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant and Staff: Ulysses S. Grant (at center table), Orville E. Babcock (right) Babcock was promoted to lieutenant colonel in the regular army on March 29, 1864 and became the aide-de-camp to Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant participating in Overland Campaign against General Robert E. Lee and the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia. Babcock served in the Battle of the Wilderness, the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House, and the Battle of Cold Harbor. For his gallant service at the Battle of the Wilderness, Babcock was appointed brevet lieutenant colonel, U.S. Volunteers, to rank from May 6, 1864. On August 9, 1864, Babcock, while stationed at Union headquarters in City Point, was wounded in the hand after Confederate spies had blown up an ammunition barge moored below the city's bluffs.Catton (1969), p. 349. As Grant's aide-de-camp, Babcock ran dispatches between Grant and Major General William T. Sherman during Sherman's March to the Sea campaign. Appomattox: Lee surrenders to Grant Robert E. Lee surrender to Ulysses S. Grant at the McLean House on April 9, 1865 On April 9, 1865 after being defeated at the Battle of Appomattox, Commanding Confederate General Robert E. Lee formally surrendered his Army of Northern Virginia to Ulysses S. Grant. Babcock personally chose the site of surrender at the McLean House, personally escorted Lee to the meeting, and witnessed Grant and Lee discussing and signing the surrender terms. For his meritorious contributions in the Civil War, Babcock was appointed brevet colonel, to rank from March 13, 1865. On July 17, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Babcock for brevet brigadier general in the regular army, to rank from March 13, 1865, and the United States Senate confirmed the appointment on July 23, 1866.Eicher, 2001, p. 732. Reconstruction=Final promotions, marriage, and family Orville E. Babcock's house in Washington D.C. After the War, Babcock remained on Grant's staff throughout America's turbulent Reconstruction Period. On July 25, 1866, Babcock was commissioned colonel of volunteers and aide-de-camp for the General-in-Chief of the Army, Ulysses S. Grant. On March 21, 1867 Babcock received a Regular Army commission as a major in the Corps of Engineers. On November 6, 1866, Babcock married Anne Eliza Cambell in Galena, Illinois. Their marriage produced four children: Campbell E. Babcock, Orville E. Babcock, Jr., Adolph B. Babcock, and Benjamin Babcock. Benjamin died during infancy.Inventory of the Orville E. Babcock Papers (2008) Babcock moved to Washington D.C. to serve as Grant's military aide, and remained to serve in the White House after Grant became president. Reported on South (1867) In mid-April, Grant dispatched Babcock and Horace Porter, another member of his staff, to report on the progress of Southern Reconstruction. Babcock and Porter were optimistic on the plight of blacks who had embraced citizenship saying the \\"negro is learning very fast. They will soon be the best educated class in the South, if they continue at their present rate of progress.\\" However, Babcock discovered and informed Grant of a white supremacist insurgency using Confederate symbolism that was developing to intimidate African Americans, saying that in Georgia the \\"police in most of the cities are in a grey uniform, the real confederate uniform.\\" President Grant's personal secretary (1869‚Äì1876) In 1868, Ulysses S. Grant was elected the 18th President of the United States. In 1869, the 33 year old Babcock was militarily assigned, rather than publicly appointed, Grant's personal secretary. Grant also had three other personal secretaries, Frederick Dent (Grant's brother in law), Horace Porter, and Robert M. Douglas. As one of a few men who had daily access to Grant in the White House, and one who had been close to Grant during the war, Babcock had unprecedented power and influence, entrusted by Grant, which extended directly and indirectly into many agencies and departments. His influence was so great that when cabinet positions and other appointments became available, Grant often acted on Babcock's recommendations.Woodward (1957), The Lowest Ebb Suspected of using that influence for his own ends, Babcock was often at odds with reformers and opponents of corruption, including Secretary of State Hamilton Fish and Secretary of the Treasury Benjamin Bristow, who both desired to save Grant's and administration and reputation from scandal. While Grant admired Babcock for his Civil War service, Babcock's relative youth and ambitious nature led Grant's critics to consider him the Iago of the Grant administration. Gatekeeper to Grant While serving in the White House, Babcock retained his position in the U.S. Army, an arrangement made between Grant and his successor as head of the Army, William T. Sherman. Babcock did not require Senate confirmation for his appointment and retained his military salary, which made it difficult for Congress to exercise oversight when Babcock became the subject of controversy and scandal. Babcock's duties included involvement in patronage matters, finding negative information on critics of the Grant administration, and feeding political stories to pro-Grant newspapers. Babcock's White House office was in a second floor anteroom that led to President Grant's private office. In order to see Grant, visitors had to go through Babcock, a circumstance that caused many to resent Babcock's insider role, and created a negative perception among contemporaries that overrode Babcock's positive attributes. Babcock also opened and answered most of Grant's personal letters, and historian Allan Nevins argued that Babcock's position was as at least as important as the Cabinet secretaries, and more powerful than most. Santo Domingo annexation Santo Domingo City 1871 In 1869 Babcock was Grant's special agent in an attempt to annex the mostly mixed race and black, Spanish-speaking Caribbean island country of the Dominican Republic (18,655 mi¬≤), then commonly called Santo Domingo. At this time, federal land speculation was not uncommon, as Congress had in March 1867 purchased Alaska (663,300 mi¬≤) from the Russian Empire. Like his predecessor Andrew Johnson, Grant received inducements from speculators interested in Caribbean expansion, particularly for Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Speculators William L. Cazneau and Joseph W. Fabens formed the Santo Domingo Company in New York to attract financial supporters for annexing the Dominican Republic. Grant's Secretary of State Hamilton Fish, was doubtful concerning Haitian annexation, believing the country was politically unstable, and became suspicious when Fabens asked him to support a plan of American annexation of the Dominican Republic. Grant desired to investigate the island and find out whether the people wanted annexation. After two other candidates were excluded, Grant and Fish agreed to send Babcock on a secret reconnaissance mission to the Dominican Republic. Babcock had minimal qualifications for the job; he was not fluent in Spanish and did not have extensive knowledge of the West Indies. Babcock's official instructions, signed by Fish, were to gather knowledge of the people and the culture. In addition, he was to investigate the nation's agriculture and mineral wealth, as well as determine whether the government was stable and whether the people desired annexation. He was also instructed to find out about the country's economy, including the interest rate on the national debt and the strength of the Dominican currency. Grant also gave Babcock verbal orders to find out the terms by which the Dominican government would accept annexation, although Fish did not authorize Babcock to formally negotiate an agreement. =Visited island= President B√°ez Babcock boarded the steamship Tybee in New York and departed for the Dominican Republic on July 17, 1869. He was accompanied by Fabens and annexation supporter California Republican Senator Cornelius Cole. On the voyage the Tybee stopped at Saman√° Bay and observed there was a \\"splendid coal station\\" on an island. The indigenous people were upset over a recent raid by the rebel warship Tel√©grafo. Noting the soil to be fertile, Babcock believed the Dominican Republic could feed 4 million people. Babcock, however, said the people of the Dominican Republic were \\"indolent and ignorant.\\" Babcock's view, however, of the mixed race black people, did not impede his vision of Santo Domingo's inclusion by the United States. Babcock was a Reconstruction man, who was \\"nicely color-blind\\" to opportunism, in the post Civil War world. Babcock's next visited Santo Domingo City, but found that President Buenaventura B√°ez was not there. Babcock was entertained by Cazneau and his wife at their plantation house. After his stay in Santo Domingo City, Babcock reboarded the Tybee and voyaged to Azua, 60 miles away, where President B√°ez was staying. Babcock recorded that B√°ez was in favor of friendly relations with the United States. Nothing, however, was talked about annexation, until Babcock and B√°ez returned to Santo Domingo City. =Treaty negotiations= Without any diplomatic authorization, Babcock entered negotiations with B√°ez for annexation on August 7, with Cazneau serving as Babcock's interpreter. Babcock was informed of a large loan with unfavorable terms that the Dominican government had taken from financier Edward Herzberg Hartmont. With annexation, the United States would be burdened by this loan, meaning this debt could hinder ratification in the Senate. Babcock believed the loan was a backhanded way by the British to take over the Dominican Gulf, presuming the Dominican government failed to pay it back. Babcock and B√°ez began significant negotiations in the second week of August, and asked Cazneau and Fabens for assistance. Babcock told B√°ez he was a representative of President Grant, and he was called to Dominican Republic to discuss a union of the two republics. B√°ez said he believed annexation would stabilize his country that he believed had gone backwards and asked Babcock to draw up a written plan for annexation. By September 1869, Babcock and Cazneau drew up plans for annexation and submitted them to B√°ez, who generally approved. According to the drafts, Saman√° Bay would be sold to the United States for $2 million or the whole country would be annexed to the United States after the U.S. paid off the Dominican Republic's national debt of $1.5 million. B√°ez told Babcock that before returning to Santo Domingo with a formal treaty, he should be assured by a sufficient number of Senators that they would ratify it. Babcock replied that President Grant, \\"would not enter into any treaty without weighing the matter well, and feeling assured that it would be approved.\\" Babcock was a supporter of Congressional Reconstruction, and he saw Santo Domingo, not as a nation of blacks, but as a source of new opportunities in a post war world. Babcock asked B√°ez to put in writing an annexation proposal he could transmit to Grant. After B√°ez agreed to do so, Gautier prepared a formal memorandum to be sent back to Washington. President Grant Brady 1870 When Babcock returned to the White House with a draft a treaty, Fish and Secretary of Interior Jacob D. Cox were alarmed, since Babcock had no official standing. Fish told Cox \\"Babcock is back...I pledge you my word he had no more diplomatic authority than any other casual visitor to the island.\\" At the next cabinet meeting Babcock was there in person and Grant told his silenced cabinet that Babcock was back and that he (Grant) approved of the treaty. Cox spoke up and said, \\"But Mr. President, has it been settled, then, that we want to annex Santo Domingo ?\\" Grant was embarrassed and began puffing on his cigar, while the other cabinet members said nothing, Cox's question remained unanswered. Fish threatened to resign over the matter, but Grant convinced him to stay on the administration, telling Fish he would not go around him again and he needed Fish's guidance and support. Fish agreed to remain on the cabinet, although he hoped Grant would drop the Santo Domingo annexation treaty. Grant did not drop the treaty, believing annexation would help alleviate violent suppression of African Americans in the Southern states by providing in Santo Domingo a place where they could live and work undisturbed. Fish sent Babcock back to the Dominican Republic on November 18, accompanied by Major General Rufus Ingalls, a high-ranking Quartermaster officer. This time, Babcock had official State Department status and instructions to draw up two formal treaties, which were signed on November 29, 1869. Grant, however, kept the treaties secret from Congress and the public, until mid-January 1870. After earnest public discussion, the treaties was formerly submitted to Congress in March, whereupon Senators joined in the debate. =Failed to pass Senate= Senator Charles Sumner strongly opposed the annexation treaties objecting to Babcock's secret negotiations, his use of naval power, and desiring to keep Santo Domingo an autonomous African American nation rather than annexation and potential statehood as Grant had proposed. The people of Santo Domingo overwhelmingly desired annexation voting 15,169 to 11 in its favor, according to a plebiscite held by B√°ez. Senate Republicans led by Sumner split the party over the treaty while Senators loyal to Grant supported the treaty and admonished Babcock. The treaties however failed to pass the Senate causing continued bitterness and hostility between Grant and Sumner, both stubbornly trying to control the Republican Party. Although Babcock was suspected of being given investment land on Saman√° Bay, a Congressional investigation found no conclusive evidence that Babcock would financially gain from the country's annexation. Babcock in the minority report was criticized for acquiescing in the imprisonment of Davis Hatch, an American abroad, who was an open critic of B√°ez. CorruptionGold corner (1869)= Black Friday September 24, 1869 In 1869, Babcock invested money in Jay Cooke & Company's Gold Ring, a scam by wealthy New York tycoons Jay Gould and James Fisk to profit by cornering the market on gold. Starting in late April, Secretary of the Treasury George S. Boutwell had regulated the price of gold by monthly sales from the Treasury in exchange for greenbacks. As part of the Gold Ring's effort, Gould convinced Grant not to increase the Treasury's September gold sale, helping make it scarce and inflating the price. Gould and Fisk then set up a buying operation, the New York Gold Room, where traders in their employ purchased as much gold as they could acquire, which artificially drove up the price. When Grant became aware of the full extent of the attempt to corner the market in late September 1869, he ordered the release of $4,500,000 in Treasury gold, which caused the price to collapse. Gould and Fisk were thwarted, but at the expense of a decline in the stock market and the overall economy. Babcock and other individuals who secretly invested with him lost $40,000 (about $750,000 in 2018). To satisfy his creditors, Babcock had to sign a trust deed on his property, which named Asa Bird Gardiner as trustee. The extent of Babcock's involvement was not revealed to Grant until 1876, when his complicity in the Gold Ring was uncovered during the investigation of his involvement in the Whiskey Ring.Simon The Papers of Ulysses S. Grant: January 1-October 31, 1876, pages 47, 48 = Whiskey Ring (1875-1876) = Thomas Nast cartoon depicting the Whiskey Ring, published in Harper's Weekly (March, 1876) Dating back to the Presidency of Abraham Lincoln it was common for distillers and corrupt Internal Revenue agents to make false whiskey production reports and pocket unpaid tax revenue. However, during the early 1870s, the corruption became more organized by distillers, who used the illegally obtained money for bribery and illegal election financing, to the point where every agent in St. Louis was involved in corruption. This organized network, known as the Whiskey Ring, extended nationally and involved \\"the printing, selling, and approving of forged federal revenue stamps on bottled whiskey.\\"Fredman (1987), The Presidential Follies In June 1874, President Grant appointed Benjamin Bristow as Secretary of Treasury, with authority to investigate the Whiskey Ring and prosecute wrongdoers. Bristow, a Kentuckian and Union Army veteran, was known for his honesty and integrity, and had served as the nation's first Solicitor General, also appointed by Grant. Bristow immediately discovered whiskey tax evasion among distillers and corrupt officials in the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Bureau. Bristow and Bluford Wilson, the Treasury Solicitor obtained Grant's permission to use secret agents appointed from outside the Treasury Department; as a result of the evidence they obtained, on May 10, 1875 Treasury Department agents raided and shut down corrupt distilleries in St. Louis, Chicago, and Milwaukee, seizing company financial records and other files. Bristow then prosecuted the offenders by working with Grant's newly appointed Attorney General, Edwards Pierrepont, a popular New York reformer who had been involved in shutting down New York City's corrupt Tweed Ring. Information was soon discovered that Babcock was informing ring leader John McDonald in St. Louis of inspections by Bristow's agents, giving them time to hide incriminating evidence before agents arrived. Bristow believed Babcock received cash in exchange for this information, in one instance two five-hundred-dollar bills hidden inside a cigar box. McDonald was indicted in June, when Bristow obtained indictments against 350 distillers and government officials. In July 1875, Bristow and Pierrepont met Grant, who was vacationing at Long Branch, and gave him evidence that Babcock was a member of the ring. Grant told Pierrepont \\"Let no guilty man escape...\\" and said if Babcock was guilty then it was the \\"greatest piece of traitorism to me that a man could possibly practice.\\" In October, Babcock was summoned in front of Grant, Bristow, and Pierrepont at the White House to explain two ambiguous telegrams hand written by Babcock and signed \\"Sylph\\", an apparent code name for Babcock. The first message said, \\"I have succeeded. They will not go. I will write you.\\" (December 10, 1874) and the second one said, \\"We have official information that the enemy weakens. Push things.\\" (February 3, 1875) Bristow had shown these messages to Grant at a cabinet meeting the same day. Babcock said something to Grant, unintelligible to Bristow and Pierrepont, and Grant appeared satisfied by Babcock's interpretation of the telegrams. Pierrepont and Bristow, believing the matter to be crucial, insisted Babcock send a message to his telegraphic correspondent demanding that this individual come to Washington to give his version of the messages. After Babcock seemed to be taking too long, Pierrepont went to check on him and found Babcock writing a warning to revenue agent John A. Joyce, his St. Louis confederate, to be on his guard. Infuriated, Pierrepont grabbed Babcock's pen and dashed through his message yelling \\"You don't want to send your argument; send the fact, and go there and make your explanation. I do not understand it.\\" Grant, on the other hand, was divided between the loyalty he had for Babcock, and his desire for Bristow and Pierrepont, trustworthy members of his cabinet, to prosecute the Whiskey Ring. Since Babcock had no acceptable explanation for his messages, he was indicted for tax fraud on November 4, 1875. As an Army officer, on December 2, 1875 Babcock requested of Grant a court-martial, believing that a military tribunal would be favorable to his defense. Grant agreed, and saw to it that a pro-Babcock panel was appointed, including Asa Bird Gardiner, who had a clear conflict of interest based on his business dealings with Babcock. Panel member Winfield Scott Hancock pointed out that Babcock was facing identical charges in federal court, and persuaded the court-martial to yield to civilian authorities. On December 8, 1875, U.S. Attorney David Dyer followed Bristow's instructions and set Babcock's St. Louis jury trial for February, 1876. When Babcock's trial date came up, Grant decided to testify in Babcock's defense. By this time, Grant said his critics were using Babcock to go after his own presidency. After cabinet members objected to Grant testifying in St. Louis as unseemly for a President, it was settled that Grant would give a deposition at the White House. St. Louis Trial General William T. Sherman testified at Babcock's trial. On February 8, 1876 Babcock went on trial, an event that lasted eighteen days. Babcock's defense team was noted for its prowess, and included Grant's former Attorney General George Williams, a top criminal defense lawyer, Emory Storrs, and a former appeals judge (New York), John K. Porter. It took place at the U.S. Post Office and Custom House located at 218 North Third Street, and the status of the defendant made the trial a popular and well-attended spectacle. Demand to attend the proceedings was so great that only persons with signed passes and Whiskey Ring defendants were allowed in. Babcock arrived in civilian clothes, including sky-blue pants, a silk hat, and a light jacket. When court was not in session, Babcock stayed at the newly rebuilt Lindell Hotel on Sixth Street and Washington Avenue. Grant's White House deposition took place on February 12; it was notarized by Chief Justice Morrison Waite and witnessed by both Bristow and Pierrepont. In his statement, Grant fully supported the Whiskey Ring prosecutions, but willfully refused to testify against Babcock, despite having been informed by Bristow of Babcock's duplicity. Instead, Grant praised Babcock, saying he had \\"great confidence\\" in Babcock's integrity, and that his confidence in Babcock was \\"unshaken\\". On February 17, Babcock's defense counsel read President Grant's deposition to the jury, which severely weakened any chance of Babcock being convicted. The same day, General William T. Sherman testified that Babcock's \\"character has been very good.\\" Grant's deposition, Sherman's in-person testimony, and the evidence presented by Babcock's shrewd defense counsel led to his acquittal on February 25. A rumor spread that Pierrepont had leaked information to Babcock that aided in his acquittal, but Pierrepont denied this and suggested that Babcock himself had started the rumor. A few months later Grant's appointed anti-corruption team broke up. Pierrepont resigned office on May 21, 1876 and was appointed by Grant United States Minister to the United Kingdom on July 11, 1876. Enmity between Grant and Bristow forced Bristow out of the cabinet, and he resigned on June 20, 1876. Return to Washington D.C. When Babcock returned to Washington, he went back to his White House office, as if there had been no trial. Grant's Secretary of State, Hamilton Fish, was furious, and pressured Grant to force Babcock to leave, saying that Grant merely had to dismiss Babcock, because as a military officer Babcock was subject to orders and had no recourse. Additionally, Treasury Solicitor Wilson informed Grant that Babcock had been involved with the 1869 plot to corner the gold market. Grant finally dismissed Babcock from the White House and appointed his son Ulysses Jr. in Babcock's place. It was later discovered that Babcock used his Whiskey Ring kickbacks to purchase from Henry Shelton Sanford on Christmas Day, 1874 a home and over 50 acres of grove land near what became the city of Sanford, Florida.Robison (Jan 6, 2002), Deeds, Letter Prove General's Ties to Sanford, Accessed on February 9, 2017 =Safe burglary conspiracy (1876)= On April 15, 1876, fifty-one days after his acquittal in the Whiskey Ring trial, Babcock was indicted again, this time for involvement in the Safe Burglary Conspiracy. In 1874, Richard Harrington, an Assistant United States Attorney for Washington, DC attempted to frame Columbus Alexander, leader of the Memorialists, a reform organization critical of Shepherd's management of the city. Harrington hired dishonest Secret Service agents to break into the U.S. Attorney's safe, using explosives to make it obvious that a burglary had occurred. To entrap Alexander, the conspirators took materials that were supposedly stolen from the safe to his home at night, intending to give them to him and then later arrest him for their possession. Alexander thwarted this effort by refusing to answer the door. At that point, the Secret Service agents arrested two other conspirators who pretended to be the supposed burglars, and had them sign false affidavits implicating Alexander in the burglary. The conspiracy collapsed when the Secret Service agents admitted at Alexander's trial that the charges were false, and Alexander was acquitted. The conspiracy was alleged to have included Babcock as the liaison between Harrington and the Secret Service agents because Babcock wanted to silence Alexander, a prominent Grant administration critic. Babcock was exonerated of direct involvement. However, his continued ties to scandal and corruption turned public opinion against him, while he was viewed as a foe of Washington D.C. reform. Public buildings and grounds (1873‚Äì1877) From March 3, 1873 to March 3, 1877 Babcock served as Washington's Superintendent of Public Buildings and Grounds, a Grant appointment he carried out in addition to serving as Grant's secretary. In this role, Babcock was involved in the beautification of the federal city and improvements to its infrastructure, but was also tied to allegations of corruption. The city's territorial governor, Alexander Robey Shepherd, a Grant appointee, operated aggressively when awarding contracts, and Babcock and Shepherd were accused of personally profiting from construction projects within the city limits. Babcock's supervision included construction of the Chain Bridge over the Potomac River and the Anacostia Railroad Bridge. He also supervised the construction of the east wing of the new State, War and Navy Building. Babcock retained the Superintendent's position after he was dismissed from the White House in 1876, and served until the Grant administration ended. Inspector of lighthouses (1877‚Äì1884) On February 27, 1877 Grant appointed Babcock Inspector of Lighthouses of the Fifth District, a low-profile position that enabled Babcock to earn a living by making use of his engineering skills without drawing undue public attention to himself. Babcock continued to serve under Grant and his successors Rutherford B. Hayes, James A. Garfield, and Chester A. Arthur. On August 24, 1882, Arthur appointed Babcock Inspector of Lighthouses for the Sixth District, an appointment he carried out in addition to his Fifth District responsibilities. Puck, a Democratic magazine, in 1880 lampooned Babcock and Grant's alleged support of \\"rings\\" of corruption among his associates. Presidential election (1880) In September 1879, Grant returned from his famous world tour. His popularity was as great as ever and Stalwart Republicans proposed to nominate him for a third term as president. Democrats sought to discredit his previous administration, including his cabinet and political appointees. Although Babock had been out of the political limelight for several years, his reputation was still marred because of his past involvement in corruption. On February 4, 1880, a color illustration by artist Joseph Keppler appeared in Puck magazine, in which Keppler ridiculed Grant and his associates, including Babcock, for having run a corrupt administration.Michael Alexander Kahn, Richard Samuel West (October 2014), What Fools These Mortals Be!, p 49 --- Illustration by Joseph Keppler (February 4, 1880),Puck, v. 6, No. 152, pp. 782-783 On May 14, 1880, Democratic Senator William W. Eaton of Connecticut read a memorial from Davis Hatch, who had been arrested in Santo Domingo in 1868 and was requesting reimbursement for the financial losses he said resulted from his imprisonment. According to Hatch, he was jailed on false charges and was going to be released, but Babcock, who was on the island in 1869 during negotiations for the proposed annexation treaty, interfered with Hatch's release and was complicit in Hatch being sentenced to a five-month prison term. Republican Senator Roscoe Conkling defended Babcock, saying that the Senate investigating committee's 1870 majority report fully exonerated him and that Eaton raised the issue only to try giving Democrats an advantage in an election year. In June 1880, the Republicans held their national convention in Chicago. Grant was nominated by Conkling, his main Stalwart supporter. Republicans deadlocked between Grant and the other frontrunners, James G. Blaine and John Sherman. They eventually selected the dark horse candidate James A. Garfield as their candidate, effectively ending Grant's political career. Garfield went on to win the general election by defeating the Democratic nominee, Winfield Scott Hancock. Mosquito Inlet lighthouse and drowning Mosquito Inlet Lighthouse The Mosquito Inlet Lighthouse project started in 1883, and Babcock was the supervising engineer. On June 2, 1884, Babcock and his associates were on duty and were aboard the government schooner Pharos to deliver construction supplies when they became anxious to return to land because a sudden storm created hazardous ocean conditions. The captain decided not to cross over the inlet bar during the storm because the construction supplies weighed down the ship, and he feared grounding it. As the storm worsened, Captain Newins of the nearby Bonito led seven men in a rowboat to the Pharos in order to retrieve the passengers. In debating whether to wait out the storm on the Pharos or try to make land, Babcock told his associates that since Newins and his crew had rowed safely to the Pharos, they should be able to row to shore on tidal floods created by the storm. After eating their lunch on the Pharos, Babcock and his associates boarded a rowboat and started for the shore. As they approached the inlet bar, swells capsized the boat several times, and it took on water. Babcock was thrown clear, but another person on the boat attached him to it by a lifeline. The boat and crew were battered by waves, oars, and other debris, and Babcock's lifeline was torn loose from the boat, which resulted in his drowning death. Upon reaching the shore, others who had been in the boat recovered Babcock's body and unsuccessfully tried to resuscitate him. Three others, including two of Babcock's associates, were also killed; the bodies of Babcock's associates, Levi P. Luckey and Benjamin F. Sutter, were recovered several days later, but the body of the fourth victim, a member of the boat's crew, was not found. The lighthouse construction project continued after Babcock's death, and was completed in 1887. Historical reputation Scholars note Babcock's high class standing at West Point, engineering skills, and bravery during the American Civil War. Babcock also has been noted positively for his association with the antislavery views of the Radical Republicans. Historians also make positive mention of Babcock's post-White House career, noting that he served for eight years as a government lighthouse inspector and engineer, and did so capably and honestly. However, historians are critical of Babcock's political power as Grant's White House military aide, shielded by Grant, and not subject to resignation. Historians are also highly suspicious of Babcock's unauthorized Santo Domingo annexation pre-agreement. His reputation was also marred by his involvement in the Gold Ring, the Whiskey Ring, and the Safe Burglary Conspiracy. Most historians agree that Babcock betrayed Grant while President, and remain perplexed at Grant's loyalty to his wartime comrade, including Grant's unprecedented White House deposition on Babcock's behalf. In defending Babcock, Grant was not fully candid with the truth in his own testimony, probably to protect his family and his presidency from further scandal. With Babcock's reputation largely narrowed to observations about his corruption, loyalty to Grant, and wartime bravery, historians are generally not able to consider him in a wider context because he did not author an autobiography, nor has he been the subject of an extended biography. Historian William McFeely criticized Babcock for ignoring ethical values in the spirit of opportunism and personal gain. On November 22, 2016, Mississippi State University Libraries announced the digitalization of Babcock's private diaries. Babcock's diaries are part of Mississippi State University Libraries' Ulysses S. Grant Digital Collection. Babcock's diaries began in 1863 during the height of the American Civil War, including his perspective on the siege of Vicksburg and his wartime experiences in Kentucky, Ohio, Tennessee, and Virginia. The diary collections also includes his famous post-war visit to Santo Domingo in 1869 serving as President Grant's special agent and personal secretary. The collection includes Babcock's supplementary materials of speeches, correspondence, and newspaper clippings. The Mississippi State University Libraries said that Babcock's brokerage of the annexation of Santo Domingo, \\"began what became a string of controversies and scandals surrounding Babcock and his position as aide to the President.\\" The scandals culminated in Babcock's involvement in the Whiskey Ring, indictment for tax fraud in 1875, and corruption trial in St. Louis in 1876. Throughout these scandals President Grant gave Babcock his confidence. According to presidential historian Charles W. Calhoun, Babcock emerged as Grant's \\"political majordomo, if not his jackel.\\" Babcock's rumored control, although an exaggeration, over Grant's Navy and Army secretaries, \\"reflected the impression of Babcock's arrogance and pervasive power.\\" Babcock was viewed as Grant's \\"Svengali leading the president unto unrighteous paths.\\" Many viewed Babcock was dishonest with \\"dubious notions of conflict of interest.\\" Grant's Secretary of State Hamilton Fish said Babcock \\"has brains & very many excellent & gentlemanly qualities but is spoiled by his position & a want of delicacy & consideration for the official responsibilities & proper authority (official) of civilians.\\" See also * List of American Civil War brevet generals (Union) * Bibliography of the American Civil War * Bibliography of Ulysses S.

The wheel arrangement was principally used on Mallet-type articulated locomotives, although some tank locomotive examples were also built. A Garratt type locomotive with the same wheel arrangement is designated . Under the UIC classification the wheel arrangement is referred to as (1'C)C1' for Mallet locomotives. Overview The 2-6-6-2 wheel arrangement was most often used for articulated compound steam Mallet locomotives. In a compound Mallet, the rear set of coupled wheels are driven by the smaller high pressure cylinders, from which spent steam is then fed to the larger low pressure cylinders that drive the front set of coupled wheels.Compounding Steam Engines This type of locomotive was commonly used in North America on logging railroads. The 2-6-6-2 wheel arrangement was also used in South Africa and the Soviet Union. Usage=Serbia Serbian narrow gauge compound Mallet The Serbian government used a Mallet articulated compound locomotive for freight service on narrow gauge. It was built for the Serbian government by the American Locomotive Company (ALCO).

In 1912, when they were assimilated into the SAR, they were classified as Class MF. Five more that were delivered in November 1911 were taken directly onto the SAR roster. In 1923 and 1925, six of them were converted to simple expansion (simplex) locomotives. SAR Class MG * A single experimental compound locomotive was included with the CSAR's order for Class MF Mallets from ALCO. It was similar to the others, also with Walschaerts valve gear, but it used saturated steam and had a mechanical stoker, the first South African locomotive to be so equipped. The coupled wheels on the leading engine unit were of a larger diameter than those of the trailing engine unit. It was the only South African articulated locomotive to have driving wheels of different diameters and, in theory, this configuration was to result in improved acceleration, with the rear engine unit providing the traction. It was also believed that the difference in frequency between the front and rear cylinder exhaust beats would result in a more even pressure in the receiver pipe and therefore improved steam flow. In 1912, when it was assimilated into the SAR, it was designated Class MG. SAR Class ME * During 1911, the CSAR ordered an experimental simple expansion Mallet from the North British Locomotive Company (NBL). Compared to other South African Mallets, this locomotive was unique, being arranged as a simplex locomotive with four high pressure cylinders instead of the more usual compound expansion arrangement. The locomotive was intended for test purposes on branchlines with light rail. It had Walschaerts valve gear, a plate frame and was equipped with a Schmidt superheater. By the time it was delivered in January 1912, the CSAR had already become part of the newly established SAR, who designated it the sole Class ME.North British Locomotive Company works list, compiled by Austrian locomotive historian Bernhard Schmeiser *In 1915, the SAR placed five Class MH compound Mallets in service, designed in detail in the locomotive drawing office in Pretoria under the direction of D.A. Hendrie, Chief Mechanical Engineer (CME) of the SAR from 1910 to 1922. They were superheated and had Walschaerts valve gear. The locomotives were built by NBL and erected in the Salvokop shops in Pretoria. At the time of their introduction, the Class MH was the largest and most powerful locomotive in the world on Cape gauge, with a full working order weight of . Soviet Union The wheel arrangement also appeared in Soviet Russia as a locomotive, the P34, built by Kolomna Locomotive Works. It was a modern but compact Mallet of which only one was built.

A drywall mechanic is a skilled trade similar to wood carpenters, except they build everything out of heavy gauge and light gauge steel studs (not wood studs) all year round, regardless of weather conditions. A Drywall mechanic erect various exterior and interior stud wall partitions. They also install metal door frames, window frames, a variety acoustical ceilings, and precast moldings for columns and ceilings. In addition, they also install x-ray shielding, thermal and sound insulation and a variety of drywall panels and metal and vinyl trims. It can be an entry- level position, although there are a number of certifications available. A drywall mechanic can work for a construction firm, or work privately. Health hazards Health hazards include the dangers of toxic poisoning from the fumes and dust of paints and related materials. Construction workers who sand drywall joint compound are often exposed to high concentrations of dusts, talc, calcite, mica, gypsum, and in some cases, respirable silica. Some of these have been associated with varying degrees of eye, nose, throat, and respiratory tract irritation. Over time, breathing the dust from drywall joint compounds may cause persistent throat and airway irritation, coughing, phlegm production, and breathing difficulties similar to asthma. When silica is present, workers may also face an increased risk of silicosis and lung cancer. There are also asbestos and mold health issues in removing old drywall, as well as lead paint on drywall first painted several decades ago. For all of these reasons, constant use of a respirator is widely recommended, and even required by some labor authorities. Potential falls from elevated work platforms or ladders are another risk. Joint compound mixes manufactured prior to the 1980s often contained a complex mixture of several substances. Among the additives used were asbestos fibers, which provided cohesiveness. Exposure to friable asbestos increases risks of various serious health conditions, including cancer. Joint compounds manufactured from 1980 onward were required to have asbestos removed in favor of other compounds due to legislation to ban asbestos' widespread use. For all of these reasons, constant use of a respirator is recommended by almost all drywall compound manufacturers and is required by some labor authorities.

It was possible to go from New York City to Boston completely on streetcars on at least three routes: via Hartford, Connecticut, Springfield, Massachusetts, and Worcester, Massachusetts; via New London, Connecticut and Worcester, or via New London and Providence, Rhode Island. A Shore Line Electric Railway car in Madison, Connecticut in 1911 The majority of streetcar lines in Southern New England ran in mixed traffic on city streets in downtown areas and alongside local highways between towns. Only a smaller number of lines had significant interurban characteristics, including long stretches of private rights of way and roadside reservations that supported operations at speeds far higher than street traffic; most were located in relatively uncrowded Eastern Connecticut with longer distances between population centers. For a brief period from 1916 to 1919, the Shore Line Electric Railway - later called \\"one of the few New England electric lines of genuine interurban technology\\" - owned all these interurban-type lines. They included the Groton and Stonington Street Railway, the Norwich and Westerly Railway, and the New London Division of the Connecticut Company. Due to competition from automobiles, all were abandoned between 1920 and 1940. Currently, the only services that come close to the definition of an interurban are two sections of the MBTA rapid transit system in Boston, both converted commuter rail routes rather than original interurbans.

Between 14 and 26 Castilian ships were captured, and several were sunk. Only two English vessels were sunk but there was significant loss of life. The battle was part of the Hundred Years' War between England and France. English trade, war finance and ability to bring force to bear against France was heavily reliant on seaborne transportation, especially to its territory in Gascony. With its own ability to raise and support a fleet much reduced by English activities, the French hired Castilian ships to blockade English ports. Frustrated by their effectiveness, Edward III himself led the fleet which intercepted them and inflicted heavy losses. In spite of this success, English trade and ports saw little relief from naval harassment by the French and their allies. Background Since the Norman Conquest of 1066, English monarchs had held titles and lands within France, the possession of which made them vassals of the kings of France. Over the centuries, English holdings in France had varied in size, but by 1337 only Gascony in south western France and Ponthieu in northern France were left. Following a series of disagreements between Philip VI of France and Edward III of England, on 24 May 1337 Philip's Great Council in Paris agreed that the Duchy of Aquitaine, effectively Gascony, should be taken back into Philip's hands on the grounds that Edward was in breach of his obligations as a vassal. This marked the start of the Hundred Years' War, which was to last one hundred and sixteen years. Throughout the early part of the war English coastal areas were harassed by French raids. The port towns of Portsmouth, Southampton, Hastings and Plymouth were captured and razed, as were many smaller places. Numerous English merchant ships, and several warships, were captured. In June 1340 Edward III smashed the French fleet at the Battle of Sluys. In 1346 the English landed in northern Normandy and undertook a devastating chevauch√©e through northern France. The English navy paralleled the march of the army, capturing or burning large numbers of French warships and merchant vessels as it went. Thereafter the threat from the French navy was much reduced. The English then soundly beat the French at the Battle of Cr√©cy and captured the major French port city of Calais. The Truce of Calais was agreed in September 1347 but the war continued via raids and guerrilla warfare; the ongoing fighting was \\"almost constant\\". When war did not restrict trade, over 1,000 ships a year departed Gascony for England. Among their cargo were over 100,000,000 litres of wine. The duty levied by the crown on wine from Bordeaux was more than all other customs duties combined and by far the largest source of state income. Bordeaux, the capital of Gascony, was larger than London, and possibly richer. However, by this time English Gascony had become so truncated by French encroachments that it relied on imports of food, largely from England. Any interruptions to regular shipping were liable to starve Gascony and financially cripple England; the French were well aware of this. Prelude England, France and Gascony at the start of the Hundred Years' War In November 1349, Charles de la Cerda, a soldier of fortune, son of Luis de la Cerda, and member of a branch of the Castilian royal family, sailed from northern Spain, commissioned by the French, with an unknown number of ships. He intercepted and captured several English ships laden with wine from Bordeaux and murdered their crews. Later in the year de la Cerda led a Castilian fleet of 47 ships loaded with Spanish wool from Corunna to Sluys, in Flanders, where it wintered. On the way he captured several additional English ships, again throwing the crews overboard. In early 1350 negotiations to renew the truce, brokered by two papal nuncios, were taking place. Nevertheless, the governments of both France and England were actively planning for the renewal of large scale military operations. In February, French intermediaries in Bruges paid 20,000 florins to hire the Castilian fleet as mercenaries. In April it blockaded the English Channel ports, while the French struggled to reinforce it with what native ships they could finance and man. In mid-June a truce was agreed. The Castilians were specifically named in it, and Phillip VI ceased to pay them. Regardless, the Castilian ships continued to attack the English, now as outright pirates. They had converted their vessels into warships by the addition of wooden castlesraised fighting platformsat the bow and stern and the erection of crow's nest fighting platforms at the masthead. They were based out of Sluys, and several hundred Flemish adventurers joined their ranks, mostly equipped as crossbowmen, in the expectation of plunder. Their assault on English shipping has been described as \\"ferocious\\", and as bringing \\"panic\\" to English ports. The English arrayed the coastguard for the first time since the Normandy campaign. On 10 August, while the King was at Rotherhithe, he announced his intention of confronting the Castilians. The English fleet was to rendezvous at Sandwich, Kent. Edward had good sources of intelligence in Flanders and knew the composition of De la Cerda's fleet and when it sailed. He determined to intercept it and sailed from Sandwich on 28 August with 50 ships, all smaller than the majority of the Castilian vessels and some much smaller. The King and many of the highest nobility of England, including two of Edward's sons, sailed with the fleet, which was well manned with men-at-arms and archers. Battle By the afternoon of 29 August the English fleet was off Dungeness. The king was sitting on the deck of his ship, with his knights and nobles, listening to his minstrels playing German airs, and to the singing of young John Chandos. At 4.00 pm they sighted de la Cerda's force moving towards them with an easterly wind behind. The Castilians had become scattered and the English targeted their main body of approximately twenty-four. When the look-out in the tops reported the enemy in sight, the king and his company drank to one another's health, the trumpet was sounded, and the whole line stood out. There being no effective naval artillery at the time, battles at sea consisted of grappling with and boarding enemy vessels. In order that the Castilians not sweep past them on the wind, the English also ran before the wind, but with shortened sails so as to allow themselves to be overtaken. There seems to have been an hour before fighting commenced. The difficulty of the manoeuvre is attested to by the King's own ship, the Cog Thomas, striking the Castilian it was attempting to grapple so heavily as to spring English ship's timbers. At the second attempt, it successfully grappled and archers deterred Castilians attempting to drop large rocks from their higher deck. The Castilian ships towered above the diminutive English ones; \\"like castles to cottages\\" as a contemporary wrote. Using scaling ladders the English men at arms boarded the Castilian ship and cleared its deck. Edward transferred his flag, as Cog Thomas was clearly sinking. His son, Edward Prince of Wales, had a similar experience, his men reportedly barely fighting their way aboard their opponent before their own ship foundered. Their assault was aided by Henry of Lancaster attacking from the other side. La Cerda's crossbowmen caused many English casualties, firing from their elevated positions as the English closed and then attempted to board. The higher-built and heavier Castilian vessels were able to drop bars of iron or other weights on the lighter English vessels, causing serious damage. The conflict continued until twilight. At the close, the English vessel La Salle du Roi, carrying the king's household, and commanded by the Fleming Robert of Namur, was grappled by a larger Castilian, and was being dragged off. A Flemish valet of Robert's, named Hannequin, boarded the enemy and cut the halliards of her mainsail with his sword, allowing other English ships to catch the Castilian, and it was taken. King Edward is said to have captured between 14 and 26 of the enemy and it is possible that others were sunk. What his own losses were is not stated but, as his own vessel and the vessel carrying the Black Prince were sunk, and from the peril of La Salle du Roi, it seems likely that the English fleet suffered heavily. Few, if any, prisoners were taken and dead and wounded Castilians and Flemings were thrown overboard. Much of this action was visible from the English shore, and the clifftops near Winchelsea were lined with spectators, which gave the battle its name. Aftermath noble coin of 1354, the obverse showing Edward III seated in a cog, figuratively \\"ruling the seas\\" There was no pursuit of the surviving Castilian ships which fled to French ports. Joined by French ships, they continued to harass English shipping for the rest of the autumn before withdrawing to Sluys to winter. The following spring, the Channel was still effectively closed to English shipping unless strongly escorted. Trade with Gascony was less affected, but ships were forced to use ports in western England, often impractically far from their cargo's intended English markets. Chroniclers make much of this victory, no doubt because of the royal involvement. However, historians point out the heavy English loss of personnel and the likelihood that a number of their ships were lost. Others have suggested that the battle was just one of a number of significant and hard-fought naval encounters of the period, only recorded because of the prominent figures involved. Most stress its lack of impact on the operational or strategic situation. Charles de la Cerda survived the battle and shortly after was made Constable of France. With communications with Gascony now more secure, the English launched a large expedition from there in 1356 under the Prince of Wales, at the end of which the French suffered a devastating defeat. Edward III continued the war, bringing it to a successful conclusion in 1360 with the Treaty of Br√©tigny. Sources The main contemporaneous account for the battle is Jean Froissart, who was at different times in the service of King Edward and of his wife, Philippa of Hainault, and of the counts of Namur. He repeated what was told to him by men who had been present, and dwells as usual on the chivalry of his patrons. However, there are also records from chroniclers Thomas Walsingham and Robert of Avesbury, and later John Stow. Sir Nicholas Nicolas was the first modern historian to tackle this episode in naval warfare.

It is located within the anal triangle of the perineum, between the right and left ischioanal fossa. As the final functional segment of the bowel, it functions to regulate release of excrement by two muscular sphincter complexes. The anus is the aperture at the terminal portion of the anal canal. Structure In humans, the anal canal is approximately 2.5 to 4 cm long, from the anorectal junction to the anus.https://www.knowyourbody.net/anal-canal.html It is directed downwards and backwards. It is surrounded by inner involuntary and outer voluntary sphincters which keep the lumen closed in the form of an anteroposterior slit. The canal is differentiated from the rectum by a transition along the internal surface from endodermal to skin-like ectodermal tissue. Anal canal is traditionally divided into two segments, upper and lower, separated by the pectinate line (also known as the dentate line): * upper zone (zona columnaris) ** mucosa is lined by simple columnar epithelium ** features longitudinal folds or elevations of tunica mucosa which are joined together inferiorly by folds of mucous membrane known as anal valves ** supplied by the superior rectal artery (a branch of the inferior mesenteric artery) * lower zone ** divided into two smaller zones, separated by a white line known Hilton's line: *** zona hemorrhagica - lined by stratified squamous non-keratinized epithelium *** zona cutanea - lined stratified squamous keratinized epithelium, which blends with the surrounding perianal skin ** supplied by the inferior rectal artery (a branch of the internal pudendal artery) The anal verge refers to the distal end of the anal canal, a transitional zone between the epithelium of the anal canal and the perianal skin. It should not be confused with the pectinate line between the upper and lower zones within the anal canal. Anal gland secretes lymphal discharge and built-up fecal matter from the colon lining. In some animals this gland expungement can be done routinely every 24‚Äì36 months to prevent infection and fistula formation. Relations *The ischioanal fossa are on each side of the anal canal. *The perianal space surrounds the anal canal below the white line. *The submucous space of the canal lies above the white line between the mucous membrane and internal anal sphincter muscle. Function The external anal sphincter muscle is the voluntary muscle that surrounds and adheres to the anus at the lower margin of the anal canal. This muscle is in a state of tonic contraction, but during defecation, it relaxes to allow the release of feces. Movement of the feces is also controlled by the involuntarily controlled internal anal sphincter, which is an extension of the circular muscle surrounding the anal canal. It relaxes to expel feces from the rectum and anal canal.

He has long been a fan of Hollywood action man Steven Seagal, who he had mentioned several times on radio, and remarked that he would love to meet. However, when Seagal rang O'Connell the relationship and understanding between the two was quite difficult and left O'Connell feeling disappointed. Seagal did not understand O'Connell's ironic personality and sense of humour and much of the recorded interview had to be removed from the radio broadcast. The Observer described the interview as, \\"a spectacularly terrible interview in which O'Connell's questions dropped into a seemingly bottomless well of apathy.\\" O'Connell described the interview remarking; \\"It was the single worst thing I've ever done on radio. And the other week I was having a go at Michael Parkinson, saying he used to be fantastic but sadly now he's become too fawning, and then I did the Seagal thing and I thought: I should just leave.\\" Liam Gallagher On 27 October 2006, Liam Gallagher reportedly attempted to phone Absolute Radio (Virgin radio at the time) on \\"Who's calling Christian\\" where there is the chance to win ¬£10,000 for charity. Liam was apparently in a drunken state and it took him 3 hours after an aggressive protest to convince Absolute bosses that it was indeed him and not an imposter. A great deal of swearing occurred off air between the managers and Gallagher who swore that he would come down to Absolute Radio and \\"Rip Christian O'Connell's fucking head off\\". After further phone calls from Polydor records and from Nicole Appleton begging for him to be let on, Gallagher was eventually allowed on and swore live on air on a morning breakfast show. However, he did not complete the conversation, leaving his friend Scully to speak for him. Tony Blair Tony Blair called the \\"Who's Calling Christian?\\" hotline, after charity campaigner Graham Marsh contacted Blair. If he were to win, Marsh, who received a heart transplant in 1999, said he planned to donate his ¬£10,000 to the two charities he supports - the Freemans Heart and Lung Transplant Association and the Tyne Youth and Community Centre, both in Newcastle upon Tyne. Blair began by telling the programme: \\"Probably nothing in my career has prepared me for this.\\" When O'Connell asked if he should be referred to as The Right Honourable Tony Blair, the Prime Minister replied: \\"Refer to me any way you like as long as it's reasonably polite! Tony will do fine... Someone from my constituency phoned me and said 'Why don't we do this?' and I said yes because they are really, really good causes.\\" The exchange ended with O'Connell asking Blair to choose his favourite song from the 1980s. He chose \\"Street With No Name\\" by U2 - actually called \\"Where the Streets Have No Name\\". Marsh and Blair resoundingly won the contest on 7 November 2006. David Tennant Actor David Tennant, a regular on the show and a friend of O'Connell, has been involved in some of the shows and O'Connell's professed \\"shabbiest\\" moments including the 2006 Christmas panto with Thandie Newton and the axed Mr. T escapade. In late March 2007 he appeared on the Breakfast show again and took part in another escapade \\"1 Golden Square\\" (the address of Absolute Radio). Later that week when he appeared on a rival show on BBC Radio 1 on the Saturday, Virgin Radio producer Roque Segade-Vieito contacted the station for a practical joke texting a question to Tennant as \\"I hear you have been signed up for a new programme called 1 Golden Square\\". The question was taken seriously and addressed to Tennant live on Radio 1 leaving O'Connell rather pleased with the gag. In November 2009, Tennant co-hosted the Absolute Breakfast Show with O'Connell for three consecutive days. In October 2010, Tennant co-hosted with O'Connell and acted out Copacabana with some of the Breakfast Show team to discover \\"just who shot who\\", something with had been debated for a few days prior to this. In September 2011, Tennant again co- hosted with O'Connell and experienced a fish-facing with a trout, as well as a tennis ball challenge outside the Absolute Radio studios. James Nesbitt James Nesbitt, another friend of O'Connell's, has also appeared on the show several times. He also appeared before he moved to Virgin Radio, with a guest appearance on O'Connell's XFM show in 2004. David Cameron David Cameron appeared on O'Connell's Absolute Radio show twice in 2009. His second appearance caused controversy when the Conservative leader used the expletives \\"pissed off\\" (referring to the public reaction to the expenses scandal) and (In reference to Twitter) said \\"too many twits might make a twat\\" while on air. Hamish and Andy Australian comedy duo Hamish and Andy co-hosted a world first simulcast with O'Connell on Friday 18 May 2012. The show was broadcast to coincide with both O'Connell's breakfast show and drive time on the Hamish and Andy Show on Australia's Today Network. In 2016 O'Connell and the show joined up again for a 2-day competition with a race by each of their chosen listener's to win a holiday in the UK or Australia. O'Connell's listener lost and had to endure a return flight to the Uk with no holiday. He appeared again on their show in August 2017 promoting his book Radio Boy. BBC Radio 5 Live On 7 August 2004, O'Connell became the second person to host the BBC Radio 5 Live show Fighting Talk, following the departure of Johnny Vaughan. It was his first outing on national radio (his XFM show was broadcast only in London) and he completed 16 months presenting the show before leaving to focus on his new breakfast show at Virgin Radio (Name Changed to Absolute Radio in 2008). The show won a Gold award at the 24th Sony Radio Academy Awards, with O'Connell accredited as the presenter. O'Connell returned to the FT presenter's chair on 12 January 2013, filling in for his successor (and current host) Colin Murray. O'Connell returned to Radio 5 Live on Sunday mornings from September 2009, presenting The Christian O'Connell Solution, alongside comedian Bob Mills, as well as two guests. The hour-long show sees the panel provide comedic solutions to various stories appearing in the week's news. From 10 January 2010 it was replaced by 7 Day Sunday.

The show, recorded in early November, was shown at Christmas 2006. O'Connell admitted on his breakfast show that he went out in the 3rd round after being voted off by his fellow contestants. He blames this on his ridiculous answer to the question \\"Which has more legs than the other? A dog or a duck?\\" O'Connell answered \\"Neither, it's a trick question, they have the same\\". O'Connell appeared as a guest in a September 2008 episode of Loose Women and Ready Steady Cook to promote his book, and was reminded of his previous Weakest Link ordeal by Zoe Tyler. He later appeared a second time on a Radio DJ special in mid-2009, but fared much better, being voted off in Round 7.

Importance  This relatively small naval battle is historically important as it marked the beginning of the of the ascent of the English East India Company's presence in India (tough it would only be relevant centuries after). This battle also convinced the English East India Company to establish a small navy to safeguard their commercial interests from other European powers and also from pirates. This small beginning is regarded as the root of the modern Indian Navy. The background to this battle also points to the main reason for the Dutch Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie being organised in 1602.  Background  This battle was the result of the Portuguese monopoly over trade with India in the late-15th and 16th centuries. Two English ventures, The Company of Merchant Adventurers (established 1551) which became the Muscovy Company in 1555, and the English East India Company also known as \\"John Company\\", (established 1600) were desperately attempting to find routes to the East Indies and the spice trade. The following three individuals played a key part in the events leading up to this battle:  Ralph Fitch  The Portuguese guarded their new-found routes to Asia very well. During July, 1583 an English merchant, Ralph Fitch was arrested for spying at Ormuz (near the modern Iranian port of Bandar Abbas). He was on a voyage from Syria to the Indian Ocean in his ship, Tiger, via what is now Iraq using the Euphrates river. Ralph was presented before the Portuguese Viceroy in Goa where he was placed under arrest. He was released on the surety provided by Jesuit priests, but escaped from Goa and wandered around India for several years. He returned to England in 1591, and became a valuable advisor to the Company.  Jan Huyghens van Linschoten  Jan Huyghens van Linschoten (1563‚Äì1611) was a Dutch Protestant traveller and historian who also served as the Portuguese Viceroy's secretary in Goa between 1583 and 1588. He returned to Holland in 1592. He published a book, Itinerario in 1596 (later published as an English edition as Discours of Voyages into Y East & West Indies) which graphically displayed for the first time in Europe, detailed maps of voyages to the East Indies, particularly India. During his stay in Goa, abusing the trust put in him by the Viceroy, Jan Huyghens meticulously copied the top-secret charts page-by-page. Even more crucially, Jan Huyghens provided nautical data like currents, deeps, islands and sandbanks, which was absolutely vital for safe navigation, along with coastal depictions to guide the way. His publications were also responsible for the establishment of the Dutch East India Company (Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie) in 1602 to unify Dutch efforts at trade with Asia.  Sir William Hawkins, First envoy  Sir William Hawkins led the first voyage of the English East India Company to India and sailed into the Gujarat port of Surat on 24 August 1608 aboard the Hector. He had with him 25,000 pieces of gold and a personal letter to the Mughal Emperor Jehangir (sometimes also rendered as Cehangir or Ichan Guire) from King James I seeking trade concessions. He persisted for over two years, however pirates stole his gold, and tried several times to murder him while on shore. He returned to England empty-handed. The next envoy, Paul Canning, lasted only a few months.  Tenth voyage  The initial voyages of the English East India Company were not necessarily to India. Each voyage was a venture in itself, separately funded by issuance of subscription stock. An eighth voyage was led in 1611 by Captain John Saris to Japan. The ninth voyage (February 1612 ‚Äì August 1615) was to India and Sumatra. The tenth voyage (1612‚Äì1614) on behalf of the English East India Company was led by Captain Thomas Best. It set out from Gravesend on 1 February 1612 passing via the present day Trinidad , then Daman on 3 September 1612 eventually reaching Surat on 5 September 1612. Surat was the principal port for the Mughals, and was then situated at the mouth of the river Tapti.  Battle  Coincidentally, on 13 September 1612 a squadron of 16 Portuguese barks sailed into Surat. On 22 September 1612 Captain Best decided to send an emissary to the Emperor asking for permission to trade and settle a factory at Surat. If refused he planned to quit the country. This may have been partly because King James I had extended the Company's charter in 1609 on the basis that it would be cancelled if no profitable ventures were concluded within three years. On 30 September 1612 Captain Best got news that two of his men, Mr Canning (the purser) and William Chambers were arrested while on shore. Fearing the worst, Captain Best detained a ship belonging to the Governor of Gujarat and offered to release it in exchange for his men. On 10 October Captain Best and his ships sailed to Suvali, a small town about North of Surat. This may have been because the Governor (Sardar Khan?) was battling a Rajput rebellion at a fort situated in the town. Between 17‚Äì21 October, amidst negotiations he managed to obtain a treaty with the Governor allowing trading privileges, subject to ratification by the Emperor. A skirmish took place between the two navies on the 29th without much damage to either side. At daylight on 30 October, Captain Best in Red Dragon sailed through the four Portuguese galleons during which three of them ran aground, and was joined by Hosiander on the other side. The Portuguese managed to get the three galleons refloated. At 9pm that night in an attempt to set the English ships alight, a bark was sent towards them as a fire ship. But the English watch was alert, and the bark was sunk by cannon fire with the loss of eight lives. A standoff remained until 5 December, when Captain Best sailed for the port of Diu.  Tenth voyage continues  On 6 January 1613, Captain Best received a letter from the Emperor ratifying the treaty, which was presented by the Governor. Captain Best then ordered one of his men, Anthony Starkey, on 16 January to leave for England, via land, carrying letters of their success. Mr Starkey was later poisoned by two Jesuit priests. Captain Best then continued on to Ceylon on 18 January, and then onwards to Sumatra, before returning to England around April 1614 without returning to India.  Impact on Mughals  This event sufficiently impressed the Sardar (Governor) of Gujarat, who reported it to the Emperor. Thereafter the Emperor was more favourable towards the English than the Portuguese.  Ships involved = English East India Company  (Most references to this battle mention only the first 2 ships. James and Solomon were also part of the eighth voyage) *Red Dragon (1595) *Hosiander *James *Solomon  Portugal  4 galleons 26 oared barks  Swally  Swally is the anglicization of Suvali. Suvali port is close to the modern day village of Suvali, located in Surat, India. The port was constructed by the English as they found it protected both from sudden squalls and military attacks. Besides, the English found it convenient to use the place for their early trade with Surat as Swally was navigable in low tides. There were several complications in using the ports at Surat as the French and the Portuguese also operated from there.The Times of India ‚Äì Hunt on to locate port of British entry Mr. R Sengupta, the Chief Project Co- ordinator (coastal and marine ecology) of GES advised that, \\"The port was also better than those located in the mouth of river Tapti. The English did not allow anyone to use the port at Swally and used to charge duty for permission to do so.\\"  See also  *Battle of Colachel *Battle of Diu  References  *Kerr, Robert (FRS. & FAS (Edin.)).

He is the only ruler of Trebizond who was not a blood relative of the founder of that state, Alexios I Megas Komnenos. George Finlay suggests he may be the same Andronikos who was a general of Theodore I Laskaris.Finlay, The History of Greece and the Empire of Trebizond, (1204-1461) (Edinburgh: William Blackwood, 1851), p. 332 n. 1; repeated by William Miller, Trebizond: The last Greek Empire of the Byzantine Era: 1204-1461, 1926 (Chicago: Argonaut, 1969), p. 19 During his reign, Trebizond successfully withstood a siege of the city by the Seljuk Turks, and later supported the Shah of Khwarizm in the latter's unsuccessful battle with the Seljuks. Origins The Gidos family appears briefly in Byzantine history at the turn of the 12th/13th century. The etymology of the surname is uncertain, but one view considers it to be from the Greek word for \\"goat\\" ('Gida' Œ≥ŒØŒ¥Œ± f., Œ≥ŒØŒ¥Œπ), another speculative view suggests that the etymology of the surname may be of Latin origin, and is the hellenized form of the Italian name Guido. This in turn led some scholars to theorize that there may be a connection with the Gidos family and Guy/Guido, a son of the Norman conqueror of southern Italy, Robert Guiscard, who defected to the Byzantine emperor Alexios I Komnenos (ruled 1081‚Äì1118) centuries earlier, entered his service and possibly married into the imperial family. Byzantine sources do not treat the family as having a foreign origin and it has not been possible to demonstrate any connection with the son of Robert Guiscard or a Latin origin. W. Hecht casts doubt on a Latin origin of the family. Apart from the megas domestikos Alexios Gidos, who lived in the 12th century, the only other prominent individual bearing the surname Gidos is an Andronikos Gidos, a general of the Nicaean emperor Theodore I Laskaris, who defeated the Latin allies of David Komnenos (along with his brother Alexios the co-founder of the Empire of Trebizond) in 1206. Finlay first suggested that the general should be identified with the later Trapezuntine emperor, a suggestion adopted by many Byzantine historians, in the words of Anthony Bryer, \\"for want of any other candidate\\". Bryer continues, \\"The name Gidos (Gidon) is sufficiently rare to make the proposal plausible, indeed one wonders whether it was on the way to becoming an epithet in itself,\\" then provides a number of examples of \\"Gidos\\" being used in the Pontic region as a synonym for \\"guardian.\\"Bryer, \\"David Komnenos and Saint Eleutherios\\", Archeion Pontou, 42 (1988-1989), p. 186 On the death of the Emperor Alexios, control of the empire passed over Alexios' oldest son, John in favor of Andronikos. The steps that led to Andronikos' ascension have not been recorded. Finlay assumes that \\"the hereditary principle\\" of succession had not become common practice for the Empire of Trebizond at this point.Empire of Trebizond, p. 384 Although William Miller assumes that John was not old enough to assume the throne,Trebizond, pp. 20, 24 one primary source attests that more than one son was, indeed, old enough to do so: during the siege of Sinope, according to Ibn Bibi, when Kaykaus I told the city that unless they surrendered he would kill Alexios, who was his prisoner, the inhabitants replied that \\"he has grown sons in Trebizond who are capable of governing. We will elect one of them as our ruler and will not surrender the country to the Turks.\\"Cited in A. A. Vasiliev, \\"The Foundation of the Empire of Trebizond (1204-1222)\\", Speculum, 11 (1936), p. 27 Miller describes Andronikos Gidos as \\"a shrewd man of great experience in warfare\\".Miller, Trebizond, p. 20 His experience at war served the new-born polity well in facing a serious attack on the capital in 1224. Marriage to Komnene Andronikos married a daughter of Alexios I of Trebizond and Theodora Axuchina, whose first name is unknown. Komnene is the female form of \\"Komnenos,\\" her family name. Her siblings included John I of Trebizond and Manuel I of Trebizond. The Seljuks The Seljuk Turks occupied Sudak in the Crimea and constructed a fortress there between 1220 and 1222.A. C. S. Peacock, \\"The Sali≈´q Campaign against the Crimea and the Expansionist Policy of the Early Reign of'AlƒÅ' al-Dƒ´n KayqubƒÅd\\", Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, Third Series, 16 (2006), p. 140 In 1223 the Seljuk governor of Sinope sent ships to attack the coast of Trapezuntine Crimea (the so-called Perateia) in an effort to divert trade into his port. A ship carrying the annual tribute of Perateia, with the archon of the province and a number of notables from Cherson on board, was driven by a storm into Sinope's harbour. In violation of a treaty agreed to by the Turks and the Empire of Trebizond in 1220, the city's governor, Hetum, seized the vessel with its cargo, passengers, and crew and also sent a fleet to plunder Perateia. In response, Andronikos assembled a fleet and dispatched it against Sinope. His men plundered up to the walls of the \\"mart\\" and killed or captured the crews of the ships lying in the harbour. They rescued the captive archon, his ship and his money, as well as all the plunder carried off from Cherson. Upon learning of this attack, Sultan Melik marched on Trebizond. In response to the sultan's threat, Andronikos summoned all his troops and fortified the passes leading to the city. The emperor inflicted considerable loss upon the advance guard of the sultan before withdrawing within the walls of the city, which were already accounted impregnable although they did not yet extend to the sea. At this point the siege of the city began.Miller, Trebizond, p. 21 The sultan made camp near the Monastery of Saint Eugenios, and set fire to the suburbs outside the walls. A string of attacks and counterattacks followed over the next few days (punctuated by a Seljuk embassy being shown the ample stores inside the city) ended with an attempt to storm the walls by night. This last attack failed when a sudden thunderstorm, accompanied by torrential rain and hail, terrified and scattered the besiegers. Some rode over the cliffs in the dark into the ravines, others were caught by swollen torrents from the mountains. Melik was brought a prisoner to Trebizond, where Andronikos received him with honor. A pact was made between them that in the future the tie of vassalage, which had previously bound Trebizond to Iconium, should cease, and that the Trapezuntines should no longer be obliged either to perform military service to the sultan or to send tribute or gifts. Melik is reported to have been so impressed by this moderation that he performed more than the treaty required by sending an annual present of Arab horses to Andronikos and money to the Monastery of St Eugenios. Cult of St Eugenios The siege of 1224 is the source of two early legends of the St Eugenios cult. Fear of the army of Melik is said to have driven many Trapezuntines to the sanctuaries of Panagia Chrysokephalos and church of Saint Eugenios. In the first legend, the account of the siege compiled by John Lazaropoulos, who, under the name of Joseph, was Metropolitan of Trebizond in the second half of the fourteenth century, narrates the legend that a further ruse was perpetrated by the outraged St Eugenios, who appeared to Melik, the profaner of his shrine, in the guise of mayor of the city, who held its keys, and pretended to have been sent by the suffering citizens to invite him to enter. The Sultan's suspicions were calmed by his astrologers, who told him that his entry into the city was written in the stars. In the second, Melik fled, only to fall into the hands of the mountaineers from Matzouka, and 150 years later a shrine erected to St Eugenios still marked the spot of his capture. Traditional accounts of the siege emphasise the sultan's threats to destroy churches, especially the monastery of St Eugenios, even though destroying churches was not usual Seljuk practice. The church of the Panagia Chrysokephalos and St Eugenios both grew richer from the spoils of the siege.Miller, Trebizond, pp. 22f The Khwarizmshah and the Mongols The independence of Trebizond lasted only until 1230. Jalal-ad-din, the Sultan of Khwarizm, invaded Anatolia in a direct challenge to the Sultanate of Iconium. Jalal-ad-din, who had conquered Georgia in the 1220s, was now a neighbour of Trebizond. Andronikos considered neutrality impossible and made an alliance with the Khwarizmshah, and agreed to war with the Seljuks. Many of Jalal-ad-din's troops, after their defeat at the Battle of Yassƒ±√ßemen in 1230, sought refuge at Trebizond, that the Trapezuntine contingent had assisted the Shah in that battle.Miller, Trebizond, pp. 23f The alliance with Jalal ad-Din cost Andronikos the loss of the privileges which he had gained in his treaty with Kaykaus. Trebizond once more became a vassal to the Sultan of Iconium. About 1240 Vincent de Beauvais reports the ruler of Trebizond used to send the sultan 200 lances (1,000 men). Nor was this the only loss of this reign.Miller, Trebizond, p. 24 The Mongols occupied a large part of Georgia. Iberia and Lazica, which had been subject to Trebizond, whose eastern frontier had been Soteropolis, separated themselves from the empire and formed an independent kingdom of Imereti under David VI Narin, son of the Georgian Queen Rusudan.  Coinage  Andronikos is the earliest Emperor of Trebizond whose coins have survived. A number of bronze trachea (also called scyphates) have been identified as having been struck during his reign. These bear the image of the Virgin Mary seated on a throne and holding an icon of the Christ Child‚Äîsomewhat similar to the obverses of the later aspers of Manuel I‚Äîwhile on the reverse appears an emperor with a forked beard and Christ standing beside him with his hand raised in benediction.D.M.

Nested transactions are implemented differently in different databases. However, they have in common that the changes are not made visible to any unrelated transactions until the outermost transaction has committed. This means that a commit in an inner transaction does not necessarily persist updates to the system. In some databases, changes made by the nested transaction are not seen by the 'host' transaction until the nested transaction is committed. According to some, this follows from the isolation property of transactions. The capability to handle nested transactions properly is a prerequisite for true component-based application architectures. In a component-based encapsulated architecture, nested transactions can occur without the programmer knowing it. A component function may or may not contain a database transaction (this is the encapsulated secret of the component. See Information hiding). If a call to such a component function is made inside a BEGIN - COMMIT bracket, nested transactions occur. Since popular databases like MySQL do not allow nesting BEGIN - COMMIT brackets, a framework or a transaction monitor is needed to handle this. When we speak about nested transactions, it should be made clear that this feature is DBMS dependent and is not available for all databases. Theory for nested transactions is similar to the theory for flat transactions. The banking industry usually processes financial transactions using open nested transactions, which is a looser variant of the nested transaction model that provides higher performance while accepting the accompanying trade-offs of inconsistency.

Early Careers & Formation of Vaganza  In Maplewood, New Jersey 1986, Matthew Quigley would join the alt rock band \\"Skunk\\". Providing Vocals and Bass, he appeared on both studio albums \\"Last American Virgin\\" & \\"Laid.\\" In the summer of 1991, Matthew Quigley would join the group \\"Astronaut,\\" which at the time had only released the EP \\"Sleazy Listening.\\" Astronaut at the time was missing a bass player, only featuring drummer and lead singer Tim Smith, and Guitarist David Wallingford. Tim Smith however would shortly leave due to frustration with his position in the band. Over the next year, this would have the 2 form the group Vaganza. Supposedly during this time, Kurt Cobain and Chris Cornell were under consideration to be contacted to join the group. \\"Are You Willing to Die for Rock 'n' Roll\\" Demo Their first unofficial release was a 1994 demo entitled \\"Are You Willing to Die for Rock 'n' Roll?\\" The 6 track demo cost around a total of $5,000 to produce. Circulating this demo to various friends of the band members, it stirred a buzz in the industry, eventually getting picked up to make a studio album. Self-titled Debut Their self-titled debut, and only official, album was released in May 1998. Self-produced, with their friend/sound engineer/producer Greg Frey. It featured in addition to Quigley (vocals, bass, guitar, synthesizers) and Wallingford (vocals, guitar, piano, synthesizers, percussion) many guest musicians as well as an orchestra and multiple choirs. The most noteworthy session musician being drummer Joey Waronker, who has played drums with Beck, R.E.M. and Walt Mink. The release of the \\"Vaganza\\" album was troubled. Although already mastered, due to complications with their A&R; man, Terry Tolkin of Elektra Records, they would be dropped by their record label. Quickly however they would be picked by Geffen Records, a subsidiary of Outpost Recordings. This would lead to a whole remixing of the album. Separation of Vaganza  Within six months of their debut album's release they were dropped by Outpost Recordings. Soon after, the duo themselves would disband. There was an EP recording which was never released under the Vaganza name, David Wallingford released 3 songs from this recording in one of his solo albums \\"On The Key of Qui Vive\\". More recent years have found Wallingford as a married father of two, cabaret performer, avid chess player, and music teacher, living in the swamps of Jersey.

The town extends on both sides of the valley through which flows the river Yerres. The highest point is the wooded Mont Griffon, which reaches an altitude of 116 m, while the lowest point is at only 30 m above sea level. Sights=Caillebotte Estate Les Canotiers, G. Caillebotte In 1860 the father of Gustave Caillebotte bought an estate on the banks of the river Yerres and the famous impressionist painted around 80 paintings there, until the sale of the estate in 1879. The most famous paintings the artist made in Yerres are Portraits √† la campagne, Baigneurs, Bords de l'Yerres, Canotiers ramant sur l'Yerres. The estate and its magnificent garden are now owned by the town and open to visitors. Saint- Honest Church The first parish of Yerres could well date back to the 12th century. At that time a wooden church stood on the spot where the current church building stands.

Composed between 1907 and 1908, the Rapsodie is one of Ravel's first major works for orchestra. It was first performed in Paris in 1908 and quickly entered the international repertoire. The piece draws on the composer's Spanish heritage and is one of several of his works set in or reflecting Spain. Background The genesis of the Rapsodie was a Habanera, for two pianos, which Ravel wrote in 1895. It was not published as a separate piece, and in 1907 he composed three companion pieces. A two-piano version was completed by October of that year, and the suite was fully orchestrated the following February.Orenstein, p. 57 At about this time there was a distinctly Spanish tone to Ravel's output, perhaps reflecting his own Spanish ancestry.Goodwin, p. 4 His opera L'heure espagnole was completed in 1907,Kilpatrick, Emily. \\"The Carbonne Copy: Tracing the premi√®re of L'Heure espagnole\\", Revue de Musicologie, 2009, pp. 97‚Äì135 as was the song \\"Vocalise- Etude en forme de habanera\\".Orenstein, p. 54 In the interval between the composition of the original Habanera and the completion of the four-movement Rapsodie, Claude Debussy had published a piano suite, Estampes (1903), of which the middle section, \\"Soir√©e dans Grenade\\", had a Spanish theme. To counter any accusations of plagiarism, Ravel made certain that the date 1895 was clearly printed for his Habanera in the published score of the Rapsodie. The premi√®re of the Rapsodie was given by the Orchestre des Concerts Colonne, conducted by √âdouard Colonne, at the Th√©√¢tre du Ch√¢telet on 15 March 1908. The critical reception was generally favourable. Dissenting voices were Pierre Lalo, who habitually disliked Ravel's music, and Gaston Carraud, who called the score \\"slender, inconsistent and fugitive\\". Otherwise there was much praise for the subtle and fresh orchestration and the picturesqueness of the music.Orenstein, p. 58 The work was soon taken up internationally. Henry Wood gave the British premiere in October 1909 to a capacity audience at the Proms,\\"Promenade Concerts\\", The Times, 22 October 1909, p. 11 and the following month the work was first given in New York.\\"Philharmonic Society\\", The New York Times, 22 September 1909 Music=Instrumentation The work is scored for an orchestra of 2 piccolos, 2 flutes, 2 oboes, cor anglais, 2 soprano clarinets, bass clarinet, 3 bassoons, sarrusophone, 4 horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, bass drum, cymbals, castanets, tambourine, gong, snare drum, xylophone, celesta, 2 harps and strings. Structure The Rapsodie has four movements; a complete performance typically lasts around 15 minutes. 1. Pr√©lude √† la nuit The movement is marked tr√®s mod√©r√©; the time signature is and the key is A major. The whole movement is quiet, never rising above mezzo forte; the strings are muted throughout. As in the String Quartet of three years earlier Ravel places themes in the opening movement that recur in subsequent sections, most particularly the insistent opening theme, F‚ÄìE‚ÄìD‚ÄìC.Nichols, pp. 96‚Äì97; and Orenstein, pp. 166‚Äì168 2. Malague√±a This is the shortest of the four movements, and is marked assez vif (\\"fairly lively\\"). Malague√±a refers to a flamenco dance from the southern Spanish province of M√°laga, but Ravel's music here has only the meter in common with the authentic dance. The movement is instead what the critic No√´l Goodwin calls \\"more a romantic evocation of place and mood\\".Goodwin, pp. 4‚Äì5 Like the first movement, it is in the key of A, though slightly ambiguous as to whether it is major or minor. The movement ends quietly with a repeat of the four note phrase that opens the first movement. 3. Habanera The movement, in and switching between F major and minor, is marked assez lent et d'un rythme las (\\"rather slow and with a drowsy rhythm\\"). Goodwin describes it as \\"beguiling and subtle in its expression of a thoroughly Spanish character and spirit\\".Goodwin, p. 5 4. Feria Feria (Festival), in and C major, is marked assez anim√© (\\"fairly lively\\"). It is the longest of the four movements, and is the first point in the score at which Ravel, in Nichols's phrase allows \\"the √©lan that has so far been deliberately stifled\\" to break out. The boisterous carnival atmosphere has undertones of nostalgia, but exuberance triumphs and the work ends in a joyful burst of orchestral colour.

An antimetabolite is a chemical that inhibits the use of a metabolite, which is another chemical that is part of normal metabolism. Such substances are often similar in structure to the metabolite that they interfere with, such as the antifolates that interfere with the use of folic acid; thus, competitive inhibition can occur, and the presence of antimetabolites can have toxic effects on cells, such as halting cell growth and cell division, so these compounds are used as chemotherapy for cancer. Function=Cancer treatment Antimetabolites can be used in cancer treatment, as they interfere with DNA production and therefore cell division and tumor growth. Because cancer cells spend more time dividing than other cells, inhibiting cell division harms tumor cells more than other cells. Antimetabolite drugs are commonly used to treat leukemia, cancers of the breast, ovary, and the gastrointestinal tract, as well as other types of cancers. In the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System antimetabolite cancer drugs are classified under L01B. Antimetabolites generally impair DNA replication machinery, either by incorporation of chemically altered nucleotides or by depleting the supply of deoxynucleotides needed for DNA replication and cell proliferation. Examples of cancer drug antimetabolites include, but are not limited to the following: *5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) *6-Mercaptopurine (6-MP) *Capecitabine (Xeloda¬Æ) *Cytarabine (Ara-C¬Æ) *Floxuridine *Fludarabine *Gemcitabine (Gemzar¬Æ) *Hydroxycarbamide *Methotrexate *Pemetrexed (Alimta¬Æ) *Phototrexate Anti-metabolites masquerade as a purine (azathioprine, mercaptopurine) or a pyrimidine, chemicals that become the building-blocks of DNA. They prevent these substances from becoming incorporated into DNA during the S phase (of the cell cycle), stopping normal development and cell division.Takimoto CH, Calvo E. \\"Principles of Oncologic Pharmacotherapy\\" in Pazdur R, Wagman LD, Camphausen KA, Hoskins WJ (Eds) Cancer Management: A Multidisciplinary Approach. 11 ed. 2008. Anti-metabolites also affect RNA synthesis. However, because thymidine is used in DNA but not in RNA (where uracil is used instead), inhibition of thymidine synthesis via thymidylate synthase selectively inhibits DNA synthesis over RNA synthesis. Due to their efficiency, these drugs are the most widely used cytostatics. Competition for the binding sites of enzymes that participate in essential biosynthetic processes and subsequent incorporation of these biomolecules into nucleic acids, inhibits their normal tumor cell function and triggers apoptosis, the cell death process. Because of this mode of action, most antimetabolites have high cell cycle specificity and can target arrest of cancer cell DNA replication. Antibiotics Antimetabolites may also be antibiotics, such as sulfanilamide drugs, which inhibit dihydrofolate synthesis in bacteria by competing with para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA).\\"The Organic Chemistry of Drug Design and Drug Action\\" (2nd edition), R. B. Silverman, 2004. PABA is needed in enzymatic reactions that produce folic acid, which acts as a coenzyme in the synthesis of purines and pyrimidines, the building-blocks of DNA. Mammals do not synthesize their own folic acid so they are unaffected by PABA inhibitors, which selectively kill bacteria. Sulfanilamide drugs are not like the antibiotics used to treat infections. Instead, they work by changing the DNA inside cancer cells to keep them from growing and multiplying. Antitumor antibiotics are a class of antimetabolite drugs that are cell cycle nonspecific. They act by binding with DNA molecules and preventing RNA (ribonucleic acid) synthesis, a key step in the creation of proteins, which are necessary for cancer cell survival. Anthracyclines are anti-tumor antibiotics that interfere with enzymes involved in copying DNA during the cell cycle. Examples of anthracyclines include: *Daunorubicin *Doxorubicin (Adriamycin¬Æ) *Epirubicin *Idarubicin Anti-tumor antibiotics that are not anthracyclines include: *Actinomycin-D *Bleomycin *Mitomycin-C *Mitoxantrone *Phototrexate Other uses Antimetabolites, particularly mitomycin C (MMC), are commonly used in America and Japan as an addition to trabeculectomy, a surgical procedure to treat glaucoma. Antimetabolites have been shown to decrease fibrosis of operative sites. Thus, its use following external dacryocystorhinostomy, a procedure for the management of nasolacrimal duct obstruction, is being researched. Intraoperative antimetabolite application, namely mitomycin C (MMC) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), is currently being tested for its effectiveness of managing pterygium. Types Main categories of these drugs include: *base analogues (altered nucleobases) ‚Äì structures that can substitute for a normal nucleobases in nucleic acids. This means that these molecules are structurally similar enough to the basic components of DNA that they can be substituted in. However, since they are slightly different from the normal bases after they are incorporated into the DNA, the DNA production is halted and the cell dies. **purine analogues ‚Äì mimic the structure of metabolic purines, the larger bases incorporated into DNA as adenosine and guanosine. ***Examples: Azathioprine, Thiopurines, and Fludarabine **pyrimidine analogues ‚Äì mimic the structure of metabolic pyrimidines, the smaller bases incorporated into DNA as cytosine and thymine. ***Examples: 5-Fluorouracil, Gemcitabine, and Cytarabine *nucleoside analogues ‚Äì nucleoside alternatives that consist of a nucleic acid analogue and a sugar. This means these are the same bases as above, but with an added sugar group. For the nucleoside analogues either the base or the sugar component can be altered. They are similar enough to the molecules used to build cellular DNA that they are incorporated by the cell into its DNA, but different enough that after being added the cell's DNA they stop cell growth. *nucleotide analogues ‚Äì nucleotides alternatives that consist of a nucleic acid, a sugar, and 1‚Äì3 phosphates. This means these molecules look exactly like the pieces used to build DNA in a cell and can be incorporated into a growing cell's DNA. However, because they are analogues and therefore slightly different than regular nucleotides, causing the cell‚Äôs growth to be halted and the cell to die. *antifolates ‚Äì chemicals that block the actions of folic acid (vitamin B9) which is needed to build DNA and allow cells to grow.

The story which they are reported to have told is an elaborate and fantastical tale of occult religious rituals practised at the houses of wealthy individuals in Milan, Italy, where a woman known as the Madonna Oriente, possibly regarded as a goddess by her followers, performed magical acts such as the resurrection of slaughtered animals. The two women, Sibilla Zanni and Pierina de' Bugatis, were brought before the Inquisition first in 1384, and with their story apparently dismissed as fantasy, were sentenced only to minor penance. When they were investigated again in 1390, however, they were charged with consorting with the Devil, condemned, and executed. While there is no evidence that the organized group described by the women actually existed, their testimonies are remarkably similar to those of several other groups in Italy and greater Europe, such as the followers of Richella and \\"the wise Sibillia\\" in 15th century Northern Italy, the Benandanti of 16th and 17th century Northern Italy, the Armiers of the Pyrenees, the Romanian CƒÉlu≈üari, Livonian werewolves, Dalmatian kresnici, Hungarian t√°ltos and Caucasian burkudzauta. These widespread repeated themes have been identified by historian Carlo Ginzburg as part of an ancient mythological complex probably originating from central Eurasia. The mythology of these groups has become a popular subject among adherents of modern witchcraft and Neopaganism. Ginzburg concluded that the name Madonna Oriente derives from the Latin Domina Oriens, a term for the Moon as a goddess.

Anton Maria Anderledy, S.J. Very Rev. Anton Maria Anderledy, S.J., (3 June 1819 ‚Äì 18 January 1892) was a Swiss Jesuit, elected the twenty-third Superior General of the Society of Jesus. Religious and academic formation Son of a director of the postal services, Anderledy entered the Jesuit novitiate at Brig in 1838. After the novitiate, he taught for 2 years (1842‚Äì44) the classics at the college of Fribourg, where he excelled as a Latin scholar. Philosophy was done in Rome (1844‚Äì47) where he began also his theological studies. For reason of health, however he moved back to Fribourg. When the Jesuits were expelled from Switzerland (November 1847), Anderledy carried on his theological studies for a while in Chamb√©ry (Savoy) from where another expulsion order (March 1848) drove him with fifty others to the United States. Still a student of Theology he completed the course in St. Louis, Missouri, and was finally ordained priest (29 September 1848) there, by Archbishop Peter Richard Kenrick. Missionary, Rector, Provincial For two years (1848‚Äì50) Anderledy took care of the pastoral needs of the German migrants at Green Bay, Wisconsin, where he devoted himself with great energy to his flock. He was recalled to Europe in 1850, first in order to make his final year of formation (called 'Tertianship') in Drongen, Belgium and soon after (1851), in Germany, to be a member of the 'missionary band' led by Father Peter Roh. With him he took part in more than 40 popular missions in different German towns. In 1853, he was chosen to be rector of Jesuit students in Cologne. He accompanied them to Paderborn and remained in charge of their studies until 1859, when he was appointed Provincial of the German Province. During Anderledy's term of office, which lasted six years, he purchased the splendid medieval abbey of Maria Laach, near Bonn, where he established the province-house of higher studies. In 1865, he was himself sent to Maria-Laach as professor of moral theology. From there he launched the well-known Theological journal Stimmen aus Maria-Laach. In 1870, Anderledy was called to Rome as Assistant to the Jesuit Superior-General, for the German-speaking provinces. General Congregation XXIII Superior General Pieter Beckx, 88 years old and infirm, had called a General Congregation in order that a Vicar General (with rights of succession) be given him. Due to the great uncertainty of the political situation in Italy, General Congregation XXIII did not meet in Rome but at Fiesole (Firenze) in 1883. The electors chose with near unanimity Anton Anderledy as Vicar-General (and Successor to be) of Pieter Beckx. The same Congregation passed also a decree that condemned 'Liberalism in the Church' and strengthened Theological and scientific formation in the Society. It did express also strong support for the Gregorian University. Vicar General, General In January 1884 Anderledy assumed all the duties of the Superior-General as Beckx went into retirement in Rome. On Beckx's death in 1887, Anderledy became in title the Superior-General of the Society of Jesus. * The few circular letters he wrote to the Society are largely on religious and spiritual themes: the canonization of Edmund Campion (and others), promotion of the devotion to the Sacred Heart, and again canonizations of Alphonsus Rodriguez, John Berchmans and Aloysius Gonzaga. * He expressed strong support to Pope Leo XIII, first by backing strongly (in a letter of 1884) the Pope's condemnation of freemasonry in Humanum genus, and later by condemning vicious anti-papal writings that were circulating in France. * During this time, the Jesuits were banned in many of the nations of Europe; indirectly this promoted apostolic work overseas. The Canadian mission was upgraded and made independent from England. New missions were started in Moldavia (1885), Pune (India, 1886), El Minya (Egypt, 1887). Several Theologates and Universities were founded too: Enghien (French Jesuits in exile in Belgium, 1887), Los Gatos (California), Kurseong (India, 1888), Tananarive (Malagasy, 1888), etc. * He edited and published a new edition of Reuter's Neo-Confessarius, which he annotated. Appreciation * Anderledy's term is characterized by its brevity, coming as it does after his immediate predecessors' long terms of office. He also had to govern the Society while exiled from Rome: his headquarters (\\"Curia Generalizia\\") was at Fiesole (Firenze). This was a source of many inconveniences. * In his handling of the Jesuits he was known for great firmness of character. He also showed a modern interest in scientific studies in Jesuit schools. * In spite of very difficult circumstances [at one point all the Jesuit schools in France and Italy were confiscated and their staff sent into exile] the number of members of the Society continued to increase: from 11,481, when he was elected, to 13,275 in 1892.

When the coefficients can be arbitrary complex numbers, most results are not specific to the case of two variables, so they are described in quadratic form. A quadratic form with integer coefficients is called an integral binary quadratic form, often abbreviated to binary quadratic form. This article is entirely devoted to integral binary quadratic forms. This choice is motivated by their status as the driving force behind the development of algebraic number theory. Since the late nineteenth century, binary quadratic forms have given up their preeminence in algebraic number theory to quadratic and more general number fields, but advances specific to binary quadratic forms still occur on occasion. Pierre Fermat stated that if p is an odd prime then the equation p = x^2 + y^2 has a solution iff p \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{4}, and he made similar statement about the equations p = x^2 + 2y^2, p = x^2 + 3y^2, p = x^2 - 2y^2 and p = x^2 - 3y^2 x^2 + y^2, x^2 + 2y^2, x^2 - 3y^2 and so on are quadratic forms, and the theory of quadratic forms gives a unified way of looking at and proving these theorems Another instance of quadratic forms is Pell's equation x^2-ny^2=1 Binary quadratic forms are closely related to ideals in quadratic fields, this allows the class number of a quadratic field to be calculated by counting the number of reduced binary quadratic forms of a given discriminant The classical theta function of 2 variables is \\\\sum_{(m,n)\\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}^2} q^{m^2 + n^2}, if f(x,y) is a positive definite quadratic form then \\\\sum_{(m,n)\\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}^2} q^{f(m,n)} is a theta function  Equivalence  Two forms f and g are called equivalent if there exist integers \\\\alpha, \\\\beta, \\\\gamma, \\\\text{ and } \\\\delta such that the following conditions hold: : \\\\begin{align} f(\\\\alpha x + \\\\beta y, \\\\gamma x + \\\\delta y) &= g(x,y),\\\\ \\\\alpha \\\\delta - \\\\beta \\\\gamma &= 1.\\\\end{align} For example, with f= x^2 + 4xy + 2y^2 and \\\\alpha = -3, \\\\beta = 2, \\\\gamma = 1, and \\\\delta = -1, we find that f is equivalent to g = (-3x+2y)^2 + 4(-3x+2y)(x-y)+2(x-y)^2, which simplifies to -x^2+4xy-2y^2. The above equivalence conditions define an equivalence relation on the set of integral quadratic forms. It follows that the quadratic forms are partitioned into equivalence classes, called classes of quadratic forms. A class invariant can mean either a function defined on equivalence classes of forms or a property shared by all forms in the same class. Lagrange used a different notion of equivalence, in which the second condition is replaced by \\\\alpha \\\\delta - \\\\beta \\\\gamma = \\\\pm 1. Since Gauss it has been recognized that this definition is inferior to that given above. If there is a need to distinguish, sometimes forms are called properly equivalent using the definition above and improperly equivalent if they are equivalent in Lagrange's sense. In matrix terminology, which is used occasionally below, when : \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\alpha & \\\\beta \\\\ \\\\gamma & \\\\delta \\\\end{pmatrix} has integer entries and determinant 1, the map f(x,y) \\\\mapsto f(\\\\alpha x + \\\\beta y, \\\\gamma x + \\\\delta y) is a (right) group action of \\\\mathrm{SL}_2(\\\\mathbb{Z}) on the set of binary quadratic forms. The equivalence relation above then arises from the general theory of group actions. If f=ax^2+bxy+cy^2, then important invariants include * The discriminant \\\\Delta=b^2-4ac. * The content, equal to the greatest common divisor of a, b, and c. Terminology has arisen for classifying classes and their forms in terms of their invariants. A form of discriminant \\\\Delta is definite if \\\\Delta < 0, degenerate if \\\\Delta is a perfect square, and indefinite otherwise. A form is primitive if its content is 1, that is, if its coefficients are coprime. If a form's discriminant is a fundamental discriminant, then the form is primitive. Discriminants satisfy \\\\Delta\\\\equiv 0,1 \\\\pmod 4.  Automorphisms  If f is a quadratic form, a matrix : \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\alpha & \\\\beta \\\\ \\\\gamma & \\\\delta \\\\end{pmatrix} in \\\\mathrm{SL}_2(\\\\mathbb{Z}) is an automorphism of f if f(\\\\alpha x + \\\\beta y, \\\\gamma x + \\\\delta y) = f(x,y). For example, the matrix : \\\\begin{pmatrix} 3 & -4 \\\\ -2 & 3 \\\\end{pmatrix} is an automorphism of the form f = x^2 - 2y^2. The automorphisms of a form form a subgroup of \\\\mathrm{SL}_2(\\\\mathbb{Z}). When f is definite, the group is finite, and when f is indefinite, it is infinite and cyclic. Representations We say that a binary quadratic form q(x,y) represents an integer n if it is possible to find integers x and y satisfying the equation n = f(x,y). Such an equation is a representation of n by f.  Examples  Diophantus considered whether, for an odd integer n, it is possible to find integers x and y for which n = x^2 + y^2. When n=65, we have : \\\\begin{align} 65 &= 1^2 + 8^2,\\\\ 65 &= 4^2 + 7^2, \\\\end{align} so we find pairs (x,y) = (1,8) \\\\text{ and } (4,7) that do the trick. We obtain more pairs that work by switching the values of x and y and/or by changing the sign of one or both of x and y. In all, there are sixteen different solution pairs. On the other hand, when n=3, the equation : 3=x^2 + y^2 does not have integer solutions. To see why, we note that x^2 \\\\geq 4 unless x = -1, 0 or 1. Thus, x^2+y^2 will exceed 3 unless (x,y) is one of the nine pairs with x and y each equal to -1, 0 or 1. We can check these nine pairs directly to see that none of them satisfies 3 = x^2 + y^2, so the equation does not have integer solutions. A similar argument shows that for each n, the equation n =x^2+y^2 can have only a finite number of solutions since x^2+y^2 will exceed n unless the absolute values x and y are both less than \\\\sqrt{n}. There are only a finite number of pairs satisfying this constraint. Another ancient problem involving quadratic forms asks us to solve Pell's equation. For instance, we may seek integers x and y so that 1 = x^2 - 2y^2. Changing signs of x and y in a solution gives another solution, so it is enough to seek just solutions in positive integers. One solution is (x,y) = (3,2), that is, there is an equality 1 = 3^2 - 2 \\\\cdot 2^2. If (x,y) is any solution to 1 = x^2 - 2 y^2, then (3x+4y,2x+3y) is another such pair. For instance, from the pair (3,2), we compute : (3\\\\cdot 3 + 4 \\\\cdot 2, 2\\\\cdot 3 + 3 \\\\cdot 2) = (17,12), and we can check that this satisfies 1 = 17^2 - 2 \\\\cdot 12^2. Iterating this process, we find further pairs (x,y) with 1 = x^2 - 2y^2: : \\\\begin{align} (3 \\\\cdot 17 + 4 \\\\cdot 12, 2 \\\\cdot 17 + 3 \\\\cdot 12) &= (99,70),\\\\ (3 \\\\cdot 99 + 4 \\\\cdot 70, 2 \\\\cdot 99 + 3 \\\\cdot 70) &= (477,408),\\\\ &\\\\vdots \\\\end{align} These values will keep growing in size, so we see there are infinitely many ways to represent 1 by the form x^2 - 2y^2. This recursive description was discussed in Theon of Smyrna's commentary on Euclid's Elements.  The representation problem  The oldest problem in the theory of binary quadratic forms is the representation problem: describe the representations of a given number n by a given quadratic form f. \\"Describe\\" can mean various things: give an algorithm to generate all representations, a closed formula for the number of representations, or even just determine whether any representations exist. The examples above discuss the representation problem for the numbers 3 and 65 by the form x^2 + y^2 and for the number 1 by the form x^2 - 2y^2. We see that 65 is represented by x^2 + y^2 in sixteen different ways, while 1 is represented by x^2 - 2y^2 in infinitely many ways and 3 is not represented by x^2+y^2 at all. In the first case, the sixteen representations were explicitly described. It was also shown that the number of representations of an integer by x^2+y^2 is always finite. The sum of squares function r_2(n) gives the number of representations of n by x^2+y^2 as a function of n. There is a closed formula : r_2(n) = 4(d_1(n) - d_3(n)), where d_1(n) is the number of divisors of n that are congruent to 1 modulo 4 and d_3(n) is the number of divisors of n that are congruent to 3 modulo 4. There are several class invariants relevant to the representation problem: * The set of integers represented by a class. If an integer n is represented by a form in a class, then it is represented by all other forms in a class. * The minimum absolute value represented by a class. This is the smallest nonnegative value in the set of integers represented by a class. * The congruence classes modulo the discriminant of a class represented by the class. The minimum absolute value represented by a class is zero for degenerate classes and positive for definite and indefinite classes. All numbers represented by a definite form f = ax^2 + bxy + cy^2 have the same sign: positive if a>0 and negative if a<0. For this reason, the former are called positive definite forms and the latter are negative definite. The number of representations of an integer n by a form f is finite if f is definite and infinite if f is indefinite. We saw instances of this in the examples above: x^2+y^2 is positive definite and x^2 - 2y^2 is indefinite.  Equivalent representations  The notion of equivalence of forms can be extended to equivalent representations. Representations m = f(x_1,y_1) and n = g(x_2,y_2) are equivalent if there exists a matrix : \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\alpha & \\\\beta \\\\ \\\\gamma & \\\\delta \\\\end{pmatrix} with integer entries and determinant 1 so that f(\\\\alpha x + \\\\beta y, \\\\gamma x + \\\\delta y) = g(x,y) and : \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\delta& -\\\\beta \\\\ -\\\\gamma & \\\\alpha\\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\\\ y_1 \\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} x_2 \\\\ y_2 \\\\end{pmatrix} The above conditions give a (right) action of the group \\\\mathrm{SL}_2(\\\\mathbb{Z}) on the set of representations of integers by binary quadratic forms. It follows that equivalence defined this way is an equivalence relation and in particular that the forms in equivalent representations are equivalent forms. As an example, let f = x^2 - 2y^2 and consider a representation 1 = f(x_1,y_1). Such a representation is a solution to the Pell equation described in the examples above. The matrix : \\\\begin{pmatrix} 3 & -4 \\\\ -2 & 3 \\\\end{pmatrix} has determinant 1 and is an automorphism of f. Acting on the representation 1 = f(x_1,y_1) by this matrix yields the equivalent representation 1 = f(3x_1 + 4y_1, 2x_1 + 3 y_1). This is the recursion step in the process described above for generating infinitely many solutions to 1 = x^2 - 2y^2. Iterating this matrix action, we find that the infinite set of representations of 1 by f that were determined above are all equivalent. There are generally finitely many equivalence classes of representations of an integer n by forms of given nonzero discriminant \\\\Delta. A complete set of representatives for these classes can be given in terms of reduced forms defined in the section below. When \\\\Delta < 0, every representation is equivalent to a unique representation by a reduced form, so a complete set of representatives is given by the finitely many representations of n by reduced forms of discriminant \\\\Delta. When \\\\Delta > 0, Zagier proved that every representation of a positive integer n by a form of discriminant \\\\Delta is equivalent to a unique representation n = f(x,y) in which f is reduced in Zagier's sense and x > 0, y \\\\geq 0. The set of all such representations constitutes a complete set of representatives for equivalence classes of representations.  Reduction and class numbers  Lagrange proved that for every value D, there are only finitely many classes of binary quadratic forms with discriminant D. Their number is the ' of discriminant D. He described an algorithm, called reduction', for constructing a canonical representative in each class, the reduced form, whose coefficients are the smallest in a suitable sense. Gauss gave a superior reduction algorithm in Disquisitiones Arithmeticae, which ever since has been the reduction algorithm most commonly given in textbooks. In 1981, Zagier published an alternative reduction algorithm which has found several uses as an alternative to Gauss's.  Composition  Composition most commonly refers to a binary operation on primitive equivalence classes of forms of the same discriminant, one of the deepest discoveries of Gauss, which makes this set into a finite abelian group called the form class group (or simply class group) of discriminant \\\\Delta. Class groups have since become one of the central ideas in algebraic number theory. From a modern perspective, the class group of a fundamental discriminant \\\\Delta is isomorphic to the narrow class group of the quadratic field \\\\mathbf{Q}(\\\\sqrt{\\\\Delta}) of discriminant \\\\Delta. For negative \\\\Delta, the narrow class group is the same as the ideal class group, but for positive \\\\Delta it may be twice as big. \\"Composition\\" also sometimes refers to, roughly, a binary operation on binary quadratic forms. The word \\"roughly\\" indicates two caveats: only certain pairs of binary quadratic forms can be composed, and the resulting form is not well-defined (although its equivalence class is). The composition operation on equivalence classes is defined by first defining composition of forms and then showing that this induces a well- defined operation on classes. \\"Composition\\" can also refer to a binary operation on representations of integers by forms. This operation is substantially more complicated than composition of forms, but arose first historically. We will consider such operations in a separate section below. Composition means taking 2 quadratic forms of the same discriminant and combining them to create a quadratic form of the same discriminant, it is a generalization of the 2-square identity \\\\left(a^2 + b^2\\\\right)\\\\left(c^2 + d^2\\\\right) = \\\\left(ac-bd\\\\right)^2 + \\\\left(ad+bc\\\\right)^2  Composing forms and classes  A variety of definitions of composition of forms has been given, often in an attempt to simplify the extremely technical and general definition of Gauss. We present here Arndt's method, because it remains rather general while being simple enough to be amenable to computations by hand. An alternative definition is described at Bhargava cubes. Suppose we wish to compose forms f_1 = A_1 x^2 + B_1 xy + C_1 y^2 and f_2 = A_2 x^2 + B_2 xy + C_2 y^2, each primitive and of the same discriminant \\\\Delta. We perform the following steps: # Compute B_\\\\mu = \\\\tfrac{B_1 + B_2}{2} and e = \\\\gcd(A_1, A_2, B_\\\\mu), and A = \\\\tfrac{A_1 A_2}{e^2} # Solve the system of congruences > \\\\begin{align} x &\\\\equiv B_1 \\\\pmod{2 \\\\tfrac{A_1}{e}}\\\\ x &\\\\equiv B_2 \\\\pmod{2 > \\\\tfrac{A_2}{e}}\\\\ \\\\tfrac{B_\\\\mu}{e} x &\\\\equiv \\\\tfrac{\\\\Delta + B_1 B_2}{2e} > \\\\pmod{2A} \\\\end{align} It can be shown that this system always has a unique integer solution modulo 2A. We arbitrarily choose such a solution and call it B. # Compute C such that \\\\Delta = B^2 - 4AC. It can be shown that C is an integer. The form Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 is \\"the\\" composition of f_1 and f_2. We see that its first coefficient is well-defined, but the other two depend on the choice of B and C. One way to make this a well-defined operation is to make an arbitrary convention for how to choose B‚Äîfor instance, choose B to be the smallest positive solution to the system of congruences above. Alternatively, we may view the result of composition, not as a form, but as an equivalence class of forms modulo the action of the group of matrices of the form : \\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & n\\\\ 0 & 1\\\\end{pmatrix}, where n is an integer. If we consider the class of Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 under this action, the middle coefficients of the forms in the class form a congruence class of integers modulo 2A. Thus, composition gives a well- defined function from pairs of binary quadratic forms to such classes. It can be shown that if f_1 and f_2 are equivalent to g_1 and g_2 respectively, then the composition of f_1 and f_2 is equivalent to the composition of g_1 and g_2. It follows that composition induces a well-defined operation on primitive classes of discriminant \\\\Delta, and as mentioned above, Gauss showed these classes form a finite abelian group. The identity class in the group is the unique class containing all forms x^2 + Bxy + Cy^2, i.e., with first coefficient 1. (It can be shown that all such forms lie in a single class, and the restriction \\\\Delta \\\\equiv 0 \\\\text{ or } 1 \\\\pmod{4} implies that there exists such a form of every discriminant.) To invert a class, we take a representative Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 and form the class of Ax^2 - Bxy + Cy^2. Alternatively, we can form the class of Cx^2 + Bxy + Ay^2 since this and Ax^2 - Bxy + Cy^2 are equivalent.  Genera of binary quadratic forms  Gauss also considered a coarser notion of equivalence, with each coarse class called a genus of forms. Each genus is the union of a finite number of equivalence classes of the same discriminant, with the number of classes depending only on the discriminant. In the context of binary quadratic forms, genera can be defined either through congruence classes of numbers represented by forms or by genus characters defined on the set of forms. A third definition is a special case of the genus of a quadratic form in n variables. This states that forms are in the same genus if they are locally equivalent at all rational primes (including the Archimedean place).  History  There is circumstantial evidence of protohistoric knowledge of algebraic identities involving binary quadratic forms. The first problem concerning binary quadratic forms asks for the existence or construction of representations of integers by particular binary quadratic forms. The prime examples are the solution of Pell's equation and the representation of integers as sums of two squares. Pell's equation was already considered by the Indian mathematician Brahmagupta in the 7th century CE. Several centuries later, his ideas were extended to a complete solution of Pell's equation known as the chakravala method, attributed to either of the Indian mathematicians Jayadeva or BhƒÅskara II. The problem of representing integers by sums of two squares was considered in the 3rd century by Diophantus. In the 17th century, inspired while reading Diophantus's Arithmetica, Fermat made several observations about representations by specific quadratic forms including that which is now known as Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares. Euler provided the first proofs of Fermat's observations and added some new conjectures about representations by specific forms, without proof. The general theory of quadratic forms was initiated by Lagrange in 1775 in his Recherches d'Arithm√©tique. Lagrange was the first to realize that \\"a coherent general theory required the simulatenous consideration of all forms.\\" He was the first to recognize the importance of the discriminant and to define the essential notions of equivalence and reduction, which, according to Weil, have \\"dominated the whole subject of quadratic forms ever since\\". Lagrange showed that there are finitely many equivalence classes of given discriminant, thereby defining for the first time an arithmetic class number. His introduction of reduction allowed the quick enumeration of the classes of given discriminant and foreshadowed the eventual development of infrastructure. In 1798, Legendre published Essai sur la th√©orie des nombres, which summarized the work of Euler and Lagrange and added some of his own contributions, including the first glimpse of a composition operation on forms. The theory was vastly extended and refined by Gauss in Section V of Disquisitiones Arithmeticae. Gauss introduced a very general version of a composition operator that allows composing even forms of different discriminants and imprimitive forms. He replaced Lagrange's equivalence with the more precise notion of proper equivalence, and this enabled him to show that the primitive classes of given discriminant form a group under the composition operation. He introduced genus theory, which gives a powerful way to understand the quotient of the class group by the subgroup of squares. (Gauss and many subsequent authors wrote 2b in place of b; the modern convention allowing the coefficient of xy to be odd is due to Eisenstein). These investigations of Gauss strongly influenced both the arithmetical theory of quadratic forms in more than two variables and the subsequent development of algebraic number theory, where quadratic fields are replaced with more general number fields. But the impact was not immediate. Section V of Disquisitiones contains truly revolutionary ideas and involves very complicated computations, sometimes left to the reader. Combined, the novelty and complexity made Section V notoriously difficult. Dirichlet published simplifications of the theory that made it accessible to a broader audience. The culmination of this work is his text Vorlesungen √ºber Zahlentheorie. The third edition of this work includes two supplements by Dedekind. Supplement XI introduces ring theory, and from then on, especially after the 1897 publication of Hilbert's Zahlbericht, the theory of binary quadratic forms lost its preeminent position in algebraic number theory and became overshadowed by the more general theory of algebraic number fields. Even so, work on binary quadratic forms with integer coefficients continues to the present. This includes numerous results about quadratic number fields, which can often be translated into the language of binary quadratic forms, but also includes developments about forms themselves or that originated by thinking about forms, including Shanks's infrastructure, Zagier's reduction algorithm, Conway's topographs, and Bhargava's reinterpretation of composition through Bhargava cubes.

Carnival glass is moulded or pressed glass to which an iridescent surface shimmer has been applied. The keys to its appeal were that it looked superficially like the much finer and much more expensive blown iridescent glass by Tiffany, Loetz and others and also that the cheerful bright finish caught the light even in dark corners of the home. Both functional and ornamental objects were produced in the carnival finish and patterns ranged from simple through geometric and 'cut' styles to pictorial and figurative. A wide range of colours and colour combinations were used but the most common colours accounted for a large proportion of output, so scarce colours can today command very high prices on the collector market. Carnival glass has been known by many other names in the past: aurora glass, dope glass, rainbow glass, taffeta glass, and disparagingly as 'poor man's Tiffany'. Its current name was adopted by collectors in the 1950s from the fact that it was sometimes given as prizes at carnivals, fetes, and fairgrounds. However, that can be misleading as people tend to think that all of it was distributed in this way but evidence suggests that the vast majority of it was purchasedCarnival Glass, The Magic and The Mystery. Glen & Stephen Thistlewood, Schiffer Publishing, 2008 by the housewife to brighten up the home at a time when only the well-off could afford bright electric lighting. Some carnival glass is still produced today although in very small quantities. At the height of its popularity in the 1920s huge volumes were produced and prices were low enough for the ordinary home to afford. Starting at the beginning of the 20th century, carnival glass was eventually produced on every continent except Africa and Antarctica but largely and initially in the U.S.. All the major European glass making centres except Italy produced some and it was very popular in Australia. Carnival glass gets its iridescent sheen from the application of metallic salts while the glass is still hot from the pressing. A final firing of the glass brings out the iridescent properties of the salts, giving carnival glass the distinct shine it is known for. History Carnival glass originated as a glass called 'Iridill', produced beginning in 1908 by the Fenton Art Glass Company (founded in 1905). Iridill was inspired by the fine blown art glass of such makers as Tiffany and Steuben, but did not sell at the anticipated premium prices and was subsequently discounted. After these markdowns, Iridill pieces were used as carnival prizes. Iridill became popular and very profitable for Fenton, which produced many different types of items in this finish, in over 150 patterns. Fenton maintained their position as the largest manufacturer and were one of very few makers to use a red coloured glass base for their carnival glass. After interest waned in the late 1920s, Fenton stopped producing carnival glass for many years. In more recent years, due to a resurgence in interest, Fenton restarted production of carnival glass until its closure in 2007. Most U.S. carnival glass was made before 1925, with production in clear decline after 1931. Some important production continued outside the US through the depression years of the early 1930s, tapering off to very little by the 1940s. Often the same moulds were used to produce clear and transparent coloured glass as well as carnival versions, so producers could switch production between these finishes easily according to demand. Variations=Colours Carnival glass was made in a wide array of colours, shades, colour combinations and variants. More than fifty have been formally classified. These classifications do not go by the surface colours showing, which can be even more varied, but by the 'base' colours of the glass before application of the iridizing mineral salts. In order to establish the base colour you have to find an area of the item which had no mineral salts applied, which is usually the base, and hold the item up to the light in such a way that you can see through that area. This is usually easy enough to do, but it can still be difficult for the inexperienced to differentiate the exact base colour between the many possibilities as there are often only subtle differences, as well as variations. The final (post doping) surface shades also vary according to the depth of base colour, as well as any special treatments and the type and amount of salts used. This last variable caused significant variation to occur, even between batches of what should have been essentially the same colour or colour-way. This happened most frequently in early production but to such an extent that collectors now differentiate between these items, describing the degree of iridescence showing. The most popular colour for carnival glass is now known by collectors as 'marigold' although that name was not in use at the time. Marigold has a clear glass base and is the most easily recognizable carnival colour. The final surface colours of marigold are mostly a bright orange-gold turning perhaps to copper with small areas showing rainbow or 'oil-slick' highlights. The highlights appear mostly on ridges in the pattern and vary in strength according to the light. Marigold carnival glass is the most frequently found colour and in general commands lower prices in the collector market. However, variants of marigold such as those based on 'moonstone', a translucent white, and 'milk glass', an opaque white base, can be more sought after. Other base colours include; amethyst, a reddish purple; blue, green, red and amber. These basic colours are then further delineated by shade; depth of colour; colour combinations such as 'amberina'; colour pattern such as 'slag'; special treatments such as 'opalescent' and finally luminescence such as that given off by 'vaseline glass' or 'uranium glass' under ultra violet light (blacklight). Shapes Carnival Glass was produced in a wide variety of items, from utilitarian to the purely decorative. Even within groups of items a variety of shapes can be found with further variation in edging and bases as well as different treatments of the basic shape while still malleable fresh from the mould. For example, of three items coming from the same mould, one could be left as is, another folded inwards and the third splayed outwards. Edge styles varied from plain to include frilled after moulding, or pie crust, furrowed or bullet,The Art of Carnival Glass. Glen & Stephen Thistlewood, Schiffer Publishing, 2008 as a part of the mould pattern. The basic items produced included bowls, plates, vases, jugs or pitchers and tumblers but many other more specialised items of tableware were made also. These included large centre piece items such as jardini√®res and float bowlsThe Art of Carnival Glass. Glen & Stephen Thistlewood, Schiffer Publishing, 2008, as well as smaller useful items such as butter dishes, celery vases and cruet sets. In smaller numbers and less often found are items to do with lighting or associated with smoking and those designed solely for show as ornaments such as figural sculptures or statuettes. Patterns Example of a green Northwood Wishbone bowl. Carnival glass was produced in large quantities in the US by the Fenton, Northwood, Imperial, Millersburg, Westmoreland (also began producing in 1908), Dugan/Diamond, Cambridge, and U.S. Glass companies as well as many smaller manufacturers. Competition became so fierce that new patterns were continually being developed, so each company ended up making a wide range of patterns of most types adding up to a panoply of choice. By selling sample pieces to carnival fair operators, it was hoped that a winner would then go on to purchase further items in the same or a similar pattern. Pressed glass 'blancs' were brought in and iridized by third parties as well. Different and in many cases highly distinctive carnival glass patterns were designed and made by non-US makers, most notably by Crown Crystal of Australia, now famed for their depiction of that continent's distinctive fauna and flora in their glass. Sowerby (England) are notable for their use of swan, hen and dolphin figural pieces in carnival finish as well as pieces which have figural parts such as bird figured legs. There is even a figural boat. Of their non-figural production, the strong, bold and easily recognizable 'African Shield', 'King James' and 'Drape' patterns provided a good canvas for shimmering carnival colours. German production of carnival was dominated by the Brockwitz glassworks, with mainly geometric patterns which take their cues from cut glass. Other major European makers included Inwald (Czechoslovakia),A Century of Carnival Glass. Glen & Stephen Thistlewood, Schiffer Publishing, 2001 Eda glasbruk (Sweden) and Riihim√§ki (Finland). These again produced cut glass styles and simple geometrics with a few floral patterns. However, the most distinctive continental European patterns are probably the similarly styled 'Classic Arts' & 'Egyptian Queen', produced by the Czech Rindskopf works, sporting stained bands of figures over a very simple geometric form in a very even marigold. In other parts of the world most notable are the Argentinian Cristalerias Rigolleau for their innovative and highly distinctive ash trays and Cristalerias Piccardo for their highly desirable 'Jewelled Peacock Tail' vase.\\"David Doty's Carnival Glass Website\\" http://www.ddoty.com Finally, the Indian Jain company should not go unmentioned, notable for their distinctive elephant, fish and hand figural sections incorporated into the body of trumpet shaped vases and for their desirable and highly complex goddess vases. Collectibles market Carnival glass is highly collectible. Prices vary widely, with some pieces worth very little, while other, rare items command thousands of dollars. Examples of carnival glass can be easily found in antique stores and eBay. Identification of carnival glass is frequently difficult. Many manufacturers did not include a maker's mark on their product, and some did for only part of the time they produced the glass. Identifying carnival glass involves matching patterns, colours, sheen, edges, thickness, and other factors from old manufacturer's trade catalogs, other known examples, or other reference material. Since many manufacturers produced close copies of their rivals' popular patterns, carnival glass identification can be challenging even for an expert.

Catholicism A feature of Catholic spiritual marriage, or Josephite marriage, is that the agreement to abstain from sex should be a free mutual decision, rather than resulting from impotence or the views of one party. In senses beyond spiritual marriage, chastity is a key concept of Church doctrine that demands celibacy of priests, monks, nuns and certain other officials in the Church. The doctrine established a \\"spiritual marriage\\" of church officials to their church; in order to better serve God, one had to disavow the demands and temptations of traditional marriage. This rule was enforced by Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor, whose marriage to Cunigunde of Luxemburg was also a very famous spiritual marriage. Saints Louis and Z√©lie Martin professed to enter a spiritual marriage, but consummated a year later when directed by their confessor to do so. Of their nine children the five who survived to adulthood all became nuns, including Saint Th√©r√®se de Lisieux. Occasionally, spiritual marriages may also be entered later in life, with the renunciation of sexual relations after raising a family to fully dedicate oneself to God. In October 2001, John Paul II beatified a married couple, Luigi Beltrame Quattrocchi and Maria Corsini, who bore four children, but later in life lived separately and committed to a Josephite marriage.Models of holiness and married life: couple's beatification spotlights marital sanctity - Luigi and Maria Beltrame Quattrocchi See also *Asexuality *Bride of Christ *Josephines *Mariage blanc *Mystical marriage *Peijainen *Platonic love *Romantic friendship *Saint Joseph *Sexual abstinence *Spiritual friendship (disambiguation) *Spiritual wifery *Sexless marriage *Yogic marriage  References Further reading *Elliot, D. : Spiritual Marriage: Sexual Abstinence in Medieval Wedlock.

He was twice world professional road race champion, and was the first cyclist to win all five 'Monuments': the most prestigious one-day classics ‚Äì a feat since achieved by just two others (both also Belgians: Roger De Vlaeminck and Eddy Merckx). With 379 road victories he's second to Merckx only. He is ninth on the all-time list of Grand Tour stage winners with thirty-seven victories. Career Van Looy in 2010 Van Looy rose to prominence when he won the Belgian amateur road championship in 1952. He repeated the victory the following year, adding third place in the world title race the same year, before turning professional. At the 1952 Summer Olympics, he won a gold medal in the team road race event. A powerful sprinter, Van Looy won two races in what was left of his first professional season (1953), and 20 more over the next couple of seasons. In 1956, his victories included Gent‚ÄìWevelgem and Paris‚ÄìBrussels, plus two stages and overall victory in the Tour of the Netherlands. He also won a silver medal in the world road race championship, behind his countryman Rik Van Steenbergen. He repeated his Gent‚ÄìWevelgem and Tour of the Netherlands victories in 1957, and in 1958 won the season's opening classic, Milan‚ÄìSan Remo. 1959 saw Van Looy take the early-season Tour of Flanders and the autumn classic, the Giro di Lombardia. In between, he scored another 38 victories, including three stages of the Vuelta a Espa√±a (finishing third overall and winner of the points competition) and four stages of the Giro d'Italia (for 4th overall). In 1960, he scored the first of two consecutive victories in the world road race championship, but Classic victories eluded him. However, he made up for this in 1961, winning both Paris‚ÄìRoubaix and Li√®ge‚ÄìBastogne‚ÄìLi√®ge ‚Äì making him the first rider to take all five 'Monuments' ‚Äì as well as retaining his rainbow world title jersey, and taking three stages, plus the mountains competition, in the Giro. Van Looy scored two more Classic wins in 1962 (Paris‚ÄìRoubaix, Tour of Flanders), took another Gent‚ÄìWevelgem, and two more Giro stages. In 1963 Van Looy rode the Tour de France, taking four stages en route to victory in the points competition and a 10th place on general classification; he also grabbed a silver in the world title race. In the latter race, held in Ronse in his native Belgium, he was beaten in the sprint by his countryman Benoni Beheyt. Van Looy, starting the sprint too early, did not take this defeat lightly. This race has remained memorable in the history of Belgian cycling. In 1965, he scored 42 victories including Paris‚ÄìRoubaix, and eight stages of the Vuelta on his way to his second third place overall (his highest placing in a Grand Tour). For good measure, he also took two stages in the Tour de France. During the final years of his career (1966‚Äì1970), Van Looy's road performances began to fade, as the new Belgian star Eddy Merckx rose to prominence, but he still grabbed second in the 1967 Paris‚ÄìRoubaix, won La Fl√®che Wallonne in 1968, and took a stage of the 1969 Tour de France. His rivalry with Eddy Merckx reached the height of sabotage of Merckx in the world championships in 1969. Van Looy was also a star on the track, winning 11 Six-day races. His first came in Brussels in 1957, his last in Antwerp in 1968. For nine of these victories, he was paired with Dutchman Peter Post.

Early walkways consisted of bridges between trees in the canopy of a forest; mostly linked up with platforms inside or around the trees. They were originally intended as access to the upper regions of ancient forests for scientists conducting canopy research. Eventually, because they provided only limited, one-dimensional access to the trees, they were abandoned for canopy cranes. Today they serve as ecotourism attractions in places such as Dhlinza Forest, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, Taman Negara National Park, Malaysia, Sedim River, Kulim, Nyungwe National Park, Rwanda and Kakum National Park, Ghana.  Australia  Tahune Airwalk, Tasmania Canopy or treetop walkways are especially popular attractions in Australia. They can be found in most states and a variety of environments. Tasmania The Tahune AirWalk is located in state forest near Geeveston in southern Tasmania. Opened in 2001 it consists of a 619-metre-long elevated walkway incorporating a 37-metre-high observation tower and a cantilever 50 metres above the Huon River.

The game is a side-scrolling platform game. The main character, Malvineous Havershim, must journey through strange landscapes as he seeks to destroy the evil Xargon. Gameplay The basic goal of Xargon is to advance through the map by completing levels. To finish a level, the player must find and reach the exit, which is found by traversing throughout the level. Initially, Malvineous is armed with a \\"laser bullet\\", allowing only one shot on-screen at a time which can be controlled by pressing up or down, in which the laser bullet will slightly advance upwards or downwards. Other weapons include more laser bolts which allows Malvineous to shoot more often, rapid fire, rocks which can be thrown more strategically, and powerful fireballs which destroy every enemy in their path. Xargon is unique in the sense that the player can purchase items at any point during the game. Emeralds are randomly placed in most levels. Purchasable items include health units, invincibility, and weapon upgrades. In most of the levels there are gift boxes, that either explode when shot or contain fruit, other valuable items or nothing. Points are earned by collecting fruit, killing monsters, and collecting the four EPIC pool balls. More points are earned if the EPIC pool balls are collected in order. Malvineous can take 5 hits, and if he dies the player must start the level over again. His health can be restored by collecting a beating heart or collecting 16 fruits which restores one health unit or purchasing a health unit. Spike pits, water, acid and various other dangers kill Malvineous instantly if he touches them. Plot Malvineous Havershim is an archaeologist studying strange ruins in Madagascar. The ruins were built by an unknown ancient culture known as the 'Blue Builders'. While attempting to translate the glyphs on the walls of one Blue Builder structure, a strange gas is emitted, and Malvineous loses consciousness. Malvineous has a dream-encounter with a talking eagle, who gives him cryptic warnings. He awakes in a strange land, the area in which the game takes place. Development Xargon, produced and released by Epic MegaGames 1993, was programmed by Allen Pilgrim. The graphics were created by Joe Hitchens, who also contributed to Epic Pinball and Jill of the Jungle. Volume One: Beyond Reality was released as shareware, but Volume Two: The Secret Chamber and Volume Three: Xargon's Fury had to be purchased commercially. The game was a contemporary of such games as Id Software's Commander Keen and Apogee Software's Duke Nukem II.

The woman with the keys to all the many desks, chest of drawers, food hampers, pantries, storage containers, and many other locked cabinets was \\"the woman of the household\\". As such, she was the one who would direct the servants, housemaids, cooks and delivery servicemen and would open or lock the access to the valuables of the house, possessing total authority over who had access to what. Frequently, this hostess was the senior woman of the house. When a woman married and moved into her father-in-law's house, her husband's mother would usually hold on to the keys. However, if the mother became a widow, the keys and their responsibilities and status were often passed to the oldest son's wife. Younger women and daughters in the house often wanted the appearance of this responsibility, and would often wear decorative chatelaines with a variety of small objects in the place of keys, especially bright and glittering objects that could be used to start a conversation.Smith, Albert, Paul Gavarni, and John Gilbert.

Early life Robert Clay was educated at Bedford School and Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. Unusually for a man of his background, he went on to become a bus driver, working for Tyne and Wear PTE from 1975 to 1983. Clay first joined Labour as a teenager, but left to join the Trotskyist group International Socialists. He became a union shop steward in the 1980s and rejoined Labour. Parliamentary career Clay was first elected to Parliament in 1983 for the Sunderland North constituency, replacing Labour MP Frederick Willey, was re-elected in 1987, but stood down at the 1992 general election, where Labour MP William Etherington was elected in his place. Subsequent political activities Clay opposed the 2003 Iraq War. He backed the left-wing party RESPECT The Unity Coalition in the 2004 European Elections. At the 2005 general election, he acted as agent for Reg Keys, who stood against the Prime Minister Tony Blair in Blair's Sedgefield constituency on an anti-war ticket. Keys' son Tom had been killed in action in Iraq. Although Clay was not an originator of Keys' campaign he used his position as agent to control all aspects of the campaign. He persuaded Derek Cattell, a former trade union officer and an executive member of Blair's Sedgefield Labour Party to join the campaign. Cattell's resignation from Labour during the election campaign, produced much publicity for the Keys campaign. Clay worked tirelessly for the Keys campaign helping build a coalition of support for Keys. Supporters included the former MP Martin Bell who in his book, The Truth that Sticks (2007) wrote \\"Of great value was Derek Cattell, formerly on the executive of Sedgefield Labour Party. He defected to Reg's campaign after some heart searching; it cost him some fair weather friends, but the candidate had no loyal supporter from start to finish.\\" (page 103) Clay went on to live in the Marches city of Hereford and remains politically active as a volunteer official in the local Labour Party. He has involved himself in a number of local causes including a group opposed to the building of a by-pass which would disturb ancient archaeological remains known as The Dinedor Serpent. He now lives in the Llansamlet ward of Swansea East, where on 4 July 2013 he was elected, in a by election, as a Labour Party councillor for the City and County of Swansea Council. His wife, Uta Clay, served as a councillor for the same council but both stood down at the 2017 election.

The continuous state of change in forests can be summarized with two basic elements: disturbance and succession. Disturbance Forest disturbances are events that cause change in the structure and composition of a forest ecosystem, beyond the growth and death of individual organisms. Disturbances can vary in frequency and intensity, and include natural disasters such as fire, landslides, wind, volcanic eruptions, rare meteor impacts, outbreaks of insects, fungi, and other pathogens, animal- caused effects such as grazing and trampling, and anthropogenic disturbances such as warfare, logging, pollution, the clearing of land for urbanization or agriculture, and the introduction of invasive species. Not all disturbances are destructive or negative to the overall forest ecosystem. Many natural disturbances allow for renewal and growth and often release necessary nutrients. Small-scale disturbances are the key to creating and maintaining diversity and heterogeneity within a forest. Small-scale disturbances are events such as single-tree blowdowns, which create gaps that let light through the canopy to the understory and forest floor. This available light allows early-successional shade-intolerant species to colonize and maintain a population within the dominant forest, leading to the complex spatial mosaic forest structure recognized as old-growth. This process is referred to as patch dynamics or gap dynamics and has been described across many types of forests, including tropical, temperate, and boreal. The sets and patterns of natural disturbances that characterize a particular area or ecosystem are referred to as the ecosystem's disturbance regime. A natural community is closely linked with its natural disturbance regime. For example, temperate and boreal rainforests typically have a disturbance regime consisting of high- frequency but small-scale events, resulting in a highly complex forest dominated by very old trees. In contrast, forests that have a disturbance regime consisting of high-severity stand-replacing events, such as frequent fires, tend to be more uniform in structure and have relatively young tree stands. Succession Forest succession is the process by which species recover and regenerate after a disturbance. The type of disturbance, the climate and weather conditions, the presence of colonizing species, and the interactions among species all influence the path that succession will take. Species diversity and composition fluctuate throughout succession. The classic model of succession is known as relay floristics and refers to a relay of dominant species. After a stand-replacing disturbance, shade-intolerant species colonize and grow into a dominant canopy, but due to their shade- intolerance they are unable to regenerate under their own canopy; the understory (composed of shade-tolerant species) gradually replaces the canopy, and due to its shade-tolerance it can regenerate under its own canopy and therefore becomes the dominant species. Often succession is not so complete or directed as the relay floristics model describes. Species can be mid-tolerant of shade and survive by taking advantage of small amounts of light coming through the canopy, and further disturbances can create small gaps. These and other factors can lead to a mixture of dominant species and a not so obvious ‚Äúend‚Äù to succession (climax community). Many successional trajectories follow a basic four-stage development pattern. The first of these stages, stand initiation, occurs after a major disturbance and involves many species arriving in the area of abundant light and nutrients. The second stage, stem exclusion, describes the growth and competition of these species as resources become less available; likely one or a few species outcompetes and becomes stand-dominating. The third stage, understory reinitiation, involves further disturbance and the creation of gaps; at this point stratification develops, with layers of canopy, midstory, and understory appearing. The final stage, known as old-growth, is the extension and completion of the understory reinititation; a complex multi-aged and multi-layered forest has developed. Considering climate change Forests are sensitive to climate, and so climate change can have a great effect on the dynamics of the ecosystem. Rising carbon dioxide levels can increase the productivity and growth of trees, which will then decrease as other nutrients become limiting. Changes in temperature and precipitation can affect the success of various species and the resulting species assemblage. Many factors of climate change can also affect an ecosystem‚Äôs disturbance regime, making the forest more or less susceptible to different disturbances and altering or even preventing recovery after a disturbance. Importance Forests offer many ecosystem services including timber, fresh water, carbon storage, and areas of recreation. To conserve these services, along with the natural habitat and biodiversity that forests provide, understanding the dynamics that are creating and maintaining the forests is a priority. Forestry and silviculture operations require a thorough comprehension of forest dynamics in order to implement effective management and conservation techniques.

The regiment was formed by the amalgamation of the 15th The King's Hussars and the 19th Royal Hussars in 1922 and, after service in the Second World War, it was amalgamated with the 13th/18th Royal Hussars to form the Light Dragoons in 1992. History=Second World War Covenanter tanks of 15th/19th The King's Royal Hussars on parade at Wellingborough for inspection by Alexander Cadogan, 1 November 1941 A Cromwell tank of 15th/19th The King's Royal Hussars advances through the rubble of Uedem, 28 February 1945 The regiment was created, as part of the reduction in cavalry in the aftermath of the First World War, by the amalgamation of the 15th The King's Hussars and the 19th Royal Hussars on 11 April 1922 to form the 15th/19th Hussars. It briefly dropped the 19th numeral from its title in October 1932, becoming the 15th The King's Royal Hussars, before regaining it in December 1933. At the outbreak of the Second World War, the regiment was based at York, serving as the divisional reconnaissance regiment for the 3rd Infantry Division.Joslen, pp. 43‚Äì4 The regiment was deployed with the division as part of the British Expeditionary Force, and fought in the Battle of France: it suffered heavy losses during the German advance and, having left all its armour and vehicles behind, took part in the Dunkirk evacuation. Following the withdrawal, the regiment was assigned to the 3rd Motor Machine Gun Brigade, which was redesignated as the 28th Armoured Brigade and assigned to the 9th Armoured Division. A cadre was detached to form the 23rd Hussars in December 1940. The regiment remained in the United Kingdom until August 1944, when it was dispatched to France to serve as the divisional reconnaissance regiment for the 11th Armoured Division. Post war The Regiment was deployed to Palestine in December 1945 and then to Sudan in November 1947. It moved to Knightsbridge Barracks in L√ºbeck in October 1949 and to McLeod Barracks in Neum√ºnster in November 1951. It became the recce regiment for 7th Armoured Division and relocated to Combermere Barracks in Wesendorf in March 1953. In June 1954, it deployed to Malaya, with regimental headquarters and one squadron based at Ipoh and the other squadrons at Taiping and Raub, during the Malayan Emergency. In June 1957, a troop was deployed to Muscat during the Jebel Akhdar War. The regiment then joined 39th Infantry Brigade, moving to Lisanelly Camp in Omagh in August 1957 and then became an armoured car training regiment based at Deerbolt Camp near Barnard Castle in May 1959. The regiment re-roled as a nuclear escort regiment based at Swinton Barracks in Munster in September 1961 and then moved to Bhurtpore Barracks at Tidworth Camp in January 1968. It returned to West Germany, where it joined 11th Infantry Brigade and moved to Wessex Barracks in Bad Fallingbostel in November 1969. It became the garrisoned regiment at Long Kesh in August 1971, following the introduction of internment of Provisional Irish Republican Army suspects. It transferred to Lisanelly Camp in Omagh in November 1974. It then moved to a recce role, equipped with Scorpion and Fox, for 5th Infantry Brigade based at Aliwal Barracks in Tidworth Camp in May 1976; from there it deployed squadrons for the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus. During this period, one squadron was deployed to Cyprus, equipped with Ferret Scout Cars, to serve as the resident armoured car squadron. In September 1977, the regiment was deployed back to Germany, where it was assigned to the 3rd Armoured Division and based at Alanbrooke Barracks in Paderborn: from there it continued to send units to Northern Ireland as part of Operation Banner and undertook guarding duties at the Maze Prison. In November 1984, the main body of the Regiment returned to England as the Royal Armoured Corps Training Regiment at Bovington Camp in Dorset, although a squadron was again deployed to Cyprus, equipped with Ferret Scout Cars, to serve as the resident armoured car squadron. As part of the post-Cold War defence reforms, the regiment was amalgamated with the 13th/18th Royal Hussars to form the Light Dragoons on 1 December 1992.

Patients with CRF19 may start getting sick before they even know they've been infected, which ultimately means there's a significantly shorter time span to stop the disease's progression. The researchers suspect that fragments of other subsets of the virus fasten to each other through an enzyme which makes the virus more powerful and more easily replicated in the body, thus the faster progression. 2016 * Researchers have found that an international study found that almost 2,000 patients with HIV failed to respond to the antiviral drug known as Tenofovir disoproxil.

It currently has a capacity of just under 1000MW and is owned and operated by Xcel Energy, the successor to the plant's founder, the Public Service Company of Colorado. It went online in this form in 1996. The facility was built originally as a nuclear power plant. It operated as a nuclear generating power plant from 1979 until 1989. Historical overview Fort Saint Vrain Generating Station was built as Colorado's first and only nuclear power plant, which operated from 1979 until 1989. It was one of two high temperature gas cooled (HTGR) power reactors in the United States. The primary coolant helium transferred heat to a water secondary coolant system to drive steam generators. The reactor fuel was a combination of fissile uranium and fertile thorium microspheres dispersed within a prismatic graphite matrix. The reactor had an electrical power output of 330MW (330 MWe), generated from a thermal power 842 MW (842 MWth). The Fort St. Vrain HTGR power plant was proposed in March 1965 and its application was filed with the Atomic Energy Commission in October 1966. Construction began in September 1968. The HTGR design was safer than typical boiling water designs of the time having steel-reinforced, pre-stressed concrete containment dome structures. It only needed a steel-frame containment structure, while the reactor core was partially contained within a prestressed concrete reactor pressure vessel (PCRV). The construction cost reached $200 million, or approximately $0.60/installed watt. Initial testing began in 1972 and the first commercial power was distributed in July 1979. The plant was technically successful, especially towards the very end of its operating life, but was a commercial disappointment to its owner. As one of the first commercial HTGR designs, the plant was a proof-of-concept for several advanced technologies, but had a number of early adopter problems that required expensive corrections. Maintenance problems exacerbated these and other issues. Unique features of the design Refueling floor at Fort St. Vrain Generating Station The Fort St. Vrain HTGR was substantially more efficient than modern light water reactors, reaching a thermal efficiency of 39-40%, excellent for a steam-cycle power plant. Operation of the HTGR design could be readily attenuated to follow the electrical power demand load, rather than be required to generate its nameplate power all the time. The reactor was also comparatively fuel efficient, with a maximum burn up of 90,000 MW days thermal (compared to Light Water Reactors with burn ups of 10,000 - 40,concept for the future. However, the problems that occurred leading to its debugging led to its early demise. Operational experience Many issues occurred early in the operational experience of the Fort St. Vrain HTGR. Although these issues were never a threat to the facility or to public safety, considerable stress was placed upon the personnel, equipment, and facilities and made continued operation appear uneconomical to the plant's owner. Most of the past issues had been resolved at considerable expense and the plant was beginning to perform at a commercially viable level when an economic downturn and the history of the plant caused the owner to shut it down even though it had not reached the end of its design lifetime. Three major categories of problems were experienced at Fort St. Vrain: first, water infiltration and corrosion issues; second, electrical system issues; and third, general facility issues. Water infiltration and corrosion issues (Helium circulators) Diagram of the PCRV (left) and helium circulator (right) of the Fort St. Vrain reactor Fort St. Vrain's largest problem was with the helium circulator. Helium's smaller molecules required very tight seals to prevent the gas from escaping. Some seals involved moving surfaces, and a water-lubricated bearing design was used to contain the helium. A gas cleaning system was provided to remove contaminants, including water, from the helium system. Design problems resulted in too much water in the helium system, leading to corrosion. The designers had intended for the water injectors to maintain pressure in the bearings about equal to the gas pressure in the system. In practice, the gas pressure varied more than expected, allowing excessive water to escape into the circulator. The capacity of the gas cleaning system did not account for the excess water from the bearings, and assumed that high-temperature reactions in the graphite reactor core would reduce the impact of residual water in the helium, based on the porosity of typical core graphite. The graphite used to construct Fort St. Vrain's core was higher grade and less porous, and thus did not present as much surface area for these reactions to occur. Although system safety was not compromised, frequent operation problems were experienced throughout the reactor systems due to water and corrosion. Ice formed on chiller units in the gas cleaning system, reducing their efficiency. When the reactor output was cycled down and the system cooled, water would condense on equipment and instruments within the helium system. Control rod drives rusted, and rapid shutdowns failed to operate correctly. The reserve shutdown system, which released borated graphite spheres into the core in the event of an Anticipated Transient Without SCRAM (ATWS), was sometimes unavailable because water had leached the boron to form boric acid, which softened the graphite spheres and caused them to clump together. Steel \\"tendons\\" within the PCRV experienced corrosion due to chloride precipitation and were weakened. Rust flecks migrated into the coolant and lodged in critical machinery, including control rod drives. Steam generator leaks also occurred due to corrosion. The design problems which led to the corrosion were partially the fault of the regulators, who were focused heavily on chemical reactions of steam with the high-grade core graphite and the impact on the gas cleaning system. It was arguable that the memorandums from Rockville, Maryland consumed excessive engineering resources and other design considerations had been overlooked as a result. Some of the blame for the corrosion problems also fell on the owner of FSV and its operations and maintenance procedures. For example, moisture alarms had generated alerts for months in critical parts of the plant, but these were disregarded as defective. Staff later sent to remove the allegedly-defective moisture alarms for repair discovered that the moisture alarms were not defective, and substantial amounts of water were sometimes released when the devices were removed from their fittings. Finally, the designers of the plant shared responsibility for not sizing the gas cleaning system to cope with excess water in the helium system, as they should have foreseen a possibility of excess water infiltration. They acknowledged this in hindsight: \\"The FSV circulators have 'met all design specifications', however, the bearings, seals, and support systems for the water-lubricated bearing have caused many problems. Further, the circulators employed a steam turbine drive that adds complexity to system operations. These unique design features resulted in water ingress to the core, the primary reason for poor plant availability.\\" Electrical system issues Operational diagram of the Fort St. Vrain high-temperature gas reactor The plant electrical system was challenged on numerous occasions, and the resolutions were frequently expensive. Transformers experienced faults. Backup generators sometimes failed to engage when activated, and on other occasions, side channel issues occurred during operation, preventing them from generating power. Failure of backup power also led to some of the moisture infiltration problems, by variously disrupting the logic of the bearing water injection systems and the helium circulator trip logic. Failures of transformers and consequent failure of backup power occurred on at least one occasion due to moisture infiltration into electric cables and subsequent ground faulting when the plant was at low power to remove water from previous moisture infiltration issues. It is believed that this electrical fault led to further moisture infiltration. General facilities issues Facility contractors introduced safety concerns on several occasions. In one of the more serious incidents, contractor personnel damaged hydraulic units, allowing hydraulic fluid to spray over reactor control cables. The same crew then performed welding operations to equipment located above the control cables. Hot slag fell onto the material used to contain the hydraulic fluid and ignited it, along with the fluid on the control cables. The fire involved the cables for five minutes, and 16 essential control cables were damaged. The contractor personnel then failed to inform plant personnel of the situation and the reactor was in operation for several hours in this condition. On another occasion, contractor personnel using improperly grounded welding apparatuses tripped neutron protection circuits, leading to a nuisance trip of the entire plant. Operational improvement and closure Due to the water-induced corrosion problems and electrical problems, plant shutdowns were common. As a result, Public Service Company of Colorado began to question the economics of continued commercial operation. An increase in performance was observed from 1987‚Äì1989, suggesting some of the problems had been worked out of the system, but Public Service was not persuaded. In 1989 Public Service indicated that the plant was under consideration for closure. Later that same year a critical part of the reactor was found to have long-term corrosion and required replacement. The replacement cost was deemed excessive and the plant was shut down. The decommissioning and removal of the fuel was completed by 1992. Fort St. Vrain thus became the first commercial-scale nuclear reactor in the US to be decommissioned. Analysis Lessons learned at Fort St. Vrain have led more recent reactor designs of the HTGR type to adopt different strategies to confront issues that occurred there. More recent HTGR designs have tended to avoid large per-unit cores (in favor of more compact modular units), tended to avoid concrete reactor pressure vessels (in favor of proven carbon or alloy steel reactor pressure vessels), and tended to avoid steam cycles without an intermediate non-water based circuit between the core and the steam generators. Others, such as the Adams Atomic Engine (using nitrogen), the Romawa Nereus (using helium), and General Atomics GT-MHR (using helium) have favored simplification of the high-temperature gas-cooled reactor concept as much as possible, down to practically a reactor and a gas turbine linked together with the reactor using a right-sized, inherently safe core with no water used in the plant design. The GT-MHR, however, is large enough that it has a system for residual heat removal using convected air. The reactor concept of Fort St. Vrain experienced a resurrection in form of AREVA's Antares reactor. This is a high temperature helium cooled modular reactor and thus is conceptually similar to the reactor at Fort St. Vrain. The INL approved AREVA's Allegro reactor as the chosen Next Generation Nuclear Power Plant (NGNP) to be deployed as prototype by 2021. Reuse as combustion power facility Following the reactor decommissioning, Fort St. Vrain was converted to a combustion facility. The first natural gas combustion turbine was installed in 1996. Two more turbines were installed by 2001. Heat recovery steam generators (HRSGs) allow the plant to operate in combined-cycle mode, in which waste heat recovered from combustion-turbine exhaust gases is used to make a second stage of steam capable of driving the facility's original steam turbine and generator. As of 2011, the nameplate generating capacity of the plant is 965MW.

From this fund claims, loans, etc., are paid. Profits after deductions are shared among the members. The institution is intended to provide a safe place for individual members to save and to invest those savings in mortgages, loans, stocks, bonds and other securities and to share in any profits or losses that result. The members own the business. History The institution most frequently identified as the first modern savings bank was the \\"Savings and Friendly Society\\" organized by the Reverend Henry Duncan in 1810, in Ruthwell, Scotland. Rev. Duncan established the small bank in order to encourage his working class congregation to develop thrift. Another precursor of modern savings banks were the ideas Friedrich Wilhelm Raiffeisen that led to rural credit unions and cooperative banks. European voluntary organizations and \\"friendly societies\\" provided the inspiration for their state incorporated American counterparts. These first savings banks were envisioned as philanthropic endeavors, designed to uplift the poor and working classes. The banks were started by philanthropists, who took on the positions of savings bank trustees, managers, and directors as opportunities to teach the working class the virtues of thrift, and self-reliance by allowing them the security to save their money. The first incorporated US mutual savings bank was the Provident Institution for Savings, in Boston. Its 1816 charter was the first government legislation in the world to safeguard savings banks. In 2015, the oldest (and largest) mutual bank in the U.S. is Eastern Bank of Boston, with approximately $10 billion in assets. It was chartered in 1818 in Salem, Massachusetts as the Salem Savings Bank. New Bedford Institution For Savings was founded in 1825, and converted from mutual to stock status in 1987. Since the 1970s, when the industry was deregulated, thousands of mutual savings banks have been converted into stock ownership companies, raising more than $40 billion. In 2010, only about 600 remained. These conversions have often resulted in large financial rewards for top bank executives. Current mutual saving banks include Eastern Bank, Dollar Bank, Ridgewood Savings Bank, Middlesex Savings Bank, and Liberty Bank.  Mutual banking in Australia  Beginning in the 1980s, several building societies in Australia converted to banks but were required to demutualise when doing so. These included Advance Bank (formerly NSW Building Society), St. George, Suncorp, Metway Bank, Challenge Bank, Bank of Melbourne and Bendigo Bank. A change in regulation meant that building societies and credit unions were no longer required to demutualise upon converting to banks, and several including Heritage Bank have converted since 2011 while retaining their status and structure as mutual organisations. Use and design Mutual savings banks were designed to stimulate savings by individuals; the exclusive function of these banks is to protect deposits, make limited, secure investments, and provide depositors with interest. Unlike commercial banks, savings banks have no stockholders; the entirety of profits beyond the upkeep of the bank belongs to the depositors of the mutual savings bank. Mutual savings banks prioritize security, and as a result, have historically been characteristically conservative in their investments. This conservatism is what allowed mutual savings banks to remain stable throughout the turbulent period of the Great Depression, despite the failing of commercial banks and savings and loan associations.

Edward Douglas John Hay was born on 6 August 1947 as the elder of twin sons. He was educated at Milton Abbey and Trinity College, Oxford (BA Hons). He became an insurance broker before succeeding his father in the marquessate. Tweeddale was descended from George Hay, 8th Marquess of Tweeddale, the common ancestor of all subsequent holders of the title. Along with the marquessate and its subsidiary titles he succeeded as Hereditary Chamberlain of Dunfermline. He rarely spoke in the House of Lords and only achieved fleeting prominence during the Bosnian War debate (28 October 1996) and a subsequent letter to The Times on this subject. Lord Tweeddale died on 1 February 2005, aged 57, and was succeeded by his younger twin brother David Hay. Family details The Hays of Yester were possibly related to the Hay earls of Erroll, who held prominent ceremonial office under the Scottish Crown. The 13th Marquess is a descendant of King Charles II of England and Scotland, via his maternal grandmother Lady Joan Capel, later Viscountess Ingleby. The 13th Marquess was the eldest of five sons of David Hay, 12th Marquess of Tweeddale (1921‚Äì1979), and his first son (and elder twin son) by his first wife Hon. Sonia Peake, daughter of Osbert Peake, 1st Viscount Ingleby. The Marquess died unmarried, and was succeeded by his twin brother, Lord David, thus becoming one of the few British aristocrats to be succeeded by a younger twin. The next heir is their youngest brother Lord Alastair Hay, styled Master of Tweeddale as heir presumptive. Since none of the three brothers (sons of the 12th Marquess's first marriage) are married, the next in succession are their two half-brothers, sons of the 12th Marquess's second marriage. The two half-brothers are also twins, but the older of the two, Lord Andrew Arthur George Hay, is the only one with issue.  Twin brothers succeeding as peers  The 13th Marquess is remembered chiefly for being one of the few British peers to be succeeded by a younger twin brother. Similarly, the 3rd Earl of Durham (1855‚Äì1928) was succeeded in 1928 by his younger twin brother, the 4th Earl (1855‚Äì1929). The 3rd Viscount Knutsford (1855‚Äì1935) also succeeded an older twin, the 2nd Viscount (1855‚Äì1931 dspm) on 27 July 1931. Although the 3rd Marquess of Linlithgow and the 1st Baron Glendevon (formerly Lord John Hope) were twins, both were succeeded by their sons.

She has, since 2006, been the president of the China Writers Association and is a member of the 18th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. Her works include short stories, \\"Ah, Xiangxue\\" (), The Red Shirt Without Buttons (), \\"June's Big Topic\\" (), Wheat Straw Stack (), Cotton Stack (), \\"The Village Road Takes Me Home\\", Rose Door (), \\"How Long is Forever\\" () and Da Yu N√º () (Big-Bath Woman).  Background  Tie Ning traces her ancestry to Hebei province. In 1975, after graduation from high school in Baoding, Tie Ning went to Hebei Province to experience rural life. In 1979, she returned to Baoding and worked in the Baoding Branch of the Chinese Federation of Art and Literature as novel editor. In 1984, she worked in the Creative Writing Workshop of Hebei. Now she is the chairperson of the Writers Association of China, a position no woman had ever held before. On 4 December 2016 Tie Ning was subsequently elected as chairwoman of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, replacing Sun Jiazheng, in addition to being reelected as chairperson of the Writers Association of China.  Awards  Tie Ning started publishing her works in 1975. In 1982, her short story \\"Ah, Xiangxue\\" () won a national award. In 1984, her medium-length novel The Red Shirt Without Buttons () and her short story \\"June's Big Topic\\" () won national awards. Since 1980, Tie Ning has published Path in the Night and other collections of short stories and novellas. Her Wheat Straw Stack () won an award as the 1986/1987 \\"Middle- length Novel Offprint\\" (). She won the Lao She Literary Award in 2000 and 2002.  Style  Her early works mainly depicted ordinary people and daily life, exquisitely portraying her characters' inner worlds, and reflecting people's dreams and pursuits and the absurdity and suffering in their lives. In 1986 and 1988, she published two novels, Wheat Straw Stack () and Cotton Stack () respectively, both reflecting ancient history and culture and dealing with women's experiences. After 1986, her novels changed direction to reflection on traditional Chinese cultures, with polysemous themes and varied techniques. In 1988, she wrote her first full-length novel, Rose Door (), in which she departed from her harmonious and idealistic poetic style, and displayed the dark side of life through the competition for survival among women of several generations.  Works  *Ah, Xiangxue () (1982) This is a story about a pure and pretty country girl, Xiangxue, \\"fragrant snow\\" in Chinese. Xiangxue lives in a village in the mountains. Every day, a train from outside the mountains stops at the village just for a minute. Xiangxue and other country girls each take a small basket of eggs to the train when it stops and exchange them for things they want, because they cannot get what they need in the village. Xiangxue carries the basket onto the train, and when she sees a pencil box beside a city girl of her age, she immediately wants it. She offers her for it a full basket of eggs; the exchange is made. It opens up a door to the outside world for her. The story shows the country girl's simplicity and her yearning for civilization. *The Village Road Takes Me Home (1983) Tie Ning is critical of the masculine model as a basis for thought about opposition to the power of the party or state and for assuming responsibility over women's lives. This model is embodied in two male characters who both want to marry the female protagonist because they feel responsible for her earlier marriage to a peasant, which left her a widow and prevented her from returning to the city after the policy of sending educated youths to rural China ended. In her story about the female protagonist's choice between the two, which entails the significant and ideologically loaded choice between the city and the countryside, Tie Ning reveals the complicity of the masculine model in the party's and state's dominant ideology, despite its apparent opposition to it. In its place, she offers the protagonist's feminine view, that one should determine one's life-course based on one's own needs, desires, and abilities, rather than with reference to either opposition to or compliance with the party-state and its ideology. *How Long is Forever () (1999) Bai Daxing is a typical girl brought up in Beijing's Hutongs. She is a kind girl who is always willing to offer help to everybody around her without any consideration of her own interests. But the innocent Bai is cheated repeatedly by the friends who have received her help and love. The people she trusts most make use of her purity and warm-heartedness, leaving Bai with less and less. Bai's personality does not seem to be suited to the times. Tie uses Bai to emphasize how far modern society is from perfection. *The Bathing Women () (2000) Tie Ning's semi-autobiographical novel illustrates how difficult it is for Chinese writers to ignore the national allegory. Set in the world of writing and publishing, the novel relates the story of a young woman and of two older men who are both in love with her. The narrative alternates between first- and third-person as the protagonist connects her love affair with her memories of her teenage years, showing how she achieves strength through the interweaving of her private and public lives.

Background By 19 June the threat of the United Irish rebellion spreading outside county Wexford had been largely contained and Crown forces were positioned to move against rebel held territory. A force of about 1,500 men under Sir John Moore moved out of New Ross towards Wexford as part of an overall encirclement operation in conjunction with General Gerard Lake's forces moving from the north. Moore moves out Moore's force was to link up and combine with the isolated garrison holding Duncannon before moving deeper into County Wexford, but after waiting several hours with no sign of their arrival, Moore decided to press ahead to the village of Taghmon alone. Upon nearing Goffs Bridge at Foulkesmill, his scouts reported a rapidly moving rebel force of some 5,000 moving quickly along the road with the intent to give battle. Moore despatched a force of riflemen from the 60th Regiment to hold the bridge until artillery could be brought up in support. The battle The rebels however, led by Father Philip Roche, spotted this move and moved away from the road to the high ground on the left intending to outflank Moore's force. The 60th were forced to engage the rebels on the roads, fields and forests of the area and the rebel flanking move briefly threatened to overturn Moore's left. Moore had to personally rally his fleeing troops to hold the line and led them in a successful counter-attack. As more troops began to arrive the rebels were flushed out of their concealed positions, allowing the artillery to be brought into play and the rebels' move was foiled. The rebels were gradually pushed back field by field but were able to withdraw the bulk of their force safely. Results The road to Wexford was opened and the town recaptured by the Crown the next day, but during this battle, followers of rebel captain Thomas Dixon massacred between 35-100 (estimates vary) loyalist prisoners at Wexford bridge. Casualties are estimated at 500 on the rebel side and 100 of the military.

Chelsea porcelain is the porcelain made by the Chelsea porcelain manufactory, the first important porcelain manufactory in England, established around 1743‚Äì45, and operating independently until 1770, when it was merged with Derby porcelain.The Bow factory was granted a patent in 1744 but no examples of its wares predating the first works of Chelsea porcelain are known. It made soft- paste porcelain throughout its history, though there were several changes in the \\"body\\" material and glaze used. Its wares were aimed at a luxury market, and its site in Chelsea, London, was close to the fashionable Ranelagh Gardens pleasure ground, opened in 1742.Spero, 118 The first known wares are the \\"goat and bee\\" cream jugs with seated goats at the base, some examples of which are incised with \\"Chelsea\\", \\"1745\\" and a triangle.Honey, 16 The entrepreneurial director, at least from 1750, was Nicholas Sprimont, a Huguenot silversmith in Soho, but few private documents survive to aid a picture of the factory's history.Honey, 17‚Äì24 Early tablewares, being produced in profusion by 1750, depend on Meissen porcelain models and on silverware prototypes, such as salt cellars in the form of realistic shells. Chelsea was known for its figures, initially mostly single standing figures of the Cries of London and other subjects. Many of these were very small by European standards, from about 2 to 3 inches (6 to 9 cm) high, overlapping with the category of \\"Chelsea Toys\\", for which the factory was famous in the 1750s and 1760s. These were very small pieces which often had metal mounts and were functional as bonbonni√®res (little boxes), scent bottles, needlecases, √©tuis, thimbles and small seals, many with inscriptions in French,Spero, 120; Honey, 76‚Äì80 \\"almost invariably amorous suggestions\\",Honey, 78‚Äì80 but often misspelled.Honey, 76‚Äì78 From about 1760, its inspiration was drawn more from S√®vres porcelain than Meissen, making grand garnitures of vases and elaborate large groups with seated couples in front of a bocage screen of flowering plants, all on a raised base of Rococo scrollwork. As with other English factories, much of the sales came from public auctions, held about once a year; copies of the catalogues for 1755, 1756 and (in part) 1761 are very useful to scholars.Lippert, 57‚Äì58 In 1770, the manufactory was purchased by William Duesbury, owner of the Derby porcelain factory, and the wares are indistinguishable during the \\"Chelsea- Derby period\\" that lasted until 1784,Or at least, distinguished with great uncertainty and difficulty. See Honey, 144‚Äì152. when the Chelsea factory was demolished and its moulds, patterns and many of its workmen and artists transferred to Derby.Lippert, 58 Plate, c. 1755, with three vignette scenes from Aesop's Fables Periods by marks \\"Botanical\\" red anchor plate with spray of fruiting Indian bean tree, c. 1755 The factory history, before the merger with Derby, can be divided into four main periods, named for the identifying marks under the wares, although the changes in marks do not exactly coincide with changes in materials or style. Some pieces are unmarked in all periods, and there appears to be some overlapping of marks; indeed some pieces have two different marks. There are also anchor marks in blue and brown,Lippert, 58, note 1; Austin, 1‚Äì3 (including a good set of photos); Honey, 384‚Äì385, with drawings. and an extremely rare \\"crown and trident\\" mark in underglaze blue, known on only about 20 pieces, and thought to date from around 1749. A chipped beaker with this mark fetched ¬£37,000 at auction in 2015.\\"¬£37,000 clue to another side of Chelsea\\", by Roland Arkell, 10 Mar 2015, Antiques Trade Gazette; Austin, 2  Triangle period (around 1743‚Äì1749)  These early products bore an incised triangle mark. Most of the wares were white and were strongly influenced by silverware designs.Spero, 118 The early body was \\"a very translucent material, resembling milk-white glass\\",Honey, 20 later changing \\"to a harder and rather colder-looking material\\".Honey, 24 Slipcasting rather than pressing paste into the moulds was introduced during this period, and remained usual for Chelsea figures.Lippert, 58 The most notable products of this era were white saltcellars in the shape of crayfish. Perhaps the most famous pieces are the Goat and Bee jugs that were also based on a silver model. Copies of these were made by Coalport porcelain in the 19th century. Sales were suspended in March 1749, which appears to be when Sprimont took control, and the factory was moved a short distance within Chelsea.Spero, 118  Raised anchor period (1749‚Äì1752)  Pair of cuckoos, c. 1750, 8 in, 20 cm high, raised anchor markThey seem to be two males of Clamator Glandarius, not to be seen in England; Bird guide illustration On 9 January 1750 Sprimont advertised the reopening of the factory, with \\"a great Variety of Pieces for Ornament in a Taste entirely new\\", and the new mark is assumed to celebrate this.Spero, 118 The factory was very close to the Thames, and the anchor is a symbol of hope, and of Saint Nicolas of Myra, patron saint of seamen, after whom Sprimont was perhaps named.Lippert, 58 The next six or so years were the most successful for the factory.Spero, 118 In this period, the paste and glaze were modified to produce a clear, white, slightly opaque surface on which to paint. The influence of Meissen is evident in the classical figures among Italianate ruins and harbour scenes and adaptations from Francis Barlow's edition of Aesop's Fables.Austin, 3‚Äì4 In 1751, copies were made of two Meissen services. Chelsea also made figures, birds and animals inspired by Meissen originals. Flowers and landscapes were copied from Vincennes porcelain (soon to move to S√®vres). A set of figures of pairs of birds were evidently based on the illustrations to A Natural History of Uncommon Birds, by George Edwards, published in four volumes from 1743 to 1751. The copies used were probably with uncoloured illustrations, as though the forms follow the illustrations well, the colouring of the figures is often eccentric and inaccurate.Austin, 4; Honey, 52‚Äì54  Red anchor period (1752‚Äì1756)  A \\"Chelsea Toy\\" in the form of a basket of fruit, width 2 3/4 inches (4.1 √ó 7 cm), c. 1755, inscribed \\"MON AMOUR LES A CUEILLI POUR VOUS\\" (\\"my love gathered these for you\\"). As at Meissen and Chantilly some time earlier, imitations of Japanese export porcelain in the Kakiemon style were popular from the late 1740s until around 1758. These were copied both from the Continental imitations and Japanese originals, and some apparently freshly created in the style.Austin, 5 Some tableware was decorated with bold and botanically accurate paintings of plants, known as \\"botanical\\" pieces, which essentially take onto porcelain the style of the large botanical book illustrations that were beginning to be produced, and often hand-coloured. The factory was very close to the Chelsea Physic Garden (founded 1673 and still open on the same site), which may have influenced the approach, and at least provided illustrated books as models. Some pieces were copied from various books, including those by Philip Miller, the director of the gardens (the eighth edition of The Gardener's Dictionary (1752) and Figures of Plants, vol 1, 1755) and Georg Dionysius Ehret. An advertisement in 1758 offered \\"Table Plates, Soup Plates, and Desart Plates enamelled from the Hans Sloane's Plants\\" (Sloane had set up the garden's current site in 1722).Spero, 120; Austin, 5‚Äì6 These innovative pieces exerted a long-lasting influence on porcelain design, especially in Britain,Honey, 44 and similar styles have seen a strong revival from the late 20th century, led by Portmeirion Pottery's \\"Botanic Garden\\" range, launched in 1972, using designs adapted from Thomas Green's Universal or-Botanical, Medical and Agricultural Dictionary (1817). The small \\"Toys\\", which become prominent in this period, may have been copied from the elusive \\"Girl-in-a Swing\\" factory, now usually located at St James's, an even more fashionable location in the West End of London, which was active about 1751‚Äì54. This seems to have been connected to the Chelsea factory in some way.Lippert, 58, note 6 (whose dates are used); Honey, 30‚Äì32, 76; Spero, 120; Royal Collection, Flask \\"probably \\"Girl-in-a Swing\\"\\" Another development was tureens and sometimes other large forms in the shapes of animals, birds or plants.Spero, 120 Examples of fairly exact copying of Meissen wares are the \\"Monkey Band\\" (Affenkapelle or \\"ape orchestra\\" in German), a group of ten figures of monkey musicians, and a larger excited conductor, all in fancy contemporary costumes. Such singeries were popular in various media.Honey, 52; Austin, 6‚Äì7, 132‚Äì140  Gold anchor period (1756‚Äì1769)  Pair of vases, c. 1762, in a S√®vres style. The main scenes derive from paintings by Fran√ßois Boucher, via prints. Ht: 23 in. (59 cm) The influence of S√®vres was very strong and French taste was in the ascendancy. Although many existing types continued to be produced, the gold anchor period saw rich coloured grounds, lavish gilding and the nervous energy of the Rococo style. As had been the case with imitations of Meissen Kakiemon, Chelsea began to imitate the S√®vres Rococo style just as S√®vres itself was abandoning it for more restrained shapes and decoration.Lappet, 57; Spero, 120 Chelsea garnitures of vases became very large and elaborate, some with as many as seven pieces in diminishing sizes. The body now included bone ash, and a wider range of colours was used, as well as lavish gilding.Spero, 120 The glaze now had a tendency to drip and pool, as well as crazing, and had a slight greenish tint.Lappet, 57 In 1763, George III and Queen Charlotte sent the queen's brother Adolphus Frederick IV, Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz a large Chelsea service. This commissioning of porcelain for diplomatic gifts was common among the ruler-owned European factories (and indeed in East Asia), but novel for England. The service was praised by Horace Walpole, who said it cost ¬£1,200, and is now mostly in the Royal Collection, who have 137 pieces.Honey, 66‚Äì68; Royal Collection East Asian styles had returned in the red anchor period in the form of versions of Japanese Imari ware, but are more common with the gold anchor. These were to remain an English favourite, especially associated with later Crown Derby, and versions are still made today. According to at least one English authority the first Chelsea versions \\"greatly surpass in beauty their dull originals\\".Honey, 68‚Äì70, 68 quoted Evidence suggests that production was low from 1763, perhaps because Sprimont wished to retire. A sale in 1763 included at least some moulds and premises, as well as household furniture of Sprimont. No dedicated sale was then held until 1769, when moulds were offered again.Honey, 56 In August 1769, the factory was sold by Sprimont, whose health had been bad, and the next year it was purchased by William Duesbury of Derby porcelain who ran it until 1784; Sprimont sold the factory in August 1769 to a James Cox. Duesbury and his partner John Heath bought it in February 1770.Lippert, 58; Spero, 120, 128; Honey, 56‚Äì58 The factory continued to operate in Chelsea but during this time the Chelsea wares are indistinguishable from Duesbury's Derby wares and the period is usually termed \\"Chelsea-Derby\\". A final Chelsea sale (at Christie's) began on 14 February 1770.Honey, 56‚Äì58 Management and artists Saucer with fable by the \\"Chelsea Fable Painter\\", perhaps Jefferyes Hamett O'Neale, c. 1752 The silversmith Nicholas Sprimont (1716‚Äì1771), who came from Li√®ge in modern Belgium, was the usual public face of the factory, but there were other main figures, and the precise roles of all of them are uncertain. Charles Gouyn or Gouyon (before 1737‚Äì1782) was another London Huguenot silversmith, and also a dealer in porcelain, who was involved in the early years, but whose role is obscure. He has been suggested as being \\"concerned with the technical part of the manufacture\\", or as providing the finance, and acting as a major buyer or distributor of wares. By 1749 or 1750 there may have been a rift between the two.Honey, 16‚Äì18, 18 quoted; Lippert, 57 Gouyn may have founded the \\"Girl-in- a-Swing\\" factory or St James's factory, named after the fashionable street where he had a shop.Royal Collection page on an etui Any porcelain factory needed an \\"arcanist\\", or chemist who could devise the formulae for the body paste, glaze, and colours, and specify the firing variables. It is not clear who this was at Chelsea; a paper in the British Museum believed to be by Sprimont speaks of having \\"a casual acquaintance with a chymist who had some knowledge that way\\", who influenced him to start the factory. Gouyn is one suggestion; another is a Thomas Bryand or Briand, who in 1743 showed the Royal Society examples of porcelain. By 1746 he was living in Staffordshire, establishing a business partnership, self-described as a painter who \\"had found out ye art of making an Earthenware Little inferior to Porcelain or China Ware\\"; but he seems to have died the following year.Honey, 18‚Äì20; Lippert, 57 Large payments to the factory are recorded in 1746 to 1748 from Sir Everard Fawkener, secretary to the king's third son, Prince William, Duke of Cumberland, who had put down the Jacobite rising of 1745. It is not clear if these were on behalf of the prince or from Fawkener's own funds, or the exact nature of what seems to have been a financing operation. Whereas royal investment in porcelain manufacturing was very common in Europe, it would have been unprecedented in England. A five inch high portrait head of the prince was produced, which was an unusual departure from Chelsea's normal wares. In 1751 a letter says that Fawkener borrowed some Meissen pieces to be copied in Chelsea, and was described as \\"concerned in the manufacture of China at Chelsea\\", while the same writer adds \\"I find that the Duke is a great encourager of the Chelsea China\\". A worker at the factory believed that Fawkener and Cumberland were the first owners, who employed Sprimont at a guinea a day. Fawkener died in 1758, in some financial difficulties, and at this point Sprimont may have finally become the full owner.Lippert, 57; Honey, 40, 54; Head of Cumberland Part of a gold anchor tea service, c. 1758‚Äì59. The black and gold palette imitates Asian lacquer. Sprimont is generally regarded as the guiding hand of the tableware shapes, which made heavy use of metal precedents. Few of the many artists involved are known. The main modeller of figures was the Flemish sculptor Joseph Willems, at Chelsea from about 1749 to 1766, when he left for the factory at Tournai. The miniature painter Jefferyes Hamett O'Neale has been identified as the \\"Chelsea Fable Painter\\", though not without objections; he later signed pieces of Worcester porcelain, though probably working in London.

Honey felt the signed Worcester pieces were too crude to be by the hand of the \\"Chelsea Fable Painter\\", though more recent writers accept the identification.Honey, 13, 42, 268; Lippert, 57; Spero, 119 The leading sculptor Louis-Fran√ßois Roubiliac, French but working in London, was long believed to have modelled many figures, which were additionally marked with an impressed \\"R\\", but it seems that this mark means something else, and it is likely that there were at most only a handful of instances of models by him. Sprimont was the godfather of one of his daughters.Honey, 34, 60. The \\"Music Lesson\\" illustrated at top is one of the \\"R\\"-marked pieces. One Chelsea figure certainly based on his work is the reclining portrait of the painter William Hogarth's pug dog called Trump. Roubiliac sculpted Trump in terracotta in about 1741, to accompany a bust of Hogarth. The figure appeared in Chelsea porcelain some years later, and then in Josiah Wedgwood's Black Basalt ware after he bought a cast of the terracotta in 1774.Chelsea figure, V&A; A portrait bust of Frederick, Prince of Wales also appears close to Roubiliac's style.Honey, 34 William Duesbury, who bought the factory in 1770, had been a painter of Chelsea and other wares at his own London workshop, which is documented by an account book of his covering 1751 to 1753 which has survived. However, no Chelsea pieces by his workshop can be securely identified.Honey, 13 The books record many figures of birds in particular.Austin, 4 Markets and collectors Much of the distribution of Chelsea and other English porcelain (and fine earthenware such as Wedgwood) was through the \\"chinamen\\", already a recognised category of dealers and retailers for porcelain, and \\"warehouses\\" in Central London, which sold mainly to smaller dealers and shop-keepers, often from the provinces, but also to customers. Chelsea's arrangements are less well documented than those of Bow, but Gouyn's shop in St James was probably an outlet, at least in the early period.Davenport-Hines, 59‚Äì66 The annual actions were partly intended for the chinamen, with some lots made up of a range of wares to provide a stock.Austin, 7‚Äì9 The East India Company had been selling its cargos of East Asian porcelain at auction for some decades. Chelsea wares reached British America,Austin, 9‚Äì12 but there were probably few exports to the Continent. Early English porcelain was soon being collected, especially in the late 19th century, when prices rose steadily. Over the 20th century there has been a great reversal in collectors' interests, with wares from later in the century far cheaper now (allowing for inflation) than they were a century ago, while the rare earliest pieces have seen dizzying increases in value. The sale at auction in 2003 of a tureen in the form of a hen and chickens for ¬£223,650 was then the auction record for English 18th-century porcelain.Apollo, \\"Now is the time to buy English porcelain‚Ä¶\\", by Emma Crichton-Miller, 23 June 2017 In 2018 a pair of plaice-shaped tureens of c. 1755 from the collection of David Rockefeller and his wife fetched $300,000 (both sales at Christie's).\\"TWO CHELSEA PORCELAIN PLAICE TUREENS, COVERS AND SPOONS, CIRCA 1755\\", Lot 620, Sale 16722, \\"The Collection of Peggy and David Rockefeller: English & European Furniture, Ceramics and Decorations, Part II\\", Christie's New York, 10 May 2018  Gallery  Image:GoatandBeeJug-BMA (cropped).jpgGoat-and-Bee Jug, c. 1745‚Äì1749, Birmingham Museum of Art File:Dogs ‚Äî Chelseaporcfactory.jpgPair of dogs, about 1749, height , V&A; Museum File:Tureen, 1752-1756, Chelsea Porcelain Manufactory, England, porcelain with enamel - Art Institute of Chicago - DSC09771.JPGRabbit tureen, 1752‚Äì1756 File:Pair of Hexagonal Vases, c. 1752-1755, Chelsea, soft-paste porcelain with overglaze enamels - Gardiner Museum, Toronto - DSC00614.JPGPair of Hexagonal Vases in Kakiemon style, c. 1752‚Äì1755, Gardiner Museum, Toronto File:Four Seasons (Spring) MET SF64 101 456.jpg\\"Spring\\" from a set of the Four Seasons, 1753‚Äì1755, 5 1/4 in.

Early life Martin was born in Dublin, Ireland, of the son of Samuel Martin, a planter well established on the Caribbean island of Antigua, third son of his father's second marriage. His elder half- brother Samuel Martin (1714‚Äì1788) was secretary to the Treasury in London. Another brother Sir Henry Martin (1735‚Äì1794) was for many years naval commissioner at Portsmouth and Comptroller of the Royal Navy. Sir Henry was father of Thomas Byam Martin. This Josiah Martin's uncle, also Josiah Martin (1699‚Äì1778) but born in Antigua, left Antigua after 1750 and settled at Far Rockaway, Long Island.Josiah Martin's house, Rock Hall and He was a member of the first board of trustees for King's College (now Columbia University) in 1754 and a member of the royal council of New York in 1754‚Äì1755. From 1759 to 1764, he was on the council of the governor of the Province of New York. Josiah Martin, the younger, married his first cousin Elizabeth Martin, daughter of the elder Josiah Martin of Long Island, in 1761. At first undecided, he became an ensign in the British Army in 1756, rising to the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel in 1769. On 29 December 1758, Josiah was appointed to the New York Council, a position once held by his uncle. Because of his trips to London and Antigua, the council, in November 1762, temporarily replaced him with Lawrence Read, superseded in turn by Lawrence's father Joseph Read, to sit in Martin's place until he returned. He was given \\"a full year to determine whether he will return to the council from the West Indies.\\" Governor of North Carolina On 1 March 1771, Martin received his appointment from The Crown as Governor of the Province of North Carolina, succeeding James Hasell. Handicapped by illness, he remained in New York and was unable to present himself in the governor's palace at New Bern until Monday, 12 August 1771. Governor Martin tried to give the North Carolinians useful and fair government, but he was hampered by his instructions from Lord Hillsborough, and later by Lord Dartmouth. Tryon left a legacy to Martin of five major problems that plagued North Carolina. These problems were * the fiscal and psychological effects of the War of the Regulation; * the unsettled and expensive dispute between the Carolinas about their mutual boundary line; * the struggle over the court law bills and the judiciary, especially the attachment of the property of debtors who had never lived in the province; * the old quorum trouble in the House of Commons that caused conflict between the House and the governor; and * the conflict over the selection of the chief personnel of the provincial government by the crown rather than through the assembly. After his home was attacked by Whigs on 24 April 1775, he sent his family to his in-laws' home in New York and took refuge on board the sloop-of- war HMS Cruizer, transferring his headquarters to Fort Johnston on the Cape Fear River. When the Mecklenburg Resolves were published in May 1775, Martin transmitted a copy to England,Archibald Henderson, \\"The Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence\\", The Journal of American History, 1912. Henderson noted that it was previously thought that Martin sent a copy of the Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence, but that it is \\"now established beyond doubt\\" that he sent a copy of the Resolves. which he described as \\"setting up a system of rule and regulation subversive of his majesty's government.\\" Martin then requested a supply of arms and ammunition from General Thomas Gage in Boston. In July 1775, a plot instigated by Martin to arm the slaves was discovered. In retaliation, John Ashe led a group of colonists against Fort Johnston on 20 July. Martin was forced to flee aboard the Cruizer while the colonists destroyed the fort. Martin remained off the coast of North Carolina, directing the rising of the Loyalists, whom he supplied with weapons brought from England. Later life After two attempts during the Carolina campaign to re-establish his administration were turned back, Martin, who was then in ill health due to fatigue, left for Long Island and then England. He died in London in April 1786 and was buried at St George's Hanover Square Church, City of Westminster, London, England. Legacy Martin County, North Carolina, is named after him.

History = Background  The history of cross-browser is involved with the history of the \\"browser wars\\" in the late 1990s between Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer as well as with that of JavaScript and JScript, the first scripting languages to be implemented in the web browsers. Netscape Navigator was the most widely used web browser at that time and Microsoft had licensed Mosaic to create Internet Explorer 1.0. New versions of Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer were released at a rapid pace over the following few years. Due to the intense competition in the web browser market, the development of these browsers was fast-paced and new features were added without any coordination between vendors. The introduction of new features often took priority over bug fixes, resulting in unstable browsers, fickle web standards compliance, frequent crashes and many security holes.  Creation of W3C and Web standardization  The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), founded in 1994 to promote open standards for the World Wide Web, pulled Netscape and Microsoft together with other companies to develop a standard for browser scripting languages called \\"ECMAScript\\". The first version of the standard was published in 1997. Subsequent releases of JavaScript and JScript would implement the ECMAScript standard for greater cross-browser compatibility. After the standardization of ECMAScript, W3C began work on the standardization of Document Object Model (DOM), which is a way of representing and interacting with objects in HTML, XHTML and XML documents. DOM Level 0 and DOM Level 1 were introduced in 1996 and 1997. Only limited supports of these were implemented by the browsers, as a result, non-conformant browsers such as Internet Explorer 4.x and Netscape 4.x were still widely used as late as 2000. DOM Standardization became popular since the introduction of DOM Level 2, which was published in 2000. It introduced the \\"getElementById\\" function as well as an event model and support for XML namespaces and CSS. DOM Level 3, the current release of the DOM specification, published in April 2004, added support for XPath and keyboard event handling, as well as an interface for serializing documents as XML. By 2005, large parts of W3C DOM were well-supported by common ECMAScript-enabled browsers, including Microsoft Internet Explorer, Opera, Safari and Gecko-based browsers (like Firefox, SeaMonkey and Camino).https://www.w3.org/Consortium/facts.html  This century  In the early part of the century, practices such as browser sniffing were deemed unusable for cross-browser scripting.http://jibbering.com/faq/notes/detect- browser/ The term \\"multi-browser\\" was coined to describe applications that relied on browser sniffing or made otherwise invalid assumptions about run- time environments, which at the time were almost invariably Web browsers. The term \\"cross-browser\\" took on its currently accepted meaning at this time as applications that once worked in Internet Explorer 4 and Netscape Navigator 4 and had since become unusable in modern browsers could not reasonably be described as \\"cross-browser\\". Colloquially, such multi-browser applications, as well as frameworks and libraries are still referred to as cross-browser. Cross Browser Compatibility Not to be confused with multi-browser compatible, cross browser compatible applications and websites will be stable in any version of a browser. The ability of a site to be easily viewed across different browsers is essential to usability for Internet users. A web application behaves exactly as desired in one browser but might have other issues in another browsers. So the issues will hamper the vigorous functionality of an application. The clients who look out for a professional application or a website can rely on cross browser testing which would help client applications in producing different results on different web browsers as they run in applets, Flash, JavaScript requests and so on.

A Democrat, he served two terms from 1933 to 1941. Martin was born and raised in Cheney in the Washington Territory. He graduated from the University of Washington in Seattle in 1906, and joined his father in running the Cheney Grain and Milling Company. From 1928 to 1936 Martin was the mayor of Cheney. While still in office, he ran for and was elected in 1932 as governor of the state of Washington. He was known as the \\"people's governor\\" for his strict frugality in government spending, but he also oversaw large economic projects, such as the Grand Coulee Dam in the North Cascades, to put people to work during the Great Depression. He married Margaret Mulligan of Spokane in 1907, and they had three sons. Martin died in 1955 at the age of 69 and is buried at the Fairmount Memorial Park in Spokane.State Library of Washington - Clarence D. Martin - accessed 2010-10-03City of Cheney.org - Mayor Clarence D. Martin - accessed 2010-10-02 Martin Stadium and Academic Center, the football stadium at Washington State University in Pullman, was named in his honor at its opening in 1972. Family name, early life and education He was born in Cheney, Washington to Francies M. and Philena Martin, who migrated to eastern Washington from Ohio by way of Portland in the early 1880s. Martin was educated in the Cheney public schools. He graduated from the State Normal School at Cheney in 1903, and completed additional studies at the University of Washington in Seattle, graduating with a BA degree in 1906. After leaving the university, he joined his wheat-farming father in founding the family business, the F. M. Martin Grain and Milling Company in Cheney. Upon his father's death in 1925, Martin assumed the role of president and general manager of the company. He served in this position until early 1943, when the mill was sold to the National Biscuit Company. Early political career Martin first became interested in politics in his hometown, where he was elected to the city council in 1915. He served as mayor of Cheney from 1928 until he was elected governor. During this period, he was also chairman of the state Democratic committee. Governorship, 1933-1941 Martin was elected Governor of Washington in November 1932, in the Democratic landslide which virtually replaced most Republicans in state political offices. He was the first native son to be elected to the state's highest office, an honor of which he was extremely proud. Given the dire economic circumstances and the crisis atmosphere of the early 1930s, Martin's first gubernatorial campaign was remarkable in its moderation. There was no demagoguery, no personalities, no threats, no condemnations and no bitter attacks. His platform was based on providing unemployment relief and tax reform; he vowed \\"to return the state government to the service and benefit of the people.\\" By the end of the campaign, he had made 750 speeches and traveled 40,000 miles, but as he said, he \\"gave away no cigars, kissed no babies and promised no jobs.\\" (Steward, Edgar I. Washington, Northwest Frontier, Vol. II, New York: Lewis Historical Publications, Co., 1957, pp. 296‚Äì97). Both in the primary and general elections, Martin's opponents charged him with trying to buy the gubernatorial office. Martin rebutted these accusations by pointing out that he was using his own money for the campaign and therefore would have obligations to no one. His electoral majority was larger than that gained by incumbent President Franklin D. Roosevelt in Washington. This ensured that he was not accused of winning the office on the presidential coattails. First term, 1933-1936 Martin took office in January 1933. His first term was controversial, and he was criticized for both his political appointments and his relief programs. Martin alienated hard-core Democrats of the state with the appointment of a number of Republicans to high state offices, many of whom were holdovers from the previous administration of Governor Roland Hartley. In justifying his appointment policy, Martin remarked: \\"I did not get all of my majority from Democrats and I think both parties should be represented.\\" (Spokesman Review, April 19, 1933 p. 3) Martin recognized the need to set aside partisan politics to effectively combat the Depression. When Martin took office in January 1933, the Great Depression was at its height. In his first inaugural message, Governor Martin acknowledged the severity of the economic crisis. But he recounted the natural and human resources of the state and concluded that \\"surely, with such resources at hand, we need only the spirit to seek, the determination to build, the genius to create, and the readiness to cooperate toward a common development.\\" He believed it was the primary duty of government to promote the common good; state government must promote constructive, although perhaps unpopular programs, and the people must accept the necessary sacrifices. Martin advocated abandonment of traditional approaches to problem-solving when those approaches proved inadequate. His call for state government action anticipated a similar call on the national level by President Roosevelt. Those first few months in office were a time of intense activity. Martin proposed increased economy of government through the elimination of waste and the reduction of state employees' salaries; Martin later proposed and the Legislature endorsed a salary reduction of from 10 to 25 percent of all state employees. Martin planned to shift the relief burden from the nearly bankrupt county and local agencies to the state government. He recommended a $10,000,000 bond issue which was to be used to fund employment on minor public works projects. The Legislature approved this bond issue and relief measures were soon forthcoming. He then proposed a complete restructuring of the tax system. In the November 1932 election, the people of the state had affirmed a 40-mill limit on property taxes. This ceiling on the property tax made new sources on tax revenue necessary. Martin proposed a sales tax as a short term, stop-gap measure; he believed that this sales tax would ultimately be replaced by a form of business and occupation tax. The business and occupation tax was enacted during the twenty-third legislative session, but was declared unconstitutional by the State Supreme Court in September, 1933, after a long and bitter struggle. Washington was one forward a contributory system of old-age insurance. Washington was one of the firsts of the northwestern states to enter the field of old-age insurance when the Legislature passed the social security measure in February, 1933. Although the 1933 Legislature failed to provide adequate funding for the pension program, it did establish a needed precedent. In 1935, the Legislature provided additional funds for the program. Governor Martin advocated a number of urgent projects in his first inaugural address. He proposed restructuring of the state banking laws to prevent future closures. Education was a particularly important part of the Governor's program. He proposed that the state assume 50 percent of the funding burden of the public school system to insure the continued quality and equality of education. He recommended an \\"open door\\" policy at the university level for all Washington high school graduates to promote equality of opportunity for higher education. With respect to mortgage debts, Martin believed that some modification of the foreclosure procedure should be enacted to provide a \\"breathing spell\\" for those farmers and homeowners threatened with the loss of their property. (Martin, Clarence D. First Inaugural Message, 1933. Olympia, Washington: Jay Tomas Printer, 1933) Projects during the Great Depression (Grand Coulee Dam, bridges, education) Martin's first months in office paralleled the feverish activity of the new federal administration. He initiated many programs to fight the depression in the state. An active and constructive fight against the depression characterized his administration, a sharp contrast to the passive acknowledgement shown by the Hartley regime. Martin sought to create jobs rather than provide handouts for the citizens of the state. The Grand Coulee Dam project, initiated early in 1933, was one of the major job-creating projects. In March 1933, the state legislature, at the prodding of the governor, created the Columbia Basin Commission; in June 1933, $377,000 of the ten million dollar bond issue was appropriated for the dam to show the federal government that the state was serious about the project. Roosevelt set aside 63 million dollars for construction of the low dam at Grand Coulee. Governor Martin was on hand for the ground-breaking ceremonies in September, 1933, and he poured the first bucket of cement in December, 1935. Roosevelt approved construction of the high dam with hydroelectric generating capacity in June, 1935, and by the end of Martin's second term Grand Coulee Dam was producing electricity. In the long run Grand Coulee Dam provided electricity for industry and home, as well as irrigation water for the Columbia Basin. Its short-term benefits were equally important for the state. The project provided immediate employment for thousands left jobless in the wake of the Great Depression. Other significant construction projects during Martin's administration eased the burden of unemployment in the state. Both the Lake Washington Floating Bridge and the ill-fated Tacoma Narrows Bridge were completed in 1940 and provided necessary public service as well as jobs for many unemployed. The ambitious project to harness the Columbia River with the Bonneville Dam also provided both electricity and jobs. The accomplishments of Martin's administration were not limited to physical construction projects. His keen interest in education insured the continued funding and development of the public school system in the state at a time when local agencies were unable to provide adequate monies and the system's continuation was in grave danger. Martin also maintained his commitment to higher education. Despite financial hard times for the state, Martin supported an extensive building program at Washington State College, a program facilitated by Martin's respect for and friendship with President E. O. Holland. Martin's administration also reorganized the state's highway system providing miles of new and improved roads as well as many new jobs. He also directed the reorganization of the State Highway Patrol. With the end of prohibition the state of Washington secured much needed revenue by organizing and operating the retail liquor business. The liquor control system established by the Martin administration is still with us today. His dealings with the federal government, although strained at times, secured for the state a substantial portion of the New Deal aid necessary for economic reconstruction. Second term, 1936-1941 Governor Martin was re-elected in 1936, soundly defeating former Governor Hartley. His majority in 1936, which was greater than that of his first election and again larger than President Roosevelt's statewide vote, reflected the popular confidence in his administration. His second term continued the sound fiscal practices and businesslike government he had initiated in 1933. He sought an unprecedented third term in 1940, but was defeated in the primary by former Senator C. C. Dill, who, although supported by Martin in the general election, was defeated in an exceedingly close contest by Republican Arthur Langlie. Late political career Martin's political career and aspirations did not end with his tenure as governor. In February, 1944, Governor Martin was appointed to fill a vacancy in the state House of Representatives from the Fifth District and served a special session. In 1948 he again sought election to the state's highest office but was defeated in the primary. He was reelected to the Cheney City Council in 1950. Personal life Martin married Margaret Mulligan on July 18, 1907. They had three sons: William F., Clarence D., Jr. and Frank M. He and his wife were divorced in August 1943. Martin remarried in April 1944, and with his new bride, the former Merle L. Lewis of Spokane, left Cheney and settled in southern California, but were divorced in March 1946. Martin married his third wife, Lou Eckhart, in December 1951, and they lived in Cheney until his death on August 11, 1955. Civic life Martin's public commitment to the welfare of the state's citizens is documented by the deeds of his administration, but his private actions also reveal a man of generosity and compassion. Martin personally aided a number of worthy young men with their college educations, as well as providing scholarship funds for his alma mater, the newly named Eastern Washington College of Education at Cheney. He continued his interest in debate and public speaking, activities at which he excelled in college, by sponsoring an annual oratorical contest in Cheney. He took a personal interest in the case of a child of twelve who killed an Asotin sheriff during a robbery. With Martin's aid, the youngster was rehabilitated and went on to lead a productive life. Martin also used his financial resources to benefit the citizens of his home town. Earlier, while Mayor of Cheney, Martin donated the city's street lighting system in the memory of his father. Martin Stadium Martin Stadium and Academic Center, an outdoor athletic stadium at Washington State University in Pullman, is named for him. His middle son Dan (Clarence D. Martin, Jr., 1916-1976), made a sizable donation to the project in January 1972. Legacy Philosophically and politically Martin was a conservative Democrat who, while governor, placed the welfare of the people of the state above party politics. His tenure as governor reflected the sound business and financial practices which guided his entire life. He tempered fiscal conservatism with humanitarian concern for those suffering under the height of the depression. When Martin left office there was still unemployment and economic distress, but the state had weathered the worst years of the depression. One historian records that when Martin left office \\"the state was solvent, the radical left-wing groups had been kept in check, and there had been no compromise with Socialistic panaceas.\\"Stewart, Washington, Vol. II, p. 314 Upon his death the Spokesman Review editorialized that \\"He served the state well throughout eight critical years of its history.\\"Spokesman Review, August 13, 1955, p. 4 In the opinion of many, he was the best governor the state had ever had.Miles, Charles and O. b.

Celebrity status is generally associated with avant-gardist novelty. Developers around the world have proven eager to sign up \\"top talent\\" (i.e., starchitects) in hopes of convincing reluctant municipalities to approve large developments, of obtaining financing or of increasing the value of their buildings.Davide Ponzini and Michele Nastasi, STARCHITECTURE: Scenes, Actors and Spectacles in Contemporary Cities. Turin, Allemandi, 2011. http://www.starchitecture.it/category/book A key characteristic is that the starchitecture is almost always \\"iconic\\" and highly visible within the site or context. As the status is dependent on current visibility in the media, fading media status implies that architects lose \\"starchitect\\" status‚Äîhence a list can be drawn up of former \\"starchitects\\".  The Bilbao Effect  Buildings are frequently regarded as profit opportunities, so creating \\"scarcity\\" or a certain degree of uniqueness gives further value to the investment. The balance between functionality and avant-gardism has influenced many property developers. For instance, architect-developer John Portman found that building skyscraper hotels with vast atriums‚Äîwhich he did in various U.S. cities during the 1980s‚Äîwas more profitable than maximizing floor area.Charles Landry, The Creative City: A Toolkit for Urban Innovators. London; Earthscan, 2003. However, it was the rise of postmodern architecture during the late 1970s and early 1980s that gave rise to the idea that star status in the architectural profession was about an avant-gardism linked to popular culture‚Äîwhich, it was argued by postmodern critics such as Charles Jencks, had been derided by the guardians of a modernist architecture. In response, Jencks argued for \\"double coding\\";Charles Jencks, What is Postmodernism? London, Academy Editions, 1984. i.e., that postmodernism could be understood and enjoyed by the general public and yet command \\"critical approval\\". The star architects from that period often built little or their best-known works were \\"paper architecture\\"‚Äîunbuilt or even unbuildable schemes, yet known through frequent reproduction in architectural magazines, such as the work of L√©on Krier, Michael Graves, Aldo Rossi, Robert A. M. Stern, Hans Hollein, and James Stirling. As postmodernism went into decline, its avant-gardist credentials suffered due to its associations with vernacular and traditionalism, and celebrity shifted back towards modernist avant-gardism.Charles Jencks, \\"The new paradigm in architecture\\" in Absolute Motion, Datutop 22, Tampere, 2002. But a high-tech strand of modernism persisted in parallel with a formally retrogressive post- modernism; one that often championed \\"progress\\" by celebrating, if not exposing, structure and systems engineering. Such technological virtuosity can be discovered during this time in the work of Norman Foster, Renzo Piano, and Richard Rogers, the latter two having designed the controversial Pompidou Centre (1977) in Paris, which opened to international acclaim. What this so‚Äëcalled high-tech architecture showed was that an industrial aesthetic‚Äîan architecture characterized as much by urban grittiness as engineering efficiency‚Äîhad popular appeal. This was also somewhat evident in so‚Äëcalled Deconstructionist architecture, such as the employment of chainlink fencing, raw plywood and other industrial materials in designs for residential and commercial architecture. Arguably the most notable practitioner along these lines, at least in the 1970s, is the now internationally renowned architect Frank Gehry, whose house in Santa Monica, California, bears these characteristics. The Guggenheim Museum Bilbao by Frank Gehry, along the Nervi√≥n River, Bilbao With urban generation from the turn of the twentieth century picking up, economists forecast that globalization and the powers of multinational corporations would shift the balance of power away from nation states towards individual cities, which would then compete with neighboring cities and cities elsewhere for the most lucrative modern industries, and which increasingly in major Western Europe and U.S. cities did not include manufacturing. Thus cities set about \\"reinventing themselves\\", giving precedence to the value given by culture. Municipalities and non-profit organizations hope the use of a Starchitect will drive traffic and tourist income to their new facilities. With the popular and critical success of the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, by Frank Gehry, in which a rundown area of a city in economic decline brought in huge financial growth and prestige, the media started to talk about the so-called \\"Bilbao Effect\\";Witold Rybczynski, \\"The Bilbao Effect\\", The Atlantic Monthly, September 2002. a star architect designing a blue-chip, prestige building was thought to make all the difference in producing a landmark for the city. Similar examples are the Imperial War Museum North (2002), Greater Manchester, UK, by Daniel Libeskind, the Kiasma Museum of Contemporary Art, Helsinki, Finland, by Steven Holl, and the Seattle Central Library (2004), Washington state, United States, by OMA. The origin of the phrase \\"wow factor architecture\\" is uncertain, but has been used extensively in business management in both the UK and United States to promote avant-gardist buildings within urban regeneration since the late 1990s.The term has been used more often in business management. See for instance: Tom Peters, The pursuit of wow, New York, Vintage, 1994. It has even taken on a more scientific aspect, with money made available in the UK to study the significance of the factor. In research carried out in Sussex University, UK, in 2000, interested parties were asked to consider the \\"effect on the mind and the senses\\" of new developments.Paul Kelso, \\"Architects urged to go for the 'wow factor' in designs for Britain's new public buildings\\", The Guardian, November 27, 2000. In an attempt to produce a \\"delight rating\\" for a given building, architects, clients and the intended users of the building were encouraged to ask: \\"What do passers‚Äëby think of the building?\\", \\"Does it provide a focal point for the community?\\" The Design Quality Indicator has been produced by the UK Construction Industry Council, so that bodies commissioning new buildings will be encouraged to consider whether the planned building has \\"the wow factor\\" in addition to more traditional concerns of function and cost. The \\"wow factor\\" has also been taken up by Spanish architecture critics such as New York Times architecture critics Herbert Mushamp and Nicolai Ouroussof, in their arguments that the city needs to be \\"radically\\" reshaped by new towers. Discussing Spanish starchitect Santiago Calatrava's new skyscraper at 80 South Street near the foot of the Brooklyn Bridge, Ouroussof mentions how Calatrava's apartments are conceived as self- contained urban refuges, $30,000,000 prestige objects for the global elites: \\"If they differ in spirit from the Vanderbilt mansions of the past, it is only in that they promise to be more conspicuous. They are paradises for aesthetes.\\"Nicolai Ouroussof, \\"The New New York Skyline\\", New York Times, September 5, 2004  Historical overview of the status of architects  Title page of the 1568 edition of Le Vite The notion of giving celebrity status to architects is not new, but is contained within the general tendency, from the Renaissance onwards, to give status to artists. Until the modern era, artists in Western civilization were generally working under a patron ‚Äì usually the Church or the rulers of the state ‚Äì and their reputation could become commodified, such that their services could be bought by different patrons. One of the first records of celebrity status is artist-architect Giorgio Vasari's monograph Le vite de' pi√π eccellenti pittori, scultori e architettori (in English, Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects), first published in 1550, recording the Italian Renaissance at the time of its flourishment. Vasari, himself under the patronage of Grand Duke Cosimo I de' Medici, even favoured architects from the city where he resided, Florence, attributing to them innovation, while barely mentioning other cities or places further away. The importance of Vasari's book was in the ability to consolidate reputation and status without people actually having to see the works described.D. J. Gordon and Stephen Orgel, \\"Leonardo's Legend\\", ELH, Vol. 49, No. 2, Summer, 1982. The development of media has thus been equally of central importance to architectural celebrity as other walks of life. While status arising from patronage from the Church and State continued with the rise of Enlightenment and capitalism (e.g., the position of architect Christopher Wren in the patronage of the British Crown, the City of London, the Church of England and Oxford University during the 17th century), there was an expansion in artistic and architectural services available, each competing for commissions with the growth of industry and the middle-classes. Architects nevertheless remained essentially servants to their clients: while Romanticism and Modernism in the other arts encouraged individualism, progress in architecture was geared mostly to improvements in building performance (standards of comfort), engineering and the development of new building typologies (e.g., factories, railway stations, and later airports) and public benevolence (the problems of urbanization, public housing, overcrowding, etc.), yet allowing some architects to concern themselves with architecture as an autonomous art (as flourished with Art Nouveau and Art Deco).Spiro Kostof, The Architect: Chapters in the History of the Profession, University of California Press, 2000. The heroes of modern architecture, in particular Le Corbusier, were seen as heroic for generating theories about how architecture should be concerned with the development of society. Such publicity also made it into the popular press: in the post-war era Time magazine occasionally featured architects on its front cover ‚Äì for instance, in addition to Le Corbusier, Eero Saarinen, Frank Lloyd Wright, and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. In more recent times Time magazine has also featured Philip Johnson, Peter Eisenman, Rem Koolhaas and Zaha Hadid. Eero Saarinen is a particularly interesting case because he specialized in building Headquarters for prestigious U.S. companies, such as General Motors, CBS, and IBM, and these companies used architecture to promote their corporate images: e.g., during the 1950s General Motors often photographed their new car models in front of their headquarters in Michigan.Eeva-Liisa Pelkonen and Donald Albrecht (eds), Eero Saarinen. Shaping the Future New Haven, Yale University Press, 2006. Corporations have continued to understand the value of bringing in Starchitects to design their key buildings. For instance, the manufacturing company Vitra is well known for the works of notable architects that make up its premises in Weil am Rhein, Germany; including Zaha Hadid, Tadao Ando, SANAA, Herzog & de Meuron, √Ålvaro Siza, and Frank Gehry; as is the fashion house Prada for commissioning Rem Koolhaas to design their flagship stores in New York and Los Angeles. However, throughout history the greatest prestige has come with the design of public buildings ‚Äì opera houses, libraries, townhalls, and especially museums, often referred to as the \\"new cathedrals\\" of our times.Justin Henderson, Museum Architecture, Rockport Publishers, 2001.  Measuring celebrity status  Objectivity in the question of status would seem questionable. However, researchers at Clarkson University have used the method of Google hits to 'measure' the degree of celebrity status: \\"to establish a precise mathematical definition of fame, both in the sciences and the world at large\\".Mike Martin, \\"Scientists Use Google To Measure Fame vs. Merit\\", Sci-tech today.com - May 20, 2004, Prizes and the consolidation of reputation Although there are few architects well known to the general public, \\"starchitects\\" are held in the highest esteem by their professional colleagues and the professional media. Such status is marked not only by prestigious commissions but also by various prizes. For example, the Pritzker Prize, awarded since 1979, attempts to increase its own prestige by mentioning how its procedures are modeled on the Nobel Prize.Pritzer Home page In his 1979 book Architecture and its Interpretation, Juan Pablo Bonta put forward a theory about how buildings and architects achieve canonic status.Juan Pablo Bonta, Architecture and its Interpretation. London, Lund Humphries, 1979 He argued that a building and its architect achieve iconic or canonic status after a period when various critics and historians build up an interpretation that then becomes unquestioned for a significant period. If the text itself receives canonical status, then the status of the architect is further endorsed. For example, in the first edition of Siegfried Giedion's book Space Time and Architecture (1949) the Finnish architect Alvar Aalto was not mentioned at all. In the second edition he received more attention than any other architect, including Le Corbusier, who until then had been understood as the most important modernist architect. However, there is a difference between canonic status and \\"starchitect\\": as part of the \\"wow-factor\\" aspect of the term depends on current media visibility, it is used only to describe currently practicing architects: * Frank Gehry * √Ålvaro Siza * Massimiliano Fuksas * Kazuyo Sejima and Ryue Nishizawa (SANAA) * Sou Fujimoto * David Childs (Skidmore, Owings & Merrill) * Tadao Ando * Norman Foster * Jeanne Gang * Nicholas Grimshaw * Steven Holl * Toyo Ito * I.M.

For the child abuse scandal, see Casa Pia child sexual abuse scandal. The Castle of S√£o Jorge, the Casa's first location The Casa Pia is a Portuguese institution founded by Maria I, known as A Pia (\\"Mary the Pious\\"), and organized by Police Intendant Pina Manique in 1780, following the social disarray of the 1755 Lisbon earthquake. For almost three centuries, thousands of young boys and girls were raised by Casa Pia, including many public personalities, called casapianos. Casa Pia is Portugal's largest educational institution dedicated to helping youngsters in risk of social exclusion or without parental support. The organisation is composed of ten schools and enrolls approximately 4700 students. In addition to standard schooling, the organisation also provides boarding for children in need. It strives to enable these youngsters to become healthy and successful members of society, by developing intellectual, manual, and physical traits, in an environment promoting spiritual, moral, and religious values. The institution is proud to have had amongst its students many outstanding Portuguese personalities, including politicians, journalists, and artists. The first location was in Castle of S√£o Jorge of Lisbon, an important center of production for the Portuguese Royal Navy and Army, and also for vocational education: masters trained at Casa Pia, when returned to their home, instruct others in the same profession. More advanced alumns may advance to professional careers. Next level course studies at London (for medicine), the Portuguese Royal Navy academy, Rome, and the Portuguese Academy. Two years after the death of Pina Manique, the Casa Pia closed due to the occupation of the Castle of S√£o Jorge by the French troops of Junot. The school reopened in 1812 at Convento do Desterro, and then the government moved the institution to Jer√≥nimos Monastery, Lisbon at 1833. In 1942, it created a network of homes for children.

It operated from 1972 until 1996, when problems at the plant became too expensive to fix. It was decommissioned and dismantled between 1997 and 2005, though some of the plant's nuclear waste is still stored on site, pending final disposal. History The Maine Yankee Atomic Power Company formed in 1966 with plans for a pressurized water reactor in Wiscasset, Maine, and a 40-year operating license. Construction of the $231 million ($ today) plant ran from 1968 to 1972, whereupon the plant became Maine's sole operating nuclear power plant. From then until 1996, the 900 megawatt reactor produced about 119 terawatt-hours of electricity, most of the state's energy.Maine Yankee website In Maine Yankee's most productive year, 1989, it produced 6,900 gigawatt-hours of electricity. Opposition Initial opposition for constructing the plant was led by Citizens for Safe Power, the Audubon Naturalist Council, the Natural Resources Council of Maine, and Maine‚Äôs Governor Kenneth M. Curtis, in the form of a petition to the Atomic Energy Commission, asking for the suspension of the plants operating license due to the concern with environmental and safety issues. The group failed to stop construction but succeeded in persuading the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to impose stricter environmental standards and monitoring. After the malfunction of the Three Mile Island power plant in Pennsylvania, citizens Raymond and Patricia Shadis of Wiscasset led a 1,000 people in a march to the capital of Maine to propose a statewide anti-nuclear petition. The initiative to eliminate nuclear power in Maine was voted on several times between 1982 and 1987, but never passed. Finally in 1987, after narrowly missing a vote to shut down the power plant, the Nuclear Regulatory Committee (NRC), decided to investigate the power plant for safety violations. Closure A lengthy Nuclear Regulatory Commission investigation started in 1995, following allegations of safety problems at the plant. The NRC staff identified so many problems that Maine Yankee Atomic Power Co. decided \\"it would be too costly to correct these deficiences to the extent required by the NRC and decided to shut the plant down\\".Stephanie Cooke (2009).

It broadcasts in many Russian cities, some of the former Soviet republics (through partnerships with local radio stations), and via the Internet. The current editor-in-chief is Alexei Venediktov. History Echo of Moscow became famous during the events of 1991 Soviet coup d'√©tat attempt - it was one of the few news outlets that spoke against the State Committee on the State of Emergency. The Committee's decree number 3 on the suspension of Echo's broadcast is now regarded as a prestigious state award by the station's journalists. According to editor-in-chief Alexei Venediktov, the special KGB Alfa group made several attempts to cut the radio's access to the transmitter, but its employees managed to connect the studio directly to the transmitter through the telephone line and continue broadcasting. From the first day of its existence Echo of Moscow adhered to one rule: ¬´All significant points of view about events should be presented¬ª. Journalists have been jokingly calling the station ¬´Ear of Moscow¬ª. Most of Echo of Moscow's content consists of news and talk shows focusing on social and political issues, where the station tries to represent different points of view. Alexey Venediktov has been the station's chief editor since 1998. Radio hosts of the station include Victor Shenderovich, Yulia Latynina, Sergey Parkhomenko, Alexander Nevzorov, Yevgenia Albats, Vladimir Kara-Murza, Vladimir Ryzhkov, Yevgeny Yasin and Sophie Shevardnadze. Yulia Latynina is the most popular presenter at the radio station. In addition to broadcasting, Echo of Moscow runs a website that publishes analytical and factual materials in a variety of fields including international and domestic political affairs, social developments and cultural trends. The articles are written by well-known political analysts, academic researchers, columnists and public figures. Among the website's authors are Dmitrii Bykov, Matvey Ganapolsky, Alexey Navalny, Victor Shenderovich, and a number of others, who have sustained national and international acclaim in their areas of expertise. The Echo of Moscow site is an authoritative source of information, and its publications are regularly cited, relied on and reproduced by major Russian internet publications and other media sources. As of 2018 Echo of Moscow is majority owned by Gazprom Media which holds 66% of its shares, the remaining 34% are held by minority shareholders, including 18% held by editor-in-chief Alexei Venediktov. Approximately 900,000 people in Moscow and 1,8 million in other Russian regions listen to Echo of Moscow daily. According to TNS Global (Moscow, summer 2011), the most common listeners are middle class and upper middle class Russians 40 years and older with a higher education, residing in the city of Moscow.

In October 2017, the station was broken into by an assailant who pepper-sprayed a security guard and soon afterwards stabbed Tatyana Felgengauer, one of Echo's top presenters, in the neck. Her injuries were life-threatening, but she was able to make a full recovery thanks to timely medical intervention. The station described the attacker as an Israeli, quoting \\"informed sources\\". Forensic medical expertise determined him to be a paranoid schizophrenic, and he was sentenced to compulsory medical treatment by the court. Critics and controversy In September 2009, numerous chief editor replies point out that Gazprom and/or other stock-holders did not interfere with informational policy and were not allowed to. On 1 November 2014, the station received an official Roskomnadzor warning that a program the station had aired about Ukraine contained \\"information justifying war crimes\\". A radio station can be closed down if it receives two Roskomnadzor warnings in one year.

Luis Mart√≠n Garc√≠a, S.J. Very Rev. Luis Mart√≠n Garc√≠a, S.J. (19 August 1846 ‚Äì 18 April 1906) was a Spanish Jesuit, elected the twenty-fourth Superior General of the Society of Jesus. Early years and formation The third of six brothers, Mart√≠n was born of humble parentage. After primary education in his own village he entered the seminary of Burgos in 1858, where he spent six years. His intellectual inclination led him to join the Society of Jesus in 1864. He began his philosophy studies in L√©on, but revolution in Spain and anti-clericalism forced him to move to France where he completed his courses, first in Vals, and then in Poyanne. There, he also taught humanities and rhetoric before doing his theology (1873‚Äì77). He was ordained on 14 September 1876.P√©rez Goyena, Antonio. \\"Luis Martin y Garcia.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 9. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 8 June 2019. Professor and rector Soon after the anti-religious law of Ferry (1880) compelled Jesuits to leave France. Fortunately the restoration of the Spanish monarchy in the 1870s had now made it possible to repatriate Jesuits back to Spain. On his return to Castile, Mart√≠n, though a man of letters, was redirected towards the Biblical studies and teaching. He became was made Rector of the Seminary of Salamanca from 1880 to 1884, then director of the journal El Mensajero del Corazon de Jesus, followed by the appointment as Superior of the Centre of Superior studies of Deusto-Bilbao (the future University of Deusto) Provincial of Castile As Rector of the seminary of Salamanca he had shown qualities of leadership and commitment to spiritual and intellectual formation that led the Superior General to appoint him Provincial of Castile in 1886. He handled tactfully the deep divisions between Carlists and Integrists that were plaguing Catholics in Spain‚Äîparticularly in the Basque area‚Äîincluding the Jesuits. Called to Rome: Vicar General Martin was called to Rome by Anton Anderledy to first pilot a projected document of studies in the Society. A few hours before his death (1892) Anderledy made him Vicar General of the Society, effectively entrusting him with the calling and organizing the General Congregation that would elect a new Superior General. The political tension between the Church and the new Kingdom of Italy was making it difficult for the Congregation to meet in Italy. Martin obtained from Pope Leo XIII that the Congregation meet in Loyola, (Spain). This is the only General Congregation to have met outside Italy. General Congregation XXIV The 24th General congregation opened on 24 September 1892. Martin was elected on the second ballot (42 on 70) and declared Superior General (2 October). The Congregation over, Mart√≠n took a round-about route back to Fiesole, Italy in order to visit France, England, Ireland, Belgium and Germany. This was his only visit to countries which would provide many of the problems of his Generalate. Martin's problems in dealing with Northern European Jesuits can be better understood if one remembers that the Jesuit dissidents with whom he was familiar in Spain were of the reactionary and anti-intellectual type. This experience did little to prepare him to understand the more liberal ideas of northern European Jesuits. Martin‚Äôs government * Committing himself to govern ad mentem congregationis Martin wrote several letters to the whole Society that were expression of a concern voiced by the Congregation‚Äôs fathers: a letter on Religious Discipline (respecting the religious enclosure) (1893), and two (1894 and 1895) on the Temporal Administration of Goods (the spirit of Religious Poverty). Other important letters echoed papal documents on the Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola (Pope Leo XIII, in 1900) and on Biblical Studies (Pope Pius X, 1904). * Relations with Pope Leo XIII and Pope Pius X were warm and encouraging. Given the circumstances (The loss of the Papal States was not yet accepted and the Pope was considering himself a 'Prisoner in the Vatican') Martin felt the need of giving them unsparing support, whatever initiatives they took, especially through the journal Civilt√† Cattolica). Following up on a decree of the General Congregation he moved back the headquarters of the Society of Jesus from Fiesole to Rome (1895). * In France, following on the initiative of Pope Leo XIII, he encouraged the Jesuits to reconcile themselves with the republican ideals. All over the Northern European countries he encouraged greater involvement in social questions (implementing the encyclical Rerum novarum of 1893) * In England, in the face of strong opposition he successfully opened or reopened Jesuit schools (Wimbledon, Stamford Hill, Campion Hall, Oxford) * He opened news missions areas (Jamaica, Honduras) entrusting them to the American Jesuits and sent a Visitor to far away Australia (1895). The apostle of the negro slaves, Peter Claver was canonized in 1888 and later (1896) declared patron saint of the missions among the Africans. * His main concern however seems to have been his own country, Spain, where he succeeded in rooting out integrist tendencies among Jesuits in spite of the backing they were having from highly placed Vatican officials. He gave strong support to intellectual work and encouraged the launching of the journal Razon y Fe (1901). * Historians are particularly grateful to Martin for having initiated (at the request of GC 24) a scientifically critical edition of the documents pertaining to the foundation and early years of the Society. The publication of the Monumenta Historica Societatis Iesu were started in Madrid in 1894 and carried on later in Rome. He launched also the major projects of comprehensive history of the Society in Spain (Astrain), France (Fouqueray), England (Hughes), Germany (Duhr), Italy (Tacchi-Venturi), Belgium-Netherlands (Poncelet), Portugal, etc. * Towards the end of his life, after the election of Pope Pius X, Martin had to face the crisis of Modernism (Roman Catholicism). Modernists were hunted and expelled from the Church. So was it for George Tyrrell, English Jesuit, who was expelled from the Society and excommunicated in 1906 in spite of Martin‚Äôs intervention. Many others were condemned if not expelled. The Bollandists were also in trouble. * Membership of the Society steadily increased during his tenure: from 13,274 when Martin took office (1892) to 15,661 in 1906. Illness and death Even at the beginning of his term Mart√≠n's physical health had been poor and it grew steadily worse with the years. In 1905, a tumor forced the amputation of his right arm. Pope Pius X granted him permission to celebrate mass despite his disability, a privilege for which he was most grateful. The cancer, however, soon invaded his lungs and he died in Rome, on 18 April 1906.The Christian Family, Vol. 1, Society of the Divine Word, 1906, p. 281 Writings * Epistolae Selectae, Roma. * Memorias del P.

The main camp for the rebels was located a mile from Scullabogue on top of Carrigbyrne Hill. The rebels had rounded perceived loyalists of both sexes and all ages who were mainly held in a barn to prevent their supplying the military with intelligence of rebel movements. At dawn on 5 June, the bulk of the rebel army attacked the nearby town of New Ross leaving behind a small number of guards in charge of the captives. The battle at New Ross was a heavy defeat for the rebels who lost almost 3,000 men.

Glasgow, Cameron & Ferguson, 1859. pp. 293‚Äì294 Massacre Massacre at Scullabogue - illustrated by George Cruikshank (1845) Thomas Cloney, a rebel commander with the rank of General, present at the Battle of New Ross, reported: The news had incensed certain elements of the rebel force stationed at Scullabogue, who joined with the deserters in agitating for revenge against the prisoners. The prisoners' guards twice prevented the gathering mob from harming them but eventually gave in to the crowd by allowing the executions by musket-shot of over a dozen particularly hated individuals. However, all semblance of control was quickly lost and the barn was soon torched. People trying to escape the barn were shot, stabbed and beaten to death or forced back into the flames. Only two men are thought to have escaped the flames of Scullabogue Barn. One was named Richard Grandy, and the other was Loftus Frizzel. At least twelve, and possibly thirteen men alleged to have taken part in the massacre were executed after the rebellion was suppressed; a further two were transported.Gahan, D. \\"The Scullabogue Massacre, 1798\\", History Ireland, v4 (1996), 3 Although the massacre has been presented in some sources as sectarian in origin, up to 20 of the victims were loyalist Catholics, and three of the seventeen rebel guards linked directly with the massacre by subsequent depositions (John Ellard, John Turner and Robert Mills) were Protestants. Mills gave detailed evidence on the activities of the other guards, and was set free despite having admitted personally attacking prisoners with his pike. Memorials There is a Scullabogue Memorial stone in the graveyard of Old Ross Church of Ireland church. The theme is one of reconciliation. The Scullabogue Barn itself was controversially knocked down and covered over by the current proprietor in the 1990s. There is, however, no state memorial to the people who were massacred during this incident.

It is the oldest university in Brazil and one of the largest universities in the northern region of Brazil. It offers a wide array of degrees, with 645 research groups and 65 graduate courses. History The UFAM is the oldest university in Brazil. It was founded on January 17, 1909 as the Free University School of Man√°os, born of the same late-19th century economic boom that gave Manaus its rubber barons. The school later becoming the University of Man√°os. The economic downturn that followed the collapse of the rubber market, as well as the logistical problems of being located in the Amazon Rainforest, led the school to curtail its academic offerings down to just a law program. On June 12, 1962, Brazilian federal law 4.069-A under the authorship of Senator Arthur Virg√≠lio Jr. reinvigorated the school as the state-owned University of Amazonas. In June 2002, the school was renamed the Federal University of Amazonas. As of 2017, the rector of UFAM is Professor Sylvio Puga. Famous former students include Eduardo Braga (former governor of Amazonas). Undergraduate programs Currently the Federal University of Amazonas is composed of six campuses, holders of different academic calendars.

As the battle progressed, Cynegils' forces advanced up Win Hill, and Edwin's retreated behind a temporary wall they had built near the summit.

Shortly thereafter he adopted the artistic moniker \\"Afrika\\" and began working as an artist himself. In 1987 he starred as Bananan, the lead character in the groundbreakingly avant garde film Assa by Russian film director Sergei Solovyov. Afrika works mainly in performance and installation art.

He is the presiding deity of Guruvayur temple, who is being worshiped as Shri Krishna in his child form, also known as Guruvayur Unnikkannan (Guruvayur baby Krishna). Even though the deity is that of chaturbahu (four handed) Vishnu, the concept (Sankalpam) of the people is that the deity is the infant form of Lord Krishna. The deity represents the purna rupa (full manifestation) revealed by baby Krishna to his parents Vasudeva and Devaki immediately after his advent in Kamsa's jail. So this is the reason why baby Krishna is worshipped on a Vishnu deity. The temple is located in the town of Guruvayur, Thrissur district, Kerala, India, which is named after the deity itself. The word Guruvayurappan, meaning Lord of Guruvayur, comes from the words Guru (‡¥ó‡µÅ‡¥∞‡µÅ) referring to Brihaspati, the Guru of the Devas, Vayu (‡¥µ‡¥æ‡¥Ø‡µÅ), the God of Wind and Appan (‡¥Ö‡¥™‡µç‡¥™‡¥®‡µç‚Äç), meaning 'father' or 'Lord' in Malayalam. Since Guru and Vayu installed Krishna's deity, the name Guruvayurappan was given to the deity.http://www.guruvayurdevaswom.org It is believed that the idol of Guruvayurappan was worshipped by Vasudeva and Devaki, the parents of Krishna, and represents the full manifestation of Vishnu, and later was worshipped by Krishna, an Avatar of Vishnu Himself. The deity is made of a stone called \\"Patala Anjanam\\" or black bismuth and is in the standing pose with four arms, carrying the Panchajanya (shanku or conch), the Sudarshana Chakra (chakra or disc), the Koumodaki (gada or mace) and padma (lotus).http://www.guruvayurdevaswom.org/minstallation.shtml Story of the Deity Morganville, New Jersey, United States Sree Guruvayurappan Temple, Salem Though the main story about the idol is just starting since the story of Lord Krishna, its antiquity goes long back, since it is believed to have constructed by Lord Vishnu himself. The story is told in detail in the section 'Gurupavanapura Mahatmyam' from Narada Purana. King Parikshit, the grandson of Arjuna and the son of Abhimanyu, died of a bite by the poisonous snake Takshaka, due to a curse which fell upon him. King Janamejaya, his son, wanted to avenge his father's death by killing all the snakes, including Takshaka, and for that, he conducted a fierce yajna called 'Sarpastra' (Snake sacrifice). Thousands of innocent snakes died in the yajna fire, but Takshaka could not be killed because he had drank amrit. Due to this act, Janamejaya was affected by the curse of snakes, and got affected by leprosy. He tried numerous ways to cure his disease, but none of them worked. He lost his hope to live. At that time, sage Atreya (the son of sage Atri) came to visit him and told him to worship Lord Mahavishnu in Guruvayur. He then also told the glory of the temple. It is as follows: Long ago, in the beginning of Padma Kalpa, when Lord Brahma was undergoing his work of creation, Lord Mahavishnu appeared before him. When the Creator told that he and his creations want 'mukthi' without the bondage of 'karma', Lord Vishnu made an idol of himself and presented it to his friend. Lord Brahma worshipped the idol with deep obeisances for a long time, and in Varaha Kalpa, he gifted it to a sage named Sutapas and his wife Prsni, who were meditating upon Lord Vishnu for begetting a child. Sutapas and Prashni continued their prayer after getting the idol, and finally the Lord appeared before them. When they expressed their wish, which was that they want a son just like the Lord, he told that would himself be born as their son in three successive births, and in all the three births, they could worship his idol made by himself. As he said, in the first birth in Satya Yuga, the Lord took birth as Prsnigarbha, the son of Sutapas and Prsni. In that birth, he prophesied the importance of brahmacharya and gave darshan to his devotee Dhruva, to whom he made a special universe called 'Dhruvaloka'. When Sutapas and Prsni were reborn as Kashyapa and Aditi, the Lord took birth as their son Vamana in Treta Yuga. Finally, when they were reborn as Vasudeva and Devaki, the Lord took birth as their eighth son Krishna. In all the three births, they had the fortune to worship the holy idol of Lord Vishnu made by the Lord himself. After coming back from his studies, Lord Krishna took the idol worshipped by his parents to Dwarka, his new abode. He built a temple for the idol here, and daily worshipped the idol with deep obeisances, despite being an avatar of Lord Vishnu himself. Finally, Dwapara Yuga came to an end. Now it was time for the Lord to return to his original abode. Before leaving to Vaikuntha, he called his friend and disciple Uddhava and told that Dwarka would be affected by a serious Tsunami a week later, and the lone non-natural survivor of the flood will be the divine idol worshipped by his parents in three births. He also advised him to hand over the idol to Brihaspati, the Guru of Devas who would come at that moment, and leave to Badrikashram for doing penance for the rest of the lifetime. As the Lord prophesied, there came a huge Tsunami on the week followed. Dwarka, which was filled by beautiful palaces, gardens and lush greenery, was completely destroyed in the Tsunami. Only the top of a huge mountain survived. Uddhava had already left to Badrikashram for doing penance, and before leaving, he called Brihaspati and informed him about the idol. By the time Brihaspati reached Dwarka, everything was over. But soon, he saw the holy idol of Lord Vishnu floating on the seawater. Brihaspati was overjoyed, but he could not go near the idol due to the nature of the Tsunami and also it was floating towards the other side. Then he called Vayu, the wind god and one among his important disciples. Vayu, with the help of Varuna, the sea god, created huge waves towards the point where Brihaspati was standing. Brihaspati took the idol in his hands, but he could not answer where to install it. Suddenly, sage Parashurama appeared there and told them to install the idol in an apt location in Bhargava Kshetra. the land made by him with his axe. According to the wishes of the Sage, Brihaspati and Vayu took the idol on their hands, and travelled by sky southwards through the sky to find an apt location in Bhargava Kshetra. Suddenly, they saw a large, beautiful lake on the western side of Bhargava Kshetra, very close to the sea. Nearby it, there was lush greenery. Birds chirped allover. Animals were running happily. Breeze spread everywhere. Brihaspati and Vayu realised something divine there. No sooner, they saw Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati dancing on the lake shore. Brihaspati and Vayu landed on the ground and prostrated before the divine parents of the world. Lord Shiva told them that he was waiting for their arrival, and that the apt location for installing the idol of Lord Vishnu was none other the place where they were standing. He also told that it was there the ten princes called Prachetas came for penance upon Lord Vishnu for attaining the status of Prajapati, and he discoursed Rudra Gita to them. Lord Shiva then declared that since the idol is to be installed by Brihaspati, the Guru and Vayu, the place will be called as 'Guruvayur', and devotees will find solace from the troubles of Kali Yuga. After hearing this, Brihaspati called Vishwakarma, the divine architect and told him to construct a temple for the deity. Vishwakarma constructed the temple within minutes, with all the necessary components. Brihaspati and Vayu installed the idol with all necessary rituals. Lord Shiva performed the first pooja to the deity. Demigods headed by Indra showered flowers. Sage Narada sang songs. Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati, who were present throughout the divine moment, later shifted themselves to Mammiyur, a place on the opposite bank of the lake, where they appeared as a Swayambhu Linga along with their children Ganesha, Kartikeya and Shasta. Since the idol was installed by Brihaspati and Vayu, the place came to be known as Guruvayur, and the deity came to be known as Guruvayurappan, meaning 'The Lord of Guruvayur'. It is considered that Lord Vishnu resides here with his full power as in Vaikuntha, and thus the place is called 'Bhuloka Vaikuntha'. A darshan here is considered to be complete only by worshipping Lord Shiva in Mammiyur. All problems will be solved by this, and even if you die, it is considered great. After hearing this story, Janamejaya proceeded to Guruvayur along with his family, and stayed there for a year. During these days, he worshipped the Lord with deep obeisances and also visited Mammiyur temple to worship Lord Shiva. Finally, on the day before the end of his worship, he had a darshan of Lord Krishna, after which his disease was cured. He returned to his country, and lived happily thereafter. Construction of the temple Guruvayoor temple An astrologer told a Pandya King that he was destined to die from a cobra bite on a particular day. He was advised to go and pray before Guruvayurappan. The king spent years in meditation and prayer at the feet of the deity. One day, the King realized that the time of his death had passed. He came back to his palace and asked the astrologer why the prediction was wrong. The wise man showed him the mark on his left foot where the cobra had bitten him. Since the king was wholly absorbed in the Lord, Who alone can dispense with fate, he did not feel the sting. In gratitude, the King built the temple at Guruvayur and set apart funds for the daily routine of the temple. Most of the current temple building dates to the 16th and 17th centuries, although rich devotees funded extensions and additions later. The deepastamba (column of lights) was erected in 1836 by a devotee from Thiruvananthapuram. The temple has gopurams in the east and the west. The eastern gopuram has an inscription which refers to the town as \\"Gurupavanapura\\". The western gopuram was built in 1747.http://www.guruvayurdevaswom.org/htemple2.shtml Legends Krishnanattam King Manaveda and Vilwamangalam:King Manaveda told Vilwamangalam about his ambition to view Krishnahttp://sangeethasabha.blogspot.in/2010/08/manavedans- krishnageethi-story.htmlhttps://www.templepurohit.com/guruvayoorappan/ The next day the Swamiyar told him that Guruvayurappan has given his consent and Manavedan can see Guruvayurappan playing in the early hours of the morning at the platform of the Elanji tree.He could only see and not touch Him. When as per this agreement, Manavedan saw Guruvayurappan in the form of little child Sri Krishna, he was so excited that he forgot himself and, rushed to embrace little Sree Krishna.Guruvayoorappan immediately disappeared saying, \\"Vilwamangalam did not tell me that this will happen \\". However, Manavedan got one peacock feather from the head gear of Bhagavan Krishna. The peacock feather was incorporated in the headgear for the character of Sri Krishna in the dance drama Krishnanattam based on his own text krishnageeti which is composed of eight chapters viz, Avatharam, Kaliyamardanam, Rasakrida, Kamsavadham, Swayamvaram, Banayuddham, Vividavadham and Swargarohanam.. It was performed near the sanctum sanctorum of the Guruvayur Temple. On the ninth day, Avatharam was repeated as the Samoothiri felt that it was not auspicious to end the series with the demise of Lord Krishna. The blessed art form is still maintained by guruvayur devaswom and staged as an offering by devotees. Shopkeeper and boy: Once, a poor boy could not get even a morsel of food to appease his hunger, and stole a banana from a nearby fruit shop. Being a devotee of Lord Guruvayurappan, he dropped half the banana into the 'hundi' and he ate the other half. The shop-keeper caught hold of the boy and accused him of the theft. The boy admitted his guilt. The shop-keeper did not have the heart to punish this innocent boy, but to teach him a lesson, he ordered him to walk around the temple a certain number of times. The shop-keeper was aghast when he saw Lord Guruvayurappan follow the little boy around the temple. That night the Lord came to the shopkeeper in a dream and explained, \\"Since I have also had a share in the stolen banana I am bound to share the punishment, too. So, I followed the boy around the temple.\\" Nenmini Unni: Once a Nenmini Namboodiri, the main priest (melsanthi) at the Guruvayur temple, instructed his twelve-year-old son to offer the Nivedyam to the Lord. There was no assistant priest (keezhsanthi) on that day and the Nenmini Namboodiri had to go out on an urgent engagement, as called by a devotee. The son, Unni, offered a Nivedyam of cooked rice to the Lord; in his simplicity, he believed that the deity would eat the food, but the deity did not move. Unni bought some salted mangoes and curd from a neighborhood vendor, thinking that the Lord would prefer this, mixed the curd with rice and offered it again. The deity again remained unmoved. Unni cajoled, requested, coaxed and in the end threatened, but the deity remained unmoved. He wept because he believed he had failed and shouted at the Lord, exclaiming that his father would beat him. The Lord could not bear it any more, and made the Nivedyam disappear. The boy left the temple satisfied. Unni did not know that the Nivedyam offered to the Lord was the Variyar's prerequisite. When Variyar returned to the temple, he saw the empty plate and became very angry with Unni, but Unni insisted that God had, in fact, eaten the offering. Unni's innocent words made Variyar furious, as he believed the boy had eaten the offering himself and was lying. His father was about to beat Unni, but just then an Asareeri (celestial voice) was heard saying, \\"What Unni told is right. I am guilty. Unni is innocent. I ate all the food that he had offered me. There's no need to punish him\\". Nenmini family is still there in Guruvayur, and is still wealthy. It also sponsors the Saptami (7th day) Vilakku during the annual Ekadasi festival in the Malayalam month of Vrischikam. Statue of Poonthanam Namboothiri, Guruvayur Poonthanam and Melpathur: Poonthanam was a contemporary of Melpathur Narayana Bhattathiri, another famous poet associated with Guruvayur. Melpathur, the author of the Sanskrit work Narayaneeyam, was a famed scholar who out of pride refused Poonthanam's request to read his Jnanappana, a work in Malayalam. Legend has it that Guruvayurappan, impressed by Poonthanam's humility and devotion preferred his works to those of Bhattathiri's and once even rebuked Bhattathiri for ignoring Poonthanam's Santhanagopala Paana saying he preferred Poonthanam‚Äôs genuine bhakti to Bhattathiri‚Äôs vibhakti.

The DCB, which was initiated in 1959, is a collaboration between the University of Toronto and Laval University. Fifteen volumes have so far been published with more than 8,400 biographies of individuals who died or whose last known activity fell between the years 1000 and 1930. The entire print edition is online, along with some additional biographies to the year 2000. Establishment of the project The project was undertaken following a bequest to the University of Toronto from businessman, James Nicholson for the establishment of a Canadian version of the United Kingdom's Dictionary of National Biography. In the spring of 1959, George Williams Brown was appointed general editor and the University of Toronto Press, which had been named publisher, sent out some 10,000 announcements introducing the project. Work started in July of that year. 1 July was designated the formal date of the Dictionary's establishment, not coincidentally the same day Canada's confederation is celebrated. New ground was broken when on 9 March 1961, the French edition of the dictionary was established. No similar research or publication project of this size in English and French had ever been undertaken before in Canada. Marcel Trudel was appointed directeur adjoint for Dictionnaire biographique du Canada, Universit√© Laval the publisher. It had been decided from the start that for the project to have true resonance for Canadians, the French and English editions of the Dictionary would be identical in content, save for language, and each volume of the Dictionary would be issued simultaneously. The project by its nature required not only much translation, as articles would originate in English and in French, but close coordination as well. Publication commences The first volume of the Dictionary of Canadian Biography appeared in 1966 with 594 biographies covering the years 1000 to 1700. The publishers had looked at other similar projects, such as the Dictionary of National Biography (DNB) and the Dictionary of American Biography (DAB) and concluded a different approach was required. In those dictionaries, volumes were arranged alphabetically and published over a span of years. For that reason, until the last volume was published (63 for the DNB up to 22 January 2001; 20 for the DAB to the end of 1935), no historical period could be completely covered until the last volume appeared. Those who died subsequently were added in future volumes in a period arrangement. The DCB, it was decided, would publish in a period arrangement throughout, with volumes arranged chronologically, and with each volume covering a specific range of years with biographies arranged alphabetically. The volume in which a biography was to appear was determined by death date of the individual in question or, if that was unknown, the date of their last known activity. Volumes were to be of approximate equal size, with the span of time covered within each reducing as biographies moved into the 20th century. A major drawback to the system was the fact that few people likely would be aware of the death dates of many people and therefore would not know in which volume an individual's biography would be found. This was to be addressed by cumulative indexes and epitome volumes. Some advantages to the period approach were practical ones ‚Äì biographies more or less linked by time period would also bring together scholars specializing in those periods, thus making research, editing and cross-checking easier, and readers would not have to keep reacquainting themselves with the historical period the individuals lived in. Additionally, future revisions would be limited to the volumes in question and not the entire series. The subjects of biographies were broad. While noteworthy Canadians born and resident in Canada and Canadians who made their reputations abroad were to be included, so were persons from other countries who made a contribution to Canadian life. A general rule was to exclude those persons who had not set foot in what is now Canada, even if their influence on Canada was great. As for those born outside of Canada, focus was to be given to their life in Canada. A guide was issued for the writers of Volume I biographies, and repeated for subsequent volumes: \\"The biography should be a fresh and scholarly treatment of the subject based upon reliable sources (where possible first-hand) precise and accurate in statements of fact, concise, but presented in attractive literary form.... the aim is to secure independent and original treatments and not mere compilations of preceding accounts.\\" The biographies themselves were to range from about 200 words to a maximum of 8,000 to 10,000 words. There would typically be several hundred contributors for each volume. An additional feature, taking advantage of the period approach, was the inclusion of several historical essays to further establish the historical context of many of the subjects of the biographies. Future volumes would also include historical essays, but not all. Subsequent volumes published Volume II, covering the years 1701 to 1740, appeared in 1969. Biographies of 578 individuals appeared within its pages. David Hayne was now general editor, having replaced Brown who died suddenly during the preparation of Volume I; Andr√© Vachon directeur adjoint. By this time, there had been an important development which would have the effect of dramatically altering the publication sequence. Canada's centennial was celebrated in 1967 and, accordingly, the government of Canada created the Centennial Commission, in part to promote historical awareness. One of the first acts of the Commission was to award a grant to the DCB specifically towards biographical research in the years 1850 to 1900. As a result, in 1967 it was decided to start preparing volumes for the 19th century. Volume X, ranging from 1871 to 1880, was the first volume to be assembled, and it appeared in 1972 with the biographies of 574 people,The dustcover for Volume X contradicts this figure, stating instead 547 biographies appear within. many of whom were instrumental in the creation of Canada itself. From this time forward, while the original sequence of volumes continued, a parallel sequence of volumes for the 19th century appeared as well. In 1974, the fourth volume, Volume III, was published. The biographies of 550 individuals who died between the years 1741 and 1770 were featured. A period of long editorial stability was established as Francess G. Halpenny, who succeeded Hayne in 1969, would hold the position of general editor for 20 years. Jean Hamelin, who became directeur adjoint in 1973, would hold the French editorial reins until his death in 1998. The second volume of the 19th century appeared in 1976: Volume IX. Some 524 biographies by 311 contributors ranged from 400 to 12,000 words in length, encompassing the years 1861 to 1870. It was decided then not to include an introductory historical essay as that would be more properly included in a broader summing up of the era in a later volume. The sixth volume published, Volume IV, brought to completion the 18th century. Appearing in 1979, 504 biographies spanned the years 1771 to 1800. That same year, Volume I was reprinted with corrections. Volume II was also reprinted, with corrections, and the seventh volume appeared, both in 1982. Volume XI contained the biographies of 586 noteworthy Canadians who died between 1881 and 1890. A new feature was introduced in this volume: indexes by occupation and geography. This new feature was to be incorporated in new volumes and in reprints of previous volumes as well as separate indexes, one of which appeared in 1981 for Volumes I‚ÄìIV. Volume V soon followed, published in 1983. It ranged the years 1801 to 1820, with 502 biographies from 269 contributors. Then, three more volumes followed in 1985, 1987 and 1988 bringing a total of 11: Volume VIII (1851 to 1860) with 521 biographies; Volume VI (1821 to 1835) with 479 biographies; Volume VII (1836 to 1850) with 538 biographies. Finally, in 1990, the twelfth volume appeared, completing the 19th century. The 597 biographies of Volume XII (1891 to 1900) brought a total of 6,520 biographies to the project as its first main phase drew to a close, and long-time general editor Halpenny retired. An index for these first twelve volumes soon appeared allowing readers to quickly access all 6,520 biographies and all the thousands of other individuals mentioned in those biographies. Volumes on the 20th century Volume XII of the DCB said that the first three volumes of the 20th century were in preparation: Volume XIII (1901‚Äì1910); Volume XIV (1911‚Äì1918); Volume XV (1919‚Äì1925). But when Volume XIII appeared in 1994, with Ramsay Cook as new general editor, the intervening years were described as \\"hav[ing] been among the most difficult in the history of this Canadian institution.\\" Severe financial restraints were described and a more \\"modest\\" plan was announced, with each volume covering a decade instead of the shorter intervals previously planned for post-1910. An additional volume was said to be in preparation up to the end of 1940. Nevertheless, Volume XIII continued in the tradition of past volumes, with 648 biographies by 438 contributors, covering the previously announced range of years of 1901 to 1910. Volume XIV was published in 1998, and marked a dramatic superficial change: a colourful dust-jacket featuring images of some 52 prominent Canadians, a stark contrast to the modest tan covers of previous volumes which featured only text. The contents continued in the scholarly style of the past volumes, however, with 622 biographies of individuals for the years 1911 to 1920. The introduction suggested that the financial and staff pressures were \\"becoming more acute\\" but held out the hope that \\"funds from a wider variety of granting agencies\\" would permit the project to continue as planned. Volume XV appeared in 2005, with a solemn tribute to Hamelin who had died in 1998, and an \\"au revoir\\" to Cook who completed his participation with the DCB upon publication of the volume. R√©al B√©langer had since 1998 replaced Hamelin as directeur general adjoint, and John English has replaced Cook as General Editor. The 619 biographies contained within would bring a total of 8,419 biographies spanning the years 1000 to 1930 to the project. And, as a sign of the rapidly changing means of communications the DCB was encountering, mention was made of the millennium project to distribute for free CD-ROMs of the contents of the first 14 volumes of the project to educational institutions and of the intellectual properties licensing agreement made with Library and Archives Canada in 2003 to make available on-line those same 14 volumes with some additional biographies afterwards. The on-line edition of the DCB now has incorporated the biographies of Volume XV, and includes about a dozen biographies of prominent Canadians who died between 1931 and 2000, including every prime minister who had died within that time period. Mention was also made of the financial problems which were making work more difficult, but also of the efforts of many Canadian institutions, corporations, agencies and individuals who made the continuation of the project possible. The DCB is preparing Volume XVI which will cover the years 1931 to 1940, and is in the research stages for additional volumes which will encompass the years 1941 to 1980. When this phase of production is complete, there will be more than 10,000 biographies. Book on Prime Ministers In 2007, the DCB published Canada‚Äôs Prime Ministers: Macdonald to Trudeau ‚Äì Portraits from the Dictionary of Canadian Biography. The 15 biographies therein reproduced those biographies which had appeared in the various volumes of the DCB already published, supplemented by the biographies of the prime ministers who have died since 1930. Evaluations The evaluations by professional historians have been overwhelmingly favourable.P. B.

Halpenny, \\"Twenty Years of Canadian Biography,\\" Transactions of the Royal Society of Canada (1986) 1: 193-201. Regarding the Maritimes, the Dictionary says little about early Indian leadership, but, says Godfrey, effectively covers French missionaries, and illuminates Acadia's relationship to France and New France. Volumes IX and X deemphasize Acadians and Indians, and focus mostly on politics as contests between elites. The treatment of Maritime economic and intellectual development suggests that the legendary mid-19th-century Golden Age was only a veneer.William G.

Haas Jr. Pavilion is an indoor arena in the western United States, on the campus of the University of California in Berkeley, California. It is the home venue of the Golden Bears men's and women's basketball, women's volleyball, and men's and women's gymnastics teams. The arena is located in the middle of the main sports complex, overlooking Evans Diamond (baseball) and Edwards Stadium (track/soccer). History The arena was originally opened in 1933 as the Men's Gym; it was renamed Harmon Gym in 1959, after Oakland financier A.K.P. Harmon, who donated the funds to build Cal's first indoor athletic facility in 1879. Lou Campanelli tried to have it renamed \\"Harmon Arena\\" when he became head coach, but it never really caught on. The playing surface, after being known as simply \\"Room 100\\" since the arena opened, was renamed Pete Newell Court in 1987 in honor of head coach Pete Newell, who led Cal to the national championship in 1959. Renovation Proposals for replacing the old gym were bandied about from the 1970s onward, but sentiment was strongly in favor of rebuilding it instead. As a result, the arena was heavily renovated from 1997 to 1999 after a donation of about $11 million from Walter A. Haas, Jr. of Levi Strauss & Co., building a new seating bowl within the existing walls. The new facility retains the intimate atmosphere of its predecessor, while having almost two times the seating capacity at 11,858 (originally 12,300 and later 11,877). In particular, there are no soundproofing devices. The arena contains The Bench, a courtside section that holds approximately 900 student fans. The amount of student seating doubled from the old arena, up to 2,600 from 1,300. It also holds the Pacific-10 Women's Basketball attendance record of 10,525 people, set during a game against rival Stanford University on February 23, 2008. The renovation, which cost $57.5 million, began after the final home game in March 1997 and was finished for the start of the 1999 season. During the construction, the basketball teams played at both the Kaiser Convention Center and the Oakland Arena in Oakland. Notable games On December 22, 2018, the 14th ranked California Bears Women's basketball team faced the number 1 ranked University of Connecticut Huskies Women's basketball team. The Connecticut women's basketball team prevailed 76-66 at Haas Pavilion. The game set attendance records at Haas Pavilion with over 10,000 fans in attendance. The 2009 men's basketball game between Cal and arch rival Stanford on February 14 was part of a special celebration commemorating the 100th season of Golden Bear basketball, as well as a recognition of the 50th anniversary of Cal's national title in 1959. On February 28, 2009 ESPN's College Gameday made its first appearance in Berkeley broadcasting live from inside Haas Pavilion for the men's basketball game against the #18 UCLA Bruins. Cal lost despite a large turnout. On January 21, 2009 Comcast Sportsnet Bay Area's Chronicle Live filmed their show inside Haas for the men's basketball game against Oregon, which Cal would win. Chronicle Live Host Greg Papa also called the play-by- play for the game which was televised on Comcast Sportsnet California.

Cape Verdean immigration to the United States began in the early 19th century. The first Cape Verdean immigrants aboard New England whaling ships, which would often pick up crewmen off the coast of Cape Verde. The presence of Cape Verdeans in the New England whaling inspired the fictional character Daggoo in Herman Melville's 1851 novel Moby- Dick.https://afropop.org/audio-programs/diaspora-encounters-kriolu-in-new- england-the-cape-verdean-american- storyhttps://www.kckcc.edu/files/docs/ejournal/volume-ten/number-two- october-2017/racial-villainy-cape-verdean-characters-in-white-authored-us- literature- teorey.pdfhttps://www.thesunchronicle.com/devices/features/stories/whaling- museum-exhibit-celebrating-cape-verdeans-portuguese-to-stop-at-attleboro- library/article_834cb20f-f5b4-51a6-bb6a-f9e390692fe0.html Yankee captains in the packet trade valued Cape Verdeans as crew, because they ‚Äúworked hard to save what they could while on board vessel they could be hired for much less money than American seamen. Furthermore, they made a disciplined crew.‚Äù. Quoted in The Cape Verdeans were universally regarded as \\"hardworking, honest seamen.\\" When all others abandoned the old sailing ships, the Cape Verdeans bought the decrepit vessels out of their earnings as seamen and kept patching them up with loving care. Eventually, they came to own almost all that remained of the New Bedford fleet, either by purchase or by default. In some cases, they received the ships as outright gifts and \\"sailed them all over the earth with their own crews and made a modest profit by whaling in the old and tried manner.\\" Following the abolition of slavery throughout the Portuguese Empire in 1869, the Cape Verde Islands suffered drought, starvation, and economic decline leading to a wave of mass emigration. Once on whaling ships and in America, Cape Verdean men were able to send home money and news of other family and friends already in ‚Äúthe land of opportunity.‚Äù They also sent bidons (gasoline barrels) full of food, clothes, and other items from New Bedford, Massachusetts; and Providence, Rhode Island. The latter are the oldest and largest Cape Verdean communities in the United States. These communities and new Cape Verdean communities are marked by close kinship ties and interdependence among families, a traditional Cape Verdean practice that has been passed down through the generations. One of the major forces that brought Cape Verdeans to the Americas was the whaling industry. American whalers from New Bedford first began travelling to the islands in the 1790s, and further developed their trade as time progressed into the 19th century. During this time, many Cape Verdeans joined American whaling crews in order to escape Cape Verde, a land plagued with poor natural resources and an often abusive Portuguese colonial government. By the mid-1800s New Bedford had transformed into an economic maritime center, where Cape Verdeans were not only about to excel in the whaling industry but in other maritime industries (such as fishing) as well. New Bedford Whaling Museum explains, ‚ÄúAs the 20th century went on and the ties between the islands and the port strengthened, entrepreneurs like Roy Teixeira, Henrique Mendes, Louis Lopes, Frank Lopes and Antonio Cardoza purchased, managed and owned packet ships like the Coriolanus, the Savoia, and the Arcturus... Importantly, not only did Cape Verdeans settle in New Bedford, but between 1860 and 1965 41% of the packets trading between New England and the Islands were owned by Cape Verdeans.‚Äù Many Cape Verdeans worked in the cranberry bogs for the cranberry industry in Southeastern Massachusetts.Semedo, Querino Kenneth J., \\"The Story Must Be Told : A Story of Cape Verdeans : A story about the forgotten cranberry bog workers, the Cape Verdean men and women who helped to build the cranberry industry\\" , University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, November 25, 1999.\\"Cranberry Harvest Trail Guide Information - Southeastern Massachusetts\\" , Cape Cod Cranberry Growers' Association Cape Verdean migration to the United States in the 19th century and early 20th century was composed of the islands' poorer classes. In 1922, the U.S. government restricted the immigration of peoples of color, greatly reducing Cape Verdean immigration. The new regulations also prevented Cape Verdean Americans from visiting the islands for fear of being denied reentry to the United States. The two communities thus were relatively isolated from each other for approximately 40 years. With doors to America closed, Cape Verdeans began to immigrate in larger numbers to Europe, South America, and West Africa along routes charted by commercial shipping and the Portuguese colonial empire. During the same period some Cape Verdean Americans migrated from the long-established East Coast communities to the steel towns of Ohio and Pennsylvania; and to California. In 1966, due to the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, the U.S. government relaxed its regulations, and a new wave of Cape Verdean immigration began. The new arrivals in Boston, Brockton, Taunton and Onset, Massachusetts; Pawtucket, Rhode Island; Waterbury, Connecticut; Brooklyn, and Yonkers, New York; and other communities on the East Coast met a Cape Verdean-American ethnic group whose members looked like them, but differed culturally. Separated for so long, the groups knew little of each other's recent history or treasured memories.Halter, Marilyn. ‚ÄúCape Verdeans in the U.S.‚Äù Full independence was achieved by Cape Verde on July 5, 1975 after a long struggle for complete rights and unrestricted control from the struggle of the country's colonial past. Though growing nationalism, prior efforts for independence slowly gained momentum and territory led by the efforts of the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC). This newfound independence allowed a new path that would be essential to the migration of Cape Verdean American as Cape Verde was one of few African countries allowing overflight of European and U.S. air travel. This was accompanied by two further actions of independence that aided Cape Verdean migration: broken political unity between Guinea in 1980, and the election of Antonio Monteiro which brought economic struggles that incited emigration.Cape Verde.

Dorchester, Massachusetts; Brockton, Massachusetts; Taunton, Massachusetts; New Bedford, Massachusetts; Pawtucket, Rhode Island; and Onset, Massachusetts are the fastest-growing new immigrant communities in the United States. There are an estimated 265,000 Cape Verdean immigrants and their descendants living in the United States, according to a June 2007 article in The New York Times. Cape Verdean Americans reside mostly in Massachusetts and Rhode Island. Some Cape Verdeans also settled in the Midwestern United States, Florida and California.  Assimilation  The Cape Verdeans suffered discrimination when they came to America. Cape Verdeans retained a unique culture apart from the groups of Afro Americans who were the descendants of slaves in the United States. This was especially true for those who settled outside the Cape Verde environments concentrated in New England, and settled in the Midwest. Due to their Catholic religion, most Cape Verdeans were related to other Catholics, who were mostly white. The Cape Verdeans maintained their own ethnic identity and lived in separate communities from other Afro American groups. However, during the civil rights struggles of the 60s, the Cape Verdeans saw similarities between their own struggle and that of African Americans and emerged a sense of solidarity with them. While some islands have a heavy European-descended population, most Cape Verdeans have African ancestry mixed with European and Moorish Jews. Because later people from all over the world settled in Cape Verde, not only Europeans, the population is one of the most unusual ethnic melting pots in the world. Due to this uniqueness, most Cape Verdeans choose to cite \\"Cape Verdean\\" as their race, which not only reflects a strong sense of Patriotism, but a sense of community that is only found among Cape Verdeans regardless of skin- tone.Everyculture: Cape Verdean American. Posted by Jane E. Spear. Retrieved September 5, 2012, to 2:08pm. For well over a century, the U.S. has hosted the largest proportion of the worldwide Cape Verdean diaspora residing in any one nation. One important consequence of the technological development in recent decades has been the emergence of Cape Verdean transnationalism on the Internet. S√≥nia Melo discusses how Cape Verdean websites have become important for linking diaspora communities with each other, for maintaining ties with Cape Verde, and for the local politics of emigrant communities in their countries of residence.Batalha, Lu√≠s and J√∏rgen Carling ed. 2008. Transnational Archipelago Additionally, most Cape Verdeans have a lighter skin color than Africans from the continent. This partially comes from the fact that in the beginning, Portuguese encouraged miscegenation between Portuguese colonizers and the members of African colonies throughout their empire (with the government often rewarding soldiers and officials with monetary or land benefits if they married indigenous people). Also, the prime location and solidarity found in the island allowed for interracial relationships to develop without traditional suppression. As a result, when it comes to hair textures, skin and eye colores there are a wide variety ranging from blue and blond eyes on the islands of Fogo and Brava, to crisp and darker shades on the island of Santiago. Yet it is not uncommon for nuclear families to have a variety of tones and textures for members. The uniqueness of Cape Verdeans is reflected in the Massachusetts census permitting a \\"Cape-Verdean\\" check-box for ethnic identification. Languages Generally, Cape Verdean Americans speak English, Portuguese, and Kriolu (or Crioulo). The Creole language is a mixture of Portuguese and the native African tongues spoken by slaves. Although much of the vocabulary stems from Portuguese, many of these words were no longer used in twentieth-century Portugal. The African tongues, mostly Mande, influenced Kriolu chiefly. Since the Republic of Cape Verde became independent of Portugal in 1975, Kriolu has become the dominant language among the islanders. Creole has not received official status nor has it been standardized across the country. Several scholars note that this is difficult to do given that there is substantial dialectical variation between the islands. This can be seen from migrants who left Cape Verde often identifying more with their island of origin than the archipelago as a whole. Language, food and music are the most important cultural markers of CV identity. The Cape Verdean Creole Institute was founded in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1996, to teach the Cape Verdean language. In addition, many schools in the Boston Public School district offer Cape Verdean Creole (CVC) as a language class. Currently 2.3% of the population of Boston speaks CVC. Formal CVC language research in both Cape Verde and America has been ongoing since the late 1800s. The elite class of the island was mostly responsible for recording the earlier studies of the language in an attempt to make CVC more acceptable as an artistic language. When the first printing press came to Cape Verde in 1842, the elites began publishing written work in CVC for the first time. Additionally, the Seminary of S√£o Nicolau was created in 1866, which allowed for the elite mixed race and the black elite to have access to education and begin a scholarly debate about CVC. These developments, along with other improvements in technology, allowed the study of CVC to flourish in Cape Verde. In general, there are two different schools of thought on CVC research. One school of thought is Creole Exceptionalism, which regards creole languages as a socially inferior dialect or degenerate language. Another school of thought however is referred to as Crioulidade, which celebrates Cape Verde's unique heritage, consequently referring to the language not in terms of its African or Portuguese heritage, but rather as its own unique hybrid of the two that has its own history and cultural significance. Proponents of this school of thought argue that the processes of miscegenation and creolization were positive, rather than negative as the Exceptionalism school of thought suggests. Religion Due to a history of Portuguese colonization, the vast majority of Cape Verdeans and Cape Verdean Americans are Roman Catholic. Early Cape Verdean migrants to the United States originally joined Portuguese parishes that had sprung up throughout Southeastern Massachusetts. Cape Verdeans also began to establish their own masses in Criolu at many Massachusetts Catholic Churches. One such church is the St. Patrick's Church of Roxbury which has held a mass in Criolu for years. However, many Cape Verdean Catholics encountered racial prejudice amongst Portuguese parishioners and looked for religious alternatives. In New Bedford, the Cape Verdean community established the Our Lady of Assumption, the first Cape Verdean American church, in 1905 in response to such prejudice. Furthermore, in spite of colonial ties to Catholicism and the Portuguese, many Cape Verdeansin turned towards Protestantism in response to discrimination and a lack of support from the Archdiocese. In response to racism from the Portuguese community in Providence, the Cape Verdean community founded the Shelmer Street Church in 1905.Some Kind of Funny Porto Rican. Dir. Claire Andrade-Watkins. SPIA Media Productions, 2006. Web. Cape Verdeans in New Bedford at the turn of the 20th century were rejected by Portuguese parishioners at St. John's and turned towards Nazarene sects.Williams, Dwayne E. \\"Rethinking the African Diaspora: A Comparative Look at Race and Identity in a Transatlantic Community, 1878 - 1921.\\" Ed.

By Karen Isaksen Leonard. Walnut Creek, CA: AltaMira, 2005. N. pag. Print. In addition to Daddy Grace, who later founded a national religious movement, the United House of Prayer for All People, around his cult of personality, the Cape Verdean Protestant community has produced another religious leader of national acclaim, Reverend Peter J. Gomes. Today, a greater proportion of newly arrived Cape Verdean immigrants to the United States identify as Protestant due to an increased presence of evangelical missionaries in Cape Verde following its independence.Halter, Marilyn. \\"Cape Verdeans in the U.S.\\" Transnational Archipelago: Perspectives on Cape Verdean Migration and Diaspora. By Lu√≠s Batalha and J√∏rgen Carling. Amsterdam: Amsterdam UP, 2008. N. pag. Print. While Christianity is the dominant ideology of Cape Verdeans in Cape Verde and the diaspora, there has been an interest in the Jewish ancestry of Cape Verdeans amongst Cape Verdean Americans. The Cape Verdean Jewish Heritage movement is mainly led by the diaspora and its interest is predominantly in preserving history, not practicing doctrine. Accordingly, one of the major goals of the movement is preservation of Jewish cemeteries in Cape Verde.Werlin, Louise. \\"Jews in Cape Verde.\\" UMASS Dartmouth, n.d. Web. 1 Mar. 2015. A manifestation of this interest is the annual Cape Verdean - Jewish Passover Seder held in Roxbury, Massachusetts since 2005 The Seder brings together Cape Verdean and Jewish Americans in a celebration of both cultures. The traditional Seder is adapted with a bilingual Haggadah that includes Criolu prayers and elements of Cape Verdean history, such as the addition of Amilcar's Cup. Music Cape Verdean music has evolved to be composed of diverse styles and genres that reflect its mixture of racial identities, such as: African, Portuguese, Caribbean and Brazilian influences. Older styles include morna and coladeira. These styles, though distinct, carry a commonality of somber, slow, and soulful tone that often reflects themes of love, longing, and nostalgia. Re-emerging forms of Caper Verdean Music are funan√° and batuque. These quick tempo, percussion filled styles are high energy songs that are typically accompanied by hip-moving dance. These styles were banned previously due to overly sexual allegations but are now re- emerging in the past decade. Hip hop, Reggae and Zouk are styles of Cape Verdean music that are now being explored. These fusions with contemporary styles of music are often reflective in lyrics with ongoing themes of Cape Verdean life.

In an artists' statement they said that \\"even if only one of us creates some of the projects and works, we usually sign them together. We are not just an artist, we are a movement.\\" Both artists were born in Moscow, but emigrated to Israel in 1977 and subsequently to New York in 1978. The pair's co-authorship of works ceased in 2003‚Äì2004.komarandmelamid.org  Education  Komar and Melamid attended the Moscow Art School from 1958 to 1960, followed by the Stroganov Institute of Art and Design (Illustration dept.), graduating in 1967. They began working together shortly thereafter. After 36 years they separated in 2003.  History  Komar & Melamid's first joint exhibition, Retrospectivism, was held at the Blue Bird Cafe in Moscow, 1967. The following year, they joined the youth section of the Moscow Union of Artists and began teaching art. In 1972, Komar & Melamid founded a movement they called Sots Art, a unique version of Soviet Pop and Conceptual Art that combines the principles of Dadaism and Socialist Realism.\\" In 1974, they were arrested during a performance (in a Moscow apartment) of Art Belongs to the People. Later that year, their Double Self-Portrait (similar to dual portraits of Lenin and Stalin) was destroyed by the Soviet government, along with works by other nonconformist artists, at what became known as the Bulldozer Exhibition (because bulldozers were used to destroy the artwork, which had been displayed in an open-air setting). In 1976, Komar & Melamid's work became more widely known. Ronald Feldman Fine Arts, New York, hosted their first international exhibition, but Soviet authorities denied them permission to attend. In 1976, they also made their first attempt at emigrating, but permission was denied. In response, they created their own country, \\"Trans-State,\\" complete with passports and a constitution. In 1977, they received permission to join relatives in Israel. In 1978, they moved to New York; in the same month, their first museum exhibition opened at the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford, Connecticut. Throughout the 1970s, Komar & Melamid also worked in a style they called \\"Post-Art,\\" pioneering the use of multi-stylistic images, prefiguring the eclectic combination of styles in post-modernism, which became popular in the 1980s. They collaborated on various conceptual projects, ranging from painting and performance to installation, public sculpture, photography, music, and poetry. In one such performance, they established a corporation, Komar & Melamid, Inc., that had as its purpose \\"the buying and selling of human souls.\\" They bought several hundred souls, including Andy Warhol's (who sold it to them for free), which was smuggled into Russia and then sold for 30 rubles. Melamid moved to New Jersey in 1980. He continued to work with Komar in New York. In 1981, their Portrait of Hitler was slashed by an ex-Trotskyist disc jockey in Brooklyn. They did not repair the work, considering the attacker a co-author. Ronald Feldman hosted the exhibition Sots Art in 1982, which was a commercial and critical success. In 1983, the Museum of Modern Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art purchased paintings. From 1981 to 1983, they continued to develop Sots Art in the series Nostalgic Socialist Realism, and from 1984 to 1990 they further developed Post-Art in the Diary Series, Anarchistic Synthesis Series, and Bayonne, N.J. Series. The Stalin Monument (The Hague) (2006) Throughout the 1980s, many prominent writers and critics discussed their work, and they were invited to participate in numerous exhibitions. They were the first Russian artists to receive funding from the National Endowment for the Arts. They were also the first Russian artists to be invited to Documenta (Kassel, then in West Germany, 1987). Komar & Melamid created their first public art sculpture in 1986, a bronze bust of Joseph Stalin, which was installed in the red light district of The Hague, Netherlands. In 1988, they became US citizens. In 1989, a monograph about them, written by Carter Ratcliff, was published by Abbeville Press. In the early 1990s, Komar & Melamid created two icons for the Holy Rosary Church in Jersey City. In 1992, they began the series Monumental Propaganda, in response to the destruction of Socialist Realist monuments in Russia. At Komar & Melamid's invitation, more than 200 Russian and Western artists created projects for the preservation of monuments. Prolific press coverage of the project forestalled destruction of monuments in Russia. From 1994 to 1997, the artists worked on the series People's Choice, whereby they created the \\"most wanted\\" and \\"least wanted\\" paintings of various countries based on the results of surveys conducted by professional polling companies. The book, Painting by Numbers: Komar & Melamid's Scientific Guide to Art, published in 1997, explains the statistical underpinnings of the polling process and provides the results of each country's preferences. Komar & Melamid used the same process in 1996‚Äì1997 in a collaboration with composer Dave Soldier to create The People's Choice Music, consisting of \\"The Most Wanted Song\\" (a love song with low male and female vocals, of moderate duration, pitch, and tempo) and \\"The Most Unwanted Song\\" (in part: an operatic soprano raps over cowboy music featuring least-wanted instruments bagpipes and tuba while children sing about holidays and advertise for Wal-Mart). In 1998, Naked Revolution, an opera about George Washington, Vladimir Lenin and Marcel Duchamp, was created by Komar & Melamid with Dave Soldier and performed at the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, and the Kitchen, New York. It became part of the exhibition American Dreams, along with a series of eight paintings, forty collages, and the artists' collection of George Washington memorabilia. In 1998, the artists also went to Thailand to teach elephants to paint, resulting in the book, When Elephants Paint: The Quest of Two Russian Artists to Save the Elephants of Thailand. In 2000, Christie's auction house held the first-ever auction of elephant paintings. The revenue generated supported the elephants and their keepers. In 2001, Komar & Melamid began work on their last major project together, Symbols of the Big Bang, first exhibited at the Yeshiva University Museum, Center for Jewish History, New York. Using abstract symbols, the artists explored their spirituality and the connection between mysticism and science. In 2003, they began to turn some of the symbols into stained glass, which Russian authorities refused to exhibit during the Moscow portion of the exhibition, Berlin-Moscow/Moscow-Berlin (2004). Komar & Melamid ceased collaborating in 2003.http://komarandmelamid.org/chronology.html  Style  They are perhaps best known as the founders of SotsArt (–°–æ—Ü–ê—Ä—Ç), a form of Soviet Nonconformist Art that combined elements of Socialist Realism and Western Pop Art in a conceptual framework that also references Dadaism. Komar and Melamid often create many works within a common theme. Their prolific collaboration precludes from mentioning all of their projects, however, some of their best known series and projects are: Sots Art series (1972‚Äì1973), Post-Art series (1973), Ancestral Portraits series (1980), Nostalgic Socialist Realism series (1982‚Äì1983), Diary series (1984‚Äì1986), Anarchistic Synthesism series (1985‚Äì1986), Most-Wanted series (1993‚Äì1997), Monumental Propaganda (1994), Elephant Project (1995‚Äì2000), American Dreams (1994‚Äì1999).  People's Choice  Komar and Melamid's People's Choice series, 1994‚Äì1997, consisted of the \\"most wanted\\" and \\"most unwanted\\" paintings of 11 countries, as well as two songs in the same vein. The artists commissioned polling companies in the 11 countries‚Äîincluding the United States, Russia, China, France, and Kenya‚Äîto conduct scientific polls to discover what they want to see in art. The use of polls was meant to mimic the American democratic process. Komar said, \\"Our interpretation of polls is our collaboration with various people of the world. It is a collaboration with [sic] new dictator‚ÄîMajority.\\" The process was also meant to change the artists role as a leader. Komar and Melamid believe that the broad public is an adequate judge of art, contrary to the historical precedence, much in the same way that the broad public in America is entrusted with electing the President. It is a new type of leader, one that asks questions, instead of a dictator. Melamid said, \\"Picasso mimicked Stalin, so we try to mimic Clinton.\\"Wypijewski, JoAnn, ed. Painting by Numbers: Komar and Melamid's Scientific Guide to Art, New York: Farrar Straus Giroux, 1997. Komar has said he isn't so concerned that people actually enjoy the work, so long as it provokes thoughts of free will versus predetermination. To tie that concept into their earlier work, Komar said, \\"In our early work, we arrived at [the] definition of freedom that entailed being free from individual cliches, being free to change intonations and styles. Individuality lost its stability and its uniqueness. Now we are searching for a new freedom. We have been traveling to different countries, engaging in dull negotiations with representatives of polling companies, raising money for further polls, receiving more of less [the] same results, and painting more or less [the] same blue landscapes. Looking for freedom, we found slavery.\\"Wypijewski, JoAnn, ed. Painting by Numbers: Komar and Melamid's Scientific Guide to Art, New York: Farrar Straus Giroux, 1997.

Organotin compounds or stannanes are chemical compounds based on tin with hydrocarbon substituents. Organotin chemistry is part of the wider field of organometallic chemistry. The first organotin compound was diethyltin diiodide ((C2H5)2SnI2), discovered by Edward Frankland in 1849. The area grew rapidly in the 1900s, especially after the discovery of the Grignard reagents, which are useful for producing Sn-C bonds. The area remains rich with many applications in industry and continuing activity in the research laboratory. Structure of organotin compounds Organotin compounds are generally classified according to their oxidation states. Tin(IV) compounds are much more common and more useful. Organic derivatives of tin(IV) The tetraorgano derivatives are invariably tetrahedral. Compounds of the type SnRR'RR' have been resolved into individual enantiomers. =Organotin halides= Organotin chlorides have the formula R4‚àínSnCln for values of n up to 3. Bromides, iodides, and fluorides are also known but less important. These compounds are known for many R groups. They are always tetrahedral. The tri- and dihalides form adducts with good Lewis bases such as pyridine. The fluorides tend to associate such that dimethyltin difluoride forms sheet-like polymers. Di- and especially triorganotin halides, e.g. tributyltin chloride, exhibit toxicities approaching that of hydrogen cyanide. =Organotin hydrides= Organotin hydrides have the formula R4‚àínSnHn for values of n up to 4. The parent member of this series, stannane (SnH4), is an unstable colourless gas. Stability is correlated with the number of organic substituents. Tributyltin hydride is used as a source of hydride radical in some organic reactions. =Organotin oxides and hydroxides= Organotin oxides and hydroxides are common products from the hydrolysis of organotin halides. Unlike the corresponding derivatives of silicon and germanium, tin oxides and hydroxides often adopt structures with penta- and even hexacoordinated tin centres, especially for the diorgano- and monoorgano derivatives. The group Sn-O-Sn is called a stannoxane. Structurally simplest of the oxides and hydroxides are the triorganotin derivatives. A commercially important triorganotin hydroxides is the acaricide Cyhexatin (also called Plictran), (C6H11)3SnOH. Such triorganotin hydroxides exist in equilibrium with the distannoxanes: : 2 R3SnOH R3SnOSnR3 \\\\+ H2O With only two organic substituents on each Sn centre, the diorganotin oxides and hydroxides are structurally more complex than the triorgano derivatives. The simple geminal diols (R2Sn(OH)2) and monomeric stannanones (R2Sn=O) are unknown. Diorganotin oxides (R2SnO) are polymers except when the organic substituents are very bulky, in which case cyclic trimers or, in the case of R = CH(SiMe3)2 dimers, with Sn3O3 and Sn2O2 rings. The distannoxanes exist as dimers of dimers with the formula [R2SnX]2O2 wherein the X groups (e.g., chloride, hydroxide, carboxylate) can be terminal or bridging (see Table). The hydrolysis of the monoorganotin trihalides has the potential to generate stannanoic acids, RSnO2H. As for the diorganotin oxides/hydroxides, the monoorganotin species form structurally complex because of the occurrence of dehydration/hydration, aggregation. Illustrative is the hydrolysis of butyltin trichloride to give [(BuSn)12O14(OH)6]2+. File:R2SnO-cyclic- trimer-2D.pngIdealized structure of trimeric diorganotin oxide. File:TBu2SnO- cyclic-trimer-from-xtal-1984-Mercury-3D-balls.pngBall-and-stick model for (t-Bu2SnO)3. File:R2SnO-cross-linked-network-Harris-and- Sebald-1987-2D.pngStructure of diorganotin oxide, highlighting the extensive intermolecular bonding. =Hypercoordinated stannanes= Unlike carbon(IV) analogues but somewhat like silicon compounds, tin(IV) can also be coordinated to five and even six atoms instead of the regular four. These hypercoordinated compounds usually have electronegative substituents. Numerous examples of hypervalency are provided by the organotin oxides and associated carboxylates and related pseudohalide derivatives. The organotin halides for adducts, e.g. Me2SnCl2(bipyridine). The all-organic penta- and hexaorganostannates have even been characterized, while in the subsequent year a six-coordinated tetraorganotin compound was reported. A crystal structure of room-temperature stable (in argon) all-carbon pentaorganostannane was reported as the lithium salt with this structure: :Pentaorganostannane In this distorted trigonal bipyramidal structure the carbon to tin bond lengths (2.26 √Ö apical, 2.17 √Ö equatorial) are larger than regular C-Sn bonds (2.14 √Ö) reflecting its hypervalent nature. =Triorganotin cations= Some reactions of triorganotin halides implicate a role for R3Sn+ intermediates. Such cations are analogous to carbocations. They have been characterized crystallographically when the organic substituents are large, such as 2,4,6-triisopropylphenyl. Tin radicals (organic derivatives of tin(III)) Tin radicals, with the formula R3Sn, are called stannyl radicals.Davies, Alwyn George. (2004) Organotin Chemistry, 2nd Edition Weinheim: Wiley-VCH. They are invoked as intermediates in certain atom-transfer reactions. For example, tributyltin hydride (tri-n-butylstannane) serves as a useful source of \\"hydrogen atoms\\" because of the stability of the tributytin radical.T. V. RajanBabu, P. C. B. Page B. R. Buckley \\"Tri-n-butylstannane\\" in e-EROS Encyclopedia of Reagents for Organic Synthesis, 2004. Organic derivatives of tin(II) Organotin(II) compounds are somewhat rare. Compounds with the empirical formula SnR2 are somewhat fragile and exist as rings or polymers when R is not bulky. The polymers, called polystannanes, have the formula (SnR2)n. :100px In principle divalent tin compounds might be expected to form analogues of alkenes with a formal double bond. Indeed, compounds with the formula Sn2R4, called distannenes, are known for certain organic substituents. The Sn centres tend to be highly pyramidal. Monomeric compounds with the formula SnR2, analogues of carbenes are also known in a few cases. One example is Sn(SiR3)2, where R is the very bulky CH(SiMe3)2 (Me = methyl). Such species reversibly dimerize to the distannylene upon crystallization: :2 R2Sn (R2Sn)2 Stannenes, compounds with tin‚Äìcarbon double bonds, are exemplified by derivatives of stannabenzene. Stannoles, structural analogs of cyclopentadiene, exhibit little C-Sn double bond character. Organic derivatives of tin(I) Compounds of Sn(I) are rare and only observed with very bulky ligands. One prominent family of cages is accessed by pyrolysis of the 2,6-diethylphenyl-substituted tristannylene [Sn(C6H3-2,6-Et2)2]3, which affords the cubane-type cluster and a prismane. These cages contain Sn(I) and have the formula [Sn(C6H3-2,6-Et2)]n where n = 8, 10. A stannyne contains a carbon to tin triple bond and a distannyne a triple bond between two tin atoms (RSnSnR). Distannynes only exist for extremely bulky substituents. Unlike alkynes, the C-Sn-Sn-C core of these distannynes are nonlinear, although they are planar. The Sn-Sn distance is 3.066(1) √Ö, and the Sn-Sn-C angles are 99.25(14)¬∞. Such compounds are prepared by reduction of bulky aryltin(II) halides. Structure of an Ar10Sn10 \\"prismane\\", a compound containing Sn(I) (Ar = 2,6-diethylphenyl).  Preparation of organotin compounds  Organotin compounds can be synthesised by numerous methods. Classic is the reaction of a Grignard reagent with tin halides for example tin tetrachloride. An example is provided by the synthesis of tetraethyltin: :4 EtMgBr + SnCl4 ‚Üí Et4Sn + 4 MgClBr The symmetrical tetraorganotin compounds, especially tetraalkyl derivatives, can then be converted to various mixed chlorides by redistribution reactions (also known as the \\"Kocheshkov comproportionation\\" in the case of organotin compounds): :3 R4Sn + SnCl4 ‚Üí 4 R3SnCl :R4Sn + SnCl4 ‚Üí 2 R2SnCl2 :R4Sn + 3 SnCl4 ‚Üí 4 RSnCl3 A related method involves redistribution of tin halides with organoaluminium compounds. The mixed organo-halo tin compounds can be converted to the mixed organic derivatives, as illustrated by the synthesis of dibutyldivinyltin: :Bu2SnCl2 \\\\+ 2 C2H3MgBr ‚Üí Bu2Sn(C2H3)2 \\\\+ 2 MgBrCl The organotin hydrides are generated by reduction of the mixed alkyl chlorides. For example, treatment of dibutyltin dichloride with lithium aluminium hydride gives the dibutyltin dihydride, a colourless distillable oil:\\"Organometallic Syntheses: Nontransition-Metal Compounds\\" John Eisch, Ed. Academic Press: New York, 1981. . :{Bu2SnCl2} + 1/2LiAlH4 -> {Bu2SnH2} + 1/2LiAlCl4 The Wurtz-like coupling of alkyl sodium compounds with tin halides yields tetraorganotin compounds. Hydrostannylation involves the metal- catalyzed addition of tin hydrides across unsaturated substrates.  Reactions of organotin compounds  Important reactions, discussed above, usually focus on organotin halides and pseudohalides with nucleophiles. In the area of organic synthesis, the Stille reaction is considered important. It entails coupling reaction with sp2-hybridized organic halides catalyzed by palladium: :{R-X} + R'-SnR3 ->[\\\\ce{Pd\\\\ catalyst}] {R-R'} + XSnR3 and organostannane additions (nucleophilic addition of an allyl-, allenyl-, or propargylstannanes to an aldehydes and imines). Organotin compounds are also used extensively in radical chemistry (e.g. radical cyclizations, Barton‚ÄìMcCombie deoxygenation, Barton decarboxylation, etc.). Applications An organotin compound is commercially applied as stabilizers in polyvinyl chloride. In this capacity, they suppress degradation by removing allylic chloride groups and by absorbing hydrogen chloride. This application consumes about 20,000 tons of tin each year. The main class of organotin compounds are diorganotin dithiolates with the formula R2Sn(SR')2. The Sn-S bond is the reactive component. Diorganotin carboxylates, e.g., dibutyltin dilaurate, are used as catalysts for the formation of polyurethanes, for vulcanization of silicones, and transesterification. n-Butyltin trichloride is used in the production of tin dioxide layers on glass bottles by chemical vapor deposition. Biological applications \\"Tributyltins\\" are used as industrial biocides, e.g. as antifungal agents in textiles and paper, wood pulp and paper mill systems, breweries, and industrial cooling systems. Triphenyltin derivatives are used as active components of antifungal paints and agricultural fungicides. Other triorganotins are used as miticides and acaricides. Tributyltin oxide has been extensively used as a wood preservative. Tributyltin compounds were once widely used as marine anti-biofouling agents to improve the efficiency of ocean-going ships. Concerns over toxicity of these compounds (some reports describe biological effects to marine life at a concentration of 1 nanogram per liter) led to a worldwide ban by the International Maritime Organization. Organotin complexes have been studied in anticancer therapy.

Vol. 4, p.881 (1963); Vol. 36, p.86 (1956). Link  Toxicity  The toxicities of tributyltin and triphenyltin derivatives compounds are comparable to that of hydrogen cyanide. Furthermore, tri-n-alkyltins are phytotoxic and therefore cannot be used in agriculture. Depending on the organic groups, they can be powerful bactericides and fungicides. Reflecting their high bioactivity, \\"tributyltins\\" were once used in marine anti-fouling paint. In contrast to the triorganotin compounds, monoorgano, diorgano- and tetraorganotin compounds are far less dangerous. DBT may however be immunotoxic.

It is also the name for calcium oxide which occurs as a product of coal-seam fires and in altered limestone xenoliths in volcanic ejecta. The word lime originates with its earliest use as building mortar and has the sense of sticking or adhering. These materials are still used in large quantities as building and engineering materials (including limestone products, cement, concrete, and mortar), as chemical feedstocks, and for sugar refining, among other uses. Lime industries and the use of many of the resulting products date from prehistoric times in both the Old World and the New World. Lime is used extensively for wastewater treatment with ferrous sulfate. The rocks and minerals from which these materials are derived, typically limestone or chalk, are composed primarily of calcium carbonate. They may be cut, crushed, or pulverized and chemically altered. Burning (calcination) of these minerals in a lime kiln converts them into the highly caustic material burnt lime, unslaked lime or quicklime (calcium oxide) and, through subsequent addition of water, into the less caustic (but still strongly alkaline) slaked lime or hydrated lime (calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH)2), the process of which is called slaking of lime. When the term is encountered in an agricultural context, it usually refers to agricultural lime, which today is usually crushed limestone, not a product of a lime kiln. Otherwise it most commonly means slaked lime, as the more dangerous form is usually described more specifically as quicklime or burnt lime. Production In the lime industry, limestone is a general term for rocks that contain 80% or more of calcium or magnesium carbonate, including marble, chalk, oolite, and marl. Further classification is done by composition as high calcium, argillaceous (clayey), silicious, conglomerate, magnesian, dolomite, and other limestones.Lazell, Ellis Warren. Hydrated lime; history, manufacture and uses in plaster, mortar, concrete; a manual for the architect, engineer, contractor and builders. Pittsburgh: Jackson-Remlinger Printing Co., 1915. 21. Print. Uncommon sources of lime include coral, sea shells, calcite and ankerite. Limestone is extracted from quarries or mines. Part of the extracted stone, selected according to its chemical composition and optical granulometry, is calcinated at about in different types of lime kilns to produce quicklime according to the reaction: :\\\\overset{calcium~carbonate}{CaCO3} ->[][\\\\text{heat}] \\\\overset{calcium~oxide}{CaO} + \\\\overset{carbon~dioxide}{CO2}. Before use, quicklime is hydrated, that is combined with water, called slaking, so hydrated lime is also known as slaked lime, and is produced according to the reaction: :{CaO} + \\\\overset{water}{H2O} -> \\\\overset{calcium~hydroxide}{Ca(OH)2}. Dry slaking is slaking quicklime with just enough water to hydrate the quicklime, but to keep it as a powder; it is referred to as hydrated lime. In wet slaking, a slight excess of water is added to hydrate the quicklime to a form referred to as lime putty. Because lime has an adhesive property with bricks and stones, it is often used as binding material in masonry works. It is also used in whitewashing as wall coat to adhere the whitewash onto the wall. Cycle The lime cycle for high- calcium lime The process by which limestone (calcium carbonate) is converted to quicklime by heating, then to slaked lime by hydration, and naturally reverts to calcium carbonate by carbonation is called the lime cycle. The conditions and compounds present during each step of the lime cycle have a strong influence of the end product,Krzysztof Kud≈Çacz, \\"Phase Transitions Within the Lime Cycle: Implications in Heritage Conservation\\" Thesis. April, 2013. University of Granada. thus the complex and varied physical nature of lime products. An example is when slaked lime (calcium hydroxide) is mixed into a thick slurry with sand and water to form mortar for building purposes. When the masonry has been laid, the slaked lime in the mortar slowly begins to react with carbon dioxide to form calcium carbonate (limestone) according to the reaction: :Ca(OH)2 \\\\+ CO2 ‚Üí CaCO3 \\\\+ H2O. The carbon dioxide that takes part in this reaction is principally available in the air or dissolved in rainwaterBritish Lime Association so pure lime mortar will not recarbonate under water or inside a thick masonry wall. The lime cycle for dolomitic and magnesium lime is not well understood but more complex because the magnesium compounds also slake to periclase which slake more slowly than calcium oxide and when hydrated produce several other compounds thus these limes contain inclusions of portlandite, brucite, magnesite, and other magnesium hydroxycarbonate compounds. These magnesium compounds have very limited, contradictory research which questions whether they \\"...may be significantly reactive with acid rain, which could lead to the formation of magnesium sulfate salts.\\"Heather Hartshorn, \\"Dolomitic Lime Mortars: Carbonation Complications and Susceptibility to Acidic Sulfates\\" Thesis. May 2012. Columbia University Magnesium sulfate salts may damage the mortar when they dry and recrystalize due to expansion of the crystals as they form which is known as sulfate attack. Building materials Lime used in building materials is broadly classified as \\"pure\\", \\"hydraulic\\", and \\"poor\\" lime;Rajput, R. K.. Engineering Material: (Including Construction Materials). 3rd ed. New Delhi: S. Chand & Co. Ltd. 2006. 74. Print can be natural or artificial; and may be further identified by its magnesium content such as dolomitic or magnesium lime. Uses include lime mortar, lime plaster, lime render, lime-ash floors, tabby concrete, whitewash, silicate mineral paint, and limestone blocks which may be of many types. The qualities of the many types of processed lime affect how they are used. The Romans used two types of lime mortar to make Roman concrete, which allowed them to revolutionize architecture, sometimes called the Concrete revolution. Lime has many complex qualities as a building product including workability which includes cohesion, adhesion, air content, water content, crystal shape, board-life, spreadability, and flowability; bond strength; comprehensive strength; setting time; sand-carrying capacity; hydrolocity; free lime content; vapor permeability; flexibility; and resistance to sulfates. These qualities are affected by many factors during each step of manufacturing and installation, including the original ingredients of the source of lime; added ingredients before and during firing including inclusion of compounds from the fuel exhaust; firing temperature and duration; method of slaking including a hot mix (quicklime added to sand and water to make mortar), dry slaking and wet slaking; ratio of the mixture with aggregates and water; the sizes and types of aggregate; contaminants in the mixing water; workmanship; and rate of drying during curing. Pure lime is also known as rich, common, air, slaked, slack, pickling, hydrated, and high calcium lime. It consists primarily of calcium hydroxide which is derived by slaking quicklime (calcium oxide), and may contain up to 5% of other ingredients. Pure lime sets very slowly through contact with carbon dioxide in the air and moisture; it is not a hydraulic lime so it will not set under water. Pure lime is pure white and can be used for whitewash, plaster, and mortar. Pure lime is soluble in water containing carbonic acid, a natural, weak acid which is a solution of carbon dioxide in water and acid rain so it will slowly wash away, but this characteristic also produces autogenous or self-healing process where the dissolved lime can flow into cracks in the material and be redeposited, automatically repairing the crack. Semi-hydraulic lime, also called partially hydraulic and grey lime, sets initially with water and then continues to set with air. This lime is similar to hydraulic lime but has less soluble silica (usually minimum 6%) and aluminates, and will set under water but will never harden.Heath, A. H.. A manual on lime and cement, their treatment and use in construction.. London: E. & F.N. Spon;, 1893. 6. Print. Hydraulic lime is also called water lime. Hydraulic lime contains lime with silica or alumina and sets with exposure to water and can set under water. Natural hydraulic lime (NHL) is made from a limestone which naturally contains some clay. Artificial hydraulic lime is made by adding forms of silica or alumina such as clay to the limestone during firing, or by adding a pozzolana to pure lime. Hydraulic limes are classified by their strength: feebly, moderately and eminently hydraulic lime. Feebly hydraulic lime contains 5-10% clay, slakes in minutes, and sets in about three weeks. It is used for less expensive work and in mild climates. Moderately hydraulic lime contains 11-20% clay, slakes in one to two hours, and sets in approximately one week. It is used for better quality work and exterior walls in freezing climates. Eminently hydraulic lime contains 21-30% clay, slakes very slowly, and sets in approximately a day. It is used in harsh environments such as damp locations and near saltwater. Hydraulic lime is off-white in color. \\"The degree of hydraulicity of mortars will affect many characteristics. By selecting an appropriate ratio of clay to limestone mortars that carbonate or set hydraulically to a varying extents can be designed for particular application requirements such as setting time, strength, colour, durability, frost resistance, workability, speed of set in the presence of water, vapour permeability etc.\\" Poor lime is also known as lean or meager lime. Poor lime sets and cures very slowly and has weak bonding. Poor lime is grey in color. Magnesium lime contains more than 5% magnesium oxide (BS 6100) or 5-35% magnesium carbonate (ASTM C 59-91).Hewlett, Peter C.. Lea ºs chemistry of cement and concrete. 4. ed. Amsterdam: Elsevier Butterworth-Heinemann, 2004. 27. Print. Dolomitic lime has a high magnesium content of 35-46% magnesium carbonate (ASTM C 59-91). Dolomitic lime is named for the Dolomite Mountains in the Italian and Austrian Alps.Heather Hartshorn, \\"Dolomitic Lime Mortars: Carbonation Complications and Susceptibility to Acidic Sulfates\\" Thesis 2012 Columbia University In the United States the most commonly used masonry lime is Type S hydrated lime which is intended to be added to Portland cement to improve plasticity, water retention and other qualities. The S in type S stands for special which distinguishes it from Type N hydrated lime where the N stands for normal. The special attributes of Type S are its \\"...ability to develop high, early plasticity and higher water retentivity and by a limitation on its unhydrated oxide content.\\"ASTM C 207 quoted in Margaret L. Thomson, \\"Why is Type S Hydrated Lime Special?\\". International Building Lime Symposium 2005. Orlando, Florida, March 9 -11, 2005 The term Type S originated in 1946 in ASTM C 207 Hydrated Lime for Masonry Purposes. Type S lime is almost always dolomitic lime, hydrated under heat and pressure in an autoclave, and used in mortar, render, stucco, and plaster. Type S lime is not considered reliable as a pure binder in mortar due to high burning temperatures during production. Kankar lime, a lime made from kankar which is a form of calcium carbonate. Selenitic lime, also known as Scotts' cement after Henry Young Darracott Scott is a cement of grey chalk or similar lime, such as in the Lias Group, with about 5% added gypsum plaster (calcined gypsum). Selenite is a type of gypsum, but selenitic cement may be made using any form of sulfate or sulfuric acid.Smith, Percy Guillemard Llewellin. Notes on building construction: arranged to meet the requirements of the syllabus of the Science & Art Department of the Committee of Council on Education, South Kensington .... 2nd ed. London: Rivingtons, 1879. Print. Sulfate arrests slaking, causes the cement to set quickly and stronger. Roman concrete The Romans made concrete by mixing lime and volcanic ash to create a pozzolanic reaction. If this was mixed with volcanic tuff and placed under seawater, the seawater hydrated the lime in an exothermic reaction that solidified the mixture.

An eccentric and colourful figure, she was also a gifted artist, sculptor and writer, and her antics often created controversy. Biography Meacham, Gunn, Hughes, Wood family picture in 1935 Wendy Wood Middle of second row Wood was born in Kent, England, before her parents moved to South Africa, where her father was a brewery manager and landscape painter, and was brought up in the latter country. Wood adopted her mother's maiden name in 1927 to emphasize her artistic connections. Her mother's father was the sculptor Samuel Peploe Wood, and his brother was the painter Thomas Peploe Wood. If challenged as to her Scottish birthright, she would reply, \\"One does not have to be a horse to be born in a stable\\", echoing the old proverb that is sometimes misattributed to the Duke of Wellington, albeit for a different purpose. In 1928 Wood was one of the founders of the National Party of Scotland, which grew into the Scottish National Party, but, in the 1930s, decided that a non-party approach to Scottish independence was more effective. On Bannockburn Day in 1932, Wood led a group of nationalists into Stirling Castle, then an Army barracks as well as being open to tourists, to tear down the Union Flag and replace it with Scotland's lion rampant. Eric Linklater wrote that she flushed the Union Jack down the toilet, and she sued him for libel, eventually settling out of court for a farthing damages. In the 1930s Wood also founded the Scottish Watch, a youth organisation (not to be confused with a later, unrelated extremist organisation of the same name). In 1949, she had founded the Scottish Patriots, which, at the time of her death in June 1981, were some 2,000 strong. In the 1950s came protests against the use of the regnal title \\"Elizabeth II\\" in Scotland, as Scotland had not had an Elizabeth I (see also the case of MacCormick v. Lord Advocate). Wood hung an effigy of the secretary of state for Scotland in Glasgow in 1950 and displayed a Home Rule banner at that years' Highland Games. Wood was arrested and spent spells in prison on several occasions. From 1956 Wood shared an artist's studio and house with her partner, Florence St John Cadell at Whinmill Brae in Edinburgh. The house is now split in two and addressed as 17 and 18 Coltbridge Gardens. Wood's portrait by Florence St John Cadell is held by the Scottish National Portrait Gallery.Art UK The studio at Whinmill Brae, Edinburgh In 1960, Wood spoke at the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, to try to mobilise them behind the re-convening of the Scottish parliament, which she asserted had not been properly dissolved in 1707, merely adjourned. This request was turned down. Wood engaged in many international campaigns, for Irish causes, to the remembrance of the British concentration camps during the Second Boer War which killed thousands, to supporting the Indian independence movement and supporting the Icelanders in their 1970s cod war over fishing grounds. In 1972 came Wood's hunger strike for home rule, which effectively failed, but in 1979, Scots were given a referendum on the matter. In the early 1970s Wood often read Scottish stories on the BBC children's TV programme Jackanory under the name Auntie Gwen. Having spent over a decade as a crofter in Moidart (moving to Edinburgh in 1952) she had a wide span of experience to call upon. In all she wrote ten books, the last being her autobiography, Yours Sincerely for Scotland. Later in the 1970s she unsuccessfully stood as a candidate in an election to be Rector of the University of Dundee with the support of the University's Scottish Nationalist Association. Wood remained active into her late eighties. She died in Edinburgh on 30 June 1981, aged 88. Family Wood was the aunt of both the physicist J. B. Gunn and the musician Spike Hughes, and granddaughter of Samuel Peploe Wood. She was also the sister-in-law of the Egyptologist Battiscombe Gunn and the musician Herbert Hughes.

It differs from a fallout shelter, in that its main purpose is to protect from shock waves and overpressure instead of from radioactive precipitation, as a fallout shelter does. It is also possible for a shelter to protect from both blasts and fallout. Blast shelters are a vital form of protection from nuclear attack and are employed in civil defense. There are above-ground, below-ground, dedicated, dual-purpose, and potential blast shelters. Dedicated blast shelters are built specifically for the purpose of blast protection (see bunker). Dual-purpose blast shelters are existing structures with blast- protective properties that have been modified to accommodate people seeking protection from blasts. Potential blast shelters are existing structures or geological features exhibiting blast-protective properties that have potential to be used for protection from blasts.  Design  Blast doors in a missile control bunker at Minot Air Force Base, North Dakota. The 25-ton blast door in the Cheyenne Mountain nuclear bunker is the main entrance to another blast door (background) beyond which the side tunnel branches into access tunnels to the main chambers. Blast shelters deflect the blast wave from nearby explosions to prevent ear and internal injuries to people sheltering in the bunker. While frame buildings collapse from as little as 3 psi (20 kPa) of overpressure, blast shelters are regularly constructed to survive several hundred psi. This substantially decreases the likelihood that a bomb can harm the structure. The basic plan is to provide a structure that is very strong in compression. The actual strength specification must be done individually, based on the nature and probability of the threat. A typical specification for heavy civil defence shelter in Europe during the Cold war was an overhead explosion of a 500 kiloton weapon at the height of 500 meters. Such a weapon would be used to attack soft targets (factories, administrative centres, communications) in the area. Only the most heavy bedrock-shelters would stand a chance of surviving. However, in the countryside or in a suburb, the likely distance to the explosion is much larger, as it is improbable that anyone would waste an expensive nuclear device on such targets. The most common purpose-built structure is a steel-reinforced concrete vault or arch buried or located in the basement of a house. Most expedient blast shelters are civil engineering structures that contain large buried tubes or pipes such as sewage or rapid transit tunnels. Even these, nonetheless, require several additions to serve properly: blast doors, air-filtration and ventilation equipment, secondary exits, and air-proofing. Improvised purpose-built blast shelters normally use earthen arches or vaults. To form these, a narrow (1-2 metre- wide) flexible tent of thin wood is placed in a deep trench (usually the apex of the tent is below grade), and then covered with cloth or plastic, and then covered with 1‚Äì2 meters of tamped earth. Shelters of this type are approved field expedient blast shelters of both the U.S. and China. Entrances are constructed from thick wooden frames. Blast valves are to be constructed from tire-treads laid on thick wooden grids. Nuclear bunkers must also cope with the underpressure that lasts for several seconds after the shock wave passes, and prompt radiation. The overburden and structure provide substantial radiation shielding, and the negative pressure is usually only 1/3 of the overpressure. The doors must be at least as strong as the walls. The usual design is a trap-door, to minimize the size and expense. In dual-purpose shelters, which have a secondary peacetime use, the door may be normal. To reduce the weight, the door is normally constructed of steel, with a fitted steel lintel and frame welded to the steel-reinforcement of the concrete. The shelter should be located so that there is no combustible material directly outside it. If the door is on the surface and will be exposed to the blast wave, the edge of the door is normally counter-sunk in the frame so that the blast wave or a reflection cannot lift the edge. If possible, this should be avoided, and the door built so that it is sheltered from the blast wave by other structures. The most useful construction is to build the door behind a 90¬∞-turn in a corridor that has an exit for the overpressure. Door of a light civil defence shelter in Finland A bunker commonly has two doors, one of which is convenient, and in peacetime use, and the other is strong. Naturally, the shelter must always have a secondary exit which can be used if the primary door is blocked by debris. Door shafts may double as ventilation shafts to reduce the digging, although this is inadvisable. A large ground shock can move the walls of a bunker several centimeters in a few milliseconds. Bunkers designed for large ground shocks must have sprung internal buildings, hammocks, or bean-bag chairs to protect inhabitants from the walls and floors. However, most civilian-built improvised shelters do not need these as their structure cannot stand a shock large enough to seriously damage the occupants. Earth is an excellent insulator. In bunkers inhabited for prolonged periods, large amounts of ventilation or air-conditioning must be provided to prevent heat prostration. In bunkers designed for war-time use, manually operated ventilators must be provided because supplies of electricity or gas are unreliable. The simplest form of effective fan to cool a shelter is a wide, heavy frame with flaps that swings in the shelter's doorway and can be swung from hinges on the ceiling. The flaps open in one direction and close in the other, pumping air. (This is a Kearny Air Pump, or KAP, named after the inventor Cresson Kearny.) Kearny asserts, based on field testing, that air filtration is not normally needed in a nuclear shelter. He asserts that fallout is either large enough to fall to the ground, or so fine that it will not settle and thus has little bulk to emit radiation. However, if possible, shelters should have air-filtration to stop chemical, biological and nuclear impurities which may abound after an explosion. Ventilation openings in a bunker must be protected by blast valves. A blast valve is closed by a shock wave, but otherwise remains open. If the bunker is in a built-up area, it may include water-cooling or an immersion tube and breathing tubes to protect inhabitants from fire storms. In these cases, the secondary exit is also most useful. Bunkers must also protect the inhabitants from normal weather, including rain, summer heat and winter cold. A normal form of rainproofing is to place plastic film on the bunker's main structure before burying it. Thick (5-mil or 125 Œºm), inexpensive polyethylene film serves quite well, because the overburden protects it from degradation by wind and sunlight. Naturally, a buried or basement-situated reinforced-concrete shelter usually has the normal appearance of a building. When a house is purpose-built with a blast shelter, the normal location is a reinforced below-grade bathroom with large cabinets. In apartment houses, the shelter may double as storage space, as long as it can be swiftly emptied for its primary use. A shelter can easily be added in a new basement construction by taking an existing corner and adding two poured walls and a ceiling. Some vendors provide true blast shelters engineered to provide good protection to individual families at modest cost. One common design approach uses fiber-reinforced plastic shells. Compressive protection may be provided by inexpensive earth arching. The overburden is designed to shield from radiation. To prevent the shelter from floating to the surface in high groundwater, some designs have a skirt held-down with the overburden. A properly designed, properly installed home shelter does not become a sinkhole in the lawn. In Switzerland, which requires shelters for private apartment blocks and large private houses, the lightest shelters are constructed of stainless steel.  Subways  subway shelter in Singapore During World War II, people in London and Moscow survived German aerial bombing by taking refuge in the underground railway stations, e.g., the London Underground. In the second half of the 20th century, metro stations in eastern Europe and the USSR were constructed to serve as blast shelters. Stations of the Pyongyang Metro in North Korea, constructed below ground in the 1960s and 1970s, are designed as nuclear blast shelters and each station entrance has thick steel blast doors.

Denmark rose as a great military and mercantile power in the 12th century. It had an interest in ending the frequent Estonian attacks that threatened its Baltic trade. Danish fleets attacked Estonia in 1170, 1194, and 1197. In 1206, King Valdemar II and archbishop Andreas Sunonis led a raid on √ñsel island (Saaremaa). The Kings of Denmark claimed Estonia, and this was recognised by the pope. In 1219 the Danish fleet landed in the major harbor of Estonia and defeated the Estonians in the Battle of Lindanise that brought Northern Estonia under Danish rule until the Estonian uprising in 1343, when the territories were taken over by the Teutonic Order. They were sold by Denmark in 1346. Danish conquest St. Olaf's Church is a visible reminder of the Danish era in Tallinn The Walls of Tallinn were started by Queen Margrethe Dannebrog falling from the sky during the Battle of Lindanise During the Livonian crusade in 1218, Pope Honorius III gave Valdemar II a free hand to annex as much land as he could conquer in Estonia. Besides, Albert of Riga, the leader of the Teutonic crusaders fighting the Estonians from the south, visited the king and asked him to attack the Estonians from the North.Christiansen, pp.111 In 1219, Valdemar gathered his fleet, joined forces with the Rugian navy led by prince Wizlav of R√ºgen, and landed on the northern coast of Estonia in the Lindanise (now Tallinn) harbor in the Estonian province of Revala. According to the legend, the national flag of Denmark Dannebrog was born at this time, falling from the sky during a critical moment in the fight and helping the Danes to win the Battle of Lindanise against the Estonians. The date of the battle, June 15, is still celebrated as Valdemarsdag (the national \\"flag day\\") in present-day Denmark. The order of Livonian Brothers of the Sword had conquered Southern Estonia whilst Denmark had taken the North, and the two agreed to divide Estonia but quarreled over the exact borders. In 1220 the King of Denmark gave up his claim on the southern Estonian provinces of Sakala and Ugaunia, which had already been conquered by Brothers of the Sword. Bishop Albert ceded to Denmark the Estonian provinces of Harria, Vironia and Jerwia. In 1227 the Livonian Brothers of the Sword conquered all Danish territories in Northern Estonia. After their defeat in the Battle of Saule, the surviving members of the order merged into the Teutonic Order of Prussia in 1237. On June 7, 1238, the Teutonic Order concluded the Treaty of Stensby at a royal fortress in the south of Zealand with the Danish king, Valdemar II. Under the treaty, Jerwia stayed part of the Ordenstaat, while Harria and Vironia were ceded back to King of Denmark as his direct dominion, the Duchy of Estonia. The first Duke of Estonia had been appointed by Valdemar II in 1220, and the title was now resumed by the kings of Denmark starting in 1269.Skyum-Nielsen pp. 112-113 Due to its status as the king's personal possession, the Duchy of Estonia was included in a nationwide Danish taxation list Liber Census Dani√¶ () (1220‚Äì41), an important geographic and historic document. The list contains about 500 Estonian place names and the names of 114 local vassals. The capital of Danish Estonia was Reval (Tallinn), founded at the place of Lindanise after the invasion of 1219. The Danes built the fortress of Castrum Danorum at Toompea Hill.The chronicle of Henry of Livonia. Estonians still call their capital \\"Tallinn\\", which, according to an urban legend, derives from Taani linna (Danish town or castle). Reval was granted L√ºbeck city rights (1248) and joined the Hanseatic League. Even today, Danish influence can be seen in heraldic symbols: the city of Tallinn's coat of arms features the Danish cross, while Estonia's coat of arms depicts a similar three lions to the Danish coat of arms. In 1240 Valdemar II created the Bishopric of Reval but, contrary to canon law, reserved the right to appoint the bishops of Reval to himself and his successors as king of Denmark. The decision to simply nominate the See of Reval was unique in the whole Catholic Church at the time and was disputed by bishops and the Pope. During this period, the election of bishops was never established in Reval, and royal rights over the bishopric and to nominate the bishops were even included in the treaty when the territories were sold to Teutonic Order in 1346.Skyum-Nielsen pp. 113-115 First mentioned in 1240, the duchy was locally governed by a viceroy () appointed by the king and functioning as his plenipotentiary. The viceroy had administrative powers, he collected the taxes, and he commanded the vassals and the troops in case of war. Most of the viceroys were either of Danish or Danish-Estonian nationality.Skyum-Nielsen pp. 120 In Vironia, the main power centers were Wesenberg (Rakvere) and Narva, built on the site of the old Estonian fortresses of Rakovor and Rugodiv.Old East Slavic chronicles. Wesenberg was granted L√ºbeck city rights in 1302 by King Erik Menved. Narva received these rights in 1345. The vassals of the Danish king received fiefs per dominum utile in exchange for military and court services. The vassals' oath to a new king had to be sworn for a \\"year and a day\\". Of the vassals, 80% were Germans from Westphalia, 18% were Danes, and 2% were EstoniansSkyum-Nielsen pp. 118 (Clemens Esto, Otto Kivele, Odwardus Sorsefer√¶, etc.). The chronicler Ditleb Alnpeke (1290) complained that the king of Denmark was accepting Estonians as his vassals. Danish rule was more liberal in this respect than that of the Brothers of the Sword, in whose territories no natives were allowed to become lords of fiefs. In 1248, the vassals and burgers of Reval already had a local legislative body or ritterschaft. The Danish army only visited the province occasionally. In 1240‚Äì42, Denmark went to war against Novgorod and tried to extend its rule to the land of Votians. King Valdemar sent his sons Abel and Canute to support his vassals' campaign, but they did not win any new territory. The Danish king Erik Plogpennig visited Estonia in 1249, and the Danish fleet sailed to Reval in 1268 and 1270 against Russian and Lithuanian threats. In August 1332, King Christopher II of Denmark died and Denmark fell into political turmoil. The province in Estonia became split between a pro- Danish party led by bishop Olaf of Reval and the pro-German party led by captain Marquard Breide. After the Estonians of Harria rebelled in the St. George's Night Uprising of 1343, the Teutonic Order occupied the territories. The overthrow of the Danish government came two days after the Order had put down the Estonian revolt, and the Danish viceroy was imprisoned in cooperation with the pro-German vassals. The castles in Reval and Wesenberg were handed over to the Order by the pro-German party on May 16, 1343, and the castle at Narva in 1345. In 1346 Estonia (Harria and Vironia) was sold for 19 000 Cologne marks to the Teutonic Order, notwithstanding the promise by Christopher II in 1329 never to abandon or sell Denmark's Estonian territories. The king of Denmark even made a public statement repenting for breaking that promise and asked forgiveness from the Pope. The shift of sovereignty from Denmark to the Teutonic Order took place on November 1, 1346.Skyum-Nielsen pp. 129 The title of \\"Duke of Estonia\\", which had previously been held by the Danish kings, fell into disuse during the Teutonic Order era and was not revived until 1456 by the Danish King Christian I. The title was assumed by the Swedish monarchy after their conquest of Estonia during the Livonian War. The title then transferred to the Russian Tsars after their victory in the Great Northern War and continued to be a subsidiary title of the Russian Tsars until the Romanov Dynasty was overthrown in 1917 during the Russian Revolution.

These tall, black-glazed, red-bodied drinking vessels were produced from the 15th century through the first half of the 17th century, peaking in popularity during the 16th and 17th centuries. Some were made with as many as nine handles. I.N. Hume, A Guide to Artifacts of Colonial America (Alfred A. Knopf, New York 1980), pp.102-04. The multiple handles also allow hot drinks to be passed around without pain. Tygs were made in large quantities at Wrotham in Kent and in many Staffordshire factories. Examples have surfaced at 17th-century American colonial sites, as well as in the UK.Hume 1980. There are also examples of Japanese and German tygs. Many of the leading names in Staffordshire and Worcester area have manufactured miniature three handled tygs that stand proud at only 1 to 1 7/10 inches in size. Most were probably used for decoration rather than drinking, as many of them are exquisitely painted. They are widely collected. Frilly-based tyg The term 'frilly-based tyg' is used in some English archaeological literaturee.g. E. Owles & N. Smedley, 'Archaeology in Suffolk 1967' Proceedings of the Suffolk Institute of Archaeology and History XXXI Part 1 (1967), p. 78. to refer to a type of medieval and early post-medieval drinking mug or pitcher, usually wheel-thrown with a rounded belly and a straight or flared neck, which may have one or more handles. The 'frilly base' refers to the foot-ring of the mug, which after throwing was given an alternating bossed and indented form by manual shaping with fingers or thumbs.

Amerika had been inaugurated in 1944, but in late 1940s the State Department began to feel that radio and the Voice of America would be more effective propaganda tools and, in 1952, publication of Amerika was suspended.Walter L. Hixson: Parting the Curtain: Propaganda, Culture, and the Cold War, 1945-1961 (McMillan 1997), pp. 32, 117 However, in 1956, the American and Soviet governments agreed to exchange magazines and Amerika was reborn and published in return for distribution of The USSR in the United States. The simultaneous appearance of these magazines was the result of an intergovernmental agreement, one among several cross-cultural agreements designed to sow trust amidst the rancour of international politics. Still, there was never any question in anyone's mind that each magazine was intended as a propaganda tool for the government issuing and publishing it. A few years later, The USSR changed its name to Soviet Life. While never a blatant Soviet propaganda tool, Soviet Life did hew to the government line. Yet it sought to present an informed view of Russian culture, history, scientific achievements and the various peoples inhabiting the Soviet Union. Former offices of the Soviet Life magazine located in Washington, D.C. Under the terms of the inter- governmental agreement, the subscription levels of both magazines were restricted for many years to around 30,000. In the late 1980s, with political and economic reform in the Soviet Union, there was a surge of interest in Soviet Life -- readership rose to over 50,000. In December 1991, the Soviet Union signed itself out of existence and, subsequently, the Russian government could not find the money to finance the production of Soviet Life. The last issue of Soviet Life was published in December 1991. Just over one year later, in early 1993, through an agreement between RIA Novosti (the government press agency) and Rich Frontier Publishing, Soviet Life was reborn as Russian Life. The magazine was re-initiated as a bimonthly (whereas previously Soviet Life had been a monthly magazine) and continued in that fashion, albeit with a sporadic publishing timetable, due to funding difficulties. In July 1995, the privately owned Vermont company, Russian Information Services, Inc., purchased all rights to Russian Life. Initially published as a monthly, the magazine soon settled into a bimonthly schedule. RIS has published well over 100 issues of Russian Life since 1995. Today the magazine is a 64-page colour bi-monthly magazine, with stories of Russian culture, history and life.

Publication history Ezekiel first appeared in The Amazing Spider-Man vol. 2 #30 and was created by J. Michael Straczynski and John Romita Jr. Fictional character biography Ezekiel Sims was a rich businessman who, in his younger years, ritualistically gained powers similar to those of Spider-Man. He wanted to use his powers to be a hero, but initially used them to found a corporation, believing that he could not do anything without a base of operations, and swiftly became too busy to use his powers on a daily basis. When Spider-Man emerged, Ezekiel hired half a dozen independent private detectives to investigate Spider-Man's life, allowing him to piece together who Spider-Man was from the various pieces of information they provided to him. Felicia Hardy was one of his investigators, specifically hired to track Spider-Man's appearances in foreign countries. Ezekiel, in his 50s, contacted Spider-ManThe Amazing Spider-Man vol. 2 #30. Marvel Comics and explained to him the nature of animal totems: people who gain supernatural abilities from a mystic link with certain animals. He suggested that the spider that bit Peter Parker was not mutated by the radiation, but actually trying to give Peter its powers before the radiation killed it. This meant that Spider-Man was now part of the supernatural food chain, and became a target for other totems and beings who feed on totems (Hence why so many of Spider-Man's foes were based on animals; on some level, they 'sensed' that Peter was a true totem while they were merely impostors and were thus driven to destroy him).The Amazing Spider-Man vol. 2 #32.

His strength, speed, stamina, agility, reaction time, and resistance to physical injury are all enhanced to superhuman levels. Although Ezekiel is of an advanced age, none of his physical attributes have declined over the decades. Ezekiel also possesses the ability to stick to most surfaces and crawl along them in the same way as Spider-Man. He also possesses a type of E.S.P. that serves as an early warning system in much the same way as Spider-Man's spider-sense, although his was not as developed as Spider- Man's. Because of their nearly identical powers, Ezekiel and Spider-Man are immune to each other's early warning system. In addition to his powers, Ezekiel is extremely wealthy and is a highly skilled businessman and owner of a company with international connections. As with Spider-Man, he is a formidable hand-to-hand combatant though he has had no formal training. He uses a unique type of freestyle fighting that allows him to make full use of his powers. He does not seem to have any web-generating devices like Spider- Man's web-shooters, and is never seen to produce any webbing naturally. In his conversations with Peter Parker, the subject never comes up. He is knowledgeable of the mystical nature of totems, and once told Peter the legend of the first \\"Spider-Man\\". Other versions=Spider-Verse During the \\"Spider-Verse\\" storyline, different versions of Ezekiel are featured: * One of the Spider-Men recruited to fight the Inheritors is the \\"Old Man Spider\\" of Earth-4 who wears a similar outfit to the Spider-Man of Earth-312500 (as seen in \\"The Amazing Spider-Man\\" #500).Edge of Spider-Verse #5 After being fatally injured by Daemos of the Inheritors, the \\"Old Man Spider-Man\\" is revealed to be an alternate Ezekiel who took up the Spider-Man identity after his version of Peter was killed by Morlun. Before succumbing to his wounds, Ezekiel implores the Spider-Man of Earth-616 to protect \\"the Bride, the Other, and the Scion\\". * The Earth-3145 version of Ezekiel approached Ben Parker (who had retired from being Spider-Man after Aunt May and Peter were killed by the Emerald Elf) and informed Ben about the imminent arrival of Morlun to kill him. With nothing left, Ben accepted Ezekiel's offer and was maintained in a secret bunker in Sims Tower even after New York City was destroyed in a nuclear holocaust caused by one of Doctor Octopus' blackmail schemes going horribly wrong.

He patented this process in 1894 and first produced the glass for manufacture in 1896 in Queens, New York. It differs from most iridescent glasses because the color is ingrained in the glass itself, as well as having distinctive coloring. Tiffany won a grand prize at the 1900 Paris Exposition for his Favrile glass. Tiffany used this glass in the stained-glass windows designed and made by his studio. His largest and most significant work using Favrile glass is Dream Garden (1916), commissioned by the Curtis Publishing Company for their headquarters in Philadelphia and designed by Maxfield Parrish. It is now owned by the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. History Tiffany founded his first glassmaking firm in 1892,Pevsner 2005, p. 98 which he called the Tiffany Glass and Decorating Company.Craven 2003, p. 325 The factory, Tiffany Furnaces, was located in Corona, Queens, New York.Lehmann 1918, p. 115 It was managed by English immigrant Arthur J. Nash, who was skilled in glassmaking. It was here that Tiffany developed his unique method of glassmaking: treating molten glass with metallic oxides that were absorbed into the glass and created a luxurious iridescent surface effect. Tiffany worked to develop this new glass after being strongly influenced by his 1865 trip to Europe. In London he visited the South Kensington Museum, later renamed the Victoria and Albert Museum, whose extensive collection of Roman and Syrian glass made a deep impression on him. These included iridescent glass. He also admired the coloration of medieval glass and believed that he could improve on the quality of contemporary glass. After much experimentation and development, he received the patent for Favrile glass in 1894.Duncan 2003, p.19 He made the first Favrile objects in 1896.Tutag & Hamilton 1987, p. 152 At the 1900 Paris Exposition, Tiffany's Favrile glass won the grand prize in the exposition.Burlingham 2002, p. 89 Design Favrile is different from other iridescent glasses because its color is not just on the surface, but part of the glass.Von Drachenfels 2000, p. 275 The original trade name, Fabrile, was derived from an Old English word, fabrile, meaning \\"hand-wrought\\" or handcrafted.Hesse 2007, p. 100 Tiffany later changed the word to Favrile, \\"since this sounded better\\".Warmus 2001, p.68 Some of the distinguishing colors in Favrile glass include \\"Gold Lustre,\\" \\"Samian Red,\\" \\"Mazarin Blue,\\" \\"Tel-el-amarna\\" (or Turquoise Blue), and \\"Aquamarine\\".Lehmann 1918, pp. 117-118 Uses Favrile was the first art glass to be used in stained-glass windows. Tiffany planned to make patterns in windows based on the shapes and color of his glass. Favrile glass also backs a large ornamental clock in Detroit's Guardian Building.Tutag & Hamilton 1987, p. 137 The largest and most significant glass-mosaic produced with Favrile glass is likely the Dream Garden (1916), commissioned for the Curtis Publishing Company's headquarters in Philadelphia.

It houses an about 40-year-old temple dedicated to the Hindu God Murugan. The temple can be reached by road from Chromepet en route to Hasthinapuram. The presiding deity is Sri Swaminathaswamy. The presiding deity in Kumaran Kundram is believed to be equivalent to the one in Swamimalai and stands atop the hillock facing north. It can be reached by a flight of about 80 steps. History In 1956, Chandrashekarendra Saraswati Swamigal, a twentieth-century saint and seer of the Kanchi Mutt, visited Chromepet. On looking at the hill, he proposed that a temple be built for Murugan. The temple for Siddhi Vinayagar was built in the same year. Twenty years later, while clearing the hillside for a path, a lance, the prime weapon of Lord Muruga, was found. This inspired the devotees to speed up work. The consecration of the Sri Swaminathaswamy temple was performed in 1979. Slowly, more shrines were added for Shiva, Sarabeshwara, Ambal and the Navagrahas. The temple is run by a group of trustees. The newly constructed and consecrated 5-tier Raja Gopuram of Kumaran Kundram A five tier Rajagopuram has been constructed recently. Though the spade work had commenced long ago, the actual construction work on the Rajagopuram commenced in 2011-12 and concluded in January 2014. Renovation and painting works have also been carried out in the temple in connection with the Mahakumbhabhishekam (consecration ceremony). A new Artha mandapam adjoining the Rajagopuram has been constructed. A few civil works remain to be completed(February 2014). A new Dwajasthambam (Flag Mast) has also been erected. Cultural and religious events like music, dance and discourses were held at the Arunagirinathar Hall inside the temple precincts every day for over a year in 2013-14 as a part of the Rajagopuram construction and temple renovation. Religious ceremonies connected to the consecration commenced on 3 February 2014 and the consecration was conducted between 9.00 AM and 10.30 AM IST on 9 February 2014 (Sunday) in the presence of Swami Brahmayogananda, Founder, Acharya Yoga Shanthi Gurukulam, West Mambalam, Chennai and Niranjanandagiri Swamy of Gnananandagiri Peetam, Dakshina Halasyam, Thennangur. On the day of consecration, thousands of devotees visited the shrine and took part in the full-day festivities. Shri Vijayendra Saraswathi Swamigal, the junior seer of the Kanchi Mutt visited the shrine in the evening and offered prayers to the deities. The presiding deity was taken in a procession in a magnificent floral palanquin in the night to the accompaniment of temple music and chants of devotees. The monthly circumambulation of the small hill temple on the night of full moon day (Girivalam) attracts hundreds of devotees every month. The annual Soorasamhaaram festival (in October/November) is the prime festival in this temple along with Karthigai Deepam celebrations (in November/December). A large group of devotees by the name of \\"Sri Padam\\" are rendering regular service at the temple on voluntary basis. Prasanna Yoga Anjaneya Temple Prasanna Yoga Hanuman Opposite to the Sri Swaminathaswamy Temple (Kumaran Kundram) is a small vaishnavite temple run by a hereditary trust. The presiding deity is Sri Prasanna Venkatesa Perumal and the goddess is Alarmel Mangai Thayar. To the left of the presiding deity is Sri Yoga Narisimha Swamy. There are separate shrines for Prasanna Yoga Anjaneyar (Hanuman)and Ramanujar. The ground where this temple is built belonged to Shri. Srinivasan Thiagarajan, who gave it in exchange for another piece of land in the same locality. The temple attracts large crowds on Saturdays, New Year Eve and Vaikunta Ekadasi.

So called, after the name of one of the early makers (which was taken from the goddess Vesta, a Roman deity of fire and the hearth), such came into use around the 1830s and were produced extensively between the years 1890 and 1920. During this period (of years), almost everyone carried strike anywhere matches, so they could ignite stoves, lanterns and other devices. Early matches were unreliable and prone to ignite from rubbing on one another or spontaneously. Accordingly, most people carried a match safe to house their matches. Wealthy people had ‚Äòmatch safes‚Äô, made of gold or silver, while common folk had ones made of tin or brass. Boot Matchsafe, late 19th century, with striker on sole. Silver with niello. They were made throughout the world including the United Kingdom, in the U.S.A., continental Europe and Australia. Significant English makers of vesta cases included notable silversmiths such as Sampson Mordan and Asprey & Co. Significant American manufacturers of match safes include Wm. B. Kerr, Gorham, Unger Brothers, Battin, Blackington, Whiting, George Scheibler and Shreve & Co. The different patterns and types must run into many thousands. As well as plain and decorated square, oblong and round cases, a myriad of novelty shapes have been recorded; silver, brass or white metal pigs with hinged heads were popular, as were vesta cases in the form of Mr Punch, hearts, skulls, musical instruments (often violas), owls, boots and shoes, bottles, ladies' legs and so on. Matchsafe, late 19th century, in the form of a pair of women's bloomers, featuring simulated creases and lace cuffs. Lid on top. Striker on lid. They were also made in a wide range of materials, including pressed brass, pressed tin, gunmetal, nickel silver, gold, bone, ivory, wood of varying types, early plastics like tortoiseshell and bakelite, and ceramics. The more unusual materials included leather and the sea bean seed from Entada gigas commonly known as the monkey-ladder, sea bean, C≈ìur de la Mer or Sea Heart. Although the majority were made of inexpensive materials, some were made of precious metals or enameled. These precious metal cases typically had a gold wash interior to prevent corrosion by the chemically active match heads. \\"Compliments of National India Rubber Company\\", c. 1905, American. A distinguishing characteristic of match safes is that they have a ribbed surface, usually on the bottom, for lighting the matches. Some match safes incorporated a cigar cutter or a small knife blade as well. Often made to be carried in the pocket, some were small enough to be suspended from a fob chain or an Albert chain. Others were made to be left in a handy position in the home, such as the kitchen or close to a fireplace. These were usually larger than the pocket vestas, and were sometimes referred to as standing or table vestas. Pocket vestas and sovereign cases were sometimes combined into the one item. Promotional vestas were sometimes produced by different companies, e.g. champagne producers. The Gillette company produced a brass razor blade case with a ribbed bottom that could be used as a vesta case after the razor blades had been used. Occasionally a vesta case was made to double as a go-to-bed matchbox. Vesta cases are still to be found in a vast array of shapes, sizes and materials, and many are extremely attractive.

However, in 1932 Stalin's government took control of the arts with the publication of \\"On the Reconstruction of Literary-Artistic Organizations\\"; a decree that put artists' unions under the control of the Communist Party. Two years later, Stalin instituted a policy that unified aesthetic and ideological objectives, which was called Socialist Realism, broadly defined as art that was, \\"socialist in content and realist in form.\\" Moreover, the new policy defined four categories of unacceptable art: political art, religious art, erotic art, and \\"formalistic\\" art, which included abstraction, expressionism, and conceptual art. Beginning in 1936, avant-garde artists who were unable or unwilling to adapt to the new policy were forced out of their positions, and often either murdered or sent to the gulag, as part of Stalin's Great Purges.Kornetchuk, Elena. \\"From the 1917 Revolution to Khrushchev's Thaw,\\" Nonconformist Art: The Soviet Experience 1956-1986, eds.

Furthermore, Stalin's cult of personality was recognized as detrimental, and within weeks many paintings and busts bearing his likeness were removed from public places. Artists such as Aleksandr Gerasimov, who had made their careers painting idealized portraits of Stalin, were forced out of their official positions, as they had become embarrassing to the new leadership.Kornetchuk, Elena. \\"From the 1917 Revolution to Khrushchev's Thaw,\\" Nonconformist Art: The Soviet Experience 1956-1986, eds.

Sculpture Park, Uttersberg, Sweden The \\"thaw\\" era ended quickly, when in 1962, Khrushchev attended the public Manezh exhibition (an episode known as the Manege Affair) at which several nonconformist artists were exhibiting, including Ulo Sooster with his Eye in the Egg. Khrushchev got into a public and now-famous argument with Ernst Neizvestny, sculptor (1925-2016), regarding the function of art in society. However, this altercation had the unintended effect of fomenting unofficial art as a movement. Artists could no longer hold delusions that the state would recognize their art, yet the climate had become friendly and open enough that a coherent organization had formed. Additionally, punishments for unofficial artists became less severe; they were denied admittance to the union instead of being executed. As a \\"movement\\" nonconformist art was stylistically diverse. However, in the post-thaw era its function and role in society became clear. As the Russian curator, author and museum director Joseph Bakstein wrote, > The duality of life in which the official perception of everyday reality is > independent of the reality of the imagination leads to a situation where art > plays a special role in society. In any culture, art is a special reality, > but in the Soviet Union, art was doubly real precisely because it had no > relation to reality. It was a higher reality....

Alla Rosenfeld and Norton T. Dodge. London: Thames and > Hudson, 1995, p. 332. .  Moscow Artists' Groups  There were many artistic groups and movements that were active in the Soviet Union after the period of the thaw. They can be difficult to classify because often they were not related due to stylistic objectives, but geographical proximity. Furthermore, participation in these groups was fluid as the community of nonconformist artists in Moscow was relatively small and close-knit. Lianozovo Group The Lianozovo Group formed in 1958 was named after the small village Lianozovo outside Moscow, where most of the artists lived and worked. The members of this group were: Evgenii Kropivnitsky , the artist and poet, Olga Potapova , Oscar Rabin, Lidia Masterkova, Vladimir Nemukhin, Nikolai Vechtomov and the poets Vsevolod Nekrasov , Genrikh Sapgir, and Igor Kholin. This group was not related due to aesthetic concerns, but due to \\"their shared search for a new sociocultural identity.\\" critic and theorist Victor Tupitsyn considered that, \\"the aestheticization of misery is precisely what distinguishes the representatives of the de-classed communal intelligentsia of the thaw era from their predecessors (the Socialist Realists), who created a paradisiac image of history.\\"Tupitsyn, Victor. \\"Nonidentity with Identity: Moscow Communal Modernism, 1950s-1980s,\\" Nonconformist Art: The Soviet Experience 1956-1986, eds. Alla Rosenfeld and Norton T. Dodge. London: Thames and Hudson, 1995, p. 86. Many members of the Lianozovo group worked in an abstract style. The 1957 thaw resulted in the discovery of Western artistic practices and historical Russian avant-garde traditions by young Soviet artists. Artists began experimenting with abstraction, as it was the antithesis of Socialist Realism. However, the fallout from the Manezh exhibition, in 1962, caused restrictions to be enforced once again. The new restrictions could not however, curtail what the young artists had learned during the five-year interlude. Additionally, Victor Tupitsyn points out that the 1960s mark an era of \\"decommunalization\\" in the Soviet Union. Khrushchev worked to improve housing conditions, and a consequence of this was that artists began to get studios of their own, or shared spaces with like-minded colleagues. Officially, those in the Lianozovo group were members of the Moscow Union of Graphic Artists, working in the applied and graphic arts. As such, they were not permitted to hold painting exhibitions, as that fell under the domain of the Artists' Union. Consequently, apartment exhibitions and literary salons began at this time as a means of publicly exhibiting. However, the Lianozovo group in particular was often harassed by Soviet officials as they were vigilant in pursuing public exhibitions of their work. In an attempt to circumvent the law, the Lianozovo group proposed an open-air exhibition in 1974, inviting dozens of other nonconformist artists also to exhibit. The result was the demolition of the exhibition by bulldozers and water cannons, for which reason the exhibition is still known as the Bulldozer Exhibition. Sretensky Boulevard Group Oleg Vasiliev, Before the Sunrise, 1964 A group of artists that had studios on and around Sretensky Boulevard, Moscow, became a loosely associated like-minded community in the late 1960s. The members of this group were: Ilya Kabakov, √úlo Sooster, Eduard Steinberg, Erik Bulatov, Sergey Shablavin, Oleg Vassiliev, Viktor Pivovarov, Vladimir Yankilevsky, and sculptor Ernst Neizvestny. The artists' studios were also used as venues to show and exchange ideas about unofficial art. Like their colleagues in the Lianozovo group, the majority of visual artists who were part of the Sretensky Boulevard Group were admitted to the Moscow Union of Graphic Artists. This allowed the artists to work officially as book illustrators and graphic designers, which provided them with studio space, materials, and time to work on their own projects. Although they shared the same type of official career, the Sretensky group is not stylistically homogeneous. The name merely denotes the community that they formed as a result of working in close proximity to each other. Moscow Conceptualists Many of the artists on Sretensky Boulevard were part of the Moscow Conceptualist school. This movement arose in the 1970s to describe the identity of the contemporary Russian artist in opposition to the government. As Joseph Bakstein explained, \\"The creation of this nonconformist tradition was impelled by the fact that an outsider in the Soviet empire stood alone against a tremendous state machine, a great Leviathan that threatened to engulf him. To preserve one's identity in this situation, one had to create a separate value system, including a system of aesthetic values.\\" Erik Bulatov explains that conceptualist art is, \\"a rebellion of man against the everyday reality of life... a picture interests me as some kind of system... opening into the space of my everyday existence.\\"Roberts, Norma, ed. The Quest for Self-Expression: Painting in Moscow and Leningrad, 1965-1990, Columbus: Columbus Museum of Art, 1990, p. 72 This group includes Ilya Kabakov, Erik Bulatov, Oleg Vassiliev, Sergey Shablavin, Komar and Melamid, Ivan Chuikov ,http://www.rusartnet.com/biographies/russian-artists/20th- century/modern/nonconformist/1970s/moscow-conceptualism/ivan-chuikov/ Ivan Chuikov artist, Member of the Moscow Conceptualist Group. Viktor Pivovarov, and also broadly encompasses the Sots artists and the Collective Actions group, which were both influential in the construction of Russian conceptualist art. The Petersburg groups=1960s - 1970sMikhail Shemiakin's Group= Mikhail Chemiakin Mikhail Chemiakin's St. Petersburg Non-conformist Group developed out of a 1964 exhibition at the Hermitage Museum, where Chemiakin worked as a gallery assistant. The official name of the exhibition was Exhibition of the artist-workers of the economic part of the Hermitage: Towards the 200th anniversary of Hermitage and it included the work of Chemiakin, V. Kravchenko, V. Uflyand, V. Ovchinnikov and O. Liagatchev. Opening on March 30‚Äì31, it was closed by the authorities on April 1. The Hermitage director, Mikhail Artamonov, was removed from his post. In 1967 the Petersburg Group Manifesto was written and signed by Chemiakin, O. Liagatchev, E. Yesaulenko and V. Ivanov. V. Ivanov and M. Chemiakin had previously developed the idea of Metaphysical Synthesism, which proposed creating a new form of icon painting through the study of religious art across the ages. A. Vasiliev and the miniature painter V. Makarenko joined the group later. Four years after the founding of the group, in 1971, Chemiakin emigrated to France, and later in 1981 to the United States. In 2007 he returned to France, where he resides now. Liagatchev, until his emigration to Paris in 1975, and Vasiliev continued to participate in exhibitions of non- conformist artists in Leningrad at the Gaza Palace of Culture (1974) and the Nevsky Palace of Culture (1975). Liagatchev's work in this period includes: Kafka, Intimeniy XX (1973) and Composition - Canon (1975).

Personal life During a Ring of Honor's Straight Shootin interview in 2004, Scaggs admitted to hard drug use while he was in ECW and WWF, but it had been significantly accelerated during his stint in WWF due to the fact that he was simply making more money and thus had the opportunity to use more. Scaggs regretted his covert lifestyle at the time, and wondered that if he had admitted to WWF and himself that he had a problem, his career might have lasted longer in WWF. He also admitted to have kicked his hard drug use several years ago, although still actively using marijuana.

He is best known for his appearances with ECW from 1995 to 2000 and WWE from 1998 to 2005. His ring name is a reference to the Blue Meanies, the antagonists from the 1968 animated film Yellow Submarine. Professional wrestling career=Early career Heffron started wrestling in the Midwest out of Al Snow's Bodyslammers Pro Wrestling Gym in Lima, Ohio in March 1994. He continued to wrestle in various independent wrestling promotions throughout the Mid- Atlantic and Midwest regions until 1996. Extreme Championship WrestlingThe Blue World Order (1995‚Äì1998)= Heffron was noticed by Raven and Stevie Richards at a Steel City Wrestling show in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and was asked by Raven to become Richards' sidekick in ECW. He went on to become The Blue Meanie, taking his name and persona from the villains of the 1968 animated film Yellow Submarine, in 1995 in ECW at the November To Remember event. He was the flunky for Richards, who was the flunky for Raven. Heffron, Richards, and Nova performed several skits but their most famous was the bWo, a parody of WCW's top heel group, the nWo. Meanie played the role of Da Blue Guy in the bWo, lampooning nWo member Scott Hall's nickname \\"The Bad Guy\\". =Return (2000)= Under the name Blue Boy, Heffron returned to ECW in 2000. During this period, Heffron had lost over 100 pounds of weight.http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/profiles/b/blue-meanie.php Obsessed with Wrestling His gimmick was that of an arrogant stud who would insult the looks and weight of fans and other wrestlers, in an ironic twist. World Wrestling Federation/EntertainmentBluedust (1998‚Äì1999)= Heffron made his WWF debut on the November 29, 1998 episode of Sunday Night Heat, interfering in a match between Duane Gill and Christian. He then spent some time as part of Al Snow's J.O.B. Squad. He rose to short prominence as Bluedust, a revival of a 1996 mockery of the Goldust gimmick he used in ECW, this time paired with Goldust himself. Bluedust and Goldust were pitted against one another at the WWF's St. Valentine's Day Massacre: In Your House pay-per-view, a match Goldust eventually won. Heffron would later be pulled under Goldust's \\"spell\\", calling him \\"mommy\\" and serving as a manager, all the while bickering with Goldust's other manager, Ryan Shamrock. After Goldust dumped both Meanie and Shamrock, Heffron made little headway in the WWF. He challenged Jeff Jarrett for the WWF Intercontinental Championship on the July 17, 1999 episode of Shotgun Saturday Night, but lost. He left the WWF in late 1999. =Brief return (2005)= Talia Madison (right) at an independent show in 2005 The Blue Meanie appeared at WWE's ECW One Night Stand pay-per-view on June 12, 2005. He made headlines at the event for being bloodied and deliberately (and legitimately) injured by WWE wrestler JBL. A few weeks after the incident, during which time Heffron indicated on his website that he was considering pursuing legal action against JBL, it was announced that he had signed a short-term deal with WWE and reformed the bWo with Stevie Richards and Simon Dean (formerly Nova). On the July 7 episode of SmackDown!, the bWo drove to ringside in JBL's limousine, then proceeded to spraypaint \\"bWo\\" on the hood. This led to a No Disqualification match between JBL and Meanie later that evening, which Meanie won after interference from Richards, who hit a stiff chair shot to JBL's head, and World Heavyweight Champion Batista. The Mexicools later defeated Meanie, Richards, and Nova in a six-man tag match at The Great American Bash. Independent circuit (2005‚Äìpresent) In 2005, Heffron wrestled at Hardcore Homecoming against Tracy Smothers in what commentator Joey Styles called a \\"comedy match\\", and also appeared with Raven during Raven's match against Sandman. In April 2006, Heffron announced on his blog that he had been diagnosed with empyema, and had undergone emergency surgery to have part of his lung removed. On June 3, 2007, he defeated Smothers to become the World Champion again, but lost it at the next event on August 5, to Jason Bane in a Street Fight. On September 8, he defeated Troy Justice to become APWF Heavyweight Champion. On December 28, he was managed by Tammy Lynn Sytch and teamed with The Patriot to defeat The Sychadellic Sissies (Ace Darling and Nicky Oceans) at National Wrestling Superstars Holiday Tour. Da Blue Guy (right) with Hollywood Nova at Chikara's King of Trios event in 2015 On January 18, 2008, he defeated Danny Demanto at a National Wrestling Superstars event in Manville, New Jersey. On April 12, he and JD Love defeated Zaquary Springate III and Isys Ephex in a surprise appearance at 2CW's Living on the Edge. On August 8, 2010, Heffron was slated to appear at the TNA PPV Hardcore Justice; however, he could not attend the event and was replaced by a fake Blue Meanie named The Blue Tilly. On September 4, 2015, Da Blue Guy, Big Stevie Cool and Hollywood Nova reunited as the Blue World Order for Chikara's 2015 King of Trios tournament. They were eliminated from the tournament in their first round match by the Devastation Corporation (Blaster McMassive, Flex Rumblecrunch and Max Smashmaster). Monster Factory (2012‚Äìpresent) Heffron, under his Blue Meanie name, currently wrestles and is a trainer at Monster Factory.  Mind of the Meanie  In March, 2020, Heffron began a podcast called Mind of the Meanie with co-host Josh Shernoff. Throughout 2020, the podcast expanded into a brand featuring merchandise, spinoff video series (Mrs. Meanie‚Äôs Run-in, Alternative Commentary) and a cartoon series called MeanieToons. Acting career Heffron has appeared in the WB sitcom Nikki, the documentary film Beyond the Mat, the film Communication Breakdown, and the cult horror film Swamp Zombies (with Dan Severn).

She began her professional wrestling career in companies such as the National Wrestling Alliance, where she teamed with Joyce Grable, with whom she held the NWA Women's World Tag Team Championship twice. In the 1980s, she joined the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). She held the WWF Women's Championship twice and feuded with The Fabulous Moolah over the title. She was also involved in a storyline with singer Cyndi Lauper called the \\"Rock 'n' Wrestling Connection\\". Richter, however, left the WWF after losing the championship in controversial fashion. She then worked in the World Wrestling Council and American Wrestling Association, where she held both companies' women's titles. Professional wrestling career=Training (1979‚Äì1983) Wendi Richter was trained at The Fabulous Moolah's Lillian Ellison School of Professional Wrestling by Leilani Kai, Judy Martin and Joyce Grable and made her professional debut in 1979. In early 1982, Richter tag teamed with Moolah against Velvet McIntyre and Princess Victoria for three matches for the World Wide Wrestling Federation. Richter was later paired with Joyce Grable, with whom she also trained for six weeks, to form a tag team called The Texas Cowgirls. In late 1982, they wrestled in a series of matches in Canada's Stampede Wrestling against Velvet McIntyre and Judy Martin. She continued her feud with McIntyre in Bill Watts' Mid-South Wrestling Association, where she was defeated twice. While in Mid-South Wrestling Association she was a friend of Jim Cornette who made her an honorary member of the Midnight Express.WWE Network Wendi Richter vs Princess Victoria Richter and Grable continued their rivalry with McIntyre and Martin into April 1983 in Verne Gagne's American Wrestling Association. In May, the team reformed in Stampede Wrestling in matches against McIntyre and Penny Mitchell. The team also won the NWA Women's World Tag Team Championship twice. World Wrestling FederationRock 'n' Wrestling (1983-1985)= Richter returned stateside signing with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in late 1983. In April 1984, Richter teamed with Peggy Lee for a series of matches with old rivals Velvet McIntyre and Princess Victoria. WWF owner Vince McMahon brought in Cyndi Lauper for a feud with Lou Albano (who had appeared as Lauper's dad in her Girls Just Want to Have Fun music video). Albano seconded WWF Women's Champion Fabulous Moolah, while Lauper was in the corner of Wendi Richter. Richter defeated Moolah at MTV's The Brawl to End It All for the Women's Championship on July 23, 1984, with Richter lifting her own shoulder off the canvas during a double-pinfall situation while Moolah's shoulders remained down. With the win, she ended what was billed as the longest championship reign in professional wrestling history (Moolah's 28-year reign as recognized by the WWF; in reality she had lost the title several times between 1956 and 1978, and Richter's win had in reality only ended a nearly seven-year reign by Moolah as champion). The broadcast of the women's match earned MTV its largest ratings in history up to that point. This match was also the beginning of the \\"Rock 'n' Wrestling Connection\\", an era that combined both music and professional wrestling. Richter faced Moolah's prot√©g√©, Leilani Kai, who defeated Richter for the title, in early 1985 at The War to Settle the Score. She regained the title at the first WrestleMania one month later. While wrestling for the WWF, Richter referred to herself as \\"150 pounds of twisted steel and sex appeal\\". Richter was also animated for a CBS Saturday morning cartoon, Hulk Hogan's Rock 'n' Wrestling. In addition, she appeared in Lauper's music video for \\"She Bop\\".Ellison, Lillian. First Goddess of the Squared Circle, p.173. =The Original Screwjob (1985)= In 1985, after losing and then regaining the title from rival Leilani Kai at the inaugural WrestleMania, Richter was scheduled to defend her title at Madison Square Garden on November 25 of that same year against a mysterious masked opponent known only as The Spider. During the match, The Spider broke from the pre-scripted events and pinned Richter's shoulders to the mat. The referee‚Äîwho was in on the plan‚Äîdelivered a swift three count, despite Richter kicking out after a count of one. Richter ignored the bell and continued to attack The Spider, unmasking the new champion to reveal that it was The Fabulous Moolah in disguise. Interviewed for The Fabulous Moolah episode of the 2019 documentary series Dark Side of the Ring, Richter claimed she had no idea that Moolah was The Spider that evening until she unmasked her. It was reported that the plan to rid Richter of the title was concocted by WWF Chairman Vince McMahon, who brought in Moolah after Richter refused to sign a new contract with the WWF. Richter, however, claims she was still under her original five-year contract, but that she regularly had disagreements with McMahon about her compensation. She also claims that when she arrived at the arena that day, she was surprised to find Moolah backstage, as she never showed up to events at which she was not scheduled to wrestle. After the match, an infuriated Richter left the arena in her wrestling gear, took a cab to the airport, and booked herself on a flight out of New York. Afterward, she never spoke to Moolah again. Independent circuit (1987‚Äì2005) Upon leaving the WWF, Richter wrestled in Puerto Rico, Japan, and throughout the United States in independent promotions. In Puerto Rico's World Wrestling Council, she traded the WWC Women's Championship with Monster Ripper, holding the belt twice: once in May 1987 and once in July 1987. Richter surfaced in the American Wrestling Association (AWA) in 1987 to challenge champion Madusa Miceli for the AWA Women's Championship, winning the title in December 1988. On December 13, 1988, she participated in a mixed tag team match at SuperClash III with partners The Top Guns (Ricky Rice and Derrick Dukes) against Badd Company (Paul Diamond and Pat Tanaka) and Madusa Miceli. Richter's team won the match when she pinned Miceli. On January 29, 2005, Richter appeared at WrestleReunion in an eight-woman tag team match (teaming with Bambi, Malia Hosaka, and Jenny Taylor wrestling against Sherri Martel, Peggy Lee Leather, Krissy Vaine, and Amber O'Neal. In August of that same year, Richter appeared at the second WrestleReunion event, WrestleReunion 2, in a six-person tag team match. Life after wrestling and WWE Hall of Fame (2005‚Äìpresent) In the years after her retirement, Richter was uninvolved with wrestling. In a 2005 shoot interview, she expressed disgust towards the portrayal of women in the WWE product, and was still hurt over her WWF exit. In 2010, Richter was offered induction in the WWE Hall of Fame Class of 2010, which she accepted. She was inducted by Roddy Piper. In contrast of her shoot interviews, her speech spoke fondly of her wrestling career and how the WWE Divas thanked her for her influence. Richter's speech ended joyfully, exclaiming \\"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun!\\" On the June 16, 2012 episode of Raw, Richter appeared in a in-ring segment along with Cyndi Lauper, Roddy Piper and then-Diva's Champion Layla as part of the \\"1000th episode\\" buildup. Piper expressed his gratitude to Richter and Lauper for their \\"Rock 'N Wrestling\\" angle and presented Lauper with a gold record, with which she eventually hit Heath Slater, who at the time had a gimmick of insulting veteran Superstars before getting his comeuppance. Personal life Richter grew up in Dallas, Texas, and before she entered the sport of professional wrestling, she worked on her family's ranch and took part in rodeo competitions. She attended Bossier High School, where she participated in volleyball, track, and cross-country. She later majored in computer programming at Dallas's Draughon's Business College. In the 1980s, she moved to Crystal River, Florida. After leaving the wrestling business, Richter worked as a real estate agent. She also returned to school for 13 years, earning a degree in physical therapy and a master's degree in occupational therapy. Aside from therapy, Richter competes in dog shows, including the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show. She was once married to Hugo Savinovich, an announcer for the WWF. In 2019 she was featured in the documentary Circle of Champions: The History of Women's Pro Wrestling directed by Christopher Annino.

In 2008, Move America Forward sent a delegation to Guantanamo Bay to thank troops for their service. The trip was organized by Kylie Williams, the official ambassador for veterans' advocacy for the State of Florida. The second Honoring our Heroes at the Holidays national bus tour collected over 200,000 cards that year. That year, Move America Forward hosted the first Troopathon, an online fundraiser, to raise money to send care packages to troops. K9 Care Packages, a program to support military working dogs and their handlers, was launched by the organization in October 2011. Move America Forward was named \\"Top-rated Nonprofit\\" by Great Nonprofits in 2014 and 2015. That March, the Rogers Family Company donated coffee and tea to Move America Forward for troops. Stag Arms partnered with the organization for the 2014 Troopathon in July. In March 2015, Danny Gonzalez, Move America Forward's Director of Communications shared with Sputnik that the US Transportation Security Administration's security screening methods have been defective since inception and that proposed reevaluation of screening procedures will have no effect. In June 2015, Move America Forward hosted its 8th annual Troopathon fundraiser to help send care packages to American troops deployed in war zones overseas. The organization raised over $280,000. State Assemblyman Devon Mathis, Hulk Hogan, Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Mark Levin, Geraldo Rivera, Brian Kilmeade, Dennis Miller, Adam Corolla, Herman Cain, Ted Nugent, Jerry Bruckheimer, Joe Theismann, Tony Orlando, and Nancy Grace made appearances on the broadcast that year. Prior to the 2015 Chattanooga shootings on July 16, 2015, Move America Forward advocated for more security at military recruiting centers. After the shooting, the organization released a statement in support of lawmakers that wants to allow military recruiters to carry firearms. In 2016, Move America Forward partnered with the Wounded Warrior Project to send care packages to troops overseas to show support for those away from their families during the holiday season. Move America Forward received a 2 out of 4 star rating from Charity Navigator. Guidestar rated the organization as a Platinum Participant. Policies and programs Care packages ready for shipping. The organization annually hosts \\"Troopathon,\\" an 8-hour live online broadcast that it says it uses to help send packages to American troops. The fundraiser hosts movie stars, TV personalities, elected officials, professional athletes, musicians, talk radio hosts and many other supporters. In a partnership with the Jelly Belly Company, Move America Forward introduced a program where soldiers would receive specially wrapped 2 oz. bags of jelly bellies to use as gift to the native people they were in contact on a daily basis with. Each specially marked package displays these words in English, Arabic, and Pashto language: \\"A gift from the America People in hope that your country will one day enjoy the freedom and opportunities that we have in the United States.\\" Controversy In 2014, ProPublica released a report accusing Move America Forward of giving a percentage of its donations to for-profit companies run by people affiliated with Tea Party Express. Move America Forward responded to each allegation in the piece and dismissed them as false.

The baseload (also base load) on a grid is the minimum level of demand on an electrical grid over a span of time, for example, one week. This demand can be met by unvarying power plants, dispatchable generation, or by a collection of smaller intermittent energy sources, depending on which approach has the best mix of low cost, availability and high reliability in any particular market. The remainder of demand, varying throughout a day, is met by dispatchable generation which can be turned up or down quickly, such as load following power plants, peaking power plants, or energy storage. Power plants that do not change their power output quickly, such as large coal or nuclear plants, are generally called baseload power plants. Donald G. Fink, H. Wayne Beatty (ed), Standard Handbook for Electrical Engineers, Eleventh Edition, Mc-Graw Hill, 1978 , pp. 12-16 through 12-18 Historically, most or all of baseload demand was met with baseload power plants, however with increasing levels of renewables and advances in flexible generation this is becoming less common. Description Grid operators take long and short term bids to provide electricity over various time periods and balance supply and demand continuously. The detailed adjustments are known as the unit commitment problem in electrical power production. While historically large power grids used unvarying power plants to meet the base load, there is no specific technical requirement for this to be so. The base load can equally well be met by the appropriate quantity of intermittent power sources and dispatchable generation. Unvarying power plants can be coal, nuclear, combined cycle plants, which may take several days to start up and shut down, hydroelectric, geothermal, biogas, biomass, solar thermal with storage and ocean thermal energy conversion. The desirable attribute of dispatchability applies to some gas plants, wind (through blade pitch) and hydroelectricity. Grid operators also use curtailment to shut plants out of the grid when their energy is not needed. There are 195 gigawatts of grid storage installed world-wide; 94% is pumped-storage hydroelectricity; 2% is in batteries. Pumped storage uses cheap power at times of low demand, usually night, to pump water from a lower reservoir to an upper reservoir, then lets it drop back through turbines during peak demand times, usually in the day. Availability of solar power in peak hours of the day can reduce the need for storage. The biggest storage facility in the world is on the Virginia-West Virginia border, with 50% more capacity than the Hoover Dam.  Economics  Grids with high penetration of renewable energy sources generally need more flexible generation rather than baseload generation Grid operators solicit bids to find the cheapest sources of electricity over short and long term buying periods. Nuclear and coal plants have very high fixed costs, high plant load factor but very low marginal costs, though not as low as solar, wind, and hydroelectric. On the other hand, peak load generators, such as natural gas, have low fixed costs, low plant load factor and high marginal costs. Coal and nuclear power plants do not change production to match power consumption demands since it is more economical to operate them at constant production levels, and not all power plants are designed for it. However, some nuclear power stations, such as those in France, are physically capable of being used as load following power plants and do alter their output, to some degree, to help meet varying demands.Nuclear Development, June 2011, page 10 from http://www.oecd-nea.org/ Some combined-cycle plants usually fuelled by gas, can provide baseload power, as well as being able to be cost- effectively cycled up and down to match more rapid fluctuations in consumption. Different plants and technologies may have differing capacities to increase or decrease output on demand: nuclear plants are generally run at close to maximum output continuously (apart from maintenance, refueling and periodic refurbishment), while coal-fired plants may be cycled over the course of a day to meet demand. Plants with multiple generating units may be used as a group to improve the \\"fit\\" with demand, by turning units on and off. According to National Grid plc chief executive officer Steve Holliday in 2015, baseload is \\"outdated\\", as microgrids would become the primary means of production, and large powerplants relegated to supply the remainder.

Early life Pulsford was born in 1961 in Newport, Monmouthshire, and grew up with two sisters, Angela and Jan. (Angela would later play violin on certain Bush songs, as well as on one of Cyndi Lauper's albums.) Pulsford attended Fairfax High School (Sutton Coldfield) the University of Bradford in Bradford, West Yorkshire before dropping out with the intent of playing in a rock band. Music career= Pre-Bush (1979 - 1992)  In 1979, aged 18, Pulsford was involved in various bands with friend Neil Crossley. Performing in pubs and bars in Lancaster, the groups played rhythm and blues, power pop, and what Pulsford proclaimed to be \\"fake jazz\\". In the 1980s, Pulsford joined a female-fronted funk band called Taming The Outback. Influenced by James White and the Blacks, Pulsford didn't enjoy his tenure in the band, but remained a member for over a year because of a relationship with the group's manager. Puslford took a year of from music in the mid-1980s, which he stated in 1999 was due to being \\"fed up with being in crap bands\\". In 1987, Pulsford formed a group called The Charms, who performed a single concert in High Wycombe supporting Thee Hypnotics. Shortly thereafter, Pulsford started the band King Blank, who released two studio albums, The Real Dirt (1988) and King Blank to the Ian Lowery Group (1989). After a 1990 promotional tour of the United States, inclusive of a performance at CBGB, New York, King Blank had dissolved by 1991.  Bush (1992-2002)  In 1992, Pulsford met Gavin Rossdale in a London club and they discovered a mutual appreciation for several musical groups and artists. They formed a band called Future Primitive and were joined by bassist Dave Parsons and drummer Robin Goodridge and managed by Joe Oliver. Shortly thereafter the band was renamed Bush after Shepherd's Bush, London. Pulsford was the band's lead guitarist. Bush released their debut album, Sixteen Stone, in 1994. The album went six times platinum, riding the strength of the grunge movement and such hit singles as \\"Comedown,\\" \\"Glycerine,\\" \\"Machinehead,\\" \\"Little Things,\\" and \\"Everything Zen.\\" They achieved further success with three more albums and hit singles such as \\"Swallowed,\\" \\"Greedy Fly,\\" \\"The Chemicals Between Us,\\" \\"Letting the Cables Sleep,\\" and \\"The People That We Love.\\" Pulsford released a solo album in 1999 entitled Heavenly Toast on the Paradise Road. All material on the album was written by Pulsford. In 2002, after the release of the album Golden State, Pulsford took a break from touring with the band while his wife was pregnant. He was replaced by Chris Traynor temporarily and his future in the band became the subject of much speculation among fans. Rossdale later confirmed that he intended to make the next Bush album with Traynor and said that Pulsford had quit the band. Despite Rossdale affirming that he wanted to continue Bush with Traynor, the band went on an indefinite hiatus following the end of the \\"Golden State\\" tour. Rossdale later formed Institute with Traynor. Backtracking on his previous assertion that Bush could continue without Pulsford, Rossdale stated that he started a new band because he didn‚Äôt want to dilute everything Bush had accomplished by changing members. After Bush Since the breakup of Bush, Pulsford has spent time with his family. However, he has remained musically active recording in his home studio and producing other artists' work. In 2008 he was working with British alternative rock group Furlined as a producer and occasional guitarist. Pulsford also worked with singer Emma Holland on her second album, and in 2012 produced the debut album by London singer/songwriter Dave Giles, entitled \\"Love, Life, Loss And Tea\\", released on 28 October 2012. In addition to working with other artists, Pulsford has expressed his intent to release another solo album. Bush Reformation In June 2010 Bush's return was announced and Chris Traynor, who had played with Gavin Rossdale since Bush ended, was installed as the band's new lead guitarist. Pulsford was joined by bassist Dave Parsons in turning down the opportunity to rejoin the band. Personal life Nigel Pulsford married his wife Judith Rose on 20 July 1996. He has three children. They currently live in Bath, UK, where Pulsford owns his store Vintage and Rare Guitars LTD.

Part 1: Origin of the Species  Larson recounts his childhood by showing several pictures supposedly drawn by him when he was a kid. (Example: A picture of a kid sitting on a tire in pitch blackness sports the caption \\"I believe this is my earliest memory of riding in the car when my family took our annual vacation.\\") He shows panels of Nature's Way and talks about his early struggles as a cartoonist before he established himself in the field. While on vacation from his regular job as an investigator for the local humane society (\\"to whom I never disclosed the fact that on the way to the job interview I ran over a dog\\"), he left his one and only copy of his portfolio at the headquarters of the San Francisco Chronicle, waiting several days until they decided to hire him. After returning home, he received a letter that his local newspaper had decided to discontinue Nature's Way. Larson says that if the letter had arrived a week earlier, \\"I never would have made the trip to San Francisco. The wind would definitely have gone out of my sails.\\"  Part 2: Evolution  Larson explains the creative process he goes through in making cartoons, showing the original doodles in his sketchbook alongside the final published versions. Sometimes he makes large changes to his initial idea, other times the differences are more subtle. (Example: A sketch of \\"If Dogs Drove,\\" showing canine drivers hanging their heads out the window, was changed to \\"When dogs go to work,\\" which depicts a bus-full of dogs with their heads hanging out the window.) He discusses the reasons for the changes he makes, and in a few cases he admits that he now prefers an earlier version, or that the final version could have been changed further. He also shows doodles that he never published, most of which he admits weren't that funny. (\\"Anyone who attaches more significance to them needs to get out more often.\\") He then shows several cartoons that were based on little short stories he wrote for a change of pace.  Part 3: Mutations  He devotes one section to mistakes that he made, or that editors made when altering his cartoons for one reason or another. These include incomplete drawings, scientific errors (like one featuring polar bears and penguins in the same habitat), typos in the caption, and the right caption set to the wrong cartoon (one time, a Dennis the Menace cartoon featuring the kids eating sandwiches was inadvertently‚Äîor maybe not so inadvertently‚Äîset to the Far Side caption, \\"Oh brother!...Not hamsters again!\\", while the Far Side cartoon got the Dennis caption‚Äî\\"Lucky thing I learned to make peanut butter sandwiches or we woulda starved to death by now.\\"). In a separate section called \\"Subtle Things,\\" he discusses the techniques he brings to the cartooning table.  Part 4: Stimulus‚ÄìResponse  Here Larson shows his cartoons that have provoked controversy, even outrage, and he reprints some of the indignant letters of protest. Some of his cartoons are thought to be in bad taste, as one featuring a couple of dogs playing \\"Tethercat.\\" In such cases, he argues that readers either were oversensitive or misunderstood the cartoon. One time, a representative of the Jane Goodall Institute attacked a Far Side cartoon in which two chimpanzees are grooming when one finds a human hair and asks, \\"Conducting a little more 'research' with that Jane Goodall tramp?\\" Larson was ready to apologize to Goodall, until it came out that Goodall loved the cartoon and had no idea someone in her organization had complained. A few of his cartoons were controversial simply because they were hard to understand. A particular example was \\"Cow Tools,\\" which depicts a cow standing by a table on which rest four oddly shaped objects. Larson had found it funny that cows would be really bad at toolmaking. His mistake was making one of the tools resemble a saw, as it led people to believe they had to identify the other tools to understand some kind of deeper meaning. \\"'Off days' are a part of life,\\" he writes, \\"whether you're a cartoonist, a neurosurgeon, or an air- traffic controller.\\" Larson also reprints a letter from an entomologist proposing to name a newly discovered species of chewing lice after Larson, Strigiphilus garylarsoni. The scientist explains that he did this \\"to honor the enormous contribution that my colleagues and I feel you have made to biology through your cartoons.\\" The image of this insect also appears in the form of a geometric design on the inside front and back covers. The next section shows a handful of cartoons that his editors rejected (or, in a few cases, that he never even bothered submitting), usually because they were considered in poor taste. Larson responds to everyone who's taken the trouble to complain, with a large print of a boy making a face.  Part 5: The Exhibit  Larson presents a gallery of his own personal favorite Far Side cartoons. \\"I contemplated making this last section a collection of what I consider the lousiest cartoons I've ever drawn, but space was limited.\\" Category:1989 non- fiction books Category:The Far Side Category:Andrews McMeel Publishing books ","title":"The Prehistory of The Far Side"},{"id":"1867823","text":"New trade theory (NTT) is a collection of economic models in international trade which focuses on the role of increasing returns to scale and network effects, which were developed in the late 1970s and early 1980s. New trade theorists relaxed the assumption of constant returns to scale, and some argue that using protectionist measures to build up a huge industrial base in certain industries will then allow those sectors to dominate the world market. Less quantitative forms of a similar \\"infant industry\\" argument against totally free trade have been advanced by trade theorists since at least 1791 (see: History of free trade).  The theory's impact  The value of protecting \\"infant industries\\" has been defended at least since the 18th century; for example, Alexander Hamilton proposed in 1791 that this be the basis for US trade policy.Alexander Hamilton, REPORT ON MANUFACTURES, Communicated to the House of Representatives, December 5, 1791. www.constitution.org/ah/rpt_manufactures.pdf What was \\"new\\" in new trade theory was the use of mathematical economics to model the increasing returns to scale, and especially the use of the network effect to argue that the formation of important industries was path dependent in a way which industrial planning and judicious tariffs might control. The models developed predicted the national specialization-by-industry observed in the industrial world (movies in Hollywood, watches in Switzerland, etc.). The model also showed how path-dependent industrial concentrations can sometimes lead to monopolistic competition or even situations of oligopoly. Some economists, such as Ha-Joon Chang, had argued that protectionist policies had facilitated the development of the Japanese auto industries in the 1950s, when quotas and regulations prevented import competition. Japanese companies were encouraged to import foreign production technology but were required to produce 90% of parts domestically within five years. Japanese consumers suffered in the short term by being unable to buy superior vehicles produced by the world market, but eventually gained by having a local industry that could out-compete their international rivals.  Econometric testing  The econometric evidence for NTT was mixed, and highly technical. Due to the timescales required, and the particular nature of production in each 'monopolizable' sector, statistical judgements were hard to make. In many ways, the available data have been too limited to produce a reliable test of the hypothesis, which doesn't require arbitrary judgements from the researchers. Japan is cited as evidence of the benefits of \\"intelligent\\" protectionism, but critics of NTT have argued that the empirical support post-war Japan offers for beneficial protectionism is unusual, and that the NTT argument is based on a selective sample of historical cases. Although many examples (like Japanese cars) can be cited where a 'protected' industry subsequently grew to world status, regressions on the outcomes of such \\"industrial policies\\" (which include failures) have been less conclusive; some findings suggest that sectors targeted by Japanese industrial policy had decreasing returns to scale and did not experience productivity gains.  History of the theory's development  The theory was initially associated with Paul Krugman in the late 1970s; Krugman claims that he heard about monopolistic competition from Robert Solow. Looking back in 1996 Krugman wrote that International economics a generation earlier had completely ignored returns to scale. \\"The idea that trade might reflect an overlay of increasing-returns specialization on comparative advantage was not there at all: instead, the ruling idea was that increasing returns would simply alter the pattern of comparative advantage.\\" In 1976, however, MIT- trained economist Victor Norman had worked out the central elements of what came to be known as the Helpman‚ÄìKrugman theory. He wrote it up and showed it to Avinash Dixit. However, they both agreed the results were not very significant. Indeed, Norman never had the paper typed up, much less published. Norman's formal stake in the race comes from the final chapters of the famous Dixit‚ÄìNorman book, Theory of International Trade. James Brander, a PhD student at Stanford at the time, was undertaking similarly innovative work using models from industrial organisation theory‚Äîcross-hauling‚Äîto explain two-way trade in similar products.  \\"New\\" new trade theory  Marc Melitz and Pol Antr√†s started a new trend in the study of international trade. While new trade theory put emphasis on the growing trend of intermediate goods, this new trend emphasizes firm level differences in the same industry of the same country and this new trend is frequently called 'new' new trade theory (NNTT). NNTT stresses the importance of firms rather than sectors in understanding the challenges and the opportunities countries face in the age of globalization. As international trade is increasingly liberalized, industries of comparative advantage are expected to expand, while those of comparative disadvantage are expected to shrink, leading to an uneven spatial distribution of the corresponding economic activities. Within the very same industry, some firms are not able to cope with international competition while others thrive. The resulting intra-industry reallocations of market shares and productive resources are much more pronounced than inter-industry reallocations driven by comparative advantage. Trade in intermediate products A new conspicuous phenomenon in the recent world trade is the rise of trade of in intermediate goods and services. A study of OECD Miroudot, S., R. Lanz and A. Ragoussis (2009), ‚ÄúTrade in Intermediate Goods and Services‚Äù, OECD Trade Policy Working Papers, No. 93, OECD Publishing. doi: 10.1787/5kmlcxtdlk8r-en has found that \\"intermediate inputs represent 56% of goods trade and 73% of services trade.\\" This is a result of fragmentation of production and the increasing importance of outsourcing, which were in turn a result of rapid decrease of trade costs (including transportation costs, transaction costs and tariffs) and revolutionary development of information and communications technologies. Trade in intermediate products are related to many phenomena such as offshoring, vertical specialization, global sourcing, the Second Unbundling,Richard Baldwin (2006) Globalization: the great unbundling(s). http://repository.graduateinstitute.ch/record/295612/files/Baldwin_06-09-20.pdf trade in value added, trade in tasks, global supply chains, global value chains, global optimal procurement. In short it is one of motive powers of internationalization and globalization. Traditional trade theories including Heckscher-Ohlin-Samuelson theory and the New trade theory √† la Krugman exclude trade of intermediates products by assumptionG. Grossman and E.

Fragmentation was first studied by Ronald Jones and Henryk Kierzowski (1990).Jones, R.W. and H. Kierzkowski (1990), The Role of Services in Production and International Trade: A theoretical framework. In R.W. Jones and A.O. Krueger (eds.)

Kierzkowski (2001), A Framework for Fragmentation. In S.W. Arndt and H. Kierzkowski (eds.) Fragmentation, New Production Patterns in the World Economy. Oxford, Oxford University Press. They explained the fragmentation by the decrease of service link costs. Yoshinori Shiozawa (2017, Section 13) presented a new explanation by the decrease of trade costs.Shiozawa, Y. (2017) The new theory of international values: an overview. In Shiozawa, Oka and Tabuchi (eds.) A New Cosntruction of Ricardian Theory of International Values. Singapore: Springer. The service link explains how fragmentation occurs but does not explain how a pattern of specialization emerges. Trade cost explanation is naturally incorporated in Shiozawa's theory of international trade and can be used in the account of global value chain emergence, because it is a general framework which permits trade of intermediate goods and services.Escaith, H. and S. Miroudot (2016) Industry-level competitiveness and Inefficiency spillovers in global value chains, paper presented at the 24th International Input-Output Conference 4‚Äì8 July 2016, Seoul, Korea. https://www.iioa.org/conferences/24th/papers/files/2437_20160523071_HESMTiVAandSupplySideSeoul2016finaldraft.pdf  Theoretical foundations  New trade theory and \\"new\\" new trade theory (NNTT) need their own trade theory. New trade theories are often based on assumptions such as monopolistic competition and increasing returns to scale. One of the typical explanations, given by Paul Krugman, depends on the assumption that all firms are symmetrical, meaning that they all have the same production coefficients. This is too strict as an assumption and deprived general applicability of Krugman's explanation. Shiozawa, based on much more general model, succeeded in giving a new explanation on why the traded volume increases for intermediates goods when the transport cost decreases. \\"New\\" new trade theory (NNTT) also needs new theoretical foundation. Melitz and his followers concentrate on empirical aspects and pay little interest on theoretical aspects of NNTT. Shiozawa's new construction, or Ricardo-Sraffa trade theory, enables Ricardian trade theory to include choice of techniques. Thus the theory can treat a situation where there are many firms with different production processes.Shiozawa, Y. (2017) The new theory of interantional values; an overview. Shiozawa, Oka and Tabuchi (Eds.) A New Construction of Ricardian Theory of International Values, Singapore: Springer.

Early life and education Doocy was born in Algona, Iowa, the son of JoAnne (n√©e Sharp) and James Edward Doocy, who worked in sales and construction. His paternal grandfather was of Irish descent and his maternal grandmother was of Swedish descent. He was raised in Abilene, Kansas, and attended Kansas grade schools in Russell, Salina, and Industry. Doocy went to junior high in Wakefield and high school in Clay Center, Kansas. He graduated from the University of Kansas, in Lawrence, with a BS in Journalism. He was the first on-air DJ for KJHK radio, the student-operated radio station at 90.7 FM in Lawrence. Career Early in his career, Doocy anchored the morning newscast on CBS-TV's flagship station, WCBS-TV, in New York City. Previously, he was the co-host of Wake Up America on NBC cable and host of the nationally syndicated program House Party with Steve Doocy, a remake of the 1960s Art Linkletter show, and the host of the syndicated kids' series Not Just News. For six years, Doocy was the Emmy Award-winning features reporter for WRC, in Washington, D.C., and the NBC Television Stations division. His early television posts included news reporter positions in Kansas City, Wichita, Topeka, and Des Moines. He was the live Times Square reporter on Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve on ABC-TV for four ball drops. Doocy joined the Fox News Channel in 1996, and began co-hosting the network's morning show Fox & Friends in 1998. In 2004, he helped launch Fox News Channel's New Year's Eve special, All American New Year, whose hosts have included Bill Hemmer and Megyn Kelly. The Fox & Friends program gained prominence after the presidential election of Donald Trump, who had been a regular on-air contributor to the program for a number of years before the campaign. Once elected, Trump called it, \\"the most honest morning show.\\" During his first year as president, Trump continued to watch and often quoted the program on Twitter. This prompted the New York Times to call Fox & Friends \\"the most powerful TV show in America.\\" Doocy is implicated in Gretchen Carlson's lawsuit against Roger Ailes. The lawsuit alleges: \\"Doocy engaged in a pattern and practice of severe and pervasive sexual harassment of Carlson, including, but not limited to, mocking her during commercial breaks, shunning her off air, refusing to engage with her on air, belittling her contributions to the show, and generally attempting to put her in her place by refusing to accept and treat her as an intelligent and insightful female journalist rather than a blond female prop.\\" According to the complaint, Doocy \\"created a hostile work environment by regularly treating her in a sexist and condescending way, including by putting his hand on her and pulling down her arm to shush her during a live telecast.\\" In 2019, it was revealed that President Donald Trump ranked the loyalty of many reporters, on a scale of 1 to 10. Steve Doocy received a \\"12 out of 10.\\" On September 15, 2020, Doocy made news when he challenged President Trump's announcement of a series of weekly appearances on Fox and Friends. Doocy responded:\\"You may want to do it every week, but Fox is not committed to that. We're going to take it on a case by case basis.\\" Doocy extended an invitation for Joe Biden to appear on the program, offering him equal airtime to Trump. Published works Doocy has written two New York Times bestsellers. The first is about marriage and family life, titled The Mr. and Mrs. Happy Handbook. The second is about fatherhood, titled Tales from the Dad Side. When asked why he wrote the book, he told The 700 Club on TV, \\"I wanted to write that book just to show that dads are out there ‚Äì we don't know exactly what we're doing. We're doing our best and we love our kids. There aren't so many books for guys. It's not like we get a lot of advice from our dads, 'Just hold him still; he'll stop crying.' And, ad lib ‚Äì what I learned early is that while guys like to have plans, you should plan to ad lib. There's a lot of ad libbing in the dad department.\\" Both books are published by William Morrow and Company, a division of HarperCollins.

It was known to have been used in Ancient Egypt, Rome, and Greece.  History  A type of folding chair with a frame like an X viewed from the front or the side originated in medieval Italy. Also known as a Savonarola or Dante chair in Italy, or a Luther chair in Germany, the X-chair was a light and practical form that spread through Renaissance Europe. In England, the Glastonbury chair made an X-shape by crossing the front and back legs, while in Spain X-chairs were inlaid with ivory and metals in the Moorish designs. The use of the name Savonarola chair comes from a nineteenth-century trade term evoking Girolamo Savonarola, which is a folding armchair of the type standardized during the Italian Renaissance. The chair in the illustration consists of a wooden flat-arched back rail carved with a coat-of-arms in low relief and connected to the back of the straight arms of the chair and a seat made of narrowly fitted wooden slats. The wood used in the construction of the chair is the typical walnut, as in other gothic and renaissance furniture.  Design  The woodwork was nearly always completely covered with silk or velvet, and the seat was made up of loose cushions resting on the webbing between the side rails of the frames. The form was revived in the Neo- classical period and features in Thomas Sheraton's Cabinet Directory. It continued through the 19th century as a folding portable chair for use during campaigns or other outdoor pursuits.  Dantesca  Dantesca is a type of chair used during the Italian Renaissance. The arms end in scrolls and continue all the way up to the back support. It is made to look like it can fold, but in reality, it cannot. It always has a leather seat and back support. It also has a boss where the legs intersect.  See also  * Curule seat * Faldstool *List of chairs Bibliography *Design Glossary: Savonarola and Dante Chairs Apartment Therapy, 9 June 2011.

ELICOS stands for English Language Intensive Courses for Overseas Students and is designed for students who need to learn English before commencing formal studies in Australia. The following will provide an overview of English courses and tests, costs and applications as well as where you can study ELICOS across Australia.  English Courses  English language courses vary greatly, depending on where you are studying. You will get a different experience going to small group tuition, secondary school/college, university or a vocational education centre. Think about what stage you are at in life and where you would like to take the next step. Do you need to obtain a high school qualification, would you like to enrol in TAFE or attend university? This will largely influence what English course you undertake.  ELICOS Standards  CRICOS stands for Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students. If an ELICOS provider has met the national standards, then they will be registered with CRICOS, so it is very important to verify this before you sign the dotted line with any education institution. You can confirm the registration on the CRICOS website. On the site, you can see all of the Australian education providers that offer courses to people studying in Australia on student visas (and the courses that are offered). Navigating the site is simple, as you can find relevant information with the course or institution search. The government site also provides information about registration of institutions and courses for overseas students.  English Tests  There are quite a few options for potential students regarding the selection of an English course. This also applies to English tests. The following tests are accepted for Australian Student Visa purposes: IELTS ‚Äì International English Language Testing System test. TOEFL iBT ‚Äì Test of English as a Foreign Language internet-Based test OR TOEFL PBT ‚Äì TOEFL Paper-Based Test (where IELTS is not available). PTE ‚Äì Pearson Test of English. CAE ‚Äì Cambridge English: Advanced test (Certificate in Advanced English), and the OET ‚Äì Occupational English Test for healthcare professionals who want to register and work in an English-speaking environment.  Applying for ELICOS  There are three main ways that you can apply to study ELICOS in Australia. The first is by applying directly to the school. The ELICOS website provides users with a list of all ELICOS English colleges across Australia. Many of these colleges are quality endorsed by NEAS Australia. The second way you can apply is through IE (Australian Education International). Contact your local IE office for further information. Finally, the third way in which you can apply to ELICOS is through a private education agent representing the schools. You can find an agent by contacting the Australian Embassy in the first instance and asking to be connected to an ‚ÄòEducation Agent‚Äô.  Costs of Study  The cost of tuition will vary depending on where you are studying. This can vary from approximately AUD$250 per week up to AUD$350 per week (this involves about 25 hours of tuition in the week of study). If you are attending an ELICOS course of study in a main city such as Sydney or Melbourne, the costs will inevitably be a bit higher than in more rural or smaller communities. Adelaide, Perth and Hobart tend to be less expensive than the mainland cities on the eastern coast of Australia, so if you are concerned about finances (including living expenses) then consider these locations as an alternative. There are at least half a dozen places to study ELICOS in each main city across Australia so make sure you choose wisely, taking all factors into account including cost of living, accommodation, transport, testing requirements and restrictions External links * Category:Schools in Australia Category:Students in Australia ","title":"English Australia"},{"id":"1867840","text":"The 5th Avenue is a candy bar introduced in 1936, consisting of peanut butter crunch layers enrobed in chocolate.

Following World War Two, abbey beers became popular in Belgium and the name \\"dubbel\\" was used by several breweries for commercial purposes. Westmalle's Dubbel was imitated by other breweries across the world, both Trappist and secular, leading to the emergence of a style. Dubbels are now understood to be a fairly strong (6%-8% alcohol by volume) brown ale, with understated bitterness, fairly heavy body, and a pronounced fruitiness and cereal character. Chimay Premi√®re (Red), Koningshoeven/La Trappe Dubbel, and Achel 8 Bruin are notable examples from Trappist breweries. Affligem and Grimbergen are Belgian abbey breweries that produce dubbels. Notable examples from the US include Ommegang's Dubbel and New Belgium's Abbey Ale. Abbey 1856 Dubbel is produced in Argentina. Flavour profile Dubbels are characteristically known for being dark brown in colour with a strong flavour of dark fruit including raisins, prunes, and dates. These flavours and colours are almost entirely resultant from the heavy addition of highly caramelized (or kilned) beet sugar, which ferments completely into alcohol, lightening the body of the finished beer and contributing to its dry finish. The caramelization of the beet sugar is also the major contributor of maillard flavors including chocolatey, caramel, and nutty tones that give the dubbel its wide gamut of flavour complexity. Because of the special strains of ale yeast used in their production, dubbels often carry a mild spice; coriander and black pepper are notable examples in traditional Belgian dubbels.

Eliza A. Jordson, Brooklyn L.I. 1848. Algae or seaweed specimen, pasted on colored construction paper, framed by paper lace doilies. Brooklyn Museum A crocheted doily in use Queen Elizabeth II holds a doily-wrapped posy. Macarons on a paper doily A doily (also doiley, doilie, doyly, doyley) is an ornamental mat, typically made of paper or fabric, and variously used for protecting surfaces or binding flowers, in food service presentation, or as a head covering or clothing ornamentation. It is characterized by openwork, which allows the surface of the underlying object to show through.  Etymology  Doiley was a 17th-century London draper, who made popular \\"a woolen stuff, 'at once cheap and genteel,' introduced for summer wear in the latter part of the 17th c.\\" At the time, it was used as an adjective, as in \\"doily stuffs\\" or \\"doily suit.\\" Later, usage shifted to refer to \\"a small ornamental napkin used at dessert,\\" known as a \\"doily-napkin.\\"  Usage = Furniture protection  In addition to their decorative function doilies have the practical role of protecting fine-wood furniture from the scratches caused by crockery or decorative objects such as nativity scenes, or from spilled tea when used on tea trays or with cups and saucers. When used to protect the backs and arms of chairs, they are serving as antimacassars.  Flower arrangement  Doilies are traditionally used to bind the stems in posies (formal flower arrangements called tussie-mussies in the Victorian Era).  Food service and etiquette  Doilies figure prominently in the custom of finger bowls, once common in formal, multi-course dinners. The linen doily (never paper) separates the dessert plate from the finger bowl. The custom requires that both doily and finger bowl are removed to the upper left of the place setting before briefly dipping fingertips into the water and drying them on the napkin. Failing to move both together is a faux pas. Disposable paper doilies \\"were designed as a cheaper but respectable alternative to crocheted linen doilies\\" and are commonly used to decorate plates, placed under the food for ornamentation.  Techniques  They are crocheted, tatted or knitted out of cotton or linen thread. Many patterns for crocheting or knitting doilies were published by thread manufacturers in the first part of the 20th century. The designers were often anonymous. The designs could be circular or oval starting from the center and working outward, reminiscent of the Polar coordinates system. Doilies, as well as other household items, may be made by crocheting rows on a grid pattern using a technique called filet crochet, similar to points on the Cartesian coordinate system. Contemporary designers continue to make patterns for modern hand craft enthusiasts. Although it may to some extent interfere with the original use, some doilies involve embroidery or have raised designs (rose petals, popcorn, or ruffles) rather than being flat.

The rules might come from legal regulation (\\"An employee can be fired for any reason or no reason but not for an illegal reason\\"), company policy (\\"All customers that spend more than $100 at one time will receive a 10% discount\\"), or other sources. A business rule system enables these company policies and other operational decisions to be defined, tested, executed and maintained separately from application code. Rule engines typically support rules, facts, priority (score), mutual exclusion, preconditions, and other functions. Rule engine software is commonly provided as a component of a business rule management system which, among other functions, provides the ability to: register, define, classify, and manage all the rules, verify consistency of rules definitions (‚ÄùGold-level customers are eligible for free shipping when order quantity > 10‚Äù and ‚Äúmaximum order quantity for Silver-level customers = 15‚Äù ), define the relationships between different rules, and relate some of these rules to IT applications that are affected or need to enforce one or more of the rules. IT use In any IT application, business rules can change more frequently than other parts of the application code. Rules engines or inference engines serve as pluggable software components which execute business rules that a business rules approach has externalized or separated from application code. This externalization or separation allows business users to modify the rules without the need for IT intervention. The system as a whole becomes more easily adaptable with such external business rules, but this does not preclude the usual requirements of QA and other testing.  History An article in Computerworld traces rules engines to the early 1990s and to products from the likes of Pegasystems, Fair Isaac Corp and ILOG. Design strategies Many organizations' rules efforts combine aspects of what is generally considered workflow design with traditional rule design. This failure to separate the two approaches can lead to problems with the ability to re-use and control both business rules and workflows. Design approaches that avoid this quandary separate the role of business rules and workflows as follows:Is Your Rules Engine Event-Driven? Retrieved from http://www.sapiens- tech.com/iDuneDownload.dll?GetFile?AppId=225&FileID;=216581&Anchor;=&ext;=.pdf . * Business rules produce knowledge; * Workflows perform business work. Concretely, that means that a business rule may do things like detect that a business situation has occurred and raise a business event (typically carried via a messaging infrastructure) or create higher level business knowledge (e.g., evaluating the series of organizational, product, and regulatory-based rules concerning whether or not a loan meets underwriting criteria). On the other hand, a workflow would respond to an event that indicated something such as the overloading of a routing point by initiating a series of activities. This separation is important because the same business judgment (mortgage meets underwriting criteria) or business event (router is overloaded) can be reacted to by many different workflows. Embedding the work done in response to rule-driven knowledge creation into the rule itself greatly reduces the ability of business rules to be reused across an organization because it makes them work-flow specific. To create an architecture that employs a business rules engine it is essential to establish the integration between a BPM (Business Process Management) and a BRM (Business Rules Management) platform that is based upon processes responding to events or examining business judgments that are defined by business rules. There are some products in the marketplace that provide this integration natively. In other situations this type of abstraction and integration will have to be developed within a particular project or organization. Most Java-based rules engines provide a technical call-level interface, based on the JSR-94 application programming interface (API) standard, in order to allow for integration with different applications, and many rule engines allow for service-oriented integrations through Web-based standards such as WSDL and SOAP. Most rule engines provide the ability to develop a data abstraction that represents the business entities and relationships that rules should be written against. This business entity model can typically be populated from a variety of sources including XML, POJOs, flat files, etc. There is no standard language for writing the rules themselves. Many engines use a Java-like syntax, while some allow the definition of custom business-friendly languages. Most rules engines function as a callable library. However, it is becoming more popular for them to run as a generic process akin to the way that RDBMSs behave. Most engines treat rules as a configuration to be loaded into their process instance, although some are actually code generators for the whole rule execution instance and others allow the user to choose. Types of rule engines There are a number of different types of rule engines. These types (generally) differ in how Rules are scheduled for execution. Most rules engines used by businesses are forward chaining, which can be further divided into two classes: * The first class processes so-called production/inference rules. These types of rules are used to represent behaviors of the type IF condition THEN action. For example, such a rule could answer the question: \\"Should this customer be allowed a mortgage?\\" by executing rules of the form \\"IF some-condition THEN allow- customer-a-mortgage\\". * The other type of rule engine processes so-called reaction/Event condition action rules. The reactive rule engines detect and react to incoming events and process event patterns. For example, a reactive rule engine could be used to alert a manager when certain items are out of stock. The biggest difference between these types is that production rule engines execute when a user or application invokes them, usually in a stateless manner. A reactive rule engine reacts automatically when events occur, usually in a stateful manner. Many (and indeed most) popular commercial rule engines have both production and reaction rule capabilities, although they might emphasize one class over another. For example, most business rules engines are primarily production rules engines, whereas complex event processing rules engines emphasize reaction rules. In addition, some rules engines support backward chaining. In this case a rules engine seeks to resolve the facts to fit a particular goal. It is often referred to as being goal driven because it tries to determine if something exists based on existing information. Another kind of rule engine automatically switches between back- and forward-chaining several times during a reasoning run, e.g. the Internet Business Logic system, which can be found by searching the web. A fourth class of rules engine might be called a deterministic engine. These rules engines may forgo both forward chaining and backward chaining, and instead utilize domain-specific language approaches to better describe policy. This approach is often easier to implement and maintain, and provides performance advantages over forward or backward chaining systems. There are some circumstance where Fuzzy Logic based inference may be more appropriate, where heuristics are used in rule processing, rather than Boolean rules. Examples might include customer classification, missing data inference, customer value calculations, etc. The DARL languagehttps://darl.ai/home/darl and the associated inference engine and editors is an example of this approach. Rules engines for access control / authorization One common use case for rules engines is standardized access control to applications. OASIS defines a rules engine architecture and standard dedicated to access control called XACML (eXtensible Access Control Markup Language). One key difference between a XACML rule engine and a business rule engine is the fact that a XACML rule engine is stateless and cannot change the state of any data. The XACML rule engine, called a Policy Decision Point (PDP), expects a binary Yes/No question e.g. \\"Can Alice view document D?\\" and returns a decision e.g. Permit / deny.

It ran from 1994 to 1999. Billed as \\"Newfoundland's Cultural Magazine\\", The Great Eastern was an hour-long summer replacement show on CBC Radio One for the first two seasons, and then became a half-hour regular show for the next three seasons. Purportedly a culture, arts and entertainment show on the Broadcasting Corporation of Newfoundland (BCN), The Great Eastern was in fact a satirical and parodic comedy which developed an extensive fictional universe of characters and Newfoundland institutions. Content and Style The Great Eastern purported to be a long-running show on the BCN of which hour-long and half-hour-long segments were broadcast on Radio One (and, through atmospheric anomalies, to Iceland). It was named, both in real life and in fiction, after the ill-fated 19th-century steamship bearing the same name.Dragland, Stan (2016), Strangers & Others: The Great Eastern, pp. 153-54. Pedlar Press, St. John's. . Although content varied from episode to episode, most started with theme music, moved to a hearty introduction and hello from host Paul Moth, a visit to BCN director Ish Lundrigan and the BCN vault for \\"archival\\" radio content, the \\"What's that noise from Newfoundland\\" contest, and then to the meat of the show, which might involve anything from discussions of the religion/get-rich-quick scheme Economology to Newfoundland Christmas radio plays. Interspersed in most episodes were \\"community announcements\\" and promotional material for other BCN shows which further established the world of The Great Eastern. A central conceit of The Great Eastern was that its characters never broke the fourth wall to suggest that the show, despite its outlandish content, was anything other than real. Its creators actively resisted the CBC's attempts to market it to listeners as a comedy. In 1996, co-creator Mack Furlong wrote to the CBC to protest this practice: \\"Part of whatever charm The Great Eastern possesses is gained in no small way by the fact that we purport that the show is real, that it is actually, Nfld's Cultural Magazine. The straighter CBC plays this line, the funnier the concept is.... Every good joke needs a straight set up.\\"Furlong, Mack, letter to Victoria Wilcox, 1996-10-07, quoted in Dragland (2016), p. 36.

The South Lodge and the gates to Somerleyton Hall are listed Grade II. History Somerleyton Hall entrance In 1240 a manor house was built on the site of Somerleyton Hall by Sir Peter Fitzosbert, whose daughter married into the Jernegan family. The male line of the Fitzosberts ended, and the Jernegans held the estate until 1604. In 1604 John Wentworth bought the estate. He transformed Somerleyton Hall into a typical East Anglian Tudor-Jacobean mansion. It then passed to the Garney family. The next owner was Admiral Sir Thomas Allin, a native of Lowestoft. He took part in the Battle of Lowestoft (1665) and the Battle of Solebay at Southwold in 1672. Eventually, the male line of that family also died out. In 1843 Somerleyton Hall and Park were bought by the prosperous entrepreneur and MP Samuel Morton Peto. For the next seven years he carried out extensive rebuilding, creating an Anglo-Italian architecture masterpiece. Paintings were specially commissioned for the house, and the gardens and grounds were completely redesigned. Peto employed Prince Albert's architect John Thomas; the clock tower houses a clock designed by Benjamin Vulliamy. Peto had garden features designed by William Andrews Nesfield and Joseph Paxton. Peto's son, Harold Peto, became a noted garden- designer, but it is not known whether he was influenced by the gardens of Somerlyton. Somerleyton Hall in 1880. The Winter Garden (conservatory) on the left was demolished in 1914 In 1863 the Somerleyton estate was sold to Sir Francis Crossley of Halifax, West Yorkshire, a carpet manufacturer, who, like Peto, was a philanthropist and a Member of Parliament. Sir Francis' son Savile was created Baron Somerleyton in 1916. The lake at Somerleyton Hall was used by Christopher Cockerell, the inventor of the hovercraft, to carry out his early experiments. The house is now held by Hugh Crossley, 4th Baron Somerleyton and inhabited by the family. The family motto is 'Everything that is good comes from above'. In 1998 Lord and Lady Somerleyton commissioned the English artist Jonathan Myles-Lea, a specialist in country houses, gardens and estates, to paint Somerleyton Hall. In popular culture The house and its grounds featured as the principal location in \\"Neck\\", the sixth episode in the first series of Tales of the Unexpected (1976), and in episode 2 of the 1989 UK TV series, Interceptor. The house and grounds feature prominently in W. G. Sebald's 1995 novel The Rings of Saturn. The house and grounds were used to stand in for Sandringham House in Stephen Poliakoff's 2003 television drama The Lost Prince.

He established a small, 15-barrel brewery, and began brewing a beer modeled after a Belgian Wit beer, named Allagash White.Our Story, Allagash Brewing Company The beer gets its flavor from the use of wheat in place of barley, as well as the addition of Cura√ßao orange peel, coriander, and other spices. All of the beers Allagash produces are bottle conditioned. The technique calls for two fermentations, the first in the fermenting tanks and the second in the bottle itself (a process known as the methode champenoise). A coolship is used to cool the wort for some of the beers. Before the beer is bottled, a small amount of yeast and sugar is added and a second fermentation occurs. It is this second fermentation which produces a notable increase in carbonation, a softer feel and remarkable complexity. This method of bottle conditioning leaves a small amount of yeast in the bottle.

Certified wood and paper products come from responsibly managed forests ‚Äì as defined by a particular standard. With third-party forest certification, an independent organization develops standards of good forest management, and independent auditors issue certificates to forest operations that comply with those standards. Requirements Forest certification programs typically require that forest management practices conform to existing laws. Other basic requirements or characteristics of forest certification programs include: Basic requirements of credible forest certification programs include: * Protection of biodiversity, species at risk and wildlife habitat; sustainable harvest levels; protection of water quality; and prompt regeneration (e.g., replanting and reforestation). * Third-party certification audits performed by accredited certification bodies. * Publicly available certification audit summaries. * Multi-stakeholder involvement in a standards development process. * Complaints and appeals process. Programs Today there are more than 50 certification programs worldwide Third-Party Forest Certification in British Columbia addressing the many types of forests and tenures around the world. The two largest international forest certification programs are the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) and the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC). The PEFC is the largest certification framework in terms of forest area, with approximately two-thirds of the total certified area. The FSC program is the fastest growing.UNECE/FAO 2009-2010 Forest Products Annual Market Review page 115 Third-party forest certification was pioneered in the early 1990s by the FSC, a collaboration between environmental NGOs, forest product companies and social interests. Competing systems quickly emerged throughout the world. Some commentators, including Jared Diamond, have suggested that many competing standards were set up by logging companies specifically aiming to confuse consumers with less rigorously enforced but similarly named competing standards.  United States and Canada  In the United States and Canada, there are a number of forest certification programs. Three of these programs are endorsed by the PEFC. They are the American Tree Farm System (ATFS), the Canadian Standards Association's Sustainable Forest Management StandardCSA International Forest Products Marking and the Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI) Program. ATFS is applicable only in the United States; the Canadian Standards Association SFM Standard is applicable only in Canada. SFI is applicable to both the United States and Canada. The FSC,Forest Stewardship Council CanadaFSC United States program is applied throughout North America. SFI is the world's largest regional forest certification program in terms of total certified forest area[1]. The National Association of State Foresters in the USA passed a resolution in 2008 that supports all of the forest certification systems used in the USA and recognized the value of their differences: \\"... the ATFS, FSC, and SFI systems include the fundamental elements of credibility and make positive contributions to forest sustainability.... No certification program can credibly claim to be ‚Äòbest‚Äô, and no certification program that promotes itself as the only certification option can maintain credibility. Forest ecosystems are complex and a simplistic ‚Äòone size fits all‚Äô approach to certification cannot address all sustainability needs.\\". The Canadian Council of Forest Ministers issued a statement in 2008 on forest certification standards in Canada, which said: \\"In Canada, each jurisdiction's forest laws, policies and administrative requirements comprise an framework that fully characterizes what sustainable forest management (SFM) means in that jurisdiction, and what actions may take place on public and/or private forest land. Governments in Canada support third-party forest certification as a tool to demonstrate the rigor of Canada's forest management laws, and to document the country's world- class sustainable forest management record. The forest management standards of the Canadian Standards Association (CSA), the FSC and the Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI) are all used in Canada. Governments in Canada accept that these standards demonstrate, and promote the sustainability of forest management practices in Canada.\\" Canadian Council of Forest Ministers Statement on Forest Certification Standards in Canada Chain-of-custody certification Chain of Custody certification tracks the certified material through the production process ‚Äì from the forest to the consumer, including all successive stages of processing, transformation, manufacturing and distribution. It also provides evidence that certified material in a certified product originates from certified forests. The United Nations reports that between January 2009 and May 2010, the total number of PEFC and FSC chain-of- custody certificates issued worldwide increased by 88% for a total of 23,717 certificates (this does not include SFI certificates).UNECE/FAO 2009-2010 Forest Products Annual Market Review page 118 Future expansion Forest certification is a voluntary process. About 10% of the world's forest under at least one certification program.UNECE/FAO 2009-2010 Forest Products Annual Market Review page 113 Customers that choose to buy certified products are supporting land managers, land owners and forest product companies that have made a commitment to meeting the standards of forest certification. Third- party forest certification is a useful tool for those seeking to purchase paper and wood products that come from forests that are well-managed and use materials that are legally harvested. Incorporating third-party certification into forest product buying practices can be a centerpiece for responsible wood and paper purchasing policies that include factors such as the protection of sensitive forest values, thoughtful material selection and efficient use of products. The 2009-2010 United Nations Market Review reported that companies that produced or traded in certified forest products often had a market advantage during the 2008-2009 recession because, in a buyers‚Äô market, buyers could be more selective in choosing their sources of supply. The report cites four demand drivers for certification:UNECE/FAO 2009-2010 Forest Products Annual Market Review page 114 * Paper, publishing, printing and packaging ‚Äì commitments to increase the use of responsible paper sources by large publishers such as Time Inc. has probably been the most significant factor driving growth in forest and chain-of-custody certification. * Green public procurement ‚Äì governments such as the UK and the Netherlands have adopted green timber procurement policies, including recognition of FSC and PEFC endorsed programs. An example is the UK's Central Point of Expertise on Timber (set up by the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and operated by ProForest). *Green building ‚Äì standards for green building incentivize and reward the use of certified wood products. *Illegal logging ‚Äì new legislation designed to minimize the risk of illegal wood entering supply chains such as the amended Lacey Act in the United States has created a strong incentive to demand independently certified wood that can address illegal logging concerns. The World Resources Institute, in partnership with the Environmental Investigation Agency, released a fact sheet designed to answer some of the frequently asked questions about the Lacey Act, which was amended in 2008 to ban commerce in illegally sourced plants and their products‚Äîincluding timber, wood, and paper products. The fact sheet says forest certification is a very good approach for demonstrating due care by showing government and customers that a company has taken proactive steps to eliminate illegal wood or plant material from its supply chain. Certification does not relieve importers of the requirement to submit appropriate import declaration information to U.S. government agencies.World Resources Institute fact sheet Are You Ready for the Lacey Act?

The wavelengths may be separated by filters or detected via the use of instruments that are sensitive to particular wavelengths, including light from frequencies beyond the visible light range, i.e. infrared and ultra-violet. Spectral imaging can allow extraction of additional information the human eye fails to capture with its visible receptors for red, green and blue. It was originally developed for military target identification and reconnaissance. Early space-based imaging platforms incorporated multispectral imaging technologyR.A. Schowengerdt. Remote sensing: Models and methods for image processing, Academic Press, 3rd ed., (2007) to map details of the Earth related to coastal boundaries, vegetation, and landforms. Multispectral imaging has also found use in document and painting analysis.4 Multispectral imaging measures light in a small number (typically 3 to 15) of spectral bands. Hyperspectral imaging is a special case of spectral imaging where often hundreds of contiguous spectral bands are available.  Applications = Military target tracking  Multispectral imaging measures light emission and is often used in detecting or tracking military targets. In 2003, researchers at the United States Army Research Laboratory and the Federal Laboratory Collaborative Technology Alliance reported a dual band multispectral imaging focal plane array (FPA). This FPA allowed researchers to look at two infrared (IR) planes at the same time.Goldberg, A.; Stann, B.; Gupta, N. (July 2003). \\"Multispectral, Hyperspectral, and Three-Dimensional Imaging Research at the U.S. Army Research Laboratory\\" (PDF). Proceedings of the International Conference on International Fusion [6th]. 1: 499‚Äì506. Because mid-wave infrared (MWIR) and long wave infrared (LWIR) technologies measure radiation inherent to the object and require no external light source, they also are referred to as thermal imaging methods. The brightness of the image produced by a thermal imager depends on the objects emissivity and temperature. Every material has an infrared signature that aids in the identification of the object. These signatures are less pronounced in hyperspectral systems (which image in many more bands than multispectral systems) and when exposed to wind and, more dramatically, to rain. Sometimes the surface of the target may reflect infrared energy. This reflection may misconstrue the true reading of the objects‚Äô inherent radiation. Imaging systems that use MWIR technology function better with solar reflections on the target's surface and produce more definitive images of hot objects, such as engines, compared to LWIR technology. However, LWIR operates better in hazy environments like smoke or fog because less scattering occurs in the longer wavelengths. Researchers claim that dual-band technologies combine these advantages to provide more information from an image, particularly in the realm of target tracking. For nighttime target detection, thermal imaging outperformed single-band multispectral imaging. Citation. Dual band MWIR and LWIR technology resulted in better visualization during the nighttime than MWIR alone. Citation Citation. The US Army reports that its dual band LWIR/MWIR FPA demonstrated better visualizing of tactical vehicles than MWIR alone after tracking them through both day and night. = Land mine detection = By analyzing the emissivity of ground surfaces, multispectral imaging can detect the presence of underground missiles. Surface and sub-surface soil possess different physical and chemical properties that appear in spectral analysis. Disturbed soil has increased emissivity in the wavelength range of 8.5 to 9.5 micrometers while demonstrating no change in wavelengths greater than 10 micrometers. The US Army Research Laboratory's dual MWIR/LWIR FPA used \\"red\\" and \\"blue\\" detectors to search for areas with enhanced emissivity. The red detector acts as a backdrop, verifying realms of undisturbed soil areas, as it is sensitive to the 10.4 micrometer wavelength. The blue detector is sensitive to wavelengths of 9.3 micrometers. If the intensity of the blue image changes when scanning, that region is likely disturbed. The scientists reported that fusing these two images increased detection capabilities. = Ballistic missile detection = Intercepting an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) in its boost phase requires imaging of the hard body as well as the rocket plumes. MWIR presents a strong signal from highly heated objects including rocket plumes, while LWIR produces emissions from the missile's body material. The US Army Research Laboratory reported that with their dual-band MWIR/LWIR technology, tracking of the Atlas 5 Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicles, similar in design to ICBMs, picked up both the missile body and plumage.  Space-based imaging  Most radiometers for remote sensing (RS) acquire multispectral images. Dividing the spectrum into many bands, multispectral is the opposite of panchromatic, which records only the total intensity of radiation falling on each pixel. Usually, Earth observation satellites have three or more radiometers. Each acquires one digital image (in remote sensing, called a 'scene') in a small spectral band. The bands are grouped into wavelength regions based on the origin of the light and the interests of the researchers.  Weather Forecasting  Modern weather satellites produce imagery in a variety of spectra. https://doi.org/10.1175/1520-0450(2001)040<2115:REFACO>2.0.CO;2 In the case of Landsat satellites, several different band designations have been used, with as many as 11 bands (Landsat 8) comprising a multispectral image. Spectral imaging with a higher radiometric resolution (involving hundreds or thousands of bands), finer spectral resolution (involving smaller bands), or wider spectral coverage may be called hyperspectral or ultraspectral.  Documents and artworks  The technology has also assisted in the interpretation of ancient papyri, such as those found at Herculaneum, by imaging the fragments in the infrared range (1000 nm). Often, the text on the documents appears to the naked eye as black ink on black paper. At 1000 nm, the difference in how paper and ink reflect infrared light makes the text clearly readable. It has also been used to image the Archimedes palimpsest by imaging the parchment leaves in bandwidths from 365‚Äì870 nm, and then using advanced digital image processing techniques to reveal the undertext with Archimedes' work. Multispectral imaging has been used in a Mellon Foundation project at Yale University to compare inks in medieval English manuscripts.Weiskott, Eric. \\"Multispectral Imaging and Medieval Manuscripts.\\" In The Routledge research companion to digital medieval literature. Boyle, Jennifer E., and Helen J. Burgess. London: Routledge. Pp. 186‚Äì96. Multispectral imaging can be employed for investigation of paintings and other works of art.. Baronti, A. Casini, F. Lotti, and S. Porcinai, Multispectral imaging system for the mapping of pigments in works of art by use of principal-component analysis, Applied Optics Vol. 37, Issue 8, pp. 1299‚Äì1309 (1998) The painting is irradiated by ultraviolet, visible and infrared rays and the reflected radiation is recorded in a camera sensitive in this regions of the spectrum. The image can also be registered using the transmitted instead of reflected radiation. In special cases the painting can be irradiated by UV, VIS or IR rays and the fluorescence of pigments or varnishes can be registered.Multispectral imaging at ColourLex Multispectral imaging has also been used to examine discolorations and stains on old books and manuscripts. Comparing the \\"spectral fingerprint\\" of a stain to the characteristics of known chemical substances can make it possible to identify the stain. This technique has been used to examine medical and alchemical texts, seeking hints about the activities of early chemists and the possible chemical substances they may have used in their experiments. Like a cook spilling flour or vinegar on a cookbook, an early chemist might have left tangible evidence on the pages of the ingredients used to make medicines. Spectral bands The wavelengths are approximate; exact values depend on the particular satellite's instruments: * Blue, 450‚Äì515..520 nm, is used for atmosphere and deep water imaging, and can reach depths up to in clear water. * Green, 515..520‚Äì590..600 nm, is used for imaging vegetation and deep water structures, up to in clear water. * Red, 600..630‚Äì680..690 nm, is used for imaging man-made objects, in water up to deep, soil, and vegetation. * Near infrared (NIR), 750‚Äì900 nm, is used primarily for imaging vegetation. * Mid-infrared (MIR), 1550‚Äì1750 nm, is used for imaging vegetation, soil moisture content, and some forest fires. * Far- infrared (FIR), 2080‚Äì2350 nm, is used for imaging soil, moisture, geological features, silicates, clays, and fires. * Thermal infrared, 10400-12500 nm, uses emitted instead of reflected radiation to image geological structures, thermal differences in water currents, fires, and for night studies. * Radar and related technologies are useful for mapping terrain and for detecting various objects. Spectral band usage For different purposes, different combinations of spectral bands can be used. They are usually represented with red, green, and blue channels. Mapping of bands to colors depends on the purpose of the image and the personal preferences of the analysts. Thermal infrared is often omitted from consideration due to poor spatial resolution, except for special purposes. * True-color uses only red, green, and blue channels, mapped to their respective colors. As a plain color photograph, it is good for analyzing man-made objects, and is easy to understand for beginner analysts. * Green-red-infrared, where the blue channel is replaced with near infrared, is used for vegetation, which is highly reflective in near IR; it then shows as blue. This combination is often used to detect vegetation and camouflage. * Blue-NIR-MIR, where the blue channel uses visible blue, green uses NIR (so vegetation stays green), and MIR is shown as red. Such images allow the water depth, vegetation coverage, soil moisture content, and the presence of fires to be seen, all in a single image. Many other combinations are in use. NIR is often shown as red, causing vegetation-covered areas to appear red.  Classification  Unlike other Aerial photographic and satellite image interpretation work, these multispectral images do not make it easy to identify directly the feature type by visual inspection. Hence the remote sensing data has to be classified first, followed by processing by various data enhancement techniques so as to help the user to understand the features that are present in the image. Such classification is a complex task which involves rigorous validation of the training samples depending on the classification algorithm used. The techniques can be grouped mainly into two types. * Supervised classification techniques * Unsupervised classification techniques Supervised classification makes use of training samples. Training samples are areas on the ground for which there is Ground truth, that is, what is there is known. The spectral signatures of the training areas are used to search for similar signatures in the remaining pixels of the image, and we will classify accordingly. This use of training samples for classification is called supervised classification. Expert knowledge is very important in this method since the selection of the training samples and a biased selection can badly affect the accuracy of classification. Popular techniques include the Maximum likelihood principle and Convolutional neural network. The Maximum likelihood principle calculates the probability of a pixel belonging to a class (i.e. feature) and allots the pixel to its most probable class. Newer Convolutional neural network based methods account for both spatial proximity and entire spectra to determine the most likely class. In case of unsupervised classification no prior knowledge is required for classifying the features of the image. The natural clustering or grouping of the pixel values, i.e. the gray levels of the pixels, are observed. Then a threshold is defined for adopting the number of classes in the image. The finer the threshold value, the more classes there will be. However, beyond a certain limit the same class will be represented in different classes in the sense that variation in the class is represented. After forming the clusters, ground truth validation is done to identify the class the image pixel belongs to. Thus in this unsupervised classification apriori information about the classes is not required. One of the popular methods in unsupervised classification is k-means clustering.

Biography Josef Nesvadba was born in Prague, Czechoslovakia on 19 June 1926. In 1950, he graduated with a degree in medicine, specializing in psychiatry. He was a pioneer of group psychotherapy in Czechoslovakia and was a professor of psychiatry at the Charles University. Nesvadba originally translated poetry from English and wrote several theatrical plays as a student in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Towards the end of the 1950s, he began writing science fiction short stories. Befitting his background, psychiatry was often a theme in his science fiction. His stories typically revolved around such issues as human weakness and divided personalities, with a tendency toward dark humor, irony and satire, as in \\"Vampires, Ltd.\\", in which a car runs on blood. In the 1970s, he began to move away from science fiction, which was likely inevitable, as his main interests diverged somewhat from Western views of the genre. From a commercial perspective, this did not work well. Some of his stories were made into movies, including Death of Tarzan, The Half-wit of Xeenemunde, Vampires, Ltd. and Tomorrow I'll Wake Up and Scald Myself with Tea. In the last of these, which he himself scripted, Hitler and issues of causality cropped up. He also worked on several TV and radio serials. Nesvadba's work directed satirical barbs at the communist government of Czechoslovakia, as he had little faith in the grandiose dreams of 20th century Communism. However, he agreed overall with Marxist analysis, a viewpoint he maintained even after the unraveling of Communist rule in Czechoslovakia.Neff, Ondrej. \\"Na n√°v≈°tƒõvƒõ u Josefa Nesvadby\\" ‚Äì Interview with Josef Nesvadba.

The game stars a 3D Pac-Man as the user rolls him throughout the playing field using the touchscreen. The classic arcade Pac-Man game is also unlockable. It was later released for the Wii on the Namco Museum Remix and Namco Museum Megamix compilation games.  Plot  Once when Pac-Man was still young, he spent a summer at the home of the great Pac-Master for training to fight the ghosts in Pac-Land. During Pac-Man's training, Pac-Master's family went to the Power Pellet Harvest Festival with Pac-Man. The Ghosts (possibly young too) decided to summon the legendary ghost, Golvis. He was said to be so strong that he was sent to space by the ghosts themselves. Castle Pac were celebrating the large crop of power pellets gathered, when the Harvest Festival was suddenly disturbed by a UFO from which Golvis comes. In an attempt to save the Pacs, Pac-Master chomped on a power pellet. But while the other ghosts turned blue, Golvis remained his normal colour with only the end of his tail blue. Golvis and his alive guitar sidekick (named Jack) turned the Pac-People into spheres (they are the same just without arms or legs), and kidnaps them all. With the help of Pac-Land's guardian fairy, Krystal, Pac-Man managed to escape before getting kidnapped. This explains why Golvis' guitar is always out of tune because he was using it to smash Pac-Man into the ground. Now with the help of Krystal, Pac-Man (who has been put on Golvis' sphere curse) must save Pac- Master's family from the evil Golvis and Ghosts, with their evil plot to turn Pac-Land into Ghost-Land. Characters=Main characters *Pac-Man - Pac- Man is a young traveler and the main protagonist. He spends his time with Pac- Master and his family during summer vacation. One night, he was turned into a ball by Golvis' power. *Krystal - Krystal is a fairy who saved Pac-Man before he got kidnapped. She is usually seen giving hints to Pac-Man throughout his adventure. *Golvis - Golvis is a ghost created by the young ghosts and the game's main antagonist. He is seen as a punk-rocker and he usually carries a guitar around with him. Unlike the ghosts Pac-Man fights, he takes three Power Pellets to eat him. When defeated, he has a tendency of yelling; \\"I'LL GET YOU NEXT TIME! JUST YOU WAIT AND SEE!\\" *Jack - Jack is Golvis' guitar that is usually quiet. He assists Golvis in defeating Pac-Man. Recurring characters *Pac-Master - Pac-Master is the father of the Pac-Master family and Pac-Man's mentor. *Pac-Master's Wife - She is the wife of Pac-Master and is usually seen wearing a pink hat. *Pac-Baby - She is Pac-Master's daughter.

Also known to the Kriegsmarine as Schiff 10; to the Royal Navy she was Raider E. She was named after the Germanic deity Thor. Early history Formerly the cargo ship Santa Cruz, she was built by Deutsche Werft, Hamburg, (DWH) in 1938, and was owned and operated by the Oldenburg Portuguese Line (OPDR), Hamburg. In the winter of 1939‚Äì40 the navy requisitioned her and had her converted into an auxiliary warship by DWH. She was commissioned as the commerce raider Thor in March 1940. First cruise The Thor began its first combat cruise on 6 June 1940, under the command of Captain Otto K√§hler. Thor spent 329 days at sea, and sank or captured 12 ships with a combined tonnage of . Thor stopped her first victim on 1 July, the 9290-ton Dutch cargo ship Kertosono, which was carrying a cargo of petrol, timber, asphalt, and agricultural machinery. K√§hler decided to send her under a prize crew to Lorient, France, where she arrived safely 12 days later. At the time, Thor was disguised as a Yugoslavian freighter. On 7 July Thor encountered Delambre, a British freighter. Thor fired several broadsides, the third of which hit Delambre, stopping her dead in the water, after which Thors boarding party scuttled the ship with demolition charges. Two days later Thor intercepted the Belgian freighter Bruges, which was carrying a cargo of wheat. Bruges was scuttled, and her crew of 44 was taken aboard Thor. On the 14th, Thor stopped another freighter carrying wheat, the British Gracefield, and sank her by demolition charges. On 16 July Thor attacked the British freighter Wendover without warning, as Wendover was seen to be armed. Wendover was hit by several shells from Thor and set on fire. A boarding party set demolition charges which caused Wendover to capsize, and she was then sunk by gunfire. 36 of the Wendover's crew of 40 survived: two crew including the radio operator were killed in the attack; two more were wounded and died of their injuries while aboard Thor. The Dutch freighter Tela, en route to the UK, was intercepted on 17 July. Thor fired a shot across her bow; she stopped without sending distress signals. The crew of 33 abandoned ship and were taken aboard Thor, and Tela was sunk by demolition charges. On 28 July, Thor encountered the British armed merchant cruiser HMS Alcantara, which was armed with eight six-inch (150 mm) main guns. K√§hler turned away from Alcantara and tried to outrun her for three hours until he realized Alcantara was faster than Thor. At that point K√§hler decided to turn and fight, hoping to inflict enough damage on Alcantara to allow Thor to escape. Thor scored three early hits on Alcantara: one between her bridge and funnel, a second aft, and a third on her waterline that caused flooding in her engine room, forcing Alcantara to reduce speed. Thor turned away from Alcantara and received two hits from her six-inch guns, killing three crew members. Instead of risking further combat, Thor made her escape under cover of a dense smokescreen. After the battle with Alcantara, Thor repaired her battle damage, cleaned her boilers and changed her disguise. Thor rendezvoused with the supply ship Rekum on 25 August and then returned to Brazilian waters. Two weeks later, on Sept 8, the Yugoslav Federico Glavic was stopped, but allowed to proceed unmolested, as Yugoslavia was neutral at the time. On 26 September Thors float plane discovered the Norwegian whale-oil tanker Kosmos, which was carrying over 17,000 tons of whale oil. The Kosmos would have been a highly valuable prize ship, but the fact that she was short of fuel, slow, and easily recognizable made keeping her as a prize unfeasible. K√§hler ordered Kosmos to be sunk by gunfire. On 8 October Thor caught the 8,715 ton British refrigeration ship Natia. Thor scored a direct hit, which stopped Natia dead in the water, though she continued wireless transmissions. Thor hit Natia seven or eight more times with gunfire, and a torpedo that tore open her side. Another 35 rounds were fired before she sank. 84 of Natia's 85 crew were taken aboard Thor, bringing her total to 368. Most of these prisoners were transferred to the supply ship Rio Grande in mid November. On 5 December Thor encountered another armed merchant cruiser, , a 20,062 ton ship armed with eight and two three-inch anti-aircraft guns. Thor carried three of her four guns aft, so K√§hler decided to force Carnarvon Castle into a stern chase. Thor's gunners found their target in the fourth salvo, after which K√§hler changed course, turning the chase into a circular fight in order to bring Thor's entire broadside to bear. Thor was in command of the engagement; her gunners registered more than 20 hits, forcing Carnarvon Castle to turn and flee to Montevideo, Uruguay. Six of Carnarvon Castles crew had been killed, and 32 more were wounded. After this engagement Thor was ordered to rendezvous with the to transfer men for prize crews for 's captured whaling fleet. On 25 March Thor intercepted , an 8,800 ton British passenger ship. After scoring several hits on the fleeing ship, K√§hler allowed her to be abandoned, before firing 16 rounds into her waterline, sinking her. German wireless operators intercepted a message from a nearby British warship approaching at full speed from about away. K√§hler decided to not risk encountering her, and reasoned that the British ship would arrive and assist those in the water. Unfortunately, the British warship failed to find the survivors. 331 out of about 520 survivors were ultimately rescued, primarily by the Spanish ships Cabo de Hornos, Raranga, and Bachi. 33 survivors eventually reached land at Sao Luis, on the coast of Brazil, after 23 days and adrift at sea. On the same day, 25 March, Thor stopped the 5,045 ton Swedish motor vessel Trollenholm. Sweden was neutral in World War II, but Trollenholm was found to have been chartered by the British to take coal from Newcastle to Port Said. In less than 90 minutes, all 31 crewmen from Trollenholm were transferred to Thor, and the freighter was sunk by demolition charges. The armed merchant cruiser in her former guise as a Lamport and Holt Ltd passenger liner. In April 1941 Thor sank her off Cape Verde. On her return trip to Germany, Thor encountered a third armed merchant cruiser off the Cape Verde islands. This was , a ship armed with eight and three guns. Thor approached head on, and in response to Voltaire's signalling of a series of AAA's (an order for a ship to identify itself), fired a shot across Voltaire's bow. Thors first salvo hit Voltaires generator and radio room, rendering her unable to transmit any further signals. Voltaire was turned into an inferno. Two of Voltaire's six-inch guns continued to fire, but they scored only one hit on Thor, disabling her radio aerial. Voltaires obsolete guns overheated and had to cease firing, at which point the Voltaire raised a white flag. Thor began rescuing Voltaires crew from a safe distance of 4,000 yards to avoid damage from any secondary explosions. Voltaires captain and 196 men were rescued out of a crew of 296. The last ship intercepted by Thor on her first cruise was on 16 April, on her way back to Germany; the Swedish ore carrier Sir Ernest Cassel. Two warning shots were fired, which stopped the ship; her crew was taken aboard Thor, and she was sunk by demolition charges. Second cruise Thor set out on her second cruise on 30 November 1941 under the command of Captain G√ºnther Gumprich. Thor sank or captured 10 ships on her second cruise, a total of 58,644 tons, during 328 days of operation. On 13 March Thor was stopped by the British cruiser . Thor identified herself as the British freighter Levernbank, which satisfied Durban, who went on her way. The following day Thor was again challenged, this time by the armed merchant cruiser Cheshire. Thor again identified herself as a British freighter, and was allowed to proceed. Thor found her first victim on 23 March, the 3,490 ton Greek freighter Pagasitikos. Her crew of 33 was taken aboard Thor, and she was sunk by a torpedo. The next day, 24 March, Thor replenished her stocks from the supply ship Regensburg. On 30 March Thor chased the 4,470 ton British freighter Wellpark for seven hours. Gumprich sent his seaplane to strafe the freighter, but was driven off when Thor opened fire on Wellpark. Within 15 minutes, the Wellpark's crew abandoned ship, and she was sunk. On 1 April Thor intercepted another British freighter, the 4,565 ton Willesden. Gumprich again ordered his floatplane to destroy the vessel's radio aerial before opening fire from Thor. After the plane's strafing run, Thor opened fire with her guns, and set oil drums on the Willesden's deck on fire, forcing most of the crew to abandon the ship. The only remaining crew were the gunners, but they managed to fire only six shots before they were also forced to abandon ship. Thor fired 128 shells into Willesden and finished her off with a torpedo. Two days later on the 3rd, the Norwegian freighter Aust fell victim to the same tactics. She was unable to send a distress or raider signal before she was disabled and sunk by demolition charges. On 10 April Thor detected the 4,840 ton British freighter Kirkpool on her radar, the first installed on an armed merchant cruiser. Poor visibility and fog forced Gumprich to abandon his usual tactics and instead shadow Kirkpool until nightfall. At close range, Thor attacked first with a torpedo and a salvo of her guns, both of which missed. The second salvo scored three hits and set Kirkpool's bridge and wheelhouse alight. With the helm unattended, Kirkpool veered towards Thor in what appeared to be an attempt to ram her attacker, which was avoided. Kirkpool's crew began abandoning ship, and after a three-hour search, 32 men were rescued from the water, including Kirkpools captain, chief engineer and first officer. The ship was sunk with a torpedo. All of Thors victims thus far were near the Cape of Good Hope, in the shipping lanes. The Kriegsmarine High Command (SKL) ordered Thor to move into the Indian Ocean, but warned her to be aware of Japanese submarines operating in the area. On 10 May Thor's seaplane sighted the 7,130 ton Australian liner Nankin, en route to Bombay. From a range of 13,000 yards Thor opened fire with her guns, scoring several hits. Nankins Captain gave the order to abandon ship and lowered his flags. The crew attempted to scuttle her, but the German boarding party managed to repair the damage done to the ship's engines. Nankin was renamed Leuthen and taken as a prize ship to rendezvous with Regensburg. Following resupply and prisoner transfer, Leuthen and Regensburg both sailed to Japanese-held ports. She was carrying secret papers from the New Zealand \\"Combined Intelligence Centre\\" in Wellington to the C-in-C, Eastern Fleet in Colombo. On 14 June Thor's radar picked up a contact at 10,000 yards, and by using a converging course, was able to approach to within 1,800 yards, Thor attacked what turned out to be the 6,310 ton Dutch Shell tanker Olivia. The first salvo set Olivia ablaze, killing most of the crew. The third officer, three other Dutchmen and eight Chinese were able to lower one boat, but Thor was able to find only one man in the water. These 12 men were adrift for a month before their boat capsized in the breakers off Madagascar; one Dutch and seven Chinese mariners had died during the month at sea. Five days later on the 19th, Thor intercepted the Norwegian oil tanker Herborg. Her seaplane disabled Herborgs radio aerial, and a warning salvo from Thor brought Herborg to a stop. The entire crew was taken aboard Thor, and a prize crew took the renamed Hohenfriedburg to Japan. On 4 July Thor stopped another Norwegian oil tanker, the 5,895 ton Madrono, in the same manner as Herborg. A prize crew took her to Japan as well, renamed as Rossbach. Rossbach was eventually torpedoed by the American submarine , in the Kii Channel, Japan, in May 1944. Thor's tenth and final victim was on 20 July, the British refrigerated freighter Indus. She put up a fight, turning away at full speed and firing her stern gun, but she fired only two shots before a shell from Thor hit the gun directly, killing the chief gunner and destroying the gun. The freighter's radio operator kept up a steady stream of distress signals, until another shell from Thor hit the bridge, killing him and knocking out the radio, and setting the bridge on fire. Indus was now a raging inferno, and most of her crew went overboard. Thor ceased firing and rescued 49 survivors before finishing Indus off. Thor transferred her prisoners to the blockade runner Tannenfels, and made for Yokohama, Japan, via Batavia in the Japanese-occupied Dutch East Indies. Fate Thor reached Yokohama on 9 October 1942 where she began refitting for a third voyage. However, on 30 November a series of explosions on the supply ship destroyed her superstructure, sending a large amount of burning debris onto Thor, which was moored alongside. Both ships were rapidly set ablaze, along with Nankin/Leuthen and the Japanese freighter Unkai Maru. All four ships were destroyed in the fire, and 12 of Thor's crew were killed. Thor was wrecked beyond repair and was abandoned. Her captain, Kapit√§n zur See Gumprich, later commanded the on her second raiding voyage, from which he did not return. A number of survivors of the ship were sent to France on the blockade runner Doggerbank and killed when the ship was mistakenly sunk by on 3 March 1943 with all but one of her 365 crew lost.

In a racing career which lasted from the autumn of 1985 until October 1986 he ran ten times and won eight races. he was the outstanding European racehorse of 1986 when he won the 2000 Guineas, the Eclipse Stakes, the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes and the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. His only defeats came in The Derby and the Breeders' Cup Turf. He was retired to stud where he was a successful sire of winners in Europe before being exported to Japan where he died in 1999. Background Dancing Brave was a bay colt with a white snip and three white feet, standing sixteen hands high, bred by the Glen Oak Farm in Kentucky. He was not a particularly attractive individual as a young horse, being described as parrot-mouthed with imperfect forelegs. Dancing Brave was sired by Lyphard out of Navajo Princess, a mare who won sixteen races including the Molly Pitcher Handicap. Navajo Princess was a descendant of the mare Stolen Kiss, who was the ancestor of notable racehorses including the Epsom Derby winner Henbit and the Kentucky Derby winner Lucky Debonair. He was purchased as a yearling by James Delahooke, on behalf of Khalid Abdullah for US$200,000 in Kentucky. The colt was sent into training with Guy Harwood at Pulborough. At the time, Harwood was noted for his modern approach to training, introducing Britain to features such as artificial gallops and barn-style stabling. Racing career=1985: Two-year-old season Dancing Brave was a May foal, and as Harwood did not believe in racing horses until they were at least two years and three months old, the colt was given only light training until late summer. Dancing Brave made his first racecourse appearance in the one-mile Dorking Stakes at Sandown in which he started odds-on favourite against three opponents. He won easily by three lengths from Mighty Memory. In the Soham House Stakes at Newmarket, Dancing Brave again started favourite after reports that he had been performing better at home than the stable's William Hill Futurity winner Bakharoff. He won by two and a half lengths from Northern Amethyst, with Nisnas in third. Despite never having contested a Group Race and being rated eleven pounds below the top-rated Bakharoff in the International Classification, he was made 10/1 winter favourite for the following year's 2000 Guineas. 1986: Three-year-old seasonSpring= Dancing Brave opened his three-year-old campaign with a victory over Faraway Dancer and Mashkour in the Craven Stakes at Newmarket in April. Over the same course and distance two weeks later he started 15/8 favourite against fourteen opponents in the 2000 Guineas. Ridden by Greville Starkey, he quickened in the closing stages of a slowly run race to win by three lengths from Green Desert and Huntingdale. After the race, Starkey was confident that the colt would stay one and a half miles in the Derby, although Harwood was more cautious. =Summer= In The Derby a month later Dancing Brave started favourite, despite concerns about his ability to stay the distance of twelve furlongs. Starkey employed exaggerated waiting tactics and Dancing Brave was close to last place entering the home straight. Switched to the outside to make his challenge, Dancing Brave accelerated in the last quarter mile, being clocked at 10.3 seconds for the penultimate furlong. He failed to catch the leader Shahrastani finishing second by half a length. His jockey, Greville Starkey, was widely criticised for his tactics, but he has been defended by others, including Harwood, who pointed out that the race was run at a muddling pace and that Starkey could only have won if he had \\"cut the horse in half\\", which as the stable jockey he was unwilling to do. Starkey kept the ride for Dancing Brave's next race, Eclipse Stakes at Sandown Park. Racing against older horses for the first time he won in \\"breathtaking style\\" by four lengths from Triptych and Teleprompter. However, when Starkey was injured and unable to ride the horse in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot he was replaced by Pat Eddery who became the preferred choice in the colt's remaining races. The Ascot race saw a rematch between Dancing Brave and Shahrastani. Since winning the Derby, Shahrastani had won the Irish Derby by eight lengths and started favourite for the King George. Eddery produced Dancing Brave's run earlier than usual, taking him into the lead over a furlong from home and the colt had to be ridden out to hold off Shardari by three-quarters of a length, with Triptych third, Shahrastani fourth and Petoski fifth. =Autumn= After a break, Dancing Brave returned in the Select Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse in September. He tracked the leaders before pulling away in the closing stages to win by ten lengths. On his final European appearance, Dancing Brave was sent overseas for the first time to contest the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp in Paris. Apart from Shardari, Shahrastani and Triptych, the field also included the German champion Acatenango and the French colt Bering, who was unbeaten in four races in 1986. Eddery restrained Dancing Brave in the early stages before switching him to the wide outside to challenge in the straight as the runners spread across the width of the course. With 200m to run he was not in the first ten, but produced an \\"electrifying burst\\" to take the lead 50m from the finish and won by a length and a half from Bering in a race record time of 2:27.7. On his final appearance was then sent to California to contest the Breeders' Cup Turf at Santa Anita Park but failed to reproduce his best form, finishing fourth behind Manila. Dancing Brave suffered an injury in the race when he was struck in the eye by a clod of turf. Assessment At the end of 1986, the panel of Racehorse handicappers met from the major racing nations of Europe to determine the International Classifications, the annual rating of thoroughbred racehorses who have run in Europe. Dancing Brave was awarded a rating of 141, the highest rating ever given to any horse up to that time. These are the official ratings as recognised by the organised racing bodies in Great Britain, Ireland, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Scandinavia, Switzerland and Austria. In January 2013 the ratings were \\"recalibrated\\" and Dancing Brave was given a revised rating of 138, now putting him second to Frankel who was rated at 140. Dancing Brave was given a rating of 140 by Timeform. In 1999, The Independent described Dancing Brave as \\"the greatest British Flat champion of the last quarter of a century\\". Dancing Brave was voted the official British Horse of the Year in 1986 by the Racegoers' Club. By taking all 27 votes in the poll he was the first horse to be unanimously elected since Brigadier Gerard in 1971. Pat Eddery called Dancing Brave the best horse he ever rode, and a \\"once in a lifetime ride\\", while Khalid Abdulla described him as the outstanding horse to have carried his colours. Guy Harwood called him \\"very much the best I trained\\". In their book A Century of Champions, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Dancing Brave as the sixth best British racehorse of the 20th century, and the sixteenth best horse of the century trained in any country. Stud career Dancing Brave was syndicated with an estimated value of ¬£14m. He retired to stand as a stallion at the Dalham Hall Stud at Newmarket with an initial stud fee of ¬£120,000. According to Tony Morris in Thoroughbred Stallions (1990), he was known to often pass on his parrot mouth to his stock. In November 1987 he was found to be suffering from Marie's disease and had fertility problems in 1988. His modest early success led to his being exported to Japan, to stand at the Shizunai Stallion Station at Hokkaid≈ç in 1991. He died on August 2, 1999 of a heart attack. He sired numerous winners, having a particularly good crop of three-year-olds in 1993, foaled in the year before his export, including Commander in Chief, who won The Derby, and White Muzzle, second in both the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes and the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. Other good winners included Wemyss Bight, Cherokee Rose and Ivanka. The best of his Japanese offspring was the filly T M Ocean who won the Oka Sho and the Shuka Sho in 2001.

They developed from European mountebank shows and were common in the United States in the nineteenth century, especially in the Old West (though some continued until World War II). They usually promoted \\"miracle elixirs\\" (sometimes referred to as snake oil), which, it was claimed, had the ability to cure disease, smooth wrinkles, remove stains, prolong life or cure any number of common ailments. Most shows had their own patent medicine (these medicines were for the most part unpatented but took the name to sound official). Entertainments often included a freak show, a flea circus, musical acts, magic tricks, jokes, or storytelling. Each show was run by a man posing as a doctor who drew the crowd with a monologue. The entertainers, such as acrobats, musclemen, magicians, dancers, ventriloquists, exotic performers, and trick shots, kept the audience engaged until the salesman sold his medicine. History=Origins Snake Oil Liniment While showmen pitching miraculous cures have been around since classical times, the advent of mixed performance and medicine sales in western culture originated during the Dark Ages in Europe after circuses and theatres were banned and performers had only the marketplace or patrons for support. Mountebanks traveled through small towns and large cities, selling miraculous elixirs by offering small street shows and miraculous cures. Itinerant peddlers of dubious medicines appeared in the American colonies before 1772, when legislation prohibiting their activities was enacted. Increasingly elaborate performances were developed to appeal to a largely rural population. Nineteenth century Over the course of the nineteenth century, traveling mountebanks gave way to more polished medicine shows, which availed themselves of a burgeoning patent medicine industry. At least 1,500 patent medicines were recorded by 1858, affording enterprising drifters a specific product to sell. These \\"medicines\\" seldom treated the specific symptoms of an illness, instead relying on stimulants or other drugs to produce a pleasurable effect. Alcohol, opium and cocaine were typical ingredients, and their addictive qualities provided an additional incentive for consumers to continue buying them, while their supposed medicinal benefit afforded a sufficient excuse. By 1900, the patent medicine industry was an $80 million business. Also contributing to the rise of the medicine show was the expansion of the advertising industry, through which shows were able to procure inexpensive posters, fliers, handbills, and other merchandising to promote their products. Other forms of advertising included the use of memorable jingles, sensational testimonials, and scare tactics. Medicine shows combined various forms of popular entertainment with sales pitches from a self-proclaimed \\"doctor\\" who sold an astounding cure-all medicine or device. Shows played either outdoors from a wagon, platform or tent, or indoors in a theatre or opera hall. Admission was usually free or nominal. Pitchmen would make grandiose claims about their product's efficacy, sometimes planting testimonials in the audience. The speaker's goal was to create a need, or fear, then offer his unique medicine as the only cure. Alternating entertainment with sales pitches wore down the audience's resistance, until the crowd was saturated with a desire for the product. The show would continue to run as many days as possible, then move on to the next town. A show might remain in a given location between one night and six weeks, depending on how the troupe behaved itself. Medicine shows often brought entertainment to rural communities that might not have any other sort of performances for years at a time. Whatever the quality of the medical advice, spectators got their money's worth from the free entertainment. Some shows followed circuits covering the entire United States, though most shows focused on the rural midwest and south, where the inhabitants were considered particularly gullible. Hamlin's Wizard Oil Company and Kickapoo Indian Medicine Company The two largest, most successful American medicine shows were Hamlin's Wizard Oil Company, founded in Chicago by John and Lysander Hamlin, and the Kickapoo Indian Medicine Company, founded in 1881 by Charles Bigelow and John Healey. Hamlin's Wizard Oil Company troupes travelled in specially designed wagons, with built-in organs and space for musical performers. Their appeal was clean, moral, musical entertainment for the whole family. Part of their advertising included songsters, or small booklets of song lyrics and Wizard Oil advertising. The Kickapoo Indian Medicine Company created traveling shows based around sham Indian presentational ceremonies, such as war dances and marriages. \\"Representatives\\" of the Kickapoo tribe translated for the Indians and sold Sagwa, the most famous patent medicine. The company also presented other forms of entertainment, such as vaudeville shows, trained dog acts, dances, and acrobatics. 20th century As reliable commercial pharmaceuticals were produced on an industrial level in the early 20th century, the reputation of and market for home remedies began to dwindle, and medicine shows came to rely ever more on their entertainment value. But as America's population became less rural and more urbanized, the availability of other forms of entertainment, such as motion pictures, vaudeville and later radio, led to the gradual disappearance of the traveling medicine show. By the 1930s few such companies continued to tour in the United States. Even fewer shows endured the economic and social upheaval of the Great Depression and World War II. Those that survived into the 1950s found themselves competing with television and came to be regarded as relics of an earlier, more innocent era. This novelty, far more than the availability of the remedies peddled, provided the chief support for the last of the traveling medicine shows. The Hadacol Caravan One of the most famous of the 20th-century traveling shows was the Hadacol Caravan, sponsored by Louisiana State Senator Dudley J. LeBlanc and his LeBlanc Corporation, makers of the dubious patent medicine/vitamin tonic Hadacol, known for both its alleged curative powers and its high alcohol content. The stage show, which ran throughout the Deep South in the 1940s with great publicity, featured a number of notable music acts and Hollywood celebrities and promoted Hadacol, which was sold during intermission and after the show. Admission to the show was paid in boxtops of the vitamin tonic, sold in stores throughout the southern United States. The Caravan came to a sudden halt in 1951, when the Hadacol enterprise fell apart in a financial scandal. Chief Thundercloud and Peg Leg Sam One of the last great medicine shows had its swan song in the summer of 1972, when the two-man show of Chief Thundercloud (pitchman Leo Kahdot, a Potawatomi from Oklahoma) and Peg Leg Sam (harmonicist-singer-comedian Arthur Jackson) played at a carnival in Pittsboro, North Carolina. It was the last show of the year for them; Kahdot died that winter. \\"Born For Hard Luck\\" a documentary film about Peg Leg Sam on Folkstreams.net, includes scenes from that last show. \\"Doc\\" Scott‚Äôs Last Real Old Time Medicine Show Perhaps the last of the medicine shows was run by Tommy Scott, who staged as many as three hundred shows per year until about 1990. As a teenager in the 1930s, Scott joined the \\"Doc\\" Chambers Medicine Show, established by M. F. Chambers in the late nineteenth century. Scott sang, played guitar, performed ventriloquism and blackface acts, and pitched Chambers's Herb-O-Lac herbal laxative. When Chambers retired in the late 1930s, Scott took charge of the show, performing for many years with his wife, Mary, and his sidekick, Gaines Blevins, known as \\"Old Bleb\\". Scott's daughter, Sandra, performed in the show as a singer, bass player, and acrobat, and from the 1960s onward managed the business end of the show. Herb- O-Lac eventually gave way to a mentholated skin liniment, which Scott dubbed Snake Oil. For decades, the show toured arenas and senior centers as \\"Doc\\" Scott's Last Real Old Time Medicine Show. From the 1960s to the 1980s, the show also solicited donations for charitable organizations such as the Lions Club and the Optimist Club. In popular culture The 1930 film The Medicine Man mixes comedy and melodrama with a medicine show coming into a small town. In the 1932 Fleischer Studios cartoon Betty Boop, M.D., Betty, Bimbo and Koko are the owners of a traveling medicine show. In the 1933 Krazy Kat cartoon The Medicine Show, Krazy runs a medicine show where he performs some acts and sells bottled liquids which have a variety of uses. Several modern musical acts have named themselves after this old-time phenomenon, including Old Crow Medicine Show, Dr. West's Medicine Show and Junk Band, Dr. Hook & The Medicine Show and MV & EE Medicine Show. The name was also used in the titles of The Dream Syndicate's album Medicine Show, Big Audio Dynamite's song \\"Medicine Show\\", Moxy Fr√ºvous's song \\"The Incredible Medicine Show\\", and The Band's song \\"W.S. Walcott Medicine Show\\". Throughout 2010 and 2011, the hip hop artist Madlib released a 12-part mix series with the title \\"Madlib Medicine Show\\". Science fiction author Orson Scott Card titled his online sci-fi journal \\"The Intergalactic Medicine Show\\". In 1970 two original members of The Open Theater, Barbara Vann and James Barbosa, founded Medicine Show Theatre Ensemble also in New York.

Many observers tie in the growth of the direct market distribution system and comic book specialty shops to the general acceptance of Overstreet's annual guide as a standardized inventory and pricing system. Begun in 1970 by Robert M. Overstreet as a guide for fellow fans of Golden Age and Silver Age comics, the Overstreet guide has expanded to cover virtually the entire history of the American comics publication as far back as the Victorian Age and Platinum Age. The annual edition also covers promotional comics (giveaways and advertising) and \\"big little books,\\" while continually updating new publications and market reports that cover the prior year of market activity. Overstreet's annual guide to the comic book collecting hobby has itself become a collectible, and since the 1980s each edition of the Price Guide includes a page listing collector's values for older editions, with hardcover editions, in particular, selling for a premium. Currently, the Price Guide is published in four formats: hardcover, softcover, a larger, ring-bound edition and an electronic edition, often with multiple covers for each version.  History  Robert M. Overstreet grew up as a comic book, coin, and Indian arrowhead collector. In the 1960s, after abandoning a project to create an arrowhead price guide, Overstreet turned his attention to comics, which had no definitive guide.\\"Who is Robert M. Overstreet?\\" Arrowheads.com. Accessed Nov. 3, 2011. Comic back-issue prices had stabilized by the end of the 1960s,Thompson, Maggie. \\"November 1970: Mint Never Meant So Much Before,\\" \\"The 1900s: 10 biggest events from 100 years in comics,\\" Comics Buyer's Guide #1365 (Jan. 14, 2000). and, Jerry Bails, who had recently published the Collector‚Äôs Guide to the First Heroic Age, was considering creating a comic book price guide. He was contacted by Overstreet, who was doing the same thing. Bails' extensive notes, supplemented by Overstreet's study of dealer listings, \\"became a backbone to the Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide.\\"Ray Bottorff, Jr., quoted in \\"With a Little Help From His Friends...\\", Alter Ego vol. 3, #25 (June 2003), pp. 14-19. Under the auspices of Overstreet Publications, the first Comic Book Price Guide was published in November 1970. Priced at $5, saddle-stitched and published in a print run of 1000 (a second edition of 800 was released subsequently),\\"The Semi-Secret Origins of the Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide,\\" Scoop (Mar. 15, 2003). the book included 218 pages of listings. Among other things, Overstreet's guide included inventory lists, and it instantly became an invaluable resource tool for comic book collectors and dealers. By 1976, the guide had achieved national distribution. An early decision was made by author to exclude the niche of underground comix, an adult-oriented expression of the genre that Mr. Overstreet had no interest in documenting, for reasons he has never made public, despite the book being promoted by its publisher as \\"the most complete listing of comics from the 1500s to the present.\\"  Overstreet periodicals  Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Overstreet also produced publications that would serve price updates regarding newer comics releases from the present, to selected titles dating from the Silver Age, including a price guide to current and valuable comics, as well as comic book and collector news, and interviews. There was also some editorial content from the publishers, and from polled bookstore owners. Various incarnations of the publication (which were published quarterly to bi- monthly, and eventually monthly) included Overstreet's Comic Book Price Update, Overstreet's Comics Price Bulletin,Overstreet Comic Book Monthly, and Overstreet's Fan, with this last incarnation showing a great deal of similarity to the successful comics news magazine Wizard: The Guide to Comics. Overstreet also published twenty-one issues of Comic Book Marketplace between Mar./Apr. 1993 and January 1995. Ultimately, most titles were canceled, including Overstreet's Fan which ceased publication in 1997.  Sale to Gemstone  Overstreet sold the business to Gemstone Publishing in 1994, and continues to serve as author of the annual guides and associated publications. In July 2003, Gemstone attempted another monthly by publishing Overstreet's Comic Price Review, which ran only for nineteen issues. They also published 3 volumes of the Overstreet Premium Ring Price Guide featuring values of thousands of collectible toy rings of all types, the most valuable of which is the Supermen of America ring, which fetches around $100,000, depending on condition. Original art for volumes 2 and 3 by artist A. Kaviraj can be viewed at Austin's Ring Museum in Las Cruces, New Mexico. The 50th edition (2020-2021) of the Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide went on sale September 2, 2020.  Facsimile Edition  In connection with the publication's 50th anniversary, Gemstone is publishing a Facsimile Edition reprint of the first edition (1970), which was originally scheduled to be released April 8, 2020 but was delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic. There will be three editions: softcover (retail price $16.95), hardcover ($25.00, limited to 400 copies), and a signed and numbered hardcover ($50.00, signed by Robert Overstreet and limited to 100 copies).

It contained two elements, a 1901 automobile plant in downtown Lansing, and the 1920 Durant Motors factory on Lansing's Far Westside. The Lansing plant was the longest- operating automobile factory in the United States when it closed on May 6, 2005, and one of General Motors last assembly plants where vehicle bodies were made at one plant, and then trucked to another plant to be finished. General Motors began demolition of the plant in the spring of 2006, and demolition was completed in 2007. A new plant at nearby Lansing Grand River Assembly, which began production in 2001, as well as the Delta Township called Lansing Delta Township Assembly assumed some operations when it began production in 2006. From the 1940s through the 1980s, it was the main producer of full-size Oldsmobiles (88 and 98), but by the 1990s it was producing compact cars for several GM divisions. History Lansing Car Assembly (LCA) began in 1901 when Ransom E. Olds moved his Olds Motor Works to the city. He set up his plant on the site of the fairgrounds next to the Grand River. This plant in downtown Lansing would later be known as Lansing Car Assembly ‚Äì Chassis Plant. Body shop (plant #6) The plant along Verlinden Avenue, on Lansing's border with Lansing Township, opened in 1920 as a factory for Durant Motor Works. After the demise of Durant in 1931, the plant remained closed until GM purchased it in 1935. It restarted production for GM's Fisher Body division, later becoming the Buick‚ÄìOldsmobile‚ÄìCadillac factory. Its final name was Lansing Car Assembly ‚Äì Body Plant. The last cars that Lansing Car Assembly produced were the Chevrolet Malibu/Chevrolet Classic, Oldsmobile Alero, and Pontiac Grand Am, which was the final vehicle built there. The plant built the very last Oldsmobile, a 2004 Alero. LCA was regularly ranked among the most productive automobile assembly plants in North America. In 2002, it was ranked the number one most productive assembly plant in North America by The Harbour Report, the auto industry's leading measurement of plant efficiency. Main plant (plant #1) The main plant was located in downtown Lansing, Michigan, located along Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard at the Grand River. It sat on the original site of the Michigan State Fairgrounds. The plant also included the unique Lansing GM Building 150 which sat in between Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard bridges. It featured two separate assembly lines. Partially completed vehicles were transported by truck from the Body Plant to either the North Line \\"M\\" or the South Line \\"C\\" for completion. Upon completion, cars were driven off the assembly line and under northbound Martin Luther King, Jr.Boulevard bridge. After final inspection, the cars were placed in staging yards to either be shipped by truck or by rail. The first factory on site opened in 1902 as part of Olds Motor Works, and became part of General Motors when they bought that company out in 1908. The complex was closed in 2005, finally being demolished in 2007. Harbour Consulting rated it as the sixth most efficient auto plant in North America in 2006.

These include Ringos, Golden Wonder and Transform-A-Snack. Since 2006, it has been a wholly owned subsidiary of the Northern Irish company Tayto, after being rescued out of administration. History Founded in Stockbridge in Edinburgh in 1947 by the Scottish bakery owner William Alexander, the company was named after the Golden Wonder potato. The company originally had five manufacturing sites. Four sites produced crisps, two in Scotland and two in England (Widnes and Corby). The Welsh site at Crumlin produced the \\"Pot Noodle\\". The company was owned by various parent companies including Imperial Tobacco, Hanson plc, and was then acquired by United Kingdom based Dalgety plc in March 1987. In February 1992, Sooner Snacks, manufacturer of Nik Naks and Wheat Crunchies, was bought from Borden Inc. by Dalgety plc, with the company being absorbed into Golden Wonder. In 1995, Golden Wonder underwent a management buyout costing ¬£54.6 million. In 2000, Bridgepoint Capital acquired the company for ¬£156 million. In January 2006, the company was bought by Tayto, a company based in Tandragee, County Armagh. Its notable brands have included: \\"Wotsits\\", \\"Ringos\\", \\"Jungle Fresh\\" peanuts and Pot Noodle, which ceased to carry Golden Wonder branding after the brand (but not the manufacturing business itself) was sold to Unilever. In July 1995, Best Foods paid Dalgety plc about $280 million for its Golden Wonder Pot Noodle instant hot snacks manufacturing business. Following the purchase by Tayto in 2006, the Nik Naks and Wheat Crunchies brands were subsequently sold to United Biscuits. Products Golden Wonder launched the cheese & onion crisp flavour in 1962. This was their first flavoured crisp, the concept having been devised by Tayto in Ireland (not the same company as that which bought Golden Wonder over in 2006) in 1953. In the 1970s, Golden Wonder produced a line of shell- shaped crisps called Rock 'n' Roller Crisps, named after that decade's rock and roll revival. They were available in Salt & Vinegar, Cheese & Onion and Crispy Bacon flavours. During the 1980s, Golden Wonder ceased to make them. In the 1980s, Golden Wonder claimed on television and on their packets to be Britain's Noisiest Crisp. In the 1990s, a popular series of television adverts with adult actors indulging in childish antics carried another famous slogan: You'll never grow old in Golden Wonderland!. In 2009, the Golden Wonder brand started to be used by Symingtons Ltd, under licence, for the production of The Nation's Noodle and The Nation's Pasta. The new range of instant noodles is very similar to the Pot Noodle range, previously produced by Golden Wonder. Golden Wonder branding now features on snacks previously marketed by Red Mill, another snack manufacturer taken over by Tayto. Golden Wonder now produces a number of different flavours of potato crisp. It is also the current owner of the XL Crisp brand. Golden Wonder was the former owner of the Wotsits brand, but when the company changed hands in May 2002, it was sold off separately to their rival Walkers. Previous snacks Wheat Crunchies, Chips & Burgers and the corn based Nik Naks are now owned by KP. Administration Golden Wonder entered into administration on 9 January 2006, threatening about 800 jobs. On 13 January 2006, it was announced that the Corby, Northamptonshire site and the contract to Mini Pringles, as produced by Golden Wonder, would transfer to Northern Irish crisp manufacturer Tayto. The announcement brought the news that 195 of 350 jobs would be saved initially. On 20 January 2006, it was announced that Tayto was to buy all Golden Wonder's operations in the United Kingdom including the Scunthorpe, North Lincolnshire site, although it would sell the Wheat Crunchies and Nik Naks brands to United Biscuits.

Paid for mostly by donations and the city of Leipzig, it was completed in 1913 for the 100th anniversary of the battle at a cost of six million goldmarks. The monument commemorates the defeat of Napoleon's French army at Leipzig, a crucial step towards the end of hostilities in the War of the Sixth Coalition. The coalition armies of Russia, Prussia, Austria and Sweden were led by Tsar Alexander I of Russia and Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg. There were Germans fighting on both sides, as Napoleon's troops also included conscripted Germans from the left bank of the Rhine annexed by France, as well as troops from his German allies of the Confederation of the Rhine.

History=BackgroundThe War of the Sixth Coalition and the Battle of Leipzig= A painting by Russian A.I. Zauerweid, depicting the Battle of the Nations Following the French Revolution, France had waged a number of wars against its European neighbours. Napoleon Bonaparte had taken control of the country, first as Consul from 1799, and reigned as Emperor of the French under the title Napoleon I since 1804. Over the course of the hostilities, the Holy Roman Empire had ceased to exist following the abdication of Emperor Francis II, bowing to Napoleon's pressure, including the foundation of the Confederation of the Rhine from various former members of the Empire. The War of the Fifth Coalition in 1809 had ended with another defeat for the joint forces of the Austrian Empire, Great Britain, Spain, and Portugal against the French and their German allies. Following Napoleon's unsuccessful invasion of Russia in 1812, Prussia joined the countries already at war with France to begin the War of the Sixth Coalition in March 1813. During the early part of the campaign, the allied forces against Napoleon suffered defeats at Gro√üg√∂rschen (2 May) and Bautzen (20‚Äì21 May), being driven back to the river Elbe. However, due to lack of training in his newly- recruited soldiers, Napoleon was unable to take full advantage of his victories, allowing his enemies to regroup. Following a ceasefire, Austria rejoined the Coalition on 17 August. The French advantage in numbers was now reversed, with the Coalition forces counting 490,000 soldiers to Napoleon's 440,000. Between 16‚Äì19 October 1813, the Battle of the Nations outside Leipzig was the decisive one in the war, cementing the French defeat and temporarily ending Napoleon's rule. The Emperor was exiled to Elba in May 1814, but briefly returned to power the following year, before being permanently banished following his defeat at the Battle of Waterloo. The Battle of the Nations was fought between France and their German allies against a coalition of Russian, Austrian, Prussian, and Swedish forces. About half a million soldiers were involved and at the end of the battle, around 110,000 men had lost their lives, with many more dying in the days after in field hospitals in and around the city. The scope of the fighting was unprecedented. =Remembrance of the Battle of the Nations between 1813 and 1871= In the immediate aftermath, both the Battle of Leipzig as well as the Wars of Liberation (Befreiungskriege), as they became known in Germany, soon established a controversial and divided culture of remembrance. For liberal thinkers and young, educated students, many of whom had fought in the wars, they resembled a starting point for a potential German unification into a national state. This sentiment was embodied in the mythologization of the Freikorps and Landwehr regiments, volunteer fighters against the French rule. On the other side, the monarchs of the German states as well as conservatives highlighted the role the princes had played in the struggle against Napoleon, seeing a growing desire for a German national state as an attack on their royal and noble positions. Ernst Moritz Arndt, a leading liberal and nationalistic writer, called for a commemoration of the battle throughout Germany. The anniversary on 19 October should be marked by festivities with \\"burning fires, festive 'folk' clothing, oak wreaths, and the ringing of bells\\". In fact, the first anniversary of the battle was marked by celebrations across the German countries, including bonfires. However, in some territories such as Baden and W√ºrttemberg, such celebrations were prohibited, while in the Kingdom of Hanover, they were incorporated into the festivities around George III's jubilee on 23 October. In Berlin, the capital of the Kingdom of Prussia, the main celebration was organised by the Turner movement, gymnastic clubs led by nationalist Friedrich Ludwig Jahn. Taking place at the Hasenheide, a park outside Berlin, the event was attended by several tens of thousands of people. Similar celebrations were held the following years. These included the Wartburg Festival in 1817, a nationalistic event commemorating both Martin Luther's stay at the Wartburg as well as the Battle of Leipzig. However, following the Carlsbad Decrees of 1819 both the Burschenschaften, the nationalistic student groups, as well as the Turners, were outlawed, and commemoration of the Battle of Leipzig subsided over the following years. In the 1840s, the \\"Association for the Celebration of October 19\\" was established in Leipzig, partly reviving the remembrance of the event, however, only the anniversaries in 1838 and 1863 were \\"forcefully expressed\\". In 1863, for the battle's 50th anniversary, the city of Leipzig put up large festivities, inviting representatives from 200 German cities and several hundred veterans. The celebrations included nationalistic songs and the reading of poems, with between 25,000 to 30,000 people in attendance. =First proposals for a monument at the site of the battle= Historian and writer Ernst Moritz Arndt was the first to propose a large monument on the site of the Battle of Leipzig. Shortly after the Battle of Leipzig, Arndt called for a monument to be built at the site. He demanded that it \\"has to be constructed in such a way that it can be seen from all the streets around from which the allied armies moved to the bloody decisive battle. If it is to be seen, it has to be large and splendid ‚Äì like a collosus, a pyramid, a Cologne Cathedral\\". His plans included a high mound surrounded by oak groves, with a large cross on top. However, lack of political will prevented such a monument of being built at the time. Arndt, together with the painter Caspar David Friedrich, worked on a monument for Gerhard von Scharnhorst, who had died from injuries sustained in the Battle of Gro√üg√∂rschen, but received no support from state officials. In a letter to Arndt, Friedrich lamented in March 1814: \\"I am not at all surprised, that no memorials are being erected, neither to mark the great cause of the Volk, nor to the manganimous deeds of great German men. As long as we remain man-servants to the princes, nothing of this sort will happen.\\" Other people came forward with plans for a large memorial as well, including Karl Sieveking and August von Kotzebue, the latter of whom suggested a tall Roman column with an Iron Cross on top, symbolising the victory of Germany against France, the \\"modern Rome\\". The architect Friedrich Weinbrenner proposed a fortress to be built outside Leipzig, at the top of which a pyramid was to be placed, with the quadriga that Napoleon had taken from the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin situated on it. On the other side of the political spectrum, the nobleman Adolph von Seckendorff put forward the plan for a simple monument to the Saxon government, which would bear an inscription reading \\"To the liberation of a strong land, Alexander, Franz, and Friedrich Wilhelm\\", honouring the three monarchs who led the fight against Napoleon. While none of the proposals for Leipzig gained any support, a monument for the Wars of Liberation was erected in Berlin in 1821. Designed by Karl Friedrich Schinkel, it was a miniature of a gothic church tower situated on top of the Kreuzberg, bearing the names of twelve battles fought against the French. It's inscription, \\"From the king to the people who, at his call, nobly sacrificed their blood and chattels to the Fatherland\\", highlighted the role of the monarch over that of the people. On the first anniversary of the battle, in 1814, a tall wooden cross was placed as a monument in front of a church in one of the burned villages near the city. It was removed by the winter of the same year. In 1817, a monument to J√≥zef Poniatowski, a Marshal of the French Empire who had died in the battle, was placed by his sister and Polish veterans near the battle site. After the establishment of the \\"Association for the Celebration of October 19\\", more small monuments started to be built. The family of Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg also placed a monument in his honour at the site, in 1838. In 1843, a sandstone monument was erected at \\"Napoleon Hill\\", where the Emperor had supposedly watched the battle. Two years later, the local government of Leipzig established another monument, commemorating the entrance of the victorious forces into the city. Until 1863, seven memorial stones were also placed to mark decisive points of the battle, which still remain to this day. In the same year, on the 50th anniversary of the Battle of Leipzig, city officials also funded the restoration of the monument they had erected in 1845. During the same festivities, a cornerstone for a future grand monument was placed, and 23 cities from all around Germany, including Vienna, Hanover, and Dresden, pledged money for its construction. However, the Unification of Germany and the subsequent foundation of the German Empire temporarily halted plans for a monument, since public conscience turned towards the more recent military victories. The commemoration of the Battle of Leipzig as a decisive one in German history was replaced by the Battle of Sedan and the city of Leipzig erected a monument to the German unification in its centre in 1888. Steffen Poser, head of the Museum of the Monument for the Battle of the Nations, wrote: \\"[T]he foundation of the German Empire deprived the monument project of what had been its basis for legitimacy so far‚Äînamely, the desire for German unification, the leitmotif, which had been missing at the time.\\" Construction The monument under construction in 1912 The monument at night in 2015 In 1863, commemorating the 50th anniversary of the battle, a foundation stone was placed, but the memorial was not built. Clemens Thieme, a member of the ' (Association for the History of Leipzig) learned during a meeting of the association about the past plans to build a monument. Interested in resuming the project, Thieme, who was also a member of the Apollo masonic lodge, proposed the project during a meeting and gained the support of his fellow masons.Hoffmann; p.122 In 1894, he founded the ' (Association of German Patriots) which raised, by means of donations and a lottery, the funds necessary to construct the monument for the 100th anniversary . The following year, the city of Leipzig donated a site for the construction. The project was commissioned to Bruno Schmitz, due to his previous works at the Kyffh√§user.Pohlsander; p.169 The construction began in 1898. The chosen construction site was the spot where Napoleon ordered the retreat of his army. Thieme financed part of the construction as well, and for his complete dedication to the project, he was named an Honorary Citizen of Leipzig. In 1898, the construction started. of earth was moved; 26,500 granite blocks were used and the project resulted in a total cost of 6,000,000‚Ñ≥ (‚Ç¨ in ), the monument was finished in 1913.Kamusella; p.180 On the 18th of October 1913 the V√∂lkerschlachtdenkmal was inaugurated in the presence of about 100 000 people including the emperor Wilhelm II, and all the reigning sovereign rulers of the German states. Design and concept Inspired by Weinbrenner's early project,Koshar; pp.43,44 Schmitz constructed the monument over an artificial hill, and selected a pyramidal shape for a clear view of the surroundings.Koshar; p.44 The base is square. The main structure, at , is one of the tallest monuments in Europe. It is composed of two storeys. On the first story, a crypt is adorned by eight large statues of fallen warriors, each one next to smaller statues called the ' (Guardians of the Dead). On the second story, the ' (Hall of Fame) features four statues, each tall, representing the four legendary historic qualities ascribed to the German people: bravery, faith, sacrifice, and fertility. The statues of the monument were sculpted by Christian Behrens and his apprentice Franz Metzner, who finished the remaining statues after Behrens's death in 1905.Sembach; p.28 Metzner worked on the sculptures at the top and inside the memorial.Sembach; p.38 File:In der Krypta des V√∂lkerschlachtdenkmals Leipzig mit Totenw√§chter September 2005.JPGCrypt of the Monument File:Michael Voelkerschlachtdenkmal.JPGArchangel Michael File:Fotothek df roe-neg 0006420 002 W√§chterfiguren - Detail des V√∂lkerschlachtdenkma.jpg' (guards) File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-B0926-0091-006, Leipzig, V√∂lkerschlachtdenkmal, Kuppel.jpgDome of the memorial File:Leipzig Monument.JPGDome details The memorial is constructed in granite and sandstone. The cupola is decorated with primitive Germanic shapes, inspired by Egyptian and Assyrian sculpture. Schmitz also planned to create an accompanying complex for ceremonies that would include a court, a stadium and parade grounds. However, only a reflecting pool and two processional avenues were ultimately completed.Michalski; p.65 Surrounding the monument are oaks, a symbol of masculine strength and endurance to the Germanic people of antiquity. The oaks are complemented by evergreens, symbolising feminine fecundity, and they are located in a subordinate position to the oaks.Koshar; p.46 The main figure on the front of the memorial represents the archangel Michael, considered the \\"War god of Germans\\". The design of the monument was intended to commemorate the spirit of the German folk. Unlike previous monuments that commemorated the achievements of the monarchy, this one was created to commemorate the end of the battle in 1813, the establishment of a German community, and the maturation of the Germans as an organised ethnic group. From the Nazi Third Reich through the Communist GDR to the present German 3 Mark 1913 Commemorative coin Centennial of the Battle of Leipzig, design German 3 Mark 1913 Commemorative coin Centennial of the Battle of Leipzig, reverse During the Third Reich, Hitler frequently used the monument as a venue for his meetings in Leipzig. During WW2, an anti-aircraft gun (Flak) position was established on top of the monument. When the US Army captured Leipzig on April 18, 1945, the monument was the last stronghold in the city to surrender. 300 soldiers, men of the Volkssturm and boys of the Hitler Youth under the command of Oberst Hans von Poncet, were holding out in the monument, but after a direct artillery hit inside the structure, von Poncet was convinced to surrender following long negotiations. During the period of Communist rule in East Germany from 1949 to 1989, the government of the GDR was unsure whether it should allow the monument to stand, since it was considered to represent the steadfast nationalism of the period of the German Empire. Eventually, it was decided that the monument be allowed to remain, since it represented a battle in which Russian and German soldiers had fought together against a common enemy, and was therefore representative of ' (Russo-German brotherhood- in-arms) (although some Germans fought on the other side in the battle). In 1956, the opening ceremony of the Gymnastics and Sports Festival took place in the memorial complex; the authorities stated that the monument could be interpreted as a symbol of \\"long-standing German-Russian friendship\\".Johnson; p.37 The festival planners focused the spirit of the celebrations on German history, and the ceremony as a symbol of the desired German union.Johnson; p.38 Restoration of the monument started in 2003, and is expected to be completed in 2019.

Jenkins Law Library is a membership library, located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, serving the local legal community. History The Law Library Company of the City of Philadelphia (America's first law library) was founded in 1802 by 71 attorneys, among whom were the most prominent lawyers of the time. They formed a corporation so they could jointly purchase a collection of legal materials with which to practice law. Shares of stock in the company were sold for $20; annual dues were $2. In 1827, the Law Library Company merged with the Associated Members of the Bar and became known as the Law Association of Philadelphia. Eventually this organization became known as the Philadelphia Bar Association, and in 1931 the library's name was changed (the first of several name changes) to the Law Library of the Philadelphia Bar Association. The library was operated by the Bar Association until July 1, 1967, when the Theodore F. Jenkins Memorial Law Library (now known as Jenkins Law Library) was established with court approval to carry out the provisions of the will of the late Madeleine Hart Jenkins. It was her wish that her late husband, Theodore Finley Jenkins, be memorialized in a manner that would benefit the Bar and the public. Governed by a Board of Directors, Jenkins Law Library is a 501(c)(3). Although now independent from the Philadelphia Bar Association, the two organizations work together on mutual projects that benefit members of the Philadelphia legal community. When it came time to renovate the Jenkins Law Library in 2004, Executive Director Regina Smith had one thought in mind ‚Äì make the library a destination for lawyers, not a book warehouse. After more than 30 years at 833 Chestnut Street, in late 2018 Jenkins moved across town to 1801 Market Street, in Ten Penn Center.https://www.jenkinslaw.org/blog/2018/11/08/were-moving ReferencesExternal links *Jenkins Law Library Category:Center City, Philadelphia Category:1802 establishments in Pennsylvania Category:Libraries in Pennsylvania Category:Law libraries ","title":"Jenkins Law Library"},{"id":"1868004","text":"Stand Tall is a 1997 documentary film about bodybuilding.

This breed developed by the Alans was well renowned primarily for its quality as a large-game catch dog, and as a war dog and guard dog.  Features  Persian Mastiff statue. National Museum of Iran. In France, the Alaunt breed had three distinct types: the Alaunt Veantre, Alaunt Boucherie and Alaunt Gentile. They all were large, short-coated dogs of varying head-types. The former two resembled the molosser-type dogs much like the present-day Dogo Argentino or like the Caucasian Shepherd Dog except with short hair and a mesocephalic head which made them excellent large-game hunters. The Alaunt was originally bred by the Alani tribes, the nomads of Indo-European Sarmatian ancestry who spoke an Iranian language. The Alans were known as superb warriors, herdsmen, and breeders of horses and dogs. The Alans bred their dogs for work and developed different strains within the breed for specific duties. The breed was further developed in Spain, Portugal, France, Germany, England, and in Italy. History Molosser dog. Terracota statue. Boboli Gardens, Italy. The Molossus belonged to the tribe of the Illyrians, who invaded Epirus in northern Greece in about 1200 BC, coming from the north. However, their artifacts did not resemble the Mastiff prototype, as they had a long nose of a narrow type, and a long mane. Varro, however, described a herding dog of Epirus which was white, large-headed, and slightly undershot, used to defend sheep and goats.Fleig 1996, p. 18‚Äì22 (Varro's description of herding dogs) One group of Alans arrived in what is now Albania in the 5th or 6th centuries BC.Atlas 1995 p. 30 Molossis of Epirus is located in Southern Albania.Fleig 1996, p. 18 \\"Today Epirus is part of Albania.\\" It is most plausible the Alaunt gave rise to the fighting dogs of the Molossi, which were introduced to Britain by Roman invasion in 43 BC. The Alans provided cavalry for Rome, many of whom were deployed to Hadrian's Wall in the Second Century AD.Hancock p. 28 Thus, the Alaunt genetic template most plausibly gave rise to the British Pugnaces as fighting dogs which English Mastiffs and Bulldogs descend from. In the 370s AD, Hun invasions divided the Alani into the Eastern and Western Alans. The Eastern Alani tribes merged with the Ossetians and other nations, introducing their dogs into the bloodlines of many Balkan breeds, such as the ≈†arplaninac, Metchkar, Qen Ghedje, Hellenikos Poimenikos and other Molossers of the region. The white-coloured Alaunts may be the direct ancestors of the Balkan breeds, which in turn influenced all other white dogs in the Balkans. Pedro Afonso of Portugal, Count of Barcelos. The tomb has a wild boar hunting scene with dogs, possibly the extinct Portuguese Alaunt dog. The Western Alans joined the Vandals on their raids through Europe and by the 410s AD, their fierce dogs were influencing many breeds in France, Spain, Portugal, England and other countries, spreading the use of the \\"Alaunt\\" name, which became synonymous with a type of a working dog, rather than a specific breed. Through breeding with various scenthounds and sighthounds, some Alaunts became valued large game hunting dogs, existing in a variety of types, dictated by regional preferences. In AD 1500, Spain was known for breeding the best Alaunts and used them to conquer the New World.Hancock 2000, p.22 In France, Alaunts were separated into three main categories, based on physical appearance and the duties they performed. The lightest type was the Alaunt Gentil, a greyhound-like dog, which eventually became assimilated into the local hunting breeds with the Alaunt Veantre. The original mastiff variety, known as the Alaunt de Boucherie, was crucial in the development of the fighting and baiting dogs of France. The Alaunt de Boucherie in France was known as the Alaunt Butchers in England and the Alano in Spain and Italy and were termed the original Bulldogs as they were used to control and defend herds of cattle. In Spain, the three categories were the Mastins, Alanos, and Lebrels, further separated as the ayuda (defense types) and the presa (offense types), such as the Perro de presa espa√±ol. Form Bocanegra, a portuguese Alaunt dog, 1904 The long, broad, flat head of the Alaunt should never be confused with the modified brachycephalic breeds. The brachycephalic head type is wide in base, but short in length. While the preferred bite is reverse scissor, like the Mastiff, (Mastiff is example of scissors reverse) and may have been a trait introduced by the Mongolian breeds at some remote time in history, skull type and bite type are separate subjects of genetic traits. The dolichocephalic skull is narrow at base yet long in length, so the Alaunt could be referred to as a modified dolichocephalic breed, as mesocephalic is a balance of base to length. Moreover, the Alaunt or Mastiff must be separated from the Molossoides in head study, as this term does not separate the Mastiff from the mountain dogs or even the Pug. Modern relatives British Alaunt Contemporary enthusiasts are developing new breeds based on Alaunt bloodlines, such as the British Alaunt, New Alaunt, Antebellum Bulldog or Altamaha Plantation Dog, Dogo Belgrado, Abraxas bulldog, bully kutta, gull dong and the American Alaunt. While its origins are strongly rooted in the ancient mountain dogs of the East, the Alaunt is regarded by some cynologists as the ancestor to the original bulldog breeds.

Festival (Portuguese: Festa do Avante!) is held named after the official newspaper of the Portuguese Communist Party. After taking part in different locations around Lisbon, like the FIL Park, Ajuda or Loures, it is now carried out in Amora, a town near Seixal in a ground bought by the Party after a massive fundraising campaign in the early 90s. The campaign was considered by the Party as the only way to avoid the boycott organised by the owners of the previous festivals grounds, that culminated in 1987 with the festival not being carried out after 11 editions. The festival is usually visited and participated in by hundreds of thousands of people, making the outside of the ground seem a gigantic camping park.

Several foreign communist parties also participate. In 28 editions, the Festival counted with the presence of several famous artists, either Portuguese or foreign, like Chico Buarque, Baden Powell, Ivan Lins, Buffy Sainte-Marie, Holly Near, Johnny Clegg, Charlie Haden, Judy Collins, Richie Havens, Tom Paxton, The Soviet Circus Company, the Kuban Cossacks Choir, Dexys Midnight Runners, The Band, Hevia, Adriano Correia de Oliveira, Carlos Paredes, Jorge Palma, Manoel de Oliveira and many others. The preparation of the party begins right after the end of the previous party. Hundreds of the party's members and friends, mostly young people, volunteer for the hard work of building a small town in a few months. Avante has the capacity for over 100,000 people. It tends to be at full capacity during the days of the festival.

Without parliamentary representation, it is a party that represents strict ultra- conservative Christian values. Unlike the more moderate Party of Bible-abiding Christians, the party's core values overlap with those of far-right ideology, emphasising anti-Semitism, national conservatism, anti-pluralism, anti-LGBT and ethnic collectivism. History The CM was founded on 27. August 1988 by Adelgunde Mertensacker after she was voted out of the German Centre Party. Mertensacker remained president of the party until she died on 12. October 2013, after which no new president was selected. During their active time, the party was largely unsuccessful, never receiving a municipal mandate, and never exceeding 0.2 % of votes in a European Parliament election. The CM explained their overall low popularity by the \\"moral decay in Europe\\" and that their political program was \\"too sophisticated\\". In February 2016, the party announced that it would no longer contest elections but instead would focus on political activism.

Creation  Jane was born when artist Norman Pett made a wager that he could create a comic strip as popular to adults as the strip Pip, Squeak and Wilfred was to children. Originally Pett's wife Mary modelled for him, but in the late 1930s, she abandoned modelling in pursuit of golf. Pett then teamed up with Chrystabel Leighton-Porter whom he met while she was modelling for a class in Birmingham in 1939. Characters and story Originally entitled Jane's Journal, Or the Diary of a Bright Young Thing, the salacious comic strip featured the misadventures of the title ingenue. The heroine had a habit of frequently (and most often inadvertently) losing her clothes. Her intimate confidant was a pet dachshund named Fritz. Her full name was Jane Gay, a play on the name Lady Jane Grey.In contemporary usage, \\"gay\\" referred to her cheerful, fun-loving character, with no implication of homosexuality. The strip became very popular during the Second World War and was considered morale-boosting, inspiring a similar American version, Milton Caniff's comic strip Male Call. Until 1943, Jane rarely stripped beyond her undergarments, but then she made a fully nude appearance when getting out of a bath and clumsily falling into the middle of a crowd of British soldiers.. Norman Pett's assistant Michael Hubbard continued, beginning in 1948, to develop the cartoon's original storyline until ending in 1959 ‚Äì with charmer Georgie giving Jane a happy marriage and ending the series. The Mirror tried to revive the character on several occasions. One such comic strip was Jane, Daughter of Jane, who was apparently the original's grown-up offspring, but she lacked her mother's charm and innocence. Another attempt was made during the 1980s. Recurring Characters *Jane Gay ‚Äì heroine and 'Queen of the Undie-World'. *Fritz ‚Äì Jane's faithful dachshund. *Georgie Porgie ‚Äì Jane's boyfriend. *The Colonel ‚Äì Jane's commanding officer and friend. *Lola Pagola ‚Äì Jane's arch- enemy, also a Nazi spy. *Thelma ‚Äì The Colonel's demanding and suspicious wife. *Dinah ‚Äì Jane's good friend. Dinah works with NAAFI. Jane visits America During 1945, King Features Syndicate attempted to distribute Jane in the United States.. However, the nudity was too much for prudish American audiences, and the attempt ceased during 1946.. Other comics in the tradition of, and possibly inspired by, Jane include Sally the Sleuth, Male Call and Little Annie Fanny.Jane at Don Markstein's Toonopedia. Archived from the original on 8 October 2016. Adaptations The strip inspired an eponymous stage play during the 1940s, with Leighton-Porter playing the character of Jane (see Jane on Stage). Chrystabel also featured in a 1949 movie, The Adventures of Jane, directed by Edward G. Whiting. A 1987 movie, Jane and the Lost City, starring Kirsten Hughes in the title role, was directed by Terry Marcel. A television series was made by the BBC between 1982 and 1984, featuring Glynis Barber in the title role. The first season was titled simply Jane, while the second was titled Jane in the Desert. Despite the early evening scheduling slot, the show was decidedly risqu√© with Jane continuously stripping down to her underwear, including stockings and suspenders. At the end of the second series' closing episode she appeared topless momentarily. Despite considerable publicity in the press at the time of its original screening, the show became somewhat obscure and has never had a commercial video or DVD release. The show was briefly revived during 1985 as a three-part sequence shown over a single morning on Breakfast Television but without Glynis Barber in the main role. Stage burlesque show During and after World War II, Chrystabel Leighton-Porter performed a striptease act as the character of Jane. In the war, it was compulsory for actors and entertainers to join ENSA (Entertainments National Service Association) whose job it was to organize entertainment for the troops, and although Chrystabel's audience were mainly soldiers, she was never asked by ENSA to perform on the front line. Chrystabel explained: The content of the act varied due to restrictions set in by local censors.

THORP is owned by the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority and operated by Sellafield Ltd (which is the site licensee company). Spent nuclear fuel from nuclear reactors is reprocessed to separate the 96% uranium and the 1% plutonium, which can be reused in mixed oxide fuel, from the 3% radioactive wastes, which are treated and stored at the plant. The uranium is then made available for customers to be manufactured into new fuel. On 14 November 2018 it was announced that operations had ended at THORP. The facility will be used to store spent nuclear fuel until the 2070s. History THORP's first fuel load in 1994 Construction of THORP started in the 1970s, and was completed in 1994. The plant went into operation in August 1997. Build cost was ¬£1.8 billion. Between 1977 and 1978 an inquiry was held into an application by British Nuclear Fuels plc for outline planning permission to build a new plant to reprocess irradiated oxide nuclear fuel from both UK and foreign reactors. The inquiry was to answer three questions: \\"1. Should oxide fuel from United Kingdom reactors be reprocessed in this country at all; whether at Windscale or elsewhere? 2. If yes, should such reprocessing be carried on at Windscale? 3. If yes, should the reprocessing plant be about double the estimated site required to handle United Kingdom oxide fuels and be used as to the spare capacity, for reprocessing foreign fuels?\\". The result of the inquiry was that the new plant, the Thermal Oxide Reprocessing Plant, was given the go-ahead in 1978, although it was not completed until the 1990s at a cost of ¬£1.8 billion. In 1998/99, the plant faced severe economic difficulties when it failed to reach its reprocessing targets. Shut-downs for six months in the first half of 1998 and for several further months from December 1998, due to leakages, resulted in a failure to achieve the target of reprocessing 900 tonnes of fuel over that period. Most of the reprocessing contracts were with Germany and Japan. On 14 November 2018 it was announced that operations had ended at THORP, now that all reprocessing contracts had been fulfilled. The facility will be used to store spent nuclear fuel until the 2070s. Plant demolition will take place after a period to allow radiation levels to decline, and is expected to occur between 2075 and 2095. The estimated cost of decommissioning is forecast as ¬£4 billion at 2018 prices. Design features The chemical flowsheet for THORP is designed to add less non-volatile matter to the first cycle PUREX raffinate, one way in which this is done is by avoiding the use of ferrous compounds as plutonium reducing agents. In this plant the reduction is done using either hydrazine or HAN (hydroxylamine nitrate). The plant releases gaseous emissions of krypton-85, a radioactive beta-emitter with a half-life of 10.7 years. The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII) commenced 24-hour atmospheric monitoring for krypton-85 in 1993, prior to the plant's commissioning. The cooled oxide fuel is chopped up in the Shear Cell and the fuel dissolved in nitric acid. It is chemically conditioned before passing to the chemical separation plant. Pulsed columns (designated HA/HS) are used to initially separate the majority of the uranium and plutonium from the fission products by transferring them into the solvent phase, which comprises tri-butyl phosphate in odourless kerosene (TBP/OK). The transfer is done in the HA column with the HS column providing further removal of fission products. 2 further pulsed columns (designated BS/BX) and a mixer/settler assembly (1BXX) then separate the uranium and plutonium into separate streams. Plutonium is reduced to the +3 oxidation state, which is insoluble in the solvent phase so ends up in the aqueous phase exiting the 1BX column. The 1BXX mixer/settler completes the removal of Pu from the solvent phase. The 1BS column removes any remaining Uranium from the aqueous phase by the use of fresh solvent. Pulsed columns then purify the plutonium, removing the troublesome fission products that remain. A mixer/settlet (1C) is used to transfer (washes) the uranium across to the aqueous phase ready for the next stage. Uranium purification is achieved using three mixer settlers (UP1 - UP3) similar to those in use on the existing Magnox reprocessing plant. Evaporation of the two product streams then occurs before further processing is undertaken. Uranium is converted to UO3 powder while the plutonium is converted to PuO2 powder and sent to storage. Pulsed columns were chosen to avoid the risk of a criticality incident occurring within the plant. This can happen if sufficient fissile material comes together to start an uncontrolled chain reaction, producing a large release of neutrons. The risks and mechanisms are well understood and the plant design is arranged to prevent its occurrence, i.e.: intrinsically safe. 2005 leak On 9 May 2005 it was announced that THORP suffered a large leak of a highly radioactive solution, which first started in July 2004. British Nuclear Group's board of inquiry determined that a design error led to the leak, while a complacent culture at the plant delayed detection for nine months. Operations staff did not discover the leak until safeguards staff reported major fluid accountancy discrepancies. Altogether 83 cubic metres (18,250 imperial gallons) of nitric acid solution leaked from a small fractured feedpipe, which was discovered when a remote camera was sent in to examine THORP's Feed Clarification Cell on 19 April 2005. All the fluids collected under gravity into the secondary containment, which is a stainless steel tub embedded in 2 metre thick reinforced concrete, capable of holding 250 cubic metres of fluids. The solution from the spill was estimated to contain 20 metric tons of uranium and 160 kilograms of plutonium. The leaked solution was safely recovered into primary containment using originally installed steam ejectors. Radiation levels in the cell preclude entry of humans and robotic repair of the fractured pipe is expected to be difficult. Officials are considering bypassing the faulty tank to resume operations. The pipe fractured due to lateral motion of an accountancy tank, which measures volume by weight and moves horizontally and vertically in the process. The tank's original design had restraint blocks to prevent lateral motion, but these were later removed from the design for seismic uncoupling. However it appears this design change was not evaluated for fatigue, and it is inconceivable a proper review would have permitted this change. The incident was classified as Level 3 out of 7 on the International Nuclear Event Scale (INES), a \\"serious incident\\", due to the amount of radioactive inventory that leaked from primary to secondary containment without discovery over a number of months. This was initially considered by BNFL to be surprisingly high, but the specifications of the scale required it. The British Nuclear Group was convicted for breaches of health and safety regulations following the accident, and fined ¬£500,000. Production eventually restarted at the plant in early 2008 but almost immediately had to be put on hold again, for the repair of an underwater lift that moves fuel for reprocessing.Geoffrey Lean, 'Shambolic' Sellafield in crisis again after damning safety report, The Independent, 3 February 2008.

He played seventeen seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a third baseman, most notably for the Montreal Expos from to . A five-time All-Star, Wallach excelled as an offensive and as a defensive player, winning 2 Silver Slugger Awards and 3 Gold Glove Awards. In addition to the Expos, he also played for the Los Angeles Dodgers and Los Angeles Angels and coached for the Dodgers and Miami Marlins. Early life Wallach was born in Huntington Park, California, grew up in Tustin in Orange County, and attended University High School in neighboring Irvine. There he played on the school's lower-level baseball team during his freshman and sophomore years before being promoted to the varsity team for his last two years. Wallach was not drafted by a major league team out of high school. He enrolled at Saddleback College and transferred to California State University, Fullerton to play college baseball for the Cal State Fullerton Titans. Wallach played for the United States national baseball team in the 1978 Amateur World Series. His stat-line in the series was .395/.455/.763, while having 14 runs and runs batted in (RBIs), both being the second-most in the series. The United States finished second to Cuba in the tournament. Wallach led the Titans to its first Division I title at the College World Series in Omaha in 1979, was named to the all-tournament team, and took the Golden Spikes Award. He was an All-American and named the Sporting News College Player of the Year. Career=Montreal Expos (1980‚Äì1992) Wallach made his major league debut at the age of 22 on September 6, 1980, against the San Francisco Giants after replacing Ron LeFlore at left field. In his first plate appearance in the top of the 5th inning, he was walked, but in his second plate appearance in the 8th, he hit a home run. Wallach and Brett Pill (September 6, 2011) are the only two players from Cal State Fullerton to hit a home run in their first at bat. Wallach appeared in four other games in that season. He appeared in 71 games in the following season, having 50 hits and 13 RBIs with a .236 batting average. He appeared in the postseason run with the Expos, appearing in five games. In Game 1 of the 1981 National League Division Series, he went 1-of-2 with a double and a walk while scoring a run. In the other four games that he appeared in, he went hitless. 1982 was his first full-time season, and he played in 158 games while having 160 hits, 28 home runs, 31 doubles, and 97 RBIs with a .268 batting average. He slightly regressed the following year, playing in 156 games while having 156 hits, 33 doubles, 19 home runs, and 70 RBIs with a .269 batting average. In 1984, Wallach played in 160 games with 143 total hits, 18 home runs, and 72 RBIs on a .246 batting average, but also had 101 strikeouts (a career high) while being named to the All-Star Game, his first. He improved the following year, playing in 155 games while also having 148 hits, 36 doubles, 22 home runs, 81 RBIs with a .260 batting average while also being selected to the All-Star Game once again. He was also awarded a Gold Glove and the Silver Slugger Award. He regressed a bit the next season, playing in 134 games while having 112 hits, 22 doubles, 18 home runs and 71 RBIs with a .233 batting average, although he led the league in being hit by pitch with 10. In 1987, Wallach was named to the All-Star Game once again while winning a Silver Slugger Award and finishing 4th in Most Valuable Player voting, doing so in 153 games while having 177 hits, 26 home runs, 42 doubles, and 123 RBIs with a .298 batting average, with the latter three being career highs. He regressed a bit the next season, having 152 hits, 32 doubles, 12 home runs and 69 RBIs with a .257 batting average in 159 games, although he did win the Gold Glove, his second. He rebounded in 1989, being named to the All-Star Game, playing in 154 games while getting 159 hits, 42 doubles, 13 home runs and 77 RBIs with a .277 batting average. He continued his success in 1990, playing in a career high 161 games while having 185 hits, 37 doubles, 21 home runs, 98 RBIs and a .296 batting average while being named to the All- Star Game and finishing 10th in MVP voting while winning the Gold Glove for the third and final time. He was named team captain prior to the 1991 season, being the first team captain in franchise history. He regressed in production in his final two seasons with the Expos, playing in 301 combined games while having a total of 250 hits, 51 doubles, 22 home runs and 132 RBIs while hitting under .230 both seasons. On December 24, 1992, he was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers for Tim Barker. Later career (1993‚Äì1996) Wallach played in 133 games for the Dodgers, getting 106 hits (his lowest since having 112 in 1986), with 19 doubles, 12 home runs and 62 RBIs with a .222 batting average. In the strike shortened 1994 season, he played in 113 games (out of 114 that the Dodgers played), having 116 hits, 21 doubles and 23 home runs (his highest since having 21 in 1990) with 78 RBIs and a .280 batting average. He finished 18th in MVP voting. He played in just 97 games for the Dodgers in 1995, having 87 hits (his lowest since having 50 in 1981) with 22 doubles, nine home runs and 38 RBIs and a .266 batting average. He appeared in the team's postseason run, playing in each game of the NLDS. He went 1-for-12, with no RBIs as the Dodgers were swept in three. After the season ended, he signed as a free agent with the California Angels. He played in 57 games with the team, having 45 hits, seven doubles, eight home runs and 20 RBIs with 47 strikeouts on a .237 batting average. He was granted free agency on July 19, 1996, signing with the Dodgers six days later. He played in 45 games while having 37 hits, three doubles, four home runs and 22 RBIs on a .228 batting average. He appeared in the postseason run, appearing in each game of the NLDS against the Atlanta Braves. He went 0-for-11 as they were swept. In his final regular season game on September 29, 1996, he went 1-for-4. In his final at bat (done in the 10th inning), he hit a single off Dario Veras of the San Diego Padres.

His full title was \\"His Holiness Abuna Paulos, Fifth Patriarch of the Orthodox Tewahido Church of Ethiopia, Ichege of the see of Saint Tekle Haymanot, Archbishop of Axum and one of the seven serving Presidents of the World Council of Churches.\\" Early life Abune Paulos was born in Adwa in Tigray Province; his birth name was Gebre Medhin Wolde Yohannes. His family was long associated with the Abba Garima Monastery near the town, and he entered the monastery as a young boy as a deacon trainee, eventually taking monastic orders and being ordained a priest. Then known as Abba Gebre Medhin, he continued his education at the Theological College of the Holy Trinity in Addis Ababa under the patronage of Patriarch Abune Tewophilos. He was sent to study at the St. Vladimir's Orthodox Theological Seminary in the United States, and afterwards joined the doctoral program at the Princeton Theological Seminary.Princeton University In 1974, his education was interrupted by a summons from Patriarch Abune Tewophilos, and returned to Addis Ababa shortly after the revolution that toppled Emperor Haile Selassie. He was anointed a bishop along with four others, assuming the name and style of Abune Paulos, and given responsibility for ecumenical affairs by the Patriarch. But because the Patriarch had named these new bishops without the permission of the new Derg communist junta, all five men were arrested, and the Patriarch was eventually executed. Abune Paulos and his fellow bishops were imprisoned until 1983. Abune Paulos returned to Princeton in 1984 to complete his doctoral degree there, and began his life as an exile. He was elevated to the rank of Archbishop by Patriarch Abune Takla Haymanot in 1986 while in exile. Patriarch  Following the fall of the Derg in 1991, the then Patriarch of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, Abuna Merkorios, was dethroned in circumstances that remain under dispute. Patriarch Abune Merkorios and his supporters maintain that he was forced from office by the new EPRDF-led government of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia and its supporters, while his opponents maintain that the Patriarch abdicated following numerous protests against him by the faithful. His attempt to reverse his abdication was refused by the Holy Synod of the Church which authorized a new Patriarchal election. Abune Paulos was elected in 1992, and Abune Merkorios and his supporters went into exile, establishing a rival synod in the United States. The enthronement of Abune Paulos as Patriarch was fully recognized by all the canonical Orthodox Christian Churches, including the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria Patriarchate in Alexandria, Egypt. During his office, much urban property that had been taken from the church was returned, most notably the return of the campus and the library of Holy Trinity Theological College, and the College was reopened. Abuna Paulos built a new Patriarchal office and residence complex at the site of the old one, and reformed the bureaucracy of the Patriarchate. He travelled widely, strengthening the ties of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church with other sister churches. He reluctantly acquiesced to the breaking away of the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church when that country declared independence. Abune Paulos also took the initiative to the series of peace meetings between all Ethiopian and Eritrean religious leaders in 1998, 1999 and 2000 in an effort to bring peace between the two countries in response to a bitterly fought border war. Patriarch Abune Paulos and the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church were extensively involved in the support of war-displaced and drought- hit Ethiopians, making the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church one of the major relief organizations in the country. In 1995, Abuna Paulos asked for the faithful to fulfill their religious obligations by contributing their share to the restoration of Holy Trinity Cathedral. He led a Fundraising Committee of 15 people which was established to work within the country and abroad on the project. The Patriarch continually championed the cause of the many victims of the Derg regime. Patriarch Abune Paulos presided over the funerals of Emperor Haile Selassie in 2000 (even in the face of government hostility to this event), Crown Prince Asfaw Wossen in 1997, and Princess Tenagnework in 2004. He also presided over the funerals of the 60 ex-officials of the Imperial government in 1993, and the funeral of the leading opposition leader of the time, Professor Asrat Woldeyes in 1998. Abuna Paulos also found success after he asked a British Museum to return ten \\"tabots\\" containing images of the Ark of the covenant. These carvings, supposedly so sacred that only ordained priests may look at them, were taken by British troops in 1868 during the rescue of the hostages imprisoned by the Emperor Tewdros.Tabots from the British Museum In March 2006, Abune Paulos was elected to serve as one of the seven presidents of the World Council of Churches, during its summit in Brazil. On 13 July 2007, Abune Paulos visited the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria in Egypt, met with Pope Shenouda III of Egypt. This visit re- established the relationship between the Ethiopian and Coptic Church after time of separation. Abune Paulos visited some of the Coptic associations in Egypt, and on 15 July, he visited a Coptic Egyptian Church named after an Ethiopian Saint Tekle Haymanot Coptic Orthodox Church in Alexandria, Egypt. Abune Paulos implemented a proposal to build a University in Entoto that would help to commemorate the millennium according to the Ethiopian calendar. This University is intended to be a study and research center in Entoto Debre Hayl Saint Raguel Church. The Holy Synod and Abune Paulos appealed for the faithful to protect church heritages with a view to enabling them to be transferred to the next generation. An act of Abune Paulos that caused much controversy was his advocacy of a pardon for the members of the Derg regime imprisoned in Ethiopia. The members of the Derg had asked the Patriarch to facilitate an opportunity for them to appear in the national press to ask for forgiveness from the people of Ethiopia for the errors and atrocities of their regime. The Patriarch approached the government with the idea that as the now aging members of the former communist junta were contrite and seeking forgiveness, the government should grant them clemency. On 1 June 2011, President Girma Wolde Giorgis of Ethiopia announced that the death sentences imposed on the top Derg members had been commuted to life sentences. As under Ethiopian law, a life sentence is equated to 25 years, both those previously sentenced to death and those imprisoned for life and lesser sentences were all immediately freed. This act immediately caused significant uproar among many of the survivors of Derg imprisonment, the family members of those killed during Derg rule and other opponents of Derg rule. The organization of survivors of victims of the Red Terror voiced their opposition and sent a letter of protest to the Patriarch. Members of the families of the 60 ex-officials of Emperor Haile Selassie's government executed without trial on November 23, 1974, as well as some members of the Imperial family met with Abune Paulos as well to make their views known. They believed that a commutation of death sentences to life imprisonment was not as objectionable, but that the release of people responsible for mass killings, torture, imprisonment without trial, and gross abuse of power was a great injustice. The Patriarch counseled these groups that it was the duty of Christians to forgive, especially those who voiced contrition. The groups opposed to the Derg pardon came away from the incident blaming Abune Paulos, but certain prominent members of the group, such as Mulugeta Aserate (son of Prince Aserate Kassa who was executed with the 60 ex- officials on 23 November 1974) wrote articles supporting the Patriarch's promotion of forgiveness and national reconciliation, and applauded the pardon. His ecumenical trip to India to meet Baselios Thoma Didymos I, Catholicos of the East in December 2008, strengthened the communion of Ethiopian and Indian Orthodox Churches. On 26 June 2009, the Italian press claimed that Abune Paulos along with a man claiming to be a son of the late Prince Makonnen, Duke of Harar and Duke Amedeo of Aosta, would come forward at the Hotel Aldrovandi in Rome with the announcement that the true Ark of the Covenant, which has supposedly been kept in secret at St. Mary's of Zion in Ethiopia, would be unveiled to the public to view for the first time in history in a museum being built in Axum. The announcement was never made; instead the Patriarch immediately denied that any such event had ever been planned. The person that the Italian press had identified as the Ethiopian Prince was subsequently revealed as not being a recognized member of the former Imperial family, but rather a person claiming to be the illegitimate son of the late prince. The involvement of the Duke of Aosta in the affair was also called into question. The cornerstone for a museum at Axum was indeed laid by Patriarch Abune Paulos, but there are no plans to display or house the Ark of the Covenant there. His attitude towards homosexual Ethiopians remains orthodox. In December 2008, he was one of nearly a dozen Ethiopian religious figures (including the leader of Ethiopian Muslim Majlis Council and the heads of the Protestant and Catholic churches) who adopted a resolution against homosexuality, urging Ethiopian lawmakers to endorse a ban on homosexual activity in the constitution. The religious figures attributed a rise in sexual attacks on children and young men to the vice of homosexuality. Abuna Paulos went on to say, \\"This is something very strange in Ethiopia, the land of the Bible that condemns this very strongly. For people to act in this manner they have to be dumb, stupid like animals. We strongly condemn this behaviour. They (homosexuals) have to be disciplined and their acts discriminated, they have to be given a lesson.\\" Death Abune Paulos died in Addis Ababa on 16 August 2012. The foreign ministry reported that he had been \\"receiving treatment over the past week for an undisclosed illness.\\" An opposition website, Ethiopian Review, reported that he had died of a heart attack. Lij Mulugeta Aserate Kassa, an adviser at the Ethiopian embassy in the United Kingdom, and a member of a cadet branch of Ethiopia's deposed Imperial family, noted that Abune Paulos had been in good health the previous day and had led a church service. He later felt ill and was taken to Balcha Hospital, according to an independent Orthodox website, Deje Selam, where he died early in the following morning. Although Lij Mulugeta said that he could not confirm the cause of death, Patriarch Abune Paulos was known to have suffered from hypertension and diabetes. Ethiopians were stunned to learn that Prime Minister Meles Zenawi had also died only four days after the Patriarch. Paulos was buried at Addis Ababa's Holy Trinity Cathedral on August 23, 2012. Several thousand people, as well as representatives from other churches, diplomats, and government officials, attended the state funeral. Achievements and awards Abune Paulos was a scholar and peace advocate and a former exile in the United States who has worked on reconciliation between Ethiopia and Eritrea. Patriarch Abune Paulos and the Ethiopian Orthodox Church were also involved in the support of war-displaced and drought-hit Ethiopians, making the Church one of the major \\"relief organisations\\" in the country. His peace efforts and humanitarian work were the main reasons for his being chosen to receive the Nansen Medal by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNCHR).Paulos profile and award On 30 December 2008, Abune Paulos was awarded the Order of St. Thomas (the highest honorary award given by Indian Orthodox Church) by Catholicos of the East HH Baselios Marthoma Didymos I at Parumala Seminary, India. Patriarch Abune Paulos also met with President Omar Hassan Al-Bashir of Sudan in Khartoum to try to find a peaceful solution to the Darfur conflict that has been labeled as a genocide by Western critics. Abune Paulos said ‚ÄúNo one loves Africa more than Africans.‚Äù The Patriarch stated that finding an \\"African solution\\" is significant to curb problems of the continent.Abune Paulos talks about Sudan He also held talks with senior government officials and religious leaders during his five-day working visit to Khartoum and called for religious leaders to strengthen their efforts towards peace. He served as a member of central committee of the World Council of Churches (WCC) and the Faith and Order commission, and attended the Nairobi assembly. Abune Paulos was one of the rare exceptionally educated Patriarchs in Ethiopian history because he had completed various degrees and received his doctoral degree at prestigious institutions. Abune Paulos was one of the seven presidents of WCC as well. Abune Paulos served as an Honorary President of Religions for Peace, the world's largest and most representative multi- religious coalition, advancing common action among the world's religious communities for peace. Abune Paulos was a Knight Grand Collar of The Order of The Eagle of Georgia and The Seamless Tunic of our Lord Jesus Christ,Order Distinguished Members an order of the Royal family of Georgia.

He was probably influenced by Sir William Constable later to become a regicide.Nan Overton West References Page 94 At the outbreak of the First English Civil War, he tried to join the army of Lord Ferdinando Fairfax, but no official positions were available. He was allowed to fight without any definite rank and distinguished himself in the defence of Hull and at the Battle of Marston Moor.Nan Overton West References Page 96Barbara Taft ODNB citing E. Ludlow, The Memoirs of Edmund Ludlow, ed. C. H. Firth, 2 vols., 1894, 1.65 and John Milton Complete Prose Works, 4, pt 1, 676 In August 1645 the governor of Pontefract, Sir Thomas Fairfax, appointed Overton deputy governor of Pontefract.Barbara Taft ODNB Shortly after this appointment Overton captured Sandal Castle. Overton was acting governor during the siege of Pontefract Castle; it was reported that he was inconsiderate to Lady Cutler and refused to let Sir Gervaise Cutler be buried in the church.Nan Overton West References page 60: Poulson used a diary of Nathan Drake, a royalist defender of Pontefract Castle and a political foe of Overton ref Having gained a commission in the New Model Army in July 1647, he was given command of the late Colonel Herbert's Regiment of Foot. During the political debates within the New Model Army he appeared as a member of the Army Council sitting on the committee for the duration of the Putney Debates. In March 1648, Fairfax appointed Overton deputy governor of Kingston upon Hull. There he became acquainted with notable puritan and poet Andrew Marvell, but was a very unpopular with the townsfolk. They were known to by sympathetic to the Royalist cause when in June 1648 the town Mayor and some of the town council petitioned for his removal. The sources differ as to his actions during Second English Civil War, but one historian concluded that he spent the war in Hull, while another that he fought with Oliver Cromwell in Wales and the North of England, capturing the Isle of Axholme; that he was also with Cromwell when Charles I was taken to the Isle of Wight. Overton enthusiastically supported the trial of the King in late 1648 and early 1649, but wrote that he only wanted him deposed and not executed. He disagreed with other points of policy of the early Commonwealth government publishing his position in a pamphlet titled \\"The declaration of the officers of the garrison of Hull in order to the peace and settlement of the kingdom\\" and accompanying letter to Thomas Fairfax, in early January.English dissenters: levellers The letter makes it clear that he supported actions like Pride's Purge if the \\"corrupt Commons\\" stopped the Army's reforms. Barbara Taft reflected in the last six pages of the declaration the case made in the RemonstranceFull title: \\"Remonstrance of his Excellency Thomas Lord Fairfax, Lord Generall of the Parliaments Forces. And of the Generall Councell of Officers Held at St. Albans the 16. of November, 1648\\" by the New Model Army to Parliament, the rejection of which had triggered Pride's Purge: > a speedy end to the present parliament; a succession of free biennial > parliaments with an equitable distribution of seats; future kings elected by > the people's representatives and having no negative voice; a ‚Äòuniversal and > mutual Agreement, ‚Ä¶ enacted and decreed, in perpetuum‚Äô, that asserts that > the power of parliament is ‚Äòinferior only to that of the people‚ÄôDeclaration > of the Officers of the Garrison of HullBarbra Taft citing The Declaration of > the Officers of the Garrison of Hull, 1 March 1649, 4, 15,16 As divisions within the New Model Army widened during the Summer of 1649, fear spread that that disunity would be exploited by their enemies, Overton issued a letter that made it clear that he sided with the Rump Parliament and the Grandees against the Levellers. When the Third Civil War broke out in 1650 he accompanied Cromwell to Scotland and commanded a Foot Brigade at the Battle of Dunbar his regiment was also involved in the English Parliamentary victory at the Battle of Inverkeithing (20 July 1651) where Colonel Overton commanded the reserve.Nan Overton West References Page 60 When New Model Army returned to England in pursuit of the invading Royalist Scottish army, Overton remained in Scotland as governor of Edinburgh. He helped complete the subjugation of Scotland and commanded an expedition to reduce the garrison forces on Orkney. On 14 May 1652 a grateful Parliament voted Scottish lands to him with an annual income of 400 pounds sterling per year. In December 1652, when George Monck's successor Richard Deane was recalled, the General appointed him as Military Commander over all English forces in the Western Highlands with the governorship of Aberdeen, the senior rank of Major-General. On his father's death in 1653 he returned to England inheriting the family estates in Easington as eldest son and heir. At the same time he resumed duties as Governor of Hull. During 1650 he and his wife had become members of the \\"church\\": in retrospect he considered the execution of Charles I as a fulfilment of the fundamentals of Old Testament scripture so often cited in Ezekiel 21:26-27: > \\"Thus saith the Lord GOD; Remove the diadem, and take off the crown: this > shall not be the same: exalt him that is low, and abase him that is high. I > will overturn, overturn, overturn, it: and it shall be no more, until he > come whose right it is; and I will give it him.\\"Ezekiel 21:26-27 concerning the humble and the meek, exorcised by God in \\"overturning\\" the established order. Overton wrote: \\"the Lord...is forced to shake and shake and overturn and overturn; this is a shaking, overturning dispensation.\\" Some sources promoted the belief he was a Fifth Monarchist, but his views seemed to have spanned several of the religious beliefs and political grouping of the day and it is difficult to label him as belonging to any one group. He hailed Cromwell's dissolution of the Rump Parliament in June 1653, yet subsequently became disenchanted, suspicious of Cromwell as more dictator than Lord Protector. Although his letters to Cromwell remained cordial, during the early years of the Protectorate he seems to have become more inclined to distance himself from the Lord Protector, advising a diminution with the speed of reform. Cromwell informed him that he could keep his position in the army so long as he promised to relinquish his office when he could no longer support the policies of the Protectorate. In September 1654 he returned to his command in Scotland, a conveniently long distance from GHQ in London. There he planned a coup d'√©tat; in December 1654, Overton was arrested and imprisoned in the Tower for his part in the self-styled \\"Overton Revolt\\". It was alleged that a verse in Overton's handwriting was found amongst his papers: He was accused of planning a military insurrection against the government and plotting to assassinate Monck. It is not clear how involved he was in the plot, but he was good friends with Monck at the time, so it was unlikely he was involved. But whatever his real position he was considered too lenient with his \\"disaffected officers\\" in sanctioning their meetings and there was evidence that he held meetings with John Wildman, an incorrigible Leveller plotter, prepared to use anyone to bring down the government. Later while in the Tower of London, he wrote to others informing them of Wildman's plans. At the time a fellow prisoner wrote of Overton, \\"He was a great independent, civil and decent, a scholar, but a little pedantic.\\"In 1655 Cromwell was convinced enough of his guilt to have him removed from the governorship of Hull and to confiscate the lands granted to him by Parliament in Scotland handing them back to Earl of Leven the owner before they were sequestrated.House of Commons Journal Volume 7 29 July 1659 Overton remained incarcerated in the Tower until March 1658 when he was moved to Elizabeth Castle on the island of Jersey. Barbara Taft mentions that \\"It is not unlikely that respect for Overton's ability and fear of his appeal as an opposition leader played a major role in his imprisonment.\\" After Cromwell's death and the re-installation of the Commonwealth, Grizelle, his sister, his wife Anne, her brother, and many Republicans, presented his case to Parliament, on 3 February 1659, along with letters from Overton's close friend John Milton. Overton and John Milton probably became acquainted from an early moment in their careers in St Giles, Cripplegate, where they removed and lived for a time. Milton considered Overton a scholar and celebrated him and his exploits in his \\"Defensio Secundo\\" by writing: > \\"...bound to me these many years past in friendship of more than brotherly > closeness and affection, both by the similarity of our tastes and the > sweetness of your manners.\\" Milton also included Overton in his list of \\"twelve apostles of revolutionary integrity.\\" After hearing his case on 16 March 1659, Parliament ordered Overton's release pronouncing his imprisonment illegal. Overton's return was called \\"his greatest political triumph; a huge crowd, bearing laurel branches, acclaimed him and diverted his coach from its planned path.\\" In June 1659 he was restored to a command and further compensated for his losses. Charles II wrote him promising forgiveness for past disloyalty and rewarded him for services in effecting the restoration. Overton was appointed governor of Hull and again was unpopular, many referring to him as \\"Governor Overturn,\\" because of his association with the Fifth Monarchists who used the phrase liberally. This perception was reinforced by the sermons of John Canne, a well known Fifth Monarchist preacher in Overton's regiment at Hull.House of Commons Journal Volume 7 13 July 1659Mentions a well known Fifth Monarchist preacher in Robert Overton regiment at Hull called John Canne On 12 October 1659 he was one of seven major-generals in whom Parliament vested the government of the army until January 1660.House of Commons Journal Volume 7 12 October 1659 Seven Army CommissionersNan Overton West References Pages 98 and 99 By early 1660, Overton's position started to diverge from that of Monck, as he did not support the return of Charles II, yet he and his officers refused to aid Generals Lambert and Fleetwood. Seeking to mediate published an exhortation to them to maintain the Lord's cause, entitled \\"The Humble Healing Advice of R.O.\\" The ambiguity implicit by his of conduct described in letters to troops stationed in Yorkshire caused Monck much embarrassment. As a result, Monck requested Lord Thomas Fairfax order him to take any order he gave. On 4 March 1660, a day after Lambert's arrest, Monck ordered Overton to surrender his command to Fairfax and come to London. Overton planned a stand, but he must have seen that defeat would have been inevitable. Hull's disaffection for him and some division among the garrison caused him to allow himself to be replaced by Thomas Fairfax's son, Charles Fairfax. The Garrison in Hull began the English Civil War as the first town to resist Charles I and was among the last to accept his son Charles II. After 1642 no monarch would set foot in Hull for over 200 years. Overton was an independent and a republican. He was regarded, perhaps falsely, as one of the Fifth Monarchists, and at the first rumour of insurrection was arrested and sent to the Tower of London in December 1660, where Samuel Pepys went to see him writing in his diary that Overton had been found with a large quantity of arms. Pepys recorded that Overton had told him that the arms were brought to London to sell.Pepys on Robert Overton Sunday 16 December 1660 Overton was briefly at liberty in the Autumn of 1661. Realising that he might be re-arrested at any moment, he spent time arranging his financial and personal affairs. He issued a series of deeds to make provision for his mother, his wife and family and to avoid confiscation of his property by the Crown. Most of his properties were sold to his family, to his sons Ebenezer and Fairfax and his daughter Joanna, and close friends. The last documents were executed on 7 November 1661 and on 9 November 1661 he was sent to Chepstow Castle. He managed a short interval of freedom but was again arrested on 26 May 1663 on \\"suspicion of seditious practices and for refusing to sign the oaths or give security.\\" As Andrew Marvell, the English Satirist, wrote in a letter to John Milton, > \\"Col. Overton [was] one of those steady Republicans whom Cromwell was unable > to conciliate and was under the necessity of security.\\"Nan Overton West > References Page 100 In 1664 the government sent him to Jersey, the second time he had been imprisoned there and this time it was to be for seven years. During this time he was allowed out and about on the island which was not uncommon for high- ranking political prisoners. Overton spent the years of his incarceration in Mont Orgueil Castle trying to establish his freedom. In a 370-page manuscript of letters, meditations and poetry to his beloved wife's memory and about religious subjects was the manuscript \\"Gospell Observations & Religious Manifestations &c.;\\",Nan Overton West References page 100, The manuscript is now held by the Department of Rare Books and Special Collections of Princeton University He remained a prisoner on Jersey until early December 1671 when he was released to his brother-in-law by a warrant signed by Charles II. He returned to England and lived his last years with or near his daughters and probably two sons in Rutland.Nan Overton West References Page 112: another source states Overton was held captive on Jersey until 1668 Overton's will is dated 23 June 1678, aged 69, Nan Overton West records that he was buried on 2 July 1678 in Seaton churchyard, overlooking the Welland Valley and Rockingham Castle while Barbra Taft writes that he was buried in the New Churchyard, Moorfields, London.

They went on to have several more children. \\"This is unclear. Did he marry someone before or after Constance Monkton?\\" The Easington estate was passed to John when Robert was imprisoned for the second time, to stop it being sequestered by the crown. Two leases to John dated 1 November 1661 and 7 November 1661, put the estate in lease to John for 99 years, and the ultimate benefit of Ebenezer (Benjamin) and Fairfax, the only other two sons alive at that time. That is why John is not mentioned in his father's will. The South Aisle of the All Saints Church in Easington contains The Lady Chapel.

It originates in the marshlands of the Delta del Po in the eastern part of the Romagna sub-region of Italy. The name derives from , meaning \\"water dog\\". Its traditional function was as a gundog, specifically a water retriever; since the drainage of large areas of wetland habitat in its area of origin, it is now more often used to hunt for truffles.  History  The Meeting by Andrea Mantegna circa 1474 The Lagotto is a breed of water retriever from the lowlands of Comacchio and marshlands of Ravenna, Italy. Modern water retrieving dog breeds are believed to have descended in part from the Lagotto Romagnolo. Andrea Mantegna in the 1474 work titled \\"The Meeting\\" depicts a small dog in the lower left corner that resembles a Lagotto. It was provisionally accepted by the F√©d√©ration Cynologique Internationale in 1995, and received full acceptance in 2005. In 2018 the Ente Nazionale della Cinofilia Italiana recorded 2207 new registrations.  Characteristics  A female Lagotto The Lagotto is of small to medium size, rarely over at the withers, powerfully built and of rustic appearance. It is roughly square in outline, the body length more or less equal to the height. The coat is thick, wool-like and tightly curled into ringlets. It may be completely off-white, or off-white with orange or brown patches or roaning, or solid orange or brown either with or without white markings. A Lagotto usually lives for about fifteen years. Neurological disorders that have been identified in the breed include cerebellar abiotrophy and idiopathic epilepsy.

The facility was partly demolished in 2002. Buick City was a massive automobile manufacturing complex in the northeast of Flint, Michigan.History of Buick 1909-1959 Elements of the complex dated from 1904, where all aspects of Buick vehicles were constructed, and it became known as Buick City in 1985. Operations ceased completely in 2010. The site was vacated by GM employees and site responsibilities were transferred to Motors Liquidation Company as of December 6, 2010. The final cars built at Buick City were the Pontiac Bonneville and the Buick LeSabre. Manufacturing operations were transferred to Orion Assembly. The original factory at one time was the largest in the world, consisting of 24 separate buildings contributing to the manufacturing process,Buick Factory with original photos and descriptions until 1928 when the Ford River Rouge Plant was completed and began operations. In the beginning, all components were manufactured in one location, to include wheel bearings, nuts, bolts, and screws, to transmissions, suspension components, wheels and interior components. Operations were carried out in this fashion well into the 1940s and beyond. After World War II, when vehicle production resumed, Buick City was the primary location where all components were created, with Knock-down kits distributed to assembly plants in major metropolitan US cities, where the vehicles were locally assembled and distributed in their respective regions. The plant originated with Buick before the formation of General Motors. Other elements were built by early manufacturers and suppliers like Fisher Body. The Buick City concept represented a successful attempt by General Motors to experiment with just-in- time manufacturing methods in response to Japanese manufacturers. The experiment included successes: The 1989 Buick LeSabre built in Buick City was ranked the top car in the J.D. Power and Associates rankings for that year; it was the first American built car to appear on the list. In 1999, the year the plant was closed, Buick City won J. D. Power's Platinum Award for assembly plant quality . The plant closed on June 29, 1999. As of 2016, it is the only General Motors plant to win the award. The closing of GM's manufacturing plants in Flint, and its subsequent economic toll on the community was chronicled in Michael Moore's documentary film, Roger & Me. The plant's acreage became an EPA cleanup site . In 2013, American Cast Iron Pipe Company announced plans to construct a new 200,000 square foot manufacturing plant on the former Buick City complex.

It is sold under the brand names Nitoman and Xenazine among others. On August 15, 2008, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the use of tetrabenazine to treat chorea associated with Huntington's disease. Although other drugs had been used \\"off label,\\" tetrabenazine was the first approved treatment for Huntington's disease in the U.S.1st US drug for Huntington's disease wins approval The compound has been known since the 1950s. Medical uses Tetrabenazine is used as a treatment, but not as a cure, for hyperkinetic disorders such as: *Huntington's disease ‚Äì specifically, the chorea associated with it *Tourette syndrome and other tic disorders *Tardive dyskinesia, a serious and sometimes irreversible side effect of long-term use of many antipsychotics, mainly typical antipsychotics *Hemiballismus, spontaneous flinging limb movements due to contra-lateral subthalamic nucleus damage Side effects The most common adverse reactions, which have occurred in at least 10% of subjects in studies and at least 5% greater than in subjects who received placebo, have been: sedation or somnolence, fatigue, insomnia, depression, suicidal thoughts, akathisia, anxiety and nausea. Warnings There is a boxed warning associated with the use of tetrabenazine: *Increases the risk of depression and suicidal thoughts and behavior in patients with Huntington's disease *Balance risks of depression and suicidality with the clinical need for control of chorea when considering the use of tetrabenazine *Monitor patients for emergence or worsening of depression, suicidality or unusual changes in behavior *Inform patients, caregivers and families of the risk of depression and suicidality and instruct to report behaviours of concern promptly to the treating physician *Exercise caution when treating patients with a history of depression or prior suicide attempts or ideation *Tetrabenazine is contraindicated in patients who are actively suicidal and in patients with untreated or inadequately treated depression Pharmacology The precise mechanism of action of tetrabenazine is unknown. Its anti-chorea effect is believed to be due to a reversible depletion of monoamines such as dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, and histamine from nerve terminals. Tetrabenazine reversibly inhibits vesicular monoamine transporter 2, resulting in decreased uptake of monoamines into synaptic vesicles, as well as depletion of monoamine storage.

Their self-titled debut, Armageddon, was recorded in England and released in the United States on A&M; Records. The albums' original liner notes use the term \\"supergroup\\", as their personnel were drummer Bobby Caldwell (previously a member of Captain Beyond), singer Keith Relf (who had fronted the band Yardbirds and was a co- founder of Renaissance), guitarist Martin Pugh (from Steamhammer), and bassist Louis Cennamo (also formerly of Renaissance and Steamhammer). History Keith Relf had helped with post production of the final Steamhammer LP, Speech, in 1971/72. Steamhammer's dissolution took place the same year of the album's release, as they had undergone numerous personnel changes since their inception, not the least of which was the death of drummer Mick Bradley in February 1972. The remaining Steamhammer alumni, Pugh and Cennamo, shared a flat and were asked by Keith Relf to move to Los Angeles with him early in 1974 with a view of forming a new band. They set out to recruit a drummer and happened across Bobby Caldwell (who had also been suggested to the band by Aynsley Dunbar) at The Rainbow in Hollywood; they began rehearsing together in late 1974/early 1975. Cennamo's old friend, Peter Frampton, was also now in Los Angeles and helped them to make contact with his management and record label. Armageddon was managed initially by Dee Anthony (Peter Frampton, Humble Pie, and Emerson, Lake & Palmer) and later Jerry Weintraub (Frank Sinatra, Bob Dylan), but the band never toured (they played only 2 live shows during their existence: in July 1975 at the Starwood in Hollywood, CA), so it is likely they were negatively impacted by the consequent reduced exposure level and record sales. Break-up In a 2001 interview, drummer Caldwell mentioned that the band's management became increasingly more difficult to communicate with; consequently they were not being promoted properly. Bassist Cennamo stated in liner notes of the CD re-release of the album on the Repertoire label in 1999 that Caldwell and Pugh's drug problems (heroin) had created difficulties within the band, which apparently ran at cross purposes with the fact that the record received good reviews and significant FM radio attention, and was selling reasonably well. Cennamo also states that Relf's long-time asthma problems were turning into emphysema (making it increasingly hard for Relf to draw air into his lungs to sing), and the band had dissolved many months prior to the sudden death of Keith Relf in May 1976. Post- Armageddon After Armageddon folded, bassist Cennamo reunited with his Renaissance bandmates under the name Illusion, and later worked with Jim McCarty in the bands Stairway and Renaissance Illusion. Drummer Caldwell returned to Captain Beyond for an album and tour. There was an attempt in the 80's by Pugh and Caldwell to re-form the band, as they had secured some interest from Capitol Records ‚Äî vocalist Jeff Fenholt was auditioned for the band, but was eventually found to be musically unsuitable. Further auditions did not result in an acceptable replacement, and the idea to reform was shelved. Apart from that, guitarist Pugh appears to have retired from music after 1975, though he did emerge to play guitar on sessions alongside American rock guitarist Geoff Thorpe of Vicious Rumors in American band 7th Order on their debut CD, The Lake of Memory, released on the Big Island Sounds label in 2007.

The creator of the Metodo tactical formation, Pozzo is regarded as one of the greatest managers of all time, and is the first person to guide a national team to two FIFA World Cup titles as coach, leading the Italy national team to victory in the 1934 and 1938 FIFA World Cups. Nicknamed Il Vecchio Maestro (\\"The Old Master\\"), he also led Italy to a gold medal at the 1936 Olympic football tournament, and managed the Italian championship squads of the 1930 and 1935 editions of the Central European International Cup. Early life, playing career, and early coaching career Vittorio Pozzo was born in Turin on 2 March 1886, into a family originally from Ponderano. He attended the Liceo Cavour in Turin, his hometown; he later studied languages and played football in France, Switzerland and England. He studied in Manchester at the turn of the 20th century and met Manchester United half-back Charlie Roberts and Derby County's inside-left Steve Bloomer. As a player, he played professionally in Switzerland for Grasshopper Club Z√ºrich the 1905‚Äì06 season, before returning to Italy where he helped found Torino F.C. (then \\"Foot-Ball Club Torino\\"), a team with which he played for five seasons until retiring from football in 1911. He would serve as the technical director of Torino from 1912 to 1922. After completing his studies, he joined Pirelli, where he became manager, a position he would leave for the Italian national team. Until the 1912 Summer Olympics, the Italy national team was guided by \\"technical commissions\\", when Pozzo was appointed as the first head coach of the national team during the debut for an Italian selection in an official competition. Italy was eliminated in the first round after a 3‚Äì2 loss to Finland in extra time, on 29 June. Pozzo resigned after his third match, being defeated 5‚Äì1 by Austria in the consolation tournament, on 3 July. He returned to work at Pirelli; only to return to the national team in 1921 as part of a \\"technical commission\\", a committee composed of federal managers, referees, players, former players, coaches and journalists. Throughout his first term, the national team was guided by this diverse group of people. With the brief exception of Augusto Rangone (in 1925‚Äì1928) and Carlo Carcano (1928‚Äì1929), Pozzo was the only person to play the role of sole commissioner until the sixties. Pozzo would also serve with the Alpini as lieutenant during the First World War. In 1921, Pozzo was commissioned by the Football Association to study a draft reform of the league to address the tensions between the bigger and the smaller teams, because it was thought that the number of participants in the championship had to be reduced. The mediation failed resulting in the split between the FIGC and CCI, before merging again the following year. In 1924, for the occasion of the 1924 Summer Olympics, Pozzo was again appointed sole head coach. This time Italy were able to reach the quarter-finals, where they were defeated 2‚Äì1 by Switzerland. After this defeat, Pozzo resigned and returned to devote himself to his work and his wife, who shortly after died due to a disease. After the death of his wife, he moved to Milan, where he held his job at Pirelli, alongside his work as a journalist for La Stampa in Turin, which he continued almost until his death. Successes with Italy during the 1930s Pozzo (left), Italy's manager at the 1934 FIFA World Cup, gives directions to Monzeglio and Bertolini before the start of extra-time in the victorius final versus Czechoslovakia Pozzo returned to coach the Italy national team on a permanent basis in December 1929. Italy won the 1930 edition of the Central European International Cup, defeating Hungary 5‚Äì0 in Budapest. They pipped the title from Meisl's Austrian side, the so-called Wunderteam, who went on to win the second edition of the tournament two years later. Following the 1930 defeat to Spain, Pozzo left Adolfo Baloncieri, who had served as Italy captain and who had been an international of ten years standing, out the team. In the 1932 edition of the Central European International Cup, Italy finished in second place behind Austria; Austria beat Italy, as did the Czechs, while a defeat to Hungary was only averted because of a missed penalty. This led to Pozzo bringing back the Bologna player Angelo Schiavio, who had been a regular goalscorer for his club, but in February 1934 with the World Cup looming Austria defeated Italy in Turin 4‚Äì2, Pozzo once again axed the team's captain, Umberto Caligaris, on this occasion. During the 1934 FIFA World Cup on home soil, the first tournament on the European continent, Pozzo's Italian side benefited from controversial officiating, which was thought to have been influenced by the political situation in Italy at the time; indeed, the Italian fascist dictator Benito Mussolini had apparently met with several officials prior to Italy's matches, including Ivan Eklind, who refereed Italy's semi-final and final victories. Eklind was later accused of favouring the Italians with his decisions. Italy's game against Spain in the quarter-finals, which ended in a 1‚Äì1 draw after extra-time, also raised questions against the performance of the referee Louis Baert in the match; in the replay, Swiss referee Rene Mercet did not escape criticism either, and was banned by the Swiss FA upon his arrival home. Both matches were played in a highly aggressive manner, with several players of both sides injured as a result of the extremely physical play: a foul on goalkeeper Ricardo Zamora for the equaliser in the first leg went unpunished, which ruled him out of the replay, while another on his replacement Joan Josep Nogu√©s in the replay was also ignored; at least three Spaniards had to depart the field with injuries. The Italian Mario Pizziolo also suffered a broken leg at the hand of the Spaniards in the first leg, and would not play for the Italian national team again. Italy's 1‚Äì0 victory in the replay ultimately earned them a place in the semi-finals. Italy also benefited from the quarter-final draw between Hungary and Austria, which saw Austria prevail 2‚Äì1 in a highly competitive encounter. By the time of the semi-final, Johann Horvath was absent through injury, and Italy won the match over Austria by a single goal. Enrique Guaita, one of the squad's Oriundi, scored the only goal of the match from close range after Giuseppe Meazza had fallen over goalkeeper Peter Platzer. In the final on 10 June, at the Stadio Nazionale PNF in Rome, with temperatures surpassing , Italy came from behind to defeat Czechoslovakia 2‚Äì1 in extra-time to win the title. On the back of the World Cup success, Pozzo was awarded the title of Commendatore for achieving greatness in his profession. Pozzo also coached Italy in the Battle of Highbury on 14 November 1934 against England, led by Arsenal's Wilf Copping at the team's home ground, which ended 3‚Äì2 in favour of England. Italy defended their Central European International Cup title in 1935 under Pozzo, going into the 1936 Summer Olympics on the back of a run which had seen them lose only to Austria and England; they went on to win the gold medal in the tournament, defeating Austria 2‚Äì1 in extra time. By the time of the 1938 World Cup in France, Italy remained undefeated in recent competitions under Pozzo. Silvio Piola earned his first cap in 1935, scoring regularly for the national side and proving an effective partner for Meazza. In the quarter-finals against the hosts in Colombes, as both teams normally played in blue, Italy were controversially ordered to play in all-black attire (possibly by Mussolini himself), a colour which is associated with fascism, along with bearing a Fascio Littorio on the left breast, alongside the Savoy shield. Despite a hostile reception from the home crowd, Italy managed to win the match 3‚Äì1 and advance to the next round. Following the match, Pozzo learned that the Brazilians were so confident of appearing in the final in Paris that they had requisitioned the only airplane from Marseilles to Paris on the day after the semi-final against Pozzo's Italy. Pozzo went to the Brazilians that sunbathed in the C√¥te d'Azur and asked them to surrender him the aerial bookings in case of an Italian victory. The Brazilians apparently arrogantly answered \\"it is not possible because we will go to Paris, because we will beat you in Marseilles\\". They then reportedly offered Pozzo the ironic hospitality of a plane ride to Paris to see them play in the final. Pozzo reported to the Italian side what the Brazilians had told him to rouse the pride of the players. It was the psychological premise for revenge in the match, which Italy went on to win 2‚Äì1. Afterwards, the Brazilians did not want to sell their plane tickets to the Italians, who were then forced to reach Paris by train. In the resulting final, Italy duly won their second world title 4‚Äì2 against Hungary. There is a common legend that the Italian fascist dictator Benito Mussolini sent a telegram to the Italian team prior to the final, stating: \\"Win or die!\\"; however, Pietro Rava later denied this, commenting: \\"No, no, no, that's not true. He sent a telegram wishing us well, but no never 'win or die'.\\" With the 1938 World Cup victory, Pozzo became the only manager to win two editions of the FIFA World Cup. Between 1938 and 1939, Pozzo held the record for most consecutive wins for Italy, with nine, until the record was eventually broken in 2019 by Roberto Mancini. From 24 November 1935 against Hungary until 20 July 1939 against Finland, Pozzo also led Italy on a record 30-match unbeaten streak. Later coaching career (1939‚Äì1948) During World War II, Pozzo remained in position throughout the hostilities. At the 1948 Summer Olympics, Pozzo's last match as Italy head coach came as a 5‚Äì3 defeat to Denmark in the quarter-finals at Highbury Stadium in London. Pozzo finished with a record 63 wins, 17 draws and 16 defeats from 95 matches (an additional two wins are recorded as part of a technical commission in 1921). He holds the record for the longest reign of any European men's senior national team coach. His last, excruciating, official act, in 1949, was helping with the recognition of the torn bodies of the players of the Grande Torino team, his friends and pupils, who died on May 4 in the Superga air disaster from which he escaped himself for not being able to go with the team to Lisbon. Later life, death, and legacy (1949‚Äì1968) Pozzo became a journalist with La Stampa after retiring from football management, resuming a career he had worked in prior to his successes as coach of Italy. He reported on the 1950 FIFA World Cup as part of his work covering Italian national team matches. After watching Italy win the 1968 European Football Championship on home soil, the successor to the Central European International Cup title, which he had won twice with the Azzurri, Pozzo died later that year, on 21 December, at the age of 82. He is buried in the cemetery of his family's hometown, Ponderano. In 1986, the Stadio Communale di Torino was renamed after Pozzo in his honour; the stadium is now known as the Stadio Olimpico Grande Torino. In 2016, a museum featuring his memorabilia in Ponderano was inaugurated in his honour. Style of management and tactics: the Metodo system The Metodo of Vittorio Pozzo Until the 1930s, a common tactic in football was the so-called pyramid of Cambridge, which is a 2‚Äì3‚Äì5 in the shape of inverted pyramid that had its apex in the Keeper. The design of this scheme is given to the team of the famous British university, and its launch is due to Blackburn Rovers, who applied it for the first time in the 1890s, and winning five league cups. For over 30 years this form experienced uninterrupted luck in the British Isles and, by extension, the world. In the years after World War I, by evolution, from the pyramid, two tactical systems originated simultaneously: the WM, or 'sistema', practiced by the Arsenal side of Herbert Chapman, and the 'metodo', whose fathers are commonly identified as Vittorio Pozzo and his friend and rival Hugo Meisl, who served as the manager of the Austria national football team for 25 years. Pozzo and Meisl developed the idea of an array with two defenders as full-backs and a player in a central position in front of the defence, between the two half-backs, who effectively functioned as a central or defensive midfielder, who was a key component of the system; this position was known as that of the centre-half- back, or centromediano metodista in Italian, and was seen as a precursor to the regista or deep-lying playmaker role, as the metodista's responsibilities in Pozzo's system were not entirely defensive but also creative. As such, the metodista was not solely tasked with breaking down possession, but also with starting attacking plays after winning back the ball. Compared to the sistema, the forward displacement of the central defender gave more support to the half-backs. Finally, the retreat towards the median of the two 'inside forwards' of the pyramid (also called \\"mezzali,\\" or \\"half-wings,\\" in Italian ‚Äì not to be confused with wing half-backs) gave rise to a formation of the type 2‚Äì3‚Äì2‚Äì3, or \\"WW\\", because it repeated the form of these letters on the field. The metodo system was well‚Äìsuited to highly technical teams whose strategies were predominantly based on a slower game made up of possession and much short passing on the ground, in contrast to the English sistema, which favoured faster, more aggressive, and athletic gameplay. Pozzo was also known to be a pioneer in his use of pre-tournament training camps. Oriundi The other matter that Pozzo benefited from was 'oriundi' (that is foreign-born Italian 'nationals') which permitted Italy to take advantage of those players from other countries who could claim some type of Italian ancestry. In the 1930s he was able to call on Luis Monti, a midfielder who had appeared for Argentina in their 1930 FIFA World Cup Final defeat to Uruguay, and who was an important part of the success of the Italian team in the 1934 World Cup. In response to the criticisms surrounding his decision to call upon oriundi players in the victorious World Cup of 1934, he said: \\"If they can die for Italy, they can also play for Italy\\", referring to the fact that they had also served in the Italian army. He was also a fan of Raimundo Orsi, an Argentinian from Buenos Aires after an undistinguished stint in the Argentinian shirt. Orsi, never a prolific goalscorer, would reward Pozzo's faith with a goal in the 1934 World Cup final. Not that he dispensed with home-grown talent, but his penchant for attacking play is demonstrated by the fact that as well as Schiavio, Pozzo was successful in converting Giuseppe Meazza, who was captain in 1938, from a striker into an inside forward; indeed Pozzo's reign is linked closely to the success of his strikers. In the 1938 World Cup another 'oriundo' was the Uruguayan Michele Andreolo. Political views and fascist salute controversy Brian Glanville has stated that Pozzo was not a fascist; he did, however, work alongside Giorgio Vaccaro during the 1934 World Cup campaign ‚Äî a general from the fascist militia, who was also the head of the Italian Football Federation at the time. According to Gian Paolo Ormezzano, Pozzo was neither a fascist nor antifascist, while Giorgio Bocca considered him to be an officer of the Alpini and a reluctant fascist of the regime by association, \\"...one who appreciated punctual trains, but could not stand squadrismi, who paid homage to the monument dedicated to the Alpini, but not to the fascists' memorials.\\" Following the Second World War, however, Pozzo was excluded from Italian football, due to being accused of co-operating with the fascist government, and of participating in the Italian Social Republic; as such, the new Turin stadium was not dedicated to him. Despite his associations with fascism, however, he was not a member of the National Fascist Party, and documents demonstrated that he collaborated with the National Liberation Committee as of September 1943. In the 1938 edition of the FIFA World Cup took place in France, where numerous refugees who had escaped the fascist regime in Italy were strongly against the Italian national team's participation in the tournament. In the first match of the Italian national team, against the Norwegian national team, among the 22,000 spectators there were 3,000 escaped anti-fascist Italians who opposed \\"Mussolini's national team,\\" and jeered at them in protest. Pozzo replied to the demonstration with a memorable and highly controversial episode. During the presentation of the teams on the field, the Italian players had made the fascist salute, as it was custom for them to do at the time. As a result, they were overwhelmed by the jeers and whistles of protest from the crowd. Pozzo feared that that reception would demoralise the players. When the whistles diminished, after the players had lowered their arms, Pozzo, who was lined up with the team in the centre of the field, ordered them to perform another Roman salute. He later commented on the incident, stating: \\"Having won the battle of intimidation, we played.\\" Pozzo ordered the players to continue with the fascist salute during the national anthem. Afterwards he declared: \\"The match was immediately surrounded by polemic‚Äìpolitical undertones. And unfairly so. Because our players don't even dream of making something political out of this, but the fascist salute is the official flag of the moment, it's a sort of ceremony and they must show allegiance to it. They represent our country, and naturally they wear its colours and insignias with dignity. [...] I have my ideas, but I know what my duty is. When we take to the field, as expected, a solemn attack of deafening hisses and insults attends us. And we don't lower the hand until the hisses are stopped. The action of intimidation has not succeeded\\".

It is considered part of the Czechoslovak New Wave movement. The film portrays the heroine as living in a disorienting dream, cajoled by priests, vampires, and men and women alike. The film blends elements of the fantasy and horror film genres. Plot Valerie, a pretty young girl, is asleep when a thief steals her earrings; as she tries to investigate, she is startled by a horrific man, the Constable, who wears a mask. The thief returns her earrings the next day, angering the Constable. Back at her house, Valerie's grandmother, Elsa, tells her that the earrings were left behind by Valerie's mother upon joining a convent. Previously, the earrings belonged to the Constable, who also owned their house. Valerie also learns that a group of missionaries and a company of actors are coming to town. During her neighbor Hedvika's wedding, Valerie sees the Constable watching her in the crowd and her grandmother also seems to recognize him. Valerie receives a letter from the thief, Orl√≠k (\\"Eaglet\\"), warning her that the Constable, his uncle, killed Orl√≠k's parents and now wants Valerie's earrings back. Orl√≠k asks Valerie to meet him at the church that evening; when they meet he doesn't hide his attraction to her. Later, Valerie meets the Constable in the street, in disguise; he leads Valerie to a chamber where her grandmother whips herself to win back the love of a past lover, a priest named Graci√°n. Orl√≠k saves Valerie and tells her that his uncle is in love with her. The Constable meets Elsa, who calls him Richard and was his lover when she was 17. He promises to make her young again if she sells him the house that Valerie will inherit. Meanwhile, Orl√≠k gives Valerie a pearl for protection, then hides her from Richard again. At a picnic, Graci√°n tells Valerie that Orl√≠k is her brother. That night, Graci√°n comes into her bedroom and attempts to rape her, but she swallows the pearl to protect herself. Meanwhile, Richard and Elsa sneak into Hedvika's; while Hedvika and her husband consummate their marriage, Elsa bites her on the neck, stealing the blood necessary to become young again. Valerie finds Orl√≠k bound to a waterfall by Richard. Valerie frees Orl√≠k and takes him to her house, avoiding his romantic intentions by blindfolding him, since she now thinks they're siblings. They discover Graci√°n hanging dead from Valerie's window and take the body to a crypt under Valerie's house; Elsa is there, now a vampire. Disguised as a young woman, Elsa introduces herself as a distant cousin and tells Valerie that her grandmother left suddenly. She tries to bite Valerie, then restrains her while she's asleep and steals the earrings. Elsa imprisons Valerie, who then observes Elsa having sex with a man and then killing him, then attempting to seduce Orl√≠k, who instead steals the earrings again. Orl√≠k frees Valerie, returns her earrings, and confesses his love for her. He tries to explain that he's not her father's son, but Richard's, but Valerie runs away. She has guessed Elsa is actually her grandmother, and started to feel something for Richard, who's dying. Valerie steals a chicken from the market and takes it to Richard, who's just told Elsa that he is Valerie's father, and that Valerie's blood is the key to their survival. When Valerie heals Richard, he reverts to being a monster and attacks her. He plans to transplant Orl√≠k's heart into Valerie to make her immortal, but Elsa wants it for herself. Valerie, pretending to be unconscious, overhears everything. She revives Graci√°n, who wasn't actually dead, and finds a goodbye letter from Orl√≠k. Valerie meets Hedvika, sick from Elsa's bite and depressed about her marriage. They retreat into Hedvika's bedroom and spend the night together, after which Hedvika is healed. Outside, Graci√°n tells a crowd that Valerie is a witch who tempted him into sin. He orders her captured and burned at the stake, but Valerie swallows the magic earrings and escapes unharmed. In the crypt, now a brothel, Valerie tricks Richard into drinking one of the earrings, turning him into a polecat. In a progressively more dreamlike sequence, Valerie reunites with Orl√≠k, revealed to be one of the actors; then Elsa, who doesn't recall anything that's happened; then her long-lost parents. In the final scene everyone dances around Valerie in the forest, while the virgins sing for her. Eventually she falls asleep in a bed in the forest, alone.

The movie was supposed to be directed by Krumbachov√° then husband Jan Nƒõmec. However, after August 1968 Nƒõmec was fired from Barrandov film studio and wasn't allowed to direct. The project then went to Jire≈°. The screenplay was approved in late April 1968, and despite Jire≈°'s 1969 feature The Joke being banned by communist authorities, production proceeded on Valerie. Jaroslava Schallerov√° was chosen from 1,500 girls who auditioned for the role. The Czech town of Slavonice was chosen as the main filming location, because of its preserved renaissance-era town centre. The local people played extras. Some scenes were shot in nearby Kosteln√≠ Vyd≈ô√≠ monastery. Robert Nezval, son of the author of the novel V√≠tƒõzslav Nezval, appears in the film as a boy with a drum.  Soundtrack  The film soundtrack, featuring music composed by Lubo≈° Fi≈°er, was released for the first time in December 2006 by Finders Keepers Records. Available both on CD and LP, the booklet reveals previously unseen archive images, international poster designs, as well as notes by the label founder Andy Votel, a film professor Peter Hames and Trish Keenan from the band Broadcast. An alternative soundtrack was made by The Valerie Project in 2006. Release=Home media In January 2004, the film was released on DVD in the United States and Canada by Facets Video. In June of that same year, the film was released on DVD in the UK by Redemption Films Ltd.. In June 2015, the film was released on DVD and Blu-ray by the Criterion Collection, featuring a 4K digital restoration; three early short films by director Jire≈°, Uncle (1959), Footprints (1960), and The Hall of Lost Steps (1960); interviews from 2006 with Jaroslava Schallerov√° and Jan Klus√°k; and an alternate psychedelic folk soundtrack by The Valerie Project. Critical reception On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 93% based on , with a weighted average rating of 7.81/10. The New York Times called the film \\"Consistently and humorously anticlerical\\", writing that it \\"may be the most exotic flower to bloom on the grave of the Prague Spring, but it's one with deep roots in 20th- century Czech culture\\". Jordan Cronk of Slant Magazine wrote that the film \\"may be a willfully enigmatic, even obtuse viewing experience, but every frame continues to vibrant with energy and thrum with life\\", and gave the film a rating of three-and-a-half out of five stars. University of Nebraska film studies professor Wheeler W. Dixon wrote in his book Visions of Paradise: Images of Eden in the Cinema \\"The film's brevity and its seductive mise-en- sc√®ne, sumptuously photographed by Jan Cu≈ô√≠k, make the film seem almost an outlaw project, or an act of social criticism designed to enforce atheism by embracing an anti-Catholic stance, particularly in relation to sexual morality.\\" In the book 101 Horror Films You Must See Before You Die, author and professor at Brunel University Tanya Krzyminska called the film \\"an exquisitely crafted fairy tale woven around the sexual awakening of a young woman\\". Krzyminska also noted that, although the film shared many similarities with soft-core pornographic films of the period, \\"it seeks a broader canvas in a blend of attributes drawn from both high and low culture.\\" Krzyminska also noted the film's elements of gothic horror and fairy tales, as well as its use of symbolic imagery.  Influence  Many writers have cited similarities between the film and the work of English writer Angela Carter, who saw the film during its release in England. Her screenplay for The Company of Wolves (1984) adapted from Carter's short stories, in collaboration with director Neil Jordan, bears a direct or indirect influence. In 2006 members of New Weird America acts Espers, Fern Knight, Fursaxa and other musicians formed The Valerie Project. The group performed original compositions in unison with the film from 2006 to 2008.

Geller creates almost all of the music using his laptop, occasionally using drum machines, keyboards, or other instruments. History Geller co-founded Kindercore Records with Ryan Lewis in 1996 in Athens, Georgia, United States. Lewis, Geller, and Dykes soon moved to New York City, and Geller and Dykes began dating in 1997. When Geller asked Dykes to provide the vocals for an instrumental track he had written, they considered starting a band. With encouragement from Lewis, they played a live performance in Austin, Texas, at the 2000 South by Southwest festival. Geller and Dykes had decided on the name in 1999 while living in New York City. The band's debut album, Out of the Loop, was released in 2001 on the Kindercore label and according to a 2002 interview with The Stanford Daily, the band's name represented the dynamic of the duo's relationship: \\"The two towers, equal and independent, together made up one entity and came to represent the relationship that Geller and Dykes forged professionally and personally.\\" The duo's second album, The Tight Connection, was also released on Kindercore in 2002. After Kindercore folded, their third album, The Cover Up, was released on Gammon Records. Dykes and Geller were no longer involved romantically by that time, but they continue to collaborate professionally. 9/11 After the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center, I Am the World Trade Center toured briefly under the shortened name \\"I Am the World...\\", but resumed playing under their original name.

It formed naturally as an extension of Analostan Island in the latter part of the 1800s, and over time erosion and flooding severed it from Analostan. The U.S. federal government deposited material dredged from the Potomac River on the island between 1911 and 1922, and again from 1925 to 1927. The island was also reshaped by the government at this time. It received the name \\"Columbia Island\\" about 1918. In 1968, the island was renamed Lady Bird Johnson Park. Located within the park are the Lyndon Baines Johnson Memorial Grove, Navy ‚Äì Merchant Marine Memorial, and the Columbia Island Marina. The island, park, memorials, and marina are part of the George Washington Memorial Parkway and administered by the National Park Service. Early formation of Columbia Island Columbia Island is in part natural, and in part man-made. Columbia Island did not exist in 1818 and at that time, Analostan Island (now known as Theodore Roosevelt Island) was largely rock and quite close to the D.C. shoreline. Due to deforestation and increased agricultural use upstream, the river eroded much of the northern bank and widened the gap between Analostan Island and the shore and simultaneously large deposits of silt built up around Analostan Island. By 1838, Analostan had almost doubled in length toward the south and by 1884, the new southern part of Analostan Island was defined and built up, and supported a well- established wetland. However, the river gradually eroded the center of Analostan Island, severing Columbia Island from its parent body.Office of Conservation, Interpretation, and Use, p. 48-49; Moore and Jackson, p. 91. Between 1911 and 1922, the Potomac River was repeatedly dredged to deepen the channel and to widen the distance between Analostan/Theodore Roosevelt Island and Columbia Island (so that the \\"Virginia Channel\\" west of Analostan/Roosevelt Island would not flood easily). Dredged material was piled high on Columbia Island, helping to build it higher, lengthen and broaden it, and give it its current shape. Filling in of the island was complete in the spring of 1924.\\"Will Complete River Isle Filling in Spring.\\" Washington Post. November 25, 1923. The new island received its name in about 1918 from an unnamed engineer working for the District of ColumbiaSecrest, Meryle. \\"Park Named for Mrs. Johnson.\\" Washington Post. November 13, 1968. and the first use of this name in The Washington Post was in April 1922,\\"Bathing Beach Selected.\\" Washington Post. April 8, 1922. the same year it was transferred to the National Park Service. Expanding and developing Columbia Island=Arlington Memorial Bridge and the expansion of Columbia Island Dredging operations in the Potomac River in 1930. Note the floating pontoons which outline the soon-to-be-completed land which will define the Pentagon Lagoon, and the unfinished central bascule span in Arlington Memorial Bridge. In 1922, Congress authorized the Arlington Memorial Bridge Commission (AMBC) to hold a design competition for the proposed Arlington Memorial Bridge. It awarded the design commission to the firm if McKim, Mead and White, which appointed architect William Mitchell Kendall to be the lead designer. Congress subsequently authorized construction of Kendall's bridge on February 24, 1925. The legislation authorizing construction of the bridge also provided for the construction of approaches (on-ramps, off-ramps, and pedestrian areas) on both the D.C. and Virginia ends of the bridge; for the improvement of B Street NW as a new ceremonial avenue to link to the bridge; and for the construction of a roadway (eventually called Memorial Drive) between the bridge and the main gate of Arlington National Cemetery as well as a new ceremonial entrance at this gate (subsequently known as the Hemicycle). Preliminary designs for the bridge showed it terminating on Columbia Island,\\"Island to Be Remade in New Bridge Plans.\\" Washington Post. April 15, 1925. which necessitated expansion of Columbia Island. The United States Army Corps of Engineers already planned to dredge the Potomac River and enlarge Columbia Island, so on April 1, Secretary of War John W. Weeks ordered the expenditure of $114,500 to dredge the river between the Highway Bridge and the Lincoln memorial. The dredged material was to be dumped on Columbia Island.\\"Potomac Channel to Be Dredged for Flood Prevention.\\" Washington Post. April 2, 1925. To ensure the island could support the bridge, the Corps also planned to construct a levee around the island. The Corps reached an agreement with the AMBC in April 1925 to jointly share the cost of dredging,\\"Channel Dredging Jointly Planned.\\" Washington Post. April 22, 1925. which involved the removal of of river bottom, and the construction of of seawall and of levee.\\"Bridge Construction Preliminaries Shown.\\" Washington Post. May 8, 1925. About of Columbia Island was to be removed in order to widen the main Potomac River channel, and the height of the island raised from above average water level to over two years.\\"Army Begins Operation Upon Columbia Island.\\" Washington Post. September 3, 1925. Early designs for Columbia Island In addition to the ABMC and Corps of Engineers, the United States Commission of Fine Arts (CFA) and the National Capital Parks Commission (NCPC) both had authority to approve aspects of the bridge. The CFA had extensive authority to review the look of the bridge. The CFA and NCPC first discussed the bridge approaches in January 1926, when they met jointly to discuss how the Virginia terminus would serve as a gateway to Washington.\\"Commissions Plan Gateway in Virginia as City Entrance.\\" Washington Post. January 8, 1926. The two bodies agreed to a proposal by urban planner C.A.S. Sinclair, who proposed a series of roads radiating outward from the Virginia end of the bridge.\\"Bridge Approaches Around Arlington Cemetery Urged.\\" Washington Post. January 15, 1926. However, in December 1926, the CFA learned that Arlington National Cemetery was likely to expand eastward onto the property of the USDA Experimental Farm (which lay east of Arlington Ridge Road). Because this significantly impacted the approaches to the bridge, the CFA asked Kendall to restudy Sinclair's proposal for the Columbia Island terminus.\\"Grant Is Told Need of Bridge Restudy By Fine Arts Group.\\" Washington Post. December 28, 1926.\\"New Study Ordered of Memorial Bridge.\\" Washington Post. December 29, 1926. Kendall presented the revised design for the street and highway approaches for the Virginia landing in May 1927.Kohler, p. 18. His plan was for a series of traffic circles on Columbia Island. By June 30, 1927, dredging of the Potomac River was nearly complete. The reshaping of Columbia Island was finished, and the island had risen to feet above water.Office of Public Buildings and Public Parks of the National Capital, 1927, p. 20.\\"Park Board Seeks to Beautify Land Between Bridges.\\" Washington Post. July 19, 1927. The following month, work began on the engineering and architectural drawings for the Boundary Channel Bridge. This bridge would cross Boundary Channel (which separated Columbia Island from Virginia) to connect Arlington Memorial Bridge with the planned Memorial Drive.Office of Public Buildings and Public Parks of the National Capital, 1928, p. 51. Kendall's May 1927 design for Columbia Island generated lengthy debate for two years. Architect Milton Bennett Medary (who left the CFA in 1927) wrote to the Commission of Fine Arts in January 1928 after having seen Kendall's proposal. Medary argued that the National Mall ended with the Lincoln Memorial and the two great roads leading from it ‚Äì the Rock Creek and Potomac Parkway (RCPP) and the Arlington Memorial Bridge. Columbia Island, he said, should reflect a simple, formal dignity that helps ease the transition from the Neoclassical mall and bridge to the informal landscaping of Arlington National Cemetery.Kohler, p. 24. Medary's argument proved persuasive to the CFA, and in late May the commission and Kendall announced a revised treatment in which a great plaza would be built on Columbia Island. From this plaza, roads would lead across the island to bridges which would connect with the proposed Mount Vernon Memorial Parkway and Lee Highway. The traffic circles were eliminated, and Columbia Island would be reshaped to allow for the north- south roadway to pass along the axis of the island. The great plaza was intended to contain two high columns representing the Union and the South. The two columns were to be surmounted by gold statues of Nike. Additionally, the CFA concluded that there should be two high pylons at both the eastern and western ends of the bridge. These pylons were to be inscribed with bas-relief images representing national accomplishments, and topped by statues of golden eagles.\\"Big Plaza for End of Arlington Span Planned By Board.\\" Washington Post. May 25, 1928. Kendall's design also included two large, round Greek Revival temples close to the bridge on the island's east side, and several larger-than-life Greek Revival and Romanesque Revival statues scattered about the island.Kohler, p. 24-25. Early construction: Boundary Channel Bridge The dirigible USS Akron flies over Columbia Island in 1931. Below and to the right of the airship's tailfins is the island, on which extensive construction is under way on the \\"great plaza\\", axial roads, Boundary Channel Bridge, and Memorial Drive. Note the lack of any bridges to the north (left in this image). Bids for the construction of the Boundary Channel Bridge were opened on July 18, 1928.Office of Public Buildings and Public Parks of the National Capital, 1928, p. 52. The project was divided among several contractors. North Carolina Granite Co. provided the below-water granite, Hallowell Granite Works provided the granite for the voussoirs and the facing on the piers above mean low water level. The Woodbury Granite Co. provided the coping granite and balustrades. Hallowell delivered its granite in May 1929, North Carolina Granite delivered its by June, and Woodbury Granite delivered roughly half its granite by June 30, 1929.Office of Public Buildings and Public Parks of the National Capital, 1929, p. 66. The construction contract itself was awarded to the N.P. Severin Company in October 1928. Nearly a year passed before the CFA approved pylon designs for Columbia Island in March 1929. But the great plaza and roads on the island needed further study.\\"Meridian Hill Park Project Approved.\\" Washington Post. March 22, 1929. Work on the Boundary Channel Bridge began in the spring of 1929, but immediately ran into problems. An unstable rock shelf thick lay under the western abutment of the Arlington Memorial Bridge. This \\"rotten rock\\" had not been revealed by borings two years earlier, but now came to light as construction began on the Boundary Channel Bridge. Additionally, a thin layer of sand and gravel was discovered lying atop the bedrock of the eastern abutment of the Boundary Channel Bridge. Both obstacles had to be removed before construction could proceed further. By June 30, 1929, the Arlington Memorial Bridge's western abutment was finished (except for exterior masonry facing), and many of the concrete columns for the Boundary Channel Bridge were also finished. By the end of June 1930, some additional filling in of Columbia Island was all that was needed to finish the Arlington Memorial Bridge. But no construction had occurred on the Columbia Island great plaza, its monumental columns, or the two pylons as the CFA had still not approved a final design for these.Office of Public Buildings and Public Parks of the National Capital, 1930, p. 79, 81. Additionally, work on the western half of the Boundary Channel Bridge had come to a standstill. Tracks of the Rosslyn Branch of the Pennsylvania Railroad ran along the Virginia shoreline. In order to avoid an at-grade crossing with Memorial Drive, the CFA proposed in June 1927 that these tracks be lower by . Since meant extending the Boundary Channel Bridge, new engineering studies of the bridge were needed.Office of Public Buildings and Public Parks of the National Capital, 1927, p. 20-21. The Corps and CFA were still studying how to depress the Pennsylvania Railroad tracks three years later.Office of Public Buildings and Public Parks of the National Capital, 1930, p. 81. Informal negotiations had, by the end of June 1930, come to an agreement that the line would be moved closer to the river, and that an underpass through the bridge (accommodating two side-by-side tracks) and the depressed tracks should be constructed first before the railroad took title to the new line. This would permit uninterrupted rail service. The Pennsylvania Railroad also agreed to cede the old right-of-way to the government once the new tracks and tunnel were operational.Office of Public Buildings and Public Parks of the National Capital, 1930, p. 82. Otherwise, construction on the Boundary Channel Bridge was complete.Office of Public Buildings and Public Parks of the National Capital, 1930, p. 79. Revisions to the Great Plaza Northern end of Columbia Island shortly after its completion in 1932. The only roads visible are the connecting central axis road to the George Washington Memorial Parkway (left) and the Boundary Channel Bridge (showing completed and incomplete pylons) to Memorial Drive and Arlington National Cemetery in the distance. The CFA again considered designs for the Columbia Island plaza in July 1930.\\"Municipal Center Changes Approved By Fine Arts Body.\\" Washington Post. July 2, 1930. Repairs to the levees on Columbia Island were made that same month.\\"$400,000 Available for River Projects.\\" Washington Post. July 2, 1930. In September, the CFA reviewed but did not approve designs for the memorial columns, and for additional landscaping on the island.\\"Arts Group Views Plan for Changes in State Building.\\" Washington Post. September 17, 1930. CFA members began to question whether the columns were effective in memorializing the reunited North and South, although there was still agreement that they were integral to the great plaza's design. Nonetheless, Kendall was asked to restudy the issue yet again. Additionally, by now the Great Depression was having a severe and negative impact on funding for the entire Arlington Memorial Bridge project. With the bridge and its connection to Arlington National Cemetery essentially finished, Congress hesitated to provide funds for Columbia Island. To cut costs, the CFA deleted the Green Revival temples and the many statues scheduled for Columbia Island. Rather than building extensive roads north and south on the island when no connections were ready to be made, the CFA also agreed that only short segments of these avenues be built adjacent to the great plaza. Eliminating the statuary on the island and on the Boundary Channel Bridge saved $478,000.\\"Arlington Memorial Bridge.\\" Washington Post. January 20, 1931. Due to settling, additional dredged material was deposited on Columbia Island in October and November 1930. The new goal was to raise the island to above the average water level.\\"Pumps Raise Level of Columbia Island.\\" Washington Post. October 24, 1930. There were still problems in designing the final segment of Boundary Channel Bridge in November 1930, but the road across Columbia Island connecting Arlington Memorial Bridge with Boundary Channel Bridge was finished in December.\\"Fine Arts Commission Studies New Projects.\\" Washington Post. November 4, 1930; \\"Columbia Island Road, Linking Spans, Finished.\\" Washington Post. December 23, 1930. The CFA continued to wrestle with Columbia Island's great plaza design in 1931. The commission again discussed the columns in January,\\"Design Is Approved for State Building.\\" Washington Post. January 7, 1931. and eliminated a granite balustrade around the great plaza (saving $400,000). But by September, the agency still had come to no resolution on redesigning the plaza.\\"Arts Commission to Judge Projects.\\" Washington Post. September 21, 1931. Eliminating the memorial columns Design issues surrounding the Columbia Island great plaza were resolved in late 1931 not by the CFA, but by President Herbert Hoover. Two airfields, Hoover Field and Washington Airport, existed in Virginia just south of Columbia Island. In the spring of 1931, AMBC executive officer Ulysses S. Grant III (then a Lieutenant Colonel with the Corps of Engineers) advised the AMBC and CFA that the huge memorial columns planned for Columbia Island would be a risk to aviation.\\"200 Foot Columns For Bridge May Be Aviation Sacrifice.\\" Washington Post. October 1, 1931. Both bodies ignored him. On September 28, 1931, the United States Department of Commerce told the CFA that the tall columns were a risk to aviation. The Commerce Department said that the columns would seriously interfere with air traffic using Hoover Field, and demanded that the CFA either eliminate the columns or floodlight them brightly.\\"200-Foot Pillars At Bridge Called Aviation Menace.\\" Washington Post. September 29, 1931. The Washington Board of Trade added its opposition to the columns on September 29.\\"Conference Is Set On Island Columns.\\" Washington Post. September 30, 1931. Grant agreed that, should an investigation show a hazard, the columns would have to be eliminated. The CFA agreed that street lights should be placed alongside the roads on Columbia Island both as an aid to vehicular traffic and as a means of warning air traffic. But the CFA was adamantly opposed to floodlighting the memorial columns, for they would compete with the softer lighting illuminating the Lincoln Memorial and Arlington House in Arlington National Cemetery.\\"Combination System Is to Be Used on Mount Vernon Route.\\" Washington Post. October 3, 1931. William Kendall, however, was so adamant about retaining the memorial columns that he personally wrote President Hoover (who technically chaired the AMBC) in early October 1931 outlining his reasons for keeping the columns and telling Hoover to move the airport if they interfered with flight.Kohler, p. 25. On October 12, Hoover ordered AMBC staff, Kendall, the CFA, and Arlington Memorial Bridge consulting engineer W. J. Douglas to restudy the columns. The Washington Post reported that several AMBC and CFA members, as well as member of Congress, were increasingly worried as well about the huge cost of the columns. The columns themselves were estimated to cost at least $500,000, with another $100,000 needed for their foundations.\\"Bridge Shaft Plan to Get New Study.\\" Washington Post. October 13, 1931. The CFA took up the issue at its regular meeting in early November.\\"Board to Discuss Column Air Hazard.\\" Washington Post. October 29, 1931. But when CFA members expressed skepticism about the issue, Senator Hiram Bingham (an aviation enthusiast) began organizing aviation interests to oppose them. Bingham also threatened to introduce legislation in Congress to bar any aviation hazards from being erected in the D.C. area.\\"Air Groups to Fight Memorial Columns.\\" Washington Post. November 22, 1931. On November 27, 40 postal and air transport pilots wrote to President Hoover demanding that the pillars be eliminated.\\"Fliers Enter Fight on Island Columns.\\" Washington Post. November 28, 1931. Three days later, the Board of Trade also contacted Hoover directly to lobby against the columns' erection.\\"Bridge Pillar Fight Will Go to Hoover.\\" Washington Post. December 2, 1931. Faced with overwhelming opposition, the AMBC voted to eliminate the columns in December 1931, and asked Kendall for yet another new design for Columbia Island. In the wake of the AMBC's decision, proposals came from the public and architects outside the project to add either high-spouting fountains or towers which would retract whenever planes took off from the airports.\\"Folding Towers Studied For Arlington Bridge.\\" Washington Post. February 6, 1932. But no decision was made.\\"Lampposts Studied for Memorial Span.\\" Washington Post. February 28, 1932. Completion of Columbia Island Aerial view of Columbia Island in 2011: The unfinished \\"great plaza\\" is at the foot of Arlington Memorial Bridge; northbound George Washington Memorial Parkway skirts the far (eastern) side of the island; the \\"racetrack\\" feature is visible circling the island; southbound George Washington Memorial Parkway skirts the near (western) side of the island; and Boundary Channel Bridge (with memorial pylons) spanning the silt-laden, brown Boundary Channel, is toward the bottom of the image. By April 1932, work was well under way on relocating the Pennsylvania Railroad tracks. The new, slightly shifted route had been graded, tracks laid, and the western end of Boundary Channel Bridge designed. While there were some delays in completing the railroad underpass, work was well advanced.\\"Another Link in Arlington Bridge to Open Tomorrow.\\" Washington Post. April 8, 1932. The formal dedication of the Hemicycle, Memorial Avenue, and Boundary Channel Bridge occurred on April 9. Colonel Ulysses S. Grant III, executive director of the Arlington Memorial Bridge Commission and an officer in the Corps of Engineers, formally opened Memorial Avenue and the Boundary Channel Bridge. (Memorial Avenue was only wide and unpaved, but the Corps was working to have it widened to and have it paved by July 1.)\\"Memorial Bridge Approach Opened.\\" Washington Post. April 10, 1932. The worsening federal budgetary situation nearly led to a complete halt in Columbia Island's development. On April 7, 1932, the House of Representatives deleted the project's entire $840,000 budget for fiscal year 1933 (which began July 1, 1932). Design and other work on the great plaza came to an immediate halt. So did the Corps' final push to fill in the island, as well as all landscaping and road grading.\\"Memorial Bridge Fund Stricken Out.\\" Washington Post. April 8, 1932. The CFA met in November 1932 to discuss how the incomplete work might be fixed to appear complete or become functional.\\"Experts to Study Future Park Plan.\\" Washington Post. November 11, 1932. Franklin D. Roosevelt took office as President of the United States in March 1933. Convinced that massive federal spending on public works was essential not only to \\"prime the pump\\" of the economy but also to cut unemployment, Roosevelt proposed passage of the National Industrial Recovery Act. The act contained $6 billion in public works spending. The act passed on June 13, 1933, and Roosevelt signed it into law on June 16. The Public Works Administration (PWA) was immediately established to disburse the funds appropriated by the act. On July 13, just a month after the PWA was formed, the agency announced a $3 million grant to finish work on Columbia Island and other parts of the Arlington Memorial Bridge project.\\"$3,000,000 Work Fund for Capital.\\" Washington Post.

The CFA and NCPC met in November to decide how to proceed on Columbia Island, which had only one link to Virginia ‚Äî and that led only to Arlington National Cemetery.\\"City Planning Board Opens Session Today.\\" Washington Post. November 16, 1933. On December 4, the agencies announced that PWA money would be used to construct bridges on the north and south ends of the island in anticipation of links with Lee Highway and a new highway the state of Virginia and Arlington County were discussing constructing in the south.\\"Highway Span Held Obsolete; New One Urged.\\" Washington Post. December 5, 1933. (The southern bridge carrying the parkway became known as the Humpback Bridge because it had a slight rise in its center.)Weil, Martin. \\"On Minor Scale, Odd Sightings Help Define Capital.\\" Washington Post. August 15, 2002. To connect to these bridges, completion of the roads on Columbia Island was also needed. These roads were staked out in January 1934, and the CFA and NCPC began discussing whether a new, large traffic circle should be added to the center of the island to replace the bottleneck that a simple cross-axis would be.\\"Bridge Design Awaits Action of Arts Group.\\" Washington Post. January 16, 1934; \\"D.C. Planning Before Three Bodies Today.\\" Washington Post. January 18, 1934. The engineering and architectural design for the northern bridge was approved in October 1936.\\"Groups Study Car Parking In Triangle.\\" Washington Post. October 24, 1936. The CFA further discussed what to do with the Columbia Island great plaza in January 1935, but again could come to no decision. Without funds, little action other than bridge construction or marginal improvements could be made. Improved landscaping designs for the Boundary Channel Bridge were also submitted in January 1935, and approved in March 1936.\\"Fine Arts Commission Will Meet Architect.\\" Washington Post. January 14, 1935; \\"Art Projects Favored.\\" Washington Post. March 28, 1936. Seven months later, the CFA began studying the design for the lighting scheme for the Arlington Memorial Bridge, Columbia Island, and Memorial Drive. Minor elements of Columbia Island were completed in the last years of the 1930s. A second northern bridge, designed to link with Lee Boulevard (now known as Arlington Boulevard) was approved in 1937. The Joseph A. LaVezza & Sons construction company immediately began work on the $24,875 bridge.\\"Boundary Channel Bridge.\\" Washington Post. April 9, 1937. This new bridge, and (at last) the bridge over the Pennsylvania Railroad tracks were completed in July.\\"Material Ordered For Road Repairs.\\" Washington Post. July 18, 1937. Although the CFA continued to confer on plans concerning the great plaza as late as January 1938,\\"Coolidge High Plan Approved By Arts Group.\\" Washington Post. January 15, 1938. no improvements were made. Memorial Avenue was completed in September 1938.\\"Work Begun On Arlington Traffic Outlets.\\" Washington Post. September 21, 1938. The final elements on Columbia Island were constructed in 1939 and 1940. In April 1939, Congress approved $100,000 to build the last connections between the bridges and central traffic circle on the island, as well as build sidewalks, trails, and parking lots and to improve landscaping there.\\"House Votes Fund for Navy Memorial.\\" Washington Post. April 18, 1939. The CFA, after four years of deliberation, finally approved the lamppost design for the island in January 1940.\\"Fine Arts Body Approves More Use of Marble.\\" Washington Post. January 20, 1940. The last major improvement to the island came in September 1940, when a \\"racetrack\\" feature ‚Äì a larger outer traffic circle ‚Äì was constructed to handle the rapidly increasing north-south traffic on the island. This permitted north- south motorists to avoid the bottleneck at the traffic circle (which now largely handled just east-west traffic).\\"Capital Gets New Portal.\\" Washington Post.

Note the existence of the \\"racetrack\\" feature on the island, and only four bridges connecting it to Virginia. With filling operations on Columbia Island suspended in 1932, the island underwent a natural process of settling. By 1941, settling had damaged the abutments of the Boundary Channel Bridge, and the Bureau of Public Roads placed steel struts under each abutment in April to shore them up.\\"U.S. to Reinforce Bridge Over Boundary Channel.\\" Washington Post. April 23, 1941. Bridge work on Columbia Island continued in the 1940s. In January 1942, the United States Department of Defense realized that rapid expansion of the Pentagon workforce due to entry of the United States into World War II would put significant strain on the local road networks. A new arterial, Army-Navy Boulevard (now called Army-Navy Drive) was under construction to connect Pentagon City and points south to the Pentagon. The road then continued northwest past the Pentagon to Columbia Island, where it was to run up the center of the island and connect with the Arlington Memorial Bridge.In 2013, Army-Navy Drive bears east-southeast at South Joyce Street and continues for only a few blocks more until dead-ending near Jefferson Davis Highway. But when originally constructed, it continued north past South Joyce Street along which today is South Washington Boulevard to link with the great plaza traffic circle and Arlington Memorial Bridge and via a long on-ramp to northbound George Washington Memorial Parkway (the former Mount Vernon Memorial Parkway). It doubled back on itself via the Columbia Island \\"racetrack\\" feature to provide access to southbound George Washington Memorial Parkway. A bridge carrying Army-Navy Boulevard over the Boundary Channel was approved in January 1942.\\"Bids Being Received On Arlington Bridges.\\" Washington Post. January 23, 1942. In 1948, the northwesterly bridge connecting Columbia Island to Lee Boulevard (now Arlington Boulevard) was rebuilt.\\"Channel Bridge to Be Completed By Next Spring.\\" Washington Post. July 17, 1948. Another bridge linking Columbia Island and Virginia was proposed in 1958. At that time, one possible route for the Theodore Roosevelt Bridge was south of Little Island (the southern tip of Theodore Roosevelt Island which had become detached from the main island due to erosion).Theodore Roosevelt Island (Analostan Island) (Mason's Island). George Washington Memorial Parkway. Potomac River. District of Columbia. HALS DC-12. Historic American Landscapes Survey. National Park Service. U.S. Department of the Interior. 2007, p. 83. Accessed 2013-05-08. District of Columbia officials asked permission in January 1958 to build a small approach bridge to the Roosevelt span over Boundary Channel, but the CFA refused a month later.\\"Bridge Site Toured by Officials.\\" Washington Post. January 28, 1958; \\"Commission Rejects Design of Bridge Link.\\" Washington Post. February 8, 1958. By June 1958, the bridge's location had shifted north to the southern end of Theodore Roosevelt Island, making a bridge over Boundary Channel moot. In 1958, the northwestern bridge linking Columbia Island to Arlington Boulevard (the former Lee Boulevard) was widened to six lanes from four.\\"Arts Center Given Nod by Commission.\\" Washington Post. March 28, 1958. The northern bridge carrying the George Washington Memorial Parkway over Boundary Channel was realigned in late 1962 as part of a larger road realignment allowing Arlington Boulevard to link to the new Theodore Roosevelt Bridge.Schuette, Paul. \\"Compromise Clears Plants for Link to Roosevelt Bridge.\\" Washington Post. August 23, 1962. A traffic light, the only one anywhere on the parkway, was installed to control traffic during the realignment process. The new bridge was finished and the light removed in September 1964.\\"Parkway Bridge Opening Is Set.\\" Washington Post. September 7, 1964. A year later, in September 1965, a new bridge just west of the South Washington Boulevard bridge opened. The George Washington Memorial Parkway was expanding north of its old terminus at Arlington Memorial Bridge, but this necessitated moving the parkway's southbound lanes onto the Virginia shoreline and off the northern part of Columbia Island. The new bridge connected the new parkway alignment with the old.\\"Another Bridge for District Commuters.\\" Washington Post. September 30, 1965.

May 26, 1977. Part of the effort consisted of the construction of a footbridge over the Boundary Channel to connect a new, 30-car parking lot in the north Pentagon parking area to Columbia Island. The cost of the footbridge and parking lot was $500,000.\\"A Bridge to LBJ Memorial.\\" Washington Post. September 29, 1977.

May 8, 1987. Reconstruction of the Humpback Bridge began in January 2008. The bridge, which had not been renovated since its construction, now carried 75,000 vehicles a day ‚Äì far more than it was designed for. Improvements included widening the bridge, adding balustrades to separate the sidewalks from the vehicular traffic lanes, and building an underpass through the Columbia Island side landing to allow pedestrians and cyclists to pass through the bridge rather than crossing the parkway. The reconstruction also removed the notorious \\"hump\\" in the middle of the bridge. However, the masonry facing of the bridge was retained to protect the historic character of the bridge.Berman, Mark. \\"Overhaul of GW Parkway Bridge to Hamper Commute.\\" Washington Post. November 22, 2007. The bridge reconstruction was complete in 2011, and the bike/pedestrian underpass opened in November.

The Navy-Merchant Marine Memorial The Navy-Merchant Marine Memorial on Columbia Island. Veterans of the United States Navy and the United States Merchant Marine had long argued that there was no memorial commemorating their service anywhere in Washington, D.C. Congress rectified this in the 1920s, and a memorial designed by 1922. However, fund-raising for the memorial took far longer than expected. Ground on Columbia Island for the memorial was broken by Secretary of the Navy Charles Francis Adams, Secretary of the Treasury Andrew W. Mellon, Marine Corps Major General Ben H. Fuller, Coast Guard Commandant Rear Admiral Frederick C. Billard, and Assistant Secretary of Commerce David Sinton Ingalls on December 2, 1930.\\"Work Begins Today on Navy Memorial.\\" Washington Post. December 2, 1930. Work on the memorial stopped for nearly three years. The statue itself was finally emplaced in 1934. However, lack of funds meant that instead of a wavy green granite base, the statue stood atop a concrete plinth. In May 1934, the commission overseeing the memorial's construction asked the Works Progress Administration for a $100,000 grant to complete the granite steps.\\"WPA Funds Sought For Sea Memorial.\\" Washington Post. May 10, 1936. But no funds were forthcoming. Finally, funding for the memorial's completion began moving through Congress. With congressional support, the Works Progress Administration gave $39,000 to finish memorial in 1939. This included adding the wavy green granite steps, creating a concrete plaza around the memorial, installing two flagstone walks to lead to the memorial, and landscaping the area.\\"Senate Votes Funds for Navy, Marine Statue.\\" Washington Post.

Lady Bird Johnson Park Columbia Island was renamed Lady Bird Johnson Park by the United States Department of the Interior on November 12, 1968. The renaming honored Lady Bird Johnson, then‚ÄìFirst Lady (November 22, 1963 ‚Äì January 20, 1969), who sponsored a nationwide, urban-beautification campaign between 1964 and 1968. When the island was renamed, it also received extensive new plantings. More than one million daffodils and 2,700 dogwood trees were planted on the park between 1965 and 1968. These plants were paid for by the National Park Service, Society for a More Beautiful National Capital, and the 1965 Inaugural Committee.

A granite plaza was intended for the center of the grove, on which a , high pink granite orthostat (or \\"standing stone\\") quarried in Texas was to be placed. Stone carver Harold Vogel worked the exterior of the stone to give it a dynamic, rough-hewn look reminiscent of Johnson's personality.

Located within the park are the Lyndon B. Johnson Memorial Grove, the Navy‚ÄìMerchant Marine Memorial, and the Columbia Island Marina.White, p. 106. Columbia Island is accessible from downtown Washington via the Arlington Memorial Bridge, from Arlington National Cemetery via Memorial Drive, and from Northern Virginia via the George Washington Memorial Parkway. The Mount Vernon Trail runs along the side of the island facing the rest of the District, leading to Theodore Roosevelt Island in one direction and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport on the other.Elliott, p. 21-22.

","title":"Columbia Island (District of Columbia)"},{"id":"1868140","text":"Unreal Tournament 3 (UT3) is a first-person shooter and online multiplayer video game developed by Epic Games and published by Midway Games in the Unreal series. It was released for Microsoft Windows on November 19, 2007, for the PlayStation 3 on December 11, 2007, and for the Xbox 360 on July 3, 2008. Unreal Tournament 3 is the fourth game in the Unreal Tournament series and the eighth Unreal game. Similar to its predecessors, the game is primarily an online multiplayer title offering several game modes. There are eight modes, including Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, as well as modes like Duel, Warfare, Betrayal and Greed. In vehicle maps, the player is equipped with a hover board, which allows players to quickly traverse large maps and grapple onto other teammates' vehicles. Unlike its predecessors, Unreal Tournament 3 single-player campaign does not follow a plot based around the Tournament Grand Championship, and it centers on a Necris attack that occurs on a colony on an unknown planet, releasing armed Kralls, a warlike race of aliens, on the humans. Originally announced as Unreal Tournament 2007 in 2005, and set to be released in 2006, the game was delayed to 2007. It was renamed as Unreal Tournament 3 as the team considered it the third generation of Unreal game since it utilizes Unreal Engine 3. OS X and Linux ports were planned but they were eventually cancelled. The game received positive reviews from critics, and sold more than 1 million copies worldwide. Gameplay Similar to the prior entries of the series, the game is primarily an online multiplayer title offering several game modes, including large-scale Warfare, Capture the Flag, and Deathmatch. It also includes an extensive offline multiplayer game with an in-depth story, beginning with a simple tournament ladder and including team members with unique personalities. The following game modes are included: * Deathmatch * Team Deathmatch * Capture the flag * Duel ‚Äì A one versus one game mode. It uses a queuing system: the winner stays, and the loser goes back to the end of the queue. A typical match lasts fifteen minutes with the winner being the player with the most kills. * Warfare ‚Äì A mix of Onslaught and Assault game modes. While basic game rules are equal to those of Onslaught, Warfare adds countdown nodes (which, after being captured and defended for a certain period of time, create a vehicle or trigger an event helpful to the capturing team) as well as the orb, which can be used to instantly capture and defend nodes. * Vehicle Capture the Flag ‚Äì Capture the Flag, with vehicles as part of the map; this game mode is distinct from the standard Capture the Flag mode. Also, players are given a hoverboard rather than a translocator. * Betrayal ‚Äì This game type places freelance players on teams, and when the members of each team kill enemies, the pot for that team grows. Anybody on a team with a pot can betray the rest of the team by shooting them, thus taking the pot, but they must defend themselves from the betrayed teammates for 30 seconds after that, or the teammates receive extra points. * Greed ‚Äì Greed is a game that (like the UT2004 mod of the same name) focuses on collecting skulls dropped from dead players and capturing them in the opposing team's base. For Greed, the game uses all Capture the Flag and Vehicle Capture the Flag maps. Modes not returning from the prior Unreal Tournament games include Invasion, Mutant (having been later on partially replaced by the Titan mutator in the UT3 Titan Pack), Onslaught (replaced by Warfare), Bombing Run, Last Man Standing, Domination, and Double Domination. Assault was removed from the game during production. In this installment of Unreal Tournament, the vehicles are split into two factions, the Axon vehicles and Necris vehicles. The Axon vehicles are the same vehicles from Unreal Tournament 2004, but several have significant game play changes. In addition, on vehicle maps every player is equipped with a personal hover board, a skateboard-like device that allows players to quickly traverse large maps and grapple onto other teammates' vehicles. The hover board is very vulnerable to attack, and any hit will knock the player off the board and disable him or her for several seconds, leaving the player exposed and vulnerable. The player cannot use any weapons while on the board. Plot Unlike the prior Unreal Tournament games, the single- player campaign does not follow a plot based around the Tournament Grand Championship, and therefore several of the teams within Unreal Tournament 3 are not Tournament competitors. The five playable factions are: Iron Guard, a team of human mercenaries led by former Tournament champion Malcolm; the Ronin, a band of four survivors of a Skaarj attack on a human colony; Liandri, a series of advanced humanoid robots custom-built or retrofitted for combat; the Krall, a warlike race of aliens formerly under the leadership of the Skaarj, returning from their initial appearance in the original Unreal; and the Necris, warriors who have undergone the process of the same name, making them stronger at the expense of replacing their biological processes with \\"Nanoblack\\", effectively turning them into undead soldiers (hence the name, Necris). In the Campaign, players control members of the Ronin, and the Necris serve as the chief antagonists. In the game's story a Necris attack occurs on a colony on unknown planet, releasing armed Krall on the humans. The colony is defenseless, but a group of Ronins arrives on the scene, defending the survivors. Reaper, the group's leader, advises his second-in-command warrior Othello and his sister Jester to destroy the orbital Necris blockade with a fighter, and orders team's sniper expert, Bishop, to provide cover as he swarms to save the colony. Suddenly, he is caught in the explosion of an incoming rocket missile and passes out, but not before seeing an unknown Necris woman shooting a soldier next to him. Reaper is rescued by Othello and Jester and wakes up in the base of the Izanagi, a guerrilla force that fights against Necris and Axon, and he meets with the leader, revealed to be Malcolm, who also leads the Iron Guard as the Izanagi's army. He explains that the Necris attack was masterminded by Liandri, who also turn some of the Krall, into Necris, controlled undead soldiers. The unknown woman who Reaper saw turns out to be Akasha, the Necris operative who destroyed the colony and also leads the Necris forces. Reaper wants to kill her, but Malcolm tells him that he needs to prove himself first. Development and release The game was announced on May 9, 2005 as Unreal Tournament 2007 for a 2006 release. In August 2006, the game was delayed until the first half of 2007. In January 2007, the game was renamed to Unreal Tournament 3. The original Unreal Tournament uses the first Unreal Engine, while UT2003 and UT2004 use Unreal Engine 2. Since 2004 incorporates all of the content from 2003, they are regarded as part of the same generation. UT3 is the third generation, as it runs on Unreal Engine 3 and does not reuse any content. Windows version A limited collector's edition of the game features an exclusive collector's edition tin and a hardcover art book. A bonus DVD is also included, featuring more than twenty hours of Unreal Engine 3 tool kit video tutorials, the history of the Unreal Tournament series, and behind-the-scenes footage of the making of Unreal Tournament 3. The Limited Collector's Edition was sold in the United States, Canada, Latin America, Europe, South Africa, Australia and most other territories. PlayStation 3 version The PlayStation 3 version supports community-made mods that can be uploaded and downloaded to the PS3's HDD or external media, as well as mouse and keyboard inputs. The 1.1 patch was released on March 21, 2008. It adds the ability for players using the North American and European versions to play together, fixes problems with some USB headsets, and displays the lowest pinging servers at the top of the server list. Some updates are only applied on the North American version, since the PAL version released in March 2008 was already partially updated. The 2.0 patch was released on March 5, 2009, and adds better PC mod support, split screen, smarter AI, forty-eight attainable Trophies, server-side improvements, an improved map vote, local multiplayer, and a new user interface. Online and LAN multiplayer for this version was terminated on July 2014, following the shutdown of all GameSpy servers. Xbox 360 version Upon release, the Xbox 360 version had five exclusive maps, two exclusive characters, a two-player split screen mode, and all the downloadable content released by Epic already on the disc. With the release of the PS3 and PC \\"Titan Upgrade\\" patch on March 5, these versions offered the formerly exclusive Xbox 360 content, as well as other content. The Xbox 360 version does not support user-generated mods, as additional content has to be verified by Microsoft before being released. It is the only version to support controllers only. Cancelled Linux and Mac OS X versions The Linux and Mac OS X versions of the game were planned to be released as downloadable installers that work with the retail disc. Ryan C. Gordon has uploaded screenshots of the game, dating from September 2008, running on both platforms. On May 22, 2009, Ryan stated that the UT3 port for Linux was still in process. On December 16, 2010, Steve Polge announced that the Linux port would never be released, making it the first Unreal Tournament game not to be released on Linux. Soundtrack Unreal Tournament 3: The Soundtrack is primarily based on the original Unreal Tournament score, which was composed by Straylight Productions and Michiel van den Bos. Jesper Kyd and Rom Di Prisco remixed many of UT99's tracks and composed several other original tracks, which were released on November 20, 2007 by Sumthing Else. Sandhya Sanjana was featured as a guest vocalist. Kevin Riepl did also contribute in music production for the game, scoring the cutscenes as well as a few in-game music tracks. Titan Pack and Black Edition On March 5, 2009, a free update titled Titan Pack was released for the PC; the PS3 version of the pack was released on March 19, 2009. The pack includes five maps and two characters that were formerly exclusive to the Xbox 360 version, along with eleven brand-new maps, two new game modes (\\"Greed\\" and \\"Betrayal\\"), and the Titan Mutator. The Titan Mutator causes a player to grow in size as they do better, while carrying alternative weapons and power-ups. The expansion also includes a new power-up, a new vehicle, two new deployables, and the addition of stinger turrets. A new patch was also released in conjunction with the Titan Pack, which allowed for various AI improvements (especially in vehicle modes), networking performance upgrades and added support for Steam Achievements (PC) and Trophies (PS3). It also adds a two-player split screen mode (formerly exclusive to the 360 version) and mod browsing for the PS3 version. The Black Edition is a complete Unreal Tournament 3 package‚Äîincluded is the complete UT3 (with patch 2.0) as well as the Titan Pack. The Titan Pack gives players a substantial amount of enhanced features and new content, including many original environments, new gametypes, the namesake Titan mutator, powerful deployables and weapons, new characters, and the Stealthbender vehicle. Reception Unreal Tournament 3 received positive reviews from critics. Xbox Magazine rated it 8.5 out of 10.(September 2008). Xbox Magazine. Issue 87, p. 66-67. PlayStation: the Official Magazine gave it 5 stars out of 5 in its February 2008 issue and stated, \\"UT3 looks great, but it's every bit the stunner under the surface\\". In March 2008, Midway announced that UT3 had sold over a million copies worldwide.

It was established in 1990 after the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 was passed. The mission of the program is \\"to enhance and coordinate America's drug-control efforts among local, state and federal law enforcement agencies in order to eliminate or reduce drug trafficking and its harmful consequences in critical regions of the United States.\\" The term HIDTA also refers to each geographic location, usually a major city, county, or border crossing, in which the program has established a headquarters. These headquarters are placed in locations considered to be major drug trafficking zones. The five HIDTA offices along the United States‚ÄìMexico border are grouped into a single \\"Southwest Border HIDTA\\" unit. Twenty eight HIDTAs have been designated since the program began. Each HIDTA is governed by a HIDTA Executive Board which includes representatives of local, state and federal law enforcement agencies in the area of the HIDTA. By law, each HIDTA Board is equally divided between federal law enforcement on the one side and state and local agencies on the other. In popular culture In popular culture, HIDTA was featured in an episode of Law & Order entitled \\"Locomotion\\". It aired in the show's 15th year (2004‚Äì2005 season).

He played in Major League Baseball as a first baseman and left fielder from through , most notably as a member of the Baltimore Orioles dynasty that won four American League pennants and two World Series championships between 1966 and 1971. The four-time All-Star led the American League in 1964 with a .606 slugging percentage and won the American League Most Valuable Player Award in 1970. He also played for the Cleveland Indians and the Los Angeles Dodgers. In 1979, Powell was inducted into the Baltimore Orioles Hall of Fame. Biography Powell was born in Lakeland, Florida; he played for that city's team in the 1954 Little League World Series. After his family moved to Key West when he was 15, Powell played at Key West High School and graduated in 1959. He joined the Orioles after leading the International League in home runs at Rochester in . Powell spent his first three seasons in Baltimore as a slow-footed left fielder before switching to first base in . At the plate he was an immediate success, hitting 25 home runs in ; in he led the American League in slugging percentage (.606) while blasting a career-high 39 home runs, despite missing several weeks because of a broken wrist. Powell slumped to .248 with 17 home runs in 1965, then won the American League Comeback player of the Year honors in (.287, 34 home runs, 109 runs batted in) while being hampered by a broken finger. Powell received the nickname ‚ÄúBoog‚Äù from his father. As Powell explained, ‚ÄúIn the South they call little kids who are often getting into mischief buggers, and my dad shortened it to Boog.‚ÄùBaseball Digest, February 1987, p. 86 Baltimore's glory years Powell at the Annapolis Book Festival in 2015 In 1966, Powell, along with Frank Robinson and Brooks Robinson, led the Orioles to the World Series, where they surprised the baseball world by sweeping the Los Angeles Dodgers in four games to become baseball's world champions. Before the 1968 season, Powell lamented, \\"once, just once, I'd like to go through a whole season without an injury.\\" and he did just that, playing over 150 games each of the next three seasons. In 1969 he hit a career-high .304 with 37 home runs and 121 runs batted in, and in he was the American League Most Valuable Player, hitting 35 home runs with 114 runs batted in and narrowly missed a .300 average during the last week of the season. In the 1970 World Series, Powell homered in the first two games as the Orioles defeated the Cincinnati Reds in five games. Prior to the 1971 season, Powell appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated for the 1971 baseball preview issue. Powell helped Baltimore reach a third straight World Series that year, blasting a pair of home runs in game two of the 1971 ALCS against the up-and-coming Oakland Athletics, but he hit only .111 in the Series as Baltimore lost to the Pittsburgh Pirates in seven games. Cleveland and Los Angeles Powell had been an American League all-star for four straight years (1968‚Äì1971). However, Oriole manager Earl Weaver believed in making liberal use of the platoon system; in 1973 and 1974, Powell fell victim to it, limiting his at-bats. He and Don Hood were traded to the Cleveland Indians for Dave Duncan and minor league outfielder Alvin McGrew on February 25 1975.\\"Indians Obtain Powell,\\" The Associated Press (AP), Tuesday, Feb. 25, 1975. Retrieved October 12, 2019 Powell, again a regular with the Indians, batted .297 (with 129 hits) and 27 home runs (his best season since 1970), and a .997 fielding percentage. However, he hit only nine home runs in . His final season was 1977, as a pinch-hitter for the Dodgers. He hit .244 with no home runs and 5 RBI's. He was released on August 31, 1977. Career In a 17-season career, Powell posted a .266 batting average with 339 home runs, 1187 RBI, .462 slugging percentage and a .361 on-base percentage in 2042 games. Powell hit three home runs in a game three times, and was second only to Eddie Murray on the Orioles' all-time home run list before Cal Ripken Jr. surpassed Powell in 1994. In 1983, Powell received five votes for the Hall of Fame (1.3% of all BBWAA voters) in his only appearance on the ballot. Retirement In the 1970s and 1980s Powell appeared in more than ten different television commercials for Miller Lite beer, including a memorable one with umpire Jim Honochick. Playing on the theme of mocking umpires who make bad calls, the ad featured Honochick trying unsuccessfully to read the label on a beer bottle as Powell did the voice over. Borrowing Powell's glasses to bring the label into focus, and suddenly able to see who is standing next to him at the bar and providing the narration, Honochick exclaims, \\"Hey, you're Boog Powell!\\"Greg Stoda, Powell Enjoys Second Career, Wilimington (N.C.)

For example, James Bond's famous identifier, 007, has two leading zeros.. When leading zeros occupy the most significant digits of an integer, they could be left blank or omitted for the same numeric value.. Therefore, the usual decimal notation of integers does not use leading zeros except for the zero itself, which would be denoted as an empty string otherwise.. However, in decimal fractions strictly between ‚àí1 and 1, the leading zeros digits between the decimal point and the first nonzero digit are necessary for conveying the magnitude of a number and cannot be omitted, while trailing zeros ‚Äì zeros occurring after the decimal point and after the last nonzero digit ‚Äì can be omitted without changing the meaning.  Occurrence  Often, leading zeros are found on non-electronic digital displays or on such electronic ones as seven-segment displays, that contain fixed sets of digits. These devices include manual counters, stopwatches,. odometers,. and digital clocks. Leading zeros are also generated by many older computer programs when creating values to assign to new records, accounts and other files, and as such are likely to be used by utility billing systems, human resources information systems and government databases. Many digital cameras and other electronic media recording devices use leading zeros when creating and saving new files to make names of the equal length. Leading zeros also present whenever the number of digits is technically fixed (such as in a memory register), but the stored value is not large enough to result in a non- zero most significant digit.. The count leading zeros operation efficiently determines the number of leading zero bits in a machine word.. A leading zero appears in roulette in the United States, where \\"00\\" is distinct from \\"0\\" (a wager on \\"0\\" will not win if the ball lands in \\"00\\", and vice versa). Sports where competitors are numbered follow this as well; a stock car numbered \\"07\\" would be considered distinct from one numbered \\"7\\". Benito Santiago, a Major League Baseball catcher who wore the number 09 for several years, is the only major professional sports league player to use a jersey number with a leading zero, not counting several who have worn the number 00 (in Santiago's case, Major League Baseball did not distinguish his 09 number from the ordinary number 9; he wore the extra zero to avoid complications with his catcher's pads, allowing the back strap to run between the numbers instead of over a single digit 9). This is most common with single-digit numbers.  Advantages  ;Collation Leading zeros are used to make ascending order of numbers correspond with alphabetical order: e.g., 11 comes alphabetically before 2, but after 02. (See, e.g., ISO 8601.) This does not work with negative numbers, though, whether leading zeros are used or not: ‚àí23 comes alphabetically after ‚àí01, ‚àí1, and ‚àí22, although it is less than all of them. ; Error prevention Leading zeros in a sentence also make it less likely that a careless reader will overlook the decimal point. For example, in modern pharmacy there is a widely followed convention that leading zeros must not be omitted from any dose or dosage value in drug prescribing. Likewise, just as leading zeros are mandatory, trailing zeros are forbidden. In both cases, the reason is the same: to prevent misreading and the resultant misdose by one or several orders of magnitude. ; Fraud prevention Leading zeros can also be used to prevent fraud by filling in character positions that might normally be empty. For example, adding leading zeros to the amount of a check (or similar financial document) makes it more difficult for fraudsters to alter the amount of the check before presenting it for payment.  Zero as a prefix  A prefix \`0\` is used in C to specify string representations of octal numbers, as required by the ANSI C standard for the \\"strtol\\" function (the string to long integer converter) in the \\"stdlib.h\\" library. Many other programming languages, such as Python, Perl, Ruby, PHP, and the Unix shell bash also follow this specification for converting strings to numbers. As an example, \\"\`0020\`\\" does not represent 2010 (2√ó101 \\\\+ 0√ó100), but rather 208 = 1610 (2√ó81 \\\\+ 0√ó80 = 1√ó101 \\\\+ 6√ó100). Decimal numbers written with leading zeros will be interpreted as octal by languages that follow this convention and will generate errors (not just unexpected results) if they contain \\"8\\" or \\"9\\", since these digits do not exist in octal. This behavior can be quite a nuisance when working with sequences of strings with embedded, zero-padded decimal numbers (typically file names) to facilitate alphabetical sorting (see above) or when validating inputs from users who would not know that adding a leading zero triggers this base conversion.

It emerged following a split within the Hungarian Social Democratic Party (MSZDP) in 1989. Both the SZDP and MSZDP lay claim to the same heritage: the Social Democratic Party which was part of a governing coalition in Hungary between 1945 and 1948, and a short period in 1956, which itself was renamed from the Hungarian Social Democratic Party, previously established in 1890. Traditional areas of support were the industrial areas of Budapest, especially √ìbuda, Pesterzs√©bet and Angyalf√∂ld. History=Split from MSZDP and aftermath Originally a very small breakaway from the MSZDP, Imre Tak√°cs and the other founders were joined by many individuals who left the MSZDP in 1997. They objected to the increasingly centralised leadership style of L√°szl√≥ Kapolyi, by now funding and leading the MSZDP into a close association with the formerly communist MSZP. Among this group of new recruits were a number of veterans from the post-war coalition of 1945-1948 and the government of Imre Nagy, such as R√≥bert G√°bor, S√°ndor B√°cskai and Ern≈ë Nagy. Electorally, the SZDP have remained a marginal party, with some limited success in local elections. Under the co-leadership of M√°ty√°s Sz≈±r√∂s from 2003-2005 the party took a sharp turn towards populism and the right-wing Fidesz party. By the time Sz≈±r√∂s was finally forced out in 2005 the party had suffered a loss in any remaining credibility. In April 2009, the party announced that Anna Petrasovits, leader of the MSZDP from 1989-1992 would lead the party's list for the European Parliament elections in June 2009. This failed to culminate in the necessary number of nominations from voters. Following this abortive attempt, infighting broke out between different leadership factions. The party has failed to contest national elections since the 2002 Hungarian parliamentary election and can be considered to be practically defunct on this basis.  Ideology  Both the Social Democratic Party and the Hungarian Social Democratic Party have claimed to be the natural successors to the Social Democratic Party which existed before 1948 and the imposition of one-party rule in Hungary. The Historic Social Democrats have argued that they are in the historical tradition of Hungarian social democracy as they have retained their distance from the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) - whilst the MSZDP has formed a close, shared platform with the MSZP. The MSZP are regarded by the SZDP as a post-communist formation and not within the social democratic tradition. Ideologically, some in the SZDP have been closer to what is described as democratic socialism in the United Kingdom, and have aimed to provide a democratic critique of capitalism. Others, including the current leadership, have stressed the nationalistic aspects to social democracy.

For a given inertial frame, if a second frame is Lorentz-boosted relative to it, and a third boosted relative to the second, but non-colinear with the first boost, then the Lorentz transformation between the first and third frames involves a combined boost and rotation, known as the \\"Wigner rotation\\" or \\"Thomas rotation\\". For accelerated motion, the accelerated frame has an inertial frame at every instant. Two boosts a small time interval (as measured in the lab frame) apart leads to a Wigner rotation after the second boost. In the limit the time interval tends to zero, the accelerated frame will rotate at every instant, so the accelerated frame rotates with an angular velocity. The precession can be understood geometrically as a consequence of the fact that the space of velocities in relativity is hyperbolic, and so parallel transport of a vector (the gyroscope's angular velocity) around a circle (its linear velocity) leaves it pointing in a different direction, or understood algebraically as being a result of the non-commutativity of Lorentz transformations. Thomas precession gives a correction to the spin‚Äìorbit interaction in quantum mechanics, which takes into account the relativistic time dilation between the electron and the nucleus of an atom. Thomas precession is a kinematic effect in the flat spacetime of special relativity. In the curved spacetime of general relativity, Thomas precession combines with a geometric effect to produce de Sitter precession. Although Thomas precession (net rotation after a trajectory that returns to its initial velocity) is a purely kinematic effect, it only occurs in curvilinear motion and therefore cannot be observed independently of some external force causing the curvilinear motion such as that caused by an electromagnetic field, a gravitational field or a mechanical force, so Thomas precession is usually accompanied by dynamical effects. If the system experiences no external torque, e.g., in external scalar fields, its spin dynamics is determined only by the Thomas precession. A single discrete Thomas rotation (as opposed to the series of infinitesimal rotations that add up to the Thomas precession) is present in situations anytime there are three or more inertial frames in non-collinear motion, as can be seen using Lorentz transformations.  History  Thomas precession in relativity was already known to Ludwik Silberstein, in 1914. But the only knowledge Thomas had of relativistic precession came from de Sitter's paper on the relativistic precession of the moon, first published in a book by Eddington. In 1925 Thomas relativistically recomputed the precessional frequency of the doublet separation in the fine structure of the atom. He thus found the missing factor 1/2, which came to be known as the Thomas half. This discovery of the relativistic precession of the electron spin led to the understanding of the significance of the relativistic effect. The effect was consequently named \\"Thomas precession\\".  Introduction = Definition  Consider a physical system moving through Minkowski spacetime. Assume that there is at any moment an inertial system such that in it, the system is at rest. This assumption is sometimes called the third postulate of relativity. This means that at any instant, the coordinates and state of the system can be Lorentz transformed to the lab system through some Lorentz transformation. Let the system be subject to external forces that produce no torque with respect to its center of mass in its (instantaneous) rest frame. The condition of \\"no torque\\" is necessary to isolate the phenomenon of Thomas precession. As a simplifying assumption one assumes that the external forces bring the system back to its initial velocity after some finite time. Fix a Lorentz frame such that the initial and final velocities are zero. The Pauli-Lubanski spin vector is defined to be in the system's rest frame, with the angular-momentum three- vector about the center of mass. In the motion from initial to final position, undergoes a rotation, as recorded in , from its initial to its final value. This continuous change is the Thomas precession. Statement Value of as increases, with v the instantaneous magnitude of the particle's velocity. The Thomas rotation is negligible for , increases steadily for , then rapidly shoots to infinity as tends to 1. The \\"Thomas half\\" is evident in the low- speed limit, and the rotation is only very clear for speeds approaching that of light. Consider the motion of a particle. Introduce a lab frame in which an observer can measure the relative motion of the particle. At each instant of time the particle has an inertial frame in which it is at rest. Relative to this lab frame, the instantaneous velocity of the particle is with magnitude bounded by the speed of light , so that . Here the time is the coordinate time as measured in the lab frame, not the proper time of the particle. Apart from the upper limit on magnitude, the velocity of the particle is arbitrary and not necessarily constant, its corresponding vector of acceleration is . As a result of the Wigner rotation at every instant, the particle's frame precesses with an angular velocity given by the where √ó is the cross product and :\\\\gamma = \\\\dfrac{1}{\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\dfrac{\\\\mathbf{v}(t)^2}{c^2}}} is the instantaneous Lorentz factor, a function of the particle's instantaneous velocity. Like any angular velocity, is a pseudovector; its magnitude is the angular speed the particle's frame precesses (in radians per second), and the direction points along the rotation axis. As is usual, the right-hand convention of the cross product is used (see right-hand rule). The precession depends on accelerated motion, and the non-collinearity of the particle's instantaneous velocity and acceleration. No precession occurs if the particle moves with uniform velocity (constant so ), or accelerates in a straight line (in which case and are parallel or antiparallel so their cross product is zero). The particle has to move in a curve, say an arc, spiral, helix, or a circular orbit or elliptical orbit, for its frame to precess. The angular velocity of the precession is a maximum if the velocity and acceleration vectors are perpendicular throughout the motion (a circular orbit), and is large if their magnitudes are large (the magnitude of is almost ). In the non-relativistic limit, so , and the angular velocity is approximately :\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega}_\\\\text{T} \\\\approx \\\\frac{1}{2c^2}\\\\mathbf{a}\\\\times\\\\mathbf{v} The factor of 1/2 turns out to be the critical factor to agree with experimental results. It is informally known as the \\"Thomas half\\". Mathematical explanation=Lorentz transformations The description of relative motion involves Lorentz transformations, and it is convenient to use them in matrix form; symbolic matrix expressions summarize the transformations and are easy to manipulate, and when required the full matrices can be written explicitly. Also, to prevent extra factors of cluttering the equations, it is convenient to use the definition with magnitude such that . The spacetime coordinates of the lab frame are collected into a 4√ó1 column vector, and the boost is represented as a 4√ó4 symmetric matrix, respectively :X = \\\\begin{bmatrix} c t \\\\ x \\\\ y \\\\ z \\\\end{bmatrix}\\\\,,\\\\quad B(\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\beta}) = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\gamma&-\\\\gamma\\\\beta_x &-\\\\gamma\\\\beta_y&-\\\\gamma\\\\beta_z\\\\ -\\\\gamma\\\\beta_x &1+(\\\\gamma-1)\\\\dfrac{\\\\beta_x^2}{\\\\beta^2} &(\\\\gamma-1)\\\\dfrac{\\\\beta_x \\\\beta_y}{\\\\beta^2} &(\\\\gamma-1)\\\\dfrac{\\\\beta_x \\\\beta_z}{\\\\beta^2} \\\\ -\\\\gamma\\\\beta_y &(\\\\gamma-1)\\\\dfrac{\\\\beta_y \\\\beta_x}{\\\\beta^2} &1+(\\\\gamma-1)\\\\dfrac{\\\\beta_y^2}{\\\\beta^2} &(\\\\gamma-1)\\\\dfrac{\\\\beta_y \\\\beta_z}{\\\\beta^2} \\\\ -\\\\gamma\\\\beta_z&(\\\\gamma-1)\\\\dfrac{\\\\beta_z \\\\beta_x}{\\\\beta^2} &(\\\\gamma-1)\\\\dfrac{\\\\beta_z \\\\beta_y}{\\\\beta^2} & 1+(\\\\gamma-1)\\\\dfrac{\\\\beta_z^2}{\\\\beta^2} \\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix} and turn :\\\\gamma = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\beta}^2}} is the Lorentz factor of . In other frames, the corresponding coordinates are also arranged into column vectors. The inverse matrix of the boost corresponds to a boost in the opposite direction, and is given by . At an instant of lab-recorded time measured in the lab frame, the transformation of spacetime coordinates from the lab frame to the particle's frame Œ£ is and at later lab-recorded time we can define a new frame for the particle, which moves with velocity relative to , and the corresponding boost is The vectors and are two separate vectors. The latter is a small increment, and can be conveniently split into components parallel (‚Äñ) and perpendicular (‚ä•) to Explicitly, using vector projection and rejection relative to the direction of gives :\\\\Delta\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\beta}_\\\\parallel = \\\\frac{\\\\Delta\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\beta}\\\\cdot\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\beta}}{\\\\beta^2}\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\beta}\\\\,,\\\\quad \\\\Delta\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\beta}_\\\\perp = \\\\Delta\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\beta} - \\\\frac{\\\\Delta\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\beta}\\\\cdot\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\beta}}{\\\\beta^2}\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\beta} but it is easier to simply use the parallel-perpendicular components. :\\\\Delta\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\beta} = \\\\Delta\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\beta}_\\\\parallel + \\\\Delta\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\beta}_\\\\perp Combining () and () obtains the Lorentz transformation between and , and this composition contains all the required information about the motion between these two lab times. Notice and are infinitesimal transformations because they involve a small increment in the relative velocity, while is not. The composition of two boosts equates to a single boost combined with a Wigner rotation about an axis perpendicular to the relative velocities; The rotation is given by is a 4√ó4 rotation matrix in the axis‚Äìangle representation, and coordinate systems are taken to be right- handed. This matrix rotates 3d vectors anticlockwise about an axis (active transformation), or equivalently rotates coordinate frames clockwise about the same axis (passive transformation). The axis-angle vector parametrizes the rotation, its magnitude is the angle has rotated, and direction is parallel to the rotation axis, in this case the axis is parallel to the cross product . If the angles are negative, then the sense of rotation is reversed. The inverse matrix is given by . Corresponding to the boost is the (small change in the) boost vector , with magnitude and direction of the relative velocity of the boost (divided by ). The boost and rotation here are infinitesimal transformations because and rotation are small. The rotation gives rise to the Thomas precession, but there is a subtlety. To interpret the particle's frame as a co-moving inertial frame relative to the lab frame, and agree with the non-relativistic limit, we expect the transformation between the particle's instantaneous frames at times and to be related by a boost without rotation. Combining () and () and rearranging gives where another instantaneous frame is introduced with coordinates , to prevent conflation with . To summarize the frames of reference: in the lab frame an observer measures the motion of the particle, and three instantaneous inertial frames in which the particle is at rest are (at time ), (at time ), and (at time ). The frames and are at the same location and time, they differ only by a rotation. By contrast and differ by a boost and lab time interval . Relating the coordinates to the lab coordinates via () and (); the frame is rotated in the negative sense. The rotation is between two instants of lab time. As , the particle's frame rotates at every instant, and the continuous motion of the particle amounts to a continuous rotation with an angular velocity at every instant. Dividing by , and taking the limit , the angular velocity is by definition {\\\\Delta t} }} It remains to find what precisely is. Extracting the formula The composition can be obtained by explicitly calculating the matrix product. The boost matrix of will require the magnitude and Lorentz factor of this vector.

No forces were specified or used in the derivation so the precession is a kinematical effect - it arises from the geometric aspects of motion. However, forces cause accelerations, so the Thomas precession is observed if the particle is subject to forces. Thomas precession can also be derived using the Fermi-Walker transport equation.Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler, Gravitation, p 165, pp 175-176 One assumes uniform circular motion in flat Minkowski spacetime. The spin 4-vector is orthogonal to the velocity 4-vector. Fermi- Walker transport preserves this relation. One finds that the dot product of the acceleration 4-vector with the spin 4-vector varies sinusoidally with time with an angular frequency Œé œâ, where œâ is the angular frequency of the circular motion and Œé=1/‚àö‚ü®1-v^2/c^2). This is easily shown by taking the second time derivative of that dot product. Because this angular frequency exceeds œâ, the spin precesses in the retrograde direction. The difference (Œ≥-1)œâ is the Thomas precession angular frequency already given, as is simply shown by realizing that the magnitude of the 3-acceleration is œâ v.  Applications = In electron orbitals  In quantum mechanics Thomas precession is a correction to the spin-orbit interaction, which takes into account the relativistic time dilation between the electron and the nucleus in hydrogenic atoms. Basically, it states that spinning objects precess when they accelerate in special relativity because Lorentz boosts do not commute with each other. To calculate the spin of a particle in a magnetic field, one must also take into account Larmor precession.  In a Foucault pendulum  The rotation of the swing plane of Foucault pendulum can be treated as a result of parallel transport of the pendulum in a 2-dimensional sphere of Euclidean space. The hyperbolic space of velocities in Minkowski spacetime represents a 3-dimensional (pseudo-) sphere with imaginary radius and imaginary timelike coordinate. Parallel transport of a spinning particle in relativistic velocity space leads to Thomas precession, which is similar to the rotation of the swing plane of a Foucault pendulum. The angle of rotation in both cases is determined by the area integral of curvature in agreement with the Gauss‚ÄìBonnet theorem. Thomas precession gives a correction to the precession of a Foucault pendulum. For a Foucault pendulum located in the city of Nijmegen in the Netherlands the correction is: :\\\\omega \\\\approx 9.5 \\\\cdot 10^{-7}\\\\, \\\\mathrm{arcseconds} / \\\\mathrm{day}. Note that it is more than two orders of magnitude smaller than the precession due to the general- relativistic correction arising from frame-dragging, the Lense‚ÄìThirring precession.

It covered an area of and had a population of 910. The administrative centre of Noarootsi Parish was P√ºrksi village (). It is located 10 km north from the capital of L√§√§ne County, Haapsalu. Villages There were 23 villages in Noarootsi Parish: Aulepa (Dirsl√§tt), Dirhami (Derhamn), Einbi (Enby), Elbiku (√ñlb√§ck), Hara (Harga), Hosby, H√∂bringi (H√∂bring), Kudani (Gutan√§s), Osmussaare (Odensholm), Paslepa (Pasklep), P√ºrksi (Birkas), Riguldi (Rickul), Rooslepa (Roslep), Saare (Lyckholm), Spithami (Spithamn), Sutlepa (Sutlep), Suur-N√µmmk√ºla (Klottorp), Tahu (Sk√•tan√§s), Telise (T√§lln√§s), Tuksi (Bergsby), Vanak√ºla (Gambyn), V√§ike- N√µmmk√ºla (Pers√•ker), √ñsterby.  History  Noarootsi was historically the only parish on the Estonian mainland where most of the local residents were Swedish-speaking. In 1934, the parish had 4,388 inhabitants, 2,697 (64%) of them Estonian Swedes. Until the end of the ancient historic period, today's Noarootsi area was practically unpopulated. Noarootsi peninsula was once a group of small islands, which joined the mainland in the middle of the 19th century. The first written proof of the Swedish population stems from the 13th century. There has been speculation, although unfounded, that many of the Swedes came from Finland. For historical reasons, the Swedes had privileges (Svensk R√§tt‚Äî\\"Swedish rights\\"), which consisted mainly of personal freedom and freedom of movement, and lower taxes. The Swedish population was strengthened by influx of Swedes from Uusimaa in Finland, peaking in the beginning of the 16th century. In the second half of the 16th century, during the Livonian war, the areas of Noarootsi were plundered by Russian army troops, and many sites, such as the church, were devastated. Beginning in the 1580s, Noarootsi was subjected to Swedish rule, which lasted until 1710. The Swedish era caused the cultural life to accelerate. In Noarootsi, the first known folk high school (first mentioned in 1650) was established by local Lutheran pastor Isaacus Mariaestadius Hasselblatt. Noarootsi church added chapels in Sutlepa, Rooslepa and Osmussaar. At the same time a line of manor houses was built, which initiated limits on the coastal Swedes' rights. Noarootsi's peasants' long fight for their freedom had begun. During the Great Northern War, Noarootsi was attacked by the plague epidemic during 1710‚Äì1711. The number of residents decreased by two-thirds, and many villages died out completely. Estonians from the mainland came to live in the empty villages. It was the start of Noarootsi becoming Estonianized. After the Great Northern War the conflicts between the lords of the manors and the peasants became more critical. This conflict culminated in the 1770s, with the sending of some of Hara's village residents to the mainland. In 1816 serfdom was abolished in Estonia. It did not touch the coastal Swedish Estonians, as their condition was ambiguous. They were not slaves and yet they were not entirely free. The folks' communal self- government and permanent compulsory school attendance were established in Noarootsi in 1856. In the middle of the 19th century, a new intellectual period began. Schools needed Swedish-speaking teachers. For their preparation in the Paslepa manor house, a teachers' training college was established, which was in operation for 14 years. The training college was led by the Swedish missionary Thure Emanuel Thor√©n. By the 1890s, a network of Swedish schools was formed in Estonia. Pasklep manor in August 1993. In the beginning of the 20th century, Noarootsi started to be the centre of the Swedes' intellectual activity. The local society's activities were led by Johan Nymann and Hans P√∂hl. In 1898 the first choral society was established in Paslepa, and in 1902 the first Swedish lending library was established. In 1903 the first Swedish calendar was distributed. In 1909 the Swedish education association was established in the V√∂√∂la manor house. In 1920 P√ºrksi's folk high school was opened and it was in operation until 1943. During the Estonian Republic the relationship between local residents and Swedes and Finns increased remarkably. Riguldi became a very active ship construction centre, the ship Hoppet () is one ship that still exists from this era. At first, potatoes and apples were exported to Sweden and Finland. It seemed that the Swedes were developing their place in Estonian society. In 1939 the Red Army bases were brought to Estonia. During this time, a great deal of the population was evacuated from Osmussaar island. In the summer of 1940 the Soviet Union established their power and with this a border zone. It became impossible for the residents to go on with their previous occupations and they started to think about emigration to Sweden. From 1943 to 1944 most of the Swedes left Estonia. In their place came war refugees from northeastern Estonia and Ingria. In 1944 the Soviet Army returned and the border zone was restored. The remaining inhabitants' contacts with their relatives in Sweden were cut off. During the forced emigration and building up of kolkhozes (collective farms), many villages were ruined and the coastal areas become military zones. Only a few villages have retained their original look. The new age in Noarootsi's history started at the end of the 1980s. The border zone disappeared and the local residents could return to their homes. In 1988 the first folk day celebrations were organized in Noarootsi. In 1989 Swedish instruction was reinstated in Noarootsi. In 1990, Noarootsi Gymnasium, with immersion study in Swedish, was founded in P√ºrksi. Approximately 900 people lived in Noarootsi Parish in 2005, only 50 of them considered themselves Swedish. Some Swedes have returned to Noarootsi after the demise of Soviet Union and bought or reclaimed old property, usually land, which they developed. The area is attractive for people looking for a summer house as large areas of Noarootsi have been off limits for civilians during Soviet rule. High property tax in Sweden and low in Estonia is another reason.

He played a significant role in the CIA's MKULTRA program to investigate the possible applications for LSD. Biography Abramson graduated from Columbia College in 1919, receiving an M.D. from the College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1923. As a medical student, he was awarded the Meyerhof Prize in 1921. He specialized in allergy medicine and pediatrics. In the 1920s and 1930s, Abramson traveled widely, and was affiliated with laboratories at Johns Hopkins and Harvard, as well as the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical Chemistry and Electrochemistry in Berlin. He also began long affiliations with laboratories at Mount Sinai Hospital and at Cold Spring Harbor. Returning to P&S;, he became Assistant Professor of Physiology from 1935 to 1942 and joined the staff at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City in 1941, cultivating an interest in asthma and pulmonary disease, and where he was the first ever to use aerosolized penicillin.Niss, Barbara. This House of Noble Deeds: The Mount Sinai Hospital, 1852‚Äì2002, New York: NYU Press, 2002, He was on military leave from 1943 to August of 1946, and during this period he earned the United States Army‚Äôs Legion of Merit ‚Äúfor vital contributions to the Chemical Warfare Service and thus to the war effort‚Äù for work involving aerosol penicillin. He returned to P&S; in September of 1946, and became Assistant Clinical Professor of Physiology from 1948-57. During the 1950s, Abramson was involved in LSD research conducted at Mount Sinai and funded by the CIA, and he appears in the Church Commission‚Äôs investigation of CIA practices. His later career was spent at Mount Sinai Hospital and other hospitals in the New York area, finally leaving Mount Sinai Hospital in 1959. While at Mount Sinai Hospital in 1953, Abramson proposed an $85,000 study to the CIA on the effects of LSD on unwitting hospital patients. This was the same year that the MKULTRA program was established. Funding for the project was funneled through the Macy Foundation. Abramson was an attending physician in connection with the tragic (and allegedly LSD-induced) apparent suicide of Frank Olson, a microbiologist who was covertly given LSD as part of the CIA's psychotropic drug research. Beginning in 1954, Abramson published a series of articles on the effects of LSD on Siamese fighting fish. He is said to be the person who influenced many members of the Cybernetics Group to turn to LSD, including Frank Fremont-Smith, head of the Macy foundation. (The Cybernetics Group, originally named The Conference on Feedback Mechanisms in Biology and the Social Sciences, was started in 1946). He was also an organizer of the six international LSD conferences, the first being held in 1959. In 1967, he edited the book The Use of LSD in Psychotherapy and Alcoholism.Abramson, Harold Alexander.

The dolls portray eight- to twelve-year-old girls of a variety of ethnicities, time periods of origin, faiths, and social classes. They are sold with accompanying books told from the viewpoint of the girls. Originally the stories focused on various periods of American history, but were expanded in 1995 to include characters and stories from contemporary life. Aside from the original American Girl dolls, the buyer also has the option to purchase dolls that look like themselves. The options for the line of Truly Me dolls include eye color, face mold, skin color, hair texture, and hair length. A variety of related clothing and accessories is also available. A service for ordering a custom-made doll with features and clothing specified by the owner, dubbed Create Your Own, has also been introduced in 2017. Pleasant Company was founded in 1986 by Pleasant Rowland, and its products were originally purchasable by mail order only. In 1998, Pleasant Company became a subsidiary of Mattel. The company has been awarded the Oppenheim Toy Portfolio Award eight times. Dolls and accessories The Historical Characters line of 18-inch dolls, which were derived from the 18-inch dolls made by G√∂tz in West Germany (known as Germany from October 1990) during the late 1980s to the 1990s, were initially the main focus of Pleasant Company, founded by Pleasant Rowland in 1986. This product line aims to teach aspects of American history through a six-book series from the perspective of a girl living in that time period. Pleasant Rowland came up with the idea after she returned from a trip to Colonial Williamsburg, where she noticed there was a significant void in the toy market for younger aged dolls and saw an opportunity to provide an alternative to baby and adult dolls. Although the books are written for girls who are at least eight years old, they endeavor to cover significant topics such as child labor, child abuse, poverty, racism, slavery, animal abuse and war in manners appropriate for the understanding and sensibilities of their young audience. In 1995, Pleasant Company released a line of contemporary dolls called American Girl of Today. In 2006, the product line was renamed Just Like You; it was changed again in 2010, to My American Girl, and in 2015 to Truly Me. This line has included seventy-seven different dolls over the years. Each doll has a different combination of face mold, skin tone, eye color, and hair color, length, texture, and/or style. American Girl states that this variety allows customers to choose dolls that \\"represent the individuality and diversity of today's American girls.\\" A wide variety of contemporary clothing, accessories, and furniture is also available, and there are regular releases and retirements to update this line. Each year, a Girl of the Year doll is released who has her own special talent; for example, Mia St. Clair, the Girl of the Year for 2008, was an ice skater, and Marisol Luna, the Girl of the Year for 2005, was a dancer. Bitty Baby is a line of 15\\" baby dolls targeted to children aged three and older. They are cheaper than the 18\\" dolls, and currently retail at $60 each. The Bitty Twins line debuted in 2003 to represent slightly older toddlers and/or preschoolers. The Bitty Twins were the same size as the Bitty Baby dolls. They were discontinued in June 2016. Hopscotch Hill School was released by American Girl in 2003. The dolls were tall, came with jointed limbs and painted eyes, and had a slimmer overall body shape. They, along with the stories which came with the dolls written by Valerie Tripp, were aimed at elementary-age girls from four to six years old, and were sold until 2006. A reboot of the Historical Characters line dubbed as BeForever was launched in August 2014, complete with redesigned outfits, a two-volume compilation of previously-released books, and a \\"Journey Book\\" for each character, with players taking the role of a present-day girl who found her way to the past and met up with one of the Historical girls. The line also coincided with the relaunch of Samantha Parkington, whose collection was previously discontinued in 2008. In June 2016, American Girl unveiled Wellie Wishers, a separate doll line similar to Hopscotch Hill School aimed for younger children and with a focus on the outdoors, positioning it between Bitty Baby and the BeForever/Girl of the Year/Truly Me dolls. As the name implies, dolls from the line wear Wellington boots, and have a body design distinct from the classic, G√∂tz-derived American Girl dolls. The line was released on June 23, 2016. The names of the Wellie Wishers are: Willa, Camille, Kendall, Emerson, and Ashlyn. In February 2017, American Girl released a new line of 18\\" dolls called contemporary characters. The first doll in the line was Tenney Grant, an aspiring country singer and songwriter. Other dolls of the contemporary line include Logan, Tenney's bandmate and American Girl's first ever boy doll, and Z Yang, who is interested in photography and making stop motion videos. In December 2019, there is a report of declining sales for The American Girl Doll Brand. Characters=Films In 2004, American Girl teamed with Julia Roberts's Red Om production company and to create the first American Girl direct-to-video movie, Samantha: An American Girl Holiday. The film spawned a franchise that was followed by Felicity: An American Girl Adventure (2005), Molly: An American Girl on the Home Front (2006), along with the 2008 theatrically released film Kit Kittredge: An American Girl. In 2009, HBO premiered An American Girl: Chrissa Stands Strong. In July 2012, American Girl released a direct-to-video movie, McKenna Shoots for the Stars. A seventh movie based on Saige Copeland's stories entitled Saige Paints the Sky was released in July 2013, and a television film entitled Isabelle Dances Into the Spotlight, based on Girl of the Year 2014 Isabelle Palmer, was released in 2014. A ninth film based on 2015 Girl of the Year Grace Thomas was released under the title An American Girl: Grace Stirs Up Success, with Olivia Rodrigo playing the title role. A live-action web special based on Melody Ellison's stories entitled An American Girl Story - Melody 1963: Love Has to Win was released by Amazon, starring Marsai Martin as the title character. Love Has to Win was then followed by An American Girl Story - Maryellen 1955: Extraordinary Christmas, starring Alyvia Alyn Lind as Maryellen Larkin and released by Amazon on November 25, 2016. American Girl Store American Girl Place in The Grove at Farmers Market in Los Angeles, California The American Girl store sells American Girl dolls, clothes, and accessories. The first store, the 35,000 square-foot American Girl Place, designed by Nancye Green of Donovan/Green, debuted in Chicago in 1998. It was followed by stores in New York City and Los Angeles. In May 2014, Mattel American Girl opened new stores in Toronto, Ontario and Vancouver, British Columbia in Canada in partnership with Indigo Books and Music. The company has also expressed interest in other overseas ventures, as they are seeing orders from Europe and Latin America. In 2015, the company announced that they were expanding operations in Mexico with two stores at El Palacio de Hierro‚Äôs Perisur and Interlomas in Mexico City, and a third in Polanco.

Online marketing and philanthropy American Girl launched Innerstar University, an online virtual world featuring the My American Girl contemporary doll line, on July 13, 2010. Access to the online world is via a Campus Guide, bundled with purchase of a My American Girl doll, which contains an access code for the creation of a doll avatar that then navigates the various games, shops, and challenges of the virtual campus of Innerstar U. In 2015, when My American Girl dolls were changed to Truly Me dolls, this website was closed down. The launch was simultaneous with Shine on Now, a fund-raising effort Kids In Distressed Situations, National Association of Children's Hospitals and Related Institutions, National Wildlife Federation, and Save the Children charities. The company has also donated \\"almost $500,000\\" over several years to national non-profit homeless housing group HomeAid. These contributions are mainly through its Project Playhouse program. Reception The company has drawn criticism for the expense of the dolls, which cost $115 without accessories as of December 2014. Buyers can easily spend more than $600 for a doll, outfits, accessories and lunch in the company's store in New York. Some aspects of the doll's characters and history have also provoked controversy. Some observers questioned why Addy, American Girl's first African-American historical character, was portrayed first as a slave (in later stories Addy and her family gain their freedom after the Civil War), while Cecile Rey, American Girl's second black historical character, was portrayed as a well-to-do black girl in New Orleans. American Girl later went on with releasing their first African-American Girl of the Year, Gabriela McBride, who is portrayed as a dancer, artist, and poet. In 2005, residents of Pilsen (a neighborhood in Chicago, Illinois) criticized a passage in the book associated with the Latina-American doll Marisol, claiming it inaccurately depicted their neighborhood as dangerous. A senior public relations associate for American Girl responded to critics saying: ‚ÄúWe feel that this brief passage has been taken out of context in the book.\\" The 2009 limited-edition release of Gwen, a homeless American Girl character, was also controversial. In 2005, some pro- life and Catholic groups criticized the company for donating funds to the organization Girls, Inc., which supports underprivileged girls and promotes abortion rights and LGBT acceptance. The American Girl Place store in New York City was the center of a labor dispute with Actors' Equity Association (AEA). On August 3, 2006, 14 of the 18 adult actors at the store's now defunct theater went on strike. AEA reached a two-year contract effective April 1, 2008. All American Girl Place theatres were subsequently closed in September of that year. In May 2014, the company was met with criticism on social media over its decision to discontinue four characters from the historical collection, two of them, namely African-American C√©cile Rey and Chinese- American Ivy Ling, representing ethnic minorities. They however defended their move as a business decision, as they decided to \\"move away from the character- friend strategy within the line\\". A petition has since been filed through the activist group 18MillionRising.org for the company to provide a replacement for Ivy. The company has also drawn criticism for its recent focus on the contemporary line, specifically the Girl of the Year characters and their backstory, to which was viewed as lacking depth and more important issues in comparison to the Historical/BeForever characters' backstories. My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic series creator Lauren Faust also expressed her concern and criticism of the line in a Twitter post, stating it \\"was once radically positive for girls before it was homogenized for money\\". In July 2020 an internet meme in the form of a parody advertisement for a fictional Girl of the Year character depicted as a personification of the \\"Karen\\" stereotype, wearing a track suit, bob haircut and openly carrying a semi- automatic pistol while defiantly violating face mask guidelines mandated due to the 2019-2020 COVID-19 pandemic, provoked criticism from American Girl who took umbrage to the use of their name and trade dress, stating that they were \\"disgusted\\" by a post from brand strategist Adam Padilla under the online persona \\"Adam the Creator\\", and \\"are working with the appropriate teams at American Girl to ensure this copyright violation is handled appropriately.\\" Boing Boing however expressed doubts over the merits of American Girl's proposed legal action against the \\"Karen\\" parodies citing the Streisand effect, though it has also noted the debate on whether the satirical intent of the parody advertisement is protected by law. Permanent underwear controversy American Girl attracted considerable criticism in February 2017 when they announced that they will be changing the dolls' bodies to incorporate permanently stitched panties on contemporary dolls and certain BeForever character dolls, namely Maryellen, Melody and Julie. Public reaction to the permanent underwear‚Äîthe first major change since the transition to flesh-colored bodies in 1991 following the release of the Felicity doll‚Äîwas overwhelmingly negative, as fans of the franchise complained that it stifles customization and devalued a well-established and successful brand \\"from heirloom quality to be passed down for generations to low-quality retail.\\" The company then reversed its decision in a Facebook post in May 2017, stating that any existing or upcoming dolls from the line will revert to the old body design, and customers who bought a doll with permanent underwear are eligible for a \\"one-time\\" exchange to have the dolls retrofitted with conventional torsos. In addition, the company has switched back to the old \\"iconic boutique box\\" packaging following complaints by collectors who deemed the new boxes to be inferior and more susceptible to damage. Fandom YouTube videos made with American Girl Dolls are becoming increasingly popular. In 2015, the American Girl fan community, more specifically the practice of creating and uploading American Girl doll-based stop motion videos, (AGSM for short) was featured in a news report for BBC News' Trending site, along with interviews and videos from several prominent doll community members. Besides stop-motion animations and music videos set to popular music, the report covers recurring subject matters in the said clips such as cyberbullying and other social issues among children and teenagers, along with doll customization, photoshoots and unboxing videos showing new and discontinued clothes, accessories and dolls from the company. Besides YouTube, social media services such as Instagram and Facebook serve as platforms for fans of the toy line, spawning a community called AGIG, or American Girl Instagram, who photograph their dolls and post their photos on the service. Although mostly made up of girls usually around the age of 12-18, a number of boys and adults also participate and congregate on AGIG. American Girl's teenage fans, particularly ones on AGTube and AGIG, will meet up with other fans at American Girl stores. At the release of Lea Clark and Gabriela McBride, certain prominent community members were included in the \\"Clue\\" videos released by American Girl. At the release of Z Yang, American Girl hosted meetups at their New York City flagship store and at their Dallas location. In 2019, the American Girls Podcast, a book-by-book exploration of the series, launched. Co-hosted by historians Allison Horrocks and Mary Mahoney, each episode discusses one book from the series, contextualizing the story presented and making connections to elements of pop culture. The podcast has received positive attention from many media outlets, including the New York Times.

He served as Chief of Engineers from 1798 to 1802. Early life Henry Burbeck was born in Boston on June 10, 1754, the son of William Burbeck and his wife Jerusha Glover of Boston. His father was a British colonial officer in the ordnance department and second in command of Castle William in Boston Harbor, but gave up his commission and supported the patriot cause when hostilities broke out. Burbeck's education consisted of a public writing school in the North End of Boston under John Tileston (1735‚Äì1826). He would later credit his father with the remainder of his education.Drake, Francis S., Memorials of the Society of Cincinnati of Massachusetts, Boston, 1873, Page 246. Prior to his military service, Henry worked at the copper-smith's forge with Paul Revere.New London Day, \\"Famous General of the Revolution Early Recollections of Brig. Gen. Henry Burbeck of New London,\\" February 25, 1907, Page 7, Col. 1-2. He married his first wife, Abigail Webb, on April 12, 1775, in Boston. Revolutionary War service At the outbreak of the Battle of Lexington, Burbeck's father escaped to Cambridge and reported to the Committee on Public Safety and its leader, General Joseph Warren, to join the patriot cause which resulted in a price being placed on his head by the British.New London Day, \\"Miss Burbeck Dead Daughter of Soldier at Bunker Hill,\\" July 14, 1897, Page 6, Col. 1. Burbeck joined his father in Cambridge where they made ammunition used at the Battle of Bunker Hill and also participated in the battle. Henry served as a lieutenant in the Battle of Bunker Hill and his commission was signed by General Joseph Warren on May 19, 1775.Drake, Francis S., Memorials of the Society of Cincinnati of Massachusetts, Boston, 1873, Page 246. Following the Battle of Bunker Hill, Burbeck married Abigail Webb on August 12, 1775, in Boston. He was assigned as a lieutenant of artillery to the Massachusetts line commanded by Colonel Richard Gridley, the Continental Army's first Chief Engineer and artillery commander, in 1775. Washington's campaigns In 1777, he briefly joined the army at Saratoga until he was assigned to Pennsylvania to join Gen. George Washington's army. He fought in the battles of Brandywine and Germantown.Drake, Francis S., Memorials of the Society of Cincinnati of Massachusetts, Boston, 1873, Page 247. He remained in the Artillery Corps under General Henry Knox and, in 1777, assumed command of a company of the 3rd Continental Artillery Regiment commanded by Colonel John Crane. He marched with General Washington and the Continental Army from Valley Forge to New Jersey in 1778. Following the march, he fought in the Battle of Monmouth. His unit was sent North and he remained in White Plains, New York, to defend the Hudson Highlands from 1779-1783. He marched into New York City when the British army evacuated it at the close of the Revolutionary War. Burbeck became an original member of the Society of the Cincinnati upon its founding in 1783. He served as president of the Massachusetts Society of the Cincinnati from 1846 until his death in 1848. Burbeck knew General George Washington personally from his service and it was from Burbeck's associations with foreign officers serving in the American Revolution that he recognized the need to educate and train the army in artillery and engineering. Burbeck recommended the establishment of West Point Military Academy. Career in the Early Republic Burbeck was honorably discharged from the Continental Army in January 1784. In October 1786 he was re-commissioned as captain of a company of artillery, one of four in a battalion commanded by Major John Doughty, and commanded the post at West Point, New York, from 1787 to 1789. In 1787, he was ordered by General Knox to Springfield, Massachusetts, to protect the arsenal there is the aftermath of Shays' Rebellion. His wife Abigail died in June 1790 in Bath, Maine.Salem Gazette, Obituary, July 27, 1790, Page 3.Worcester Magazine, Obituary, July 29, 1790, Page 3. Creek Treaty attempt Burbeck was promoted to Major Commandant of the Artillery on March 16, 1792. He commanded the Army's Battalion of Artillery and served as General Anthony Wayne's Chief of Artillery in the Northwest Indian War in 1792-1794. He was ordered, on August 29, 1789, to Georgia to serve as a guard to Major General Benjamin Lincoln and Colonel Humphries during the unsuccessful treaty negotiation with the Creek people. He returned to Georgia in 1790 and built a fort on the St. Mary's River.Drake, Francis S., Memorials of the Society of Cincinnati of Massachusetts, Boston, 1873, Page 246. Fort Recovery Burbeck established Fort Recovery in Ohio in 1794 which was named after the lost cannons that were recovered at the site of in the aftermath of St. Clair's defeat by the Indians in 1791. Burbeck buried 200 skulls and numerous bones from Arthur St. Clair's defeat and interred them. Two brass cannons from the 1791 action, recovered by Burbeck in the Wabash, were discharged in honor of the deceased.Drake, Francis S., Memorials of the Society of Cincinnati of Massachusetts, Boston, 1873, Page 246. Fort Mackinac Burbeck oversaw the transfer of power from British to American control of Fort Mackinac in 1796, 13 years after the Treaty of Paris was signed. He served at the fort through 1799. From 1798 to 1802, Burbeck was the senior regimental commander of artillerists and engineers. He also commanded the Eastern Department of the Army in 1800 and in that year endorsed the creation of a corps of engineers separate from the artillerists. He was Chief of the new Artillery Corps from 1802 to 1815, first as a colonel and then during the War of 1812 as a brevet brigadier general. During the Jefferson administration (1801‚Äì1809), Burbeck successfully developed and tested domestically produced cast-iron artillery pieces. Court Martial of Gen. James Wilkinson In 1808, he served on the Court of Inquiry, ordered by President Madison, held at Morin's Tavern in Philadelphia, investigating General James Wilkinson for receiving a pension from the Spanish government while serving in the United States military.Middlesex Gazette, January 14, 1808, Page 3. Previously, Wilkinson had been a member of the Conway Cabal against Washington and resigned from the army. He received the governorship of Louisiana by Thomas Jefferson in 1805. Wilkinson's close relationship with the Spanish government led to a confrontation with Aaraon Burr which ultimately resulted in accusations that Wilkinson was tied to the Spanish government. Other members of the Court of Inquiry included Colonel Thomas Cushing of the Infantry and Colonel Jonathan Williams of the Engineers. In September 1811, during the court martial, Wilkinson took exception to the presence of Burbeck and two other members of the court and they were all replaced.Norwich Courier, \\"Washington City September 10,\\" September 18, 1811, Page 2. Wilkinson was found not guilty on December 25, 1811. War of 1812 service At the beginning of the War of 1812, Burbeck was summoned to New London, Connecticut, to relieve Jirah Isham of the command of the state militia. At the same time he was placed in command of Military District No. 2 comprising the states of Connecticut and Rhode Island. While stationed in New London, he received orders to march to Boston to take command there during the blockade by a British squadron commanded by Commodore Sir Thomas Hardy.Norwich Courier, \\"U.S. Military Arrangements, March 31, 1813, Page 2. The winter march resulted in the suffering of many of the men under his command who were frostbitten from exposure to the winter elements. During the march, Burbeck refused any favors offered to him that were not also given to his men.New London Day, Famous General of the Revolution Early Recollections of Brig. Gen. Henry Burbeck of New London, February 25, 1907, Page 7, Col. 1-2. After returning to New London, in July 1813, he received a letter from Gen. Armstrong which enclosed a copy of a letter written by the Governor of Virginia stating that information from British deserters indicated that British transports, under Admiral George Cockburn, sailed from Chesapeake Bay to New London, Connecticut.Connecticut Mirror, \\"New London, July 21,\\" July 13, 1813, Page 3. Burbeck responded by organizing the state militia to respond while Hardy's fleet lay off New London harbor. Burbeck continued in command of New London to the end of the war. General Burbeck retired from the Army in June 1815, when the Army was reduced following the signing of the Treaty of Ghent, which ended the war. At the time of Burbeck's retirement, he had served a total of 37 years in the Continental Army and the United States Army. He was one of the relatively few officers who had served in both the American Revolution and the War of 1812. Later life Burbeck married Lucy Elizabeth Rudd Caldwell on December 13, 1813 in New London, Connecticut.City of New London Vital Records, Vol. 3, Page 243. She was the daughter of Corp. Daniel Rudd Jr. and Abigail Allen.Town of Bozrah Vital Records, Vol. 1, Page 73. She was first married to Capt. Henry Caldwell of the Marines who died March 12, 1812 at Charlestown, Massachusetts. Caldwell was on the Little Belt during the Little Belt affair, an event that is regarded as one of the causes of the War of 1812, and he testified during the Court of Inquiry on the Little Belt Affair which convened in New York in September 1811. Lucy was a descendant of Gov. William Bradford (1590-1657) of the Mayflower and Jonathan Rudd who was married, in a legendary ceremony, at Bride Brook in what is now East Lyme, Connecticut in December 1646. Burbeck was the same exact age as Lucy's father Daniel Rudd Jr., both being born on June 10, 1754. At the time of his marriage to Lucy, Burbeck was 29 years her senior. General Burbeck purchased a home at 114 Main St., in New London, Connecticut, in 1815. The house was built in 1735 and was one of the few houses in New London that remained after the city was burned by the British in 1781. Gen. Burbeck and his wife lived in the house until he died in 1848.\\"New London Day, \\"Wants Old Home of Gen. Burbeck Here Preserved,\\" Feb. 15, 1928, Page 11, Cols. 1-2. In 1846, being one of the very few surviving officers who had served in the Revolution, Burbeck was elected president of the Massachusetts Society of the Cincinnati and served in that position until his death two years later. Children Burbeck and his second wife had six children, all born in New London: Susan Henrietta (b. September 23, 1815), Charlotte Augusta (b. March 8, 1818 in New London, Conn., d. July 13, 1897 in New London, Conn.), Henry William (b. May 31, 1819 in New London, Conn., d. February 19, 1840 at sea), Mary Elizabeth (b. March 7, 1821 in New London, Conn., d. July 13, 1897), William Henry (b. October 8, 1823 in New London, Conn., d. February 28, 1905 in New London, Conn.) and John Cathcart (b. February 9, 1825 in New London, Conn., d. April 28, 1904 in New London, Conn.).City of New London Vital Records, Vol. 3, Page 243. Burbeck hoped that his son Henry would follow in his military footsteps, but Henry died when he tried to test his strength by lifting a keg of silver dollars which fell on his foot and severed his toe while at sea on a revenue cutter. By the time the cutter reached New York and a physician was summoned, it was too late and he died. Thereafter, Gen. Burbeck was so overcome by grief that he would not have his son's name spoken in his house.New London Day, Famous General of the Revolution Early Recollections of Brig. Gen. Henry Burbeck of New London, February 25, 1907, Page 7, Col. 1-2. In his later years, he enjoyed the company of Capt. Bulkeley who also retired to New London. They maintained a close relationship despite the fact that Burbeck was a Whig and Bulkeley was a Democrat. Death right Burbeck died at his home on Main Street on October 2, 1848, in New London, Connecticut just months after his friend Capt. Bulkeley died.New London Day, Famous General of the Revolution Early Recollections of Brig. Gen. Henry Burbeck of New London, February 25, 1907, Page 7, Col. 1-2. The Massachusetts Society of Cincinnati, of which Burbeck was a member, erected a monument to him in Cedar Grove Cemetery (Sec. 4, Lot 1), New London, Connecticut. The inscription on the monument states: > The Massachusetts Society of the Cincinnati Dedicate This Monument to the > Memory of Their Late Honored President. He Was An Officer of the Army From > the Commencement of the Revolutionary War Until The Close of His Life By a > Patriotic and Faithful Discharge of the High and Responsible Duties of a > Gallant Soldier And An Exemplary Citizen He Has Been Justly And Eminently > Distinguished As He Was Rightfully and Universally Respected. His wife Lucy died February 22, 1880, in New London and at the time of her death was one of the last in the nation to receive a Revolutionary War pension which was $130 a quarter in 1875.Hartford Daily Courant, \\"The Oldest Pensioner,\\" December 29, 1875, Page 1. Burbeck's daughter Charlotte was made an honorary member of the Lucretia Shaw chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution.New London Day, \\"Miss Burbeck Dead Daughter of Soldier at Bunker Hill,\\" July 14, 1897, Page 6, Col. 1. Induction Into the Connecticut Hall of Fame Gen. Henry Burbeck was nominated into the Connecticut Hall of Fame on February 24, 2016. It was Wyatt Kopp, a cousin of Lucy Rudd Burbeck, who nominated him back in 2013. He was finally accepted into the Hall of Fame in 2016. The Connecticut Hall of Fame is located at the Legislative Office Building in Hartford, Connecticut which is directly linked to the state capital building. The ceremony for his induction into the Connecticut Hall of Fame will be held on March 7, 2016 at the Legislative Office Building.

In Stalinist ideology and practice, deviationism is an expressed belief which does not accord with official party doctrine for the time and area. Accusations of deviationism often led to purges. Forms of deviationism included revisionism, dogmatism, bourgeois nationalism, and rootless cosmopolitanism. Mao Zedong in a 1953 speech referred to both \\"left\\" and \\"right\\" deviationists.Mao Zedong, Refute Right Deviationist Views That Depart From the General Line, June 15, 1953. Online at Marxists.org. Accessed online 2009-10-11. Years later, in 1976, the so-called Gang of Four would strike out against \\"rightist deviationism\\" in China. Criticize Rightist Deviationism (1976), ChinesePosters.net, International Institute of Social History. Accessed online 2009-10-11. Trotskyism Leon Trotsky believed that Lenin's pre-1917 idea of the \\"dictatorship of the proletariat\\" needed to be re-worded to emphasize the importance of the proletariat's leadership in such an alliance, because the peasantry were dialectically less capable of leadership. In order to finish a socialist revolution, the revolution would have to be world-wide. This is in sharp contrast to Joseph Stalin's idea of \\"socialism in one country;\\" Trotsky felt that if a socialist nation-state was isolated, it would soon be destroyed by outside imperialist forces. Trotsky emphasized the importance of soviets (independent councils of workers) and the idea that a communist society will be a \\"workers' democracy\\". According to Trotskyist doctrine,James Burnham, The Managerial Revolution, Indiana University Press, Bloomingham 1966, p.v. the Soviet Union became a \\"degenerated workers state\\" and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) as \\"bureaucratic centralist\\". Trotskyites considered the Soviet degenerated workers state still as \\"revolutionary workers' state\\" or \\"proletarian dictatorship\\". As such, the Soviet state was \\"historically progressive\\" in relation to \\"reactionary capitalism\\". Hence it was the duty of revolutionists in all nations, even if they were opponents of Stalin and his regime, to defend the Soviet Union against any \\"imperialist\\" state, including their own fatherland. Another revolution was necessary however to unseat the Stalinists, who would destroy the workers state until it became fully capitalist. Browderism Before World War II the Communist Party USA (CPUSA) had always received directives and funds from the Soviet Union via courier. Moscow's most effective control had been through Comintern representatives.Louis Budenz, Men Without Faces: The Communist Conspiracy in the USA, Harper and Brothers, New York, 1948, pp. 4-5, 55, 68-69, 78-81. Earl Browder, CPUSA leader, accepted the Hitler-Stalin pact of August 1939 without hesitation. Comintern did find it necessary to fine-tune the CPUSA's stance. Immediately after the Pact, Georgi Dimitrov, chief of the Comintern, sent a ciphered message to Browder explaining that the CPUSA's line supporting the Pact was not fully correct because while it broke with President Franklin Roosevelt's policy of supporting Britain, France, and Lend-Lease aid, it failed to take the additional step of breaking with FDR's domestic policies as well. Browder and the CPUSA immediately made the required changes in its policies, and in 1940 the CPUSA did its best to oppose FDR's reelection to the presidency.Harvey Klehr, John Earl Haynes, and Kyrill M. Anderson, The Soviet World of American Communism, New Haven: Yale University Press, 1998, pp. 71‚Äì84. World War II reduced the direct organization ties of CPUSA to Comintern and drastically reduced the volume of communications. Postal communications was less reliable and often delayed and subject to government inspection. International cable traffic was routinely reviewed by war-time security officials. Travel to the USSR became increasingly difficult. In 1940 the Voorhis Act was passed imposing regulatory requirements on domestic American organizations with foreign government ties. To avoid the Voorhis Act, in November 1940, CPUSA, with Comintern permission, severed its official membership in the Communist International, and the last officially designated CPUSA representative in Moscow left in 1941.Klehr, Haynes, and Anderson, The Soviet World, pp. 87‚Äì88. Browder developed the doctrine of indefinite collaboration with capitalism and the Harry Bridges doctrine of postwar extension of the no-strike pledge. The wartime coalition gave Browder the vision of an Americanized Communist Party working with other American parties to solve the urgent questions facing the nation. To this end he began a policy of naturalizing the party, relaxing its discipline, and moderating its sectarianism. He transformed the wartime tactic of national unity into a postwar strategy and argued the possibility that progressive capitalism, to save itself, would embark on policies favorable to the workers at home and to the Soviet Union abroad. In April 1945, however, Jacques Duclos of the French Communist Party, formerly high in the Comintern, published a repudiation of Browderism. Jaques Duclos, On the Dissolution of the Communist Party of the United States,. Published in Cahiers du Communisme, April 1945. Reprinted in William Z. Foster et al. Marxism-Leninism vs. Revisionism. (New York: New Century Publishers, Feb. 1946), pp. 21-35 in original. Publication of the attack by the New York World-Telegram panicked the CPUSA into drastic action against Browder: they unceremoniously expelled him in February 1946. Titoism Titoism is a form of Leninism based on the regime of Marshal Josip Broz Tito post-World War II in Yugoslavia. While formerly heading a Comintern liberation movement, after the war Tito broke with Moscow and insisted Yugoslavia was to be non-aligned with neither NATO nor the Warsaw Pact. Tito called for \\"national unity\\" and \\"self-management\\" which enabled Yugoslavia to form relationships independent of the superpowers with other governments during the Cold War. Maoism Maoism mixes orthodox Marxism‚ÄìLeninism with populism. Named after its originator Mao Zedong, the ideology relies on militant, insurrectionary and populist strategies in movement organizing (People's Wars, Cultural Revolution, Peasant Uprising, etc.). Like Stalin, Mao's China relied on Five-Year Plans, the best-known of which was the Great Leap Forward. This view of the CCP contrasted sharply with the view of Moscow whose ideology was in line with orthodoxy of historical materialism of Marxism's early thinkers, that socialist societies must be preceded by capitalist societies, which would provide the material basis for a socialist economy. This orthodox theory of Marxism relied heavily on a dialectical \\"force of history\\" that would bring about the \\"objective conditions\\" necessary for a proletarian revolution to succeed. Any ideological concepts running counter to this thesis, that is, any formulations which called for skipping stages of historic development were considered in the orthodox view as adventurist and counter revolutionary.Foreign Influence - Weather Underground Organization (WUO).

While some of these young activists were drawn to the Progressive Labor Party (PLP), the full flowering of American Maoism would not come until the proliferation of new groups such as the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), Weather Underground (WUO), Black Panthers (BPP) and the Communist Party (Marxist‚ÄìLeninist) (CP-ML) after 1969.

Mini√© balls. The Springfield Model 1863 is a .58 caliber rifled musket manufactured by the Springfield Armory between 1863 and 1865. The Model 1863 was only a minor improvement over the Springfield Model 1861. As such, it is sometimes classified as just a variant of the Model 1861. The Model 1861, with all of its variants, was the most commonly used longarm in the American Civil War, with over 700,000 manufactured. The Model 1863 also has the distinction of being the last muzzle-loading longarm produced by the Springfield Armory. The Model 1863 was produced in two variants. The Type I eliminated the band springs and replaced the flat barrel bands with oval clamping bands. It also featured a new ramrod, a case-hardened lock, a new hammer, and a redesigned bolster (percussion chamber). Several of these modifications were based upon Colt's contract model 1861, known as the \\"Colt special\\". 273,265 Type I variants were manufactured in 1863. The Type II is sometimes referred to as the Model 1864, but is more commonly referred to as just a variant of the Model 1863. This version re-introduced band springs, replaced the clamping bands with solid oval bands, and replaced the three leaf rear sight with single leaf sight. A total of 255,040 of these were manufactured from 1864 to 1865. By the end of the Civil War, muzzle-loading rifles and muskets were considered obsolete. In the years following the Civil War, many Model 1863 muskets were converted into breech-loading \\"Trapdoor Springfields\\". The breech-loading weapons increased the rate of fire from three to four rounds per minute to eight to ten rounds per minute. The Model 1863 could be converted to breech-loading for about five dollars, at a time when a new rifle would cost about twenty dollars. The conversion of Model 1863 rifles therefore represented a significant cost savings to the U.S. military. (The US Military never adopted the converted Springfields although many were used by various European militaries) See also *List of individual weapons of the U.S. Armed Forces *List of wars involving the United States *Military history of the United States *United States Armed Forces *Military of the Confederate States of America *Charleville musket *Brown Bess *Potzdam Musket 1723 *M1752 Musket *Springfield musket *Harpers Ferry Model 1803 *M1819 Hall rifle *Pattern 1853 Enfield *Springfield Rifle *Richmond rifle *Fayetteville rifle *Springfield Model 1865 First model \\"Trapdoor Springfield\\" based on the Model 1863 *Springfield Model 1866 Second model \\"Trapdoor Springfield\\" based on the Model 1863 *Musket *Rifle *Carbine *American Civil War reenactment External links * Loading, firing, and discussing the Springfield Model 1863 References * Earl J.

The music is a mixture of punk and rock and roll. \\"L.A.M.F.\\" stands for \\"Like a Mother Fucker\\"; in a 1977 interview in the UK monthly magazine ZigZag, Thunders said this originated from New York gang graffiti. Thunders claimed the gangs would add the LAMF tag after writing their gang name. However, if they were on another gang's territory they would write \\"D.T.K.L.A.M.F\\" (Down to Kill Like a Mother Fucker). The original, vinyl release of the album has been criticised for having a lackluster sound despite several attempts to remix it.  Background  The Heartbreakers had been trying to get a record contract in the United States since their formation in 1975. In the autumn of 1976, Malcolm McLaren, who had informally managed the New York Dolls in their waning days, invited the band to come to England and participate in the Sex Pistols' Anarchy tour, along with The Clash and The Damned, who were replaced by Buzzcocks shortly after the tour commenced. The band accepted the offer, arriving in London on December 1, the same day that the Pistols swore at Bill Grundy on live, prime-time television, which precipitated the cancellation of most of the tour. Stranded in England with little money after the Anarchy tour came to a halt, the band contemplated a retreat to New York, but their manager, Leee Black Childers, convinced them to stay in England, believing that they would be more successful there. After several gigs in London, Track Records offered the Heartbreakers a recording contract. Track asked the band to sign to the company as \\"The Chris Stamp Band Ltd.\\" a holding company owned by Track, with the proviso that if that holding company went out of business, the rights to any recordings the band made would revert to the band's own business partnership. The band agreed and signed on to Track.  Recording session order  The band prepared for the album with a three-day demo session at Essex Studios in late February 1977, followed by two live shows at London's Speakeasy Club, which were recorded by Track Records for future release. Six songs: \\"All By Myself\\", \\"Let Go\\", \\"Get Off The Phone\\", \\"I Wanna Be Loved\\", \\"Can't Keep My Eyes On You\\", and \\"I Love You\\" were recorded at Essex with Track staff producer Speedy Keen. The band then switched to Ramport Studios (owned by The Who) to record eight more songs. During a break in the recording, the Who's Pete Townshend invited the Heartbreakers to appear as extras in the movie version of Quadrophenia.  Post-production  Mixing the recording was problematic. The band went to different studios, each member trying their own mixes. Each mix would be considered and rejected, after which band members returned to the studio to try to remix it. The band was later alleged to have used taxicabs to commute between London and Birmingham, billed to Track Records, to replenish their drug supply. The mixing sessions lasted through the summer of 1977, as they continued playing live.  Critical reception  L.A.M.F. would be released by Track Records on October 3, 1977. Critic Jon Savage wrote in Sounds magazine, \\"The sounds (mostly) are great, the playing assured ... so what's the problem? The mixing. The fantasy that they are includes an element of self-destruction, and here's where it operates ‚Äî they can't seem to get it quite right ... Whichever way, some of the songs ... sound muddy ‚Äî irritating 'cause you know how good they be.\\" Jerry Nolan told the rest of the band that if the album was released \\"without a proper mix\\", he would see no reason to remain in the band. Nolan quit during a UK tour, during which time Sex Pistols drummer Paul Cook filled in, until Nolan was asked to return as a hired hand. Music critic Robert Christgau named the album one of the few import-only records from the 1970s he loved yet omitted from Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981).  Resurrection  After Track Records went out of business, manager Leee Black Childers acquired The Heartbreakers' tapes; the Essex demos, the Speakeasy live recordings and the masters from the L.A.M.F. sessions, including thirty- five reels full of various mixes, from the Track Records offices, due in part to the contract provision the band signed early in 1977. In 1982, the rights to The Heartbreakers' tapes were acquired from Childers, acting on behalf of the band partnership, by Jungle Records, an independent English label. Jungle convinced Thunders and former Generation X bassist Tony James (then with Sigue Sigue Sputnik) to remix L.A.M.F.. Johnny Thunders died in 1991 and Jerry Nolan died in 1992. In 1994, Jungle Records executive Alan Hauser had The Heartbreakers' tapes reviewed, and had the best available mixes preserved on Digital Audio Tape. It was soon discovered by Hauser that many of the original mixes left behind by The Heartbreakers were best suited to the band's protopunk sound, while others had a sound similar to sixties pop hits. It was realized that the problem with the sound on the original Track Records release of L.A.M.F. was due to the manufacturing of the vinyl records. A rare cassette edition, released by Track at the same time, was said to \\"[sound] as if it had a shower, shave, coffee and a cigarette\\" (liner notes of 2002 reissue by Nina Antonia, p. 10). The 300-plus available mixes were narrowed down to a shortlist of 50 tracks, and London-area friends and colleagues of Johnny Thunders, including sometime Thunders collaborator Patti Palladin and journalist Nina Antonia, were asked for their input. The first edition of what is sometimes referred to as L.A.M.F.: The Lost '77 Mixes was released by Jungle in 1994. Eight years later, a remastered edition, appended with an MPEG video of \\"Chinese Rocks\\", was released. In 2012 Jungle released L.A.M.F.: Definitive Edition.

Originally the term referred only to muskets that had been produced as a smoothbore weapon and later had their barrels replaced with rifled barrels. The term later included rifles that directly replaced, and were of the same design overall as, a particular model of smoothbore musket. History and development In the early 19th century, there were rifles, and there were muskets. Muskets were smoothbore muzzle-loading weapons, firing round lead balls or buck and ball ammunition, that were also designed to accept a bayonet. Rifles were similar in that they used the same kind of flintlock or caplock firing mechanism, but the main difference was that their barrels were rifled - that is, their barrels had grooves cut into the interior surface which would cause the bullet to spin as it left the barrel. Rifles have the advantage of long range accuracy, because spinning bullets have far flatter and more stable trajectories than balls fired from smoothbore muskets. Muskets had the advantage of a faster rate of fire. A muzzle-loaded weapon required the bullet to fit snugly into the barrel. For a smoothbore weapon this can be a somewhat loose fit, but in the case of a rifle, the helical rifling lands in the barrel have to cut into the bullet to make it spin. The fit needs to be sufficiently tight for the bullet to engage the lands in order to impart spin; otherwise the bullet will wobble as it goes down the barrel, destroying its accuracy. Furthermore, if the barrel-to-bullet seal is not tight, gases will blow through the rifling grooves and around the bullet, compromising muzzle velocity, accuracy and the bullet's terminal energy at the target. Their greater accuracy and range made rifles ideal for hunting, but the slower rate of fire was a significant impediment for widespread military use, along with the fouling caused by normal firing which made them steadily more difficult to load. The smooth-bore musket was the main weapon of the line infantry and light infantry, and rifles were used only by snipers and other specialist troops. All muskets were supplied with bayonets, which allowed them to be used in melee combat. At the time, the Russian and French armies actively used light infantry (rangers and voltigeurs), and sometimes scattered whole infantry battalions as skirmishers to fight long-term on rough terrain.http://www.museum.ru/museum/1812/Library/Borodino_conf/2006/Celorungo.pdf Although rifles had better shooting accuracy than smoothbore muskets, their effective fire range was the same. For example, in the British Army, light infantrymen armed with ordinary muskets were trained for 300‚Äì400 yards.https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28260455-british-light-infantry- rifle-tactics-of-the-napoleonic-wars Since they were used as pikes, muskets tended to be fairly long and heavy weapons. They tended to be about four to six feet in length (six to eight feet including the bayonet), with a weight of around , as longer and heavier weapons were found to be too unwieldy. The length of a musket also allowed them to be fired by ranks, minimizing the risk that the men in the rear ranks would accidentally shoot the men in the front ranks in the back of the head, or, more likely, scorch their faces and burst their eardrums with the muzzle blast. Muskets six feet in length could be fired in three ranks without fear of accidents. The relative inaccuracy and short range of the musket was not considered to be significant on the battlefield, because smoke from the black powder used at the time quickly obscured the battlefield and rendered the longer range of the rifle useless, especially as a battle progressed. Rifles were more expensive to make than muskets, and were typically used by small units of specialized riflemen trained not to fight in closed ranks, but in open order, spread out as skirmishers or sharpshooters. Since they were not fired over other men‚Äôs shoulders or designed for close-combat bayonet fighting, military rifles could be much shorter than muskets, which also made loading from the muzzle easier and reduced the difficulties associated with fitting the bullet into the barrel, although the rate of fire was still slower than that of a musket. Various rifled musket projectiles The problem of slow loading of rifles caused by barrel fouling was solved by the Mini√© ball, which was invented in the 1840s by French inventor Claude-√âtienne Mini√©. Despite its name, the Mini√© ball was not a round ball at all ‚Äì it was long and conical, with an expanding skirt at the rear of the bullet. The skirt allowed the mini√© ball to be smaller than the barrel's bore, so it would slip in as easily as the ball of a smoothbore. When the weapon was fired, the skirt expanded to fit tightly against the inside of the rifle barrel, with less energy wasted in blow-by around the projectile and ensuring that the rifling lands and grooves would impart a stabilizing spin to the mini√© ball. In the 1840s and 1850s, many smoothbore muskets had their barrels replaced with similar barrels that were rifled so that they could fire the new bullet. These \\"rifled muskets\\" or \\"rifle muskets\\" were long enough to serve the function of muskets in close formations of line and square, were as quick to load as the old muskets and as easy to use with minimal training. Yet the Mini√©-type rifled muskets were much more accurate than smoothbore muskets. Tests of a rifled musket firing Mini√© ball, and a smoothbore musket firing round ball, at various ranges against a 10 by 10 inches (25 cm √ó 25 cm) target, showed much higher accuracy for the rifled musket.Claud E. Fuller, The Rifled Musket From a smooth-bore musket, from 42% to 48% of bullets hit the target at a distance of 200 yards. At a distance of 300 yards, 18% of the bullets hit the target. For a rifle, the results were much better. From a rifle, 46% to 58% of bullets hit the target at a distance of 300 yards; 24% to 42% at 500 yards.Justin Stanage (2002). The Rifle-Musket vs. The Smoothbore Musket, a Comparison of the Effectiveness of the Two Types of Weapons Primarily at Short Ranges. Class paper, Indiana University. This potential accuracy, however, required skills only acquired through advanced training and practice; a rifle-musket in the hands of a raw recruit would not have performed very much better than a smoothbore. Nevertheless, the musket was still a formidable force on the battlefield. At the beginning of the American Civil War, some infantry regiments chose to keep smooth-bore muskets, preferring them because they could shoot \\"ball and buck\\".Davide Pedersoli. .69 ball, buck and ball and buckshot cartridges of the U.S. Army In the 1850s and 1860s, new weapons produced with rifled barrels continued to be referred to as \\"rifled muskets\\" or \\"rifle-muskets\\" even though they had not originally been produced as smoothbore weapons. The term was only used for weapons that directly replaced smoothbore muskets. For example, the Springfield Model 1861 with its typical musket style lock mechanism and long barrel length was called a \\"rifled musket\\". In contrast, the Henry Rifle produced in the same time period did not replace a musket and did not have other musket-like characteristics, and was just referred to as a \\"rifle\\". In the late 1860s, rifled muskets were replaced by breech-loading rifles. Weapons like the Springfield Model 1868 were produced by simply changing out the lock mechanism of a rifled musket. However, once this change was made, the weapon was no longer referred to as a rifled-musket and was instead referred to as simply a \\"rifle\\". Characteristics of rifled muskets In general, rifle muskets were the same length as the smoothbore muskets they replaced. This meant that they typically had a barrel length of about and an overall length of about . Period U.S. Armory nomenclature described rifles and rifle-muskets as newly made firearms specifically designed and manufactured with rifling. Rifled muskets were smoothbore firearms returned to the armory or contractors for rifling. Considerable numbers of armory-stored smoothbores were converted in this way in the 1850s upon adoption of the Mini√© ball as the standard projectile. Rifle muskets tended to be of smaller caliber than their smoothbore predecessors, for example, the .58 caliber U.S. Springfield Model 1855 or the .577 caliber British Pattern 1853 Enfield. Tests conducted by the U.S. Army in the mid-1850s showed that the smaller caliber was more accurate at longer ranges. The cylindro-conical shape of the Mini√© ball also meant that the smaller-diameter but longer .58 caliber Mini√© ball had roughly the same amount of lead and weight as the larger .69 round ball. While the caliber was reduced, the overall length of the barrel was not. Shorter rifles could have easily been made (and were made for specific branches or arms such as mounted infantry and riflemen) that would have been more accurate than the smoothbore muskets they replaced, but military commanders still used tactics like firing by ranks, and feared that with a shorter weapon the soldiers in the rear ranks might accidentally shoot the front rank soldiers in the back of the head. Military commanders at the time also believed that bayonet fighting would continue to be important in battles, which also influenced the decision to retain existing barrel lengths. In the US and British service standardized infantry firearms were produced in a longer \\"rifle musket\\" version and a shorter \\"rifle\\" version, such as the Springfield Model 1855. The rifle musket version had a 40-inch barrel and an overall length of . The rifle version had a barrel and an overall length of . In the British forces the distinction was retained between the full-length musket issued to the infantry as a whole, and the shorter and handier version of the Enfield produced for specialist rifle regiments and marines. The long version had the barrel held to the stock by three metal bands, while the shorter version needed just two, so they are referred to as ‚Äú3-band‚Äù and ‚Äú2-band‚Äù Enfields respectively. Rifle muskets typically used percussion lock systems, with some exceptions like the Springfield Model 1855, which also was equipped with the Maynard tape primer system. Since rifle muskets were meant as a direct replacement for smoothbore muskets, they were fitted with bayonets. Their designers envisioned that they would be used in battle much like the bayonets on older smoothbore muskets. However, in practice, the longer range of the rifle musket and changes in tactics rendered the bayonet almost obsolete. During the U.S. Civil War, bayonets accounted for less than one percent of battlefield casualties. In military use, rifle musket loading was simplified somewhat through the use of paper cartridges, which were significantly different from modern metallic cartridges. They typically consisted of rolled-up tubes of paper containing a premeasured amount of black powder and a greased Mini√© ball. Unlike the smoothbore cartridge, the entire cartridge was not simply shoved into the weapon. Instead, the paper was torn open (typically by the shooter's teeth), the powder was poured down the barrel, the Mini√© ball was placed into the barrel and rammed down on top of the powder with the ramrod. The paper was discarded. Also differing from a modern cartridge, a separate percussion cap had to be placed onto the percussion lock's cone before the weapon could be fired. The Maynard tape primer system attempted to speed up this last step by using paper strips similar to those used in modern toy cap guns in place of the percussion cap, but this proved to be unreliable in field service and was abandoned on later weapons. An exception to this method is the Enfield rifle- musket cartridge. There were no lubrication rings moulded or swaged into the Enfield projectile. The projectile was inserted upside down in the cartridge and the outside of the cartridge paper was greased at the projectile end and intended to be inserted and used as a paper patch. A ramrod was used to fully seat the round. Use in battle Rifled muskets were heavily used in the American Civil War. The American-made Springfield Model 1861 was the most widely used weapon in the war, followed by the British Pattern 1853 Enfield. The Lorenz rifle was the third most used rifle during the Civil WarThomas Dean, and Earl J. Coates (1996). An Introduction to Civil War Small Arms The Enfield was also used in the Crimean War where its greater range was a significant advantage over the much shorter-ranged Russian smoothbore muskets. However, soldiers armed with rifled muskets were not always successful on the battlefield. In the Italian War of 1859, Austrian troops armed with rifled muskets were defeated by French forces using aggressive skirmishing tactics and rapid bayonet assaults at close range.

Early life and career Jarman was born in Sallisaw, Oklahoma, on July 17, 1915 and graduated from Yale University in 1937 and from Harvard Law School in 1941. He was admitted to the bar in 1941 and began his law practice in Oklahoma City. Jarman enlisted in the US Army in January 1942, about a month after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. He served in the Security Intelligence Corps during World War II and was discharged from military service in December 1945. He was married Ruth Virginia Bewley and had three children: John Henry Jarman III, Susan Jarman, and Steve Jarman. Jarman was later elected to the Oklahoma House of Representatives and later to the Oklahoma State Senate. Hw was elected to the US House of Representatives in 1950 as a Democrat. Jarman did not sign the 1956 Southern Manifesto and voted for the Civil Rights Act of 1960, the 24th Amendment to the US Constitution, and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 but not the Civil Rights Acts of 1957, 1964, and 1968. Party switch Jarman was reelected 11 times without serious difficulty, even as the Oklahoma City area trended increasingly Republican at the local level. Although the district had supported a Democrat for president only once since Harry Truman, most local offices were still held by Democrats. By the 1970s, however, Republicans began making gains at the local level. For example, in 1974, Jarman was nearly defeated by a Republican newcomer, Mickey Edwards, despite Republicans being severely punished that year for the Watergate scandal. On January 24, 1975, Jarman switched parties and became a Republican in protest of the removals of F. Edward H√©bert, Wright Patman, and William R. Poage from their committee chairmanships. Jarman claimed that the House Democratic Caucus had changed over the years and had elements that \\"force their liberal views on this Congress and on this country by nullifying the seniority system and punishing those who do not adhere to the liberal party line as laid down by the caucus.\\" He did not run for re-election in 1976. Edwards won the seat, and the district remained in Republican hands until Kendra Horn unseated Steve Russell in the 2018 midterm elections approximately 42 years later. Retirement and death Jarman declined to seek re-election to the House in 1976. After leaving Congress, he decided to resume his practice of law in Oklahoma City, until he died there on January 15, 1982. Jarman was laid to rest at Rose Hill Burial Park. Personal life Jarman spent much of his later life in Mexico and with his children and their families in Hawaii, Pennsylvania, and Colorado. He loved animals, especially small dogs; horseback riding, and the rough wilderness of Wyoming, Oklahoma, and Colorado.

A variant of other sex party urban myths, the stories claim that at these events, allegedly increasingly popular among adolescents, females wearing various shades of lipstick take turns fellating males in sequence, leaving multiple colors (resembling a \\"rainbow\\") on their penises. The idea was publicized on The Oprah Winfrey Show in 2003, and became the subject of a juvenile novel called Rainbow Party. Sex researchers and adolescent health care professionals have found no evidence for the existence of rainbow parties, and consequently attribute the spread of the stories to a moral panic. On May 27, 2010, the television program The Doctors discussed the topic with dozens of teens, parents, and professionals. The podcast You're Wrong About... explores the cultural phenomenon of rainbow parties in its episode \\"Poisoned Halloween Candy and Other Urban Legends\\". Origin The story was originally related by American pediatrician Meg Meeker in her 2002 book Epidemic: How Teen Sex Is Killing Our Kids. The book related case stories of adolescents suffering cancer, sterility, acute infections, and unwanted pregnancies as a consequence of starting sexual activity too early in life. Meeker relates the following story from a 14-year-old patient from Michigan: > [Allyson] had heard some kids were going to have a \\"rainbow party,\\" but had > no idea what that meant. Still, she thought it might be fun, and arranged to > attend with a friend. After she arrived, several girls (all in the eighth > grade) were given different shades of lipstick and told to perform oral sex > on different boys to give them \\"rainbows.\\" Once she realized what was > happening, Allyson was too stunned and frightened to do anything. When a > girl gave her some lipstick, she refused at first but, with repeated > pressure, finally gave in. \\"It was one of the grossest things I've ever > done.\\"Meeker, p22-23. On The Oprah Winfrey Show The idea of the rainbow party was publicized in October 2003 on the episode of The Oprah Winfrey Show titled \\"Is Your Child Leading a Double Life?\\", which was about the trend of increasing sexual promiscuity among American youth and the lack of parental awareness of the sexual practices of their children. In O Magazine, Michelle Burford asserted, among other things, that many teens across the United States engaged in rainbow parties. Book Rainbow Party is a novel commissioned by a Simon & Schuster editor. The author is Paul Ruditis. The book, which Library Journal declined to review, is about teens who fantasize about having a rainbow party. The book has proven controversial, as it was meant for teenagers (recommended by the publisher for ages 14 and up), thus raising questions about its propriety. In turn, concerns were raised that excluding the book from bookstores and libraries would amount to censorship. The publishers justified Rainbow Party on the grounds that it was a cautionary tale intended to teach readers that oral sex can be dangerous. Evidence of falsity Deborah Tolman, director of the Center for Research on Gender and Sexuality at San Francisco State University, writes: \\"This 'phenomenon' has all the classic hallmarks of a moral panic. One day we have never heard of rainbow parties and then suddenly they are everywhere, feeding on adults' fears that morally- bankrupt sexuality among teens is rampant, despite any actual evidence, as well as evidence to the contrary.\\" Tolman finds that several features of the story ring false. She was skeptical that many adolescent girls would be motivated to engage in such activity in the face of the severe social stigma still attached to sexual activity, and rejected the idea that adolescent boys would examine each other's lipstick marks. However, the urban legend was widespread; an informal survey taken by The New York Times in 2005 found that most teenagers between the ages of 13 and 16 were familiar with the rumor. Reason writer Nick Gillespie has claimed \\"Rainbow parties are as real as unicorns.\\"https://reason.com/2012/05/27/5-great-teen-sex-drugs-freakouts- rainbow/ Canadian parenting coach Lisa Bunnage claimed in a 2014 TEDxSFU talk that such parties were indeed taking place.

Anderson to conclude Frank Herbert's original Dune series of science fiction novels. The cliffhanger ending of Frank Herbert's Chapterhouse: Dune (1985) and his subsequent death in 1986 left some overarching plotlines unresolved. Released on August 22, 2006, Hunters continues the story of the danger posed to humanity by a remote, unnamed, but ever-present \\"great enemy\\". The novel is based on notes left behind by Frank Herbert, but Hunters and its 2007 sequel Sandworms of Dune represent the author's version of what Frank Herbert referred to as Dune 7, his own planned seventh novel in the Dune series. The first five chapters of the novel were available prior to the novel's publication via free download from the official Dune website, released monthly from March until July in 2006. Plot For three years, the no-ship Ithaca has been in an alternate universe, hiding from the \\"great enemy\\". It carries the clones, or gholas, of Duncan Idaho, famous military commander Miles Teg, the Bene Gesserit Sheeana, the last Bene Tleilax Master Scytale, and seven small melange-producing sandworms, as well as a number of other humans. Scytale has shared the secret of producing melange, also called spice, in tanks, because the sandworms do not produce enough to allow the ship to continue travelling. The mysterious Oracle of Time speaks to Duncan and brings the no-ship back into the 'regular' universe. The ship is discovered by the mysterious Daniel and Marty, first mentioned at the end of Chapterhouse: Dune. They attempt to capture the ship, but it escapes. On Chapterhouse, the only remaining source of spice, Murbella, now the leader of the Honored Matres and Bene Gesserits, is attempting to merge the groups into the New Sisterhood and prevent civil war. Desperate for more spice so that their Navigators can travel through space, the Spacing Guild approaches her, but Murbella refuses, threatening to cut them off completely. Unbeknownst to everyone but the Bene Gesserit, the sandworms on Chapterhouse are not producing much melange; the Bene Gesserit are making up the shortfall with their own stockpiles. Though the Honored Matres had destroyed all Bene Tleilax worlds, their descendants (the Lost Tleilaxu) have returned from The Scattering. They use the shape- stealing Face Dancers for espionage, until the Face Dancers kill the Tleilaxu Elder Burah and replace him with a duplicate. It is revealed that they have replaced all the Lost Tleilaxu Elders, as well as countless humans on various planets in the Old Empire. Their leader Khrone sends the scribe Uxtal to serve the rebel Honored Matre leader Hellica, who has proclaimed herself Matre Superior and now rules the conquered Bene Tleilax homeworld, Tleilax. The desperate Spacing Guild goes to Ix seeking an alternative means of space travel. Khrone and his Face Dancers have secretly infiltrated Ix, plotting to dominate the universe. Working with Daniel and Marty, Khrone offers their advanced navigation technology to the Guild as if it were of Ixian design. The Guild agrees to the development of this technology if they have a monopoly on it. Uxtal has been forced to use Tleilaxu axlotl tank technology to produce the adrenaline-enhancing drug used by Honored Matres. Khrone tasks Uxtal to make a ghola of Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, which is as sociopathic as the original. Khrone obtains the blood of Paul Atreides and has Uxtal make a ghola of Paul; he intends to use the ghola of the Baron to twist Paul's ghola into a weapon for Daniel and Marty's conquest of the universe. Later, Guild Navigator Edrik comes to Tleilax seeking Uxtal's knowledge of axlotl tanks; the Navigator fears his kind's obsolescence when the Ixian navigation technology becomes available. He seeks a tank-based source of spice to break the Bene Gesserit monopoly, but everyone believes that technology died with the Tleilaxu Masters. Eventually he accesses the genetic material of deceased Master Waff, and creates several Waff gholas, hoping to recover the lost technology. The Tleilaxu sustain their lives indefinitely using gholas; Scytale's current body is dying, and he does not have a replacement. He has only one secret to use as a bargaining tool: a hidden nullentropy capsule containing cells of numerous important historical and legendary figures secretly collected by the Tleilaxu for millennia, as far back as the Butlerian Jihad. The Bene Gesserit have a vicious debate over whether to create gholas of any of these historical figures. A few at a time, the historical gholas are created, and Scytale is given a new body. On Chapterhouse, Murbella creates the Valkyries, an elite New Sisterhood strike force. They successfully attack rebel Honored Matre strongholds on other planets, discovering that some of the Honored Matres are disguised Face Dancers. Murbella accesses the Other Memory from her Honored Matre ancestors and learns their true origins: they were vengeful Tleilaxu females, freed and assimilated by Fish Speakers and Bene Gesserits fleeing in The Scattering. Tleilaxu females had been enslaved for use as axlotl tanks by Tleilaxu males for millennia. These origins have been forgotten; Murbella now understands why the Honored Matres annihilated the Tleilaxu worlds in the Old Empire. Murbella also accesses a memory showing the origins of the mysterious force the Honored Matres call the Enemy. On the no- ship, rebel Bene Gesserits attempt to murder the Leto II ghola, but are foiled when he transforms into a sandworm. The Paul ghola steals and consumes an overdose of spice in an attempt to remember his past, but instead has a vision of being stabbed by an evil version of himself. After being discovered by the Bene Gesserit, he concludes that he has regained prescience. Sheeana has visions that suggest the use of the gholas is dangerous, and halts the program until she knows more. Daniel and Marty tell Khrone to discard the Baron Harkonnen and Paul Atreides gholas, as they have lured the Ithaca into a trap, and will soon capture the ghola of Paul Atreides on board. Working to his own ends, Khrone continues to prepare the gholas, restoring the Baron's memories and instructing him to train the Paul ghola, which he renames Paolo. Paolo does not yet have his memories. Murbella contracts Ix's competitor Richese to provide armaments for a confrontation with the great enemy, but the rebel Honored Matres destroy the planet to cripple the Sisterhood. Murbella and her Valkyries successfully assault Tleilax, the most powerful of the rebel Honored Matre strongholds, and discover that many, including Matre Superior Hellica, were Face Dancers. Uxtal dies trying to escape, but the remaining Waff ghola finds refuge with the Spacing Guild, offering Edrik the genetic knowledge for the Guild to create their own sandworms. The Ithaca stumbles upon the homeworld of the Handlers. An exploratory party from the no-ship discovers that the Handlers are actually Face Dancers, and barely escape back to the ship. Some Face Dancer ships crash into the Ithaca, and the chaos makes it impossible to know if any passengers have been replaced by Face Dancers. The emergency forces Miles Teg to reveal his hidden power of superhuman speed. Murbella, now in complete control of the Honored Matres and Bene Gesserit, prepares a defense against the forces of the great enemy, now identified by Other Memory to be thinking machines of Omnius, the machine overlord destroyed in the ancient Butlerian Jihad. The Oracle of Time is revealed to be the living consciousness of Norma Cenva, somehow also still in existence millennia after the Jihad. Daniel and Marty are revealed to be Omnius and the independent robot, Erasmus. Before its destruction, the Omnius incarnation on Giedi Prime had launched 5,000 probes capable of constructing new machine colonies on any planets encountered. One of these probes eventually intercepted a signal transmitted by the last remaining Omnius on Corrin before it too was destroyed. Its forces and Synchronized Empire finally reassembled, the new version of the Evermind is on the way back to the Old Empire to destroy all humanity.

Fred W. Stockham, USMC (1881-1918). Stockham (DD-683) was laid down on 19 December 1942 by the Bethlehem Steel Co. at San Francisco, California; launched on 25 June 1943; sponsored by Mrs. Melba Mattingly; and commissioned on 11 February 1944, Commander E. P. Holmes in command.  1944  The newly commissioned Stockham conducted shakedown training off the west coast until 20 April, and then got underway for Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. There, she continued training until departing for the Marshalls on 31 May in preparation for the invasion of the Mariana Islands. She arrived off Saipan on 14 June and conducted preinvasion bombardments on that island until the 17th. On the 18th, she steamed to the west of the Marianas with Task Group 58.7 (TG 58.7) to engage the approaching enemy fleet. In the ensuing battle, known as the Battle of the Philippine Sea and less formally as \\"The Great Marianas Turkey Shoot\\", the 5th Fleet swept the skies clear of Japanese naval air power, though the two fleets never closed to engage in surface action. Instead, the two adversaries launched their planes at one another and American antiaircraft fire and combat air patrol proved superior to the attacking Japanese planes. During the battle, Stockham contributed to the victory by splashing at least three Japanese planes and probably two others. She rejoined the amphibious forces on 25 June and, until mid-August, supported the occupation of Saipan and Tinian and conducted patrols off Guam. Her primary responsibilities were to protect the invasion fleet from air attack and to render fire support when called. She helped repel several air attacks, splashing another enemy plane in the process, and duelled with Japanese artillery batteries ashore. On 21 August, she entered the lagoon at Eniwetok Atoll for a week before rejoining the Fast Carrier Task Force for a 33-day sweep of the Philippines, during which the carrier planes hit targets on Luzon and Mindanao in addition to striking the Visayan and Palau island sub-groups. She entered Ulithi on 1 October for provisions and upkeep. During her six-day stay, a typhoon struck the atoll and broke Stockham and two others loose from the nest. She cast off lines and anchored, but was later forced to get underway to evade the storm. She returned with the task group on 4 October to complete upkeep and provisioning in preparation for another cruise with the aircraft carriers. On 6 October, the destroyer sortied from Ulithi with TG 38.2 for a month-long sweep primarily of the Philippines, but beginning with strikes on Okinawa, on the 10th, and on Formosa, from the 12th to the 14th. She supported the landing at Leyte Gulf on 20 October and screened the carriers during their strikes on southern Luzon and the Visayans on the 21st and 22d. On 25 and 26 October, she joined most of the elements of the 3rd Fleet in meeting and defeating the Japanese Northern Force during the Cape Enga√±o phase of the Battle for Leyte Gulf. On the 29th, Task Force 38 (TF 38) resumed air strikes on the Philippines. Those raids continued until Christmas broken only by two provisioning and upkeep periods at Ulithi, from 9 to 13 November and from 25 November until 9 December. Stockham's crew spent Christmas Day and the eight days following it at Ulithi preparing for another cruise with the fast carriers.  1945  On 3 January 1945, she departed with TG 30.8, the replenishment group for TF 38, and screened it until 7 January, when she rejoined the carriers. Over the next 19 days, she screened the carriers as their planes made sweeps of the inner defenses of the Japanese Empire. They hit French Indochina and Japanese shipping on the 12th, bombed Formosa a second and third time on the 15th and 21st, and struck Hainan, Hong Kong, and the China coast on the 16th. On the way back to Ulithi, they raided Okinawa again, on 22 January. Following two weeks of upkeep, provisioning, and training at Ulithi, Stockham put to sea with TF 38 to bomb Tokyo on 16 and 17 February and to support the Iwo Jima assault on 19 February. During the short stay in the Volcano Islands, the destroyer's guns brought down another enemy plane. On 22 February, she headed north to Japan and screened the carriers during another air strike on the Japanese home islands. On the 26th, she sank an enemy patrol craft off Tori Shima, fighting heavy seas as well as the Japanese. On 6 March, she put into Ulithi once again for provisions and upkeep. On 14 March, she put to sea once more and operated with TF 59 until the following day, when she joined the screen of the Fast Carrier Task Force for sweeps of Ky≈´sh≈´, Okinawa, and Kerama Retto. After the 1 April landings at Okinawa, Stockham remained off that coast until 29 April, protecting the invasion fleet from the onslaught of the kamikazes. On 6 April, she splashed two \\"Zekes\\". She bombarded Minami and Kita Daito islands on the 21st. She put into Ulithi on the 30th. On 7 May, she put to sea with TF 58 and, conducting drills along the way, headed for another series of air raids on Ky≈´sh≈´ and Okinawa. She screened the fleet from air attack during the strikes, helping to repel several enemy raids. She parted company with the main body of the fleet on 6 June to escort a group of crippled ships, including the bowless Pittsburgh (CA-72), to Apra Harbor, Guam. She remained at Guam from 11 to 30 June; then escorted a group of ships to Eniwetok, before rejoining TF 38 on 8 July. Between 8 July and 15 August, she screened the fleet carriers while their planes struck their last series of blows at Japan. Starting with Tokyo on the 10th, they moved swiftly up along Honsh≈´ to Hokkaid≈ç, pounding targets on both islands on the 14th and 15th, then returned to Tokyo on the 18th. On 24 July, she bombarded Cape Shiono at the southern extremity of Honsh≈´, and then returned to screening the fleet from suicide attack while it sent planes to pummel Honsh≈´ and Shikoku. On 15 August 1945, the Japanese Empire capitulated and, four days later, Stockham joined the Yokosuka occupation force, which entered Sagami Wan on 27 August. She supported the landings at Tokyo Bay and at Tateyama on the 30th and 31st respectively, then anchored off Yokosuka on 2 September for six days of upkeep, provisioning, and recreation. She was underway from 9 to 18 September, supporting the minesweeping operations in Sendai Bay and in the vicinity of Goshi. She returned to Tokyo Bay for a month on 19 September, conducted training exercises between 24 and 28 October, and then provisioned for the voyage home. On 31 October, Stockham stood out of Yokosuka to return to the United States. After more than a year on the west coast, she was decommissioned on 30 August 1946Navsource Naval History USS STOCKHAM (DD-683) and berthed at San Diego, California  1950 - 1977  Stockham in the 1950s. The hostilities in Korea in 1950 necessitated an increase in the size of the active fleet. Stockham was recommissioned on 14 November 1951, Comdr. A. P. Zavadil in command. She was assigned to the Atlantic Fleet until 1953, engaged in fleet training missions out of Newport, R.I. In December 1953, the destroyer joined the United Nations Fleet and operated in the Far East, stopping at the southern tip of Japan, then traveling to the Pusan harbor briefly and later Inchon, until the summer of 1954. In July, she returned to Newport after completing a circumnavigation of the world. In November 1954, Stockham entered Boston Naval Shipyard and, at the completion of her overhaul in February 1955, she shook down in the Caribbean. She then resumed normal operations with the Atlantic Fleet until 1 February 1956, when she was posted to the 6th Fleet. She cruised the Mediterranean for four months; visited Egypt, Israel, Lebanon, and Greece; then, resumed operations out of Newport. Stockham returned to the 6th Fleet in the fall of 1956; visited France, Italy, and Greece; and participated in an antisubmarine exercise with American and Italian ships. On 23 February 1957, the destroyer returned to Newport. Seven months later, she was decommissioned on 2 September 1957 and placed in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Stockham was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register 1 December 1974, and sunk as a target off Puerto Rico 17 February 1977. Stockham (DD-683) earned eight battle stars during World War II.

On his return to Europe on the conclusion of his three-year contract, he worked as a lawyer in Thun and Bern and acquired Swiss citizenship in 1905. The same year, he passed his habilitation in international law at the University of Bern. After a brief stay in Frankfurt he returned to Switzerland after the outbreak of the First World War. Following the war, he became President of the High Court of the Territory of the Saar Basin in Saarlouis in 1921.Schenk, p. 338. In 1927, he had become a professor of the University of Bern, and returned to Switzerland to assume his seat in 1934. He died in 1938 in Switzerland  Legal theorist  Nippold was one of the first to propose a league of nations. His book, Development of International Law After the World War, was drafted during the First World War. In this text, Nippold argued that the conflict created a need for a radical reinterpretation of the law of war. He reasoned that modern war cannot be given the character of a legal institution because it is really a negation of law; and therefore, war itself is an illustration of \\"self-help\\" on the part of the aggressor.Development of International Law After the World War, Hein Cite. Vo. 43, No. 204 (2004), p. 2. Nippold was a leader in the slow transformation of treaties from bilateral alliances or trade agreements to more \\"normative\\" instruments; and in the 20th century, there came to be a perceived distinction between regular treaties and \\"law-making\\" or \\"quasi-legislative\\" conventions. In 1894, Nippold summarized a point of view which would continue to evolve: \\"International treaties in their totality will be the Law-book of international law.\\"Koskenniemi, Martti. \\"International Legislation Today: Limits and Possibilities,\\" Wisconsin International Law Review (2008).

Anderson, the second of two books they wrote to conclude Frank Herbert's original Dune series. It is based on notes left behind by Frank Herbert for Dune 7, his own planned seventh novel in the Dune series. The novel was released on August 7, 2007. Plot=The end nears As Sandworms of Dune begins, the passengers of the no-ship Ithaca continue their nearly two-decade search for a new home world for the Bene Gesserit, while Duncan Idaho evades the tachyon net of the old couple Daniel and Marty, now known to be thinking machine leaders Omnius and Erasmus. Among the inhabitants of the Ithaca are young gholas of Paul Atreides, Lady Jessica, and others. Back in the Old Empire, Mother Commander Murbella of the New Sisterhood attempts to rally humankind for a last stand against the thinking machines. The new Face Dancers continue to infiltrate the main organizations of the Old Empire at all levels, having also sent their gholas of Paul Atreides (called Paolo) and the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen to the thinking machine capital, Synchrony. At the prompting of Face Dancer infiltrators, the Spacing Guild has begun replacing its Navigators with Ixian navigation devices and cutting off the Navigators' supply of melange. Navigator Edrik and his faction have commissioned Waff, the imperfectly awakened ghola rescued by the Guild from the Bene Gesserit attack on Bandalong, to create \\"advanced\\" sandworms able to produce the melange they so desperately require. He accomplishes this by altering the DNA of the sandtrout stage and creating an aquatic form of the worms, which are then released into the oceans of Buzzell. Adapting to their new environment, these \\"seaworms\\" quickly flourish, eventually producing a highly concentrated form of spice, dubbed \\"ultraspice\\". Meanwhile, Murbella commissions Ix to copy the destructive Honored Matre Obliterators for use on the fleet of warships she has ordered from the Guild. However, Ix is now secretly controlled by Face Dancer leader Khrone; previously acting as a minion of Omnius, he continues his own plot for Face Dancer domination of the universe. Omnius's forces have begun striking world after world, releasing a deadly virus and then pressing on to the new string of inhabited planets. The thinking machine plague arrives at Chapterhouse and cripples the Sisterhood, but they rally the unified humankind into one last great stand. Aboard the Ithaca, Sheeana restarts the ghola project. Gholas of Serena Butler, Gurney Halleck, and Xavier Harkonnen are about to be born when the axlotl tanks are poisoned, killing all three ghola babies and the tanks. Saboteurs are suspected, as many of the ship's systems have also been failing. Scytale, the last Tleilaxu Master, finally reawakens his own ghola's past memories, but only by dying in front of his younger self. The gholas of Wellington Yueh, Stilgar, and Liet-Kynes regain their memories through various traumatic experiences. Desperate to replenish their supplies, the Ithaca lands on the planet Qelso, a world slowly being terraformed into a desert planet by the introduction of sandworms years before by the Bene Gesserit. Stilgar and Liet- Kynes decide to remain behind to help the natives slow the encroaching desert and prepare them for the inevitable. The climax Having successfully completed his attempts to create a new incarnation of sandworm, Waff begs Edrik to return him to the ruined planet of Rakis so that he can spend what little time to live he has left attempting to reintroduce the worms there as well. Unsuccessful, Waff resigns himself to failure and prepares to die; as the last of his sandworm specimens perishes, a dozen sandworms erupt from beneath the surface. Waff realizes that the pearl of Leto II's awareness that each sandworm carries had foreseen the Honored Matre attack on Rakis and buried themselves deep beneath the planet's surface. Knowing the planet has begun healing itself, Waff is consumed by a worm, rejoicing that his prophet has finally returned. Meanwhile, Edrik and the ultraspice are intercepted by Khrone, who seizes the spice and kills the Navigator. The saboteurs are eventually revealed to be the Rabbi and the ghola of Thufir Hawat, who had apparently been murdered and replaced with Face Dancers back on the planet of the Handlers during the events of Hunters of Dune. In the ensuing chaos that follows the discovery of the Face Dancers, the Ithaca is ensnared by the tachyon net. Miles Teg sacrifices his life in an unsuccessful attempt to prevent their capture. The Ithaca is brought to Synchrony. They are met by a party led by the ghola of Vladimir Harkonnen. Seeing the young ghola of Alia when he arrives, he immediately kills her; the original Alia had murdered his original self 5,000 years before. The Bene Gesserit gholas of Paul, Lady Jessica, Chani, and Yueh are then taken to see Omnius and Erasmus. Omnius explains that to complete his domination of humanity, he requires the superior Kwisatz Haderach of the two Paul gholas. Paolo and Paul are forced to duel, during which Paul is mortally wounded. Victorious, Paolo takes the ultraspice; overwhelmed by the rapid onset of perfect prescient vision, he slips into a coma. Paul, at the urging and efforts of Yueh, Chani, and Jessica, slowly regains his past memories and is able to repair the damage to his body using Bene Gesserit physiological control. Under the guise of aiding Paolo, Yueh takes his revenge by killing Baron Harkonnen, who had orchestrated the torture and death of Yueh's wife Wanna in their original incarnations. As this is happening, Murbella has all the new ships in place and is finally ready to launch her fleet against Omnius's oncoming armada. But the Obliterators and Ixian navigation devices all suddenly fail. Murbella realizes that they have been sabotaged. When it appears that defeat at the hands of the thinking machine forces is imminent, the Oracle of Time appears with a thousand ships piloted by Guild Navigators and begins to attack the machines. This assault leaves the machine fleet in pieces. The Oracle then tells Murbella that she is going to Synchrony to stop Omnius once and for all; she folds space, and a visual manifestation of the Oracle appears in the room where Paul and Paolo have been dueling. The Oracle then removes every aspect of Omnius and transports the Evermind away into another dimension forever. The ultimate Kwisatz Haderach Sheeana and the young Leto II ghola free the sandworms from the Ithaca's cargo hold, and the worms wreak havoc throughout Synchrony. Leto II regains his memories, and after the battle is finished, he tells Sheeana that he must now go back into the dreaming. Leto walks into the belly of the largest worm, Monarch, and the seven worms twist together and join into one giant superworm before digging deep into the ground. Fresh from fighting the thinking machines outside on Synchrony with Sheeana, Duncan enters the chamber where a recovering Paul, his memories now restored, reveals that Duncan is the final Kwisatz Haderach, having evolved and perfected himself through thousands of years of ghola rebirth and altered DNA. Erasmus, the independent-minded robot, explains that he was the mastermind behind the rebuilding of the Synchronized Worlds. A mutinous Khrone declares that the universe now belongs to his Face Dancers, as both humans and machines have been crippled. Amused by Khrone's attempt to seize power, Erasmus explains that a fail-safe system had been built into the Face Dancers. Erasmus kills Khrone and his party‚Äîand then all enhanced Face Dancers across the universe‚Äîwith the simple flip of a mental switch. The immediate death of so many Face Dancers exposes how much they have infiltrated human society. Erasmus then offers Duncan a choice. With both humans and thinking machines battered and beaten, Duncan can choose either destruction for one side or recovery and healing for both. Choosing peace over victory, Duncan and Erasmus then merge minds. Erasmus imparts Duncan with all the codes required to run the Synchronized Worlds, as well as all of his knowledge. Duncan now stands as the bridge between humans and machines. With little left for him, Erasmus again expresses his desire to learn everything possible about what it is to be human‚Äîhe asks for Duncan to help him die. As Duncan shuts Erasmus down, he shares one of the many deaths he experienced with the robot. Back in the Old Empire, Murbella's forces are preparing to attack Omnius's second wave when the machines suddenly stop. With the Oracle having taken Omnius, a Navigator brings Murbella to Synchrony. She and Duncan are reunited, and he explains his intent to end the divide between humans and thinking machines‚Äîthe two will co- exist. Duncan gives Synchrony to Sheeana for her Orthodox Sisterhood, while he returns with Murbella to help lead the new human-machine mode of life. Epilogue On Qelso, the gholas of Stilgar and Liet-Kynes continue to aid in the attempt to hold back the expanding desert, while simultaneously teaching the planet's occupants how to adapt to the changes that will inevitably come. Under Duncan's control, a thinking machine convoy lands on the planet; Duncan offers the gholas the aid of the thinking machines in holding back the desert. He tells Stilgar and Kynes that just as he has become both man and machine, Qelso will become both desert and forest. On Caladan, the gholas of Lady Jessica and Wellington Yueh have returned to the ancient Atreides castle. Having removed all traces of the Baron's occupancy, the two discuss how they will go forward with their lives. Accompanying them is the unawakened ten-year-old ghola of Leto I. Looking forward to the time when his memories will be restored, Lady Jessica finds solace in the fact that she will be reunited with her Duke. With the aid of the Tleilaxu Master Scytale, Sheeana and the Orthodox Sisterhood on Synchrony have reestablished the ancient Bene Gesserit breeding program, resolving to never again breed another Kwisatz Haderach. At her side, Sheeana has a young ghola of Serena Butler, heroine of the Butlerian Jihad. Along with gholas of the Tleilaxu Masters, Scytale has grown Tleilaxu females from newly discovered cells, vowing that they will never again be forced into becoming axlotl tanks, in the hopes that this will prevent the creation of a vengeful enemy such as the Honored Matres from ever occurring again, and also vowing to never again allow the Masters to corrupt the recovering Tleilaxu people. On the recovering planet Dune, the awakened gholas of Paul and Chani go about restoring the planet to its former glory. Now that Paul is able to devote all of his attention to her, Chani remarks that he has finally learned how to treat his wife. As the novel closes, Paul reaffirms his love for Chani, telling her he has loved her for over 5,000 years. Critical reception The novel was commercially successful, and praised by Jackie Cassada of the Library Journal: > \\"Complex in structure though never hard to follow, this sequel to Hunters of > Dune ties together the threads left by Chapterhouse: Dune, bringing closure > to a saga of planetary birth and death and human courage and hubris.

John Whitehurst FRS (10 April 1713 ‚Äì 18 February 1788), born in Cheshire, England, was a clockmaker and scientist, and made significant early contributions to geology. He was an influential member of the Lunar Society.  Life and work  Whitehurst was born in Congleton, Cheshire, to a clockmaker, the elder John Whitehurst.Much of this article's content was adapted from the following source: Receiving only a slight formal education, the younger Whitehurst was taught clockmaking by his father, who also encouraged the boy's pursuit of knowledge. In 1734, at the age of twenty-one, Whitehurst visited Dublin to inspect a clock of curious construction of which he had heard. Career About 1736, Whitehurst entered into business for himself at Derby, where he soon obtained great employment, distinguishing himself by constructing several ingenious pieces of mechanism. Besides other works, he made the clock for the town hall, and on 6 September 1737, he was enrolled as a burgess in reward. He also made thermometers, barometers, and other philosophical instruments, and interested himself in contriving waterworks. He was consulted in almost every undertaking in Derbyshire and in the neighbouring counties in which skill in mechanics, pneumatics, and hydraulics was required. A precision compass made by Whitehurst for Peter Perez Burdett which he used to create a map of Derbyshire.Labels in Derby Museum and Art Gallery, read August 2011 In 1774, Whitehurst obtained a post at the Royal Mint in London. In 1775, on the passage of the act for the better regulation of the gold coinage, without any solicitation on his part, he was appointed stamper of the money-weights on the recommendation of the Duke of Newcastle. Whitehurst moved to London, where he passed the rest of his life in scientific pursuits. other distinguished scientists visited his house in Colt Court, Fleet Street, formerly the abode of James Ferguson. In 1772 - aged 59 years- he invented the \\"pulsation engine\\" (not to be mixed up with a Pulser pump), a water-raising device which was the precursor of the hydraulic ram. In 1778, Whitehurst published his theory on geological strata in An Inquiry into the Original State and Formation of the Earth. He had begun this while living at Derby, originally intending to facilitate the discovery of valuable minerals beneath the Earth's surface. He pursued his researches with so much ardour, that \\"the exposure he incurred\\" tended to impair his health. On 13 May 1779, Whitehurst was elected a fellow of the Royal Society. In 1783, he was sent to examine the Giant's Causeway and the volcanic remains in the north of Ireland, embodying his observations in the second edition of his Inquiry. About 1784 he contrived a system of ventilation for St. Thomas's Hospital.See Bernan's History and Art of Warming and Ventilation, 1845, ii. 70 In 1787, age 74, a year before his death, he published An Attempt towards obtaining invariable Measures of Length, Capacity, and Weight, from the Mensuration of Time (London). Whitehurst wanted to study the shape of the earth by measuring differences in gravitation. For this, he studied heavy pendulums in different locations. He measured the length of the pendulum, the frequency of its oscillation and the length of the path its head was moving. He compared these to theoretical values he calculated assuming the globe is spherical. Starting on the assumption that the length of a second pendulum in the latitude of London was 39.2 inches, he deduced that the length of one oscillating 42 times a minute is 80 inches, while that of one oscillating twice as many times is 20 inches. The difference between these two lengths would therefore be exactly 5 feet. He found upon experiment that the actual difference was only 59.892 inches owing to the real length of the pendulum, oscillating once a second, being 39.125 inches. He obtained rough data, from which the true lengths of pendulums, the spaces through which heavy bodies fall in a given time, and many other particulars relating to the force of gravitation and the true figure of the earth could be deduced. Personal life On 9 January 1745, Whitehurst married Elizabeth Gretton, daughter of George Gretton, rector of Trusley and Dalbury in Derbyshire. In 1788 Whitehurst died, 75 years old, at his house in Bolt Court, Fleet Street, and was buried beside his wife in St. Andrew's burying-ground in Gray's Inn Road. There were no surviving children. It has been suggested that Whitehurst is the model for Joseph Wright of Derby's picture of A Philosopher Lecturing on the Orrery in the Derby Museum and Art Gallery.  Selected writings  * 2nd ed.

In his honour, the Karlovac city library, the city's oldest cultural institution founded in 1838, was renamed after him.Ivan Goran Kovaƒçiƒá profile, librarybuildings.info; accessed 25 March 2010. During World War II, in the harsh winter of 1942, Kovaƒçiƒá and Vladimir Nazor volunteered for the Partisan forces to set an anti-fascist example for the world. At that time, Goran was already ill with tuberculosis and Nazor was advanced in age, but they were motivated by their consciences. Kovaƒçiƒá was killed by Serbian Chetnik troops in an east-Bosnian village of Vrbica near Foƒça on 13 July 1943. His death is described as follows: ‚ÄúLike in an ancient tragedy, the one who is most opposed to evil will most cruelly die from evil. The poet who raised his voice against the Ustashian killing of Serbian people had his throat cut by Serbian Chetniks‚Ä¶.A few reliable witnesses confirm that Goran survived the hell of the fifth offensive, but when he returned to help his ill, left-behind, friend, Dr Simo Milo≈°eviƒá, the fascists killed both the Croatian poet and the Serbian scholar without distinction. Fascism did not look on poets or scientists anywhere in the world as being of value.‚ÄùMatvejeviƒá, Predrag, Goranov odlazak u partizane, in: ≈Ωivot i djelo Ivana Gorana Kovaƒçiƒáa, ed. Anƒëelko Novakoviƒá (1989), Zagreb: Globus, pg. 134 Works Ivan Goran Kovaƒçiƒá in partisans. Death is a central theme in much of Kovaƒçiƒá's poetry, however this is not a reflection on his life outlook. His melancholy subjects came from outside events‚Äîsuch as his own and his brother‚Äôs affliction with tuberculosis‚Äîrather than from an internal disposition toward the morose. Jure Ka≈°telan, one of Kovaƒçiƒá's contemporaries, expressed that Kovaƒçiƒá was inclined both toward romanticism and realism in his poetry, and that Kovaƒçiƒá had an intense perception of life. His best known work is \\"Jama\\" (\\"The Pit\\").A.

The poem was written out of intellectual and ethical responsibility that condemns atrocities done by the Usta≈°e. It has been described as a metaphor about the sufferer, martyr, and victim: ‚ÄúThe sufferer is when a person without fault suffers. The martyr is when nonhumans torture a person. The victim is when the whips of injustice extinguish life. That is Goran‚Äôs metaphor. And his life.‚Äù His work is an example of anti-war poetry with messages against torture, mass murders and war crimes. \\"Jama\\" was studied in elementary schools throughout the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. \\"Jama\\" The poem starts with a striking metaphor of blood replacing both light and darkness as victim's eyes were plucked out with a knife. That common torture was probably a mere sadism, since the victims were mass-murdered after that anyway: :Blood is my daylight and darkness too. :Blessing of night has been gouged from my cheeks :Bearing with it my more lucky sight. :Within those holes, for tears, fierce fire inflamed :The bleeding socket as if for brain a balm ‚Äì :While my bright eyes died on my own palm In culture * Paul √âluard wrote a poem called The grave of Goran Kovaƒçiƒá. * A Yugoslavian film Ivan Goran Kovaƒçiƒá, was made in 1979, written and directed by Ljubi≈°a Ristiƒá.

LCER characterises the first-past-the-post voting system (FPTP) as \\"unfair and deeply flawed, leading to voter apathy, disaffection with politics, and parliaments which don't represent the people\\". It campaigns for its replacement with an electoral system which is \\"broadly proportional, and in which all votes matter\\". The group works closely with other organisations promoting electoral reform in the UK, including Make Votes Matter, the Electoral Reform Society and Politics for the Many. LCER is distinct from these other organisations in that it focuses its efforts on promoting proportional representation within the Labour Party. This is driven by the belief that a change to the UK's voting system can only come about via Labour: > \\"We believe that the impetus for changing the voting system must come from > the Labour Party. The Conservatives will never support PR, because First > Past the Post gives them such a big electoral advantage. The smaller parties > already support PR, but lack the influence to bring about change. Only > Labour can drive the change.\\" History LCER originated in the 1970s as the Labour Study Group for Electoral Reform. After Labour lost government to the Conservatives in the 1979 general election, the group changed its name to the Labour Campaign for Electoral Reform. Early supporters included academic Ron Medlow; Robin Cook,Cook, R. (2003). Where Do We Go from Here? Chapter 9 in Point of Departure: Diaries from the Front Bench. Simon & Schuster. () Jeff Rooker, and Martin Linton, who went on to be Labour MPs; and activist Mary Southcott, who would later become LCER's parliamentary and political officer. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, during which Labour spent most of its time in opposition, support for LCER increased steadily among both Labour members and elected representatives, with motions on electoral reform being tabled at the party conference almost every year. In 1990, the party conference voted narrowly to commission an inquiry into electoral systems; LCER is widely credited in bringing this about. The inquiry, led by Professor Raymond Plant, recommended the introduction of the supplementary vote. Labour included in its 1997 election manifesto a pledge to hold a referendum on electoral reform; however, this pledge was never honoured, despite the work of the Jenkins Commission, in which Liberal Democrat (and former Labour MP) Lord Jenkins explored possible voting systems on behalf of incumbent Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair's government. In 2010, incoming Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron announced a referendum on electoral reform in return for the support of the Liberal Democrats in a governing coalition. The referendum, which offered instant-runoff voting (branded as \\"Alternative Vote\\", or AV) as an alternative to FPTP, was held in May 2011. AV is not a proportional voting system, and as such many electoral reformers considered it no great improvement on FPTP: Liberal Democrat leader and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg called it a \\"miserable little compromise\\", and some leading proponents of electoral reform considered AV to be such a poor system that they voted for the status quo. LCER did support AV in the 2011 referendum, via the Yes2AV umbrella group, but following the heavy and widely predicted defeat of the \\"Yes\\" campaign, LCER's activities fell into abeyance for several years, with activists exhausted and the organisation having spent almost all its money. Activity increased again in 2015 and has been rising steadily ever since; Make Votes Matter notes that one third of Labour MPs, 77 Constituency Labour Parties, and two trade unions affiliated to the Labour Party have expressed support for proportional representation. Supporters Many Labour MPs past and present have supported LCER and its activities. In the past, this included such high-profile figures as Mo Mowlam, Robin Cook, Paul Flynn, Clare Short, Tessa Jowell, Rhodri Morgan and Janet Anderson. LCER currently has prominent supporters from both the left and the right wings of the Labour party. It is currently chaired by Paul Blomfield, with Ruth Cadbury, Susan Elan Jones, Sandy Martin and Daniel Zeichner serving as vice chairs. In 2017, Cat Smith co-wrote the foreword to a report jointly written by LCER with Make Votes Matter. Other current supporters include MPs David Lammy, Jonathan Reynolds, Tulip Siddiq, Stephen Kinnock, Alan Whitehead, John McDonnell, and, from the House of Lords, Baroness Lister. Position LCER does not advocate the introduction of a specific system of proportional representation, believing that the selection of a new voting system should be the work of a Royal Commission. Rather, it campaigns for the Labour Party: * To reject first-past-the-post voting for elections at all levels of government * To ensure that the Constitutional Convention already promised in Labour's manifesto, includes in its remit a consideration of voting systems * To include in its election manifesto a commitment to establishing a broadly proportional voting system at all levels of government LCER bases its support for proportional representation on the belief that PR systems are more democratic than FPTP, but also on evidence that PR voting systems are associated with societies with higher levels of social and economic equality; with higher levels of public spending and redistribution; and with a lower propensity to engage in violent conflict.

Early life  William de la Barre, son of Carl and Josephine (Friedl) de la Barre, was born in Vienna, Austria. In 1863, he entered the Polytechnic Institute in Vienna (now known as Vienna University of Technology), where he studied for two years before being recruited into the Austrian Navy as a machinist. In the Navy, he received his first mechanical experience and training. De la Barre immigrated to the United States in October 1866, landing in New York, then settling in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania where he found employment as a draftsman and engineer. He served as engineer for the Centennial Exposition held in Philadelphia in 1876. He was married to Louisa Verena Merian, daughter of Louis and Marie (Glaser) Merian of Philadelphia, in 1870 in Philadelphia. They had three children.  Career  In 1878, he and his family moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota. He became a salesman for Behrns' Exhaust, a patented apparatus for the prevention of dust explosions in flour mills, and for several years sold and installed this apparatus in various mills in Minneapolis. Because of his extensive knowledge flour mills, in 1880 he was hired by Cadwallader C. Washburn (better known as C. C. Washburn), founder of the Washburn-Crosby Mills in Minneapolis, to be head engineer and superintendent of his mills.William E. Lass, \\"Minnesota: A History\\", W.W. Norton & Company Inc., 1998 While at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, de la Barre had learned that a new process for milling flour had been invented in Europe that involved passing the grain through a series of rollers, rather than the large round millstones used in America. Washburn sent him to Europe to learn about the process firsthand. What de la Barre discovered was that in Hungary, the mills were using large porcelain rollers shaped more or less like rolling pins and that each series of rollers ground the grain finer and finer. On his return to Minneapolis, de la Barre designed rollers made from steel instead of porcelain. Using de la Barre's steel rollers, the Washburn-Crosby Mills could mill flour that was cleaner, more uniform, and with less energy than ever before. The process was no less than a revolution in milling.

Tarnowski (plural: Tarnowscy) is the surname of a Polish noble and aristocratic family (see: Szlachta). Because Polish adjectives have different forms for the genders, Tarnowska is the form for a female family member.http://www.rodtarnowski.com/Family_p.html History Hetman Jan Amor Tarnowski by Marcello Bacciarelli. Jan Krzysztof Tarnowski. The Tarnowski family was one of the oldest and most powerful magnate families in Poland. It reached its apex in the 14th, 15th and the 16th centuries, when members of the Tarn√≥w, Melsztyn and later Jaros≈Çaw branches held prominent positions beside the Piast and Jagiellon kings of Poland. From father to son, the Tarnowski family held ten times the office of voivode of Krak√≥w Voivodeship and six times the office of castellan of Krak√≥w. The history of the family started with the trusted advisor of the last Piast kings Comes Spytek z Melsztyna, the progenitor of the Tarnowski-Melszty≈Ñski- Jaros≈Çawski family. By 1320 he held the office of voivode of Krakow, and from 1331 the highest secular office in the Kingdom of Poland, castellan of Krakow. For his military service, King W≈Çadys≈Çaw I the Elbow-high gave him large estates on the Dunajec river, where Spytek founded the city of Tarnow in 1330 and built two stronghold castles in Tarnow and Melsztyn around 1340. After the death of Spytek, the castle of Melsztyn was inherited by his son Jan z Melsztyna, who like his father was from 1360 voivode and castellan of Krak√≥w. His younger brother, the castellan of Wi≈õlica Rafa≈Ç z Tarnowa, became the owner of Tarnow. Rafa≈Ç expanded his estates, adding land in Sandomierz, Wielowie≈õ and Dzik√≥w. After the death of Jan Krzysztof Tarnowski, the majority of the Tarnowski lands passed to the Ostrogski family, marked in pink Waleria Tarnowska. Stanis≈Çaw Tarnowski by Jan Matejko. Jan Dzier≈ºys≈Çaw Tarnowski. The son of Jan z Melsztyna, Spytek z Melsztyna, was the next owner of Melsztyn. He was voivode of Krakow, Feudal Lord of Podolia, and hero of the 1399 battle of Worskla. Rafa≈Ç's son Jan z Tarnowa was appointed General Starost of Ruthenia, and both voivode and castellan of Krak√≥w. The Tarnowski-Melszty≈Ñski family achieved the highest offices in the country as well as extraordinary wealth and huge feudal estates, including land in Jaros≈Çaw, Sambor, Podole, etc. Their most significant role in the history of Poland was to organise the union of Queen Jadwiga and W≈Çadys≈Çaw II Jagie≈Ç≈Ço and to initiate their coronation. After the death of Spytek z Melsztyna and the death of his son, who was also named Spytek z Melsztyna, in the 1439 battle of Grotniki, the Melsztyn line declined. In the Tarn√≥w line, the sons of Jan z Tarnowa fought in the Battle of Grunwald in 1410 and after that divided the family property. Jan the voivode of Krak√≥w Voivodeship settled in Tarn√≥w, and the voivode of Sandomierz Voivodeship Spytek became the owner of Jaros≈Çaw, where he started a new branch of the family, called the \\"Leliwita branch\\". Jan z Tarnowa had five sons, of which Jan Amor Starszy Tarnowski and Jan Gratus Tarnowski together with their cousin, Spytek z Jaros≈Çawia, died with King W≈Çadys≈Çaw III of Poland in the 1444 Battle of Varna. His third son Jan Rafa≈Ç Tarnowski became a priest and the last two, Jan Feliks Tarnowski became voivode of Lublin Voivodeship, while Jan Amor M≈Çodszy Tarnowski inherited Tarn√≥w and was appointed voivode of Krak√≥w, and in 1490 castellan of Krak√≥w. The son of Jan Amor M≈Çodszy, Jan Amor Tarnowski, became Great Crown Hetman, voivode of Krak√≥w and castellan of Krak√≥w. In 1540 he built a castle and founded the city of Tarnopol (1548). Coat of arms and motto The Tarnowski family used the \\"Leliwa coat of arms\\" and their motto was: \\"Tendite ad astra viri\\". It is a quotation from Valerius Flaccus' Argonautica, book I, verse 563.

From 1974 to 1986 he served as President of Austria. Early life and education Born in Niederkappel, Upper Austria, Kirschl√§ger was orphaned at the age of 11. He graduated from high school in Horn in 1935 with distinction and started to study law at the University of Vienna. However, after the Anschluss of Austria in 1938, he had to give up his studies. Without joining the NSDAP, which he refused to do, his scholarship was revoked and Kirchschl√§ger could not finance his studies any longer. Kirchschl√§ger worked as a bank clerk in 1938 until he was drafted to service in the infantry of the Wehrmacht in the summer of 1939. Kirchschl√§ger fought as a soldier from the very beginning of the war, first during the invasion of Poland, later on the Western Front, and after 1941 against Russia on the Eastern Front. In late 1940, in order to get out of the military, he used a two-month front-leave to prepare for the final exam (Staatsexamen) of his law studies. Legend has it that he was working up to 20 hours a day, while keeping himself awake with large amounts of honey. Subsequently, he passed the exams and graduated to Doctor iuris. However, he was sent back to the Eastern Front, where he was wounded in 1942. Towards the end of war, he was captain and training officer at the military academy at Wiener Neustadt in the Vienna region. In early April 1945, commanding a company of cadets fighting approaching Soviet troops, he was badly wounded on his leg, an injury from which he never fully recovered. Post-WW2 After the war, Kirchschl√§ger worked as a district judge until 1954 in Langenlois and later Vienna. In 1954, he got the chance to work in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, although he did not speak any foreign languages. In order to take part in the negotiations on the Austrian State Treaty, he taught himself English in only a few months. From 1967 until 1970, he was ambassador in Prague. Despite orders not to do so, he issued exit visas to Czech citizens who tried to flee from the Communists during the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia. From 1970-74 he was Minister of Foreign Affairs. Presidency Kirchschl√§ger was elected President of Austria in 1974. In a programmatic lecture at Innsbruck University in February 1971 he outlined his understanding of an \\"ethical foreign policy\\". In 1974, he issued a pardon to convicted Austrian Nazi war criminal Franz Novak, who had coordinated the railroad deportation of European Jews to concentration and extermination camps. In 1980 he was elected for a second term with an approval rate of 80%, the highest rate ever obtained in any presidential elections. In February 1984, he paid the first state visit of an Austrian President to the United States. Family Herma Kirchschl√§ger, 1978 He was married to Herma Sorger (born 15 May 1916, Vienna ‚Äì died 30 May 2009, Vienna) from 17 August 1940 until his death; they had two children: Christa (born 14 August 1944) and Walter (born 27 April 1947).Senta Ziegler: √ñsterreichs First Ladies.

Aquidneck Island was known at the time as Rhode Island, and it later became part of the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations. Hutchinson sailed from England to New England in 1634 with his large family. He became a merchant in Boston and served as both Deputy to the General Court and selectman. His wife was Anne Hutchinson, who became embroiled in a theological controversy with the Puritan leaders of the Massachusetts Bay Colony which resulted in her banishment in 1638. The Hutchinsons and 18 others departed to form the new settlement of Pocasset on the Narragansett Bay, which was renamed Portsmouth and became one of the original towns in the Rhode Island colony. Hutchinson became treasurer in Portsmouth and William Coddington was the judge (or governor). A controversy compelled Coddington to relocate in 1639 and establish the town of Newport, at which time Hutchinson became the chief magistrate of Portsmouth. This lasted for less than a year, however, as he died shortly after June 1641, and his widow and many of her younger children moved to New Netherland (later in the Bronx in New York City). Mrs. Hutchinson and all but one of her children perished shortly thereafter, massacred by Indians. William Hutchinson was described by Governor John Winthrop as being mild tempered, somewhat weak, and living within the shadow of his prominent and outspoken wife.  Early life  William Hutchinson was born into a prominent Lincolnshire family. He was the grandson of John Hutchinson (1515‚Äì1565) who had been Sheriff, Alderman, and Mayor of the town of Lincoln, dying in office during his second term as mayor. John's youngest son Edward (1564‚Äì1632) moved to Alford and had 11 children with his wife Susanna, the oldest of whom was William, who was baptized 14 August 1586 in Alford. Historical highway marker for William and Anne Hutchinson property at Mount Wollaston, later in Quincy, Massachusetts William Hutchinson grew up in Alford where he was the warden of his church in 1620 and 1621. He then became a merchant in the cloth trade and moved to London. Here he renewed a friendship from Alford with Anne Marbury, the daughter of Francis Marbury and Bridget Dryden, and the couple were married on 9 August 1612 at the Church of Saint Mary Woolnoth on Lombard Street in London. Anne's father was a clergyman, school master, and Puritan reformer who was educated at Cambridge. Hutchinson and his wife raised a large family in Alford, as he prospered in his business. The couple had 14 children in England, one of whom died in infancy, and two of whom died from the plague. The Hutchinsons, particularly Anne, became very enamored with the preaching of the Reverend John Cotton who was the vicar of Saint Botolph's Church in the town of Boston, about 21 miles from Alford, and they made the day-long round trip to Boston whenever they could to hear Cotton preach. Cotton had strong Puritan sympathies, however, and Archbishop William Laud began cracking down on those whose opinions differed from the established Anglican church. Cotton was forced into hiding, and then had to flee the country to avoid imprisonment. Mrs. Hutchinson was distraught to lose her mentor, and the family intended to sail with him to New England aboard the ship Griffin in 1633; however, Anne's 14th pregnancy prevented it. Instead, they sent their oldest son Edward, age 20 and under the care of Cotton, with the intention of following to New England as soon as they could. William Hutchinson's youngest brother, also named Edward, was aboard the same ship with his wife. In 1634, William Hutchinson, his wife Anne, and his other ten children sailed from England to New England on the Griffin, the same ship that had taken Cotton and their oldest son a year earlier. The family first resided at Boston where Hutchinson was admitted to the Boston Church on 26 October 1634, and his wife was admitted seven days later. He became a merchant in Boston and took the freeman's oath there in 1635. He was one of the town's Deputies to the Massachusetts Bay General Court from 1635 to 1636, and was also a selectman from 1635 to 1637, attending a selectmen's meeting for the last time in January 1638 as his tenure in Boston was coming to an end.  Trouble in Boston  \\"Anne Hutchinson on Trial\\" by Edwin Austin Abbey Hutchinson's wife was described by historian Thomas W. Bicknell, writing 300 years after she lived, as \\"a pure and excellent woman, to whose person and conduct there attaches no stain.\\" Her own contemporaries, however, did not view her in the same light. She was helpful to the sick and needy, and she was undeniably gifted in argument and speech, but her theological doctrines and open disdain toward Boston's ministers began to inflame a growing controversy between Cotton's followers and the Puritan elders. In late 1636, Governor John Winthrop wrote that Mrs. Hutchinson was \\"a woman of ready wit and bold spirit,\\" but she had brought several dangerous theological errors which he elaborated on in his journal. She was holding private meetings at her home, drawing many people from Boston and other towns, including many prominent citizens, and teaching them a religious view that was increasingly antithetical to the views of the Puritan church. She also began to express an open disdain for most of the Puritan ministers, with the exception of Cotton. She was finally put on trial in November 1637, convicted, and banished from the colony along with some of her followers.  Settling in Rhode Island  Portsmouth Compact with William Hutchinson's signature third on the list William Hutchinson and other supporters of his wife signed the Portsmouth Compact on 7 March 1638 before leaving Boston, agreeing to form a non- sectarian government that was Christian in character. The group of signers considered going to New Netherland, but Roger Williams suggested that they purchase some land on the Narragansett Bay from the Narragansett Indians. They purchased Aquidneck Island, which was called Rhode Island at the time, and formed the settlement of Pocasset there, which was renamed Portsmouth in 1639. In June 1638, Hutchinson was the treasurer of the town and William Coddington was called judge, the name given to the chief magistrate of the settlement. The following year, a disagreement prompted Coddington and a few other leaders to leave Portsmouth and begin a new settlement at the south end of the island called Newport. Hutchinson became the judge (governor) of the Portsmouth settlement from 1639 until 12 March 1640, when Portsmouth united with Newport to become the Colony of Rhode Island, with Coddington elected as governor of the two-town colony, and Hutchinson becoming one of his assistants. In his journal, Governor Winthrop described the 1639 disagreement in Portsmouth: \\"the people grew very tumultuous and put out Mr. Coddington and the other three magistrates, and chose Mr. William Hutchinson only, a man of very mild temper and weak parts, and wholly guided by his wife, who had been the beginner of all the former troubles in the country and still continued to breed disturbance.\\" Hutchinson died in Portsmouth shortly after June 1641, after which his widow left Rhode Island to live in New Netherland on the border between the modern-day Bronx and Westchester County, New York. Soon after the move, she and her entire household were murdered by Indians in a massacre during a war with the Dutch in late summer 1643, with only one daughter escaping.  Family and descendants  William and Anne Hutchinson had 15 children, all but the last born in England. The oldest child was Edward, a captain who died from wounds received at the battle of Wheeler's Surprise during King Philip's War. The fourth child was Faith, who married Thomas Savage, a Boston soldier and merchant. The fifth child was Bridget; she married John Sanford who succeeded William Coddington as Governor of the two towns on Rhode Island (Portsmouth and Newport) following the repeal of the Coddington Commission. Their 14th child was Susanna, the only survivor of the Indian massacre which killed her mother and six of her siblings. She was taken captive by those Indians and held by them for several years. Hutchinson's sister Mary was the wife of the Reverend John Wheelwright, another banished minister who founded Exeter, New Hampshire. Prominent descendants of William and Anne Hutchinston include U.S. Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt, George H. W. Bush, and George W. Bush.

A commercial success considered to be influential in Danish film history, it marked Mads Mikkelsen's film debut. The film is set in the criminal underground of Copenhagen, Denmark, and tells the story of the drug dealer Frank (Kim Bodnia) who, after losing a large amount of money in a drug deal gone wrong, falls into desperation as he only has a few days to raise the money he owes. Although he did not want to turn Pusher into a franchise, financial difficulties forced Winding Refn to make two sequels: Pusher II, focusing on Mikkelsen's character after the events of the first film, and Pusher 3, focusing on another secondary character introduced in Pusher; both sequels were financial and critical successes as well. A Hindi remake of the film was also released in 2010, followed by a British remake in 2012. Plot The film begins in Copenhagen with a low-level drug dealer Frank (Kim Bodnia) going to a heroin deal with his sidekick Tonny (Mads Mikkelsen). The pair only manage to sell some of their product, and then waste time about town. Frank then visits his friend Vic (Laura Drasb√¶k), a prostitute who holds some of Frank's stash for a fee. Vic wants to have a serious relationship with Frank, but Frank prefers to keep it purely casual. Frank is visited by a former cell mate, a Swede named Hasse (Peter Andersson), and the pair set up a large drug deal. Frank visits his supplier, the Serbian local drug lord Milo (Zlatko Buriƒá), to get the heroin. Already owing Milo some money, Frank cannot cover the cost of the heroin, but Milo allows him to take the drugs provided that he immediately returns with the money. The deal goes bad, however, when police arrive. In the process of evading the police, Frank dumps the heroin in a lake. At the station, police officers convince Frank that Tonny has delivered a confession that implicates Frank, but he still does not admit to anything. When Frank is released after 24 hours he returns to Milo to explain how he lost the money and the drugs. Milo does not believe Frank's story and demands that he pay back even more than he already owes. Frank then immediately seeks Tonny out and savagely beats him with a baseball bat. Milo's henchman Radovan (Slavko Laboviƒá) accompanies Frank to help him collect on some of his own debts to use toward his debt with Milo. The pair have a friendly conversation and Radovan shares his secret desire to open a restaurant. Radovan tries to force an addict customer of Frank's to rob a bank to cover his debt, but the addict commits suicide in front of them. As Frank makes other disastrous attempts to earn money, Vic becomes increasingly insistent that they behave as a couple. He takes her to several clubs and makes plans to drive her to the veterinarian to see her sick dog. Frank finally makes a deal, but his drug mule betrays him and switches the heroin for baking soda. Radovan drops his friendly demeanour and begins threatening Frank with serious injury should he fail to pay up soon. Frank goes on a desperate rampage, stealing some money and drugs from the gym of some drug- dealing bodybuilders, but he is soon picked up by Radovan and tortured. Frank manages to escape and makes plans to flee with Vic to Spain. After successfully making his final deal in Copenhagen, Frank receives a call from Milo, who promises to accept a token payment to put an end to their feud. When Frank bluntly informs Vic that their plans to flee are cancelled, she steals his stash of money and runs off. The film ends with Frank grimly catching his breath as his enemies throughout the city prepare to dispose of him.

Refn turned down the offer he subsequently received, instead deciding to transform Pusher into a feature-length independent film utilizing a nominal amount of funding that he had managed to acquire. Refn partnered with film student Jens Dahl to write the film's screenplay. His goal was to tell the story of a man under pressure, without glamorizing the lifestyle of a drug dealer. Refn organized the plot's events according to the days of the week in his notes and this was subsequently established in the final product. Refn's major inspirations for the film were The Battle of Algiers, Cannibal Holocaust, The French Connection, The Killing of a Chinese Bookie and Mean Streets. Filming During rehearsal, Winding Refn became dissatisfied with the actor he had cast as Frank, thinking him too placid and boring. Two weeks before shooting was to begin, Winding Refn fired the actor without a replacement in line. Winding Refn approached Kim Bodnia, who was an established actor at the time, and Bodnia accepted. Though the other primary roles were mostly filled with experienced actors, many of the minor roles were filled by Winding Refn's friends or people accustomed to the street life. Bodnia brought a greater degree of intensity and aggressiveness to the part that some actors were not prepared for. Winding Refn claimed that the surprised reactions of some actors are genuine, as they had not rehearsed with Bodnia beforehand and were expecting the previous actor's more sedate performances. Slavko Laboviƒá, who played the Serbian thug Radovan, was a friend of Serbian war criminal ≈Ωeljko Ra≈ænatoviƒá. He provided a poster of Ra≈ænatoviƒá to use as a prop in Milo's headquarters. The actor playing Milo, Zlatko Buriƒá, is actually a Croat. Winding Refn became concerned when violence flared between Serbs and Croats during filming, but the events did not cause problems on set. The film was shot using Danish union rules, which allowed no more than 8 hours of filming per day, and no filming on weekends. The rules, combined with the high cost of filming permits, caused time and budget constraints. The film was shot entirely using hand-held cameras. Winding Refn wanted to capture a realistic, documentary feel to the film. This caused problems with the time constraints of the shooting schedule and Winding Refn's desire to keep the film shadowy. Actors are often backlit or difficult to see due to the low levels of lighting used. The film was shot almost completely in chronological order. Winding Refn later admitted that shooting scenes out of order was confusing to him; however, some scenes were reshot or added later. The scene in which Frank shoots at Milo's thugs was originally filmed without special effects, but Winding Refn was dissatisfied with the results and reshot the scene using squibs. The scene with the junkie was shot after shooting had completed to replace a previous scene that Refn discarded because it dealt with an outdated vision of Frank's character. Soundtrack Punk rocker Peter Peter and composer Povl Kristian composed the score and formed the temporary band Prisoner to perform the score: Peter playing guitar and Kristian playing the clavier. Kristian also composed the song \\"Summers got the colour\\" with text by Lars K. Andersen which was sung by Aud Wilken. Although Povl Kristian did not return to work on the sequels, the \\"Pusher theme\\" he wrote with Peter Peter was used in all of the following films. Reception The film was considered the first Danish-language gangster film and became a break-through success for Winding Refn and several of the lead actors. Winding Refn claimed that the film inspired cults of highly dedicated fans and influenced Danish fashion to emulate certain costumes worn by the characters. Kim Bodnia launched a very successful career as a leading man in Danish cinema largely due to the success of the movie. Zlatko Buriƒá was given a Bodil Award in 1997 for his performance as Milo. The film holds a score of 81% positive reviews on Rotten Tomatoes with the average score of 6.9/10. The review aggregator site Metacritic has given the movie an average score of 72 out of 100, which means \\"Generally favorable reviews\\".http://www.metacritic.com/movie/pusher Sequels Two sequels followed, focusing on different characters from the same \\"underworld\\" milieu of Copenhagen. Pusher II follows Frank's former partner, Tonny. Tonny struggles with his relationship with his father following his release from prison; Tonny concurrently negotiates the prospect of becoming a father himself and the discovery that his mother had died while he was incarcerated. Pusher 3 follows drug lord, Milo. Milo is followed through the course of a hectic day, as he struggles with his attempt at sobriety, a series of problematic criminal deals, and his daughter's birthday celebration for which he is the chef.

The protagonist Orlando, having been thwarted in love, goes mad with despair and rampages through Europe and Africa, destroying everything in his path. The English knight Astolfo, seeking to find a cure for Orlando's madness, flies up to the Moon in Elijah's flaming chariot.

There he meets several Moon men who all wonder whether Earth is inhabited and decide this must be impossible. Back on Earth the lifeless body of the watchman is found and he is brought to a hospital, where they take his shoes off, breaking the spell again. He awakens and declares it to have been the most terrible night he had ever experienced. *The Princess of the Moon: A Confederate Fairy Story (1869) by \\"A Lady of Warrenton, Va\\" (Cora Semmes Ives) has the \\"Fairy of the Moon\\" descend to Earth to save a Confederate soldier from his grief after the U.S. Civil War.

In the story, the dog has flown to the Moon and had a whole series of amusing adventures there. The story was only published posthumously. In addition, Isil and the guidesman Tilion in J. R. R. Tolkien's fictional Middle-earth cosmology are based in Tolkien's familiarity with Norse and Gaelic myths of the Moon. *Doctor Dolittle in the Moon (1928) was intended to be the last of Hugh Lofting's Doctor Dolittle books. The Doctor, with his unique ability to communicate with animals, arrived in the Moon on the back of a giant moth and finds a considerably different kind of fauna (for example, Moon insects are far bigger than the local birds), and more startlingly, intelligent plants whose language he learns (as he never did with earthly plants). He also meets the Moon's single human inhabitant, a prehistoric man who has grown into an enormous giant due to lunar foods and conditions (which soon happens to the doctor himself).

Science fiction=LiteratureEarly stories= Lucian's Icaromenippus and True History, written in the 2nd century AD, deal with imaginary voyages to the Moon such as on a fountain after going past the Pillars of Hercules. The theme did not become popular until the 17th century, however, when the invention of the telescope hastened the popular acceptance of the concept of \\"a world in the Moon\\", that is, that the Moon was an inhabitable planet, which might be reached via some sort of a√´rial carriage. The concept of another world, close to our own and capable of looking down at it from a distance, provided ample scope for satirical comments on the manners of the Earthly world. Among the early stories dealing with this concept are: *Somnium (1541) by Juan Maldonado *The Dream (Somnium) (1634) by Johannes Kepler (written before 1610, but not published during Kepler's life). An Icelandic voyager is transported to the Moon by a√´rial demons; an occasion for Kepler to offer some of his astronomical theories in the guise of fiction. *The Man in the Moone (1638) by Francis Godwin.

The hereditary chief of Clan Campbell, and a prominent figure in Scottish politics, he was a Royalist supporter during the latter stages of the Scottish Civil War and its aftermath. During the period of the Cromwellian Protectorate he was involved in several Royalist uprisings and was for a time imprisoned. Despite his previous loyalty, after the Restoration of Charles II, Argyll fell under suspicion due to his hereditary judicial powers in the Highlands and his strong Presbyterian religious sympathies. Condemned to death in 1681 on a highly dubious charge of treason and libel, he escaped from prison and fled into exile, where he began associating with Whig opponents of the Stuart regime. Following the accession of Charles' brother to the throne as James II in 1685, Argyll returned to Scotland in an attempt to depose James, organised in parallel with the Monmouth Rebellion. Argyll's Rising failed, and Argyll was captured and beheaded. Early life Argyll's birthplace: Newbattle Abbey, Dalkeith. He was born in 1629 in Dalkeith, Scotland, the eldest son of Archibald Campbell, 1st Marquess of Argyll, and Lady Margaret Douglas, the daughter of William Douglas, 7th Earl of Morton. At the age of four, an agreement was made, in accordance with a custom common amongst the Scottish nobility of the time, for young Archibald to be fostered with Colin Campbell of Glenorchy, one of his father's kinsmen.Nugent, \\"Your louing childe and foster: the fostering of Archie Campbell of Argyll\\" in Nugent and Ewan (eds.), Children and youth in premodern Scotland, 2015, p. 47 At his parents' insistence he was raised bilingually in English and Gaelic.Nugent, p. 57 He enrolled at Glasgow University in 1643,Archibald Campbell, University of Georgia Law Library and between 1647 and 1649 his father sent him to travel in France and Italy, mainly to protect him from the political upheavals taking place in Scotland at the time. His father, as one of the most powerful nobles in Scotland, became heavily involved in the politics of the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, emerging as the leader of the Presbyterian Covenanter party and as the de facto head of the Scottish government for much of the period. While still on the Continent, young Archibald heard the news of the execution of King Charles I, and wrote to Queen Henrietta Maria assuring her of his loyalty to the Stuart dynasty.Willcock, A Scots Earl in Covenanting Times, p. 22 In the letter he also reiterated his father's loyalty, and defended him against accusations that he had approved of Charles's trial and execution, but added that he would serve the King even against his father, if the latter really meant otherwise than he professed. From c.1638 he bore the courtesy title Lord Lorne. 1650s In 1650, after his return to Scotland, Lorne married Mary, the daughter of James Stuart, 4th Earl of Moray: the same year he was appointed to the governing Committee of Estates, his first major position of responsibility. When Charles II was invited to Scotland in 1650 in a brief alliance with the Covenanters against the English Parliament, Lorne was made captain of His Majesty's Foot Guards, appointed by the Scottish parliament to attend on the king's person. At the time Charles was chafing under the social restraints laid upon him by the Presbyterian clergy, but Lorne obtained favour with him by bringing him people he wished to see. Lorne was present with his regiment at the Battle of Dunbar on 3 September 1650, where his regiment was nearly wiped outWillcock, p. 29 and where he was supposed to have conducted himself with personal bravery, and at the Battle of Worcester, where Charles was defeated. Glencairn's Rising After Worcester, in the winter of 1653, Lorne joined William Cunningham, 9th Earl of Glencairn, who was in arms in the Highlands with a Royalist force of 700 soldiers and 200 horses. Lorne's father, who had attempted to make peace with Cromwell's regime, warned him against becoming involved, leading to an estrangement. It has since been suspected that the political differences between Lorne and his father were exaggerated by the family in order to ensure they would prosper whichever political side won out, though Lorne's biographer John Willcock felt that his Royalist sympathies were entirely genuine.Willcock, p. 23 Glencairn's irregular forces prepared to invade the Lowlands, but efforts were hampered by constant quarrels between Glencairn's junior commanders. Lorne and Glengarry fell out to the point of drawing swords on each other, and remained at odds. Glencairn, for his part, distrusted Lorne. When Lorne and the Viscount of Kenmure went in joint command of a force to suppress the Kintyre remonstrants (radical Presbyterians who disapproved of the moderates' engagement with Charles)Remonstrants, Resolutioners and Protesters, British Civil Wars project Kenmure thought that Lorne treated them too leniently, and complained to Glencairn. In March Lorne argued with James Graham, 2nd Marquess of Montrose, and came close to being killed. Shortly afterwards Lorne had a final argument with Glencairn over who had authority over Lorne's own tenants. Lorne refused to give precedence to Glencairn, and took his own troops across a nearby river. For the rest of the day Glencairn feared an open battle, but the next night Lorne left his men and departed with only a few officers. The reason for this, according to Baillie, was that a letter from Lorne to the King had been intercepted in which he complained of Glencairn's behaviour, and Glencairn had ordered Glengarry to arrest him. A correspondent of John Thurloe reported a version of events more discreditable to Lorne: that the intercepted letter was written to the general of the English forces, suggesting a plan for attacking Glencairn's men. Activities against the Commonwealth Portrait of Archibald Campbell, Lord Lorne, by unknown artist, formerly in collection of the Earl of Balcarres. In May 1654, Cromwell published his Ordinance of Pardon and Grace to the People of Scotland, offering a general pardon for acts during the conflict. Lorne was, however, among the numerous exceptions to the pardon. In June he was reported as being reconciled with his father, Argyll, and as helping him to raise men for the English. The report was probably wrong, as in September he managed to capture a vessel loaded with provisions for Argyll's men. Later in 1654, Lorne is thought to have joined John Middleton's attempted insurrection, and by November he and his men were raiding his father's lands for cattle to feed Middleton's troops. Argyll was eventually compelled to ask for an English garrison to protect him from his son. By the beginning of December, however, Lorne had to retire to a small island with only four or five men, and on 16 December George Monck wrote to Cromwell that Lorne was to meet his father, and would probably come over to the Protector if allowed. Lorne, however, informed Argyll that he could not capitulate without Middleton's formal approval. Lorne was clearly still in communication with Charles, as in December the latter wrote to Lorne from his exile in Cologne, thanking him for his constancy to Middleton in all his distresses, acknowledging his service to the Royalist cause, and promising future rewards. Lorne's Royalist connections remained strong enough that on 18 January 1655 even Lorne's wife was driven out of Argyllshire by Cromwell's troops. On 31 March Lorne eventually received instructions from Charles, through Middleton, in which he was urged to lose no time in taking such a course, by capitulation or otherwise, as he should judge \\"most fit and expedient to save his person, family, and estate.\\" He is spoken of as having been \\"principallie engaged in the enlyvening of the war, and one of the chief movers;\\" and his \\"deportments in relation to the enemy and the last war are beyond all \\". Another letter to the same effect from Middleton reached him in April, dated from Paris, in which he is similarly praised. Both of these letters were produced at his trial in 1681, in an attempt to reaffirm his history of loyalty to Charles. Later in 1655, probably in May, conditions for Lorne's surrender were drawn up and finally received Cromwell's approval in August. These were that Lorne and the heads of clans serving him should come in within three weeks; that he should give security for ¬£5,000, his officers and vassals giving proportional security; that Lorne should have liberty to march with his horses and arms (the horses to be sold in three weeks); and that he and his party should enjoy their estates without molestation, and should be freed from all fines or forfeiture. By 8 November the arrangement had been formalised and garrisons were left at Lochaber and Dunstaffnage to ensure Lorne's promises were kept. Despite his surrender, Lorne was carefully watched by Broghill, who bribed his servants, and who sent accounts of his movements to Cromwell's spymaster John Thurloe. On 20 November Broghill urged Lorne's arrest purely in order that enemies more dangerous at the time might think themselves unobserved. By the following January, however, Lorne had again declared for Charles Stuart, and had taken the island and garrison of Mull. On 8 January, Thurloe was notified that Lorne had a meeting of all his friends (probably to organise his debts, which were substantial). Lorne apparently came to a reconciliation with his father in late March: the latter brokered further agreements with the English Protectorate ‚Äì of which one was that he or Lorne, whichever the parliament might direct, should go to England whenever desired, provided they had freedom within a compass of twenty miles, and leave to have audience of the council whenever they wished. Arrest, imprisonment and head injury Despite his capitulation, Lorne was still regarded with great suspicion. On 13 May 1656 Lord Broghill reported that he was back in correspondence with Charles, repeating the warning later in the year. Broghill suspected that Lorne had been appointed, with Fairfax, to head another Scottish revolt. Probably in consequence of Broghill's information, a new oath was imposed upon the Scottish nobility at the beginning of 1657, whereby they were compelled to swear their renunciation of the Stuarts, and their adherence to the Protectorate. Lorne refused the oath, and was immediately imprisoned in Edinburgh castle. In August 1657 Broghill urged that he and Glencairn, as the two most dangerous persons then in Scotland, should be sent to England, where they would have less opportunity for \\"trinketing\\". While Lorne was confined in the castle of Edinburgh a strange accident befell him in March 1658 during a game of \\"bullets\\", a form of bowling. It was described by Lamont: \\"Being playing at the bullets in the castell, the lieutenant of the castell throwing the bullett, it lighted on a stone, and with such force started back on the Lord Lorne's head that he fell doune, and lay for the space of some houres dead; after that he recovered, and his head was trepanned once or twice.\\" Lorne recovered slowly and with difficulty from the skull fracture, which in modern times would likely have being diagnosed as a severe concussion, which would explain the nap he took before his execution. Several later historians speculated that some of his apparently erratic behaviour, and occasional fits of temper, in later life, can be explained by it. The date of his release is not known, but it was probably in March 1659‚Äì60, when Lauderdale and the other prisoners taken at Worcester were set free. At the Restoration At the 1660 Restoration of Charles II, Lorne went to London and was received kindly by the King. However, when his father, the Marquess, followed him hoping for a reconciliation with Charles he was arrested: as a result of his role in the Civil War he was executed in May 1661 for treason and his estates forfeit. Despite Lorne's history of loyalty to Charles he had powerful enemies at Court, and fifteen months after his father's death was himself threatened with beheading over a charge of \\"leasing making\\" (a form of libel). Charles however requested that the sentence be postponed: several months later Lorne was released, and his grandfather's title and estates were restored to him in October 1663. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in October 1663. Earl of Argyll Although he had finally regained the title of Earl and much of his inheritance, Argyll's affairs were still encumbered by debt. His harsh treatment of his own debtors and apparently unscrupulous use of his hereditary and other offices gave him a poor reputation amongst some contemporaries. He was also involved in ongoing litigation with Montrose, although they were reconciled by February 1667. Montrose visited Argyll at Inveraray in August, and in March 1669 Argyll travelled to Perthshire from Inveraray to attend his funeral, becoming guardian to his son. On 29 April 1664 Argyll was placed on the Scottish Privy Council. During 1664 and 1665 he was regarded as one of the chief members of John Maitland, 1st Duke of Lauderdale's party, Lauderdale being godfather to one of his children. During the mid 1660s Argyll remained for the most part at Inveraray Castle, exercising his hereditary office of grand justiciar of the highlands, and mediating between highland chiefs. He devoted a great deal of attention to planning the gardens at Inveraray, and was particularly interested in tree raising and planting, seeking advice from John Evelyn on the subject.Willcock, pp. 152‚Äì3 His plan was to stock the gardens themselves with fruit trees, and to thickly plant ornamental trees around so that the house had the appearance of rising out of a wood: he had a particular fondness for elms. He also devoted time to the production of salt herrings and distilling whisky, hoping to create an export trade to England, and sent samples of his products both to Lauderdale and to Charles II. Although Argyll had some involvement in the religious disputes of the period, acting to disarm the Covenanters in Kintyre, he was regarded as one of the moderates on the Privy Council. There remained opponents amongst the other council members, particularly James Sharp, the Archbishop of St Andrews. This opposition to Argyll surfaced in an attempt to challenge his formal restoration to his hereditary offices in October 1666. It again appeared when the Pentland Rising took place: Sharp would not allow Argyll's forces to participate, fearing that he and his men would join the rebels. After their rout the leaders of the rebels tried to reach the west coast to cross over to Ireland, and on 14 December Argyll received instructions from the Privy Council to capture them if possible. In 1667 Argyll received a new charter of all his lands and hereditary and other offices from Charles II. On 3 August he was appointed, with Atholl and Seaforth, to have the oversight of the Highlands, which were then in a disturbed state. He was still on good terms with Lauderdale, and backed him against the other main party on the Privy Council, headed by the 7th Earl of Rothes: in September he wrote to Lauderdale urging him to secure Rothes's resignation of the commissionership. Anna. In May 1668 Argyll's wife died; his personal letters at the time describe his feelings of desolation at her death. In October 1669 Lauderdale visited Scotland as high commissioner. Argyll was aware that Elizabeth Murray, Lady Dysart, who was shortly to become Lauderdale's second wife, was using her influence against him, and made a point of personally attending Lauderdale at Berwick. At the opening of the Scottish Parliament he carried the sceptre. One of the issues debated by this parliament was to formally ratify the reversal of Argyll's father's forfeiture. This was opposed by the 11th Earl of Erroll and other of Argyll's creditors, but Lauderdale pushed the ratification through by deciding it was not to be voted on and a matter for the King alone to decide.Willcock, p. 170 On 28 January 1670 Argyll married for the second time, to Lady Anna Mackenzie, dowager Lady Balcarres.Rosalind K. Marshall, 'Mackenzie, Anna, countess of Balcarres and countess of Argyll (c.1621 ‚Äì 1707)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Oct 2006 accessed 29 Nov 2014 This caused a brief souring of his relationship with Lauderdale, who thought that his godson, the young earl, would be adversely affected by the marriage. Argyll was opposed to further persecution of the western Covenanters, but was ordered by the privy council to suppress the conventicles in his jurisdiction. On 11 July 1674 he was made an extraordinary lord of session. He had in May been made a member of the committee for public affairs appointed to put down conventicles; in 1677 he was still supporting moderate measures. He quietly rebuilt his alliance with Lauderdale, and the daughter of the second Duchess of Lauderdale married his eldest son, Lord Lorne. On 10 October 1678 he received a commission to seize, with the aid of three companies, the Isle of Mull, where a vicious turf war had been going on between Argyll and the McCleans since 1674. It took until 1680 for him to gain possession. Downfall The 9th Earl of Argyll, engraving \\"from life\\" of c.1680 by David Loggan On 12 April 1679, in consequence of the Popish Plot allegations in England, Argyll received a special commission to secure the Highlands and to disarm all Catholics, particularly the Macleans and Macdonalds. He initially wrote requesting the aid of regular troops to assist his clansmen, and received assistance from the Sheriffs of Dumbarton and Bute, as well as \\"twelvehundredweight of powder\\". However, in the interim severe disorder broke out amongst the Covenanters of southern Scotland following their assassination of Argyll's old opponent Archbishop Sharp, culminating in an effective open rebellion and the Battle of Drumclog. Given Argyll's previous moderate treatment of the Covenanters, the Privy Council debated cancelling his commission and he was ordered to report with as many men as he could raise to the camp of the Earl of Linlithgow, the Commander-in-Chief of the Royal forces.Willcock, pp. 232‚Äì233 By this point Argyll was in a difficult position: not only did his Presbyterian sympathies (not to mention those of his late father) make him suspect to the Court party, but his heritable jurisdictions and personal power in the west of Scotland, as the head of Clan Campbell, made him a constant threat to the King's authority.Willcock, p. 249 Matters came to a head when in 1680 James, Duke of York replaced Lauderdale as High Commissioner in Scotland. A parliament was held in 1681, Argyll bearing the crown at the opening on 13 August. James told Argyll that the king thought him an over-mighty subject: Argyll, finding himself isolated, assured James of his loyalty, and signed a letter of the council to Charles confirming the divine right of kings. The same month, James paid a solemn visit of ceremony to Argyll at Stirling, and directly asked him if he would convert to Catholicism, promising him great influence in Scotland if he did. Argyll, however, reiterated his dedication to Protestantism, a statement received coldly by James. The 1681 parliament passed a Scottish Test Act, the \\"Act anent Religion and the Test\\". Like other Test Acts this contained a declaration of adherence to Protestantism, with an added oath of allegiance to the King's authority, to be taken by persons in office. Argyll complained about the substance of the Act, noting its internal contradictions in that it upheld Presbyterianism while committing subjects to follow the monarch's authority in religion, and concerned that the Royal Family themselves ‚Äì given their Catholic leanings ‚Äì were not obliged to take it. He then prevaricated over taking the test himself, despite being warned that his earlier complaints had put him in a dangerous position. Eventually he took the oath, but added the caveat \\"only in as far as it is consistent with itself\\".Fritz and Robison (eds) Historical Dictionary of Stuart England, 1996, p. 68 Argyll seems to have been under the belief that this qualified version of the oath had been cleared with the Duke of York, but it was enough for an exasperated James, backed by Argyll's enemies, to have him arrested on 9 November and charged with treason, assuming the legislative power, perjury, and the old Scottish capital offence of \\"leasing making\\" (i.e. libelling the king, his family, or court, with the intention of sowing dissension between the king and his subjects). Argyll was put in trial, on 12 December 1681, before Queensberry and four other judges. After Lockhart's defence the court adjourned; the question of fact was next day brought before a jury composed mainly of Argyll's enemies; Montrose, his hereditary foe, sat in court as chancellor. Argyll refused to defend himself. The jury acquitted him of perjury in receiving the oath in a false acceptation, and agreed with the judges on the other counts. Application was made to Charles for instructions by the council, and for justice by Argyll. Public opinion in both England and Scotland was outraged by Argyll's treatment, and blame was attached to the Duke of York in particular.Willcock, p. 277 George Savile, 1st Marquess of Halifax told Charles that in England they would not \\"hang a dog\\" on the pretext under which Argyll had been sentenced in Scotland.Willcock, p. 275 It was given out ‚Äì at least by pro-Royal sources ‚Äì that Charles and James were merely hoping to ensure Argyll was humbled and stripped of his judicial powers, rather than actually executed.Willcock, p. 265 Charles ordered that sentence of death should be pronounced but execution suspended at his pleasure. However, in the interim, Argyll ‚Äì unwilling to trust James not to actually execute the sentence ‚Äì escaped from prison (see below). On 22 December the king's letter reached the council; and, questionably, sentence of death as well as of forfeiture was pronounced in Argyll's absence on the 23rd. His estates were confiscated, and his hereditary jurisdictions assigned to Atholl. Escape and exile At the end of 1681 Argyll was in Edinburgh Castle, under expectation of imminent death. On 20 December, however, his stepdaughter Sophia Lindsay obtained leave to visit him; she brought with her a countryman as a page, dressed in a wig and with his head bound up as if he had been in a fight. He and Argyll exchanged clothes, and remarkably the ruse proved successful. Lindsay left the castle in floods of tears, accompanied by Argyll. Some of the guards almost discovered the disguise at the last minute, but were successfully distracted, and at the gate Argyll stepped up behind the coach. On reaching the custom-house he slipped quietly off, into one of the narrow wynds adjacent. He first went to the house of George Pringle of Torwoodlee, who had arranged for the escape, and by him was conducted to William Veitch, in Northumberland, who in turn brought him, travelling under the name \\"Mr. Hope\\", to London. In London Argyll was sheltered by Ann Smith, wife of a rich sugar-baker. He also found refuge with Major Abraham Holmes, who had arrested him in 1656‚Äì7. After a delay of some time Smith took him to her country house at Brentford. No real steps were taken to recapture him, and his subsequent movements are opaque. In 1682 he was supposed to be in Switzerland, but Arthur Forbes, 1st Earl of Granard received a message from him in London, and held a meeting with him. Charles II is also supposed to have been informed of his whereabouts, but refused to have him arrested, ostensibly for reasons of sympathy but perhaps also as arresting such a prominent Protestant would have been hugely unpopular. During this period Argyll seems to have begun associating with enemies of the Stuart regime, despite his earlier loyalism. He became a central figure in the clandestine Whig circles centred on the Earl of Shaftesbury. In the autumn of 1682 the government received information that he was involved in treasonable activities: efforts to locate him were renewed, and he fled to Holland, where many Whig exiles were gathering. Involvement in Rye House Plot In June 1683, Baillie of Jerviswood and a number of others were arrested after the discovery of the Rye House plot to assassinate Charles and his brother. Among their papers, letters from Argyll in cipher were found. The letters were sent to Scotland, and the countess was summoned in December 1683 to decipher them. She admitted that they were in Argyll's writing, but claimed she had burnt the only key she had. The cipher was, however, at length read by William Spence, Argyll's private secretary, and independently by two cryptographers, George Campbell and Gray of Crigie. Argyll, it appeared, had remonstrated with other Whig conspirators about their rejection of his proposal that he should be provided with ¬£30,000 and 1,000 English horse. They offered ¬£10,000 with 600 or 700 horse, the money to be paid by the beginning of July, and Argyll was then to go at once to Scotland and begin a revolt. He gave an account of the standing forces, militia, and heritors of Scotland, who would be obliged to appear for the king, to the number of 50,000. Half of them, he said, would not fight. He also said that his party needed only money and arms, and asked Holmes to communicate fully with his messenger from Holland. Holmes was himself arrested and examined on 28 June 1683, and from his replies it appeared that Argyll was then in London. In October Preston wrote from Paris, informing Halifax that Argyll had his agents in France, and added his belief that he had, after consultation with his friends in Holland, gone back to Scotland. On 28 and 29 June 1684 Spence was examined before the English privy council, but he said nothing against Argyll. In July he was sent to Scotland, and was tortured; but no more was learnt from him and he was eventually released. In September 1684 Argyll's charter chest and family papers were found concealed in a tenant's house in Argyllshire. Instructors at Benmore Outdoor Centre maintain that Scots law meant that the forfeit estates could not be transferred without the documents, which were supposedly concealed in the Paper Caves in the hillside adjacent to Loch Eck. The \\"Argyll expedition\\"=Planning While in Holland, Argyll had become associated with the Duke of Monmouth. On the news of Charles II's death and the accession of James VII as king, he moved from Friesland to Rotterdam, and was present at a meeting of Scots in Amsterdam on 17 April 1685, at which an immediate invasion of Scotland was decided on. Argyll made great efforts to convince Monmouth of the viability of a joint plan of invasion, claiming he could count on a large number of men from among his tenantry in Scotland,Willcock, p. 336 although he was among those who insisted that Monmouth should promise never to declare himself king. He funded the invasion preparations with ¬£7,000 given by his supporter Ann Smith, and ¬£1,000 from John Locke. Argyll sailed from the Vlie on 1 or 2 May 1685 with about 300 men in three small ships, accompanied by Sir Patrick Hume, Sir John Cochrane, Spence, and several other Scots exiles. Two English conspirators, John Ayloffe and Richard Rumbold, also went with Argyll. Monmouth had promised that he would start his own attempt, the Monmouth Rebellion, within a few days, though in the event he did not set sail for several weeks. Landing in Kintyre The expedition was dogged by bad luck and divisions amongst its leadership. They anchored off Orkney on 6 May: Spence went ashore to obtain a pilot, but was arrested, and the authorities were alerted to the invasion. Argyll sailed by The Minch towards the coast of his own country, but was compelled by contrary winds to go to the Sound of Mull. At Tobermory he was delayed three days, and then with three hundred men whom he picked up there he went across to Kintyre, a Covenanter stronghold. At Campbeltown Argyll issued a declaration: James had caused the death of Charles, Monmouth was the rightful heir, and that by him he had been restored to title and estates. He had previously sent his son Charles to raise his former tenants, who since his trial had officially held their tenancies from the King; but very few answered his summons. The rebels marched to Tarbet, where Argyll sent out a second declaration: he denied the statements of his enemies that he had come for private advantage, and promised to pay both his father's debts and his own. While he seems to have expected widespread support from the Covenanters and their sympathisers, many of the more militant Presbyterians had been angered by Argyll's involvement in the trial and execution of one of their leaders, Donald Cargill, and the majority of men who eventually joined the rebellion were Campbell clansmen. The government had also taken the precaution of stationing large numbers of soldiers and militia in those areas of the country thought to be most likely to be sympathetic to Argyll. At Tarbet Argyll was joined by Sir Duncan Campbell with a large body of men. An invasion of Lowland Scotland was settled on by a council of war, but Argyll demurred. At Bute he was detained for three days, and his forces then marched to Corval in Argyllshire. After a pointless raid on Greenock he moved off to Inveraray, but after the appearance of two English frigates compelled him to shelter under the castle of Eilean Gheirrig. He took Ardkinglass castle, but gave up on taking Inverary, and returned to Eilean Gheirrig. He then proposed to attack the frigates, but was frustrated by a mutiny among his men. The garrison of Eilan Gheirrig deserted, the king's ships took those of Argyll, with their cannon and ammunition as well as the castle, and Argyll's standard on which was written \\"For God and Religion, against Poperie, Tyrrannie, Arbitrary Government, and Erastianism\\". Attempted invasion of the Lowlands Argyll Stone (front), said to be where Argyll rested when captured.Argyll Stones, Renfrewshire Council, Retrieved 28 February 2018. In a poor situation Argyll took up the lowland enterprise. Near Dumbarton he encamped in an advantageous position in the face of the royal troops; but his proposal to fight was overruled, and the rebels retreated without any engagement towards Glasgow. It crossed to the south side of the River Clyde at Renfrew by Kirkpatrick ford, dwindling from two thousand to five hundred men; and after one or two skirmishes with the troops commanded by Rosse and William Cleland, Argyll found himself alone with his son John and three personal friends. To avoid pursuit they separated, only Major Fullarton remaining with Argyll. Having been refused shelter at the house of an old servant, the two crossed the Clyde to Inchinnan. On 18 June they were found by a group of militiamen. Argyll was said to have drawn his pistols to fire, but the powder had become damp in the river, and Argyll was struck over the head by one of his captors, a weaver. Heavily disguised in a countryman's bonnet and the full beard he had grown in exile, it was reported (probably apocryphally) that Argyll was only recognised when he cried \\"Alas, unfortunate Argyll!\\" as he fell, upon which the militiamen wept when they realised who they had captured, though they were too afraid not to hand him over to the authorities. He was led first to Renfrew and then to Glasgow. On 20 June he arrived at Edinburgh, taken to the castle and put in irons. He was questioned before the council as to his associates, and threatened with torture. While in prison he was visited by his sister, Lady Lothian, and by his wife, who, with Sophia Lindsay, had been placed in confinement on the first news of his landing. Death The Last Sleep of Argyle, Victorian history painting by Edward Matthew Ward, based on Robert Wodrow's story of Argyll being found sleeping soundly by an official bringing him for execution. On 30 June 1685 Argyll was executed, like his father, on the maiden in Edinburgh. He had spent much of his time in Holland preparing for a death he anticipated, and he faced his execution with fortitude and good humour. A story was repeated afterwards that an official who came to his room to bring him to execution found him sleeping peacefully, and was filled with remorse in the face of Argyll's calmness (though detractors claimed that following his 1658 head injury he had always had a similar sleep every day). To Sophia Lindsay he wrote:\\"what shall I say in this great day of the Lord, wherein, in the midst of a cloud, I find a fair sunshine. I can wish no more for you, but that the Lord may comfort you, and shine upon you as he doth upon me, and give you that same sense of His love in staying in the world, as I have in going out of it.\\"Willcock, A Scots Earl in Covenanting Times, p. 406 On the scaffold he gave a speech reiterating his opposition to \\"Popery\\", and finally joked that the guillotine, as his \\"inlet to glory\\" was \\"the sweetest maiden he had ever kissed\\".Willcock, p 421 He was first interred in Greyfriars Kirkyard and later reburied at Kilmun Parish Church. Character There are few personal descriptions of Argyll, and the polarized political landscape of the time lends itself to widely varying descriptions. John Lauder, Lord Fountainhall said that he was \\"witty in knacks\\" (i.e. clever in small inventions)Willcock, p. 16 and was \\"so conceitly\\" he had about twenty pockets in his coat and breeches. Lauderdale said that he had habits of winking his eye as he spoke and of holding his thumb in the palm of his hand, both of which were supposed to be \\"ill signs\\" prophetic of his violent fate. Argyll himself made reference to his own slight build and stature. Napier, the highly partisan pro-Jacobite historian, repeated several derogatory stories of Argyll's character and quoted John Leslie, 1st Duke of Rothes who said of Argyll that \\"\\"neither does either his person, or way of converse, recommend him\\".Napier, Memorials, v.1, p. 315 However, Argyll had, like his father, made many enemies in his lifetime, and other sources give a far more favourable impression of him. Airy noted that Argyll's correspondence on the death of his first wife was \\"touching\\", and Andrew Lang wrote that his unpublished private letters showed him to be a \\"man of singularly affectionate character and tender heart\\",Lang, A History of Scotland, v3, 1904, p. 407 adding that his conduct at his execution demonstrated great personal bravery.Lang, p. 406 Family On 13 May 1650, at the Canongate Kirk, he married Lady Mary Stewart, daughter of the 4th Earl of Moray, with whom he had seven children: *Archibald Campbell, 1st Duke of Argyll *John Campbell of Mamore, Commissioner for Argyllshire, and later MP for Dunbartonshire. *Charles Campbell, Commissioner for Campbeltown *James Campbell (c. 1660‚Äì1713?) *Mary Campbell, *Anne Campbell, married 1st Richard Maitland, 4th Earl of Lauderdale; 2nd, to Charles Stuart, 6th Earl of Moray *Jean Campbell, married William Kerr, 2nd Marquess of Lothian He married again, in 1670, the widow Lady Anne Mackenzie, Countess of Balcarres.

Physical Chemistry. Oxford University Press, 2014 and is equal to the sum of stoichiometric coefficients of reactants in this elementary reaction.Temkin, O. N. State-of-the-Art in the Theory of Kinetics of Complex Reactions. In Homogeneous Catalysis with Metal Complexes: Kinetic Aspects and Mechanisms, John Wiley and Sons, ltd, 2012 Depending on how many molecules come together, a reaction can be unimolecular, bimolecular or trimolecular. The kinetic order of any elementary reaction or reaction step is equal to its molecularity, and the rate equation of an elementary reaction can therefore be determined by inspection, from the molecularity. The kinetic order of a complex (multistep) reaction, however, cannot be equated to molecularity since molecularity only describes elementary reactions or steps.  Unimolecular reactions  In a unimolecular reaction, a single molecule rearranges atoms forming different molecules. This is illustrated by the equation :A -> P, where P means Product(s). The reaction or reaction step is an isomerization if there is only one product molecule, or a dissociation if there is more than one product molecule. In either case, the rate of the reaction or step is described by the first order rate law : \\\\frac{d \\\\left [ \\\\ce A \\\\right ]}{dt} = -k_r \\\\left [ \\\\ce A \\\\right ] \\\\ , where [A] is the concentration of species A, t is time, and kr is the reaction rate constant. As can be deduced from the rate law equation, the number of A molecules that decay is proportional to the number of A molecules available. An example of a unimolecular reaction, is the isomerization of cyclopropane to propene: center Unimolecular reactions can be explained by the Lindemann-Hinshelwood mechanism.  Bimolecular reactions  In a bimolecular reaction, two molecules collide and exchange energy, atoms or groups of atoms. This can be described by the equation :A + B -> P which corresponds to the second order rate law: \\\\frac {d[\\\\ce A]}{dt} = -k_r \\\\ce{[A][B]}. Here, the rate of the reaction is proportional to the rate at which the reactants come together. An example of a bimolecular reaction is the SN2-type nucleophilic substitution of methyl bromide by hydroxide ion:Morrison R.T. and Boyd R.N. Organic Chemistry (4th ed., Allyn and Bacon 1983) p.215 :CH3Br + OH^- -> CH3OH + Br^-  Termolecular reactions  A termolecularIUPAC Gold Book: Molecularity (or trimolecular)One textbook which mentions both termolecular and trimolecular as alternative names is J.W. Moore and R.G. Pearson, Kinetics and Mechanism (3rd ed., John Wiley 1981) p.17, reaction in solutions or gas mixtures involves three reactant molecules simultaneously colliding.J.I. Steinfeld, J.S. Francisco and W.L. Hase Chemical Kinetics and Dynamics (2nd ed., Prentice Hall 1999) p.5, However the term trimolecular is also used to refer to three body association reactions of the type :A + B ->[\\\\ce{M}] C Where the M over the arrow denotes that to conserve energy and momentum a second reaction with a third body is required. After the initial bimolecular collision of A and B an energetically excited reaction intermediate is formed, then, it collides with a M body, in a second bimolecular reaction, transferring the excess energy to it.Text discussing rate constants for termolecular reactions The reaction can be explained as two consecutive reactions: :\\\\ce{A + B -> AB}^* :\\\\ce{AB}^*\\\\ce{ + M -> C + M} These reactions frequently have a pressure and temperature dependence region of transition between second and third order kinetics.IUPAC definition of Troe expression, a semiempirical expression for the rate constant of termolecular reactions Catalytic reactions are often three-component, but in practice a complex of the starting materials is first formed and the rate-determining step is the reaction of this complex into products, not an adventitious collision between the two species and the catalyst. For example, in hydrogenation with a metal catalyst, molecular dihydrogen first dissociates onto the metal surface into hydrogen atoms bound to the surface, and it is these monatomic hydrogens that react with the starting material, also previously adsorbed onto the surface. Reactions of higher molecularity are not observed due to very small probability of simultaneous interaction between 4 or more moleculesCarr, R. W. Chemical Kinetics. In Encyclopedia of Applied Physics. WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co KGaA, 2003  Difference between molecularity and order of reaction  It is important to distinguish molecularity from order of reaction. The order of reaction is an empirical quantity determined by experiment from the rate law of the reaction. It is the sum of the exponents in the rate law equation.Rogers, D. W. Chemical Kinetics. In Concise Physical Chemistry, John Wiley and Sons, Inc. 2010. Molecularity, on the other hand, is deduced from the mechanism of an elementary reaction, and is used only in context of an elementary reaction. It is the number of molecules taking part in this reaction. This difference can be illustrated on the reaction between nitric oxide and hydrogen: :2NO + 2H2 -> N2 + 2H2O.Keith J. Laidler, Chemical Kinetics (3rd ed., Harper & Row 1987), p.277 The observed rate law is v = k\\\\ce{[NO]^2[H2]}, so that the reaction is third order. Since the order does not equal the sum of reactant stoichiometric coefficients, the reaction must involve more than one step. The proposed two- step mechanism has a rate-limiting first step whose molecularity corresponds to the overall order of 3: :2 NO + H2 -> N2 + H2O2 (slow) :H2O2 + H2 -> 2H2O (fast) On the other hand, the molecularity of this reaction is undefined, because it involves a mechanism of more than one step. However, we can consider the molecularity of the individual elementary reactions that make up this mechanism: the first step is termolecular because it involves three reactant molecules, while the second step is bimolecular because it involves two reactant molecules.

According to the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials route log, the bridge also carries U.S. Route 3 across the river to its southern terminus at U.S. Route 20 (also known as Commonwealth Avenue). However, the Massachusetts Department of Transportation does not consider the bridge to be a part of US 3; it continues the route along Memorial Drive in Cambridge until it meets Route 2A at the end of the Harvard Bridge. In 1949 it was renamed for Boston University, which lies at the southern end of the bridge, after a group of BU students went to the State House to propose a name change. State Senator John E. Powers sponsored the legislation and in May 1949 it passed with a unanimous vote. Contrary to popular belief, the bridge, with the Grand Junction Railroad Bridge directly underneath it, is not the only place in the world where a boat can sail under a train driving under a car driving under an airplane. Other such places include the Steel Bridge, in Portland, Oregon, and the 25 de Abril Bridge, in Lisbon, although on both those bridges are on the same span. In this case the rail and road traffic are on separate bridges. Looking towards Boston University from Cambridge. 1949 plaque designating the name \\"Boston University Bridge\\" to this structure. Construction The Boston University Bridge was designed by Andrew Canzanelli and built by The Phoenix Bridge Company in 1927, replacing an 1850s drawbridge known as the Brookline Bridge. Canzanelli also designed the Weeks footbridge and the first shell constructed on the Esplanade. Alt URL The bridge crosses diagonally over an older, now single-tracked railroad-only bridge carrying the Grand Junction Line. This bridge, formerly owned by CSX Transportation, was purchased by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts for the MBTA in 2010. The long-postponed Urban Ring mass transit project is expected to include a bridge at or near this location, to carry the planned route across the Charles River. During the period of planning for the Inner Belt, the BU Bridge represented the planned crossing point of the highway from Boston to Cambridge. Several plans were discussed for the area; had the expressway been built over the river, the bridge would have been demolished and replaced with a high-level highway overpass, while if the road had been built as a tunnel, the bridge would have been left standing as a crossing for surface route traffic.  Rehabilitation  In 2008, the bridge deck, including the sidewalks and vehicular surface, was in severe disrepair; the water below was visible through holes in the deck, and the iron stairs leading from Storrow Drive were rusted through. These deficiencies triggered the bridge to be categorized as \\"structurally deficient\\" under the federal NBIS standards. Nevertheless, the main structural elements of the bridge have been determined to be sound. The approximately $20 million rehabilitation project has been among the first undertaken in the Commonwealth's Accelerated Bridge Program by the bridge owner, the Department of Conservation and Recreation. In June 2008, one traffic lane and the west- side sidewalk was closed so that this work could begin. The project was done in 3 phases to keep traffic open throughout construction. The project was projected to wrap up in late November 2011. On December 21, 2011, the project was substantially complete and the bridge was opened in its final configuration, with one lane entering the bridge in each direction, transitioning on the bridge to two lanes exiting. Two 5-foot bike lines are provided alongside the sidewalks.http://www.massdot.state.ma.us/charlesriverbridges/BostonUniversityBridge.aspx The view of Boston from the bridge See also  * List of crossings of the Charles River NotesReferencesExternal links * * Category:Bridges in Boston Category:Bridges completed in 1928 Category:Buildings and structures in Cambridge, Massachusetts Category:Bridges in Middlesex County, Massachusetts Category:Road bridges in Massachusetts Category:Steel bridges in the United States Category:Truss bridges in the United States Category:1928 establishments in Massachusetts Category:Bridges over the Charles River Category:Through arch bridges in the United States Category:Tied arch bridges in the United States ","title":"Boston University Bridge"},{"id":"1868544","text":"MTR Gaming Group was a gaming company based in Chester, West Virginia that operated horse racing tracks and racinos.

YM got its start as two magazines in the 1930s‚ÄîCompact, which was aimed at older teens, and Calling All Girls, which was intended for younger girls and pioneered the signature embarrassing-moments column, \\"Say Anything\\". By the late 1960s, the publications merged into Young Miss, a small digest-sized mag. The 1980s saw a change in size to a regular magazine on glossy print (similar to 'Teen) designed by Mark Borden. Several years later, still another title change (this time to Young & Modern) under Bonnie Fuller's direction as editor-in-chief. The final title change came in 2000 (this time to Your Magazine), though the abbreviation \\"YM\\" was the title by which it was commonly referred. In early 2002, then editor-in-chief Christina Kelly announced that the magazine would no longer run articles about dieting. YM ceased publication in 2004, with the December‚ÄìJanuary issue. Subscribers received Teen Vogue subscriptions in replacement. The television series Pepper Ann was based on a comic strip by Sue Rose that debuted in YM. YM is no longer published online and now the domain is only a link to Teen Vogue. However, the forums on the YM website remained very active following the end of the magazine. After the website finally closed, the forum members moved their boards onto another domain.

From parallax measurements taken during the Hipparcos mission it is about from the Sun. It has a combined apparent visual magnitude of 3.89, bright enough to be seen with the naked eye in dark skies. The system consists of a binary pair designated Eta Virginis A together with a third companion, Eta Virginis B. A's two components are themselves designated Eta Virginis Aa (officially named Zaniah , the traditional name of the system) and Ab. Nomenclature Œ∑ Virginis (Latinised to Eta Virginis) is the system's Bayer designation. The designations of the two constituents as Eta Virginis A and those of A'scomponents - Eta Virginis Aa and Ab - derive from the convention used by the Washington Multiplicity Catalog (WMC) for multiple star systems, and adopted by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). It bore the traditional name Zaniah , derived from the Arabic ÿ≤ÿßŸàŸäÿ© zƒÅwiyah \\"corner\\", the same source as Zavijava (Beta Virginis). In 2016, the IAU organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalogue and standardize proper names for stars.

The inner pair is a spectroscopic binary that completes an orbit in 72 days. The inclination of this orbit was determined through interferometer observations to be 45.5¬∞, allowing the masses of the two stars to be estimated. The primary star, Eta Virginis Aa, has a mass about 2.5 times the Sun's mass, while the secondary, Eta Virginis Ab, has 1.9 solar masses. The faint tertiary star, Eta Virginis B, orbits the inner group in a wider orbit over a period of 13.1 years. Eta Virginis is 1.97 degrees north of the ecliptic, so it can be occulted by the Moon and (rarely) by planets. On October 12, 272 BC the ancient Greek astronomer Timocharis observed a conjunction of the star with Venus. The last occultation by a planet took place on September 27, 1843, also by Venus, which will occult it again on November 19, 2445. Two degrees north-following of Eta Virginis is SS Virginis, a typical Cool Carbon Star and one of the most red colored stars in the equatorial sky.

He graduated from the University of Nevada, Reno in 1961 with a degree in mechanical engineering and was a part of the design team responsible for the Apollo spacecraft heat shield.  Career  Ron Toomer was hired by Arrow Development founders Karl Bacon and Ed Morgan in 1965 to help design a mine train ride called Run-A-Way Mine Train at Six Flags Over Texas. It opened in 1966 utilizing the tubular steel rail technology that had been developed by Arrow for Disneyland's Matterhorn Bobsleds. The concept caught on quickly and Toomer designed 15 more mine train coasters for Arrow. All but one are still operating today. Following almost four years of development, Toomer introduced the modern looping roller coaster in 1975 with the opening of Corkscrew, the first in the world with two inversions, at Knott's Berry Farm. Knott's is credited with having the first, but three more identical coasters opened later that same year. The following year he introduced the familiar Arrow teardrop-shaped vertical loop on a custom corkscrew coaster at Cedar Point amusement park in Sandusky, Ohio. At Cedar Point in 1989, Toomer unveiled the first roller coaster to top known as Magnum XL-200. In 1981, Arrow Development was purchased by Huss Maschinenfabrik, which merged with Arrow Development to form Arrow-Huss. Toomer was made vice president and manager of engineering. In 1986, 13 of the company's American officers negotiated a buyout, and formed Arrow Dynamics to which Toomer was named president. In 1993 he was promoted to chairman of the board then became a consulting director in 1995. Toomer retired from Arrow Dynamics in 1998. Although Toomer primarily designed coasters for Arrow, he also assisted with some of the other Arrow products, which included providing structural engineering for the company's Log Flumes. A common misconception is that Ron Toomer never rode any of his rides. Although he did suffer from motion sickness, he would ride a coaster once, maybe twice. He was quoted as saying \\"I've ridden enough to know what they are like.\\" Notable designs Ron Toomer's designs were highly innovative with many of his coasters breaking records. Notable designs include: * Runaway Mine Train (Six Flags Over Texas), first mine train type coaster. * Roaring 20's Corkscrew, (Knott's Berry Farm), first coaster with two inversions. * Corkscrew (Cedar Point), first with three inversions. * Carolina Cyclone (Carowinds), first with four inversions. * Viper (Darien Lake), first with five inversions. * Vortex (Kings Island), first with six inversions. * Shockwave (Six Flags Great America), first with seven inversions. * Motorcycle Chase (Knott's Berry Farm), first modern-day steeplechase coaster. * Loch Ness Monster (Busch Gardens Williamsburg), first with interlocking vertical loops. * Orient Express (Worlds of Fun), introduced the Arrow Boomerang Element, originally called a Kamikaze Curve. * The Bat (Kings Island), prototype suspended coaster, although not the first suspended, it was the first in an amusement park. * Gemini (Cedar Point), only Arrow racing coaster, record breaking height when opened. * Magnum XL-200 (Cedar Point), first to exceed 200 feet. * The Pepsi Max Big One (Blackpool Pleasure Beach), opened as the world's tallest and steepest coaster. Awards In 2000 Ron Toomer was inducted into the IAAPA Hall of Fame as a Living Legend. Four of Toomer's coasters have been designated Roller Coaster Landmarks by American Coaster Enthusiasts: Corkscrew, Loch Ness Monster, Magnum XL-200 and Run-A-Way Mine Train.

Acidification, which gives the milk a tart taste, is achieved either through bacterial fermentation or through the addition of an acid, such as lemon juice or vinegar. The acid causes milk to coagulate and thicken, inhibiting the growth of harmful bacteria and improving the product's shelf life. Soured milk that is produced by bacterial fermentation is more specifically called fermented milk or cultured milk. Traditionally, soured milk was simply fresh milk that was left to ferment and sour by keeping it in a warm place for a day, often near a stove. Modern commercial soured milk may differ from milk that has become sour naturally. Soured milk that is produced by the addition of an acid, with or without the addition of microbial organisms, is more specifically called acidified milk. In the United States, acids used to manufacture acidified milk include acetic acid (commonly found in vinegar), adipic acid, citric acid (commonly found in lemon juice), fumaric acid, glucono-delta-lactone, hydrochloric acid, lactic acid, malic acid, phosphoric acid, succinic acid, and tartaric acid. Soured milk is commonly made at home or is sold and consumed in Europe, especially in Eastern Europe (Bulgaria, Belarus, Poland, Slovakia, Russia, Ukraine), all over the countries of the former Yugoslavia (Macedonia, Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Slovenia), Romania, Hungary, Greece, Finland, Germany, and Scandinavia. It is also made at home or sold in supermarkets and consumed in the Great Lakes region of Somalia and Eastern Africa (Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi and Tanzania). It is also a traditional food of the Bantu people of Southern Africa. Since the 1970s, some producers have used chemical acidification in place of biological agents.  In recipes  Raw milk that has not gone sour is sometimes referred to as \\"sweet milk\\", because it contains the sugar lactose. Fermentation converts the lactose to lactic acid, which has a sour flavor. Before the invention of refrigeration, raw milk commonly became sour before it could be consumed, and various recipes incorporate such leftover milk as an ingredient. Sour milk produced by fermentation differs in flavor from that produced by acidification, because the acids commonly added in commercial manufacture have different flavors from lactic acid, and also because fermentation can introduce new flavors. Buttermilk is a common modern substitute for naturally soured milk.

Titles in the series include Sideways Stories from Wayside School (1978), Wayside School is Falling Down (1989), Wayside School Gets A Little Stranger (1995), and Wayside School Beneath the Cloud of Doom (2020). The books tell the stories of a school built 30 floors high, with one classroom on each floor, but without a 19th floor. Sachar released two spinoff books of mathematics and puzzles interspersed with stories: Sideways Arithmetic from Wayside School (1989) and More Sideways Arithmetic from Wayside School (1994). A television special loosely based on the books Wayside: The Movie aired in 2005, and was followed-up by the Wayside animated series that originally ran from 2007 to 2008. Background While a student at University of California, Berkeley, author Louis Sachar began working at an elementary school to earn college credit.\\"Author Bio\\", Louis Sachar's Official Web Site, 2005. Retrieved 2007-07-14. Sachar later recalled, Sachar graduated from UC Berkeley in 1976 with a degree in Economics, and began working on Sideways Stories From Wayside School, a children's book set at an elementary school with supernatural elements. Although the book's students were named after children from Hillside and there is a presumably autobiographical character named \\"Louis the Yard Teacher,\\" Sachar has said that he draws very little from personal experience, explaining that \\"....my personal experiences are kind of boring. I have to make up what I put in my books.\\"\\"Louis Sachar Interview Transcript\\", Scholastic.com, 2006-02-23. Retrieved 2007-07-18. Characters The Wayside School books take place on the thirtieth story of Wayside School, which is taught by Mrs. Jewls, a nice teacher with occasionally impractical teaching methods. She is the replacement for the old teacher, Mrs. Gorf, who was an evil teacher who could wiggle her ears and stick out her tongue to turn the students into apples. The third book introduces her son, Mr. Gorf, who could steal voices through a third nostril, alongside Mrs. Drazil, Louis's old teacher who remembers students that forgot homework assignments from decades ago, and Ms. Wendy Nogard, who could read thoughts with a third ear on the top of her head. The thirtieth story has had thirty students taught throughout the course of the books, such as Todd, an unfavored student of Mrs. Jewls who she sends home on the kindergarten bus after slight misdemeanors; Maurecia, a sweet and sensitive girl who loves ice cream; Dana, a girl with glasses who has a tendency to be overemotional; and Myron, a trustworthy and loyal student who was class president for one day. Other students include John, who could only read upside-down until his brain got flipped; Joe, a boy with several curly hairs who can't count right; Stephen, a boy who frequently shows up to class in silly outfits; Jenny, a girl who is often late to school and has to get there on a motorcycle; Bebe, a girl who can produce art very quickly, but is shown to be a bit troublesome in class; Rondi, a girl who is often recognized for the front teeth she doesn't have until she gets them in the second book; and Leslie, a girl with long pigtails that are often pulled by Paul, an inattentive boy who loves pulling pigtails. There are also the Three Erics, consisting of Eric Fry, the most athletic Eric who is often called \\"Butterfingers\\" since the other Erics aren‚Äôt athletic; Eric Bacon, the skinniest Eric who is often called \\"Fatso\\" since the other Erics are fat; and Eric Ovens, the nicest Eric who is usually called \\"Crabapple\\" since the other Erics are typically pretty negative. Sharie is a girl who wears a large coat and frequently falls asleep in class, but is respected since Mrs. Jewls believes she learns best that way; Deedee is a girl who likes sports but is always stuck with the lame yellow ball, which doesn't bounce and always goes the opposite way of where the person kicks it. Also in the books are Allison, a girl who typically tries to assert dominance, even over her friends; D.J., a boy who usually smiles, even without reason; Dameon, a boy with a crush on Mrs. Jewls who often is sent running up and down the thirty flights of stairs at Wayside; Joy, a tomboyish kleptomaniac who usually targets Todd or Dameon; Jason, a boy with a big mouth who always gets in bad situations; Kathy, a girl who is mean to all the other students; Terrence, a school bully who rarely shares and usually kicks the balls over the fence; Mac, a boy who once was named Nancy and now tells long stories in class; Ron, a boy with weak feet who loves to play kickball; and Calvin, a slow-paced student who is Bebe's art assistant. Three new students were introduced throughout the course of the series, the first being Sammy, who first appeared in Sideways Stories from Wayside School, who was revealed to be a dead rat bundled in raincoats by the end of the chapter. The second was Sue, who only appeared in the spin-off books, a normal girl who transferred to Wayside, only to be confused by the school's bizarre teaching methods. The third and final was Benjamin Nushmutt, introduced in Wayside School is Falling Down, being a boy who everyone believed was named Mark Miller up until the twenty-ninth chapter of the book. Other members of the school staff include Louis, a character based on Louis Sachar himself, being the school's yard teacher with a mustache of many colors who is friends with all the kids; Miss Mush, the school's cafeteria lady whose meals are so horrible, students rarely dare to eat them, as well as her assistant, Mr. Pepperadder, who only appears in the math spin-offs, being a person who is often pranked by Miss Mush because he is shorter than her. Mr. Kidswatter is the school principal, who hates all the kids and often overreacts when things don't go his way. Dr. Pickell is the school counselor, who uses hypnosis on the students to cure their ailments but also adds strange side effects. Miss Zarves is the teacher of the nineteenth story, which doesn't exist, and four kids named Ray, Virginia, Nick, and Mark. She and her students supposedly do not exist either. There is also Miss Worm, the teacher of the honors class story who is annoyed by Mrs. Jewls's teaching methods. A few one-off characters include Mrs. Waloosh, the eccentric dance teacher at the school; Mrs. Franklin, a substitute from the second book that believed all the students were named Benjamin; Mrs. Day, the school secretary; and David, Mr. Kidswatter's chauffeur. A few more characters include Hobo Bob, a hobo who hates socks brought in by Sharie for show-and-tell; Xavier Dalton, a man who made Ms. Nogard bitter and hateful after being disgusted by her third ear; Mr. Finch, a man who saved up his life savings to start an ice cream company; and the numerous cows, one of which ended up on the nineteenth story, that came to the school leading to it being shut down for 243 days. Story conventions *In Sideways Arithmetic From Wayside School, it is revealed the characters add, subtract, and multiply words. The children at Wayside School have no concept of adding numbers until Mrs. Jewls teaches the kids 4+7=11, in numbers, not words. *If a student does something wrong once, Mrs. Jewls will write that student's name under the word DISCIPLINE. If a student does something wrong a second time, Mrs. Jewls will put a check next to that student's name. If a student does something wrong a third time, Mrs. Jewls will circle his/her name and send him/her home at noon on the kindergarten bus. Despite only needing three strikes, Mrs. Jewls resorts to also adding a triangle when Sammy was disruptive. Despite being a good student, Todd is sent home every day on the kindergarten bus as a result of him always unfairly getting in trouble each day. Paul is also sent home on the kindergarten bus, but only once, after pulling Leslie's pigtails during class. Another time, when it looks like Joy was going to be sent home early, Todd thinks he is going to have company, but Joy ends up making up for her crime by kissing Jason on the nose so that he would come unstuck from the gum she put on his seat. Mrs. Jewls even sends herself home early for temporarily turning evil. *Goozack was another word for the door in the book Wayside School Gets a Little Stranger. After the principal ran into his office door and spilled coffee over his clothes, he said that the word \\"door\\" was a bad word. Anyone who said \\"door\\" would get in trouble. So he introduced the word \\"goozack\\" to replace the word door. Todd was the first student to break the new rule, only because he was late for school at the time and didn't hear the announcement. Later, when Mrs. Drazil said \\"door\\" and the students pointed out that she was to call it \\"goozack,\\" she immediately said \\"Mr. Kidswatter is a 'goozack'\\" in retaliation. *The last sentence of each book always rhymes. In the first book, it says \\"everybody booed,\\" after Louis tells them a bad story about a regular school. The second book ends in \\"everybody mooed,\\" after Louis asks the cows in the building to leave. The third book ends in \\"everybody oooohed,\\" after Louis kisses Miss Nogard. The fourth book ends in \\"everybody chewed,\\" as the students chew Miss Mush's rainbow stew to taste the colors. Other media In 2005, Nelvana produced an hour-long television special loosely based on the books called Wayside: The Movie. The special was later spun off into a series titled Wayside, which aired on Nickelodeon (U.S.) and Teletoon (Canada) from 2007 to 2008. References Sachar, Louis. Sideways Stories from Wayside School.

The awards ceremony, presenting Emmys from the previous calendar year, is usually held on a Spring Monday night, sometime in the last two weeks in April or the first week in May. The Sports Emmy Awards are all given away at one ceremony, unlike the Primetime Emmy Awards and the Daytime Emmy Awards, which hold a \\"Creative Arts\\" ceremony in which Emmys are given to behind-the-scenes personnel. History The first Emmy for \\"Best Sports Coverage\\" was handed out at the second annual Primetime Emmy Awards ceremony in 1950, where KTLA, a local television station in Los Angeles, won the award for coverage of wrestling. The following year, another Los Angeles-based station, KNBH, won an Emmy for their coverage of the Los Angeles Rams American football team. At the seventh Primetime Emmys in 1955, NBC became the first major network to win a Sports Emmy Award for its series, the Gillette Cavalcade of Sports. In 1979, an Emmys exclusively for sports coverage was held for the first time at the Rainbow Room in New York City. Winners included golf announcer Jack Whitaker, and CBS's The NFL Today. The ninth annual Sports Emmy Awards, hosted by actors Alan Thicke and Joan Van Ark and held on July 13, 1988, became the first Sports Emmys ceremony to be televised; the live telecast was syndicated nationwide by Raycom Sports. Dennis Miller hosted in the 12th Sports Emmys in 1991, which was broadcast on ESPN. Rules Among the Sports Emmy rules, a show must originally air on American television during the eligibility period between January 1 and December 31, and to at least 50 percent of the country. A show that enters into the Sports Emmys cannot also be entered into any other national Emmy competition. Certain shows and segments that air on sports networks that are more entertainment or news, including award shows, the opening and closing ceremonies of the Olympics, and the Super Bowl halftime show, are ineligible for the Sports Emmys. Entries must be submitted by mid-January. Most award categories also require entries to include DVDs or tape masters of the show. For most program categories, the submitted DVDs should feature up to five excerpts. For most personality categories, there is no limit in the number of segments submitted, but the DVD should not run over a total of 12 minutes. Voting is done by peer judging panels between February and early March. The Academy solicits anybody with significant experience in national sports production to serve as judges. The panels are organized so that they only have one representative from each corporate entity (i.e. CBS Corporation, Disney, NBCUniversal, News Corporation, Time Warner etc.) Most categories only have a single voting round using preferential scoring system. The top 5 entries in each category are announced as the \\"nominations\\", and then the top entry is announced as the Emmy winner later at the awards ceremony. When a show wins a Sports Emmy, each member of the crew that worked on the production is eligible to purchase an Emmy statue, provided that their job title corresponds to the category that the show won the award in. This policy can result in many different people \\"winning\\" an Emmy for a single production; for example, when the Olympics on NBC wins an award for Outstanding Technical Team (Remote), as often occurs, the hundreds of personnel working on the production all have the right to purchase an Emmy statue. Depending on the production, the show or network that won the award will sometimes pay for the purchase of statues for the entire crew. Categories At that inaugural ceremony in 1979, there were 12 categories.

The music was composed by the Czech musician Jarom√≠r Vejvoda in 1927.Greene, Victor. A Passion for Polka: Old-Time Ethnic Music in America. University of California Press, 1992, p. 131. Eduard Ingri≈° wrote the first arrangement of the piece, after Vejvoda came upon the melody and sought Ingri≈°'s help in refining it. At that time, it was played without lyrics as \\"Mod≈ôansk√° polka\\" (\\"Polka of Mod≈ôany\\"). Its first text was written later (in 1934) by V√°clav Zeman ‚Äì with the title \\"≈†koda l√°sky\\"Greene 1992, p. 131. (\\"Wasted Love\\"). The polka became famous around the world. In June 1939, \\"Beer Barrel Polka\\", as recorded by Will Glah√©, was number one on the Hit Parade. This version was distributed by Shapiro Bernstein. Glah√©'s earlier 1934 recording sold many copies in its German version Rosamunde (it is possible the reason for the rapid spread was due to the occupation of Czechoslovakia by Nazi Germany, and subsequent emigration of thousands of Czechs to other parts of the world, bringing this catchy tune with them). The authors of the English lyrics were Lew Brown and Wladimir Timm. Meanwhile, the song was recorded and played by many others such as The Andrews Sisters in 1939, the Glenn Miller Orchestra, Benny Goodman, Bobby Vinton, Billie Holiday, and Joe Patek who sold over a million copies of his album \\"Beer Barrel Polka.\\" During World War II, versions in many other languages were created and the song was popular among soldiers, regardless of their allegiances. On VE Day, 9 May 1945, Humphrey Lyttelton played it standing on a handcart outside Buckingham Palace, a performance that could be heard in the BBC broadcast from the victory celebrations. It was claimed many times that the song was written in the country where it had just become a hit. Its actual composer was not widely known until after the war. Names in other languages Covers and homages = Music  * Bobby Vinton recorded \\"Beer Barrel Polka\\" in 1975. The song was released as the follow up single to his multi-million selling \\"My Melody of Love\\" and reached number 33 on the Billboard, number 45 on the Cashbox Top 40 hit charts and number 51 in Australia. The success of the single, which was particularly popular on jukeboxes, led to its inclusion on Vinton's Heart of Hearts album in 1975. * The song became a signature song of well-known entertainer Liberace. * A parodic version in 1940 is used as despedida (closure) for Uruguayan murga performers L√≠nea Maginot. * Elton John was known to play this particular song at the Northwood Hills Pub, along with \\"King of the Road.\\" * Brave Combo and Jimmy Sturr & His Orchestra made their own compositions of \\"Beer Barrel Polka\\". * The song is a standard for the accordion rock band Those Darn Accordions, who released a studio version in 1992 on their album Vongole Fisarmonica. * The Wiggles sang this song on their 2005 album and video Sailing Around the World. * John Serry Sr. arranged and recorded the polka for accordion and ensemble for RCA Thesaurus (1954).  Sports  * Since the 1970s, it (usually the Frankie Yankovic version) has been played during the seventh inning stretch at Milwaukee Brewers baseball games, as well as becoming one of the state of Wisconsin's unofficial state songs as it is also played at numerous University of Wisconsin sporting events, as well as Green Bay Packers home games, and Milwaukee Bucks basketball games, including after every home win. * The 2016 Premiership winning Australian National Rugby League club Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks use the tune of Beer Barrel Polka for their victory song Up Up Cronulla. * At San Jose Giants home games, a batter from the opposing team is designated the \\"beer batter.\\" If the San Jose pitcher strikes out that batter, beer is half price in the beer only lines for the 15 minutes immediately following the strike out. The beer batter promotion is in effect only for the first six innings of the game. The PA system plays Beer Barrel Polka whenever the beer batter comes to the plate and after every strike during the beer batter's at-bat (through the first six innings). After the sixth inning, the beer batter becomes the apple juice batter and if he strikes out, fans get half-priced Martinelli's apple juice. * Pro wrestler Crusher Lisowski used the song as his entrance music, and would often growl out a few bars of it during interviews. * The German football club Bayern M√ºnchen use the tune of Beer Barrel Polka for their song FC Bayern, lala lalala lala.S√ºdkurve M√ºnchen Lieder * The Italian football club Padova use the tune of Beer Barrel Polka for their goliardia song Dolce fiasco (Sweet flagon).  Plays and movies  * Arthur Miller's play Death of a Salesman features a recording of a young girl whistling this song. * An instrumental version is featured in the 1941 film Meet John Doe. * In the 1946 movie The Captive Heart, the song was sung by the POWs to drown out the camp speakers and by the repatriated troops as they arrive home. * In 2005 the tune of \\"Beer Barrel Polka\\" became the main inspiration for the theme tune for Marvel Comics's The Fantastic Four movie and can be heard throughout. * An instrumental version is featured in the 1985 Argentine film Esperando la carroza. * Chico Marx of the Marx Brothers plays a variation of this song in the movie At the Circus and A Night in Casablanca. * In the Disney movie The North Avenue Irregulars, a scene features a tape recorder playing The Andrews Sisters' version of the song while Patsy Kelly, Barbara Harris, and Virginia Capers sing along with it.  Television  * It is sung in the final scene of the Rumpole of the Bailey television episode, \\"Rumpole and the Alternative Society\\" (1977). * In an episode of Mr. Bean: The Animated Series, the Queen of England sings a portion of the song with a piano accompaniment. * In an episode of The Critic, a trained bear plays the song for Jay Sherman, the critic, trying to stay a part of his show. * It was played by Amanda McBroom as Eleanor Carlyle on piano at officers' club in M*A*S*H season 9 episode 20 (second part of \\"That's Show Biz\\") after she says that \\"Even Dvorak and Brahms wrote folk dances\\" to Major Winchester. * In the Hogan's Heroes season 1 episode \\"Papa Schultz - Top Hat, White Tie and Bomb Sights\\", Colonel Hogan convinces the Luftwaffe that he knows the details of the Norden Bombsight and has pro-Nazi leanings. To firm up the subterfuge, Colonel Hogan describes a vacuum cleaner named \\"The Norden\\" in front of a wiretap with the prisoner crew singing \\"Beer Barrel Polka\\" loudly, interrupting lines of dialog. Commandant Klink believes the performance because the various details not covered up by singing appear to describe a bombsight. * In the Family Matters episode, \\"Chick-a-Boom\\", Steve Urkel creates a powder that explodes up when the song \\"Roll Out the Barrel\\" is played. * In the Frasier episode, \\"Where Every Bloke Knows Your Name\\", Frasier Crane and his new friends sing \\"Roll Out the Barrel\\" in a British-style pub as a frustrated, and bewildered Daphne Moon looks on.  Comics  * In the Girl Genius comic and webcomic, the titular inventor Agatha Heterodyne creates a fleet of defensive robots from carnival wagons and one from a barrel; that robot plays the polka while wielding a pair of axes.

The flight, which had originated at Idlewild International Airport (now John F. Kennedy International Airport), crashed on approach to Zaventem Airport, Brussels, killing all 72 people on board and one person on the ground. The fatalities included the entire U.S. Figure Skating team, who were travelling to the World Figure Skating Championships in Prague, Czechoslovakia. The precise cause of the crash remains a mystery; the most likely explanation was thought to be a failure of the tail stabilizer-adjusting mechanism. This was the first fatal accident involving a Boeing 707 in regular passenger service; it happened 28 months after the 707 airliner was placed into commercial use. It remains the deadliest plane crash ever to occur on Belgian soil. Accident There were eleven crew members on board the ill-fated flight. The two pilots, Louis Lambrechts and Jean Roy, were both experienced ex-army pilots. There were no difficulties reported during the seven and a half hour trans-Atlantic flight from New York; there was no indication that the plane was in any particular trouble, although the flight crew did lose radio contact with Brussels airport about twenty minutes before coming in to land. Under clear skies, at about 10:00 Brussels time (CET; 09:00 UTC), the Boeing 707 was on a long approach to Runway 20 when, near the runway threshold and at a height of , power was increased and the landing gear retracted. The airplane had been forced to cancel its final approach to Brussels airport, as a small plane had not yet cleared the runway. The 707 circled the airport and made another attempt to land on adjoining Runway 25, which was not operational; this second approach was also aborted. It became clear to observers that the pilots were fighting for control of the aircraft, making a desperate attempt to land despite the fact that a mechanical malfunction was preventing them from making a normal landing. The plane circled the airfield three times altogether, during which the bank angle gradually increased until the aircraft had climbed to and was in a near vertical bank. It then leveled its wings, pitched up abruptly, lost speed and spiralled rapidly nose down, plunging into the ground less than two miles (3 km) from the airport, at 10:05 CET (09:05 UTC). A Sabena Boeing 707-329 aircraft, pictured in April 1960 The location of the crash was a marshy area adjacent to farmland near Berg (then an independent municipality, nowadays part of Kampenhout), four miles northeast of Brussels. Eyewitnesses said that the plane exploded when it hit the ground and heavy black smoke was seen coming from the wreckage which had burst into flames. Theo de Laet, a young farmer and noted amateur cyclist, who was working in a field near to the crash site, was killed by a piece of aluminum shrapnel from the plane. Another field worker, Marcel Lauwers, was also hit by flying debris which amputated part of his leg. Father Joseph Cuyt, a local priest who had been observing the airplane as it came in to land, rushed to the scene but was driven back by the intense heat of the fire. Airport rescue vehicles arrived at the crash site almost immediately but the plane was already a blazing bonfire. It is believed that all 72 occupants of the plane were killed instantly on impact. Baudouin I, King of the Belgians, and his consort, Queen Fabiola, travelled to the scene of the disaster to provide comfort to the bereaved families. They donated oak coffins bearing the royal seal to transport the bodies back home. Loss of U.S. Figure Skating team All eighteen members of the 1961 U.S. Figure Skating team lost their lives, as well as sixteen other people who were accompanying them, including family members, professional coaches, and skating officials. Among the fatalities were nine-times U.S. ladies' champion, turned coach, Maribel Vinson-Owen and her two daughters: reigning U.S. ladies' champion Laurence Owen, aged sixteen, and her 20-year-old sister, reigning U.S. pairs champion Maribel Owen, both of whom had won gold medals at the 1961 U.S. Figure Skating Championships in Colorado Springs just two weeks earlier. Laurence Owen was the cover story for the February 13 issue of Sports Illustrated, just two days before her untimely death. Maribel Owen's pairs champion partner Dudley \\"Dud\\" Richards and reigning U.S. men's champion Bradley Lord were also killed, along with U.S. ice dance champions Diane \\"Dee Dee\\" Sherbloom and Larry Pierce. The team also lost U.S. men's silver medalist Gregory Kelley, U.S. ladies' silver medalist Stephanie \\"Steffi\\" Westerfeld, and U.S. ladies' bronze medalist Rhode Lee Michelson. Despite the fact that some national teams had already arrived in Prague for the World Championships‚Äîwhich were scheduled to start on February 22‚Äîthe devastating loss of the U.S. team forced the event to be canceled. The competition organizers in Prague initially confirmed that the event would go ahead, but the International Skating Union (ISU) conducted a poll to agree on the most appropriate course of action; the vote, which took place on February 16, went in favor of cancelation out of respect for the U.S. team. A telegram was sent from ISU headquarters which read: \\"In view of the tragic death of 44 [sic] American skaters and officials the 1961 world championship will not be held.\\" Prague was given the chance to host the event the following year. Aftermath The figure skating team was mourned across the U.S. and all of the national newspapers carried the story on their front pages. In office for less than a month, President John F. Kennedy issued a statement of condolence from the White House, which read: \\"Our country has sustained a great loss of talent and grace which had brought pleasure to people all over the world. Mrs. Kennedy and I extend our deepest sympathy to the families and friends of all the passengers and crew who died in this crash.\\" He was particularly affected by the tragedy; pairs skater Dudley Richards was a personal friend of the president and his brother Ted, and they had spent summers together in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts. The disaster struck a severe blow to the U.S. Figure Skating program, which had dominated the sport throughout the 1950s. Frank Shumway, who had only very recently become vice president of U.S. Figure Skating, predicted that it would take up to four years for the U.S. to regain its world prominence in the sport. Barbara Roles, the 1960 Olympic bronze medalist, felt obligated to come out of retirement, and won a gold medal at the 1962 U.S. Championships less than eight months after giving birth to her first child. At the same time, some of the younger American figure skaters progressed more quickly due to the lack of senior skaters competing in the field. Scott Allen won a silver medal at the 1962 U.S. Championships when he was just twelve years old, and then won bronze at the 1964 Winter Olympics the week of his fifteenth birthday, becoming one of the youngest Olympic medalists in history. It was not until 1965 that the U.S. started to win medals at the World Championships again; and the U.S. did not regain international prominence in figure skating until the 1968 Winter Olympics when Peggy Fleming won gold in the ladies' event and Tim Wood won silver in the men's. As the fatalities included many top American coaches as well as the skating team, the tragedy was also indirectly responsible for bringing foreign coaches to the U.S. to fill the vacuum that was left behind. U.S. Figure Skating team coach, William Kipp, who was one of those who died on the Brussels flight, was eventually replaced by British former world champion pairs skater John Nicks in the fall of 1961. Italian world bronze medalist Carlo Fassi was another international coach who relocated from overseas to help rebuild the U.S. Figure Skating program. The disaster prompted U.S. Figure Skating executives to issue a mandate that still applies today: No team traveling to an international competition would ever be allowed to fly together again. Investigation The Belgian Government immediately ordered a full inquiry into the cause of the accident, and an investigation was conducted by the Belgian National authorities, the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), who spent several months combing through the evidence. There was much speculation about what may have happened; the FBI even reportedly considered the possibility of terrorism. The exact cause of the crash was never fully determined, but the authorities eventually agreed that the most likely explanation was a mechanical failure of one of the flight control mechanisms, probably a malfunction of either the wing spoilers or the tail stabilizers. Although there was insufficient evidence to prove beyond reasonable doubt which of the flight systems had malfunctioned, the FAA were of the opinion that the tail stabilizer-adjusting mechanism had failed, allowing the stabilizer to run to the \\"10.5deg nose-up position\\". Notable victims There were 34 members of the U.S. Figure Skating delegation on board the fatal flight‚Äîalmost half the plane's occupants‚Äîall heading for the 1961 World Figure Skating Championships in Prague. The eighteen figure skaters were accompanied by six coaches, the team manager, two judges, one referee, and six family members. The notable victims are listed below. ;Ladies *Rhode Lee Michelson (age 17), 1961 U.S. bronze medalist *Laurence Rochon Owen (age 16), 1961 U.S. and North American champion, 1960 Olympic and World team member *Stephanie Westerfeld (age 17), 1961 U.S. silver medalist ;Men *Gregory Kelley (age 16), 1961 U.S. silver medalist, 1961 North American bronze medalist, 1960 World team member *Bradley Lord (age 21), 1961 U.S. champion, 1961 North American silver medalist, 1959 World team member *Douglas Ramsay (age 16), 1961 U.S. Championships fourth-place medalist ;Pairs skaters *Ila Ray Hadley (age 18) / Ray Ellis Hadley Jr. (age 17), 1960 Olympic and World team members, 1961 U.S. pairs silver medalists *Laurie Jean Hickox (age 15) / William Holmes Hickox (age 19), 1961 U.S. pairs bronze medalists *Maribel Yerxa Owen (age 20) / Dudley Shaw Richards (age 29), 1960 Olympic team members, 1961 U.S. pairs champions, 1961 North American silver medalists ;Ice dancers *Dona Lee Carrier (age 20) / Roger Campbell (age 19), 1961 U.S. and North American silver medalists *Patricia Major Dineen (age 24) / Robert Dineen (age 23), 1961 U.S. bronze medalists *Diane Carol Sherbloom (age 18) / Larry Pierce (age 24), 1961 U.S. champions ;Coaches *Daniel Ryan *Eduard Scholdan *Maribel Yerxa Vinson- Owen ;Judges *Harold Hartshorne *Edward LeMaire ;Others *U.S. team manager Deane McMinn *Referee Walter S. Powell Legacy Within days of the tragedy, the U.S. Figure Skating Executive Committee established the 1961 U.S. Figure Skating Memorial Fund, to honor the eighteen team members and their entourage who lost their lives on Sabena Flight 548. The mission of the Memorial Fund was to help rebuild the U.S. Figure Skating program, by providing financial support to promising young figure skaters to enable them to pursue their goals and develop their full potential. In March 1961, a benefit was held in the Boston Garden arena to raise money for the Memorial Fund. Over the years, thousands of young U.S. skaters have benefited from the fund which has continued to grow and prosper. One of the first beneficiaries was 12-year-old Peggy Fleming, whose coach William Kipp had died in the plane crash. Fleming became a symbol of the rebirth of U.S. Figure Skating when she went on to win gold at the 1968 Winter Olympics. In January 2011, the 1961 U.S. Figure Skating team were inducted into the U.S. Skating Hall of Fame in a special ceremony at the 2011 U.S. Figure Skating Championships in Greensboro, North Carolina. All eighteen team members were inducted, along with the six professional coaches that were accompanying them on the flight, Linda Hadley, William Kipp, Maribel Vinson-Owen, Daniel Ryan, Edi Scholdan, and William Swallender. In 2009, U.S. Figure Skating commissioned the production of a full-length feature documentary film called RISE, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the loss of the 1961 figure skating team. The film was produced and directed by the Emmy Award winning company Lookalike Productions, of Englewood, New Jersey. RISE was shown in theaters across the U.S. for one night only, on February 17, 2011, with one encore presentation on March 7, 2011. Proceeds from the movie were donated to the U.S. Figure Skating Memorial Fund. The film was shown on the Versus network on October 22, 2011. Vinson- Owen Elementary School, in Winchester, Massachusetts, is named in honor of Maribel Vinson-Owen and her two daughters who died in the accident. It ranks consistently among the top schools in Greater Boston. The 40th anniversary of the crash was marked by the unveiling of a five-foot-high stone monument in Berg-Kampenhout, close to the scene of the tragedy. Local dignitaries attended the unveiling ceremony which took place on February 10, 2001.

These are most commonly found in secular colleges and universities to cater to students of particular religious beliefs where the institution is not affiliated with, cannot endorse a particular religion, or hire its own religious ministers. These are sometimes affiliated as registered student organizations of their local university. Christian groups The need for pastoral services in secular universities can be traced back to the writings of John Henry Newman advocating for societies of Catholic students to be established at secular universities in England. The rising popularity of public universities in many parts of the world over sectarian private universities also necessitated a need for Christian ministerial services for students. At the same time Christian churches in the vicinity of colleges and universities may provide worship and ministerial services to local students. Roman Catholic In the United States there are about 250 Catholic Newman Centers that minister to Catholic students at public universities. They trace their origin to the Newman movement and are ministered by laypeople, local parishes, or religious institutes. More recently, lay apostolates such as the Fellowship of Catholic University Students (FOCUS), established in 1997, are ministering to and re- evangelizing Catholic university students and young adults. Latter-Day Saint LDS Student Association of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Protestant Protestant Christian and Ecumenical groups following their establishment also created ministries especially focused on evangelizing students. One most recognizable group is Cru, originally known as Campus Crusade for Christ, a inner-denominational Christian ministry established in 1951 on the campus of UCLA which has ministries in over a thousand universities. Various other evangelical groups have worldwide networks of campus ministries including the International Fellowship of Evangelical Students, World Student Christian Federation, and The Navigators. Often Protestant denominations will also have a related para-church student fellowship ministry or college group directly or indirectly affiliated with their denomination, sometimes named by it. Additionally, independent churches will often have college ministries which may extend onto constituent college campuses in the form of a student organization.

The trunkline follows State Street through the Saginaw area, and east of Lathrop Avenue, M-58 is split along two streets, using Davenport Avenue as well. This is the third time that the number has been used on a highway in Michigan; the first two were used in the Berrien County and Pontiac areas. The Saginaw version was designated in 1971, and it is listed on the National Highway System. Route description M-58 starts at an intersection with M-47 (Midland Road) near the Tittabawassee River in Saginaw Township. It runs east on State Street through a commercial area in the township. Continuing east, the adjoining properties transition to residential buildings. Between Avalon and Lathrop avenues, M-58 splits into a one-way pairing of streets: eastbound traffic continues along State Street, but westbound traffic uses Davenport Avenue, one block to the north. Just east of this split, M-58 crosses into the City of Saginaw. In Saginaw, the two parallel streets continue east and meet M-84 which runs north‚Äìsouth along Bay Street. The distance between the two parallel streets decreases east of North Carolina Street when Davenport Avenue shifts to the south. The intersection with Hill Street marks the beginning of the connections to the exit 3 interchange along a bend in the I-675 freeway. Hill Street is one-way carrying traffic southbound exiting from southbound I-675 to either direction of M-58. Two blocks east, Michigan Avenue carries traffic northbound under the freeway, connecting to a ramp to northbound I-675 before continuing north through the city of Saginaw. East of this intersection, State Street curves to the north, intersecting Davenport Avenue and merging into the ramp for southbound I-675. A loop ramp across the freeway provides access from northbound I-675 to Davenport Avenue. This interchange complex marks the eastern terminus of M-58. M-58 is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) like other state highways in Michigan. As a part of these maintenance responsibilities, the department tracks the volume of traffic that uses the roadways under its jurisdiction. These volumes are expressed using a metric called annual average daily traffic, which is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway. MDOT's surveys in 2009 showed that the highest traffic levels along M-58 were the 28,648 vehicles daily east of the split at Lathrop Avenue; the lowest counts were the 18,827 vehicles per day by the I-675 interchange . All of M-58 has been listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. History=Previous designations On July 1, 1919, the first M-58 was a highway in Berrien County connecting M-40 (now M-51) in downtown Niles with M-11 (later US Highway 12 [US 12], and presently Business Loop I-94) south of downtown St. Joseph. On November 11, 1926, the entire length was redesignated as a part of US 31. From 1930 through 1961, a second iteration of M-58 existed in Oakland County as a western bypass around Pontiac; the route ran from US 10 at the corner of Woodward Avenue and Square Lake Road south of Pontiac west to Telegraph Road and then north along Telegraph road to US 10 (Dixie Highway) north of Pontiac. Current designation This route is the third iteration of M-58 in Michigan. This route came into being when the western segment of M-81 was redesignated in 1971 following the completion of I-675 into downtown Saginaw. The routing has remained unchanged since designation.

The series consists of three main titles and a spin-off. Games=Main series Hard Truck = The original Hard Truck The original Hard Truck, also subtitled as Hard Truck: Road to Victory, was developed by Russian developer SoftLab-NSK published by Buka Entertainment, and released on April 20, 1998. It emphasized truck racing, in which players can race against trucks without cargo on a 3-lap circuit or with cargo to deliver on any of 3 linear courses, with no other vehicles present. All racing courses, including a training course, are accessible from a central base of operations where the player can obtain cargo, as well as purchase upgrades or even new trucks. This game featured the following trucks: DAF, ZiL, GAZelle, MAZ T-Storm, Mack Vision, Kenworth, Peterbilt, Freightliner Trucks Century Classic and Navistar (International Trucks). = Hard Truck 2 = The 2002 sequel to Hard Truck, like its predecessor, is open world, but grants far more freedom with a larger world that only requires one loading screen per play session, while shifting focus from racing to cargo transport across various cities (although competition with rival truckers is still present). It also adds traffic, police and mafia, and trucks can fall under attack if drivers do not practice safe driving or are spotted by mafia. Making money with successful deliveries is crucial to gameplay, as running out of funds would result in a game over, and the ultimate goal of the game is to achieve dominance of the trucking market (with at least a 51% stake), but not before gaining enough money to start a company first. The sequel incorporates the same truck brands from the first game, while also including Volvo, Scania AB and Mercedes-Benz Actros. Cars that can be encountered in gameplay include the BMW M5, the Renault Megane, the Fiat Marea, the Offroad HL/PS, the Oka and the Volga. =Hard Truck: 18 Wheels of Steel= In the same year King of the Road was released, a third Hard Truck game developed by SCS Software was also released, subtitled 18 Wheels of Steel. Unlike the previous two Hard Truck games, it removes racing altogether and focuses entirely on delivery of goods, playing more similar to Hard Truck 2. It also incorporates a traffic system, as well as elements of business management simulation, where drivers can be hired and routes set up to make a profit. This is also the first game of ValuSoft's 18 Wheels of Steel series, consisting of several games and spanning nearly a decade. Spin-offsHard Truck Apocalypse= Hard Truck Apocalypse, released on June 26, 2006, is another spin-off of Hard Truck, but its connection to the themes of Hard Truck is remotely in name only. Developed by the Russian developer Targem Games, released on June 26, 2006, Apocalypse is a completely different take on the hard truck games, set in an apocalyptic, Mad Max-like future. A disaster occurred and everyone on Earth has to wear special masks to survive. Trade runs between villages to make money can still be done but the main method for making money is to loot destroyed enemies of cargo and weapons. The game takes place in an apocalyptic version of Europe, with different zones depicting countries like Germany, France, England, and many more. Five vehicles, from a simple van to the gigantic BelAZ, are available to drive. The guns vary from roof-mounted machine guns, shotguns, and mortars to laser and energy weapons. The game was soon followed by Hard Truck Apocalypse: Rise of Clans, The official standalone expansion to Hard Truck Apocalypse, also developed by Targem Games. It has not been released in western stores yet, but can be purchased and downloaded online at GamersGate. It takes place in an apocalyptic version of North America. In the game the player is a vagrant, a strong loner who is searching for the mythical city of Edmonton in \\"le canada\\". The game reuses a lot of material from Hard Truck Apocalypse but most of the vehicles, weapons, and enemies are the same. There are four new zones and a whole new storyline. Reception In the United States, the Hard Truck series sold 790,000 copies between January 2000 and August 2006.

Early life and education  Sweeney was born in New Jersey. His father was John D. Sweeney, a professor of Medieval English at Seton Hall University who was also an avid musician. His mother, Katharine Sweeney Hayden, is a federal judge. Sweeney's parents divorced after 20 years of marriage. He has an older brother, Gregory Sweeney, who is a musician who works on the TV show Kitchen Nightmares. He grew up in Maplewood and South Orange, New Jersey. He attended Northwestern University before dropping out.  Career  Sweeney's high school band Skunk released two albums on Twin/Tone records (\\"Last American Virgin\\" in 1989 and the posthumous \\"Laid\\", both out of print). In the nineties he recorded and performed as a singer and guitarist with math rock band Chavez, releasing a seven-inch (\\"Repeat the Ending\\" b/w \\"Hack the Sides Away\\") two albums (1995's Gone Glimmering and 1996's Ride the Fader) and one EP (1995\\"s Pentagram Ring) on the Matador label. Chavez did several short tours in the United States and Europe between 1994 and 1997. When Chavez slowed down Sweeney filled in on bass guitar for Guided By Voices on the \\"Under the Bushes, Under the Stars\\" tour. He also provided vocals on the song \\"Quicksilver\\" on Guided By Voices leader Robert Pollard's first solo album Not In My Airforce LP. The late '90s found him continuing to work a day job and touring with Bonnie 'Prince' Billy as a guitarist. Sweeney's work has taken him across a variety of musical genres. Starting in 2000 he turned up on Cat Power's The Covers Record, playing guitar on \\"Salty Dog\\", and a couple of Bonnie \\"Prince\\" Billy singles (percussion on \\"A Whorehouse is Any House\\" and guitar and vocals on \\"Little Boy Blue\\"). In 2001 he started playing and writing with Billy Corgan and Jimmy Chamberlin in what was to become Zwan. He collaborated with Billy Corgan on the soundtrack to the movie Spun, singing the movie's opening song, a cover of Iron Maiden\\"s \\"Number of the Beast\\". He was also featured as a guitarist and backing vocalist on Bonnie \\"Prince\\" Billy's Ease Down The Road album. He lent a helping hand to Dave Grohl in assembling the all-star heavy metal album Probot, tracking down the legendary singers and providing some guitar work (the Probot album was not released until 2004, on Southern Lord records). Sweeney recorded and toured with Zwan from late 2001-2003. He is credited as providing guitar, vocal, and some songwriting on Zwan's album Mary Star of the Sea. After Zwan's breakup, Sweeney played guitar with Bonnie \\"Prince\\" Billy for several tours in 2004. January 2005 saw the release of their collaboration Superwolf on Drag City. Sweeney and Bonnie toured behind the Superwolf record in the U.S. and Europe. 2005 also saw Sweeney producing Brooklyn, NY heavy metal band Early Man's debut album, Closing In. The following year found Sweeney working in both the country music and hip-hop scenes, providing guitar work, along with Mike Campbell and Smokey Hormel on the Johnny Cash album, American V: A Hundred Highways and appearing with Yo La Tengo bass player James McNew and Def Jux founder El-P, as guest artists on the first track of rapper Cage's album Hell's Winter. He also played guitar on the Dixie Chicks Taking the Long Way album. In addition, he became a member of apocalyptic Christian folk legends Current 93 touring group, playing shows in Europe in support of the Black Ships Ate The Sky album. He also recorded with long-time friend Andrew W.K. for W.K.'s Close Calls With Brick Walls album. In 2007 Sweeney again collaborated with El-P, this time alongside Omar Rodr√≠guez-L√≥pez and Cedric Bixler-Zavala of Mars Volta, on El-P's 2007 album, I'll Sleep When You're Dead. In early 2009 Sweeney formed The Brill Sisters with Andrew W.K. and producer Don Fleming. They played their first show (without Fleming) at Santos Party House on April 2, 2009. The entire group performed on April 21. In 2016, Sweeney toured with Iggy Pop, Josh Homme as well as Matt Helders to support their album Post Pop Depression.  Production work  Sweeney produced Dax Riggs' album We Sing of Only Blood or Love in 2007 for Fat Possum records. In late 2007, along with Bonnie 'Prince\\" Billy, Sweeney produced Baby Dee's debut album for Drag City Records, Safe Inside the Day. The album was released in January 2008. Sweeney is credited for \\"wry guitar licks\\" on an album for NYC heavy blues rockers Endless Boogie, called \\"Focus Level.\\" It is rumored he produced the album as well. He also turned up on the Six Organs of Admittance's LP Shelter from the Ash. In addition, Sweeney has songwriting credit on certain pressings of Cat Power's Jukebox album, for \\"Song to Bobby.\\" He is also credited as an additional guitarist on that album.  Session work  In tune with his many collaborations, an unlikely combination of Sweeney and Neil Diamond was proposed by seminal producer Rick Rubin in 2008 to follow up Diamond's Rubin-produced 2005 album 12 Songs. The 2008 album Home Before Dark, released on the 12th of May, features Sweeney on all songs. Sweeney also plays guitar on Kid Rock's 2010 album Born Free.

He was known for his flamboyant style, clever aphorisms, and a series of published collections of anecdotes from his colorful career. Biography= Early life  Luciano was born in Endicott, New York, a suburb of Binghamton near the Pennsylvania border, and lived his entire life there. The 6-foot-4, 260-pound Luciano was a standout offensive and defensive tackle at Syracuse University, where he majored in mathematics. He played in the 1957 Cotton Bowl and was named to the 1958 College Football All-America Team. In 1959, he played on the Orangemen's national championship squad with future Heisman Trophy winner Ernie Davis.Ron Luciano: Biographical Dictionary of American Sports Retrieved September 1, 2011 The Baltimore Colts selected him as an offensive tackle in the third round of the 1959 NFL Draft, and immediately traded him to the Detroit Lions; but he suffered a serious shoulder injury in the College All-Star Game, and never played for the Lions. He was traded in 1960 to the Minnesota Vikings, who released him at the end of the season.Mulvoy, Mark (August 19, 1974): He Calls 'em As He Feels 'em. Sports Illustrated archive Retrieved August 24, 2011 The AFL Buffalo Bills picked him up in 1961, but a knee injury forced his retirement after only two games.  Umpiring career  Luciano's first book Luciano began umpiring in the Class A Florida State League in 1964. He was promoted to the Double-A Eastern League in 1965 and the Triple-A International League in 1967. In 1969, he became a Major League umpire, in the American League, and remained so until his retirement just before the 1980 regular season. As an umpire he was known for his flamboyant calls, particularly his habit of \\"shooting out\\" players. \\"My personal record is 16 shots; Bill Haller counted them,\\" he wrote. \\"I started screaming my calls and leaping in the air, making an attraction out of myself. The fans loved it. Naturally, the League officials hated it.\\" For all his antics, his skills were respected by the players: In a 1974 Major League Baseball Players Association poll, Luciano was one of only two American League umpires rated \\"excellent.\\" In addition to making theatrical events of routine outs, he was considered an \\"individualist\\" who played fast and loose with the league's rules of conduct. For example, rather than working from behind second base as mandated by the American League, he would frequently stand between the pitcher and the base, National League-style. He refused to call balks, insisting that the official definition was too vague to permit consistent enforcement. \\"I never called a balk in my life,\\" he wrote. \\"I didn't understand the rule.\\"Luciano & Fisher (1982), p. 88. He once congratulated Oakland infielder Sal Bando as he rounded the bases after hitting a home run to end a long slump. \\"The third baseman was looking at me as if I were slightly out of my mind,\\" he wrote. \\"But before he could say a word, I said firmly, 'It's okay. We're Italian.' \\" In 1973 during spring training, he switched positions and hats with Buddy Bell, playing a portion of an inning at third base while Bell umpired. (Both were reprimanded by the League.)Luciano R, Fisher D. Bang! Bang! You're Out! Archived from Sports Illustrated (1982). Retrieved June 13, 2016.Luciano R, Fisher D. The Umpire Strikes Back. Bantam Dell (1982), pp. 143-4. Luciano would routinely converse with players during between-inning breaks and even during play, a practice strictly forbidden by the League. While behind the plate, he would often chat with batters. In his first memoir, he recalled a situation involving future Hall of Fame outfielder Carl Yastrzemski: He later admitted that \\"on bad days following good nights\\"‚Äîwhen a hangover hampered his ability to call pitches accurately‚Äîhe would sometimes allow trusted catchers, such as Elrod Hendricks, Ed Herrmann, or John Roseboro, to umpire for him: Luciano's antics amused players and fans, but earned him frequent reprimands from the League office: League President Joe Cronin sent Luciano a registered letter the next day, chiding him for \\"conduct unbecoming of a major league umpire\\". Luciano was a member of the 1974 World Series umpire crew, but did not work the plate; the Oakland Athletics closed out the Los Angeles Dodgers in five games. Other extra-season duties included the 1971, 1975, and 1978 American League Championship Series and the 1973 All-Star Game. He was the home plate umpire for Nolan Ryan's second no-hitter in Detroit on July 15, 1973.Nolan Ryan: historicalbaseball.com Retrieved August 24, 2011 Luciano served two full terms as president of the Major League Umpires Association, and was one of its principal leaders and spokesmen during the 1979 umpires strike. \\"The umpires have kept this game honest for 100 years,\\" he explained to a reporter, in 1978. \\"We're the only segment of the game that has never been touched by scandal. We gotta be too dumb to cheat. We must have integrity, because we sure don't have a normal family life. We certainly aren't properly paid. We have no health care, no job security, no tenure. Our pension plan is a joke. We take more abuse than any living group of humans, and can't give back any. If we're fired without notice, our only recourse is to appeal to the league president. And he's the guy that fires you. That's gotta be unconstitutional!\\"  Weaver feud  Luciano was also known for a long-running feud with Orioles manager Earl Weaver, whose career closely paralleled Luciano's. The two men first met in Double-A during a four-game series in Reading, Pennsylvania in 1965; Weaver was managing the Elmira Pioneers. Luciano ejected Weaver from all four games, with the last ejection coming during the pre-game lineup exchange. After an argument with Luciano during a 1967 Triple-A game, Weaver literally stole second base, taking it to his dugout and refusing to give it back. In the majors, Luciano once ejected Weaver from both games of a doubleheader; the second ejection came, once again, before any pitches had been thrown. \\"The problem with Earl is that he holds a grudge,\\" he said. \\"Other managers, if they disagree with a call, may holler and shout, but you can still go out for a beer with them after the game. Not Earl. He never forgets. Heck, he even holds your minor league record against you. Once, a couple of years ago, I made a controversial call at the plate. Earl charged out of the dugout, screaming that that was the same call I'd blown at Elmira in '66. That sort of thing can get to you.\\"Pepe, P and Hollander, Z. The Book of Sports Lists 3. Harper (1981), p. 45, following his list of the five toughest managers he had encountered. Weaver was first through fourth; fifth was Frank Robinson, \\"Earl's protege\\".) Luciano ejected Weaver so often that Orioles players reportedly placed bets on the inning in which their skipper would be removed.Feuds for the Ages (January 31, 2005). Sports Illustrated archive Retrieved August 22, 2011 The friction became so intense that for an entire year, Luciano was transferred whenever his umpiring crew was scheduled to work an Orioles series. In the third inning of Luciano's first Orioles game a year later (August 26, 1979 at Chicago's Comiskey Park), he ejected Weaver ‚Äî who in turn publicly questioned Luciano's \\"integrity\\" and received a three- game suspension. Eventually, each admitted a grudging respect for the other. Weaver said Luciano was \\"one of the few umpires people have paid their way into the park to see.\\" Of Weaver, Luciano wrote, \\"It's impossible for me not to admire him, but it's pretty hard for me to like him.\\"Luciano R, Fisher D. \\"The Ump and the Manager: The irresistible force (Ron Luciano) met a reprovable object (Earl Weaver), with incendiary results\\". Sports Illustrated, March 1, 1982, p. 34. Personal life  Luciano married Polly Dixon, an airline flight attendant from Chicago, in 1974. During the baseball season they saw very little of each other, and during the off-season they could not agree on where to live: she did not want to move to upstate New York, and he did not want to live in Chicago. They had no children and divorced after less than two years.Meisel, B (January 24th 1995): UNLUCKY LUCIANO UNDERNEATH THE SMILE, DEMONS OF DEPRESSION. New York Daily News archive Retrieved August 22, 2011 \\"I once went four months‚Äîfrom March 3 to June 28‚Äîwithout seeing my wife,\\" he said. \\"I remember the dates because, on June 29, we decided to get a divorce.\\"Boswell, T.

Luciano was an enthusiastic amateur ornithologist and an avid reader. \\"I don't understand Shakespeare's sonnets at all, but I follow his tragedies,\\" he said. \\"I like the mean characters, people like Macbeth's wife. Hey, you've got to be a masochist to be an umpire, right?\\"  Retirement  After his retirement in 1980, Luciano spent two seasons partnered with Merle Harmon as a color commentator on NBC's Game of the Week;Ron Luciano: Baseball Library archive Retrieved September 1, 2011 but he became best known as the author of five books‚ÄîThe Umpire Strikes Back, Strike Two, The Fall of the Roman Umpire, Remembrance of Swings Past and Baseball Lite‚Äî compilations of humorous anecdotes and reminiscences from his umpiring days. He also became a popular speaker on the banquet circuit. In 1982 he auditioned for the role of Coach Ernie Pantusso in hit TV show Cheers, but producers \\"wanted an experienced actor\\". The part eventually went to Nicholas Colasanto.  Death  In January 1995 Luciano was found dead at age 57 in his garage at his home in Endicott, a victim of suicide via carbon monoxide poisoning. He reportedly suffered from depression for many years, and he was hospitalized for its treatment in early 1994. He is buried at the Calvary Cemetery in Johnson City, New York.

He served as Attorney-General of Pennsylvania and United States Postmaster General during the presidency of Franklin Pierce. Birth, education and early career Born in Philadelphia, his father was Anthony Campbell, and his grandfather was George Campbell, a native of Fintona, County Tyrone, Ireland. James was educated at the private school of Geraldus Stockdale, studied law with Hon. Robert D. Ingraham, and was admitted to the Bar on September 14, 1833. He was made a commissioner of the district of Southwark the day after his admission, and served until his appointment to the board of education. He offered on April 16, 1840, the resolution which established the Girls' High School of Philadelphia. He served on the board of education until 1840, when he was appointed, by Governor David R. Porter, judge of the courts of common pleas, orphan's court, and courts of oyer and terminer, which position he filled until January 1, 1851, when the judicial positions in Pennsylvania became elective. Further political career After the state's constitution was amended in 1850 to allow elected judges, he was nominated for the Supreme Court, at a period when Know-Nothingism and anti- Catholic feeling was rife. More than two-thirds of the party's state convention ratified the choice to nominate him, but he lost his election 179,238 to 176,101, although his four colleagues on the Democratic ticket were elected.John F. Coleman, \\"The Public Career of James Campbell\\" (Pennsylvania History: A Journal of Mid-Atlantic Studies, Vol. 29, No. 1, January 1962, pp. 24-39). James Buchanan remarked to a friend in Pennsylvania, \\"It would be a sad affair for the party, should Campbell fail & the remainder of the Judicial ticket be elected. He is the first Catholic, I believe, who has ever been upon a ticket for a State office & he is worthy & well qualified. Should he fail, this will be attributed to his religious faith; of course, [this would] very naturally exasperate the Catholic democrats. I hope our friends every where will bear this in mind. You exercise a potent influence & can do much to prevent such a catastrophe.\\" Governor William Bigler appointed him Attorney- General of Pennsylvania, in which office he served until March 4, 1853, when he entered President Pierce's Cabinet as Postmaster-General, serving until March 4, 1857. Campbell's Cabinet service was a reward to the faction of the Democratic Party that supported James Buchanan in the 1852 presidential nomination convention. Furthermore, as a Catholic, Campbell's nomination helped Pierce reach out to new voters from Ireland. In 1861 he was a candidate for the United States Senate against Charles R. Buckalew but was defeated by one vote in the state legislature, which at the time elected Senators. In 1873 he was elected a member of the Constitutional Convention of Pennsylvania, but declined to serve, owing to the condition of his health. For twenty-five years he was president of the board of trustees of Jefferson Medical College, and for forty-five years was vice-president of Saint Joseph's Orphan Asylum (the oldest incorporated Roman Catholic asylum in the United States, chartered in 1807.) On September 3, 1869, he was appointed by the judges of Philadelphia County a member of the board of city trusts, which has under its care 42 city trusts, including Girard College and Wills Eye Hospital. He served in these positions until his death. Judge Campbell looked upon his obligations, whether as public official or as trustee, as duties of the highest order and of great value to society, and he was a just and severe judge upon himself as to the manner and the faithfulness with which these duties were discharged. Even with all the cares that surrounded him, he was always ready to respond to the slightest call from any of the refuges of the poor and the ill. He made visits almost daily to St. Joseph's Orphan Asylum, to Girard College, and to the hospital, examining conditions in detail, and considering them with as much care as if they referred to his own life or to the lives of those of his own household.

Professional wrestling career=Independent circuit (1990‚Äì1993) LoGrasso started wrestling in 1990 on the independent circuit until being approached by NOW Wrestling Federation, based in Japan. Vito then went on to work in the USWA and WWC using the name Skull Von Krush. LoGrasso holds a rare one-on-one pin against Mitsuharu Misawa. He also teamed with \\"The Great\\" Genichiro Tenryu. World Wrestling Federation (1991‚Äì1993) He returned to the states in 1991 and became enhancement talent in the WWF. He wrestled on early editions of WWF Monday Night Raw as Von Krus, a german wrestler with an \\"evil foreigner\\" gimmick. =Memphis Wrestling (1994)= 1994 Vito debuted in USWA as Skull Von Krush managed by Lee Womack. He feuded with Brian Christopher, Spell Binder, and Jeff Gaylord. On March 7, 1994 Memphis Memories show. Vito, as Skull Von Krush, teamed with Danny Davis & Ken Wayne in a six-man tag match at a USWA show in Memphis to defeat the team of Jeff Gaylord, King Cobra & Spellbinder. He also later attacked Jerry Lawler. Extreme Championship Wrestling (1999) After a lot of success in those promotions, Vito met up with extreme wrestler Tazz at Johnny Rodz training school, who was able to get him a try out in ECW. When he started in ECW, he was still using the name Skull Von Krush. He later changed his name to Vito \\"The Skull\\" LoGrasso and became a member of \\"Da Baldies\\" stable, who in the storyline, claimed to be an offshoot of a real life New York street gang, and as such took issue with New Jack calling himself a \\"Gangsta\\" and began a feud with him. Vito worked a couple of shows with the now defunct LIWF with Billy Alaimo and was on the Junkyard Dog memorial show in a casket match at the Elks Lodge in Queens, New York. On the November 19, 1999 edition of ECW Wrestling on TNN, LoGrasso was pinned in a tag team match where the loser of the fall was forced to leave the company as he was already signed to WCW. World Championship Wrestling (1999‚Äì2001) In 1999 Vito left ECW for World Championship Wrestling (WCW) where he teamed with Johnny the Bull as The Mamalukes. Managed by Tony Marinara The Mamalukes captured the WCW World Tag Team Championship twice, and were, in storyline, jointly awarded the WCW Hardcore Championship. After being awarded the championship, however, Vito and Johnny were forced to face each other in a match to crown one champion, which Vito won. In WCW, Vito was billed from Staten Island, New York, which is where he actually grew up. In December 2000, the Mamalukes reunited and teamed together until March 2001, when WCW was acquired by the WWF. After the acquisition, Vito was one of the wrestlers who was lost in the shuffle, neither becoming a part of The Invasion nor taking one of the large ticket buyouts offered. Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2004)  Vito also had a brief run in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling in late-2004 with Glenn Gilbertti, Trinity and Johnny Swinger as the \\"New York Connection\\". His only feud was with \\"Irish\\" Pat Kenney, in which they exchanged victories. Return to WWEThe Full Blooded Italians and Singles competition (2004‚Äì2007)= In early 2005, Vito worked in various dark matches with Val Venis before signing a contract with WWE in June. On the August 6, 2005 episode of Velocity, Vito made his WWE debut, where he helped Nunzio win the WWE Cruiserweight Championship from Paul London. Vito and Nunzio would then reform as The Full Blooded Italians, wrestling in various tag team matches. After a brief feud with Gregory Helms, in March 2006, Vito and Nunzio would turn heel, after Vito announced he wanted to be recognized as a \\"Godfather\\". Beginning in May, wrestlers such as Orlando Jordan and Paul Burchill would approach Nunzio, spreading rumours that they had seen Vito in public places in various forms of cross-dress. On the June 2, 2006, episode of SmackDown!, after Nunzio was defeated by Matt Hardy, Vito, wearing a dress, came out to help Nunzio backstage. The following week on SmackDown!, after arguing about Vito's clothing choices, the two had a match against each other, where Vito defeated Nunzio. Shortly after, Nunzio joined the ECW brand, leaving Vito on SmackDown!, officially disbanding the team. Despite him cross dressing, Vito would continue to explain that he was a straight man; as on the June 23 episode of SmackDown!, Vito asked Ashley Massaro out on a date, which she agreed to. Vito would then begin to \\"have more fun\\" during his matches, running around and waving his dresses and otherwise interacting with the fans, turning him once again face. During this time, Montel Vontavious Porter and William Regal, as well as SmackDown! color commentator John \\"Bradshaw\\" Layfield, began to voice their problems with a man wrestling in a dress. Both MVP and Regal threatened SmackDown! General Manager Theodore Long with a sexual harassment lawsuit to get out of a match with Vito. At the same time, WWE began to \\"censor\\" any incidents of Vito's dress raising and exposing his (bethonged) buttocks. Vito then began an undefeated streak, which would last over four months until the October 20 episode of SmackDown!, when Vito was defeated by Elijah Burke after interference from his partner Sylvester Terkay. On the November 3 episode of SmackDown!, Vito teamed with Layla in a losing effort against The Miz and Kristal. On May 15, 2007, Vito was released from his WWE contract. =Deep South Wrestling (2007)= On January 25, 2007, Vito would win the Deep South Heavyweight Championship after defeating former champion Bradley Jay and Ryan O'Reilly in a three-way round robin match. After his title win, Vito would then undergo a gimmick change into a martial arts character, as he began wearing kickboxing-style trunks, a hachimaki headband, and wrestling without shoes, with Vito later explaining that the only reason he won matches was because his opponents were claiming that him wearing a dress was a distraction. Vito would briefly return in his new gimmick when he appeared as a lumberjack on the episode of WWE Heat before WrestleMania 23, in a tag team match between Carlito and Ric Flair against Chavo Guerrero and Gregory Helms. On February 22, Vito re-lost the title to Jay. Return to the independent circuit (2009‚Äì2015) Vito (left) and James Maritato in 2013.

It was included in the 1925 Contact Collection of Contemporary Writers and published by Boni & Liveright in Hemingway's 1925 New York collection short stories, In Our Time.Oliver, (1999), 308 Summary The story's protagonist is Harold Krebs, a young man who is unhappy after he returns home from serving in World War I. The story begins with a very brief background of Krebs' life. Before the war, he attended a Methodist college in Kansas where he was part of a fraternity. In 1917, Krebs enlisted in the Marines and did not return to the United States from Germany until 1919. By the time of his return to his home state of Oklahoma, the town has already given the returned soldiers a big, elaborate welcoming; Krebs‚Äô return seems late and irrelevant as the war had already been over for some time. Krebs was involved in the battles at Belleau Wood, Soissons, the Champagne, St. Mihiel, and the Argonne Forest. At first, Krebs did not want to share his experiences, but as time progressed at home, he wanted to talk about the war but no one wanted to listen. Krebs lies about his wartime accounts in order to gain an audience, though he does not want a ton. By late summer, Krebs is doing typical things: he sleeps in late, reads books, plays pool and his clarinet, goes for walks and reads. He has no interest getting a girlfriend. He just looks at girls because they are pretty, but he does not want to have to work to get one. About a month after his return, his mother requests that he come downstairs to eat breakfast. While Krebs is eating breakfast he reads the newspaper and talks to Helen. He then agrees that he loves his mother, but without much emotion. The conversation ends as his mother comes back into the room and asks to speak with Krebs. His mother says God cannot have any idle hands in his Kingdom. Krebs replies that he is not in His Kingdom. He then feels embarrassed for saying that. Krebs‚Äô mother then tells him that she understands how he feels, and that she is worried about him. She says that her father told her about his own service in the Civil War and that she has been praying for Krebs because she knows how he must feel. She then asks if Krebs loves her, and he says no; she cries. Krebs states that he doesn't love anybody. Krebs then realizes that he won't be able to make her understand and saying that will only hurt her. He says that he did not mean what he said but he does not love anyone anymore. Krebs begs her to believe that he did not mean it and so she prays for him. The story concludes with Krebs plotting to leave his hometown and get a job in Kansas. Style and themes In the 1920s, Hemingway was inspired by Ezra Pound's writings and applied the poet's principles of imagism to his own early work.Meyers (1985), 74, 126 Hemingway's short stories from the 1920s adhere to Pound's tight definition of imagism;Benson (1975), 285‚Äì287 biographer Carlos Baker writes that in his short stories Hemingway tried to learn how to \\"get the most from the least, [to] prune language, [to] multiply intensities, [to] tell nothing but the truth in a way that allowed for telling more than the truth\\". Hemingway adapted this style into a technique he called his iceberg theory: as Baker describes it, the hard facts float above water while the supporting structure, including the symbolism, operates out of sight.Baker (1972), 117 Setting The story takes place in Krebs‚Äô hometown in Oklahoma around the early 1920s after World War I. The town is the same, while Krebs himself has changed. His home is where he reflects on things that have changed him, like watching the girls and not wanting to get one, and telling his mother he does not love her. Symbolism There are many symbols used throughout the story. Harold Krebs' name itself is a symbol. Harold \\"is an old English name meaning army power or army ruler.\\" Krebs also had German ties to the word crab, which is a metaphor for Krebs‚Äô crab-like shell he has obtained from his experiences (Ullrich What's). The way that Harold has changed represents how America has been changed from the war. His values were changed now, like how America has been challenged from changing values to more modern times (Smelstor Soldier's). Krebs‚Äô home plays a large role in the story as well. On his porch, Krebs sits and observes the women of his town, much like how trenches in warfare allow a vantage point to observe enemy's movements. Here, Krebs' home is represented in a such a way that can be related to Krebs‚Äô wartime experiences. The map is another symbol. Krebs is reading a book about the war but he wished it had many more detailed maps. This symbolizes how now he is searching for direction in his own life, how he wishes his life would be mapped out. For the past two years he has been in the army listening to directions, now he is free and does not know what to do. A final symbol is the photograph in the beginning of the story. It describes Krebs and his fraternity brothers all of whom were wearing exactly the same thing. This shows \\"the conformist mentality of prewar, midwestern America\\" (Smelstor What's).  Television adaptation  Soldier's Home was adapted to a PBS television movie in 1977. ReferencesSources * Baker, Carlos (1981). Ernest Hemingway Selected Letters 1917‚Äì1961.

He is the son of former Major League Baseball manager Jeff Torborg. He is currently the conditioning coordinator for the Chicago White Sox. Baseball career Torborg attended Northwestern University, and played college baseball for the Northwestern Wildcats. He played professional baseball after graduating from college. His career began in 1994 with the Kingsport Mets of the Appalachian League. According to Torborg, he suffered two injuries that led to the end of his baseball career. The first occurred when he attempted to pickoff a runner while playing first base. Torborg broke his humerus bone when his arm was tangled with the base runner's arm. Torborg's final injury, which proved to be career ending, occurred when took a fastball to the face which broke his zygomatic bone and caused a change in his depth perception. Professional wrestling=World Championship Wrestling In 1995 on the way to Los Angeles, Torborg met Hulk Hogan and Randy Savage. The two of them spoke with him about going into pro wrestling. Torborg was trained by The Warlord and Jim Neidhart and debuted in 1998. He debuted in WCW and was said to have been a member of the WCW Pit Crew and was training in the WCW Power Plant. In 1995, he then worked for the American Wrestling Federation as The MVP, a baseball player character. After the AWF closed he was employed by World Championship Wrestling and was sent to the Power Plant to train. Some of the wrestlers in the Power Plant at that time were Bill Goldberg, Lodi, Chuck Palumbo, Mark Jindrak, Jimmy Yang, Evan Karagias, Shane Helms, Allan Funk, Christie Wolf, Ron Reis and many more future superstars. In 1998, he started to get a push as the MVP but after two matches as the MVP, he was asked to portray a character named The Demon. WCW head Eric Bischoff struck a deal with the rock band Kiss to create a Kiss- themed wrestler, \\"The Demon\\", a gimmick modeled on the stage persona of Gene Simmons. Torborg originally was told he was the Demon and was abruptly taken out due to Brian Adams having much more experience in the ring. Adams admitted to never feeling comfortable as the character. The gimmick was played twice by Brian Adams, rejected by him without wrestling a single match, and given to Torborg. He was managed by Asya (Christi Wolf), whom he later married. The \\"Demon\\" character was originally supposed to be the beginning of a stable called The Warriors of KISS, in which the other original members of the band would have a wrestler representing their look and gimmick.KISS ASYLUM: July '99 News Archive KISS was guaranteed their \\"Demon\\" themed wrestler would wrestle a Main Event match with the contract they made with WCW. This was supposed to happen at a special 1999 New Year's Eve PPV against Vampiro. The PPV and the match were taken off the table, however, after Eric Bischoff lost his position in September 1999. In order to fulfill the contractual obligation, he was booked in a \\"Special Main Event\\" match at Superbrawl in early 2000. Uncharacteristic to \\"Main Event\\" matches, it was the fourth match on the card and saw Torborg face The Wall which saw The Wall win with a chokeslam. Because Bischoff lost his position before the character's wrestling debut, The Demon character got off to a rocky start, losing to Terry Funk in its debut. Bookers at the time wanted to make Eric Bischoff look bad. Torborg contends that the character was hurt because the KISS concert to debut The Demon was one of the lowest rated segments in the history of WCW Nitro up to that point and even though Bischoff believed in the character, others believed it was dead on arrival.Where Are They Now? The Kiss Demon Afterwards, he was known simply as \\"The Demon\\" and placed in a stable with Vampiro and the Insane Clown Posse called The Dark Carnival. He later turned against the group and feuded with Vampiro. When WCW was bought out by the then-World Wrestling Federation in 2001, Torborg opted to go back to baseball as a strength coach and not do his scheduled tryout for the WWE. Total Nonstop Action Wrestling Torborg appeared with White Sox catcher A. J. Pierzynski on an episode of TNA Impact! on December 8, 2005. Along with veteran wrestling manager and color commentator Bobby Heenan. Torborg and Pierzynski presented A.J. Styles, Chris Sabin and Sonjay Dutt with memorabilia from the 2005 World Series until they were interrupted by The Diamonds in the Rough. Simon Diamond, the leader of the Diamonds and himself a former baseball player, mocked Pierzynski's .256 batting average, telling him that he needed a designated hitter. Diamond then slapped Torborg, leading to a brawl. As a result, Torborg, Sabin and Dutt, with Pierzynski in their corner, faced the Diamonds at Turning Point 2005 on December 11. At Turning Point, Dutt pinned Diamond following interference from then-Boston Red Sox outfielder Johnny Damon. On the January 18, 2007 edition of iMPACT!, Pierzynski and Torborg attacked Lance Hoyt, helping James Storm win, who was also aided by Miss Tennessee.Total Nonstop Action Wrestling On Spike TV! - NEWS At Against All Odds 2007 Torborg, with Pierzynski in his corner, was defeated by Hoyt, who had David Eckstein in his corner. Torborg and Pierzynski's appearance were some of the highest rated episodes for TNA. Baseball coaching When WCW was purchased by the World Wrestling Federation in March 2001, Torborg left wrestling and joined the Montreal Expos as a coach. His duties with the Expos included strength and conditioning coaching, assisting with infield drills and batting practice pitcher. At the time his father, Jeff Torborg, was the manager of the Expos. Torborg later served as the strength and conditioning coach for the Florida Marlins during his father's tenure as manager from 2002 to 2003. He made news when he scared Marlins pitcher Antonio Alfonseca into hiding in a trainer's room after Alfonseca swore at him in Spanish while refusing Torborg's request for a weigh-in. In January 2004, Dale was hired by the Chicago White Sox baseball team as a roving strength trainer. Torborg has been a part of two World Champion baseball teams: 2003 Marlins and 2005 White Sox. Torborg had a small role in the film Transporter 2, as well as numerous commercials over his acting career. He also worked with Tom Selleck for the movie Mr. Baseball, as well as with Madonna and Geena Davis for the movie A League of their Own.

It originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on November 17, 1999. Like the episode \\"Mr. Hankey's Christmas Classics\\", the episode is dedicated to Mary Kay Bergman, who lent her voice to nearly all of South Park's female characters. This was the last show to use dialogue by Bergman, who died by suicide shortly after production was completed. Plot An alien lands on Earth to make first contact in the African desert. Not realizing it is facing lions, it is killed and devoured. Its ship is discovered by the people from Starvin' Marvin's village. The village is occupied by Christian missionaries led by Sister Hollis (voiced by Michael Ann Young), who attempt to convert the community by assuring them that their faith in Christianity will get them food, prompting Marvin to board the ship in search of a place free of missionaries to relocate his people. Meanwhile, two agents with the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), having found out about this spaceship and wanting it for themselves, track down the boys and torture them by making scraping noises on a balloon until Cartman suddenly cannot take it anymore and tells them where Starvin' Marvin might have taken it. The two government agents then recruit Sally Struthers, whose character is depicted as looking similar to Jabba the Hutt. She is the leader of an Ethiopian food drive that is nothing more than a front for her to get all the food she wants. They offer her Chocolate Yum Yum bars in exchange. Marvin and the boys team up, and by accidentally pressing a button, they fly via a wormhole to the home planet of the ship's owner: the planet Marklar, whose inhabitants speak a language that is identical to English except for the fact that every noun is replaced with the word \\"Marklar\\". The benevolent Marklar agree to allow the Ethiopians to live on their planet. Back on Earth, the boys try to round up the Ethiopians, but the government agents seize the spaceship. The boys are able to take back the spaceship, letting Marvin load his people on while the boys distract the government agents, pretending to be Tom Brokaw. The agents are easily able to see through the disguise. Despite this, they are distracted long enough to load the ship, but Kenny is lost and seized by the government agents when the boys try to make a break for it. The boys try to make it to Marklar, but they are confronted by the missionaries, who have built their own ship and are trying to force Christianity to Marklar. During this time, while broadcasting his show The 600 Club on the Christian Broadcasting Channel, Pat Robertson is shown attempting to raise funds for various absurd weapons and upgrades to aid the missionaries while in space. A space battle ensues, before the boys have to face the government agents. The agents have had Kenny frozen in carbonite and given to Struthers so she can support them. Cartman convinces Struthers that she has influenced the boys that they need to help people more. This touches Struthers, so she lets the boys go and captures the missionary ship instead. Then, the wormhole is opened again, and all ships are taken to Marklar. When they arrive on Marklar, the aliens are very confused by the humans' attempts to explain their motives. Kyle explains the situation in the aliens' own language, and the Marklar are moved. They banish the missionaries and let the Ethiopians stay. The boys promise to visit again (with Cartman sarcastically adding \\"Yeah, and maybe Jesse Jackson will be President!\\"). Struthers then takes the boys back to Earth. Production The depiction of Pat Robertson and the 700 club is used as an example of South Park episodes that lampoon the religious right.Matt Becker, South Park, \\"I Hate Hippies.\\" Taking South Park Seriously (2008), 146. This is the first time that South Park did a cold open with no credits. On the DVD commentary, Parker and Stone refer to this as the first episode of Starvin' Marvin in Space instead of a South Park episode.

Hartley developed his painting abilities by observing Cubist artists in Paris and Berlin. Early life and education Front row, left to right: Jo Davidson, Edward Steichen, Arthur B. Carles, John Marin; back row: Marsden Hartley, Laurence Fellows, c. 1911, Bates College Museum of Art Hartley was born in Lewiston, Maine,. where his English parents had settled. He was the youngest of nine children.. His mother died when he was eight, and his father remarried four years later to Martha Marsden. His birth name was Edmund Hartley; he later assumed Marsden as his first name when he was in his early twenties. A few years after his mother's death when Hartley was 14, his family moved to Ohio, leaving him behind in Maine to work in a shoe factory for a year.Hartley, Marsden. Somehow a Past: The Autobiography of Marsden Hartley. Ed. Susan Elizabeth Ryan. Cambridge: MIT Press, 1997, p. 48 These bleak occurrences led Hartley to recall his New England childhood as a time of painful loneliness, so much so that in a letter to Alfred Stieglitz, he once described the New England accent as \\"a sad recollection [that] rushed into my very flesh like sharpened knives\\".Quoted in East, Elyssa. Dogtown: Death and Enchantment in a New England Ghost Town. New York: Free Press, 2009. Print. p.26 After he joined his family in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1892, Hartley began his art training at the Cleveland School of Art, where he held a scholarship.\\"Marsden Hartley\\". Dictionary of American Biography. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1973. Retrieved via Biography in Context database, April 18, 2017. In 1898, at the age of 22, Hartley moved to New York City to study painting at the New York School of Art under William Merritt Chase, and then attended the National Academy of Design. Hartley was a great admirer of Albert Pinkham Ryder and visited his studio in Greenwich Village as often as possible. His friendship with Ryder, in addition to the writings of Walt Whitman and American transcendentalists Henry David Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson, inspired Hartley to view art as a spiritual quest. Maturation and New York exhibitions Hartley moved to an abandoned farm near Lovell, Maine, in 1908. He considered the paintings he produced there his first mature works, and they also impressed New York photographer and art promoter Alfred Stieglitz. Hartley had his first solo exhibition at Stieglitz's art gallery 291 in 1909, and exhibited his work there again in 1912. Stieglitz also provided Hartley's introduction to European modernist painters, of whom C√©zanne, Picasso, and Matisse would prove the most influential upon him. Hartley in Europe Photograph of Hartley by Alfred Stieglitz at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, gelatin silver print, 24.8 x 19.8cm, 1916 Hartley first traveled to Europe for the first time in April 1912, and he became acquainted with Gertrude Stein's circle of avante-garde writers and artists in Paris. Stein, along with Hart Crane and Sherwood Anderson, encouraged Hartley to write as well as paint. In a letter to Alfred Stieglitz, Hartley explains his disenchantment of living abroad in Paris. A single year has passed since he began living overseas. \\"Like every other human being I have longings which through tricks of circumstances have been left unsatisfied... and the pain grows stronger instead of less and it leaves one nothing but the role of spectator in life watching life go by-having no part of it but that of spectator.\\" Hartley wanted to live within the noiseless countryside and an invigorating city.  German Sympathies  In April 1913 Hartley relocated to Berlin, the capital of the German Empire, where he continued to paint and befriended the painters Wassily Kandinsky and Franz Marc. He also collected Bavarian folk art.. His work during this period was a combination of abstraction and German Expressionism, fueled by his personal brand of mysticism. Many of Hartley's Berlin paintings were further inspired by the German military pageantry then on display, though his view of this subject changed after the outbreak of World War I, once war was no longer \\"a romantic but a real reality\\". The earliest of his Berlin paintings were shown in the landmark 1913 Armory Show in New York. In Berlin, Hartley developed a close relationship with a Prussian lieutenant, Karl von Freyburg, who was the cousin of Hartley's friend Arnold Ronnebeck. References to Freyburg were a recurring motif in Hartley's work, most notably in Portrait of a German Officer (1914).. Freyburg's subsequent death during the war hit Hartley hard, and he afterward idealized their relationship. Many scholars interpreted his work regarding Freyburg as embodying his homosexual feelings for him. Hartley lived in Berlin until December 1915. Hartley returned to the U.S. from Berlin as a German sympathizer following World War I. Hartley created paintings with much German iconography. The homoerotic tones were overlooked as critics focused on the German point of view. According to Arthur Lubow, Hartley was disingenuous in arguing that there was \\"no hidden symbolism whatsoever\\". Later years, return to the U.S., and \\"the painter of Maine\\" Hartley finally returned to the U.S. in early 1916. Following World War I he was obligated to return to the United States. Upon his return Hartley painted Handsome Drinks. The drinkware calls back to the gatherings hosted by Gertrude Stein, where Hartley met Pablo Picasso, and Robert Delaunay. Marsden Hartley, Handsome Drinks, 1916, oil on composition board, 61 x 50.8 cm, Brooklyn Museum, New York He lived in Europe again from 1921 to 1930, when he moved back to the U.S. for good. He painted throughout the country, in Massachusetts, New Mexico, California, and New York. He returned to Maine in 1937, after declaring that he wanted to become \\"the painter of Maine\\" and depict American life at a local level.. He continued to paint in Maine, primarily scenes around Lovell and the Corea coast, until his death in Ellsworth in 1943. His ashes were scattered on the Androscoggin River. Towards the end of his life Hartley fell in love with Alty Mason, a young fisherman. The relationship ended with the passing of Mason. He along with several relatives drowned at sea. Hartley is bashful when it came to his homosexuality, often redirecting attention towards other aspects of his work. Works such as Portrait of a German Officer, and Handsome Drinks are coded. The compositions honor lovers, friends, and inspirational sources. Hartley no longer felt unease at what people thought of his work once he reached his sixties. Scenes became more intimate from locker rooms to muscular hairy- chested men in what appear to be short trousers. Flaming American (Swim Champ) of 1940 has no need to decipher the homoerotic undertones. As Hartley's German officer paintings were misread as being pro-German, these new paintings were misinterpreted as being pro-American.  Important works  Marsden Hartley, Portrait of a German Officer, 1914, oil on canvas, 173.4 x 105.1 cm, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York  Portrait of a German Officer (1914)  In a personal memoir that was not finished, Hartley wrote \\"I began somehow to have curiosity about art at the time when sex consciousness is fully developed and as I did not incline to concrete escapades. I of course inclined to abstract ones, and the collecting of objects which is a sex expression took the upper hand.\\" Hartley's use of object abstraction became the motif for his paintings that commemorate his \\"love object\\", Karl von Freyburg. According to Meryl Doney, Hartley conveyed his emotions regarding his friend's traits in his paintings through everyday items. In this painting the Iron Cross, the Flag of Bavaria and the German flag are attributes to Karl von Freyburg, along with the yellow '24', the age he was when he died.

His book Twenty-five Poems was published by Robert McAlmon in Paris in 1923. Cleophas and His Own: A North Atlantic Tragedy is a story based on two periods he spent in 1935 and 1936 with the Mason family in the Lunenburg County, Nova Scotia, fishing community of East Point Island. Hartley, then in his late 50s, found there both an innocent, unrestrained love and the sense of family he had been seeking since his unhappy childhood in Maine. The impact of this experience lasted until his death in 1943 and helped widen the scope of his mature works, which included numerous portrayals of the Masons. He wrote of the Masons, \\"Five magnificent chapters out of an amazing, human book, these beautiful human beings, loving, tender, strong, courageous, dutiful, kind, so like the salt of the sea, the grit of the earth, the sheer face of the cliff.\\" In Cleophas and His Own, written in Nova Scotia in the fall of 1936 and re-printed in Marsden Hartley and Nova Scotia, Hartley expresses his immense grief at the tragic drowning of the Mason sons. The independent filmmaker Michael Maglaras made a feature film, Cleophas and His Own, released in 2005, which uses a personal testament by Hartley as its screenplay. A catalogue raisonn√© of Hartley's work is underway by art historian Gail Levin, Distinguished Professor at Baruch College, and The Graduate Center of The City University of New York.

In 2001, a Haitian court convicted him in absentia and sentenced him to life in prison for his role in the Raboteau Massacre. In 2008, he was convicted of mortgage fraud and sentenced to 12‚Äì37 years in prison. As of June 27, 2019, Constant was in custody at the Eastern Correctional Facility, a maximum security prison in New York. He was first eligible for parole on June, 30, 2016, but was refused; his next parole hearing eligibility date is in February 2020. He was not among 30 Haitians who were deported from the United States to Haiti on May 26, 2020. If and when he is deported, the government plans to arrest him and give him a new trial.  1991‚Äì1994  In mid-1993, two years after the 1991 Haitian coup d'√©tat, Constant set up paramilitary group known as the Front for the Advancement and Progress of Ha√Øti (FRAPH) to terrorize supporters of exiled president Jean- Bertrand Aristide.David Grann, The Atlantic Monthly, July 2001, Giving \\"The Devil\\" His Due. A CIA source implicated Constant in the 1993 assassination of Justice Minister Guy Malary, although the agency said the source was \\"untested\\".Tim Weiner, The New York Times, 13 October 1996, '93 Report By C.I.A. Tied Haiti Agent To Slaying. Constant was paid by the CIA from 1992 to 1994, as were several leading members of the military junta. He provided information to the agency for about $500 a month, according to United States officials and Mr. Constant himself.  1994‚Äì2005  After the 1994 U.S. and UN-led multinational occupation restored Aristide to power, Constant escaped to the U.S.. He was detained by INS officials in 1995 and prepared to be deported to Ha√Øti to stand trial for involvement in the Raboteau Massacre. However, in a December 1995 interview with Ed Bradley on 60 Minutes, Constant threatened to divulge secrets about his relationship with the CIA during the early '90s. In May 1996, after receiving Constant's threat, and intelligence that there was a plot to assassinate him should he return to Ha√Øti, the Clinton administration ordered the INS to release Constant. In 2001, Constant was convicted in absentia of his role in the Raboteau Massacre and sentenced to life in prison and hard labor.  2006‚Äìpresent  On July 7, 2006, Constant appeared in a Long Island, New York county court to face charges that he participated in a mortgage scheme that defrauded Sun Trust Mortgage Bank and Fremont Investment and Loan of more than $1 million. The purported fraud took place while Constant was employed at Melville Brokerage.The New York Times, 7 July 2006, Infamous Haitian Accused of Fraud On October 28, 2008, Judge Abraham Gerges of the Kings County Supreme Court sentenced Constant to serve 12‚Äì37 years in prison.Sentencing Memorandum, 28 October 2008. Judge Gerges concluded his memorandum with a plea that the United States government allow Constant to serve his entire sentence in New York State, rather than return him to Haiti \\"where he may evade justice due to the instability of the Haitian judicial system.\\" Judge Gerges noted that \\"it is apparent that the federal authorities may deport him shortly.\\" In early May 2020 it was announced that the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement was planning to send Constant back to Haiti on a May 12th deportation flight. The Center for Economic and Policy Research obtained a copy of the flight's manifest which included Contant's name and categorized him as a ‚ÄúHigh Profile Removal\\". The planned deportation caused a lot of controversy and was later reprieved. A new deportation of Constant was planned for May 26, 2020.

Position of Northumberland House and garden on a modern map, based on John Rocque's 1746 map crest of Percy), after a model by Michelangelo, removed from Northumberland House in 1874, prior to demolition, by the 6th Duke and placed atop Syon House,Per inscribed tablet at Syon House, see :File:Percy Lion plaque.jpg his seat to the west of London Northumberland House (also known as Suffolk House when owned by the Earls of Suffolk) was a large Jacobean townhouse in London, so-called because it was, for most of its history, the London residence of the Percy family, who were the Earls and later Dukes of Northumberland and one of England's richest and most prominent aristocratic dynasties for many centuries. It stood at the far western end of the Strand from around 1605 until it was demolished in 1874. In its later years it overlooked Trafalgar Square. Background In the 16th century the Strand, which connects the City of London with the royal centre of Westminster, was lined with the mansions of some of England's richest prelates and noblemen. Most of the grandest houses were on the southern side of the road and had gardens stretching down to the River Thames. Construction In around 1605 Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton cleared a site at Charing CrossThe site was the eastern portion of the former property of the Chapel and Hospital of St Mary Rounceval. on the site of a convent and built himself a mansion, at first known as Northampton House. The Strand facade was 162 feet (49 m) wide and the house's depth was marginally greater. It had a single central courtyard and turrets in each corner. The layout reflected medieval traditions, with a great hall as the principal room. It had separate apartments for members of the household, who would still at that time have included gentlemen attendants such as Jassintour Rozea, French Master Chef 1748 who arranged sumptuous banquets for the Duke, Charles Seymour, one of London's wealthiest aristocrats. Many of the apartments were reached from external doors in the courtyard, in the manner still seen at Oxbridge colleges. The exterior was embellished with classical ornament in the loose way of ambitious Jacobean buildings. The Strand's most striking external feature was its elaborate four-storey carved stone gateway. The garden was wide and over long, but unlike those of neighbouring mansions to the east, it did not reach all the way down to the river. Seventeenth and eighteenth centuries The house passed from Lord Northampton to the Earls of Suffolk, another branch of the powerful Howard family headed by the Dukes of Norfolk. In the 1640s it was sold to the Earl of Northumberland, at the discounted price of ¬£15,000, as part of the marriage settlement when he married a Howard. Regular alterations were made over the next two centuries in response to fashion and to make the layout more convenient for the lifestyle of the day. John Webb was employed from 1657 to 1660 to relocate the family's living accommodation from the Strand front to the garden front. In the 1740s and 1750s the Strand front was largely reconstructed and two wings were added which projected from the ends of the garden front at right angles. These were over long, in late palladian style, and contained a ballroom and a picture gallery, the latter itself 106 feet (32 m) long. The architects were Daniel Garrett, until his death in 1753; and then the better known James Paine. In the mid-1760s Robert Mylne was employed to reface the courtyard in stone; he may also have been responsible for extensions to the two garden wings which were made at that time. In the 1770s Robert Adam was commissioned to redecorate the state rooms on the garden front, and the Glass Drawing Room at Northumberland House was one of his most celebrated interiors. Part of the Strand front had to be rebuilt after a fire in 1780. Nineteenth century Northumberland House, shortly before it was demolished in 1874. In 1819 Thomas Cundy was employed to rebuild the Garden (South) Front, which had become unstable, moving it south; and in 1824 he added the final main staircase. By the end of the mid-19th century the other mansions on the Strand had been demolished. The area was largely commercial and its entertainment industry had grown, meaning it was no longer a fashionable place for aristocracy to live. The current Duke of Northumberland was reluctant to leave his generations-held home, although he was pressured to do so by the Metropolitan Board of Works, which wished to build a road through the middle of the site to connect to the new roads by the Embankment. After a fire which caused substantial damage, the Duke accepted an offer of ¬£500,000 in 1866 (). Northumberland House was demolished and Northumberland Avenue, including its buildings fronting, was built in its place.This painting, c. 1865, in which Northumberland House is centre left, puts the location of the building into its modern context. The view is southwards across Trafalgar Square, with the towers of the Houses of Parliament on the skyline. Northumberland Avenue One of the largest buildings on the newly built Northumberland Avenue was the 500-bedroom Victoria Hotel, which in its arched entrance, and oriel window above it, imitated Northumberland House.see image:File:Northumberland Avenue (15302741823).jpg During the Second World War it was taken over by the Ministry of Defence and renamed Northumberland House. This \\"new\\" Northumberland House was left empty for several years until it was purchased by the Wellcome Trust. Remains An archway from Northumberland House, designed by William Kent, was sold for the entrance to the garden of Tudor House, which formerly stood in Bromley-by-Bow. It was moved in 1998 to form the principal entrance to the Bromley by Bow Centre.

It lies approximately north-west of Zakliczyn, south-west of Tarn√≥w, and east of the regional capital Krak√≥w. The village was first mentioned in the year 1347. The name of the village is a Polonized version of a German word Mehlstein. In the Middle Ages, Melsztyn belonged to a famous nobleman Spytek of Melsztyn, who built a castle on a hill. The castle stood for hundreds of years, and was burned in 1771, during the Bar Confederation, as Polish rebels fought the Russians here. Among the owners of Melsztyn were the noble families of Tarnowski, Jordan, Zborowski, Tar≈Ço and Lubomirski. The Melsztyn Castle is a ruin now, with an excellent view of the surrounding area.

The basic idea is that an asymmetrical set of N phasors can be expressed as a linear combination of N symmetrical sets of phasors by means of a complex linear transformation. In the most common case of three- phase systems, the resulting \\"symmetrical\\" components are referred to as direct (or positive), inverse (or negative) and zero (or homopolar). The analysis of power system is much simpler in the domain of symmetrical components, because the resulting equations are mutually linearly independent if the circuit itself is balanced. Description Set of three unbalanced phasors, and the necessary symmetrical components that sum up to the resulting plot at the bottom. In 1918 Charles Legeyt Fortescue presented a paperCharles L. Fortescue, \\"Method of Symmetrical Co-Ordinates Applied to the Solution of Polyphase Networks\\". Presented at the 34th annual convention of the AIEE (American Institute of Electrical Engineers) in Atlantic City, N.J. on 28 June 1918. Published in: AIEE Transactions, vol. 37, part II, pages 1027‚Äì1140 (1918). For a brief history of the early years of symmetrical component theory, see: J. Lewis Blackburn, Symmetrical Components for Power Engineering (Boca Raton, Florida: CRC Press, 1993), pages 3‚Äì4. which demonstrated that any set of N unbalanced phasors (that is, any such polyphase signal) could be expressed as the sum of N symmetrical sets of balanced phasors, for values of N that are prime. Only a single frequency component is represented by the phasors. In 1943 Edith Clarke published a textbook giving a method of use of symmetrical components for three-phase systems that greatly simplified calculations over the original Fortescue paper. Gabriele Kass-Simon, Patricia Farnes, Deborah Nash (ed), Women of Science: Righting the Record , Indiana University Press, 1993, . pages 164-168 In a three-phase system, one set of phasors has the same phase sequence as the system under study (positive sequence; say ABC), the second set has the reverse phase sequence (negative sequence; ACB), and in the third set the phasors A, B and C are in phase with each other (zero sequence, the common-mode signal). Essentially, this method converts three unbalanced phases into three independent sources, which makes asymmetric fault analysis more tractable. By expanding a one-line diagram to show the positive sequence, negative sequence, and zero sequence impedances of generators, transformers and other devices including overhead lines and cables, analysis of such unbalanced conditions as a single line to ground short-circuit fault is greatly simplified. The technique can also be extended to higher order phase systems. Physically, in a three phase system, a positive sequence set of currents produces a normal rotating field, a negative sequence set produces a field with the opposite rotation, and the zero sequence set produces a field that oscillates but does not rotate between phase windings. Since these effects can be detected physically with sequence filters, the mathematical tool became the basis for the design of protective relays, which used negative-sequence voltages and currents as a reliable indicator of fault conditions. Such relays may be used to trip circuit breakers or take other steps to protect electrical systems. The analytical technique was adopted and advanced by engineers at General Electric and Westinghouse, and after World War II it became an accepted method for asymmetric fault analysis. As shown in the figure to the above right, the three sets of symmetrical components (positive, negative, and zero sequence) add up to create the system of three unbalanced phases as pictured in the bottom of the diagram. The imbalance between phases arises because of the difference in magnitude and phase shift between the sets of vectors. Notice that the colors (red, blue, and yellow) of the separate sequence vectors correspond to three different phases (A, B, and C, for example). To arrive at the final plot, the sum of vectors of each phase is calculated. This resulting vector is the effective phasor representation of that particular phase. This process, repeated, produces the phasor for each of the three phases. The three-phase case Symmetrical components are most commonly used for analysis of three-phase electrical power systems. The voltage or current of a three-phase system at some point can be indicated by three phasors, called the three components of the voltage or the current. This article discusses voltage, however, the same considerations also apply to current. In a perfectly balanced three-phase power system, the voltage phasor components have equal magnitudes but are 120 degrees apart. In an unbalanced system, the magnitudes and phases of the voltage phasor components are different. Decomposing the voltage phasor components into a set of symmetrical components helps analyze the system as well as visualize any imbalances. If the three voltage components are expressed as phasors (which are complex numbers), a complex vector can be formed in which the three phase components are the components of the vector. A vector for three phase voltage components can be written as :\\\\mathbf{v}_{abc} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} V_a \\\\ V_b \\\\ V_c \\\\end{bmatrix} and decomposing the vector into three symmetrical components gives :\\\\begin{bmatrix} V_a \\\\ V_b \\\\ V_c \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} V_{a,0} \\\\ V_{b,0} \\\\ V_{c,0} \\\\end{bmatrix} + \\\\begin{bmatrix} V_{a,1} \\\\ V_{b,1} \\\\ V_{c,1} \\\\end{bmatrix} + \\\\begin{bmatrix} V_{a,2} \\\\ V_{b,2} \\\\ V_{c,2} \\\\end{bmatrix} where the subscripts 0, 1, and 2 refer respectively to the zero, positive, and negative sequence components. The sequence components differ only by their phase angles, which are symmetrical and so are \\\\scriptstyle\\\\frac{2}{3}\\\\pi radians or 120¬∞. A matrix Define a phasor rotation operator alpha, which rotates a phasor vector counterclockwise by 120 degrees: :\\\\alpha \\\\equiv e^{\\\\frac{2}{3}\\\\pi i}. Note that Œ±3 = 1 so that Œ±‚àí1 = Œ±2. The zero sequence components have equal magnitude and in phase with each other, therefore: :V_0 \\\\equiv V_{a,0} = V_{b,0} = V_{c,0}, and the other phase sequences have the same magnitude, but their phases differ by 120¬∞: :\\\\begin{align} V_1 &\\\\equiv V_{a,1} = \\\\alpha^2 V_{b,1} = \\\\alpha V_{c,1}\\\\ V_2 &\\\\equiv V_{a,2} = \\\\alpha V_{b,2} = \\\\alpha^2 V_{c,2}\\\\ \\\\end{align} Thus, :\\\\begin{align} \\\\mathbf{v}_{abc} &= \\\\begin{bmatrix} V_0 \\\\ V_0 \\\\ V_0 \\\\end{bmatrix} + \\\\begin{bmatrix} V_1 \\\\ \\\\alpha^2 V_1 \\\\ \\\\alpha V_1 \\\\end{bmatrix} + \\\\begin{bmatrix} V_2 \\\\ \\\\alpha V_2 \\\\ \\\\alpha^2 V_2 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\ &= \\\\begin{bmatrix}1 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & \\\\alpha^2 & \\\\alpha \\\\ 1 & \\\\alpha & \\\\alpha^2 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix} V_0 \\\\ V_1 \\\\ V_2 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\ &= \\\\textbf{A} \\\\mathbf{v}_{012} \\\\end{align} where :\\\\mathbf{v}_{012} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} V_0 \\\\ V_1 \\\\ V_2 \\\\end{bmatrix}, \\\\textbf{A} = \\\\begin{bmatrix}1 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & \\\\alpha^2 & \\\\alpha \\\\ 1 & \\\\alpha & \\\\alpha^2 \\\\end{bmatrix} In reverse phase rotation systems, the following matrix can be similarly derived :\\\\textbf{Aacb} = \\\\begin{bmatrix}1 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & \\\\alpha & \\\\alpha^2 \\\\ 1 & \\\\alpha^2 & \\\\alpha \\\\end{bmatrix} Decomposition The sequence components are derived from the analysis equation :\\\\mathbf{v}_{012} = \\\\textbf{A}^{-1} \\\\mathbf{v}_{abc} where :\\\\textbf{A}^{-1} = \\\\frac{1}{3} \\\\begin{bmatrix}1 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & \\\\alpha & \\\\alpha^2 \\\\ 1 & \\\\alpha^2 & \\\\alpha \\\\end{bmatrix} The above two equations tell how to derive symmetrical components corresponding to an asymmetrical set of three phasors: *Sequence 0 is one-third the sum of the original three phasors. *Sequence 1 is one-third the sum of the original three phasors rotated counterclockwise 0¬∞, 120¬∞, and 240¬∞. *Sequence 2 is one-third the sum of the original three phasors rotated clockwise 0¬∞, 240¬∞, and 120¬∞. Visually, if the original components are symmetrical, sequences 0 and 2 will each form a triangle, summing to zero, and sequence 1 components will sum to a straight line. Intuition Napoleon's theorem: If the triangles centered on L, M, and N are equilateral, then so is the green triangle. The phasors \\\\scriptstyle V_{(ab)}= V_{(a)}-V_{(b)}; \\\\;V_{(bc)}= V_{(b)}-V_{(c)}; \\\\; V_{(ca)}= V_{(c)}-V_{(a)} form a closed triangle (e.g., outer voltages or line to line voltages). To find the synchronous and inverse components of the phases, take any side of the outer triangle and draw the two possible equilateral triangles sharing the selected side as base. These two equilateral triangles represent a synchronous and an inverse system. If the phasors V were a perfectly synchronous system, the vertex of the outer triangle not on the base line would be at the same position as the corresponding vertex of the equilateral triangle representing the synchronous system. Any amount of inverse component would mean a deviation from this position. The deviation is exactly 3 times the inverse phase component. The synchronous component is in the same manner 3 times the deviation from the \\"inverse equilateral triangle\\". The directions of these components are correct for the relevant phase. It seems counter intuitive that this works for all three phases regardless of the side chosen but that is the beauty of this illustration. The graphic is from Napoleon's Theorem, which matches a graphical calculation technique that sometimes appears in older references books. Poly-phase case It can be seen that the transformation matrix above is a discrete Fourier transform, and as such, symmetrical components can be calculated for any poly-phase system. Contribution of harmonics to symmetrical components in 3-phase power systems Harmonics often occur in power systems as a consequence of non- linear loads. Each order of harmonics contributes to different sequence components. Harmonics of order \\\\scriptstyle 2n make no contribution. Harmonics of order \\\\scriptstyle 3+6n contribute to the zero sequence. Harmonics of order \\\\scriptstyle 5+6n contribute to the negative sequence. Harmonics of order \\\\scriptstyle 7+6n contribute to the positive sequence. Note that the rules above are only applicable if the phase values (or distortion) are exactly the same. Consequence of the zero sequence component in power systems The zero sequence represents the component of the unbalanced phasors that is equal in magnitude and phase. Because they are in phase, zero sequence currents flowing through an n-phase network will sum to n times the magnitude of the individual zero sequence currents components. Under normal operating conditions this sum is small enough to be negligible. However, during large zero sequence events such as lightning strikes, this nonzero sum of currents can lead to a larger current flowing through the neutral conductor than the individual phase conductors. Because neutral conductors are typically not larger than individual phase conductors, and are often smaller than these conductors, a large zero sequence component can lead to overheating of neutral conductors and to fires. One way to prevent large zero sequence currents is to use a delta connection, which appears as an open circuit to zero sequence currents. For this reason, most transmission, and much sub-transmission is implemented using delta. Much distribution is also implemented using delta, although \\"old work\\" distribution systems have occasionally been \\"wyed-up\\" (converted from delta to wye) so as to increase the line's capacity at a low converted cost, but at the expense of a higher central station protective relay cost.

It has been owned by Cominar since 2014.http://affaires.lapresse.ca/economie/immobilier/201408/26/01-4794782-cominar- achete-un-portefeuille-de-15-immeubles-divanhoe-cambridge.php Rockland Centre from the southern parking Modern tenants The mall is home to H&M;, Vero Moda, Jack & Jones, Rudsak, Massimo Dutti, Le Ch√¢teau, Michael Kors, Stuart Weitzman, Zara and Guess. Current structure Rockland Centre has three floors; the basement, main and top. But only the main and top floors are shopping space. The basement floor has four tenants: Sports Experts, Nautilus Plus fitness club, Eggspectation restaurant and Urban Planet shop. The first (main) floor features boutiques and the anchors Linen Chest (part of the old Eaton's space), Pharmaprix and longtime tenant The Bay. The second (top) floor consists of boutiques and the mall's food court. The Bay's second floor is located on the mall's top floor. Historical=Original shopping centre (1959-1982) Rockland Centre first opened in August 1959 with Steinberg's, Morgan's, Woolworth's, Holt Renfrew, United Cigars and 35-40 other tenants. The original Rockland Centre was a non-linear outdoor shopping centre covered on the sidewalk. It was the first shopping centre in the province to bring the \\"mall\\" concept, meaning a central corridor in the form of an esplanade surrounded by boutiques on each side. It was primarily a single-level mall, but Morgan's had three floors (when counting its basement). Rockland Centre was built on what used to be a golf course. It was designed by architect Victor Prus, and commissioned by Morgan's and Steinberg's. Some of the tenants of the original centre included Reitmans, Laura Secord Chocolates, Browns Shoes and Bank of Montreal. Morgan's rebranded as The Bay on June 19, 1972. Conversion into an upscale indoor mall (1982-1983) By 1982, Rockland Centre was in steady decline due to the emergence of newer shopping centres. Its 80 tenants had their sales decreased by a third in the last decade. Rockland Centre began on April 23, 1982 a major renovation at the cost of 68 million $ to transform itself into the upscale shopping mall it is today. The majority of the original shopping centre was demolished. Only Steinberg's, The Bay and a handful of small tenants (e.g., Bank of Montreal) were spared from the demolition. The Bay temporarily closed its store on January 15, 1983 for renovation with the intent of reopening in August 1983 with the new mall. Rockland reopened as a three level fully enclosed mall on August 24, 1983 anchored by The Bay, Eaton's, Steinberg's and Holt Renfrew. The Eaton's store was built in the place of the demolished boutiques from the old shopping centre, at 139,000 square feet and making a fifth of the size of the new mall. The Bay reopened in a new building of 153,000 square feet, larger and adjacent to its former location, but with two floors instead of three. The Bay's original building was converted into mall space and its basement was turned into a food court. Holt Renfrew inaugurated a new store of 25 000 square feet; its largest at the time in a shopping mall. The Cumberland pharmacy doubled its size, while fitness chain Nautilus (known today as Nautilus Plus) opened its largest location at 14 000 square feet. Linen-Chest moved to the mall its original store that had been located since 1961 on Queen Mary Road in the Snowdon neighbourhood. A multi-level parking lot was built on the north side between The Bay and Eaton's during the transformation of the shopping centre. Rockland Centre increased its size at 800,000 square feet and its number of tenants to 175 stores as a result of these renovations.  Demise of Steinberg's and afterwards (1992-present)  Steinberg's, one of the last tenants from 1959, became a Metro in 1992. Metro closed the store in 1999. Today the space is shared between Pharmaprix, Soci√©t√© des alcools du Qu√©bec and a relocated Bank of Montreal.  Demise of Eaton's and afterwards (1999-present)  Eaton's closed shop in 1999. The existing Linen-Chest store doubled its size by relocating into the first floor of Eaton's in December 2001. The rest of the first floor of Eaton's went to Laura.https://web.archive.org/web/20090807023207/http://centrerockland.com/repertoire.recto.pdf As of 2018, the size of the Linen-Chest store has been reduced to half of what it was following a massive renovation that caused it to be temporarily closed for three months, while Laura relocated elsewhere in the mall as a regular boutique. An IGA supermarket will open in those vacant spaces during Spring 2020. The second floor of Eaton's was initially taken over by Sports Experts. In 2005, the Sports Experts store was moved to the vacant food court area on the basement (The Bay's until 1983). In a swap of locations, the food court was moved to the second floor where Sports Experts had been (and which had been Eaton's second floor). Almost 15 years later, the food court was closed for many months in 2018 to undergo a major renovation. This food court was rechristened \\"La Cuisine\\" on March 13, 2019. Also located within the second floor of the former Eaton's store is a Renaud-Bray bookstore which opened on October 4, 2018. The aforementioned second floor used to have a H&M; store which has since closed and is now vacant. Remnant of the original Rockland Centre Although revitalized into mall space in 1983, the exterior of the old Morgan's/The Bay building can still been seen to this day from the multi- level parking lot. Popular culture The mall was the filming location in 1992 for the episode \\"Tale of the Pinball Wizard\\" from the children's horror/fantasy television show Are You Afraid of the Dark?.

Port Dalhousie is a community in St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada. It is known for its waterfront appeal. It is also home to the Royal Canadian Henley Regatta and is historically significant as the terminus for the first three (19th century) routes of the Welland Canal, built in 1820, 1845 and 1889.St. Catharines Activities The city's most popular beach, on the shore of Lake Ontario, is located in Port Dalhousie at historic Lakeside Park. Popular activities that take place at the beach are stand up paddle boarding, swimming, kayaking & beach volleyball. The park is home to the Lakeside Park Carousel which was carved by Charles I. D. Looff in 1905 and brought to St. Catharines in 1921. It continues to provide amusement for young and old alike, at just 5 cents a ride. The Royal Canadian Henley Regatta, on Martindale Pond, has been happening for \\"almost 100 years\\".St.Catharines Etymology Port Dalhousie is named for George Ramsay, 9th Earl of Dalhousie, Governor General of British North America. Dalhousie also gave his name to Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and to the town of Dalhousie, New Brunswick. Dalhousie pronounced his name 'dal-HOW-zee' during his time. All of his namesakes carry this pronunciation except Port Dalhousie, and Dalhousie Street in Brantford, Ontario, which are pronounced 'duh-LOO-zee'. It is said that this is a result of the accent of the Scottish sailors and shipbuilders who frequented the Port's establishments (Dalhousie, himself a Scot, used the more upper class English-sounding pronunciation).

The town has a harbour and a quay at the Rhine. In terms of local government organization, it is a medium-sized city belonging to the district of Kleve in the administrative region (Regierungsbezirk) of D√ºsseldorf. Geography Emmerich lies on the north bank of the Rhine, just within the German borders; it is only 4 km to the Netherlands to the north and 5 km to the west. Therefore, it is the last German town on the Rhine before the river flows into the Netherlands.  Villages belonging to Emmerich am Rhein  The populated places which comprise the municipality of Emmerich am Rhein are Emmerich, Borghees, Dornick, Elten, H√ºthum, Klein-Netterden, Leegmeer, Praest, Speelberg and Vrasselt. Neighboring municipalities and cities To the north, the municipality of Emmerich borders the Dutch municipalities Montferland and Oude IJsselstreek, both of which are in the Dutch province of Gelderland. To the east, it is bordered by the German city of Rees. To the south, it is bordered by the Rhine, and south of this river, by the German city of Kleve. To the west, it is bordered by the Dutch municipalities of Rijnwaarden and Zevenaar, both of which are also in the Dutch province of Gelderland. History Emmerich, formerly called Embrika and Emrik, was originally a Roman colony. Around the year 700 Saint Willibrord founded the mission \\"Emmerich\\" in the Utrecht diocese. The oldest documented name is Villa Embrici, which survives from the year 828. The Water Gate in Emmerich am Rhein by Jan van der Heyden, c. 1664 The collegiate church St. Martinikirche was constructed in 1040. On 31 May 1233 Count Otto von Zutphen and Gelder arose to the royalty of the prosperous city with the authorization of the Roman Emperor Frederick II and the German King Henry (VII) Emmerich. In 1371 it fell to the Duchy of Cleves, and passed with it in 1609 to the Margraviate of Brandenburg. The town joined the Hanseatic League in 1407. In 1794 it was bombarded by the French under General Vandamme, and in 1806 it was assigned to the Duchy of Berg. It passed into the possession of Prussia in 1815. In 1856 the railway section Oberhausen-Arnhem, of the Cologne-Mindener Railway was opened. Emmerich was 91% destroyed on 7 October 1944Royal Air Force Bomber Command.

In 1949, Elten was annexed by the Netherlands until 1963. Since 1 February 2001 the city has officially been called Emmerich am Rhein, until then it was simply Emmerich.Stadtinformation - Daten und Fakten Stadt Emmerich On 28 November 2004 the four Catholic congregations of the city (St. Martini, St. Aldegundis, Heilig-Geist and Liebfrauen) combined to form the new city parish St. Christophorus. Municipality and county reform As a part of the 1st municipal restructuring program, the municipalities of Borghees, Dornick, H√ºthum, Klein-Netterden, Praest and Vrasselt were integrated into the city of Emmerich on 1 July 1969. In the course of the 2nd restructuring program, the municipality of Elten was integrated as well, on 1 January 1975. Places of interest Holy Ghost Church This Catholic church was built in 1966 and is especially striking due to its version of the cross made of scrap metal and the Stations of the Cross made of linen. The architectural development during the time of the Second Vatican Council shaped the design of the church. The Christuskirche. Rhine Bridge This bridge, which connects Emmerich on the north of the Rhine with Kleve on the south, was opened in 1965, and with a length of 803 meters and a span of 500 meters it is the longest suspension bridge in Germany. Approximately 500 ships pass underneath it every day. Rhine Museum. In the Rhine Museum, 130 ship models are exhibited, as well as a radar unit, examples of fish taxidermy, maps of the Rhine, a historic Christophorus figurine and a library of the city's history.

The famous poster collection is displayed in the former Lohmann chocolate factory in rotating exhibits. Castle Borghees. The manor house Borghees used as a cultural center was expanded in its present form in the mid-18th century.

He was best known as the general manager of the Brooklyn and Los Angeles Dodgers from 1951 to 1968, during which time the team captured eight National League pennants and its first four World Series titles. He was previously a key figure in the integration of minor league baseball in the late 1940s while working for the Dodgers organization. He went on to become the first president of the San Diego Padres (1968‚Äì77); then, between 1977 and 1984, as general manager, he assembled the California Angels teams that made the franchise's first two postseason appearances. His sons Peter Bavasi and Bill Bavasi have also served as big league general managers. Early life Born Emil Joseph Bavasi in Manhattan, New York City, his sister, Iola (\\"Lolly\\"), nicknamed him Buzzie because his mother said he was \\"always buzzing around.\\"Goldstein, Richard. ‚Äì Baseball: \\"Buzzie Bavasi, a Dodgers Innovator, Dies at 93\\". ‚Äì The New York Times. ‚Äì May 3, 2008. ‚Äì Retrieved: 2008-05-30 Bavasi was raised in Scarsdale, New York by Joseph and Sue Bavasi. Joseph, his immigrant father, was a newspaper distributor.Henson, Steve. ‚Äì Sports: \\"Buzzie Bavasi, former Dodgers GM, dies at 92\\". ‚Äì Los Angeles Times. ‚Äì May 2, 2008. ‚Äì Retrieved: 2008-05-30 He went to high school at Fordham Preparatory School, in the Bronx, with Fred Frick, the son of Ford Frick, president of the National League. He attended DePauw University, in Greencastle, Indiana, where he was a catcher and while at DePauw roomed with Fred Frick, after which Ford Frick recommended Bavasi for an office boy position with the Dodgers to Larry MacPhail. Bavasi was hired by Dodgers general manager Larry MacPhail in 1938, for $35 a week, to become a front office assistant with the Brooklyn Dodgers, and after one year was named the business manager of the Dodgers' Class D minor league team in Americus, Georgia, where he spent three seasons. In 1941 he moved to Durham, North Carolina Class B team of the Dodgers and married his wife, Evit. After being drafted, he was awarded a Bronze Star Medal fighting in the Italian Campaign of World War II as a machine-gunner in the United States Army. In late 1945, after serving 18 months, Staff Sergeant Bavasi returned to Georgia to rest with his family. While there, Dodgers president Branch Rickey telephoned and asked Bavasi to become business manager of a new minor-league baseball team in the New England League, and to find a suitable city in which to place the club. Integration: Nashua and \\"Dodgertown\\" Although Bavasi did not know for certain, he suspected that Rickey, who had started to integrate the Dodgers' farm system with the signing of Jackie Robinson the previous October, might be planning to sign more African Americans to contracts. If that was the case, the Dodgers needed a low-level minor-league team outside the American South to which to assign these players. Ultimately, Bavasi chose Nashua, New Hampshire. With fewer than 35,000 people, Nashua would be the smallest market in the New England League, and fewer than fifty African Americans resided in the community. However, the Nashua Dodgers were assured of a predominantly French Canadian fan base, a fact which both Rickey and Bavasi believed would help in the integration of African Americans into minor league baseball. Additionally, Nashua was home to the relatively new Holman Stadium, which Bavasi was able to lease from the city. In March 1946, Bavasi received word that Brooklyn had signed former Negro League ballplayers Roy Campanella and Don Newcombe, and that they would be sent to Nashua for the season. Bavasi spent nearly a month planning for their arrival, naming Nashua Telegraph publisher Fred Dobens to the position of President of the Nashua Dodgers to ensure the newspaper's support for the integration project; Dobens's newspaper did not release any word of the signings until April. Bavasi also publicly linked the team to Clyde Sukeforth, who had scouted Campanella, Newcombe, and Jackie Robinson for Rickey and who had played minor- league baseball in Nashua in the mid-1920s. He promoted the team's French Canadian connection through his team's Quebec-born players, and even attempted to hire Frenchy Bordagaray to manage the team (eventually he settled on Walter Alston). The 1946 season was a successful one. The Nashua Dodgers placed second in the league and won the Governor's Cup, defeating the Lynn Red Sox. In terms of attendance, Nashua also proved successful, in part because of Bavasi's imaginative promotional skills. The league saw few racially motivated incidents, with two exceptions. Campanella has claimed that Manchester Giants catcher Sal Yvars threw dirt in his face during a game at Manchester Athletic Field (Gill Stadium), but the incident was resolved on the field (though Yvars has denied that the incident took place). More seriously, players and the manager of the Lynn Red Sox hurled racial slurs and insults at Campanella and Newcombe, particularly late in the season when the two clubs were locked in a tight pennant race. On one occasion, Bavasi was so enraged by the comments of the Red Sox that he met Lynn's manager and players in the Holman Stadium parking lot and challenged them to a fight. Players restrained Bavasi and the Lynn manager, and the Lynn team boarded their bus without further incident. As a result of their success in Nashua, Bavasi, Campanella, and Alston all were promoted to teams in higher-level leagues in 1947, and Newcombe followed in 1948. In 1948, Bavasi became general manager of the Montreal Royals, one of the Dodgers' top two Triple-A farm teams. Around that time, as a result of continued prejudice against Brooklyn's African American ballplayers during spring training, the Dodgers sent Bavasi to find property at which to establish a permanent spring training facility. Bavasi chose a site outside Vero Beach, Florida, at which to establish Dodgertown, anchored by the newly constructed Holman Stadium. The Dodgers continued to train there virtually without interruption through 2008 before moving to a new facility in Glendale, Arizona. MLB executive career=Dodgers During Bavasi's term in Montreal, disagreements over the operation of the parent team in Brooklyn intensified between Rickey and Walter O'Malley; at the time, Rickey and O'Malley were two of four equal partners in the Dodgers, each holding 25 percent of the club's stock. In 1950, the illness and death of another partner, pharmaceutical executive John L. Smith, coincided with the pending expiration of Rickey's contract as the Dodgers' president and general manager. With Smith and, later, his widow both siding with O'Malley, Rickey's contract was not renewed. O'Malley then acquired Rickey's stock to assume 50 percent ownership, took over as team president, and named Bavasi the Dodgers' vice president and de facto general manager on November 3, 1950. O'Malley would acquire Mrs. Smith's 25 percent share in 1958, then become sole owner in 1975 when he bought out the heirs of Dearie Mulvey's one-quarter stake in the team. Bavasi would be given the formal title of executive vice president and general manager prior to the 1958 season. In Bavasi's nearly 18 years as the team's top baseball operations executive, the Dodgers won eight National League pennants (, , , , , , and )‚Äîincluding the first four World Series titles in franchise history (1955, 1959, 1963 and 1965). Three world championships occurred after the team's move to Los Angeles in 1958, a move that Bavasi did not favor.Springer, Steve. \\"The Dodgers leaving Brooklyn?\\". ‚Äì Los Angeles Times. ‚Äì October 8, 2007 The Dodgers also finished in a dead heat twice with the Giants, necessitating tie-breaking, best-of-three series in both 1951 and 1962. But they dropped the clinching playoff games in the ninth innings of each contest. While the nucleus of the Brooklyn-based team was in place when Bavasi took over in 1951, he and O'Malley remained committed to the Dodgers' extensive scouting and player development system that Rickey had constructed after the war. That system contributed players such as Joe Black, Jim Gilliam, Johnny Podres and Sandy Amoros (heroes of the 1955 World Series), Don Drysdale, Sandy Koufax, Charlie Neal and Don Zimmer to the Dodgers before their move to California. In the late 1950s, it began to churn out the core regulars of the Dodgers' 1960s dynasty, such as Tommy Davis, Willie Davis, Ron Fairly, Frank Howard, John Roseboro and Maury Wills. During the mid-1960s, the Dodgers developed key contributors to their 1965‚Äì66 pennants, such as Jim Lefebvre, Wes Parker and Don Sutton. Bavasi also made strategic additions of veteran players who proved pivotal to pennant-winning teams, like Sal Maglie (1956), Wally Moon (1959), Bill Skowron (1963), Claude Osteen (1965‚Äì66, after he was acquired for Howard), Lou Johnson (1965‚Äì66) and Phil Regan (1966). In 1960, he acquired (in a trade for Zimmer) a minor-league left-handed relief pitcher from the Chicago Cubs, Ron Perranoski, who would anchor the Dodgers' bullpen through 1967. Bavasi also strongly recommended Walter Alston to O'Malley as a potential Brooklyn manager after the 1953 season. Alston, then a career minor leaguer, had managed for Bavasi in Nashua (1946) and Montreal (1950). O'Malley would hire Alston and sign him to 23 consecutive one-year contracts, with Alston winning seven National League pennants and four World Series titles and forging a place in the Baseball Hall of Fame. In the days surrounding Bavasi's June 1968 departure from the Dodgers, the club enjoyed what has been called the best amateur draft in baseball history. The regular and secondary phases of the 1968 June lottery, supervised by Fresco Thompson and Al Campanis, the team's top minor league and scouting officials who would be Bavasi's immediate successors as GM, netted Steve Garvey, Davey Lopes, Ron Cey, Bill Buckner, Bobby Valentine, Joe Ferguson, Doyle Alexander and others. After the Dodgers won the 1959 Series in only their second year in Los Angeles, The Sporting News named Bavasi the Major League Executive of the Year. Padres In June of 1968, Bavasi resigned from the Dodgers to become president and minority owner of the San Diego Padres, an expansion team set to debut in . Bavasi selected Dodger third-base coach Preston G√≥mez as the Padres' first manager and added former Dodgers (or Dodger farmhands) Moon, Roger Craig and Sparky Anderson as coaches for their maiden season. While the pickings in the National League expansion draft were slim, Bavasi managed to select slugger Nate Colbert and hard-hitting outfielders Ollie Brown and Cito Gaston, who provided punch to the Padre lineup during the team's early history. As was typical for expansion teams before free agency, the Padres struggled on the field. They finished last in the National League West Division for their first six years of existence and lost over 100 games four times (and 99 games once); the team's high-water mark during Bavasi's nine- year term as club president was 73 wins (). Poor attendance forced majority owner C. Arnholdt Smith to put the Padres up for sale in 1973 and almost drove them to transfer to Washington, D.C. But fast-food magnate Ray Kroc stepped in and saved the Padres for San Diego, and attendance perked up beginning in 1974, Kroc's first season as owner. Although veteran minor league executive Eddie Leishman held the title of general manager during the team's early seasons, Bavasi was integrally involved in baseball decisions. After the 1972 season, he promoted his son Peter from farm system director to GM, and the younger Bavasi drafted future Hall of Famer Dave Winfield with the club's first-round pick in the 1973 Major League Baseball Draft. Peter left the Padres after the 1976 campaign to become the first president in the history of the expansion Toronto Blue Jays, and in 1977, the Bavasis became the first father-and-son duo to serve as chief executives of two different MLB teams at the same time. Angels After the 1977 season, California Angels owner Gene Autry hired the elder Bavasi as executive vice president and general manager. During his seven years in the post, the Angels captured American League West Division titles in and , the club's first-ever appearances in the baseball postseason. But each time the Angels failed to advance to the World Series, dropping the 1979 American League Championship Series to the Baltimore Orioles and the 1982 ALCS to the Milwaukee Brewers. Through trades, free agency and the club's farm system, Bavasi acquired players such as Rod Carew, Reggie Jackson, Carney Lansford, Bob Boone, Fred Lynn, Mike Witt and Don Aase. But there were setbacks: the shocking death of star free agent outfielder Lyman Bostock, who was murdered late during the 1978 season in a case of mistaken identity, and the failure to retain future all-time strikeout king Nolan Ryan when he became a free agent after the 1979 campaign. Nearing age 70, Bavasi retired during the closing days of the 1984 season, when the Angels finished at the .500 mark. Personal life His son Bill is the former general manager of the Seattle Mariners and California Angels; son Peter held president or general manager positions with the Padres, Blue Jays and Cleveland Indians during the 1970s and 1980s; and another son, Chris, formerly served as mayor of Flagstaff, Arizona, and with his wife, Evit, the couple had a fourth son Bob, the former owner of the Everett AquaSox. Bavasi was inducted into the San Diego Padres Hall of Fame in 2001. In 2007, he was also inducted by the San Diego Hall of Champions into the Breitbard Hall of Fame honoring San Diego's finest athletes both on and off the playing surface. Actor Wally Cassell played Buzzie (Dodgers manager) in season 1, episode 29 of The Beverly Hillbillies, titled The Clampetts & the Dodgers. Bavasi died on May 1, 2008, in San Diego, California, near his home in La Jolla, aged 93. References *Bavasi, Buzzie. (1987). Off the Record. Contemporary Books. *Campanella, Roy. (1959).

Legal Lali, 5:2,2 December 2002 . Retrieved 19 November 2013. He was Fiji's first native-born Chief Justice.  Education and career  Tuivaga was educated at the University of Auckland in New Zealand where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts on a Lau Provincial Council Scholarship. He was further educated in Middle Temple in London, where he read Law. He was admitted to the bar in 1964 and served as a Native Magistrate from 1958 to 1961. He was appointed as Crown Counsel in 1965, becoming their principal legal officer in 1968. He held this office till 1970. In 1972, he was appointed to the bench as a Puisne judge. When the Chief Justice, Sir Clifford Grant, resigned in 1980 under pressure from Fiji's first Prime Minister, Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, Tuivaga was appointed Chief Justice by the Governor-General of Fiji, Ratu Sir George Cakobau.Biography of Sir Clifford Grant at Sir Clifford Grant Chambers. Retrieved 19 November 2013 Knighthood Sir Timoci was awarded a knighthood in the 1980 Queen's Birthday Honours List for his achievement as the first native Chief Justice of Fiji. He travelled to London to receive the knighthood at Buckingham Palace.  Coup controversies  Tuivaga upheld the independence of the judiciary in the wake of the two military coups that rocked Fiji in 1987. His actions in a later coup in 2000, however, generated much controversy. Together with two other judges, Michael Scott and Daniel Fatiaki (who later succeeded him as Chief Justice), Tuivaga advised the then- President, Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, to abrogate the Constitution, as requested by the Military. Mara refused and resigned on 29 May. An Interim Military Government, headed by Commodore Frank Bainimarama took power, abrogated the Constitution, and promulgated the Administration of Justice Decree, which Tuivaga had drafted. This decree abolished the Supreme Court, made the Chief Justice the President of the Appeal Court (of which, according to the constitution, he had previously been barred from membership). Another decree extended the retirement age of the Chief Justice from 70 years to 75. Fiji Law Society President Peter Knight condemned Tuivaga's actions, saying, \\"The eyes of the profession, the nation and the world are upon the judiciary. It cannot be seen to openly condone criminal activity. It should as a matter of record that it will continue to occupy and function in its judicial role in the same uncompromising manner as it had done prior to 19 May.\\" (These changes to the judiciary were subsequently reversed by a High Court decision to reinstate the Constitution on 15 November 2000. This decision was upheld by the Appeal Court on 1 March 2001). Tuivaga was subsequently sued by members of the deposed government of Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry for his role in abrogating the constitution, which all judges were bound by oath to uphold. In an interview with the Daily Post on 15 June 2000, Tuivaga defended his role, saying it was not an endorsement but a practical acknowledgement of \\"reality.\\" \\"While a de facto government is in place it is impossible for me as Chief Justice not to acknowledge its actual existence as a matter of political reality,\\" he said. The Interim Military Government, which he called \\"the only viable alternative government,\\" needed to be recognized, he said, given the \\"situation triggered by the state of insurrection in the country which so far has proved insidiously intractable\\". These changes to the judiciary authorized by the decrees that Tuivaga had drafted were subsequently reversed by a High Court decision to reinstate the Constitution on 15 November 2000. This decision was upheld by the Appeal Court on 1 March 2001. That year, he turned 70, the retirement age mandated by the restored Constitution. On 1 August 2002, Daniel Fatiaki succeeded him as Chief Justice.  Failed ICC candidacy  Following his retirement as Chief Justice, the Fijian government nominated Tuivaga as Fiji's candidate for a position on the new International Criminal Court (ICC). His role in the 2000 coup came back to haunt him, and the Fiji Law Society strongly criticized his nomination. In what the Fijian government saw as a humiliation, he was forced to withdraw his nomination during the balloting on 9 February 2003, when Samoan candidate Tuiloma Neroni Slade outpolled him.  Reconciliation and Unity Commission  In May 2005, Tuivaga spoke out in favour of the government's proposed Reconciliation and Unity Commission, which would, if established, have the power to compensate victims of offenses related to the 2000 coup, and amnesty to its perpetrators, subject to presidential approval. Tuivaga cautioned, however, that the workability of the arrangement would depend on the good will of the parties involved. On 26 May 2005, the Rev. Akuila Yabaki of the Citizens Constitutional Forum expressed concern at reports that Tuivaga might be appointed to chair the proposed commission, reports downplayed by both Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase and Opposition Leader Mahendra Chaudhry.  Under investigation  In the wake of the military coup which deposed the Qarase government on 5 December 2006, Interim Attorney-General Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum announced on 22 January 2007 that there would be an inquiry into allegations concerning the role of the judiciary in the events of 2000. It was reported that Tuivaga might be subject to the inquiry. In a letter to the Fiji Sun on 23 January, Tuivaga expressed surprise, saying that the Constitution of Fiji makes no provision for investigating retired members of the judiciary.  Memoir  In October 2014, Sir Timoci released his memoirs titled, A Memoir of Sir Timoci Tuivaga Kt. CF.  Personal life  Tuivaga, who hailed from the village of Yaroi on Matuku Island, in the Lau archipelago, was the son of Isimeili Siga Tuivaga and Jessie Hill. On 20 December 1958, he married Dr. Viliamina Leba Parrott Savu at the Centenary Methodist Church in Suva. In 1992, Lady Vilimaina Savu Tuivaga suffered a cerebral stroke. She died on 13 January 2000. In July 2002, Tuivaga married Raijeli Vasakula, a lawyer and the eldest daughter of former Deputy Prime Minister and academic Tupeni Baba and Adi Miriama Cagilaba. They reside in Muanikau and Raijeli continues to run her own law practice today.. Tuivaga had five children (William, Jessie, John and Timothy) and eleven grandchildren. In a traditional reunification Fijian ceremony in 2013, Tuivaga and his clan welcomed and acknowledged Captain Koresi Toaisi Tuivaga, of Maqbool Road, Nadera, as the eldest of the Tuivaga children.  Death  Tuivaga had gone out to play nine holes at the Suva Golf Club on Wednesday, 30 December 2015. Afterwards he came into the club for drinks with friends and collapsed. Efforts by Army Commander Viliame Naupoto were unsuccessful. Having lived a full life, Sir Timoci died at 84 years old.

It was also formerly defined in New Mexico (which once had five degrees of murder) and Wisconsin. Depending on the state, third-degree murder may include felony murder regardless of the underlying felony, felony murder only where the underlying felony is non-violent, or depraved-heart murder, meaning that intent to kill is not an element of the offense of third-degree murder in any state which defines it. It is punishable by a maximum of 40 years of imprisonment in Florida (in the case of a violent career criminal) and Pennsylvania, and 25 years' imprisonment in Minnesota. Background and history The first division of the general crime of murder into graded subcategories was enacted into the law of Pennsylvania in 1794. This enactment is often explained in terms of a desire to narrow the scope of application of capital punishment in that state and in the other states which subsequently graded murder into \\"first\\" and \\"second\\" degrees. The English common law, which had been received into the laws of the U.S. states, at the time applied capital punishment to a large number of crimes; as a result, states statutorily divided the crime of murder into first and second degrees, and began applying capital punishment only to criminals convicted of first-degree murder. By 1953 three states‚Äînamely Florida, Minnesota, and Wisconsin‚Äîhad further created the subcategory of third-degree murder. By jurisdiction=Overview United States federal law, and the laws of the majority of states and territories, divide murder into separate crimes known as first- degree murder and second-degree murder, while the rest use other names for different categories of murder or do not divide murder into separate categories at all. However, only three states have a crime called third-degree murder. Florida Florida law divides murder into three degrees. First- degree murder comprises premeditated murders and felony murders where the underlying felony belongs to an enumerated list of violent or drug-related felonies; second-degree murder is depraved-heart murder; third-degree murder is felony murder where the underlying felony is not one of the enumerated felonies falling under first-degree felony murder. The exact statutory definition of third-degree murder is \\"[t]he unlawful killing of a human being, when perpetrated without any design to effect death, by a person engaged in the perpetration of, or in the attempt to perpetrate, any felony other than\\" nineteen enumerated categories of felonies. It constitutes a second-degree felony. Second-degree felonies are punishable by a maximum of 15 years' imprisonment ordinarily, a maximum of 30 years for a habitual felony offender, or 30 to 40 years for a violent career criminal. The nineteen enumerated categories of felonies falling under first-degree murder rather than third- degree murder are drug trafficking; arson; sexual battery; robbery; burglary; kidnapping; prison escape; aggravated child abuse; aggravated abuse of an elderly person or disabled adult; aircraft piracy; unlawful distribution of cocaine, opium, or other controlled substances when such drug is proven to be the proximate cause of the death of the user; carjacking; home-invasion robbery; aggravated stalking; murder of another human being; unlawful throwing, placing, or discharging of a destructive device or bomb; aggravated fleeing or eluding with serious bodily injury or death; resisting an officer with violence to his or her person; or terrorism or an act in furtherance of terrorism. Minnesota Minnesota law originally defined third-degree murder solely as depraved-heart murder (\\"without intent to effect the death of any person, caus[ing] the death of another by perpetrating an act eminently dangerous to others and evincing a depraved mind, without regard for human life\\"). In 1987, an additional drug-related provision (\\"without intent to cause death, proximately caus[ing] the death of a human being by, directly or indirectly, unlawfully selling, giving away, bartering, delivering, exchanging, distributing, or administering a controlled substance classified in Schedule I or II\\") was added to the definition of third-degree murder. Up until the early 2000s, prosecutions under that provision were rare, but they began to rise in the 2010s. Some reports linked this increase in prosecutions to the opioid epidemic in the United States. Minnesota law also defines the crime of third-degree murder of an unborn child, with the same elements of depraved mind and lack of intent to kill distinguishing it from first- or second-degree murder of an unborn child. Both third-degree murder and third- degree murder of an unborn child are punishable by a maximum of 25 years' imprisonment. New Mexico New Mexico once divided the crime of murder into five different degrees. A legal scholar writing in 1953 (by which time this level of division had been abolished) described this as the \\"all-time 'record'\\" for dividing murder into degrees. The definitions were as follows: * first degree: premeditated killing (punished by death) * second-degree murder was further divided into two kinds ** killing while committing a felony (punished by 7 to 14 years' imprisonment) ** killing with an extremely reckless state of mind (punished by life imprisonment) * third degree: assisting suicide, killing of an unborn child, and other acts of that nature (punished by 3 to 10 years' imprisonment) * fourth degree: killing in the heat of passion, killing while committing a misdemeanour (punished by 1 to 7 years' imprisonment) * fifth degree: \\"every other killing\\" that is not justifiable (punished by a maximum fine of $1,000, up to 10 years' imprisonment, or some combination these) In the 1884 Compiled Laws of New Mexico, third-degree murder included assisting a suicide (¬ß 696), killing of an unborn child by injury to the mother (¬ß 697), administration of abortifacient causing death of an unborn child or its mother (¬ß 698), unintentional killing of a human being in the heat of passion in a cruel or unusual manner (¬ß 699), and unintentional death caused by an intoxicated physician (¬ß 701). Pennsylvania Pennsylvania law defines third-degree murder as a murder which is neither a first-degree murder (\\"criminal homicide ... committed by an intentional killing\\") nor a second-degree murder (\\"committed while defendant was engaged as a principal or an accomplice in the perpetration of a felony\\"). For purposes of that section, \\"felony\\" is specifically defined as \\"engaging in or being an accomplice in the commission of, or an attempt to commit, or flight after committing, or attempting to commit robbery, rape, or deviate sexual intercourse by force or threat of force, arson, burglary or kidnapping.\\" There are also parallel crimes of first-degree, second-degree, and third-degree murder of an unborn child. and There does not exist the crime of third-degree murder of a law-enforcement officer, only first-degree and second-degree. Third-degree murder and third-degree murder of an unborn child are punishable by a maximum of 40 years' imprisonment. Third-degree murder was introduced to Pennsylvania law in a 1974 amendment, at the same time as second-degree murder was redefined as felony murder; prior to that, second-degree murder had been defined as any murder not a first-degree murder. The common-law definition of murder as homicide \\"with malice aforethought\\" remains in force in Pennsylvania. A conviction for third-degree murder does not require intent to kill as in first-degree murder, but it still requires malice. In general, Pennsylvania courts have ruled that the standard of \\"malice\\" required for a conviction of third-degree murder is the same as that required for aggravated assault: not just \\"ordinary negligence\\" nor \\"mere recklessness\\", but \\"a higher degree of culpability, i.e., that which considers and then disregards the threat necessarily posed to human life by the offending conduct\\". A defense of diminished capacity may reduce first-degree murder to third-degree murder. The crime known as drug delivery resulting in death had originally been classified as another form of third-degree murder under Pennsylvania law. In Commonwealth v. Ludwig (2005), the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled that this meant that conviction for the crime required the same element of malice as in any other third-degree murder. In response to this ruling, the Pennsylvania General Assembly amended the definition of the crime in 2011 to reclassify it as general criminal homicide rather than specifically as third-degree murder, thus removing the requirement of malice. However, the maximum sentence remained the same 40 years' imprisonment as for third-degree murder. Wisconsin Soon after statehood, Wisconsin enacted statutes repealing the common law crime of murder, creating the statutory crime of murder and dividing the statutory crime of murder into three degrees, with the third encompassing felony murder. For example, the 1849 Revised Statutes defined third-degree murder as a killing \\"perpetrated without any design to effect the death, by a person engaged in the commission of any felony\\". The 1956 Criminal Code in ¬ß 940.03 defined third-degree murder as causing the death of another \\"in the course of committing or attempting to commit a felony ... as a natural and probable consequence of the commission of or attempt to commit the felony\\", and provided that the sentence for the underlying felony could thus be extended by 15 years. This was described by some commentators as a \\"hybrid\\" between the common-law felony murder rule and the civil law approach of treating an unintentional death as a \\"penalty-enhancer\\" to the punishment for the underlying felony. The 1988 revision of ¬ß 940.03 removed the term \\"third- degree murder\\" entirely and re-entitled the section as \\"felony murder\\".

The initial agreements were signed in February 1921 and formally took effect in 1923. During the interwar period the alliance with Poland was one of the cornerstones of French foreign policy. Near the end of that period, along with the Franco-British alliance, it was the basis for the creation of the Allies of World War II. Background During the France-Habsburg rivalry which began in the 16th century, France had tried to find allies to the east of Austria and hoped to ally with Poland. Polish King Jan III Sobieski also had the intention to ally with France against the threat of Austria, but the greater threat posed by the Muslim-led Ottoman Empire made him fight for the Christian cause in the Battle of Vienna. In the 18th century, Poland was partitioned by Russia, Prussia and Austria, but Napoleon recreated the Polish state in the Duchy of Warsaw. With the rise of a united German Empire in the 19th century, France and Poland found a new common enemy. Interwar period  During the Polish-Soviet War of 1920, France, one of the most active supporters of Poland, sent the French Military Mission to Poland to aid the Polish army. In early February in Paris, three pacts were discussed by Polish Chief of State J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski and French President Alexandre Millerand: political, military and economic. The political alliance was signed there on February 19, 1921 by Polish Minister of Foreign Affairs Count Eustachy Sapieha and his French Minister of Foreign Affairs Aristide Briand, in the background of the negotiations that ended the Polish-Soviet War by the Treaty of Riga. The agreement assumed a common foreign policy, the promotion of bilateral economical contacts, the consultation of new pacts concerning Central and Eastern Europe and assistance in case one of the signatories became a victim of an \\"unprovoked\\" attack. As such, it was a defensive alliance.Umowa polityczna francusko-polska, podpisana w Pary≈ºu 19 lutego 1921 r. (Dz.U. 1922 nr 63 poz. 563), registration July 2, 1923: France and Poland - Political Agreement, signed at Paris, February 19, 1921 (1923 LNTSer 87; 18 LNTS 11) The secret military pact was signed two days later, on February 21, 1921, and clarified that the agreement was aimed at possible threats from both Germany and the Soviet Union.Accord militaire franco-polonais Paris, 19 f√©vrier 1921: Documents Diplomatiques Francais: 1921 - Tome I (16 Janvier - 30 Juin), Secret Milit Convention between France and Poland An attack on Poland would make France keep lines of communication free and Germany in check but not require it to send troops or to declare war. Both political and military pacts were legally not in force until the economic pact was ratified, which occurred on August 2, 1923.Dz.U. 1923 nr 106 poz. 833 The alliance was further extended by the Franco-Polish Warrant Agreement, signed on October 16, 1925 in Locarno, as part of the Locarno Treaties. The new treaty subscribed all previously-signed Polish-French agreements to the system of mutual pacts of the League of Nations.Traktat Gwarancyjny pomiƒôdzy PolskƒÖ a FrancjƒÖ, podpisany w Londynie 1 grudnia 1925 r.

France's alliances with Poland and Czechoslovakia were aimed at deterring Germany from the use of force to achieve a revision of the postwar settlement and ensuring that German forces would be confronted with significant combined strength of its neighbours. Although Czechoslovakia had a significant economy and industry and Poland had a strong army, the French-Polish-Czechoslovakian triangle never reached its full potential. Czechoslovakian foreign policy, under Edvard Bene≈°, avoided signing a formal alliance with Poland, which would force Czechoslovakia to take sides in Polish-German territorial disputes. Czechoslovakia's influence was weakened by the doubts of its allies as to the trustworthiness of its army, and Poland's influence was undermined by fighting between supporters and opponents of J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski. France's reluctance to invest in its allies' industry (especially Poland's), improve trade relations by buying their agricultural products and share military expertise further weakened the alliance.This paragraph is based on a review of Zandycz book by Detlef Brandes, from Slavic Review, Fall 1990 issue In the 1930s, the alliance remained mostly inactive and its only effect was to keep the French Military Mission to Poland, which had worked with the Polish General Staff ever since the Polish-Soviet War of 1919-1920. However, with the German threat becoming increasingly visible in the latter part of the decade, both countries started to seek a new pact to guarantee the independence of all contracting parties and military co-operation in case of a war with Germany.  1939  Finally, a new alliance started to be formed in 1939. The Kasprzycki-Gamelin Convention was signed May 19, 1939 in Paris. It was named after Polish Minister of War Affairs General Tadeusz Kasprzycki and Commander of the French Army Maurice Gamelin.Protocole Franco-Polonais 1939 Gamelin-Kasprzycki : Contre-t√©moignage sur une catastrophe, Protok√≥≈Ç ko≈Ñcowy francusko-polskich rozm√≥w sztabowych 15-17 maja 1939 The military convention was army-to-army, not state-to-state, and was not in force legally, as it was dependent on signing and ratification of the political convention. It obliged both armies to provide help to each other in case of a war with Germany. In May, Gamelin promised a \\"bold relief offensive\\" within three weeks of a German attack. The treaty was ratified by France on September 4, 1939, on the fourth day of German offensive on Poland. However, France provided only token help to Poland during the war in the form of the Saar Offensive, which has often been considered an example of Western betrayal. However, the political convention was the basis of the recreation of the Polish Army in France. Piotr Zychowicz quoted the memoirs of the French ambassador to Poland, L√©on No√´l, who wrote as early as October 1938, \\"It is of utmost importance that we remove from our obligations everything that would deprive French government the freedom of decision on the day when Poland finds itself in war with Germany\\".

Since its inception, multiple alternate theories have been proposed. There have been applications of the concept outside of the original context of habitat conservation. Visual of SLOSS  History  In 1975, Jared Diamond suggested some \\"rules\\" for the design of protected areas, based on Robert MacArthur and E. O. Wilson's book The Theory of Island Biogeography. One of his suggestions was that a single large reserve was preferable to several smaller reserves whose total areas were equal to the larger. Since species richness increases with habitat area, as established by the species area curve, a larger block of habitat would support more species than any of the smaller blocks. This idea was popularised by many other ecologists, and has been incorporated into most standard textbooks in conservation biology, and was used in real-world conservation planning. This idea was challenged by Wilson's former student Daniel Simberloff, who pointed out that this idea relied on the assumption that smaller reserves had a nested species composition ‚Äî it assumed that each larger reserve had all the species presented in any smaller reserve. If the smaller reserves had unshared species, then it was possible that two smaller reserves could have more species than a single large reserve. Simberloff and Abele expanded their argument in subsequent paper in the journal The American Naturalist stating neither ecological theory nor empirical data exist to support the hypothesis that subdividing a nature reserve would increase extinction rates, basically negating Diamond as well as MacArthur and Wilson. Bruce A. Wilcox and Dennis D. Murphy responded with a key paper \\"Conservation strategy - effects of fragmentation on extinction\\" pointing out flaws in their argument while providing a comprehensive definition of habitat fragmentation. Wilcox and Murphy also argued that habitat fragmentation is probably the major threat to the loss of global biological diversity. This helped set the stage for fragmentation research as an important area of conservation biology.Laurance, William F., and R.O. Bierregaard. 1997. Tropical Forest Remnants: Ecology, Management, and Conservation of Fragmented Communities. University of Chicago Press. The SLOSS debate ensued as to the extent to which smaller reserves shared species with one another, leading to the development of nested subset theory by Bruce D. Patterson and Wirt Atmar in the 1980s and to the establishment of the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP) near Manaus, Brazil in 1979 by Thomas Lovejoy and Richard Bierregaard.  Alternate theories  In 1986, Michael E. Soul√© and Daniel Simberloff proposed that the SLOSS debate was irrelevant and that a three step process was the ideal way to determine reserve size. The proposed steps were to firstly decide the species whose presence was most important to the reserves biodiversity, secondly, decide how many of the species were required for the species to survive, and lastly, based on other metapopulation densities, estimate how much space is needed to sustain the required number of individuals.  Other Considerations  * Dispersal and genetics, the consideration of which alternate theories often center on as the original debated tended to ignore them. * Habitat connectivity or Landscape connectivity.  Applications of SLOSS = Conservation park planning  The purpose of the debate itself is in regards to conservation planning and is currently used in most spacial allotment planning.  Urban areas  The SLOSS debate has come in to play in urban planning concerning green spaces with considerations extending beyond biodiversity to human well being. The concept can also be applied to other aspects of city planning.  Current status of debate  The general consensus of the SLOSS debate is that neither option fit every situation and that they must all be evaluated on a case to case basis in accordance to the conservation goal to decide the best course of action. In the field of metapopulation ecology, modelling works suggest that the SLOSS debate should be refined and cannot be solved without explicit spatial consideration of dispersal and environmental dynamics. In particular, a large number of small patches may be optimal to long-term species persistence only if the species range increases with the number of patches. In conservation biology and conservation genetics, metapopulations (i.e. connected groups of sub- populations) are considered to be more stable if they are larger, or have more populations.Hanski, Ilkka. 1999. Metapopulation Ecology. Oxford University Press. This is because although individual small populations may go extinct due to stochastic processes of environment or biology (such as genetic drift and inbreeding), they can be recolonized by rare migrants from other surviving populations. Thus several small populations could be better than a single large: if a catastrophe wipes out a single big population, the species goes extinct, but if some regional populations in a large metapopulation get wiped out, recolonization from the rest of the metapopulation can ensure their eventual survival. In cases of habitat loss, when the loss is dispersed, few large reserves are best, when the loss is in clusters, multiple small reserves are best.

This is a bromine atom with an ionic charge of ‚àí1 (Br‚àí); for example, in caesium bromide, caesium cations (Cs+) are electrically attracted to bromide anions (Br‚àí) to form the electrically neutral ionic compound CsBr. The term \\"bromide\\" can also refer to a bromine atom with an oxidation number of ‚àí1 in covalent compounds such as sulfur dibromide (SBr2). Natural occurrence Bromide is present in typical seawater (35 PSU) with a concentration of around 65 mg/L, which is around 0.2% of all dissolved salts. Seafoods and deep sea plants generally have high levels of bromide, while foods derived from land have variable amounts. Bromargyryte - natural, crystalline silver bromide - is the most common bromide mineral currently known, but is still very rare. Beside silver, bromine is sometimes found in minerals combined with mercury and copper. Chemistry One can test for a bromide ion by adding excess dilute HNO3 followed by dilute aqueous AgNO3 solution. The formation of creamy silver bromide precipitate confirms the existence of bromides. Medical uses Bromide compounds, especially potassium bromide, were frequently used as sedatives in the 19th and early 20th century. Their use in over-the-counter sedatives and headache remedies (such as Bromo-Seltzer) in the United States extended to 1975, when bromides were withdrawn as ingredients, due to chronic toxicity.. This use gave the word \\"bromide\\" its colloquial connotation of a boring clich√©, a bit of conventional wisdom overused as a calming phrase, or verbal sedative. The bromide ion is antiepileptic, and bromide salts are still used as such, particularly in veterinary medicine. Bromide ion is excreted by the kidneys. The half-life of bromide in the human body (12 days) is long compared with many pharmaceuticals, making dosing difficult to adjust (a new dose may require several months to reach equilibrium). Bromide ion concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid are about 30% of those in blood, and are strongly influenced by the body's chloride intake and metabolism.Goodman, L. S. and Gilman, A. (eds.) (1970) \\"Hypnotics and Sedatives\\", p. 121 in Chapter 10 in The Biological Basis of Therapeutics, Fourth Edition, The MacMillan Co., London. Since bromide is still used in veterinary medicine (particularly to treat seizures in dogs) in the United States, veterinary diagnostic labs can routinely measure blood bromide levels. However, this is not a conventional test in human medicine in the U.S., since there are no FDA- approved uses for bromide, and (as noted) it is no longer available in over- the-counter sedatives. Therapeutic bromide levels are measured in European countries like Germany, where bromide is still used therapeutically in human epilepsy. Chronic toxicity from bromide can result in bromism, a syndrome with multiple neurological symptoms. Bromide toxicity can also cause a type of skin eruption. See potassium bromide. Lithium bromide was used as a sedative beginning in the early 1900s, but it fell into disfavor in the 1940s, possibly due to the rising popularity of safer and more efficient sedatives (specifically, barbiturates) and when some heart patients died after using a salt substitute (see lithium chloride).Bipolar disorder. webmd.com Like lithium carbonate and lithium chloride it was used as treatment for bipolar disorder. It has been said that during World War I, British soldiers were given bromide to curb their sexual urges,Tanaka, Yuki (2002) Japan's Comfort Women: Sexual slavery and prostitution during World War II and the US Occupation, Routledge, p. 175. . although this is not well supported by documentation, and has been disputed as an urban myth, because the sedative effects of bromide would have hampered military performance. Lord Dunsany mentions a soldier being given bromide as a sedative for nervous exhaustion and overwork in his play Fame and the Poet (1919). There are more substantiated reports that bromide was used in the food served at some concentration camps during the Holocaust. This was apparently done in an effort to both chemically restrain the interned and prevent menstruation in women.Jackson, ‚ÄúThe Coming of Age‚Äù in Women and the Holocaust, eds Rittter & Roth, p. 80. In biology According to one study, bromine (as bromide) is an essential cofactor in the peroxidasin catalysis of sulfilimine crosslinks in collagen IV. This post-translational modification occurs in all animals, and bromine is an essential trace element for humans. Bromide is needed by eosinophils (white blood cells of the granulocyte class, specialized for dealing with multi-cellular parasites), which use it to generate antiparasitic brominating compounds such as hypobromite, by the action of eosinophil peroxidase, a haloperoxidase enzyme which is able to use chloride, but preferentially uses bromide when available. Other than its role in collagen IV production and its facultative use in eosinophils by the body, bromide is not known in other cases necessary for animal life, as its functions may generally be replaced (though in some cases not as well) by chloride. Land plants do not use bromide. Bromide salts are also sometimes used in hot tubs and spas as mild germicidal agents, using the action of an added oxidizing agent to generate in situ hypobromite, in a similar fashion to the peroxidase in eosinophils. Bromide is perhaps a minor necessary nutrient for collagen IV- producing animals in the sea. However, a few sea animals, such as Murex snails, use bromide to make organic compounds. Bromide ion is also heavily concentrated by some species of ocean algae, which construct methyl bromide and a great number of bromoorganic compounds with it, using the unusual enzymes called vanadium bromoperoxidases to do these reactions. The average concentration of bromide in human blood in Queensland, Australia is and varies with age and gender. Much higher levels may indicate exposure to brominated chemicals (e.g. methyl bromide). However, since bromide occurs in relatively high concentration in seawater and many types of seafood, bromide concentrations in the blood are heavily influenced by seafood contributions to the diet.

By the end of the century, they were widely used both for specific indications like epilepsy, convulsions, and insomnia, and even for \\"general nervousness\\". Sodium bromide was used in remedies such as Bromo-Seltzer that were popular for headaches and hangovers, in part due to the sedative effects. In April 1906, the American humorist Gelett Burgess published an essay in The Smart Set called \\"The Sulphitic Theory\\". In this essay, he used \\"bromide\\" to characterize a sedate, dull person who said boring things. In the fall of 1906, he published a revised and enlarged essay in the form of a small book.

DSU is one of eight publicly funded universities in the state. History The school was established in 1924 by the State of Mississippi, using the facilities of the former Bolivar County Agricultural High School, which consisted of three buildings in Cleveland. On February 19, 1924, Senators William B. Roberts and Arthur Marshall cosponsored Senate Bill No. 236, which established Delta State Teachers College, which Mississippi Governor Henry L. Whitfield signed on April 9, 1924; the bill had been sponsored in the Mississippi House of Representatives by Nellie Nugent Somerville, the first woman to serve in the Mississippi state legislature. The three buildings were Hill Hall, an administration and classroom building, Hardee Hall, a men's dormitory, and Taylor Hall, a women's dormitory. On February 14, 1924, James Wesley Broom was appointed president of the college, and the college opened its doors on September 15, 1925. In May 1926, Broom died following complications from an ear infection. William Zeigel was named his successor. The seal of the college was designed in 1928 as a project of an art class. World War II greatly affected the college. Anticipating the war in 1941, the college created a civilian pilot training program. When the war began, 254 Delta State students joined the armed forces. When the war ended, student enrollment at Delta State increased from 185 to 483, aided by the federal program for veterans known as the GI Bill to encourage education. During the 1947 session of the Delta Council, Dean Acheson (Under-Secretary of State in Truman's administration) delivered a speech on campus that unveiled the Marshall Plan. He detailed plans for postwar relief and investment in Europe to help the nations recover from destruction. In 1955, the name Delta State Teachers College was changed to Delta State College. Delta State earned full accreditation from the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools in 1963. It developed graduate programs, which it opened for admission in 1965. Given graduate program and research development, in 1974 the state legislature authorized the college to be named as the current Delta State University. In 1965 Delta State initiated a graduate program (Master of Education in Elementary Education, Elementary Supervision, Guidance, English, History, Math, Music, Social Studies, Business Education, Physical Education, and Science). From 1925 to 1967 the university had a White-only race admission policy. Twelve years after the US Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education (1954), ruling that racial segregation in public schools was unconstitutional and three years after passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the state and administration ended racial segregation at DSU. Shirley Antoinette Washington was the first African-American student to enroll at DSU that year. Beginning in the 1980s, the university developed an aviation program, which continues. In 2005 Delta State assisted evacuees from Hurricane Katrina by opening Hugh White Hall as temporary housing.

Most of the 64 buildings on campus use a particular brick pattern of yellow, orange, and white bricks. Particularly famous facilities at Delta State University are the large natatorium for holding swimming competitions, the Bologna Performing Arts Center (pictured left) with two theaters (one that seats 1,178, and another that seats 135), and the sound recording studios of the Delta Music Institute. Mascots Delta State has two mascots (one official, one unofficial). Since its inception, Delta State's sports teams have officially been known as the Statesmen because of the role State Rep. Walter Sillers, Jr. played in the location of the school in Cleveland. Sillers was speaker of the Mississippi House of Representatives for 20 years. The female teams are called the Lady Statesmen. However, since the late 1980s, the student body has embraced a mascot that depicts a piece of okra wearing boxing gloves and brandishing a fierce expression. The \\"Fighting Okra\\" grew out of humor among students about the improbability that anyone would find a \\"Statesman\\" particularly frightening. In the mid-1990s, a student vote was taken, resulting in the university taking on \\"The Fighting Okra\\" as an unofficial mascot. The \\"Fighting Okra\\" was featured in the \\"Okraphobia\\" episode of the Food Network show Good Eats.\\"Delta State's Okra mascot to appear on Food Network's Good Eats\\" The popularity of \\"The Fighting Okra\\" grew so much that many myths started on how the mascot came to be, the most popular of these stating there was a stubborn okra plant at first base on the baseball field that grew back every time it was cut. The true origin of the fighting okra mascot was a discussion between basketball and baseball players in the \\"Court of Governors\\" dormitory. The Statesman mascot was temporarily prohibited from participating in athletic activities after a physical altercation with the Mississippi College's Choctaw mascot at a basketball game. Basketball player Houston Williamson was lamenting the fact that \\"Fighting Statesmen\\" was not particularly frightening to their opponents. All present agreed that an alternative mascot would have to be mean and green. After a lively discussion and many suggestions, baseball pitcher Bob Black suggested that okra was green, fuzzy, and tough. The DSU baseball team began using the chant \\"Okra! Okra! Okra! Okra!\\" at DSU basketball games. Academics Delta State provides an undergraduate curriculum, offering 12 baccalaureate degrees in 42 majors. The university also advances student training through certain fields by providing graduate programs of study for eight master's degrees, the Education Specialist degree, and the Doctor of Education degree. * College of Arts and Sciences * College of Business * College of Education * School of Nursing Athletics The Delta State football team in action against the Texas A&M;‚ÄìCommerce Lions in 2013 The Delta State University Department of Athletics sponsors thirteen intercollegiate sports, competing at the NCAA Division II level. DSU is affiliated with the Gulf South Conference and New South Intercollegiate Swim Conference. The institution competes intercollegiately in men's American football, basketball, baseball, swimming, diving, tennis, soccer, and golf. The women's intercollegiate program consists of basketball, tennis, fast-pitch softball, cross-country, swimming, soccer, cheerleading, and diving.Athletics on DSU website One of Delta State's most notable sports coaches was (Lily) Margaret Wade (1912‚Äì1995). Wade played on the basketball team for Delta State, but the school dropped the sport when she was 19. The school claimed the sport was \\"too strenuous for young ladies\\". Wade responded, \\"We cried and burned our uniforms but there was nothing else we could do.\\" Basketball was revived in 1973, and Wade was asked to coach the team. She coached the women's basketball team to three consecutive AIAW national championships and a 93‚Äì4 record, including a 51-game winning streak, at the time, the longest winning streak in women's college basketball. Wade was elected to the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1985. Today, the Division I women's basketball player of the year receives the Margaret Wade Trophy. Lloyd Clark, a native of Drew, took over the women's basketball program in 1983. Over the next 19 years he compiled a staggering 494‚Äì98 record. In addition, Clark's teams won three NCAA Women's Division II Basketball Championships. During those years, DSU played in the NCAA tournament 16 times, with 11 appearances in the Elite Eight. Clark's 1988‚Äì89 team became the first NCAA team to win a National Championship on its home floor. During his career, Clark compiled a record of 206‚Äì38 (.845) in Gulf South Conference Games. Lloyd Clark is a member of the Mississippi Sports Hall of Fame along with other DSU heroes Margaret Wade, Lusia Harris-Stewart, and former Boston Red Sox pitcher Dave \\"Boo\\" Ferriss. Ferriss coached the baseball program for nearly thirty years and led them to three appearances in the NCAA Division II College World Series before retiring in 1988. Boo was born in Shaw, Mississippi. San Francisco Giants catcher Eli Whiteside played baseball for the University, as did Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Brent Leach. Matt Miller of the Cleveland Indians also played for the Statesmen. One notable would-be baseball player and student who was cut during tryouts was writer John Grisham.Delte State University In 2008, Grisham returned to the campus to join Ferriss in an evening of baseball tales, raising more than $100,000 for the athletic program. Delta State alumnus Jeremy Richardson was an NBA player. Delta State won the 2004 NCAA Division II national baseball championship. Coach Mike Kinnison has guided the Statesmen to the 2004 NCAA National title, four College World Series appearances, nine NCAA South Regional appearances (1999‚Äì2005, 2007, 2008), 11 GSC West Division titles (1997‚Äì2005, 2007, 2008), three NCAA South Regional championships, and four Gulf South Conference titles. Delta State won the 2000 NCAA Division II national football championship. Delta State's football team won the Gulf South Conference Championship in 1998, 2000, 2007, 2008, 2010, 2011, and 2014. They were runner-up in the D-2 National Championship in 2010. They were put out in the 4th round of the playoffs in 2011.

Greek life Even though Delta State University has relatively few fraternities and sororities on campus, many students participate in Greek life. Originally, Delta State had only local organizations, such as Delta Alpha Omega or the Cavaliers, which existed until the mid-1960s, when their members joined Kappa Alpha Order and Pi Kappa Alpha respectively.The Broom However, the first national social fraternity to charter at Delta State was Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia, in 1960.

The song was produced by Dupri and Cox for Usher's fourth studio album, Confessions (2004). Originally planned as the album's lead single, \\"Burn\\" was pushed back after favorable responses for the song \\"Yeah!\\". \\"Burn\\" was released as the second single from the album on March 21, 2004. \\"Burn\\" topped various charts around the world, including the Billboard Hot 100 for eight non-consecutive weeks; it succeeded \\"Yeah!\\" at number one. Both singles gave Usher nineteen consecutive weeks at the top spot, longer than any solo artist of the Hot 100 era. \\"Burn\\" was certified platinum in Australia and United States, and gold in New Zealand. The song was well received by critics and garnered award nominations. In 2009 it was named the 21st most successful song of the 2000s, on the Billboard Hot 100 Songs of the Decade. This song won the 2005 Kids' Choice Award for Favorite Song. Background When Usher planned to make a new record after his third album, 8701 (2001), he decided to not branch out much with collaborators and continue building music with his previous producers. Usher again enlisted record-producer Jermaine Dupri, who had collaborated on his two previous albums, along with The Neptunes and R. Kelly, among others, to work on his fourth studio album, Confessions (2004). Dupri contacted his frequent collaborator Bryan-Michael Cox, who had also made hits like the 2001 single \\"U Got It Bad\\" for Usher. During an early session for the album, Dupri and Cox talked about a situation which later became \\"Burn\\". At that time, Usher's two- year relationship with TLC's Chilli was flaming out. They said, \\"Yo, you gotta let that burn ... That's a song right there\\", and started writing. Release Usher submitted the album to his label Arista Records after he felt it was completed. After he and the company's then-president Antonio \\"LA\\" Reid listened to the songs, they felt the album needed a first single and that they needed to create one or two more songs, which caused the album's release to be postponed. Usher went back to the studio and collaborated with Lil Jon, who said, \\"He needed a single. They had 'Burn,' 'Burn' was hot, but they needed that first powerful monster. That's when I came in.\\" They worked on few more tracks, including \\"Red Light\\", which was not included in the first release of the album, and \\"Yeah!\\", which features Ludacris and Lil Jon. Label personnel were undecided as to what to consider as the lead single. Reid was considering whether \\"Yeah!\\" would be released then, being as they also had \\"Burn\\". Usher was doubtful if the former was the right choice, after he wanted an R&B; record. Until \\"Yeah!\\" was leaked, \\"Burn\\" was chosen as the official first single from Confessions. \\"Yeah!\\", which was intended as a promotional song and a teaser for Usher's fans, was released to street DJs and mixtapes. However, the favorable response to the song led to a change; \\"Yeah!\\" was the lead single and \\"Burn\\" was set as its follow-up. \\"Burn\\" was released in the United States on March 21, 2004 as a CD single, Digital Download and 7\\" single. Lyrical interpretation Usher decided about the new material \\"to let it all hang out by singing about some of his own little secrets, as well as a few bones from his homies' skeleton-filled closets.\\" The public speculated that he was referring to his recent personal struggles, on which he promised a \\"real talk\\". In early 2004, Usher broke up with Chilli due to \\"irreconcilable differences and because they found it almost impossible to make compromises.\\" Usher said in an interview: \\"It's unfortunate when you have to let a situation go because it's not working\\", which added reference to the breakup. It was later revealed that Chilli in fact broke up with Usher because of cheating, and the media said otherwise because of the lyrics in the song, which was not based on their relationship. Dupri, however, confessed that his personal life is the real story of the album. Usher said he took inspiration collectively by looking at his friends' personal situations. Composition \\"Burn\\" is a slow jam R&B; ballad. The song is performed with a moderate groove. It is composed in the key of C-sharp major. The melody line of the song has influences from \\"Ignition (Remix)\\" by R. Kelly and \\"How to Deal\\" by Frankie J. \\"Burn\\" has a combination of robotic noises, synthesized strings and guitar lines. The lyrics are constructed in the traditional verse-chorus form. The song starts with a spoken intro, giving way to the first verse. It continues to the chorus, following the second verse and chorus. The bridge follows, leading to a break and finalizing in the chorus. \\"Burn\\" was considered a \\"window to Usher's inner thoughts\\", along with the controversial track \\"Confessions\\" and \\"Confessions Part II\\". The song is about breakups and ending relationships. According to Matt Cibula of Popmatters, \\"Burn\\" is constructed from \\"two-step concept\\". In the lyrics \\"You know that it's over / You know that it was through / Let it burn / Got to let it burn\\", Usher breaks up with his woman but found her sad about feeling bad about what happened to their relationship. However, Usher says that she must deal with it before she can accept the truth. For the lines \\"It's been fifty-eleven days / Umpteen hours / I'm gonna be burnin' / Till you return\\", the direction changes after Usher realized that breaking up with her was a huge mistake and that he wanted her back. Critical reception \\"Burn\\" was lauded by contemporary music critics. Jem Aswad of Entertainment Weekly complimented Dupri and Cox for producing what he called the \\"best song\\" from the album, along with \\"Confessions Part II\\", which they also produced. Aswad said the songs feature \\"mellifluous melodies\\". Laura Sinagra of Rolling Stone found Usher's singing a \\"sweet falsetto on the weepy breakup song \\", adding, it \\"convincingly marries resolve and regret, but when it comes to rough stuff, there's still no 'u' in p-i-m-p.\\" Cibula called the song brilliant and considers its step one and step two technique a hit. Jon Caramanica of Blender complimented the song for being the only \\"serviceable\\" track among all ballad-influenced songs in the album which \\"often drown in their own inanity.\\" Ande Kellman of Allmusic considered \\"Burn\\" as one of the Usher's best moments in the album, together with \\"Caught Up\\", the final single from Confessions. Steve Jones of USA Today stated that Usher is singing about a relationship that cannot be saved because of the \\"flame has simply died\\". \\"Burn\\" was nominated at the 47th Grammy Awards for Best Male R&B; Vocal Performance and Best R&B; Song. The song earned British record company EMI the \\"Publisher of the Year\\" at the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers 2005 Pop Music Awards. Chart performance \\"Burn\\" was another commercial success for Usher. In the United States, the single debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 at number sixty-five, months prior to its physical release. It reached the top spot on May 29, 2004, replacing \\"Yeah!\\"'s twelve-week run at number one. The single was beaten by Fantasia's 2004 single \\"I Believe\\", which charted on its debut. It returned to number one for one last week, before it was finally knocked off by the album's third single, \\"Confessions Part II\\". The single failed to remain on the top spot as long as \\"Yeah!\\" did, staying only for eight non-consecutive weeks. \\"Burn\\" was the fifth most-played song in 2004 for earning 355,228 total plays, alongside \\"Yeah!\\" which topped the tally with 496,805 plays. The single was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for shipping 1,000,000 units. It became the second best-selling single in the United States, behind Usher's single \\"Yeah!\\" This gives him the distinction, alongside The Beatles in 1964, to have two of his singles occupying the top two spots on the Billboard Year- End Chart. Like \\"Yeah!\\", \\"Burn\\" helped Confessions remain on the top spot. Internationally, several music markets responded equally well. In the United Kingdom, the single debuted at number one and stayed for two weeks. Across European countries, the single performed well, reaching the top ten in Denmark, Ireland, Norway, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. It entered the top twenty in Austria, Belgium, Germany and Sweden. In Australia, the single debuted at number three and peaked at number two. The single was certified 2x platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association for selling 140,000 units. In the 2004 year ender charts, \\"Burn\\" became the thirty-first best- selling single in Australia. In New Zealand, it peaked at number one for three weeks, and remained on the charts for twenty-three weeks. The single was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of New Zealand.  Music video =Background The music video for \\"Burn\\" was directed by Jake Nava, who had produced a wide array of videos for Atomic Kitten, Beyonc√© Knowles, among others. It was shot at the former Hollywood house of American popular singer Frank Sinatra. The video features model Jessica Clark. In the July 2008 issue of Vibe magazine, Usher told writer Mitzi Miller, \\"Women have started to become lovers of each other as a result of not having enough men.\\" On June 26, 2008, AfterEllen.com writer Sarah Warn revealed that Jessica Clark, the lead in Usher's \\"Burn\\" music video, was in fact an openly gay model. In the article, Warn writes, \\"Maybe it's not a lack of men that's turning women gay, Usher--maybe it's you!\\" Synopsis and reception Usher dancing in front of an Aston Martin DB5, while the scenery is set aflame The video starts with Usher sitting on a sofa with a backdrop of his girlfriend. When the verse starts, Usher goes to a wide glass window pane, looking at his girlfriend swimming in the pool. The surface is aflame after she is immersed in the water. In the next scene, Usher and his mistress are having sex. While sitting on the edge of the bed, Usher reminisces about the moments he and his girlfriend had have in the same bed. The bedsheets burn, the scene then cutting to Usher riding a silver right-hand drive Aston Martin DB5 with a British registration - EGF 158B (the car was featured in the TV series Fastlane). The video cuts with the backdrop also burning. Continuing to the car scene, Usher stops as he sees his imaginary girl again. He and dances, executing various hand routines. Video intercuts follow and the video ends with Usher standing. Right before the last chorus, the screen changes from a small screen to a full one with no framework. The music video debuted on MTV's Total Request Live at number six on May 4, 2004, debuting with \\"Confessions Part II\\". The video reached the top spot and remained on the countdown for thirty-three days. \\"Burn\\" topped MuchMusic's Countdown on July 24, 2004, and remained on the chart for fifteen weeks. Impact Cox benefited from co- creating Confessions, as well as from the success of \\"Burn\\". He had previously contributed to records for Alicia Keys, B2K, Mariah Carey and Destiny's Child, but he felt 2004 introduced him to another landscape in the music industry. His contribution to this song elevated him to fame, and garnered more attention for his past work. \\"Burn\\" earned him two Grammy nominations. Cox said, \\"Everybody who does this for a living, dreams about being nominated. It's the ultimate accomplishment. I've always been the silent guy ‚Äî I come in, do my job and head out. I like to leave all the glory and shine to others, but this is the validation that means the most to me. It also makes me want to work harder to get that same recognition again.\\" Charts=Weekly charts {class=\\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text- align:center\\" - !scope=\\"col\\"Chart (2004‚Äì2005) !scope=\\"col\\"Peak position - !scope=\\"row\\" - !scope=\\"row\\" - !scope=\\"row\\" - !scope=\\"row\\" - !scope=\\"row\\" Canada CHR/Pop Top 30 (Radio & Records) 3 - !scope=\\"row\\" - !scope=\\"row\\" Europe (Eurochart Hot 100) 2 - !scope=\\"row\\" - !scope=\\"row\\" - !scope=\\"row\\" - !scope=\\"row\\" - !scope=\\"row\\" - !scope=\\"row\\" - !scope=\\"row\\" - !scope=\\"row\\" - !scope=\\"row\\" Romania (Romanian Top 100) 12 - !scope=\\"row\\" - !scope=\\"row\\" - !scope=\\"row\\" - !scope=\\"row\\" - !scope=\\"row\\" - !scope=\\"row\\" - !scope=\\"row\\" - !scope=\\"row\\" } Year-end charts {class=\\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center\\" - !scope=\\"col\\"Chart (2004) !scope=\\"col\\"Position - !scope=\\"row\\" Australia (ARIA) 31 - !scope=\\"row\\" Belgium (Ultratop 50 Flanders) 95 - !scope=\\"row\\" Germany (Official German Charts) 80 - !scope=\\"row\\" Netherlands (Dutch Top 40) 84 - !scope=\\"row\\" Netherlands (Single Top 100) 83 - !scope=\\"row\\" New Zealand (Recorded Music NZ) 7 - !scope=\\"row\\" Switzerland (Schweizer Hitparade) 63 - !scope=\\"row\\" UK Singles (Official Charts Company) 27 - !scope=\\"row\\" US Billboard Hot 100 2 - !scope=\\"row\\" US Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs (Billboard) 3 } {class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center\\" - !scope=\\"col\\"Chart (2005) !scope=\\"col\\"Position - !scope=\\"row\\" Romania (Romanian Top 100) 92 } Decade-end charts {class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text- align:center\\" - !scope=\\"col\\"Chart (2000‚Äì09) !scope=\\"col\\"Position - !scope=\\"row\\" US Billboard Hot 100 21 } All-time charts {class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center\\" - !

John Bradley, although he had been involved in only the first raising of a smaller flag hours before, was not involved in the second flag raising, Pfc. Ira Hayes, and Pfc. Rene Gagnon were the only survivors of the battle. Sgt. Michael Strank, Cpl. Harlon Block, and Pfc. Franklin Sousley were killed in action later on in the battle. The book and film tell the story in a before, during, and after format, and both were well received upon their release. An impromptu speech Bradley, who did not raise the flag, gave at the Marine Corps War Memorial (sometimes called the Iwo Jima memorial) was transcribed by Michael T. Powers in October 2000, and widely circulated on the Internet.\\"The Boys of Iwo Jima\\", speech by James Bradley, transcribed by Michael T. Powers. Online at Snopes.com. Also online at Michael T. Powers's site. On June 23, 2016, the United States Marine Corps identified Cpl. Harold Schultz as the sixth flag raiser for the second flag. In 2003, Bradley published Flyboys: A True Story of Courage. That book tells the story of an air raid that took place during the Battle of Iwo Jima, some 150 miles away, when United States warplanes bombed the small communications outpost on Chichi Jima. While Iwo Jima had Japanese forces numbering 22,000, Chichi Jima's forces numbered 25,000. Nine American crewmen survived after being shot down in the raid. One was picked up by the American submarine USS Finback. That was Lieutenant George H. W. Bush, who later went on to become the 41st President of the United States. The other eight were captured as POWs by the Japanese and were executed and eaten, a fact that remained hidden until much later. Like Flags of Our Fathers, Flyboys: A True Story of Courage also topped the New York Times Bestseller list when it came out. In 2009, he published his third New York Times best selling book, The Imperial Cruise. It concerns the 1905 diplomatic mission led by then-Secretary of War William Howard Taft and Alice Roosevelt, as well as the larger implications of President Theodore Roosevelt's foreign policy, particularly with regard to Japan. The New York Times published a complimentary review, writing that \\"The Imperial Cruise is startling enough to reshape conventional wisdom about Roosevelt's presidency.\\"\\"The Queasy Side of Theodore Roosevelt‚Äôs Diplomatic Voyage\\", by Janet Maslin, November 18, 2009. The book exposes the blatantly racist and exploitative policy of the United States in its attempt to extend its influence into the Pacific rim, acquiring Hawaii by conquest and the Philippines by purchase from the Spanish after ostensibly having entered the conflict to aid the Filipino freedom fighters. The American occupation was marked by torture and repression of the very people they had come to help. The China Mirage: The Hidden History of American Disaster in Asia is James' fourth book, detailing America's involvement in China since the early 19th Century during the heights of opium trade, through the conclusion of the Second World War and Mao Zedong's rise to power. The premise of the book is how the United States failed to understand Asian cultures that led to poor decision-making by policy makers in the US State Department as well as by both President Theodore Roosevelt and Franklin Roosevelt. Ultimately, Bradley makes the suggestion that the War in the Pacific, the Korean War and the Vietnam War would have been avoided had President Franklin Roosevelt not been unduly influenced by the China Lobby that supported Chiang Kai-shek.  Portrayal in film  James Bradley's father, John Bradley, is featured incorrectly as a flag raiser of the second flag in the 2006 Clint Eastwood movie Flags of Our Fathers, which was made a decade before new evidence showed he was not one of them, where he is played by American actor Ryan Phillippe. The movie is based on James Bradley's book of the same title. Works * Flags of Our Fathers (with Ron Powers).

They are depicted as superheroes and antiheroes. Paul KirkDan Richards The second Manhunter's first appearance was in the Quality Comics title Police Comics #8 (cover-date (March 1942) and his solo stories ended in issue #101 (Aug. 1950).Manhunter (Quality Comics) at Don Markstein's Toonopedia. Archived from the original on February 12, 2016. The Quality Comics characters were purchased by DC Comics when Quality went out of business in 1956. Dan Richards would eventually be featured in Young All-Stars and All-Star Squadron. His origin was retold in Secret Origins vol. 2, #22 (Jan. 1988). Donald \\"Dan\\" Richards attended the police academy with his girlfriend's brother, Jim, who was at the top of the class, while Dan was at the very bottom. After Jim was framed for a crime he didn't commit, Dan took up the identity of Manhunter to track down the actual killer. He caught the perpetrator and cleared Jim's name. Afterwards, he continued to operate as Manhunter. His sidekick was a dog named Thor, who was later retconned to be a robotic sentry operating under the auspices of the Manhunter cult.Secret Origins #22 According to Jess Nevins' Encyclopedia of Golden Age Superheroes, Manhunter's enemies include \\"ordinary criminals, Germans, the Nazi agent the Cobra, Dr. Sims (who has created telepathic brains-in-a-jar), the Ghostmaster, the whip-wielding female crime boss Red Kate, and the Spine-Snapper and his trained ape\\". Dan's granddaughter, Marcie Cooper, became the third Harlequin after he convinced her to join the Manhunters. Dan Richards was later killed by Mark Shaw, who had fallen back into his Dumas persona.Manhunter (vol. 3) #7 Mark ShawClone of Paul Kirk One of Paul Kirk's remaining clones, claiming the Manhunter identity and wearing Paul Kirk's Council-created uniform, masterminded the creation of the Secret Society of Super Villains. However, he died trying to kill Darkseid.Secret Society of Super-Villains #s 1‚Äì5, 1976‚Äì1977 Chase Lawler A new Manhunter title (by Steven Grant and Vince Giarrano), unrelated to any of the previous Manhunters, was created in the aftermath of the Zero Hour limited series in 1994. Chase Lawler was a musician who summoned the Wild Huntsman to save himself and his girlfriend from harm. He did not understand the commitment he was making to the Wild Huntsman and found himself compelled to hunt the lonely. He tried to resist the urge by hunting villains, with limited success. Lawler suffered a heart attack and Mark Shaw attempted to resuscitate him.Manhunter (vol. 2) #13 This transferred the bond with the Wild Huntsman and the compulsion to hunt to Shaw. It was later revealed that Lawler had undergone the same mental programming as Mark Shaw and that the Wild Huntsman was actually an illusion created as a side effect.Manhunter (vol. 3) #13 Lawler was drugged and then murdered by Shaw, who had fallen back into his Dumas persona.Manhunter (vol. 3) #10 Kirk DePaul Created by Kurt Busiek and Tom Grummett, the Kirk DePaul version of Manhunter was the last surviving Council-created clone of Paul Kirk and wore a variation of that Manhunter uniform. DePaul was roaming through Africa when his progenitor was killed. DePaul was a partner in the superhero-for-hire firm known as the Power Company. Fellow partner in the firm Skyrocket despised him for his miserly, materialistic attitude. DePaul's role in the Power Company attracted the attention of Asano Nitobe and Christine St. Clair, who confronted him.Power Company #5 They established that he was not evil and, although St. Clair continued watching DePaul, decided not to kill him. DePaul was later murdered and decapitated by Mark Shaw who had suffered a breakdown and resumed his Dumas persona.Manhunter (vol. 3) #11 Although never officially confirmed, it is strongly implied that DePaul was later resurrected by Morgaine le Fey as the character \\"Swashbuckler\\" in the comic book Trinity (2008‚Äì2009), a mercenary who shows all the skills of a Manhunter. Trinity writer Kurt Busiek (also the creator of Power Company and Kirk DePaul) confirmed that Swashbuckler is the only member of the Trinity series' villainous Dreambound that has been seen before in the DC Universe; \\"Swashbuckler is a pre-existing character, but not a Silver Age one. There are clues in the story that indicate who he is, though...\\"Posted by Kurt Busiek on the Comic Bloc Forums, August 4th, 2010. Also, in Trinity #27, Swashbuckler reveals a scar visible all around his neck.Trinity #27, February 2009. At the end of the Trinity series, the Dreambound including Swashbuckler switch to the side of the heroes, and are later pardoned in court. Their current whereabouts are unknown. Kate Spencer The current Manhunter, Kate Spencer, in the cover art for Manhunter (vol. 3), #4; art by Jae Lee. Kate Spencer, like Mark Shaw, is a lawyer, but instead works as a prosecutor. Outraged by the ability of supercriminals to escape justice, Spencer assembled a costume from a variety of devices left over from various heroes and villains. A Darkstar costume and Azrael's Batman gloves give Spencer enhanced strength, agility and resistance to injury while Mark Shaw's power staff allows her to fire bolts of energy. Spencer has taken on several minor league supervillains including Copperhead and the Shadow Thief. Recently Spencer fought her father, a minor league supervillain who erroneously claimed to be the son of Al Pratt ‚Äì the Golden Age Atom. Kate is in fact the granddaughter of Phantom Lady and Iron Munro. Al Pratt allowed Sandra Knight (the Phantom Lady) to use his contact information in order to enter a home for unwed mothers, which led to the mix- up. Most recently Kate Spencer, in her heroic identity as Manhunter, began working with the US government's Department of Extranormal Operations, headed by the former criminal Mister Bones. The new Manhunter series in which she appears began in 2004. This current series has featured appearances by Dan Richards, Mark Shaw, Chase Lawler, and Kirk DePaul. Manhunter was initially slated to be cancelled due to low sales. However, a massive and organized fan campaign, along with support from DC Comics' management, allowed for another five-issue arc to be commissioned. It was revealed at the 2007 New York Comic- Con by Dan DiDio that the series had been given a second reprieve from cancellation.Newsarama.com: NYCC '07: DC NATION PANEL Newsarama.com: WONDER CON '07: DC NATION PANEL The series was meant to be restarted in July 2007, but has been put on hold until several issues have been written and drawn before the title resumes publication.Newsarama.com: WONDERCON '08 ‚Äì DC NATION PANEL The series returned in June 2008 with issue #31, written by co-creator Marc Andreyko and pencilled by Michael Gaydos.Manhunter (Vol. 3) #31 It ended again in January 2009 with issue #38. Kate Spencer eventually joined the Birds of Prey, and her teammates were subsequently featured in a number of issues of the Manhunter series. Kate Spencer briefly relocated to Gotham City where she took up a position as the new District Attorney. Her first adventures in Gotham were chronicled in a back-up feature in Batman: Streets of Gotham. She later appeared in Justice Society of America, which saw Kate move to the city of Monument Point and join the JSA. Ramsey Robinson Ramsey Robinson is the son of Kate Spencer and her ex-husband, Peter Robinson. He is revealed to have super powers in Manhunter (vol. 3) #33 when the seven-year-old smashed a garbage truck while rescuing his dog.

The series was created by Linda Bloodworth-Thomason, who also served as executive producer alongside husband Harry Thomason and series star Robert Wagner. Premise James Culver (Wagner), a widower, raises his two daughters, Elizabeth (Smith) and Margaret Ann (Brewton) with his own father (Ayres) and investigates insurance cases with the British Edward Wingate (Standing). Production The cast of Lime Street included veteran Hollywood star Robert Wagner and Samantha Smith. Smith, a schoolgirl in Manchester, Maine, had written then-Soviet premier Yuri Andropov a letter asking him whether he was truly desirous of a nuclear war with the United States, as she had heard suggested by some. He wrote her a reply stating that he was not, and then invited her to visit the Soviet Union; the event, which was followed by media in both countries and elsewhere around the world, gained her fame. Two versions exist of how Smith was cast into the show: one story states that she had caught the attention of Bloodworth- Thomason in early 1985 when the latter's brother-in-law spotted her on a talk show and suggested that she might fit the role of the elder daughter in the series, at that time known as J.G. Culver. Another suggests that Wagner, who had first seen her on The Tonight Show, called her up, asking her to audition for the role. Three episodes and the pilot had been shot when Smith was killed on August 25, 1985, in the crash of a small plane belonging to Bar Harbor Airlines. Smith's death occurred prior to the airing of any of the programs, the premiere being on September 21. Although production continued, her role was never recast. Auditions were held instead for a new character, another daughter to Wagner's character, but the notion was entirely dropped. The plan had been for Smith's character, Elizabeth, to live on off-screen, moving to Paris to be with her divorced mother. The show was subsequently dedicated to Smith's memory. Critical reviews on Lime Street were not enamored of the program itself. Bill Kelley of the Sun-Sentinel said, \\"Apart from the fact that the pilot devotes a large volume of boring time to depicting Wagner's J.G. Culver character as a doting father, there is virtually nothing to separate Lime Street from such Wagner series as It Takes a Thief, Switch or Hart to Hart....The series pins its hopes squarely on the TV audience's fondness for the Wagner they have come to know over the years, rather than on plot turns or originality.\\" There was genuine praise for Smith's talents and acting ability in the few episodes she had completed. John Leonard of New York said \\"...Samantha was wonderful‚Äîgawky but sincere, life-loving, a saint with bangs....\\" However, the series had trouble finding much of an audience, mainly due to competition from NBC's Top 20 hits The Golden Girls and 227, both also debuting that same season. The fifth episode aired on ABC on October 26, 1985, after which the show was cancelled at the request of the producers, the episodes recorded after Smith's death having made them realize that going on with production had not been a wise decision. However, three then-unaired episodes were shown on the Lifetime network in 1987.

It was first presented on stage to the public in 1913. In ancient Greek mythology, Pygmalion fell in love with one of his sculptures, which then came to life. The general idea of that myth was a popular subject for Victorian era British playwrights, including one of Shaw's influences, W. S. Gilbert, who wrote a successful play based on the story called Pygmalion and Galatea that was first presented in 1871. Shaw would also have been familiar with the burlesque version, Galatea, or Pygmalion Reversed. Shaw's play has been adapted numerous times, most notably as the 1938 film Pygmalion, the 1956 musical My Fair Lady and its 1964 film version. Shaw mentioned that the character of Professor Henry Higgins was inspired by several British professors of phonetics: Alexander Melville Bell, Alexander J. Ellis, Tito Pagliardini, but above all, the cantankerous Henry Sweet.George Bernard Shaw, Androcles and the Lion: Overruled : Pygmalion (New York City: Brentano's, 1918), page 109. (Note: Alexander M. Bell's first wife was named Eliza.) First productions A Sketch Magazine illustration of Mrs. Patrick Campbell as Eliza Doolittle from 22 April 1914. Shaw wrote the part of Eliza expressly for Campbell, who played opposite Herbert Beerbohm Tree as Henry Higgins. After creating the role of Col. Pickering in the London production, Philip Merivale (second from right) played Henry Higgins opposite Mrs. Patrick Campbell (right) when Pygmalion was taken to Broadway (1914) Shaw wrote the play in early 1912 and read it to famed actress Mrs. Patrick Campbell in June. She came on board almost immediately, but her mild nervous breakdown contributed to the delay of a London production. Pygmalion premiered at the Hofburg Theatre in Vienna on 16 October 1913, in a German translation by Shaw's Viennese literary agent and acolyte, Siegfried Trebitsch.Shaw, Bernard, edited by Samuel A. Weiss (1986). Bernard Shaw's Letters to Siegfried Trebitsch. Stanford, Calif.: Stanford University Press. , p.164. Its first New York production opened on 24 March 1914 at the German-language Irving Place Theatre.\\"Herr G.B. Shaw at the Irving Place.\\" The New York Times 25 March 1914. In late 1914 Mrs Campbell took the London company to tour the United States, opening in New York at the Belasco Theatre. It opened in London on 11 April 1914, at Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree's His Majesty's Theatre and starred Mrs. Campbell as Eliza and Tree as Higgins, running for 118 performances. Shaw directed the actors through tempestuous rehearsals often punctuated by at least one of the two storming out of the theatre in a rage.Dent, Alan (1961). Mrs. Patrick Campbell. London: Museum Press Limited. Plot George Orwell claimed that \\"The central plot of Shaw's play, Pygmalion, is lifted out of Peregrine Pickle [by Smollett], and I believe that no one has ever pointed this out in print, which suggests that few people have read the book.\\" (\\"As I Please\\" TRIBUNE July 7, 1944) Act One A group of people are sheltering from the rain. Among them are the Eynsford-Hills, superficial social climbers eking out a living in \\"genteel poverty\\", consisting initially of Mrs. Eynsford-Hill and her daughter Clara. Clara's brother Freddy enters having earlier been dispatched to secure them a cab (which they can ill-afford), but being rather timid and faint-hearted he has failed to do so. As he goes off once again to find a cab, he bumps into a flower girl, Eliza. Her flowers drop into the mud of Covent Garden, the flowers she needs to survive in her poverty-stricken world. Shortly, they are joined by a gentleman, Colonel Pickering. While Eliza tries to sell flowers to the Colonel, a bystander informs her that a man is writing down everything she says. The man is Henry Higgins, a professor of phonetics. Eliza worries that Higgins is a police officer and will not calm down until Higgins introduces himself. It soon becomes apparent that he and Colonel Pickering have a shared interest in phonetics; indeed, Pickering has come from India to meet Higgins, and Higgins was planning to go to India to meet Pickering. Higgins tells Pickering that he could pass off the flower girl as a duchess merely by teaching her to speak properly. These words of bravado spark an interest in Eliza, who would love to make changes in her life and become more mannerly, even though, to her, it only means working in a flower shop. At the end of the act, Freddy returns after finding a taxi, only to find that his mother and sister have gone and left him with the cab. The streetwise Eliza takes the cab from him, using the money that Higgins tossed to her, leaving him on his own.  Act Two  Lynn Fontanne (Eliza) and Henry Travers (Alfred Doolittle) in the Theatre Guild production of Pygmalion (1926) Higgins' home ‚Äì the next day As Higgins demonstrates his phonetics to Pickering, the housekeeper Mrs. Pearce, tells him that a young girl wants to see him. Eliza has shown up because she wishes to talk like a lady in a flower shop. She tells Higgins that she will pay for lessons. He shows no interest, but she reminds him of his boast the previous day. Higgins claimed that he could pass her for a duchess. Pickering makes a bet with him on his claim, and says that he will pay for her lessons if Higgins succeeds. She is sent off to have a bath. Mrs. Pearce tells Higgins that he must behave himself in the young girl's presence, meaning he must stop swearing, and improve his table manners, but he is at a loss to understand why she should find fault with him. Alfred Doolittle, Eliza's father, appears with the sole purpose of getting money out of Higgins, having no paternal interest in his daughter's welfare. He sees himself as a member of the undeserving poor, and means to go on being undeserving. With his intelligent mind untamed by education, he has an eccentric view of life. He is also aggressive, and when Eliza, on her return, sticks her tongue out at him, he goes to hit her, but is prevented by Pickering. The scene ends with Higgins telling Pickering that they really have got a difficult job on their hands. Act Three Mrs. Higgins' drawing room Higgins bursts in and tells his mother he has picked up a \\"common flower girl\\" whom he has been teaching. Mrs. Higgins is not very impressed with her son's attempts to win her approval because it is her 'at home' day and she is entertaining visitors. The visitors are the Eynsford- Hills. Higgins is rude to them on their arrival. Eliza enters and soon falls into talking about the weather and her family. Whilst she is now able to speak in beautifully modulated tones, the substance of what she says remains unchanged from the gutter. She confides her suspicions that her aunt was killed by relatives, and mentions that gin had been \\"mother's milk\\" to this aunt, and that Eliza's own father was always more cheerful after a goodly amount of gin. Higgins passes off her remarks as \\"the new small talk\\", and Freddy is enraptured. When she is leaving, he asks her if she is going to walk across the park, to which she replies, \\"Walk? Not bloody likely!\\" (This is the most famous line from the play, and, for many years after the play's debut, use of the word 'bloody' was known as a pygmalion; Mrs. Campbell was considered to have risked her career by speaking the line on stage.The Truth About Pygmalion by Richard Huggett, 1969 Random House, pp. 127‚Äì128) After she and the Eynsford-Hills leave, Henry asks for his mother's opinion. She says the girl is not presentable and is very concerned about what will happen to her, but neither Higgins nor Pickering understands her thoughts of Eliza's future, and leave feeling confident and excited about how Eliza will get on. This leaves Mrs. Higgins feeling exasperated, and exclaiming, \\"Men! Men!! Men!!!\\" Act Four Higgins' home ‚Äì midnight Higgins, Pickering, and Eliza have returned from a ball. A tired Eliza sits unnoticed, brooding and silent, while Pickering congratulates Higgins on winning the bet. Higgins scoffs and declares the evening a \\"silly tomfoolery\\", thanking God it's over and saying that he had been sick of the whole thing for the last two months. Still barely acknowledging Eliza beyond asking her to leave a note for Mrs. Pearce regarding coffee, the two retire to bed. Higgins returns to the room, looking for his slippers, and Eliza throws them at him. Higgins is taken aback, and is at first completely unable to understand Eliza's preoccupation, which aside from being ignored after her triumph is the question of what she is to do now. When Higgins does understand he makes light of it, saying she could get married, but Eliza interprets this as selling herself like a prostitute. \\"We were above that at the corner of Tottenham Court Road.\\" Finally she returns her jewelry to Higgins, including the ring he had given her, which he throws into the fireplace with a violence that scares Eliza. Furious with himself for losing his temper, he damns Mrs. Pearce, the coffee and then Eliza, and finally himself, for \\"lavishing\\" his knowledge and his \\"regard and intimacy\\" on a \\"heartless guttersnipe\\", and retires in great dudgeon. Eliza roots around in the fireplace and retrieves the ring. Act Five Mrs. Higgins' drawing room ‚Äì the next morning Higgins and Pickering, perturbed by the discovery that Eliza has walked out on them, call on Mrs. Higgins to phone the police. Higgins is particularly distracted, since Eliza had assumed the responsibility of maintaining his diary and keeping track of his possessions, which causes Mrs. Higgins to decry their calling the police as though Eliza were \\"a lost umbrella\\". Doolittle is announced; he emerges dressed in splendid wedding attire and is furious with Higgins, who after their previous encounter had been so taken with Doolittle's unorthodox ethics that he had recommended him as the \\"most original moralist in England\\" to a rich American founding Moral Reform Societies; the American had subsequently left Doolittle a pension worth three thousand pounds a year, as a consequence of which Doolittle feels intimidated into joining the middle class and marrying his missus. Mrs. Higgins observes that this at least settles the problem of who shall provide for Eliza, to which Higgins objects ‚Äì after all, he paid Doolittle five pounds for her. Mrs. Higgins informs her son that Eliza is upstairs, and explains the circumstances of her arrival, alluding to how marginalised and overlooked Eliza felt the previous night. Higgins is unable to appreciate this, and sulks when told that he must behave if Eliza is to join them. Doolittle is asked to wait outside. Eliza enters, at ease and self-possessed. Higgins blusters but Eliza isn't shaken and speaks exclusively to Pickering. Throwing Higgins' previous insults back at him (\\"Oh, I'm only a squashed cabbage leaf\\"), Eliza remarks that it was only by Pickering's example that she learned to be a lady, which renders Higgins speechless. Eliza goes on to say that she has completely left behind the flower girl she was, and that she couldn't utter any of her old sounds if she tried ‚Äì at which point Doolittle emerges from the balcony, causing Eliza to relapse totally into her gutter speech. Higgins is jubilant, jumping up and crowing over her. Doolittle explains his situation and asks if Eliza will come with him to his wedding. Pickering and Mrs. Higgins also agree to go, and leave with Doolittle and Eliza to follow. The scene ends with another confrontation between Higgins and Eliza. Higgins asks if Eliza is satisfied with the revenge she has brought thus far and if she will now come back, but she refuses. Higgins defends himself from Eliza's earlier accusation by arguing that he treats everyone the same, so she shouldn't feel singled out. Eliza replies that she just wants a little kindness, and that since he will never stop to show her this, she will not come back, but will marry Freddy. Higgins scolds her for such low ambitions: he has made her \\"a consort for a king.\\" When she threatens to teach phonetics and offer herself as an assistant to Nepommuck, Higgins again loses his temper and promises to wring her neck if she does so. Eliza realises that this last threat strikes Higgins at the very core and that it gives her power over him; Higgins, for his part, is delighted to see a spark of fight in Eliza rather than her erstwhile fretting and worrying. He remarks \\"I like you like this\\", and calls her a \\"pillar of strength\\". Mrs. Higgins returns and she and Eliza depart for the wedding. As they leave, Higgins incorrigibly gives Eliza a number of errands to run, as though their recent conversation had not taken place. Eliza disdainfully explains why they are unnecessary and wonders what Higgins is going to do without her (in another version, Eliza disdainfully tells him to do the errands himself; Mrs. Higgins says that she'll get the items, but Higgins cheerfully tells her that Eliza will do it after all). Higgins laughs to himself at the idea of Eliza marrying Freddy as the play ends. Critical reception The play was well received by critics in major cities following its premieres in Vienna, London, and New York. The initial release in Vienna garnered several reviews describing the show as a positive departure from Shaw's usual dry and didactic style. The Broadway premiere in New York was praised in terms of both plot and acting, described as \\"a love story with brusque diffidence and a wealth of humor.\\" Reviews of the production in London were slightly less unequivocally positive, with the Telegraph noting that the play was deeply diverting with interesting mechanical staging, although the critic ultimately found the production somewhat shallow and overly lengthy. The London Times, however, praised both the characters and actors (especially Sir Herbert Tree as Higgins and Mrs. Patrick Campbell as Eliza) and the happy if \\"unconventional\\" ending. Ending Pygmalion was the most broadly appealing of all Shaw's plays. But popular audiences, looking for pleasant entertainment with big stars in a West End venue, wanted a \\"happy ending\\" for the characters they liked so well, as did some critics.Evans, T.F. (ed.) (1997). George Bernard Shaw (The Critical Heritage Series). , pp. 223‚Äì30. During the 1914 run, to Shaw's exasperation but not to his surprise, Tree sought to sweeten Shaw's ending to please himself and his record houses.\\"From the Point of View of A Playwright,\\" by Bernard Shaw, collected in Herbert Beerbohm Tree, Some Memories of Him and His Art, Collected by Max Beerbohm (1919). London: Hutchinson. Versions at Text Archive Internet Archive Shaw returned for the 100th performance and watched Higgins, standing at the window, toss a bouquet down to Eliza. \\"My ending makes money; you ought to be grateful,\\" protested Tree, to which Shaw replied, \\"Your ending is damnable; you ought to be shot.\\"Shaw, Bernard, edited by Dan H. Laurence. Collected Letters vol. III: 1911‚Äì1925.Shaw‚ÄìCampbell Correspondence, p. 160. Shaw's \\"Final Orders\\" letter to Mrs. Campbell on the first night. He wrote to his wife the next day that the audience's wild appreciation of the third act ‚Äì which he had warned the actors would happen ‚Äì impelled Tree instinctively to begin playing to please the house, much to Shaw's disgust but to the play's guaranteed popular success. Collected Letters, vol. III. The same day he withdrew his recommendation to Lee Shubert that Tree be included in an American tour. Shaw remained sufficiently irritated to add a postscript essay, \\"'What Happened Afterwards,\\"Shaw, G.B. (1916). Pygmalion. New York: Brentano. Sequel: What Happened Afterwards. Bartleby: Great Books Online. to the 1916 print edition for inclusion with subsequent editions, in which he explained precisely why it was impossible for the story to end with Higgins and Eliza getting married. He continued to protect what he saw as the play's, and Eliza's, integrity by protecting the last scene. For at least some performances during the 1920 revival, Shaw adjusted the ending in a way that underscored the Shavian message. In an undated note to Mrs. Campbell he wrote, > When Eliza emancipates herself ‚Äì when Galatea comes to life ‚Äì she must not > relapse. She must retain her pride and triumph to the end. When Higgins > takes your arm on 'consort battleship' you must instantly throw him off with > implacable pride; and this is the note until the final 'Buy them yourself.' > He will go out on the balcony to watch your departure; come back > triumphantly into the room; exclaim 'Galatea!' (meaning that the statue has > come to life at last); and ‚Äì curtain. Thus he gets the last word; and you > get it too.\\"The Instinct of An Artist: Shaw and the Theatre.\\" Catalog for > \\"An Exhibition from The Bernard F. Burgunder Collection,\\" 1997. Cornell > University Library (This ending, however, is not included in any print version of the play.) Shaw fought against a Higgins-Eliza happy-end pairing as late as 1938. He sent the 1938 film version's producer, Gabriel Pascal, a concluding sequence which he felt offered a fair compromise: a tender farewell scene between Higgins and Eliza, followed by one showing Freddy and Eliza happy in their greengrocery- flower shop. Only at the sneak preview did he learn that Pascal had finessed the question of Eliza's future with a slightly ambiguous final scene in which Eliza returns to the house of a sadly musing Higgins and self-mockingly quotes her previous self announcing, \\"I washed my face and hands before I come, I did\\". Different versions First American (serialized) publication, Everybody's Magazine, November 1914 There are two main versions of the play in circulation. One is based on the earlier version, first published in 1914; the other is a later version that includes several sequences revised by Shaw, first published in 1941. Therefore, different editions of the play omit or add certain lines. For instance, the Project Gutenberg version published online, which is transcribed from an early version, does not include Eliza's exchange with Mrs. Pearce in Act II, the scene with Nepommuck in Act III, or Higgins' famous declaration to Eliza, \\"Yes, you squashed cabbage-leaf, you disgrace to the noble architecture of these columns, you incarnate insult to the English language! I could pass you off as the Queen of Sheba!\\" ‚Äì a line so famous that it is now retained in nearly all productions of the play, including the 1938 film version of Pygmalion as well as in the stage and film versions of My Fair Lady. The co-director of the 1938 film, Anthony Asquith, had seen Mrs. Campbell in the 1920 revival of Pygmalion and noticed that she spoke the line, \\"It's my belief as how they done the old woman in.\\" He knew \\"as how\\" was not in Shaw's text, but he felt it added color and rhythm to Eliza's speech, and liked to think that Mrs. Campbell had ad libbed it herself. Eighteen years later he added it to Wendy Hiller's line in the film. In the original play Eliza's test is met at an ambassador's garden party, offstage. For the 1938 film Shaw and co-writers replaced that exposition with a scene at an embassy ball; Nepommuck, the blackmailing translator spoken about in the play, is finally seen, but his name is updated to Aristid Karpathy ‚Äì named so by Gabriel Pascal, the film's Hungarian producer, who also made sure that Karpathy mistakes Eliza for a Hungarian princess. In My Fair Lady he became Zoltan Karpathy. (The change of name was likely to avoid offending the sensibilities of Roman Catholics, as St. John Nepomuk was, ironically, a Catholic martyr who refused to divulge the secrets of the confessional.) The 1938 film also introduced the famous pronunciation exercises \\"the rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain\\" and \\"In Hertford, Hereford, and Hampshire, hurricanes hardly ever happen\\".Pascal, Valerie, The Disciple and His Devil, McGraw-Hill, 1970. p. 83.\\" Neither of these appears in the original play. Shaw's screen version of the play as well as a new print version incorporating the new sequences he had added for the film script were published in 1941. Many of the scenes that were written for the films were separated by asterisks, and explained in a \\"Note for Technicians\\" section. Influence Pygmalion remains Shaw's most popular play. The play's widest audiences know it as the inspiration for the highly romanticized 1956 musical and 1964 film My Fair Lady. Pygmalion has transcended cultural and language barriers since its first production. The British Museum contains \\"images of the Polish production...; a series of shots of a wonderfully Gallicised Higgins and Eliza in the first French production in Paris in 1923; a fascinating set for a Russian production of the 1930s. There was no country which didn't have its own 'take' on the subjects of class division and social mobility, and it's as enjoyable to view these subtle differences in settings and costumes as it is to imagine translators wracking their brains for their own equivalent of 'Not bloody likely'.\\"\\"The lesson of a Polish production of 'Pygmalion.'\\" The Independent on Sunday, 3 July 2001.

It is the eighth track on the album G N' R Lies and was released in 1988. The lyrics describe Guns N' Roses singer Axl Rose's experience of getting hustled in the Greyhound bus station upon first arriving in Los Angeles.  Controversy  The song's lyrics caused great controversy among many different groups, and accusations of homophobia, nativism, and racism were leveled against Guns N' Roses' lead singer and song lyricist, Axl Rose. Music critic Jon Pareles noted that \\"with \\"One in a Million\\" on G 'n' R Lies, the band tailored its image to appeal to white, heterosexual, nativist prejudices, denouncing blacks, immigrants and gays while coyly apologizing \\"to those who may take offense\\" in the album notes. In a 1989 Rolling Stone interview, Rose explained the lyrics: The cover of the GN'R Lies EP, which was designed as a mock-tabloid newspaper front page, actually contained an advance apology for the song, suggesting controversy was anticipated. A small \\"article\\" entitled \\"One in a Million\\", credited to Rose, ended: \\"This song is very simple and extremely generic or generalized, my apologies to those who may take offense.\\" In response to the following accusations of homophobia, Rose initially stated that he was \\"pro- heterosexual\\" and \\"I'm not against them doing what they want to do as long as it's not hurting anybody else and they're not forcing it upon me\\", and spoke of negative experiences in his past, such as a seemingly friendly man who let him crash on his hotel room floor and then tried to rape him. He later softened this stance, and insisted that he was not homophobic, pointing out that some of his icons, such as Freddie Mercury and Elton John, as well as David Geffen, the head of his record label, were bisexual or gay. Axl Rose was also accused of being biased against police due to the negative lyrics in the song which mention them. Rose responded by claiming when he was a teenager he was once mistaken for a girl by two police officers, who then proceeded to make sexual comments towards him, infuriating him so much he attacked the officers, resulting in his arrest. Nevertheless, others - including some of his peers in the music industry - accused him of racism for the use of the word 'niggers' in the song. When Guns N' Roses and Living Colour supported The Rolling Stones for a concert in Los Angeles in 1989, Living Colour guitarist Vernon Reid publicly commented on \\"One in a Million\\" during his band's set. After hearing this, Rose in turn suggested they play the song for their opening act \\"just to piss them off.\\" Nirvana's Kurt Cobain also took offense to the track, according to then-manager Danny Goldberg, explaining: \\"Kurt's whole thing about being a feminist, this was at a time when Guns N‚Äô Roses had a song ['One in a Million'] that was on one of their big albums that referred to n*****s and f*****s. And we couldn't have had something more offensive to somebody like Kurt than that.\\" By 1992, however, Rose seemed to have gained new perspective on the song and its lyrics. In one interview, he added, \\"I was pissed off about some black people that were trying to rob me. I wanted to insult those particular black people.\\" In his final public comments about \\"One in a Million\\" in 1992, Rose stated, \\"It was a way for me to express my anger at how vulnerable I felt in certain situations that had gone down in my life.\\" The song would continue to be decried later, as publications such as WMMR, Loudwire and Medium listed it last or near last when ranking Guns N' Roses songs from best to worst. \\"One in a Million\\" was not included on a 2018 box- set reissue of Appetite for Destruction, which otherwise featured the remaining songs recorded for G N' R Lies on a bonus disc. Slash explained it had been a collective decision, which didn't require a \\"big roundtable thing\\".  Response from bandmates  Before the release of Lies, the other members of the band tried in vain to make Rose drop the track from the record. Fellow GN'R member Slash, whose mother is black, noted that he did not condone the song but did not condemn his bandmate, commenting in a 1991 interview with Rolling Stone: \\"When Axl first came up with the song and really wanted to do it, I said I didn't think it was very cool... I don't regret doing 'One in a Million', I just regret what we've been through because of it and the way people have perceived our personal feelings.\\" In 1988, rhythm guitarist Izzy Stradlin told rock critic Nick Kent that the lyrics simply reflected the poor race relations of inner city Los Angeles.Kent, Nick. Pop, Iggy. The Dark Stuff: selected writings on rock music Page 232. Da Capo Press, 2002. , In a 2019 interview, McKagan said \\"One in a Million\\" was misinterpreted, stating \\"One thing about Axl is if you‚Äôre going to try to compete with him intellectually, you‚Äôve lost, because he‚Äôs a super smart guy...

He was one of the most talented artists in the successful generation of painters who studied under Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg but died early and has therefore left a relatively small oeuvre. Biography A Young Artist (Ditlev Blunck) Examining a Sketch in a Mirror, 1826 Early life and education Mountain landscape. Wilhelm Bendz was born on 20 March 1804 in Odense on the island of Funen. He was sent to Copenhagen where he attended the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts from 1820 to 1825, where he studied under Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg. In 1825 he made an unsuccessful attempt to win the gold medal, only given to history paintings, the most prestigious genre at that time, and after that decided to specialize in portraits and genre works. He may also have acquired some knowledge of contemporary German painting, the Munich School, which seems to have influenced his style. Successful years at Charlottenborg After his graduation from the Academy, Bendz contributed successfully with a number of works to the annual exhibitions at Charlottenborg in 1826, 1827 and 1828. Three of his paintings were acquired by the Royal Painting Collection; Model Class at the Art Academy and A young artist looking at a sketch through a mirror from 1826 and the monumentally sized A sculptor working with a live model from 1827. Another important work from this phase is A Tobacco Party from 1828. After this Bendz was employed as an assistant at Eckersberg's studio, working on routine assignments such as the reconstruction of Nikolaj Abraham Abildgaard's history paintings from Christiansborg Palace which had been destroyed in the fire of 1794, and painting copies of Eckersberg's works. Munich, 1831-32 In late 1830 Bendz finally received a travel scholarship which enabled him to leave for southern Europe. After shorter visits to Dresden and Berlin, he initially went to Munich, which had developed into a vibrant centre for the arts, and where he stayed for around a year.Rewald 2011, p. 31 His most important work from the stay is the thoroughly composed group portrait \\"Artist in the Evening at Finck's Coffee House in Munich\\". Early death in Italy In the autumn of 1832 he continued his journey towards Rome in company with Joseph Petzl and Thomas Fearnley, stopping in Venice on the way where he renewed his friendship with the painter Ditlev Blunck, who he had first met in his student days at the Academy in Copenhagen. They continued together but shortly after in Vicenza, Bendz, who had felt ill since Venice, died from a lung infection. Works Today he is mainly remembered for his many technically accomplished portraits, though his ambition most of all ran towards a refined fusion of portrait, genre scene and allegorical history painting. His technical virtuosity is particularly visible in his depictions of the play of light cast from an obscured source and the resulting shadows. His main works include several portraits of his fellow artists such as Ditlev Blunck and Christen Christensen (both in the Danish National Gallery, a scene from the Academy's anatomy class, as well as the group portraits \\"A Tobacco Party\\" (Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek) and \\"Artist in the Evening at Finck's Coffee House in Munich\\" (Thorvaldsens Museum).

Hand-drawn animated cartoons are used to distinguish flashbacks, parables, stories, spiritual encounters and visions from the main plot, which is all in stop motion. (The daughter of Jairus is not named in the New Testament.) The Miracle Maker film appeared in the Welsh language on VHS: S4C Video in 1999 and TV: S4C In 2001. and later in English Cinemas-throughout the United Kingdom on BBC 1 in 2002. It had its American premiere in the United States on ABC in 2000, while Artisan Entertainment, and later Lionsgate, held the home video rights. The film was directed by Derek Hayes and Stanislav Sokolov. It stars the voice of Ralph Fiennes as Jesus, and numerous other well-known actors. The film ends with Anne Dudley's \\"Pie Jesu\\" for solo boy soprano and orchestra.  Plot = Jesus leaves home and prepares to start His Father's Work  The film opens in ‚ÄòSepphoris, Upper Galilee, Year 90 of the Roman Occupation.‚Äô Jairus and his sick daughter Tamar are travelling to meet their friend Cleopas, who knows a doctor that may be able to help Tamar. However, the doctor is only able to offer painkillers, confiding to Jairus that there is nothing else that can be done. While Jairus is with the doctor, Tamar witnesses Jesus, one of the carpenters building a new synagogue, protect a deranged woman, Mary Magdalene, from being attacked by the townspeople. Jesus leaves his job, and goes to visit his mother, Mary. While he is there, Mary recalls his birth, the visit of the Wise Men, and how a young Jesus went missing during Passover and was found conferring with the elders at the Temple, who were amazed at his understanding of the scriptures. After leaving his mother's house, Jesus travels to the Jordan River to be baptised by John the Baptist. When Jesus rises out of the water, a voice from Heaven declares, \\"This is my beloved son,\\" and the Holy Spirit descends on him as a dove. After his baptism, Jesus wanders out into the wilderness, where he is repeatedly tempted by Satan. After Jesus rebukes Satan temptations and leaves the wilderness, he is met by his friend Lazarus. Jesus returns to Lazarus' home, where he is hosted by Lazarus‚Äô sisters, Martha and Mary.  Jesus begins his Ministry in Galilee  Jesus begins preaching the Sermon on the Mount in the fields near Capernaum. Tamar and her mother Rachel happen to be nearby, and Tamar wishes to stay and listen to Jesus, remembering him from her visit to Sepphoris. Jesus tells the Parable of the Wise and the Foolish Builders, while many priests listen on and debate the legitimacy of Jesus and his teachings. Tamar's illness worsens, and her mother takes her home despite Tamar's protests. Meanwhile, Judas and other zealots, including Barabbas, are plotting an uprising against the Romans in a cave nearby. Judas thinks Jesus is the Messiah come to deliver them from the Romans, and that the people will follow him to a glorious victory. He leaves the other zealots to follow Jesus, who mock him and believe he's chasing after foolish dreams. Shortly afterward, Mary Magdalene is being harassed by the tax collector, Matthew, for not paying the tax to cross the border from Judea into Herod's Kingdom. Four fishermen, Simon, Andrew, James and John also confront Matthew, angry at having to pay taxes despite not having caught any fish. Jesus arrives, which excites Andrew but evokes scepticism from Simon. Jesus commandeers Simon and Andrew's boat to preach to the crowd from the water, and tells the Parable of the Mustard Seed. After the crowds have gone, Jesus tells the fishermen to row out into the deep and cast their nets. Simon protests, explaining that no one catches fish in the middle of the day as they hide from the sunlight, but eventually complies to appease Jesus. Much to the fishermen's surprise, they haul in an extremely large catch. Simon tearfully recognises Jesus as the Messiah, and Jesus says he will make him a fisher of men.  Jesus teaches, performs miracles and upsets the authorities  Simon the Pharisee, an elder of the Capernaum Synagogue, is visited by Ben Azra, one of the Temple priests, worried about the possibility of Jesus causing a revolt. He says Jesus is more dangerous than John the Baptist and hints that John has already been 'dealt with'. Nearby, Tamar is resting on a balcony, watching a crowd of people swarming a house where Jesus is teaching. Simon the Pharisee and Ben Azra join the crowds to listen to Jesus. A group of men carrying their paralytic friend on a stretcher try to fight their way through the crowd so that Jesus may heal their friend, but find it impossible to make their way to the door. As Jesus teaches using the example of a man with a plank in his eye trying to remove a speck from another's eye, the men with the paralytic friend dig their way through the roof and lower their friend in front of Jesus. Jesus forgives the sins of the paralytic man, and heals him. Tamar and her family watch as the healed man dances through the streets. That night, Jesus encounters Mary Magdalene outside the town and casts several demons out of her. The next day, Jesus chooses his twelve apostles and changes Simon's name to Peter. Shortly afterward, the leaders of the synagogue have invited Jesus and his disciples to their house to question him. Mary Magdalene enters and washes Jesus‚Äô feet with her tears, drying them with her hair. Jesus tells her that her sins are forgiven, causing Ben Azra and Simon the Pharisee to condemn Jesus as being in league with the Devil. Tamar's illness worsens, but Jairus is hesitant to take her to Jesus as the leaders of his synagogue claim that anyone who follows Jesus is an enemy of God. Rachel pleads with Jairus to find Jesus and ask him save their daughter. Jairus agrees to go to Jesus, and pleads with him to heal Tamar. On the way to Jairus' house, a woman with internal bleeding reaches out to touch Jesus's robe and is cured. Just before they arrive at Jairus' house, servants come to tell Jairus that Tamar is dead. Jesus encourages Jairus to remain faithful, enters the house, and raises Tamar, who awakens fully healed. Jairus, Rachel, Cleopas, and Tamar begin to follow Jesus' as well. Jesus learns that King Herod has killed John the Baptist and mourns for him, while Ben Azra meets with Herod about Jesus. Herod regrets John's death but agrees that Jesus must be dealt with to prevent Pilate from reporting any uprisings against Rome.  Jesus goes to Jerusalem  Jesus and all his followers begin to make the journey from Capernaum to Jerusalem for the Passover festival. Meanwhile, Pilate and his Centurion prepare for an influx of pilgrims in Jerusalem, and discuss the suppression of an uprising and the capture of Judas‚Äô friend Barabbas. Jesus teaches his followers on the road and tells the Parable of the Good Samaritan. A rider comes to Jesus and tells him his friend Lazarus is dying, begging him to come. Jesus does not go immediately, which confuses and upsets Tamar. A short time later, Ben Azra rushes to Caiaphas and explains that he witnessed Jesus raise Lazarus from the dead. Despite Ben Azra's apprehensions about the Jews possibly following a man as powerful as Jesus in an uprising against Rome, Caiaphas reasons that Jesus can be disposed of, placating Caesar's anger against the Jews. Jesus enters Jerusalem, followed and greeted by adoring crowds. Judas begins to become disillusioned with Jesus, as the sight of Jesus on a donkey and people singing and waving palm branches does not fit his idea of a conquering army. Jesus and his disciples go to the Temple, where Jesus becomes enraged at the sight of the merchants who have set up shop inside. Jesus proclaims the Temple to be a house of prayer and turns the tables of the traders. The temple priests begin to plot to subdue Jesus, while the elders try to trick Jesus by asking him whether or not it is right to pay taxes. Jesus points out that Caesar's portrait and title are on the denarius, and proclaims that people should \\"give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar, but give to God what belongs to God!\\" When Judas hears Jesus validate the payment of taxes to the Roman Empire, encounters Barabbas in prison, and hears Jesus predict His death, he despairs and resolves to betray Jesus to save himself and the Jewish people, reasoning that only a false Messiah would allow himself to be killed. He goes and offers his services to Ben Azra, who is looking for a way to arrest Jesus away from the crowds.  Jesus is condemned and crucified  Jesus and his followers eat the Last Supper in secret, where Jesus tells his disciples they will abandon him. Jesus instructs Judas to do what he has to do, and Judas slips out to lead the authorities to Jesus. When they have finished supper, Jesus and his followers gather around fires outside. Cleopas and Jairus ask Jesus to explain all that they don't understand, to which Jesus replies that they will understand soon. He takes Peter, James and John to pray with him in the Garden of Gethsemane. Jesus goes off a bit further by himself, where he prays earnestly and is tempted by Satan to flee while he still can. Jesus refuses, and prays for God's will to be done. Judas returns and leads the authorities to Jesus, who is arrested by the Temple Guard while the disciples flee. Jesus is tried by Caiaphas and the Sanhedrin, who send him to Pilate. Despite having an intense dislike for the Jews, Pilate finds no case against Jesus and sends him to Herod. Herod mocks Jesus and sends him back to Pilate. Judas is overwhelmed with guilt and tries to appeal to Ben Azra, who dismisses him and asserts that what Judas has done is his own problem. Ben Azra gathers a crowd and instructs them to call for the crucifixion of Jesus and the release of Barabbas, despite Pilate's reluctance to do so. Caiaphas blackmails Pilate into condemning Jesus to death. Jairus learns what has happened and Jesus's followers run into Jerusalem, but are unable to interfere. Jesus is led up to Golgotha and crucified, while his followers look on. As Jesus dies, the sky goes dark and he proclaims ‚ÄòIt is finished‚Äô. The curtain in the temple that separates the Holy of Holies from the rest of the temple is torn in two.  Jesus rises from the dead  The disciples bury Jesus and mourn for him. Mary Magdalene returns to the tomb on Sunday morning and finds the body is gone. She encounters Jesus in the garden and goes to tell the other disciples, who believe she is mad. Peter goes to the tomb and also encounters Jesus. He tells the other disciples that he, too, has seen Jesus, but Thomas is sceptical. Cleopas and Jairus arrive, and tell the disciples that they encountered Jesus on the road to Emmaus. Thomas declares that they have all gone mad, and that he will not believe unless he sees Jesus and touches his wounds. Just then, Jesus appears, and Thomas also believes. Some time later, Jesus appears among all his followers on a mount, gives the Great Commission, and then ascends into heaven. A child asks where Jesus has gone, and Tamar explains that the Kingdom of God has come, and that Jesus will be with them forever.

Though Pygmalion is the Greek version of the Phoenician royal name Pumayyaton, See Pygmalion of Tyre. he is most familiar from Ovid's narrative poem Metamorphoses, in which Pygmalion was a sculptor who fell in love with a statue he had carved. In Ovid In book 10 of Ovid's Metamorphoses, Pygmalion was a Cypriot sculptor who carved a woman out of ivory. According to Ovid, after seeing the Propoetides prostituting themselves, Pygmalion declared that he was \\"not interested in women\\", but then found his statue was so beautiful and realistic that he fell in love with it. In time, Aphrodite's festival day came, and Pygmalion made offerings at the altar of Aphrodite. There, too scared to admit his desire, he quietly wished for a bride who would be \\"the living likeness of my ivory girl.\\" When he returned home, he kissed his ivory statue, and found that its lips felt warm. He kissed it again, and found that the ivory had lost its hardness. Aphrodite had granted Pygmalion's wish. Pygmalion married the ivory sculpture which changed to a woman under Aphrodite's blessing. In Ovid's narrative, they had a daughter, Paphos, from whom the city's name is derived. In some versions Paphos was a son, and they also had a daughter, Metharme.Pseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheke, iii.14.3. Ovid's mention of Paphos suggests that he was drawing on a more circumstantial accountThe Greek sources of Ovid's tale are fully discussed at Galatea. than the source for a passing mention of Pygmalion in Pseudo-Apollodorus' Bibliotheke, a Hellenic mythography of the 2nd-century AD.Bibliotheke, iii.14.3 simply mentions \\"Metharme, daughter of Pygmalion, king of Cyprus.\\" Perhaps he drew on the lost narrative by Philostephanus that was paraphrased by Clement of Alexandria.Clement, Exhortation to the Greeks, 4: \\"So the well- known Pygmalion of Cyprus fell in love with an ivory statue; it was of Aphrodite and was naked. The man of Cyprus is captivated by its shapeliness and embraces the statue. This is related by Philostephanus\\". In the story of Dido, Pygmalion is an evil king. Parallels in Greek myth The story of the breath of life in a statue has parallels in the examples of Daedalus, who used quicksilver to install a voice in his statues; of Hephaestus, who created automata for his workshop; of Talos, an artificial man of bronze; and (according to Hesiod) of Pandora, who was made from clay at the behest of Zeus. The moral anecdote of the \\"Apega of Nabis\\", recounted by the historian Polybius, described a supposed mechanical simulacrum of the tyrant's wife, that crushed victims in her embrace. The trope of a sculpture so lifelike that it seemed about to move was a commonplace with writers on works of art in antiquity. This trope was inherited by writers on art after the Renaissance. Reinterpretations The basic Pygmalion story has been widely transmitted and re-presented in the arts through the centuries. At an unknown date, later authors give as the name of the statue that of the sea-nymph Galatea or Galathea. Goethe calls her Elise, based upon the variants in the story of Dido/Elissa. A variant of this theme can also be seen in the story of Pinocchio, in which a wooden puppet is transformed into a \\"real boy\\", though in this case the puppet possesses sentience prior to its transformation; it is the puppet and not its creator, the woodcarver Geppetto, who beseeches the divine powers for the miracle. In the final scene of William Shakespeare's The Winter's Tale, a statue of Queen Hermione which comes to life is revealed as Hermione herself, so bringing the play to a conclusion of reconciliations. In George Bernard Shaw's 1913 play Pygmalion, a modern variant of the myth with a subtle hint of feminism, the underclass flower-girl Eliza Doolittle is metaphorically \\"brought to life\\" by a phonetics professor, Henry Higgins, who teaches her to refine her accent and conversation and otherwise conduct herself with upper-class manners in social situations. This play in turn inspired the 1938 film Pygmalion, as well as the 1956 play My Fair Lady and the 1964 film My Fair Lady. The 2007 film Lars and the Real Girl tells the story of a man who purchases a doll and treats her as a real person in order to reconnect with the rest of the world. Although she never comes to life, he believes she is real, and in doing so develops more connections to his community. When he no longer needs her, he lets her go. This is a reversal of the myth of Pygmalion. √âtienne Maurice Falconet: Pygmalion et Galat√©eThe invention of the name Galatea is modern; Falconet's title was Pygmalion aux pieds de sa statue qui s'anime, \\"Pygmalion at the feet of his statue, which comes to life\\".

Opera, ballet, and music *The story of Pygmalion is the subject of Jean-Philippe Rameau's 1748 opera, Pigmalion. *It was also the subject of Georg Benda's 1779 monodrama, Pygmalion. *Ramler's poem Pygmalion was set to music as an aria by J.C.F.Bach in 1772, and as a cantata by Friedrich Benda in 1784. *Pygmalion was the subject of Gaetano Donizetti's first opera, Il Pigmalione. *Fromental Hal√©vy wrote an opera Pygmalion in the 1820s, but it was not performed. *Franz von Suppe composed an operetta Die sch√∂ne Galath√©e which is based on the characters of Pygmalion and Galatea. *The ballet Copp√©lia, about an inventor who makes a life-sized dancing doll, has strong echoes of Pygmalion. *The choreographer Marius Petipa and the composer Prince Nikita Trubetskoi created a four-act ballet on the subject called Pygmalion, ou La Statue de Chypre. The ballet was revived in 1895 with the great ballerina Pierina Legnani. *The English progressive rock group Yes composed \\"Turn of the Century\\" (1977); it tells the story of the sculptor Roan who, in the grief of his wife's death, \\"molds his passion into clay.\\" The sculpture of his wife comes to life and they fall in love. *British shoegaze band Slowdive named their third LP Pygmalion in 1995. *The song \\"Trial By Fire\\" by darkwave/gothic band ThouShaltNot recreates the idea of a modern-day Pygmalion with lyrics such as \\"I sculpt your nature within, I am your Pygmalion\\" and \\"I dust away the plaster from off your breathing body...You'll never be the same.\\" *Lunatic Soul's 2014 album Walking on a Flashlight Beam includes the track \\"Pygmalion's Ladder\\". * The progressive house artist Hellberg (Jonathan Hellberg) released a song called 'The Girl' featuring vocalist Cozi Zuehlsdorff in 2015. They have both admitted to having been inspired by the Pygmalion myth when creating the track. * Wonderbound Ballet Company in Denver, Colorado premiered the piece \\"Patterns\\" in 2018 as part of their work Aphrodite's Switchboard. The piece centers on a reinterpretation of the Pygmalion story in which Aphrodite falls in love with Pygmalion's sculpture herself. *My Fair Lady stage musical Stage plays W. S. Gilbert's stage version, 1871 Though it is not based on the story of Pygmalion, Shakespeare's play Measure for Measure references Pygmalion in a line spoken by Lucio in Act 3, Scene 2: \\"What, is there none of Pygmalion's images, newly made woman, to be had now, for putting the hand in the pocket and extracting it clutch'd?\\" There have also been successful stage- plays based upon the work, such as W. S. Gilbert's Pygmalion and Galatea (1871). It was revived twice, in 1884 and in 1888. The play was parodied the musical 1883 burlesque Galatea, or Pygmalion Reversed, which was performed at the Gaiety Theatre with a libretto by Henry Pottinger Stephens and W. Webster, and a score composed by Wilhelm Meyer Lutz. In January, 1872, Ganymede and Galatea opened at the Gaiety Theatre. This was a comic version of Franz von Supp√©'s Die sch√∂ne Galathee, coincidentally with Arthur Sullivan's brother, Fred Sullivan, in the cast. In March 1872, William Brough's 1867 play Pygmalion; or, The Statue Fair was revived, and in May of that year, a visiting French company produced Victor Mass√©'s Galath√©e. George Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion (1912, staged 1913) owes something to both the Greek Pygmalion and the legend of \\"King Cophetua and the beggar maid\\"; in which a king lacks interest in women, but one day falls in love with a young beggar- girl, later educating her to be his queen. Shaw's comedy of manners in turn was the basis for the Broadway musical My Fair Lady (1956), as well as numerous other adaptations. P. L. Deshpande's play Ti Fulrani (\\"Queen of Flowers\\") is also based on Shaw's Pygmalion. The play was a huge success in Marathi theater and has earned many accolades. Madhu Rye adapted Pygmalion in Gujarati as Santu Rangili (1976) which was successful. Television *The Man from U.N.C.L.E. 3rd-season episode \\"The Galatea Affair\\" from 1966 is a spoof of My Fair Lady. A crude barroom entertainer (Joan Collins) is taught to behave like a lady. Noel Harrison, son of Rex Harrison, star of the My Fair Lady film, is the guest star. *The Japanese anime series Bubblegum Crisis: Tokyo 2040 includes a character named Galatea, an artificial life form designed to be the next evolution of the human race. *In Disney's Hercules: The Animated Series, Pygmalion was Hercules' art teacher. His success in crafting a perfect wife for himself prompted Hercules to do the same to create a date for a school dance, naming her Galatea. *The science-fiction franchise Star Trek explores the Pygmalion theme in episodes such Star Trek: The Next Generations \\"Inheritance\\" (Episode 7x10), where Data's creator Dr. Soong constructs a female android to replace his deceased wife, and Star Trek: The Original Series \\"Requiem for Methuselah\\" (Episode 3x19), where an immortal human builds a presumably immortal android as a life partner. The character of Data, himself an android \\"sculpted\\" by man and his longing to become more \\"human,\\" are a recurrent arc of the series. * The 1897 flashback of the Gothic TV serial Dark Shadows includes a painter, Charles Delaware Tate (portrayed by Roger Davis), whose portraits come to life. The character of Amanda Harris is one of Tate's creations, falling in love with Quentin Collins.

SMS cards in an IBM 1401 mid-size computer. The Standard Modular System (SMS) is a system of standard transistorized circuit boards and mounting racks developed by IBM in the late 1950s, originally for the IBM 7030 Stretch. They were used throughout IBM's second-generation computers, peripherals, the 7000 series, the 1400 series, and the 1620. SMS was superseded by Solid Logic Technology (SLT) introduced with System/360 in 1964, however they remained in use with legacy systems through the 1970s. Many IBM peripheral devices that are part of System/360, but were adapted from second-generation designs, continued to use SMS circuitry instead of the newer SLT. These included the 240x-series tape drives and controllers, the 2540 card reader/punch and 1403N1 printer, and the 2821 Integrated Control Unit for the 1403 and 2540. A few SMS cards used in System/360 peripheral devices even have SLT-type hybrid ICs mounted on them.Flickr image of an SMS card with SLT module SMS cards are constructed of individual discrete components mounted on single-sided paper-epoxy printed circuit boards. Single-width cards are 2.5 inches wide by 4.5 inches tall by 0.056 inches thick, with a 16-pin gold plated edge connector. Double-width cards are 5.375 inches wide by 4.5 inches tall, with two 16-pin gold plated edge connectors. Contacts are labeled A‚ÄìR (skipping I and O) on the first edge connector, and S‚ÄìZ, 1‚Äì8 on the second. The cards are plugged into a card-cage back-plane and edge connector contacts connected to wire wrap pins. All interconnections are made with wire-wrapped connections, except for power bus lines. The back-plane wire-wrap connections were mostly made at the factory with automated equipment, but the wire-wrap technology facilitated field-installation of engineering changes by customer engineers. Some card types can be customized via a \\"program cap\\" (a double- rail metal jumper bar with 15 connections) that could be cut to change the circuit configuration. Card types with a \\"program cap\\" came with it precut for the standard configuration and if a customer engineer needed a different configuration in the field he could make additional cuts as needed. This feature was intended to reduce the number of different card types a customer engineer had to carry with him to the customer's site. The card type is a two- to four-letter code embossed on the card (e.g., MX, ALQ). If the card has a \\"program cap\\" the code is split into a two-letter card type code and a two- letter \\"cap connection\\" code (e.g., AK ZZ). When SMS was originally developed, IBM anticipated a set of a couple hundred standard card types would be all that would be needed, making design, manufacture and servicing simpler. Unfortunately that proved far too optimistic as the number of different SMS card types soon grew to well over 2500. Part of the reason for the growth was that multiple digital logic families were implemented (ECL, RTL, DTL, etc.) as well as analog circuits, to meet the requirements of the many different systems in which the cards were used.

Early life and education One of eight children, Ross was born to cattleman, John M. Ross, and his wife, Jeanette, near Parma, Idaho. He left school after sixth grade, but at age eighteen, he decided to continue his education and graduated from Portland Commercial College. In 1897 ,he returned to the family ranch and co-managed it with his brother, W. H. Ross. Career Ross began his political career in Canyon County, serving as county commissioner from 1915 to 1921. He moved to Bannock County and served as mayor of Pocatello from 1922 to 1930. He won the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in 1928. Although he nearly tripled the Democratic vote total of his predecessor, Asher B. Wilson, thanks to the recent demise of the Idaho Progressive Party, he was defeated by the Republican incumbent H. C. Baldridge. Ross won the nomination again in 1930, winning the open seat against Republican John McMurray. His wife, Edna, was a natural politician and a great asset to Ross. She was often referred to as \\"Governor Edna\\" while he held that office. He was reelected in 1932 and 1934, becoming the first person to win election as Governor of Idaho three times. During his tenure as governor Ross was viewed as the chief proponent of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal policies in Idaho. Even so, his own beliefs more closely mirrored the agrarian populism of earlier Democrats such as William Jennings Bryan.Book of the Week Club: \\"C. Ben Ross and the New Deal in Idaho\\" The first sales tax in Idaho was enacted in 1935 with Ross' support. A famous line used against Ross by sales tax opponents was \\"A Penny for Benny.\\" A driver's license law was instituted and legislation was initiated which would make liquor sales regulated through state distributors. Ross ran for United States Senate in 1936 but was defeated by longtime Republican incumbent William E. Borah. Opponents also used the following poem against him: \\"Benny got our penny/Benny got our goat/We'll get our Benny/When we go to vote.\\" The sales tax was repealed after a statewide referendum in 1936. In 1938, Ross ran for governor a fifth time, defeating incumbent Barzilla W. Clark in the Democratic primary but losing to state Republican Party chairman C. A. Bottolfsen in the general election. After losing the 1938 gubernatorial election, \\"Cowboy Ben\\" retired from public life. He is referred to as \\"Founding Father\\" of the Idaho Farm Bureau Federation and was looked to as a champion of the Idaho Democratic Party. Personal life He married Edna Reavis on February 14, 1900, and together they raised four foster children. Ross died on March 31, 1946, and is interred at Parma Cemetery, Parma, Canyon County, Idaho US.

He won the prestigious Aeroflot Open in 2004, and became the 58th Russian chess champion after winning the Russian Superfinal in Moscow (18‚Äì30 December 2005), one point clear from Dmitry Jakovenko and Alexander Morozevich. He finished in the top 10 in the 2005 FIDE World Cup, which qualified him for the Candidates Tournament for the FIDE World Chess Championship 2007, played in May‚ÄìJune 2007. He defeated Ruslan Ponomariov 3¬Ω-2¬Ω in the first round. In the second round he played Alexander Grischuk. The match was tied 3-3, but Grischuk won the rapid playoff 2¬Ω-¬Ω, eliminating Rublevsky from the championship. Style GM Nigel Short said of Rublevsky, \\"Rublevsky is not a sexy player.

Against the French and Caro-Kann, he plays 2.d4 followed by 3.Nd2. With Black, he meets 1.e4 with Kan/Paulsen/Taimanov Sicilians; against 1.d4 he generally plays the QGA and the occasional Slav.

He batted left-handed and threw right-handed. Early career He attended San Diego High School in San Diego, California, where he starred in both baseball and football. He was offered a football scholarship to the University of Arizona as a quarterback, but chose to sign a professional baseball contract. He signed directly with the San Diego Padres of the Pacific Coast League in 1954, and was acquired by the White Sox when they signed a working agreement with the Padres in 1960. MLB outfielder Robinson made his major league debut at age 24 on August 10, 1960 in a 6-0 White Sox home loss to the New York Yankees, starting in right field and going 0-for-3 against Art Ditmar. After batting in double- digit games over a five-week span without a hit, he notched his first career hit on September 18, 1960 in an 8-4 road win over the Detroit Tigers with a sixth-inning single off Jim Bunning. In his next at-bat, he got his first career run-batted-in with a single off Dave Sisler that plated Ted Kluszewski. Robinson was managed by Hall of Famer Al L√≥pez, a man he respected a great deal, for most of his seven-year White Sox career. Eddie Stanky managed the 1966 White Sox, which was Robinson's final year with the team. Stanky was known for prickly relationships with his ballplayers. His first full year in the majors, 1961, was an outstanding one as he finished tied for third in the American League Rookie of the Year voting. He posted a .310 batting average with 11 home runs, 59 runs batted in, 134 hits and 52 bases on balls. In 1962, he finished 10th in the American League MVP voting (Mickey Mantle won) and had 187 hits in 600 at bats for a .312 batting average, third in the league. He led the league in doubles that year with 45, and was fourth in RBIs with 109. On July 22, 1962, Robinson became part of baseball history with six hits (all singles) in six at-bats in a nine-inning game. He is one of only 35 American Leaguers to accomplish the feat. In 1964, Robinson came closer to reaching the World Series than he ever would when the White Sox went 98-64, one game behind the 99-63 New York Yankees. It was the second of three straight years that his team finished second in the American League. The White Sox had reached the World Series in 1959, one year before Robinson reached the majors. However, Robinson never played on a team with a losing record. Robinson's career high in home runs came in 1965 when he hit 14 with 66 RBIs. That was his last major offensive year. In December 1966 he was traded to the Reds, for whom he played one season, batting .238 with one home run and 10 RBIs in 55 games. In November 1967 he was traded to the Athletics, for whom he batted .247 with one home run and 14 RBIs in 53 games. On July 31 his contract was purchased by the Red Sox, for whom Robinson played 23 games, including his final career game on September 29, 1968. A knee injury in 1967 had cut short his career. In nine major league seasons, Robinson hit .283 with 67 home runs and 426 RBIs. He accumulated 140 doubles, 36 triples, and 42 stolen bases with 458 runs scored. Defensively, in 886 games Robinson committed 30 errors for a .981 fielding percentage. Off the field Robinson is a cousin of former major league outfielder Tommie Reynolds, who played eight years in the majors for five teams from 1963 to 1972. After baseball, Robinson and his wife Sandra, whom he married in 1965, were also business partners, investing in real estate and apartment buildings and a small grocery store. They especially take pride in their building of the Golden Age Garden, a low-income senior citizen apartment complex in San Diego. In 2007, they established the nonprofit Floyd Robinson Foundation. In 2009, Robinson was inducted by the San Diego Hall of Champions into the Breitbard Hall of Fame honoring San Diego's finest athletes both on and off the field.

It is a measure of the average price at which a stock is traded over the trading horizon. VWAP is often used as a trading benchmark by investors who aim to be as passive as possible in their execution. Many pension funds, and some mutual funds, fall into this category. The aim of using a VWAP trading target is to ensure that the trader executing the order does so in line with volume on the market. It is sometimes argued that such execution reduces transaction costs by minimizing market impact costs (the additional cost due to the market impact, i.e. the adverse effect of a trader's activities on the price of a security). VWAP can be measured between any two points in time but is displayed as the one corresponding to elapsed time during the trading day by the information provider. VWAP is often used in algorithmic trading. Indeed, a broker may guarantee execution of an order at the VWAP and have a computer program enter the orders into the market in order to earn the trader's commission and create P&L.; This is called a guaranteed VWAP execution. The broker can also trade in a best effort way and answer to the client the realized price. This is called a VWAP target execution; it incurs more dispersion in the answered price compared to the VWAP price for the client but a lower received/paid commission. Trading algorithms that use VWAP as a target belong to a class of algorithms known as volume participation algorithms. The first execution of the VWAP was in 1984 for the Ford Motor Company by James Elkins, then head trader at Abel Noser. Formula VWAP is calculated using the following formula: :P_{\\\\mathrm{VWAP}} = \\\\frac{\\\\sum_{j}{P_j \\\\cdot Q_j}}{\\\\sum_j{Q_j}} \\\\, where: :P_{\\\\mathrm{VWAP}} is Volume Weighted Average Price; :P_j is price of trade j; :Q_j is quantity of trade j; :j is each individual trade that takes place over the defined period of time, excluding cross trades and basket cross trades. Using the VWAP The VWAP can be used similar to moving averages, where prices above the VWAP reflect a bullish sentiment and prices below the VWAP reflect a bearish sentiment. Traders may initiate short positions as a stock price moves below VWAP for a given time period or initiate long position as the price moves above VWAP Institutional buyers and algorithms will often use VWAP to plan entries and initiate larger positions without disturbing the stock price. VWAP slippage is the performance of a broker, and many Buy-side firms now use a Mifid wheel to direct their flow to the best broker.

Early life Willey was born in Guilford, New York, the son of Hiram and Caroline (Church) Willey. He was educated at the Delaware Literary Institute in Franklin, New York. He moved to California at age 20, where he became a gold miner. In 1864, he moved to Warren, Idaho, where he continued to work as a miner and became active in local politics, including service as a member of Idaho County's Board of Commissioners, County Treasurer, and County School Superintendent. Willey also became involved in other business ventures, including owning and operating a sawmill. He later studied law, attained admission to the bar, and practiced in Idaho County. Career A Republican, Willey was elected to Idaho's legislative council in 1872, and served until 1873. Elected to another term in 1878, he served until 1889, and was the Council President in 1879. During his legislative career, he was one of the few council members who opposed the effort to reunite North Idaho with Washington State. In 1888, he was defeated for reelection. During his two terms, he became friends with Milton Kelly ‚Äì a former supreme court justice who had become a prominent newspaper editor. This led to a career in the field of journalism, where his reports as mine superintendent and state correspondent found wide audience. In 1890, another opportunity arose for Willey in politics when Idaho gained admission as a state. George Shoup was chosen to serve as governor; however, he only agreed to do so once he was assured that his service would end as governor in late 1890, and that he would then become a United States Senator. Shoup arranged Willey's election as Lieutenant Governor, which ensured that he would succeed to the governorship after Shoup resigned. During his tenure, Willey oversaw the Idaho government's transition from territorial to state, from creation of state agencies to the design for a state seal. He also dealt with a labor- management strike between miners and mine owners in the Coeur D'Alene region, ultimately declaring martial law, and calling in both the militia and federal troops. Willey continued to serve as governor until 1893; he lost renomination in 1892 to William J. McConnell, who went on to win the general election. After leaving office, Willey accepted a position as a mine superintendent in Blue Canyon, California. He never married or had children, and after several business reverses he moved to Topeka, Kansas to live with relatives. Death In his later years, Willey became a resident of Shawnee County's poorhouse, and the state of Idaho eventually appropriated $1,200 as an unofficial pension to assist him in his old age. He died in Topeka on October 20, 1921, and was buried at Auburn Cemetery in Auburn, Kansas.

Among other accolades, he is a two-time world champion having twice held the AWA World Heavyweight Championship. He is the final holder of that title. Zbyszko was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame on March 28, 2015. Wrestling career=World Wide Wrestling Federation/World Wrestling Federation (1973‚Äì1981) Whistler trained under Bruno Sammartino after cutting his collegiate wrestling career at Penn State University short. He debuted in 1973 as the babyface \\"Larry Zbyszko\\", with his name a tribute to 1920s Polish American wrestler Stanislaus Zbyszko. He initially wrestled in the Pittsburgh area, appearing on the local wrestling program Studio Wrestling, before receiving bookings in Vancouver. He spent three years in the World Wide Wrestling Federation before traveling to California in 1975. Zbyszko was one of the attractions in the 1976 Latin America Wrestling Alliance World Heavyweight championship, held in Guatemala City, under Jose Azzari promotions. Three days after the end of the tournament (Mil M√°scaras won the title, defeating Jose Azzari in the final), an earthquake destroyed much of that Central American nation. Zbyszko returned to the WWWF in 1976 and formed a tag team with Tony Garea, with whom he won the WWWF World Tag Team Championships on November 21, 1978 in Allentown, Pennsylvania. Their reign lasted until March 6, 1979, when they were defeated by the Valiant brothers in Allentown. Zbyszko feuded with Bugsy McGraw, Abdullah the Butcher and Superstar Billy Graham in addition to wrestling Killer Kowalski and Baron Mikel Scicluna. In 1978 he summarized his mat-based ringwork with the statement, \\"I just believe in science over brawn\\". At the end of the decade, Zbyszko became frustrated with his inability to shed his label as Bruno Sammartino's prot√©g√©. He challenged Sammartino to an exhibition match, claiming this was the only way he could step out of Sammartino's shadow. Sammartino eventually agreed to the match after Zbyszko threatened to retire if he was not granted the match. The trainer and pupil faced one another in Allentown on January 22, 1980, with Sammartino dominating the early stages of the match. After Sammartino threw him out of the ring, an irate Zbyszko seized a wooden chair and struck Sammartino, leaving him in a pool of blood in the middle of the ring and instantly turning Zbyszko into a reviled heel. So despised was Zbyszko by partisan Sammartino fans in the northeast that his car was repeatedly damaged and taxis in which he was traveling were overturned by fans. Zbyszko was struck with an iron pole following a match with Ivan Putski, and was stabbed in the buttock following a match with Pedro Morales in the Washington Avenue Armory in Albany, New York. After turning against Sammartino, Zbyszko was approached by the WWWF's \\"Unholy Trio\\" of managers (Fred Blassie, The Grand Wizard, and \\"Captain\\" Lou Albano), but he decided to continue wrestling without a manager. Sammartino and Zbyszko fought one another repeatedly in a lengthy feud that stretched throughout 1980. In the course of the feud, Zbyszko began referring to himself as \\"The New Living Legend\\" (a reference to Sammartino, who was often addressed as \\"The Living Legend\\"). The feud culminated in a steel cage match at Showdown at Shea at Shea Stadium in Flushing, New York on August 9, 1980 that saw Sammartino defeat Zbyszko in front of an audience of 36,295. National Wrestling Alliance (1981‚Äì1983) Zbyszko left the WWF in 1981 and feuded with Bruno's son David Sammartino on the independent circuit. He eventually joined the Georgia Championship Wrestling territory of the National Wrestling Alliance, where he began claiming to have retired Bruno Sammartino (Sammartino had retired from full-time competition in 1981). Zbyszko initially feuded with Tim Woods and Paul Orndorff, whom he was unable to defeat for the NWA National Heavyweight Championship. After Killer Tim Brooks defeated Orndorff for the title on March 20, 1983, Zybszko immediately offered him US$25,000 for the title, which Brooks accepted. His reign lasted until April 30 of that year, when NWA President Bob Geigel stripped Zbyszko of the title due to the manner in which he had acquired it. A tournament was held for the vacant title, which Zbyszko entered. He defeated Mr. Wrestling II in the tournament final on May 6, 1983 in Atlanta, Georgia to regain the title. His second reign lasted until September 25, 1983, when he lost to Brett Wayne in Atlanta. American Wrestling Association (1984‚Äì1987) In March 1984, Zbyszko joined the Minneapolis, Minnesota-based American Wrestling Association. He was awarded the newly created AWA America's Championship in January 1985, and engaged in a lengthy feud with Sgt. Slaughter, who defeated him for the title on June 21, 1985 in Chicago, Illinois. Throughout the feud, Zbyszko drew the ire of fans by fleeing the ring and stalling for minutes at a time whenever Slaughter gained an advantage (in an April 2004 interview, Zbyszko claimed that the longest he ever stalled for was sixteen minutes). Zbyszko feuded with Nick Bockwinkel throughout 1986, losing to him in a Texas death match at Rage in a Cage on April 28, 1986. In the course of the feud, he also vied with Bockwinkel's ally Ray Stevens and boxer Scott LeDoux. Zybszko lost to LeDoux in a boxing match at WrestleRock '86 on April 20, 1986 and fought him to a double count out at Battle by the Bay on June 28, 1986. On May 2, 1987, Zbyszko helped Curt Hennig defeat Nick Bockwinkel for the AWA World Heavyweight Championship by handing him a roll of dimes to knock Bockwinkel out with. He was suspended \\"for life\\" by the AWA as a result of an assault on Bockwinkel during Bockwinkel's rematch with Hennig in July 1987. As Bockwinkel retired shortly after the incident, Zbyszko began claiming to have retired both Bockwinkel and Bruno Sammartino. National Wrestling Alliance (1987‚Äì1989) In November 1987, Zbyszko joined Jim Crockett Promotions, where he was managed by Baby Doll. He began feuding with Barry Windham, and on January 24, 1988 in Uniondale, New York he defeated Windham for the NWA Western States Heritage Championship. After Baby Doll left Zbyszko he gained a new manager in Gary Hart, who placed him in a tag team with Al Perez. Perez and Zbyszko feuded with Kendall Windham and Dustin Rhodes. It was also during this time that Hart was asking for NWA World Title shots for both Zbyszko and Perez. It was claimed by Hart and even announcer Jim Ross that Zbyszko and Perez both had the ability to beat Flair for the title, but neither received title shots and the NWA quickly dropped the overtures. Crockett Promotions was under new ownership and both Zbyszko and Perez were essentially left without an angle. Zbyszko signed with the AWA in January 1989 and the NWA Western States Heritage Championship, which Zbyszko still held at that point, was subsequently retired. American Wrestling Association (1989‚Äì1990) Zbyszko took part in an eighteen-man battle royal in Saint Paul, Minnesota on February 7, 1989 to fill the vacant AWA World Heavyweight Championship. By stalling and avoiding confrontations with other wrestlers, Zbyszko was able to remain in the match until only two men remained: himself and Tom Zenk. The two men fought for several minutes. When Zenk went for a pin, referee Gary DeRusha inexplicably entered the ring to make the count. Zbyszko kicked out and the two continued in what now appeared to be a conventional wrestling match. DeRusha ended up taking a bump and was unable to make the three count when Zenk covered Zbyszko for the pin. As DeRusha slowly recovered, Zenk continued to dominate the match. As he attempted a flying body press, however, Zbyszko managed to catch him in mid-air and deliver a fallaway slam, throwing him over the top rope and to the ground below. Zbyszko was thus the new AWA World Heavyweight Champion. Early in his title reign, Zbyszko would feud with Wahoo McDaniel and Sgt. Slaughter. He would face Greg Gagne on June 23, 1989 at War in the Windy City, and David Sammartino, who he defeated at the Tri-State Winter Challenge on January 27, 1990. He then began feuding with Mr. Saito, who defeated him for the AWA World Heavyweight Championship on February 10, 1990 at Super Fight In Tokyo Dome during a tour of Japan. Zbyszko regained the title at SuperClash 4 on April 8, 1990, in Saint Paul and successfully defended it against The Trooper, Brad Rheingans, and Nikita Koloff (who he defeated on May 5, 1990 at Twin Wars '90) toward the end of his reign. He was stripped of the title after leaving the AWA for World Championship Wrestling on December 12, 1990, and the AWA declared bankruptcy in 1991, making Zbyszko the last man to reign as AWA World Heavyweight Champion. World Championship Wrestling (1990‚Äì2000) In December 1990, Zbyszko returned to the NWA. Zbyszko initially teamed with Terrence Taylor, a member of The York Foundation, but was not recruited to the stable. Zbyszko was paired with Arn Anderson as the Enforcers in the late summer of 1991. After Scott Steiner, one-half of the World Tag Team Champions, was injured, the titles were vacated on July 18, 1991, and placed on the line in an eight-man tag team tournament. The tournament finals were held on September 5, 1991 at Clash of the Champions XVI: Fall Brawl and pitted the Enforcers against Rick Steiner and Bill Kazmeier. At the outset of the event, the Enforcers struck Kazmeier with a weight during a weightlifting demonstration, injuring his ribs. This enabled them to defeat Steiner and Kazmeier for the titles in the main event. At Halloween Havoc, The Enforcers began feuding with Barry Windham and Dustin Rhodes, and broke Windham's hand by slamming the door of his car on his hand. Following this act, Zbyszko gave himself the sobriquet the \\"Cruncher\\". Windham was replaced by Ricky Steamboat, and at Clash of the Champions XVII on November 19, 1991 in Savannah, Georgia, the Enforcers lost the titles to Steamboat and Rhodes. In December 1991, the Enforcers joined Paul E. Dangerously's Dangerous Alliance, which also included Rick Rude, \\"Stunning\\" Steve Austin, Bobby Eaton and Madusa. They feuded with Ricky Steamboat, Dustin Rhodes, Barry Windham, Nikita Koloff, Sting and the WCW World Heavyweight Champion Ron Simmons. On May 17, 1992 at WrestleWar 1992: WarGames, the Dangerous Alliance lost a WarGames match to their rivals after Zbyszko accidentally hit Eaton in the arm with the turnbuckle that he had dismantled, forcing Eaton to submit as a result of the pain. As a result of his blunder, Zbyszko was fired from the stable by Dangerously, turning him into a face for the first time since 1980. He briefly feuded with Austin and Eaton before retiring from full-time competition to become a color commentator. One of his first appearances as a commentator occurred at Starrcade alongside of Missy Hyatt. As a commentator, Zbyszko began referring to himself simply as \\"The Living Legend\\", as many WCW fans were unfamiliar with his feud with Bruno Sammartino. He also hosted an interview segment, \\"Larry Z's Legends\\" on WCW television which only lasted a few weeks. In March 1994, Zbyszko began hosting WCW Pro, alongside Dusty Rhodes and Gordon Solie. Shortly thereafter, Lord Steven Regal began harassing Zbyszko, prompting him to return to the ring. On May 2, 1994 in Atlanta, Zbyszko defeated Regal for the WCW World Television Championship. He held the title until June 23, 1994 when Regal regained the belt in Charleston, South Carolina. In 1996, Zbyszko was promoted to the WCW Monday Nitro broadcast team, where he announced during the first hour with Tony Schiavone. In 1997, he was antagonized by New World Order (nWo) member Scott Hall, but Hall opted not to face Zbyszko. Zbyszko remained in the broadcast booth for most of 1997, occasionally refereeing matches involving Hall and the nWo. On October 13, 1997, Zbyszko got involved in a WCW Tag Team Championship match between the Steiner Brothers and Scott Hall and Syxx (subbing for an injured Kevin Nash) and counted the ensuing fall for the Steiner Brothers who became the champions. This reign was official despite Zbyszko not being an official referee, a role he previously played in Scott Hall's match against Lex Luger at Halloween Havoc (1997). On December 28, 1997 at StarrCade 1997, Zbyszko returned to the ring for a match against Bischoff for control of WCW Monday Nitro with Bret Hart acting as special referee. Hart ensured that the nWo did not interfere, and Zbyszko won the match, regaining control of Nitro for WCW. He continued to feud with Hall and his lackey, Louie Spicolli, culminating in a match between Zbyszko and Hall at Souled Out 1998 on January 24, 1998. Zbyszko won the match by disqualification after Dusty Rhodes betrayed him, joining the nWo. Zbyszko went back to commentating, becoming part of the main Thunder announce team in April along with Mike Tenay, leaving Nitro. On December 6, 1999, when he faced Curt Hennig in a retirement match on Nitro and lost. He returned in January 2000 as a member of the Old Age Outlaws with Terry Funk, Arn Anderson and Paul Orndorff to feud with the revived nWo, then returned to commentary in February until he was released from his WCW contract in late 2000. Independent circuit (2001‚Äì2005) After being released from World Championship Wrestling Zbyszko was rumored to be the replacement for Jerry Lawler as the commentator for Monday Night Raw in early 2001 after Lawler quit the company. Zbyszko did an interview with Live Audio Wrestling saying he wanted the job. These rumors never materialized as Paul Heyman would go on to become the color commentator for Monday Night Raw until Jerry Lawler returned to the company later that year. In 2001 Zbyszko wrestled several matches for Dusty Rhodes's Turnbuckle Championship Wrestling promotion. In late 2001, Zbyszko requested that World Wrestling Entertainment cease referring to Chris Jericho as \\"The Living Legend\\", claiming that this infringed upon his common law trademark. After WWF refused to comply, with chairman Vince McMahon personally addressing Jericho as \\"The Living Legend\\" during a televised broadcast, Zbyszko launched a lawsuit against WWF. In addition, he challenged McMahon to a shoot fight during a 2002 World Wrestling All-Stars pay-per-view. In 2002, Zbyszko had a short feud with Chris Harris in the Nashville, Tennessee-based USA Championship Wrestling promotion. On March 2, 2002, Zbyszko defeated Harris for the USA North American Heavyweight Championship. He held the title until March 30, 2002 when Harris regained the belt at the Tojo Yamamoto Memorial Show. On August 27, 2005 at WrestleReunion in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, Zbyszko faced Diamond Dallas Page, with the provision that he would receive five minutes alone in the ring with the sixty-nine-year-old Bruno Sammartino if he won. Page knocked Zbyszko out with his signature Diamond Cutter, however, then pulled Zbyszko on top of him, thus giving him the win by pinfall. Sammartino then entered the ring and began throttling the still-prone Zbyszko until he was dragged away. Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2003‚Äì2006) Zbyszko debuted in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling on January 15, 2003 and delivered a speech in which he exhorted the roster to respect tradition. This sparked a feud with A.J. Styles, who was not receptive to Zbyszko's requests. On January 29, 2003 Zbyszko faced Styles in a ten-minute- long match with the stipulation that, should Styles be unable to pin him twice in that time, he would become Styles's manager. Styles was only able to pin Zbyszko once, and Zbyszko managed him for a short time before booker Vince Russo cancelled the angle and Zbyszko left the promotion. He returned for one night on August 6, 2003, losing to Kid Kash following interference from Abyss. Zbyszko made a full-time return to TNA on June 23, 2004, assisting Ron Killings in his feud with Jeff Jarrett. On July 14, 2004, Killings, Zbyszko, Dusty Rhodes, Konnan and B.G. James defeated Jarrett, Ken Shamrock and \\"The Elite Guard\\" (Shawn Hernandez, Chad Collyer and Onyx) in a \\"ten-man guitar on a pole match\\". Along with Harley Race and Terry Funk, Zbyszko was appointed to a body known as the Championship Committee. The Committee would watch matches on TNA Impact!, most of which had a ten-minute time limit, and determine a winner in the eventuality of a draw. As on practise few professional wrestling matches end in a draw, the Committee was gradually phased out. In February 2005, Zbyszko joined Planet Jarrett, Jarrett's dominant heel stable. He disappeared several weeks later. On June 19, 2005, at TNA Slammiversary 2005, the returning Zbyszko was named Director of Authority, replacing Dusty Rhodes. His first act as DOA was to give Jeff Jarrett's place in the King of the Mountain match later that night to Raven. At TNA Sacrifice 2005 on August 14, Zbyszko responded to Jarrett's request for a shot at the NWA World Heavyweight Championship by informing him that he would receive a title shot if he won his tag team match that night, but would be banned from receiving a title shot for a year if he lost the match. As Jarrett's partner, Rhino, won the match, neither stipulation was applicable. Zbyszko remained neutral for several months, but in October 2005 he became exasperated with Raven, who continually accused him of robbing the NWA World Heavyweight Championship and refusing to grant him a rematch. At TNA Genesis 2005 on November 13, Zbyszko told Raven to resign from TNA or have his life \\"made hell\\". After Raven refused to resign, Zbyszko forced him to wrestle P.J. Polaco. Much to Zbysko's chagrin, Raven defeated Polaco. Nevertheless, Zbyszko continued his personal crusade against Raven, and to that end booked him into a Raven's House of Fun Match, again with an unknown opponent, for the December 3 episode of Impact!. The opponent turned out to be the entire Diamonds in the rough stable (Simon Diamond, Elix Skipper, and David Young). Despite interference from Cassidy Riley on Raven's behalf, he was pinned and lost the match. Raven went on to defeat his former tag team partner Chris K. at TNA Turning Point 2005. At Final Resolution 2006 on January 15, 2006, Raven was scheduled to face a mystery opponent, with the stipulation that he would receive a shot at the NWA World Heavyweight Championship if he was victorious, but would be fired if he was defeated. Raven lost to the returning Sean Waltman after Zbyszko, who refereed the match after the original referee was knocked unconscious, distracted Raven so that Waltman could deliver an X Factor and then counted to three despite Raven placing his foot on a ring rope. Following the match, Zbyszko ordered the TNA security to escort Raven from \\"my arena\\", then mocked Raven until he was confronted by Jackie Gayda about an undisclosed issue. At TNA Lockdown 2006 on April 23, 2006, the debuting Christy Hemme handed commentator Mike Tenay an envelope containing a message from \\"TNA management\\" stating that Zbyszko had been placed on probation due to his conduct, while Raven had been reinstated. Raven then entered the arena and approached the ring, causing Zbyszko to evade him until he was removed by security guards. At TNA Victory Road 2006 on July 17, 2006, Zbyszko lost to Raven in a hair versus hair match. On the October 5 edition of iMPACT he booked a match where the man who was pinned would be fired. He interfered in the match after he hit Eric Young with a golf club. Jim Cornette booked a match at Bound for Glory between him and Young where the loser would be fired. He would then go on to lose the match to Eric Young at Bound for Glory, he was fired a week later.  Return to the independent circuit (2007‚Äì2012) Zbyszko with several wrestlers in the Team Vision Dojo Zbyszko returned to the independent circuit and claimed the AWA Superstars of Wrestling World Heavyweight Championship in AWA Superstars of Wrestling. Zbyszko started rallying for what he claimed was rightfully his since mid-2007. The situation heated up immediately after the then AWA Superstars of Wrestling board of directors stripped Masato Tanaka of the World's title. Zbyszko, through his newly named \\"representative\\" Mister Saint Laurent and legal representation, started filing documentation, to the new AWA Superstars of Wrestling Management Team, proving he had never lost the title in 1991 when Verne Gagne's American Wrestling Association entered into bankruptcy. After considerable deliberation and review of the bankruptcy file from the early 1990s, the AWA agreed with Zbyszko that he did indeed never actually lose the title. Accordingly, Zbyszko was once again the recognized AWA Superstars of Wrestling World Heavyweight Championship. He lost the title to Brian Logan. Logan defeated Larry Zbyszko and Ricky Landell in a three-way match on April 18, 2008 at a Mountaineer Wrestling Association event in Fayetteville, West Virginia. On March 22, 2008, Larry was inducted into the XWF Hall of Fame by its creator Jack Blaze at their \\"XWF March Madness 2008\\" event. XWF was later renamed LPW (Legends Pro Wrestling) where Larry is still honored in their Hall of Fame- Class 2008. Four Territories of the AWA Superstars of Wrestling have broken away from AWA Superstars of Wrestling, however, and joined with Championship Wrestling of Tennessee to create the American Wrestling Affiliates. Brian Logan took his championship reign and belt with himAmerican Wrestling Affiliates ‚Äì Official Website and Zbyszko is once again recognized as the AWA Superstars World Heavyweight Champion as AWA Superstars of Wrestling retroactively refused to recognize the title change. He dropped the title to Ricky Landell on October 11. In 2009, Full Impact Pro hired Zbyszko as the executive director of the FIP Championship committee. Zbyszko competed at the ROH show on January 29 as a part of Wrestle Reunion 4 where he had a match with Scotty 2 Hotty.ROH Show  WrestleReunion In March 2010 Zbyszko started appearing at live events for the WFX WrestlingWFX in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. Shortly after his debut, he was named the interim commissioner of the promotion, and makes regular appearances. He competed in one match for the promotion thus far, teaming with Jessie Godderz, to compete against Bushwacker Luke and Eugene Dinsmore. Zbyszko defeated Palmer Canon for the All Out Mayhem Heavyweight Championship on November 20, 2010, in South Portland, Maine. In late March 2011, it was noted that Chris Jericho was very critical of Zbyszko and his announcing capabilities during his tenure in WCW in his latest book. When this was brought to his attention, Larry proceeded to challenge Jericho to say it to his face, and questioned his manhood in a popular internet video. Zbyszko stated in another video that the reason for Jericho's disrespect was because he could not use the phrase \\"The Living Legend\\" in the WWE because it has been used and trademarked by Zbyszko. On March 17, 2012, In Caribou, Maine Zbyszko defeated Ryan Michaels in a lumberjack match to retain the All Out Mayhem Heavyweight Championship. He would lose the title a month later to Gino Martino in Gray, Maine. Return to WWE (2013‚Äìpresent) In April 2013, after attending the WWE Hall of Fame ceremony, he announced he had signed a WWE Legends contract along with recording interviews for the WWE Network and future DVD releases. He is a regular at NXT TV tapings in Orlando and has appeared at WrestleMania Axxess in recent years. On March 16, 2015, it was announced he would be inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame class of 2015. On March 28 he was inducted by his former mentor and rival Bruno Sammartino. Personal life He married Kathleen Gagne (Daughter of AWA co-founder Verne Gagne and sister of wrestler Greg Gagne) in 1988, and has a son who is also a professional wrestler: Tim Zbyszko. He has three other sons; Michael, John and Robert. Other media Zbyszko (right) signing autographs in 2005 with Bobby Heenan Larry Zbyszko's book, Adventures In Larryland, was released on June 1, 2008.

He had previously represented the new state as one of its first United States Senators; Idaho achieved statehood in July 1890. Early years Born in Michigan and educated in its public schools, McConnell headed west as a freight wagon driver and ended up in California.Richard J. Beck, Famous Idahoans, Williams Printing, ( Richard J. Beck, 1989). There, he found work where he could get it: miner, store clerk, cowboy, and teacher. In 1862, he moved to Oregon, where he taught school, and then followed the gold rush into the Idaho Territory the following year. Perhaps based on his earlier experience in California, McConnell spotted opportunity on the way to the gold fields around Idaho City. Rather than joining the throngs of prospectors, he and two other men claimed some good farmland near Horseshoe Bend. He and the others dug the first significant irrigation ditch along the Payette River and began raising vegetables.James H. Hawley, History of Idaho: The Gem of the Mountains, The S. J. Clarke Publishing Company, Chicago (1920). The following year, McConnell led a pack train loaded with produce over the mountains to Placerville and sold them at \\"fabulous\\" prices. At the time, Idaho Territory was about a year old and law enforcement was scant to non-existent. When he and other settlers along the Payette began to lose horses and mules to thieves, the youthful McConnell took the lead in organizing a Vigilance committee for the region. While it did not end crime in the area, the work of the committee did reduce it and, according to the Illustrated History, \\"The farmers had no further trouble with horse thieves.\\"An Illustrated History of the State of Idaho, The Lewis Publishing Company, Chicago (1899). McConnell later published a history of the period, which included a lengthy account of the vigilantes' work. He offered no apologies and asked for no forgiveness ‚Ä¶ but simply described what he saw as the necessity for what was done.William J. McConnell, Early History of Idaho, Caxton Printer, Caldwell, Idaho (1913). Although, or perhaps because, McConnell was the recognized leader of the vigilantes, in 1865 he was appointed a Deputy U.S. Marshal for Idaho Territory. At the end of his two- year term, he returned to California. Pacific Coast interlude In about 1867, McConnell married Louisa Brown and their first child was born in California, where he owned (or worked in) a general store and raised cattle. About 1871, the family moved to Oregon, where they eventually settled in Yamhill County. There, McConnell owned a general storeU.S. Census, 1880, Yamhill County, Oregon and ran cattle. In 1882, he was elected to the state senate, and was then selected as the senate president.\\"Idaho Governor William John McConnell,\\" Governor's Information, National Governors Association. Return to Idaho Around 1879, McConnell had begun investing in the growing town of Moscow, Idaho, and in 1884 he moved his family there. The general store he opened with a partner in Moscow was for many years considered the finest in the region. When leaders convened a constitutional convention, preparatory to Idaho statehood, McConnell represented Latah County. Moscow is on the National Register; it is open for tours by the Latah County Historical Society. After Idaho became at state on July 3, 1890, McConnell was one of its first U.S. Senators. He served only a short term, which was meant to get the state \\"in sync\\" with a normal election cycle. For a time, the new state actually had three Senators-elect: McConnell, Fred Dubois, and \\"Judge\\" William Clagett. The Senate had to vote on which of the two besides McConnell they would seat ‚Äì they chose Dubois. McConnell's term ended in March 1891, and he decided to run for governor as the candidate for the Republican Party. In a state-level reflection of political turmoil across the country, he won with only a plurality (40.6%) of the vote: candidates for the Democratic and Populist parties split 58% of the rest. A Prohibition Party candidate polled about 1.3%. When he ran for re-election, he won in a similar manner, polling 41.5% of the votes with the Democrats and Populists splitting most of the remaining votes. After his first gubernatorial election, McConnell ended his involvement with the store in Moscow and moved to Boise. There, in 1895, his daughter Mary (or sometimes Mamie) married attorney William E. Borah (1865-1940), who was elected to six terms in the U.S. Senate (1907‚Äì40). Mary lived until 1976, to the advanced age of 105 years. Along with Willis Sweet, McConnell was at the forefront of the movement to locate the University of Idaho in Moscow. A residence hall built in 1957 was named for him. Gubernatorial activities Taking office in 1893 as a minority candidate did not smooth McConnell's task as Idaho's third governor. (The first governor, George L. Shoup, resigned after serving just a few months before being elected for a full term as a U.S. Senator.) Having been so recently granted statehood, Idaho had to work out many details of how the state would be governed. Thus, many problems landed on his desk.Robert C. Sims, Hope A. Benedict (eds.), Idaho's governors: Historical Essays on Their Administrations, Boise State University (1992). Under McConnell's administrations, Idaho did away with a \\"test oath\\" whose effect was to disenfranchise the state's considerable body of Mormon voters. Also, the state was the fourth to grant women the right to vote, in 1896. The state also initiated the infrastructure needed to administer irrigation projects eligible for Carey Act consideration. Several years would pass before a complete and effective system could be put in place, but Idaho eventually became the single greatest success story under the Act. During his tenure, the state suffered ‚Äì along with the nation ‚Äì through the severe depression called the Panic of 1893, when several major railroads and over 500 banks failed. The economic crisis naturally exacerbated the conflict between labor unions and companies, especially in the silver mines in the Coeur d'Alene region of North Idaho. The crisis in Idaho deepened with the repeal of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act ‚Äì the Federal government was no longer required to purchase a set monthly amount of silver. The resulting crash in prices squeezed the mining companies, leading to layoffs and moves to cut wages. The subsequent unrest, and flare-ups of violence, led McConnell to threaten the use of troops to keep the peace. Afterwards McConnell did not run for a third term, perhaps realizing that his mainstream Republican Party was going to lose badly. McConnell was himself a \\"Free Silver\\" supporter, but refused to abandon the Party over one divisive issue. As expected, a coalition of Democrats, Populists, and Silver-Republicans swept the 1896 state elections; mainstream Republicans retained only one seat in the legislature. Fortunately for McConnell, Republican William McKinley handily beat William Jennings Bryan, the Democratic/Populist candidate for president. As a reward for his party loyalty, he received an appointment in the Bureau of Indian Affairs, a position he held until 1901. Later, he served as an Immigration Service Inspector from 1909 until his death in 1925. McConnell's memorial service in Moscow was held at the auditorium (of the administration building) at the University of Idaho, which included most of the states's dignitaries. He and his wife Louisa (1846‚Äì1930) are buried in the Moscow Cemetery.  References External links *National Governors Association * University of Idaho Tumblr - William J.

He is one of the most powerful beings in the DC Universe, having enslaved many worlds. He is an adversary of the Teen Titans and the Justice League, the father and the arch- enemy of the superhero Raven, and the husband of Arella. Seamus Dever portrayed the disguised human version of Trigon in the Titans television series, while also voicing his true form. Publication history Trigon first appeared in a cameo in New Teen Titans #2 (December 1980) and his first full appearance is New Teen Titans #4. He was created by Marv Wolfman and George P√©rez.The New Teen Titans #2 Fictional character biography A sadistic, cruel, dangerous, and powerful demon of inter and extra-dimensional origin, Trigon is a result of the mating between a female member of a mystic sect and the god they worshipped. A side effect of this pairing is that their child was filled with the cast-off evil energies of the inhabitants of Azarath, forming him into their personification. At birth, Trigon killed everyone around him (including his own mother), at the age of one, he ruled an entire planet, at the age of six, he destroyed an entire planet. By the age of 30, he held dominion over millions of worlds in his dimension.New Teen Titans #6. DC Comics. There is some confusion regarding the origins of Trigon, as he claims to have existed as formless energy since the beginning of his own universe, while the energies cast off by Azar and Azarath simply allowed him to take physical form roughly a thousand years before DC's present day. Arella was a depressed woman who decided to join a cult known as the Church of Blood that was trying to kill Trigon. When the ritual was performed, Trigon, disguised as a handsome male, emerged and married Arella. After making love, Arella discovered Trigon's true nature after seeing his true form. Trigon sends Arella back to Earth, and Arella is pregnant and on the brink of suicide when she is found by an extra-dimensional cult and is brought to Azarath, where she gives birth to their daughter Raven. Raven is brought up to \\"control her emotions\\" in order to suppress and control the demonic powers she inherited from Trigon.New Teen Titans #6. DC Comics. During this time, Trigon was aware of his daughter's whereabouts, but rarely intervened, except when a renegade monk named Juris attempted to cast Raven as an infant into another dimension to avert her potential threat; Trigon struck him down at the moment of the deed, and allowed the cult to keep her safe at present. Raven learned of Trigon's intentions to conquer the Earth and vowed to stop him; she initially approached the Justice League, but they refused her on the advice of Zatanna, who sensed her demonic parentage. In desperation, she reformed the Teen Titans with several new members in order to fight her father. The team was eventually able to defeat Trigon and seal him in an interdimensional prison. However, Raven still had to fight her father's influence as he was not completely destroyed. Trigon eventually escaped and came to Earth, taking control of Raven and destroying Azarath in the process. The Titans came together and tried to fight Trigon, but were contaminated by his demonic influence and killed Raven; this allowed the souls of Azarath to possess her and use her as a channel to kill Trigon‚Äîthe demonic possession had been part of a plan to defeat Trigon, as the Titans would never have killed Raven on their own‚Äîblasting him out of existence with a beam of purifying light. Although Trigon is gone, his followers (led by Brother Blood) have tried to revive him several times.Teen Titans #8. DC Comics.Teen Titans #10. DC Comics. The Sons of Trigon Three of Trigon's sons.

Raven notices that Trigon has returned and is responsible for the recent attacks on past and present members of the Teen Titans.Titans (vol. 2) #1. DC Comics. The cause of his resurrection from the dead has not been revealed, but the motive for these renewed attack is that a war with rival demons has spread Trigon's forces too thinly and left him desperately weak, which forces him to turn his focus on Earth in hopes of creating a new power base.Titans (vol. 2) #3. DC Comics. Three of Trigon's sons, Jacob, Jared and Jesse, play a significant role in his return to life. The brothers have the ability to induce the seven deadly sins in any living being: they can induce wrath (Jared), lust (Jacob) and envy (Jesse).Titans (vol. 2) #4. DC Comics. They attempt to open the portal to Trigon's realm, but then betray their father and steal what little power he has left; this actually makes Trigon proud of them for proving to be just as evil as he is. The trio leave, thinking they have gained great power, and Trigon is left trapped in his realm. However, the three brothers then return and corrupt their half-sister, making her their ally.Titans (vol. 2) #5. DC Comics. Eventually, they are defeated by Raven and the Titans. The New 52 In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Trigon makes his post-Flashpoint debut in issue #1 of the Phantom Stranger.Phantom Stranger #1. DC Comics. In this incarnation, Trigon has an extra set of eyes, giving him six in total. He has struck a bargain with the Stranger to return his offspring Raven (living under the assumed name of Rachel Roth) to him; in return, he pledges to spare Earth from his armies that were ready to search the Earth for her, having already destroyed Azarath years ago. In The New 52, it is revealed that Trigon has at least four children, where Raven is the youngest. Her older brothers are named Belial, Ruskoff, and Suge; Belial is the oldest and most civilized, according to himself, of the three brothers.Phantom Stranger #2. DC Comics. Later, Trigon returns to Earth, feeling confident in having swayed Raven to his side during their time together in his demonic realm, where time flows differently. Trigon is shown to be the ruler of six kingdoms known as the Under-Realms, a collective title for the planets and dimensions he conquered, although he has since grown bored with the dull responsibilities of ruling them. At first, he ruled through his own power, then through conquest on the battlefield and finally through subterfuge. His ultimate goal is to unite all seven realms and pass the mantle of leadership to Raven, whom he believes will mold them all in her own image, something only she can do as she has the capacity to love, an emotion Trigon cannot feel or comprehend. As part of DC Villains Month, Trigon replaced the Teen Titans as the main characters in their book for one issue named #23.1, with Deathstroke taking over #23.2. The Teen Titans book resumed publishing after Villains Month concluded. Though unconfirmed, the Villains Month event leaves Trigon's origins in question. Long ago, in another universe, a trinity of beings called the Divine attempted to eradicate the concept of evil through an item known as the Heart of Darkness. When the Divine return to a world they believed liberated, they find it in utter chaos along with the being they believe to be responsible, only because he appears not to be one of the planet's inhabitants. As they had done billions of times before, they sentence him and his two guards to the Heart of Darkness, hoping that it would consume the evil within them. However, they were horrified when the stranger not only resisted but consumed the Heart of Darkness, absorbing the evils of a billion worlds, and mutating into the being that would become known as Trigon. Now driven by an insatiable hunger for evil, Trigon moves slowly from universe to universe, spreading corruption and sin among the worlds he finds in order to sate a hunger that knows no end.Teen Titans (vol. 3) #23.1-23.2. DC Comics. Much later, Trigon encounters a woman wearing a suit of armor specifically crafted to counter his immense powers. Though neither is able to slay the other, Trigon is forced to retreat, swearing that members of his blood would return in their thousands to destroy the wearer of the Silent Armor. Trigon has since set his plans into action, only to run into the problem of most of the mothers of his children being unable to survive mating with him, leaving Trigon with only three sons, all of whom he considers failures. Then, one day, he is brought a human woman from Earth, Arella, who gives him his first daughter Raven, the most powerful of Trigon's children, and the reason why Trigon now targets Earth for conquest. Powers and abilities Trigon is a very powerful demon who has Telepathy, Telekinesis, Pyrokinesis, Superhuman Strength and Stamina, Reality Warping and Chronokinesis. He was able to reshape the entire planet Earth on a whim; had drained the souls of universes, destroyed entire planets and conquered dimensions, seemingly omniscient, granted powerful psionic powers to Psimon; and could create hordes of demons under his command, as well as open wormholes to other worlds. In addition, Trigon was easily able to defeat the Teen Titans and the Justice League. Trigon can take on a human form to deceive others. In this form, he appears as an attractive and muscular man with blonde hair and glowing gold eyes, he is also Immortal, meaning he cannot age and die of natural causes. The Children of Trigon each wield the power of a Deadly Sin bestowed as a gift from their father. Jared unleashes anger and wrath in his opponents. Jesse sees into the mind of his victims and transforms himself into the thing they envy most as well as taking on said envy's powers and abilities to add to his own. Jacob invokes lust into the hearts of his prey. Raven also possesses this power, and is capable of inducing pride; however, doing so will leave her sick and nauseated for several days. It is not clear whether this is caused by the demonic power itself or by her revulsion towards using it. Other versions * In the DC Bombshells continuity, Das Trigon was a primal mountain spirit in the German Alps who had a change of heart after his lover Azaria gave birth to his daughter, Rachel. After Azaria's death, Trigon reverts to his monotonous ways and accepts Killer Frost's offer for a place in their new world. Raven has visions of her father's horrendous actions and confronts him in Russia, where he was one of the mythological creatures working for Captain Cold. Raven offers her father a chance at redemption as he aids her in confronting Faora. Faora kills Trigon, resulting in Raven's magic becoming unstable and transforming her into a demonic beast. As she calms down, Faora injects herself with a sample of Raven's unstable demonic blood to become Doomsday. * Trigon appears in the Injustice: Gods Among Us comics. He is seen when Raven scares away several nomadic tribes in the Sudan, and is mentioned by the alternate Wonder Woman when Diana questions Raven's loyalty. Raven admits that she is Trigon's servant, and not Superman's, and that \\"all shall bow down before him!\\" * Trigon makes appearances in Tiny Titans as Raven's father and occasional substitute teacher. This version of Trigon is depicted as a silly, bumbling, but devoted father who often walks Raven to school. He enjoys skating wearing silly wigs, barbecuing if he can get the grill going, spending time with Raven and a toddler Kid Devil and he also enjoys surfing with Principal Slade from the school when they leave Lunchlady Darkseid in charge. In other media=Television Teen Titans animated series. * Trigon appears in the Teen Titans animated series voiced by Keith Szarabajka (in the first season) and by Kevin Michael Richardson (in the fourth season). He serves as the main antagonist of the fourth season. More or less the same as his comic book counterpart, he is evil incarnate and probably the most terrible threat the Teen Titans face. He possesses vast reality manipulation powers, enabling him to reshape the surface of the Earth on a whim, revive the dead (either as superpowered undead servants or flesh and blood), and rip the fabric of space to transport his army across vast distances. He can bring a person's inner darkness to life, creating an exact replica of that person, down to their powers and memories. He also possesses more generic superhuman abilities such as firing energy blasts, creating force fields, and pyrokinesis (control of fire) [the latter of which he can impart to his servants]. In the season one episode \\"Nevermore\\", he first appears unnamed and as a manifestation of anger within Raven's mind. As the main antagonist in the fourth season, Trigon reappears with a different appearance. Trigon resurrects Slade Wilson to force Raven into releasing him upon the Earth. In the three- part finale \\"The End\\", Trigon finally emerges and destroys the Earth; the Teen Titans are spared by a fraction of Raven's power before releasing Trigon. The Titans and Slade launch an all-out assault on Trigon, but he quickly defeats them. In the end, it is Raven (in her White form) that defeats Trigon using her own strengthened mystical abilities of pure light to obliterate Trigon, undoing the destruction he had caused in the process. It has been mentioned by the show's writers that Trigon was a nightmare of a villain to them due to his near-omnipotent powers, meaning that, realistically, the Teen Titans would stand no chance against the villain if he attacked them. The original 'Terror of Trigon' story contained a solution, due to the writers also being faced with the same problem, and the show adapted it from the comic books. * Trigon appears in the New Teen Titans segment of DC Nation Shorts, with Kevin Michael Richardson reprising his role. In one short, he arrives at Titans Tower to visit Raven. When Raven tries to shut the door on him, Trigon sticks his huge fingernail in the door's way and gives Raven a stuffed bunny. Raven uses her powers to chop off his fingernail so the door will close and then uses her powers to tear the stuffed bunny to pieces. * Trigon appears in the Teen Titans Go! series, voiced again by Kevin Michael Richardson with no connection to the original Teen Titans series. This version of Trigon is portrayed as being a bumbling dad who wants what is best for his daughter, which is for her to accept her demon heritage and join him in destroying universes. The Teen Titans did not know that Trigon was Raven's father before his debut in \\"Dog Hand\\". Trigon's appearances have a reoccurring theme of tempting Raven to embrace her demonic heritage: buttering up his daughter's teammates by giving them new superpowers in \\"Dog Hand\\", making Raven jealous by bonding with Starfire in \\"Caramel Apples\\", and literally getting in his daughter's head to drive her insane in \\"Crazy Day\\". * Trigon appears in DC Super Hero Girls, voiced once again by Kevin Michael Richardson. While he continues to want Raven to follow in his footsteps and practice dark magic in this version, he is much more forgiving and eventually lets Raven en-roll in Superhero High rather than home school her, eventually taking part in various parent boards and activities as well. Trigon as seen in Titans * Trigon appears as the main antagonist in Titans, portrayed by Seamus Dever in his human likeness while also voicing his demon form. His real form was revealed as a red demon with horns, a cape-like outfit, and four eyes. Trigon is behind \\"The Organization\\", a secret group hunting Rachel Roth, the Nuclear Family, a band of unassuming assassins, and Dr. Adamson, a scientist and caretaker of the Nuclear Family, as seen in the episodes \\"Hawk and Dove\\" and \\"Together\\". Trigon appears in human form in the episode \\"Koriand'r\\", where Rachel is persuaded by her birth mother, Angela Azarath, to call him. As Trigon heals Garfield Logan while finding his existence fascinating as his human and animal sides are at war with each other, he tells Angela that he can begin his plan to conquer Earth only when he rids Rachel of her human half. In the episode \\"Dick Grayson\\", Trigon subjects Dick Grayson to an illusionary world where Batman started killing his enemies, leading to Dick killing him as part of Trigon's scheme to have Dick embrace his inner darkness. In the episode \\"Trigon\\", Hawk, Dove, and Jason Todd arrive at Angela's house, joining Donna and Kory in attempting to stop Trigon, but they all become corrupted by his immense power. Trigon then breaks his daughter's will by having the heroes seemingly beat Gar to death. With Rachel under his control, Trigon begins to destroy all life around him, starting with Angela. However, Gar survives and uses his friendship with Rachel to help her reject her father's control. Rachel saves Dick and tricks her father, defeating him and freeing her friends. She then seals Trigon's essence into a small jewel which she wears on her forehead, deciding that she alone will be responsible for ensuring he can never rise to power again. Film * Trigon appears in the animated film Justice League vs. Teen Titans, voiced by Jon Bernthal. This version can create and send demons to possess others, a trait he uses to manipulate the Justice League into attacking the Teen Titans and capture his daughter Raven. According to Ra's al Ghul, one of many spirits he controls, Trigon is also responsible for creating the Lazarus Pits. He is eventually defeated by the combined forces of the Teen Titans and the Justice League, with Raven personally fashioning a prison for him out of a crystal shard which she affixes to her forehead; she jokes that this means they can \\"finally spend some time together\\". * Trigon makes a non- physical cameo in Teen Titans Go! To the Movies. When Robin is sad due not getting his own movie, all the Titans remind him how they would have ended had he not enlisted them to be part of the Teen Titans, with Raven mentioning that if she had not been recruited, she would have most likely gone on to enslave many worlds alongside Trigon. * The Teen Titans Go! and Teen Titans animated series versions of Trigon appear as the main antagonists in Teen Titans Go! vs. Teen Titans with Kevin Michael Richardson reprising the role for both versions and Rhys Darby voicing his Master of Games alias. The 2013 Go! version of Trigon disguises himself as \\"The Master of Games\\" and pits the 2013 Titans against the original 2003 animated series versions of the Titans. He uses this as an opportunity to absorb his Raven's demonic powers to resurrect the 2003 Trigon, whom he plans to conquer the multiverse with. However, when his original counterpart continues to mock and blame him for every mistake made, 2013 Trigon absorbs 2003 Trigon and transforms into a being known as Hexagon. With help from Titans throughout the multiverse, the two animated Titans teams are able to take back Raven's powers; destroying the original Trigon once more in the process while the 2013 Trigon was sent to a zombie dimension. * Trigon appears in the animated film Justice League Dark: Apokolips War, voiced by John DiMaggio. Still imprisoned in Raven's crystal shard following his defeat, Trigon attempted to escape; gradually weakening Raven in the process. During the Justice League's second invasion of Apokolips however, he helps her overcome several deadly traps. After Robin dies trying to save his father, Raven's anger eventually releases Trigon from his prison. He possesses Superman, kills Constantine, and battles Darkseid; though Superman breaks free after witnessing Lois Lane's death. Initially weakened, Constantine (now revived) and Raven restore Trigon's physical form and power so he can continue fighting Darkseid, giving the heroes time to escape while Cyborg generates a Boom Tube to obliterate Apokolips. Before Raven leaves, Trigon thanks Raven for reviving him and bids her well before grabbing Darkseid and plunging themselves into oblivion. Video games * Trigon appears in Teen Titans, not as a boss character, but as a playable character that can be unlocked in the Master of Games mini-game portion. * Trigon is featured in DC Universe Online. He and his forces find their way to Earth and end up attacking Metropolis' Tomorrow District. He even takes control of Raven in a plot to destroy the city and captures the other Titan members Starfire, Cyborg, Nightwing and Donna Troy while corrupting them. When the players free the possessed Titans, Trigon's hold on Raven gets stronger, causing the players and the Titans to split up to find Raven. With help from Zatanna, the players end up heading into the portal to Raven's soul self where Trigon uses Raven's possessed spirit to attack the players. After helping Raven fight the last Possessed Raven Spirit, Trigon's evil escapes to Earth. While being brought into Earth by Brother Blood, Trigon then sends his demon minions to corrupt the citizens based on some of the Seven Deadly Sins. Brother Blood's plans to bring Trigon to Earth were thwarted by the players and the Sentinels of Magic. He is served by Demons, Embodiments of Sin, Soul Reavers, Soul Screams, Soul Shadows, Soul Strikers, Possessed Students, and Volatile Succubi. Alternately if you choose the Villain morality, you can help Brother Blood by entering Raven's psyche and destroying her resistance to Trigon which causes him to be unleashed through Raven. Trigon is also a main element in the DLC Pack \\"Sons of Trigon\\", in which players are taking to an alternate dimension in which Gotham has become a wasteland and Circe is trying to release Trigon from his prison. Players fight Circe or Wonder Woman in the alert \\"Trigon¬¥s Prison\\" in which Trigon himself is a scenery element that, although impossible to damage, will attack the players and summon demons until either boss (Circe or Wonder Woman) has been defeated. The game also shows the other sons of Trigon: Julius (gluttony), James (greed), Jared (lust) and Jack (sloth). * Trigon appears as a non-playable character in Injustice: Gods Among Us as assistance to Raven's super move. During Wonder Woman's fight with the alternate version of Raven, it is mentioned that the alternate iteration of Superman's victory will hasten Trigon's return. Trigon can also be fought against in the S.T.A.R. Labs missions, making him one of the only unplayable bosses. In addition to these, Trigon also makes an appearance in Scorpion's ending of classic battle where he had summoned Scorpion to the DC Universe. * Trigon is also featured in the mobile app Teeny Titans, which is a figure battling game that is based on the show Teen Titans Go!. He is one of the characters that player can battle and is also available as two figures that players can battle with and use in the game: one representing his original demonic form and another for his more dad-like incarnation. * Trigon appears as a playable character in Lego DC Super-Villains, voiced by Darin De Paul. Miscellaneous * A character named Roger Trigon appears in the tie-in novel Arrow: Vengeance based on the Arrow TV series. This depiction serves as the head priest of the Church of Blood rather than the demonic entity it worships. Father Trigon founded the Church and found recruits from Starling City's Zandia Orphanage which he was in charge of. Among his recruits were Sebastian Blood and Cyrus Gold aka The Acolyte. Trigon played a huge part in helping Blood rebel against his parents, as well as the one who bestowed Blood with his skull mask. He died before the events of season 2, where Cyrus Gold took over as head of the orphanage while Sebastian Blood started his mayoral campaign (which is revealed to be controlled by Slade Wilson and Isabel Rochev). * Raven's image of Trigon also made an appearance in Raven's mind in Teen Titans Go! #5.

Effects are seen within an hour. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include headache, dry mouth, constipation, and dizziness. Serious side effects may include angioedema, urinary retention, and QT prolongation. Use in pregnancy and breastfeeding are of unclear safety. It works by blocking muscarinic receptors in the bladder thus decreasing bladder contractions. Tolterodine was approved for medical use in 1998. It is available as a generic medication. A month supply costs the NHS about GB¬£2.09 per month as of 2019. In the United States the wholesale cost of this amount is about US$37.16. In 2017, it was the 229th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than two million prescriptions. Medical uses Detrusor overactivity (DO, contraction of the muscular bladder wall) is the most common form of urinary incontinence (UI) in older adults. It is characterized by uninhibited bladder contractions causing an uncontrollable urge to void. Urinary frequency, urge incontinence and nocturnal incontinence occur. Abnormal bladder contractions that coincide with the urge to void can be measured by urodynamic studies. Treatment is bladder retraining, pelvic floor therapy or with drugs that inhibit bladder contractions such as oxybutynin and tolterodine.  Side effects  Known side effects: * Dry mouth * Decreased gastric motility (upset stomach) * Headache * Constipation * Dry eyes * Sleepiness * Urinary retention The following reactions have been reported in patients who have taken tolterodine since it has become available: * Allergic reactions including swelling * Rapid heartbeat or abnormal heartbeat * Accumulation of fluid in the arms and legs * Hallucinations Tolterodine is not recommended for use in people with myasthenia gravis and angle closure glaucoma.  Pharmacology  Tolterodine acts on M2 and M3 subtypes of muscarinic receptors whereas older antimuscarinic treatments for overactive bladder act more specifically on M3 receptors. Tolterodine, although it acts on all types of receptors, has fewer side effects than oxybutynin (M3 and M1 selective, but more so in the parotid than in the bladder) as tolterodine targets the bladder more than other areas of the body. This means that less drug needs to be given daily (due to efficient targeting of the bladder) and so there are fewer side effects. Brand names It is marketed by Pfizer in Canada and the United States by its brand name Detrol. In Egypt it is also found under the trade names Tolterodine by Sabaa and Incont L.A. by Adwia.

It is Twain's last completed novel, published when he was 61 years old. The novel is presented as a translation by \\"Jean Francois Alden\\" of memoirs by Louis de Conte, a fictionalized version of Joan of Arc's page Louis de Contes. The novel is divided into three sections according to Joan of Arc's development: a youth in Domr√©my, a commander of the army of Charles VII of France, and a defendant at trial in Rouen. The novel was first published as a serialization in Harper's Magazine beginning in April 1895. Twain was aware of his reputation as a comic writer and he asked that each installment appear anonymously so that readers would treat it seriously. Regardless, his authorship soon became known, and Harper and Brothers published the book edition with his name in May 1896. Plot summary Harper's Magazine poster by Edward Penfield for the debut of Personal Recollections of Joan of Arc (April 1895) Introduction The novel begins with a \\"Translator's Preface,\\" a translator note on the \\"Peculiarity of Joan of Arc's History,\\" and a foreword by Sieur Louis de Conte. The \\"Translator's Preface\\" offers a condensed overview of Joan of Arc's life, with heavy praise (\\"the character of Joan of Arc ... occupies the loftiest possible to human attainment\\"). The \\"Peculiarity\\" note explains that Joan of Arc's life is preserved in court documents and that the particulars are provided by Louis de Conte, who, the translator assures us, is reliable. The foreword is Sieur de Conte's writing from 1492 (Joan of Arc died in 1431) about his intimate relation to Joan of Arc: \\"I was with her from the beginning until the end\\" Book One: In Domr√©my Book One begins with the birth of de Conte on January 6, 1410 in Neufch√¢teau, France and his parents' subsequent move to Paris. He relates his early childhood as chaotic with the city tormented by mobs, criminals, and other instabilities. In 1415, following the death of his family by a Burgundian raiding party, de Conte is sent to a small, rural, rudimentary village named Domr√©my to live with the parish priest. Here, he meets young Joan d‚ÄôArc, an illiterate peasant. de Conte tells multiple incidents where Joan is shown to be the wisest, bravest, most virtuous child in Domr√©my, such as her arguments to the priest on the fairies and her treatment of the wandering soldier and the criminal madman. In Chapter VI and VII, de Conte recounts his seeing Joan converse with a divine entity and her explanation that she has been chosen by God to \\"win back France, and set the crown upon the head of His servant that is Dauphin and shall be King.\\" The governor and the people in the Domr√©my mock her when she openly announces this mission; her parents even keep her under watch. Nonetheless, Joan remains adamant. Book Two: In Court and Camp Book Two begins with the elimination of Joan's hindrances. With support from her visions, Joan leaves the village at age 17 to request control of the army from the king. In Chapter IX, after Joan successfully defends herself in trial for witchcraft, the king appoints Joan \\"General-in-Chief of armies.\\" In Chapter X, Joan begins to organize her campaign, writing a letter to the English commanders at Orl√©ans, demanding they vacate France. The English refuse, and Joan attacks immediately and aggressively despite the generals' and counselors' advice that France remain on the defensive. Through this military campaign, Joan secures several victories over the English. On July 5, the English forces surrender at Rheims, allowing the Bloodless March and coronation of Charles to take place. During the coronation, Joan asks the King to remit taxes on Domremy. After the coronation, Joan requests permission to attack Paris, saying that the move would cripple the English forces. The king's wicked counselors, however, oppose her in the attempt. The king initially grants Joan permission to attack, but just as Joan is on the verge of victory, the king announces a long-term truce with Paris, which indicates a ceasefire. Joan and de Conte are upset at the lost opportunity. The final chapter relates the events of May 24, 1430, in which Joan and the French lose a battle to the English and Burgundian troops, resulting in Joan's capture. Throughout Book 2, de Conte speaks of Joan's virtue (her ban on prostitution, gambling, and profanity in the army; her requirement that each man attend church; and her mercy toward English prisoners) as well as Joan's divine powers (her recognizing the king without notice, finding a hidden sword in the church, foreseeing war-wounds and her impending death). Book Three: Trial and Martyrdom The third and final book opens with Joan d‚ÄôArc's imprisonment at Marguy. For five and a half months, the Burgundians hold Joan, waiting for King Charles to provide a ransom of 61,125 francs. When no attempt is made, she is sold to the English. For two more months, Joan remains imprisoned while her enemies, led by Bishop Pierre Cauchon of Beauvais, prepare her trial. In an attempt to lessen her influence over the French people, they decide to try Joan for crimes against religion. Beginning in Chapter IV, the novel provides a detailed account of Joan's three-month-long trial starting on February 21, 1431. de Conte, secretly serving as clerk to the chief recorder, describes the trial as unfair on multiple fronts, including the biased judges and the lack of advocates on her behalf. The questions at trial focus on topics such as the visions, her cross-dressing, and her upbringing. de Conte stresses that Joan, the illiterate peasant, fared extremely well, providing well-spoken answers that could not be twisted against her. Chapter VII recounts her most well-known answer after being asked by Beaupere, ‚ÄúAre you in a state of Grace?‚Äù (This is a trick question asked by Beaupere. According to Catholic teaching, only God knows who is in a state of Grace. By answering either yes or no, Joan can be accused of blasphemy.) Conte states that with simple gravity she answers, ‚ÄúIf I be not in a state of Grace, I pray God place me in it; if I be in it, I pray God keep me so.‚Äù In Chapter XX, Joan finally submits to her captors before she is about to die at the stake. Unable to read, Joan unknowingly signs a document ‚Äúconfessing herself a sorceress, a dealer with devils, a liar, a blasphemer of God and His angels‚Ä¶and this signature of hers bound her to resume the dress of a woman.\\" At the end of Chapter XXI, readers may think that de Conte insinuates Joan d'Arc was raped in prison by the English guards due to the vague wording. It is important, however, to note that at the end of Chapter XXIII, this interpretation is directly gone against by Joan's own statements, relayed by de Conte, during a passionate outburst of indignation and despair by Joan to those dooming her, specifically referring to herself as one who has \\"never been defiled.\\" If this were the case, she would have taken them to task for this cruelty at that time, and it would have been reflected in the narrative. In Chapter XXII, de Conte accuses the English of treachery. While Joan slept, one of the guards removed her female apparel and put male apparel in its place. \\"For modesty's sake,\\" Joan put on the male clothes, \\"the forbidden garments, knowing what the end would be.\\" For breaking the condition that she not wear men's clothing again, Joan is convicted as a \\"relapsed heretic.\\" She burns at the stake on the following Wednesday, May 30, 1431. Conclusion The fictional biographer, de Conte, ends his presentation in the year 1492, where he is 82 years of age. He summarizes the lives and deaths of many of the characters, including Joan's family and King Charles the VII. He closes with a salute to the legacy of Joan, citing her impact on the country she loved so much. Writing process Joan of Arc largely lacks the humor prevalent in Twain's other works, and it has a different tone and flow. He had a personal fascination with Joan of Arc which began in the early 1850s when he found a leaf from her biography and asked his brother Henry if she was a real person. Gioia notes that: \\"Twain was raised in a Southern culture that was deeply suspicious of ‚Äì and sometimes openly hostile to ‚Äì Roman Catholicism and its veneration of saints and relics. He once stated that he had been taught 'enmity toward everything that is Catholic'.\\" Twain claimed to have worked harder on this book than any other. He wrote to H.H. Rogers, \\"I have never done any work before that cost so much thinking and weighing and measuring and planning and cramming.\\" The published book lists 11 official sources as \\"authorities examined in verification of the truthfulness of this narrative\\". Historians today agree that Twain conducted the bulk of his investigation during his prolonged stay in Europe during the early 1890s, which included multiple stops in France. He apparently drew most of his information from the fifth volume of Jules Michelet's Histoire de France and Jules Quicherat's Proces de condamnation et de rehabilitation de Jeanne d‚ÄôArc. Joan of Arc's story was relatively unknown at that time, especially in English-speaking nations, which makes Twain's research noteworthy. Twain based Joan of Arc's physical appearance on his daughter Susy Clemens, as he remembered her at age 17.Ward, Duncan, & Burns (2001), p. 159 He began writing the novel late in 1892, then set it aside until 1894; he finished the manuscript in 1895. He serialized an abridged version for magazine publication, then published the full-length book in 1896. Reception=Twain's self-evaluation, and contemporary critics Twain considered this work to be his best and most important. It was fairly well received in 1893, when first published: One newspaper positively reviewed Twain's work. \\"We meet a dignified, ennobled, hero-worshipping Mark Twain. His language has undergone a startling change. Not flippancy, but pathos, meets us on every page; the sardonic mocking spirit has been conquered by the fair Maid of Orleans, and where aforetime we met laughter, we now meet tears.\\" Twain's daughter Clara Clemens wrote that \\"Andrew Lang so much admired Father‚Äôs Joan that he suggested dedicating to him his own biography of the Maid.\\" As a child, Coley Taylor was Twain's neighbor in Redding, Connecticut, where Twain lived from 1908 until his death in 1910. He told the story of the day when he approached Twain as a young boy to profess his adulation for Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn. Upon hearing the boy's praises, Twain suddenly took on the mien of a vexed schoolteacher. \\"You shouldn‚Äôt read those books about bad boys,\\" he said, wagging his finger in Taylor's face. \\"My best book is my Recollections of Joan of Arc.\\"  20th century critics  However, 20th century critics have not favored Recollections, and it is hardly read or acknowledged in the mainstream today, especially compared to Twain's comedic works such as Huckleberry Finn, Pudd'n Head Wilson, and Tom Sawyer. In the preface to his play Saint Joan, iconoclastic literary critic George Bernard Shaw accused Twain of being \\"infatuated\\" with Joan of Arc. Shaw says that Twain \\"romanticizes\\" the story of Joan, reproducing a legend that the English deliberately rigged the trial to find her guilty of witchcraft and heresy. Recent study of the trial transcripts, however, suggests that Twain's depiction may have been closer to the truth than Shaw was willing to accept. American author and historian Bernard DeVoto was also critical of Joan of Arc, calling it \\"mawkish\\". De Voto also claims that Twain \\"was uncomfortable in the demands of tragedy, formalizing whatever could not be sentimentalized.\\" Maxwell Geismar delivered a scathing review, describing it as Twain's worst book: \\"It is difficult to find anything of interest in Joan of Arc ‚Äì except its badness\\". Twain scholar Louis J. Budd said that Personal Recollections of Joan of Arc \\"has disgraced Twain posthumously with several levels of readers\\", even though \\"it met general approval in 1896\\". Harris expresses befuddlement at this work's placement in Twain's body of works: \\"By the time Twain is writing Recollections, he‚Äôs not a believer. He is anti-Catholic, and he doesn‚Äôt like the French. So he writes a book about a French-Catholic-martyr? Ostensibly, it doesn‚Äôt make a lot of sense.\\" See also *Mark Twain bibliography FootnotesSources *Ward, Geoffrey C., Duncan, Dayton, and Burns, Ken, (2001). Mark Twain: An Illustrated Biography.

In a typical compiler, instruction selection precedes both instruction scheduling and register allocation; hence its output IR has an infinite set of pseudo-registers (often known as temporaries) and may still be ‚Äì and typically is ‚Äì subject to peephole optimization. Otherwise, it closely resembles the target machine code, bytecode, or assembly language. For example, for the following sequence of middle-level IR code t1 = a t2 = b t3 = t1 + t2 a = t3 b = t1 a good instruction sequence for the x86 architecture is MOV EAX, a XCHG EAX, b ADD a, EAX For a comprehensive survey on instruction selection, see.  Macro expansion  The simplest approach to instruction selection is known as macro expansion or interpretative code generation. A macro-expanding instruction selector operates by matching templates over the middle-level IR. Upon a match the corresponding macro is executed, using the matched portion of the IR as input, which emits the appropriate target instructions. Macro expansion can be done either directly on the textual representation of the middle-level IR, or the IR can first be transformed into a graphical representation which is then traversed depth-first. In the latter, a template matches one or more adjacent nodes in the graph. Unless the target machine is very simple, macro expansion in isolation typically generates inefficient code. To mitigate this limitation, compilers that apply this approach typically combine it with peephole optimization to replace combinations of simple instructions with more complex equivalents that increase performance and reduce code size. This is known as the Davidson-Fraser approach and is currently applied in GCC.  Graph covering  Another approach is to first transform the middle-level IR into a graphical representation and then cover the graph using patterns. A pattern is a template that matches a portion of the graph and can be implemented with a single instruction provided by the target machine. The goal is to cover the graph such that the total cost of the selected patterns is minimized, where the cost typically represents the number of cycles it takes to execute the instruction. For tree-shaped graphs, the least-cost cover can be found in linear time using dynamic programming, but for DAGs and full-fledged graphs the problem becomes NP-complete and thus is most often solved using either greedy algorithms or methods from combinatorial optimization.  Lowest common denominator strategy The lowest common denominator strategy is an instruction selection technique used on platforms where processor-supplementary instructions exist to make executable programs portable across a wide range of computers. Under a lowest common denominator strategy, the default behaviour of the compiler is to build for the lowest common architecture. Use of any available processor extension is switched off by default, unless explicitly switched on by command line switches. The use of a lowest common denominator strategy means that processor-supplementary instructions and capabilities are not used by default.

He was a successful silk merchant in Essex, England, but he emigrated to the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1632 and quickly assumed a number of roles in the colonial government. In the mid-1630s, he became a supporter of dissident minister John Wheelwright and of Anne Hutchinson. Hutchinson was tried as a heretic in 1637, and Coggeshall was one of three deputies who voted for her acquittal. She was banished from the colony in 1638, and the three deputies who voted for her acquittal were also compelled to leave. Before leaving Boston, Coggeshall and many other Hutchinson supporters signed the Portsmouth Compact in March 1638 agreeing to form a government based on the individual consent of the inhabitants. They then established the settlement of Portsmouth on Aquidneck Island (called Rhode Island at the time), one of the four towns comprising the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations. Coggeshall was very active in civil affairs, but a rift in the leadership of the colony caused him and several other leaders to leave in 1639, moving to the south end of the island and establishing the town of Newport. The towns of Portsmouth and Newport reunited in 1640 under the leadership of William Coddington, and Coggeshall was his assistant until 1647 when the two towns on Rhode Island united to form a common government with the towns of Providence and Warwick, and Coggeshall was elected President of the entire Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations. His tenure was very short due to his death later the same year, but during his administration many laws were established which became the basis for the colony and the future State of Rhode Island.  England and Massachusetts  John Coggeshall was the son of John and Ann (Butter) Coggeshall. He was born and raised in northeastern Essex, England and baptized at Halstead. After his marriage, he lived four miles (six km) away in Castle Hedingham where several of his children were baptized, and where he was a merchant prior to his emigration. In 1632, Coggeshall and his family joined the mass migration of English Puritans to New England, sailing on the Lyon, the same ship that carried Roger Williams the year before. The Coggeshalls first settled at Roxbury where they were admitted to the Roxbury Church the year of their arrival, and where John Eliot became the pastor. In 1634, Coggeshall moved with his family to Boston where he and his wife were admitted to the church on 20 August, and where they became the nextdoor neighbors of William and Anne Hutchinson. Portsmouth Compact with Coggeshall's signature fourth on the list Coggeshall was a mercer in the silk trade, and he held many offices in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. He was a deputy to the General Court for Boston from 1634 to 1637 and a Boston selectman during the same period. In 1634, he was also on a committee to survey Mount Wollaston, and also on a committee to oversee ammunition. Sometime after moving to Boston, Coggeshall became an enthusiastic supporter of Anne Hutchinson, who was at the center of the growing Antinomian Controversy. Also supporting her initially were the Reverend John Cotton and many of the Boston church members. Even the colony's Governor Henry Vane was a strong admirer, but he was voted out of office and John Winthrop became the governor. At that point, strong measures were taken to \\"stamp out heresy and drive out the heretics,\\" in the words of one modern historian. Anne Hutchinson was tried, convicted, and banished from the colony because of her religious opinions, her prophecies of God's wrath and destruction upon the colony, and her influence in fanning the flames of controversy within the community. At her civil trial, Coggeshall spoke out in her defense and was one of only three deputies to vote for her acquittal, the other two being William Aspinwall and William Coddington.Battis claims that \\"Coddington and Colburn alone dissented.\\" (Saints and Sectaries (1962), page 208) Coggeshall also supported dissident minister Reverend John Wheelwright, whose wife was the sister of Anne Hutchinson's husband. Shortly after Hutchinson's banishment, Coggeshall was expelled from the General Court and was also directed to leave Massachusetts in March 1638. Many of Hutchinson's supporters were ordered out of the Massachusetts colony, but a group of them (including Coggeshall) signed what is called the Portsmouth Compact before leaving Boston, thus establishing a non-sectarian civil government with a Christian focus, upon the universal consent of the inhabitants. The group initially planned to settle in New Netherland, but they were persuaded by Roger Williams to purchase some land from the Indians on Narragansett Bay. They moved to the northeast end of Rhode Island and established the settlement of Pocasset, changing the name to Portsmouth in 1639. William Coddington was elected the first judge (governor) of the settlement. In May 1638, Coggeshall was on a committee to lay out land there, and he was granted six acres at the same time. The following year, a disagreement prompted Coddington and a few other leaders, including Coggeshall, to leave Portsmouth and begin a new settlement called Newport at the south end of the island. Governor Winthrop described the 1639 disagreement in Portsmouth in his journal: \\"the people grew very tumultuous and put out Mr. Coddington and the other three magistrates.\\" Coggeshall was one of the three referred to by Winthrop.  Rhode Island  Coggeshall's land was located near present-day Bellevue Avenue in Newport Coggeshall was soon a leader in Newport and was granted of land on the south side of the town, along Bellevue Avenue. In the first election in 1638, he was elected as treasurer, and he became an assistant to the governor in 1640, which position he held continuously until 1647. He had a good working relationship with Roger Williams which helped the towns of Portsmouth, Newport, Providence, and Warwick to unite and form the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations in the Spring of 1647, under the patent that Williams had obtained from the crown in 1644. In May 1647, Coggeshall was elected the chief magistrate of the four-town colony with the title of President. He had an assistant from each town, a general recorder, and a treasurer. Under his administration, the courts of justice were established and the first complete code of laws was written. Rhode Island historian and Lieutenant Governor Samuel G. Arnold made this tribute to the digest of statutes enacted under Coggeshall in 1647: Coggeshall was in office only briefly, dying of an illness in Newport on 27 November 1647 and being buried on his own property there. He is noted for being the first president of the united Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations. He is also noted for helping to establish the three towns of Boston, Portsmouth, and Newport, and the two colonies of Massachusetts Bay and Rhode Island. Family and legacy Coggeshall's wife was named Mary, but her maiden name remains uncertain. Some sources claim that her maiden name was Gould, another says that it was Surgis, but these are undocumented. Coggeshall and his wife had eight children, five of whom were born in England and the others in Boston, but only half of whom are known to have survived to maturity. Their oldest child John was very active in colonial affairs over a period of three decades, serving as treasurer, commissioner, assistant, and deputy governor. Their son Joshua also served in public office as deputy to the General Court of Rhode Island for all but two years between 1664 and 1672, and as assistant (magistrate) for all but one year from 1669 to 1676. Their oldest daughter Ann married Peter Easton, a son of Nicholas Easton who served many terms as either president or governor of the Rhode Island colony. Their daughter Wayte married Daniel Gould; descendant Elizabeth Buffum Chace was an abolitionist with the Underground Railroad. Places named for President Coggeshall include John Coggeshall Elementary School in Portsmouth, Rhode Island; Coggeshall Way and Coggeshall Circle in rural Middletown; and Coggeshall Avenue in Newport, which goes through the original Coggeshall property.

They provide equipment, materials and services for the manufacture of semiconductors, photovoltaic panels, LED and flat panel displays, micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS), printed and flexible electronics, and related micro and nano-technologies. SEMI is headquartered in Milpitas, California, and has offices in Bangalore; Berlin; Grenoble, France; Hsinchu, Taiwan; Seoul; Shanghai; Singapore; Tokyo; and Washington, D.C. Its main activities include conferences and trade shows, development of industry standards, market research reporting, and industry advocacy. The president and chief executive officer of the organization is Ajit Manocha.  Global advocacy  SEMI Global Advocacy represents the interests of the semiconductor industry‚Äôs design, manufacturing and supply chain businesses worldwide. SEMI promotes its positions on public issues via press releases, position papers, presentations, social media, web content, and media interviews. SEMI Global Advocacy focuses on five priorities: taxes, trade, technology, talent, and environment, health and safety (EHS).  Workforce development  SEMI Workforce Development attracts, and develops talent that can fulfill the requirements of the electronics industry. SEMI programs include: * SEMI Works. Begun in 2019, SEMI Works develops a standardized process that identifies technical competencies and certifies relevant college coursework. The program is designed to improve the job hiring process for both applicants and employers. * Diversity and Inclusion Council. This council communicates best practices and benefits arising from diverse and inclusive cultures, using white papers, services, webinars, workshops, presentations and events. SEMI standards The SEMI Standards program was established in 1973 using proceeds from the west coast SEMICON show. Its first initiative, following meetings with silicon suppliers, was a successful effort to set common wafer diameters to be used in silicon manufacturing. This standardization helped the industry avoid a wafer shortage from 1973 to 1974, that had previously been anticipated. The standards would become internationally utilized over the years, through partnerships with the ASTM, the DIN, and other national standards organizations. Before these standards, there were more than two thousand different specifications for silicon and by 1975 80% of all silicon wafers met with the SEMI standard. It was first published annually as the Book of SEMI Standards. With three new standards published annually in the mid-2000s, the book was eventually replaced with a CD-ROM, and now standards are available online on an annual subscription basis. Today, more than 1,000 SEMI standards and safety guidelines are available to address all aspects of automated fabs. The standards are developed and maintained by over 5,000 volunteer experts representing more than 2,000 companies, working in 23 technical committees and 200 task forces. High-profile standards include wafer dimensions and materials, factory efficiency and reliability, equipment interfaces, and environmental, health and safety standards. The four main equipment communication standards are the SECS-I (which stands for SEMI Equipment Communication Standards) established in 1978 that deals with communication protocol and physical definitions, the SECS-II established in 1982 that deals with message format, the GEM established in 1992 that refines the SECS-II, and the HSMS that supersedes SECS-I established in 1994. The organization also provides safety and ergonomics guidelines, the first of which was the SEMI S2 developed in 1993, followed by the SEMI S8 in 1995. Conferences and trade shows SEMI was founded in 1970 as an association of semiconductor production equipment vendors. At that time, most companies in the semiconductor industry exhibited at the Wescon Show on the west coast and the IEEE show on the east coast. Wishing to organize a show dedicated to semiconductor production equipment, 55 companies met in Palo Alto and agreed to found a new association, originally called Semiconductor Equipment and Materials Institute. The first SEMICON show was held in 1971 at the San Mateo Fairground in California, which featured ‚Äúsemiconductor processing equipment, materials, and service firms.‚Äù It featured 80 exhibitors and attracted 2,800 visitors. In 1973, the first SEMICON East show was held in New York City, with 120 exhibitors participating. This was followed by SEMICON Europa in Zurich, Switzerland (1975) and SEMICON Japan in Tokyo (1977), which attracted more than 200 exhibitors and 4,500 visitors. Through this and other activities, the organization grew from a domestic organization to one with an international focus. Part of this focus was to work with governments to reduce trade barriers and develop ‚Äúa sympathetic regulatory climate‚Äù for its member organizations‚Äîcompanies that sold equipment and materials to firms that produce microprocessors. Today SEMI organizes and produces nearly 100 technology showcases, trade shows, conferences and special events per year in all of the major manufacturing regions of the world. They include trade shows in China, Japan, Germany, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, North America, and Europe, as well as executive conferences, technical programs, and standards meetings. The organization also has technical education programs, and a weekly email newsletter. Presentations delivered at its symposia are available to members of the organization on the Members Only section of the website. Market research reports SEMI provides market research reports for the semiconductor equipment, materials, and LED industries. Its billing data is considered an important leading indicator of demand trends and is closely watched within the industry and by semiconductor market analysts and investor. It also releases the World Fab Forecast. The semiconductor equipment billings report provides a three-month rolling average of the book-to-bill ratio for semiconductor equipment manufacturers with headquarters in North America. It is released approximately three weeks after the close of each month. Data for the reports is collected directly from suppliers through a confidential data collection program via an independent financial services company. There are data collection programs in the following areas. * Equipment market * Packaging market * Materials market * Semiconductor Fabrication foundries and capacity In-depth reports are broken down by region, supply chain segment, and equipment type.  Smart initiatives  SEMI Smart Initiatives build activities around promising electronics markets emerging from mass digitalization in the Fourth Industrial Era. The initiatives synchronize advances around semiconductors, electronics and imaging systems, the Internet of Things, MEMS, sensors, devices, displays, and other digital technologies used in the electronics industry. SEMI Smart Initiatives include: * Smart Mobility. This initiative is focused primarily on the automotive and autonomous vehicle supply chain. In 2018, SEMI formed the Global Automotive Advisory Council, composed of five regional chapters (Europe, United States, Japan, Taiwan, China), which engages stakeholders to address common challenges, priorities, solutions, and opportunities. GAAC members include Audi, BMW, Ford, and Volkswagen. * Smart MedTech. For example, SEMI‚Äôs Nano-Bio Materials Consortium (NVMC) brings critical information and project funding to the electronics industry; the SEMI-FlexTech partnership focuses on the rise of flexible, printed and hybrid electronics to better fit the contours and movement of the human form, in part for healthcare applications. * Smart Manufacturing.
