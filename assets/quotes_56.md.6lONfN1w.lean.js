A series of Chinese ceramics dated from 8th to 13th century AD was uncovered at the archeological site of Santubong. The coastal regions of Sarawak came under the influence of the Bruneian Empire in the 16th century. In 1839, James Brooke, a British explorer, first arrived in Sarawak. Sarawak was later governed by the Brooke family between 1841 and 1946. During World War II, it was occupied by the Japanese for three years. After the war, the last White Rajah, Charles Vyner Brooke, ceded Sarawak to Britain, and in 1946 it became a British Crown Colony. On 22 July 1963, Sarawak was granted self-government by the British. Following this, it became one of the founding members of the Federation of Malaysia, established on 16 September 1963. However, the federation was opposed by Indonesia, and this led to the three-year Indonesia‚ÄìMalaysia confrontation. From 1960 to 1990, Sarawak experienced a communist insurgency.  Prehistory  The main entrance to the Niah Caves The first foragers visited the West Mouth of Niah Caves (located southwest of Miri) 65,000 years ago instead of previously believed 40,000 years ago when Borneo was connected to the mainland of Southeast Asia.https://www.theborneopost.com/2018/10/22/new-pre-history-timeline- discovered-for-borneo/ The landscape around the Niah Caves was drier and more exposed than it is now. Prehistorically, the Niah Caves were surrounded by a combination of closed forests with bush, parkland, swamps, and rivers. The foragers were able to survive in the rainforest through hunting, fishing, and gathering molluscs and edible plants. This new timeline of 65,000 years was concluded when five pieces of microlithic tools that were aged 65,000 years old and a human skull that was aged 55,000 years old were discovered at part of the Niah Saves complex, Trader cave, during excavation work.The new timeline of 65,000 years was concluded when five pieces of microlithic tools that were aged 65,000 years old and a human skull that was aged 55,000 years old were discovered at part of the Niah Saves complex, Trader cave, during excavation work. An earlier evidence is the discovery of a modern human skull, nicknamed \\"Deep Skull\\", in a deep trench uncovered by Barbara and Tom Harrisson (a British ethnologist) in 1958; this is also the oldest modern human skull in Southeast Asia. The Deep Skull probably belongs to a 16-to 17-year-old adolescent girl. When compared with the Iban skull and other fossils, the Deep Skull most closely resembles the indigenous people of Borneo today, with their delicate features and small body size and it has few similarities with the skull of the indigenous Australians.https://theconversation.com/ancient-deep-skull-still-holds-big- surprises-60-years-after-it-was-unearthed-61572 Mesolithic and Neolithic burial sites have also been found. The area around the Niah Caves has been designated the Niah National Park. Another earlier excavation by Tom Harrisson in 1949 unearthed a series of Chinese ceramics at Santubong (near Kuching) that date to the Tang and the Song dynasties in the 8th to 13th century AD. It is possible that Santubong was an important seaport in Sarawak during the period, but its importance declined during the Yuan dynasty, and the port was deserted during the Ming dynasty. Other archaeological sites in Sarawak can be found inside the Kapit, Song, Serian, and Bau districts. Old Kingdoms The following areas were the sites of old kingdoms in the northwestern area of the Borneo Island:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMeaLsDOT6I&fbclid;=IwAR2PL64pKkAf4RN68kGPWTndxHrzqZtoUvaoCRzOt50R139D5hvxKKnrFz0 * Niah: c65000 - 9000 BC * Sarawak, aka Cerava: started c2000 BC - * Santubong: started c500 AD * Dusun: c520 - 1356 AD * Melano: c700 -1400 AD * Samarahan: started c1300 AD * Sadong aka Sadu: started c1300 AD * Kalaka aka Kalka: started c1300 AD * Saribas: started c1300 AD * Brunei: c1356 AD The Austronesian ancestors migrated from Borneo to Champa to build old kingdoms there, perhaps to control the trade sea route between the northwestern coast of Borneo and the southern coast of Southeast Asia. The sea was known as the Champa Sea before it was known as the South China Sea. =Santubong Kingdom= The Santubong kingdom started since circa 500 AD.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMeaLsDOT6I&t;=210s It was later subjected to Srivijaya and Majapahit Empires. James Brooke found \\"Nandi dan Yoni\\" in 1857 and later gold artifacts.Tom Harrisson, \\"Gold and Indian Influences in West Borneo\\", JMBRAS, XXII, Pt. 4, 1949, hal. 34. Sarawak Museum under Tom Harrisson in 1949 collected thousands of ceramic pieces at Santubong which indicates Santubong existed as a settlement between 7th until 10th or 14th centuries. Iron-slag about 40,000 tonnes was found at Santubong which shows it was a major and vital fort-city. The iron industry existed between 900s to 1350s. Even O.W. Wolters confirms China has known this iron slag since the 13th century and interpreted that Pulau Tan-lan mentioned in the Chinese report as located in the western of Sarawak which locally known as Pulau Talang-Talang.O.W. Wolters, The Fall of Srivijaya in Malay History, OUP, London, hal. 35, nk. 3. However, archaeologists or Sarawak Museum never associates Pulau Talang-Talang with the discovery of the iron slag although its distance is not far from Santubong. At Bongkissam, thousands of ceramic pieces were found and dated to exist up to the 14th century by Sarawak Muzeum. The Chinese manuscript of Nan-hai-chih written in 1304 listed the kingdoms in Borneo known as Tung-yang Fo-ni which indicates it controls the entire north Borneo. The Negarakartagama manuscript of Java written in 1365 shows that Bo- ni was under Majapahit whose expansion up to 1350 diverted trade with China from Santubong to Malano and consequently, no ceramics from the Ming dynasty were found at Santubong. Malano was the most important polity in Tanjungpura at this point in time, according to Negarakartagama: \\"14 Polities: Kandandangan, Landa, Samadong dan Tirem not forgetting Sedu, Barune (ng), Kalka, Saludong, Solot and also Pasir, Barito, Sawaku, Tabalung, followed by Tanjung Kutei [but] Malano being the most important in Tanjungpura Island\\".Slamet Muljana, Tafsir Sejarah: Nagarakertagama, LKIS, Jakarta, Indonesia, 2006, hal. 346. Christie contended that Po-ni was Santubong which was locally known as Muara Punik.Jan Wisseman Christie, \\"On Po-ni: The Santubong Sites of Sarawak\\", SMJ, XXXIV, 1985, p. 82. Santubong's name was lost from history until a new name, Sawaku (very near to Sarawak) in Negarakartagama. The presence of Majapahit caused the local population to migrate to uplands like Lidah Tanah, Samarahan and Sadong. The first version of the origin of the Santubong kingdom is according to the narration and genealogy provided by the present descendent of the \\"Tungkat Kerabat\\" of the Santubong kingdom.https://www.academia.edu/37314768/History_of_the_people_from_the_Sarawak_River_Valley The kingdom started at Santubong and expanded to cover the whole northwest of Borneo. It was established by Indrana Jang Sorgi (Hyang Gi) who became the first ruler of the area. He was from Tanjong Pura. His grandfather's name was Indrana Manika, the first ruler of Tanjong Pura. When Indrana Manika died, he was replaced by his son Indrana Sapan who became the second ruler of Tanjong Pura. Indrana Sapan had two sons, Indrana Jang Talar and Indrana Jang Sorgi. Talar was also known as Hyang Ta while Sorgi as Hyang Gi. The message from the grandfather, Indrana Manika, stated he wanted one of his grandsons to rule Tanjong Pura after their father's death. In intrigue before the appointment of Hyang Gi, Indrana Jang Talar (Hyang Ta) was made the ruler of Tanjong Pura. This made Indrana Jang Sorgi (Hyang Gi) unhappy with the decision. He requested that Talar give the throne to him after Talar ruled Tanjong Pura for ~ ten years. To avoid a dispute among those within the palace, Talar gave Indra Jang Sorgi (Hyang Gi) the area of Mora Ponek (Santubong) to rule. Hyang Gi agreed with the arrangement. He built his kingdom at Mora Ponek. He changed the name, Mora Ponek to Indra Ponek (Muara Tebas now). The rest is history as they say.

The first time was when Awang Balitar assassinated Abdullah Muhammad in 1512 and he was exterminated as a consequence. The Brunei troop attacked and conquered Santubong on 15 August 1512, following the fall of Malacca to Portuguese in 1511. The second time was when Pangeran Muda Tengah from 1599-1641 aka Sultan Ibrahim Ali Omar Shah established a fort at Bukit Bedil at the foot of Mount Santubong in 1599. The third time was when Pengiran Kasuma Yuda Pengiran Sharifuddin (died 1832) migrated to Sadong. He was the father of Pengiran Indera Mahkota Muhamad Salleh who became the Sultan Brunei's representative to the Sarawak proper (now Kuching) in 1826 and relocated his court to a place called Serwak to try and control the antimony trade in favour of the Brunei Sultan. Earlier in 1780, he attacked Lidah Tanah which flourished after the fall of Santubong in 1512. There is a mausoleum of Pengiran Anak Sabtu at Muara Tuang to this day. The fourth time was in 1834 when Raja Muda Hashim arrived at Sarawak with his 13 brothers (Walker 2002 p. 26). They established a settlement at the present Astana. James Brooke arrived at Sarawak from Singapore in 1838 and became the first White Rajah of Sarawak in 1841. =Malano Kingdom= The Melano kingdom existed circa 700 to 1400 AD. It is stated that Tanjung Sirek (today - Bruit) as a fortness for the Kingdom around Rajang, Paloh and Mato around 700 AD. Rajah Tugau is the most renowned King. His kingdom is groups of similar Melanau and Kajang languages speakers covered Sarawak coastal until Belait. They also share almost identical culture and heritage. According to the manuscript of Brunei's rulers, following the fall of Majapahit, Barunai led by Awang Semaun being reinforced by the Iban, conquered Tutong under its chief Mawanga and the whole of the Melano kingdom until Igan under its chief Basiung despite the reinforcement from Sambas. Barunai continued the conquest to the entire south and then north of Borneo Island, after which conquering the whole Sulu and Philippines.http://learnmelanau.nativeglot.com/2012/10/the-fall-of- melanau-kingdom-and.html Nagarakertagama written in 1365 during Hayam Wuruk mentions Malano and Barune(ng) among the 14 tributaries of Majapahit. After the fall of Majapahit, Barune(ng) expanded its territory along the northern coast of Borneo island. Catalan Atlas published in 1375 shows the map of the Malano kingdom in it. This was confirmed by a Portugues map which shows the existence of a polity called Malano. At Florence, Italy an old map dated 1595 wrote that the Sarawak coastal areas as districts of Oya, Balingian dan Mukah which was marked as Malano. In the Nan-hai-chih of China mentioned Achen atau Igan.  Bruneian Empire  A view of a river from the anchorage off Sarawak, Borneo, . Painting from the National Maritime Museum of London. During the 16th century, the Kuching area was known to Portuguese cartographers as Cerava, one of the five great seaports on the island of Borneo. During its golden age, Brunei under Nahkhod Raga Sultan Bolkiah (1473-1521 AD) managed to conquer the Santubong Kingdom in 1512. For a short period of time, it was self-governed under the Sultan of Brunei's younger brother, Sultan Tengah in 1599. The new Sultan's younger brother, Pengiran Muda Tengah, also wanted to become Sultan of Brunei by claiming himself rightful successor on the basis of having been born when his father became the Crown Prince. Sultan Abdul Jalilul Akbar responded by proclaiming Pengiran Muda Tengah as Sultan of Sarawak, as at that time Sarawak was a territory administered by Brunei. Sultan Tengah was killed at Batu Buaya in 1641 by one of his followers. He was buried in Kampong Batu Buaya. With his death, the Sultanate of Sarawak came to an end and later consolidated into Brunei once more. By the early 19th century, Sarawak had become a loosely governed territory under the control of the Brunei Sultanate. The Bruneian Empire had authority only along the coastal regions of Sarawak held by semi-independent Malay leaders. Meanwhile, the interior of Sarawak suffered from tribal wars fought by Iban, Kayan, and Kenyah peoples, who aggressively fought to expand their territories. Following the discovery of antimony ore in the Kuching region, Pangeran Indera Mahkota (a representative of the Sultan of Brunei) began to develop the territory between 1824 and 1830. When antimony production increased, the Brunei Sultanate demanded higher taxes from Sarawak; this led to civil unrest and chaos. In 1839, Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddin II (1827‚Äì1852), ordered his uncle Pangeran Muda Hashim to restore order. Pangeran Muda Hashim requested the assistance of British sailor James Brooke in the matter, but Brooke refused. However, in 1841 during his next visit to Sarawak in 1841 he agreed to a repeated request. Pangeran Muda Hashim signed a treaty in 1841 surrendering Sarawak to Brooke. On 24 September 1841, Pangeran Muda Hashim bestowed the title of governor on James Brooke. This appointment was later confirmed by the Sultan of Brunei in 1842. In 1843, James Brooke decided to create a pro-British Brunei government by installing Pangeran Muda Hashim into the Brunei Court as he would take Brooke's advice, forcing Brunei to appoint Hashim under the guns of East India Company's steamer Phlegethon. The Brunei Court was unhappy with Hashim's appointment and had him assassinated in 1845. In retaliation, James Brooke attacked Kampong Ayer, the capital of Brunei. After the incident, the Sultan of Brunei sent an apology letter to Queen Victoria. The sultan also confirmed James Brooke's possession of Sarawak and his mining rights of antimony without paying tribute to Brunei. In 1846 Brooke effectively became the Rajah of Sarawak and founded the White Rajah Dynasty of Sarawak.  Brooke dynasty  James Brooke, the first Rajah of Sarawak James Brooke ruled the area and expanded the territory northwards until his death in 1868. He was succeeded by his nephew Charles Anthoni Johnson Brooke, who in turn was succeeded by his son, Charles Vyner Brooke, on the condition that Charles Anthoni should rule in consultation with Vyner Brooke's brother Bertram Brooke. Both James and Charles Anthoni Johnson Brooke pressured Brunei to sign treaties as a strategy to acquire territories from Brunei and expand the territorial boundaries of Sarawak. In 1861, Brunei ceded the Bintulu region to James Brooke. Sarawak was recognised as an independent state by the United States in 1850 and the United Kingdom in 1864. The state issued its first currency as the Sarawak dollar in 1858. In 1883 Sarawak was extended to the Baram River (near Miri). Limbang was added to Sarawak in 1890. The final expansion of Sarawak occurred in 1905 when Lawas was ceded to the Brooke government. Sarawak was divided into five divisions, corresponding to territorial boundaries of the areas acquired by the Brookes through the years. Each division was headed by a Resident. The barque of Rajah of Sarawak, . Sarawak became a British protectorate in 1888, while still ruled by the Brooke dynasty. The Brookes ruled Sarawak for a hundred years as \\"White Rajahs\\". The Brookes adopted a policy of paternalism to protect the interests of the indigenous population and their overall welfare. While the Brooke government established a Supreme Council consisting of Malay chiefs who advised the Rajahs on all aspects of governance, in the Malaysian context the Brooke family is viewed as a colonialist. The Supreme Council is the oldest state legislative assembly in Malaysia, with the first General Council meeting taking place at Bintulu in 1867. Meanwhile, the Ibans and other Dayak people were hired as militia. The Brooke dynasty encouraged the immigration of Chinese merchants for economic development, especially in the mining and agricultural sectors. Western capitalists were restricted from entering the state while Christian missionaries were tolerated. Piracy, slavery, and headhunting were banned. Borneo Company Limited was formed in 1856. It was involved in a wide range of businesses in Sarawak such as trade, banking, agriculture, mineral exploration, and development. revenue stamp of Sarawak featuring the picture of Charles Brooke In 1857, 500 Hakka Chinese gold miners from Bau, under the leadership of Liu Shan Bang, destroyed the Brooke's house. Brooke escaped and organised a bigger army together with his nephew Charles and his Malayo-Iban supporters. A few days later, Brooke's army was able to cut off the escape route of the Chinese rebels, who were annihilated after two months of fighting. The Brookes subsequently built a new government house by the Sarawak River at Kuching. An anti-Brooke faction at the Brunei Court was defeated in 1860 at Mukah. Other notable rebellions that were successfully quashed by the Brookes include those led by an Iban leader Rentap (18531863), and a Malay leader named Syarif Masahor (18601862). As a result, a series of forts were built around Kuching to consolidate the Rajah's power. These include Fort Margherita, which was completed in 1879. In 1891 Charles Anthoni Brooke established the Sarawak Museum, the oldest museum in Borneo. In 1899, Charles Anthoni Brooke ended the intertribal wars in Marudi. The first oil well was drilled in 1910. Two years later, the Brooke Dockyard opened. Anthony Brooke was born in the same year and became Rajah Muda in 1939. In 1941, during the centenary celebration of Brooke rule in Sarawak, a new constitution was introduced to limit the power of the Rajah and to allow the Sarawak people to play a greater role in the functioning of the government. However, the draft included a secret agreement drawn up between Charles Vyner Brooke and British government officials, in which Vyner Brooke ceded Sarawak as a British Crown Colony in return for a financial compensation to him and his family.  Japanese occupation and Allied liberation  Batu Lintang POW camp; photo taken on or after 29 August 1945. The Brooke government, under the leadership of Charles Vyner Brooke, established several airstrips in Kuching, Oya, Mukah, Bintulu, and Miri for preparations in the event of war. By 1941, the British had withdrawn its defending forces from Sarawak to Singapore. With Sarawak now unguarded, the Brooke regime decided to adopt a scorched earth policy where oil installations in Miri would be destroyed and the Kuching airfield will be held as long as possible before being destroyed. Meanwhile, Japanese forces seized British Borneo to guard their eastern flank in the Malayan Campaign and to facilitate their invasion of Sumatra and West Java. A Japanese invasion force led by Kiyotake Kawaguchi landed in Miri on 16 December 1941 (eight days into the Malayan Campaign) and conquered Kuching on 24 December 1941. British forces led by Lieutenant Colonel C.M. Lane retreated to Singkawang in Dutch Borneo bordering Sarawak. After ten weeks of fighting in Dutch Borneo, the Allied forces surrendered on 1 April 1942. When the Japanese invaded Sarawak, Charles Vyner Brooke had already left for Sydney, Australia while his officers were captured by the Japanese and interned at the Batu Lintang camp. The official surrender ceremony of the Japanese to the Australian forces at Kuching on 11 September 1945. Sarawak remained part of the Empire of Japan for three years and eight months. Sarawak, together with North Borneo and Brunei, formed a single administrative unit named Kita Boruneo (Northern Borneo) under the Japanese 37th Army headquartered in Kuching. Sarawak was divided into three provinces, namely: Kuching-shu, Sibu- shu, and Miri-shu, each under their respective Japanese Provincial Governor. The Japanese retained pre-war administrative machinery and assigned Japanese for government positions. The administration of Sarawak's interior was left to the native police and village headmen, under Japanese supervision. Though the Malays were typically receptive toward the Japanese, other indigenous tribes such as the Iban, Kayan, Kenyah, Kelabit and Lun Bawang maintained a hostile attitude toward them because of policies such as compulsory labour, forced deliveries of foodstuffs, and confiscation of firearms. The Japanese did not resort to strong measures in clamping down on the Chinese population because the Chinese in the state were generally apolitical. However, a considerable number of Chinese moved from urban areas into the less accessible interior to lessen contact with the Japanese. Allied forces later formed the Z Special Unit to sabotage Japanese operations in Southeast Asia. Beginning in March 1945, Allied commanders were parachuted into Borneo jungles and established several bases in Sarawak under an operation codenamed \\"Semut\\". Hundreds of indigenous people were trained to launch offensives against the Japanese. During the battle of North Borneo, the Australian forces landed at Lutong-Miri area on 20 June 1945 and had penetrated as far as Marudi and Limbang before halting their operations in Sarawak. After the surrender of Japan, the Japanese surrendered to the Australian forces at Labuan on 10 September 1945. This was followed by the official surrender ceremony at Kuching aboard the Australian Corvette HMAS Kapunda on 11 September 1945. The Batu Lintang camp was liberated on the same day. Sarawak was immediately placed under British Military Administration until April 1946.  British crown colony  Anti- cession demonstration in Sarawak After the war, the Brooke government did not have enough resources to rebuild Sarawak. Charles Vyner Brooke was also not willing to hand over his power to his heir apparent, Anthony Brooke (his nephew, the only son of Bertram Brooke) because of serious differences between them.Morrison, 1993. There has been serious differences between Rajah and his brother and nephew (page 14) Furthermore, Vyner Brooke's wife, Sylvia Brett, tried to defame Anthony Brooke in order to install her daughter to the throne. Faced with these problems, Vyner Brooke decided to cede sovereignty of Sarawak to the British Crown. A Cession Bill was put forth in the Council Negri (now Sarawak State Legislative Assembly) and was debated for three days. The bill was passed on 17 May 1946 with a narrow majority (19 versus 16 votes). Supporters of the bill were mostly European officers, while the Malays opposed the bill. This caused hundreds of Malay civil servants to resign in protest, sparking an anti-cession movement and the assassination of the second colonial governor of Sarawak Sir Duncan Stewart by Rosli Dhobi. Anthony Brooke opposed the cession of Sarawak to the British Crown, and was linked to anti-cessionist groups in Sarawak, especially after the assassination of Sir Duncan Stewart. Anthony Brooke continued to claim sovereignty as Rajah of Sarawak even after Sarawak became a British Crown colony on 1 July 1946. For this he was banished from Sarawak by the colonial governmentOoi, 2013. This denial of entry to Anthony ... (page 93) ... The anti-cession movement was by the early 1950s effectively \\"strangled\\" a dead letter.(page 98) and was allowed to return only 17 years later for a nostalgic visit, when Sarawak became part of Malaysia. In 1950 all anti-cession movements in Sarawak ceased after a clamp-down by the colonial government. In 1951 Anthony relinquished all his claims to the Sarawak throne after he used up his last legal avenue at the Privy Council.  Self-government and the Federation of Malaysia  Tan Sri Datuk Amar Stephen Kalong Ningkan declaring the formation of the Federation of Malaysia on 16 September 1963 On 27 May 1961, Tunku Abdul Rahman, the prime minister of the Federation of Malaya, announced a plan to form a greater federation together with Singapore, Sarawak, Sabah and Brunei, to be called Malaysia. This plan caused the local leaders in Sarawak to be wary of Tunku's intentions in view of the great disparity in socioeconomic development between Malaya and the Borneo states. There was a general fear that without a strong political institution, the Borneo states would be subjected to Malaya's colonisation. Therefore, various political parties in Sarawak emerged to protect the interests of the communities they represented. On 17 January 1962, the Cobbold Commission was formed to gauge the support of Sarawak and Sabah for the proposed federation. Between February and April 1962, the commission met more than 4,000 people and received 2,200 memoranda from various groups. The commission reported divided support among the Borneo population. However, Tunku interpreted the figures as 80 percent support for the federation. Sarawak proposed an 18-point memorandum to safeguard its interests in the federation. In September 1962, Sarawak Council Negri (now Sarawak state legislative assembly) passed a resolution that supported the federation with a condition that the interests of the Sarawak people would not be compromised. On 23 October 1962, five political parties in Sarawak formed a united front that supported the formation of Malaysia. Sarawak was officially granted self- government on 22 July 1963, and formed the federation of Malaysia with Malaya, North Borneo, and Singapore on 16 September 1963. Sarawak Rangers leap from a Royal Australian Air Force Bell UH-1 Iroquois helicopter to guard the Malay‚ÄìThai border from potential guerrilla attacks in 1965. The Malaysian federation had drawn opposition from the Philippines, Indonesia, Brunei People's Party, and the Sarawak-based communist groups. The Philippines and Indonesia claimed that the British would be \\"neocolonising\\" the Borneo states through the federation. Meanwhile, A. M. Azahari, leader of the Brunei People's Party, instigated the Brunei Revolt in December 1962 to prevent Brunei from joining the Malaysian federation. Azahari seized Limbang and Bekenu before being defeated by British military forces sent from Singapore. Claiming that the Brunei revolt was solid evidence of opposition to the Malaysian federation, Indonesian President Sukarno ordered a military confrontation with Malaysia, sending armed volunteers and later military forces into Sarawak, which became a flashpoint during the Indonesia‚ÄìMalaysia confrontation between 1962 and 1966.United Nations Treaty Registered No. 8029, Manila Accord between Philippines, Federation of Malaya and Indonesia (31 July 1963) . Retrieved on 12 August 2011.United Nations Treaty Series No. 8809, Agreement relating to the implementation of the Manila Accord . Retrieved on 12 August 2011. The confrontation gained little support from Sarawakians except from the Sarawak communists. Thousands of communist members went into Kalimantan, Indonesian Borneo, and underwent training with the Communist Party of Indonesia. During the confrontation, around 10,000 to 150,000 British troops were stationed in Sarawak, together with Australian and New Zealand troops. When Suharto replaced Sukarno as the president of Indonesia, negotiations were restarted between Malaysia and Indonesia which led to the end of the confrontation on 11 August 1966. After the formation of the People's Republic of China in 1949, the ideology of Maoism started to influence Chinese schools in Sarawak. The first communist group in Sarawak was formed in 1951, with its origins in the Chung Hua Middle School (Kuching). The group was succeeded by the Sarawak Liberation League (SLL) in 1954. Its activities spread from schools to trade unions and farmers. They were mainly concentrated in the southern and central regions of Sarawak. Communist members successfully penetrated the Sarawak United Peoples' Party (SUPP). SLL tried to realise a communist state in Sarawak through constitutional means but during the confrontation period, it resorted to armed struggle against the government.The first Communist group to be formed in Sarawak ... (page 95) Weng Min Chyuan and Bong Kee Chok were the two notable leaders of the SLL. Following this, the Sarawak government relocated Chinese villagers into security-guarded settlements along the KuchingSerian road to prevent the communists from getting material support from the villagers. The North Kalimantan Communist Party (NKCP) (also known as Clandestine Communist Organisation (CCO) by government sources) was formally set up in 1970. In 1973, Bong surrendered to chief minister Abdul Rahman Ya'kub; this significantly reduced the strength of the communist party. However, Weng, who had directed the CCO from China since the mid-1960s, called for armed struggle against the government, which after 1974 continued in the Rajang Delta. In 1989 the Malayan Communist Party (MCP) signed a peace agreement with the government of Malaysia. This caused the NKCP to reopen negotiations with the Sarawak government, which led to a peace agreement on 17 October 1990. Peace was restored in Sarawak after the final group of 50 communist guerrillas laid down their arms.

Founded in 1976, two years after Flynt began publishing Hustler magazine, LFP was originally to serve as the parent company of this magazine. Hustler magazine In March 1972, Flynt created the Hustler Newsletter, a four-page, black-and-white publication of information about his Hustler Clubs. This item became so popular with his customers that by May 1972 he expanded the Hustler Newsletter to 16 pages and in August 1973, to 32 pages. As a result of the 1973 oil crisis the United States entered an economic recession; Hustler Club customers tightened their spending and Flynt had to find financing to pay his debts or go bankrupt. He decided to turn the Hustler Newsletter into a sexually-explicit national magazine. He paid the start-up costs of the new magazine using sales taxes collected in the clubs. In July 1974, the first issue of Hustler magazine was published. Although the first few issues went largely unnoticed, within a year it became highly lucrative and he was able to pay his tax debts.Larry Flynt and Kenneth Ross, An Unseemly Man: My Life As A Pornographer, Pundit And Social Outcast (1996) , page 88 and 95. The magazine struggled for the first year, partly because many distributors and wholesalers refused to handle it as its nude photos became increasingly graphic. It targeted working-class men and grew from a shaky start to a peak circulation of around 3 million (current circulation is below 500,000). In November 1974, Hustler showed the first \\"pink shots,\\" or photos of open vaginas.Larry Flynt and Kenneth Ross, An Unseemly Man: My Life As A Pornographer, Pundit And Social Outcast (1996) , page 91 Flynt had to fight to publish each issue as many people, including his distribution company, found the magazine too sexually explicit and threatened to have it removed from the market. Shortly thereafter, Flynt was approached by a paparazzo who had taken nude pictures of former First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis while she was sunbathing on vacation in 1971. He purchased them for $18,000 and published them in the August 1975 issue.Larry Flynt and Kenneth Ross, An Unseemly Man: My Life As A Pornographer, Pundit And Social Outcast (1996) , page 98-99. That issue attracted widespread attention, and one million copies were sold within a few days. Now a millionaire, he bought a $375,000 (1976 dollars) mansion. Other magazines After 1976, Larry Flynt Publications began publishing many pornographic magazine titles as well as mainstream ones. Other pornographic magazines included: * Hustler's Taboo, which specializes in fetishistic material, such as the depiction of sexual bondage and urolagnia. * Barely Legal, a primarily softcore magazine focusing on models between 18 and 23 * Hustler XXX, a more generic hardcore offering * Hustler Beaver Hunt, featuring amateurs and reader-submitted photos * Hustler's Leg World * Asian Fever, focusing on Asian models * Hustler's Chic Magazine, started in 1976 and aimed at a more upscale clientele than Hustler. * Hustler's Busty Beauties is a softcore magazine which specializes in photographs of women with extremely large breasts. When sales of men's magazines fell in the late 1990s, LFP expanded into production of adult videos through its Hustler Video subsidiary, and moved further into the mainstream publishing market. To accommodate this expansion, the company moved its headquarters to Wilshire Boulevard in Beverly Hills, California, where it remains to this day. It acquired Darkroom Photography (later known as Camera & Darkroom Photography) in 1988 and launched a series of special-interest magazines, such as PC Laptop Computers and Maternity Fashion & Beauty.Pederson, Jay. International Directory of Company Histories, Vol. 31. St. James Press, 2000. Rip magazine was a music magazine covering heavy metal music. It was the first non-pornographic publication produced by LFP, and was edited by Lonn Friend, who had previously edited Hustler and Chic. Writers included rock journalist Judy Wieder, Mick Wall, and Andy Secher. It published 14 bi-monthly issues of TurboPlay Magazine (June/July 1990 ‚Äì August/September 1992) dedicated to covering TurboGrafx-16 and TG-CD hardware and software. It was a spin-off publication of Video Games & Computer Entertainment (VG&CE;), a popular multi-platform gaming magazine of the late 1980s / early 1990s. Every issue of TurboPlay was 32 pages in length and a yearly subscription cost $9.95. L.F.P. published three bi-monthly issues of DUOWORLD magazine (July/August 1993 ‚Äì November/December 1993) before it was canceled. DuoWorld was very similar in format to TurboPlay, but with a focus on the newly released TurboDuo console (i.e. TurboMail and TurboNews became DuoMail and DuoNews, respectively). Tips & Tricks (later Tips & Tricks Codebook) is a video game magazine published by LFP. For most of its existence, the publication was devoted almost exclusively to strategies and codes for popular video games. It began as a spin-off from VideoGames magazine, which in itself morphed out of VideoGames & Computer Entertainment. VG&CE; and VideoGames, like Tips & Tricks, were published by LFP following the purchase of ANALOG Computing, ST-LOG and other computer magazines from publishers Michael DesChenes & Lee Pappas in the late 1980s. As the 21st century approached, magazine sales further declined. Together, the company's 31 periodicals had a monthly circulation of between 2.5 and 3 million. This was a far cry from the 1970s, when Hustler alone sold that many copies each month. Because of this LFP focused on turning its magazine and video titles such as Hustler, Barely Legal, Busty Beauties, Beaver Hunt, and Asian Fever into profitable websites. By 1998, estimates LFP was doing $135 million in annual sales with 51,112 periodicals published and 7,812 movies and or video tapes produced. Hustler Video Hustler Video is a pornographic film studio owned by LFP. In 2003 Hustler Video bought VCA Pictures, which maintains a separate brand identity within the LFP conglomerate. Hustler Video has produced several top-selling and award-winning films, such as Snoop Dogg's Doggystyle, Snoop Dogg's Hustlaz: Diary of a Pimp and Who's Nailin' Paylin?. In 2010 when AIDS Healthcare Foundation lodged a complaint against the Hustler Video group for not requiring the actors to wear condoms and thereby contributing to the spread of HIV, Michael H. Klein, the President of LFP responded by saying the company would not back down from shooting raw sex videos. Hustler Clubs The Hustler Club is a chain of strip clubs. In 1968, Flynt opened the first Hustler Club which featured semi-clothed girls. One Hustler Club in Dayton quickly lead to a chain of clubs with the same name in Cincinnati, Columbus, Cleveland, Toledo, and Akron. By early 1970, he had eight clubs and 300 employees. In 1974 with profits from Hustler magazine far surpassing those of the Hustler Clubs, Flynt decided to get out of the bars business and be a publisher full-time. For close to 30 years the Hustler Club name lay dormant. In the early 2000s (decade), LFP began to license the Hustler Club name for new clubs across the country. Currently there are Hustler Clubs in 6 U.S. states and 3 countries.

It was developed by Sir Bernard Spilsbury, a British forensic pathologist known for his work on the Hawley Harvey Crippen case in conjunction with Scotland Yard in 1924. The need for such a kit became apparent during the investigation into the Patrick Mahon murder case of 1924. The murder scene was particularly gruesome for the time period, as Mahon had carved his victim, Emily Kaye, into several pieces and attempted to burn them. After the burning had proved unsuccessful, Mahon boiled the body parts, and was later caught for throwing small pieces of the body out of a train. Spilsbury was called to the scene to aid in locating and identifying several missing pieces. When he arrived, Spilsbury discovered a detective using his bare hands to scoop up bloodied flesh and deposit them in a bucket. When questioned about why he was not wearing rubber gloves for the task, the officer replied that he never wore gloves, and that no one he knew had since the formation of the murder squad seventeen years ago. After returning to Scotland Yard, Spilsbury reported what he had discovered to the then head of the murder squad, Detective Superintendent William Brown, who proposed a standardised kit to be provided to officers in the field. The subsequently produced kit was carried by all detectives responding to a homicide, and contained rubber gloves, tweezers, evidence bags, magnifying glass, compass, ruler and swabs. The kit changed as needed to keep pace with changing advances in forensics.

Thorne. It occupies arid or semiarid areas in the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico and is bordered by the Rocky Mountain Region and North American Atlantic Region of the Holarctic Kingdom in the north and in the east, Caribbean Region of the Neotropical Kingdom in the south. The Madrean Region is characterized by a very distinct flora with at least three endemic families (Fouquieriaceae, Simmondsiaceae, and Setchellanthaceae). Crossosomataceae, Garryaceae, Lennoaceae, Limnanthaceae and Stegnospermataceae have their principal development here; for Onagraceae, Polemoniaceae and Hydrophyllaceae it is the major center of diversity. More than 250 genera and probably more than half of the species of the region are endemic to it according to Takhtajan. Floristic provinces The region is subdivided into four floristic provinces: *Great Basin Province *Californian Province *Sonoran Province *Mexican Highlands Province = Great Basin Province = The Great Basin Floristic Province includes most of the Great Basin, as well as the Colorado Plateau, the Snake River Plain, and Arizona north of the Mogollon Rim. It shares much of its flora with the neighboring provinces and has only a few endemic genera. Species endemism is also moderate (about 25%), but is much more considerable in such genera as Astragalus, Eriogonum, Penstemon, Cymopterus, Lomatium, Cryptantha, Chrysothamnus, Erigeron, Phacelia, Castilleja, and Gilia. The vegetation in the central Great Basin shrub steppe part of the province is dominated by Artemisia species and Chenopodiaceae genera. The Great Basin montane forests include ancient Great Basin bristlecone pine (Pinus longaeva) trees. = Californian Province = The Californian Province occupies Central and Southern California from the seashore to the foothills of the Cascade Range, the Sierra Nevada range, and northern parts of Baja California in Mexico. It possesses the most diverse flora within the floristic region. About half of the species are endemic. More than 50 genera (e.g. Adenostoma, Bergerocactus, Carpenteria, Cneoridium, Dendromecon, Fremontodendron, Jepsonia, Lyonothamnus, Neostapfia, Odontostomum, Ornithostaphylos, Pickeringia, Romneya) are endemic or near-endemic as well. Arctostaphylos, Brodiaeinae, Calochortus, Caulanthus, Streptanthus, Ceanothus, Cryptantha, Downingia, Dudleya, Eritrichieae, Eriogonoideae, Gileae, Hydrophyllaceae, Limnanthaceae, Lotus, Madiinae, Mimulus, Onagreae, Epilobieae, Orcuttieae, Eschscholzioideae, Platystemonoideae, Astragalus and Cupressus have a principal center of diversity within the province. The flora of the Californian Province is partially shared with the spatially distant Chile-Patagonian Region of the Antarctic Kingdom and to a lesser extent Mediterranean Region of the Holarctic Kingdom. The vegetation of the Californian Province is varied. Wetter northern parts of the Californian Province (Northern California and Oregon) as defined by Peter Raven and D.I. Axelrod, as well as by Conservation International, fall under the Rocky Mountain Region in Takhtajan and Thorne's system and don't make parts of the Madrean Region. = Sonoran Province = The Sonoran Province comprises arid areas in the southwestern U.S. and northwestern Mexico from California and Baja California to Texas and Tamaulipas, including the Mojave (characterized by Yucca brevifolia, Joshua Tree), Sonora and Chihuahua Deserts. The vegetation is dominated by Yucca, Cactaceae species (Opuntia spp. and other), as well as by Larrea tridentata (Creosote bush). = Mexican Highlands Province = The Mexican Highlands Province comprises areas in the Mexican Plateau region, including Madrean pine-oak woodlands.

He was owned and bred by Robert Grosvenor, 1st Marquess of Westminster who bought him for the cheap price, at the time, of only 600 guineas at the insistence of his chief stud groom Mr. Thomas Nutting.American Turf Register and Sporting Magazine 1842 vol 13 pge 101 Background He was a brown colt, foaled in 1831, by Camel, his dam was the good broodmare, Banter, by Master Henry. Touchstone was a full brother to the St. Leger Stakes winner, Launcelot (br c 1837).Bloodlines: Touchstone Retrieved on 2009-9-5 Touchstone was described as a \\"peculiar horse\\" (according to The Druid), with an unusual conformation including fleshy legs and a thickened front ankle. He was a frail foal with badly turned hocks that caused him to travel wide when moving. He measured 15 hands 2 inches and had strong hindquarters. Touchstone was unusual in having 19 dorsal vertebrae and a segment of a nineteenth rib on each side, which contributed to his long back.Ahnert, Rainer L. (editor in chief), Thoroughbred Breeding of the World, Pozdun Publishing, Germany, 1970 He was conditioned for racing by the preeminent trainer of the day, John Scott, although Scott did not lay eyes on Touchstone until mid-way through his Classic season. Racing career =Early career= Touchstone made his debut at Lichfield in the Produce Stakes, where he walked over. He then ran third to Queen Bess in the Champagne Stakes at the Holywell Hunt Meeting in October. =Classic Season= Touchstone improved from his juvenile season to win five of his seven starts as a three-year-old. He debuted in the Dee Stakes at Chester in May, before following up in the Palatine Stakes the next day. In both races he beat Queen Bess, who had beaten him in the Champagne Stakes in 1833. Touchstone did not run in the Derby (won by Plenipotentiary), and was next seen in the Liverpool St Leger, where he finished second to General Chass√© after making the running. Despite this loss, trainer John Scott, who was seeing the horse for the first time, proclaimed that the horse would \\"carry off the St Leger\\", and ordered him to be brought to Malton in Yorkshire. Touchstone suffered an eventful journey, after his accompanying groom drank at too many inns and allowed the horse to escape into the wild. He was eventually caught by a seafarer and brought to Sheffield, but he was exhausted and in a bad way when he finally reached Scott's yard. He continued to train so badly that rider William Scott passed over the mount to George Calloway, a \\"country jockey\\". Touchstone was sent off at 40/1 for the St Leger, as he faced not only his conqueror General Chass√©, but the outstanding Derby winner Plenipotentiary, who many considered to be unbeatable. However, it was apparent afterwards that that horse had been poisoned, and Touchstone was able to record an easy two length victory. So unexpected was the win, that Calloway \\"seemed perfectly thunderstruck\\" and \\"turned his head right and left to see whether the others had not all been swallowed up\\". The atmosphere after Touchstone's win was one of complete astonishment. Touchstone ran three more times that year: winning at Wrexham, then finishing second in the Mostyn Stakes at Holywell Hunt before walking over in the Chieftain Stakes the very same day. =Career as an Older Horse= Touchstone won six of eight starts as a four-year-old, including a walk over in the Stand Cup at Chester, a Gold Candelabrum worth 300 sovereigns at Doncaster, a Gold Plate and Gold Cup at Heaton, and two races on the same day at the Holywell Hunt in October. He also finished sixth in the Trademen's Cup at Liverpool. As a five-year-old Touchstone was undefeated, and counted the Ascot Gold Cup, Doncaster Cup and Heaton Park Gold Cup among his wins. In the Ascot Gold Cup, he was ridden by John Day to beat 1833 St Leger winner Rockingham, and in the Doncaster Cup he defeated the great mare, Beeswing. Touchstone made one start as a six-year-old in 1837, and recorded a second win in the Ascot Gold Cup, this time under William Scott. The horse went to front at the turn before drawing away to beat Slane by an easy six lengths as the 1/2 favourite. This was Touchstone's final race, and he retired to stud as the winner of fifteen of twenty one starts with earnings of ¬£5,475. Stud record Touchstone was initially retired to stud duty at Moor Park, near Rickmansworth in Hertfordshire, but then was brought to his owner's Eaton Stud in Cheshire. A major success as a stallion, Touchstone sired three Epsom Derby winners and was the Leading sire in Great Britain & Ireland four times. Of the eight foals from the great racing mare Beeswing, five were sired by Touchstone. His progeny included: * Blue Bonnet (1839) ‚Äì won the St. Leger Stakes * Cotherstone (1840) ‚Äì won the 2,000 Guineas and the Epsom Derby * Flatcatcher (1845) ‚Äì won 2,000 Guineas Stakes * Lord of the Isles (1852) ‚Äì won 2,000 Guineas * Mendicant (1843) ‚Äì a filly who won the 1,000 Guineas and Epsom Oaks * Newminster (1848) ‚Äì won St. Leger Stakes, Leading sire in Great Britain & Ireland in 1859 and 1863, sire of champion sires: Adventurer, Lord Clifden, and seven-time Leading Sire, Hermit * Nunnykirk (1846) ‚Äì won 2,000 Guineas, 2nd in the St. Leger Stakes * Orlando (1841) ‚Äì won the Epsom Derby, Leading sire in Great Britain & Ireland (1851, 1854, 1858) * Surplice (1845) ‚Äì won the Epsom Derby and St. Leger Stakes As late as 1859 he was described as looking \\"fresh and well\\" and his box at Eaton was reported to be one of the attractions for visitors to the Chester agricultural show.

The original was built (or more accurately commissioned) by those who founded a new priory, Lechlade Priory the year before nearby, in 1229 on the line of an old ford.'Lechlade', in A History of the County of Gloucester: Volume 7, ed. N. M. Herbert (Oxford, 1981), pp. 106-121. British History Online http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/glos/vol7/pp106-121 A documented ancient right of taking toll from barges passing under the bridge, with which went the duty of penning back the water to create a 'flash' to enable them to pass, was later claimed by the lords of Lechlade manor as owners of the hospital estate. The Lechlade hospital (hospitalry) also recorded as priory during its existence maintained St. John's bridge; it is known the prior was bestowed grants of pontage in 1338, 1341, and 1388. Later the bridge comprised two large and two small arches and there was a causeway of more than 20 arches across the south meadows. A gateway to the bridge was built by Peter FitzHerbert in 1228 later converted to a larger building known as \\"Noah's Ark\\" in 1716. By 1831 the bridge was dilapidated and an inconclusive dispute over the liability to repair it arose between the county and the occupiers of the former hospital (priory) lands. The county later accepted responsibility, employing a local builder, Peter Cox, to rebuild the bridge as a single arch. In the late 17th century and early 18th the right to take toll was disputed by the bargemen and in the time of Sir Thomas Cutler led on one occasion to the arches being chained over. In 1791 the difficulties of passing the main bridge were avoided when the navigation commissioners for the upper Thames by-passed it with a deepened cut to the immediate south of the old bridge suitable for barges in which they built a lock. The Thames and Severn Canal from Stroud to Lechlade was opened in 1789, the junction with the Thames being 1 km. southwest of the town where a watchman's house was built. Long-distance river traffic had fallen and the canal was closed in 1927.

Geography Mount Sembrano lies between the boundaries of the towns of Jalajala and Pililla in Rizal province and the town of Pakil in Laguna. The mountain sits at the helm of Jalajala peninsula along the shore of Laguna de Bay and is surrounded by the lake on three sides. Along with Talim Island, the mountain forms the southeastern rim of the Laguna Caldera.\\"Laguna Caldera\\". Global Volcanism Program. Retrieved on 2011-12-16. Hiking Once a haven of New People's Army insurgents, the mountain is now a popular hiking destination offering a commanding view of Laguna de Bay, Talim Island, and the Tagalog provinces of Rizal and Laguna. Mount Susong Dalaga (Maiden's breast Mountain), a conical hill resembling the female breast which is the highest peak of neighboring Talim Island, is best observed from Mt. Sembrano. Other mountains visible from the summit are Mount Banahaw, Mount Makiling and the Sierra Madre Mountains. =Starting point= The most common starting point for the climb up the mountain is from the Barangay Hall in Brgy. Malaya in Pililla, Rizal where climbers must register themselves. The hike to the grassy summit which is fully exposed to the sun, takes about three to four hours. Another trail starts from the Laguna side of the mountain in the town of Pakil, but is rarely used. =Our Lady of Maulawin= Mount Sembrano is considered sacred by some people and known for the legend of the miraculous discovery of the icon of Our Lady of Maulawin. In 1909, a group of loggers climbed Mt. Sembrano to cut logs. Felipe Reyno was the one who cut a maulawin tree. The 5 logs was sold in Sta. Cruz, Laguna. In 1910, when an intended shelter for cows was started, the posts was prepared first. A carpenter took the maulawin log (molave) but his saw broke because not only it was young, it was also very hard. He borrowed another saw to continue the cutting, he was completely amazed to see an image of the Virgin Mary imprinted in it. It was completely supernatural because resembling like lead in a pencil, any part of the log if cut it has the same image even to the trunks and branches. Two chops of wood is now enshrined at the Aglipayan church of Santa Cruz in Laguna, one in the side altar and another in an adjacent chapel dedicated for her. A small chapel is placed on the site where the image was discovered. =Other points of interest= Another point along the trail is a big boulder referred to as the Simbahan (Church) where pilgrims leave candles on the huge rock where footprints imprinted on top are supposedly left by the Virgin Mary. Five minutes off the trail is the small Manggahan waterfall, located left of the campsite if you are on your way up. The falls provide water for overnight campers and day trekkers.

Dutch babi pangang In the West, chiefly in The Netherlands, babi panggang is a pork dish served with a tomato-based sauce. This Dutch/Indonesian/Chinese fusion dish is also known as babi panggang speciaal in the Netherlands, and the sauce as speciaal saus (lit.: \\"special sauce\\"). This fusion version of babi panggang became popular in the Netherlands and Flanders through so-called \\"Chinese-Indonesian restaurants\\", common in the Netherlands since the late 1960s and early 1970s. These restaurants are mainly owned and run by immigrants from Hong Kong. The dish consists of slices of crispy deep fried pork served on a bed of acar campur (a pickle-like salad made with thinly sliced white cabbage and carrots of Indonesian origin; it is written atjar tjampoer in Dutch) over which a generous amount of the sauce is poured. It is highly probable that the dish was developed by Cantonese cooks, either in the former Dutch East Indies (present day Indonesia) or in the Netherlands itself after the large influx of Asians and Eurasians following the loss of its Indonesian colony and the advent of large scale international migration world-wide. =Sauce= A version of Babi panggang sauce The accompanying sauce for the Dutch version is similar to other tomato-based sweet and sour sauces common in Cantonese cuisine.

The show originated in the UK with the title Britain's Psychic Challenge. Bunim/Murray Productions produced the American version for Lifetime TV. During a national search of thousands, sixteen self- professed psychics were interviewed and tested to gain a spot to compete on television. For the program, tests were created by the production company with the stated goal of assessing contestants' supernatural abilities. As each psychic is tested, he or she is awarded points based on the results of the tests. At the end of every show, the two psychics with the highest scores move forward to continue in the competition, and the low-scored contestants leave the series. Ultimately, the final two psychics face off to compete for the grand prize of $100,000 and the title of \\"America‚Äôs #1 Psychic\\". The show premiered on the Lifetime Television Network on October 12, 2007. Eight episodes aired with John Burke as the show host. The winner of the first season was Michelle Whitedove. In the final challenge, Whitedove and her challenger Jackie Barrett were handed a photograph of a man. As psychic detectives, they were given thirty minutes to find a stuntman that was buried underground in ten acres of California desert. Whitedove laid the photograph of the man on the exact location, as men dug up the box in which a stuntman lay buried with an oxygen tank. Other competitors were Tori Allah, Jeff Baker, Sloan Bella, Jamie Clark, Silvana Fillmore, Joseph McBratney, Lynn Miller, Naryza Sanchez, Catherine Powell, Karyn Reese, Zenobia Simmons, Kim Stempien, Joseph Tittel, and Robin Zodiac. February 2011 winner Michelle Whitedove was invited to participate in Psychic Challenge International or Het Zesde Zintuig. Winners from six countries were brought together for extreme psychic challenges in the Netherlands. As of January 2012, the Psychic Challenge format has gained worldwide success.

The team currently plays in the Maltese Second Division. Origins The club was founded in 1933 by Gianni Bencini. After only six years in the Malta Football Association, Melita FC managed to go all the way to the final of the Maltese Cup. In the final Melita faced Sliema Wanderers, winning the game 4‚Äì0 ‚Äì the first and so far the only major Cup trophy Melita have won. Melita made it to the final for the second consecutive year in 1940, again playing Sliema, but this time they lost the match 3‚Äì2. During the past 74 years Melita have had a taste of celebration as well as disappointments. Many titles have been won in the third and second division, while Melita's youth nursery team have also had their share of success, as well as a reputation for bringing through quality players that have gone on to play at the highest level. Melita was recently promoted to the Maltese top flight for the first time ever, only to be relegated again the following season. The Club Melita Football Club was founded on 28 April 1933 at the first general meeting by Sur Gian Bencini who was elected the first president of the club at that meeting. The cardinal points in its first statute were that the club would have its base in St. Julians, would have an \\"Amateur\\" status, that the original colours would be red and white and the motto of the club would be \\"Play the Game for the Game's Sake\\" and \\"The Game First and Foremost\\". Any or all of these points could only be changed by a unanimous vote at an Extraordinary General Meeting called for such a purpose. The club has been affiliated with the Malta Football Association since 23 April 1944, representing the locality of St. Julians. The club takes part in four different categories all within the Malta Football Association ‚Äì The Senior Team which will be playing in the First Division this season 2014/2015, the Youth U/19 Team which will be playing in Section \\"B\\" this season, the Ladies Team which is now also starting to accommodate children for its nursery, as well as a Futsal Team also playing 5 a-side football. The long serving President of the Club, Anton Naudi, who has been at the helm these last 26 years since 1983 when Melita were also in the First Division, has stepped down from the Presidency and his place has been taken over by a younger person, Paul Zammit, who has just been elected as the new President in the club's last Annual General Meeting of June 2009 and who himself has also been attached to this club since his playing days and whose father served the club for many years in the past as its treasurer. There is also a new Secretary, Matthew Naudi, Anton's son and also a former stalwart with the club, Alfred Zammit, who has also served the club for many years and has replaced Oliver Lautier as the club's representative on the MFA Council and John Naudi as Vice-President, also an ex player. The treasurer remains the same, Joseph Borg. The club also boasts of a fully fledged coaching and technical staff. All this makes our AMATEUR club being run and managed on a \\"professional\\" basis The club is still to date registered with the MFA as \\"Amateur\\" and still embraces this policy and belief to date. In fact, all the club's players, coaches and administrators give their loyal and dedicated service to the club on a voluntary basis. Our \\"Amateur\\" status had been threatened some years ago, in the beginning of the New Millennium, when UEFA decided that all football associations registered with it should have its clubs playing against a licence issued with UEFA regulations and criteria. This meant that Melita could ONLY keep its prestigious status up to Second Division level. Further up from here UEFA would have asked for a semi-professional status. So, the committee at that time prepared a well laid out and organised request to the MFA not to lose this status. After many meetings and serious considerations, MFA decided to grant the club a \\"ONE TIME LICENCE\\" allowing us to retain our \\"Amateur\\" status permanently. This could only be achieved as a result of our club's well known image and so a milestone in our history was registered. Although the club has won many an honour since its foundation, the greatest of all still remains the famous 4‚Äì0 victory by the club over the well known Sliema Wanderers in the FA Trophy Final in 1939 and, by so doing, has inscribed its name among the many famous local clubs in this prestigious competition. The second biggest success in the club's history was precisely registered in season 2008‚Äì2009 when we won ALL the four competitions in our Senior Sector which the club was participating in, namely the Runner-up position in the Second Division which meant automatic promotion to the First Division and winners of the 11/111 Division K.O. Cup for the Senior Team and champions of Youth Section \\"B\\" which meant promotion to Section \\"A\\" and K.O. Cup Winners of Youth Sections \\"B\\", \\"C\\" and \\"D\\" for the Youth U/19 Team. This success has never been attained by the club before and has also never been achieved by any club member of the MFA competing in all the competitions at stake in one season. The third biggest success emerged in season 2012/2013 when the club will be playing Premier Division football for the first time in its history. The club can also today boast of one of the best sports complexes on the island which know its origin in 2002 when our administrators came up with an ambitious idea to construct a couple of 5 a-side pitches with high quality artificial turf. At that time, such pitches were only dreams in Malta but we had this foresight and, after careful and professional study of feasibility, we opened our first 2 pitches which could convert to one 7 a-side pitch complete with all round fencing, floodlighting and other amenities on 23 May 2004. At a later stage we also embarked on further development and a 50 space car park, additional dressing rooms and an outright conversion of our full size gravel pitch into a super artificial surface pitch known as FIFA 2 Star, which is the nearest to actual turf complete with lighting of the highest standard and FIFA approved steel surround all along the perimeter were brought to mind for discussion. Eventually all this was constructed and were officially inaugurated on 27 April 2008 along with a restructured block to house a snack bar/restaurant and a committee room, two lovely well sized terraces, a children's playground, kit room and more dressing rooms. The club is now also boasting of having the first ever Children's Gym in Malta and this is already functioning along with an adult gym both lying underground and housing the most modern and efficient equipment. Although the club's registered place is in St. Julians where the committees meet regularly, the sports complex is situated in Pembroke as it was never possible to have such a complex constructed in the urban locality of St. Julians, obviously due to lack of space required for such a place. However, notwithstanding the club is in St. Julians and the complex in Pembroke, the club still accepts children and teenagers and adults from any locality around Malta to form part of it. 2012‚Äì13: Golden Era ‚Äì Premier League Season 2012‚Äì13 promised to be a historical season as it meant that Melita would be playing in the Premier League for the first time in their history. Following near misses for promotion from the 2nd tier, they finally managed to gain promotion by winning the 1st Division title. Melita's Premier League adventure started slowly; however, as the season went by some historical wins and results were obtained, including a 2‚Äì1 victory over reigning champions Valletta F.C. as well as a 5‚Äì3 victory over ƒ¶amrun Spartans the final day of the season. =First Phase= At the end of the first phase, Melita ended up finishing in 11th place and therefore qualifying for the relegation pool. At this point, the points would be halved and another two rounds of fixtures would be played. Melita did not fair very well in this phase, winning only their final game of the season and therefore confined to relegation. Group table 2013 ‚Äì 2018: Return to 1st Division Following the clubs' relegation from the Premier division, Melita have once again cemented their place as a 1st Division team in spite of a number of players ending their playing time with the club. Melita have gone close to returning to the premier league in recent seasons, one time missing out on promotion after losing to Gzira United on penalties in a play-off decider, where the eventual winners ended up facing Mosta F.C. for a place in the 2015-16 Maltese Premier League. The club had maintained their status within the division for a number of years, although survival became the clubs ambition year after year. Unfortunately, the club's long spell in the division came to an end on 18 April 2018, following a crushing defeat to San Gwann F.C. which sealed the clubs fate. 2018 ‚Äì present: Life in the 2nd Division Melita F.C. will be competing in the third tier of Maltese football for the first time in 10 years following the club's most successful period. Led by newly appointed coach Edmond Lufi, the club will be looking to bounce back up to the 1st division at the first attempt with a mix of experience and youth, the majority of which are homegrown products. Following a disappointing mid- table finish during head coach Edmond Lufi's first season in charge, an inconsistent start to the 2019-20 season ultimately led to the termination of Edmond Lufi's contract at the club, with Youth team coach Saviour Debono Grech stepped up as interim coach, assisted by former player Emilio Cornago San Pedro, until the end of the season. Melita Nursery The club‚Äôs Nursery was set up in 1989 by among others, Anton Naudi & the late Oliver Lautier but has embarked on a development programme in 1998 when ex players of the club like Robert Balani and Peter Galea and others took the job in hand and today it is regarded as one of the top nurseries in Malta. The nursery caters for boys and Girls from the age of 4/5 till the age of 17 in line with FIFA & UEFA schemes, after which they will join the Senior sector for participation in the Youth and Senior teams. We have presently about 380 children registered. All the age groups participate in various and several tournaments both locally and abroad while the most senior two categories take part in the U/15 and U/17 Leagues organised by the Youth Football Association within the MFA. New sports complex In 2004 Melita F.C inaugurated their first 5-a-side artificial pitches and in the summer of 2007 the club launched the Melita F.C Complex at its training facility in Pembroke, Malta. The complex includes changing rooms, gymnasiums and a 105-metre full sized 2-Star FIFA-recommended pitch, certified to host UEFA Cup and UEFA Champions League matches. The complex also includes a small stand with a maximum capacity of 70 (400 standing). When the pitches were launched they were seen as one of the best training facilities in the area. Players =Current squad= The current first team coach is Saviour Debono Grech who replaced Edmond Lufi halfway through the season. Debono Grech, who is also the present Youth team coach, will be assisted by former Melita player Emilio Cornago San Pedro until the end of the season. Having previously held roles as first team coach at Siggiewi F.C., as well as spells as Assistant Coach with Sliema Wanderers F.C. and at Tarxien Rainbows F.C. in the Maltese Premier League, this will be a welcome return as a first team coach for Debono Grech.

The term is used for products, workmanship or planning. Cables can easily become tangled, making them difficult to work with, sometimes resulting in devices accidentally becoming unplugged as one attempts to move a cable. Such cases are known as \\"cable spaghetti\\", any kind of problem diagnosis and future updates to such enclosures could be very difficult. Cable management both supports and contains cables during installation, and makes subsequent maintenance or changes to the cable system easier. Products such as cable trays, cable ladders, and cable baskets are used to support a cable through cabling routes.  Cable selection The choice of cables is also important; for instance, ribbon cables used to connect Parallel ATA drives to the motherboard can disrupt the airflow inside of computers, making case fans less effective; most SATA cables are more compact and therefore do not have this problem.  Cable labeling Color- coding of cables is sometimes used to keep track of which is which. For instance, the wires coming out of ATX power supplies are color-coded by voltage.ATX Main Power Supply Connector Pinout. Documenting and labeling cable runs, tying related cables together by cable ties, cable lacing, rubber bands or other means, running them through cable guides, and clipping or stapling them to walls are other common methods of keeping them organized. Above drop ceilings, hooks or trays are used to organize cables and protect them from electrical interference Planning is especially crucial for cables such as Thicknet that do not bend around corners easily and fiber optic which is very difficult to splice once cut. Cable strain relief Strain relief plate inside an electrical enclosure, mounted on a 35 mm DIN rail shape H. Strain relief plate on the end of a cable carrier Cable strain relief is a mechanical protection for flexible electrical cables, wires, conduits and pneumatic hoses. It is regulated by the European standard EN 62444 (formerly EN 50262.BS EN 50262:1999 Cable glands for electrical installations). With a strain relief component, the connection between a flexible electrical line and its connection port is protected against mechanical stress. Usually, the lines are fixed by clamping them into single cable clamps made of plastic or metal. Another possibility is to use so called cord grips which consist of weaved wire strands that put a grip around the cables. A more cable-friendly alternative is attaching the lines to special strain relief plates using common cable ties. In case of industrial applications these strain relief plates are as well cost-effective because the packing density (meaning the possible number of lines to be fixed on one plate) is much higher than with common cable clamps which are normally designed for holding one single line. Furthermore, most of the available cable clamps are not very flexible when it comes to routing lines with varying diameters. That causes higher acquisition and storage costs. The installation of the single cable clamps can take a lot of mounting time, depending on the laying length of the lines. Strain relief plates are therefore a more flexible solution which allows a parallel routing of several lines with varying diameters. Strain relief is often required for terminated electrical lines that are plugged into sockets or ports to prevent unplugging or accidentally ripping out of the connector. At which point the lines have to be strain relieved depends on the application. For PROFINET, for example, which is used in automation it is recommended to set the strain relief component approx. 1 m / 3.5 ft from the connection point. Strain relief components are also used in applications where cables, conduits and hoses are exposed to constant dynamic stress (cable carriers / drag chains).  Computer data cabling, structured cabling, LAN cabling  Generally, one end of a cable is terminated in the data cabinet. The other end of a cable ends at the desk. The cable management needs at either end are different. Buildings and office furniture are often designed with cable management in mind; for instance, desks sometimes have holes to pass cables, and dropped ceilings, raised floors, and In Floor Cellular Raceway Systems provide easy access. Some cables have requirements for minimum bend radius or proximity to other cables, particularly power cables, to avoid crosstalk or interference. Power cables often need to be grouped separately and suitably apart from data cables, and only cross at right angles which minimizes electromagnetic interference. The organized routing of cables inside the computer case allows for optimal airflow and cooling. Good cable management also makes working inside a computer much easier by providing safer hardware installation, repair, or removal. Some PC mod enthusiasts showcase the internal components of their systems with a window mod, which displays the aesthetics of internal cabling as well as the skills and wealth of the modder. The IT industry needs data cables to be added, moved, or removed many times during the life of the installation. It is usual practice to install \\"fixed cables\\" between cabling closets or cabinets. These cables are contained in cable trays etc., and are terminated at each end onto patch panels in the communications cabinet or outlets at the desktop. The circuits are then interconnected to the final destination using patch cords.  Cable planning Because large IT infrastructures often encompass vast networks of cables -- all of which need to be serviced, removed, added, and so on throughout an installation lifecycle -- cable planning, in some fashion, is a necessity. Techs may employ different methods of cable planning, depending upon the level of detail required for proper management. Excel can be employed for organizing information, however techs often need a way to visually organize information, which goes beyond Excel‚Äôs capabilities. For proper visualization of cabling, companies may opt to use a cable management software package.  In hospitals In hospital situations, cable management can be critical to preventing medical mistakes. Emergency room nurse manager Pat Gabriel said, \\"My wish is that we could somehow not have spaghetti on the bed. When you look at all those wires and those IVs, it's just spaghetti\\".Medical Mistakes, The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer, PBS, March 26, 2001. Cabling in healthcare facilities must be grounded, shielded and routed in accordance with life safety codes to minimize interference with medical equipment. In offices Cables are managed by five methods in commercial buildings: * Concrete trenching - a trench is dug into the building's concrete. Cabling and floor boxes are installed and the trench is sealed with concrete. * Floor decking - cables are installed on the ceiling of the floor below.

Cord concealers (also called cord protectors) are commonly used in offices to prevent accidents while protecting the cord and the appliance its attached to. Office furniture can sometimes have built in cable management solutions. In moving equipment Cable management is particularly important in powered equipment which must move large distances while tethered to a power source and control cabling. There are several common methods of cable management. With a suspended sliding coil, the cables are coiled like a spring, with each loop of the coil attached to a sliding shoe on a track. As the cabling is played out, the shoes slide individually along the track and the coils expand. When sliding the other direction, the coils fold back together into a compact spiral. Folded linear cable uses either a flexible backbone shell, or a flat cable folded into an arc along its long axis. This style of cabling is very common in computer printers to connect the printhead to the circuitry, but is also used in very large linear moving gantries. The cables are flexed only in a small region in a tight radius and so need to be very flexible.

He raced in the Championship Off-Road Racing (CORR) series in the 1990s when he was the Pro 2 champion in CORR despite racing using hand controls since he is a paraplegic. He continues to race occasional races as of the end of the 2012 season. Evan Evans is the son of off-road racing \\"The Legend\\" Walker Evans. \\"It doesn't matter if you're in a wheelchair or have healthy legs,\\" Evans added \\"If you have the will to do something, you can get it done. I race the same as anyone else does; I just don't use my feet. And, I never give up.\\"About Evan Evans, Retrieved October 12, 2007 Accident On July 13, 1989, a motorcycle accident significantly changed Evans' life. He was thrown from a bike when he hit a ditch from a construction project near his home. He was paralyzed from the chest down. \\"When the doctors told me my spinal cord had been severed, it was my worst nightmare come true,\\" says Evans. \\"But I decided then and there, I was not going to give up.\\" He saw no reason why not being able to walk should stop him from doing what he loved. Racing career =Early racing career= Having rehabilitated, Evans entered some desert races to develop his hand controls and hone his driving skills. He also competed in the Mickey Thompson Stadium Series, a now defunct indoor stadium short-course off-road racing series. In 1996, Evans built a Chevrolet C1500 truck, which he successfully campaigned in the popular Midwestern SODA (Short Course Off-Road Racing Association) Series. Evans claimed seven class victories and one second-place finish, and won the 1996 Class 13 Championship title. The season put his name in the record books as the winningest truck class driver in SODA history. His domination of the series earned Evans the special recognition of becoming the first paraplegic racer to capture a professional off-road racing title. Evans' first-season success in the SODA Series netted him the honors of being elected to the 1996 AARWBA Auto Racing All-America Team in the \\"At Large\\" category; and he also received the 1996 SODA \\"Driver of the Year\\" award. After winning five of the eight races in 1997, Evans finished the SODA season in second place in the Class 13 point standings. =Championship Off Road Racing= The SODA series was replaced by CORR (Championship Off-Road Racing) as the prominent off-road racing series in 1998. Evans moved up to a Trophy Truck in the new series. He competed in the Pro-2 (rear wheel drive trucks) division. He took one win and eight top-five finishes to post a sixth-place position in the final point standings. In 1999 Evan took one win, 9 top-five finishes to post fifth-place position, still adapting to the Pro-2 class. In 2000 Evan Raced the CORR Series and won seven races and placed second in the final points standings. In 2001 in the CORR Series he placed second in the final points standings, with five wins and 12 top-five Finishes.

Evan also set a fast track record for a Pro-2 at that track. In 2003 Evans raced the CORR Series and won 1 race and had ten top-5 finishes. He placed third in the final points standings. In the CORR Series Evan set fast lap record overall (first time a 2-wheel drive truck's time has beat a 4-wheel drive's time) at Bark River. Evan also qualified for the pole position for the \\"Fabulous Five\\" in the Borg Warner at Crandon International Off-Road Raceway. In 2004, Scott Taylor was leading Evans by 18 points going into the final two-race weekend. The track was wet and slippery on the Saturday race and Taylor finished fourth, two spots ahead of Evans. In the final round, Taylor finished in second place, one spot in front of Evans, to win his sixth consecutive Pro-2 CORR title. Evans had 11 top 5 finishes and 4 wins. He is the first Pro-2 driver to get four consecutive wins. Evans has raced occasionally since and the sanctioning bodies have changed several times. In the 2012, he raced in five Lucas Oil Off Road Racing Series Pro 2 Unlimited events. =Desert racing= The last time Evan Evans drove in the Baja 1000, he was only three days out of a hospital, where he had been told he was paralyzed from the chest down from a motorcycle accident. He was helped into a Jeep Cherokee specially prepared with hand controls by his father, Walker, so he could at least start the world's most famous off-road race. Evans, then 24, drove the first 72 miles before turning the Jeep over to Brian Stewart, who finished the 1989 race. It was enough to assure Evans of the SCORE International (SCORE)/High Desert Racing Assn. championship in Class 6, one for production sedans.

Unlike a legal defense, it cannot lead to the acquittal of the defendant. The opposite of a mitigating factor is an aggravating factor. Examples The Sentencing Council of England and Wales lists the following as possible mitigating factors:Sentencing Council *Admitting the offense, such as through a guilty plea *Mental illness *Provocation *Young age *Showing remorse Self-defense is a legal defense rather than a mitigating factor, as an act done in justified self-defense is not deemed to be a crime. If the offender was provoked but cannot be considered to have acted in self-defense, then the provocation can be used as a mitigating factor but not as a legal defense. By legal system =England and Wales= According to historical English and Welsh procedure, the jury has no power to determine the punishment to be awarded for an offense. The sentence, with certain exceptions in capital cases, is within the sole discretion of the judge, subject to the statutory prescriptions as to the kind and maximum of punishment. It is common practice for juries to add to their verdict, guilty or not guilty, a rider recommending the accused to mercy on the ground of grave provocation received, or other circumstances which in their view should mitigate the penalty. =India= According to the Indian procedure the provision of Section 235(2) of Criminal Procedure Code calls upon the Court that the convicted accused must be given an opportunity of being heard on the question of sentence. This provides the accused an opportunity to place his antecedents, social and economic background and mitigating and extenuating circumstances before the court. Besides the statutory provisions, the Constitution of India also empowers the President and the Governor of the State to grant pardon to the condemned offenders in appropriate cases. These powers are, however, co-extensive with the legislative powers. The power to cut short a sentence by an act of executive in India and elsewhere. It is significant to note that the controversy raised in this regard in Nanavati's case has been settled by the Supreme Court once for all in the case of SARAT CHANDRA V/S. KHAGENDRA NATH which affirmed the principle that sentencing power of judiciary and executive are readily distinguishable. Quite independently of any recommendation by the jury, the judge is entitled to take into account matters proved during the trial, or laid before him/her after verdict, as a guide to determining the quantum of punishment. =France= Under French law (, art. 345), it is the sole right and the duty of a jury in a criminal case to pronounce whether or not the perpetration of the offense was attended by extenuating circumstances (). They are not bound to say anything about the matter, but the whole or the majority may qualify the verdict by finding extenuation, and if they do, the powers of the court to impose the maximum punishment are taken away and the sentence to be pronounced is reduced in accordance with the scale laid down in art. 463 of the Code penal. The most important result of this rule in earlier times was to enable a jury to prevent the infliction of capital punishment for murder (now abolished). =United States= In the U.S., most mitigating factors are presented in ways that are best described by clinical evaluations of the defendant and the circumstances, thus involving psychological or psychiatric analysis in the presentation to the court. Approximately one half of U.S. states allow evidence that the defendant was under extreme mental or emotional distress as a mitigating factor, if it is accompanied by an evaluation that the defendant's ability to appreciate the criminal aspect of his offense (mens rea), or his ability to control his behavior to meet the requirements of the law, was impaired. There is empirical evidence that expert testimony on future dangerousness has less effect on jury decisions than does expert testimony on the defendant's mental functioning. However, there is no evidence so far that expert testimony does influence the jury on sentencing outcomes in death penalty cases. Death penalty In the United States, the issue of mitigating factors is most important in death penalty cases. In a series of decisions since 1972, the United States Supreme Court has attempted to make the sentence of death in the United States less arbitrary by emphasizing that the judge or jury must be given the opportunity to consider all mitigating evidence before determining the sentence. Thus the Court has stressed that because of the constitutional requirement of the fundamental respect for human dignity set out by the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution, information must be provided on the character and previous history of the defendant, as well as the circumstances surrounding the particular offense. The Supreme Court in Penry v. Lynaugh, and subsequently the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in Bigby v. Dretke, remanded cases in which the jury instructions in death penalty cases did not ask the jury to consider as mitigating factors the defendant's mental health, saying that the jury be instructed to consider mitigating factors when answering unrelated questions. The Supreme Court's rulings have broadened the definition of mitigating evidence in the United States and systematically removed the procedural barriers to jury consideration and weight of that evidence. The effect of these decisions is to broaden the definition of mitigating factors related to mental illness within the U.S. justice system, and to be more consistent with standard psychiatric and psychological findings that correlate specific behaviors to identifiable mental disorders. As a result of these decisions, even in the absence of a direct connection between the illness and the illegal action (as is required in the guilt phase of the insanity defense), the court acknowledges that the effects of a severe mental illness have pervasive effect on a person's behavior and can therefore be a relevant consideration in death penalty considerations. If all relevant mitigating factors are not considered in a death penalty case, the punishment can be considered \\"cruel and unusual\\", the Supreme Court ruled in Tennard v. Dretke, a case in which the prosecution sought to exclude evidence of a low IQ in the penalty phase of the trial. There is also an ongoing tendency of the Supreme Court to seek to include evidence of a defendant's potential for rehabilitation and a law-abiding future. Limits The Supreme Court held in Lockett v. Ohio that a defendant facing the death penalty is entitled to present any aspect of character or record, and any circumstance of the offense that might serve as a basis for a sentence less than death. The court may limit evidence not pertaining to these issues as \\"irrelevant\\". Although it has been argued that the defendant should be able to offer evidence questioning the morality of the death penalty or descriptions of the execution process, no court has allowed such testimony.

Background Irving lived at the Alhambra Palace while writing some of the material for his book. Shortly after completing a biography of Christopher Columbus in 1828, Washington Irving travelled from Madrid, where he had been staying, to Granada, Spain.

A plaque now marks the rooms in which Irving stayed while writing some of his book. Alexander Pushkin's 1834 tale in verse The Tale of the Golden Cockerel is based on two chapters of Tales of the Alhambra. In turn, the Pushkin poem inspired Vladimir Belsky's libretto for the opera \\"The Golden Cockerel\\" by Nikolay Rimsky-Korsakov. The book serves as the basis of the 1950 Spanish film Tales of the Alhambra. Villa Zorayda, a museum in St. Augustine, Florida based on a wing of the Alhambra, takes its name from a character in Irving's bookVilla Zorayda: History (specifically from \\"Legend of the Three Beautiful Princesses\\").

The highway enters the state from the north near Carr and exits the state near Starkville. The highway also runs through the cities of Fort Collins, Loveland, and Pueblo. The route is concurrent with U.S. Highway 87 through the entire length of the state. I-25 replaced U.S. Highway 87 and most of U.S. Highway 85 for through traffic. Historical nicknames for this route have included the Valley Highway (through Denver), Monument Valley Highway (through Colorado Springs), and the Pueblo Freeway (through Pueblo). Within El Paso County, the route has been dedicated as the Ronald Reagan Highway.Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation & Library In Pueblo County, the route is called John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway. Interstate 25 is also considered to be part of the unofficial Pan-American Highway. Route description =New Mexico state line to Pueblo= Northbound I-25 between Colorado Springs and Denver. Following the Santa Fe Trail from New Mexico, Interstate 25 enters Colorado as a typical four-lane Interstate Highway, where its entire route in Colorado lies close to the east side of the Rocky Mountains. The route turns from north to west-northwest as I-25 serves Wootton. After leaving Wootton, I-25 turns back up north and bypasses near the east side of the Trinidad Lake State Park, home of the Trinidad Lake. Trinidad, a city near the Trinidad Lake, is the first major city that lies along I-25. For the next , I-25 continues north through the rural areas of Colorado until it reaches the small city of Walsenburg, where the business route - I-25 Bus. - junctions with U.S. Highway 160. I-25 then continues in a north-northwest direction until it bypasses the Orlando Reservoir, then turns north from there until it reaches Colorado City. In Colorado City, I-25 interchanges with the east end of the Frontier Pathways Scenic and Historic Byway (SH 165) at exit 74. After leaving the city, I-25 follows in a north-northeast orientation until it reaches the St. Charles Reservoir just before entering the city of Pueblo, with the first exit within the southern city limits of Pueblo at exit 94. The Arkansas River in Pueblo serves as a feeder to the Lake Pueblo State Park, home of the Pueblo Lake, which is located to the west of the western city limits of Pueblo.Google Maps street maps and USGS topographic maps, accessed February 2008 via ACME Mapper =Pueblo to Denver= I-25 during rush hour in the largest city I-25 serves, Denver, looking East toward Downtown Denver. After leaving Pueblo, I-25 continues up north with the Union Pacific Railroad line paralleling closely to the route on the right side after interchanging with Porter Draw at exit 106. By exit 119, the Fountain Creek joins along and travels parallel with I-25, and continues all the way to the Fountain Creek Regional Park in Widefield. I-25 gradually turns from a general north direction to the north-northwest and serves the census-designated place of Buttes at exit 122. Cheyenne Mountain, as seen from I-25 near Fort Carson. Note the communications antennas at the summit, which are radio antennas for stations broadcasting in Colorado Springs.As soon as US 85 leaves I-25 at exit 128, I-25 enters the city limits of Fountain. Basically, I-25 serves as the border between the western city limits of Fountain on the east side of I-25 and Fort Carson on the west side. Exit 132 (SH 16) serves the north side of the Fountain Creek Regional Park as well as the entrance to Fort Carson and connects to SH 21 (Powers Boulevard), the eastern bypass for the Colorado Springs metro area. By the time I-25 reaches exit 138, the route crosses into the city limits of Colorado Springs, where the stack interchange with US 24 at exit 139 serves the Evergreen Cemetery and Prospect Lake. I-25 turns west at exit 140, along with the Fountain Creek, where it interchanges with US 85, US 87, and I-25 Bus. I-25 again turns back north by exit 141. Swinging around the west side of downtown Colorado Springs at exit 142, and to the north of the city lies the Colorado College, and is served at exit 143 - Uintah Street. Continuing north and northeast, the highway intersects the north terminus of I-25 Bus. and US 85. The interstate leaves Colorado Springs between exits 153 and 156, where I-25 enters the United States Air Force Academy, going through the east side of the institution. Map showing I-25 and nearby freeways and major highways in the Denver Metropolitan areaI-25 leaves El Paso County and enters Douglas County at Monument Hill, elevation 7,352 feet, north of Monument. I-25 then continues north through more rural and hilly areas east of the Rocky Mountains until reaching Castle Rock at exit 181. I-25 continues through rural and hilly portions of Douglas County until interchanging with E-470, the partial beltway of Denver as the toll road serves the Centennial Airport and the much larger Denver International Airport. After entering Arapahoe County, I-25 cuts through the Denver Technological Center (DTC) between Dry Creek Road and Belleview Avenue (exits 196-199). I-25 enters Denver at the I-225 interchange, a spur that detours motorists to I-70 through Aurora, at exit 200. I-25 turns in an westerly direction between Evans Avenue (Exit 203) and Colorado Boulevard (Exit 204). University of Denver lies just to the south of the interstate at Exit 205. It then turns back north after Exit 207. I-25 curves around the west side of downtown Denver, where it can be accessed by I-70 Bus. at exit 210. I-25 then interchanges with I-70 at exit 214 right before leaving the City and County of Denver. =Denver to Wyoming state line= As I-25 leaves Denver, the route continues up north through unincorporated areas of Adams County and interchanges with I-76, I-270, and the Denver-Boulder Turnpike (US 36). Due to the complexity of this triangle-shaped interchange, it was known to be one of many malfunction junctions throughout the United States. Beyond that interchange, the interstate enters the northern suburbs of the Denver metro area, such as Thornton and Northglenn, and at exit 220, I-25 slips its way through a narrow path between the Badding Reservoir (west side) and the Croke Lake (east side). Development begins to drop off after exit 223 (120th Avenue) after continuing north into Westminster and eastern Broomfield. At exit 228, I-25 interchanges with the northern termini of E-470 and Northwest Parkway at a stack interchange, with the Larkridge Mall just to the north, served by 160th Avenue (SH 7). As I-25 continues north, it moves through rolling farm and grasslands with the Front Range and high mountains clearly visible to the west while passing through a medley of lakes and reservoirs. It stays generally flat with few moderate climbs in elevation, while also serving smaller cities like Dacono and Firestone to the east and Longmont to the west. This stretch of I-25 in northern Colorado also has large amounts of truck traffic between SH 7 and Wyoming. After some time in the rural farmlands, the interstate enters the Fort Collins/Loveland metro area at exit 255, serving Loveland and Greeley to at exits 255 and 257, Windsor at exit 261, and continuing north to the Fort Collins city limits south of Harmony Road. The highway runs on the eastern side of Fort Collins, serving Colorado State University at exits 268 and 269 (which is also the most direct route to downtown). After exit 271, I-25 leaves Fort Collins and rolls into more rural grasslands past Wellington. Exits also become few and far between from here to Wyoming as well after gradually turning north-easterly towards the state line. History =Ancestors and early freeways= Colorado had begun planning of a modern inter-city route along the Front Range as early as 1944, well before the national movement toward an Interstate Highway system. State Highway 1, an unpaved road, was completed between Denver and Pueblo by 1919. Average travel time between Pueblo and Colorado Springs on this route was approximately 2.5 hours (or a full 8.5 hours from Pueblo to Denver). This route was upgraded with the help of the federal government to become US 85 and US 87 by 1930, now paved in concrete and shortening the travel time between Pueblo and Colorado Springs to just one hour. The cities of Denver (in 1948) and Pueblo (in 1949) were first to begin building multi-lane highway segments along the route of what would eventually become Interstate 25. Construction follows an earlier segment of the Colorado and Southern Railway. Denver's segment was originally known as the Valley Highway and was completed by 1958. The city of Colorado Springs followed a similar theme with their Monument Valley Freeway, begun in 1955 and completed by July 1960. Pueblo's section ‚Äî the Pueblo Freeway - was complete by July 1959. =Interstate completion= As the national Interstate Highway System began to take shape, actual \\"inter- state\\" connections began to be made. Wyoming came first in 1964, building a link north to Cheyenne that was connected to Colorado's stretch. Linking to New Mexico in the south would prove more problematic as the planned route had to stretch over Raton Pass, and its accompanying elevation change, within just . Once again, US 85 and US 87 were used, but it had to be re-graded in places to meet Interstate design guidelines. Construction began in 1960, with a link to the city of Trinidad completed by 1963. The Trinidad Segment (as CDOT now calls the Raton Pass span) was not fully completed until 1968. The final segment of the Colorado portion of Interstate 25, connecting the cities of Walsenburg and Trinidad, was completed during 1969. This meant that four lanes of high-speed, nonstop freeway were finally open for a full from New Mexico north to Wyoming.Kuennen, Tom, ed. Interstate 50: 50 Years of the Dwight D. Eisenhower National System of Interstate and Defense Highways. 2006: Faircount. pp 118-119. ISBN unavailable. =Modern expansion= As both population and traffic increased in Colorado during the 1990s and 2000s, the Colorado Department of Transportation has planned and completed major improvements for the city corridors along I-25. T-REX (Denver) T-REX Logo The first of these was Transportation Expansion (T-REX), which widened and expanded nearly of both I-25 and the I-225 bypass in the Denver Metropolitan Area as well as adding various pedestrian and aesthetic improvements. T-REX was also instrumental in expanding Denver's RTD light rail lines to connect outlying communities beyond the city and county of Denver, adding of new routes. Starting in early 2004, the T-REX project was completed during 2006 at a cost of US$1.67 billion, under its projected budget and two years ahead of its originally scheduled conclusion. It has been hailed as a \\"model for other cities to follow\\" and \\"ahead of the curve nationally\\" by federal transportation and transit authorities. COSMIX (Colorado Springs) COSMIX Logo As T-REX began to wrap up, CDOT's next major effort began with Colorado Springs Metro Interstate Expansion (COSMIX). It could be argued that COSMIX was even more important to Colorado's interests than T-REX had been, since the Colorado Springs corridor of I-25 had seen immense growth over the past four decades, and experienced major choke points all along the 16-mile corridor from Exit 135 (Academy Blvd) in the south to Exit 151 (Briargate Pkwy) in the north. Originally carrying around 8500 vehicles per day in 1960, usage of the former Monument Valley Freeway had grown to an average of 100,000 vehicles per day by 2005.Kuennen, Tom, ed. Interstate 50: 50 Years of the Dwight D. Eisenhower National System of Interstate and Defense Highways. 2006: Faircount. pp 118-119. ISBN unavailable. The major goals of COSMIX, which began in 2005 and was completed a year and four days ahead of schedule at the very end of December 2007, were a general expansion and widening of the corridor to three lanes in each direction throughout the city, as well as the reconstruction of two main interchanges (at Bijou Street near downtown Colorado Springs, and at Rockrimmon Boulevard and North Nevada Avenue in the city's growing north side). Originally estimated at $225 million, on delivery COSMIX cost only $150 million, approximately $20 million of which involved land acquisition costs. COSMIX was the first funded portion of a larger plan for I-25 improvements as detailed in an Environmental Assessment approved by CDOT and FHWA in 2004. A second phase resulted in the widening of the 12 mile segment from Woodmen Road (exit 149) to Monument (exit 161) to six lanes and addition of auxiliary lanes at busy interchanges. The Air Force Academy interchange (exit 156) was reconfigured to include just one exit, instead of A/B, and features two new roundabouts for North Gate Boulevard. The widening and paving was completed in December 2014. An EA-recommended improvement not included in COSMIX due to funding limitations was the reconstruction of the I-25 interchange at Cimarron Street (US 24 West). CDOT completed this project in late 2017. Future , a seven mile segment of I-25 through Pueblo is currently under construction. Enhancements include the widening of two bridges, noise wall installation, the softening of curves for better safety, and the addition of acceleration and deceleration lanes. The $69 million dollar project was expected to finish in Spring 2019. There is much controversy surrounding the future of Interstate 25 in northern Colorado (SH 7 in Broomfield to SH 14 in Fort Collins). Suggestions from adding toll lanes to general expansion to six lanes from the two lane bottleneck at SH 66 to SH 14 and adding multi-modal transportation options have been discussed. The future of the highway remains in question as funding is limited, and agreement is limited as well. The I-25 corridor in Weld and Larimer counties is becoming increasingly heavy with traffic, and something will have to be done soon. In Colorado Springs, SH 21 (Powers Blvd.) is planned on being extended from SH 83 to I-25. This project provides an easier bypass around the north end of the town and will also help connect Voyager Pkwy traffic to the interstate. The construction is in two phases, I-25 is involved in phase 1 where a new directional T-interchange (Y-interchange) will be built near exit 156 at N. Gate Blvd. between mile markers 149 and 151. As of October 2020, phase 1 of the construction is underway and is anticipated to be completed in summer 2021.https://i25powers.com/https://www.codot.gov/projects/co-21-research- parkway-interchange-study Exit list References External links *Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) *COSMIX (CDOT project; website no longer being updated) *South I-25 Corridor: Lincoln Avenue through Castle Rock (CDOT project) *The North Forty (CDOT project) *I-25 Trinidad (CDOT project) *The New Pueblo Freeway (proposed CDOT project) Colorado 25 Category:Transportation in Las Animas County, Colorado Category:Transportation in Huerfano County, Colorado Category:Transportation in Pueblo County, Colorado Category:Transportation in El Paso County, Colorado Category:Transportation in Douglas County, Colorado Category:Transportation in Arapahoe County, Colorado Category:Transportation in Denver Category:Transportation in Adams County, Colorado Category:Transportation in Broomfield County, Colorado Category:Transportation in Weld County, Colorado Category:Transportation in Larimer County, Colorado Category:U.S. Route 87 ","title":"Interstate 25 in Colorado"},{"id":"13697433","text":"Epaderm is brand of emollient made by M√∂lnlycke Health Care, which is used for the treatment of dry skin, including conditions such as eczema.

Chaudhry Zahoor Elahi began his career in the police force as a constable but gave it up soon after the creation of Pakistan and ventured into business in association with his elder brother Ch. Manzoor Elahi, who was a textile engineer by profession. The two brothers jointly purchased and operated a textile mills after independence of Pakistan in Gujrat. Chaudhry Zahoor Elahi was a Jat of the Warriach clan. He entered local politics in the 1950s. During Ayub Khan's rule. During this period, the governor of West Pakistan, Nawab of Kalabagh Amir Mohammad Khan, was opponent of Chaudhry Zahoor Elahi. As the Secretary-General of the Convention Muslim League, he came to oppose Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. In his conflict with Bhutto, Chaudhry Zahoor Elahi was imprisoned and his family property was confiscated by the Government. Chaudhry Zahoor Elahi was assassinated in Lahore in 1981 by al-Zulfikar, a terrorist organisation led by Murtaza Bhutto, who claimed responsibility for the attack. Early life Chaudhry Zahoor Elahi's father was Chaudhry Sardar Khan Warraich . Chaudhry Sardar Khan Warraich was a great admirer of Punjabi Sufi poetry. Chaudhry Manzur Elahi, father of Chaudhry Parvez Elahi is the elder brother of Chaudhry Zahoor Elahi. He was raised in Gujrat but left his hometown in 1939 to pursue further studies. He received his degree in textile engineering from Amritsar in 1940. Business Upon his return from Amritsar, Chaudry Manzur Elahi teamed with Chaudhry Zahoor Elahi to develop a family owned textile business in Gujrat. After independence in 1947, the two brothers established two textile units under the names of Gujrat Silk Mills and Pakistan Textile Mills. In 1950, the business was expanded to Lahore where they established Parvez Textile Mills, specializing in weaving, finishing and dyeing. In 1951‚Äì52, Chaudhry Manzur Elahi went to Japan to import textile machinery for Gujrat and Lahore units. Armed with his textile education and business skills, Chaudry Manzur Elahi's textile units continued to flourish under his leadership. The family continued to dedicate their energies to their business and set up Modern Flour Mills in Lahore and Rawalpindi. Early political career In 1956, Chaudry Zahoor Elahi decided to enter politics while Chaudhry Manzur Elahi was running family business. Chaudhry Zahoor Elahi was elected Chairman of the Gujrat District Board in 1958. Same year, Chaudhry Zahoor Elahi was also elected as a Director of the National Bank of Pakistan. He kept returning to the National Bank board of directors for the next twelve years. In 1958, General Ayub Khan imposed martial law. He enforced the Elected Bodies Disqualification Order (EBDO) which was used to disqualify politicians for next five years. The politicians facing EBDO were given two options; they were either to retire voluntarily from politics or to face Government's punitive action. Chaudhry Zahoor Elahi was the only politician, who challenged the draconian EBDO ordinance. Despite being cleared by the EBDO Tribunal of all charges, Chaudhry Zahoor Elahi was victimized by the Martial Law regime and was sentenced to six months imprisonment. Despite this, Chaudhry Zahoor Elahi was elected Member of the National Assembly in 1962 and he consequently became Secretary General of the Pakistan Muslim League's Parliamentary Party of United Pakistan. Around this time the family also purchased Pakistan Times, English daily published from West Pakistan. 1970s He was elected to the National Assembly in 1970. He was among the few members of the Pakistan Muslim League to get elected. Followed by the fall of East Pakistan in 1971 Mr. Z. A Bhutto emerged as the new ruler of the remaining Pakistan. On his coming to power, Z.A. Bhutto nationalized all major industries including flour mills. Chaudhry Zahoor Elahi was among the nine opposition parliamentary leaders who were forcibly thrown out of the Parliament House on Bhutto's orders. From ludicrous and politically motivated police cases such as the alleged buffalo theft case to the farfetched case of supply of Iraqi arms for rebellion in Balochistan, he was constantly targeted and implicated in several fabricated cases during Bhutto rule. But this could not silence Chaudhry Zahoor Elahi's. He was arrested for delivering an anti-government speech in Hotel Inter Continental, Karachi and a special tribunal sentenced him to imprisonment for five years. He remained imprisoned in different jails but mostly remained at the Karachi jail. The Pakistan National Alliance (PNA) gained momentum following 1977. All top PNA leaders including Chaudhry Zahoor Elahi were arrested. Chaudhry Zahoor Elahi and others were released when General Zia ul Haq's army took over on July 5, 1977. General Zia ul Haq immediately announced holding of fresh elections within 90 days. Chaudhry Zahoor Elahi filed his nomination papers from Gujrat and Constituency No.3 of Lahore from where Z. A. Bhutto had also declared to contest. However, these elections were postponed when General Mohammad Zia ul Haq arrested Bhutto. Due to the deteriorating financial plight of the nationalized industries, Zia government decided to return them to their original owners. The Chaudhry family took charge of their previously nationalised flourmills. 1980s Following General Zia's actions against the Bhutto family, Murtaza Bhutto formed Al ‚Äì Zulfiqar. Ghulam Mustafa Khar, who was living in exile in London informed a close associate of Chauhdry Zahoor Elahi of Al-Zulfiqar's plot to assassinate Chaudhry Zahoor Elahi. Tragically, Chaudhry Zahoor Elahi became the first victim of Al ‚Äì Zulfiqar when he was assassinated in Lahore in September 1981. Murtaza Bhutto publicly accepted responsibility for the assassination in his interview with BBC. At this juncture, the Chaudhry family decided that Chaudhry Shujat Hussain and Chaudhry Parvez Elahi (sons of Chaudhry Zahoor Elahi and Chaudhry Manzur Elahi) should take charge of the family business as well as enter politics.

The fantasy novel is about a teenage superhero, Thom Creed, who must deal with his ex-superhero father's disgrace, his own sexuality, and a murderer stalking the world's heroes. Plot summary Thom Creed is a 16-year-old high school basketball star, who has a tendency to get into trouble. His mother abandoned the family several years ago, and his father Hal, a publicly disgraced ex-superhero, is now a lowly factory worker. Thom is filled with teen-aged angst because he is gay and knows that his father greatly disapproves of homosexuality. He becomes a tutor for children with reading and language disorders at the community center, and often reads to his students. After an incident during a reading session, he is moved to another class where he meets a young man named Goran. Thom mistakes Goran for a student because of his strong accent, accidentally offending him. It turns out that actually Goran is the person who started the reading program a few years before. During a basketball game, Thom recognizes one of the players from the opposing team as Goran. Thom is thrown off his game and Goran ends up breaking one of his legs. Strangely, Thom heals Goran's injury by touching his leg over the compound fracture. He has healed others before, but does not fully understand his ability. Apparently no one notices what he has done for Goran, and when the game resumes, another player calls Thom a faggot in front of everyone. Afterwards, Thom has a seizure, which is most likely related to stress created by absorbing Goran's injuries, and his fears about his father discovering his sexual orientation. While recuperating at the hospital, he is forced to give up his driver's license and must resort to using the bus to get around. During the summer, Thom's coach kicks him off the team due to his medical issues, though Thom gets the coach to confess that it is actually because of the comment made during the game. When he gets home, he takes his father's laptop and decides to look at porn. Thom explains that he is afraid to come out not only because of his father, but due to living in a homophobic town. While masturbating to a picture of local superhero Uberman, Hal comes home to get ready for his real estate class. Thom quickly straightens things up, but doesn't have enough time to erase his history on the computer. When his father does leave, Thom decides to run away from home. When he falls asleep on the bus, he becomes mixed up in a battle between some villains and The League. He also encounters a mysterious man known as Dark Hero, who works alone. Thom ends up using his powers yet again on a young mother, and gets an invitation to try out for one the minor leagues. When he gets home, he discovers that Hal's former mentor Captain Victory has died. He decides not to tell his father about the tryouts, because Hal harbors intense resentment for The League. Thom is accepted as a trainee, and assigned to work with a group of other probationary heroes. The group consists of Ruth, an aging psychic, Scarlett, who can control heat, and Larry, who has the ability to give others any disease. The stress of keeping so many secrets from his father exacts a painful toll. Soon, however, the world's superheroes begin dying under mysterious circumstances. In order to solve the mystery, Thom must reunite with his fellow outcast trainees and deal as well with society's prejudices when his secrets are revealed. Genesis and future books Moore said he wrote the book after being upset by a Marvel Comic. In the 2005 \\"Enemy of the State\\" storyline, the gay character Northstar is killed by Wolverine (while the latter is brainwashed by The Hand).Wolverine (vol. 3) #25. Marvel Comics. Moore believed that having one of Marvel's biggest superheroes murder its most prominent gay character sent the wrong message to readers.https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/03/books/03moor.html George Gene Gustines, \\"A Novelist‚Äôs Superhero Is Out to Right Wrongs,\\" New York Times, September 3, 2007.

His growing awareness of the poor treatment of LGBTQ superhero characters led him to write Hero to present a more positive side. Critical reception Reviews of Hero have been mainly positive. People magazine was unequivocal in its praise for the book. It called the novel compelling, funny, and touching, and the characters enigmatic.\\"Hero by Perry Moore.\\" People. September 10, 2007. The Times (London) review on the publication of the UK edition was also largely positive. \\"Thom is devoid of the grossly stereotypical attributes that comic books link to their gay characters' sexual preference\\" and \\"The book is entertaining, though in contrast to its rich core tackling deep social issues, the writing is light...\\"Nir, Sarah Maslin. \\"Meet Perry Moore, caped crusader for gay superheroes.\\" The Times. May 2, 2008. The Advocate similarly praised the book. The gay newsmagazine applauded Moore's original superhero characters and Moore's decision to avoid making Thom Creed an outcast. The review also pointed to wittily-written descriptions of Thom masturbating to Internet porn, coming out to his father, and his first kiss. \\"But otherwise his play-by-play writing style can seem a bit choppy, especially in the story's more poignant moments,\\" the review noted. Nevertheless, \\"Hero is a quick, at times shallow, but satisfying novel, the kind we all wanted while growing up and hopefully the first in a new genre of young adult literature.\\"Steven Gaughan, \\"Gay Teen to the Rescue,\\" The Advocate, August 15, 2007.

September 7, 2007. Accessed 2011-10-22. Publishers Weekly applauded the book for its subject matter and for expanding the genre of gay literature into superhero fantasy. But ultimately, the review noted, \\"the novel misses its mark, with an abundance of two-dimensional characters and contrived situations. ...

Sequels, and film and television adaptations Moore told The New York Times in 2007 that he planned a series of book sequels featuring Thom Creed. There were many reports that the book might be adapted for other media. Moore said in 2007 that a motion picture adaptation was in the early stages. Moore announced in May 2008 that the book might be made into a television program. \\"It looks like we‚Äôre going to do a TV series.

The show was to be executive produced by Lee and Gil Champion (the president of POW Entertainment, a company co-founded and co-owned by Lee), while Moore would co-produce and serve as screenwriter.

The stone arch was removed in 1850 to a site in Church Street, Dumbarton, and moved again in 1907 to its present location in the grounds of the town's registry office, beside the railway station.

He is a Distinguished Professor of political science at the University of California, Davis. He is also an Affiliated Professor at the University of Haifa. Shugart specializes in electoral systems, party systems, and the design of political institutions, primarily through empirical studies of political systems across large numbers of countries. Shugart is also an orchardist, and runs the Fruits and Votes blog on electoral systems and fruit growing. Education and positions Shugart attended the University of California, Irvine, where he graduated with a B.A. degree in political science in 1983. He continued to study political science at the University of California, Irvine, obtaining an M.A. degree in 1985 and a Ph.D. in 1988. In 1989, Shugart became a professor in the Department of Political Science and School of International Relations and Pacific Studies at The University of California, San Diego. In 2013, he moved to The University of California, Davis. In June 2016, Shugart became an Affiliated Professor at the University of Haifa, and in 2018 he was made a Distinguished Professor at The University of California, Davis. He has held temporary or visiting positions at several universities in the United States, Europe, Australia, and Israel. Research In addition to peer-reviewed journal articles and chapters in edited volumes, Shugart has been an author or editor of numerous books. His first book, coauthored with Rein Taagepera, was Seats and Votes: The Effects and Determinants of Electoral Systems, published in 1989. The book is an empirical study of electoral systems and electoral rules, which determine how votes cast in an election are converted into seats in a legislature. One of the central variables that Taagepera and Shugart study is electoral district magnitude and its effects; they demonstrate that in plurality voting systems a larger district magnitude means a less proportional legislature, whereas in proportional voting systems a larger district magnitude means a more proportional legislature. They study this proportionality by developing a notion of the discrepancy between the proportionality of the system and perfect proportionality, noting that no electoral system can be perfectly proportional. Seats and votes presents comparisons between specific cases, including detailed discussions of New Zealand, Finland, and Japan, as well as general principles, such as the observation that the number of members in the lower house of a legislature tends to resemble the cube root of the total population. Seats and Votes has been identified as one of the first systematic empirical studies of electoral systems, building on earlier work by Maurice Duverger, Douglas W. Rae, and Arend Lijphart. In 2017, Shugart and Taagepera coauthored a second book, Votes from Seats: Logical Models of Electoral Systems. In Votes from Seats, Shugart and Taagepera again study of the relationship between electoral systems and party systems, this time presenting four power laws which use the size of a country's assembly and the magnitude of its districts to predict core features of its party system. In 1992, Shugart and John M. Carey published the book Presidents and Assemblies: Constitutional Design and Electoral Dynamics. Presidents and Assemblies is a large-scale study of presidential and parliamentary government types, as well as the plethora of hybrid regimes that combine features of each. James L. Sundquist wrote that Presidents and Assemblies is \\"an encyclopedic, yet concise, compilation of the major structural variations in governments all over the world\\". Shugart and Carey evaluate the stability of presidential and parliamentary systems, in light of the argument by analysts of the third wave of democratization like Juan Linz that presidential systems are inherently less stable than parliamentary systems; to the contrary, Shugart and Carey show that presidential systems have not broken down more often than parliamentary systems. Related to their focus on hybrid regimes, Shugart and Carey study the variation that exists within presidential regime types, and the relationship between these institutional decisions and the fragmentation of the country's party system as well as the potential for conflict between its executive and legislature. Translations of chapters from Presidents and Assemblies have been published in languages including Italian, Russian, Polish, and Portuguese. Shugart and his coauthor David J. Samuels also examined executive-legislative relations in detail in their 2010 book Presidents, Parties, and Prime Ministers: How the Separation of Powers Affects Party Organization and Behavior, in which they further studied the effects of institutional rules on competition between parties. In addition to authoring books, Shugart has edited several volumes: Presidentialism and Democracy in Latin America (2017, with Scott Mainwaring), Mixed-Member Electoral Systems: The Best of Both Worlds? (2001, with Martin P. Wattenberg), and The Oxford Handbook of Electoral Systems (2018, with Erik Herron and Robert Pekkanen). He was also an author of the 2014 book A Different Democracy: A Systematic Comparison of the American System with Thirty Other Democracies with Steven L. Taylor, Arend Lijphart, and Bernard Grofman. Shugart has twice received the George H. Hallett Award, which is given by the Representation and Electoral Systems Section of the American Political Science Association to \\"the author of a book published at least ten years ago that has made a lasting contribution to the literature on representation and electoral systems\\". In 1999, Shugart and Rein Taagepera were given the Hallett Award for their 1989 book Seats and Votes: The Effects and Determinants of Electoral Systems. In 2014, Shugart again won the Hallett Award for his 1992 book Presidents and Assemblies: Constitutional Design and Electoral Dynamics, co-authored with John M. Carey. Shugart and Taagepera also won a 2018 Choice outstanding academic title award for Votes from Seats. Since 2005, Shugart has run the blog Fruits and Votes, which covers both voting systems and fruit growing, and has been recommended by FairVote for its election analysis. Selected awards *George H.

It runs for from an intersection with NY 415 in the village of Cohocton to a junction with NY 21 in the town of Cohocton. NY 371 follows the Cohocton River and the main line of the B&H; Rail Corporation for virtually its entire length. Most of the route passes through rural areas located inside of a valley surrounding the river. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, what is now NY 371 was designated as part of NY 21 while NY 371 was assigned to modern NY 21 between Wayland and Loon Lake. NY 21 was realigned to bypass Cohocton via Wayland while NY 371 was reassigned to NY 21's former routing from Loon Lake to North Cohocton. The route was cut back to its current southern terminus in 1949. Route description NY 371 southbound from NY 21 in North Cohocton NY 371 begins at an intersection with NY 415 in the center of the village of Cohocton, located in a valley surrounding the Cohocton River. At this junction, southbound traffic continuing straight will proceed onto NY 415 south while NY 415 north is accessed by way of a right-hand turn. The route heads northeastward from NY 415 as a two-lane highway, leaving Cohocton's central business district for a more residential area of the small village. After just one block, the homes give way to open, undeveloped areas as NY 371 crosses over the Cohocton River and exits the village limits. Outside of the village, NY 371 heads in a generally northeasterly direction through the town of Cohocton, following the Cohocton River valley through sparsely populated areas of the town. Over the next , the route closely parallels the river and the main line of the B&H; Rail Corporation as it serves a series of farms and a small hamlet known as Kirkwood. At Atlanta, a hamlet about west of NY 371, the river valley turns west toward Wayland. While the B&H; line curves westward to follow the valley, NY 371 continues north to the smaller community of North Cohocton, where it passes a block of homes before ending at a junction with NY 21\\\\. Like NY 415 in Cohocton, NY 21 is straight (compass north) ahead while NY 21 south is reached by turning left (compass west). History The roadway linking the village of Cohocton to the hamlet of North Cohocton was originally designated as part of Route 14, an unsigned legislative route, by the New York State Legislature in 1908. When the first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924, the Cohocton‚ÄìNorth Cohocton route was not given a designation; however, it did become part of NY 52 by 1926. When it was first assigned, NY 52 passed through Cohocton on its way from Wayland to North Cohocton. NY 52 was rerouted later in the decade to bypass Cohocton to the north on what is now NY 21. The road from Cohocton to North Cohocton became part of a signed route once more‚Äîthis time, NY 21‚Äîas part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. NY 21 entered Loon Lake, a hamlet southwest of Cohocton, from the south as it does today; however, it initially exited it to the east via Loon Lake Road. It followed the length of Loon Lake Road east to Cohocton, from where it traveled north along the 1926-era routing of NY 52 to North Cohocton. NY 21 turned northeast here, following its modern alignment toward Ontario County. At the same time, the piece of modern NY 21 between Loon Lake and NY 2 (modern NY 415) south of Wayland was designated NY 371. The alignments of NY 21 and NY 371 between Loon Lake and North Cohocton were flipped , placing NY 371 on Loon Lake Road and its modern alignment between Cohocton and North Cohocton. NY 371 was truncated on its southern end to Cohocton on January 1, 1949. The former routing of NY 371 along Loon Lake Road from NY 21 to Interstate 390 exit 2 is now maintained by Steuben County as County Route 121 while the segment from I-390 to NY 415 is NY 962D, an unsigned reference route.

The health system is the largest employer in Arizona and one of the largest in the United States with over 50,000 employees. The organization provides emergency and hospital care, hospice, long-term/home care, outpatient surgery, labs, rehabilitation services, pharmacies, and primary care. In early 2018, it reported assets of $11.6 billion and revenues of $7.8 billion for the previous year. Banner Health was created in 1999 through a merger between Lutheran Health Systems, based in North Dakota, and Samaritan Health System, based in Phoenix, Arizona. In 2001, Banner sold its operations in Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Dakota and South Dakota, and made its sole headquarters in Phoenix. Banner also operates a Medicare Advantage insurance plan in the valley referred to as University Care Advantage and an AHCCCS plan referred to as Banner University Family Care. Banner Health has partnered with the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, one of the original three comprehensive cancer centers in the United States established by the National Cancer Act of 1971, and has built a $90 million cancer center in Gilbert, Arizona. History In 1999, two nonprofit entities Samaritan Health System (dating back to 1911) and Lutheran Health Systems (history dating back to 1938) merged, forming Banner Health. At the time the entity operated in 14 states and had around 22,000 employees. In 2005, Banner closed the former Mesa Lutheran hospital and later converted it to office space at a cost of around $100 million. In 2006 Banner Health launched a telemedicine program. The health system determined the telemonitoring saved 34,000 ICU days and close to 2,000 lives in 2013 based on APACHE II predicted length of stay and mortality rates. In October 2006 Banner acquires the assets and staff, including 40 providers of Big Thompson Medical Medical Group in Loveland, Colorado. In 2008, Banner Health selected Nextgen Healthcare as its partner for ambulatory EHR medical records at all of its outpatient facilities. In October 2008, Banner acquired large specialty group \\"Arizona Medical Clinic\\" in the west valley and renamed this entity Banner Arizona Medical Clinic. In August 2012, Banner embarked on a plan to rename and harmonize the names of its acquired medical clinics organized under Banner Medical Group. Clinics were renamed according to specialty across the entire system In February 2014, Banner acquired Casa Grande Medical Center in Casa Grande, AZ In June 2014, the University of Arizona Health Network (UAHN)and Banner Health launched a merger, pending Arizona Board of Regents approval to combine operations The merger finally took place in 2016. The new Banner division, Banner - University Medicine and its employed physician group, Banner - University Medical Group (BUMG) brought Banner Health into the forefront of academic medicine. As part of the deal, the former University of Arizona Medical Center and University of Arizona Medical Center - South Campus, in Tucson, AZ, were renamed Banner ‚Äì University Medical Center Tucson and Banner ‚Äì University Medical Center South, respectively. Banner Good Samaritan hospital in Phoenix was also renamed, to Banner ‚Äì University Medical Center Phoenix, to reflect its new designation as the primary teaching hospital of the University of Arizona College of Medicine ‚Äì Phoenix. To upgrade the aging infrastructure of all of these facilities, Banner Health pledged nearly US$1.5 billion to several major construction projects in Phoenix and Tucson. In 2015, Banner relocated its headquarters from the Banner Good Samaritan Hospital campus (now known as Banner University Medical Center) to a tower at Central and Thomas Roads in Downtown Phoenix, Arizona. In the same year, it signed an agreement with Cerner to move all of its facilities including the clinics formerly on Nextgen to Cerner EHR. The move also includes staff sharing between Banner and Cerner to execute on the implementation. In August 2016, Banner Health acquired the assets and staff of Urgent Care Extra's 32 Arizona urgent care facilities, hoping to grow the urgent care footprint to 50 clinics by 2017. Banner Health fell victim to a cyberattack and data breach that may have put the information of up to three million patients and employees at risk. This led to a class-action lawsuit which was settled in 2020. Note: Page 3 is found in a separate clipping. According to HIPAA Journal, this breach was the largest of any health care concern in 2016. In April 2018, Banner submitted to an $18 million fine relating to billing and operational abnormalities relating to billing government programs for services In June 2018, the company completed the transition of the Tucson medical facilities conversion from Epic Systems EHR to the EHR used at their other entities, Cerner. The conversion was noted as challenging for the staff involved and cost approximately US$45 million. In July 2020, Wyoming Medical Center agreed to join Banner Health. Locations The University of Arizona Cancer Center In Tucson, AZ =Banner - University Medical Center Phoenix= Banner - University Medical Center Phoenix (formerly Banner Good Samaritan Medical Center, or \\"Good Sam\\") is located immediately northeast of downtown Phoenix and is one of the flagship facilities of Banner Health. It is one of three university hospitals operated by Banner Health in conjunction with the University of Arizona Colleges of Medicine in Phoenix and Tucson, with Banner - University Medical Center Tucson and Banner - University Medical Center South (both in Tucson, AZ) being the other two such facilities.  History  Lulu Clifton, a Deaconess in the Methodist Church from Nebraska, arrived in Phoenix in 1900, against her doctor's advice, to recover from tuberculosis. As she recovered, Clifton saw a need for a hospital in the growing desert town. Clifton, with the help of other prominent Methodists, founded the Arizona Deaconess Hospital in 1911 in a rented apartment building in downtown Phoenix and started a nurse training program. In 1917, the group acquired land on McDowell Road and 10th Street (a remote area of rural Phoenix at the time) for a permanent hospital structure which, after construction was delayed during World War I, opened to the public in 1923. The modern complex sits on the site to this day. The hospital's name was changed to Good Samaritan Hospital in 1928. In 1978, Good Samaritan broke ground for a 12-story, 720 bed hospital tower which opened in 1982. This tower, designed by noted Chicago architect Bertrand Goldberg (best known for his iconic Marina City complex), featured his signature ultra-modern architecture, making the tower a Phoenix architectural icon. The expansion also made Good Samaritan the largest hospital in Arizona to date. New construction Banner will invest nearly $1 billion in new clinics and hospital towers in Tucson and Phoenix. Those projects include a $179 million emergency department scheduled to open July 2017, a $239 million patient tower set to open in late 2018, and a $50 million clinical space near the existing BUMCP facility. The 700,000-sq.-ft. Emergency Department and patient tower expansion project includes a three- story podium that accommodates the emergency department relocation, new observation space on the first floor, and new operating rooms and administration on the second floor. The 13-story patient tower will house 256 patient beds as well as two shell floors for future build-out.  Teaching  The medical center hosts 3rd and 4th year medical students from its major affiliated medical school, the University of Arizona College of Medicine - Phoenix. It is also home to several residency training programs sponsored by the College of Medicine. These include Obstetrics and Gynecology, Internal Medicine, General Surgery, Psychiatry, Orthopaedic Surgery, Family Medicine, Neurology, Medicine/Pediatrics, and Oral Maxillofacial Surgery. A number of fellowship programs are also sponsored. In total, over 300 residents and fellows are based at the facility. = Banner MD Anderson Cancer Center = Banner Health partnered with The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (based at Texas Medical Center in Houston), consistently one of the two highest-ranked cancer centers by U.S. News & World Report, to build a $100 million cancer center in Gilbert, Arizona at Banner Gateway Medical Center. This facility opened in 2011 and offers outpatient services, including radiation treatment, diagnostic imaging, infusion therapy, cancer-specific clinics and support services. Banner Gateway provides inpatient care such as surgery, interventional radiology, and stem cell transplantation. In March 2014, a 103,000 square feet, $62 million expansion was completed to increase clinic space, infusion bays and radiation oncology facilities. Patients at Banner MD Anderson Cancer Center receive care based on the same protocols and practice standards provided at MD Anderson and benefit from integration with MD Anderson specialists in Houston. The new facilities were designed in collaboration with MD Anderson experts, ensuring state of the art equipment and treatment capabilities are in place. MD Anderson provides clinical direction for the cancer center which is the broadest extension of its services outside Houston. = Location List = Banner Health operates 28 hospitals, mostly in the Western United States.

The software was designed with the audience of clinical and basic science researchers in mind, and emphasis has been placed on having a user-friendly interface and maintaining a limited feature set to prevent feature creep. ITK-SNAP is most frequently used to work with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) and computed tomography (CT) data sets. Features The purpose of the tool is to make it easy for researchers to delineate anatomical structures and regions of interest in imaging data. The set of features is kept to a minimum. The main features of the program are ; Image navigation: three orthogonal cut planes through the image volume are shown at all times. The cut planes are linked by a common cursor, so that moving the cursor in one cut plane updates the other cut planes. The cursor is moved by dragging the mouse over the cut planes, making for smooth navigation. The linked cursor also works across ITK- SNAP sessions, making it possible to navigate multimodality imaging data (e.g., two MRI scans of a subject from a single session). ; Manual segmentation : ITK-SNAP provides tools for manual delineation of anatomical structures in images. Labeling can take place in all three orthogonal cut planes and results can be visualized as a three-dimensional rendering. This makes it easier to ensure that the segmentation maintains reasonable shape in 3D. ; Automatic segmentation: ITK-SNAP provides automatic functionality segmentation using the level-set method. This makes it possible to segment structures that appear somewhat homogeneous in medical images using very little human interaction. For example, the lateral ventricles in MRI can be segmented reliably, as can some types of tumors in CT and MRI. ITK-SNAP is open-source software distributed under the GNU General Public License. It is written in C++ and it leverages the Insight Segmentation and Registration Toolkit (ITK) library. ITK-SNAP can read and write a variety of medical image formats, including DICOM, NIfTI, and Mayo Analyze. It also offers limited support for multi-component (e.g., diffusion tensor imaging) and multi-variate imaging data. Applications ITK-SNAP has been applied in the following areas * Craniofacial pathologies and anatomical studies **KCOT ** Ameloblastoma ** Cysts ** Condyle Volumes * Carotid artery segmentation *Diffusion MRI Analysis * Target definition for cancer radiotherapy ** lung cancer radiotherapy * Prenatal Image Analysis ** Diagnosis of spina bifida * Virtual reality in Medicine * Orthodontics * Brain morphometry **Corpus callosum and ventricle analysis in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome ** Hippocampus size and shape measurement in neurodegenerative disorders. **Human brain tumors (e.g., Meningioma)https://journals.lww.com/jcraniofacialsurgery/Fulltext/2019/12000/Does_Meningioma_Volume_Correlate_With_Clinical.144.aspx References External links * Main ITK-SNAP website (downloads, bugs, mailing lists) * ITK-SNAP on SourceForge Category:Medical software Category:Free health care software Category:Free bioimaging software Category:Free DICOM software ","title":"ITK-SNAP"},{"id":"13697816","text":"Dateline Diamonds is a 1965 British music-film.

LeDuc House, also known as the LeDuc Historic Estate, located at 1629 Vermillion Street in Hastings, Minnesota, United States, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It was built over several years, and completed in 1865, by William G. LeDuc who came to Minnesota in 1850 from Ohio. He was an attorney who represented a party to a suit involving Vermillion Falls, southeast of the homesite. As payment for his services, Le Duc received the land where he built his house. LeDuc was a Civil War veteran and U.S. Commissioner of Agriculture under President Hayes (1877-1881). The estate is an unusually complete example of the Carpenter Gothic style of Andrew Jackson Downing, a pioneer in American landscape architecture. William, and his wife Mary, used Downing's book, Cottage Residences, as inspiration for their home (Downing himself had died in 1852). The home was the first property to be acquired by the Minnesota Historical Society in the late 1950s but sat empty until 2005, when it was acquired by the City of Hastings. The Dakota County Historical Society partnered with the city to provide programing and interpretative services. $1.2 million was raised to restore the home and grounds to their former glory. Construction on the LeDuc house began in 1862 and was completed in 1866. Following LeDuc's service as Quartermaster in the Civil War, the family moved into the unfinished home in August, 1865. In March, 1865 he had been brevetted a brigadier general for ‚Äúefficiency, intelligence and zeal in the discharge of his duties‚Äù. William G. LeDuc came to St. Paul, Minnesota Territory in 1850 from Ohio to open a book store and law office. In 1854 he purchased a quarter share in the town of Hastings from Alexander Faribault. In 1856, he and his wife Mary Bronson LeDuc, with their two daughters moved downriver to Hastings, where they had also acquired two wheat farms and 160 acres with a small grist mill on the falls of the Vermillion River. It was on this property that William and Mary decided to build their dream home. They chose a Gothic Revival home featured in Andrew Jackson Downing's 1842 book Cottage Residences. Downing was a landscape architect and author, whose reputation as a horticulturist was widespread. He inspired Americans to surround their homes with the beauty of nature and encouraged the use of good design even in planning farmsteads. William and Mary chose three Downing designs for their rural home site; their residence, Carriage Barn and Ice House. The estate is an unusually complete example of the Gothic Revival style of Andrew Jackson Downing. Carroll Simmons, a friend of the LeDuc grandchildren, purchased the home in 1940 for his antique business. In 1958 he donated the home and outbuildings with 4 acres of land to the Minnesota Historical Society, with the agreement that he would continue using it for his antique business until he retired, which wasn‚Äôt until 1986. Between 1986 and 2003 the future of the property was uncertain. Although it was the first property acquired by MHS, they had opened other house museums by the time they took possession. Needed repairs were done on the house and carriage barn, but the property stood empty. Citizen groups actively sought out ways to fulfill Carroll Simmons‚Äô vision of having the LeDuc house open to the public. In 2002 the Minnesota Legislature apportioned 1.2 million dollars in bonding funds for MHS to preserve the house and bring it up to current building codes. Agreements were executed between the Minnesota Historical Society, the City of Hastings and the Dakota Country Historical Society, which resulted in city ownership and DCHS management of the site. The site opened for tours on May 22, 2005. June 24, 2005, the Society deaccessioned the LeDuc House to the City of Hastings. As part of the agreement, the Society transferred $604,000 of net assets provided by Carroll Simmons for endowment, repairs and maintenance of the LeDuc House.

The council, commonly known on campus as the SSC, considers matters in which the interests, rights, or responsibilities of students are involved and brings concerns to the attention of the NYU administration and to the University Senate.  Structure  Student government at NYU begins at the school level. Each school or college has its own student council. Student council presidents come together with the elected and appointed Student Senators from each school to form the SSC's largest committee, University Committee on Student Life, which makes recommendations to the Student Senators Council. The SSC is made up of 23 Student Senators elected by the students of the various schools and colleges of NYU and 12 Student Senators appointed at- large by the Executive Committee of the University Senate with the advice and consent of the elected Student Senators. The executive committee of the SSC and UCSL consists of the SSC Vice Chairperson, the UCSL Vice Chairperson, the Global Vice Chairperson, and the SSC/UCSL Chairperson elected. The executive committee is elected by the 23 elected Student Senators for a one-year term at the last SSC meeting of the academic year. In 2017, as directed by student body president Juan Calero, the Student Senators Council was vastly reformed along with the rest of NYU's student governance system. The chief body would now become the Student Government Assembly (SGA), open to the public and tasked with primary deliberations of the broader student body. Additionally, a Presidents Council was created to represent the particular interests of NYU's various individual school presidents, who were particularly less powerful under the former system. The SSC still exists, although it was removed from its position as chief deliberative body into a more parallel role with the newly minted Presidents Council.  Notable Events  During the Fall of 2001, SSC's UCSL coordinated a \\"We Stand Together\\" campaign that raised over $52,000 to benefit families of fallen firefighters from September 11, 2001 attacks. The SSC was also involved in the Graduate Student Organizing Committee unionization in 2001 and subsequent strike in 2005. On November 3, 2005 the University Senate, based on a recommendation from the SSC's UCSL, passed a resolution for a campus-wide ban on the sale of products produced by the Coca- Cola Company. This ban was subsequently lifted in Spring 2009.

The river forms as Calamba's northern boundary with Cabuyao. The river is one of 21 major tributaries of Laguna de Bay. Hydrology The main source of the San Cristobal River is Mount Sungay, the highest mountain of Cavite province, where the main stem and its tributaries drain the northern and eastern side of the mountain.\\"Mount Sungay\\".

The river system of San Cristobal from Mount Sungay, is connected to the Matang Tubig located in Casile and Canlubang. Water quality Along with the San Juan River, the two rivers act as natural drainage systems by receiving and conveying Calamba's (and Cabuyao's for San Cristobal) liquid wastes and storm surface runoff to the nearby Laguna de Bay. Both rivers are very polluted as a result, thus, affecting the water quality of the lake as well. Although a 1991 study cited the San Pedro River and Morong River as the sources of eutrophication-causing minerals in Laguna de Bay, the Laguna Lake Development Authority (LLDA) has noted that more recent deterioration of the San Cristobal River in Calamba have made it one of the lake's major sources of nutrient loading. The LLDA's conservation efforts for the major tributaries and watersheds of Laguna de Bay have led to the creation of the Laguna de Bay River Basin Councils, of which the San Cristobal River Enhancement Defenders (SACRED) is particularly tasked with conservation of the San Cristobal.

It is part of verification and validation of numerical models. The process The process is conducted by first choosing the domain in which data is presented. The domains used include time domain, frequency domain, modal domain, and time-frequency domain. The second step is to determine which parts of the initial models are thought to have been modeled incorrectly. The third task is to formulate a function which has the parameters that are expected to be design variables, and which represents the distance between the measured data and the finite element model predicted data. The fourth step is to implement the optimization method to identify parameters that minimize this function. In most cases, a gradient-based optimization strategy will be used. For nonlinear analysis, more specific methods like response surface modeling, particle swarm optimization, Monte Carlo optimization, and genetic algorithms can be used. Recently, finite element model updating has been conducted using Bayesian statistics which gives a probabilistic interpretation of model updating.

Olive Tilford Dargan (January 11, 1869 ‚Äì January 22, 1968) was a writer and a poet. Her early works revolved around mountain poetry. Her works like: The Cycle's Rim, Lute and Furrow, Highland Annals were inspired from her love of mountains and nature. Later in her career, she published novels that focuses on racism, sexism, and fascism through her feminist visions of political activism and romanticism. Her most notable works were Call Home the Heart and A Stone Came Rolling which were written as part of her Gastonia novels.  Early life  Olive Tilford Dargan was born on January 11, 1869 on a farm in Grayson County, Kentucky. She moved to the southern Ozarks with her parents Elisha Frances Tilford & Rebecca (Day) Tilford, around age eleven and started her work in elementary education. She became a teaching assistant at her Parents school until the time that she graduated. Dargan attended Peabody Teacher's College and later Radcliffe College where she met her husband Pegram Dargan, who was a senior at Harvard and a poet. She taught in Arkansas, Missouri, Texas and Canada. In 1898 she married Pegram Dargan. During her time as a writer, Tilford published a number of novels, dramas, and poetry.Booker, Keith M. 2005 Encyclopedia of Literature and Politics: Censorship, Revolution, and Writing, Volume I: A-G‚Äù Greenwood Publishing Group, March 1, 2015 Print Her husband drowned near the coast of Cuba in 1915 and she returned to North Carolina.

In WarCraft III he played as the Human race and in StarCraft he played as Protoss. he was signed to the top esports team in the United Kingdom, Four-Kings, until November 7, 2007, when he decided not to renew his contract for unspecified reasons. He later explained in an interview that the dissatisfying results of the Four Kings team were the reason for his departure. After much speculation, Merlo unexpectedly joined the team Mousesports on December 1, 2007.ToD joins up with Mousesports Gosu Gamers He is one of the most successful Warcraft III players ever, holding among other achievements first places at the World e-Sports Games, Blizzard Worldwide Invitational and Cyberathlete Professional League competitions. He is also a World Cyber Games silver and bronze medalist. He was recognized as the Warcraft III player of 2007. Yoan recently gave an interview with GOMTV.net, an e-sports organization based in Seoul, Korea. During the interview, he hinted that his e-sports career is not over, and that has begun to compete in Starcraft 2, in which he has achieved moderate success, winning some small tournaments and qualifying for World Cyber Games 2011. As of July 2014, Merlo's winnings from tournaments exceed US$160,000. Player Biography =Warcraft III career= Rise in France (2002-2003) Prior to playing Warcraft III Yoan played such games as Starcraft: Brood War and Counter-Strike, he cites twofold Starcraft World Cyber Games champion Lim \\"BoxeR\\" Yo-hwan as the reason he plays the Human race.Interview with Yoan Merlo on WCReplays.com http://www.wcreplays.com/interviews.php?get=2 He started high level competitive Warcraft III after joining French based ArmaTeam, at the time a high level competitive gaming team sponsored by Intel. While representing the team he took fourth place at the 2003 Electronic Sports World Cup. Following this strong result he joined SK Gaming around August 2003SK Gaming newspost about Yoan Merlo's departure http://www.sk-gaming.com/news/4445/ as ArmaTeam was facing internal problems at the time. Around this time he was competing in tournaments around the globe such as those organized by the Cyberathlete Professional League and Cyber X Games, something which he continues to do until today. After six months he returned to ArmaTeam because he preferred to compete with his friends in Paris rather than the globally diverse members of SK Gaming. A year in South-Korea (2004-2005) Several months after re- joining ArmaTeam he was asked to join the European-based Warcraft III squad of the United Kingdom-based team Four Kings in order to stay in and compete in the \\"mecca\\" of professional gaming, South Korea. On September 16, 2004[WCReplays article about Four Kings trip prior to Merlo joining http://www.wcreplays.com/articles.php?get=105] the team consisting of Manuel Schenkhuizen, Dae Hui Cho, Sebastian \\"FuRy\\" Pesic and Ivica \\"Zeus[19]\\" Markovic took residence in Seoul and Merlo joined several televised competitions such as those hosted by Ongamenet and MBCGame. He was the most successful Four Kings player in these televised leagues. His reputation grew strongly during his time in the country, Merlo took third place at the 2004 World Cyber Games and second place at the 2005 Samsung European Championships and would stay in South-Korea for almost a full year competing in two seasons of the World e-Sports Games following the closing of the before mentioned televised leagues. At this time the Warcraft III squad of Four Kings became known as the world's premier competitive Warcraft III team, going undefeated in the Warcraft 3 Champions League for over a full season and being recognized as the eSport Team of the year in the 2005 eSports Awards. Return to France (2005-2006) Upon returning to France in late 2005, he finished the 2005 season by qualifying for and competing in the World Cyber Games 2005 where he took fourth place. The following year he would once again take second place at the Samsung European Championship before embarking on a one-month tournament in Hangzhou, China: the Master edition of the World e-Sports Games. Merlo would surprise many by taking home the first place prize of US$31,000, at the time the biggest prize ever awarded for a Warcraft III competition. He would continue to show strong results throughout the season as he took second places at major tournaments in China such as the World e-Sports Festival and KODE5. He finished the year by taking second place at the World Cyber Games 2006, losing to Li \\"Sky\\" Xiaofeng in the finals. Move to China (2006-2007) China was significantly growing at this time as an important country for Warcraft III competitions and in 2006 Merlo was frequently visiting tournaments there as well as using the country as grounds to train. In September 2006 he took up permanent residence in the country. He resided in Beijing, China together with Swedish professional gamer Kim \\"SaSe\\" Hammar, which allowed them to train in China as well as have an easier time competing in the country's many competitions. His successes still mainly came from international competition however. In early 2007 he once again took second place at the Samsung European Championship as well as first place in the Electronic Sports League's Extreme Masters. He would win one of the biggest tournaments of the year in the Blizzard Worldwide Invitational and also quite notably declined to compete in several competitions. He declined to participate in the Electronic Sports World Cup because he would have to travel between China and France twice in order to qualify. He also declined to participate in the World e-Sports Games eStars in Seoul, South Korea. Before agreeing to compete, he specified two conditions, which he claimed were agreed to but not met when he arrived to compete. Claiming to be pressured into a response after this apparent miscommunication, he declined to participate, dissatisfied with the organisation of the tournament, a feat which received both criticism for his demanding nature yet also praise for not accepting the false promises of the tournament organisers. He was recognized as the player of the year 2007. =Starcraft II= Wings of Liberty Yoan began playing StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty during its beta but wouldn't officially switch to the game until late 2010. His playstyle relies on a strong micromanagement, inherited from his Warcraft III experience. He joined Millenium on January 9, 2011.\\"ToD joins Millenium\\". Millenium.org. January 9th 2011.

Despite showing an impressive level in the group stage, with a victory against ThorZaIN, ToD was quickly eliminated in the playoffs, after encountering the future winner HuK and SaSe. In July, ToD successfully got the French spot for World Cyber Games 2011, after his victories against Adelscott and SarenS at the WCG Qualifiers France.

In September, he was invited to SCAN Invitational 1 where he knocked-out Strelok and TLO in order to reach the final against his former teammate Stephano, whom he couldn't defeat, therefore taking the second place of the tournament. Two weeks later, ToD participated in the Samsung European Championship 2011 in Poland. He managed again to reach the final against a Zerg player, this time being Nerchio, and was able to defeat him in a tied series. The next week, ToD was back in France in order to compete in the first event of French Master Series 2011 - 2012, the PxL-Lan 31. Seen as the favorite of the event by the commentators, thanks to the non-attendance of most of the best French players, he made a clean run to the finals, and swept an unexpected Kamikaze to claim the win of the tournament. ToD spent the last months of 2011 in South Korea, where he attended World Cyber Games 2011 in December. His run in this event was short- lived, with a 1‚Äì5 record in the group stage which resulted in ToD ending up at the last place of his group.

Construction was completed soon after 1300, when Hall was rapidly becoming the center of Tyrolean commerce and salt mining. The building was originally erected to protect the salt mines, the shipping industry, the bridge across the river Inn and the old Roman Road. The castle's mint was established by Sigismund, Archduke of Austria in 1477. The first dollar-size silver coin was struck in 1486: the Guldengroschen. When Ferdinand II, Archduke of Austria had the old mint transferred from the Castle of Sparberegg to Hasegg in 1567, Hall experienced a decisive upswing. Between 1748 and 1768, Hasegg Castle became universally famous for its minting of silver Thalers of which it produced over 17 million specimens. The Thaler, a silver coin used throughout Europe for almost four hundred years, sees its name live on in various currencies as the \\"dollar\\" or \\"tolar\\". The mint ceased production in 1806 due to the Napoleonic Wars and the increasing lack of local silver resources. The mint in Hasegg Castle is a museum now, and open to the general public. Demonstrations of historical minting techniques are given from time to time. The castle itself is an example of early Gothic era Tirolean fortress architecture. The pointed roof of the mint tower is of heavily tarnished copper.

While in Madrid he also worked as assistant conductor to Oscar Gershensohn and pursued graduate studies in conducting and musicology. After winning the prestigious Barri√© de la Maza Foundation Scholarship, he went on to study composition at the Peabody Institute in Baltimore, and afterwards obtained his doctorate from the University of Maryland, College Park, where he was on a full Fellowship.Rosa Maria Fernandez, ‚ÄúLa composici√≥n contempor√°nea gallega en Estados Unidos.

Gove was born on July 6, 1867, in Whitefield, New Hampshire, to George Sullivan and Maria Clark Gove. After her education at MIT and Woman's Medical College of New York Infirmary, from which she graduated in 1892, Gove served for a year in the New York Infant Asylum. In 1893 she came to the State Normal and Industrial School (now UNCG). Gove was only the third woman to receive a medical license in the state of North Carolina. She remained at the school as resident physician, professor of hygiene, and director of the Department of Health until her retirement in 1937. The original campus infirmary that was built in 1911 was named in Gove's honor. The infirmary built in 1953 to replace the original infirmary was also named the Gove Infirmary. In September 1970, the building was officially named the Anna M. Gove Student Health Center, the name it retains today. Fond of travel, Gove visited many parts of the world. In 1896-1897 and again in 1913‚Äì1914, she visited Vienna for postgraduate study. During World War I, she served with the Red Cross in the Children's Relief Division in Marseilles and Ard√®che and with the Smith College Relief Unit. In 1926-1927 she took a leave of absence from the college and traveled extensively in the Orient. She also spent many summers in study and clinical work in the United States at Cornell, Chicago, New York City and Michigan. Gove died in Greensboro on January 28, 1948.

() is an Italian luxury goods company, with headquarters in Florence, Italy. It specializes in shoes, leather goods, Swiss-made timepieces, and ready-to-wear for men and women. The company licences eyewear and watches. It is the parent company of the Ferragamo Group which employs about 4,000 persons and maintains a network of over 654 mono- brand stores, and it runs operations in Italy and worldwide. History Palazzo Spini Feroni: The headquarters of Salvatore Ferragamo S.p.A. in Florence Salvatore Ferragamo emigrated from southern Italy to the US, first to Boston and then California in 1914. He opened the Hollywood Boot Shop in 1923 and made shoes for movie stars such as Joan Crawford and Gloria Swanson, as well as for films such as Cecil B. DeMille's feature film The Ten Commandments. He returned to Italy and set up a shoe shop in Florence in 1927. The current shoemaking company regards 1928 as the date of its foundation, however, and it therefore celebrated its 80th anniversary in 2008. Salvatore Ferragamo filed for bankruptcy in 1933, during the Great Depression, but by 1938 he was in a position to buy the Palazzo Spini Feroni, one of the great palaces of Florence. This houses the company's flagship store and a museum dedicated to Ferragamo's life and work. The company flourished after World War II, expanding the workforce to 700 craftsmen producing 350 pairs of handmade shoes a day. After Salvatore's death in 1960, his widow Wanda took over the running of the business and expanded its operations to include eyewear, perfume, belts, scarves, bags, watches, and a ready to wear clothing line. 248x248px The company's majority owners remain the Ferragamo family, which in November 2006 included Salvatore's widow Wanda, five children, 23 grandchildren and other relatives. There is a rule that only three members of the family can work at the company, prompting fierce competition. To ease these tensions, in September 2006, the family announced a plan to float 48% of the company on the stock market, and since October 2006 Michele Norsa has served as managing and general director. However, as of January 2008, this plan may be put on hold in the midst of the downturn in the financial market. If the listing on the stock market proceeds, the fund will be directed primarily towards building its positions in China. The company is holding its 80th birthday exhibition in Shanghai. In 2011 the company was listed on the stock exchange. On August 2, 2016 Eraldo Poletto was appointed as new CEO of the group. On March 8, 2017 conclusion of the relation with Poletto granted interim management powers to the Chairman, Ferruccio Ferragamo. On July 31, 2018 Micaela le Divelec is appointed as new CEO of the group. Innovations Throughout its history, the company has been known for innovative designs and use of materials. Such ingenuity goes back to Salvatore's time in California, when he studied anatomy to make shoes which were more comfortable. Notable innovations include the wedge heel, the shell-shaped sole, the ‚Äòinvisible‚Äô sandal, metal heels and soles, the 18-carat gold sandal, the sock-shoe, sculpture heels, and the gloved arch shoe created for the Maharani of Cooch Behar in 1938. Metal-reinforced stiletto heels were made famous by Marilyn Monroe. The company is also known for the ‚ÄòGancini‚Äô decoration, the ‚ÄòVara‚Äô patent ballet pump, the Salvatore bag and the use of patchwork. It makes also eyewear and watches in partnership with Marchon and Timex Group. It started adding NFC tags to their products in 2014 to fight counterfeits. Clients Salvatore worked with film stars and celebrities from his earliest days in Hollywood. Clients over the years included Audrey Hepburn, Sophia Loren and Greta Garbo, as well as Andy Warhol], Grace Mugabe and Diana, Princess of Wales.

Seventy years later Margaret and her husband, Donnel Shaw Holt, President and CEO of Cannon Mills, donated a collection of original art by North Carolina artists to the Gaston County Public Library in memory of her father. Margaret herself, in addition to compiling the research on the Chinqua Penn Plantation Reidsville chamber included in these papers, was a well-respected artist, and was included in the thirteenth through seventeenth editions of Who's Who in American Art.

All in all E-CO owns, operates wholly and partially, more than 70 hydroelectric power plants, including the third largest in Norway, Aurland 1. E-CO is also the largest owner of the √òvre Otta construction, that is one of the most extensive in Norway in later years.E-CO Energi - Ren verdiskaping (E-CO) History Christiania Elektricitetesv√¶rk was founded in 1892, with Hammeren power plant in Maridalen in Oslo opening a few years later. The hydro power production increased considerably from the 1920s until 1989 under the name Oslo Lysverker, including the construction of the power plants in Hallingdal and Vinstra in Gudbrandsdalen. In 1991, Oslo Lysverker changed its name to Oslo Energi, and was then split into two divisions: Oslo Energi Nett (later Viken Nett, now part of Hafslund) that operated the power grid and Oslo Energi Holding. The later sold the end-user sale company and thus the brand name in 2001. Thereafter the company changed its name to E-CO Energi. This resulted in a focus on hydro power production, followed by purchases in the Buskerud Kraftproduksjon and Oppland Energi power companies. E-CO has since continued to develop hydro power production in both new and existing regulations.

To allow for the added required dexterity of the left hand, the instrument is held parallel to the body of the player. These instruments are in comparison quite rare because they are all individually crafted primarily made by craftsmen outside of Ukraine. In recent times, they have become quite sought after in Ukraine. They are strung either diatonically (with 31‚Äì36 strings) (8 basses and 23 prystrunky) or chromatically (with 61‚Äì65 strings). Early instruments Kharkiv style bandurist on an instrument made by Kruhovy-Hryhory Bazhul The first standard Kharkiv bandura was designed and manufactured in 1926. This instrument was based on the Starosvitska bandura used by Hnat Khotkevych and was modified somewhat by Leonid Haydamaka. It was intended for use by the bandura students of Hnat Khotkevych at the Kharkiv Mus-dram Institute. The first instrument was made by Kharkiv instrument maker Snehiriov. This instrument had a diatonic tuning with 31 strings. The back was hewn out of maple. In the 1930s a workshop for the serial manufacture of diatonically tuned Kharkiv banduras was established by Leonid Haydamka in Kharkiv and later another by Paliyivetz in Poltava. As a result, most players from Kharkiv and Poltava played on Kharkiv-style instruments. Modifications in the construction were gradually introduced such as glued backs, a mechanism for the rapid retuning of the instrument and a dampening mechanism. Instruments were used by the Kharkiv and Poltava Bandurist Capella and also the Kharkiv Bandurist Quartet and Kharkiv Orchestra of Ukrainian folk instruments. After the war, unfortunately many of the diatonic banduras were remade into chromatic Kyiv-style banduras and were destroyed in the process. Post war development =In the diaspora= Kharkiv bandura manufacture was continued by the Honcharenko brothers who took the standard Kharkiv bandura as the basis for their design. They improved on the acoustics and construction of the instruments adding a chromatic row of strings, placing the tuning pegs on the lower shemstok and improving the retuning mechanism. This instrument became he standard instrument of the Ukrainian Bandurist Chorus. Honcharenko's designs were later taken and improved by the next generation of makers such as William Vetzal and Ken Bloom. =In Ukraine= In Ukraine attempts were made to bring the Kharkiv bandura's construction into line with the developments in the Kyiv concert bandura. These attempts were initially made by Perekop Ivanov and Ivan Skliar and resulted in the development of the Kyiv-Kharkiv bandura which did not have a residing success. In recent times Vasyl Herasymenko in Lviv has made attempt to revive the instrument. Attempts were also made to have instruments serially manufactured in the Melnytso-Podilsk Musical instrument workshop. =The future= As scholarship reveals more of what Hnat Khotkevych's original ideas were, and as interest grows more players will turn to the Kharkiv bandura. Currently Canadian bandura maker William Vetzal has established serial manufacturing of Kharkiv banduras with backs made of fiberglass which were ordered by the Canadian Bandurist Capella. Two of these new designed instruments have recently been sold to bandurists in Ukraine. References * Diakowsky, M. - A Note on the History of the bandhura.

Superderby  The superderby (supercl√°sico) is the most important football rivalry in Argentina, and the most important local derby. It is contested between Buenos Aires rivals Boca Juniors and River Plate. It name in Spanish derives from the usage of cl√°sico to mean derby and the prefix s√∫per to denote its importance, because Boca Juniors and River Plate are the two most popular and successful teams in Argentine football, commanding more than 70% of all Argentine football fans between them.Argentine football statistics PDF Rivalry began due to the location of both clubs in the same neighborhood (La Boca, where were founded River Plate in 1901 and Boca Juniors in 1905) in the early 20th century (except for 1914 and 1915, when Boca Juniors moved its field to Wilde, a city of the Greater Buenos Aires, and then returned to its neighborhood), before River Plate left definitively the southern neighborhood in 1923 to move to the north of the city. The superderby is known worldwide as one of world football's fiercest and most important derbies.BBC Academy, famous football derbies It isn't particularly noted for the passion of the fans compared to the other important Argentine derbies due to their habituation to won trophies, but is the most followed in the country, and sometimes riots occurred.Marca America article about the violence The English newspaper The Observer put the superderby at the top of their list of 50 sporting things you must do before you die.50 sporting things you must do before you die  Avellaneda derby  The Avellaneda derby (cl√°sico de Avellaneda), contested between Independiente and Racing, is the second most important rivalry in Argentine football. Both teams are from the city of Avellaneda (that is located into the Greater Buenos Aires) but have many fans throughout the country, being the third (Independiente) and fourth (Racing) most popular clubs in Argentina, accounting for more than 9% of the nation's population. Consultora Equis La Nacion P√°gina 12 They are also the third and fourth most successful Argentine teams respectively in terms of total number of honours won. Rivalry started in the first decade of the 20th century, when Independiente, that was founded in 1904 (but officially in 1905) in the neighboring city of Buenos Aires, moved to Avellaneda (named Barracas al Sud until 1904) in 1907, the same year of the first match against Racing (founded in Avellaneda in 1903), played on June 9 for the 3rd division and ended 3-2 in favor of Independiente. Since 1928 both stadiums are just 200 meters apart (Independiente's previous fields in Avellaneda were in other locations of the city). This derby is one of the most intense and colorful of the world, and didn't had a clear dominator until 1970s, when Independiente began to gain an advantage that is currently very large.  Rosario derby  The Rosario derby (cl√°sico rosarino) is the most important derby between clubs that are not based in the autonomous city or the province of Buenos Aires. It is contested between Newell's Old Boys and Rosario Central, the two major teams in the city of Rosario. The teams nicknames relate from the same incident where Rosario Central refused to play a charity game for a Leper colony, hence their nickname Canallas (Scoundrels). Newell's Old Boys stepped in to play the game and earned the nickname Los Leprosos (The Lepers).  Hurac√°n - San Lorenzo de Almagro  This derby, that doesn't have a name of its own (although sometimes is denominated as \\"neighborhood's derby\\" or \\"porte√±o derby\\", this denominations never became popular), is contested between Hurac√°n and San Lorenzo de Almagro, both clubs from Buenos Aires (being the second most important derby of the city). While San Lorenzo de Almagro is the fifth most popular and successful team in Argentine football (and part of the big five), with fans all over the country, Hurac√°n was considered a big team in the amateur era (professional era started in 1931) and since then is considered like a \\"mid-sized\\" team, occupying the 10th place in number of honours won (also remaining most part of its history in 1st division) and having the majority of its fans in Buenos Aires and some cities of the Greater Buenos Aires (mainly Valent√≠n Alsina, Lan√∫s, Pi√±eiro and Gerli) that are near the south of Argentine capital. Rivalry began due to the proximity of both clubs, that since early 20th century to 1979 had their different fields in boundary neighborhoods of the south of Buenos Aires. San Lorenzo de Almagro was founded on April 1, 1908 in Almagro neighborhood, but quickly moved to another location (also in Almagro) that later became a part of Boedo (recognized as an official neighborhood of Buenos Aires in 1972, but the area was informally denominated with this name since late 19th century). Hurac√°n was founded on November 1, 1908 in Nueva Pompeya, and later moved to Parque Patricios, both neighborhoods that borders Boedo (and each other). From 1916 (year of inauguration of San Lorenzo de Almagro's old stadium, the Gas√≥metro) to 1923, stadiums of both clubs were only 500 meters apart, then Hurac√°n (that had its stadium in this place since 1914) built a new stadium in another location of the same neighborhood due to the expropriation of its ground by the government for open a street. In 1979, Argentine dictatorial government expropriated the ground where San Lorenzo de Almagro had its stadium (which was then demolished) and later sold it to a private company that opened a hypermarket (that was closed in 2019 due to the negotiations of the team for recover this ground). The club maintained its headquarters (that were next to the stadium) in the same place, where also are installations for another sports practiced by the club (basketball, volleyball, etc.). During the 1980s and early 1990s, San Lorenzo de Almagro played its home matches in several stadiums of Buenos Aires (including Hurac√°n's stadium) and the Greater Buenos Aires until began to build a new stadium (Pedro Bidegain stadium, known as Nuevo Gas√≥metro) in the 1990s, that was inaugurated on December 16, 1993, in Flores neighborhood (also in the south of Buenos Aires, 3 kilometers away from the old stadium). The derby has been dominated historically by San Lorenzo de Almagro.Statistics at BDFutbol  Western derby  The Western derby (cl√°sico del oeste) is contested between the two major teams in the west of the city of Buenos Aires, Ferro Carril Oeste and V√©lez S√°rsfield.

1814) was a Scottish classicist and literary scholar.William Richardson. Glasgow University (multi- tab page) In 1783 he was a joint founder of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. Life Born in Aberfoyle, Perthshire, he was the son of Rev. James Richardson, the Church of Scotland parish minister of the same parish in which William was first educated. William attended the University of Glasgow in 1757 where he focused on his talent for learning languages. He graduated MA from the University in 1763 and was employed by Charles Cathcart, 9th Lord Cathcart, as tutor to his two sons. William travelled to Russia with the Cathcart family, after Lord Cathcart was appointed ambassador to Russia in 1768. It was during these travels that Richardson described Russia through a series of letters. He later had them published, in 1784, under the title Anecdotes of the Russian Empire; in a series of letters, written, a few years ago, from St. Petersburg. These letters would later go down as a very accurate detail of Russian society. After returning to Scotland in 1772, Richardson was appointed professor of humanities at the University of Glasgow in 1773. With the ability to attract many great scholars, and also being a very popular lecturer, Glasgow became a prestigious institution. Richardson would also publish five works criticizing Shakespeare. Richardson was very interested in not only English literature, but he also read German, Italian, and French literature. He died a single man in his lodgings at Glasgow University.Glasgow Post Office Directory 1817 Archives The archives for William Richardson are maintained by the Archives of the University of Glasgow (GUAS).

The church was located on the south side of Trongate. Two copies of its Latin constitution, dating from 1549, have survived in the city archives. These provide detailed information about the structure of the college and its funding. James Houstoun's original provision was for a Provost, eight canons or prebends, and three choristers, but later benefactions extended this. The prebends were supported by property scattered across the city, and in Dalry, Maybole and Rutherglen. The third prebend was the organist, who was also in charge of the Song School for the instruction of the youth in plainsong and descant, which stood on the west side of the church. When their voices broke, choristers would continue their education at the Grammar School. The canons wore fur- trimmed red hoods, and surplices which were to be washed once a year. The daily pattern of services is carefully laid out. St Anne's Day, 26 July, was marked with much pomp and ringing of bells, after which money for bread and ale was distributed to the canons, to thirty paupers, eight scholars, and the residents of the Hospital of St Nicholas by the cathedral. The lepers of St Ninian's Hospital received their share at a safe distance in the churchyard. At the Reformation in Scotland in 1560, this all came to an end. In 1570, the church was described as ruinous, when it passed into the hands of a city burgess, James Fleming. It later returned to use as a parish church. In the 17th century a gothic spire was built. The church burnt down in 1793, and a new church was built to a classical design but retaining the spire.Old Tron Steeple (Glasgow University Library, Special Collections, Wylie Collection), The Glasgow Story The congregation merged with St George's on Buchanan Street in 1940 to form St George's Tron Church;The Tron at Kelvingrove, The Tron Church after a period of disuse, the building - the Tron Kirk or Laigh Kirk - was converted into the Tron Theatre in the early 1980s.The Building, Tron Theatre See also *List of Collegiate churches in Scotland =References= * Liber Collegii Nostri Domine &c.;, Maitland Club, 1846. * Glasghu Facies - The History of Glasgow, James Gordon, 1873.

Toole applied to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for a construction permit for a new broadcast radio station. The FCC granted this permit on January 18, 1991, with a scheduled expiration date of July 18, 1992. The new station was assigned call sign \\"WDMT\\" on February 22, 1991. After construction and testing were completed in April 1992, the station was granted its broadcast license on July 29, 1992. In August 1995, Devaughn Toole and Mary L. Toole applied to the FCC to transfer the WDMT broadcast license to a new company called WDMT-FM, Inc. The Commission approved the transfer on September 7, 1995. Just over two years later, in December 1997, WDMT-FM, Inc., reached an agreement to sell WDMT to Renegade Broadcasting, LLC. The FCC approved the deal on January 27, 1998, and the transaction was formally consummated on February 28, 1998. The station's call sign was changed to \\"WRVX\\" on March 16, 2001. After an aborted attempt to sell WRVX to Worldwide Petromoly, Inc.

Also known as the Upper Silesian Canal (Kana≈Ç G√≥rno≈õlƒÖski, Oberschlesischer Kanal), it was built from 1935 to 1939 and replaced the K≈Çodnicki Canal. Structure The canal is approximately long; its maximum depth is ; canal width is ; the maximum allowed speed for ships on the canal is ; and the difference in the height of the water levels at its ends is .

The canal passes through Opole Voivodeship and Silesian Voivodeship in Poland. The water in the canal comes from the K≈Çodnica River as well as lakes and reservoirs such as Dzier≈ºno Du≈ºe and Dzier≈ºno Ma≈Çe. History The Gliwice Canal was originally built in the Province of Upper Silesia within Germany. Because the Klodnitz (K≈Çodnicki) Canal had become obsolete, it was decided in 1934 that construction of a new canal was more feasible than modernization of the older Klodnitz Canal, which closed in 1937. The new canal, known as the Gleiwitz Canal (), was built from 1935-1939 and opened for service in 1941. On 8 December 1939, it was renamed the Adolf Hitler Canal (Adolf-Hitler-Kanal), in honor of Adolf Hitler, during the inauguration ceremony by Rudolf Hess. There were also plans to make it a part of the Danube-Oder-Canal project. After World War II, the canal and the surrounding territories (see Regained Territories) were placed under Polish administration according to the 1945 Potsdam Conference. About fifty people are employed in maintaining the canal. About 700 000 tonnes of material are shipped each year through the canal (mostly coal). The Polish government is considering modernizing the canal.

Conor has adapted to this new life, but Sapphire cannot. She is withdrawn and restless, and her only relief is the underwater world of Ingo. She goes there more frequently, even without Conor, who has given up going, and prefers his life in the air. A new couple are living in their old house. The woman is on crutches has the look of Ingo on her face but does not know of the world beneath the sea. Sapphire rescues her when she finds the lady down by the sea, not sure why she is there. One evening Sapphire takes her beloved dog Sadie for a walk along the sea, but the call of Ingo is too strong, so she leaves Sadie up on the pavement and dives in. Faro is there. She only stays a minute but when she goes back to Sadie her dog seems shaken and ill. Sapphire's mum says not to worry: the dog will be fine. Sapphire skips school and takes her dog to see Granny Carne, a magical old lady. She phones home from Granny Carne's and tells her mum she's staying over and won't be back till morning. That night, Sapphire goes back to the cove, where she sees her father. He tells her that the tide knot is loose, but he can't stay long and leaves shortly after. The next day her dog is healed but Sapphire is in trouble with her mum. Soon after, Conor and Sapphire go back to Ingo to find out more about her father. They swim in a rogue current. Whilst Faro rescues Conor, Sapphire is carried into the deep. She wakes up in blackness, but a whale helps her back to Ingo. There Sapphire and Conor see in a mirror-like thing a mer woman with a mer baby. The woman smiles at someone in the corner of the mirror ‚Äì their father smiling lovingly at the woman and the baby. Feeling replaced and sad, they are about to leave when they learn of the tide knot, a stone that controls the tides that is becoming loose. Shortly, after they return, the tide knot loosens and nearly the entire town floods. As the houses are swallowed up by the flood water, Sapphire's mum is ill. Sapphire, her mum and her friend Rainbow go up to the attic. Sapphire jumps out of the window into the sea where she meets Conor and Faro. Sapphire is slammed against a wall and her leg begins to bleed. Conor calls Elvira, a healer. Elvira heals Sapphire and together the four help Saldowr, the wisest of the mer and the keeper of the tide knot, to put the broken pieces back together to restore the tide knot. Saldowr is weak but they manage to do it with Conor's power of reading the stone. The flood slowly recedes. Conor and Sapphire return to the rescue centre where they are re-united with their mother. At the end of the book, Sapphire is delighted that they are going back to their old cottage by the sea.

It was primarily an anti-Catholic, anti-immigration, populist and xenophobic movement, although it was also progressive \\"on issues of labor rights, opposition to slavery, and the need for more government spending\\" as well as for its \\"support for an expansion of the rights of women, regulation of industry, and support of measures designed to improve the status of working people\\". It was also a forerunner to the temperance movement in the United States and its nativist spirit is seen in both the American Protective Association and the Ku Klux Klan. The Know Nothing movement briefly emerged as a major political party in the form of the American Party. Adherents to the movement were to simply reply \\"I know nothing\\" when asked about its specifics by outsiders, providing the group with its common name. Supporters of the Know Nothing movement believed that an alleged \\"Romanist\\" conspiracy was being planned to subvert civil and religious liberty in the United States, and sought to politically organize native-born Protestants in what they described as a defense of their traditional religious and political values. The Know Nothing movement is remembered for this theme because of fears by Protestants that Catholic priests and bishops would control a large bloc of voters. In most places, the ideology and influence of the Know Nothing movement lasted only a year or two before disintegrating due to weak and inexperienced local leaders, a lack of publicly declared national leaders, and a deep split over the issue of slavery. In the South, the party did not emphasize anti- Catholicism as frequently as it did in the North and stressed a neutral position on slavery, but it became the main alternative to the dominant Democratic Party. The collapse of the Whig Party after the passage of the Kansas‚ÄìNebraska Act left an opening for the emergence of a new major political party in opposition to the Democratic Party. The Know Nothing movement managed to elect congressman Nathaniel P. Banks of Massachusetts and several other individuals in the 1854 elections into office, and subsequently coalesced into a new political party known as the American Party. Particularly in the South, the American Party served as a vehicle for politicians opposed to the Democrats. Many also hoped that it would stake out a middle ground between the pro-slavery positions of Democratic politicians and the radical anti-slavery positions of the rapidly emerging Republican Party. The American Party nominated former President Millard Fillmore in the 1856 presidential election, although he kept quiet about his membership, and personally refrained from supporting the Know Nothing movement's activities and ideology. Fillmore received 21.5% of the popular vote in the 1856 presidential election, finishing behind the Democratic and Republican nominees. The party entered a period of rapid decline after Fillmore's loss in the 1856 presidential election and the controversial Dred Scott v. Sandford decision made by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1857 further galvanized opposition to slavery in the North, causing many former Know Nothings to join the Republicans.  History  Anti-Catholicism had been a factor in colonial America but played a minor role in American politics until the arrival of large numbers of Irish and German Catholics in the 1840s.Francis D. Cogliano, No King, No Popery: Anti-Catholicism in Revolutionary New England (Greenwood 1995). It then reemerged in nativist attacks on Catholic immigration. It appeared in New York City politics as early as 1843 under the banner of the American Republican Party.Ira M. Leonard, \\"The Rise and Fall of the American Republican Party in New York City, 1843‚Äì1845.\\" New-York Historical Society Quarterly 50 (1966): 151‚Äì92. The movement quickly spread to nearby states using that name or Native American Party or variants of it. They succeeded in a number of local and Congressional elections, notably in 1844 in Philadelphia, where the anti-Catholic orator Lewis Charles Levin, who went on to be the first Jewish congressman, was elected Representative from Pennsylvania's 1st district. In the early 1850s, numerous secret orders grew up, of which the Order of United AmericansLouis D. Scisco, Political Nativism in New York State (1901) p. 267. and the Order of the Star Spangled Banner came to be the most important. They emerged in New York in the early 1850s as a secret order that quickly spread across the North, reaching non-Catholics, particularly those who were lower middle class or skilled workmen. = Name = The name Know Nothing originated in the semi-secret organization of the party. When a member was asked about his activities, he was supposed to reply, \\"I know nothing.\\" Outsiders derisively called them \\"Know Nothings\\", and the name stuck. In 1855, the Know Nothings first entered politics under the American Party label.Sean Wilentz. pp. 681‚Äì2, 693.Ray A. Billington. pp. 337, 380‚Äì406. = Underlying issues = The immigration of large numbers of Irish and German Catholics to the United States in the period between 1830 and 1860 made religious differences between Catholics and Protestants a political issue. Violence occasionally erupted at the polls. Protestants alleged that Pope Pius IX had put down the failed liberal Revolutions of 1848 and that he was an opponent of liberty, democracy and republicanism. One Boston minister described Catholicism as \\"the ally of tyranny, the opponent of material prosperity, the foe of thrift, the enemy of the railroad, the caucus, and the school\\".Ray A. Billington. The Protestant Crusade, 1800‚Äì1860 (1938) p. 242.John T. McGreevey. Catholicism and American Freedom: A History (2003) pp. 22‚Äì5, 34 (quotation). These fears encouraged conspiracy theories regarding papal intentions of subjugating the United States through a continuing influx of Catholics controlled by Irish bishops obedient to and personally selected by the Pope. In 1849, an oath-bound secret society, the Order of the Star Spangled Banner, was created by Charles B. Allen in New York City. At its inception, the Order of the Star Spangled Banner only had about 36 members. Fear of Catholic immigration led to a dissatisfaction with the Democratic Party, whose leadership in many cities included Catholics of Irish descent. Activists formed secret groups, coordinating their votes and throwing their weight behind candidates sympathetic to their cause: = Rise = In spring 1854, the Know Nothings carried Boston and Salem, Massachusetts, and other New England cities. They swept the state of Massachusetts in the fall 1854 elections, their biggest victory. The Whig candidate for mayor of Philadelphia, editor Robert T. Conrad, was soon revealed as a Know Nothing as he promised to crack down on crime, close saloons on Sundays and to appoint only native-born Americans to office‚Äîhe won by a landslide. In Washington, D.C., Know Nothing candidate John T. Towers defeated incumbent Mayor John Walker Maury, causing opposition of such proportion that the Democrats, Whigs, and Freesoilers in the capital united as the \\"Anti-Know-Nothing Party\\". In New York, in a four-way race the Know Nothing candidate ran third with 26%. After the 1854 elections, they exerted decisive influence in Maine, Indiana, Pennsylvania, and California, but historians are unsure about the accuracy of this information due to the secrecy of the party, as all parties were in turmoil and the anti-slavery and prohibition issues overlapped with nativism in complex and confusing ways. They helped elect Stephen Palfrey Webb as mayor of San Francisco and J. Neely Johnson as governor of California. Nathaniel P. Banks was elected to Congress as a Know Nothing candidate, but after a few months he aligned with Republicans. A coalition of Know Nothings, Republicans and other members of Congress opposed to the Democratic Party elected Banks to the position of Speaker of the House. The results of the 1854 elections were so favorable to the Know Nothings, up to then an informal movement with no centralized organization, that they formed officially as a political party called the American Party, which attracted many members of the now nearly defunct Whig party as well as a significant number of Democrats. Membership in the American Party increased dramatically, from 50,000 to an estimated one million plus in a matter of months during that year.Anbinder, Nativism and Slavery, pp. 75‚Äì102. The historian Tyler Anbinder concluded: In San Francisco, a Know Nothing chapter was founded in 1854 to oppose Chinese immigration‚Äîmembers included a judge of the state supreme court, who ruled that no Chinese person could testify as a witness against a white man in court. Fillmore‚ÄìDonelson campaign poster In the spring of 1855, Know Nothing candidate Levi Boone was elected mayor of Chicago and barred all immigrants from city jobs. Abraham Lincoln was strongly opposed to the principles of the Know Nothing movement, but did not denounce it publicly because he needed the votes of its membership to form a successful anti-slavery coalition in Illinois. Ohio was the only state where the party gained strength in 1855. Their Ohio success seems to have come from winning over immigrants, especially German-American Lutherans and Scots-Irish Presbyterians, both hostile to Catholicism. In Alabama, Know Nothings were a mix of former Whigs, discontented Democrats and other political outsiders who favored state aid to build more railroads. Virginia attracted national attention in its tempestuous 1855 gubernatorial election. Democrat Henry Alexander Wise won by convincing state voters that Know Nothings were in bed with Northern abolitionists. With the victory by Wise, the movement began to collapse in the South.Allan Nevins, Ordeal of the Union: A House Dividing 1852‚Äì1857 (1947) 2:396‚Äì8.John David Bladek, Virginia Is Middle Ground': The Know Nothing Party and the Virginia Gubernatorial Election of 1855\\". Virginia Magazine of History and Biography (1998): 35‚Äì70. . Know Nothings scored victories in Northern state elections in 1854, winning control of the legislature in Massachusetts and polling 40% of the vote in Pennsylvania. Although most of the new immigrants lived in the North, resentment and anger against them was national and the American Party initially polled well in the South, attracting the votes of many former southern Whigs. The party name gained wide but brief popularity. Nativism became a new American rage: Know Nothing candy, Know Nothing tea, and Know Nothing toothpicks appeared. Stagecoaches were dubbed \\"The Know Nothing\\". In Trescott, Maine, a shipowner dubbed his new 700-ton freighter Know Nothing.David Harry Bennett, The Party of Fear: From Nativist Movements to the New Right in American History (1988), p. 15. The party was occasionally referred to, contemporaneously, in a slightly pejorative shortening, \\"Knism.\\"William E. Gienapp. Salmon P. Chase, Nativism, and the Formation of the Republican Party in Ohio, pp. 22, 24. Ohio History, p. 93. = Leadership and legislation = Historian John Mulkern has examined the party's success in sweeping to almost complete control of the Massachusetts legislature after its 1854 landslide victory. He finds the new party was populist and highly democratic, hostile to wealth, elites and to expertise, and deeply suspicious of outsiders, especially Catholics. The new party's voters were concentrated in the rapidly growing industrial towns, where Yankee workers faced direct competition with new Irish immigrants. Whereas the Whig Party was strongest in high income districts, the Know Nothing electorate was strongest in the poor districts. They expelled the traditional upper-class, closed, political leadership, especially the lawyers and merchants. In their stead, they elected working-class men, farmers and a large number of teachers and ministers. Replacing the moneyed elite were men who seldom owned $10,000 in property. Nationally, the new party leadership showed incomes, occupation, and social status that were about average. Few were wealthy, according to detailed historical studies of once-secret membership rosters. Fewer than 10% were unskilled workers who might come in direct competition with Irish laborers. They enlisted few farmers, but on the other hand they included many merchants and factory owners.Anbinder, Nativism and Slavery, pp. 34‚Äì43. The party's voters were by no means all native-born Americans, for it won more than a fourth of the German and British Protestants in numerous state elections. It especially appealed to Protestants such as the Lutherans, Dutch Reformed and Presbyterians. The most aggressive and innovative legislation came out of Massachusetts, where the new party controlled all but three of the 400 seats‚Äîonly 35 had any previous legislative experience. The Massachusetts legislature in 1855 passed a series of reforms that \\"burst the dam against change erected by party politics, and released a flood of reforms.\\" Historian Stephen Taylor says that in addition to nativist legislation, \\"the party also distinguished itself by its opposition to slavery, support for an expansion of the rights of women, regulation of industry, and support of measures designed to improve the status of working people\\". It passed legislation to regulate railroads, insurance companies and public utilities. It funded free textbooks for the public schools and raised the appropriations for local libraries and for the school for the blind. Purification of Massachusetts against divisive social evils was a high priority. The legislature set up the state's first reform school for juvenile delinquents while trying to block the importation of supposedly subversive government documents and academic books from Europe. It upgraded the legal status of wives, giving them more property rights and more rights in divorce courts. It passed harsh penalties on speakeasies, gambling houses and bordellos. It passed prohibition legislation with penalties that were so stiff‚Äîsuch as six months in prison for serving one glass of beer‚Äîthat juries refused to convict defendants. Many of the reforms were quite expensive; state spending rose 45% on top of a 50% hike in annual taxes on cities and towns. This extravagance angered the taxpayers, and few Know Nothings were reelected.Taylor, \\"Progressive Nativism: The Know-Nothing Party in Massachusetts\\" pp. 171‚Äì2. The highest priority included attacks on the civil rights of Irish Catholic immigrants. After this, state courts lost the power to process applications for citizenship and public schools had to require compulsory daily reading of the Protestant Bible (which the nativists were sure would transform the Catholic children). The governor disbanded the Irish militias and replaced Irish holding state jobs with Protestants. It failed to reach the two-thirds vote needed to pass a state constitutional amendment to restrict voting and office holding to men who had resided in Massachusetts for at least 21 years. The legislature then called on Congress to raise the requirement for naturalization from five years to 21 years, but Congress never acted. The most dramatic move by the Know Nothing legislature was to appoint an investigating committee designed to prove widespread sexual immorality underway in Catholic convents. The press had a field day following the story, especially when it was discovered that the key reformer was using committee funds to pay for a prostitute. The legislature shut down its committee, ejected the reformer, and saw its investigation become a laughing stock.Tyler Anbinder, Nativism and Slavery (1992), p. 137John R. Mulkern, \\"Scandal Behind the Convent Walls: The Know-Nothing Nunnery Committee of 1855.\\" Historical Journal of Massachusetts 11 (1983): 22‚Äì34. reveals the actual behavior of the Catholic nuns.Robert Howard Lord, et al., History of the Archdiocese of Boston in the Various Stages of Development, 1604 to 1943 (1944) pp. 686‚Äì99 for more details. The Know Nothings also dominated politics in Rhode Island, where in 1855 William W. Hoppin held the governorship and five out of every seven votes went to the party, which dominated the Rhode Island legislature. Local newspapers such as The Providence Journal fueled anti-Irish and anti-Catholic sentiment. = Violence = Know Nothing Party ticket naming party candidates for state and county offices (at the bottom of the page are voting instructions) Fearful that Catholics were flooding the polls with non-citizens, local activists threatened to stop them. On 6 August 1855, rioting broke out in Louisville, Kentucky, during a hotly contested race for the office of governor. Twenty-two were killed and many injured. This \\"Bloody Monday\\" riot was not the only violent riot between Know Nothings and Catholics in 1855.Charles E. Deusner. \\"The Know Nothing Riots in Louisville\\", Register of the Kentucky Historical Society 61 (1963), pp. 122‚Äì47. In Baltimore, the mayoral elections of 1856, 1857, and 1858 were all marred by violence and well-founded accusations of ballot-rigging. In the coastal town of Ellsworth Maine in 1854, Know Nothings were associated with the tarring and feathering of a Catholic priest, Jesuit Johannes Bapst. They also burned down a Catholic church in Bath, Maine.Maine Historical Society, Maine: A History, (1919) Volume 1, lsworth&f;=false pp. 304‚Äì5 online. = South = In the Southern United States, the American Party was composed chiefly of ex-Whigs looking for a vehicle to fight the dominant Democratic Party and worried about both the pro-slavery extremism of the Democrats and the emergence of the anti- slavery Republican party in the North. In the South as a whole, the American Party was strongest among former Unionist Whigs. States-rightist Whigs shunned it, enabling the Democrats to win most of the South. Whigs supported the American Party because of their desire to defeat the Democrats, their unionist sentiment, their anti-immigrant attitudes and the Know Nothing neutrality on the slavery issue. David T. Gleeson notes that many Irish Catholics in the South feared the arrival of the Know-Nothing movement portended a serious threat. He argues: > The southern Irish, who had seen the dangers of Protestant bigotry in > Ireland, had the distinct feeling that the Know-Nothings were an American > manifestation of that phenomenon. Every migrant, no matter how settled or > prosperous, also worried that this virulent strain of nativism threatened > his or her hard-earned gains in the South and integration into its society. > Immigrants fears were unjustified, however, because the national debate over > slavery and its expansion, not nativism or anti-Catholicism, was the major > reason for Know-Nothing success in the South. The southerners who supported > the Know-Nothings did so, for the most part, because they thought the > Democrats who favored the expansion of slavery might break up the > Union.David T. Gleeson, The Irish in the South, 1815‚Äì1877 (2001) p. 78. In 1855, the American Party challenged the Democrats' dominance. In Alabama, the Know Nothings were a mix of former Whigs, malcontented Democrats and other political misfits; they favored state aid to build more railroads. In the fierce campaign, the Democrats argued that Know Nothings could not protect slavery from Northern abolitionists. The Know Nothing American Party disintegrated soon after losing in 1855. In Virginia, the Know Nothing movement came under sharp attack from both established parties. Democrats published a 12,000-word, point-by-point denunciation of Know Nothingism. The Democrats nominated ex-Whig Henry A. Wise for governor. He denounced the \\"lousy, godless, Christless\\" Know Nothings and instead he advocated an expanded program of internal improvements.John David Bladek, \\"'Virginia Is Middle Ground': The Know Nothing Party and the Virginia Gubernatorial Election of 1855.\\" Virginia Magazine of History and Biography(1998), pp. 35-70 online p. 45.Philip Morrison Rice, \\"The Know-Nothing Party in Virginia, 1854-1856.\\" Virginia Magazine of History and Biography (1947) 55#1: 61-75, at p. 66 online.Philip Morrison Rice, \\"The Know-Nothing Party in Virginia, 1854-1856 (Concluded),\\" Virginia Magazine of History and Biography 55#2 (1947), pp. 159-167 online. In Louisiana and Maryland, the Know Nothings enlisted native- born Catholics. In Maryland, the party was dead but its past leaders remained active in other parties. The American Party's Governor and later Senator Thomas Holliday Hicks, Representative Henry Winter Davis, and Senator Anthony Kennedy, with his brother, former Representative John Pendleton Kennedy, all supported the Union in a border state. Historian Michael F. Holt argues that \\"Know Nothingism originally grew in the South for the same reasons it spread in the North‚Äînativism, anti-Catholicism, and animosity toward unresponsive politicos‚Äînot because of conservative Unionism\\". Holt cites William B. Campbell, former governor of Tennessee, who wrote in January 1855: \\"I have been astonished at the widespread feeling in favor of their principles‚Äîto wit, Native Americanism and anti-Catholicism‚Äîit takes everywhere\\". Louisiana Despite the national American Party's anti-Catholicism, the Know Nothings found strong support in Louisiana, including in largely Catholic New Orleans. The Whig Party in Louisiana had a strong anti-immigrant bent, making the Native American Party the natural home for Louisiana's former Whigs. Louisiana Know Nothings were pro-slavery and anti-immigrant, but, in contrast to the national party, refused to include a religious test for membership. Instead, the Louisiana Know Nothings insisted that \\"loyalty to a church should not supersede loyalty to the Union.\\" In fact, Know Nothing congressman John Edward Bouligny, a Catholic Creole, was the only member of the Louisiana congressional delegation who refused to resign his seat after the state seceded from the Union. = Decline = Results by county indicating the percentage for Fillmore in each county The party declined rapidly in the North after 1855. In the presidential election of 1856, it was bitterly divided over slavery. The main faction supported the ticket of presidential nominee Millard Fillmore and vice presidential nominee Andrew Jackson Donelson. Fillmore, a former president, had been a Whig and Donelson was the nephew of Democratic President Andrew Jackson, so the ticket was designed to appeal to loyalists from both major parties, winning 23% of the popular vote and carrying one state, Maryland, with eight electoral votes. Fillmore did not win enough votes to block Democrat James Buchanan from the White House. During this time, Nathaniel Banks decided he was not as strongly for the anti- immigrant platform as the party wanted him to be, so he left the Know Nothing Party for the more anti-slavery Republican Party. He contributed to the decline of the Know Nothing Party by taking two-thirds of its members with him. Many were appalled by the Know Nothings. Abraham Lincoln expressed his own disgust with the political party in a private letter to Joshua Speed, written 24 August 1855. Lincoln never publicly attacked the Know Nothings, whose votes he needed: > I am not a Know-Nothing‚Äîthat is certain. How could I be? How can any one who > abhors the oppression of negroes, be in favor of degrading classes of white > people? Our progress in degeneracy appears to me to be pretty rapid. As a > nation, we began by declaring that \\"all men are created equal.\\" We now > practically read it \\"all men are created equal, except negroes.\\" When the > Know-Nothings get control, it will read \\"all men are created equals, except > negroes and foreigners and Catholics.\\" When it comes to that I should prefer > emigrating to some country where they make no pretense of loving liberty‚Äîto > Russia, for instance, where despotism can be taken pure, and without the > base alloy of hypocrisy. Historian Allan Nevins, writing about the turmoil preceding the American Civil War, states that Millard Fillmore was never a Know Nothing nor a nativist. Fillmore was out of the country when the presidential nomination came and had not been consulted about running. Nevins further states: > [Fillmore] was not a member of the party; he had never attended an American > [Know-Nothing] gathering. By no spoken or written word had he indicated a > subscription to American [Party] tenets.Allan Nevins, Ordeal of the Union: A > House Dividing 1852‚Äì1857 (1947), 2:467 After the Supreme Court's controversial Dred Scott v. Sandford ruling in 1857, most of the anti-slavery members of the American Party joined the Republican Party. The pro-slavery wing of the American Party remained strong on the local and state levels in a few southern states, but by the 1860 election they were no longer a serious national political movement. Most of their remaining members supported the Constitutional Union Party in 1860.

Safire's Political Dictionary (2008) pp. 375‚Äì76 In the late 19th century, Democrats called the Republicans \\"Know Nothings\\" in order to secure the votes of Germans as in the Bennett Law campaign in Wisconsin in 1890.Richard J. Jensen.

A similar culture war took place in Illinois in 1892, where Democrat John Peter Altgeld denounced the Republicans: Some historians and journalists \\"have found parallels with the Birther and Tea Party movements, seeing the prejudices against Latino immigrants and hostility towards Islam as a similarity\\". Historians Steve Fraser and Joshue B. Freeman lend their opinion on the Know Nothing and the Tea Party movements, arguing: > Tea Party populism should also be thought of as a kind of identity politics > of the right. Almost entirely white, and disproportionately male and older, > Tea Party advocates express a visceral anger at the cultural and, to some > extent, political eclipse of an America in which people who looked and > thought like them were dominant (an echo, in its own way, of the anguish of > the Know-Nothings). A black President, female speaker of the house, and a > gay head of the House Financial Services Committee are evidently almost too > much to bear. Though the anti-immigration and Tea Party movements so far > have remained largely distinct (even with growing ties), they share an > emotional grammar: the fear of displacement. Know Nothing has become a provocative slur, suggesting that the opponent is both nativist and ignorant. George Wallace's 1968 presidential campaign was said by Time to be under the \\"neo-Know Nothing banner\\". Fareed Zakaria wrote that politicians who \\"encourage[d] Americans to fear foreigners\\" were becoming \\"modern incarnations of the Know-Nothings\\". In 2006, an editorial in The Weekly Standard by neoconservative William Kristol accused populist Republicans of \\"turning the GOP into an anti-immigration, Know-Nothing party\\".Craig Shirley. \\"How the GOP Lost Its Way\\", The Washington Post, 22 April 2006, p.

The lead editorial of the 20 May 2007 issue of The New York Times on a proposed immigration bill referred to \\"this generation's Know- Nothings\\".\\"The Immigration Deal\\", The New York Times, 20 May 2007. An editorial written by Timothy Egan in The New York Times on 27 August 2010 and titled \\"Building a Nation of Know-Nothings\\" discussed the birther movement, which falsely claimed that Barack Obama was not a natural-born United States citizen, which is a requirement for the office of president of the United States.Egan, Timothy. \\"Building a Nation of Know-Nothings\\", The New York Times, 27 August 2010.

The intent is to throw the kicker off of their routine and force them to feel pressure for a longer amount of time. The tactic is used at the collegiate and professional levels, although its effectiveness has not been proven. Overview In order to ice a kicker, either a player or a coach on the defending team will call a timeout just as the kicker is about to attempt a game-tying or game-winning field goal. This is intended to either stop the kick immediately as the kicker is mentally prepared, or allow for the kicker to kick immediately after the timeout so that the initial kick does not count, in an attempt to mentally disrupt the kicker for the actual kick. If the tactic is successful, the kicker will miss the kick due to choking. Should the kicker make the subsequent kick, then the attempt to ice the kicker is considered unsuccessful. One variant of this tactic, attributed to former Denver Broncos coach Mike Shanahan,\\"Icing Kicker: New Tactic Has Drawn Double Take\\" The New York Times, 21 October 2007 is to call time out from the sidelines just before the ball is snapped. This prevents the kicking team from realizing the kick will not count until after the play is over. However, this has the potential to backfire: the invalid first kick could miss or be blocked, only to be followed by a successful second kick. Effectiveness A study was undertaken by Scott Berry, a statistician and the former chairman of the Statistics in Sports section of the American Statistical Association, and Craig Wood, a biostatistician, life-long Pittsburgh Steeler fan, who won the Inaugural Henry Hood Center for Health Research Pillar Award, was published in 2004 in the journal Chance.Berry, S., and C. Wood. 2004. The cold-foot effect. Chance 17(No. 4):47-51. Berry and Wood looked at every field-goal attempt made in the 2002 and 2003 NFL seasons, including playoffs, and concluded that, for \\"pressure kicks\\" - those made with 3 minutes or less remaining in the game or overtime period which would tie the game or put the kicking team in the lead - in the 40-55 yard range, icing the kicker caused the percentage of successful attempts to drop by about ten percent for an average kicker on a sunny day. On shorter kicks, the effect was found to be negligible.Peterson, Ivars. \\"Icing the Kicker\\" Muse (September 2005)Peterson, Ivars. The Iced Foot Effect MathTrek (November 15, 2004) However, the statistical significance of the difference found - which amounted to four kicks out of 39 attempts - has been questioned,Birnbaum, Phil. \\"And (sic) old 'icing the kicker' study\\" Sabermetric Research (January 6, 2008) and an examination by Nick Stamms of STATS, Inc. found that \\"pressure kicks\\" (defined as above except within two minutes, not three) in the NFL regular season from 1991 to 2005 showed an insignificant difference between non-iced kicks (457 out of 637, or 71.7%) and iced kicks (152 out of 211, or 72.0%).Zimmerman, Paul. \\"Icing on the cake\\" Si.com (January 21, 2005) In other sports A similar tactic is also common in basketball, known as icing the shooter. A team may call a time out just before the opposing team's free-throw shooter is given the ball on the final free throw, in an attempt to disrupt the shooter, typically if a missed free throw allows for the calling team to either have a chance to win the game with a successful field goal, or allows the calling team to preserve a lead.

Rogers received a Bachelor of Arts degree in sociology in 1940, and accepted a position as an assistant in the Sociology Department the following year.

Productions was a women's theatre collective active in New York City from 1980 to 1988. It was founded by Robin Epstein and Dorothy Cantwell and based in the East Village section of Lower Manhattan, New York City. More Fire! Productions created and produced eight full-length plays between 1980 and 1988, becoming known as \\"one of the city's leading women's theatre groups\\" for its contributions to the downtown, experimental theatre, and women's and lesbian theatre scenes of the 1980s.Jennifer Dunning, \\"What's Doing in Town and Out,\\" The New York Times, 24 May 1985: C22. Epstein and Cantwell co-wrote, produced, and performed in the company's first three plays: As the Burger Broils (1980), The Exorcism of Cheryl (1981), and Junk Love (1981), which had numerous runs and became a neighborhood cult classic, \\"the longest running show on Avenue A.\\"Sarah Schulman, \\"E. Village Alternative to Therapy: Junk Love and Exorcism,\\" Womanews (February 1982). See also Stephen Holden, \\"Avant- Garde Antics for the Adventurous,\\" The New York Times, 5 September 1986: C5. Epstein then wrote and produced The Godmother (1983). Novelist and writer Sarah Schulman joined the company in 1983 and collaborated on the writing and performing of three later plays: Art Failures (1983), Whining and Dining (1984), and Epstein on the Beach (1985). The final play, Beyond Bedlam (1987), was written and produced by Epstein, who was the only person involved in all More Fire! plays. Early history Along with Epstein and Cantwell, another founding member of More Fire! was Stephanie Doba, who collaborated on and performed in six More Fire! plays. In the mid-1970s, Doba was working at The Kosciuszko Foundation, a Polish-American non-profit organization having its headquarters in New York City. She was asked by Polish theatre director Jerzy Grotowski to help facilitate the participation of Americans in the \\"Tree of People\\", a new project of his Polish Laboratory Theatre. Grotowski's work at that time embodied a search for authentic expression through improvisation and interaction among participants, rather than performance for audiences.Ron Grimes, \\"The Theatre of Sources,\\" The Drama Review 25, no. 3 (1981): 67; Daniel E. Cashman, \\"Grotowski: His Twentieth Anniversary,\\" Theatre Journal 31, no. 4 (1979): 460-66; Robert Findlay, \\"Grotowski's 'Cultural Explorations Bordering on Art, Especially Theatre',\\" Theatre Journal 32, no. 3 (1980): 349-56. Cantwell and Doba met as participants in the Tree of People project in Wroclaw, Poland, in the winter of 1979.Charles Tarzian, \\"Performance Space P.S. 122\\", The Drama Review 29, no. 1 (1985): 86. Grotowski's focus on improvisatory expression matched and nurtured a strong interest in movement improvisation in the downtown community of the East Village in the late 1970s. Open Movement, the weekly participatory event held at Performance Space 122 (also known as P.S. 122), became a regular meeting ground for New York and European dancers, actors and other artists, a number of whom had taken part in Grotowski's projects. Cantwell, Doba, and Epstein were all regular participants in Open Movement. Cantwell and Doba began collaborating with Epstein, who was then primarily a painter, to create an avant-garde, experimental theatre style.Susan Mernit, \\"Robin Epstein: From Painter to Playwright,\\" New Women's Times Feminist Review (November/December 1984): 7. Another founding member was Marianne Willtorp, now a member of the Swedish Film Institute (Svenska Filminstitutet). Willtorp collaborated on and performed in The Exorcism of Cheryl, Junk Love, and The Godmother. Willtorp's 1981 documentary film More Fire! explores the making of the collective's first original experimental play, As the Burger Broils, which used the movement and physicality of restaurant work to create theatre. The film shows the company's improvisational use of restaurant movement and language, and its real-life context in Epstein and Cantwell's lives as busy East Village artists and actresses who earned their livings as waitresses. As co-founders of More Fire! Productions, Epstein and Cantwell shared a joint vision and aesthetic. Cantwell's writing and acting abilities were crucial to the company's early success. Her primary interest was in creating a passionate, funny, excessive style of acting, using characters and situations drawn with broad strokes and shameless exaggeration. Cantwell's ability to improvise and understanding of theatre inspired and shaped Epstein's own theatrical vision, which also developed out of her work as a painter, interest in popular film, and background as a working-class Jewish New Yorker. More Fire! used the superficial appearance of autobiography‚Äì‚Äìparticularly Epstein's‚Äì‚Äìas a framework for the satirical exploration of a variety of themes and genres, including the confessional style of some East Village performance art. The company's style developed through collaborative improvising and writing, with lesbians and straight women working together to create and sustain an avant- garde, alternative theatre company. Later history In 1983, Cantwell began to perform with Good Medicine and Company, founded by Carlos Ricardo Martinez and downtown actor/playwright Jeff Weiss. She performed in carlos ricardo martinez's Teddy and the Social Worker and Art the Rat.Peter Rose - performance history She starred with Jeff Weiss in his long-running, episodic show, . . . and That's How the Rent Gets Paid (Part IV).William Harris, \\"How Weiss Pays the Rent,\\" East Village Eye, February 1984; Sarah Schulman, Stagestruck: Theater, AIDS, and the Marketing of Gay America.

Cantwell also performed with Weiss and members of the Wooster Group, including Ron Vawter and Willem Dafoe, at the Performing Garage.Mel Gussow, \\"Jeff Weiss's Rent Gets Paid,\\" The New York Times, 30 August 1984. In 1987, Cantwell debuted on Broadway (at the Longacre Theatre) in Circle Repertory Company's production of John Bishop's The Musical Comedy Murders of 1940.Mel Gussow, \\"New Stars on Stage and Restaurant Row,\\" The New York Times, 10 April 1987. Epstein, who has been called the \\"lesbian equivalent of Woody Allen,\\"Leslie Gevirtz, \\"Whining and Dining,\\" Gay Community News 12, no. 27, 26 January 1985. continued as the central creative and organizing force behind More Fire! until she decided to disband the company in 1988. She was involved in every aspect of the production end as well as the artistic creation and design. She wrote, often in collaboration with others, all eight More Fire! experimental plays, performed in them, designed sets and painted scenery, created popular music soundtracks, and wrote songs. Epstein's later work with More Fire! includes Beyond Bedlam and three plays written in collaboration with Sarah Schulman: Art Failures, Whining and Dining, and Epstein on the Beach. Other downtown performers appeared with the company, including Stephanie Skura in the title role in The Godmother, Jennifer Miller in Whining and Dining and Epstein on the Beach, and Holly Hughes in Whining and Dining. Writer and performer Deb Margolin contributed monologues for The Godmother and Beyond Bedlam, and a guest appearance in Junk Love. Some productions (Junk Love and Epstein on the Beach) also included male actors, such as actor/playwright Paul Walker and comic Jerry Turner. Audience and critics More Fire! Productions developed a following among East Village theatre audiences. East Village, women's, and New York gay and lesbian publications commented on the company's energy, inventiveness, broad humor, and satire of the downtown arts scene. Other Stages described Junk Love as \\"savagely witty\\" and praised the company's \\"original and daring performers.\\"Laurie Winer, Review of Junk Love, Other Stages, 22 April 1982: 5. The New York Native called Whining and Dining \\"theater as carnival.\\"Jolanta Benal, \\"Soul on Trial in Grossinger's Dining Room,\\" New York Native, 14 January 1985. The Flue, published by Franklin Furnace, an avant-garde art and performance space, noted that \\"the business is fast and funny, ferociously local.\\"Barbara Baracks, \\"All You Need Is Junk,\\" The Flue 2:3 (1982): 24-27. The East Village Eye wrote of Art Failures: \\"Perhaps Epstein and Schulman's greatest achievement was their ability to crystalize the contradictions at the heart of the theatre/performance world. . . . Along the way Epstein and Schulman knowingly poke fun at themselves and lots of other talented individuals.\\"William Harris, \\"Review of Art Failures,\\" East Village Eye, February 1984. Performances by More Fire! received mixed reviews in The New York Times and The Village Voice. Stephen Holden of The New York Times wrote: \\"Obviously, ensembles like More Fire!, which has earned a loyal cult following, are determined to remain outside of the mainstream.\\"Stephen Holden, \\"Avant-Garde Antics for the Adventurous,\\" The New York Times, 5 September 1986: C5. C. Carr of The Village Voice wrote of Epstein on the Beach: \\"Parts of the show were quite funny‚Äì‚Äìespecially a parody of Quarry which managed to recreate and mock many of the visual high points of Meredith Monk's classic within a few minutes. But the gist of the story‚Äì‚Äìthat 'hypocrisy is the spice of life' and lesbians will sell out as fast as the next person‚Äì‚Äìmade it . . . cynical.\\"C. Carr, On Edge: Performance at the End of the Twentieth Century (Hanover, NH: Wesleyan University Press, 1993), 87. The harshest commentary came from Alisa Solomon, also of The Village Voice, who reviewed Art Failures after audience members sent hundreds of postcards demanding a review. Although the postcards were part of the performance, Solomon saw them as a \\"cry for reviews\\" and described the play as \\"politically irresponsible. . . . Instead of taking potshots from a fortress of self-indulgence, why not seriously engage issues of capitalist patriarchy?\\"Alisa Solomon, \\"Bold Whines in New Battles,\\" The Village Voice, 21 December 1983. Performance venues Most productions were performed at the University of the Streets, located on Seventh Street and Avenue A in the East Village. As the Burger Broils previewed at P.S. 122's Avant-Garde-Arama and then became the first full- length public play or performance ever to be presented in P.S. 122, in October 1980. In 1981, More Fire! participated in the Second Women's One World (WOW) Festival of women's and lesbian theatre, in New York City, where the company performed The Exorcism of Cheryl and an excerpt from Junk Love.Barbara Baracks, \\"Deja WOW,\\" The Village Voice 14 October 1981: 103. The Exorcism of Cheryl was also performed at the 1981 Boston Women's Theatre Festival. In 1986, The Performing Garage hosted a More Fire!

Founded in 1994 by Halsey Minor and Shelby Bonnie, it was the flagship brand of CNET Networks and became a brand of CBS Interactive through that unit's acquisition of CNET Networks in 2008. CNET originally produced content for radio and television in addition to its website and now uses new media distribution methods through its Internet television network, CNET Video, and its podcast and blog networks. In addition, CNET currently has region-specific and language-specific editions. These include Chinese, French, German, Japanese, Korean, and Spanish. According to third-party web analytics providers Alexa and SimilarWeb, CNET is the highest-read technology news source on the Web, with over 200 million readers per month, being among the 200 most visited websites globally, as of 2015. History =Origins= Logo of CNET Networks prior to acquisition by CBS Interactive In 1994, with the help from Fox Network co-founder Kevin Wendle and former Disney creative associate Dan Baker, CNET produced four pilot television programs about computers, technology, and the Internet. CNET TV was composed of CNET Central, The Web, and The New Edge.CNETEntertainment Weekly CNET Central was created first and aired in syndication in the United States on the USA Network. Later, it began airing on USA's sister network Sci- Fi Channel along with The Web and The New Edge. These were later followed by TV.com in 1996. Current American Idol host Ryan Seacrest first came to national prominence at CNET, as the host of The New Edge and doing various voice-over work for CNET. In addition, CNET produced another television technology news program called News.com that aired on CNBC beginning in 1999. From 2001 to 2003, CNET operated CNET Radio on the Clear Channel-owned KNEW (910) in the San Francisco Bay Area, WBPS (890) in Boston, and XM Satellite Radio. CNET Radio offered technology-themed programming. After failing to attract a sufficient audience, CNET Radio ceased operating in January 2003 due to financial losses. =Acquisitions and expansions= As CNET Networks, the site made various acquisitions to expand its reach across various web platforms, regions, and markets. In July 1999, CNET acquired the Swiss-based company GDT. GDT was later renamed to CNET Channel. In 1998, CNET granted the right to Asiacontent.com to set up CNET Asia and the operation was brought back in December 2000. In January 2000, the same time CNET became CNET Networks, they acquired comparison shopping site mySimon for $736 million. In October 2000, CNET Networks acquired ZDNet for approximately $1.6 billion. In January 2001, Ziff Davis Media, Inc. reached an agreement with CNET Networks, Inc. to regain the URLs lost in the 2000 sale of Ziff Davis, Inc. to SoftBank Corp. a publicly traded Japanese media and technology company. In April 2001, CNET acquired TechRepublic Inc., which provides content for IT professionals from Gartner, Inc., for $23 million in cash and stock. On July 14, 2004, CNET announced that it would acquire Webshots, the leading photography website for $70 million ($60 million in cash, $10 million in deferred consideration), completing the acquisition that same month. In October 2007, they sold Webshots to American Greetings for $45 million. In August 2005, CNET acquired Metacritic, a review aggregation website, for an undisclosed amount.https://www.bizjournals.com/losangeles/stories/2005/08/08/daily7.html In December 2006, James Kim, an editor at CNET, died in the Oregon wilderness. CNET hosted a memorial show and podcasts dedicated to him. On March 1, 2007, CNET announced the public launch of BNET, a website targeted towards business managers. BNET had been running under beta status since 2005. On May 15, 2008 it was announced that CBS Corporation would buy CNET Networks for US$1.8 billion. On June 30, 2008, the acquisition was completed. Former CNET properties are now part of CBS Interactive. CBS Interactive acquired many domain names originally created by CNET Networks, including download.com, downloads.com, upload.com, news.com, search.com, TV.com, mp3.com, chat.com, computers.com, shopper.com, com.com, and cnet.com. It also held radio.com until CBS Radio was sold to Entercom in 2017. On September 19, 2013 CBS Interactive launched a Spanish language sister site under the name CNET en Espa√±ol. It focuses on topics of relevance primarily to Spanish-speaking technology enthusiasts. The site offered a \\"new perspective\\" on technology and is under the leadership of managing editor Gabriel Sama. In March 2014, CNET refreshed its site by merging with CNET UK and vowing to merge all editions of the agency into a unified agency. This merge brought many changes, foremost of which would be a new user interface and the renaming of CNET TV as CNET Video. On September 14, 2020, CBS announced that it would sell CNET to Red Ventures for $500 million. Gamecenter CNET launched a website to cover video games, CNET Gamecenter, in the middle of 1996. According to the San Francisco Chronicle, it was \\"one of the first Web sites devoted to computer gaming news\\". It became a leading game-focused website; in 1999, PC Magazine named it one of the hundred-best websites in any field, alongside competitors IGN and GameSpot. According to Gamecenter head Michael Brown, the site received between 50,000 and 75,000 daily visitors by late 2000. In May 2000, CNET founded the Gamecenter Alliance network to bring Gamecenter and four partner websites, including Inside Mac Games, under one banner. Nielsen//NetRatings ranked Gamecenter the sixth-most-popular gaming website in the United States by mid-2000. On July 19, 2000, CNET made public its plan to buy Ziff-Davis and its ZDNet Internet business for $1.6 billion. Because ZDNet had partnered with SpotMedia‚Äîparent company of GameSpot‚Äîin late 1996, the acquisition brought both GameSpot and Gamecenter under CNET's ownership. Later that year, The New York Times described the two publications as the \\"Time and Newsweek of gaming sites\\". The paper reported that Gamecenter \\"seem[ed] to be thriving\\" amid the dot-com crash, with its revenue distributed across online advertising and an affiliate sales program with CNET's Game Shopper website, launched in late 1999. Following an almost $400 million loss at CNET as a result of the dot-com crash, the company ended the Gamecenter Alliance network in January 2001. On February 7, Gamecenter itself was closed in a redundancy reduction effort, as GameSpot was the more successful of the two sites. Around 190 jobs were cut from CNET during this period, including \\"at least 20\\" at Gamecenter, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. Discussing the situation, Tom Bramwell of Eurogamer reported, \\"It is thought[...] that very few if any of the website's staff will move sideways into jobs at GameSpot, now the company's other gaming asset.\\" The Washington Post later noted that Gamecenter was among the \\"popular video-game news sites\\" to close in 2001, alongside Daily Radar.  Malware infection in downloads  With a catalog of more than 400,000 titles, the Downloads section of the website allows users to download popular software. CNET's download.com provides Windows, Macintosh, and mobile software for download. CNET claims that this software is free of spyware, but independent sources have confirmed that this is not the case. While Download.com is overall a safe place to download programs, precautions should be taken before downloading from the site, as some downloads do contain malware. Dispute with Snap Technologies In 1998, CNET was sued by Snap Technologies, operators of the education service CollegeEdge, for trademark infringement relating to CNET's ownership of the domain name Snap.com, due to Snap Technologies already owning a trademark on its name. In 2005, Google representatives refused to be interviewed by all CNET reporters for a year after CNET published Google's CEO Eric Schmidt's salary and named the neighborhood where he lives, as well as some of his hobbies and political donations. All the information had been gleaned from Google searches. On October 10, 2006, Shelby Bonnie resigned as chairman and CEO, in addition to two other executives, as a result of a stock options backdating scandal that occurred between 1996 and 2003. This would also cause the firm to restate its financial earnings over 1996 to 2003 for over $105 million in resulting expenses. The Securities and Exchange Commission later dropped an investigation into the practice. Neil Ashe was named as the new CEO. In 2011, CNET and CBS Interactive were sued by a coalition of artists (led by FilmOn founder Alki David) for copyright infringement by promoting the download of LimeWire, a popular peer to peer downloading software. Although the original suit was voluntarily dropped by Alki David, he vowed to sue at a later date to bring \\"expanded\\" action against CBS Interactive. In November 2011, another lawsuit against CBS Interactive was introduced, claiming that CNET and CBS Interactive knowingly distributed LimeWire, the file sharing software. Hopper controversy In January 2013, CNET named Dish Network's \\"Hopper with Sling\\" digital video recorder as a nominee for the CES \\"Best in Show\\" award (which is decided by CNET on behalf of its organizers), and named it the winner in a vote by the site's staff. However, CBS abruptly disqualified the Hopper, and vetoed the results because the company was in active litigation with Dish Network. CNET also announced that it could no longer review any product or service provided by companies that CBS are in litigation with (which also includes Aereo). The new vote subsequently gave the Best in Show award to the Razer Edge tablet instead. Dish Network's CEO Joe Clayton said that the company was \\"saddened that CNET's staff is being denied its editorial independence because of CBS' heavy-handed tactics.\\" On January 14, 2013, editor-in-chief Lindsey Turrentine addressed the situation, stating that CNET's staff were in an \\"impossible\\" situation due to the conflict of interest posed by the situation, and promised that she would do everything within her power to prevent a similar incident from occurring again. The conflict also prompted one CNET senior writer, Greg Sandoval, to resign. The decision also drew the ire of staff from the Consumer Electronics Association, the organizers of CES; CEO Gary Shapiro criticized the decision in a USA Today op- ed column and a statement by the CEA, stating that \\"making television easier to watch is not against the law. It is simply pro-innovation and pro- consumer.\\" Shapiro felt that the decision also hurt the confidence of CNET's readers and staff, \\"destroying its reputation for editorial integrity in an attempt to eliminate a new market competitor.\\" As a result of the controversy and fearing damage to the show's brand, the CEA announced on January 31, 2013 that CNET will no longer decide the CES Best in Show award winner due to the interference of CBS (the position has been offered to other technology publications), and the \\"Best in Show\\" award was jointly awarded to both the Hopper with Sling and Razer Edge.

The oldest of the combined companies, Hellman-Haas Grocery, was founded in 1871 in Los Angeles. The company operates over 250 stores in the Western United States and 15 in northwestern Mexico. While Smart & Final stores target both the food-service and household markets, the company also operates Smart Foodservice Warehouse Stores (formerly known as Cash & Carry), which market to foodservice professionals. The stores in Mexico are operated under a joint venture with Calimax. The company is ranked 554th on the Fortune 500.  History  Founded in 1871, by Herman W. Hellman (brother of Isaias W. Hellman), Jacob Haas and Bernard Cohn, as Hellman, Haas & Co. Purchased by Abraham Haas (the original owner of the Haas Building in Downtown Los Angeles) and Jacob Baruch, and renamed Haas, Baruch & Co in 1889. By 1895, following introduction of one of the first private label store brands, Iris, the grocer's sales reached $2 million. The business continued to expand with the growing population in Southern California. Founded in 1912, the Santa Ana Grocery Company mainly supplied feed and grain to local farmers. In 1914, J. S. \\"Jim\\" Smart, a banker from Saginaw, Michigan, and H. D. \\"Hildane\\" Final bought the company and changed the name to Smart & Final Wholesale Grocers. From 1876 to 1913, Jim Smart had been involved with several wholesale grocers in the greater Saginaw area, including Lee, Cady & Smart and Smart & Symons with his brother-in-law, J. W. Symons of Symons Brothers. By 1919, annual sales for Smart & Final had reached $10 million. During the fierce competition among expanding grocers in the 1920s, the company introduced a self-serve concept to replace reliance on clerks to fetch goods. This was called \\"cash and carry.\\" In 1953, Smart & Final merged with Haas, Baruch & Co. In 1984, it was acquired by Thriftimart. In 1991, it was reorganized via a corporate spin-off and initial public offering. In 1992, it announced a joint venture with Calimax to open stores in Mexico. In 1994, it opened its first store in Mexico. In 1998, it acquired Portland, Oregon-based United Grocers Cash & Carry, which was renamed Cash & Carry. These stores are concentrated in the Pacific Northwest. In 2007, Smart & Final acquired 35 Henry's Farmers Markets in California and Sun Harvest Markets in Texas for about $166 million. In 2007, the company was acquired by Apollo Global Management. In March 2010, Smart & Final announced it would expand into the Colorado market under the SmartCo Foods brand, taking over five former Albertsons locations in the Denver metro area with plans for dozens more stores in the coming years. SmartCo stores differed from typical Smart & Final locations in that they were significantly larger and included produce, meat, and bakery departments, as well as a large selection of natural and organic foods. In June 2010, the first SmartCo Foods store opened on Parker Road in Denver, and was said to be tailored for the Colorado market. In November 2010, only five months after the chain's grand opening, SmartCo Foods announced that it was exiting the Denver market and closing all five of its stores. SmartCo Foods attributed its hasty exit from Denver to poor performance chain-wide without any hope for improvement. However, the withdrawal may have also been partially due to negotiations resulting in the February 2011 acquisition of the Sprouts Farmers Market which had 9 locations in Colorado. In 2012, Apollo sold its stake in Smart & Final to Ares Management for $975 million. Smart & Final went public in 2014. In 2015, Smart & Final purchased the leases on 32 locations previously operated by Haggen. In 2019, Apollo once again acquired the chain, for $1.1 billion. Deutsche Bank had financed the previous buyout and took a loss. On October 30, 2019, Smart & Final introduced two redesigned shopping portals for consumers and business clients. Shoppers can see weekly specials, create grocery lists, shop by recipes, and create profiles that reflect dietary allergies or preferences. Business clients can complete online orders and apply for tax exemptions.

The teleplay by Arnold Schulman is based on the best- selling 1987 non-fiction book And the Band Played On: Politics, People, and the AIDS Epidemic by Randy Shilts. The film premiered at the Montreal World Film Festival before being broadcast by HBO on September 11, 1993. It later was released in the United Kingdom, Canada, Spain, Germany, Argentina, Austria, Italy, Sweden, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Denmark, New Zealand, and Australia. The HBO movie was later aired on NBC in 1994. NBC (as well as ABC) were some of the networks considered to make a miniseries based on the book in the late 1980s, but the networks turned it down because they could not find a way to structure it as a two-night, four-hour miniseries. In 1994, NBC finally aired the movie with a parental discretion warning due to its sensitive subject matter. Plot In a prologue set in 1976, American epidemiologist Don Francis arrives in a village on the banks of the Ebola River in Zaire and discovers many of the residents and the doctor working with them have died from a mysterious illness later identified as Ebola hemorrhagic fever. It is his first exposure to such an epidemic, and the images of the dead he helps cremate will haunt him when he later becomes involved with HIV/AIDS research at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 1981, Francis becomes aware of a growing number of deaths from unexplained sources among gay men in Los Angeles, New York City and San Francisco, and is prompted to begin an in-depth investigation of the possible causes. Working with no money, limited space, and outdated equipment, he comes in contact with politicians, numerous members of the medical community (many of whom resent his involvement because of their personal agendas), and gay activists. Of the latter, some such as Bill Kraus support him, while others express resentment at what they see as unwanted interference in their lifestyles, especially in his attempts to close the local bathhouses. One day, when exercising at a local gym, Kraus notices a spot at the base of his leg, worrying that it might be Kaposi's sarcoma. After a series of blood tests, Kraus is horrified that his worst fears have been confirmed when he learns that he has been diagnosed with AIDS. While Francis pursues his theory that AIDS is caused by a sexually transmitted virus on the model of feline leukemia, he finds his efforts are stonewalled by the CDC, which is unwilling to prove the disease is transmitted through blood, and competing French and American scientists, particularly Dr. Robert Gallo. These medical researchers squabble about who should receive credit for discovering the virus. Meanwhile, the death toll climbs rapidly. Principal cast Closing montage The film closes with footage of a candlelight vigil and march in San Francisco, followed by a montage of images of numerous celebrities who have died of AIDS or were involved with HIV/AIDS education and research, accompanied by Elton John singing his \\"The Last Song.\\" The montage includes: * Bobbi Campbell * Ryan White * Rock Hudson * Anthony Perkins * Tina Chow * Rudolf Nureyev * Arthur Ashe * Michael Bennett * Liberace * Freddie Mercury * Elizabeth Glaser * Magic Johnson * Larry Kramer * Alison Gertz * Max Robinson * Halston * Willi Smith * Perry Ellis * Peter Allen * Steve Rubell * Keith Haring * Stewart McKinney * Denholm Elliott * Brad Davis * Amanda Blake * Robert Reed * Michel Foucault * Tom Waddell Critical reception Most reviewers agreed that the filmmakers had a daunting task in adapting Shilts's massive, fact-filled text into a dramatically coherent film. Many critics praised the results. Film review website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a 100% \\"Fresh\\" rating based on eight reviews. Tony Scott of Variety stated that \\"if there are lapses, director Spottiswoode's engrossing, powerful work still accomplishes its mission: Shilts's book, with all its shock, sorrow and anger, has been transferred decisively to the screen.\\" John O'Connor of The New York Times agreed that the adaptation \\"adds up to tough and uncommonly courageous television. Excessive tinkering has left the pacing of the film sluggish in spots, but the story is never less than compelling.\\" Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly graded the film B+ and called it an \\"intriguing, sometimes awkward, always earnest combination of docudrama, medical melodrama, and mystery story. The stars lend warmth to a movie necessarily preoccupied with cold research and politics, and they lend prestige: The movie must be important, since actors of this stature agreed to appear. The result of the stars' generosity, however, works against the movie by halting the flow of the drama every time a familiar face pops up on screen. The emotions and agony involved in this subject give Band an irresistible power, yet the movie's rhythm is choppy and the dialogue frequently stiff and clich√©d. The best compliment one can pay this TV movie is to say that unlike so many fact-based films, it does not exploit or diminish the tragedy of its subject.\\" In a review from Time Out New York, the writing team thought \\"so keen were the makers of this adaptation of Randy Shilts's best-seller to bombard us with the facts and figures of the history of AIDS that they forgot to offer a properly dramatic human framework to make us care fully about the characters.\\" The review also says that the multiple issues the film attempts to cover \\"make for a disjointed, clich√©d narrative.\\" Richard Zoglin of Time magazine wrote \\"Shilts's prodigiously researched 600-page book has been boiled down to a fact-filled, dramatically coherent, occasionally moving 2 hours and 20 minutes.

Licensed to Red Bluff, California, United States, the station is currently owned by Independence Rock Media Group. KRAC signed on the air in 1963 under the call letters KQCY (K-Quincy). The FCC granted the license for the 1370 AM frequency for daytime operation only at a paltry 500 watts (to protect the signal of KEEN, in San Jose, which was a 5,000 watt station also on 1370). KQCY was allowed to sign on at 6:00 am, but had to sign off at sunset (in winter, that meant the station went off the air at 4:45 pm). KQCY originally used a modified RCA transmitter that had been used on a naval ship during World War II. The studios and transmitter were located in East Quincy behind a bowling alley. In the late 1960s, the call letters were changed to KPCO (K-Plumas County). In the early to mid-1970s KPCO reached its greatest success. In 1976, the station moved to new state of the art studios in downtown Quincy, and a new 5000 watt transmitter was installed at the old site. From 6:00 am to 8:00 am, local host Andy Anderson, who was also Quincy‚Äôs Fire Chief, hosted a country music program. The rest of the day, programmed by Stan Castles who had large market radio experience in Texas, KPCO became a tightly formatted Top 40 radio station. Personalities who went on to radio careers elsewhere included Chris Marker and Steve Rusk. KPCO was also the primary source for daily news in Plumas County. A half-hour local newscast was broadcast each morning from 8:00 to 8:30, with a live call in talk show ‚ÄúPeople's Dialogue‚Äù from 8:30 to 9:00. There were hourly newscasts throughout the day with extended news programs at noon and 4:00 PM. News directors included Tom Guarino and Dan Adams, who went on to KHSL-TV in Chico, California and eventually on to KXTV, News10 in Sacramento for 27 years. In the early 1980s, KPCO was granted a license to broadcast full-time, and its commitment to Plumas County expanded as its signal strength increased to include much of the county. In the 1990s, longtime owner Ralph Wittick sold KPCO, which began a slow decline. As other radio stations signed on the air in Plumas County, KPCO was no longer the only choice. By the late 1990s, KPCO abandoned music and adopted a conservative talk show format. After a series of changes in ownership, KPCO went off the air in 2007. According to FCC records, the station went temporarily silent in 2007 due to financial problems. The station changed its call sign from KPCO to KRAC on August 28, 2009. The station broadcasts on a translator K277CE 92.1 licensed to Red Bluff, California.

History  The park property was donated to the state by Solomon and Hattie Chandler. The Chandlers were early settlers in Lake County, Oregon. They established their ranch in the latter part of the 19th century. By the 1920s, they were among the largest land owners in the area. At that time, their ranch extended from the north end of Abert Lake through the Valley Falls area into the Crooked Creek valley. They also owned some dispersed parcels of land in the Goose Lake Valley north of Lakeview. The Chandlers grazed large sheep herds and some cattle on their ranch.\\"Chandler State Park\\", historical information kiosk, Oregon Department of Transportation, Chandler State Park near Lakeview, Oregon, 14 July 2007.\\"Chandler Wayside State Park\\" , The Oregon Outback Scenic Byway kiosks, Lake County Chamber of Commerce, Lakeview, Oregon, 15 July 2014. Interpretive sign with park history The Chandler ranch included property on Crooked Creek. In one area along the creek, there was a stand of large ponderosa pine. These were the first large pine trees that travelers encountered when approaching the area from high desert county to the north and east. In the mid-1920s, the state highway department offered to buy the pine- covered property along the creek for use as a roadside park. Instead of selling the land, the Chandlers decided to donate the property to the State of Oregon in July 1929. The state named the park in honor of the Chandlers. In the mid-1960s, the section of Route 395 adjacent to Chandler State Wayside was relocated. As part of this project, the State of Oregon purchased additional land to expand the park and ensure convenient access from the highway. Today, the park covers and is administered by the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department.  Wildlife  Chandler State Wayside is a stop on the Basin Range and Birding Trail. Because of the park's riparian and pine forest habitats, a wide variety of bird species can be found there. In the summer, common birds include mountain chickadees, pygmy nuthatches, brown creepers, Bullock's orioles, black-headed grosbeaks, and western tanagers. There are also three sapsucker species in the area, Williamson's sapsuckers, red-naped sapsuckers, and red-breasted sapsucker. Bluejays, white-headed woodpeckers, northern pygmy owls, and long-eared owls are native to the area as well. In addition, several warbler, vireo, and sparrow varieties are common in the spring and fall during migration.\\"Chandler State Wayside\\", Basin Range and Birding Trail, Central Modoc River Center, Alturas, California, 15 July 2014.

He was the first African-American to play basketball for Manhattan College. In 1951, Kellogg, a standout 6'8\\" center, was offered a $1,000 bribe to shave points, before a game against De Paul. Although he was working for minimum wage at a frozen custard shop near campus, he refused to take it, reporting the solicitation to his coach, Kenny Norton. Norton sent him to the district attorney, Frank Hogan. To get evidence about the corruption, he wore a wire when he was again approached in a nearby bar. His whistle blowing touched off the largest college betting scandal in American history. Ultimately, the investigation involved 32 players from seven colleges and encompassed 86 games between 1947 and 1950, including three stars from the 1950 City College of New York team. CCNY (now CUNY) had won both the National Invitation Tournament and the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament, in 1950, the only time that has ever been accomplished.Junius Kellogg is dead at 71 Refused bribe in '50s scandal, New York Times, Frank Litsky, September 18, 1998.

He graduated in 1953 and began playing for the Harlem Globetrotters. In 1954, he sustained a cervical spinal cord injury in an automobile accident and was paralyzed. Three fellow Globetrotters were unscathed during the accident. Kellogg received treatment at the Veterans Administration Hospital in the Bronx, New York City, New York. He became an ardent supporter of wheelchair athletics. He coached the Pan Am Jets as well as the Brooklyn Whirlaways.

Owned by Multicultural Broadcasting, the station broadcasts programming in Vietnamese. Founded in 1948 with the call signs KXRX, the station had various music formats in its early decades. The station was locally owned for most of its first 50 years of operation except 1978 to 1991. In the 1970s, KXRX expanded its programming to include news. From 1972 to 1980 and 1987 to 1991, the station was the radio home for San Jose State University sports. After an ownership change, KXRX became KHTT in 1982 and changed its music playlist from middle of the road to current hits. In 1986, KHTT switched to oldies. KSJX has had its current call sign since 1989, when it launched a business news format. In 1992, KSJX began broadcasting in Vietnamese. Multicultural Broadcasting bought KSJX in 1998. History =As KXRX (1948‚Äì1982)= AM 1500 signed on the air June 24, 1948 with the call letters KXRX and 1,000 watts of power, founded by the San Jose Broadcasting Company. In 1949, KXRX was part of the San Francisco 49ers radio network. KXRX played exclusively pop LPs by late 1957. From 1956 to 1958, KXRX had daytime power of 10,000 watts before reverting to 1,000; the daytime power again was upgraded in 1960, this time to 5,000 watts. In 1964, KXRX boosted its power to 10,000 watts in daytime and 5,000 watts at night, where it remains today. KXRX broadcast programming related to San Jose State College (later University) throughout the 1960s and 1970s. In 1960, KXRX debuted Spartan Salute, a nightly, hour-long program featuring news reports, interviews, and music targeted towards San Jose State students. Beginning in the fall of 1966, KXRX broadcast Spartan Spectrum, a nightly news summary produced by the San Jose State radio/television news department that aired 10 minutes before 8 p.m. In 1972, KXRX began broadcasting San Jose State Spartans football games. As of 1973, KXRX had a news format. By 1974, KXRX broadcast live, locally produced news in mornings from 5:30 to 9:15 a.m. and afternoons from 4 to 6:15 p.m., with oldies the rest of the day. By the late 1970s, KXRX broadcast The Wall Street Journal Business Report, a syndicated business news show. San Jose Broadcasting sold KXRX in 1978 to the Seattle-based Sterling Recreation Organization, a company with holdings in movie theaters and bowling alleys in addition to radio stations.https://fccdata.org/?lang=en&facid;=4118&hview;=1 With new ownership came programming changes. Following the 1979 season, KXRX lost San Jose State football broadcasting rights to San Francisco's KCBS. Although KXRX offered $1,000 more for the 1980 season, KCBS out-bid KXRX with a contract that rose by $2,000 per year. San Jose State men's athletic director Dave Adams also cited KCBS having a far stronger signal and ratings. In 1981, KXRX switched to a middle of the road music format. =As KHTT (1982‚Äì1989)= On September 7, 1982, KXRX changed its call sign to KHTT.Call sign history With a new \\"K-Hit\\" brand, the format switched to current hits. Sterling Recreation sold KHTT on July 10, 1985 to Narragansett Broadcasting Company based in Providence, Rhode Island. Citing low ratings and competition from FM stations, Narragansett switched KHTT's format in October 1985 from current hits to 1960s oldies. KHTT began carrying Santa Clara University and San Jose State University men's basketball games in the 1985‚Äì86 season. However, lack of advertising caused an initial broadcast rights deal with Southern California company ROWW Enterprises to be cancelled, so only by December 1985 could KHTT secure a deal with San Jose State to broadcast basketball games; it was the first time since 1983 that San Jose State basketball was broadcast on commercial radio. Ken Korach, who would later become the Oakland A's radio play-by-play announcer, was San Jose State's announcer at the time. In November 1986, local printing business owner and San Jose State alum Jerry Erich financed a new contract for both San Jose State and Santa Clara basketball for KHTT as negotiations were breaking down. In 1987, KHTT won the rights to live San Jose State football broadcasts after the contract of San Francisco station KCBS expired; for the 1986 season, KCBS carried most games on tape delay due to conflicts with Stanford games. After delays due to a possible sale of the station, KHTT signed a new contract with San Jose State to broadcast all football and basketball games in June 1988. =As KSJX (1989‚Äìpresent)= On March 1, 1989, the station picked up its current call letters KSJX and a business news format. That format lasted only around one year before KSJX became a simulcast of FM sister station KSJO, an album-oriented rock station, in 1990. In March 1991, KSJX dropped the simulcast of KSJO for its own modern rock format branded \\"X-Rock 1500\\". The following month, KSJX lost the San Jose State sports broadcast rights to rival station KLIV, due to KSJX carrying only 20 of the previous season's 27 basketball games. KSJX returned to local ownership for the first time since the late 1970s in November 1991, when Narragansett Broadcasting sold the station to Baycom San Jose. KSJX began its current Vietnamese format in 1992.http://www.vienthao.com/media/vienthao-media-kit.pdf Douglas Broadcasting, based in nearby Palo Alto, bought KSJX for $2.1 million in February 1995. In January 1998, Douglas Broadcasting sold KSJX and San Francisco-based KEST to New York City-based Multicultural Broadcasting. In March 1999, KSJX began carrying a Sunday night LGBT talk show S·ªëng Th·∫≠t hosted by Vuong Nguyen. Vietnamese tonal marks are taken from the show's website. A 2003 San Jose Mercury News profile described the show as \\"intentionally aimed at educating the older and more conservative generation of immigrants who are probably the most averse to hearing the show.\\" Nguyen and her radio program have won local awards.

Licensed to San Jose, California, KZSF serves the San Francisco Bay Area and has a regional Mexican music format branded \\"La Kaliente 1370 AM.\\" The station has been owned by Carlos A. Duharte since 2001. For much of its history, KZSF has been a music radio station. Founded by George Mardikian and United Broadcasting Company, the station signed on with call sign KEEN in 1947 and operated out of the historic Hotel De Anza in San Jose for its first 27 years. After beginning with a general full service format, KEEN became a country and western station in the mid-1950s and would retain that format for over 35 years, with performers such as Red Murrell and Foy Willing among its on-air hosts. KEEN also featured live sports coverage; it broadcast the San Jose State Spartans and Santa Clara Broncos in the late 1950s and throughout the 1960s and the Oakland Athletics during the early to mid-1970s. In 1993, KEEN went silent for several months after losing its transmitter license and returned to the air in 1994 as KKSJ and a pop standards format branded \\"Magic 1370.\\" Founding owner United Broadcasting sold the station in 1997. After one year with an Asian ethnic format, KKSJ became KZSF in 1998 and took on its present regional Mexican music format. KZSF would be sold twice more in the late 1990s before finally being purchased by Duharte in 2001. History =As KEEN (1947‚Äì1993)= Founded by United Broadcasting Company, whose president was George Mardikian, KZSF came on the air in 1947 as a 1,000 watt station with call sign KEEN and a transmitter on a North San Jose orchard near the town border with Milpitas. KEEN was first granted a construction permit by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in 1945.History Cards for KZSF, fcc.gov. Retrieved June 22, 2018.https://fccdata.org/?facid=&call;=KZSF At 8 p.m. on June 21, 1947, KEEN's grand opening broadcast took place at the Hotel De Anza in Downtown San Jose and featured comedian Red Skelton. Two months later, KEEN was officially licensed by the FCC on August 21. In its early years, KEEN broadcast a full service format with popular music, news, and sports. Programming included news from the United Press, Saturday night barn dances, and University of Santa Clara baseball games. By 1954, KEEN had a country and western music format featuring hosts like Red Murrell, Cal Smith, and Foy Willing. KEEN began broadcasting San Jose State College football games in 1956. On September 19, 1957, KEEN was granted a license for a new transmitter with a stronger daytime broadcasting power of 5,000 watts. By 1960, KEEN added San Jose State basketball. The following year, KEEN began broadcasting select Santa Clara basketball games. In 1963, United Broadcasting launched a sister station that played pop standards, KEEN-FM, on 100.3 MHz. KEEN began broadcasting at its current power level of 5,000 watts at both day and night on August 26, 1964. By 1966, KEEN began playing selections from comedy records in addition to country music. The two KEEN stations no longer shared call letters in 1967, as KEEN-FM became KBAY. KEEN expanded its live sports play-by-play to include Santa Clara football in 1969. The 1970s marked several changes for KEEN. Murrell left KEEN in 1970 after 16 years. After the 1970‚Äì71 season, KEEN phased out its live college sports coverage in favor of pro sports. Santa Clara sports broadcasts moved to Los Altos FM station KPEN, and San Jose State broadcasts also moved to FM on Santa Clara's KREP. From 1971 to 1975, KEEN was the flagship station of the Oakland A's Radio Network. KEEN also broadcast California Golden Seals games until the team moved out of the Bay Area in 1976. After over 25 years operating out of Hotel De Anza, United Broadcasting moved the KEEN and KBAY to West San Jose in 1974, on the top floor of the Golden Pacific Building at Winchester Boulevard. By 1976, KEEN began playing newer country singles on weekday afternoons while focusing on classic country for the rest of the day. Following a request filed in 1979, the FCC approved the relocation of KEEN's studios to Campbell in 1982.FCC Application Search Details: BML-19820104AH (click \\"Public Notice Comment\\") By January 1992, KEEN faced declining ratings and advertising revenue due to competition from FM stations, including new FM country station KRTY. These factors led United Broadcasting to announce that KEEN would be a simulcast of easy listening FM sister station KBAY. However, following much feedback from listeners and advertisers, United Broadcasting reversed this decision. However, beginning April 1 that year, KEEN cut its on-air staff to three hosts during daytime hours and broadcast syndicated music by satellite in other time slots. KEEN went off the air on January 1, 1993, after losing its transmitter lease a month earlier as the city of San Jose planned to build nearly 250 houses in the area. =As KKSJ (1993‚Äì1998)= On October 11, 1993, KEEN became KKSJ. After United Broadcasting made an arrangement for KKSJ to share the transmitter site near U.S. Highway 101, a Union Pacific Railroad overpass, and an Eggo factory with fellow San Jose AM station KSJX, KKSJ resumed broadcasting in 1994 with the brand \\"Magic 1370\\" and a pop standards format inspired by the former \\"Magic 61\\" brand of San Francisco's KFRC. \\"Magic 1370\\" had a playlist from a 1,700-song library, including nearly 175 Frank Sinatra songs and others by artists including Ella Fitzgerald and Tony Bennett. Jim Lange, former KFRC DJ and host of The Dating Game, joined KKSJ as a weekend host. KKSJ rose from being unranked in the winter 1994 Arbitron Bay Area ratings to a 2.9 share by the fall of 1994. Lange left KKSJ in 1996. In January 1997, United Broadcasting sold KKSJ and KBAY to American Radio Systems for a combined $31.2 million. American Radio subsequently laid off two hosts and dropped the locally programmed music for the syndicated Stardust music service. American Radio sold KKSJ to Douglas Broadcasting for $3.2 million in June 1997 and changed it to an Asian ethnic format with Vietnamese and Cantonese programming. =As KZSF (1998‚Äìpresent)= On January 20, 1998, the station changed its call sign to the current KZSF and entered a local marketing agreement to be a San Francisco Bay Area affiliate of Amador Bustos's Z-Spanish Radio Network of regional Mexican music stations, alongside sister station KZSF-FM in Alameda. Bustos bought KZSF and five other stations from Douglas Broadcasting for $27 million in June 1998. For the first time since 1982 as KEEN, KZSF operated in San Jose, with a new location at Wooster Avenue near North San Jose. In June 2001, Carlos Duharte bought KZSF for $5 million and relocated the station to Tisch Way in West San Jose. With its 1998 change to regional Mexican, KZSF added Spanish-language broadcasts of local sports teams, the San Francisco Giants baseball team and San Jose Clash (later Earthquakes) soccer team.https://web.archive.org/web/19981207002003/http://www.clash.com/schedule/index.html However, the number of Giants games on the station declined from 81 home games in 1999 and 2000 to 40 in 2001 due to the Giants' inability to find advertisers. After a hiatus, KZSF resumed Spanish broadcasts of Earthquakes games in 2004 and 2005 before resuming the broadcasts long term beginning in 2010.

A self-engineered and produced album, it took two and a half years to complete. The album was conceived as a tube journey through London; every song was a 'stop on the line' and dealt with Chris' experiences of the city, both personal and professional. The album was mastered in May 2006 by well-known engineer Geoff Pesche (Coldplay, Gorillaz, Kylie Minogue) at Abbey Road Studios, London and was released in the UK and Ireland in September 2006 by Right Track/Universal Music Operations. Given the association between the album and the tube, the launch event for the album took place on the London Underground in August 2006 and attracted coverage from ITV News and BBC Radio. \\"Twisted City\\" received a warm welcome from rock critics, receiving positive reviews from The Irish Times, Hotpress, Clash Magazine and The Daily Express amongst others. Although Chris Singleton is an Irish artist, Twisted City takes as its main influences classic English rock. Particular influences include The Beatles (see 'Pieces' and 'Wherever'), T.Rex (in particular, 'Gimme Something'), David Bowie ('Worry Number One') and The Stone Roses ('The Only One'). As a result of these influences, the album arguably has more of a 'rock band' sound to it than those of other contemporary Irish singer- songwriters. 'Twisted City' as free download Following the release of Radiohead's 'In Rainbows,' Chris Singleton decided in late 2007 to experiment with a similar model of distribution for the album by making it temporarily available as a free download. Upon signing up to receive news updates, and recommending the album to their friends, visitors to could download the album at no cost. The record was made available on a microsite which featured a flash-programmed 'virtual tape' which people clicked on receive their album. 'Twisted City Tour' In January 2008 Chris added an additional component to the free download of the album, by providing a downloadable guidebook to accompany it. The guidebook, containing a list of the locations which inspired the album, enabled listeners to go on a 'Twisted City Tour', where they visited each of the album's \\"stops\\" and played the relevant track on an MP3 player. Singles There were four singles released from 'Twisted City' in 2006 and 2007.

The station is currently owned and operated by the California State University, Monterey Bay. On April 5, 2017 CSUMB filed applications with the Federal Communications Commission to purchase the licenses of the K207CN (Santa Cruz), K217EK (Palo Colorado Canyon) and K237EV (Big Sur Valley) translators owned by KUSP. The purchase price was $5,000. The applications were consummated on June 30, 2017 and July 7, 2017. History =Established= KAZU began broadcasting in August 1977 from an upstairs office in downtown Pacific Grove. The station was started in hopes of being a local community radio station, with a focus on the south Monterey Bay cities. The station operated with 10 watts, and had about 90 volunteers who ran the on-air operation; a small board of directors oversaw the fiscal and legal operations of the corporation that owned KAZU was called The Great Silence Broadcasting Foundation. =Wider broadcast= Because of the low power, the reach was limited, so the station signal was added to the Monterey cable system in 1978. The transmitter was relocated to Hidden Hills, east of Monterey in 1980, and coverage was expanded to reach the entire Monterey Bay area. Programming and volunteer participation expanded as well, and the station migrated to larger studios in the same building in the mid-1980s. =Fire and relocation= A fire at the studio in the late 1990s briefly put KAZU off the air. Temporary studios were quickly built and the station moved out of downtown Pacific Grove to Lighthouse Avenue in Pacific Grove. After a series of managers and program directors, the station struggled to survive high rents for the new studios and the old transmitter site. The locally produced music and talk programming remained popular with the community, but financial support did not grow sufficiently to cover the new expenses. =Financial collapse= In the late 1990s, the fiscal situation worsened, and cuts to staff were made. A new manager was hired in 1998, and plans were made to change the station to an NPR/PRI affiliate and reduce volunteer programming. The station was still unable to continue financially, so the board planned to give the station to an outside third-party non-profit. Both KUSP in Santa Cruz, and Cal State University Monterey Bay (CSUMB) offered to take over KAZU operations. The board chose CSUMB. Further programming changes were made and by 2002, all volunteers were removed from programming. In 2008, KAZU relocated to the campus of CSUMB.

He was later appointed by then-Oregon governor Neil Goldschmidt to oversee a plan to double the state's inmate capacity as director of Oregon's Department of Corrections. On January 18, 1989, his body was discovered outside the department's office building in Salem; an autopsy determined he had been murdered the night before. A local petty criminal was eventually tried and convicted for the crime, and sentenced to life in prison without parole. However, the convicted killer maintains his innocence, and several conspiracy theories have been advocated, claiming that the killing was a murder for hire conducted by corrupt state prison officials threatened by an investigation Francke was conducting into prison mismanagement. A 1995 film Without Evidence, written by Gil Dennis and Phil Stanford, an Oregon columnist who has investigated the case extensively, was based on the Francke murder and subsequent investigations by Kevin Francke, Michael's brother. The Association of State Correctional Administrators annually awards the Michael Francke Award to the top corrections administrator in the United States. Early life and education Francke, a native of Kansas City, Missouri, attended New Mexico Highlands University on a football scholarship, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in a combined major of political science, economics, German, and French. He then attended the University of Virginia Law School on a scholastic scholarship, graduating with a law degree in 1971, and was subsequently admitted to the Virginia bar. For the next three years, he served as a judge advocate general in the United States Navy, at Long Beach Naval Station. Career In 1975, he was admitted to the bar in New Mexico, and worked as an assistant attorney general and counsel to the New Mexico Corrections Department. He served in this capacity until 1980, when he became a judge for the First District Court in Santa Fe. He served as a judge for three years, and in 1983 became the director of the New Mexico Department of Corrections. In May 1987, Oregon governor Neil Goldschmidt hired Francke to fill the corresponding position in Oregon. He was hired with a remit to address problems in the state's Department of Corrections (ODOC). During his tenure, he had been criticized by some in the Oregon Legislature for cost overruns and delays in a state prison construction program. Murder The Dome Building Early on the morning of January 18, 1989, a security guard found Francke's body lying in a pool of blood on the floor of the North Portico of the Dome Building (the headquarters office of ODOC, not to be confused with the Oregon State Capitol building) in Salem. An autopsy revealed the cause of death to be a stab wound to the heart suffered the night before, and also revealed other \\"defensive wounds\\". Francke was last seen alive by Dome Building staff at approximately 6:45 p.m. on January 17. Two senior staff leaving the Dome Building approximately 40 minutes later discovered his car parked in its designated spot outside the front entryway with the driver's door open. No obvious signs of forced entry on the vehicle were observed. The staffers locked and closed the car door, and returned to the Dome Building where they made numerous phone calls to other senior staffers in an effort to determine Francke's whereabouts, all to no avail. Security was notified at the nearby Communications Center, and the staffers left the Dome Building at approximately 8:05 p.m. Two other senior staffers, Richard Peterson, head of Institutions, and David Caulley, head of Planning and Budget, arrived at approximately 8:35 p.m. and conducted what they described as a meticulous search of the Dome Building, but found nothing amiss. They returned to their homes on the presumption that Francke was at a private dinner engagement. Police were never notified of the situation until the guard discovered the body nearly four hours later. Given the nature of Francke's work, the possibility that the murder was a \\"hit\\" was immediately considered. An investigation commenced, and fifteen months later, Frank Gable, a small-time methamphetamine dealer, was charged with the crime. A local teen runaway named Jodie Swearingen testified before a grand jury that she had witnessed the murder; police reports indicate that she had identified Gable as the perpetrator. She later recanted her testimony, instead claiming that another Salem drug dealer, Timothy Natividad, was the murderer. At the trial, the state produced several witnesses (all of whom were criminal associates of Gable) who claimed that Gable confessed the crime to them after the fact. Swearingen was called to testify by the prosecution at the trial. No physical evidence was produced; however the prosecution was allowed to introduce as evidence a knife (purchased by investigators) which matched Francke's wounds; Gable's ex-wife testified that she had given Gable a similar knife. On June 27, 1991, Gable was convicted of six counts of aggravated murder and one count of murder. He was sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole. Gable continues to maintain his innocence. In October 2014, the Federal Public Defender's Office sought to reopen the case on appeal. On April 18, 2019, U.S. Magistrate Judge John Acosta ruled that Frank Gable must be retried or released within 90 days, noting among other trial issues that many witnesses presented have since recanted, and that their testimony was obtained via coercive interrogation tactics and polygraph examinations. On June 28, 2019, Gable was released from prison. Conspiracy theories Former state treasurer Jim Hill does not accept the official verdict, believing either that Gable is altogether innocent of the crime, or that he, or another perpetrator was a hired hit man rather than a chance car burglar. The Francke family, led by Francke's brother Kevin Francke, have also publicly expressed doubts about the official conclusions. Kevin Francke has claimed that prior to his death, Michael Francke warned him of a threat on his life, and told him that he had discovered a network of corruption in the department. There are several theories as to who may have been the killer or killers, and who may have ordered a \\"hit\\" on Francke. Most alternate theories of the case propose Timothy Natividad (who was killed two weeks after the Francke murder) as the person who stabbed Francke. Theories as to who may have been behind the killing focus on two men high in the corrections hierarchy. One individual who has been named is Hoyt Cupp, the former warden of the Oregon State Penitentiary; in 2007, a convicted felon gave a series of interviews to Willamette Week in which he claimed that he witnessed Cupp and another (unnamed) corrections official pay Natividad $20,000; and that Natividad later informed him it was payment for killing Francke. Cupp died of cancer in 1990. Another individual who has been named is Scott McAlister, who had been the assistant attorney general for the state of Oregon until he resigned shortly before Francke's death. McAlister subsequently became Inspector General of the Utah corrections department. An ex-girlfriend of McAlister told the Portland Tribune that McAlister had been in possession of internal police documents concerning the murder that he no longer had had any official reason to possess, and that she had overheard McAlister describe the killing as a \\"botched hit that was supposed to look like a suicide\\". The McAlister theory gained credence in October 1991, when one of the private investigators who had worked on the Gable defense team, H. Wayne Holm, was killed by a Multnomah County Sheriff's deputy, Brian Martinek (now an assistant chief of the Portland Police Bureau), allegedly during a \\"reverse sting\\" drug operation. Holm, who had been a former inmate in the Oregon Correction system during the early 1980s, had assisted numerous other inmates with parole hearing presentations, and had known Scott McAlister, who represented the Parole and Probation Board during those hearings. Holm had offered the theory that the primary motivation for Francke's murder was that he had discovered a plot by McAlister to \\"sell\\" paroles to inmates. Adding to the mix was the fact that the person who had been appointed to fill Francke's office after his death in 1997 had been Fred Pierce, the longtime Sheriff of Multnomah County, and the man who had originally hired Martinek. Much speculation has centered on a mysterious \\"man in the pinstriped suit\\", an unknown individual who was spotted by a corrections employee inside the corrections Dome Building, 90 minutes after closing time. The individual has never been identified. Another Dome Building employee, who worked as a Parole Board clerk, has stated the man in the pinstriped suit also matches the description she gave to police as the man who arrived at the Dome Building the day of the murder to repair the copy machine late in the afternoon, and was granted unprecedented access to remain in the building after hours to complete the repairs. The repairs were never completed, the machine was left in pieces, and neither the man in the pinstriped suit or Dennis Plante, the man who testified he was the copy machine repairman (but whom the Parole Board clerk states was not the man who worked on the copier), returned to complete the repairs, nor was any record of the service call found in the copier 'repair log' after the murder. Whether or not the individual has any relation to the killing is unknown, the individual does not resemble Gable. Dale Penn, who oversaw Gable's prosecution while serving as Marion County district attorney, stated in 2007 that he had \\"every confidence that Frank Gable [was] guilty and that this story (the Willamette Week article) [was] not true\\". Press coverage The case has become somewhat of a battleground between the three leading Portland newspapers, with The Oregonian backing the official version of what happened, and its rivals, the Portland Tribune and (to a lesser extent) the Willamette Week questioning the official record. In May 2005, the Oregonian published the results of an investigation into the case, which concluded that Gable was indeed the killer, and that the killing was a robbery gone wrong. The Tribune ran a rebuttal, claiming to have uncovered holes in the Oregonian's reporting, which was followed by a further rebuttal by the Oregonian reporters in the newspaper's blog. A leading advocate of the conspiracy theory is local journalist Phil Stanford. Stanford has written extensively on the case, and wrote the screenplay for a film based on the Francke murder, Without Evidence (1995), featuring a young Angelina Jolie, in one of her first major roles, as Jodie Swearingen. Ernie Garrett portrayed Francke. Stanford, then a columnist for The Oregonian, testified in the trial for the defense. He continued writing about the case in his Oregonian column until leaving the paper in 1994; he now writes for the Portland Tribune and continues to cover the case there. In February 1991, prior to Gable's conviction, the Michael Francke story was featured on an episode of the TV program Unsolved Mysteries. The case was also the subject of a 2019 true crime podcast called Murder in Oregon, produced by iHeartRadio.

Gem√§ldegalerie, Berlin The Wine Glass (also The Glass of Wine or Lady and Gentleman Drinking Wine, ) is a 1660 painting by Johannes Vermeer now in the Gem√§ldegalerie, Berlin. It portrays a seated woman and a standing man drinking in an interior setting. The work contains the conventions of genre painting of the Delft School developed by Pieter de Hooch in the late 1650s. It contains figures situated in a brightly lit and spacious interior, while its architectural space is highly defined. The figures are set in the middle ground, rather than positioned in the foreground.Wheelock, 68 The painting Pieter de Hooch, A Dutch Courtyard, circa 1657 Vermeer was about 27 when he painted The Glass of Wine, and according to the critic Walter Liedtke, \\"No analysis of artistic conventions can suggest the sheer beauty and extraordinary refinement of a painting like The Glass of Wine, which may be considered one of Vermeer's first fully mature works\\".Liedtke, 376-378 The concept of figures drinking around a table, and the portrayal of a woman drinking from a glass are taken directly from De Hooch's A Dutch Courtyard. However, Vermeer's work breaks away from the prototypes of De Hooch in that the interior is rendered in a far more elegant and higher-class setting than the older master's works. The clothes of the figures, the patterned tablecloth, the gilded picture frame hanging on the back wall, and the coat of arms in the stained window glass all suggest a wealthier setting. Johannes Vermeer, The Girl with the Wine Glass (1659‚Äì1660) The scene likely represents some type of courtship, but the roles being played by the two figures are not clear. The woman has just drained the glass of wine and the man seems impatient to pour her more, almost as if he is trying to get her drunk. A musical instrument, the cittern, lies on the chair with musical notebooks. But the figure of Temperance is depicted in the stained glass window, adding to the tension in the scene. Compared to his earlier paintings, Vermeer's brushwork in The Wine Glass is subdued, while the faces and clothes of the figures are depicted with wide smooth outlines. Only in the tapestry of the tablecloth and the window glass did the artist apply finely detailed, linear brush strokes. At the time Vermeer was not the only Dutch artist attempting to develop the ideas of De Hooch; contemporary paintings from Jan Steen, Gerard Ter Borch, and Frans van Mieris the Elder also display a refined technique. The painting shares elements with other Vermeer works. The Girl with the Wine Glass (1659‚Äì1660) portrays two men, but in common with The Wine Glass it has a woman seated at a table with a glass of wine, and the tiled floors and stained-glass windows in both are very similar. The same wine pitcher appears in an earlier Vermeer, A Girl Asleep (1657). The Wine Glass is a transitional work, and as such, is not commonly viewed as one of Vermeer's finest. According to art critic Lawrence Gowing, comparing the work with Gabriel Metsu's The Duet, it \\"lacks the sociable fluency, the ingratiating inventiveness\\".Quoted in Notes Bibliography *Gowing, Lawrence.

El dirigente m√°s destacado de este grupo, durante sus primeros tiempos, fue Antonio Guiteras, bajo cuya influencia se convirti√≥ en un movimiento pol√≠tico que desarroll√≥ una l√≠nea de enfrentamiento directo contra la dictadura. Guiteras, no obstante, no entendi√≥ nunca las caracter√≠sticas de la sublevaciones campesinas protagonizadas por l√≠deres como el expresado Blas Hern√°ndez.

Paralelamente, se consolid√≥ en la comarca fronteriza de Las Villas y el Camag√ºey la que podr√≠amos definir como la oposici√≥n tradicional en el campo.

It is located at 6306 Germantown Avenue and is a contributing property of the Colonial Germantown Historic District, which is also a National Historic Landmark. It is operated today as a museum open to the public. History Philadelphia, especially its Germantown section, was a center of the 19th- century American movement to abolish slavery, and the Johnson House was one of the key sites of that movement. Between 1770 and 1908, the house was the residence of five generations of the Johnson family. The third generation was active in the Underground Railroad during the 1850s. Along with their respective spouses, Rowland, Israel, Ellwood, Sarah, and Elizabeth Johnson were members of abolitionist groups such as the American Anti-Slavery Society and the Germantown Freedman's Aid Association. Through their associations with these groups, the brothers and sisters became involved in the Underground Railroad and used their home, along with the nearby homes of relatives, to harbor fugitive slaves on their journeys to freedom. The Johnson House is a representative station on the Underground Railroad, and the Johnsons were among the leading abolitionists of their generation. The house, then one of the largest in Germantown (then a suburb of Philadelphia), was built between 1765 and 1768 by Jacob Norr for Dirck Jansen, who owned the ground on which nearby Upsala was built. Jansen had it built for his son John Johnson, Sr. During the 1777 Battle of Germantown, fighting occurred nearby and the house still bears marks of musket balls and cannonballs.

Voices were provided by Tim Dann, Rupert Degas, Peter Dickson, Keith Wickham, and Kate O'Sullivan. The first series aired during the second series of the children's Saturday morning show TMi on BBC Two in 2007. A second series was produced in 2010 and was aired as part of Sam & Mark's TMi Friday on the CBBC Channel.  Recurring gags  In Hedz, there are half-minute to a minute short gags, which are similar in one way or another for each character(s). * For Russell Brand, he says his catchphrase \\"... if I tell a lie, let me beautiful barnet sprout forth!\\" at the beginning of his sketch, and then tells a series of lies, causing his hair to grow abnormally large. After three lies, he trips on his hair and falls down, ending the gag with \\"Betrayed by my own barnet!\\". * For Orlando Bloom and Johnny Depp, they share a bath, where they play, argue and talk. By the end of the gag, Johnny Depp somehow causes Orlando Bloom to get out of the bathtub. However, at times Orlando gets his own back on Johnny (e.g. throwing Johnny's paper hat into the bath, causing it to go soggy and sink) * For Simon Cowell, he first sneaks into his shed, where he tells Cat Deeley (who is in the form of a white cat) to \\"... bring me [Simon] the leaders of the free world!\\", causing Deeley to press a red button, bringing George W. Bush, Condoleezza Rice, Queen Elizabeth II, Gordon Brown, Romano Prodi and Bob Geldof onto H.Q.-like screens. After which he explains his \\"brilliant\\" plan, usually on the effects of global warming, where the leaders go wild in its sheer flawlessness (at the middle of Cowell's speech, Deeley explains the crucial flaws). After the pitch of his idea Cowell raises up his hands and goes, \\"For I am a genius!\\" When he does this a button loosens from Simon's trousers, so they fall down (revealing his boxer shorts) and is sprayed down with something got to do with his idea (e.g. if the plan contained toilet paper, toilet paper will rain down onto him), making the leaders laugh. Another ironic touch is that Deeley speaks in meows, with her words displayed as subtitles, and Cowell cannot understand her, although guesses she is positive about the idea, e.g. \\"Are you ready for my brilliant plan, Cat?\\" \\"No!\\" \\"I knew you would be, Cat.\\" On his shed is a sign which says, 'Simon's shed keep out'. Already we can see Simon is not very bright; he writes the 'p' backwards. * For Ant & Dec, they spot another celebrity couple from their tree house \\"oh Ant, can you see out?\\" and decide to set a trap for them \\"there's only room for ONE celebrity duo in this forest!\\", which fails. Afterwards, Ant gets caught by the same trap. The celebrity duos have included Davina McCall/Dermot O'Leary, Barry/Paul Chuckle, Mary-Kate/Ashley Olsen, Arlene Phillips/Bruno Tonioli and Kylie/Dannii Minogue * For David Tennant, he is doing something that rhymes with Who (As in Doctor Who). E.g. - he is sitting on a snooker cue and says 'I'm doctor cue!', or appearing twice and saying 'I'm doctor two!'. * Arnold Schwarzenegger owns a video shop and the sketch always features a celebrity requesting a DVD of a movie starring that celebrity. However, Schwarzenegger will only sell them movies starring himself. The celebrity will proceed to attack Arnold in some way, only to be defeated by Arnold. After the celebrity leaves, an Arnold Schwarzenegger 'Bobble Head' says, 'They'll be back'. The only time Arnold has lost to a celebrity is when Anne Hathaway kissed him, turning him into a robotic frog. * For Daniel Craig on a Boot Camp, an army of Daniel Craigs march and sing a song with the lyrics \\"We're competing day by day, 'til there's just one Daniel Craig\\" when drill sergeant Graham Norton suddenly jumps in and yells \\"SHUT UP!\\" Sgt. Norton informs the Daniel Craig's that they are at the camp competing for the role of 007 and so he sets the Daniel Craigs a task to survive as secret agents and warns them that the one who doesn't perform well enough will be eliminated and then Graham yells \\"Do I make myself clear?!\\" One Daniel Craig who is ironically portrayed as the odd-one-out wears a Pink Bow Tie and keeps annoying Graham by asking stupid questions \\"oh, could your write it down for me sir?\\" and always leaves Norton yelling \\"What in the name of International Espionage do you think you're doing? You are the weakest Daniel Craig, good-bye!\\" * Gordon Brown is portrayed as \\"Mr. Brown\\", who lives at 10 Downing Street in a \\"Brown, Brown House in a Brown, Brown Street\\". Brown \\"has a country to run and is a very serious man...but then Mr.Brown does naughty things in the Brown, Brown House\\" and eventually breaks something, which is always followed by the narrator calling Brown a \\"silly man\\" and telling him to go to his room. Ex-Prime Minister Tony Blair has a cameo as the famous policeman who stands outside No.10 and usually gets covered in whatever Brown is messing about with. * Formula 1 race driver Lewis Hamilton is portrayed as a man driving a Scalextric car around a track in a playroom. He then races against other celebrities such as Jackie Chan who try and cheat but fail, always resulting in Hamilton winning the race and spraying champagne everywhere. * Celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay refers to himself in the third person and tries his best to accomplish even the simplest of tasks and when he makes a mishap it makes him mad and his face glows red with anger but he manages to calm himself down a couple of times but on his third mishap he gets so angry his face blows up and he says \\"Doh!, worst (whatever he is doing) ever, done!\\". * For the Queen Elizabeth II, she is doing her laundry and Robbie Williams plays the angel. * For Billie Piper she is portrayed as a \\"fair maiden in distress\\" though she always argues with the narrator when he describes the simple problem she is in. The Narrator then tells the audience who will save her? \\"Golfing legend, turned outlaw Tiger Hood!\\" (Tiger Woods) who suddenly jumps into the scene in a fanfare and proceeds to help Billie by firing his golf clubs at the obstacle although she argues that he can make it so much easier for both of them if he just solves the problem without using his clubs! This distraction causes Tiger to lose his concentration and when he fires his clubs they always miss hit their target and bounce off objects and usually end up hitting Tiger in the face and then he takes out his putter and fires it (over Billie's continuous protests) and that too misses its target, bounces off trees and hits Billie in the face! Tiger then says he's either had enough or goes off to find his clubs leaving Billie fuming over the narrator's annoying speech \\"and so once again, Tiger Hood has saved the day!\\" Then the book closes, and Billie protests until the book is closed and she is silenced. The only time when this is the opposite is when Billie's fire was put out, and she wanted the lid to be closed so she could keep warm. * For Jackie Chan, he stars in a show called 'Jackie Can', which sees him performing incredibly simple acts such as opening a door or turning on a light, however he uses somersaults and Kung-fu moves to do so. At the end, after something goes wrong (e.g. tripping over his own shoelaces, opening a door with brooms propped against it, resulting in the brooms falling onto him) he usually says 'Remember kids, don't try this at home!' * For McFly, their cue is four flies flying around along with a buzzing noise. Sometimes there is a 'One Two Three Four' before they burst into song. McFly are the only characters in Hedz who sing with squeaky voices. Apart from Cat Deeley, they are the other animal characters in the form of four flies in different colours; yellow (Danny), blue (Tom), green (Dougie), and red (Harry). All but Harry are seen holding guitars, but Harry holds a drum. At the end, one member of McFly hits their head on the camera and a ring of stars appear above their heads before they drop out of the frame. Sometimes an 'ouch' can be heard. * For Beyonc√©, she is first seen as an ordinary cleaner until her pink phone beeps. Once she hears the crisis, she instantly turns into a pop princess with a silver B on her bum. She normally says, \\"Me and my booty go save that cutie\\" before rushing off to the crisis. She uses her bum to shake things free (e.g. the ball from the basketball hoop, Cat Deely from the tree). After whoever she was helping says thank you she often replies with \\"I'm Beyonc√© usin' my butt to save yours!\\" Then she rushes off. Beyonc√© is always heard talking in rhymes. * For 8 episodes, celebrities big in the pop world are squashed by the Phantom Flattener. Ozzy and Sharon Osbourne read the newspaper and find out about the flattened pop star. They visit the scene of the crime before spotting the Flattener. Then they chase him down the same route, stopping half way at a bus stop, where Kelly and Jack Osbourne are. The family chases the Flattener, who normally escapes. During the last episode, they change tactics and trick the Flattener before unmasking the fiend, who is really Charlotte Church. * For Len Goodman, Arlene Phillips and Bruno Tonioli, they are sitting down as a family eating dinner. Len asks for an item, and Arlene and Bruno both put their hands on the item. This triggers them dancing to music and a disco ball. We can hear Len Goodman making comments and saying how awful their performance is. Once they've finished dancing they return to the table and hand Len his item. Len then gets disappointed as his food has gone cold and therefore he gives them \\"a big, fat, zero\\" (0 points) and then says \\"Join us next week when I'll be asking for [another thing on the table!]\\". * For Girls Aloud, all the girls but Sarah create a beat using whatever they have at the location (e.g. library, exam hall). Sarah always destroys their beat by making a loud sound. Then she laughs as the other girls complain. * For Paris Hilton, the camera is mostly on her while she brags on (e.g. about a party where everyone dresses as her, how beautiful she is). At times the camera changes to see Noodles. Near the end of the sketch, Hilton normally goes, \\"Tantrum time! Tantrum! Tantrum!\\" and wails loudly (e.g. \\"I want my big sunglasses!\\"). This normally results in Noodles going, \\"Woof!\\" angrily and punishing her (e.g. blowing the hair-dryer at her which messes up her hair, throwing her into the river, throwing her onto the ground and then urinating on her) * For Jamie Oliver, he is portrayed as a chef with an exaggerated lisp, who jumps about and yells. He has a fridge which resembles a prison cell containing a few vegetables, which are constantly escaping. Jamie then has to try to catch them. *For Wayne Rooney there are two Wayne twins and they like to do girly things such as ballet and watercolour painting. This usually ends in a mess such as tripping over while dancing.  Twists  For the last episode of Hedz, they created twists for some of the sketches. * For Len Goodman, Arlene Phillips and Bruno Tonioli, instead of giving Phillips and Tonioli zero, Goodman gave them a ten. * For Gordon Ramsay, he is seen looking after his 'son', who is really a mini version of Ramsay tucked in a buggy. After being mad three times, he explodes. Similarly, after crying three times, his 'son' explodes. * For Jackie Chan, he makes a phone call to Arnie's Video shop. Instead of doing something wrong on himself, he throws the phone away, only to accidentally hit and smash the camera lens. * For Ant & Dec, they almost manage to squash Mary-Kate and Ashley. They lower a ton on the two girls, only to result in them holding onto it and doing workouts. Ant and Dec also hold onto it and the girls let go, resulting in both Ant and Dec being flattened. * For Beyonc√©, instead of saving someone, she has a shake-off with her arch enemy J-Lo, who uses her bum for evil, unlike Beyonc√©, who uses it for good. Beyonc√© beats J-Lo and sends her away. * For the Flatner, Ozzy and Sharon finally unmask the villain revealing it is actually Charlotte Church who says she did it so there will be no more singers and she would be top of the charts! Series 2 In the second series, Hedz features several new characters and sketches in addition to returning ones. Top Gear: Instead of a car, Jeremy Clarkson reviews an ordinary household or office appliance, treating it like it is an authentic motor, much to Richard Hammond's despair as he is the only one that can see sense. Hammond eventually summons The Stig to run down Clarkson and end his humiliating reports. James May often appears wanting to have a go on what Clarkson is reviewing. Ross Kemp Nature Trails: Ross Kemp attempts to show viewers how to use squirrels in day to day survival methods when lost in a forest, but his suggestions always disturb or endanger a squirrel, forcing them to take action against him and drag him away to parts unknown. Zac and Vanessa's Exciting Night In: The sketch always starts off with a flashy intro, but when it finishes, the sketch usually shows Zac Efron and Vanessa Hudgens doing something not very exciting like changing the TV channel. The Lewis Hamilton Living Room Grand Prix sketch has been changed into the Bedroom Grand Prix and they have scrapped Hamilton in favour of a different celebrity each time. Doctor Who M.D.: The Doctor (now represented by a \\"head\\" of Matt Smith) and his nurse Amy \\"diagnose\\" patients with simple medical emergencies, but instead of coming to normal conclusions, The Doctor assumes the ailments have been caused by alien intervention or a torque in the space/time continuum and attempts an over-the-top means of dealing with the problem that, in several instances, disintegrates the patients. Harry Potter vs Twilight: Harry Potter attempts to petition himself into a role in the new Twilight movie under the motif that \\"wizards are cool\\"; in doing so he constantly interrupts key moments of filming with the film's iconic lead characters. Random Team: At the conclusion of most (not all) of the episode of this season, this sketch airs. It focuses mainly on a celebrity, mainly actress Rita Simons (as her EastEnders character Roxy Mitchell) and former Spice Girl Victoria Beckham, having a minor accident in their kitchen and summoning the awkwardly paired team of Barack Obama, Gok Wan and Gordon Ramsay to help him or her deal with the issue. Despite some suggestions, the trio offer nothing that helps remedy the situation and eventually always allow Gordon to destroy the kitchen in order to \\"fix\\" the issue before leaving for another assignment. Name That Cheese: James May appears as a contestant where he tries to name a certain cheese but ends up not knowing what it is. Awards In 2008 Hedz was nominated for BAFTA Children's Kids Vote Award.  Trivia  * Britney Spears was supposed to appear in a lot more sketches of her own (where she was a manic hair-dresser who chopped off everyone's hair) but as the show coincided with her breakdown, it was thought that she wasn't a good role-model for the viewers, and she was cut out of the remaining programmes. * Hedz won a Scottish BAFTA for 'Best Children's Programme' in November 2008.

In 2006 the shopping centers had 3,300 lessees with total revenue of about NOK 40 billion. History The company was founded in 1797 when Samuel Str√∏m started a wine shop and general store in Oslo. When he died in 1818, the store was taken over by his widow Else Str√∏m, then their common son Christian Str√∏m in 1829. In 1856 Christian Str√∏m, shortly before his death, passed it on to his nephew and adoptive son Samuel Str√∏m, Jr. (son of S√∏ren Str√∏m) and the husband of his adoptive daughter (Ovidia born Jebe) Emil Steen. The name Steen & Str√∏m was then established. Samuel Str√∏m, Jr. died in 1876, and Emil Steen brought the widow of Samuel Jr Augusta Str√∏m on board as partner. In 1884 the next generation took over, with Christian Steen, Johan Steen and Christian Str√∏m, Jr. as partners. The next generation after that entered the company with Erling Steen and Eyvind Str√∏m in 1914; and Nils Steen in 1919. The three took over the company in the 1930s. Another family member Emil Steen was just a board member, but his son Christian Steen became chief executive in 1964. In 1874 the company built the first department store in Norway, but it was destroyed in a fire in 1929. By 1930 a brand new store had been rebuilt, with architectural inspiration from Paris. In 1991 Agora Drift AS took over the management of Steen & Str√∏m, as well as five other shopping centres and three hotels, and started expanding. In July 1994 the company was listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange, but delisted again in September 2007 after Stein Erik Hagen had bought out the other owners, at the time Canica (49,9%), Storebrand (12.9%), Orkla (10.3%), Stein Erik Hagen (5.9%) and Varner-Gruppen (5.5%). In 2008 the company was sold for NOK 21.9 billion to Kl√©pierre (56.1%) and ABP Pension Fund (43.9%).

The service operated on a rail line owned by the Island Corridor Foundation who also contracts out freight operations to the Southern Railway of Vancouver Island (formerly known as the Esquimalt & Nanaimo Railway). Service was indefinitely suspended due to poor track repairs. Service was slated to resume in 2015, but repairs to the track have not commenced. History =VIA Rail Canada= The train was formerly operated with one or two Budd Rail Diesel Cars. Via Rail began operating the passenger train in 1979. During a period of low ridership, all trains terminated at Parksville and a bus continued to Courtenay. Service to Courtenay resumed in 1977. =Service suspension= Although the service had been threatened with discontinuation several times, it was suspended indefinitely on March 19, 2011, due to track replacement work. Prior to further inspection of the track, service along the segment between Nanaimo and Victoria was originally planned to resume on April 8, but lack of funding prevented any of the work from taking place leaving the service out of operation for three years. A temporary bus replacement was brought in for the service after the closure, but dropping passenger numbers of less than ten per day caused the service to be discontinued on August 7. On May 10, nearly two months after suspension, the old Budd cars were moved from the roundhouse in Victoria to a secure yard in Nanaimo, in future hopes of starting commuter service from there. On November 5, they were taken off the island to be returned to central Canada and will be replaced by a new three-car train stock if service resumes. However, in February 2012, the very short stretch of track from Harbour Road to downtown Victoria was taken out of service because of the pending removal of the railway bridge as the start of the Johnson Street Bridge replacement project. The Johnson Street Bridge has been replaced with a new bridge, which sits on the site of the former railway bridge, and there are no current plans to replace the railway bridge. In July 2014, following the successful securing of funds from the local, federal, and provincial governments to replace trackage and repair bridges along the line, Via Rail reached an agreement with Southern Railway of Vancouver Island and the Island Corridor Foundation to resume island passenger rail operations. Service between Victoria and Nanaimo was expected to resume in May 2015, with service between Nanaimo and Courtenay beginning later in summer 2015. However, repairs to the track had not commenced, and there would be no resumption of passenger (or freight) service on the line before 2016 or 2017 at the earliest. Route When VIA Rail took over the service from Canadian Pacific Railway, the line served only Victoria, Duncan, Nanaimo and Parksville daily except Sundays. In 1979, many intermediate stops that existed until the line's closure were added to the schedule and the train began operating daily. The train operated one daily round trip, departing Victoria in the morning, and returning from Courtenay in the evening. The trip took 4 hours and 45 minutes each way. Proposals of operating a commuter service as far as Nanaimo, or Cowichan have now shifted to focus on running a Westshore commuter service along the first 15 kilometres of track between Victoria and Langford.

It is the third entry in the King's Field series and the last one for the original PlayStation. The game was released on June 21 1996 in Japan, and November 20 1996 in North America. The English language version was renumbered and retitled King's Field II, because the original King's Field was released only in Japan. Gameplay Players can teleport between the different cities from the map screen. Reception On release, Japanese gaming publication Famitsu gave the game a 28 out of 40 score. Reviews for King's Field III widely praised the massive size of the game world and the resulting longevity, and criticized the slowness of the character movement and combat. Otherwise, however, critics were divided about the game. Of the four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly, Shawn Smith praised several of the game's elements but found its gameplay too tedious, Dan Hsu and Crispin Boyer recommended it for its first person approach and various improvements over the previous installment, and Sushi-X criticized that the game is ahead of its time, using a design which would make a good future for RPGs but runs much too slow on contemporary hardware. GamePros Art Angel noted the improvements over King's Field II but judged that the slow, unbalanced combat remained a crippling flaw, remarking that \\"everything onscreen looks like it's moving underwater. A melee round against a low-level creature can take up to five minutes to complete.\\" He concluded by expressing hope that there would be no further games in the series. Greg Kasavin of GameSpot also felt the improvements over King's Field II were insufficient, but primarily because they added up to more of a refinement of the original formula than a new direction. He concluded, \\"The first King's Field was an excellent game, and its like-minded sequel is even better. This is an exciting, non-linear journey filled to the brim with swords, sorcery, and secrets.\\" A Next Generation critic said that the combination of the action and RPG genres results in the game being shallow and dull by the standards of both genres, though he felt it could still be worthwhile for players who don't mind its slow pace.

The station is currently owned by Humboldt State University. KHSU also holds licenses for additional stations running Radio Biling√ºe and BBC World Service. KHSU provides the region encompassing Humboldt and Del Norte Counties in California as well as portions of Trinity and Mendocino Counties in California and Curry County in Oregon, with news information and entertainment from public radio producers like National Public Radio (NPR), Public Radio International (PRI) and American Public Media (APM). As of April 11, 2019, all volunteer programmers (with as much as 30 years' service to the station) and staff were either fired or had quit. As an economy move and a possible sale of the station, KHSU is running programming from North State Public Radio in Chico, California, based at 91.7 KCHO, more than 150 miles distant. History =Early years= The station began as a radio classroom experiment in 1941 on the campus of what was then Humboldt State College, with broadcasts airing on KIEM for two months until the attack on Pearl Harbor. The radio program resumed in full in 1947, when KHSC-AM signed on as a 10-watt carrier current station. In January 1960, Humboldt State applied for the first non-commercial radio license on a California college or university campus. The new station signed on for the first time on October 17, operating at 10 watts on 90.5 FM. It became KHSU in 1972, shortly after Humboldt State was elevated to university status. =NPR affiliation= The station remained almost exclusively a student training ground until 1982, when it boosted its power to 100 watts and moved to 91.5 FM. At that point, the station began a gradual process of professionalization, picking up an NPR membership in 1984. It returned to 90.5 in October 1984, this time with an increased signal of 9,000 watts. In 1988, facing the prospect of waiting five years to qualify for grants from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, KHSU shuffled its budget in order to enable it to hire the five full-time employees it needed for CPB funding within only five months of applying. =2019 staff cutbacks= On April 11, 2019, KHSU took a dramatic change in focus, personnel, and programming. All staff and volunteers were called to a 9 a.m. meeting, at which the memo below was given to those present, essentially firing of all but two staffers, though both later resigned. HSU administrators then enlisted HSU police officers to escort all those involved off campus. Door locks were changed, the station office was closed and phones disconnected, and KHSU began re-broadcasting programming from North State Public Radio in Chico, California.https://www.sacbee.com/latest- news/article229484364.htmlhttps://lostcoastoutpost.com/2019/apr/12/david-reed- one-two-employees-spared-ax-khsu-resign/ In April, 2019, HSU issued the following statement about KHSU's reorganization: ‚Ä≥Humboldt State University is reorganizing and streamlining operations at its public radio station, KHSU, with the goal of preserving quality programming for the North Coast. Station employees were told of the changes earlier today. Because the reorganization and budget reductions include the elimination of positions, a number of individuals have been laid off. The University is working to provide clear information to them, and to ensure they receive any benefits they are entitled to. The steps taken include: ‚Ä¢ Elimination of HSU‚Äôs direct payroll support, including the General Manager position and Chief Engineer position, saving the University more than $250,000 annually. ‚Ä¢ Elimination of five other staff positions, generating significant savings in the portion of KHSU‚Äôs budget that comes from government support, underwriting, and listener contributions. ‚Ä¢ Appointment of an Interim Station Director, to be supported through non-HSU funding. ‚Ä¢ Indefinite suspension of volunteer-run programs. The University will evaluate how students can return to a more substantial on-air role at KHSU. Volunteers, listeners, legislators and faculty members disagreed with HSU administrators' cutbacks, taken just a few days after a successful Fund Drive with no mention of the pending staff cuts.https://lostcoastoutpost.com/2019/apr/13/khsu-protest-plaza/ Board members of North Coast Public Television have discussed that organization aiding KHSU. In early May 2019, community groups began considering the purchase of the station from the university. Appeals were made by a group calling itself \\"Friends of KHSU\\" to pay for a Washington DC based attorney to begin negotiations for the station. KHSU had volunteer producers and show hosts programming music and public affairs shows. This tradition continued until April 11, 2019, when over 80 volunteers and paid staff were terminated. Over 68 hours of KHSU programming was locally produced every week. Volunteer music producers accounted for 63 hours of KHSU's programming. Former independent producers include Emmanuel Serriere and his weekly French radio program \\"Radio a la Carte\\", \\"Sabor LatinX\\" produced by Dami√°n Campos and Katie Whiteside's programs were discontinued. =KHSU simulcasts and translators= KHSU's programming can also be heard on KHSR 91.9 FM in Crescent City, KHSF 90.1 FM in Ferndale, and KHSG 89.9 FM in Garberville KHSU (operating under the moniker \\"Diverse Public Radio\\") also makes the programming of Radio Biling√ºe available to North Coast (and South Coast of Oregon) listeners through stations KHSM (103.3 McKinleyville and Wild Rivers Coast) and KIPE (89.7 Pine Hills - serving the Eel River Valley).

(Clm 14456 fol. 71r) of St. Emmeram Abbey. The day is divided into 24 hours, and each hour into 4 puncta, 10 minuta, or 40 momenta. Similarly, the week is divided into seven days, and each day into 96 puncta, 240 minuta, or 960 momenta. A moment (momentum) was a medieval unit of time. The movement of a shadow on a sundial covered 40 moments in a solar hour, a twelfth of the period between sunrise and sunset. The length of a solar hour depended on the length of the day, which, in turn, varied with the season. Although the length of a moment in modern seconds was therefore not fixed, on average, a moment corresponded to 90 seconds. A solar day can be divided into 24 hours of either equal or unequal lengths, the former being called natural or equinoctial, and the latter artificial. The hour was divided into four puncta (quarter-hours), ten minuta, or 40 momenta. The unit was used by medieval computists before the introduction of the mechanical clock and the base 60 system in the late 13th century. The unit would not have been used in everyday life. For medieval commoners the main marker of the passage of time was the call to prayer at intervals throughout the day. The earliest reference we have to the moment is from the 8th century writings of the Venerable Bede, who describes the system as 1 solar hour = 4 points = 5 lunar points = 10 minutes = 15 parts = 40 moments. Bede was referenced five centuries later by both Bartholomeus Anglicus in his early encyclopedia De Proprietatibus Rerum (On the Properties of Things), as well as Roger Bacon, Note the distinction between minucia and minuta, as well as the introduction of the ostenta, the precursor to the modern minute. by which time the moment was further subdivided into 12 ounces of 47 atoms each, although no such divisions could ever have been used in observation with equipment in use at the time.

It is licensed to Fremont, California, United States. The station is currently owned by the Ohlone Community College District and is the primary instructional facility for the Ohlone College Radio Broadcast program. KOHL production studio  History  =1972 to 1984= 89.3 KOHL signed on in 1972 as a 10 watt FM station. A residential house located on the Ohlone College Fremont campus served as home to both the studios and transmitter. The KOHL logo reflected this. The logo consisted of KOHL in bold lettering at the top, a house in the middle, and \\"Ohlone College\\" written at the bottom. Adjacent to the back of the house was an antenna. This is very similar to how things really were at the facility. The transmitter sat in the fireplace of the house. A line of coaxial cable took the signal from the transmitter up through the chimney and then over to the tower. In 1981 KOHL adopted a CHR format, shedding its previous free-form typical college radio sound. =1984 to 1992= In 1984 KOHL was granted an increase in power by the FCC moving the station up to 100 watts ERP. The transmitter remained in building 29, while the studios were moved into building 4 on the Ohlone College campus. In 1992 KOHL was once again granted an increase in power, bringing the station to 145 watts ERP. The transmitter was moved from building 29 to Mission Ridge. The move in power and location gave KOHL a much farther-reaching signal that could be heard from as far north as Oakland to San Jose in the south bay. This configuration remains today. =1992 to the present= In October 1995 the Gary Soren Smith Center for the Fine and Performing Arts was officially opened at the Ohlone College Fremont Campus. The Smith Center consists of two theater venues, a dance studio, an amphitheater, and a broadcasting complex. The second floor of the broadcasting complex was specifically designed for KOHL (the first floor houses Ohlone College's TV station, ONTV). The facility consists of four studios, support offices, an engineering center and a classroom. In addition to moving into brand new custom studios, KOHL also made the move to the RCS Master Control digital radio platform, which ultimately became an industry standard. KOHL was one of the earliest west coast broadcast facilities to make the transition and was often used by the RCS company as a showcase for the product. In 2005 KOHL converted from the DOS based RCS Master Control system to the Windows XP version. Branding In 1999 the branding and imaging of KOHL received an overhaul to better adapt the station for the modern radio industry. The old slogan of ‚ÄúThe Bay Area‚Äôs Best Music‚Äù was retired and replaced with ‚ÄúMusic. Attitude.‚Äù The imaging between songs took on a more aggressive sound, often using agro rock or industrial music underneath. The station voice became heavily processed and more drops from television and movies were worked into the production. The logo was changed as well, moving from a two-color handwriting type font to a larger, bold-faced offset stacked three color (red, white, and black) logo with \\"89.3\\" on the top and \\"KOHL\\" on the bottom. KOHL as an educational broadcasting program KOHL as a whole is the primary working lab of the Radio Broadcasting Program at Ohlone College in Fremont, California, providing real-world, hands-on experience to students. The program is a career-oriented, operations-intensive curriculum featuring the latest technology. Lecture and lab situations (both on air and off) combine to provide students with the background and skills required to meet the needs of the radio communications industry. The program features both analog and digital studio systems, including digital multitrack production techniques. The curriculum is presented by industry professionals and is designed to focus on the business of radio broadcasting.

Description The circle takes the name from the hamlet of Latham, of which the circle is close to the exact center. The circle was originally built as a large traffic circle in 1934 and in 1958 an underpass was built to give motorists the option to skip the circle and continue on US 9. The traffic circle was remodeled in 2002 to have true roundabout characteristics. US 9 travels north-south under the circle while one-way access roads on either side carry traffic to the circle for connection to NY 2, which travels east-west. History Prior to the 2002 work, the accident rate at the circle was about one per week, but were of low severity. After the reconstruction the accident rate dropped by 60%. The work on the circle included improving pavement markings, narrowing the US 9 access roads entering and exiting the circle to one lane, realigning the approaches from NY 2, reconfiguring the lanes within the circle, and improving signage. This work won the New York State Department of Transportation the 2003 National Roadway Safety Award. Traffic counts for US 9 in 2002 and 2004 showed over 26,000 cars passing under the Latham Circle daily. Latham Circle's access roads formerly had two Texas U-turns, allowing for traffic on the access roads to cross US 9 to the opposite access road without passing through the circle. Texas U-turns are unusual outside of Texas and extremely rare outside of the Southern United States. The name Latham Circle has since been used in the name of many local businesses, including a shopping mall, soccer team, diner, and taxi service.

At that time, hexagonal pillars similar to those of the Giant's Causeway in Ireland could be seen on one of the quarry faces. The Edwin Richards quarry was combined with the Hailstone quarry by removing the disused road between them. It remained active until 2008, operated by Midland Quarry Products. During the 1980s and 1990s, the quarry on Rowley Hill in Rowley Regis was used as a landfill site. There is now a golf driving range on top of this disused quarry and landfill. The Rowley dolerite is an intrusion of late Carboniferous age in the form of a lopolith. The country rock consists of the Etruria Marl Formation. The main use of the Rowley Rag stone was in the production of road surfaces and kerbstones.

This location was a stop on the expedition of Lewis and Clark. Big Hidatsa was the largest village of the three on the site, with about 120 round earthlodges. Fort Mandan was built about 2 miles away from Big Hidatsa by the Lewis and Clark expedition. History The Big Hidatsa site and its neighbors are the villages at which Lewis and Clark and the Corps of Discovery were assisted by Sacagawea during their expedition. When the explorers arrived in winter 1804, between 4,000 and 5,000 Hidatsa and Mandan lived in this area, and there were more than 200 lodges. Each of these earthlodges could hold 20 to 30 people. After Fort Mandan was erected by the Discovery Corps, trading was conducted between the men of the expedition and people of Big Hidatsa. In fact, some artifacts from the inhabitants of the nearby site and its neighbors were sent to President Thomas Jefferson. Communications with the Hidatsa and Mandan people here provided invaluable information about the culture and history of the people in the west. Today Depressions in the ground can be seen where the lodges once stood because the dirt surrounding the structures collapsed after it was abandoned. Several invasive species, harmful tree fungus, and the erosion of the riverbank threaten the site. The park has a rich collection of artifacts from the people who lived at the site.

The first settlers found it wholly covered in timber of large growth. Its general surface is rolling and in places broken. It has an area of about 27,000 acres (110 km), most of which is arable, and abounds in bituminous coal and limestone. It is well watered by small streams. Sugar Creek, the largest and the township's namesake, has several branches which flow through the central part of the township from the west and northwest, and empty into the Wabash River one and a half miles south of the National Road. Clear Creek, the next in size, flows through the southern part and empties into the Wabash three and a half miles south of the mouth of Sugar Creek. The first settlement was made in 1818, and the first settlers were James Bennett, John Sheets, John Ray, Henry Kuykendall, John Reese, Reuben Newton, James Hicklin, Joseph Malcom, Micajah Goodman, Henry Hearn, Henry Middleton and John Cruse. Joseph Malcom was the first road supervisor, and John Ray was the first inspector of elections; they were appointed by the county commissioners on May 9, 1820. John Reese was the first justice of the peace; he was chosen at an election (the first held in the township) held at the house of John Ray on the first Saturday in June. It is said that Daniel Kuykendall was the first child born. The first saw-mill was built by James Sturgess, in 1820, on the S. W. 1/4 of Sec. 24, T. 12, R. 9 W, About this time James Bennett built a grist mill on the N. W. 1/4 of Sec. 30, T. 12, R. 9 W., and sometime after connected with it an oil-mill and carding machine, and on the same section, in 1824, built the first brick house. In 1831 Joseph Malcom was granted permission to establish and keep a public ferry over the Wabash river, now known as Cox's ferry. In the autumn of 1846 George Broadhurst sank the first coal shaft, in the S. W. corner of the S. W. 1/4 of Sec. 19, T. 12, R. 9 W. Previous to this date coal had been dug at different places, but no regular mining for profit was carried on until Mr. Broadhurst had sunk his shaft.' =Towns= Macksville, named after its founder, Samuel McQuilkin, but eventually renamed West Terre Haute, is located in a fertile plain one mile (1.6 km) west of Terre Haute; when the land was surveyed into lots is now unknown. The plat was recorded November 28, 1836. In 1833 the first dwelling house was built within what three years later became the legal boundaries of the present town. About one or two years later Samuel McQuilkin opened a store and Smith Finch a tavern. These institutions were largely patronized by those who were employed in the construction of the National Road, which was winding its way westward through the site of the future metropolis of Sugar Creek Township. The town has now a population of 250; two stores which do a fair business, blacksmith and wheelwright shop for custom work, saw-mill, shingle machine and cigar factory. Its manufactures, therefore, consist of lumbar, shingles and cigars, and the present strongly indicates that in the near future grape wine will be added. Vegetable gardening is a growing and profitable interest. In the autumn of 1867 John Griggs and his son Edward erected a custom flour-mill, and in the following spring commenced grinding. They continued to run the mill successfully until August 8, 1870, when it was struck by lightning and entirely consumed by fire. There is no church edifice in the town and but one organized religious society, which is Methodist Episcopal, with a membership of sixty-seven. It holds its meetings in the public school-house, located near the center of the town. This society has connected with it a prosperous Sabbath-school which holds its sessions each Sabbath morning in the school-house. There is also a Union Sabbath-school in good working order, which occupies the public school- house each Sabbath afternoon. These organizations are working harmoniously and doing much to aid the cause of Christianity. During the past few years, at different times, saloons have been licensed to vend alcoholic liquors, but in a very short time were compelled to cease their traffic because of the radical temperance sentiment which prevails almost universally. The most notable event which has transpired in its history of forty-four years is the murder of Eva Peters, which was committed on the morning of March 15, 1875. Eva was an elderly maiden lady living alone in a small house in the village. Who her murderers are will probably never be known; what the motives were which impelled them to commit the horrible deed are yet a mystery to the community. Miss Peters had deposited in bank in Terre Haute a few dollars, the earnings of toil which she was saving to be expended to give her a \\"Christian burial.\\" This money she drew out of the bank the day before she was murdered. The possession of this small sum is supposed to be the incentive to the commission of the bloody crime; if so, the murderers were disappointed, for the money was found, after the body was discovered, concealed in her bed. Bloomtown was a village of fifty inhabitants six miles (10 km) west of Terre Haute on the Paris road, and a half mile north of the Vandalia railroad. It is located in a rich and extensive bottom, through which the waters of Sugar creek flow. It was laid out in 1858 by Hiram Bloom, after whom it was named. When Mr. Bloom settled here is not ascertained. He is reputed to have been a very active and enterprising man. In the earlier days of Bloomtown a saw-mill, and in later years a merchant flour-mill, were the pride of the villagers. The mills were destroyed by fire. The dates of their founding and destruction we could not ascertain definitely. For a number of years the manufacture of lumber was a leading source of employment and revenue, as the bottom was densely covered with black-walnut timber. It contains a blacksmith shop, which is opened occasionally to the public, and one store, the proprietor of which is postmaster. The name of the post-office is Nelson. It has a semi-weekly mail. St. Mary's is a village of 100 inhabitants adjacent to the community of the Sisters of Providence. Its site was never divided into town lots. It contains two stores, a cabinet, carpenter, blacksmith and cooper shop, and a brick church which was built in 1867 and cost $13,000. The only secular organization here is a St. Joseph's Total Abstinence Society, at one time numbering ninety members; it now numbers fifty. This society has accomplished much good, and its continuance should be encouraged. In religion the villagers are Catholic, who have been induced to locate here because of the growth and prosperity of the Academic Institute, so successfully conducted by the Sisters of Providence. The village has grown to its present size within the past thirty- five years without any effort to build up a town.' =Churches= New Hope was the first church built in the township. It was built in 1824 by members of the Presbyterian denomination. It was constructed of huge black poplar logs hewn on two sides. Each one engaged in building this pioneer temple contributed a log. The church, like many of those who worshipped in it, has long ago died; there is now no vestige remaining to mark its site; when the society was organized is now not known. The first temperance lecture delivered in this township was at this church, in 1828. The lecturer, Rev. Samuel Baldridge, a native of North Carolina, was an eloquent and enthusiastic advocate of temperance, and an uncompromising anti-slavery man. The doctrines proclaimed by him fell upon his auditors like a thunderbolt from a clear sky; they were struck with astonishment at the boldness of the speaker and the strange doctrine he taught. Astonishment gave place to anger, and threats of violence were boldly uttered. The excitement increased, reaching out and embracing neighborhoods beyond that of the church; several with their teams went to the church for the purpose of taking out of its walls the logs which they had contributed. At that day the use of alcoholic liquors as a beverage was a prevailing custom in almost every family throughout the township, hence temperance lecturers were regarded as disturbers of the peace. Mr. Baldridge was a brave man and continued to lecture occasionally on his favorite theme in the church. His labor was crowned with success by organizing a temperance society of one hundred and one members. Pisgah Methodist Episcopal church was built in 1839, on Sec. 4, T. 12, R. 10 W., and completed in the autumn of 1840. John M. Reese was the architect and builder. The timber for the frame was hewn and the weather-boards sawn with a whip-saw. On the night of December 24, 1877, it was destroyed by fire. Since the church was burned the society holds its meetings in the district school-house. It is said to be the first Methodist Episcopal society organized in the township; when it was the first organized there is no written record. The society is in good working condition, and since 1840 has under its watchcare a Sabbath-school which numbers sixty scholars, which also meets in the district school-house. Bethesda Methodist Episcopal church is an unpretending one-story frame building, located on the N. E. 1/4 of Sec. 23, T. 12, R. 10 W., three and a half miles west of Terre Haute, and a half mile south of the Paris road. It was built in 1849 and completed in 1852. When the society was first organized in not known. Connected with it is a flourishing and interesting Sabbath- school. Both are working in complete harmony, and their influence for good is manifest throughout the vicinity of the church. West Vigo is located on the S. E. 1/4 of Sec. 14, T. 12, R. 10 W., four miles (6 km) west of Terre Haute, on the Paris Road. W. W. and John B. Goodman, with ten others, withdrew from the Presbyterian society of New Hope church and convened together on 20 December 1849, and organized the first society of the Congregational denomination in the township. This little society did not remain quiescent, but at once inaugurated measures for the erection of a temple to worship in, and with the aid from the Congregational building fund built, at an expenditure of $800, and dedicated on the first day of May, 1853, what is now known as West Vigo Congregational church. It is a plain one-story frame edifice, 28 x . South Vigo Congregational church is a plain frame edifice, located on the N. W. 1/4 of Sec. 21, T. 11, R. 10 W. It was built in 1859. The society was organized in the log school-house, which was erected in 1853, where the present school- house of District No. 15 now stands, on the S. E. cor. of the N. W. 1/3 of Sec. 15, T. 11, R. 10 W.' =Education= In the early days of the township, there was no system of public instruction; the means for acquiring an education were very limited and discouraging. Then a few settlers joined together and erected a log cabin, in which was a fireplace extending several feet across one end. In this the fire, for warming the house, was built of logs its entire length, requiring several boys to carry each log into the house and place it in position. A log was sawn out of each side of the building and the spaces were closed with paper which had been oiled with lard; this oiled paper served as windows. The seats were logs split into halves and supported by round sticks; the writing desks were of similar pattern, and the door was constructed of split logs, fastened together with wooden pine and hung with wooden hinges. In the construction of these pioneer seminaries not a nail was used. It was not unusual for boys to travel three or four miles (6 km) through dense woods, to school, blazing their way the first time going over the route. Those seats of learning are now gone, and the recollection of them is rapidly fading from memory. Wonderful, indeed, are the changes and advances made within the last sixty years in the means for acquiring an education. The township has now a system of free schools of which any people should be proud. It is now divided into ten districts, and in each is located a comfortable and substantial school-house of modern architecture, within a short distance of each child. Every boy and girl in the township, between the ages of six and twenty-one years, can now obtain an education that will fit them to transact the ordinary business of life. The following statistics show the present status of education in the township: Number of schools taught, 9; number of public school-houses, 10; value of school-houses, $5,000; value of school apparatus, $480; amount of special revenue, $820.33; amount of revenue for tuition, $5,790.31; average compensation paid to teachers per day, $1.36; daily average attendance, 336; average number of days taught during the year, 180; township library volumes, 375. There is no public school taught in district No. 2; the people of this district are Catholic, and patronize their church parochial school. In not sustaining a public school they are deprived of the district's share of the public school fund.' =St. Mary-of-the- Woods= Bishop Brute, the first bishop of Vincennes, desiring to establish in his diocese religious sisters from some community in France, his native land, commissioned Rev. C. de la Hailandiers, his vicar-general, who was then in France, to apply for some sisters who would be courageous enough to leave the land of their nativity and devote themselves to the instruction of youth in the wilds of America; bid adieu to all that was near and dear to them in the world, for at that time going to America was considered in the same light of going to the country beyond the grave, without the faintest hope of ever returning. On the recommendation of a priest of the diocese of Rennes, the vicar-general of Vincennes applied in the name of Bishop Brute to the superiors of the Sisters of Providence, at Ruille-sur-Loir, in the diocese of Mans, to obtain sisters for the mission of Vincennes. Bishop Bonvier, of Mans, and superiors of Ruille, promised him to consider the matter and do their best to grant their request. Meanwhile Bishop Brute died, and his vicar-general was appointed his successor in 1839, and was consecrated the same year at Paris. He went to Ruille' at the epoch of the annual retreat of the sisters in September. He spoke so forcibly to Mother Mary, superior-general at that time, of the spiritual wants and destitution of the children of his diocese, that she, with the approval of the bishop of Le Mans, consented to send a colony of sisters. It was decided they would start the next summer. In July, 1840, sisters Theodore, Basilide, Olympiade, Mary Liguori, St. Vincent and Mary Xavier, three professed sisters and three novices, parted from their dear community and started in quest of their future field of labor. Mother Theodore and her sisters, having received the blessing of Bishop Bouvier, of Mans, proceeded to Havre, where they embarked for New York on July 26, and arrived on September 8, after a painful sea voyage of forty days. After a short rest they went to Philadelphia, then to Baltimore. From Baltimore they traveled to Vincennes in the company of a Canadian priest, who was going there to see the bishop. From Baltimore they traveled night and day in a stage coach to Wheeling; from Wheeling they descended the Ohio river in a boat to Madison; here they met Bishop de la Hailandiere, who was visiting missions, and after his promising to rejoin them in a few days they proceeded to Vincennes. Father Buteux, a French priest who was residing at St. Mary's, came to the Episcopal city and conducted the weary travelers to their destination, where they arrived on October 22, 1840, after a painful and tedious journey of ninety days. St. Mary's at that time consisted of a small frame house, the dwelling of a farmer, Joseph Thrall. There were besides, two or three log huts in the forest at different places in the vicinity, also an unfinished brick house that the bishop was building for the sisters, which had been commenced the month before their arrival, and a log church square, in which Father Buteux, who was the first chaplain of the community, officiated. It had no altar, no tabernacle, but on a board placed on logs was a small pyx, in which was kept the blessed sacrament. Mr. Thrall shared his house with the sisters, of which in a few weeks became sole possessors by purchase; it had four small rooms, and the best one was immediately converted into a chapel. In November, 1841, Sister St. Frances, who had been detained by ill health, arrived at St. Mary's, to the great joy and delight of the little community. From that day her name is all along joined with that of Mother Theodore in the most important events and transactions of the community of which she became mistress of novices. During a space of about seven years the young community was submitted to the greatest tribulations that can be imagined; it proved a time of almost constant struggle, anguish and agony. Those days of pain were succeeded by peaceful ones, only occasionally illness came to threaten the lives of Mother Theodore and Sister St. Frances. Sister St. Frances died January 31, 1856, and Mother Theodore, the foundress of the community, died May 14, three months after Sister St. Frances. Great is the difference between the first house occupied by the pioneer sisters and the present beautiful and imposing Academy of St. Mary's of the Woods and the comfortable mother-house adjoining it. Then a log house was the chapel and at the same time the residence of the priest; two small rooms, half the dwelling-house of a kind farmer, constituted the convent home. The academy building in process of erection then was a neat, small, brick edifice, with basement and attic, consisting of six rooms. The few sisters that came had then to fulfill every office and duty, besides facing all the difficulties with only such resources as their solitude could afford. The railroad was not made then, and sometimes all communications with Terre Haute were prevented by water that filled the river bottom, which extended half way between the two places. Since the St. Louis, Terre Haute & Indianapolis railroad is established, communications have become very easy. The community now numbers more than 300 sisters, including novices. The epoch of the annual retreat is August 7, at which time they all visit their mother home. The Sisters of Providence have under their direction thirty-three branch establishments, located in the states of Indiana, Michigan and Illinois, and two orphan asylums; one for boys at Vincennes, the other at Terre Haute, for girls. In 1839, Bishop de la Hailandiere, purchased of land for the pioneers. It was covered with timber except about . The community now owns over 300 acres (1.2 km). Of the seven pioneer sisters, five rest from their earthly labors; two, Sisters Olympiade and Mary Xavier, yet remain to aid the community with their matured experience and wisdom. Foley Hall was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.

Wrongel is an adaptation of the Russian pun. In the original, captain's name is Vrungel, from \\"vrun\\" - \\"liar\\". (, translit. Priklyucheniya kapitana Vrungelya) is a 1976-1979 Soviet musical adventure animation film by David Cherkassky, Kievnauchfilm, loosely based on the novel with the same name by Andrey Nekrasov. Cartoon production was divided into 13 episodes - 1-3 filmed in 1976, 4-6 in 1977, 7-9 in 1978, 10-13 in 1979. The book by Nekrasov was first published in the Pioneer magazine in 1937 (shortened, in a form of a comics). A full text publication was issued in 1939. The novel is a parody on the popular sailor tales of the 1930s and on stereotypes then prevalent in the Soviet Union of foreigners and foreign countries. It received awards at Yerevan all-union film festival and the Czechoslovakia international TV film festival. The songs and music were performed by the soloists' ensemble of the State Symphony Orchestra of the UkSSR, conducted by N. Basov Plot An important exhibit is stolen from the Royal Museum of Arts. Fuchs, its watchman and a gambler, was blackmailed by a mafia boss, also Chief of the Yacht Club, to steal the statue of Venus. The time of the theft was linked to an international regatta so that Fuchs could smuggle the stolen goods out of the country. The Soviet naval school teacher and former sea captain Wrongel receives a telegram asking him to participate in the regatta. He and his pupil Lom (–õ–æ–º - rus. \\"Crowbar\\") decide to set sail for the starting port, although by one of the many freak accidents that occur during the adventure, their ship's name is changed from \\"Pobeda\\" (–ü–û–ë–ï–î–ê - rus. \\"Victory\\") to \\"Beda\\" (–ë–ï–î–ê - rus. \\"Trouble\\"). Throughout almost the entire journey, Wrongel and Lom have no idea about the hidden purpose of the regatta. At that point in time for Fuchs everything is going smoothly and according to plan. All newspapers have written extensively about the \\"crime of the century\\". The Regatta is in danger of cancellation. When Wrongel's Beda arrives, they find out that they need three crew members to participate in the regatta. Lom quickly finds Fuchs, who is desperate in his attempts to get to the Black Cuttlefish yacht as arranged with mafia. As a result, the much sought after statue of Venus ends up on Beda, instead of Black Cuttlefish, which was supposed to smuggle it out of the port. Agent 00X is chasing the Venus, just like the mafiosi Bandito and Gangsterito, who are looking for Fuchs to take the Venus away from him.

Following the release of this film, Vrungel became a colloquial name in Russia, a kind of Baron Munchausen. But as Nekrasov himself explained Vrungel's prototype was his mate Vronsky, who loved to tell tale stories from his life. His surname was suited for the protagonist so well that initially the book was named Adventures of Captain Vronsky, but Nekrasov later reconsidered the name because of his desire not to hurt his friend's feelings. * Agent 00X and his storyline is a pun over the western Agent 007. He wasn't present in original book. * Pobeda (stress on the second syllable) is Russian for Victory, Beda (stress on second syllable) is Russian for Trouble. * As Nekrasov explained, Lom's prototype was a naval school cadet Ivan Mann. In German his surname means man (Mann), and in French - ¬´L'Homme¬ª (reads as Lom) * Surname Fuchs means fox (from the German Fuchs) * Fuchs was hiding Venus sculpture inside a double bass case * This cartoon is made using the cut-out technique, similar to South Park and Monty Python, as well as traditional hand-drawn animation. Most of the cartoon features cut-outs. Some of the puppet animation techniques were also applied, for example rather than drawing ropes, pieces of real thread was used and it was stop-motion-animated; rather than drawing soap bubbles, animators used soap water / shaving cream on a glass, which they moved around frame-by-frame. * Many backgrounds in this cartoon (such as the ocean, waves, etc.) had been filmed in real life and were rear-projected behind the characters.

History  = Beginning = Micro-Vett was founded in 1986 in Voltana di Lugo (RA) by three shareholders including Mr. Galli and Mr. Giacomoni. A new four- wheel electric vehicle, similar to current quadricycles, the Lady, is developed and built from scratch. Starting from 1989 Coop. Car, a cooperative from Imola gradually acquired Micro-Vett shares becoming majority shareholder and transferring the headquarters in Imola. At that time, the management understood the difficulties related to the manufacturing of vehicle body and decided to focus solely on electrification components. Consequently, Micro- Vett started a partnership with Bedford for the electrification of Rascal, a small van for people and goods delivery, which is manufactured in several tens of units. In 1991 after bankruptcy of the parent company Coop. Car, even Micro-Vett was declared bankrupted and, after a brief period of inactivity, it was taken over by Mr. Gaetano Di Gioia, already manager of his buy out by Coop. Car. = The Electric Porter = Micro-Vett Electric Porter The company from Imola continues the production of Rascal, but, given the lack of involvement of the vehicle manufacturer, approached Piaggio with which, starting from 1994, launches a collaboration for the electrification of Porter. This vehicle, thanks to purchasing incentives, meets a great success in the Italian market and it was manufactured from 1994 to 2003 in about 5,000 units. The lead-acid batteries provide a range of 60 km and a top speed of 65 km/h. Piaggio delivers the vehicles without endothermic engine to Micro-Vett and here they're converted into electric. The sale of the complete vehicle is done in almost all cases directly by Piaggio. During this period the company took part in many sport events for electric vehicles, including the 24 hours of Turin and the Monte-Carlo Rally for alternative energies propelled vehicles, by winning prestigious results. = Zebra batteries and the new vehicles = Starting from the end of the 1990s, once the technology of Zebra batteries, which can provide an energy density about four times than lead-acid batteries, has become available, Micro-Vett manufactured many prototypes including Eurocargo in association with Iveco and different units of Porter with long range. Since 2001 Micro-Vett fleet is expanded with the introduction of electric Daily and Ydea, a quadricycle made by Casalini. However, the high cost of Zebra batteries severely limits the market penetration that is still dominated, in terms of Micro-Vett sales, by Piaggio Porter. Another vehicle that takes up a prominent place in Micro-Vett range is the Daily in bimodal version,Bimodal Daily Presentation manufactured since 2004. By placing an electric motor on the shaft, the vehicle can be driven both by diesel engine both by electric motor, ensuring a unique flexibility of use. Battery recharge occurs both from electrical grid both when the vehicle is driven by the diesel engine. This project is shown to Iveco which, however, is not interested in. So Micro-Vett directly markets this vehicle with a sales volume from 2004 to 2011 of approximately 600 units. = Lithium batteries and FIAT range = The appearance of the first lithium batteries for automotive use manufactured in China at low cost since 2005, pushed Micro-Vett to test this technology making perhaps the first European prototypes of motor vehicle equipped with this technology. The company began the manufacturing of Fiat Dobl√≤ in an electric version. This vehicle, too, was sold directly by Micro-Vett to final customers, because the transformation was not explicitly supported by FIAT. The new batteries guarantee a range up to 150 km, but have some security issues, pushing Micro-Vett to test different suppliers, to finally focus on two manufacturers from South Korea. In 2009 Micro-Vett started the production of electric FiorinoElectric Fiat Fiorino test in Norway and Qubo that meet a good market success is Italy and Europe; in fact, since 2007 the company creates a network of European and extra-European dealers. The main markets are France, (Germany), Norway, the Netherlands and Spain, but many vehicles are also sold in Russia, Hong Kong, Finland and Baltic countries. Micro-Vett Electric 500 In 2009 too the company from Imola developed the e500,Micro-Vett e500, electric version of the Fiat 500 electric version of the new Fiat 500, which is presented at London Motorshow by the English dealer Nice Car. Then Micro-Vett developed the electric Ducato, in all its models. The configuration of the batteries can be dimensioned according to customer requirements. For this vehicle Micro-Vett started a partnership with the French company Gruau, which installs the kits provided by Micro-Vett on the vehicles. Interrupted since 2006 the collaboration with Piaggio, which now offers a version of electric Porter independently made, Micro-Vett triggers a similar base vehicle search. A first partnership with the Uz-Daewoo, Uzbek manufacturing site of Daewoo, was unsuccessful and other partnership with Chinese OEMs or Italian importers of Chinese vehicles too; finally Micro-Vett begun a relationship with VEM, which lead to the birth of the EdyOne in 2011. = Prototypes and projects = Throughout its history, Micro-Vett implemented many electric- powered prototypes, including the bus Albatros in collaboration with the local public transport company of Rimini, a Ducato Hybrid Bimodal Camper by Micro- Vett with endothermic engine on the front axle and electric motor on the rear axle in partnership with Al-Ko, a three-wheels motorcycle, a bimodal hearse, an all-electric excavator in collaboration with Venieri, a bimodal boat for carrying 70 people, etc..

Despite the limited manpower with regards to Imola phase, the company manufactures purely electric prototypes on Fiat chassis: Panda, Fiorino and Dobl√≤. The technical peculiarity of these vehicles is the application of an innovative idea ‚Äì which will then be patented ‚Äì aimed to maintain all the auxiliary services activated by the belt of the combustion engine. This means lower costs and greater reliability. Fiat shows a lot of interest in these vehicles and therefore Micro-Vett approaches some Piedmontese companies concerned with the industrialization of the prototypes. = The End = However, no agreement is reached and activities are gradually slowed down and finally stopped. At the end of 2016, the whole workforce leaves Micro-Vett. Since mid 2019 the website is no longer active.

Settlement in the area can be traced further back in time - evidence given by two rock slabs carved with petroglyphs found at Bj√∏rset west of the center of the town of Molde in the present day Molde Municipality.Turistbrosjyre om Gamle Molde (Historieportalen History Molde on the north shore of the Moldefjord, an arm of Romsdal Fjord, on the Romsdal peninsula =Trading post= The early medieval settlements on Ve√∏ya, an island south of the present-day town of Molde, was strategically situated at the junction where the three fjords met the large Romsdal Fjord leading westwards to the Romsdal coast and the shipping routes. Ve√∏ya was first mentioned by the historian Snorri Sturluson as the location of the Battle of Sekken in 1162, where King H√•kon the Broad-shouldered was killed fighting the aristocrat Erling Skakke, during the Norwegian civil wars, but the settlement is known to be far older than that. The Old Ve√∏y Church, built around 1200 AD, still stands on the island.Slaget ved Sekken (Ve√∏ya - den hellige √∏ya) At the eve of the 15th century, Ve√∏ya had lost most of its influence, and the island was eventually deserted. However, commercial life in the region was not dead, and originating from the two settlements at Reknes and Molde (later Moldeg√•rd), a minor port called Molde Fj√¶re (Molde Landing) emerged, based on trade with timber and herring to mainly Dutch, but also English, Scottish and Portuguese merchants. In 1614, the town gained formal trading rights; after the decline of the nearby competing townships and trading posts of Bud and Veblungsnes.Moldegaard. Bols√∏ Sogn, Bols√∏ Herred, Romsdals amt (O. Rygh: Norske Gaardnavne) During the Swedish occupation of Middle Norway, 1658‚Äì1660, after Denmark-Norway's devastating defeat in the first part of the Northern Wars (Treaty of Roskilde), the small town became a troublesome and resilient hub of resistance to the Swedes. After the rebellion and liberation in 1660 (Treaty of Copenhagen), Molde became the administrative headquarters of Romsdalen Amt (present day M√∏re og Romsdal county), and following a long commercial and administrative struggle with Trondheim and Bergen, it was finally incorporated through a royal charter in 1742. Ve√∏ya i middelalderen (Ve√∏ya - den hellige √∏ya) =Molde since 1742= Molde continued to grow throughout the 18th and 19th Centuries, becoming a center for Norwegian textile and garment industry, as well as the administrative center for the region. At this point, tourism had become a major industry. This rapid development was interrupted when one third of the city, mostly its famous wooden buildings and rose gardens, was destroyed in a fire on 21 January 1916. However, Molde recovered quickly, and continued to grow in the economically difficult interbellum period. A second fire, or series of fires, struck from the German air-raids in April and May 1940, and destroyed about two thirds of the city. German vanguards were trying to cut off and capture the king, cabinet, parliament, and national gold reserves, evacuated from Oslo following the attack on Norway on 9 April 1940. Arriving safely in Molde, the city was de facto capital of Norway from 22 April to 29 April, when the advancing German forces, combined with a failed British counter-attack, forced the Norwegian commander-in-chief, General Otto Ruge, to abandon Southern Norway and continue the fight from Troms√∏. Under dramatic circumstances due to continuous German bombing, the King, Crown Prince, and government were evacuated on the British cruiser HMS Glasgow, and brought to safety. During their time in Molde, King Haakon VII and Crown Prince Olav hid under the Royal Birch at Glomstua during a German bombing of the city. A famous photograph taken during this event was widely reprinted, and became a symbol of Norwegian patriotism and resistance against Nazi Germany. Close to the Royal Birch is the international Grove of Peace (see Bj√∏rnson Festival). =Molde today= Molde's main street and commercial center. Molde Cathedral (orange roof on far right) with its freestanding bell tower replaces the church that was destroyed during World War II Since World War II, Molde has experienced a tremendous growth. As the modernization of the Norwegian society accelerated in the post- reconstruction years, Molde became a center for not only administrative and public services, but also academic resources and industrial output. After a consolidation of the city and the neighboring municipality of Bols√∏y and parts of the municipalities of Ve√∏y and Nord-Aukra in 1964, Molde became a large, modern city, encompassing most branches of employment, from farming and fisheries, through industrial production, to banking, tourism, commerce, health care and civil administration. The fjord with its islands and skerries and the mountains encircling the town, will continue to be the frame and the arena of the town's development in the years ahead. The national poet Bj√∏rnstjerne Bj√∏rnson, expresses this sentiment in his poem Til Romsdalen: > \\"Everything I see has an eye, a voice > And the people? I know them all > Even those I have never met. I say: > If you know the fjord, you know the people\\" =Tourism= Cruise ship in Molde, sometimes referred to as \\"The Blue City\\" Already a popular tourist destination of international fame in the second half of the 19th century, Molde saw notabilities such as the German emperor Wilhelm II of Germany and the Prince of Wales as regular summer visitors. The Kaiser referred to the city as \\"The Nice of the North\\", which gave a tremendous boost to the city's desirability as a tourist destination. Drawn by its unique setting where visitors could enjoy a magnificent view of more than 222 rugged and partly snow-clad mountain peaks from all over the city, but preferably from the viewpoint Varden, it became a desired port of call for the yachts and cruise ships of the European gentry up until World War I. At the time, Molde consisted of luxurious hotels surrounding an idyllic township with quaint, wooden houses, lush gardens and parks, esplanades and pavilions, earning it the nickname \\"the Town of Roses\\". This golden era came to a sudden end with the outbreak of World War I, and the devastating fire of 1916. Although tourism has never reached the magnitude and economic importance it once had, Molde is still a major cruise ship and tourist destination. =Toponymy= The city is named after the original settlement on the farmstead of Molde (). The name is either the plural form of mold which means \\"fertile soil\\" or ' which means \\"skull\\" or \\"mould\\" (thus in reference to the rounded peaks in Moldemarka). Pronunciation varies between the standard Molde, and the rural Molle. A person from Molde will refer to him/herself as a Moldenser. =Coat of arms= Coat of arms of Molde The coat of arms is from 1742. It shows a whale chasing herring into a barrel, symbolizing the founding industries of the city - the export of fish and timber. Molde was never a whaling port; the whale is merely an echo of the ancient belief that whales were a good omen, chasing (and not following) the schools of fish into the fjords at certain times of the year.

Love Field for baseball at Louisiana Tech University James E. \\"Gravy\\" Patterson, also known as Pat Patterson, (March 26, 1934Social Security Death Index Search Results - October 11, 2007) was the most successful coach in the history of Louisiana college baseball. During his tenure as head coach from 1968 to 1990, the Louisiana Tech University Bulldogs, in Ruston, compiled a 741-462-2 record. Patterson produced eighteen winning seasons in twenty-three years, and his teams won forty or more games in five of those years. He was Conference Coach of the Year seven times. In retirement, he often returned as an interim coach. Seven of Patterson's players, including Mike Jeffcoat, Phil Hiatt, and David Segui, reached the majors.Players who Played for Louisiana Tech University - Baseball- Reference.com Patterson also coached high school baseball and college football. He should not be confused with the wrestler Pierre Clemont, who used the name \\"Pat Patterson\\" as his ring name.  Education  Patterson was born in Delhi in Richland Parish in northeastern Louisiana. He graduated from Louisiana Tech in 1958, playing football and baseball under legendary Bulldog coaches Joe Aillet and Berry Hinton. He earned four football letters and two baseball letters and went on to earn his master‚Äôs degree from the University of Mississippi (\\"Ole Miss\\") in 1961.  Coaching career  He began his coaching career in 1958 at Ouachita Parish High School in Monroe and took a job at C.E. Byrd High School in Shreveport in 1963 before he joined the Louisiana Tech athletic department in 1967 as an assistant football coach. Patterson would serve as both football assistant and head baseball coach at Tech from 1968 to 1978 and as head baseball coach only until 1990. He subsequently oversaw one more football game, having served as interim coach in 1979, when the Bulldogs posted a 13-10 win over local rival Northeast Louisiana University, now known as the University of Louisiana at Monroe, in his only game as head coach. As head coach, Patterson was named the District VI Coach of the Year in 1974. He led Louisiana Tech to seven National Collegiate Athletic Association Tournament appearances during his coaching tenure, the last in 1987. In 1974, Patterson led the Bulldogs to within one game from the College World Series. Patterson served for several years as Tech‚Äôs associate athletic director following his retirement in 1990. In that capacity, he oversaw the eligibility of athletes and monitored NCAA compliance. On three occasions, he was asked to step in as the university‚Äôs interim athletic director. To date, Patterson is the most successful baseball coach in Louisiana collegiate history. He is a member of the Louisiana Tech Athletic Hall of Fame. A large poster of Patterson hangs on the outfield wall of Louisiana Tech's baseball stadium.  Colleagues recall Patterson  Former Tech baseball coach Wade Simoneaux said that \\"In my eyes, Gravy IS Louisiana Tech baseball. Anytime anybody mentions Louisiana Tech baseball, his name comes up. He set the bar so high it isn't even obtainable to do what he accomplished here. He was an idol to me.\\" Tech radio broadcaster Dave Nitz said that when he entered Tech in 1974, Patterson became the \\"first coach I was really involved with. He took me in and was always like a father figure to me. . . . He was Tech through and through. Nobody loved Louisiana Tech more than he did.\\" A.L. Williams, the former Tech football coach and Patterson's former Tech teammate, said that he realized that Patterson \\"had a lot of ability, but, mainly, we just enjoyed being around him. He was always fun- loving and full of mischief. As a coach, he became tremendously successful largely because his players wanted to win for him so much.\\" Flo Miskelley, Tech's business manager for athletics, said that Patterson \\"was underrated for how organized and meticulous he was with his work. He was always the same ‚Äî steady. So kind to everyone, so easy to work with, and such a dear friend to so many people.\\" Assistant District Attorney Fred McGaha of Monroe, a former all-star Tech baseball player, told the News-Star that Patterson was \\"the ultimate leader, in that you always knew that he was on our side whether things were going good or bad. . . . Ironically, he didn't consider himself a great coach so he would often talk to other coaches in an attempt to learn more. What he didn't know was that it didn't matter. We were going to play harder than the other team because of our coach. He built relationships with us that lasted forever.\\" Former ULM football coach Pat Collins of Longview, Texas, who worked with Patterson at Tech from 1967‚Äì1979, said, \\"I remember nothing but good times with 'Gravy'. He was such a great friend to me and to everyone and he was the most positive individual I've ever known. He could always make something good ‚Äî and often something humorous ‚Äî out of any tough situation. He was a wonderful man who will be missed.\\" Mike Kane was recruited by Patterson as the assistant baseball coach: \\"When my folks met 'Gravy', they knew immediately they wanted me to come to Tech because they believed he would take care of me. He was like a father to me, much more like family than like a boss.\\" Kane succeeded Patterson as head baseball coach in 1990.  Murder- suicide  According to police reports, Patterson was overcome with grief for his wife, the former Glenda Bates (born ca. 1936), an Alzheimer's patient at the Arbor House assisted-care facility near Ruston. He went into the building on October 11, shot Mrs. Patterson to death, and then turned the gun on himself. Lincoln Parish Sheriff Mike Stone said that no one else was attacked in the commission of the crime. \\"This is something we've never dealt with. You hear of it happening sometimes, but never around here,\\" lamented Joanne Caldwell-Bayles, the Arbor House owner in an interview with the Monroe News Star in Monroe. Caldwell-Bayles added that \\"Unless you've really seen Alzheimers, you can't really grasp what it becomes. The ones it really hurts are the ones who have to watch their loved ones slip away. He was grieving.\\" Louisiana Tech President Daniel Reneau said that his campus had \\"lost two wonderful people. Coach Patterson was a great friend and mentor to countless Tech students over the years, and he and Glenda [who assisted in the athletic department] will be missed by all of us.\\" Services for the Pattersons were held on October 15 at the Trinity United Methodist Church in Ruston. Interment was at Pines Memorial Cemetery in Ruston. The Pattersons had a daughter, Lee Ann Teer (born ca. 1974) and her husband, Mark Anthony Teer (born ca. 1962), of Yukon, Oklahoma, a son, James A. \\"Tony\\" Patterson (born ca. 1960) and his wife Melanie Rigney Patterson of Haughton in Bossier Parish, and a grandson, Evan James Teer. Mrs. Patterson was survived by a brother, John Charles Bates of Gulfport, Mississippi, and two sisters, Peggy Joyce Tuggle of Shreveport and Cathy Jane Dick of Chandler, Texas. The Pattersons will be memorialized through the Pat and Glenda Patterson Memorial Baseball Scholarship Fund in care of the Louisiana Tech Athletic Department in Ruston.

Semiotics, as originally defined by Ferdinand de Saussure, is \\"the science of the life of signs in society\\". Social semiotics expands on Saussure's founding insights by exploring the implications of the fact that the \\"codes\\" of language and communication are formed by social processes. The crucial implication here is that meanings and semiotic systems are shaped by relations of power, and that as power shifts in society, our languages and other systems of socially accepted meanings can and do change. Overview Social semiotics is the study of the social dimensions of meaning, and of the power of human processes of signification and interpretation (known as semiosis) in shaping individuals and societies. Social semiotics focuses on social meaning-making practices of all types, whether visual, verbal or aural in nature (Thibault, 1991). These different systems for meaning-making, or possible \\"channels\\" (e.g. speech, writing, images) are known as semiotic modes (or semiotic registers). Semiotic modes can include visual, verbal, written, gestural and musical resources for communication. They also include various \\"multimodal\\" ensembles of any of these modes (Kress and van Leeuwen, 2001). Social semiotics can include the study of how people design and interpret meanings, the study of texts, and the study of how semiotic systems are shaped by social interests and ideologies, and how they are adapted as society changes (Hodge and Kress, 1988). Structuralist semiotics in the tradition of Ferdinand de Saussure focused primarily on theorising semiotic systems or structures (termed langue by de Saussure, which change diachronically, i.e. over longer periods of time). In contrast, social semiotics tries to account for the variability of semiotic practices termed parole by Saussure. This altered focus shows how individual creativity, changing historical circumstances, and new social identities and projects can all change patterns of usage and design (Hodge and Kress, 1988). From a social semiotic perspective, rather than being fixed into unchanging \\"codes\\", signs are considered to be resources which people use and adapt (or \\"design\\") to make meaning. In these respects, social semiotics was influenced by, and shares many of the preoccupations of pragmatics (Charles W. Morris) and sociolinguistics and has much in common with cultural studies and critical discourse analysis. The main task of social semiotics is to develop analytical and theoretical frameworks which can explain meaning-making in a social context (Thibault, 1991). Halliday and the social semiotic in language Linguistic theorist, Michael Halliday, introduced the term ‚Äòsocial semiotics‚Äô into linguistics, when he used the phrase in the title of his book, Language as Social Semiotic. This work argues against the traditional separation between language and society, and exemplifies the start of a 'semiotic' approach, which broadens the narrow focus on written language in linguistics (1978). For Halliday, languages evolve as systems of \\"meaning potential\\" (Halliday, 1978:39) or as sets of resources which influence what the speaker can do with language, in a particular social context. For example, for Halliday, the grammar of the English language is a system organised for the following three purposes (areas or \\"metafunctions\\"): * Facilitating certain kinds of social and interpersonal interactions (interpersonal), * Representing ideas about the world (ideational), and * Connecting these ideas and interactions into meaningful texts and making them relevant to their context (textual) (1978:112). Any sentence in English is composed like a musical composition, with one strand of its meaning coming from each of the three semiotic areas or metafunctions.

Pratt Library, Victoria University, Canada. # ‚ÄòLanguage is a social fact‚Äô (1978:1) # ‚ÄòWe shall not come to understand the nature of language if we pursue only the kinds of question about language that are formulated by linguists‚Äô (1978:3) #‚ÄòLanguage is as it is because of the functions it has evolved to serve in people‚Äôs lives‚Äô (1978:4). # Language has ‚Äòmetafunctions‚Äô, which in English are: ideational (‚Äòabout something‚Äô), interpersonal (‚Äôdoing something‚Äô) and textual (‚Äòthe speaker‚Äôs text-forming potential‚Äô) (1978:112). # Language is constituted as ‚Äòa discrete network of options‚Äô (1978:113) Social semiotics and critical linguistics Robert Hodge and Gunther Kress's Social Semiotics (1988) focused on the uses of semiotic systems in social practice. They explain that the social power of texts in society depends on interpretation: \\"Each producer of a message relies on its recipients for it to function as intended.\\" (1988:4) This process of interpretation (semiosis) situates individual texts within discourses, the exchanges of interpretative communities. The work of interpretation can contest the power of hegemonic discourses. Hodge and Kress give the example of feminist activists defacing a sexist advertising billboard, and spray-painting it with a new, feminist message. > \\"Text is only a trace of discourses, frozen and preserved, more or less > reliable or misleading. Yet discourse disappears too rapidly, surrounding a > flow of texts.\\" (1988:8) Hodge and Kress built on a range of traditions from linguistics (including Noam Chomsky, Michael Halliday, Benjamin Lee Whorf and sociolinguistics), but the major impetus for their work is the critical perspective on ideology and society that originates with Marx. Hodge and Kress build a notion of semiosis as a dynamic process, where meaning is not determined by rigid structures, or predefined cultural codes. They argue that Ferdinand de Saussure's structuralist semiotics avoided addressing questions about creativity, movement, and change in language, possibly in reaction to the diachronic linguistic traditions of his time (the focus on the historical development from Indo-European). This created a \\"problematic\\" legacy, with linguistic change relegated to the \\"contents of Saussure‚Äôs rubbish bin\\" (1988:16-17). Instead, Hodge and Kress propose to account for change in semiosis through the work of Charles Sanders Peirce. Meaning is a process, in their interpretation of Peirce. They refer to Peirce's triadic model of semiosis, which depicts the \\"action\\" of a sign as a limitless process of infinite semiosis, where one \\"interpretant\\" (or idea linked to a sign) generates another. The flow of these infinite processes of interpretation are constrained in Peirce's model, they claim, by the material world (the \\"object\\"), and cultural rules of thought, or \\"habit\\". (1988:20) Social semiotics revisits De Saussure's doctrine of the \\"arbitrariness of the linguistic sign\\". This notion rests on the argument that the signifier only has an arbitrary relationship to the signified) ‚Äî in other words, that there is nothing about the sound or appearance of (verbal) signifiers (as, for example, the words \\"dog\\" or \\"chien\\") ‚Äî to suggest what they signify. Hodge and Kress point out that questions of the referent become more complicated when semiotics moves beyond verbal language. On the one hand, there is the need to account for the continuum of relationships between the referent and the representation. Here, they draw on Pierce's differentiation between iconic signification (e.g. a colour photograph of smoke, where the signifier recreates the perceptual experience of the signified), indexical signification (e.g. a column of smoke, where there is a causal relationship between the physical signifier and the fire it might signify), and symbolic signification (e.g. the word \\"smoke\\", where the arbitrary link between signifier and signified is maintained by social convention). Social semiotics also addresses the question of how societies and cultures maintain or shift these conventional bonds between signifier and signified. De Saussure was unwilling to answer this question, Hodge and Kress claim. This leaves the socially determinist implication that meanings and interpretations are dictated from above, by \\"the whims of an inscrutably powerful collective being, Society.\\" For Hodge and Kress, social semiotics must respond to the question and explain how the social shaping of meanings works in practice (1988:22). Social semiotics and multimodality Social semiotics is currently extending this general framework beyond its linguistic origins to account for the growing importance of sound and visual images, and how modes of communication are combined in both traditional and digital media (semiotics of social networking) (see, for example, Kress and van Leeuwen, 1996), thus approaching semiotics of culture (Randviir 2004). Theorists such as Gunther Kress and Theo van Leeuwen have built on Halliday's framework by providing new \\"grammars\\" for other semiotic modes. Like language, these grammars are seen as socially formed and changeable sets of available \\"resources\\" for making meaning, which are also shaped by the semiotic metafunctions originally identified by Halliday. The visual and aural modes have received particular attention. Accounting for multimodality (communication in and across a range of semiotic modes - verbal, visual, and aural) is considered a particularly important ongoing project, given the importance of the visual mode in contemporary communication. In the field of graphic design, the multimodal and social semiotic viewpoint can be perceived as an illustration that connects our sensory abilities together opening up new opportunities for deeper visual interaction. Utilizing this design process, the graphic designers create content which helps improvise the act of meaningful visual communication between the content creators and their audiences.

The lynching of Joe Coe occurred outside the Courthouse in 1891. Angered because of believing that a young girl had died after being attacked by him (the girl had not died, and the allegation was never proven), hundreds of men had overwhelmed the small police force. They dragged Coe from his cell and hanged him from streetcar cables at the corner of 17th and Harney.Taylor, Quintard.

When the new courthouse was built, the old building was torn down and recycled. Materials from the old courthouse building were used in the construction of the Lancaster Apartments at 25th Avenue and Marcy Street. The dark stone on the lower two stories and the white pillars at each of the main entrances were from the courthouse, as well as possibly some of the stones in the courtyard wall along the alley. Present courthouse Close up photo of courthouse; present day. John Latenser, a locally important architect, was hired to design a replacement building in 1908. It opened October 1, 1912. Built south of the old courthouse, the new building is six stories tall along Harney Street and five stories along Farnam. While the exterior walls are covered with unembellished Bedford stone, the interior halls have mosaic floors and marble wainscotings. Hardwood covers the interior of most offices, and vaults preserve county records. There were county offices on the main floor, second and third floors, and courtrooms on the fourth floor. The Douglas County Jail was on the fifth floor.Wakeley, Arthur. (1917) Omaha: The Gate City and Douglas County Nebraska. Chicago: S.J. Clarke Publishing Company. p 131-33. In September 1919, following Red Summer and race riots in numerous industrial cities, a mob of thousands of white men from South Omaha surrounded and attacked the Courthouse seeking to lynch an African-American worker named Willy Brown (accused of assaulting a white woman). Young white men broke windows and climbed the outside of the building. After a few hours, thousands more gathered and they set the courthouse on fire to force the police to hand over the suspect. After lynching Brown and the city's mayor Edwards, who was rescued at the last minute, the mob swarmed toward the city's black quarter. They were stopped by federal troops from Fort Omaha, who had been called in to restore order in the city. The military commander posted troops in South Omaha to prevent other mobs from forming.Luebke, F.C. (1995) Nebraska: An Illustrated History. University of Nebraska Press. p 246. In 1948, Rev. John P. Markoe, S.J., led an early civil rights effort with an interracial group of about 30 people from Creighton University to hold the city's first sit-in at old Dixon's Cafe next to the courthouse. When the group arrived, the owner told them that white customers would stop coming into the restaurant if blacks were served. In response, the members stayed until the owner agreed to allow African-American patrons.Graves, S.

In boxing parlance, fundamental punches are commonly assigned numbers by trainers and in this case there is the jab (#1) and the cross (#2). Boxers begin practicing the basics starting with offense and generally learn punches starting with the fundamentals - the jab (#1), the cross (#2), then onward to more complex punches such as the lead hook (#3), right uppercut (#4), and left uppercut (#5). As boxers learn the fundamentals they begin to learn how to incorporate these punches together in a variety of combinations. The \\"one-two combo\\" is the first combination a boxer will learn from their coach that utilizes different punches, this is because the one-two combo consist of two fundamental punches first learned as a beginner. It is one of the most commonly used combinations in boxing. In a one-two combo, the objective is to get in range and land a power-punch. In this situation, both the jab and cross have different purposes. Naturally, the boxing stance has the lead hand in front, closer to the opponent while the dominant hand is in the back, further from the opponent. In this combo, the jab (lead hand) is designed as a range finder to close the distance between a fighter and their opponent to set up a power-punch (back hand). In a one-two combo the cross is the power punch due to the torque and rotation of the body required when using this technique. While throwing this combo, the jab is thrown while stepping forward into range and is followed by the cross while the jab is retracted back to guard, after the cross makes impact it is then retracted back to guard. When this combination lands successfully, the boxer's jab is used to lift their opponent's head in order to expose their chin for their cross - resulting in the one-two combo.

BOSCO (standing for Battery Operated Systems for Community Outreach, but named also in honor of the Roman Catholic Saint John Bosco) collaborated with Inveneo to place their low-power PCs powered by solar panels in the Catechist Training Center and the Caritas Office in Gulu, as well as at schools, hospitals, colleges and Churches in the Pabbo, Alero, Lacor, Coope, Jen'Geri, Unyama, and Pagak IDP camps. The organization aims to use ICT to help end the isolation of communities in rural northern Uganda as well as improve education, economics, human rights documentation, health care and rural development. Regional history Twenty years of conflict and displacement have isolated the people of northern Uganda from the technological developments rapidly evolving in their own country and throughout the world. This isolation and lack of access to 21st century Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) has prevented communities from using the Internet for creative and innovative ways to meet community needs. Instead, many communities have become reliant on traditional aid. However, with peace in northern Uganda, BOSCO-Uganda attempts to turn dependency into self-advocacy through the use of innovative and collaborative ICT technologies. Initiated in 2006 under the umbrella of Gulu Archdiocese, BOSCO-Uganda implemented a pilot ICT project in 6 IDP-camps in Gulu and Amuru district (including Choo Pe, Unyama, Lacor, Pagak, Pabbo and Jengari). BOSCO- Uganda has since expanded its activities in Amuru and Gulu and is planning the further expansion to Kitgum and Pader Districts. BOSCO-Uganda uses innovative technology particularly adapted to rural regions. Its internet stations, situated in rural communities and former internally displaced persons camps, consist of low-power, solar powered PCs connected to a high-speed, long-range WiFi Internet connection. Each communication station is linked to other BOSCO sites via a free VoIP telephony network and through a high-speed internal network (INTRANET) content management page. Moving beyond the provision of technical solutions, BOSCO is concentrating on the development of both proven and emerging directions for ICT usage. These directions include computer education adapted to the realities of 21st Century global interconnectivity and a Web 2.0 collaborative approach to cooperation with health centers, e-agriculture, educational outreach, e-government, etc. Organizational history BOSCO USA was founded by Gus Zuehlke in 2007. Mr. Zuehlke established relationships with the Archdiocese of Gulu, including the Archbishop John Baptist Odama and Fr. Joseph Okumu, who is now the BOSCO- Uganda Executive Director. In 2007, northern Uganda was benefiting from a tenuous cease fire, yet nearly 1.7 million people throughout the region remained stuck and isolated in Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) camps. Mr. Zuehlke discussed some of the needs and challenges the archdiocese and the people were facing. The Archbishop's priority was to help the Acholi people of northern Uganda end the severe isolation they were experiencing in the camps. By connecting camp schools, community centers, parishes, and health clinics to the outside world through Internet, the Acholi people could begin to end their isolation by advocating for their own cause. In 2007 Mr. Zuehlke assembled an all volunteer Board of Directors and incorporated BOSCO, Inc. as a 501(c)3 not for profit organization. In April 2007, with the help of Inveneo and BOSCO's Founding Technical Director, Ted Pethick, BOSCO deployed the first set of low power, solar, PCs with long-range WiFi Internet in 6 site locations. BOSCO USA has watched BOSCO-Uganda grow as they now employ a Uganda-based staff and administration and have expanded the BOSCO network to 22 sites. BOSCO-Uganda has attracted partnerships from both local and international development organizations, including War Child Holland and UNICEF.  BOSCO-USA =Role= Since the founding, BOSCO USA, based in South Bend, Indiana, has taken on a distinct role for BOSCO-Uganda. BOSCO-Uganda, in Gulu, handles the day-to-day operations of the organization and employs a local, Ugandan staff.

Since January 1, 2017, he has been Mayor of Rio de Janeiro for the Republicanos party. In 2002, Crivella was elected as a federal Senator of Brazil from the state of Rio de Janeiro on the Liberal Party ticket.St√•lsett, S.J. Spirits of Globalization: The Growth of insanity and Experiential Spiritualities in a Global Age. University of Michigan SCM Press, 2006. p. 51. He has since helped found the Brazilian Republican Party (PRB) which has been allied with President Lu√≠s In√°cio Lula da Silva. With a Civil Engineering degree from Universidade Santa Ursula, Crivella became known for planning and execution of the Projeto Nordeste, a charitable project to redevelop lands abandoned by the Brazilian federal government in the city of Irec√™. The project was developed to use Israeli irrigation practices, which Crivella has observed in his several trips to Israel. It has led to the renewal of agriculture and livestock raising there. He is a bishop of the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God which is an international evangelical church founded by his uncle Edir Macedo in 1977. Early life Born in Rio de Janeiro to Catholic parents, Crivella attended the Methodist Church in his youth. His connection with his uncle, Edir Macedo, made them try an unsuccessful commercial partnership, before he was invited in 1977, to work in Macedo's newly founded Universal Church. Soon Crivella became a pastor. Religious career He took his family on a mission to Africa in 1992, where he achieved considerable success in planting new UCKG temples, although he spoke no African languages. He became pastor and bishop, having worked ten years diffusing the Universal Church in the African continent. Crivella is a lively preacher, who attracts very large crowds; in his first major event, he spoke at the Nilson Gymnasium in xx, which holds 25,000 people. In 1999, he was part of an event at the Maracana sports stadium in Rio de Janeiro, where the overflow crowd was accommodated by getting to follow the action on huge screens. By 1999, he had signed a contract with Sony Records for three disks, one to be in Spanish. His religious preaching is also conveyed by radio. Crivella has recorded as a singer, often using his own songs. He has been a major figure in gospel music in Brazil. He has released 14 disks, selling more than 5 million copies. His biggest success was his first album, O Mensageiro da Solidariedade (The Messenger of Solidarity). The albums were recorded by Line Records, where Crivella was considered the principal artist, and by Sony Music. Crivella is the author of the books Hist√≥rias de Sabedoria e Humildade, a collection of moral and religious tales, Um Sonho que se Tornou Realidade, which is about the Projeto Nordeste, and ‚ÄúEvangelizando a √Åfrica,‚Äù a book he wrote during his 10 years he spent in Africa as a missionary. He is considered a preacher of the prosperity gospel. Political career Marcelo Crivella entered to the political life, having acquired great name recognition in the Rio de Janeiro area. He was a founder of the Brazilian Republican Party (PRB) and ran successfully for the position of Senator in the 2002 elections. Crivella was elected at the same time as Sergio Cabral Filho, who had a mandate for the period 2003‚Äì2011. In 2006 Crivella ran for governor of Rio de Janeiro state. He ran for mayor of the capital in 2004 and 2008, but was unsuccessful in the three races. In 2004 he came in second in the disputed Rio de Janeiro municipal election, but he did not succeed to go to the second round against C√©sar Maia. He complained about negative coverage by the O Globo newspaper, which published several matters accusing him of fraud. It is owned by the second-largest media conglomerate in the country. In 2006, he was gubernatorial candidate for the state of Rio de Janeiro, and was supported by the President Lu√≠s In√°cio Lula da Silva. Polls leading up to the election said he was in second place. But, in the last week, he was superseded by Denise Frossard, the candidate of the PPS, and Crivella declined to participate in the runoff election. In 2008, he ran for mayor of the state capital, but came in 3rd place in the first round and was eliminated. Crivella reached the second round but was defeated on his running for Governor of Rio de Janeiro in 2014 by Luiz Fernando Pez√£o. In 2016, Marcelo Crivella won the election for Rio de Janeiro Mayor beating left-wing candidate Marcelo Freixo by a margin of approximately 20 percentage points. He is the first Pentecostal to govern a big Brazilian city. As mayor of Rio de Janeiro, Crivella called the Carnival of Rio de Janeiro, which is rooted in the afro-Brazilian religions, an \\"unchristian excess\\" and ordered severe financial cuts for the organisators.Philipp Lichterbeck: Brasilien: Droht dem Karneval das Aus? In: Der Tagesspiegel. December 19, 2017, accessed on January 6, 2020. Parliamentary conduct Federal Senate in May 2015 In the Brazilian Senate, Crivella has established himself as a representative of the Brazilian diaspora, as many citizens are working abroad. He was president of the Subcomiss√£o Permanente de Prote√ß√£o dos Cidad√£os Brasileiros no Exterior (Permanent Subcommittee on Protection of Brazilian Citizens Abroad), subject to the Comiss√£o de Rela√ß√µes Exteriores e Defesa Nacional (Committee on Foreign Relations and National Defense), of which Crivella was vice president. As an example, he has led efforts to gain better treatment of Brazilians picked up in the United States as illegal immigrants. As policy, they are detained while their cases are being reviewed, but that can be a lengthy process. =Personal views= Crivella identifies as a conservative politician but he has been a great ally of President Lula. His party is part of the base of support to government. Crivella opposes the legalization of abortion. Crivella favors public policies for family planning through sex education and sterilization, and the Law on Biosafety, which regulates research with stem cells. He opposes civil unions for homosexuals and the codification of homophobia. After protests by activists, he explained that he feared unintended consequences of a proposed law against homophobia, but certainly wants protections and equal rights for homosexuals. Veja magazine had a cover story about the influence of Charles Darwin, who developed the theory of evolution. In an interview, Crivella said that he is a creationist and rejects this theory. The Senator said \\"there is no conclusive proofs that [...] one species could generate another species\\". Criticism He has been criticized for his 1999 book Evangelizing Africa which found him saying that homosexuality was a \\"terrible evil,\\" that Catholics were demonic, that African religions were based on \\"evil spirits,\\" and that Hindus drank their children's blood. He has since tried to distance himself from the book, saying that it was the work of a young, immature missionary.

It is created by combining norcocaine with inactivated cholera toxin. It works in much the same way as a regular vaccine. A large protein molecule attaches to cocaine, which stimulates response from antibodies, which destroy the molecule. This also prevents the cocaine from crossing the blood‚Äìbrain barrier, negating the euphoric high and rewarding effect of cocaine caused from stimulation of dopamine release in the mesolimbic reward pathway. The vaccine does not affect the user's \\"desire\\" for cocaine‚Äîonly the physical effects of the drug. Results Phase III Clinical Trials showed no significant difference between users given placebo and users given TA-CD. Patients in the high antibody group had a lower drop out rate and fewer positive cocaine urine results in the last 2 weeks of the trial, but it was not significant versus the low antibody or placebo group. However at other points of the study, high antibody users had more positive urine results. This is most likely due to users trying to overcome the antibodies by taking more excessive amounts of cocaine.

He also collaborated with R&B; singer Etta James for two critically acclaimed albums in the early 1970s, mixing blues, soul, land then topped it off with Genya Ravan production jazz and rock. Career Born in Palestine (pre-1948 Israel) Mekler was a classically trained pianist. Upon arriving in Los Angeles, California, Mekler sought out Dunhill Records and was hired as a staff producer, despite his lack of production experience or familiarity with rock and roll and pop music. His first project at Dunhill was with folk-pop band The Lamp of Childhood, where he oversaw studio sessions, contributed songs and played piano. The group's three singles flopped but Mekler's next project, Steppenwolf, made music history. It was Mekler who suggested the name \\"Steppenwolf\\" to the band's members, having just read the Hermann Hesse novel. As the producer on Steppenwolf, the 1968 debut by that group, Mekler helped craft the sonic onslaught that would unleash the term \\"heavy metal\\" upon the world, a line from the brother of drummer, Jerry Edmonton (real name McCrohan), in the song, \\"Born to Be Wild\\". The mysterious Mars Bonfire was Dennis Edmonton (McCrohan), lead guitarist for Jack London & The Sparrows. The Oshawa, Ontario group was the beginnings of Steppenwolf and producer Mekler's contributions on psychedelic tracks such as \\"Born to Be Wild\\" and \\"Magic Carpet Ride\\". A year after the Steppenwolf recordings, Mekler launched hits from Three Dog Night such as \\"One\\", \\"Try a Little Tenderness\\", \\"Eli's Coming\\", \\"Easy to Be Hard\\", and \\"Celebrate\\". Other studio credits include keyboard work with Cher, Donovan and David Clayton-Thomas as well as producing songs for Dinah Washington. He married Dorothy J. Scully on 2 August 1967 in Los Angeles, CA, and they divorced in November, 1974 in Los Angeles, CA. Mekler was Jewish. In 1971, Mekler founded his own labels, Vulture and Lizard Records, based on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles. Artists signed to Lizard/Vulture included Nolan Porter, Clydie King, Jamul, Paul Humphrey & the Cool Aid Chemists and The Frantics. Despite national chart success both Vulture and Lizard Records collapsed in mid 1972. Mekler remained in demand for his production talent until his death from a motorcycle accident, in September 1977. Mekler also produced Genya Ravan's Goldie Zelkowitz album, the title utilizing her stage name from Goldie and the Gingerbreads, and her father's last name, who died during this recording.

He is the only American dressage rider to win an individual medal at an Olympic Games. Tuttle was a lawyer in Boston prior to being a US Army quartermaster officer from 1930 to 1944. He owned and trained his own horses, unusual in a time when the majority of Olympic competitors rode Army-owned horses, and is buried near three of them at the cemetery in Fort Riley. Biography Tuttle originally trained and practiced as a lawyer in Boston, but in 1917 joined the US Army as a commissioned officer. Between 1930 and his retirement as a colonel in 1944, he held at post in Fort Riley, Kansas, at the Cavalry School. Tuttle's equestrian skills were largely self-taught, and he became the top dressage rider in the US before the majority of the country even knew such a sport existed. Army historian Louis DiMarco says, \\"Tuttle did so much with so little and was so little appreciated. He was the only officer to focus strictly on dressage. Everybody else in the Army world...who did dressage learned what to do and how to do it from him.\\" Tuttle owned and trained his own horses, partially so that the horses could focus strictly on dressage and not be used for other sports or cavalry exercises; this was unusual for the times. He was set apart from many of the Olympic riders of the time by being older, not a West Point graduate, a quartermaster officer, and riding in dressage when few other officers appreciated the formality and discipline of the sport. He trained many of the military dressage riders who followed in his footsteps, including Major Robert Borg who competed in dressage at the 1948 and 1952 Summer Games. After his retirement, Tuttle continued to ride and train, and never sold his Olympic mounts. He is buried along with three of his horses (Vast, Si Murray and Olympic) at the Fort Riley cemetery. In 2002, Tuttle was inducted into the United States Dressage Federation Hall of Fame in \\"recognition of his seminal contributions as a Cavalry officer to the development of dressage in the U.S.\\" Competition In 1932 the Americans participated in the team dressage competition for the first time since 1920. Tuttle competed in his first Olympic Games at the 1932 Los Angeles Games. At this event, he took bronze in the individual dressage, becoming the first American dressage rider in Olympic history to win an individual medal. This distinction is one that he holds as of 2012. It is also the only Olympics where Americans won individual medals in all three equestrian events (dressage, show jumping and three-day eventing). The American team, which included Tuttle, also won a bronze. His horse in these events, named Olympic, had been purchased for $1. In 1936, Tuttle returned to Olympic competition in at the Berlin Games. However, he only placed 27th individually out of 29 riders, with the American team taking 9th out of nine teams entered. Two horses used by the Americans, Si Murray and Olympic, were trained by Tuttle. Tuttle stated in a post-Games report that a German coach had told him that a winning dressage team needed \\"European-bred horses, European competition experience and political clout in the host country; and that, having none of these, the Americans likely wouldn't fare well\\"; based on the American's performance, Tuttle concluded the coach was correct.

History =Territorial Defence= In 1988 The Yugoslav Army had placed the Bosnian provincial Territorial Defence Force under 1 Military District (Belgrade), and reduced its strength two-thirds to 86,362 in December 1991. The Bosnian TO was gained control by the Bosnian-Serb SDS in the coalition government. On 19 December 1990 Alija Izetbegoviƒá and the SDA party alarmed by the SDS's secessionists attitudes discussed forming an independent Bosnian army later Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In March 1991 Sefer Haliloviƒá formed the Patriotic League (Patriotska Liga - PL) as an independent Bosnian army, with the same territorial organization as the TO. It was in early 1992 that the JNA, Bosnian-Serb and Serbian paramilitary militias began attacking Bosnian-Muslim and Bosnian-Croat towns and villages the first ones being Sarajevo by the JNA and Bijeljina by paramilitary forces. On 4 April, Alija Izetbegoviƒá ordered general mobilization: and on 8 April he transformed the Sarajevo TO command into GHQ of the Teritorijalna Odbrana Republike Bosne i Hercegovine (Territorial Defence Force of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina) (TORBIH), appointing the Bosnian-Muslim Colonel Hasan Efendiƒá as commander of the army, Colonel Stjepan ≈†iber, a Bosnian-Croat, became chief- of-staff, and Colonel Jovan Divjak, a Bosnian-Serb, his deputy. The TO was formally established on 15 April when all Patriotic League units joined the force. On 20 May 1992 the TORBIH, PL, and other militias and the Bosnian-Croat HVO and HOS were officially united as Armed Forces of the Republic of Bosnia- Herzegovina (Oruzane Snage Republike Bosne i Hercegovine). On 23 May Colonel Efendiƒá was replaced as commander by Sefer Haliloviƒá. =Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina= On 20 May 1992 the TORBIH was renamed Armija Republike Bosne i Hercegovine (Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina) - ARBIH, usually abbreviated ABIH. In November 1993, Sefer Haliloviƒá was replaced as commander of ABIH by Rasim Deliƒá. Organization 1992‚Äì1994 The ARBIH, now around 80,000 strong was reorganized on 18 August 1992 into a more conventional structure. Initially four corps were created: 1st Corps (Sarajevo); 2nd Corps (Tuzla) in northern Bosnia; 3rd Corps (Zenica) and 4th Corps (Mostar) in Herzegovina; the Eastern Bosnian Operational Group in the eastern enclaves of Gora≈æde. 5th Corps (Bihaƒá) was established on 21 October 1992 from the Una-Sana Operational Group to defend the North-Western Bosnian enclave. The 7th Corps (Travnik) was established on 7 April 1994 with brigades from the 3rd Corps to advance north-westward through southern Bosnia. The 6th Corps (Konjic) was formed in June 1993 from the 4th Corps Northern Herzegovina Operational Group, to occupy northern Hercegovina from the HVO and eventually reach the Adriatic coast. Each corps controlled a number of brigades, independent battalions and companies. Brigades were designed as infantry, mountain, motorized or light and given new three digit numbers, the first number indicating the corps. The larger corps (1st, 2nd and 3rd) comprised 15 Operationa Groups, each with 3‚Äì7 brigades. From August 1992 to December 1994 about 105 brigades were formed or reformed in the 1-527 series: 48 infantry or undesigned, 41 mountain, 10 motorized and 6 light, but not all brigades existed at the same time. There were also single commando and reconnaissance, Military Police battalions and artillery brigades: the various independent units included the Delta SF Unit, four commando detachments, six Corps HQ MP battalions, a mixed artillery battalion and an independent armoured company. Eight Bosnian-Croat HVO units were incorporated into the ABIH. Crni Labudovi was a PL unit formed in April 1992 from refugees in Konjic under the 4th Corps (later 1st Corps), they eventually numbered 800 men and earned a reputation for battlefield bravery. Some PL units after the absorption by the TORBIH still operated independently. PL personnel wore \\"Green Berets\\" as did many ABIH units. The ABIH assigned 15 mixed aircraft to corps HQs to supply 5th corps in Bihac and 2nd corps in the Gora≈æde, Srebrenica and ≈Ωepa area. The Bosnian Police (Policija Republike Bosne i Hercegovine) were formed in 1992 from districts under Bosnian control and there was a Bosnian Special Police Unit (specijalna jedinica). There were no naval forces. Organization 1995 In January 1995 the ARBIH now expanded to 200,000 reorganized. The Operational Groups in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 7th Corps were redesigned as divisions, each division comprising 3‚Äì6 brigades, but the 4th and 5th Corps kept their brigades and structure. It was a much improved fighting force.

It is the only confirmed pharmacologically active metabolite of cocaine, although salicylmethylecgonine is also speculated to be an active metabolite. The local anesthetic potential of norcocaine has been shown to be higher than that of cocaine, however cocaine continues to be more widely used. Norcocaine used for research purposes is typically synthesized from cocaine. Several methods for the synthesis have been described. Legal status The legal status of norcocaine is somewhat ambiguous. The US DEA does not list norcocaine as a controlled substance. However, some suppliers of norcocaine, like Sigma-Aldrich, consider the drug to be a Schedule II drug (same as cocaine) for the purpose of their own sales. Toxicity The LD50 of norcocaine has been studied in mice. When administered by the intraperitoneal route the LD50 in mice was 40 mg/kg. Role in hair drug testing controversy Some researchers have suggested that hair drug testing for cocaine use should include testing for metabolites like norcocaine. The basis for this suggestion is the potential for external contamination of hair during testing. There is considerable debate about whether current means of washing hair samples are sufficient for removing external contamination. Some researchers state the methods are sufficient, while others state the residual contamination may result in a false positive test. Metabolites of cocaine, like norcocaine, in addition to cocaine, should be present in samples from drug users. Authors have stated that the metabolites should be present in any samples declared positive. Issues arise because the metabolites are present in only low concentrations. If the metabolites are present, it is possible for them to be from other contamination.

United States, 296 F. Supp. 3 (N.D. Ohio 1969), is a historic case decided by the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, where the court ruled that treasure trove property is included in gross income for the tax year when it was discovered. The case is frequently cited in American law school textbooks as an example of the nuances of income taxation.  Facts  The plaintiffs were a husband and wife who purchased a used piano at an auction sale in 1957 for approximately $15.00. In 1964, while cleaning the piano, they discovered $4,467.00 in old currency in the piano. Plaintiffs exchanged the old currency for new at a bank and reported $4,467.00 on their 1964 joint U.S. federal income tax return as ordinary income from other sources. On October 18, 1965, the couple filed an amended return, eliminating $4,467.00 from the gross income computation and requesting a refund of $836.51. On January 18, 1966, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rejected their refund claim, and they later filed a lawsuit. The taxpayers asserted three arguments: (1) $4,467.00 is not includable in gross income under Internal Revenue Code section 61; (2) Even if the money was gross income, it was due and owing in the year the piano was purchased, 1957, and by 1964 the statute of limitations provided by 26 U.S.C. Sec. 6501 had elapsed; and (3) If the money is gross income in 1964, then plaintiffs are entitled to capital gains treatment under Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code.  Issues  # Whether the monies found in the piano are includable as gross income? # Whether taxes on the monies were due in the year the piano was purchased or in the year the monies were found? # Whether plaintiffs are entitled to capital gains treatment?  Holding  The receipt of the monies constituted gross income in 1964, the year in which the funds were reduced to undisputed possession. Plaintiffs are not entitled to a refund, nor are they entitled to capital gains treatment.  Reasoning  The monies in the piano are includable as gross income for three reasons. First, an IRS Revenue Ruling states, ‚Äúthe finder of treasure trove is in receipt of taxable income, for Federal income tax purposes, to the extent of its value in United States currency, for the taxable year in which it is reduced to undisputed possession.‚ÄùCesarini, 296 F.Supp. at 5; Rev. Rul. 61, 1953-1, Cum. Bull. 17. Second, numerous Supreme Court cases recognize the broad sweeping construction of Section 61(a) found in Treas. Reg. Sec. 1.61-1(a).Cesarini, 296 F.Supp. at 6. Third, other courts and commentators have taken the position that windfalls, including found monies, were properly includable in gross income under Section 22(a) of the 1939 Code, which is the predecessor of Section 61(a) in the 1954/1986 Code. Plaintiffs were unable to point to any inconsistencies between the gross income sections of the Code, the interpretation of them by the regulations and the courts, and the revenue rulings.Cesarini, 296 F.Supp. at 7. Thus, the monies found in the piano constituted gross income. The monies were properly included as gross income for the calendar year of 1964. Problems of when title vests, or when possession is complete, as it relates to federal taxation and in the absence of definitive federal legislation, is determined by state law. Ohio does not have a statute dealing with the rights of owners and finders of treasure trove, thus the English common-law rule applies. English common-law rule states that ‚Äútitle belongs to the finder as against all the world except the true owner.‚Äù Thus, Plaintiffs must have actually found the money to have superior title over all but the true owner. The $4,467.00 was not ‚Äúreduced to undisputed possession‚Äù until actual discovery in 1964. Pursuant to Treas. Reg. Sec. 1.61-14, ‚Äútreasure trove, to the extent of its value in United States currency, constitutes gross income for the taxable year in which it is reduced to undisputed possession.‚Äù Therefore the United States is not barred by the statute of limitations from collecting the $836.51 in tax in 1964. Capital gains treatment is not applicable in this case. At the time relevant to this case, section 1222(3) of the Internal Revenue Code defined long-term capital gains as gains resulting from the sale or exchange of capital assets held for more than 6 months.Cesarini, 296 F. Supp. at 8. Neither the piano nor the currency were sold or exchanged; thus, the plaintiffs were not entitled to capital gains treatment.  Real world impact  Cesarini is important for further defining gross income under Section 61(a). It extends gross income to treasure troves and requires that taxpayers list the income in the year in which it is reduced to undisputed possession. Cesarini alerts taxpayers to the notion that many things may constitute gross income even though they are not explicitly identified in the Tax Code. Taxpayers should consult all sources, including Treasury Regulations, before making assumptions about what constitutes income.

It is a Nature Conservation Review site, Grade 2, a National Nature Reserve and a Ramsar site It is part of the Norfolk Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, and the Roydon Common & Dersingham Bog Special Area of Conservation Part of it is a Geological Conservation Review site. Location Entrance to the reserve Dersingham Bog is near the West Norfolk Villages of Dersingham and Wolferton and is one of the few remaining wilderness areas left in this part of Norfolk which is otherwise dominated by intensive agriculture. The Reserve is part of the Sandringham Royal Estate. Geology The site lies on the north west Norfolk Greensand escarpment. It is notable for a rock dating from the Lower Cretaceous Period known as 'Dersingham Formation' which has been important in understanding the geology of the region. Habitats and wildlife Dersingham Bog contains three distinct habitats, mire, heath and woodland. Acid valley mire is found over much of the low-lying parts of the reserve where the ground is waterlogged for most of the year. Dersingham Bog contains the largest remaining example of this kind of habitat in East Anglia. The mire's make-up of wet acid peat makes it ideal conditions for some rare and diverse species of plants such as bog asphodels (Narthecium ossifragum), round-leaved sundew (Drosera rotundifolia), white beaked sedge (Rhynchospora alba) and cranberry. The mire also has some rare insects such as the black darter dragonfly (Sympetrum danae) and moths such as the light knot grass (Acronicta menyanthidis). In the dark it is possible to see glowworms. The mire lies on shallow peat and is bordered on one side by a steep escarpment containing large areas of dry heath and woodland which marks the edge of an ancient coastline. The woodland at Dersingham is quite recent and contains Scots pine, oak, sweet chestnut, sycamore and birch. The woodland glades attract birds such as redpoll, crossbill, long-eared owl, tree pipit, woodlark, shelduck, nightjar, and sparrowhawk. Access All of Dersingham is open access and there are many well-marked routes to follow which provide easy access for visitors to explore this wilderness. There are free car parks at Wolferton and Scissors Cross. Management The reserve is in the management of Natural England. Memorial to John Denver Dersingham Bog is the location of a bench which commemorates the life of American singer-songwriter and environmentalist John Denver. It was placed there by the Friends of John Denver UK in September 2006.

Argo was born in Hollis, Alabama, on September 22, 1895. He received an appointment to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York, and started school there in 1915. When World War One began, he dropped out of school and enlisted in the Army as a private on May 12, 1917. After the war, in 1919, he returned to the Military Academy and graduated as a second lieutenant. Argo was a field artillery officer in the U.S. Army at a time that the horse was as prominent a part of a successful unit as in a cavalry unit. In 1921, he married Marguerite Hughes of Texas and was transferred to the 8th Training Battery from the 82nd Field Artillery. In 1925, he was stationed at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, which was the home of the U.S. Army School of Fires. In 1928, he was selected to the military equestrian team that took part in a competition in Amsterdam, Netherlands. He returned to Europe in 1930 for the competition in Hamburg, Germany. Now-Captain Argo entered Army, Field Artillery and American history books when he competed in the 1928 and 1932 Olympics in Los Angeles, Cali. In 1932 he and his horse Honolulu Tom Boy shared the gold medal as members of the American Three-Day Event team in the team eventing competition after finishing eighth at the 1928 Summer Olympics. The three-man team for the Three-Day Event was made up of Argo, Maj. Harry D. Chamberlin and 1st Lt. Earl T. Thomson, both of the 9th Cavalry Regiment, Fort Riley, Kansas. The three faced the best military riders of Holland, Sweden, Japan and Mexico. On the first day of the event, all riders faced a training test. The second day was an endurance ride of 22 ¬Ω miles over five different courses and the last day was stadium jumping where riders a course of 12 jumps at a 14-mile per hour gait. Argo, the only field artillery officer in this part of the competition, rode Honolulu Tom Boy in a remarkable performance without a fault at a jump during the stadium jumping‚Äîthe only rider without a fault that day. The U.S. team led from the start and was described by the 1932 Field Artillery Journal as a ‚Äúglorious achievement for our riders and horses,‚Äù as they took the gold medal. In the individual standings, Thomson took the silver for the U.S., Chamberlin finished fourth and Argo eighth. Argo continued his Army career long after his Olympic glory days. He was transferred to Fort Humphreys, D.C., on April 20, 1939, and promoted to major a few months later. He then served at Fort Riley, Kansas, and Camp Beauregard, Louisiana. Argo was promoted to lieutenant colonel at Camp Beauregard on April 20, 1941, and to full colonel soon after ‚Äî February 1, 1942. Argo retired after 27 years military service on December 31, 1944, and took up residence in Louisiana. He died in Shreveport, Louisiana, at the age of 66 on March 10, 1962.

He has been called \\"America's most closely watched purveyor of industrial design\\" (Washington Post), while his store has been called \\"the best design store in the world.\\"(International Herald Tribune, July 2007) Moss began his career as a professional actor in the United States and Great Britain after his studies at Columbia University and at New York University, School of Arts. In 1978, in collaboration with Dutch designer Ronaldus Shamask, Moss launched the fashion label Shamask, which became known for its architectural, structural designs long before such thinking in clothing came into vogue. The company rapidly expanded to include broad manufacturing of women‚Äôs and men‚Äôs fashions, international distribution and licensing. In 1990, the company‚Äôs trademarks and trade names were sold. With the opening of the Moss shop in 1994, in SoHo, New York City, Moss was able to infuse basic principles of his previous careers into all aspects of the store‚Äîto dramatic effect. Both a sense of theatre and a sensibility reminiscent of experimental fashion characterize the shop, which presents a highly edited selection of both current as well as historical products culled from designers and manufacturers around the world. Like an editor or a curator, Moss changes the presentation of products almost daily, keeping the store fresh and current with new ideas. In 2000, Moss and business/life partner Franklin Edward Getchell expanded the store considerably by annexing two floors of the adjacent gallery, formerly Metro Pictures. In January, 2005, the store expanded yet again into a new corner building next to the existing two Moss shops, opening Moss Gallery, a ‚Äútheatre-like‚Äù space in which regularly scheduled special exhibitions are presented. In May 2006, with partner restaurateur Nicola Marzovilla, the business expanded again, by opening an Italian restaurant and wine shop. Also in 2006, the company opened on Melrose Avenue in Los Angeles, and in 2008, opened a Moss shop in the Philippe Starck designed SLS Hotel at Beverly Hills. The company was a victim of the recession, however, and all shops and galleries closed by early 2012, which is when Moss Bureau was founded. The consultancy works to \\"intervene\\" in museum retail operations, and offers curatorial and other advisory services. Moss is the recipient of the 2002 Chrysler Design Award and Russel Wright Award. In 2000 he was awarded House Beautiful‚Äôs Giants of Design Award and in 2004 he received the Metropolitan Home Modernism Award. In 2007, he received the Travel & Leisure award for Best New Restaurant Design for Centovini. In 2007, he was elected to Interior Design magazine's Hall of Fame.

As the opponent's punch arrives, the fighter bends the legs quickly and simultaneously shifts the body either slightly right or left. Fighters generally begin weaving to the left, as most opponents are orthodox stance, and therefore strike with a left jab first. Common mistakes made with this move include bending at the waist, bending too low, moving in the same direction as the incoming punch, and squaring up.

He also represented England as a youth international. After a moderately successful career in the English League, Bacuzzi settled in the Republic of Ireland where he enjoyed a successful spell as player-manager with Cork Hibernians before going on to manage Home Farm. He later opened a travel agency in Dublin. Bacuzzi was born into an Anglo-Italian family that had settled in London. His paternal grandparents originally came from Milan. His father, Joe Bacuzzi, was also a notable footballer, playing as a defender for both Fulham and England during the Second World War. Playing career =Early years= Born in Islington, London, Bacuzzi began his career with Eastbourne United under the guidance of coach Ron Greenwood. When Greenwood was appointed assistant manager at Arsenal, Bacuzzi eventually followed him. =Arsenal= Bacuzzi signed as amateur for Arsenal in March 1958 and then as a professional in May 1959. He made his First Division debut for the club on 18 February 1961, taking the place of the injured Len Wills, in a 3‚Äì2 win against West Bromwich Albion. During the 1961‚Äì62 season he shared the right-back position with Eddie Magill, playing 22 games. The following season, he lost his place and, as Magill became the first-choice right-back, Bacuzzi only played another 11 first-team matches during 1962‚Äì63 and 1963‚Äì64 seasons. He did, however, help Arsenal Reserves win the Football Combination in 1962‚Äì63. In total he played 48 games for the Arsenal first team. =Manchester City= Bacuzzi signed for Manchester City on 24 April 1964 for a fee of ¬£25,000 and made his league debut for the club in the second game of the 1964‚Äì65 season, a 6‚Äì0 win against Leyton Orient. During the season, which saw City finish as Second Division champions, he played a total of 44 games, a figure matched by only one other City player, Alan Oakes. Bacuzzi started the 1965‚Äì66 season as the first choice right-back under new manager Joe Mercer but as the season went on, he found his place taken by Bobby Kennedy. He played a further 16 times for City before being transferred to Reading. =Reading= Bacuzzi signed for Reading on 9 September 1966 for a fee of ¬£5,000. On 31 January 1968 Reading played against Bacuzzi's former club Manchester City in the FA Cup. They held City to a credible 0‚Äì0 draw at Maine Road but then lost the replay 7‚Äì0. Coaching career =Cork Hibernians= In May 1970 Bacuzzi joined Cork Hibernians as player-manager. Initially, Bacuzzi thought he had been approached from a mysterious exotic location when he received a misspelled telegram asking him to contact Cork Island instead of Cork, Ireland. Bacuzzi subsequently guided Hibs to the League of Ireland title in 1971, beating Shamrock Rovers in a play-off. Then in 1972 and 1973 he also guided them to successive victories in FAI Cup finals. =Home Farm= In 1974 Bacuzzi was appointed manager of Home Farm and in 1975 he guided the club to victory in the FAI Cup for their first and only time. With a team that included Noel King, Dermot Keely and Martin Murray, they beat Dundalk, Cork Celtic and St Patrick's Athletic in earlier rounds before defeating Shelbourne 1‚Äì0 in the final at Dalymount Park. As a result, they became the first amateur team to win FAI Cup in forty years. The following season Bacuzzi took Home Farm into Europe as they competed in the European Cup Winners Cup, playing against French side, RC Lens. They drew 1‚Äì1 at home but lost the away leg 6‚Äì0. As manager of Home Farm, Bacuzzi was responsible for the development of several Republic of Ireland internationals including Ronnie Whelan, Ken DeMange and Brian Mooney, all of whom subsequently signed for Liverpool. However, he also turned down the opportunity to sign a young Paul McGrath after a brief trial. He also managed the League of Ireland XI during the qualifiers for the 1976 and 1980 Olympic Football Tournaments and the amateur team that qualified for the 1978 UEFA Amateur Cup. He was briefly assistant manager at Shamrock Rovers under Jim McLaughlin in 1985.

In 1956, the Sayisi Dene residing at Little Duck Lake () in northern Manitoba were relocated to Churchill. The relocation of the Sayisi Dene is viewed as one of the most grievous errors committed by the federal government.Virginia Phyllis Petch (1998), Relocation and loss of homeland, the story of the Sayisi Dene of Northern Manitoba. A Thesis presented to the University of Manitoba in partial fulfillment of the requirements of a Doctor of Philosophy in Anthropology, The University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, June, 1998 Origin The Chipewyan's ancestral homeland stretched west from Hudson Bay, including the area that straddles northern Manitoba and the southern Northwest Territories, as well as northern Alberta and northern Saskatchewan. Chipewyan lived in bands. Some lived near the port of Churchill, Manitoba, by Hudson Bay. Others lived at North Knife River, north of Churchill. Other lived in the Barren Lands by Nueltin Lake. Still others (\\"Duck Lake Dene\\") established a semi- settled encampment at Little Duck Lake when European traders arrived, calling the former Hudson's Bay Company trading post \\"Caribou Post\\" as it was close to the caribou migration range. Little Duck Lake While some Chipewyan bands evolved into fur trader/hunters, the existence of Duck Lake Dene continued to be centered around hunting caribou whose migratory populations varied between decades. Canadian government officials noted a significant decrease in the caribou population of this region between 1942 and 1955. Duck Lake Dene, called \\"Caribou-eater Chipewyan\\" by Europeans, were considered the main reason for the decline. Churchill re-location In the mid 20th century, caribou dwindled from approximately 670,000 animals in 1942 to 277,000 animals by 1955. According to the Manitoba Government, the decision to relocate the Dene community at Duck Lake was due to incorrect assumptions from Manitoba wildlife officials about the impact of the Dene's traditional hunting practices on what was in fact a healthy herd. In addition the Hudson's Bay Company wished to close its nearby post which had served the band and was not as financially lucrative as it once was. In 1956 the Canadian and Manitoba governments decided to relocate the Duck Lake Dene away from caribou lands to Churchill, Manitoba where other Chipewyan Dene were located. For two decades, the Little Duck Lake band, now a part of the \\"Churchill Band of Caribou-eater Chipewyan\\", lived in tents and shanties on the outskirts of town. Around 1967, the Canadian government developed a housing project for them called \\"Dene Village\\". But the transition from a traditional nomadic caribou hunting economy to a non-migratory urban life was unsuccessful: as much as a third of the \\"Churchill Chipewyan\\" population died as a direct result of the relocation to Churchill. Tadoule Lake re-location In 1969, some Duck Lake Dene began discussing the possibility of becoming self-reliant and returning to the ancestral life-style. A few families left and moved to North Knife Lake in 1969. A few more families moved from Churchill, this time to South Knife Lake in 1971. In 1973, the Duck Lake Dene, North Knife Lake and South Knife Lake Dene moved north and set up a new community at Tadoule Lake (pronounced Ta- doo-lee, derived from the Dene ts'eouli, translated as \\"floating ashes\\"). The Tadoule Lake settlement is one of the most northern and isolated settlements in Manitoba, reachable only by plane, dog team, snowmobile or canoe. The nearest rail link is back in Churchill, 250 miles away. The settlement is located by the underdeveloped, wild, and rugged Seal River, about 80 km. south of the treeline, and centered within the winter range of the Qaminuriak Caribou Herd (barren-ground caribou). The Sayisi, with a population of around 360 people, have found it difficult, but not impossible, to return to ancestrally traditional hunting and trapping ways. They deal with spousal, drug and alcohol abuse. But by the 1990s, the Duck Lake Dene saw it could succeed in its new environment and changed its legal name from \\"Churchill, Band of Caribou-eater Chipewyan\\" to \\"Sayisi Dene First Nation (Tadoule Lake, Manitoba)\\". Ila Bussidor, Chief of the \\"Sayisi Dene First Nation (Tadoule Lake, Manitoba)\\", co-authored a 1997 book entitled, Night Spirits, The Story of the Relocation of the Sayisi Dene a chronicle of the band's ordeal from Little Duck Lake to Churchill to Tadoule Lake. Bussidor is currently working on a land claim settlement on behalf of her people, in addition to working with other First Nations on public works and community management projects. On August 2, 2010 Manitoba promised 13,000+ acres of Crown land, aside from any other treaty land entitlement, to compensate for the effects of the relocation. But, she (Ila Bussidor, Chief of the Sayisi Dene) says in this book: for my people, the impact of the relocation had the same effect as genocide.  Federal government apology  On August 16, 2016, Carolyn Bennett, the Minister of Indigenous and Northern Affairs, offered an apology to the Sayisi Dene people for their forced relocation from Little Duck Lake to Churchill, MB in 1956. $33.6 million has been offered in compensation. Promises of support for the relocated people never materialized and subsequently, 117 of the 250 had died by the time the government moved to relocate them in 1973. Language Sayisi Dene speak the Dene Suline language, of the Athabaskan linguistic group. Teaching their language to children and young adults who became English language speakers in Churchill is a priority. Elder Betsy Anderson said: :‚ÄúThere was a time when all the people and all the animals understood each other and spoke the same language.

Dayton is located southwest of Baltimore and north of Washington, D.C., between Clarksville and Glenelg. History A postal office operated in the community from 21 July 1864 to present with brief stops in service during the American Civil War. By 1878, the town expanded to three general stores and a wheelwright shop. One of the former is Maloney's General Store, built shortly after the Civil War, which served as a stagecoach stop and was later owned by Royal Harp III, Thomas Isaacs, Mr White, and the Grant family. The Dayton single-room school house was located along Green Bridge Road. After a fire in the single-room schoolhouse for colored children, a new brown tile two-room school was built at the crossroads of Ten Oaks, Green Bridge and Howard roads, and the colored children moved to the old white school. The two-room school is now on property owned by RLO Contractors. Modern Dayton Dayton is in the 21036 zip code area and belongs to the 410 area code. Local landmarks are the Crossroads Pub (Floyd's Crossroads Pub since 2014) famed for their Maryland blue crabs and once owned by the Harp family (Harp's Pub), who also owned Harp's grocery store, the Post Office, Hobbs Service Station, and a large wooden rabbit (severely damaged and removed in the mid-2010s), which was decorated for major holidays. The post office is still operating today. Dayton is also the home to the annual Dayton Daze Parade that began in honor of Lenny Hobbs. The Hobbs Family gas station was prominent in the crossroads community. Although rural, Dayton is a high-income area, with a median household income of $196,494 in 2013, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The 21036 zip code is the wealthiest in the Baltimore metropolitan area as of 2013, with an average family net worth of $1.85 million, and is listed as a \\"super\\" zip code.http://www.bizjournals.com/baltimore/subscriber- only/2013/08/16/wealthiest-zip-codes-in-the-baltimore.html The median home value was $750,000 in 2013, with an average home size of 4,923 square feet.http://www.movoto.com/dayton-md/21036/demographics/ In 2014, a zoning case to move a large industrial mulching operation operated by a Sandy Spring Bank executive and RLO president from Trinity Church in Elkridge to agricultural preservation land in Dayton prompted a large citizen reaction.

The term was coined by psychiatrist and Harvard University professor Chester M. Pierce in 1970 to describe insults and dismissals which he regularly witnessed non-black Americans inflicting on African Americans. By the early 21st century, use of the term was applied to the casual degradation of any socially marginalized group, including LGBT people, people living in poverty, and people who are disabled. Psychologist Derald Wing Sue defines microaggressions as \\"brief, everyday exchanges that send denigrating messages to certain individuals because of their group membership\\". The persons making the comments may be otherwise well-intentioned and unaware of the potential impact of their words. A number of scholars and social commentators have criticised the microaggression concept for its lack of scientific basis, over-reliance on subjective evidence, and promotion of psychological fragility. Critics argue that avoiding behaviours that one interprets as microaggressions restricts one's own freedom and causes emotional self-harm, and that employing authority figures to address microaggressions can lead to an atrophy of those skills needed to mediate one's own disputes. Some argue that, because the term \\"microaggression\\" uses language connoting violence to describe verbal conduct, it can be (and is) abused to exaggerate harm, resulting in retribution and the elevation of victimhood.  Description  Microaggressions are common, everyday slights and comments that relate to various intersections of one‚Äôs identity such as gender, sex, race, ethnicity, and age, among other aspects. They are thought to spring from unconsciously held prejudices and beliefs which may be demonstrated consciously or unconsciously through daily verbal interactions.Sue, D. W., & Capodilupo, C. M. (2008). Racial, gender, and sexual orientation microaggressions: Implications for counseling and psychotherapy. In D.W. Sue & D. Sue (Eds.), Counseling the culturally diverse: Theory and practice. Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley & Sons. Although these communications typically appear harmless to observers, they are considered a form of covert racism or everyday discrimination. Microaggressions differ from what Pierce referred to as ‚Äúmacroaggressions‚Äù, which are more extreme forms of racism (such as lynchings or beatings) due to their ambiguity, size and commonality. Microaggressions are experienced by most stigmatized individuals and occur on a regular basis. These can be particularly stressful for people on the receiving end as they are easily denied by those committing them. They are also harder to detect by members of the dominant culture, as they are often unaware they are causing harm. Sue describes microaggressions as including statements that repeat or affirm stereotypes about the minority group or subtly demean its members. Such comments also position the dominant culture as normal and the minority one as aberrant or pathological, express disapproval of or discomfort with the minority group, assume that all minority group members are the same, minimize the existence of discrimination against the minority group, seek to deny the perpetrator's own bias, or minimize real conflict between the minority group and the dominant culture. = Categories = In conducting two focus groups with Asian-Americans, for instance, Sue proposed eight distinct themes of racial microaggression: *Alien in own land: When people assume people of color (POC) are foreigners or from a different country. ** E.g.: \\"So where are you really from?\\" or \\"Why don't you have an accent?\\" * Ascription of intelligence: When POC are stereotyped as being intelligent or assumed to be at a certain level of intelligence based on their race. ** E.g.: \\"You people always do well in school.\\" or \\"If I see a lot of Asian students in my class, I know it's going to be a hard class.\\" * Denial of racial reality: This is when a person emphasizes that a POC does not suffer any discrimination, thus implying they do not face inequality. It correlates to the idea of model minority. * Exoticization of non-white women: It stereotypes these Americans as being in the \\"exotic\\" category. They are stereotyped by their physical appearance and their gender, based on media and literature. One example is Asian-American women portrayed as the submissive or obedient type; alternatively, they may be portrayed or described as Dragon Lady, Tiger Mom, or Lotus Blossom, using symbols from their cultures. On the other hand, Asian-American men are portrayed as being emasculated or weak. * Refusal to acknowledge intra-ethnic differences: The homogeneity of broad ethnic groups is emphasized and assumed; the speaker ignores intra-ethnic differences. The focus groups identified the statement that \\"all Asian- Americans look alike\\" as a main assumption for this theme. Similarly, thinking that all members of an ethnic minority group speak the same language or have the same values or culture falls under this theme. * Pathologizing cultural values/communication styles: When Asian Americans' cultures and values are viewed as less desirable. For example, many people from the focus groups felt disadvantaged by the expectation of verbal participation in school and college classes, when Asian cultural norms value silence. Because of this discrepancy, many Asian-Americans felt that they were being forced to conform to Western cultural norms in order to succeed academically. * Second-class citizenship: This theme emphasizes the idea that people of color are being treated as lesser beings, and are not treated with equal rights or presented as a first priority. ** E.g.: A Korean man walks into a bar and asks for a drink, but the bartender ignores the man when he serves a white man first. * Invisibility: This theme focuses on the idea that Asian Americans are considered invisible or outside discussions of race and racism. According to some focus group members, recent dialogues on race in the United States have often focused only on issues between whites and blacks, excluding Asian-Americans. In a 2017 peer-reviewed review of the literature, Scott Lilienfeld critiqued microaggression research for hardly having advanced beyond taxonomies such as the above, which was proposed by Sue nearly ten years earlier. While acknowledging the reality of \\"subtle slights and insults directed toward minorities\\", Lilienfeld concluded that the concept and programs for its scientific assessment are \\"far too underdeveloped on the conceptual and methodological fronts to warrant real-world application\\". He recommended abandonment of the term microaggression since \\"the use of the root word 'aggression' in 'microaggression' is conceptually confusing and misleading\\". In addition, he called for a moratorium on microaggression training programs until further research can develop the field. In 2017 Althea Nagai, who works as a research fellow at the conservative Center for Equal Opportunity, published an article criticizing microaggression research as pseudoscience. Nagai said that the prominent critical race researchers behind microaggression theory \\"reject the methodology and standards of modern science.\\" She lists various technical shortcomings of microaggression research, including \\"biased interview questions, reliance on narrative and small numbers of respondents, problems of reliability, issues of replicability, and ignoring alternative explanations.\\" = Race or ethnicity = Social scientists Sue, Bucceri, Lin, Nadal, and Torino (2007) described microaggressions as \\"the new face of racism\\", saying that the nature of racism has shifted over time from overt expressions of racial hatred and hate crimes, toward expressions of aversive racism, such as microaggressions, that are more subtle, ambiguous, and often unintentional. Sue says this has led some Americans to believe wrongly that non-white Americans no longer suffer from racism. One example of such subtle expressions of racism is Asian students being either pathologized or penalized as too passive or quiet. Another is a teacher correcting a student's use of \\"indigenous\\" in a paper by changing it from upper- to lowercase. According to Sue et al., microaggressions seem to appear in three forms: * Microassault: an explicit racial derogation; verbal/nonverbal; e.g. name-calling, avoidant behavior, purposeful discriminatory actions. * Microinsult: communications that convey rudeness and insensitivity and demean a person's racial heritage or identity; subtle snubs; unknown to the perpetrator; hidden insulting message to the recipient. * Microinvalidation: communications that exclude, negate, or nullify the psychological thoughts, feelings, or experiential reality of a person belonging to a particular group. Some psychologists have criticized microaggression theory for assuming that all verbal, behavioral, or environmental indignities are necessarily due to bias. Thomas Schacht says that it is uncertain whether a behavior is due to racial bias or is a larger phenomenon that occurs regardless of identity conflict. However, Kanter and colleagues found that microaggressions were robustly correlated to five separate measures of bias. In reviewing the microaggression literature, Scott Lilienfeld suggested that microassaults should probably be struck from the taxonomy because the examples provided in the literature tend not to be \\"micro\\", but are outright assaults, intimidation, harassment and bigotry; in some cases, examples have included criminal acts. Others have pointed out that what could be perceived as subtle snubs could be due to people having conditions such as autism or social anxiety disorders, and assuming ill will could be harmful to these people. = Gender = Explicit sexism in society is on the decline, but still exists in a variety of subtle and non-subtle expressions. Women encounter microaggressions in which they are made to feel inferior, sexually objectified, and bound to restrictive gender roles, both in the workplace and in academia, as well as in athletics. Microaggressions based on gender are applied to female athletes when: their abilities are compared only to men, they are judged on \\"attractiveness\\", and individuals are restricted to or requested to wear \\"feminine\\" or sexually attractive attire during competition. Other examples of sexist microaggressions are \\"[addressing someone by using] a sexist name, a man refusing to wash dishes because it is 'women's work,' displaying nude pin-ups of women at places of employment, someone making unwanted sexual advances toward another person\\". Makin and Morczek also use the term gendered microaggression to refer to male interest in violent rape pornography. Transgender people experience microaggressions when they are labelled in a way that does not match their gender identity. = Sexuality and sexual orientation = In focus groups, individuals identifying as bisexual report such microaggressions as others denying or dismissing their self-narratives or identity claims, being unable to understand or accept bisexuality as a possibility, pressuring them to change their bisexual identity, expecting them to be sexually promiscuous, and questioning their ability to maintain monogamous relationships. Some LGBT individuals report receiving expressions of microaggression from people even within the LGBT community. They say that being excluded, or not being made welcome or understood within the gay and lesbian community is a microaggression. Roffee and Waling suggest that the issue arises, as occurs among many groups of people, because a person often makes assumptions based on individual experience, and when they communicate such assumptions, the recipient may feel that it lacks taking the second individual into account and is a form of microaggression. = Intersectionality = People who are members of overlapping marginal groups (e.g., a gay Asian American man or a trans woman) experience microaggressions based in correspondingly varied forms of marginalization. For example, in one study Asian American women reported feeling they were classified as sexually exotic by majority-culture men or were viewed by them as potential trophy wives simply because of their group membership. African American women report microaggressions related to characteristics of their hair, which may include invasion of personal space as an individual tries to touch it, or comments that a style that is different from that of a European American woman looks \\"unprofessional\\". = People with mental illnesses = People with mental illness report receiving more overt forms of microaggression than subtle ones, coming from family and friends as well as from authority figures. In a study involving college students and adults who were being treated in community care, five themes were identified: invalidation, assumption of inferiority, fear of mental illness, shaming of mental illness, and being treated as a second-class citizen. = Media = Members of marginalized groups have also described microaggressions committed by performers or artists associated with various forms of media, such as television, film, photography, music, and books. Some researchers believe that such cultural content reflects but also molds society, allowing for unintentional bias to be absorbed by individuals based on their media consumption, as if it were expressed by someone with whom they had an encounter. A study of racism in TV commercials describes microaggressions as gaining a cumulative weight, leading to inevitable clashes between races due to subtleties in the content. As an example of a racial microaggression, or microassault, this research found that black people were more likely than white counterparts to be shown eating or participating in physical activity, and more likely to be shown working for, or serving others. The research concludes by suggesting that microaggressive representations can be omitted from a body of work, without sacrificing creativity or profit. P√©rez Huber and Solorzano start their analysis of microaggressions with an anecdote about Mexican \\"bandits\\" as portrayed in a children's book read at bedtime. The article gives examples of negative stereotypes of Mexicans and Latinos in books, print, and photos, associating them with the state of racial discourse within majority culture and its dominance over minority groups in the US. The personification of these attitudes through media can also be applied to microaggressive behaviors towards other marginalized groups. A 2015 review of the portrayal of LGBT characters in film says that gay or lesbian characters are presented in \\"offensive\\" ways. In contrast, LGBT characters portrayed as complex characters who are more than a cipher for their sexual orientation or identity are a step in the right direction. Ideally, \\"queer film audiences finally have a narrative pleasure that has been afforded to straight viewers since the dawn of film noir: a central character who is highly problematical, but fascinating.\\" = Ageism and intolerance = Microaggression can target and marginalize any definable group, including those who share an age grouping or belief system. Microaggression is a manifestation of bullying that employs micro-linguistic power plays in order to marginalize any target with a subtle manifestation of intolerance by signifying the concept of \\"other\\".  Perpetrators  Because microaggressions are subtle and perpetrators may be well-meaning, the recipients often experience attributional ambiguity, which may lead them to dismiss the event and blame themselves as overly sensitive to the encounter. If challenged by the minority person or an observer, perpetrators will often defend their microaggression as a misunderstanding, a joke, or something small that should not be blown out of proportion. A 2020 study involving American college students found a correlation between likelihood to commit microaggressions, and racial bias.  Effects  A 2013 scholarly review of the literature on microaggressions concluded that \\"the negative impact of racial microaggressions on psychological and physical health is beginning to be documented; however, these studies have been largely correlational and based on recall and self-report, making it difficult to determine whether racial microaggressions actually cause negative health outcomes and, if so, through what mechanisms\\". A 2017 review of microaggression research pointed out that as scholars try to understand the possible harm caused by microaggressions, they have not conducted much cognitive or behavioural research, nor much experimental testing, and they have overly relied on small collections of anecdotal testimonies from samples who are not representative of any particular population. Recipients of microaggressions may feel anger, frustration, or exhaustion. African Americans have reported feeling under pressure to \\"represent\\" their group or to suppress their own cultural expression and \\"act white\\". Over time, the cumulative effect of microaggressions is thought by some to lead to diminished self- confidence and a poor self-image for individuals, and potentially also to such mental-health problems as depression, anxiety, and trauma. Many researchers have argued that microaggressions are more damaging than overt expressions of bigotry precisely because they are small and therefore often ignored or downplayed, leading the victim to feel self-doubt for noticing or reacting to the encounter, rather than justifiable anger, and isolation rather than support from others about such incidents. Studies have found that in the U.S. when people of color perceived microaggressions from mental health professionals, client satisfaction with therapy is lower. Some studies suggest that microaggressions represent enough of a burden that some people of color may fear, distrust, and/or avoid relationships with white people in order to evade such interaction. On the other hand, some people report that dealing with microaggressions has made them more resilient. Scholars have suggested that, although microaggressions \\"might seem minor\\", they are \\"so numerous that trying to function in such a setting is 'like lifting a ton of feathers. In a paper written in 2019, Lui and Quezada surveyed research from several countries that studied the possible connection between microaggression and \\"self-esteem, perceived stress, [emotions], depression and anxiety symptoms.\\" They stated that there is a \\"statistically significant summary correlation\\" between microaggressions and negative emotional effects for certain groups of people. Criticism = Public discourse and harm to speakers = Kenneth R. Thomas wrote in American Psychologist that recommendations inspired by microaggression theory, if \\"implemented, could have a chilling effect on free speech and on the willingness of White people, including some psychologists, to interact with people of color.\\" Sociologists Bradley Campbell and Jason Manning have written in the academic journal Comparative Sociology that the microaggression concept \\"fits into a larger class of conflict tactics in which the aggrieved seek to attract and mobilize the support of third parties\\" that sometimes involves \\"building a case for action by documenting, exaggerating, or even falsifying offenses\\". The concept of microaggressions has been described as a symptom of the breakdown in civil discourse, and that microaggressions are \\"yesterday's well-meaning faux pas\\". One suggested type of microaggression by an Oxford University newsletter was avoiding eye contact or not speaking directly to people. This spurred a controversy when it was pointed out that such assumptions are insensitive to autistic people who may have trouble making eye contact. = Culture of victimhood = In their article \\"Microaggression and Moral Cultures\\", sociologists Bradley Campbell and Jason Manning say that the discourse of microaggression leads to a culture of victimhood. Social psychologist Jonathan Haidt states that this culture of victimhood lessens an individual's \\"ability to handle small interpersonal matters on one's own\\" and \\"creates a society of constant and intense moral conflict as people compete for status as victims or as defenders of victims\\". Similarly, the linguist and social commentator John McWhorter says that \\"it infantilizes black people to be taught that microaggressions, and even ones a tad more macro, hold us back, permanently damage our psychology, or render us exempt from genuine competition.\\" McWhorter does not disagree that microaggressions exist. However, he worries that too much societal focus on microaggressions will cause other problems and has stated that the term should be confined to \\"when people belittle us on the basis of stereotypes.\\" = Emotional distress = In The Atlantic, Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt expressed concern that the focus on microaggressions can cause more emotional trauma than the experience of the microaggressions at the time of occurrence. They believe that self-policing by an individual of thoughts or actions in order to avoid committing microaggressions may cause emotional harm as a person seeks to avoid becoming a microaggressor, as such extreme self-policing may share some characteristics of pathological thinking. Referring especially to prevention programs at schools or universities, they say that the element of protectiveness, of which identifying microaggression allegations are a part, prepares students \\"poorly for professional life, which often demands intellectual engagement with people and ideas one might find uncongenial or wrong\\". They also said that it has become \\"unacceptable to question the reasonableness (let alone the sincerity) of someone's emotional state\\", resulting in adjudication of alleged microaggressions having characteristics of witch trials. Writing for The Federalist, Paul Rowan Brian argued that microaggression theory pools trivial and ignorable instances of racism with real, genuine prejudice and exclusion. Amitai Etzioni, writing in The Atlantic, suggested that attention to microaggressions distracts individuals and groups from dealing with much more serious acts. = Political correctness = Viv Regan, writing for Spiked Online, wondered whether the comfort provided by having a convenient label for alleged rudeness outweighs the damage caused by overreaction. According to Derald Wing Sue, whose works popularized the term, many critiques are based on the term being misunderstood or misused. He said that his purpose in identifying such comments or actions was to educate people and not to silence or shame them. He further notes that, for instance, identifying that someone has used racial microaggressions is not intended to imply that they are racist. = Mind reading = According to Lilienfeld, a possible harmful effect of microaggression programs is to increase an individual's tendency to over-interpret the words of others in a negative way. He says:  See also   References  Category:Microaggression theory Category:Words and phrases introduced in 1970 Category:Discrimination Category:Racism Category:Words coined in the 1970s Category:Labeling theory Category:Political terminology Category:Linguistic controversies ","title":"Microaggression"},{"id":"13700749","title":"List of South African submissions for the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film"},{"id":"13700778","text":"Pathway was a North London 8-track studio at 2a Grosvenor Avenue, Newington Green, founded by producers Peter Ker and Mike Finesilver and later run by Finesilver until the mid-1990s.

He was also a published theatre historian and researcher, and, in particular, was an authority on the works of W. S. Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan who, as Gilbert and Sullivan, wrote 14 comic operas in the late Victorian era. Biography Rees was born at Barry in Glamorgan, educated at the local county school, the University of Cardiff (1948‚Äì1952), and the University of London (1954‚Äì1957). He spent 1965 to 1967 as a Research Fellow at the Institute of Diseases of the Chest at Brompton in London, and between 1967 and 1981 he lectured in microbiology at The Institute of Laryngology and Otology at University College London. Rees later resided in Powys and in Swansea, Wales.

Bibliography, The Cambridge Illustrated History of British Theatre, p. 399, Cambridge University Press, 2000 =Gilbert and Sullivan= After considerable research about Gilbert and Sullivan's first collaboration, Thespis, Rees developed, and in 1964 published, a version of the libretto for that work that attempts to correct the many errors noted in the surviving libretto, as part of his book Thespis ‚Äì A Gilbert & Sullivan Enigma.Rees (1964), pp. 101‚Äì45 Rees also prepared a performance version, based on the libretto, which included a few interpolated lyrics from Gilbert's non-Sullivan operas in an attempt to replace the missing songs.

The score was believed lost until Rees located it in the 1950s in the vault at Coutts Bank, where several Sullivan manuscripts were stored. The discovery was particularly important, because Herbert Sullivan wrote in 1927 that his uncle re-used the music of The Zoo in the later operas, but this turned out to be false. After Herbert's widow died, Rees purchased the manuscript at the 1966 auction. He then arranged for a piano/vocal reduction of The Zoo to be published. Using Rees's materials, the operetta received its first modern production in 1971, was subsequently broadcast by the BBC and was recorded by the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company in 1978.Shepherd, Marc. \\"The 1978 D'Oyly Carte Zoo\\", Gilbert and Sullivan Discography, 21 September 2008, accessed 19 November 2014 Rees also discovered the libretto to W.

These included cut numbers from Iolanthe and The Yeomen of the Guard and songs from several of Sullivan's operas with librettists other than Gilbert that were then nearly unknown. This volume did much to encourage the rehabilitation of these works.

He is best known for his work with found objects, and particularly his ongoing \\"autoconstrucci√≥n\\" project.  Biography  Cruzvillegas was grew up in Ajusco, a district in the south of Mexico City. He studied Philosophy and Art at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). He later became a professor and went on to teach Art History and Theory at UNAM. As a sculptor and writer, Cruzvillegas began as a central participant in a new wave of conceptual art in Mexico City during the 1980s and 90s, studying under Gabriel Orozco from 1987 to 1991 in the \\"Taller de los Viernes\\" sessions. Orozco has been proposed as one of the \\"dominant influence(s)\\" on his work. Along with Orozco, Damian Ortega, Dr Lakra, and Minerva Cuevas, Cruzvillegas was considered part of a new movement in Latin American art (which has been compared to the YBA boom in Britain in the 1980s. or the Modernist movement of the 1920sSee 'Art and Architecture in Mexico', James Oles, (Thames and Hudson, 2013) p.391). Together with Gabriel Kuri, Lakra and Orozco, he participated in \\"Friday Workshops\\" (Taller de los Viernes) in the 1980s, a weekly meeting in which the artists met and collaborated. As Cruzvillegas explained in the exhibition catalogue for 'Escultura Social: A New Generation of Art from Mexico City (2007): \\"We learned together to discuss, criticise, and transform our work individually, with no programmes, marks, exams, diplomas or reprisals. We did not intend to become known, prepare for a show, go against the grain, make our presence felt as a group, or even make work ‚Ä¶ this was my education\\". This then developed into the artist-run space \\"Temistocles 44\\" in the 1990s, founded by Eduardo Abaroa and Cruzvillegas.  Works and exhibitions  His works have been shown throughout America, Europe and Mexico. Elements of the Autoconstrucci√≥n project were shown (amongst others) at Tate Modern in March 2012, in the Museum of Modern Art in Oxford in 2011, at the Walker Art Center in 2013, and at the Haus der Kunst, Munich in 2014. His work is held in a number of collections, including Tate Modern, London and MoMA, New York. Cruzvillegas has shown his work in single and group exhibitions in a number of galleries across Europe, South America and the United States. In 1994, his work was shown in the Fifth Havana Biennial; in 2002 in the XXV S√£o Paulo Biennial; in 2003 in the Fiftieth Venice Biennale; in 2005 in the 1st Torino Triennale; in 2008 in the Bienal de Cali, in Colombia; in the Tenth Havana Biennial, and the Seventh Bienal do Mercosul in Portoalegre. His work has been shown at the New Museum, New York City, at Tate Modern in London and at Aishti Foundation as part of the Trick Brain Exhibition in Lebanon. Cruzvillegas participated in ROUNDTABLE: The 9th Gwangju Biennale, which took place September to November 2012 in Gwangju, Korea. In August 2012, it was announced that Cruzvillegas had won the Fifth Annual Yanghyun Prize In 2014, he was the subject of a joint exhibition at both the Colecci√≥n J√∫mex and the Amparo Museum. =autoconstrucci√≥n= From 2007 onwards, Cruzvillegas has produced a series of works exploring what he calls autoconstrucci√≥n, or self-construction. As described by Chris Sharp in Art Review, > \\"autoconstrucci√≥n has been able to manifest in [...] many guises, places and > modes: from small autonomous sculptures to large sculptural-cum- > architectural installations; from mobile musical collaborations to an > hourlong film, even a play. Autoconstrucci√≥n is multiplicity incarnate. > Indeed, the term could be said to designate more of a spirit and an ethic > than, say, a theory-driven aesthetic.\\" He states in Art:21, \\"Sometimes, I just play with the materials, finding combinations, taking whatever is at hand [...] things, they speak, [and] I try to find a balance among them\\". Autoconstrucci√≥n, writes art historian Robin Greeley, is \\"a sculptural practice of dynamic contingency derived from the ad hoc building procedures common in squatter settlements on the outskirts of megacities. [...] Cruzvillegas works with found materials in a process of inventive appropriation.\\"Robin Greeley, \\"The Logic of Disorder: The Sculptural Materialism of Abraham Cruzvillegas,\\" October 151 (Winter 2015):79. From 2012, this project was accompanied by works around the theme of \\"autodestrucci√≥n\\", Cruzvillegas explained that through the autodestrucci√≥n works he \\"wanted to show how \\"Internationalism\\" or \\"Style\\" is something that is to be appropriated, customized, modified, adapted and even destroyed, according to specific, local, individual, subjective needs.\\" From May to June 2018, kurimanzutto new york hosted an Autocontusi√≥n installation. It included new pieces, such as a mural inspired by Manhattan. =Empty Lot= In 2015, Cruzvillegas accepted the Tate Modern Turbine Hall commission; his work, 'Empty Lot' was on display between 13 October 2015 and 3 April 2016. The work consists of 240 wooden triangular plots bordered with wooden frames, filled with 23 tonnes of soil collected from different parks and gardens across London (including Hackney Marshes, Peckham Rye, the Horniman Museum and Buckingham Palace). The entire work is raised on two large stepped, triangular scaffolded platforms, overlooked by growing light, and interspersed with smaller sculptural works. In an interview with The Independent he stated, > \\"the history of mankind is based on movement, transformation, hope [but] > owning a piece of land that is yours and for your family is the main hope of > everybody ‚Äì having a shelter, having a piece of land. This idea of hope is > one that I‚Äôm dealing with in this work for the Turbine Hall.\\" In her review for the Financial Times Rachel Spence compared the work's \\"tidy blank triangles\\" to El Lissitzky and the work generally to Walter De Maria's New York Earth Room stating, > \\"The result is a work of art which works on more levels than the Shard: as > process, as performance, as politics and as spectacle. Cruzvillegas says he > hopes it will be somewhere \\"that something can grow out of nothing\\". Like a > green-fingered Beckett, his less-is-more philosophy makes him a seer for our > times.\\" Writing for the Daily Telegraph, Mark Hudson noted the influence of \\"Buckminster Fuller's geodesic domes and the grid-structured gardens of the Aztecs\\" and stated, \\"As a piece of gigantic sculpture, Empty Lot is one of the more dynamic and exciting of the Turbine Hall commissions. It feels suspended like a geometric island, perfectly poised in the immense space.\\" Jonathan Jones, writing in The Guardian, called it \\"lazy and complacent, as if unbothered by the challenge, uninterested in winning an audience\\", an artwork with \\"no aesthetic power and precious little to think about\\", selecting it as his \\"worst\\" installation in the Turbine Hall series.Jonathan Jones: Tate Modern's Turbine Hall of fame: the best and worst artworks so far.  Reception and influences  For the 2002 S√£o Paulo Biennial, Cruzvillegas wrote: \\"However art makes itself evident, it shall remain, above all, raw source material in all its natural, unstable, physical, chaotic and crystalline states: solid, liquid, colloidal and gaseous. It is the joy of energy.\\" Frieze Magazine, Retrieved 1 April 2011 Reviewing Cruzvillegas' 2003 show for The New York Times, Holland Cotter wrote, \\"In all Mr. Cruzvillegas's work, little is stated but much is said\\". In a monograph on Cruzvillegas' work in Frieze magazine in 2006, Tom Morton discusses an untitled work from 1993 which recalls Marcel Duchamp's 1913 Bicycle Wheel, though the spokes have been replaced \\"by a circular panel on which his father, now an academic, once painted a bouquet of red carnations\\". Morton states, \\"by bringing the work of these two men together Cruzvillegas not only expands the notion of 'influence' so that it might include the micro-stuff of specific domestic context alongside the macro-stuff of art history, but also casts into doubt the purity of the ready-made ‚Äì which is to say, its inconsequentiality, its mute object- hood.\\", Frieze Magazine, 'Found and Lost, October 2006 retrieved 22.1.15 at 15.17 Chris Sharp, writing in Art Review in January 2013, wrote: \\"his works are often united by an identifiable formal sensibility, whose predominantly found-object or poor-material aesthetic influence is as indebted to Robert Rauschenberg, David Hammons and Jimmie Durham as it is to Gabriel Orozco. The difference between them and Cruzvillegas, however, is the highly personal, specific and inherently protean programme to which his cultural and material universe adheres.\\" Discussing his works, Niamh Coglan, writing for Aesthetica Magazine in February 2013, notes that \\"Works such as Aeropuerto Alterno (2002), A.C. Mobile (2008) or Sin T√≠tulo / Untitled (1999), which directly references Duchamp's Bicycle Wheel (1913), exhibit a strong Duchampian element, not just for their aesthetic form but for appropriative elements\\", and goes on to state \\"Cruzvillegas does with material what Marcel Broodthaers and Ren√© Magritte did with words and linguistics\\". Similarly, Gareth Harris, writing in The Art Newspaper in January 2014, notes: \\"With his vast range of dynamic assemblage sculptures meticulously built from found objects, the Mexican artist Abraham Cruzvillegas has been dubbed the 21st-century equivalent of Marcel Duchamp.\\"'Mexico's 21st Century Duchamp', The Art Newspaper, Number 253, January 2014, p.30 In 2014, Cruzvillegas was profiled (with Tania Bruguera and Wolfgang Laib) in the third episode (\\"Legacy\\") of the seventh season of the PBS contemporary art programme Art:21 - Art in the 21st Century. Cruzvillegas has said of Gustav Metzger \\"[his] position as an activist and artist has been a big inspiration for me\\". In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, Cruzvillegas' work was compared \\"to the bronzes of Catalan sculptor Julio Gonzalez, who combined forms both organic and abstract, to the entropic cage forms of British artist Anthony Caro, and to the arrangements of wires, covered in hair, by U.S. artist David Hammons\\", to which Cruzvillegas replied, \\"these guys are super important to me as artists [...] I use that language.\\"  Residencies  * 2005 Residency at Atelier Calder, Sach√©, France * 2006 Altadis Contemporary Art Prize, France-Spain * 2006-2007 Residency at Brownstone Foundation, Paris * 2007 Residency at Civitella Ranieri Foundation, Umbria, Italy * 2008 Artist Research Fellowship, Smithsonian Institution, Washington DC * 2008 Residency at Cove Park/CCA, Glasgow, Scotland * 2009 Residency at the Wattis Institute/CCA, San Francisco * 2010-2011 DAAD Artists in Berlin Residency Program  Personal life  Cruzvillegas is married to Alejandra Carrillo, a lawyer specialising in migratory issues who has worked for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees in Mexico.

The asteroid was discovered on 9 March 1984, by American astronomer Brian Skiff at Lowell's Anderson Mesa Station in Flagstaff, Arizona, and named after George Harrison.  Orbit and classification  Harrison is a member of the Eunomia family, a large group of S-type asteroids and the most prominent family in the intermediate main-belt. It orbits the Sun in the central main- belt at a distance of 2.3‚Äì3.0 AU once every 4 years and 4 months (1,590 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.12 and an inclination of 13¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. A first precovery was taken at Palomar Observatory in 1977, extending the body's observation arc by 7 years prior to its discovery.  Physical characteristics  = Rotation period = A rotational lightcurve of Harrison was obtained from photometric observations by Czech astronomer Petr Pravec at Ond≈ôejov Observatory in May 2015. It gave a well-defined rotation period of hours with a brightness variation of 0.42 in magnitude (). During the following month, photometric observations at three Italian observatories gave a second lightcurve with a period of hours and an amplitude of 0.37 in magnitude (). = Diameter and albedo = According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Harrison measures 10.1 and 10.7 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.19 and 0.23, respectively, while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes an albedo of 0.21 ‚Äì derived from 15 Eunomia, the family's largest member and namesake ‚Äì and calculates a diameter of 8.1 kilometers with an absolute magnitude of 12.76.  Naming  This minor planet was named in honor of guitarist, singer and songwriter, George Harrison (1943‚Äì2001), who was the lead guitarist of the English rock band The Beatles, after which the main-belt asteroid 8749 Beatles is named. The minor planets 4147 Lennon, 4148 McCartney and 4150 Starr honor the other three members of the band. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 10 April 1990 ().

The telephone was manufactured in Italy by Societ√† Italiana Telecomunicazioni Siemens (aka Telcer., the Italian arm of Siemens tel.) The modern shape and design features were revolutionary for the 1960s. The fact that the phone could be manufactured in such a small package, during the 60s, set it apart from all other designs at the time. It incorporated a flip-design that opened automatically as the phone was picked up. This clam-shell design was to go on and eventually influenced the design of modern mobile telephones during the 90s and beyond. The name \\"Grillo\\" is Italian for cricket and was named so because the 'ringer', which was incorporated inside the wall plug, sounded like a cricket. The dial of the Grillo phone employs an innovative solution to the design challenge of condensing the dial mechanism into a limited space, while still incorporating a finger-stop. The Grillo phone's dial couldn't employ a conventional finger-stop like the type found on conventional dial phones, but instead has a button within each of the dial's number holes, which, when depressed, pushes a pin through the back of the dial which stops the dial once it's turned to the dial's end position.

Early life Jason Aaron was born in Jasper, Alabama. His cousin, Gustav Hasford, who wrote the semi-autobiographical novel The Short-Timers (1979), on which the feature film Full Metal Jacket (1987) was based, was a large influence on Aaron. Aaron decided he wanted to write comics as a child, and though his father was skeptical when Aaron informed him of this aspiration, his mother took Aaron to drug stores, where he would purchase from spinner racks comic books, some of which he still owns today. Aaron graduated from Shelby County High School. He then attended the University of Alabama at Birmingham, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in English. Career Aaron's career in comics began in 2001 when he won a Marvel Comics talent search contest with an eight-page Wolverine back-up story script. The story, which was published in Wolverine #175 (June 2002), gave him the opportunity to pitch subsequent ideas to editors. In 2006, Aaron made a blind submission to Vertigo, an imprint of DC Comics, who published his first major work, the Vietnam War story The Other Side, which was nominated for an Eisner Award for Best Miniseries, and which Aaron regards as the \\"second time\\" he broke into the industry. Following this, Vertigo asked him to pitch other ideas, which led to the series Scalped, a creator-owned series set on the fictional Prairie Rose Indian Reservation drawn by R. M. Gu√©ra. In 2007, Aaron wrote Ripclaw: Pilot Season for Top Cow Productions. Later that year, Marvel editor Axel Alonso, who was impressed by The Other Side and Scalped, hired Aaron to write issues of Wolverine, Black Panther and eventually, an extended run on Ghost Rider that began in April 2008. His continued work on Black Panther also included a tie-in to the company-wide \\"Secret Invasion\\" crossover with David Lapham in 2009. In January 2008, he signed an exclusive contract with Marvel, though it would not affect his work on Scalped. In July of that year, he wrote the Penguin issue of Joker's Asylum. After a four-issue stint on Wolverine in 2007, Aaron returned to the character with the ongoing series Wolverine: Weapon X, launched to coincide with the feature film X-Men Origins: Wolverine. Aaron commented, \\"With Wolverine: Weapon X we'll be trying to mix things up like that from arc to arc, so the first arc is a typical sort of black ops story but the second arc will jump right into the middle of a completely different genre,\\" In 2010, the series was relaunched once again as simply Wolverine. He followed this with the relaunch of The Incredible Hulk in 2011 and Thor: God of Thunder in 2012. Aaron and artist Mike Deodato collaborated on the Original Sin limited series in 2014. During his run on Thor, he brought in the new female Thor and wrote the relaunch of the book. As of 2017, Aaron was writing a Star Wars comic book for Marvel, set between A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back, as well as continuing his work on Thor, Doctor Strange, and the creator-owned series Southern Bastards with Jason Latour and The Goddamned with R. M. Gu√©ra for Image. In 2018, he relaunched Thor with Mike del Mundo and The Avengers with Ed McGuinness. Aaron and Mahmud A. Asrar are scheduled to be the creative team on the Conan the Barbarian series when Marvel regains the licensing rights to the character in 2019. At the 2019 San Diego Comic Con, it was announced that Aaron's Thor storyline, which depicted Jane Foster acquiring the mantle of the Thunder God, would be the basis for the film Thor: Love and Thunder, which would be released on November 5, 2021. Personal life Aaron moved to Kansas City, Kansas in 2000, the day after the first X-Men feature film was released. Commenting on the religious themes that run through his work, Aaron says he was raised Southern Baptist, but has since renounced religion: \\"I‚Äôve been an atheist for many years, but I‚Äôve remained fascinated by religion. If anything, I‚Äôve become more fascinated by religion and faith after I lost mine.\\" Awards and nominations *Nominated: 2007 Eisner Award for Best Miniseries for The Other Side. *Nominated: 2015 Eisner Award for Best Writer for Southern Bastards, Original Sin, Thor and Men of Wrath. *Nominated: 2015 Eisner Award for Best Continuing Series Southern Bastards. *Recipient: 2015 Harvey Award for Best New Series for Southern Bastards. *Nominated: 2015 Harvey Award for Best Writer for Southern Bastards. *Recipient: 2016 Eisner Award for Best Continuing Series for Southern Bastards. *Recipient: 2016 Eisner Award for Best Writer for Southern Bastards, Star Wars, Doctor Strange, Thor and Men of Wrath. *Recipient: 2016 Inkpot Award Bibliography =DC Comics/Vertigo= *The Other Side #1‚Äì5 (with Cameron Stewart, 2006) collected as The Other Side (tpb, 144 pages, 2007, ) *Scalped: **Indian Country #1‚Äì5 (tpb, 128 pages, 2007, ) ** Casino Boogie #6‚Äì11 (tpb, 144 pages, 2008, ) ** Dead Mothers #12‚Äì18 (tpb, 168 pages, 2008, ) ** The Gravel in Your Gut #19‚Äì24 (tpb, 144 pages, 2009, ) ** High Lonesome #25‚Äì29 (tpb, 128 pages, 2009, ) ** The Gnawing #30‚Äì34 (tpb, 128 pages, 2010, ) ** Rez Blues #35‚Äì42(tpb, 192 pages, 2011, ) ** You Gotta Sin to Get Saved #43‚Äì49 (tpb, 120 pages, 2011, ) ** Knuckle Up #50‚Äì55 (tpb, 144 pages, 2012, ) ** Trail's End #56‚Äì60 (tpb, 128 pages, 2012, ) *Hellblazer #245‚Äì246: \\"Newcastle Calling\\" (with Sean Murphy, 2008) *Joker's Asylum: Penguin (with Jason Pearson, one-shot, 2008) collected in Joker's Asylum Volume 1 (tpb, 128 pages, 2008, ) =Marvel Comics= *X-Men: **Wolverine: *** Wolverine by Jason Aaron Omnibus (hc, 688 pages, 2011, ) collects: **** \\"A Good Man\\" (with UDON, in Wolverine vol. 2 #175, 2002) **** \\"The Man in the Pit\\" (with Howard Chaykin, in Wolverine vol. 3 #56, 2007) **** \\"Get Mystique!\\" (with Ron Garney, in Wolverine vol. 3 #62‚Äì65, 2008) **** Wolverine: Manifest Destiny #1‚Äì4 (with Stephen Segovia, 2008‚Äì2009) **** Dark X-Men: The Beginning #3: \\"Get Mystique (Slight Return)\\" (with Jock, 2009) **** \\"A Day in the Life\\" (with Adam Kubert, in Wolverine vol. 3 #73‚Äì74, 2009) **** Wolverine: Weapon X: ***** \\"The Adamantium Men\\" (with Ron Garney, in #1‚Äì5, 2009) ***** \\"All We Want is the World and Everything in It\\" (with Esad Ribiƒá, in Dark Reign: The List ‚Äì Wolverine, one-shot, 2009) ***** \\"Insane in the Brain\\" (with Yanick Paquette, in #6‚Äì9, 2009‚Äì2010) ***** \\"Love and the Wolverine\\" (with C.

Kirama Wimalajhoti Thera who had returned to Sri Lanka after twenty years of dedicated missionary activity in Malaysia, Singapore and US. It was inaugurated on January 2, 1992 under the auspices of Ven. Dr. K. Sri Dhammananda Thera, the chief prelate of Malaysia and Singapore and a plethora of other internationally famed Buddhist scholar monks of the time. It sought to fill a need of the devoted Buddhists in Sri Lanka and the rest of the world. What made Ven. Wimalajhoti Thera start the BCC was the dearth of Buddhist publications in Sri Lanka notwithstanding its reputation as a country where Buddhism prevails in its pristine form. This fact was pointed to Ven. Wimalajhoti Thera by some of his foreign neophytes who had arrived in Sri Lanka to learn Buddhism when they had strolled quite unsuccessfully all over the outskirts of Colombo along with him in search of some Buddhist publications. The BCC having thus begun in a small scale purporting to dispense the Dhamma among Buddhist devotees expanded massively with time thanks to the dedication and zeal of Ven. Wimalajhoti Thera. By now it has perhaps become the world‚Äôs largest Theravada Buddhist book collection. It dispenses not only Dhamma books but also other items venerated and frequently used by Buddhists such as images of the Buddha, requisites of Buddhist monks (Atapirikara), incense sticks and meditation cushions‚Ä¶etc. In 1993 a meditation centre was set up on a 20-acre mountainous plateau amidst a salubrious sylvan environment as the first appendage to be added to the BCC network. It is situated in Dekanduwala, Horana about 30 km away from Colombo. It has residential facilities and provides training in meditation for both local and foreign nationals since 1994. Among the programs it conducted, the two-week temporary ordination for young people carried out in 2003 became particularly popular. The training in Dhamma and meditation has also been provided for nuns both local and foreign since 2002. The management and execution of the training programs thereof are done by fifteen fully ordained bhikkhunƒ´s. So far around 2000 foreigners have been trained by the centre besides local participants and nuns. This meditation centre is soon to be converted into a \\"Bhikkhunƒ´ Training Centre\\" equipped for training prospective nuns, which is to be affiliated to the BCC and is to be divested of government support. In 1995 a printing press was amalgamated to the BCC to print and publish ancient but extant and rare Sinhala Dhamma treatises. In the same year, a mobile bookshop was launched to make the Dhamma books accessible particularly to those who live in rural areas and to promote the reading habit among the general populace. In 2002 a branch of the BCC was started in the airport at the departure/transit lounge which was designated \\"Food for the Mind\\". It serves to disseminate Dhamma among interested foreigners and locals. In 2011, a new building designated Sambuddhatva Jayanthi Mandiraya was erected at the heart of Colombo in commemoration of 2600 years of the advent of Buddhism. It consists of 16 storeys and includes auditorium facilities for conferences, seminars, convocations‚Ä¶etc. It also incorporates a bookshop operating under the BCC at Nedimala, Dehiwala, probably the largest of its kind containing books on Buddhism in the world. It is a centre of Buddhist activity wherein seminars and classes are held on various Buddhist themes as meditation and also correspondence courses in Buddhism are conducted for the benefit of those who are desirous of imbibing Buddhist wisdom. Moreover, local and foreign languages are taught there as well as a Buddhist counseling service is carried out; and many more facets to its multifarious Buddhist activities. BCC since its induction in 1992, it has the following achievements to its credit: * Making available Buddhist books that are in print to the scholar and the ordinary Buddhist devotee. * Printing and publishing ancient, hardly extant Dhamma treatises. * Printing and publishing the whole Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka set which was largely construed as a government venture. * Printing and publishing commentaries (Attakatha) in Pali and Sinhala. * Printing and publishing some of the sub-commentaries (Tika) in Sinhala. * Translation of some of the commentaries into English. * Promoting meditation and the Buddhist way of life among the populace. * Dispensing of Free Dhamma books. * Making available various items frequently used by Buddhists such as images, lamps, posters and requisites of a monk (atapirikar), etc. * All the activities connected with the Sambuddhatva Jayanthi Mandiraya. * Numerous social services as providing a building for the Tangalle Hospital and an auditorium for a school in Kirama. * Promoting Buddhism in English by publishing a series of books for students of International schools.

The satellite was acquired in the 2013 purchase of GeoEye.  History  On 1 December 2004, General Dynamics C4 Systems announced it had been awarded a contract worth approximately to build the OrbView-5 satellite. Its sensor is designed by the ITT Exelis. The satellite, now known as GeoEye-1, was originally scheduled for launch in April 2008 but lost its 30-day launch slot to a U.S. government mission which had itself been delayed. It was rescheduled for launch 22 August 2008 from Vandenberg Air Force Base aboard a Delta II launch vehicle. The launch was postponed to 4 September 2008, due to unavailability of the Big Crow telemetry-relay aircraft. It was delayed again to 6 September because Hurricane Hanna interfered with its launch crews. The launch took place successfully on 6 September 2008 at 18:50:57 UTC. The GeoEye-1 satellite separated successfully from its Delta II launch vehicle at 19:49 UTC, 58 minutes and 56 seconds after launch.  Specifications and operation  GeoEye-1 provides panchromatic and multispectral imagery at nadir in swaths. The spacecraft is in a Sun-synchronous orbit at an altitude of and an inclination of 98 degrees, with a 10:30 a.m. equator crossing time. GeoEye-1 can image up to 60 degrees off nadir. It is operated out of Dulles, Virginia. At the time of its launch, GeoEye-1 was the world's highest resolution commercial Earth-imaging satellite. GeoEye-1 was manufactured in Gilbert, Arizona, by General Dynamics and the first image was returned on 7 October of Kutztown University in Pennsylvania. Google, which had its logo on the side of the rocket, has exclusive online mapping use of its data. While GeoEye-1 is capable of imagery with details the size of , that resolution was only available to the U.S. government. Google has access to details of . Prior maximum commercial imagery was . The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency and Google paid a combined for the satellite and upgrades to GeoEye's four ground stations. = 2009 anomaly = In December 2009 GeoEye announced it had suspended imagery collections by GeoEye-1 for a few days, citing an irregularity in the downlink antenna. \\"The irregularity appears to limit the range of movement of GeoEye-1 downlink antenna, which may in turn affect GeoEye-1 ability to image and downlink simultaneously,\\" GeoEye said at a press conference. However, the satellite continued with normal operations shortly thereafter, though with diminished simultaneous imaging-and-downlink capability for non-U.S. clients.

Background Prior to the reform of town and city government by the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, the rank of \\"freeman\\" existed in all boroughs. Freemen enjoyed exemption from tolls and other special privileges, and in most cases were the only persons eligible to vote at parliamentary elections. Depending on the borough's charter of incorporation, freedom could be inherited by sons, daughters or widows, or by ship to an existing freeman. Corporations also had the right to designate persons otherwise unqualified as freemen, and the purchase of freedom was also widespread. The Radical authors of the original municipal reform bill had intended to entirely abolish the office of freeman. However, following a bitter parliamentary campaign where opposition came from both Whigs and Tories, those who held the rank of freeman on 5 June 1835, and their heirs and successors, continued to enjoy \\"the same Share and Benefit of the Lands, Tenements, and Hereditaments, and of the Rents and Profits thereof, and of the Common Lands and Public Stock\\" of the borough.Municipal Corporations Act 1835 c.76 ss.2-3 However, the Act expressly forbid the extension of freedom beyond this group of people, providing that \\"no Person shall be elected, made, or admitted a Burgess or Freeman of any Borough by Gift or Purchase\\". The Municipal Corporations Act 1882, which replaced the 1835 legislation, continued to reserve the \\"rights and interests\\" of existing freemen, and again banned the admission of persons to the freedom of the borough by purchase or gift.Municipal Corporations Act 1882 c.50 ss. 201 & 202 Campaign by Kingston-upon-Hull Fifty years after the passing of the 1835 Act, Kingston upon Hull Town Council wished to have the power to grant the honorary freedom of the borough. Accordingly, they made steps to add a clause to a private parliamentary bill for the purpose. The council was supported by the Marquess of Ripon, who held the ceremonial office of High Steward of Kingston upon Hull. When he attempted to promote the clause in the House of Lords, this was opposed by Lord Redesdale, Chairman of Committees, who felt that the measure should be extended to all boroughs. Accordingly, a private member's bill was piloted through the Lords by the Marquess of Ripon, and through the Commons by Charles Norwood, one of Kingston upon Hull's MPs. The Act The Act was a short one, consisting of only three sections. Section 1 provided that: > ..the council of every borough may from time to time, by the authority of > not less than two-thirds of their number present and voting at a meeting of > the council specially called for the purpose with notice of the object, > admit to be honorary freeman of the borough persons of distinction and any > persons who have rendered eminent services to the borough... The Act further explained that the honorary freedom did not give the recipient the right to vote in parliamentary or other elections for the borough, or to enjoy any of the rights and interests of existing freemen. The Act received the royal assent on 22 July 1885, and Kingston-upon-Hull Town Council moved quickly to use the new legislation to honour their High Steward. At a special meeting of the council held on 29 July, the Marquess of Ripon became the first honorary freeman of Hull, and the first recipient of the honour under the 1885 Act. Repeal and successor legislation The Act continued in force until the enactment of the Local Government Act 1933, which repealed and consolidated all local government legislation in England and Wales. Section 259 of the 1933 Act continued the powers of borough corporations to appoint honorary freemen. The 1933 Act was itself repealed by the Local Government Act 1972, and awards of honorary freedom are now made under that legislation as amended by the Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Act 2009.

Its remains have been found in the Quercy Phosphorites of France, a geological formation containing Late Eocene and Early Oligocene deposits. They lived some 30-35 million years ago. Not all species described herein may be valid. The Middle Eocene Hassiavis, a more recently described bird from the famous Messel Pit in Germany, might also belong there. In addition, a somewhat enigmatic fossil in the M. Daniels collection, found in the Early Eocene London Clay appears to belong here too. They were initially thought be prehistoric trogon. However, it is nowadays generally believed that they are not very closely related to these tropical forest birds of our time, but rather convergent. The Archaeotrogonidae actually seem to be Cypselomorphae and related to nightjars and hummingbirds, either as a basal lineage or as a distinct but entirely extinct family. The latter might be more justified than with other indeterminate Cretaceous and Paleogene modern birds: they are known from a time when the living cypselomorph families were already distinct, yet appears as well highly autapomorphic and the archaeotrogonid lineage seems to go as far back as that of nightjars for example.

She was used by the Navy to patrol navigable waterways of the Confederacy to prevent the South from trading with other countries. Western World‚Äîa screw steamer built in 1856 at Brooklyn, New York‚Äîwas purchased by the Navy on 21 September 1861 at New York City from S. Schuyler; and commissioned on 3 January 1862 at the New York Navy Yard, Acting Master Samuel B. Gregory in command.  Assigned to the South Atlantic Blockade  On 2 January 1862, Western World was ordered to Port Royal, South Carolina, to join the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron. On the 26th, she participated in a major reconnaissance sweep of the Savannah River, Georgia, and its tributaries. The force included the gunboats and ; armed steamers , , and ; and transports Cosmopolitan, , and Boston carrying over 2,400 troops under the command of Brigadier General H. G. Wright. The Union flotilla repulsed an attack by five Confederate vessels on 28 January and the next day completed invaluable survey work. On 14 February 1862, Western World and drove off four Confederate vessels which attempted to break the Union blockade of the Mud and Wright's Rivers, tributaries of the Savannah River. This restricted Confederate activity upon the Savannah River and protected the newly installed Federal battery at Venus Point. After remaining off the Savannah through May, Western World returned to Port Royal on 2 June. On the 6th, Western World called briefly at St. Johns River, Florida, to reprovision Union ships on blockade duty there. She immediately returned to Port Royal and was dispatched on the 10th to the blockade off Georgetown, South Carolina, commanded by Comdr. G. A. Prentiss on board .  Setting fire to plantations and carrying away escaped slaves  On 25 June 1862, Western World, Andrew, and E. B. Hale entered the North Santee River, South Carolina, intending to destroy an important railroad bridge inland. En route, parties from the warships set fire to several plantations and took over 400 slaves on board the steamers. During an expedition in Winyah Bay, South Carolina, Western World captured the British schooner Volante on 2 July. However, intense shore fire and the sharp, unnavigable bends of the river prompted Comdr. Prentiss to abandon the expedition the following day. On the 25th, Western World sailed for Port Royal carrying contraband. However, she soon left the squadron base for blockade duty off Doboy Sound, Georgia, which occupied the ship until the end of October when she sailed north to the New York Navy Yard for extensive overhaul.  Assigned to the North Atlantic Blockade  Western World departed New York on 16 February 1863 and arrived at Newport News, Virginia, on 11 March for duty with the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron. A week later, she towed to Baltimore, Maryland, for repairs. Structural problems forced Western World, herself, to the Philadelphia Navy Yard late in the month; but she departed Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on 1 April for Yorktown, Virginia, and blockade duty between the Piankatank River and Fort Monroe, Virginia.  Operating in the Chesapeake Bay and Virginia coast waters  Through the spring and summer, Western World participated actively in operations along the Virginia coast and in the Chesapeake Bay. On 19 April, she and escorted transport units of the Army of the Potomac up the York as far as the Pamunkey River. Together with , she captured schooners Martha Ann and A. Carson off Horn Harbor, Virginia, on the 24th. With , she destroyed two abandoned schooners in Milford Haven, Virginia, on 1 May 1863. On the 27th, she captured two large sailboats, took two prisoners, and confiscated Confederate coin and currency in Stokes Creek, Virginia. On 13 June 1863, Western World proceeded north to search for Confederate commerce raider Tacony. However, she lost her rudderhead during a storm and returned to the Norfolk Navy Yard for repairs on 17 June 1863.  Carrying 300 cavalry to Virginia  Western World was back in action within a week. Beginning on 23 June 1863, with gunboats , Commodore Morris, , Smith Briggs, and Jesup, she escorted and covered a troop landing at White House, Virginia. During the week-long operation, Western World brought up and landed nearly 300 cavalry. On 1 July 1863, she was deployed in the Pamunkey River, Virginia. Late in the month, Western World returned to Hampton Roads where she picked up mail for delivery to blockade ships off Wilmington, North Carolina. On the voyage to North Carolina waters, she also carried 150 seamen to Beaufort, North Carolina, for blockade duty in the sounds. On 10 September 1863, the worn-out vessel proceeded to the Washington Navy Yard for repairs.  Reassigned to the Potomac Flotilla  Repairs completed, Western World was assigned on 2 February 1864 to the Second Division of the Potomac Flotilla but, a week later, was transferred to the First Division and assigned to patrol duty from Piankatank River to Blakistone Island. However, the ship returned to the Washington Navy Yard on 1 April for more repairs and remained there until early November.  Reassigned to the North Atlantic Blockade  Western World was assigned to the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron on 10 November 1864. She patrolled the Virginia coast between the Nansemond River and Lawn's Creek and, on 15 December 1864, helped to refloat the grounded monitor . On 5 March 1865, she arrived in the Rappahannock River to support the Army of the Potomac in operations against Fredericksburg, Virginia. Later transferred to White House, Virginia, she sailed on 21 March for St. Inigoes, Maryland, and duty in the Potomac Flotilla. Western World was deployed in Virginia's Mobjack Bay on 6 April and, on 5 May, proceeded to the Washington Navy Yard.  Post-war decommissioning and sale  She was decommissioned there on 26 May 1865 and was sold at public auction on 24 June 1865 to H. R. Hazelhurst.

It is active throughout the state, but has major foci in Prince George's County, Montgomery County and Baltimore. CASA influences Maryland politics on a wide range of policies, ranging from law-enforcement to education. History CASA was originally known as the \\"Central American Solidarity Association of Maryland\\". The organization's name was officially changed to CASA of Maryland, Inc., on July 28, 1995. The organization's name was officially changed to CASA de Maryland, Inc., on September 4, 2008. CASA was founded in 1985 in the basement of the Takoma Park Presbyterian Church by US citizens and Central American immigrants. It has since expanded its scope. It is affiliate organization of the National Council of La Raza. They are a member of the National Day Laborer Organizing Network. CASA is also a founding member of the National Capital Immigration Coalition, which promotes \\"comprehensive immigration reform\\". In June 2010, CASA opened a multicultural center in the heart of Langley Park and located in the former Langley Park mansion. The project was budgeted at $31 million in 2007. Governor Martin O'Malley, a Democrat, said at the fundraising kickoff for the project, \\"In our Maryland, there's no such thing as a spare American\\". Activity CASA offers health assistance, medical interpretations, English classes, financial literacy classes, vocational training, social services, leadership development, legal services, and employment placement for low-income families, particularly Latino immigrants and other immigrants. CASA provides legal support to the large and growing community of immigrants‚Äîdocumented or otherwise‚Äîin the greater Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. They have successfully promoted a wide range of legislation in support of the immigrant community, including a Maryland law that requires reasonable access to government services for people with limited English proficiency. CASA is very aggressive in pursuing absconding employers, contractors who do not pay their day-laborers. CASA is also involved in housing law and advocacy. In 2004, CASA attorney Kimberley A. Propeack told the Daily Record that the group's housing attorney represents immigrants who are targeted by landlords if they raise concerns or try to form residents' associations. CASA has rescued a number of victims of domestic slavery, also known as human trafficking. =Day labor centers= CASA operates five day labor centers throughout the state, with public and private funding; three centers are in Montgomery County. These centers, run by CASA on behalf of the county government under contract, provide central sites where contractors can pick up day-laborers. The centers have sparked protests and counter-protests. The center near Shady Grove was damaged by a fire within its first month of operation; the fire was ruled to be arson and classified a \\"hate incident\\" by county police. The centers allow day laborers to seek work without violating Gaithersburg's anti-solicitation ordinance, a law that makes it a misdemeanor to conduct hires in public places. Most of the opposition centers around the assumption that many of the day-laborers in Montgomery County are undocumented workers, mostly from Central America. CASA opened an employment center in Baltimore on December 20, 2007. The center is funded by foundations and Community Development Block Grant funds; renovation of the building housing the center was funded by the City of Baltimore and an anonymous donor. According to Maryland Secretary of the Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation, Thomas Perez, \\"Labor centers are the most cost- effective investment of government money I can imagine ... We're providing employment, addressing public safety by creating an orderly process, keeping people from street corners and protecting workers.\\" The opening was applauded by local labor groups, immigrant advocates, and city leaders. Local residents had been pushing for an alternative to street-corner hiring. Funding CASA has received funding from a variety of sources, including a two-year grant funding operations in Baltimore from George Soros' Open Society Institute. Other funding sources include the Annie E. Casey Foundation and United Way. CASA received $1.5 million from CITGO, the state-owned Venezuelan petroleum products corporation, in 2008 to fund educational, training, and economic- development programs. Criticism CASA works on many issues of concern to the immigrant community in Maryland, and as a result, CASA has been a source of controversy. Most of the controversy centers around allegations that the day-labor centers administrated by the group are primarily used by undocumented immigrants, who may not legally be employed in any capacity in the US. =Montgomery County day-labor center= Montgomery County's award of contracts to develop day-labor centers near Gaithersburg to CASA ignited some controversy, including a case of arson. The site, located outside both Gaithersburg and Rockville, was a service park behind a Department of Liquor Control warehouse, and was opened as a temporary location. Because of the site's location, the county had sole control over the site approval process; although the county Planning Board had to undertake a mandatory referral process, the planning rules allowed County Executive Isiah Leggett to make the ultimate decision. The site stirred worry in nearby Derwood and other communities. Some residents expressed concerns about the proposal. In a letter to The Gazette, Brad Botwin announced that he was forming a group called Help Save Maryland because of \\"growing abuses of official power\\", specifically the day-labor center near Shady Grove. Botwin characterized the center as \\"a taxpayer-funded illegal worker pickup center on property slated for job- creating high-tech companies and a needed fire station.\\" Botwin, a member of the Shady Grove Advisory Committee and former co-president of the Greater Shady Grove Civic Alliance, was concerned over the center's impact on the sector plan implementation process. He said that the plan required extensive committee meetings and approvals, but Leggett did not use such processes in siting the center. Pat Labuda, president of the Greater Shady Grove Civic Alliance and also a member of the Shady Grove Advisory Committee, said \\"I think it's a problem that what Rockville and Gaithersburg don't want, Derwood gets\\". Like Botwin, Labuda was concerned about the center's impact on the sector plan. While Labuda supported the need for the facility, she expressed the wish that the county had discussed it with residents before choosing the site. A Gaithersburg resident task force that had studied the day-laborer situation supported the proposal. Cathy Drzyzgula, a member of that task force, called the proposal \\"a middle path, since it pleases neither extreme, but instead the larger share of people who hold moderate views on the issue\\" in a letter to The Gazette. =Rights pamphlet= Two immigration raids created significant fear in the community of illegal aliens and persons whose relatives or loved ones were illegal aliens. In response, CASA published a pamphlet with basic information about rights such as the right to remain silent and the right to an attorney. According to The Washington Times, the pamphlet, \\"which features cartoonlike drawings of armed black and white police officers escorting Hispanic men in handcuffs and shows babies crying because their fathers are behind bars, is the product of CASA of Maryland Inc., working with other organizations.\\" CASA director of community organizing and political action Kim Propeack said \\"We consider providing people with accurate information about their rights fundamentally important to the people we serve, the local community concerned about public safety, and to the national community, which has adopted a bill of rights\\". Representative Dana Rohrabacher of California, a Republican, called the pamphlet \\"harmful to America\\" because it teaches illegal aliens \\"how to circumvent the law\\", and that CASA was \\"aiding and abetting criminal activity\\" by distributing it. =Minuteman Project= Statements to The Gazette by Gustavo Torres, CASA's Executive Director, that CASA was determined to track the leadership of a local unit of Minuteman Project, caused controversy. The Maryland Minuteman Civil Defense Corps, a non-governmental watchdog group, photographed and videotaped employers hiring workers at day-laborer sites run by CASA, with the intent of reporting the employers to state and Federal officials as violating immigration laws. Torres told The Gazette that CASA would target the Minutemen: \\"We are going picket their houses, and the schools of their kids, and go to their work. If they are going to do this to us, we are going to respond in the same way, to let people know their neighbors are extremists, that they are anti-immigrant.\\" Torres later partially retracted this statement, saying that his threat to picket schools attended by Minuteman members' children was a \\"misunderstanding\\" made in anger. Steven Schreiman, president of the Maryland Minuteman Civil Defense Corps, said \\"the threat shows an intent and it shows their mentality, and it shows them for what they are[...] They‚Äôre a bunch of thugs and bullies and they have a political agenda and they want to push that agenda regardless of the costs or consequences. Furthermore, they‚Äôve threatened to go after us at our homes and our places of business, which is harassment.\\" Kim Propeack, CASA spokeswoman, said \\"People should not expect in a modern society to engage in a campaign of intimidation without having a response\\", adding that if the Minutemen \\"want to come to CASA de Maryland, it's perfectly legitimate of us to go to the Minutemen's homes and also protest.\\" =Enforcement of immigration laws= CASA promotes community policing over local police enforcement of immigration enforcement, a power historically reserved to the federal government. Montgomery County officials expressed support for this notion, yet the government's inclusion, in 2002, of hundreds of thousands of names of people who had outstanding deportation orders into the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) database threatened to undermine Montgomery County's efforts. Ignoring a deportation order is an administrative violation, not a violation of criminal law; the NCIC is, by design, a database of criminal warrants. Two police associations lobbied against the inclusion, saying that it would hinder cooperation from witnesses and victims of violent crimes who are in the country unlawfully. CASA advocated that the Montgomery County Department of Police ignore these civil detainers. \\"These are people who haven‚Äôt broken any laws other than getting a traffic ticket, and they‚Äôre being arrested and taken to jail\\"], declared Kim Propeack, CASA director of community action. At a meeting with Latino advocates in late June 2007, County Police Chief J. Thomas Manger said that while he disagrees with the decision to put immigration detainers in NCIC, he believes police officers have no choice but to serve them. As a result, The Gazette reported, \\"the chief said he could not in 'good conscience' order his officers not to serve the warrants if he were told to ignore them by county officials. 'Get a new police chief when that happens,'\\" said Manger, who later clarified that he had no intent to leave. Manger, who was praised by Propeack for his accessibility, said that the immigration issue \\"breaks my heart.\\" , Montgomery County police were still checking, and honoring, the NCIC wants-and-warrants notifications, albeit with some reluctance as evidenced in this statement from Chief Manger: \\"It's very important for the local police department to develop strong relationships with the community[...] That trust is being jeopardized CASA's executive director Gustavo Torres said, \\"We dearly hope that the county re-evaluates its role serving as immigration police[...] The [county police's] enforcement of civil immigration law has severely damaged the faith of the immigration community in its county.\\" , Maryland did not have a consistent statewide policy on civil detainers. The Frederick County sheriff's office has deputies with specialized training in searching for illegal immigrants, while the Prince George's County Police do not enforce immigration warrants as a matter of county policy. Takoma Park has a policy of being a \\"sanctuary city\\" and does not permit its police department to arrest people based on criminal immigration warrants. =Lawsuits= CASA has launched a variety of lawsuits. One such lawsuit was against the Maryland Motor Vehicle Administration to improve the administration of drivers licenses for out of country applicants. The lawsuit is ongoing, but is essentially mooted by implementation of the Federal Real ID Act of 2005. In response to Real ID, the Motor Vehicle Administration considered a two-tiered system, issuing Maryland drivers licenses and then another Real ID‚Äìcompliant identification that would permit entry into Federal buildings and the boarding of airplanes. Maryland, along with several other states, was given an extension of time to comply with Real ID requirements. Governor Martin O'Malley rejected the proposal, directing the Maryland Motor Vehicle Administration to phase in compliance with Real ID . CASA's Kim Propeack said \\"The administration is prioritizing political pandering over good policymaking\\" and that the governor \\"is ignoring all the support he's heard over the years for the system as it exists\\". In November 2008, CASA filed a Public Information Act lawsuit alleging that the Frederick County Sheriff's Office violated the Constitution and engaged in racial profiling by performing immigration law enforcement functions under section 287(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. \\"We're trying to shine a light on this program, which we feel has been kind of operating in the shadows,\\" said Justin Cox, an attorney for CASA. \\"We have very strong anecdotal evidence of constitutional violations and racial profiling and the ultimate goal is to make sure the Sheriff's Office is being held accountable.\\" See also *League of United Latin American Citizens References External links * Category:American community activists Category:Hispanic and Latino American culture in Maryland Category:Immigrant rights organizations in the United States Category:Langley Park, Maryland Category:Non-profit organizations based in Maryland Category:Companies based in Takoma Park, Maryland Category:1985 establishments in Maryland Category:Workers' rights organizations ","title":"CASA de Maryland"},{"id":"13701427","text":"The New Road (top left) on an 1807 map before the construction of Regent's Park. New Road on an 1848 map after the construction of Regent's Park. A 1918 street map showing the stretch of the former New Road from Marylebone Road to Euston Road. The New Road was a toll road built across fields around the northern boundaries of London, the first part of which opened in 1756. The route comprises the following modern-day roads: Old Marylebone Road, Marylebone Road, Euston Road, Pentonville Road, City Road, and Moorgate. Background In the 18th century London began to grow rapidly. Until 1750 there was only one road crossing over the River Thames, namely London Bridge. But the capital started to sprawl, first along the river from the City to Westminster, and then north past Soho (in medieval times, the king's hunting grounds) to Oxford Street and beyond. The Proceedings of the Old Bailey Online Project give a good overview of the demographic growth of the capital. From the early 19th century, London was the largest city in the world. Early history In 1755 influential residents of St Marylebone, Paddington and Islington, all separate villages close to London, petitioned Parliament for the right to provide a turnpike trust road by-passing the northern boundaries of the built up area of London. The road was intended initially as a drovers' road, a route along which to drive cattle and sheep, to the live meat market at Smithfield from roads approaching London from the north and north-west, thus avoiding the congested east-west route via Oxford Street and High Holborn. The road would begin at a point close to the junction of the Harrow and Edgware Roads and head due east past the northern end of Marylebone Lane to Tottenham Court, and from there via Battle Bridge, St Pancras, to the top of St John's Street in Islington, a short distance from the market. The proposal was referred to a parliamentary committee, which, despite opposition from the Duke of Bedford, recommended approval; it suggested that responsibility for the road should be divided between two existing trusts, the St Marylebone (for the section from Edgware Road to Tottenham Court, plus a side street that became Portland Road) and the Islington (for the section from Tottenham Court to the Angel, Islington). Royal assent for the Act was granted in May 1756. The road was to be a minimum of wide, and no buildings were to be allowed within of the edge - drovers' roads always needed to be wide. The road was built to a minimum width of , and very rapidly. Construction at first was fairly crude, involving mainly cutting down hedges and filling in ditches, and the route was bounded by fence posts. Initially, each administering trust retained the tolls exacted as travellers passed its gates, but the tickets were also valid across the section operated by the other trust. As examples of revenue, the St Marylebone trust exacted ¬£400 in 1757, which had risen to ¬£700 in 1764. Five years later the road was extended at its eastern end south- eastwards to Old Street and onwards terminating near Moorgate. Later history The route became an important transport link. In due course it was improved and metalled. During the remainder of the 18th century the northern edge of London's built-up area moved towards the road, finally engulfing it, although the building margin was enforced. By 1829 much of the road was bordered by fashionable houses, and in that year that the first horse omnibus service in London was established by George Shillibeer. His example was followed by many others, and the route became the main artery for such traffic for the remainder of the century, linking the sought-after north-western suburbs of 'Tyburnia'T F T Baker, Diane K Bolton and Patricia E C Croot, 'Paddington: Tyburnia', in A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 9, Hampstead, Paddington, ed.

In 1857, New Road was renamed, becoming Marylebone Road, Euston Road and Pentonville Road. In 1863, the Metropolitan Railway opened the first urban underground railway in the world. Most of the line followed the route of the New Road from Paddington to Kings Cross stations. In the 20th century, with the advent of motor buses and other motor vehicles, the route became an important orbital road for the northern part of inner London, and part of the inner ring road. Currently the road as far as the Old Street Roundabout is the northern boundary of the London Congestion Charge area. Traffic can use the route free of charge, but a charge applies when accessing the roads to the south.

The process is first started when saline water seeps into cracks and evaporates depositing salt crystals. When the rocks are then heated, the crystals will expand putting pressure on the surrounding rock which will over time splinter the stone into fragments. Salt crystallization may also take place when solutions decompose rocks (for example, limestone and chalk) to form salt solutions of sodium sulfate or sodium carbonate, from which water evaporates to form their respective salt crystals. The salts which have proved most effective in disintegrating rocks are sodium sulfate, magnesium sulfate, and calcium chloride. Some of these salts can expand up to three times or more in volume. It is normally associated with arid climates where strong heating causes strong evaporation and therefore salt crystallization. It is also common along coasts. An example of salt weathering can be seen in the honeycombed stones in sea walls.  References  *F.J.P.M.

The company purchased land South of the moshava Hadera from a Bedouin clan in order to settle forty families there. Each family received a farm of 20 chickens and one cow, a share in a joint orchard and a small home with one room, a small kitchen and a balcony. Towards the end of 1928, the forty houses were ready to house the new settlers, and the company had also given comfort purchasing conditions. As time went by, the farms began to grow but there were no jobs to provide the settlers' daily needs. There was an attempt to grow Jasmine flowers for the Baron Rothschild's perfume factory in Binyamina, but this didn't work out. During the 1929 Palestine riots the citizens of Kfar Brandeis were evacuated to the nearest Hadera, although the men returned to guard the settlement, armed with only one hunting gun and a few bayonets. The settlers also suffered during the 1936‚Äì1939 Arab revolt in Palestine, as Arab mobs destroyed part of their orchard and murdered a number of citizens.

G. Davis became ill and was no longer able to serve. He also united the Baptist Church of Georgetown and founded Looney Springs (now called Campbell Hill), and the Illinois Association of Free Communion Baptists. Early life Henry Gordon was born in Franklin County, Pennsylvania, to George and Nancy Gordon of the Cumberland Valley Gordons. Both of his parents were of Scottish descent, having immigrated to the United States in 1697. His grandfather was actually born during the voyage across the Atlantic Ocean. Gordon grew up along the Meramec River in Missouri where his father had built and operated a gristmill. At 19 years old, Henry married a young woman by the name of Rebecca Young and received a of land from his father, which he sold not too long after, moving to southern Illinois just outside Georgetown to a town called Short‚Äôs Prairie (now called Steeleville). Illinois Shortly after moving to Short‚Äôs Prairie, Gordon united the Baptist church of Georgetown and was ordained by the Missionary Baptist Church. However, he soon realized that he was not educated enough to preach the gospel and moved his family to Alton, Illinois, where he attended Shurtleff Theological College. During this time he also suffered the death of his first-born daughter at the age of two but his wife soon gave birth to a second daughter, Mary, shortly after. While living in Alton they added three sons to their family. Tragically in 1848 Gordon suffered another loss, that of his wife Rebecca. Approximately a year later though he remarried, to Nancy Hill of Centreville, Illinois, who brought a son with her into their marriage. Their family continued to grow as another five sons were born to them bringing the total to ten children. Following his graduation from Shurtleff Theological College, Gordon traveled all over southern Illinois and preached. The first ten or twelve years of his ministry were dedicated to the Missionary Baptist Church, which was a member of the Nine Mile Association. In 1850, he organized at church at Looney Springs (now called Campbell Hill) with nine members. Shortly after starting the Looney Springs church, he announced that the Lord‚Äôs Supper would be given. During this time in Illinois history, the churches tended to be very scattered and most wanted to join them for communion. After a lot of debate, Gordon decided that the people were right and let the other churches participate in the communion service. Unfortunately, this caused him to be brought up on charges and he was excluded from the Missionary Baptist Church. Gordon did not let this get him down however and in 1851 he organized a new Baptist Church of Georgetown and an association that include the new Baptist Church of Georgetown, Looney Springs Baptist Church, Pipestone Baptist Church in Denmark, and Pleasant Ridge Baptist Church and named it the Southern Illinois Association of Free Communion Baptist. Later years In 1885, he and his wife moved to Campbell Hill. After about seven years, they moved to Percy, Illinois, and built a house where he died at about the age of 82. Not believing in egotism or self-praise, Gordon never kept a diary or any record of anything that he accomplished during his ministry. Any information that is known about him has been told by his son. References *George A. Gordon, The Life and Labors of Rev. Henry S.

The Pakistani part of Poonch District (now a Division) is part of the Azad Kashmir territory, whilst the Indian Poonch District is part of the Jammu and Kashmir union territory. The capital of the Pakistan-controlled side is Rawalakot; while the capital of the Indian side is Poonch. In ancient times, Poonch was part of the Abhisara region and formed part of Alexander the Great's conquests. In later sources, the region is called Paranotsa, but also known by its capital city, Lohara, which gave rise to the Lohara dynasty of Kashmir ( 1003‚Äì1320 CE). Afterwards Poonch came under the control of the Mughal Empire, then the Durrani Empire and finally the Sikh Empire. The Sikh monarch, Maharaja Ranjit Singh gave Poonch to the Dogra noble, Raja Dhyan Singh, as a fief. After the death of Ranjit Singh, Dhyan Singh was murdered in Sikh intrigues, and the region was transferred to Gulab Singh as part of the Jammu and Kashmir state under British suzerainty. After the departure of the British in August 1947, the tribesmen of Poonch rebelled, inviting Pakistani assistance and giving rise to the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947. The war ended a year later with the region being divided between India and Pakistan. Early history =Ancient History= When Alexander invaded the lower Jhelum belt to fight Porus, the Jhelum valley region was known as Abhisara. It is likely that the Kashmir Valley was under the control of this region. The Abhisaras submitted to the invader, along with Ambhi of Takshashila (Taxila), and the region was consolidated into the Alexander's empire. The Rajatarangini mentions Poonch under the name Paranotsa. Xuanzang in the 7th century transliterated it as Pun-nu-tso. Based on the Mahabharata evidence,MBH 7.4.5; 7/91/39-40. and evidence from 7th century Chinese traveler Xuanzang,Watters, Yuan Chawang, Vol I, p 284. the districts of Rajouri, Poonch and Abhisara had been under the sway of the Republican Kambojas during epic times.Political History of Ancient India, 1996, p 133, 219/220, Dr H. C. Raychaudhury, Dr B. N. Mukerjee; A History of India, p 269-71, N. R. Ray, N. K. Sinha; Journal of Indian History, p 304, University of Allahabad. Department of Modern Indian History, University of Kerala - 1921. At the time of Xuanzang's visit, the Kashmir Valley controlled all the territories adjacent to it in the south and the west, including Taxila, which is said to have been subjugated at a recent date. =Sovereign State= Around 850CE, Poonch became a sovereign state ruled by Raja Nar, who was basically a horse trader. According to Rajatrangani, Raja Trilochanpal of Poonch gave a tough fight to Mahmood Ghaznavi who invaded this area in 1020. Ghaznavi failed to enter Kashmir, as he could not capture the fort of Lohara (modern day Loran, in district of Poonch). =Mughal Era= In 1596, Mughal emperor Jahangir made Siraj-Ud-Din the ruler of Poonch. Siraj-Ud-Din and his descendants Raja Shahbaz Khan, Raja Abdul Razak, Raja Rustam Khan and Raja Khan Bahadur Khan ruled this area up to 1792. Sikh Empire (1819‚Äì1846) In 1819 this area was captured by Maharaja Ranjit Singh. Brothers Gulab Singh, Dhyan Singh and Suchet Singh, belonging to the House of Jammu, enrolled in the Maharaja's army and rose to high positions. In 1822, Ranjit Singh appointed Gulab Singh as the Raja of Jammu and, in 1827, appointed Dhyan Singh as the Raja of Bhimber, Chibbal and Poonch (covering the Mirpur and Poonch districts as of 1947 A peep into Bhimber, Daily Excelsior, 6 November 2016. ). Dhyan Singh spent most of his time in Lahore, subsequently becoming the diwan (prime minister) in the Sikh court. Gulab Singh is said to have managed his jagirs on his behalf. In 1837, the hill tribes of Poonch launched a rebellion, which Gulab Singh suppressed with some cruelty. After the death of Ranjit Singh in 1839, the Sikh court fell into anarchy and palace intrigues took over. Dhyan Singh, Suchet Singh as well as Dhyan Singh's son Hira Singh were murdered in these struggles. Poonch was confiscated by the Sikh Durbar on the grounds that the Rajas had rebelled against the state and handed it over to Faiz Talib Khan of Rajouri. Jammu and Kashmir State (1846‚Äì1947) The Poonch jagir included the present day Poonch and Sudhnoti districts of Azad Kashmir (in green) and the Poonch district of Jammu and Kashmir (in blue). After the First Anglo-Sikh War (1845‚Äì1846) and the subsequent Treaties of Lahore and Amritsar, the entire territory between the Beas and the Indus rivers was transferred to Gulab Singh, including Poonch. He was recognised an independent ruler, a maharaja, of the newly created state of Jammu and Kashmir. Gulab Singh reinstated the jagir of Poonch to Jawahir Singh, the eldest remaining son of Dhyan Singh. The brothers Jawahir Singh and Moti Singh were not satisfied. They put forward a claim to being independent rulers of Poonch, maintaining that they were entitled to a share in the 'family property' of all the territories controlled by Gulab Singh. The matter was adjudicated by Sir Frederick Currie, the British Resident in Lahore, in 1852, who confirmed that Gulab Singh was indeed their suzerain. The brothers were to give the Maharaja Gulab Singh a horse with gold trappings every year and consult him on all matters of importance. The House of Poonch however continued to contest this arrangement right up to 1940. In 1852, the brothers Jawahir Singh and Moti Singh quarrelled and the Punjab Board of Revenue awarded a settlement. Moti Singh was awarded the territory of the Poonch district, and Jawahir Singh that of the Mirpur district. Christopher Snedden remarks that Moti Singh's territory amounted to two-thirds of Dhyan Singh's estate. In 1859, Jawahir Singh was accused of 'treacherous conspiracy' by Maharaja Ranbir Singh (r. 1857‚Äì1885), who succeeded Gulab Singh. The British agreed with the assessment and forced Jawahir Singh into exile in Ambala. Ranbir Singh paid Jawahir Singh an annual stipend of Rs. 100,000 until his death, and confiscated his territory (the Mirpur district) afterwards because Jawahir Singh had no heirs. Moti Singh's son, Baldev Singh contested this action claiming that the territory should return to him as the sole surviving descendant of Dhyan Singh. The British did not accept the claim saying that Jawahir Singh forfeited his territory when he agreed to the annual stipend. = Autonomy disputes = After Maharaja Ranbir Singh was succeeded by Pratap Singh (r. 1885‚Äì1925), a 'Council of Administration' was imposed on Jammu and Kashmir by the British. The Council is said to have started encroaching on Poonch, egged on by Pratap Singh's brother Amar Singh. Complaints were made to the British, who continued the original line that Poonch was a feudatory of Jammu and Kashmir and so it was an internal affair of Jammu and Kashmir. Raja Baldev Singh (r. 1892‚Äì1918), who succeeded Moti Singh, complained in 1895 that Jammu and Kashmir started referring to Poonch as a jagir, whereas he maintained that it was a 'state'. This was apparently a very emotive issue for Baldev Singh and, subsequently, to the residents of Poonch. Baldev Singh's successor Sukhdev Singh (r. 1918‚Äì1927) and Jagatdev Singh (r. 1928‚Äì1940) continued the complaints. In 1927, the British resident in Kashmir Evelyn Howell got involved and he advised Maharaja Hari Singh that, while Poonch was clearly subsidiary to Jammu and Kashmir, it was only referred to as an illaqa in the original grant, not as a jagir. Jagatdev Singh ascended as the Raja in 1928 at a young age, and the reigning Maharaja Hari Singh (r. 1925‚Äì1949), son of Amar Singh, imposed a sanad (instruction) on him. The sanad mentioned, among others, that Poonch was a jagir and implemented several encroachments on the administration of Poonch. Frictions continued. In 1936, Jagatdev Singh sent a 'memorial' to the Viceroy of India, seeking a review of the relationship between Poonch and Jammu and Kashmir. The Government of India responded that, since Poonch was part of the state of Jammu and Kashmir, all submissions should be made through the British Resident of Jammu and Kashmir government. The Resident stated that the order of 1928, eventually based on Currie's original award, definitely settled the status of Poonch as a 'subordinate Jagirdar of Kashmir'. Jagatdev Singh's claims were dismissed without further comment. With the death of Jagatdev Singh in 1940, his son Shiv Ratandev Singh became the new Raja while being a minor. Maharaja Hari Singh appointed a guardian, who was his military secretary, to look after the Raja's 'property'. The Raja's mother was prohibited from participating in the minority administration. In July 1940, a gathering of Poonch public passed a resolution expressing 'profound sorrow and deep indignation and resentment' at the Maharaja's proclamation and his description of Poonch as a jagir. By 1945, the Maharaja's administration was deeply unpopular in Poonch, especially among the families of military servicemen, who contrasted it with that of their counterparts in Punjab. =Administration= Until Jagatdev Singh's accession in 1928, the Poonch jagir was autonomous, except for the payment of a token tribute of Rs. 231 to the Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir. The jagir had its own officials, including a bureaucracy, police and a standing army of one company. It is said that the local officials, most of whom were Hindus, were disgruntled because their salaries were lower than in the rest of state. This led to inefficiency and corruption. The Raja of Poonch owned all the land in the jagir. The actual 'holders of land' were referred to as assamis (agents) of the Raja. In the 1930s, 40 percent of the earnings were collected as tax, amounting to Rs. 1 million. Whereas proprietary rights were granted to landholders elsewhere in Kashmir following the Glancy Commission recommendations in 1933, the Poonchis did not benefit from the reforms due to the jagir's autonomy. For some unknown reason, the residents of the Mendhar tehsil were granted ownership rights, which caused further resentment in the other tehsils. After 1928, Maharaja Hari Singh started encroaching on the administration of Poonch and, a dual system of rule was established. A resident administrator of the Maharaja was appointed in the Poonch jagir and further officials were loaned from the state. The Raja's courts had jurisdiction only in petty cases. All serious crimes were referred to the courts in Srinagar. The Raja of Poonch lost his prestige and power. The Maharaja also imposed additional taxes to generate his own revenue from the jagir. They included taxes on cattle and sheep, export/import taxes on items like soap and silk, and imaginative taxes on wives and widows. A 'horse tax' required a payment of 50 percent of the purchase price of a horse. Evidently, these taxes generated considerable resentment. =Economy= Scholar Christopher Snedden states that, being a mountainous area, Poonch accorded small farms with poor soil, but had high costs of living. The Kashmiri tax burden made the situation worse. Many Poonchi men worked outside the jagir to alleviate the situation. They worked in Punjab, the railways, British Indian army and the British merchant navy in Bombay. The army was an especially important employer. It was said that every male Muslim in the jagir was, had been or would be a soldier in the British Indian army. During the World War I, 31,000 men from Jammu and Kashmir served in the army, a great majority of them from Poonch. During the World War II, over 60,000 men from Poonch served in the army, while the rest of the state contributed only about 10,000 men. The physical proximity of Poonch to the military recruiting grounds in Punjab, such as Sialkot and Rawalpindi, facilitated their enrolment. Poonchis enlisted as 'Punjabi Musalmans' and served in the Punjab Regiment. Division of Poonch Poonch district of Pakistan-administered Azad Kashmir (in green) in 1947 Poonch district in Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir; with Azad Kashmir territory to its left. After independence in 1947, there was a rebellion in the western part of the-then Poonch district. The rebels led by Sardar Muhammad Ibrahim Khan, sought support from the Dominion of Pakistan, which provided arms, and then launched an invasion of its own using Pashtun tribals. In response, the Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir joined India, and the conflict turned into an Indo-Pakistani War. When a ceasefire was effected, the Poonch district was split across the two countries. The former capital city, Poonch, came under the Indian Poonch district. A new capital at Rawalakot was eventually established by Pakistan in the Pakistani Poonch district.

He held a Licentiate in Decrees (i.e. Canon law) by July 1343, and by March 1348 was being styled Magister (\\"Master\\"), indicating completion a Master's degree, though the accuracy of this title is not certain because he is only styled \\"Master\\" on one occasion. Early career He is found as Archdeacon of Ross on 22 July 1343, a position he had probably held for many years previously; it is probable that he was helped into this position by the Bishop of Ross, Roger, also from the diocese of Dunblane.Dowden, Bishops, p. 215; Watt, Dictionary, p. 509; Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 285. On that date he was granted provision to a canonry in the diocese of Dunkeld with expectation of a prebend; on 27 March 1348, he claimed to hold a Dunkeld prebend, as he did on 22 June 1350. He was surrogated by Donnchadh de Strathearn, now Bishop of Dunkeld, to the prebend of Cruden in the diocese of Aberdeen on that date (22 March 1348), though it is not clear that this was ever effective; he was ordered to resign this right when given provision to the prebend and canonry of Kinnoir in the diocese of Moray on 2 June 1350.Watt, Dictionary, pp. 509, 523. Stewart probably spent the late 1340s at the papal court in Avignon. He was appointed as a papal chaplain on 6 August 1346. Stewart may have been in the service of Cardinal Guillaume de la Jug√©e, who is found aiding Stewart in 1348 and 1350. This influence probably explains his provision to the prebends mentioned above. On 18 May 1347 and 13 June 1350 he was named by three Scots as the mandatory for their papal graces. Bishop of Ross The ruins of Fortrose Cathedral on the Black Isle, the \\"seat\\" (cathedra) of the diocese of Ross. After the resignation of Bishop Roger, on 3 November 1350, Alexander Stewart was provided to the now vacant diocese of Ross; Bishop Roger, \\"for reasonable causes\\", had resigned the see at the papal curia through three proctors, and Stewart's presence at the papal court was fortuitous, as the pope had previous reserved the see for his own appointment.Dowden, Bishops, p. 215; Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 267. He promised his services on the same day as John de Rait, newly Bishop of Aberdeen, that is, on 26 January 1351. He was consecrated by 9 March, when he was granted permission to borrow money in order to pay for his expenses at Avignon.Watt, Dictionary, p. 509; Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 267. He is found in Scotland for the first time when, on 6 March 1352, he witnessed a charter of King David II of Scotland at Scone. He nevertheless continued his involvement in papal service, being mentioned as a mandatory in ten papal graces between March 1351 and July 1353; on 9 July 1364, he was instructed by the papacy to investigate alleged overcharging on the pilgrimage boat from Queensferry on the river Forth.Watt, Dictionary, pp. 509-10. His seal, along with that of other Scottish prelates, was appended to the obligation document drawn up for King David II's ransom at an assembly in Edinburgh on 26 September 1357.Dowden, Bishops, p. 215; Watt, Dictionary, p. 510. His seal was attached to an indenture at Auldearn on 2 January 1365; and to a deed drawn up at Perth on 16 October 1370. He was at the Scone parliament of 18 November 1358, at the Scone parliament of 26 July 1366.Watt, Dictionary, p. 510. He did not attend the Perth parliament of 27 September 1367, nor the Scone parliament of 6 March 1369. He attended the Council General at Perth on 13 January 1365. He witnessed many charters in or around Ross during his episcopate, but also various royal charters, including those issued at Scone on 18 November 1358. He witnessed a private deed by Andrew Leslie, another by Patrick Grant of Stratherrick, and two by Hugh de Ross, the brother of the earl of Ross, at Cullisse near Nigg. He witnessed several charters of the earl himself, Uilleam III, in the 1350s and 1360s, including ones at Delny on 5 March 1356, on 17 June 1357, on 12 November 1358, and another on 5 April 1366; he witnessed other comital charters at Dingwall, on 21 December 1366, on 9 August 1369, and on 4 February 1371. The last appearance is the latest appearance he made in any documentation. He may have been dead by the Scone parliament of 27 March 1371, to which he failed to appear.Dowden, Bishops, p. 215; Watt, Dictionary, p. 510; Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 267. He was definitely dead by 9 May, when his successor Alexander de Kylwos received papal provision to the now vacant diocese.Watt, Dictionary, pp. 315, 510; Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, pp. 267-8.

Windeyer was a member of the Women's Literary Society, which met in her family home, and its successor organisation, the Womanhood Suffrage League of New South Wales, of which her mother Mary was the founding president when it was established in 1891. After visiting the United States in 1893 as a commissioner to the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, where she represented the league at the World's Congress of Representative Women, she returned to Australia to help establish the National Council of Women of Australia. In 1899, Windeyer travelled to New York City to complete a two-year course at the New York State Library's librarian school. Although her previous employment applications for librarian work in Sydney had been rejected because she was a woman and deemed too young, after gaining experience in New York and becoming familiar with the Dewey Decimal Classification she was hired by the Public Library of New South Wales as a cataloguer upon her return in 1901; she was one of the first women to work at the library. Throughout her career, she was also involved in starting children's libraries in Sydney and children's reading rooms in regular public libraries. From 1907 to 1939, Windeyer was a council member of The Women's College at the University of Sydney. She was also involved in the Professional Women Workers' Association, the Kindergarten Union of New South Wales, the Parks and Playgrounds Movement, and the National Council of Women of Australia, which appointed her honorary life president in 1918 although she had never been a member of the council's executive board. Windeyer died on 11 August 1939 in Darlinghurst, an inner-Sydney suburb, following a brief illness.

The remains of this animal, consisting of at least 90 partial skeletons (mostly skulls), have been found in Germany. The name Archegosaurus was coined by Goldfuss in 1847. Archegosaurus is a member of Archegosauridae and is that family's type genus. Classification Restoration of A. decheni In 1938, paleontologist Margaret C. Steen described a temnospondyl from the Permian-age Ruprechtice assemblage in northeast Bohemia. Steen named it Memonomenos dyscriton on the basis of a skull that was narrower than others in the Ruprechtice. It was classified as an anthracosaur, a group closely related to reptiles. Both Memonomenos and embolomere anthracosaurs had vertebrae that were divided into several parts, including a pleurocentrum and intercentrum. Animals with this type of divided vertebrae were said to be rhachitomous. During the early twentieth century, paleontologists considered rhachitomous temnospondyls to be the descendants of embolomeres, and Steen considered Memonomenos to be a link between these two groups. Steen also noted that Memonomenos had large tabular horns, a feature shared with anthracosaurs. Temnospondyls and anthracosaurs were later found to be two distantly related groups, and paleontologist Alfred Romer placed Memonomenos within Anthracosauria. This placement was accepted until 1978 when Memonomenos was reassigned to the genus Archegosaurus and classified as a temnospondyl. Memonomenos dyscriton became a second species of Archegosaurus, A. dyscriton. Biology Water balance in Archegosaurus. Archegosaurus was a fully aquatic animal. A study regarding its metabolism, gas exchange, osmoregulation, and digestion suggest that it was rather similar to fish, rather than modern aquatic amphibians like salamanders.Florian Witzmann; Elizabeth Brainerd (2017). \\"Modeling the physiology of the aquatic temnospondyl Archegosaurus decheni from the early Permian of Germany\\".

It is the 87th entry in the series released by Columbia Pictures starring the comedians, who released 190 shorts for the studio between 1934 and 1959. Plot The trio are employed as handymen in a recording studio at the fictional radio station KGBY. Larry and Curly battle back and forth as they unhook a pipe to connect it to a radiator. Moe gets mad at the two of them, only to slip and fall down. While not doing their work, the trio watches a recording session through a window as Alice Van Doren (Christine McIntyre) sings \\"Voices of Spring\\". She is recording this song under a pseudonym (Miss Andrews) to audition for a radio show, an endeavor to which her father (Sam Flint) objects. After she finishes her song, the Stooges' boss (Fred Kelsey) comes into the room and sees them not working. He orders them to finish the job. Outside in the hallway, Larry and Curly accidentally hit Moe with two long pieces of pipe, leading to an argument. Their boss intervenes and as he's yelling at them, he's accidentally struck with the same pipes. The Stooges flee into an adjoining recording room with their boss on their heels. The room is occupied by a bad-tempered Italian baritone singer/violinist (Gino Corrado) and piano player in a session. During the battle with their boss, they end up destroying the singer's glasses and violin. They defeat their boss only to have the irate singer attack them, forcing them to run again into another room. Inside the room, which served as the recording room for Alice, they pretend to be recording a ridiculous soap commercial (with Moe portraying the voice of The Shadow radio narrator Bret Morrison), before finding Alice's record. Impressed by the operatic virtuosity of this stunningly beautiful soprano (Christine McIntyre was, in fact, a trained opera singer) Curly lip syncs, as the other stooges adorn him as a woman. Moe pretends to be playing a flute while Larry is \\"playing\\" the piano. Curly (in drag) is \\"heard\\" by the radio host Mrs. Bixby (Symona Boniface). Moe dubs Curly \\"Se√±orita Cucaracha,\\" and the trio are hired to sing professionally on the radio, but must also appear at the home of the radio show's sponsor for a party. The Stooges arrive at Mrs. Bixby's home and discover that the Italian baritone is also present. They proceed to sabotage his singing of \\"Vieni Sul Mar\\" by flipping cherries into his mouth, until he chokes on one and has to be slapped on the back. The team then has a brief quarrel prior to performing, resulting in Moe breaking the record over Curly's head. Ironically the quarrel was over protecting the demo record. Larry then eyes a collection of records, hastily selects the \\"Lucia Sextet,\\" and announces it as the \\"Six steps from Lucy\\". This song, however, requires pantomime by all three. This works well until the baritone recognizes them and unplugs the phonograph midway through the \\"Lucia Sextet\\", leaving the trio groaning out loud. They claim that Curly's voice is gone. Alice Van Doren is also present at the party, and catches onto the boys' scheme. She aids them by singing \\"Voices of Spring\\" from behind a curtain, with Larry playing the piano, and Moe playing the flute off key, as Curly once again mimes the lyrics, so her father would properly judge her performance without knowing it was his daughter singing. The Italian baritone is perplexed at Curly's ability and reacts by tossing a banana into Curly's mouth, revealing the trio as phonies. He pulls back the curtain hiding the real singer, and removes Curly's wig. Alice's father, however, sees that his daughter has genuine talent, and decides she should indeed pursue her singing career. As for the Stooges, they are pelted with records and fruits by the guests as they make a quick exit from the party. Production notes Micro-Phonies was filmed on June 4‚Äì7, 1945, several months after Curly Howard suffered a mild stroke.Micro-Phonies threestooges.net His performances were marred by slurred speech and slower timing. Though Micro-Phonies was the first film released that was directed by novice director Edward Bernds, it was not his first attempt (that honor goes to the lackluster A Bird in the Head). Understandably, Bernds was excited at his big chance to direct, but was shocked when he saw how ill Curly had become. Years later, Bernds discussed his trying experience during the filming of A Bird in the Head: Bernds feared that his directing days would be over as soon as they began if A Bird in the Head (featuring a sluggish Curly) was released as his first effort. Producer Hugh McCollum acted quickly, and reshuffled the release order of the films Bernds had directed (Bernds had already completed Micro-Phonies and The Three Troubledoers in addition to A Bird in the Head). As a result, the superior Micro-Phonies (in which Curly was in much better form) was released first, securing Bernds' directing position. Bernds would forever be indebted to McCollum for this act of kindness; henceforth, McCollum produced all of Bernds' Stooge films. Bernds later recalled how Curly's condition was inconsistent: Footage was reused in the 1960 compilation feature film Stop! Look! and Laugh!

History When General William Henry Harrison took an army from Vincennes to the Battle of Tippecanoe in late 1811, Zachariah Cicott served as a scout. Cicott was familiar with the area because of his time trading up and down the Wabash River starting circa 1801. The trail taken by Harrison's army passed through the area that later became Parke County on its way to and from the battle site in Tippecanoe County.

Owned and operated by Motorola Solutions, the State of Illinois is a major partner in the system. It is used by all Illinois State Police posts as well as the Illinois State Toll Highway Authority (ISTHA) Maintenance and Police divisions. Users Any public safety agency in the State of Illinois may apply to use the system. Most agencies would pay $53.00 per radio per month to operate on the system in addition to the cost of the radios. Those agencies with resources to share for the system, such as licensed radio channels or desirable tower space, may negotiate different costs with Motorola. Various grants and funding sources have allowed StarCom21 radios to be installed at many locations and provided to many agencies for mutual aid purposes. These include radios offered to every police, fire, rescue and EMA agency in the State, hospitals, central dispatch centers, State and other colleges and universities and others. StarCom21 Customer Users (those who pay a fee to use Motorola owned infrastructure) include the Illinois State Police (21 posts) as well as other state agencies and: *McLean County (and several local agencies dispatched by McLean's 9-1-1 system) *The Illinois State Toll Highway Authority * Boone County/ Belvedere * Rockford PD *Macon County and Decatur PD * Madison and Clinton Counties (and several agencies in these counties) * Plainfield PD * Sangamon County Sheriff and Springfield Police Department. Dispatched By Sangamon County Central Dispatch System SCCDS *Ameren, a large utility company that operates in much of Illinois, is now also using StarCom21. Ameren had operated several networked trunked systems for its operations, these frequencies have largely been turned over to StarCom21 for general subscriber use. Since the 700 MHz band is restricted to Public Safety users, Ameren can only use the 800 MHz channels, so some sites that previously only had 700 MHz channels have had 800 MHz channels added to allow Ameren access. This has allowed StarCom21 access to additional radio channels and tower sites. Several other agencies and localities have expressed interest in or tried the system. StarCom21 Partner Users (Those who own their own compatible infrastructure under the same System ID and have roaming agreements for StarCom21) include: *St. Clair County *McHenry County *Cook County (Most operations are encrypted) StarCom21 Affiliated Systems (Those who own similar infrastructure under a separate System ID) include: * Champaign County The so- called Affiliated Systems include the same type of technology, and system parameters (Talkgroup and user ID's etc.) are coordinated with StarCom21 to allow roaming and interoperability. Several other agencies are considering building or upgrading to similar or compatible systems to allow roaming on the various systems. Those making these considerations include Cook County, DuPage County and others. Technical StarCom21 uses about 186 radio towers throughout the state of Illinois, many owned by state agencies. It uses radio channels in the 700 and 800 MHz bands, all licensed to the State of Illinois. It uses APCO-25 9600 baud control channel frequencies and APCO-25 digital modulation. Trunked Radio Using the trunked radio system technology that shares and reuses radio channels, the system is capable of handling thousands of individual Talkgroups and radio ID's. Since most radios are only transmitting a small percentage of the time, the channels are shared among many users. The same radio frequency may be used at many sites throughout the state. Of the many individual tower sites there are simulcast groups covering the Chicago, St. Louis, Peoria and Rockford metro areas. These simulcast sites allow for better coverage over a large area by transmitting the same conversation on the same frequencies at each tower in the simulcast site.

She was used by the Union Navy as a gunboat to patrol navigable waterways of the Confederacy to prevent the South from trading with other countries.  Purchased at Philadelphia in 1861  Samuel Rotan, a wooden, center-board schooner, was purchased by the Navy at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on 21 September 1861, was fitted out as a gunboat at the Philadelphia Navy Yard; and commissioned there on 12 November 1861, Acting Master John A. Rogers in command.  Civil War service  = Assigned to the Gulf Blockading Squadron = Assigned to the Gulf Blockading Squadron, the schooner arrived off Fort Pickens, Florida, on 16 December 1861. After a reconnaissance voyage to the Texas coast, she performed blockade duty off the Mississippi River passes; and, on 23 January 1862, captured Confederate privateer, Calhoun, in East Bay, formed by the Southwest-Pass and Grand-Pass fingers of the Mississippi delta. The prize had been attempting to slip into the Southwest Pass laden with over 25 tons of gunpowder, rifles, chemicals, coffee, and other assorted cargo needed by the Confederacy. Since Calhoun was not deemed able to make the voyage north during the stormy winter months, her papers and cargo were transferred to Samuel Rotan which sailed from Ship Island, Mississippi, in mid-February and carried them north for adjudication in the Philadelphia Prize Court. = Reassigned to the East Gulf Blockading Squadron = Meanwhile, on 20 January 1862, Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles, on splitting naval jurisdiction in the Gulf of Mexico between Flag Officers McKean and David Farragut, had given Samuel Rotan to the former for service in the East Gulf Blockading Squadron. The schooner joined her squadron at Key West, Florida, in April and, into the autumn, blockaded the Florida coast, primarily off St. Andrews Bay. Badly in need of repairs, she sailed north in November for work in the Philadelphia Navy Yard. = North Atlantic Blockade duty = In January 1863, Samuel Rotan joined the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron and was ordered to the York River for blockade duty. On the morning of 24 April, she and captured schooners, Martha Ann and A. Carson, off Horn Harbor. On 2 July, she took 35-ton schooner, Champion, off the mouth of the Piankatank River. On the 27th, her picket boat seized a canoe which had run the blockade from the Severn River, Virginia, laden with corn, chickens, and eggs. On 10 October, her picket boat chased a yawl standing up the beach of Horn Harbor, Virginia. Its occupants jumped overboard and fled to the beach. Then the Southerners fired upon the Union sailors who came up and took possession of the little prize and its cargo of salt. Soon thereafter, the schooner's need for repairs became serious, and she proceeded to the Norfolk Navy Yard for the work. Late in January 1864, she was back on blockade duty off the west coast of Chesapeake Bay, and she continued this duty into the autumn. Then she was transferred to the James River to help support General U.S. Grant's operations against Richmond, Virginia. Early in December 1864, she was back off the York River and served in that area into the spring of 1865.  End-of-war decommissioning and sale  In April, she sailed north for inactivation; and she was decommissioned at the New York Navy Yard on 10 June 1865. The schooner was sold there on 15 August 1865 to a Mr. Stannard.

Its objective, outlined in the editorial to the first edition,\\"Matters that Matter\\", Energy Matters Issue no.1, Michaelmas 1980, p.3, Cambridge University Library was to provide facts, details and opinions relating to energy, in a way accessible to interested students. \\"Energy Matters\\" was notable in a number ways. Its dispassionate and technical approach to this controversial topic was possibly unprecedented at a British University, at a time when many student publications were highly partisan on the issue. It was an independent undergraduate student magazine wholly funded (initially) by a University department, an unusual and possibly unique arrangement in the UK. It received endorsement from the British Royal Family, a significant and unusual gesture at the time for a magazine dealing with political matters. It was where a number of subsequently famous journalists and academics showed their first public work. The magazine was founded at a time of high public interest in energy issues, due to the second oil crisis and the Three Mile Island accident the previous year, and to a wave of public interest in energy conservation stimulated by environmental concerns. The topic had become highly political; for example a debate took place in the Cambridge Union Society (the University's debating club) in November 1980 under the title \\"This House Believes Britain's Dependence on Nuclear Power will Result in Disaster\\", opposed by Bernard Jenkin.Stop Press with Varsity, 7 November 1980, Cambridge University Library In this context, the magazine was founded by two undergraduates at the Cambridge University Engineering Department, Richard Davies and Andrew Bud. They secured funding from the Engineering Department which agreed to supply materials and printing services. The first edition ran to 52 pages, and 500 copies were distributed free throughout the University immediately after the Union Society debate. Thanks to the support of one of the Department's professors, Sir William Hawthorne, an expert in energy conservation, the magazine carried an introduction specially provided by the Duke of Edinburgh (see image). The magazine was well received and a team of volunteer student journalists created the second edition, published in April 1981, catalogued as .Energy Matters Issue no.2, Lent/Easter 1981, Cambridge University Library This ran to 100 pages, and the printing of 1000 copies entirely blocked the Engineering Department's reprographic department for three weeks, driving the in-house printer to the edge of despair. Regretfully, the Department withdrew its logistical support.\\"The Cinderella Syndrome\\", Energy Matters Issue no.2 Lent/Easter 1981 p.4, Cambridge University Library As a result, commercial sponsorship was sought and successfully raised from the energy industry. Funding came from the oil industry, the electricity and nuclear sectors and several University departments,\\"Acknowledgements\\", Energy Matters Issue no.3 Michaelmas 1981 p.2, Cambridge University Library and the magazine was commercially printed. Under new editors Helen Field and Anne Pudsey-Dawson, the third edition appeared in November 1981. Although interest in the magazine amongst students beyond the science and engineering faculties was limited, it attracted considerable attention in Whitehall and within the industry. Dozens of copies were requested by these institutions. As a result, the magazine's editors were able to secure interviews with cabinet ministers \\"On the Energy Tightrope: an interview with Secretary of State David Howell\\" Energy Matters Issue no.2 Lent/Easter 1981 p.56, Cambridge University Library\\"Merlyn Rees on Energy\\" Energy Matters Issue no.4 Easter 1982 p.31, Cambridge University Library and heads of the nationalised energy industries and trades unions.\\"King Arthur : an interview with Arthur Scargill\\" Energy Matters Issue no.4 Easter 1982 p.5, Cambridge University Library\\"Decisions, Decisions: An interview with Glyn England, Chairman of the CEGB\\" Energy Matters Issue no.6 Easter 1983 p.41, Cambridge University Library As a spin- off, a number of branded seminars were organised at the University, featuring leaders of the energy industry.\\"Can Big be Beautiful: a report on an Energy Matters Seminar\\" Energy Matters Issue no.4 Easter 1982 p.19, Cambridge University Library The magazine's editorial line was rigorously neutral, and substantial space was given to the thoughts of leading anti-nuclear campaigners, proponents of conservation and evangelists of combined heat and power. By 1984, the magazine's editor Roger Tredre merged it with the activities of the Cambridge student magazine Cantab, and its main function became to generate advertising revenue to cross-subsidise Cantab.Cantab references to Energy Matters It ceased publication after its seventh edition in summer 1984, its final editors being Richard Penty (now Professor of Photonics at the University of Cambridge) and John Crowther. Amongst those who worked on the magazine a number subsequently became influential in the fields of journalism or energy policy. The 1983 edition was edited by Vanessa Houlder (currently a leading business journalist on the Financial Times of London), and included contributions from Mike Grubb (now a senior academic working for the Carbon Trust).\\"Contents\\" Energy Matters Issue no.6 Easter 1983 p.1, Cambridge University Library References External links * Catalogue entry at the British Library Category:Student magazines published in the United Kingdom Category:Magazines established in 1980 Category:Magazines disestablished in 1984 Category:Publications associated with the University of Cambridge Category:Defunct magazines published in the United Kingdom Category:Energy magazines Category:Mass media in Cambridge ","title":"Energy Matters"},{"id":"13702074","text":"Herbert Dreilich (December 5, 1942 ‚Äì December 12, 2004) was a German-language rock musician. He was an early pioneer in, and an important contributor to, German-language Rock music. An accomplished singer, songwriter, and acoustic guitarist, he was best known as lead singer for the group Karat. Biography Dreilich was born in 1942 in Mauterndorf, Austria, which at that time was a part of Nazi Germany. As a child he moved with his family to Great Britain, and then to West Germany. He moved again in 1959 with his family to Halle, East Germany (the German Democratic Republic). There he completed school in 1961, and worked as a retail store decorator. Dreilich began to play acoustic guitar in 1960 at an amateur level with the group Jazz Youngsters in Halle. From 1962 to 1964, he played with Reinhard Lakomy, and from 1967 to 1968 with The Music Stromers. These experiences led him to attend the Music School of Berlin-Friedrichshain (in then East Berlin) from 1967 to 1971. During this course of study, he played with the Henry-Kotowski-Quintett and The Puhdys from 1968 to 1969, and with The Alexanders from 1969 to 1971. After graduating in 1971, he became a professional member of the jazz-rock fusion group Panta Rhei, which he was with until it dissolved in 1975. At that time he and two other members left to found Karat, a group he remained with until his death in 2004. From 1977-on, he was the lead singer for Karat, always recording in the German language.:de:Herbert Dreilich With Karat's distinctive style of progressive rock, in 1978 Dreilich and his bandmates won the Grand Prize of the International Schlager Festival in Dresden, and toured to West Berlin. Karat gained quickly in popularity, resulting in an audience across the border in West Germany, and even in many other countries of both Eastern and Western Europe. Karat received two West German gold records: one for Der blaue Planet (The Blue Planet) in 1982 and one for Albatros (Albatross) in 1984. That year, Karat was also awarded the National Prize of the GDR for Arts and Literature, and appeared on the popular West German television show Wetten, dass..?. In 1986, Dreilich was also involved in the short-lived East German supergroup the Gitarreros, where he performed together with Tamara Danz of the band Silly, Toni Krahl of the band City, and Mike Kilian of the band Rockhaus. That year his band Karat received the Goldene Europa, West German television's oldest award. By the end of the 1980s, Karat had lost all of its other founding members, and also a degree of its popularity. It carried on after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 with Dreilich as bandleader, finding new inspiration in more western-oriented pop rock styles. To Dreilich's disappointment, over the following years Karat was regarded by many as a relic of the former GDR. Yet, as a foremost representative of Ostrock, the band did maintain a dedicated core fan base among eastern Germans.Karat (band) Dreilich worked to broaden Karat's live tours to the former West German states of the Federal Republic, as well as to Switzerland and Austria, partly through touring and recording with artists from those areas. The band returned to its progressive rock roots in the mid-1990s, and was making something of a comeback, when in October 1997, Dreilich collapsed on-stage in Magdeburg of a stroke. He survived the event, but became largely incapacitated and afterward experienced a series of physical problems. In August 2003 he was diagnosed with liver cancer and ceased to tour. In the night of December 11‚Äì12, 2004 he died of cancer, at the age of 62. A burial was held on December 15, 2004 in Berlin- Biesdorf, attended by a large gathering, among them many prominent musical colleagues from Germany and other countries. Herbert Dreilich was married three times, and had one son and one daughter. In 2005, his son Claudius Dreilich took his place as lead singer for Karat.:de:Herbert Dreilich Discography * 1973 Panta Rhei * 1978 Karat (Carat) * 1979 √úber sieben Br√ºcken (Across Seven Bridges) * 1979 Albatros (Albatross) ‚Äî West German debut album, compiling first two East German albums * 1980 Schwanenk√∂nig (Swan-King) * 1982 Der blaue Planet (The Blue Planet) * 1983 Die sieben Wunder der Welt (The Seven Wonders of the World) * 1985 10 Jahre Karat ‚Äì Auf dem Weg zu Euch ‚Äì Live (10 Years of Karat ‚Äì Coming at You ‚Äì Live) ‚Äî Live album * 1986 It's Only Rock¬¥n¬¥ Roll ‚Äì Die Gitarreros live im Konzert (It's Only Rock¬¥n¬¥ Roll ‚Äì The Gitarreros Live in Conzert) * 1987 F√ºnfte Jahreszeit (Fifth Season) * 1990 ... im n√§chsten Frieden (...in The Next Peace) * 1991 Karat (Carat) * 1995 Die geschenkte Stunde (The Given Hour) * 1997 Balance (Balance) * 2000 Ich liebe jede Stunde (I Love Every Hour) ‚Äî Compilation album * 2001 25 Jahre Karat ‚Äì Das Konzert (25 Years of Karat ‚Äì The Concert) ‚Äî Live album * 2003 Licht und Schatten (Light and Shadow) * 2005 30 Jahre Karat (30 Years of Karat) ‚Äî Compilation album * 2010 Ich liebe jede Stunde Jubil√§ums-Edition (\\"I Love Every Hour Jubilee Edition\\") ‚Äî 14-CD Box set containing all released albums remastered and a CD of rarities.

He went to Constantinople, was persuaded to embrace Christianity, apparently by Archbishop Atticus of Constantinople, and then returned to Alexandria.Socrates, l.c. Adamantius is the author of a Greek treatise on physiognomy () in two books. It is still extant, and borrows in a great measure (as Adamantius himself confesses) from Polemon's work on the same subject. It is dedicated to \\"Constantius\\", who is supposed by Fabricius to be the same Constantius who married Placidia (i.e. Constantius III), the daughter of Theodosius the Great, and who reigned for seven months in conjunction with the Emperor Honorius.Fabricius, Johann Albert, Biblioth.

The repressions were an extension of the Stalinist purges (also known as the Great Purge) unfolding across the Soviet Union around the same time. Soviet NKVD advisors, under the nominal direction of Mongolia's de facto leader Khorloogiin Choibalsan, persecuted thousands of individuals and organizations perceived as threats to the Mongolian revolution and the growing Soviet influence in the country. As in the Soviet Union, methods of repression included torture, show trials, executions, and imprisonment in remote forced labor camps, often in Soviet gulags. Estimates differ, but anywhere between 20,000 and 35,000 \\"enemies of the revolution\\" were executed, a figure representing three to five percent of Mongolia's total population at the time. Victims included those accused of espousing Tibetan Buddhism, pan-Mongolist nationalism, and pro-Japanese sentiment. Buddhist clergy, aristocrats, intelligentsia, political dissidents, and ethnic Buryats and Kazakhs suffered the greatest losses. Background = Prelude: 1921‚Äì1934 = Following the Mongolian Revolution of 1921, infighting within the ruling Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party (MPRP) resulted in several waves of violent political purges, often instigated and aided by Comintern or Soviet agents and government advisors. In August 1922, Dogsomyn Bodoo, the first prime minister of the revolutionary period, and 14 others were executed without trial after confessing under torture by Soviet agents to conspiring to overthrow the government. Two years later Bodoo's chief accuser, Soliin Danzan, was executed during the Third Party Congress for representing \\"bourgeois interests\\". In 1928, several prominent MPRP members including Ajvaagiin Danzan, Jamsrangiin Tseveen, Tseren-Ochiryn Dambadorj, and Navaandorjiin Jadambaa, were imprisoned or exiled in a widescale purge of suspected rightwingers as the country launched its \\"Leftist Period\\" of more rapid collectivization, land expropriation, and persecution of the Buddhist Church. After those drastic measures resulted in popular uprisings throughout the country in 1932, several of the MPRP's most hard-line leftists including Zolbingiin Shijee, √ñlziin Badrakh, and Prime Minister Tsengeltiin Jigjidjav were blamed, officially expelled from the party, and later executed during the Great Repression. Khorloogiin Choibalsan in 1930s In 1933‚Äì34, in what is viewed as a dress rehearsal for the repressions of 1937‚Äì1939, MPRP General Secretary Jambyn Lkh√ºmbe and other MPRP elements, particularly Buryat-Mongols, were falsely accused of conspiring with Japanese spies. Over 1,500 people were implicated and 56 were executed. The public hysteria surrounding the Lkh√ºmbe Affair was spurred in part by Japan's invasion of neighboring Manchuria in 1931. To defend against possible Japanese military expansion into the Soviet Far East, Stalin sought to stabilize Mongolia politically by eliminating opposition to the Soviet backed government and securing an agreement to permit the stationing of Red Army troops in the country. = The purge of Genden = Weary of growing Soviet domination, Mongolia's then prime minister Peljidiin Genden worked to postpone both a 1934 bilateral Gentlemen's Agreement in which the USSR promised Soviet protection of Mongolia and the 1936 \\"Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation\\" that allowed Soviet troops to be stationed in the country. Genden likewise balked at Stalin's recommendation that he elevate Mongolia's internal affairs committee, 26 percent of whose staff were NKVD agents, to a fully independent ministry and that he enlarge Mongolia's military. Finally, he resisted Moscow's pressure to exterminate more than 100,000 of the country's lamas, which Stalin called \\"the enemies within\\". Frustrated by Genden's obstinacy, Stalin backed the promotion of Khorloogiin Choibalsan as co-Marshal of Mongolia's armed forces and head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. In March 1936, Choibalsan orchestrated Genden's removal from office for sabotaging Mongol‚ÄìSoviet relations. Genden was arrested and sent to Moscow, where he was executed a year later. Although the popular but politically feeble Anandyn Amar became Prime Minister, Choibalsan became the de facto most powerful person in the country.  The Great Repression  Over the next three years, Soviet mentors in the Ministry of Internal Affairs guided Choibalsan in planning and carrying out the impending purges. Under the direction of his Soviet handler Chopyak, Choibalsan had Internal Affairs Committee rules amended in May 1936 to facilitate the detention of high ranking politicians without first consulting political superiors. Soon thereafter, 23 high ranking lamas were arrested for participating in a \\"counter revolutionary center.\\" Following a yearlong trial they were publicly executed in early October 1937. When Mongolia's Procurator General protested the lamas' prosecution, he too was arrested and then shot.Baabar 1999, p. 355 Frinovsky In August 1937, the 36-year-old Marshal Gelegdorjiin Demid, whose popularity Choibalsan had always resented, died under suspicious circumstances resulting in Choibalsan's promotion to the dual role of sole Commander-in- Chief of the Mongolian military and Minister of Defense. The following day Choibalsan, as Interior Minister, issued Order 366 which declared that many in Mongolia \\"had fallen under the influence of Japanese spies and provocateurs.\\" That same month Stalin, alarmed by Japanese military movements in ManchuriaBaabar 1999, p. 359 ordered the stationing of 30,000 Red Army troops in Mongolia and had dispatched a large Soviet delegation to Ulaanbaatar under Soviet Deputy NKVD Commissar Mikhail Frinovsky. Frinovsky, charged with setting in motion the violent purges that he had so effectively carried out in the Soviet Union under NKVD Chief Nikolai Yezhov, delivered a list of 115 counterrevolutionaries and Japanese collaborators to Choibalsan, recommending they be purged. Working through Soviet advisers already embedded within the Ministry of Interior and with a compliant Choibalsan providing symbolic cover, Frinovsky built the purge framework from behind the scenes; producing arrest lists and assembling an Extraordinary Purge Commission, an NKVD style troika (headed by Choibalsan, with Minister of Justice Tserendorj and former MPRP Secretary Dorjjavyn Luvsansharav) that presided over arrest cases, investigations, and show trials involving ‚Äúlamas, espionage and counterrevolution.‚Äù The arrest of 65 high ranking government officials and intelligentsia on the night of Sept 10, 1937 signaled the launch of the purges in earnest. All were accused of spying for Japan as part of a Genden-Demid plot and most confessed under intense torture.Baabar 1999, p. 361: quoting N. Erdene-Ochir, \\"Extra-Special Commission\\", Ardyn Erh, No. 153, 1991 The first show trial was staged at Ulaanbaatar's Central Theater from 18 to 20 October 1937. Of the 14 persons accused, 13, including former prime minister (1921) and chief abbot of the Manzushir Monastery Sambadondogiin Tserendorj, were sentenced to death.Baabar 1999, p. 361Luvsansharav, member of the Extraordinary Purge CommissionWhat followed was a spasm of violence that lasted nearly 18 months. Choibalsan's troika approved and carried out the execution of over 18,000 counterrevolutionary lamas. Monks that were not executed were conscripted into the Mongolian armed forces or otherwise forcibly laicized while 746 of the country's monasteries were liquidated. Thousands more dissident intellectuals, political and government officials labeled \\"enemies of the revolution,\\" as well as ethnic Buryats and Kazakhs were also rounded up and killed. Some 25 persons from top positions in the party and government were executed, 187 from the military leadership, 36 of the 51 members of the Central Committee.Baabar 1999, p. 362 Following the Russian model, Choibalsan opened gulags in the countryside to imprison dissidents, while others were transported to gulags in the USSR. As the NKVD effectively managed the purge by staging show trials and carrying out executions,Baabar 1999, p. 358 a frequently intoxicatedBecker 1992, p. 95 Choibalsan was sometimes present during torture and interrogations of suspected counterrevolutionaries, including old friends and comrades. Choibalsan rubber-stamped NKVD execution orders and at times personally directed executions. He also added names of political enemies to NKVD arrest lists simply to settle old scores. Nevertheless, even when he attempted to spare victims by recommending leniency in certain cases, NKVD officers often overrode his decision. =End of the Great Repression= Racked with stress, Choibalsan spent six months (August 1938 ‚Äì January 1939) recuperating and consulting with Kliment Voroshilov, Nikolai Yezhov, and Stalin in Moscow and SochiBaabar 1999, p. 365 while NKVD agents and Interior Ministry officials carried on purge operations from Ulaanbaatar. When he returned to Mongolia, Choibalsan followed Soviet directives and had the highly popular Prime Minister Amar purged. Choibalsan claimed he \\"had helped anti-government plotters, opposed their arrest, and neglected the defense of the borders. He betrayed his own country and was a traitor to the revolution.\\" After a coordinated propaganda campaign, Amar was arrested on 7 March 1939 and sent to the USSR, where he was later tried by a Soviet Troika and executed. With Amar's removal, Choibalsan became Mongolia's uncontested leader, simultaneously holding the office Prime Minister, Minister for Internal Affairs, Minister of War, and Commander in Chief of the Mongolian armed forces. Secured in his position, Choibalsan brought the terror to an end in April 1939 by declaring that the excesses of the purges had been conducted by overzealous party officials while he was away in the USSR, but that he had overseen the arrests of the real criminals. Official blame for the purges fell on the deputy minister of internal affairs Nasantogtoh, and his former Soviet handler Kichikov. Later, other henchmen of the purge were arrested and executed, including Luvsansharav, Bayasgalan, Dashtseveg, and Luvsandorj. Dansranbilegiin Dogsom and Darizavyn Losol, the last two living members (besides Choibalsan himself) of the original seven founding members of the MPRP, were also arrested.Baabar 1999, p. 370 Dogsom was executed in 1941. Losol died in a Soviet prison before his case came to trial.  Legacy  Choibalsan's statue stands in front of the National University in Ulaanbaatar By the time the purges ended in early 1939, an entire stratum of Mongolian society had effectively been exterminated while much of Mongolia's cultural heritage lay in ruins. Approximately 18,000 lamas were condemned to death while thousands more were forcibly laicized and conscripted into the Mongolian army. More than 700 Buddhist monasteries were destroyed. The old guard revolutionary class, viewed as heavily nationalist, was eliminated; twenty five persons from top positions in the party and government were executed (including former prime ministers Peljidiin Genden and Anandyn Amar), 187 from the military leadership, and 36 of the 51 members of the Central Committee. Choibalsan became Mongolia's unquestioned leader backed by Soviet advisors, a growing Red Army presence in the country, and by younger apparatchiks who were more closely aligned with the Soviet Union, such as future leader Yumjaagiin Tsedenbal. In the 50 years following the repressions, any public discourse on the matter was discouraged or condemned.Kenneth Christie, Robert Cribb, Robert B. Cribb 2002, pg 161 At the time of his death in 1952, Choibalsan was widely mourned as a hero, a patriot, and ultimately a martyr for the cause of Mongolian independence. Remnants of his strong personality cult, as well as successful efforts by his successor Tsendenbal to obstruct \\"de-Stalinization\\" efforts that could have shed light on the purges, helped solidify the positive regard many Mongolians held of their former leader. Some scholars have suggested the inclination of Mongolians to avoid blaming Choibalsan for the purges is in effect an attempt to exonerate themselves for what happened.Kenneth Christie, Robert Cribb, Robert B. Cribb 2002, pg 162 Public anger over the violence of the purges falls predominantly on the Soviet Union and the NKVD, with Choibalsan viewed sympathetically (if not pathetically) as a puppet with little choice but to follow Moscow's instructions or else meet the fate of his predecessors Genden and Amar. With the end of socialist rule in 1990, however, re-examination of the Socialist Era, and particularly the Great Repression, has occurred and there does seem to be an attempt by some Mongolians to come to terms the country's past in a more general context. In 1991 mass graves of monks executed during the repressions were uncovered near M√∂r√∂n,Mass Buddhist Grave Reported in Mongolia The New York Times, October 1991 and in 2003 in Ulaanbaatar.Mass grave uncovered in Mongolia RT√â News, Thursday, 12 June 2003 The corpses of hundreds of executed lamas and civilians were unearthed, all killed with a single shot to the base of the skull. At the same time, there have been concerted efforts by various groups to restore many of the temples and monasteries that were destroyed during the purges.

The church is located in the business district of Rialto. Originally, in the 12th century, it was under the jurisdiction of the Patriarch of Grado. After rebuilding, it was reconsecrated in 1422, and in 1485 it merged with the Oratory of Santa Maria dei Patriarchi e di Ognissanti. After a partial collapse in 1820, the church was entirely rebuilt from 1837, being reconsecrated in 1850, to designs by Giovanni Meduna. The facade is modern, and was completed in 1909 by Giuseppe Sicher. The Baroque ceiling has paintings by Ludovico Dorigny. The altars were designed in the 19th century by Santi and decorated by the sculptor Giovanni Antonio Dorigo. The interior has four Renaissance panels, and a Baptism of Christ by Tintoretto. The Adoration of the Magi by Paolo Veronese is a large oil painting on canvas painted for the church in 1573 which has been in the National Gallery, London since the church sold it in 1855, presumably to finance the rebuilding.Penny, 401, 405-406 The painting was commissioned by the confraternity of Saint Joseph, the Scuola di San Giuseppe, and placed beside their altar on the left hand wall of the nave. They were not one of the very wealthy Scuole Grandi of Venice, nor trade-based like others with altars in the church, but essentially devotional, and they included female members.Penny, 401 The church had a number of significant paintings, and the Veronese was next to the altar of St Joseph on the left side wall, which in the next century was given an altarpiece by Johann Carl Loth of the unusual subject of Joseph presenting the newborn Jesus to God the Father, which remains in the church. The Veronese had some fame, being singled out for mention in early guide books such as Giovanni Stringa's 1604 revision of Francesco Sansovino's Venetia. In 1670 agents of the new Cosimo III de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, who had failed to persuade the convent of Saint Catherine to sell Veronese's Mystical Marriage of St Catherine of 1575 (now Gallerie dell'Accademia), turned to San Silvestro and attempted to bribe every member of the confraternity to sell the work, but failed after two years.Penny, xxi Chiesa di San Silvestro (Venezia) Campanile in campo.jpgCampanile and church (West exposure).

He studied ophthalmology under Edmund Hansen Grut (1831-1907) in Copenhagen, later becoming an adjunct director at the ophthalmological laboratory at the Sorbonne in Paris. Tscherning spent 25 years at the Sorbonne, where he worked closely with Louis √âmile Javal (1839-1907). In 1910 he returned to Denmark as a professor at the University of Copenhagen and head of the ophthalmic department at the Rigshospitalet.Salmonsens konversationsleksikon (biography) Tscherning is remembered for contributions made in optical physiology. He conducted research of entoptic phenomenon, Purkinje images, the etiology of myopia, and Listing's law of ocular movement. He also designed an ophthalmophacometer, a device used to measure changes that happen in the front and back curvatures of the lens during accommodation. He is probably best known for his theory regarding the mechanism of accommodation, of which he disagreed with the accommodation theory proposed by Hermann von Helmholtz (1821-1894). Tscherning believed that accommodation occurred through an increase of zonular pressure at the lens equator with contraction of the ciliary muscle, and therefore a bulging of the lens in accommodation was created by compression rather than by passive dilatation. Furthermore, he stated that during accommodation, while the central part of the anterior surface of the lens is bulged, the peripheral portion of the lens is flattened.Oculo-refractive Cyclopedia and Dictionary by Thomas George Atkinson Tscherning was the author of over 100 scientific articles, including a book titled Optique physiologique, published in 1898 in Paris by Garr√© and Naud, and was later translated into English (Physiologic optics), and Hermann von Helmholtz et la Th√©orie de l¬¥Accommodation, Paris 1909 Octave Doin, (\\"Hermann von Helmholtz and the Theory of Accommodation\\") which was critical to Helmholtz's work on the same subject, published in the Graefe's Archiv (volume 1, 1854).

History  Pierre Menard was born near Montreal, Quebec on October 7, 1766. The third of ten children, Menard sought to make his fortune by trading furs in what was then \\"Illinois Country\\". Leaving his home in Canada with two of his brothers at approximately the age of 15, he worked for Francois Vigo of Vincennes, IN as a clerk moving to Kaskaskia in March of 1790. Having become a successful businessman by the age of thirty, Menard went on to become a successful U.S. political figure, eventually becoming the first lieutenant governor of Illinois, after having served as the presiding officer of the Illinois Territorial Legislature.http://www.state.il.us/hpa/hs/pierre_menard.htm Despite his various political accolades, including delegate to the Indiana Territorial Legislature, regimental Major, and being one of the select few chosen to help draft Illinois' first constitution, Pierre Menard is still remembered to this day for his good-natured will and for his generosity towards the poor. The land was purchased sometime in 1802 according to records and family and the house itself construction began sometime later that year. It is an illustration of the Southern French Colonial (sometimes referred to as \\"Creole\\") and has various features which highlight this, including its beautiful Gallery (porch). The house is located within only a few hundred yards of the Mississippi River which during Pierre's time would have been the Kaskaskia River. Due to the annual flooding and erosion, the rest of the original town of Kaskaskia, Illinois' first capital, has been washed away. The Pierre Menard House now stands as the only testament to where the first state capital once stood in its original place. Preserved by the state as the Pierre Menard Home State Historic Site, it contains a museum which includes audio- visual program. The museum is devoted to the Menard family, as well as local history, and is governed by the Illinois Department of Natural Resources. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places and designated a National Historic Landmark in 1970, and it was named one of the contributing properties to the new French Colonial Historic District in 1974, along with other area French-influenced sites such as Fort de Chartres, the Creole House, the Kolmer Site (a former Indian village), and the site of Fort Kaskaskia.Brown, Margaret K.

It is located within Markham Centre and Unionville and is proposed to serve as the heart of Markham. Businesses in the district are expected to employ as many as 16,000 individuals, and it may house as many as 10,000 residents. The development will have a high density of residential, retail, commercial and mixed-use structures. The community is being developed, built and wholly financed by The Remington Group Inc. Description Downtown Markham is a planned urban hub and the largest planned mixed-use development in Canada. The development spans 243 acres and is situated in one of the fastest growing regions in the province. It will be the commercial & financial district within Unionville at the center of the city of Markham, and will consist of a mix of residential, office and retail uses. Two million square feet of retail space will include international retailers, local shops, restaurants and entertainment venues. Downtown Markham will also offer more than 3.4 million square feet of office space in a commercial district adjacent to Highway 407. The vibrant urban centre is being designed and developed following sustainable guidelines, including energy efficient power sources and LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certified residential and commercial projects. Aside from allowing greater density, the development also enjoys 72 acres of natural and landscaped green space, improved walkability and easy access to public transit, including Viva Rapid Transit and GO Transit. Downtown Markham refers to an area south of Uptown Markham / Highway 7, west of Kennedy Road / Main Street Unionville, east of Warden Avenue, and north of Highway 407 ETR. On the other hand, Markham Centre or Unionville refers to a broader area. Markham Centre is bounded north to Apple Creek Boulevard / Carlton Road, east to Kennedy Road, west to Rodick Road, and south to 14th Avenue. History Townhouses in Downtown Markham The Cineplex new theatre just built. Downtown Markham construction site in 2020. The current City of Markham was created in 1971 when the former town was expanded by amalgamation with Thornhill and Unionville. With its original historic downtown, Markham Village, being small and situated tn the far eastern part of the amalgamated municipality, the city decided a larger, more centrally- located downtown was needed. The area south of Unionville to the east of Warden Avenue was frozen for development by the province during the planning and construction of express toll road Highway 407. In 1992, a plan was approved to develop the area with higher commercial density. The Town of Markham has approved the plan, according to Markham's former mayor, Donald Cousens. The community situated in Unionville was planned to be self-sustained and transit-oriented based on smart growth development. Construction began in 2005, when Enterprise Drive was completed. Aviva Canada built its second Canadian headquarters on Birchmount Road and a new Cineplex theatre opened on April 4, 2015. It provides a bigger space to include a few VIP theatres, a new gaming corner and much higher capacity than the old Cineplex theatre at First Markham Place. The Marriott hotel and the York condo was constructed on the corner of Enterprise Drive and Birchmount Road. It was finished by the end of 2018. Development Downtown Markham located in the City of Markham's Unionville Village is using a development strategy named smart growth. The community will try to limit urban sprawl by creating a denser urban centre. The urban centre is planned to be a transit-oriented community, with everything close by and fully transit dependent. In addition, the community was also planned to be environmentally sustainable as well. The community was planned by the City of Markham, in co-operation with The Remington Group. The Remington Group is mainly in charge of constructing most of the structures across this new community. According to the plan approved by the city council, the community will contain residential condos and townhouses, commercial, and retail buildings. Some of these structures have already begun construction. Updates as to what is built is underway. Downtown Markham in Unionville has been nominated as the country's largest mixed-used development, as well as North America's largest LEED (leadership-in-energy-and-environmental-design) registered development. Transportation Warden Vivastation The primary modes of transportation in Downtown Markham are: Regional Roads, municipal roads, a toll highway, bus rapid transit, and GO Trains. =York Regional Roads= The community is bounded with three York Regional Roads, which are numbered as 3 (Kennedy Road), 7 (Highway 7), and 65 (Warden Avenue). =Toll Highway= Highway 407 serves the community with exits on Warden Avenue and Kennedy Road. The highway leads east to Pickering and west to Burlington. =Bus Rapid Transit= The community is served by the Warden, Enterprise and Unionville stops on the VIVA bus rapid transit system. Warden and Enterprise are served by three lines: Viva Purple, Viva Green, and Viva Pink, while Unionville Station is only served by Viva Pink. As of 2011, Viva Purple is the only line with all-day service, the other lines operate only during rush hour. It is scheduled that when Downtown Markham is fully functional and occupied, Viva Green will return to full service. The community is anticipated to be highly dependent on these transit routes, as part of the planned smart growth. Viva Purple connects the locale to Cornell and York University; Viva Green connects the locale to Don Mills Station and Cornell; Viva Pink connects the locale to North York City Centre. Other bus routes that serve the area include: * TTC 68 Warden * YRT 8 Kennedy * YRT 1 Highway 7 =GO Transit= GO Transit operates Unionville GO Station on the Stouffville line during peak commuter traffic. The GO train line connects the Downtown Markham to Stouffville and Downtown Toronto. Environmental sustainability Rouge River at Birchmount Road (with condo buildings at Downtown Markham in the background) The community reserves as a natural reserve, which includes an ecologically sensitive area, Rouge River. Facilities There are two recreational facilities in Downtown Markham: * Markham Pan Am Centre was built for 2015 Pan American Games and became a city-owned facility after completion of the games in September 2015 * Markham YMCA Rudy Bratty Centre was completed in 2006 and upgraded in 2008; featuring two pools and other fitness facilities for YMCA members Education York University/Seneca College Markham Campus site will be built next to the Markham Pan Am Centre.

It is the 106th entry in the series released by Columbia Pictures starring the comedians, who released 190 shorts for the studio between 1934 and 1959. Plot The Stooges are troubadours in medieval times. The villainous Black Prince has designs on marriage to Elaine, the princess. She however is in love with Cedric, the blacksmith. The Stooges try to intervene for Cedric by serenading Elaine; the music is the sextet from Gaetano Donizetti's opera \\"Lucia di Lammermoor\\" . After breaking free from the dungeon where the King has condemned them to be beheaded, Moe overhears the Black Prince plotting with a co-conspirator to murder the king. The Stooges save the day by causing a diversion by dancing in armor to Stephen Foster‚Äôs \\"Old Folks at Home\\", thus allowing Elaine to free Cedric. Finally, the king realizes the plot and jails the Black Prince and his fellow plotter. Elaine is allowed to marry Cedric, and they all live happily ever after.

His Chinese name was Êó•ÊÑèÊ†º (). Career Prosper Giquel first arrived in China in 1857 as part of the allied assault forces of the Arrow War. Taking the opportunity that service in the Guangzhou (then, Canton) occupation force allowed, Giquel began the study of Chinese. In late 1861 he joined the Imperial Maritime Customs Service under Robert Hart,Robert Hart and China's Early Modernization, p. 219 as the director of the Ningbo (Ningpo) office and remained there until the city was captured by the forces of the Taiping Rebellion in December 1861. He was again the Commissioner of Customs for Ningpo in 1864. =Taiping Rebellion= After spending the following spring working in the coordinated French and English campaign to drive the rebels from Shanghai, Giquel returned to Ningbo to organize the force which eventually became the Ever-Triumphant Army (Â∏∏Êç∑Ëªç), also known as the \\"Franco- Chinese force\\". The force numbered between 2,000 and 3,000 men. On 15 March 1863, the force, under the command of Ensign Paul d'Aiguebelle (Âæ∑ÂÖãÁ¢ë) captured the city of Shaoxing (Shao-hsing) from the Taiping rebels. Prosper Giquel took command of the \\"Franco-Chinese force\\" when Paul d'Aiguebelle returned to France, but the force was soon dissolved in October 1864, in agreement with Zuo Zongtang.The Cambridge History of China By John King Fairbank, Denis Crispin Twitchett, p.433 =Fuzhou Arsenal= Prosper Giquel supervised the building of the Foochow Arsenal in Mawei. In 1866 Giquel became involved in the organization and planning for the Fuzhou (Foochow) dockyard project envisioned by Zuo Zongtang. From 1867 to 1874 he served as European director of the project which Shen Baozhen, as the imperial commissioner, headed. The objective of the dockyard was to create a modern Chinese fleet of warships and transports, and to educated technicians in Western sciences. These efforts contributed to China's Self-Strengthening Movement of acquiring Western knowledge. Similarly, the Nanjing Arsenal was put under the responsibility of the Englishman Halliday Macartney.The Rise of Modern China by Immanuel Chung- yueh Hs√º p.282-283 Having completed his direct administration of the project by 1874, Giquel continued to serve the dockyard by working as a consultant, purchasing agent, and co-director of the European Educational Mission in 1877. The educational mission's goal was to provide advanced technical training to complement the dockyard's instructional program. In the mid-1870s and 1880s Giquel became increasingly involved in international diplomacy. He first served as an adviser during the \\"Taiwan crisis\\", a diplomatic clash between Japan and China in 1874 culminating with Japan's invasion of the island. In 1881 he helped Tseng Chi-tse peacefully conclude the \\"III crisis\\" between China and Russia. Giquel spent his last years (1883‚Äì1885) struggling to help end the Sino-French War, which had broken out due to conflicting Sino-French claims to Indochina. Among the traumatic events of that period, certainly for Prosper Giquel, was the August 1884 destruction by the French Navy of the Fuzhou Dockyard, the principal accomplishment of his entire career in China, in the Battle of Fuzhou. Legacy Prosper Giquel appears as a character in Li Bo's Tienkuo: The Heavenly Kingdom an historical novel set in the middle of the 19th century as well as the same author's Beyond the Heavenly Kingdom.

History St. James parish, in Amesbury, Massachusetts, has its roots in 18th century Anglican worship, and takes its present form from the Episcopal Church of the 19th century. =Early Anglican worship in Amesbury= Episcopalians were worshipping in Amesbury as early as 1711. The first Episcopal church was built around 1745, in what is now known as Union Cemetery (originally called Sandy Hill Cemetery). Around 1760, King George III's Chapel, part of the Church of England, was built in the Pond Hill section of town, which was, at that time, the center of Amesbury. Services were held there until 1778, a time when one's political beliefs could change neighbors into enemies, as the Revolutionary War progressed. In this period, the Rev. Moses Badger of Haverhill conducted a service which included prayers for King George III. In the tempest that followed, the town authorities closed the chapel and the parish disbanded. The Chapel was abandoned, and there is no record of an active Episcopal Society in Amesbury until after 1825. =St. James Parish, 1833-1903= The Episcopal Church in Amesbury was organized under the name of St. James on October 8, 1833. The first services were held in Franklin Hall, located in Market Square at the site of the current Associates Building. Shortly thereafter, services were conducted in the Vestry Building of the Calvin Baptist Society on Market Street. This building was purchased in 1836 and moved to the congregation's present location at 120 Main Street. This first St. James Church building was consecrated on October 22, 1836, by the Rt. Rev. Alexander Griswold, Bishop of the Eastern Diocese. By 1845, the parish had outgrown this building, and the first Building Fund Committee was elected to procure funds for a new, larger church. Within the year, the new church was built, and consecrated on November 5, 1846. The original St. James Chapel building was sold to the Universalist Society for $24.50; the new church building cost $5,415.79. On March 18, 1899, a fire started in the Opera House (where the former Strand Theatre now stands), directly across the street from the church. This inferno spread to adjacent business blocks, leaped the street, and consumed both the Rand-Adams block and the church. All was left in a mass of smoldering ruins. The small parish resolved to build a new and larger church, and under the leadership of the rector, Rev. R. LeBlanc Lynch, plans were initiated, and generous contributions from parishioners, friends, and the Diocese led to the construction of our present church. The cornerstone was laid on September 26, 1899, and the present St. James Church was consecrated by the Rt. Rev. William Lawrence, Bishop of Massachusetts, on May 7, 1903. =Later history= One century later, another devastating fire brought destruction to the neighborhood and threatened St. James: in 2001 the church sanctuary and hall were closed for a year by smoke and water damage. In 2006 St. James parted ways with James Place, an after-school program started at St. James under Fr. Mike Shirley. The Reverend Susan Esco-Chandler became a Priest-in-Charge at St. James in 2006, and oversaw extensive renovations to the church and growth in children's programs, Christian education, and membership.

The film was based on The End of the Affair, a 1951 novel by British author Graham Greene, which had been adapted as a film in 1955 with Deborah Kerr. Plot Novelist Maurice Bendrix narrates the film as he begins a book with the line \\"This is a diary of hate\\". On a rainy London night in 1946, Maurice Bendrix has a chance meeting with Henry Miles, husband of Maurice‚Äôs former mistress, Sarah, who abruptly ended their affair two years before. Bendrix's obsession with Sarah is rekindled: he succumbs to his own jealousy and works his way back into her life. As the story unfolds in 1946, we also see flashbacks of Bendrix with Sarah as they began their affair during World War II. Henry tells Bendrix that he believes Sarah is having an affair, so Bendrix hires the bumbling but amiable Mr. Parkis, who uses his young birthmarked son Lance to investigate. Sarah asks Bendrix to meet to talk about Henry and the cold tentativeness of their interaction is contrasted with the passion of their earlier encounters. Bendrix learns from Parkis that Sarah has been making regular visits to a priest named Father Richard Smythe under the guise of false dentist visits and he grows increasingly jealous. Flashbacks show Bendrix expressing jealousy of Henry and asking Sarah to leave him. Though Sarah and Bendrix express love to each other, the affair ends abruptly when a V-1 flying bomb explodes near Bendrix's building as he is out in the hallway. Bendrix falls down a staircase and awakes later, bloodied but not seriously hurt. He walks upstairs, where Sarah is shocked that he is alive. Bendrix accuses Sarah of being disappointed that he survived and she leaves, telling him \\"Love doesn't end, just because we don't see each other\\". In 1946, Parkis obtains Sarah's diary and passes it on to Bendrix; it shows the affair from her perspective. After Bendrix is hurt by the bomb, Sarah runs downstairs and finds him still and not breathing. After trying to revive him, she runs back upstairs and begins to pray for Bendrix's life. Just as she says to God that she will stop seeing Bendrix if he is brought back, Bendrix comes into the room. Now knowing why Sarah ended the affair, Bendrix follows Sarah and begs her to reconsider. Sarah tells Bendrix that she has felt dead without him and can no longer keep her \\"promise\\" to God. Henry, who has figured out that it is Bendrix who was Sarah's lover, desperately asks Sarah not to leave him but, with more persuasion from Bendrix, Sarah agrees to go away with him for a weekend. Henry tracks the couple down to tell them that Sarah has a terminal illness. Bendrix stays with Henry and Sarah over her final days and at her funeral, Parkis tells Bendrix that a chance encounter with Sarah cured his son of his birthmark. At Henry and Sarah's house, Bendrix completes his book and it is revealed that his diary of hate is directed toward God. While Sarah doesn't need to see God to love Him, Bendrix prays God will leave him alone, thereby finally acknowledging His existence.
