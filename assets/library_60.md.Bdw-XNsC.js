History Whitefish Lake was named in the 1850s for the abundant mountain whitefish (Prosopium williamsoni) harvested there. The Salish referred to the lake as ep…´xÃ£ ∑yÃìu, \\"has whitefish\\". Geography Whitefish Lake is located northwest of the city of Whitefish, Montana at an elevation of . It lies between the southwest flank of the Whitefish Range and the northeast flank of Lion Mountain in Flathead County. This natural lake has a maximum length of and width of , and is at its deepest. Whitefish Lake has a surface elevation of and occupies a surface area of approximately . Tributaries to the lake include Swift Creek, which originates in Upper Whitefish Lake, and Lazy Creek, which enter at the northwestern head of the lake, and Hellroaring Creek on the eastern shore, and Beaver Creek which begins in Beaver Lake on the western shore. The lake has approximately of shoreline. The lake's outflow is the Whitefish River, which is a tributary to the Stillwater River, which flows into the Flathead River about east of Kalispell. Ecology Bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus) and westslope cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki lewisi) were the apex predator and pelagic surface feeder, historically, in Whitefish Lake. They persist in the lake but in greatly diminished numbers. The primary threat to native cutthroat trout is hybridization with non-native rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Other native fish species include the river's namesake mountain whitefish, largescale sucker (Catostomus macrocheilus), longnose sucker (Catostomus catostomus), northern pikeminnow (Ptychocheilus oregonensis), peamouth chub (Mylocheilus caurinus,), redside shiner (Richardsonius balteatus), fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas), and mottled sculpin (Cottus bondi) slimy sculpin (Cottus cognatus), and shorthead sculpin (Cottus confusus). The lake's fish assemblage has been almost completely disrupted by twentieth century introductions of non-native fishes and mysis shrimp (Mysida). Introduced non-native fish species include northern pike (Esox lucius) which preys on native trout species. Kokanee salmon, the landlocked form of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), were introduced to the lake in 1945 and spawned successfully for 35 years until competition for forage with introduced mysis shrimp and predation from lake trout extirpated the kokanee. The rise in Mysida populations led to an increase in non-native lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) numbers, the latter competing with bull trout and a predator of almost every native fish species in the lake. Non- native rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and brook trout (\\"Salvelinus fontinalis) have also been introduced and compete with native bull and cutthroat trout. Introduced lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) are now abundant in the lake. Recreation Fishing, kayaking, and boating are major recreational activities on the lake. Whitefish Lake State Park provides opportunities for camping, boating, and swimming, as does Whitefish City Beach, a sandy beach at the lake's outlet in the city of Whitefish.

Hahn starred as Dixie in the original Broadway production of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof in 1955. Her notable films included Too Young to Love (1959). Early years Hahn was born on the East Side of New York City. Her flair for mimicry became evident when she was two years old, leading to popularity on the Borscht Belt. While still a youngster, she expanded her repertoire of skills by learning ventriloquism and adding it to her act. Her mother was Elizabeth Egerman. Theatrical career Hahn received her Actors Equity Card as a child in 1947. Following years on the Catskills summer circuit and radio, Hahn made her professional acting debut portraying one of the children in As the Girls Go for the 1948-50 run at the Winter Garden Theater. She went on to play First Little Girl in the Fulton Theater production of Twilight Walk. She also appeared in Me and Molly (1948) with Gertrude Berg, and Cloud 7 (1958). Hahn's most prominent role was that of Dixie in the original Broadway production of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1955) at the Morosco Theater. Hahn played the title role in the Kermit Bloom Garden Broadway T&B; Semi-national tour production of The Diary of Anne Frank (1958). She has had over 500 television appearances including The Ed Sullivan Show and several hundred radio show credits including as a regular appearance on the Horn and Harter Children's Hour, Search for Tomorrow and others. Hahn also appeared in four Yiddish language productions including Dos Leib iz a Cholem (Life is a Dream) 1945, Vell'n Zei Gedenken? (Will They Remember?) as well as with the National Yiddish Folksbiene Theater (1979). In 1995, Hahn had the title role in Sacajawea, a multi-media production about the native American woman who helped with the Lewis and Clark Expedition, when it had its world premiere in India. Education and feminism In 1963, Hahn began attending Borough of Manhattan Community College. In addition to her formal studies, she began a women's studies group for students and faculty members. That effort was the beginning of Hahn's involvement in feminist activities ‚Äî an involvement that grew out of Hahn's being the subject of sexist encounters in the theater business, which an article in the New Jersey Jewish News described as a \\"harrowing world of endless sexism, harassment, and rape by agents, directors, the press ... that eventually soured her on the industry.\\" From that start, she became more active, and in 1969 she was the press spokesperson and floor chair for the First National Congress to Unite Women. After graduating from New York University with a master's degree, Hahn began to travel the world, teaching at a variety of educational institutions, including Hebrew University of Jerusalem and Vassar College.

In his capacity as a journalist he wrote in several newspapers such as ABC (1908‚Äì1940), La Vanguardia (1914‚Äì1936) El Pueblo Vasco (1920‚Äì1936) or La Naci√≥n (1914‚Äì1940).

While sometimes included in the Generation of '98, this labelling is found to be questionable by many. He was a prominent basher of most noventayochistas, directing a campaign against the likes of Joaqu√≠n Costa, Miguel de Unamuno and Ramiro de Maeztu, only saving Azor√≠n and √Ångel Ganivet from his criticism.

She had intended to claim asylum in Australia and escape her family who she says abused her and threatened to kill her for amongst other reasons leaving Islam, an act that is also a capital offence under Saudi law. After appealing for help on the social media service Twitter and thus gaining significant worldwide attention, Thai authorities abandoned their plans to forcibly return her to Kuwait (from where she would be repatriated to Saudi Arabia), and she was taken under the protection of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and granted refugee status. On 11 January, she was granted asylum in Canada and arrived in Toronto the next day.  Life in Saudi Arabia  Mohammed was born on 11 March 2000. Her father is the town governor of al- Sulaimi in the Ha'il Region. She has nine siblings. She has said that her family prevented her from getting an education, had locked her up for months, subjected her to physical and psychological abuse, wanted her to enter into a forced marriage, and threatened to kill her because she no longer follows Islam. Apostasy in Islam is a crime punishable by death according to the Sharia law of Saudi Arabia.  Detention at the airport hotel  While Mohammed was on vacation with her family in Kuwait, she left them and boarded a flight to Bangkok, Thailand. She intended to continue on another flight to seek asylum in Australia. A tourist visa had been issued to her that permitted entry into Australia. Her family reportedly filed a missing person report after her escape from Kuwait. Upon arrival at Suvarnabhumi Airport in Bangkok, a man greeted her, not disclosing that he was a Saudi embassy official, and told her that he needed her passport so that he could help her obtain a Thai visa. He left with her passport and did not return. Mohammed never intended to leave the airport's transit area and therefore did not require a Thai visa. She was detained by Thai authorities at the Miracle Transit Hotel within the airport. Mohammed opened an account on Twitter, and in a series of posts said that she had renounced Islam and was concerned that she could be murdered by her family in a so-called \\"honor killing\\" if deported to Saudi Arabia. She also said she had barricaded herself in her hotel room, was refusing to exit until she met with UN representatives, claimed refugee status, and implored embassy officials of various Western nations to assist her in seeking asylum. This drew world-wide support, with more than half a million tweets using the \\"#SaveRahaf\\" hashtag. In one tweet, she shared a picture of her passport. Australian ABC Journalist Sophie McNeill flew to Bangkok and sneaked into her room and barricaded herself with Mohammed to protect her. While barricaded Mohammed also allowed a friend to tweet on her behalf. Lawyers in Thailand filed an injunction to prevent her forced deportation. The injunction was subsequently dismissed, though an appeal was planned. Thailand's chief of immigration at the Royal Thai Police Surachate Hakparn subsequently confirmed that authorities in the country had acted at the behest of Saudi Arabia. Mohammed was scheduled to be forcibly repatriated on a flight to Kuwait on 7 January 2019. She barricaded her room to block entry, while at times live streaming airport staff trying to get her to leave the room. She refused to leave. The Thai government later released a statement saying that it would not deport her. Fran√ßois Zimeray, a lawyer chosen by the European Saudi Organisation for Human Rights to defend Mohammed in Bangkok against deportation back to Saudi Arabia, judged the role of Mohammed's tweets to have played an overwhelming role in preventing her deportation. Zimeray stated that the Thai authorities' attitude changed \\"completely\\" in \\"a few minutes\\" when they realized the strength of international support for Mohammed. Mohammed revealed in a later interview that she wrote a goodbye letter and decided that she would end her life if she was to be forced back to Saudi Arabia. = Initial discrepancies in Thai government's accounts of events = In an initial assessment on 5 January 2019, Human Rights Watch Asia deputy director Phil Robertson said \\"the Thai government... (was then) manufacturing a story that she tried to apply for a visa and it was denied... in fact, she had an onward ticket to go to Australia, she didn't want to enter Thailand in the first place.\\" Two days later on 7 January 2019, after international pressure, the Thai official overseeing immigration in the case, Police General Surachate Hakparn, was seen walking beside Mohammed, and stated that \\"We will not send anyone to die. We will not do that. We will adhere to human rights under the rule of law.\\" Subsequently, she was placed under the care of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), her passport, which had indeed included a valid Australian tourist visa, was returned to her, and formal arrangements for the establishment of her long-term asylum status began. = UN involvement = The UNHCR issued a statement on 7 January, stating that: Mohammed subsequently left the airport in the care of the agency, which later granted her refugee status and asked the Australian government to consider granting her asylum. Australian Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton stated in a radio interview with journalists that Mohammed seemed to be safe in Thailand. With growing concerns over her safety and an unclear timeline how long Australia would take to process her application, the UNHCR referred her case to Canada and her application was processed within several hours.  Asylum in Canada  On 11 January, Mohammed flew to Toronto via Seoul, having being granted asylum by Canada, as a \\"resettled refugee\\". The UNHCR said this had been arranged \\"on a fast-track 'emergency' basis\\". She was greeted at Toronto Pearson International Airport by Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs Chrystia Freeland.  Reaction  Mohammed's family released a statement disowning her: After learning about her family disavowing her, she decided to drop al-Qunun from her name and to be known as \\"Rahaf Mohammed.\\" Abdullah al-Shuaibi, Saudi Arabia's charg√© d'affaires in Bangkok, was quoted saying, in a meeting with the Thai immigration office: Mohammed's case has been compared to those of Dina Ali Lasloom, and Hakeem al-Araibi. Stephen Kalin, writing for Reuters, described Mohammed's case as triggering a new phase in the Saudi anti male- guardianship campaign. = Smear campaign in Saudi Arabia = After she was resettled in Canada, a smear campaign was launched against her in both Saudi mainstream media and social media, sometimes even containing conspiracy theories such as a \\"Canadian attempt at stirring up civil strife by inciting the Kingdom‚Äôs teenage girls to abandon social mores\\" in Okaz. Saudi commentator Hani al-Dhaheri called her a drug addict and claimed that the fund raising campaign for her was fake and a failure and she would end up \\"waiting tables in a nightclub for drunkards and gangsters\\" despite the official fund raising campaign successfully exceeding the goal of $10,000. Further, the pro- government newspaper Al Riyadh used the incident to promote family oversight and state control of media in order to stop \\"hostile ideas\\" from infecting Saudi youth and to save children from \\"intellectual penetration\\".

The proposed process is a direct democracy mechanism that allows citizens to petition for a referendum without needing the consent of the parliament or president. Similar referendums are used in around forty other countries, including Italy, Switzerland, Taiwan, Venezuela, New Zealand and in the US state of Oregon.  History of the idea in France In Manifeste au service du personnalisme (1936), Emmanuel Mounier proposed that popular-initiative referenda should counterbalance the parliamentary will in periods between elections. In the 1981, the idea was part of the platform for two Left presidential candidates: Huguette Bouchardeau (United Socialists Party) and Brice Lalonde. In 1983, Charles Pasqua (RPR) introduced a bill in the Senate and in 1987 Yvan Blot (RPR) introduced one in the lower house to permit popular-initiative referenda.  Types of referendums  A member of the Yellow vests movement sporting the revendication on his back Citizens' initiative referendums around the world are based on petitions. To have an effect, a sufficient number of signatures must be gathered within a given time period. In France, these four types of popular referenda are being proposed: legislative (propose a law), abrogatory (repeal a law), recall (revoke the mandate of a sitting politician), and constitutional amendment. In France, yellow vests propose that these referendums should be applicable to four types of procedures: * the legislative referendum, which would consist in submitting a bill to the people. The modalities for implementing this type of referendum vary significantly from one country to another. In Taiwan, for example, the signatures of 0.01 and then 1.5% of the population registered on the electoral rolls, collected over a six-month period, make it possible to trigger a referendum on a proposed law. The result, if positive, must reach a quorum of 25% of the registered members to be legally binding.Art. 29 of the referendum law In contrast, in New Zealand, the signatures of 10% of registrants are required within a year, and the result is not legally binding.Citizens Initiated Referenda Act 1993 * the abrogatory referendum, which would consist of the possibility for the population to repeal or prevent the implementation of a law previously passed by Parliament. Being able to oppose the entry into force of a new law is an existing possibility in several countries, including Italy, Slovenia, Uruguay, Taiwan, Switzerland or Liechtenstein. In the latter two, it is known as optional referendum. *the recall referendum, which would consist in dismissing an elected representative from office. This procedure exists in very few countries at the national level: at the local level, in some states of the United States as well as in several countries in the Americas, including Peru, where it has become commonplace. At the national level, only Ecuador and Venezuela allow it against the Head of State through a popular initiative. In Venezuela, a consultation can only be held once half of the presidential term has elapsed, requires the signatures of 20% of those registered, and is validated by referendum only by a higher number of votes for revocation than the one obtained by the president during his election, provided that a quorum of 25% of the vote is also reached. In Ecuador, the signatures of 15% of those registered within six months are required. An absolute majority of the voters is sufficient, but it cannot be organised during the first or last year of the elected representative. In both cases, it can only be organised once per mandate. * the constitutional referendum, which would consist in allowing the people to amend the country's Constitution. Currently, according to Article 89 of the French Constitution, the initiative for such an amendment is concurrently the responsibility of the President of the Republic, on a proposal from the Prime Minister, and the members of Parliament. After the draft or proposed revision has been voted on in identical terms by both assemblies, the text shall be submitted to a referendum for approval unless the President of the Republic submits it to Parliament in Congress, in which case the draft revision shall not be approved unless it is approved by a qualified majority of three fifths of the votes cast. The importance of a constitutional change means that few countries allow it to have a popular origin, or subject it to stricter conditions. In Uruguay, the collection of signatures from ten per cent of registered voters makes it possible to hold such a referendum, but it is only valid if the \\"yes\\" vote receives an absolute majority and at least 35 per cent of the total number of registered voters, which implies a participation of at least 70 per cent. In 2004, Uruguayans used this mechanism to enshrine the right to water and sanitation in their constitutions.  Support and criticism  For supporters of the recall referendum, if elected officials are revocable, they will no longer be able to betray their campaign promises with impunity, which could also reduce abstention. Some personalities criticize the very principle of repeal or revocation referendums, considering that they represent a danger of instability or paralysis and would thus hinder the freedom of action of elected representatives by imposing on them an imperative mandate which is nevertheless contrary to the principle of Article 27 of the Constitution of the Fifth French Republic. Some criticize these proposals as ¬´poujadism¬ª, or as demagogy.

The Employment of Disabled Workers Act 1987 outlined a quota system for the employment of disabled persons. It stipulated that any company with a workforce of more than 20 employees must ensure that at least 6% of their personnel are disabled workers. Quota objectives are achieved by a combination of sanction and incentive: employers evade paying the penalty as far as possible and are encouraged to recruit and retain people with disabilities through the prospect of financial support. Evidence suggests that many employers prefer to pay the contribution rather than consider employing a person with a disability.http://www.nda.ie/Publications/Employment/Employment- Training/Employment-Publications/Statutory-targets-on-employment-of-people- with-disabilities-in-the-public-sector/2-International-practice-in-quota- monitoring/ EU SILC data for 2009, compiled by ANED, illustrated that the employment rate for disabled people (aged 20‚Äì64) in France was 49.8%, in comparison to 72.1% for non-disabled people (51.5% for disabled men and 48.4% for disabled women) Disability culture =Arts= There are a few regular disability arts events in France. *Art et D√©cirure is a multi-arts festival featuring artists and performers with mental illness.

Biographical data and education Florica Ciumetti came from an Aromanian family. Her father was Sterie Ciumetti - bridge and road engineer, as well as a high school math teacher. Her mother was Anastasia Ciumetti (n√©e Papahagi); her brother, Pericle Papahagi, was an acknowledged authority on the life and languages of the Romance-speaking peoples from south of the Danube, the Aromanians.Alexandra Bellow (2004), Asclepios versus Hades √Æn Rom√¢nia (I), Revista 22 - Revista Grupului pentru Dialog Social, 24 August 2004.Alexandra Bellow (2004), Asclepios versus Hades √Æn Rom√¢nia (II), Revista 22 - Revista Grupului pentru Dialog Social, 31 August 2004.Lauren»õiu Ungureanu (2014), Interviu Alexandra Bellow, matematician, fiica so»õilor Dumitru »ôi Florica Bagdasar, Adevarul.ro/Cultura/Istorie - 25 October 2014. Florica started high school at the Pompilian private boarding school (Pensionul Pompilian), but because of World War I, she had to continue high school in Moldavia, in the town of Roman, where the family had taken refuge. She graduated from \\"Roman VodƒÉ\\" high school (modern section) in 1920. She was admitted to the School of Medicine in Bucharest, from which she graduated in 1925. After years of internships and externships at the Bucharest hospital \\"A»ôezƒÉmintele Br√¢ncovene»ôti\\", she obtained a doctoral degree in medicine and surgery and the right to practice medicine. In 1927 she married Dr Dumitru Bagdasar. The newly-weds Bagdasars went to Boston, Massachusetts to pursue professional training; Florica to attend Public Health courses at Harvard University, Dumitru to acquire knowledge about the new neurosurgery techniques from the pioneer of modern brain surgery, Dr. Harvey Cushing, at his Clinic, Peter Bent Brigham.Paul Cortez (1979), Dr. Florica Bagdasar (1901-1978), Rev. Med. InternƒÉ Neurol. Psihiatr. Neurochir. 2 (24): 149-50, While in Boston, Florica Bagdasar received a Rockefeller Scholarship. Upon their return to their country in 1929, the couple spent a few years in Jimbolia and CernƒÉu≈£i (Hospital for Nervous Diseases), after which they arrived in Bucharest where they settled and where remained until the end of their lives. In 1935, Dr. Bagdasar obtained, through a competition exam, the right to open the first neurosurgery clinic in Bucharest. All that time, from his return from Boston in 1929 until 1935, modern surgery technology did not exist in Romania and he was operating on the brain under primitive, improvised conditions. Until he was able to create his own neurosurgery team, it was his wife, Dr. Florica Bagdasar, who was the only one constantly at his side in the operating room, assisting and encouraging him.Valeriu Negru (2004), Text sub un portret anonym, Dilema Veche nr. 7/2004.»òtefan I.

Professional activity After passing through the whole sequence of necessary exams and competitions, Florica Bagdasar obtained the title of ‚ÄúPrimary Psychiatrist‚Äù, with the specialty of mental hygiene. She dedicated herself to the field of neuropsychiatric and educational pediatric care. Florica Bagdasar and her collaborator, Florica Nicolescu (Stafiescu), have successfully developed and experienced in numerous primary schools their own alphabet textbook (\\"The Book for All Children\\") and their own arithmetic manual, both based on the global grouping idea and simplified vertical writing [ 8] These teaching materials were meant to attract children's interest and make them learn with pleasure, in a rather play-like education process. In 1946 Dr. Florica Bagdasar created the Center for Mental Hygiene in Bucharest, on Str. Vasile LascƒÉr Nr. 14, whose mission was to treat children with mental deficiencies and behavioral disorders. This center was designed by Florica Bagdasar following the most modern scientific methods used in the US. As director of this institution, Florica Bagdasar recruited and organized an exemplary team of experts to deal with children's problems, psychologists, pedagogues, speech therapists, and kinesiotherapists. Florica Bagdasar served as director of the Center for Mental Hygiene until January 1953. In 1946, after the death of her husband, who was at that time the Minister of Health in the Petru Groza government, Florica Bagdasar was asked to become the Minister of Health, as her husband's successor. She occupied this position from 26 September 1946 to 28 August 1948.Fondul Dumitru »ôi Florica Bagdasar, 4 volumes, material selected and organized by »òtefan I. Niculescu, assisted by Ana PƒÉunescu, National Archives of Romania. (The CV and autobiografy of Florica Bagdasar can be found in vol. I, p. 166 and vol. III, p. 900 and p. 910.) Dr. Florica Bagdasar became the first woman to lead a ministerial cabinet in Romania's government. In the years immediately following World War II, both Bagdasar ministers of health, her husband first, then she, faced serious crises that urgently needed to be resolved: sanitary networks decimated by the war, poverty, terrible famine ‚Äì especially in the region of Moldovia where drought and fierce winter had ravaged ‚Äî and which in turn contributed to the devastating epidemics of endemic typhus in Moldovia and malaria in Dobruja.Ileana, (1951, 1952), I live again (TrƒÉiesc din nou), Rinehart & Company, Inc., New York, TorontoAnnie Bentoiu (2009), Timpul ce ni s-a dat, Memorii Vol 2, 1947 ‚Äì 1959, Editura Humanitas, Bucure»ôti Dr. Paul Cortez, the well-known Romanian psychiatrist, and epidemiologist Mihai CiucƒÉ worked directly with the Minister of Health - Florica Bagdasar - in campaigns to combat these epidemics.Paul Cortez (1987), √énainte de a uita, Editura Eminescu, Bucure»ôti. In 1949, Florica Bagdasar was appointed associate professor at the Medical-Pharmaceutical Institute (IMF) Bucharest), where she introduced the specialty of pediatric neuropsychiatry (Normal and Pathological Child Psychology). She became a promoter of infantile neuropsychiatry, both theoretical and practical, creating valuable specialists.Constantin Lupu (2010), 20 Years since the foundation of the Romanian Society of Child and Adolescent Neurology and Psychiatry and allied professions, Journ. of Romanian Child.

Political activity Florica Bagdasar walked in the footsteps of her husband, Dumitru Bagdasar, who had a left political position since his youth. Thus, after King Michael's Coup of August 23, 1944, Florica Bagdasar became a member of the Romanian Communist Party. From 1944 to 1948 she worked in various mass organizations, such as Patriotic Defense, the Union of Patriots, and in the Union of Democratic Women in Romania (UFDR). Between 1946‚Äì1951, she was a member of the Great National Assembly as Tulcea County Deputy. In August‚ÄìSeptember 1946, she was the only woman in the official delegation of Romania to the Paris Peace Conference. From Paris, she went on an official mission to Stockholm to seek help from Sweden (food, and medicine) for war-torn Romania. After returning to her country on September 26, 1946, she was appointed Minister of Health and held this position until August 28, 1948.Revista 22 (2010), Arestarea Abecedarului ‚Äì amintirile FloricƒÉi Nicolescu - extrase din articolele nepublicate scrise de Florica Nicolescu √Æn 2010: Campania de denigrare, Revista Grupului pentru Dialog Social, December 21, 2010. In 1948 she was decorated with the Order of the Star of the Romanian People's Republic. Dismissal and rehabilitation The fact that in 1949 she was appointed as associate professor at the Bucharest Medical and Pharmaceutical Institute and in October 1957 the Vice-President of the Red Cross organization in Romania could suggest that Florica Bagdasar had a career of uninterrupted ascension. However, between 1953‚Äì1956 she fell in disgrace, only a step away from being executed. The campaign against Florica Bagdasar began in August 1948. She was on an inspection task in Dobruja during the antimalarial campaign when it was announced that she was released from office as Health Minister. The decision was made without any prior explanation. Years of contradictory rumors, intimidation, emergence of provocative agents, followed. In 1951, her closest collaborator at the Center for Mental Hygiene, Florica Nicolescu, was arrested, without a warrant of arrest; she was released after two years of imprisonment, without trial, without knowing what the allegations were.Ileana Costea, Doina »öetcu (2010), Secretul longevitƒÉ»õii: Florica Nicolescu la 100 ani, Revista 22/21 dec. 2010Revista 22 (2010), Arestarea Abecedarului ‚Äì amintirile FloricƒÉi Nicolescu - extrase din articolele nepublicate scrise de Florica Nicolescu √Æn 2010: Campania de denigrare, Revista Grupului pentru Dialog Social, December 21, 2010. The campaign against Dr. Florica Bagdasar culminated on January 18, 1953, with an article in the Sc√Ænteia newspaper entitled \\"To Clean Pedagogy of Anti-Science Deformations\\".Sc√Ænteia (1953), Articol de fond: Pentru lichidarea deformƒÉrilor anti»ôtiin»õifice √Æn domeniul pedagogiei, 18 ianuarie 1953, p. 2‚Äì3 Immediately after the article appeared, an official delegation descended at the Mental Hygiene Center and Florica Bagdasar was removed from the position of director and forced to hand over the files and keys of the Institute on the spot. All this in spite of the eloquent appreciation she received for the work of the Center from Prof. Vlad Voiculescu. The shock was so great that she became seriously ill, had been hospitalized for a long time in the Filaret hospital, and had to undergo a very serious lung surgery with minimal chances of survival. But, miraculously, she began recovering. Meanwhile, as the Party had decreed, the article about her in Sc√Ænteia was \\"discussed\\" in special long sessions at all schools and hospitals in the country. The complete article in Sc√Ænteia was accusing Florica Bagdasar of \\"cosmopolitanism\\", of sluggish plunder in front of the rotten bourgeois ideology, of perversion of infantile psychiatry by introducing Freud-like obscurantist approaches, etc. She had been repeatedly investigated. She was left with no income, because her husband's pension from the Academy was stopped, and the \\"Housing Department/Spatiul Locativ\\" forced her to share with another family with two children the apartment where she lived with her daughter. Ostracization was complete: it was a period of fierce political disgrace, persecution, material shortages, illness. The irony of fate made that her serious illness most probably saved her from a more terrible fate, that of a \\"dimisal trail\\" based on the so-called deviations she was accused of. At the end of 1956, the wave of Stalinist terror had passed over, and Florica Bagdasar began to be \\"rehabilitated\\" (along with the de-Stalinization program initiated by Nikita Khrushchev in the Soviet Union). She was asked to rejoin the party, which she refused. In October 1957 she was appointed Vice-President of the Red Cross in Romania, a position in which she worked for several years. She was also given permission to travel abroad, and had the opportunity to visit her daughter in the US several times. She continued to live in Romania until the end of her days in 1978, being treated by the government in a \\"quasi-particular\\" way as Valeriu Negru's states in an article: \\" she was tolerated politically, but not liked.\\" The dramatic end of Florica Bagdasar was described by American writer Saul Bellow in his novel The Dean's December.Saul Bellow (1982), The Dean's December, Harper and Row, New York (Iarna Decanului, POLIROM, 2005, Rom√¢nia) Saul Bellow accompanied his wife, Alexandra Bellow (formerly Alexandra Ionescu Tulcea), to Romania when her mother, Florica Bagdasar, was seriously ill and dying.

Employment Denmark operates an inclusive labour market through a series of employability programmes aimed at integrating people with disabilities into the workplace. The flex Job scheme was introduced in 1998 to bridge the gap in employment of disabled people by allowing employers to hire those with a reduced work ability at a rate which is then subsidised by the government in order to meet the minimum wage. The Flex Job scheme along with other programmes such as the 'ice breaker' scheme and the Skaane job scheme have been seen as having a positive impact on the Danish labour market as participation by those with disabilities has increased greatly since 1998.https://pure.sfi.dk/ws/files/292672/wp182002.pdf Hogeland & Pederson, 2002 \\"Active labour market policies for disabled people in Denmark\\" The open labour market working paper 18/2002.

It has short stems and flattened silvery grey roots pressed against the substrate on which it is growing. The flowers are tube-shaped, pale yellow and open one at a time. This orchid is only known from Christmas Island, an Australian territory and the Indonesia island of Java.  Description  Taeniophyllum hasseltii is a leafless, epiphytic herb that forms small clumps. It has a stem about long and flattened silvery grey photosynthetic roots about wide, up to long and pressed against the substrate. Pale yellow, tube-shaped flowers long and wide open one at a time. The sepals and petals are about long and wide, the petals slightly narrower than the sepals. The labellum is boat- shaped, about long, wide with a spur on its end and a few hairs inside. Flowering occurs sporadically but the flowers are self-pollinating. Taxonomy and naming Taeniophyllum hasseltii was first formally described in 1874 by Heinrich Reichenbach and the description was published in Xena Orchidacea. The type specimen was collected \\"on trees near Brisbane\\" by Walter Hill. Reichenbach noted that he only knew this plant from illustrations from the estate of Heinrich Kuhl and Johan Conrad van Hasselt. Distribution and habitat The Christmas Island ribbonroot usually grows on the smallest branches of rainforest trees.

He served from 1775 to 1783, thus earning his freedom from slavery. After the war, he married and settled in Exeter, New Hampshire, where his homestead is still known as Jude's Pond. Three of his children were kidnapped and sold into slavery, and two of his grandsons fought in the American Civil War.  Military service Jude Hall, of Exeter, New Hampshire, enlisted in May 1775 in the 3rd New Hampshire militia regiment and fought in the Revolutionary War under General Enoch Poor for eight years, earning his freedom from slavery. He was profiled in William C. Nell's book Colored Patriots of New Hampshire, with Sketches of Several Distinguished Colored Persons in 1855, which states: \\"He was a great soldier and was known in NH to the day of his death by the name Old Rock.\\" Hall was possibly the most famous New Hampshire African-American patriot. Timeline * May 10, 1775: Enlisted as a private in Jacob Hind's Company, 3rd New Hampshire Regiment. * June 17, 1775: Fought at Bunker Hill, thrown by nearby cannonball. * Nov. 1776: Re-enlisted in Clayes' Company, 2nd NH Regiment, for three years. * 1777-1779: Saw action at Ticonderoga, Trenton, Saratoga, and Hubbardton. Was ill and recovered in Albany while his regiment continued on to Valley Forge. Fought at Battle of Monmouth, earning nickname \\"Rock\\". Served in the Sullivan- Clinton Expedition against the Iroquois on the southwestern fringes of New York state and eventually redeployed to guard the Hudson Highlands and the string of forts surrounding West Point. * December 1779: Re-enlisted again, serving in Rowell's Company, 2nd New Hampshire. * 1782 ‚Äì 1783: Encamped at New Windsor along with the 1st New Hampshire, forming the New Hampshire Battalion. * 1783: Discharged and returned to Exeter, NH. After his eight years of service, he finally received compensation in October 1786.  Family life  Judes pond sign, Exeter NH, near memorial at water's edge Hall lived his entire life in the Exeter area. \\"Jude's Pond\\", located on 70 Drinkwater Road in Exeter, New Hampshire, was his homestead as a free man and still bears his name. The area is still quite wooded and lonely, but he successfully carved out a small home, which no longer stands. According to Bell's 1888 book, Hall was \\"a powerful man who could lift a barrel of cider and drink from it.\\" Jude married Rhoda (Paul), sister of Reverend Thomas Paul, in 1785 and they had a large family on Drinkwater Road. Three of their sons (James, Aaron, and Wiliam) were stolen into slavery. His eldest daughter Dorothy married Robert Roberts, butler to Massachusetts Senator Christopher Gore and author of House Servants Directory (published in 1827). Roberts gave affidavit testimony regarding 18-year-old James' abduction from his home on Drinkwater Road by an Exeter citizen, David Wedgwood (as described in the House Servant's Directory's 2015 edition \\"introduction xi\\" by Graham Russell Hodges). Two of Jude and Rhoda's grandsons, Moses and Aaron, served in the Civil War. Jude and Rhoda's nephew was the Exeter-born abolitionist poet James Monroe Whitfield. In his history of the town of Exeter, published in 1888, Charles Henry Bell penned a memorable description of Jude Hall as \\"a man of powerful physique...it is said that the parts of his ribs which are usually cartilaginous were of solid bone, so that his vital organs were enclosed in a sort of osseous case.\\"Boston: J.E. Farwell & Co., 1888 According to Bell, Hall was the chief witness of the government in the trial of John Blaisdell for the 1822 homicide of another Exeter resident, John Wadleigh. Both were neighbors of Hall. Hall died in 1827, and his actual gravesite is unknown. In 2000 a descendant of Hall's enslaver erected a memorial stone in his honor in the Winter Street Cemetery in Exeter. Widow Rhoda moved to Belfast, Maine, to live with her daughter Mrs. Rhodia Cook. Rhoda died February 21, 1844 in Belfast.

He is most noted for his Slavonic Bukvar (Primer) that was widely used by Slavic-speakers (Poles, Ruthenians, Czechs, Slovaks, Serbs, Bulgars) both in Europe and throughout the Russian Empire. The historic signiÔ¨Åcance of the 1701 Primer as a sample of book-printing trade lies in the fact that it was the Ô¨Årst time in the history of Moscow book-printing that it was attempted to teach students the elements of not only one language but of three at the same time: Slavic, Greek and Latin. Polikarpov-Orlov graduated from the Slavic Greek Latin Academy in his birthplace of Moscow and later taught grammar, rhetoric, and poetic theory at the same academy. Between 1698 and 1722 he was first a proofreader at the Pechatnyi Dvor (Moscow Print Yard) and then he became the printshop director. From 1726 to 1731 he was director of the Synodal Printing House in Moscow.

Its title is a play on the name of its main character, Richard Rogue, and a collection of photographs of criminals, commonly known as a rogues gallery. Rogue's Gallery was a summer replacement series for The Fitch Bandwagon in 1945, 1946, and 1947 on NBC; star Dick Powell was in the middle of a type transition, from singing juvenile lead to serious dramatic actor. Rogue's Gallery immediately followed his successful transition in the film Murder, My Sweet. Richard Rogue is a private detective who often finds himself in the company of beautiful women. In a typical episode, as he works on a case, he loses consciousness, whether through a blow to the head or by being drugged, and is met by Eugor (\\"Rogue\\" spelled backwards), his alter ego, who points out an overlooked piece of evidence. Once awake, Rogue proceeds to solve the case with this new information in mind. Eugor was voiced by Peter Leeds. For a detective drama, the show was relatively lighthearted, much like Powell's subsequent show, Richard Diamond, Private Detective. Powell left the show after the second season. Barry Sullivan, Chester Morris, and Paul Stewart starred as Rogue in its final two seasons. It aired for a final and full season from 1950 to 1951 on ABC.

Design In April 1917, through his employer, Julius von Berg offered the aviation arsenal (Fliegerarsenal, abbreviated Flars) to purchase aircraft for LFT: * a double multipurpose triplane with the most powerful aircraft engine in Austria-Hungary at the time (the serially produced Austro-Daimler AD 6 engine [19th series], which developed 200 hp [147 kW]); * Triplane fighter similar to the existing D.I biplane fighter Flars refused a two-seater, but agreed to acquire a triplane fighter, which, if adopted, would have received the designation Aviatik Dr.I. On September 17, 1917, Julius von Berg presented to the aviation arsenal the final documentation of the aircraft, which received the type 30.24 internal designation (at Aviatik, the number 30 was the designation of prototypes, the second number after the dot signified a specific design in the corporate list). The triplane 30.24 was a massive aircraft of solid wood construction (only ailerons and elevators and directions were made of steel pipes and web). The fuselage and tail assembly were almost completely taken from the proven design of the DI biplane fighter. The difference was the shortened gargrot behind the pilot's cabin (the biplane DI had the gargrot all the way to the keel). Installed with a strong forward carrying out the wings were single-spar with linen covering. The wing sizes were different: the upper one had a span of 7.23 m, the average was 7.13 m, and the lower one was 7.00 m. The ailerons with cable control were installed only on the upper wing. In contrast to the middle wing, the upper and lower wings were one-piece. The upper wing was connected to the fuselage by means of N-shaped central planes. The lower wing went under the fuselage and was attached to it with the help of four short racks. In order to provide at least some forward-and-down view, the root parts of the middle wing consoles had celluloid lining. Bearing surfaces were reinforced with two pairs of interplanar struts reinforced with a bracing system. The front of the aircraft had a typical frontal radiator, behind which was a six-cylinder in-line water-cooled engine Austro-Daimler AD 6 (18th series). The engine developed power of 185 hp (136 kW) and rotated the four- bladed wooden screw Jaray, the blades of which were mounted with the letter X. Production of protototypes In September 1917, Flugzeugfabrik Aviatik received a contract from Flars to build four prototypes of the 30.24. The first prototype carried the factory designation 30.24; the rest of the cars for which constructive changes were foreseen were not given signs. Julius von Berg was still working on these three cars, intending to apply the flight test experience to them and, in accordance with the requirements of the aviation arsenal, install the Austro-Daimler AD 6 engine (19th series). The finished prototype 30.24 from the Flugzeugfabrik Aviatik plant, located in the Heiligenstadt district of Vienna, was transported in an onboard truck a few kilometers east off Aspernu to the airfield of an aviation arsenal, where its first flight took place in October 1917. Testing The first tests of an unarmed prototype caused some disappointment. Although the aircraft was more maneuverable in the longitudinal plane and had a better rate of climb, its overall flight performance was not much superior to D.I. In Aspern, the modified 30.24 reappeared in February 1918 and was raised to the sky on the 26th. However, the adjustment did not bring major improvements. One way or another, but the era of triplane is over. The aviation arsenal refused to launch the aircraft into mass production and transferred the only car to the Flek 8 division, from which it was transferred for experiments to the Flek 6 division located in Wiener Neustadt. Several types of radiators, propellers were tested on the aircraft and the cockpit was modified to improve the front view of the pilot. These works were carried out in the interests of improving serial DI biplane fighters (these fighters were equipped with at least eight different types of radiators and propellers). In September 1918, the Austro- Hungarian Air Force officially (\\"formally\\") transferred the 30.24 plane to the state balance and paid the company for its cost. Three unfinished prototypes were ordered to be dismantled, without waiting for the corresponding factory designations. So ended the career of von Berg triplane fighters. Interestingly, in April 1920, the prototype 30.24 appeared in the list of Austrian aircraft proposed by Czechoslovakia for purchase!

Chadwick (September 12, 1926 ‚Äì January 19, 2020) was an American clinical and research pediatrician, author, founder of the Chadwick Center for Children and Autism Discovery Institute in San Diego, and director emeritus at Rady Children's Hospital. He became an international pioneer in identifying, treating and preventing child abuse and a recognized expert in the field who started a movement. Early life and education Chadwick grew up the youngest of three siblings in San Pedro, California, and attended the private Chadwick School founded by his parents, headmistress Margaret Lee Chadwick and Comdr. Joseph Chadwick, a career Naval officer. Chadwick attended the University of California, Berkeley, and after completing the bachelor's degree course work in two years, he enrolled in the V-12 Navy College Training Program that trained medical personnel. At the end of his service, he used the G.I. bill to complete his medical education to become a doctor. Career Chadwick began his career in 1949 working as a medical student intern under Dr. Henry Kempe, an early leader in identifying and treating child abuse, at the University of California-San Francisco. The following year, while at UCSF's Department of Pediatrics in the Medical School, Chadwick was awarded a five-year, $35,000 scholarship from the Sister Elizabeth Kenny Foundation for a research program seeking the causes of post-infection encephalitis. He then joined Children's Hospital Los Angeles in 1958 as a faculty pediatrician after Helen Boardman, a social worker who once served on the founding board of Parents Anonymous recruited him to look at child abuse. Chadwick also worked as a pediatrician, as well as a researcher and lecturer, at the University of Southern California Medical School. He contributed to the 1962 original model for the Child Abuse Reporting Law, which became one of the nation‚Äôs first mandatory abuse- reporting laws. Chadwick left Los Angeles in 1968 to become the first employed pediatrician at San Diego Children‚Äôs Hospital, rising as its first chief medical officer before leaving hospital administration to focus on founding its Center for Child Protection. He wrote an editorial in 1972 for the San Diego County Medical Journal suggesting that Children's Hospital University of California-San Diego, Mercy Hospital, Kaiser Permanente, and the United States Navy combine their resources into a single world-class children's hospital. By 1985, Chadwick had founded the Center for Child Protection at Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego. Chadwick spoke before the U.S. Congress in September 1985 about the Child Health Incentive Reform Plan, on behalf of the Western Association of Children's Hospitals. He also co-founded in 1986 the American Professional Society on the Abuse of Children, serving as its second president. He spoke at a California State Senate task force in 1989 about Senate Resolution 7, for a statewide implementation of a Family Relations Division which would have coequal status with criminal and civil divisions. He was a researcher on shaken baby syndrome in the 1990s and a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics's child abuse and neglect committee. He also served as director of the Center for Child Protection at what is now Rady Children's Hospital-San Diego. He served as chair of the American Medical Association‚Äôs National Advisory Council on Family Violence. After his retirement from San Diego Children‚Äôs Hospital in 1997, he worked half time as a research professor of pediatrics at the University of Utah's department of pediatrics and at the Primary Children‚Äôs Center for Safe and Healthy Families in Salt Lake City. After leaving his positions in Salt Lake City, Chadwick suffered a stroke that left him with a hemiparesis. He learned voice transcription and authored the Child Abuse Doctors. He also developed the Cooperative Scientific Knowledge Exchange (CSKE), whose mission is to develop a system for dissemination of scientific knowledge about violence and abuse at the lowest cost. The Rady's Center for Child Protection in 2004 was renamed after Chadwick, its founder, as the Chadwick Center for Children and Families. In retirement, Chadwick continued as director emeritus at the Chadwick Center, and his work and co-writing continued to appear in periodicals and magazines, including the European Journal of Epilepsy in 2016. The American Professional Society on the Abuse of Children, in its online tribute, called Chadwick a ‚Äúlife-long rebel and innovator who made the world a better place through his thinking, sharing, and action.‚Äù Awards and scholarships In 1950, Chadwick was awarded the Sister Elizabeth Kenny Foundation scholarship for research. In 2002, he received the C. Anderson Aldrich Award for \\"outstanding service to maltreated children.\\" In 2010, the American Medical Association presented him the Scientific Achievement Award for his pioneering work in child abuse treatment and prevention. In 2016, Chadwick received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Professional Society on the Abuse of Children.

He created the first large construction company in Denmark. He served as the first president of the Confederation of Danish Employers from 1896 to 1907. He owned S√¶holm in Gentofte from 1877. Early life and education Andersen was born on a farm at Ydby, Thisted County, the son of Anders Nielsen (1794‚Äì1862) and Ane Margrethe Didriksdatter (1797‚Äì1857). The farm was small and his father therefore had to supplement his income by transporting stone and gravel for the county's road construction. From an early age, Andersen had to take part in this work. He received no formal schooling but worked hard to acquire knowledge at home, strongly encouraged by his mother, and attended the writing school for petty officers during his Conscription years as a dragoon in 1855‚Äì57. Career Straight out of the army he started a small construction company. In 1862 he successfully took on the construction of the new Hiller√∏d-Fredensborg railway. After being redrafted during the Second Schleswig War, his company grew rapidly from a number of other contracts on rail lines; The South Zealand Railway to K√∏ge (1869‚Äì70), Helsingborg-Hassleholm with a Bjuv-Billesholm branch (1873‚Äì74), √Örhus-Ryomg√•rd (1876‚Äì78), Gribskov Railway (1879), Randers-Hadsund (1882‚Äì84) and the Gedser Railway (1886), He also worked on the expansion of Helsing√∏r Garbour in 1879‚Äì81 and the construction of the Strandvejen Steam Tram Line 1883. In 1887, he began a partnership with N. C. Monberg. He left the company in 1899. Politics, organisations and public offices Andersen was involved in politics from an early age, He was especially committed to the defence agenda and was a board member of the 1884 founded organisation iv√¶rksatte selvbeskatning til forsvarssagens fremme. He was involved in the construction of the Garderh√∏j Fort as well as the acquisition of land for the rest of the new fortification ring. He was also elected for the Parliament (Rigsdagen) in Nyk√∏bing Mors. He lost his seat at the 1884 election but was 28 September 1886 reelected at a by-election in his home town. He transferred to the Thisted constituency in 1903 where he was elected until giving up his seat in 1909. He was associated H√∏jre but was often in opposition to Minister of Transportation Hans Peter Ingerslev on railway matters. This led to Venstre electing him to spokesperson in connection with the preparations of the State Railways Act in 1891‚Äì92. Andersen was also chairman of the Parish Council (sogner√•dsformand) in Gentofte from 1889 to 1900 and a member of the County Council (amtsr√•dsmedlem) in 1889‚Äì1910. He was strongly involved in the establishment of Arbejdsgiverforeningen af 1896) in 1896 and its later expansion into Dansk Arbejdsgiver- og Mesterforening in 1898. He wanted the organisation to become a future bulwark against conflict between worker and employer and was involved in the September Settlement which ended the 1899 Great Lockout. He resigned as president of Dansk Arbejdsgiverforening on 8 May 1907 and was the following year appointed as honorary member. Andersen was also chairman of Entrepren√∏rforeningen, Arbejdsgivernes Ulykkesforsikring, Danske Lloyd, Bankr√•det for Laane- og Diskontobanken, and a member of overskatter√•det.

The southern portion of the lake is served by route 381, which cuts the lake at the peninsula attached to the north shore, then heads northwest to the Northwestern part of lake Ha! Ha!. The scenic landscape of ‚ÄúPetit lac Ha! Ha!‚Äù with the surrounding mountains attracts nature lovers. Forestry is the main economic activity of the sector, followed by recreational tourism. The surface of the ‚ÄúPetit lac Ha! Ha!‚Äù is usually frozen from late November to early April. The ice shelf is generally thick enough to allow safe passage from mid- December to late March.  Geography  This lake is located at south-west of the summit (altitude: ) of the Mount Four. Pont du lac Ha! Ha! (Bridge of lake Ha! Ha!), separating the Lake Ha! Ha! and the ¬´ Petit lac Ha! Ha! ¬ª.

The ‚Äúpetit lac Ha! Ha!‚Äù is fed by the Quiscane stream (coming from the North and draining the Huard lake) and by an unidentified stream flowing from the east.

Ha!\\" is linked to the lake, the river and the bay of the same name. The specific term \\"Ha! Ha!\\" has several interpretations according to the sources consulted. A popular interpretation associates it with an exclamation indicating irony or onomatopoeia of laughter. However, the name probably comes from an alteration of a Montagnais toponym almost unpronounceable in French, which in Algonquin means a place where bark is exchanged. This is similar to the etymology of the Baie des Ha! Ha!, also part of the Saguenay River basin. According to some historians, this specific is derived from the French word ha-ha meaning \\"an unexpected obstacle on a path\\". Additionally, the recollect Gabriel Sagard (baptized Th√©odat) published the Dictionary of the Huron Language (Paris, 1632), listing the noun H√°hattey, meaning \\"road, lane or address\\".Work: Names and places of Quebec, work of the Commission de toponymie du Qu√©bec, published in 1994 and 1996 in the form of a printed illustrated dictionary, and under that of a CD-ROM made by the company Micro-Intel, in 1997, from this dictionary.

Similar to Dragon Ball GT, it is a manga- inspired installment of the Dragon Ball media franchise, created by Toei Animation instead of franchise creator Akira Toriyama. It premiered on July 1, 2018. Super Dragon Ball Heroes is presented with several alternate scenarios and possible outcomes within the franchise; taking place after the events of Dragon Ball Super and Dragon Ball Super: Broly. The series received mixed reviews. Plot Following the Tournament of Power, Goku, Vegeta and Future Mai are informed by a mysterious figure named Fu that Future Trunks is being held captive on a world called the Prison Planet, which is under control of Frieza‚Äôs brother Cooler. While there, they are confronted by the Saiyan criminal Cumber. After defeating Cumber and freeing Future Trunks, the events on Prison Planet was revealed to be conducted by the mastermind of Hearts. Hearts, who has recruited a cyborg version of Zamasu, reveal his plan to eliminate Zeno and his counterpart just before destroying the Prison Planet. The surviving heroes safely make it back to Beerus‚Äô world while Goku was rescued by the Grand Minister who decides to train him so that he can maintain Ultra Instinct. Hearts plants a \\"universal seed\\" on Universe 11 to drain it‚Äôs energy as he sends enemies across Universe 6 and 3. Vegeta, Trunks and the fighters of Universe 6 face against android siblings Oren and Kamin, who eventually fuse into ‚ÄúKamioren‚Äù while Cooler, now transformed into ‚ÄúMeta Cooler‚Äù, fights against Cumber in Universe 3. The fight on Universe 6 is eventually taken to Universe 11. Goku arrives on Universe 11 with some control over Ultra Instinct. Vegeta manages to defeat Kamioren with his evolved Super Saiyan Blue. Realizing he can't defeat Hearts with Ultra Instinct, Goku convinces Vegeta to fuse with him into ‚ÄúGogeta‚Äù. Gogeta, powered up to Super Saiyan Blue, delivers a final blast aimed towards the seed now infused in Heart‚Äôs chest, killing him. In his final words, Hearts explains that his true intentions were only to free all mortals from the Omni-King before congratulating Gogeta and the other fighters in defeating him. Elsewhere, a satisfied Fu declares that his next experiment is ready to begin. In Universe 7, Beerus warns the Z Fighters of a bird that will destroy the multiverse. Fu arrives with ‚ÄúDoki-Doki‚Äù - the prophesied Bird of Catastrophe - and explains his plan to create an entirely new universe using the ‚ÄúUniverse Tree‚Äù he planted across the multiverse that was created from Heart‚Äôs experimental universe seed and then flees back with Doki-Doki. The tree on Universe 7 begins weakening its inhabitants including Krillin and Piccolo. Beerus raises a shield around the Tree to drain his energy instead despite not being able to do it for long. Fu recruits villains such as Turles, Bojack, Super Android 17 and Dr. W from alternate timelines. Turles and Bojack attack Goku and Vegeta in the main timeline while Dr. W collects Xeno Goku and Vegeta's energy to give to Janemba. Release In May 2018, V Jump announced a promotional anime for Super Dragon Ball Heroes that will adapt the game's Prison Planet arc. A teaser trailer for the first episode was released on June 21, 2018, and shows the new characters and , the evil Saiyan. The first episode was shown at Aeon Lake Town, a shopping mall in Koshigaya, Saitama, on July 1, 2018, and was uploaded to the game's official website that same day. Likewise, the second episode was shown at Jump Victory Carnival Tokyo Kaij≈ç on July 16, 2018, before being uploaded to the website. Reception The series was met with mixed reactions from Dragon Ball's fan base.

(1932 ‚Äì December 31, 2018) was a multidisciplinary artist known for her personified, functional and playful sculptures. Her work often has an explicitly feminist aim, exploring domesticity and the objectification of bodies. Borrowing from both pop art and the Parisian Nouveau R√©alisme movements, she worked in sculpture, performance, video, and design. Personal life Nicola L. was born in Mazagan, Morocco. In the 1960s and 1970s she traveled and worked in Paris, Ibiza, and New York City. In 1979, she moved into the Hotel Chelsea. Career Nicola L. studied art at the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris. She was influenced by sociopolitical movements of the 1960s and 1970s. Although she started as a painter, she soon turned to sculpture. One of her early series was P√©n√©trables, sculptures that were intended to be worn. In 1969 she created \\"The Red Coat\\" for Gilberto Gil and Caetano Veloso's performance at the Isle of Wight Festival in 1970. The piece can be worn by 11 people at once and was intended for improvised group performances. In the mid-1960s, she began a series called Nine Historic Hysteric Women Collages. The nine portraits, painted on bedsheets with collaged materials, feature women who faced social and political injustices, including Joan of Arc, Billie Holiday, Ulrike Meinhof, and Marilyn Monroe. One of her most well-known pieces is \\"Little TV Woman,\\" a sculpture of a vinyl woman with drawers for breasts and a television in her stomach. The TV monitor reads, ‚ÄúI am the last woman object. You can take my lips, touch my breasts, caress my stomach, my sex. But I repeat it, it is the last time.‚Äù Although L. showed with Yves Klein in Paris and received early critical acclaim, she wasn't recognized as a pioneering female Pop artist until her work was shown at the Tate Modern's ‚ÄúThe World Goes Pop‚Äù in 2015. Her first institutional retrospective was in 2017 at the SculptureCenter in New York curated by Ruba Katrib.

Gifted by The Stony Point Folk Art Gallery to The State Museum of Pennsylvania in 1969. Johannes Scholl (8 July 1827 ‚Äì 26 February 1916) was a German-American woodcarver who rose to notoriety years after his death. He is known for only using a jackknife and paint to create his colorful and symbolic wood sculptures. He is regarded today as being one of the most influential folk artists of the 20th century.  Biography  = Birth and childhood = He was born Johannes Scholl on 8 July 1827, in M√ºnsingen, Baden-W√ºrttemberg, Germany to Johann Friedrich and Maria Margaretha Bleher, the second youngest of nine children. He was baptized in M√ºnsingen's Evangelical church the day he was born. Little is known about Scholl's life before he left Germany but he likely received training in carpentry in his native country because of the experience level he had when he settled in Pennsylvania as a young man. = Marriage and children = Scholl married Augusta Kushmaul on November 28, 1853 in Germany. Scholl left his native Germany shortly after marrying Augusta and arrived in the United States that same year. Soon after immigrating, Scholl anglicized his name from Johannes to John. the couple remained married until Augusta's death. All of the Scholl's six children were born in Pennsylvania: * Emma Scholl (12 February 1855 ‚Äì 13 September 1946) * Henry Scholl (17 November 1856 ‚Äì 1868) * Rosanna ‚ÄúRose‚Äù Scholl (14 July 1859 ‚Äì 9 November 1942) * Edward Carl Scholl (1862 ‚Äì 1931) * Frederick Scholl (7 February 1872 ‚Äì 22 October 1929) * John Scholl (8 July 1827 ‚Äì 26 February 1916) = Early life in the United States = Scholl and his new wife arrived in a settlement called Germania. The area was mostly forests by the time Scholl had arrived. Germania also had a high concentration of German immigrants who arrived after the failed democratic revolution of 1848. The Scholls first lived in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania in 1853 and later moved to Abbott Township, Pennsylvania, in 1870. Scholl contributed to his new community as a carpenter by building the Germania Hotel, the local brewery, and some of the first homes in the area. Scholl even built his own home and farmhouse. A devout Lutheran throughout his adulthood Scholl and his immediate family worshipped at the local St. Matthaeus Lutheran Church which he also helped build = Later life and death = Scholl only started his woodworking after retiring at the age of eighty and he enjoyed making his wood sculptures. He created forty-five known pieces, some of them were large sculptures, while others were smaller like toys, and small puzzles. His carpentry skills influenced his woodwork with Victorian architecture design features like spindles and gingerbread brackets, he also used bright colors like mustard yellow, white, soft blue, and green that were once popular exterior colors of homes in the late 1800s. Many of his works included wooden wheels of fortune that were often seen at American carnivals and events after the 1900s. Sometimes when the weather was nice Scholl would take his woodworks out of his barn and bring them outside, around 1907 he began to hold viewing tours and much of the local community enjoyed his work. Scholl died on 26 February 1916 at 6pm at his home from pneumonia which he contracted after shoveling snow. He was buried on 29 February 1916 at Germania Cemetery in Abbott Township, Pennsylvania.  Legacy  One of Scholl¬¥s sons continued to display Scholl's work for fifteen years after his death. His family later lost interest in his work and his sculptures remained forgotten in his barn until his grandchildren rediscovered his work in the 1960s. His descendants later brought his work to The Stony Point Folk Art Gallery where his work was discovered by Adele Earnest and Cordelia Hamilton who were both joint owners of the gallery. Earnest and Hamilton later exhibited his work in 1967 at The Willard Gallery. The thirty-seven pieces on display were well received and gained notoriety from art collectors across the United States. Many of Scholl¬¥s work can be found in museums across the country like The State Museum of Pennsylvania, The Milwaukee Art Museum, and The Whitney Museum of Art. He is regarded today as one of the most influential Pennsylvanian folk artists of the 20th century.

Ottar Agre, May 19, 1896 ‚Äì October 29, 1992) was a Norwegian accordionist, composer, and educator, known for his many recordings and ensembles. Akre was the son of the tailor Edvard O. Olsen Akre (1844‚Äì1925) and Oline Haagensdatter (1855‚Äì1934). Akre was born in Ytre Rendal. He paid sixteen kroner for his first accordion as an eight-year-old in 1904. In 1909 he was nearly killed when a load of timber collapsed, and he lay 6 months at Oslo University Hospital after this. He moved away from home quickly, working as a navvy for the Dovre Line and R√∏ros Line, and he also worked as a cinema operator in Volda and Tyssedal in 1918. He studied under Johan Elsmo at J√∏mna in 1910, and in Kristiania he played a concert at Gamle Logen, where the royal couple were also present. During this time, he was also involved with Circus Norbech as an electrician, but began studying as an electrical engineer, which he continued in the United States from 1922 to 1928. In the United States, performed in an ensemble called Angre's Scandia Art Bell Ringers, in a lineup including Georg Holter, Edvard M. Roll, and Albert E. Agre. Akre studied for some time at the Fargo College Conservatory of Music in North Dakota (in 1927). After returning to Norway in 1928, he was employed by the Carl M. Iversen company as a music salesman and instructor, where he taught some of Norway's future leading accordionists, such as Toralf Tollefsen, Oddvar Nygaard, Rolf Syversen, Alf Blyverket, Arnt Haugen, and Arnstein Johansen. Akre taught at the Oslo Conservatory of Music from 1940 to 1946. Akre led several ensembles, including the Aakre Trio with Oscar Skau on guitar and Eugen Martinsen (later Amund Friestad) on violin in 1929; this lineup worked at Oslo nightclubs such as R√∏de M√∏lle, Grandkjelleren, and Original Pilsen. In ensembles such as the Tip Top Band (a quartet) and the Akre Quintet, he became generally known through broadcasting (Akre had his own weekly radio program for several years) and album releases with artists including Jens Book-Jenssen. The fifth instrument in the quintet was a glockenspiel . Acre was the first Norwegian performer to play an electric accordion (a Solovox in 1946; later a Cordovox). He also founded the Oslo Accordion Club (Oslo Trekkspillklubb) in 1945, which he led until 1977. Akre died in Oslo.  Compositions Akre composed over one hundred songs, including: * \\"St. Hansvalsen\\" (St. John's Waltz) * \\"Brandbuvalsen\\" (Brandbu Waltz) * \\"Livet i Hemsedal\\" (Life in Hemsedal) * \\"√òsterdalsmazurka\\" (√òsterdal Mazurka) * \\"Fagerborg reinlender\\" (Fagerborg Schottische) * \\"Gl√•mdalsbrudens vals\\" (The Bride of Gl√•mdal's Walz) * \\"Jonsonvalsen\\" (Jonson Waltz) * \\"Revymars\\" (Review March) * \\"Sjongl√∏rn\\" (The Juggler) Akre wrote Norwegian lyrics to the song \\"When It's Springtime in the Rockies\\" (retitled \\"Det blir atter sol og sommer\\" 'It Will be Sun and Summer Again').

Employee reviews of Xyleco are mixed. Some workers are extremely optimistic as the company grows, while other workers find management secretive and manipulative. Xyleco's process involves using ionizing radiation from an electron particle accelerator to break apart cellulose molecules. Accelerators are energy-intensive, but treatment times are short. History The company was started by Marshall Medoff, an 81-year old without a formal science education. He got his inspiration by spending time at Walden Pond, and studying research papers in a storage facility for 15 years. During that time, he was granted over 300 patents. Several 2002 patents were for plastic-cellulose-fiber composites expected to be stronger than ordinary plastic based on resins and wood fiber. In 2004, Rubbermaid agreed to work with Xyleco to develop a material that would be stronger and cheaper than current materials. In 2009, Medoff hired his first employee, Craig Masterman, an MIT graduate in chemistry. Using $45 million from investors, they built a testing laboratory in Wakefield, Massachusetts, in March 2015.

It operated as a train station from 1858 until 1941, and remained in service for non-passenger functions until the 1970s. The railway junction itself no longer exists as the former Grand Trunk railway directly from St. Marys to Sarnia has been abandoned. All trains from St. Marys to Sarnia travel instead along the route to London, and the former Great Western Railway from London to Sarnia. Structure The station building in 2017 The station building was designed according to the standard Grand Trunk Railway 'A First Class Way Side Station' plan developed by British architect Francis Thompson. The passenger facilities consisted of a ticket area, a luggage room and separate 'ladies' and 'gentlemen' waiting rooms. History St. Marys station opened in 1858 as the western terminus of the Grand Trunk Railway line from Toronto, located fully outside the town of St Marys. The Town of St. Marys opposed the selection of such a remote station location, instead recommending a location near the town centre. The Grand Trunk Railway was extended west to Sarnia in 1859 and south to London in 1860, with the two branches meeting at St. Marys station. As a result, St. Marys station became St. Marys Junction and the station building became the control point for the switches at the rail junction. In 1879, St. Marys Town GTR station opened within the town on the branch toward London, providing a more convenient access to the town centre than St. Marys Junction station. The passenger function of St. Marys Junction was further diminished when St. Marys Town station was replaced by the current St. Marys station in 1907. The station was closed in 1941, but the building continued to be used for non- passenger purposes until the 1970s.

Before Disney, Trowbridge was active in film and theatre production, and held leadership roles within Universal Creative, the design and development arm of Universal Parks and Resorts. In 2007, Trowbridge left Universal to join Walt Disney Imagineering to lead Disney's Research & Development division and Blue Sky Creative Studio. In 2015, he started a new studio at Imagineering dedicated to developing Lucasfilm and Star Wars projects.  Early life  Trowbridge grew up in the suburbs of St. Louis, Missouri where he attended Lindbergh High School. During high school, Trowbridge played percussion in Lindbergh High School's marching band and symphonic band, and sang in the school's show choir. He also appeared in school theater productions, as well as local community theater productions, specifically Kirkwood, Missouri's Stages. In 2016, Lindbergh awarded a Distinguished Alumni Award to Trowbridge. After Lindbergh, Trowbridge attended USC's well-regarded School of Cinematic Arts.  Career  = Live theatre = Before developing theme parks and location based entertainment, Trowbridge produced live theatre productions. His first Disney connection may have come while producing \\"Tiger Lady,\\" a period drama that starred Beauty and the Beast star Paige O'Hara with set designs by Joe Cashman, with whom he would later reunite at Disney's Imagineering. Trowbridge also worked with Los Angeles' famous Groundlings improvisational comedy troupe and school. = Universal Studios = In the early '90s, Trowbridge joined Universal Creative and has often been associated with technically challenging and innovative projects and new technologies. When describing The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man to Wired Magazine before it opened in 1999, Trowbridge said about the blend of art and technology, \\"If it works, it'll be like a good magic trick.\\" Often cited as one of the best theme park rides in the world, Trowbridge led the Spider-Man creative team and the attraction has since won many awards including winning Amusement Today's Golden Ticket Award for Best Dark Ride for twelve consecutive years from 1999 to 2010. (In 2011, the top spot went to another Trowbridge project, Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey.) Trowbridge continued to lead project teams on new attractions like Universal's Revenge of the Mummy which innovated the combination of traditional dark ride techniques with roller-coaster thrills. At a news conference in New York in February 2004, Trowbridge told the New York Times, \\"Traditionally, theme park attractions have had to make a choice: roller coaster thrill ride or an immersive dark ride,\\" continuing \\"We have been striving to find a way to put together the best of both worlds in one experience.\\" Trowbridge added, That takes advances in technology we've been working on for a long time. In May 2007, Universal Studios and Warner Brothers confirmed the rumors Universal was working on a Harry Potter-based theme park project. Characterized as \\"a theme park within a theme park,\\" The Wizarding World of Harry Potter became one of the most anticipated theme park additions ever. Trowbridge made the announcement in a live webcast from Dumbledore's office set at Leavesden Studios alongside Stuart Craig, the Production Designer of the Potter films. Trowbridge introduced Craig's involvement in the project and reassured Potter fans that \\"We're really going to the people who know this world best to ensure that level of authenticity.\\" The Wizarding World of Harry Potter, and its ground-breaking attraction, Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey, opened at Universal Orlando Resort on June 18, 2010; at Universal Studios Japan on July 15, 2014; and at Universal Studios Hollywood on April 7, 2016. = Walt Disney Imagineering = In October 2007, the Orlando Sentinel newspaper reported that Trowbridge was leaving Universal to join Disney. Industry experts speculated that with the Wizarding World creative planning already complete, Disney might be able to offer more challenging projects as the vice president for creative research and development. Trowbridge is not known to have commented on the reasons behind the change. Trowbridge joined Walt Disney Imagineering overseeing its technology R&D; division, and, its Blue Sky Creative Studio. Trowbridge has often advocated for new forms of immersive experience combining artificial characters, more personal experiences and more interactive experiences. In 2015, Trowbridge told The Verge about Disney's elaborate ARG (Alternate Reality Game) that pulled participants into the backstory of the film Tomorrowland. Trowbridge told The Verge, \\"What we‚Äôre spending a lot of time making sure we get awesome at are deeply immersive, participatory experiences,\\" and, \\"More and more, technology is allowing us to do this. I think culture is kind of inviting us to do this, and frankly, I kind of believe there‚Äôs a changing form of narrative.\\" Trowbridge is also active in developing technologies related to aviation and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. Trowbridge invented many patents around the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, or drones In 2012, Disney unveiled a physical flying fire-breathing dragon, which Trowbridge worked on, as part of the opening of New Fantasyland at Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom. With Disney's 2012 acquisition of Lucasfilm, speculation about Star Wars-themed attractions grew. And in 2014, Disney started a new Studio at Imagineering dedicated to developing Lucasfilm and Star Wars projects with Trowbridge leading the group. While speculation about new Disney theme parks and attractions continued, on August 15, 2015, Disney CEO, Bob Iger announced what had been long anticipated, that Disney would build two Star Wars themed lands, at both Disneyland and at Disney Hollywood Studios. In July 2017, Disney announced that these new lands would be called, Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge. During the 2018 Disney Parks Christmas Day Parade television special, Iger introduced a video teaser showing the most finished work to date. Showcasing footage from inside the actual attractions, Trowbridge, along with Carrie Beck, a Lucasfilm story executive, described the attractions and the overall land which are scheduled to open in 2019.  Personal life  Scott Trowbridge lives in Los Angeles, California with his wife and two children. He volunteers as a Mission Command Pilot for Angel Flight West, a nonprofit volunteer organization that provides private air transportation for children and adults with serious medical conditions.

Comedians may try to circumvent clean-comedy restrictions by using innuendos, euphemisms, doublespeak, double entendres, and gender-neutral language. Clean comedy is not necessarily unprovocative. Clean comedy is considered by some to be a higher form of comedy than bits that rely on the shock of profanity or sexual content to elicit laughs. Bob Newhart said in a The Wall Street Journal interview that getting laughs from clean material \\"is harder. It's just harder...I got a certain satisfaction out of getting a response from the audience and knowing I'd done something that may be harder.\\" David Brenner said \\"Many who rely on dirty humor do so because vulgar language helps sell weak jokes.\\" History Some early comedies, such as the ancient Greek Lysistrata and some of William Shakespeare's plays, could be considered raw and bawdy. The rise of the mass media led to a focus on keeping comedy free from objectionable content to appeal to the largest audience and to advertisers. Comedians such as Bob Hope, Bill Cosby And Bob Newhart were known for clean routines and attracted a wide audience. In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission's rules against obscenity on broadcast television caused clean comedy to flourish. The rise of cable television and loosening of public attitudes towards the end of the 20th century allowed comedians to be more \\"edgy\\" or \\"filthy\\" and led to the rise of blue comedy and media personalities like Howard Stern who rely heavily on profanity and sexual content. Resurgence Clean comedy experienced a resurgence in the U.S. in the 2000s and 2010s, partly as a reaction against decades of blue comedy. Brian Regan, a comic who decided to turn to clean comedy, said in 2006, \\"Blue comedy is so commonplace, it's no longer counterculture.\\" He added that while baby boomers might be jazzed by hearing the seven dirty words, young people in the 21st century were so used to hearing profane language that \\"The fact that something is dirty isn't the enticing part. It also has to be funny.\\" Jim Gaffigan became very successful in the 2010s on a reputation for being clean, focusing his bits on everyday things like food and raising five children. Corporate conferences, cruise ships, non-profit organizations, schools and churches, and other organizations wanting family-friendly entertainment have also fueled a resurgence in clean comedy.Why clean comedy is becoming big business (Christian Science Monitor) A number of outlets have grown to support clean comedy. CleanComedians.com markets a roster of dozens of clean comics for events.There Once Was a Man From Nantucket . . . (Washington Post) Dry Bar Comedy was started in 2017 as an online television series of clean comedy routines and has attracted a large social media following.

It covers scientifically relevant information from the Middle Ages to the present day. Publishers are the University Library of T√ºbingen, the Faculty of Protestant Theology and the Faculty of Roman-Catholic Theology, University of T√ºbingen.  History  Its predecessor, the Zeitschrifteninhaltsdienst Theologie (\\"Theology Journals Content Service\\") or ZID, was started in 1975.Weisweiler, Hilger. \\"Der Zeitschrifteninhaltsdienst Theologie der Universit√§tsbibliothek T√ºbingen\\". Bibliotheksdienst 30(2), 1996, pp. 243-251, doi:10.15496/publikation-34164 (in German). This was a current content service which reprinted the table of contents of the main theology journals; monthly ZID issues included an index of authors, Biblical references and persons, which were later combined in an annual and a five-year index. In 1994-1995, the ZID was converted into a database using allegro-C (a library software developed by the Library of the University of Braunschweig); the bibliographic data extracted from the journals was now stored electronically before it was published in the ZID issues, and the data which had been published in the prior ZID issues was retrospectively catalogued. In addition to subject indexing with standardized index terms, a faceted classification with 130 classes was introduced at that time. The database itself was made available to the public in German first on floppy disks, later on CD-ROM.Becht, Michael. \\"30 Jahre Dokumentation theologischer Aufsatzliteratur.

Starting in 2001, the subject headings and the user interface were also translated into English. At the end of 2000, the ZID ceased the publication of its print version. The name of the database was changed to Index Theologicus in 2002, when the publishing house Mohr Siebeck started managing its distribution.

A special search capability for specific Bible passages using standard abbreviations is also available. The faceted classification (named \\"IxTheo classification\\") now comprises 139 classes divided into 13 main groups. Since 2013, IxTheo uses the database of the regional cataloguing network \\"S√ºdwestdeutscher Bibliotheksverbund\\" (SWB, in south-western Germany), which is shared i.a. by the theological faculties of T√ºbingen, Heidelberg and Freiburg. The data from the former allegro-c database (over 500,000 records) was migrated into the SWB catalog in 2016.

He is the chairman of Port Tampa Bay. Swindal was a general partner of the New York Yankees of Major League Baseball from 1998 through 2007, and in 2005 had been chosen as George Steinbrenner's successor as head of the Yankees. Biography =Early life and education= Swindal graduated from Berkeley Preparatory School in Tampa, Florida, and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC). He earned his bachelor's degree in history in 1976. He hoped to become a doctor, but was not accepted into medical school, and he then took postgraduate coursework in biology at the University of Florida. He returned to Tampa to work for his family's furniture wholesale company. =Career with New York Yankees= Swindal met Jennifer Steinbrenner, a UNC alum and daughter of New York Yankees principal owner George Steinbrenner, through a mutual friend in Tampa. They married in 1983. Swindal initially continued working for his family's business, but eventually joined the American Shipbuilding Company, owned by George Steinbrenner. He then ran a tugboat company Steinbrenner owned until it was sold in 1995. Swindal then joined the Yankees front office. He became a general partner of the team and chairman of Yankee Global Enterprises, including a financial stake. Swindal led the Yankees in negotiating a contract extension with manager Joe Torre in 2004. In June 2005, he was named by Steinbrenner to be his eventual successor as head of the Yankees. =Arrest and buyout= In February 2007, Swindal was arrested for driving under the influence (DUI) of alcohol. He had been driving to his boat, where he planned to sleep for the night. The following month, he and Jennifer released a statement saying that they were in the process of a divorce. The Yankees bought out Swindal's stake of the franchise in September; Hal Steinbrenner succeeded him as chairman of Yankee Global Enterprises. Swindal pled no contest to DUI in November, agreeing to a suspension of his driver's license for six months, a year of probation, and 50 hours of community service. =Post Yankees career= In 2007, Swindal became chairman of Marine Towing, a tugboat business when he bought out the Steinbrenner family stake. Charlie Crist, the Governor of Florida, appointed him to the board of Port Tampa Bay in 2008. The next year, he opened a baseball academy in Boca Chica, Dominican Republic, with Hans Hertell, a former United States Ambassador to the Dominican Republic, and Abel Guerra, a former Yankees front office executive. Swindal became vice chairman of the board of Port Tampa Bay. When the chairman resigned in 2013, Swindal succeeded him. Governor Rick Scott reappointed Swindal as chairman in 2018. =Family= Swindal has two children: Haley and Stephen Jr. Both graduated from UNC.

Nastos noted \\"On paper, Kenny Burrell's three-guitar band with Bobby Broom, Rodney Jones, and a bass/drums rhythm section looks pretty good. Though individually they all sound quite different, this meeting of the minds, recorded over two days in October of 1986 at the Village Vanguard, harnesses the sound of Jones to a certain degree, and lets Broom a little loose in his soulful groove tendency. All are quite competent and professional players who understand the subtleties and understated harmonic arena Burrell lives in, so things work quite well in terms of sharing the load. There's very little competition at stake, the guitarists rightfully trade space and phrases, and play few extended unison lines, so the listening is enhanced if you do pay attention ... It seems this one-shot effort could be looked at via a jaundiced, too-many-cooks-spoil-the- broth eye. The music is good, not particularly great or memorable, but certainly a credible effort, likely better heard at the venue on the nights in question\\".

Fennell of the Boise architectural firm Wayland & Fennell. When the Idaho Building opened, journalist Blaine Phillips wrote, \\"The building is sublimely beautiful, the vivid colors which have been applied in perfect harmony with the surroundings, serving ably to accentuate the picturesqueness and uniqueness of the construction.\\" Although constructed at the fair by the State of Idaho, the Idaho Building served as exhibition and entertainment space for three states without buildings, Montana, Wyoming, and Nevada, on days honoring the people of individual states. Architecture Dimensions of the Idaho Building were 100 feet by 89 feet, including a 12-foot wide entry hall leading to an exhibition room 100 feet by 60 feet, with reception rooms for women and men on each side of the hallway. The building included offices, a breakfast room, a kitchen, and two second floor apartments. The Washington Times described the building as \\"of a style peculiar to inter-mountain countries,\\" and the Deseret Evening News said it was \\"in a form somewhat resembling a Swiss Chalet.\\" At night, between 400 and 500 incandescent lamps illuminated the building. Exhibits In addition to agricultural, mineral, and mining exhibits, the building featured exhibits made by children in Idaho schools. Thousands of educational pieces were displayed, including photographs, paintings, drawings, bound volumes, and weaving. Prizes At the conclusion of the fair in September, the Idaho Building received the gold medal, and Idaho received another gold for excellence at exhibition. Idaho received a total of 91 gold medals, 46 silver medals, and 44 bronze medals awarded for its exhibitions. After the Exhibition Near the end of October, 1905, the Idaho Building was purchased by Paul Wessinger, who planned to remodel it into a clubhouse. Wessinger, son-in-law of Henry Weinhard, managed Henry Weinhard's brewery and was chairman of the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition grounds and buildings committee. The Idaho Building may have been demolished soon after the Exhibition, however, as many of the buildings were temporary structures not well suited to Portland's climate. Other buildings withstood years of neglect prior to demolition. Parts of two buildings have survived since the Exhibition, the NCR Building in St. Johns, now a McMenamins outlet, and the American Inn in North Portland, now a condominium.

Early Painting Norrie studied as a painter at the National Art School, Sydney (1972-1973) and the National Gallery School, Melbourne (1974‚Äì76). In 1980 the Art Gallery of New South Wales included her in a group exhibition. In 1983 they bought one of her paintings; and the following year she was included in the 'Australian Visions: 1984 Exxon International Exhibition' at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York.\\". Her 1986 painting ‚ÄòF√™te‚Äô depicting Mickey mouse dressed as a clown won the inaugural Mo√´t & Chandon art award affording her the opportunity to work in France, but Norrie had \\"an ambivalent relationship to painting\\". She began focusing more on using text rather than figures in her paintings (such as in her ‚ÄòPeripherique‚Äô (1988) and ‚ÄòRoom for error‚Äô (1993) series) and then in the 1990s switched to experimenting with film as a more effective medium for her political and environmental commentary. In 1999 she received an Australia Council Fellowship. Twentyfirst Century Video Work During the first two decades of the 21st Century, Norrie focused on the Asia-Pacific incorporating footage of environmental and humanitarian disasters that impacted the region in large- scale video projections. Norrie's 2002 work 'Undertow' commissioned by the Melbourne Festival for the Australian Centre for Contemporary Art, was a six- screen mix of storms, dust clouds and thermal mud pools. Art critic Andrew Frost said it suggested impending global catastrophe: \\"Like much of Norrie‚Äôs work, Undertow invoked a sense of the uncanny, produced in part from the projection of these images at great scale.\\" Norrie's 2003 work 'Passenger', created for the Museum of Contemporary Art Australia, juxtaposed images of New Zealand glow worm caves and insect swarms with scientific experiments and industrial ducts on six-screens. Tate curators Sook-Kyung Lee and Lena Fritsch described it saying: \\"Her work has addressed issues of technological advancement, natural and manmade disasters, climate change and other ecological crises, and is increasingly concerned with the conflicts between humankind and nature.\\" Her 2005 smaller single-channel work 'Black Wind' commissioned by the combined indigenous descriptions of the fallout from the British nuclear tests at Maralinga and footage of the Aboriginal Tent Embassy. She represented Australia at the 52nd Venice Biennale, 2007, with Callum Morton and Daniel von Sturmer. Her large-scale work 'Havok', commissioned by the Australia Council for the Arts, was exhibited in three rooms of the Palazzo Giustinian Lolin, Venice. The work focused on the Lusi mud volcano disaster in Indonesia that was blamed on the local gas drilling. She returned to the subject again in her 2016 work 'aftermath'. Media and communication professor Larissa Hjorth described the latter work as: \\"a meditative contemplation on the terrible sublime of environmental disasters in which humans, while causing such crises, have little power to control and correct.\\" Since then other significant exhibitions have included ZKM Center for Art and Media Karlsruhe 2008; the Edinburgh International Festival 2009, Yokohama Triennale 2011, Gemeentemuseum Den Haag 2013; Biennale of Sydney 2014; the Montreal Biennale, 2014 ‚Äì 2015; and Ian Potter Museum of Art, University of Melbourne 2016. Collecting In 2015 Norrie's painting 'Tall Tales and True (Pinocchio)' 1986 sold at auction for A$42,500.

He excelled in comic roles at the Theater an der Wien, and wrote several plays, librettos for operettas and songs.  Career  Karl Gemperle was born in Vienna, the son of Anton Gemperle, a coffee substitute manufacturer. His grandfather, the Swiss Johann Baptist Gemperle, had founded the first Viennese surrogate coffee factory. After a technical school education Lindau turned to theatre and made his debut on 20 October 1870 in Graz in the title role of Schiller's Don Carlos. Engagements followed at the Deutsches Theater in Pest, in Frankfurt am Main and in Dresden, in 1879 again in Graz and in 1880 briefly in Olm√ºtz. During this time, Lindau slowly turned from classical roles to comic roles. In 1880, he toured successfully through the United States and Canada with Josefine Gallmeyer, Wilhelm Knaack and Franz Tewele. In 1881, he was finally engaged by director Franz Steiner as a comedian at the Theater an der Wien and was a member of the ensemble until 1901. His roles in operettes and Wiener Possen made him a darling of the audience. He played S√ºffle in the premiere of Zeller's Der Vogelh√§ndler on 10 January 1891. From 1876, Lindau was also active as a writer for the stage. In total he wrote more than 100 full-length plays, including s, farces and libretti for operettas, some of which became very popular. Together with Leopold Krenn (1850‚Äì1930), he wrote farces (') such as Hei√ües Blut (Hot Blood, 1892), Ein armes M√§del (A Poor Girl, 1893) and Der Nazi (1895).

In 1952 she was sent by the Third King, His Majesty Jigme Dorji Wangchuck to eastern Bhutan to help the people who were being harshly taxed by local rulers, empowering her to give Kidu (land) to the Zaps and Tayps (landless classes). This became known as Ashi Tashi Thram and stopped the mass exodus of Bhutanese from the east to India.Fischer, T & Tashi, T 2009, Bold Bhutan Beckons: Inhaling Gross National Happiness, CopyRight Publishing, Qld, Australia, pp 235 - 236 During her stay in Trashigang she met many leprosy sufferers and spent most of her evenings administering penicillin. She wrote to the king that Trashigang needed a leprosy hospital. In 1954 she recruited soldiers for the king and helped establish an army training camp. In 1962 Tashi represented her brother Jigme Palden Dorji, the Prime Minister of Bhutan, at the 14th meeting of the Consultative Committee of the Colombo Plan, held in Melbourne, Australia.

Military officers claimed that they had ousted President Ali Bongo, who was re-elected in 2016 after a controversial election and protests. During the absence of Ali Bongo, who was receiving medical treatment in Morocco, armed rebels in the capital city Libreville took hostages and declared that they had established a \\"National Restoration Council\\" to \\"restore democracy in Gabon\\". Widespread Internet outages occurred throughout the country, though it is unknown whether the Internet was shut down by the rebels themselves or by civilians. Gabon's government later declared that it had reasserted control. Additionally on 6 January 2019, a day before the coup attempt, American President Donald Trump sent 80 US troops to Gabon amid fears of violent protests in the nearby Democratic Republic of the Congo. Developments The military spokesman and leader of Patriotic Movement of the Defence and Security Forces of Gabon, Lieutenant Kelly Ondo Obiang, stated on national radio and state television on early Monday morning that he and his supporters were disappointed by President Ali Bongo‚Äôs message to the nation on New Year's Eve, calling it a \\"relentless attempt to cling onto power\\" and saying it \\"reinforced doubts about the president's ability to continue to carry out of the responsibilities of his office\\". Obiang also claimed they were setting up a \\"National Restoration Council...[for] restoring democracy\\" in Gabon.

Among other things, Obiang delivered the following message on national radio: At the time of the coup, on 7 January, President Bongo was receiving unrelated medical treatment in Morocco; he had been out of the country for about two months. President Bongo had suffered a stroke while in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, in October; his recorded New Year's wishes were the first time he had spoken in public since then. The pro-coup forces seized control of the national broadcaster Radio T√©l√©vision Gabonaise. Gabon's Republican Guard deployed various armoured vehicles throughout the capital, including Nexter Aravis MRAPs, a type not previously known to have been in the Gabonese Military's inventory. The coup attempt was put down by 10:30 am after the Gabonese Gendarmerie Intervention Group assaulted the Radio T√©l√©vision Gabonaise in which the pro-coup forces were holed up. Two pro-coup soldiers were killed in the assault. Officers involved in the coup took hostages which have since been released by Gabonese officials. Hours after the coup announcement, government officials stated that the situation was \\"under control\\" with rebels arrested or on the run; two of the rebels were shot dead and Lieutenant Obiang was reported under arrest. NetBlocks observed that internet connectivity was briefly (though partially) restored across Gabon by 10:00 am UTC before falling back offline, and only returning fully 11:00 am the next day. Security Minister Guy-Bertrand Mapangou stated that the eight surviving rebels were handed over to the public prosecutor. The government of Gabon announced that President Bongo would be returning to the country \\"very soon\\". International reactions * : The chairperson of the organization's commission Moussa Faki Mahamat condemned the coup attempt. * Egypt: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Egypt has condemned the coup attempt. * : French Foreign Ministry criticised the actions carried out by the Military. \\"Gabon's stability can only be ensured in strict compliance with the provisions of its constitution\\" said a spokeswoman of the ministry. * : In a statement, the Department of International Relations and Cooperation said \\"South Africa reaffirms the African Union principle of the total rejection of all unconstitutional change of power\\". * : Turkish Foreign Ministry declared its condemnation of the coup attempt: \\"Turkey opposes all attempts to illegally overthrow democratically elected governments\\". * : Alluding to the coup attempt, President Muhammadu Buhari said \\"The military officers in Gabon should understand that the era of military coups and governments in Africa and indeed worldwide, is long gone\\". * : President Idriss Deby, who is also the current head of the Economic Community of Central African States, also condemned the coup attempt and applauded the swift action taken by Gabonese defense and security forces in quashing the coup.

He is played by Ian Ziering in all the films. He is a positive hero, protecting his family and the rest of the world from the evil sharks and hurricanes that bring sharks from the sea to land.  History  = Sharknado = Fin's life before the events of the first film is unknown. It is only known that Fin was a surfer and rested on the beach of Los Angeles with his friends Baz and Nova. Suddenly, a waterspout arrived from the sea, which brought a thousand sharks to Los Angeles, which in turn began killing people and destroying houses. Shepherd together with friends go in search of his wife April and his teenage daughter Claudia. During the trip to the family, the group of Fin stops on the way to save people, because they are attacked by sharks due to floods. During the journey, George and Colleen were killed. Having found their family, Alex Matt Fin's son joins them and they flee and hide in a warehouse, where they come up with a plan to stop the tornade, namely, to blow them up. During the operation, Nova and Matt take a helicopter with bombs and blow two tornadoes out of three, but Nova drops out of a helicopter during a battle with a shark and Matt loses the last bomb. Eventually, Fin himself destroys the last tornado with a bomb attached to his car, and all the sharks begin to fall on the ground. One falling shark flies straight to the rest of the group. Fin jumps into the mouth of one of them and using a chainsaw cuts a shark's belly, thereby freeing himself and Nova. Nova and Matt are happy, and Fin is reuniting with April again. = Sharknado 2: The Second One = After the events of the first film, Fin is possible before the events of the Sharknado 2 in a row, wrote a new book and decided to fly to New York with April to present his book. However, there are new tornadoes, also filled with sharks, and one of them gets a plane Fin and April. Bursting on board, sharks kill pilots and many passengers. However, Fina manages to land the plane, and his wife loses her hand. Suddenly they fell on the City Field, and the two Sharks of the Tornado unite in huge curtains. Fin and his childhood friend Skye are trying to destroy them with bombs, just like last time, April comes from the hospital with a circular saw instead of a hand. (Referring to Ash from Evil Dead) Sky sacrifices himself, allowing Finn and April to destroy Shark Tornado. They explode freon cylinders, destroying all marine predators. Finn manages to ride the great white shark with chains and put it on the antenna. In one of the dead sharks, he finds April's hand with a wedding ring. He takes it and offers his ex-wife to renew their marriage, and she agrees. After that, Fin becomes a hero, April gets pregnant again and flies to Florida / Florida last month. Eight months later, Fin arrives in Washington, where he receives the Presidential Medal of Freedom for his feat in New York, when a new shark tornado collapses in Washington. = Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No! = The tornado destroys the White House, and sharks kill several guests of honor of the ceremony, guards and the president, so Fin is now in charge of his life. Together they kill dozens of sharks, and then the tornado suddenly disappears. Fin decides to go to Florida to herald the family about the next whirlwind, but all flights from Washington were canceled, then Fin takes the car to get to Orlando. Along the way, he again gets into a shark tornado and meets Nova with Lucas and they are steeper than Fin himself. Fin, Nova and Lucas are sent on a specially equipped bus to the south, in Orlando. The bridge over the river, to the other side of which they need, is destroyed by a tornado, so the trio goes to the Charleston military air base located nearby. Its commander is General Gottlieb and old acquaintance Fina. He highlights the trinity of the old plane, used for training flights. The shark tornado attacks the base and Lucas dies, activating the anti-shark device on the bus, and Fin and Nova take off, continuing on their way to Orlando. After some time, Fin and Nova fly up to the track ‚ÄúDaytona 500‚Äù, where the race is held NASCAR ‚Äù, and at the same time a shark tornado covers the track. Fin and Nova dump a spare fuel tank into the center of the tornado and blow it up, weakening the tornado and destroying the sharks in it. One of the sharks is facing a fighter and he loses control. Fin barely puts the plane into the water at Universal Orlando and together, Novaya goes ashore. Soon the family of Fina was again assembled: he finds his wife, daughter and mother-in-law May. Fin with his family and Nova are sent to Cape Canaveral on racing cars. On the way, they visit a restaurant where Fin communicates with his father, Colonel NASA. For the destruction of shark tornadoes over East Coast that can connect and become incredibly destructive, you need the help of the military. For this, Fin expects to use Space Shuttle. Fin and his father are going to start off on a spacecraft into space, but April is trying to dissuade her husband from this insane antics. As a result, three astronauts are on the shuttle, not two, and the launch is canceled due to a closely approaching tornado. Comes to the aid of Nova, taking off on a fighter. The space shuttle takes off, the astronauts drop a bomb and a full external space shuttle on a tornado, explode them, and Fin and his father go into orbit. Because of the tornado, the colonel suggests using the power of satellites. The colonel takes off to the satellite and uses a pillar of fire from the satellite to destroy the shark tornado. It turns out that there is little fuel in the canoe, and therefore there is no possibility to pick up the colonel from the IDF satellite; and then the shuttle is attacked by sharks in space. April's huge shark swallows whole, but Fin, leaving behind the crumbling ship, rushes to the shark with a jetpack and swallows him whole. Then, using parachutes, Fin makes a soft landing inside the Entering the atmosphere of a charred shark. He and a shark get out of a shark, and then April gives birth to a son, which they, along with Fin, call in honor of Gilber's grandfather. Suddenly, in April falls a certain spacecraft. After this, many, including Fin himself, believed that she was dead. However, in fourth film it turns out that she still survived.Sharknado 4 confirmed by Syfy as third film premieres –Ω–∞ —Å–∞–π—Ç–µ bbc.com, 23 –∏—é–ª—è 2015–§–∏–ª–∏–∞–Ω–∞ –ù–≥.

Tara Reid's Character is Alive in Sharknado 4, But How? –Ω–∞ —Å–∞–π—Ç–µ etonline.com, 22 –∏—é–Ω—è 2016 = Sharknado: The 4th Awakens = In the five years since the previous film, Fin has moved to a farm in Kansas named \\"April's Acres,\\" where he lives with his mother Raye and young son Gil. April is believed dead after being crushed by the wreckage of the space shuttle. Tech mogul Aston Reynolds (based on Tesla, Inc. co-founder and SpaceX founder Elon Musk) has developed a new type of high-speed space travel with his company Astro-X (a play on SpaceX), which was used to save Fin's father, Colonel Gilbert Shepard, from the moon. Astro-X has also developed a technology that is capable of using radio waves to diffuse tornadoes, leading to the end of the sharknado phenomenon. Fin travels to Molong with his cousin Gemini to meet up with his son Matt, who has returned from deployment in Iraq. Meanwhile, Reynolds has built and is opening a shark- themed hotel featuring a giant tank of sharks. While Matt and his fianc√©e, Gabrielle, marry and skydive from a plane, a sandstorm tornado develops that cannot be diffused by Astro-X. The tornado absorbs the water and sharks from Reynolds' hotel, creating the first sharknado in five years. = Sharknado 5: Global Swarming = Following the events of the previous film, Fin and April travel to London with their young son Gil to attend a NATO meeting regarding the escalating sharknado threat. Meanwhile, Nova and her assistants investigate a temple hidden beneath Stonehenge, and Nova summons Fin to aid her. They discover a shrine dedicated to an ancient shark god and collect an artifact, which has the unforeseen consequence of unleashing a new type of sharknado with a dimensional vortex inside it. The sharknado heads toward London, and Fin rallies the Buckingham Palace guards to defeat it. They manage to survive the sharknado, but Gil is pulled into the storm and vanishes. = The Last Sharknado: It's About Time = Immediately following the events of the previous film, with Earth completely devastated from the global sharknado swarm, Fin and his now-adult son Gil travel back 66 million years to the Cretaceous in order to prevent the first sharknado and destroy the phenomena once and for all. Shortly after arriving, Gil vanishes; Fin learns from a message recorded by Gil earlier that due to the instability of the energy needed to time travel, any individual person can only travel back in time once, with any subsequent trips resulting in their disappearance. Travelling forward through time, Fin thwarts Sharknados in Camelot, the War of Independence, and the Wild West, as well as making a trip to a shark- controlled future where he is nearly captured by an android duplicate of April who seeks to create a world of just android doubles of them both. Escaping the android, Fin is able to return to the past and uses the android to destroy the first Sharknado before it can fully form, creating a new timeline where Earth has never been decimated by the Sharknados, Fin once again the bartender he was at the beginning surrounded by his extended family.

Often described as a \\"tiny blonde,\\" Van Riper won many accolades over the course of her multifaceted career.  Biography  = Beginnings = Kay‚Äîthe only child of John Van Riper and Amelia Wright‚Äîwas born in Winona, Minnesota, in 1908; the family would also live in Buffalo, Minnesota, while Van Riper was growing up. After graduating from the University of Minnesota with a degree in education in 1927, she moved to Hollywood in 1929 intending to become a teacher. = Radio career = Soon after arriving in Hollywood, Van Riper found employment as a secretary at a local radio station, where she met radio personality Tom Breneman. Breneman encouraged her to develop her own projects, and soon Van Riper was writing, producing, and starring in her own hit historical drama, English Coronets. She was also the program director and publicist for KFWB. In 1934, she moved to New York briefly to produce English Coronets for the American Broadcasting Service (which soon folded). She moved back to L.A. in 1935 and continued producing the show for KFWB. = Screenwriting career = In 1937, she began working for MGM as a scenarist, contributing to the Andy Hardy franchise as well as several of the studio's biggest musicals, from Babes in Arms to Strike Up the Band. She'd later explain that she drew on her memories of growing up in her small Minnesota town to flesh out the Hardy scripts. She also collaborated with Mary C. McCall Jr. on Kathleen, the film that would bring Shirley Temple out of her brief retirement. Eventually she was earning $1,500 a week as part of her contract. = Personal life = Van Riper rented Rudolph Valentino's former home in Whitley Heights in the 1930s and told a newspaper columnist she'd briefly thought it was haunted. While working as a screenwriter, she split her time between Los Angeles and New York. In 1939, she married producer Russell Lewis, who worked in film and also collaborated with Van Riper on her one-act stage plays. The marriage ended in divorce in 1942. She was in the midst of divorcing her second husband, New York‚Äìbased attorney Robert Wrubel, at the time of her death. = Declining health and eventual death = According to Van Riper's mother, Amelia, Van Riper had suffered from spinal pain that radiated into her legs for more than 20 years, and by early 1948, it had gotten so bad that Van Riper had to give up her career. She'd seen doctors all over the world, and to no avail. Van Riper died on New Year's Eve of 1948 after overdosing on sleeping pills in her Glendale, California, home. Her mother, who was living with her at the time, found her body sitting next to her bed. No note was found, but the coroner classified the death as a suicide.

She is professor of evolutionary biology at the University of Helsinki. Early career Sundstr√∂m gained her doctoral thesis and docentship in 1994. She carried out postdoctoral research at the University of Lausanne during 1994-1995, which was funded by a grant for research from the Academy of Finland as well as employment at the university. She went on to work at the University of Aarhus in the years 1995-1996. In 1996 she returned to the University of Helsinki where she became a lecturer at the Department of Ecology and Systematics. From 1998 to 2002 she worked as an Academy Research Fellow and in 2002 she was appointed Swedish-speaking Professor of Evolutionary Biology (formerly Zoology). Key research contributions Sundstr√∂m is an evolutionary biologist with a focus on social evolution, particularly in ants. The goal is to understand the evolution of altruism in the animal world (in particular the basis of the theory of kin selection) and the balance between altruistic and selfish behaviour which, from an evolutionary perspective, determines the emergence and functioning of social insect societies . Her contribution to our understanding of conflict resolution in the social insects combines multiple approaches: by bringing together behavioural experiments, the analysis of chemical recognition cues, and genetic methods, Sundstr√∂m's work has provided numerous new insights into the complex dynamics of the ant colony. For example, she demonstrated that the number of times an ant queen has mated changes the social conditions in the colony, resulting in worker manipulation of the sex ratio. These findings demonstrate support for the predictions of inclusive fitness theory. Sundstr√∂m has also made significant contributions to population biology, in particular with relation to life history trade-offs. This work is founded on a long-term dataset she has collected by studying a population of the wood ant Formica exsecta in an archipelago near the Tv√§rminne zoological station in southern Finland since 1994. Her work has described patterns of dispersal and inbreeding in this fragmented population.

Given a linear program, it is required to find a feasible solution in which the number of non-zero variables is as small as possible. The problem is known to be NP-hard and even hard to approximate.  Definition  A Min-RVLS problem is defined by: * A binary relation R, which is one of {=, ‚â•, >, ‚â†}; * An m-by-n matrix A (where m is the number of constraints and n the number of variables); * An m-by-1 vector b. The linear system is given by: A x R b. It is assumed to be feasible (i.e., satisfied by at least one x). Depending on R, there are four different variants of this system: A x = b, A x ‚â• b, A x > b, A x ‚â† b. The goal is to find an n-by-1 vector x that satisfies the system A x R b, and subject to that, contains as few as possible nonzero elements.  Special case  The problem Min-RVLS[=] was presented by Garey and Johnson, who called it \\"minimum weight solution to linear equations\\". They proved it was NP-hard, but did not consider approximations.  Applications  The Min-RVLS problem is important in machine learning and linear discriminant analysis. Given a set of positive and negative examples, it is required to minimize the number of features that are required to correctly classify them. The problem is known as the minimum feature set problem. An algorithm that approximates Min-RVLS within a factor of O(\\\\log(m)) could substantially reduce the number of training samples required to attain a given accuracy level. The shortest codeword problem in coding theory is the same problem as Min-RVLS[=] when the coefficients are in GF(2).  Related problems  In MINimum Unsatisfied Linear Relations (Min- ULR), we are given a binary relation R and a linear system A x R b, which is now assumed to be infeasible. The goal is to find a vector x that violates as few relations as possible, while satisfying all the others. Min-ULR[‚â†] is trivially solvable, since any system with real variables and a finite number of inequality constraints is feasible. As for the other three variants: * Min- ULR[=,>,‚â•] are NP-hard even with homogeneous systems and bipolar coefficients (coefficients in {1,-1}). * The NP-complete problem Minimum feedback arc set reduces to Min-ULR[‚â•], with exactly one 1 and one -1 in each constraint, and all right-hand sides equal to 1. * Min-ULR[=,>,‚â•] are polynomial if the number of variables n is constant: they can be solved polynomially using an algorithm of Greer in time O(n\\\\cdot m^n / 2^{n-1}). * Min-ULR[=,>,‚â•] are linear if the number of constraints m is constant, since all subsystems can be checked in time O(n). *Min-ULR[‚â•] is polynomial in some special case. *Min- ULR[=,>,‚â•] can be approximated within n + 1 in polynomial time. *Min-ULR[>,‚â•] are minimum-dominating-set-hard, even with homogeneous systems and ternary coefficients (in {‚àí1,0,1}). *Min-ULR[=] cannot be approximated within a factor of 2^{\\\\log^{1-\\\\varepsilon}n}, for any \\\\varepsilon>0, unless NP is contained in DTIME(n^{\\\\operatorname{polylog}(n)}). In the complementary problem MAXimum Feasible Linear Subystem (Max-FLS), the goal is to find a maximum subset of the constraints that can be satisfied simultaneously. * Max-FLS[‚â†] can be solved in polynomial time. * Max-FLS[=] is NP-hard even with homogeneous systems and bipolar coefficients. * . With integer coefficients, it is hard to approximate within m^{\\\\varepsilon}. With coefficients over GF[q], it is q-approximable. * Max-FLS[>] and Max-FLS[‚â•] are NP-hard even with homogeneous systems and bipolar coefficients. They are 2-approximable, but they cannot be approximated within any smaller constant factor.  Hardness of approximation  All four variants of Min-RVLS are hard to approximate. In particular all four variants cannot be approximated within a factor of 2^{\\\\log^{1-\\\\varepsilon}n}, for any \\\\varepsilon>0, unless NP is contained in DTIME(n^{\\\\operatorname{polylog}(n)}). The hardness is proved by reductions: * There is a reduction from Min-ULR[=] to Min-RVLS[=]. It also applies to Min- RVLS[‚â•] and Min-RVLS[>], since each equation can be replaced by two complementary inequalities. * There is a reduction from minimum-dominating-set to Min-RVLS[‚â†]. On the other hand, there is a reduction fro Min-RVLS[=] to Min-ULR[=]. It also applies to Min-ULR[‚â•] and Min-ULR[>], since each equation can be replaced by two complementary inequalities. Therefore, when R is in {=,>,‚â•}, Min-ULR and Min-RVLS are equivalent in terms of approximation hardness.

A-hua is the night market's managing director and, responsible for mediating night market disputes to protect the interests of the vendors. One night, Lin Yi-nan, a female reporter, was riding her motorcycle and collided with Hsiao-chi near the night market. When A-hua met Lin Yi-nan, his heart unconsciously opened. However, since their meeting, Lin Yi-nan's life fell into chaos ‚Äì at work, she was severely criticized by her supervisor; her boyfriend broke up with her; and she was sentenced to community service at 888 Night Market as a punishment for destroying an electric circuit. The friendliness of A-hua and the vendors gradually dispelled the loneliness that Lin Yi-nan felt in a foreign place, and their relationship was no longer tense. Later, a construction company purchased the land where 888 Night Market was located, bribed legislator Chang Chin-liang, and threatened to close the market. The vendors‚Äô livelihoods were at risk. What was worse, the construction company also employed gangsters to damage the night market. To protect the night market, A-hua led the vendors to protest and work with media to reveal the stories of their hardships and dreams. In the end, the night market was preserved.

Following his speech, while hugging and thanking well-wishers who had attended the event, he gave a kiss to his friend Greg Campora, and a photograph of that kiss accompanied most media coverage of his announcement.

She has published studies on differences between the East and West German women's movements and the influence of the European unification process. She dealt early on with issues of research ethics and instigated the founding of an ethics committee within the German Educational Research Association (DGfE). She has been the chair of this committee since its founding. As a cofounder of the Network on Reconstructive Social Work, Miethe has contributed to the development of reconstructive research in social work. Since 2008 she has been coeditor of the series Reconstructive Research in Social Work. She is coeditor of a manual on qualitative methods in social work.Bock, Karin und Miethe, Ingrid (Hg.) (2010): Handbuch Qualitative Methoden in der Sozialen Arbeit; Opladen & Farmington Hills: Budrich. She has also written on the transfer of qualitative methods in the practice of social work.

Miethe has also focused on the relationship between education and social inequality, both in international comparison ‚Äì as in the study of the workers' faculties ‚Äì and in independent studies. She studied the issue both as part of the project ArbeiterKind.deMiethe et al.

In June 2013, Durga Shakti Nagpal launched a massive crackdown on illegal mining. On 23 July 2013, Nagpal had said that she would take strict action against dredgers engaged in illegal mining, adding that such activity could affect the environmental adversely. Since April 2013, the Uttar Pradesh Police had filed 17 FIRs and the Chief Judicial magistrates had ordered the arrest of illegal sand miners in 22 cases. From April to June 2013, the police had impounded 297 vehicles and machinery used for illegal mining and collected Rs in fines. Under Nagpal, a joint operation involving the revenue, police and transport departments was launched and villages of Asgarpur, Nangla Wajidpur, Gulavli, Kambakshpur, Jaganpur Chaproli were monitored. On 25 July, the government transferred the mining officer of the GB Nagar district Ashish Kumar, who was assisting Nagpal, to Bulandshahr. Before being transferred, Kumar survived three attempts on his life, the last one was on 9 February 2013. Nagpal was also targeted on 26 April 2013, during a visit to the Kasna police station.

He discovered the genetic basis of childhood diabetes and popularised the classification of diabetes into type 1 and type 2. Biography Andrew Cudworth was born in 1939 and graduated from the University of Liverpool School of Medicine in 1963. He joined the British Army as a medical officer after his graduation, serving for five years and earning the rank of major. He commenced physician training in Liverpool in 1971. He published his first paper, about immunology, in 1972; his second paper, published in 1972, was a case report on a patient with diabetes. His scientific interest in diabetes and immunology led him to discover soon afterwards that the more severe form of diabetes, which necessitated insulin and usually occurred in children, was linked to a specific genetic marker, and could be detected on a blood test. Recognising the difference between juvenile-onset, insulin-dependent diabetes and mature- onset, non-insulin-dependent diabetes, Cudworth began using the terminology of type 1 and type 2 diabetes in 1976. The classification of diabetes into type 1 and type 2 was first used by Philip Hugh-Jones in a 1955 paper, but the terminology was revived and popularised by Cudworth. This remains the common terminology to differentiate the two forms of diabetes mellitus. Previously, the classification of diabetes was based on the age of onset ‚Äì either juvenile or mature ‚Äì whereas Cudworth's classification system was based on genetics. In 1977, Cudworth was appointed a consultant physician at St Bartholomew's and Hackney Hospitals in London, where he also lectured at St Bartholomew's Hospital Medical College. He established the diabetic service at Hackney Hospital and collaborated with David J. Galton in the diabetic clinic at Barts. He became editor-in-chief of the international journal Diabetologia in 1980. He died in 1982 from a glioma.

He is professor for virology and the director of the Institute of virology and HIV Research at the University Bonn. Early life and education Streeck studied medicine at the Charite University, Berlin. After his graduation he started to work as a postdoctoral fellow at the Ragon Institute of Massachusetts General Hospital, MIT and Harvard Medical School and obtained his PhD from the University of Bonn, and part-time at the Partners AIDS Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School.  Career  In 2009 Streeck was promoted to Instructor in Medicine and in 2011 to Assistant Professor at Harvard Medical School. In September 2012 he was recruited to the United States Military HIV Research Program, Bethesda, where he became the Chief of the Cellular Immunology Section as well as Assistant Professor at the Uniformed Services University of Health Sciences and adjunct faculty of the Bloomberg School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins University. In 2015 he became the Chair for Medical Biology at the University Duisburg-Essen and founded the Institute for HIV Research in the same year, though he still maintains the status of \\"visiting scientist\\" with the US Military HIV Research Program. In 2018, Streeck was appointed to the advisory board of the German AIDS Foundation (Deutsche AIDS Stiftung). In April 2020, he was appointed by Minister- President Armin Laschet of North Rhine-Westphalia to a 12-member expert group to advise on economic and social consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany.Kristian Frigelj (April 1, 2020), Zw√∂lfk√∂pfiges Gremium: Armin Laschet gr√ºndet ‚ÄûExpertenrat Corona‚Äú Die Welt. =HIV research= Under Streek's direction the Institute for HIV Research works on several prevention methods against HIV including the development and feasibility of HIV vaccines as well as Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). A particular focus for HIV vaccine development is to understand how T follicular helper (Tfh) cells can drive protective antibody responses during the germinal center reaction. Further research areas of the institute include understanding why some co-morbidities, such as cancer or cardiovascular diseases, are more prone to develop in chronic HIV infection and whether strategies can be developed to suppress HIV viral loads in the absence of antiretroviral therapy. Some of these studies are being performed in Maputo, Mozambique, where he leads a PhD sandwich program with the Instituto Nacionale de Saude to train and retain young physician scientists. =STI research= Streeck actively investigates the epidemiology, novel prevention and treatment options of other sexually transmitted infections (STI). Currently, he conducts the largest systematic study for STIs in Germany (BRAHMS study) which seeks to understand who is becoming infected with which STI. In January 2019 the BRAHMS study was expanded to other European countries including France, Italy, Spain, Poland and Hungary under the name STIPnet study. In parallel, a European HIV & STI prevention network will be established He has been nominated as the co-chair of International AIDS conference IAS 2021 in Berlin. =Coronavirus research= In early April 2020, Streeck and his team reported with reference to their COVID-19 Case-Cluster-Study that they had \\"carried out an intensive search of the home of a family infected with the coronavirus but found no trace of it on surfaces.\\"  Awards  * 2015 ‚Äì 15 HIV Advocates to Watch in 2015 * 2014 ‚Äì People Magazine ‚ÄúSexiest Scientist‚Äù 2014 * 2011 ‚Äì Young Investigator Award, Collaborative AIDS Vaccine Discovery (CAVD) Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation * 2010 ‚Äì Young Investigator Award, 17th CROI, San Francisco, CA * 2009 ‚Äì Biennial German AIDS Award (DAIG-Award) * 2009 ‚Äì New Investigator Award, AIDS Vaccine Conference, Paris, 2009 * 2009 ‚Äì New Investigator Award, 16th CROI, Montreal, Canada * 2008 ‚Äì Young Investigator Award, World AIDS Conference, Mexico City,2008 * 2008 ‚Äì New Investigator Award, AIDS Vaccine Conference, Cape Town,2008 * 2008 ‚Äì NIH Scholarship 2008, HIV-Vaccine, Keystone, Banff, 2008 * 2008 ‚Äì Young Investigator Award, 15th CROI, Boston, MA * 2007 ‚Äì Young Investigator Award, 14th CROI, Los Angeles, CA * 2006 ‚Äì Young Investigator Award, 13th CROI, Denver, CO * 2006 ‚Äì Young Investigator Award, World AIDS Conference, Toronto, 2006. * 2005 ‚Äì Young Investigator Award, HIV-Pathogenesis, Keystone, Banff, 2005  Associations  * American Society for Microbiology (ASM) * American Association of Immunologists (AAI) * German Association of University Professors (Deutscher Hochschulverband)  Works  = Books/Chapters = * H.

They governed the Tanjore, Trichy and Pudukottai regions between 600-900 CE. According to scholars, Earliest known line of Andhra Cholas Who were the descendants of the great King Karikala were found in Renadu or Maharajapadi ( king's country ) from about the beginning of the sixth to the middle of the ninth century A.D. The family seems to have begun its rule at Erigal or Nidugal in the Tumkur district on the borderland between the Pallava and Kadamba dominions. The earliest king of whom we hear is Nandivarman, ( A.D. 500 ) whose name indicates a subordinate relation to the Pallavas of Kanchi. Of the three sons of Nandivarman, The Eldest - Simhavishnu ( another Pallava name ). The younger brothers of Simhavishnu were Sundarananda and Dhananjaya, the latter being described as Erigal Mutturaju Dhananjaya ruling Renadu. All the brothers seems to have simultaneously ruled in different areas according to the Malepadu plates of Punyakumara. A brief genealogy of these clan was drawn by K. A. Nilakanta Sastri with the help of Melapadu plates Dhananjaya was followed by his son Navarama or Mahendra vikrama I Chola Maharaja (AD.600) He holds the title Muditasilakshara, justified by his well - chiselled stone inscriptions. Adhiraja Srikantha - A Pottapi Chola, who is the king of Mylapore \\\\- which is the south east part of Renadu. He is also called as Ottriyuran as he is from Ottriyur region. ( Today's Tiruvottiyur ) We are able to trace Srikantha's ancestors with the help of an Eastern Chalukyan king's Copper plate grants, Anbil plates of Parantaka Chola II and it's clear that he is from the lineage of Sundarananda, who is the 2nd son of Nandivarma Chola. Also from Velanjeri plates of Parantaka I & Anbil plates, its clear that Adhiraja Srikantha is the father of Vijayalaya Chola, who is founder of the Imperial Chola dynasty. Here we can see that Sundarananda was succeeded by the son (Navarama alias Mahendra vikrama I Chola Maharaja) of his younger brother Dhananjaya, its nothing wrong if we consider Sundarananda had Left no child. at first, Navarama was subordinate of Simhavishnu and Mahendra varman I of Kanchi, as evidenced by the resemblance of his titles with those of Mahendra - varman, he seems to have affirmed his independence later just like Simhavishnu Choda. He had a dugaraja ( Yuvaraja ) of Erigal under him, possibly his eldest son Gunamudita. The youngest son Punyakumara was Mutturaja of Erigal and over southern Renadu with Chippili as his capital. After Gunamudita's rule as king ( 620-25 ), he succeeded him in the rule of Renadu with Malepadu as capital. During the 7th to 8th centuries, the Mutharaiyar served as feudatories of the Pallava dynasty and controlled the fertile plains of the Kaveri region. An inscription in the Vaikuntha Perumal temple in Kanchipuram mentions a Mutharaiyar chief receiving Nandivarman II at the latter's coronation. According to historian T. A. Gopinatha Rao, this chief was Suvaran Maaran (also called Perumbidigu Muthurayar II). The Sendalai inscription of Suvaran Maran states that Tanjore and Vallam were under his control.

The district existed from 1929 to 1959.  Location  Kanino-Timansky district on a map of Nenetsia Kanino- Timansky district was located in the far west of the Nenets Autonomous Okrug, on the Kanin Peninsula and some of the mainland, and close to the Timan Ridge, which is probably where the district got its name from. Its territory was mostly formed in a curve around Chosha Bay.  History  The district was formed on 15 July 1929, from a part of the Mezensky District of the Arkhangelsk Governorate. The administrative center of the district was the settlement of Nizhnyaya Pyosha. As of 1 January 1939, the district had an area of 53,100km2 and it had a population of 2,700. It included 16 settlements in 4 selsoviets. In 1939, the number of selsoviets had increased to 6: * Indigsky * Malozemelsky * Nessky * Omsky * Pyoshsky * Shoynsky By 1940, this number had increased again to 7 and the district itself increased in size to 63,500km2. In 1959, all of the districts in the Nenets Autonomous Okrug, including Kanino-Timansky district, were abolished and became directly subordinated to Naryan-Mar. Today, the former territory of Kanino-Timansky district is a part of the Zapolyarny District, the only one in the Nenets AO.  Media  One newspaper company, called \\"The Socialist Arctic\\", existed in the district from 1932 until the district was abolished.

It was opened in two stages and by two railway companies. The line from Weesen via to was opened on 15 February 1859 by the United Swiss Railways (Vereinigte Schweizerbahnen, VSB). It was opened with the ‚Äì‚ÄìWeesen line. The line from Glarus via to was opened on 1 June 1879 by the Swiss Northeastern Railway (Schweizerische Nordostbahn). The Lake Z√ºrich left-bank railway, which was built by the Swiss Northeastern Railway, was extended from Ziegelbr√ºcke to N√§fels-Mollis station on 20 September 1875. This line took over much of the traffic between Weesen and N√§fels-Mollis, making the old line unprofitable. Therefore, the line was closed by the SBB on 1 January 1931 and later dismantled. Weesen station was relocated on the occasion of the opening of the double-track line on 18 May 1969. There was a connection in Schwanden to the metre-gauge Sernftal tramway between 7 August 1905 and 31 May 1969. The line was electrified on 15 May 1933 at 15 kV AC 162/3 Hz.  Stations Initially, all stations had at least one bay platform apart from the main platform (with only one turnout on one side). The only exception was Leuggelbach, which as a result has always been classified as a halt. The halt of was opened at the timetable change on 23 May 1982, when the clock-face timetable was also introduced. This new halt is located immediately adjacent to the base station of the Braunwald Funicular, which simplified the transfer from the rail network to the funicular to Braunwald. No crossing loops were planned in , and R√ºti, as they would have been difficult to install because of the bay platforms. A rolling stock depot was established in Glarus with two locomotive sheds and a turntable. Glarus station was extensively renovated in 2016 and 2017 so that platform 2 is now accessible via an underpass and the locomotive sheds have been renovated. However, they are no longer used for storing trains and can only be used by non-electrically hauled rolling stock because of the lack of overhead lines. The former Glarus depot was replaced by the Ziegelbr√ºcke depot. The and R√ºti stations were reclassified as halts on 2 June 1984. Mitl√∂di station was similarly reclassified at the 1985 timetable change. Except for the track infrastructure in Schwanden, all sets of points and additional track infrastructure between Glarus and Linthal was upgraded at the end of the 1990s and the beginning of the 2000s. There is now only one track between Glarus and Linthal. The only remaining stations with crossing loops are , Glarus, Schwanden and Linthal. It is possible for trains to cross in N√§fels-Mollis and Netstal and this can occur in case of disruption of normal services, but both stations only have one regular 55 cm-high platform each, so embarking and disembarking passengers would only be possible for one of the crossing trains. Currently (as of April 2018), the Netstal station has an old, non-standard platform on track 2 and this could be used during a disruption of operations, but it would require special provisions.  Operations The route is served by hourly services on line S25 of the Zurich S-Bahn. It replaced the Glarner Sprinter in June 2014 and serves all stations on this line as well as , , , and Z√ºrich HB. This is the first time there have been hourly services to Zurich. Services on line S 6 of the St. Gallen S-Bahn also run on the Ziegelbr√ºcke‚ÄìSchwanden route hourly, resulting in a half- hourly cycle.  Extension plans An extension of the route to the south to in the canton of Ticino, connecting to the Gotthard Railway towards was considered around 1900. In 1963, the Schweizerische Aktionskomitee pro T√∂di- Greina-Bahn (Swiss Action Committee for the T√∂di-Greina Railway), which had representatives from several cantonal governments, commissioned a study to examine the feasibility of a T√∂di‚ÄìGreina railway. These plans were not pursued.

Virdi retired from the Metropolitan Police in 2012 following what he described as institutional racism and discrimination within the Police Force. Early life Virdi grew up in Southall, London. His education started with the bussing out programme during which immigrant ethnic minority children were dispersed across schools in the hope that it would help them integrate.. After completing full-time education, Virdi worked at Beecham Products (GlaxoSmithKline), based in Hounslow Metropolitan Police In 1982, Gurpal Virdi joined the Metropolitan Police as the first officer of Asian descent from Hounslow to join the police force. Virdi worked both in active uniform service and within the Criminal Investigation Department (plainclothes detectives). During his thirty years‚Äô service, he was very vocal in challenging the mistreatment of ethnic minority communities. By his retirement in 2012, Virdi was recognised for 30 years of exemplary performance within the Metropolitan Police. =Dismissal and acquittal= In 1998, whilst serving on neighbouring Ealing Division he was arrested and accused of sending race hate mail to his colleagues. Virdi was one of 13 black and Asian officers who received a printed image of a black man accompanied by the message: ‚ÄúNot wanted. Keep the police force white, so leave now or else‚Äù. Scotland Yard claimed that Mr Virdi himself had sent the mail, sparked by anger at being turned down for promotion. He was dismissed from the police in 2000. The subsequent employment tribunal case exonerated Virdi and led to the Metropolitan Police Authority Virdi Inquiry report, published in 2002. Virdi was issued with a full written apology by the Commissioner, Sir John Stevens,. before returning to work in 2002. An investigation by Peter Marshall (journalist) into Virdi's wrongful dismissal was awarded the RIMA (Race In The Media Award). Virdi retired from the Metropolitan Police in 2012, following what he described as institutional racism and discrimination within the Police Force. Later life In 2012, Virdi carried the Olympic Torch from Richmond to Hounslow on Kew Bridge as part of the 2012 Summer Olympics torch relay. Virdi was elected as a local councillor for the London Borough of Hounslow between May 2014 and May 2018, representing Labour for the majority of his time. He trained to become a tutor for Adult Education and worked with vulnerable people. He also worked as a Youth Justice Panel member. =Accusation of indecent assault= In 2014, Virdi was accused of indecent assault on 7 November 1986. The accuser told police that Mr Virdi had attacked him and shoved a retractable police baton up his backside in the back of a prison van, though such batons were not in use in Britain at the time of the alleged attack. In July 2015, Gurpal was acquitted at Southwark Crown Court on 31 July 2015 of any wrongdoing. During the trial, Mr Virdi accused the Met of bringing the criminal case against him as part of a 17-year campaign to \\"hound\\" him out of the force. The case of Gurpal Virdi was subsequently picked up by Sir Peter Bottomley in 1998, notable as previously Member of Parliament and advocate at the time of the murder of Stephen Lawrence. Bottomley requested that the Home Secretary, at that point Theresa May, review the case. In March 2018 Bottomley submitted an Early Day Motion, calling for a parliamentary debate on the matter. On 28 March Sir Peter successfully requested to meet with the Prime Minister Theresa May to discuss the matter and how to eradicate institutionalised racism from such important establishments as the Metropolitan Police. Virdi authored the book Behind the Blue Line published in 2018 by Biteback, detailing Virdi's fight against racism and discrimination in the Metropolitan Police.

Background  = Education = Consalvo was born in 1969 in Biddeford, Maine. She received her BA in Communications from Lyndon State College in Vermont. She subsequently received her MA in Communications from the University of Washington, and her PhD in Mass Communications from the University of Iowa. = Activities = Consalvo held the post of president of the Digital Games Research Association (DiGRA) from 2012 to 2016. She previously held the post of president of the Association of Internet Researchers (AoIR) from 2009 to 2011. Consalvo's research focus has included cheating in online games. According to her research, cheating for real world profit has been occurring for at least two decades, costing the video game industry millions of dollars. A common form of cheating involves the use of ‚Äúbots‚Äù designed to automate certain game processes and gather materials valuable in a particular game, and selling these game materials to other players. Consalvo's research has included a study on online gender swapping and demonstrated clear differences between online gaming behaviour among male and female players. According to Consalvo, males playing games using female avatars still display male patterns of movement. Additionally, these players act differently from actual female players in chat conversations. Consalvo has also researched bullying of females, LGBT and minority players in games, pointing to the frequency of in-game bullying as an indicator of the state of online gaming culture. On the topic of video games and violence, Consalvo found that sport-themed video games actually produced positive feelings among users.  Books  * Atari to Zelda.

After the ban on female participation in political organisation was revoked in 1908 she involved herself in politics in the Frankfurt region (SPD). Though described in one source as \\"not a believing Jew\\", it is apparent from sources that Henriette F√ºrth's Jewish provenance was hugely important to her throughout her life. She died in 1938, before the full horrors of the Shoah unfolded. Two of her daughters died in concentration camps, however. Biography Henriette Katzenstein was born in Gie√üen. After her brother Jacob died in 1867 she was the eldest of her parents' five remaining children. Siegmund Katzenstein (1835-1889), her father, was a Jewish timber merchant. Her mother, born Sophie Loeb (1835-1918), had also grown up in Gie√üen. Sophie Katzenstein was deeply committed to her Jewish faith, and the children grew up celebrating the Jewish festivals. Siegmund Katzenstein came from a family with strong priestly roots, but wore his religion more lightly, tending towards religious liberalism. He was an actively engaged member of the Progressive Party (\\"Deutsche Fortschrittspartei\\") and of the local business community. According to more than one source, Henriette was her father's favourite among his four daughters: she was clearly influenced by his liberal beliefs. Ludwig B√∂rne and the famously liberal Frankfurter Zeitung (newspaper) framed the family's politics.Irmgard Maya Fassmann: J√ºdinnen in der deutschen Frauenbewegung, 1865-1919, p. 270 ff, 1995 Henriette was not the only one of the five siblings to inherit her father's taste for politics. The Katzenstein girls' only surviving brother, the lawyer Simon Katzenstein, to whom Henriette was particularly close, was a pioneering socialist politician who would die in political exile in Sweden shortly before the end of the Second World War. After successful completion of her schooling locally, with her father's consent, she accepted the offer of a place at the teachers' training college attached to the Elisabethenschule (secondary school) in nearby Frankfurt. However, before the start of her first term her father withdrew his consent: he said that, being Jewish, she would never be offered a teaching job in a school. Another issue which would have arisen if she had been able to find a job as a teacher in a state school was the convention of those times whereby women teachers were expected to remain celibate or, if they married, to abandon their teaching careers. A few years later Henriette Katzenstein, still aged just nineteen, married a distant cousin, Wilhelm F√ºrth. He was a businessman, seven years her senior, and related through her mother's family. The couple lived initially in Wilhelm's home town, Darmstadt, and then moved to Frankfurt in 1885. By 1899 Henriette had given birth to eight children, six girls and two boys. The two youngest were twins. However, family matters did not fully consume her energies even at this stage, and she was able to resume the truncated progress of her education. She attended the Freies Deutsches Hochstift (educational institution), studying at the applied economics section (\\"volkswirtschaftliche Sektion\\"). Encouraged by her brother, in 1890 she began to publish articles of \\"social criticism\\", and over time was able to contribute usefully to the household budget from her talks and written pieces. Using the pseudonym G.Stein, she also began to contribute articles on \\"Jewish themes\\". Other topics that she favoured included (but were by no means restricted to) mother and child protection, household economics, population reduction, combating sexually transmitted diseases and compulsory celibacy for certain classes of career women, along with votes for women. Overall she is believed to have published around 200 articles and 30 more substantial works. Henrietta F√ºrth represented that part of the proletarian women's movement that was oriented towards the SPD. As early as 1896 she distanced herself from the formidable Clara Zetkin when she rejected the ideal of a separation between the \\"bourgeois\\" and \\"proletarian\\" women's movements. Her own economic situation was conventionally middle class: for a time the F√ºrths employed two household servants. However, as her husband's leather wholesaling business declined and then, in 1901, went bankrupt she had to go out to work, first as a housing inspector and later as a paid secretary with the \\"Israelitische Hilfsverein\\". She was subsequently employed as a journalist and in public relations work for the National Private Welfare Centre (\\"Zentrale f√ºr private F√ºrsorge\\", as it was then known). Around this time she also teamed up with Bertha Pappenheim, founding the \\"Weibliche F√ºrsorge\\" to work on women's welfare issues, but, on account of \\"considerable differences\\" between the two women, little \\"fruitful collaboration\\" came of the partnership. Between 1897 and 1915 the Sozialistische Monatshefte published 13 substantial articles by F√ºrth. From 1901 till 1907 she was also a regular contributor to the publication's special \\"Women's Movement\\" (\\"Frauenbewegung\\") section, reporting on developments both domestically and abroad. Her last major publication, appearing in 1929, was entitled \\"Die Regelung der Nachkommenschaft als eugenisches Problem\\" (loosely, \\"Regulating descendency issues as a problem in eugenics\\"). Influenced by contemporary discussion of Neo-Malthisianism she had long stressed the importance of social policy measures for the improvement of public health. Now, in addition to the rational application of modern methods of contraception and advocacy of pre-marital health-certificates \\"in very precisely defined and limited circumstances\\", she was suggesting sterilisation in the case of inherited serious illness.Michael Schwartz: Sozialistische Eugenik: Eugenische Sozialtechnologien in Debatten und Politik der deutschen Sozialdemokratie 1890-1933. Berlin 1995, pp. 66‚Äì69. In 1905 F√ºrth became a founding member of the Berlin group for the Deutscher Bund f√ºr Mutterschutz (loosely, \\"Association for Mothers' Protection\\"). She was a member of the \\"Deutsches Gesellschaft zur Bek√§mpfung der Geschlechtskrankheiten\\" (\\"... for combatting sexually transmitted diseases\\"). She later became the first woman to be accepted for membership of the German Sociological Association. During the First World War, with her daughters, Henriette F√ºrth set up meal kitchens for the urban poor. in political terms, she backed the party leadership. Both her sons fought in the army and returned badly wounded. After the war F√ºrth continued her hands-on welfare work with renewed energy. rightthumb Henriette F√ºrth, \\"Wohnbedarf und Kinderzahl\\", Leipzig 1907. Military defeat was followed by a wave of revolutions in the German ports and cities, widespread economic destitution and a new republican constitution whereby all citizens were eligible for public office, without discrimination, based on their abilities. Gender discrimination toward female civil servants was also abolished (¬ß 128). Between 1919 and 1924 Henriette F√ºrth served as an SPD Frankfurt city councillor. According to one source she stood, unsuccessfully, as a candidate for membership of the \\"National Assembly\\". On the city council she was a member of the Finance Committee and also held positions of responsibility in respect of the schools service, health and nutrition. She also set up a free legal advice office. It seems to have been a cause for permanent regret by F√ºrth that she herself had never received a university education. She was now nevertheless able to accept an invitation to join the oversight board (\\"Kuratorium\\") of Frankfurt University. F√ºrth also engaged with the Frankfurt based Institute for the Common Good (\\"Institut f√ºr Gemeinwohl\\") and the socialist \\"Workers' Welfare\\" organisation (\\"Arbeiterwohlfahrt\\" / AWO). The National Socialists took power in January 1933 and lost no time in transforming Germany into a one-party dictatorship. Antisemitism, till now little more politically than the basis for shrill offensive sloganising, quickly became a core underpinning of government strategy. Henriette F√ºrth was quickly stripped of all her offices and then served with a \\"Berufsverbot\\" (loosely, \\"professional ban\\"). She had been widowed the previous year, and now moved to Bad Ems where she lived quietly in the house of her son-in-law, the district rabbi Friedrich Laupheimer (1890-1965). When she died there on 1 June 1938 her passing, in Hitler's Germany, went largely unnoticed at the time.  Family  Two of Henriette F√ºrth's daughters married Eduard Adelaar (1879-1943) and Henri Adelaar (1881-1944) two Dutch brothers from Deventer. In 1940 it became clear that this time the Netherlands would not be able to stay out of the war. During the occupation the German authorities applied race laws that had already been implemented in Germany. Citizens were required to demonstrate that none of their four grandparents had been Jewish. The Adelaars were deported. Elizabeth Adelaar-F√ºrth was killed at Sobib√≥r on 16 July 1943. Marie Anna Adelaar-F√ºrth was killed at Sobib√≥r or at Auschwitz in 1943 or 1944. Henriette F√ºrth's other six children managed to escape with their families to Palestine or England.

However, the third album needed to be produced due to contractual obligations with MGM Records. Female lead vocalist Barbara Hudson and drummer Russell Levine were the only surviving members, while guitarist Ted Myers agreed to return after a year out. The Ultimate Spinach sextet was completed with three new musicians from other Boston local rock bands. In consequence, this album lacks the creative genius of Ian Bruce-Douglas: the sound and structures are not very experimental and the content of the lyrics is more conventional instead of the frequently \\"lysergic\\", dark and introspective which is present in their two previous concept albums. Ted Myers and Tony Scheuren, ex bandmates in Chamaeleon Church, wrote most songs (some of them, even individually), while the rest of the band was reunited only for exhausting rehearsals and recording sessions, made in just nine days in Mayfair Studios, New York, in December of 1968. The result was a very inconsistent album with a mix of psychedelic, hard rock and pop styles that sounded like the work of several different bands.

Biography Dain was born in 1994 in the small village of Yakel on Tanna island, Tafea Province. The village, which had no electricity, is home to approximately 200 residents. Yakel, which is part of a sharing economy network consisting of several other Tanna villages, utilizes goods such as pigs, yams, and taro as its form of currency. According to Terry Adlington, the managing director of the Tanna Coffee Development Company, which works with Yakel residents, Dain was \\"a key participant in the everyday life of his village and the community at large.\\" =Tanna= Australian directors Martin Butler and Bentley Dean developed the screenplay for their film Tanna in collaboration with Yakel's villagers and other local residents. The film is based on the true story of a ni-Vanuatu village couple who fell in love during the 1980s. In the movie, a young woman, Wawa (played by Marie Wawa), is destined for an arranged marriage as part of a peace deal with a warring tribe. However, Wawa falls in love with the grandson of her village chief, Dain (played by Mungau Dain). However, the couple's families would not allow them to marry and they committed suicide. The real-life events and themes of forbidden love bare similarities with Romeo and Juliet. The tragic suicides of the couple, as well as deaths of other young people in similar circumstances, led Yakel's and elders in other Tanna island communities to legalize love marriages. According to Jimmy Joseph Nako, an actor who became the film's translator and cultural director, the tragedy during the 1980s changed Tannese society, \\"It has changed our way of life and also secured it for the future, because young people were killing themselves.\\" To bring Tanna to life, Butler and Dean cast local first-time actors in the production. Yakel's residents nominated Mungau Dain for the lead role because they considered him to be the best looking man in the village. Bentley Dean, the film's co-director, explained that \\"It wasn't a case of me casting him it was the community casting him...We all thought he'd be great for the role because he had an energy to him and he was definitely the best looking guy in town.\\" However, Dain, who is believed to have never seen a film and had no acting experience, was initially apprehensive about his role and resisted his casting. Dain knew the importance of the love story and its history for his village. Bentley remembered, \\"The problem [for Dain] was that he didn't want to do it. He knew the story, he knew that he would have to play a love interest and he had a wife and he was quite shy. It actually took the chiefs to be a bit stern with him and say 'you have to do this for the tribe', and as soon as he got that word he took it up with interest and professionalism and he really worked hard.\\" According to Butler, the film's other co-director, \\"The whole process of acting was something that he had not thought about...I don't think at that stage he had seen a movie.\\" Dain proved to be a quick study, who quickly improved due to patience and practice. He eventually delivered a compelling, well-acted performance which won praise from both the directors and film critics. \\"He kept on improving and improving and by the end he could play any role that he chose. If he did decide to go into the movie business he'd have had no problem,\\" said Dean. Marie Wawa was selected to star opposite Dain as his love interest. Dain, Wawa, and the film's other ni-Vanuatu traveled throughout the world to promote the film. Dain appeared at the 2015 Venice International Film Festival wearing traditional Tannese clothing. While in Venice, Dain praised the city during an interview, saying, \\"This is such a good place, with many buildings, many cars, many people ‚Äî it's such a good place,\\" while praising his home village in Vanuatu, \\"my life here is not as good as my life back at home.\\" In 2017, following Tanna's Academy Award nomination for Best Foreign Language Film, Dain said he never imagined that the film would make it as far as Port Vila, let alone Hollywood. Dain, Marie Wawa, and two other Tannese stars of the film traveled to Los Angeles to attend the 89th Academy Awards on February 26, 2017. Following the film, Dain began meeting with an acting group in Port Vila to continue in the profession. =Death= In December 2018, Dain and his friend, Tanna co-star Lingai Kowai, traveled to Port Vila to seek work as seasonal fruit pickers in either Australia or New Zealand. While in the capital, Dain suffered a cut on his leg in an accident on New Year's Eve (December 31st). He quickly developed an infection in his leg, which went untreated and led to sepsis. By the time he was taken to the hospital, Dain was unconscious from septic shock. Mungau Dain died from the infection just five days later at Vila Central Hospital in Port Vila on January 5, 2019. He was 24 years old. Bentley Dean, the co-director of Tanna and friend of Dain, said that his death could have been prevented with antibiotics. Dean told Radio New Zealand, \\"It was an accident, certainly nothing life threatening and that's become infected,\\" and added, \\"You'd have to say it probably wouldn't have happened if he had have got earlier medical attention. That's one of the things that when we go back, we just want to talk about ways in which you can prevent this sort of tragedy from happening again because it is preventable.\\" Mungau Dain's body was flown from Port Vila to Whitegrass Airport on Tanna on January 6, 2019. The cargo plane carrying his coffin was met in Tanna by a number of dignitaries, including Deputy Prime Minister Bob Loughman, Minister of Internal Affairs Andrew Napuat, Parliamentary Secretary Johnny Koanapo, MP Nakou Natuman and the President of Tafea Province Jefferey Kauh. A large number of Tanna residents gathered to meet the coffin and plane as well. His death led to tributes across social media. The village of Yakel observed a traditional two week period of mourning following Dain's death. Dain was survived by his wife, Nancy, and their three children - a daughter and two sons. One of their sons, Martin, was named in honor of the co-director of Tanna, Martin Butler. Martin Butler, co-director of Tanna, said; ‚ÄúHe was a great example of how you can live a totally different type of life, and still be completely happy.‚Äùhttps://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-mungau- dain-20190111-story.html References External links * Category:Date of birth missing Category:1994 births Category:2019 deaths Category:Vanuatuan actors Category:People from Tafea Province ","title":"Mungau Dain"},{"id":"59599393","text":"No: 309 (Turkish: No: 309), is a Turkish drama television series created by Asli and Banu Zengin for Fox TV that premiered on 1 June 2016, and concluded on 25 October 2017.

Erkl√§rung Der Offenbarung Johannis, by Hi√´l, printed in 1687, The Ritman Library, Bibliotheca Philosophica Hermetica, Amsterdam Life Hendrik Jansen van Barrefelt was born c. 1520 in Barneveld, Netherlands and died in or after 1594 in Cologne. He married around 1550 and had several children. A former adherent of Menno Simons, the Anabaptist religious leader, Van Barrefelt became a follower of Hendrik Niclaes and joined the Family of Love. However, in 1573 Hendrik van Barrefelt had a vision and from this moment on he called himself \\"Hi√´l\\" (the uniform life of God). Shortly after this vision he broke with Niclaes and began to write his own works.Alastair Hamilton, \\"Hi√´l and the Hi√´lists: The Doctrine and Followers of Hendrik Jansen van Barrefelt\\", Quaerendo, 7 (1977), pp. 243-286. His followers called themselves Hi√´lists (lovers of the truth). Christophe Plantin, a well-known humanist, book printer and publisher in Antwerp and Leiden, also broke with Niclaes and became a follower and the central figure around Hi√´l. Works The emphasis of Hi√´l‚Äôs works was on the search for Christ in the soul, an inward interpretation of the Scriptures and an opposition to the visible church. As a result they attracted people with a personal and conciliatory spirituality who had very little with the services and ceremonies of the established churches, but at the same time had no wish to change from one confession to another.Alastair Hamilton, \\"Hi√´l in England 1657-1810\\", Quaerendo, XV, 4, 1985, pp. 285-286.  Publication  =Antwerp, Leiden and Cologne= Around 1580 Hi√´l‚Äôs writings began to appear and were printed in Antwerp and Leiden by Christophe Plantin.L√©on Voet, The Plantin Press (1555-1589), Amsterdam 1980-1983, vol. I, pp. 255-264. Around 1582 Hi√´l initiated two series of engravings for pictorial Bibles (Imagines et figurae Bibliorum), because he believed that the contemplation of biblical images would bring people closer to God. For this purpose he asked Pieter van der Borcht (1530-1608) to make two sets of illustrations of biblical stories for which Hi√´l wrote the explanatory texts.Alastair Hamilton, \\"From Familism to Pietism: the fortunes of Pieter van der Borcht‚Äôs biblical illustrations and Hi√´l‚Äôs commentaries ‚Ä¶\\", Quaerendo XI, 1981, pp. 271-301. The Latin version was published in 1582 by Jacobus Vilanus, a pseudonym of Christophe Plantin.J.A.L.Lanc√©e, Biografisch Lexicon voor de geschiedenis van het Nederlands Protestantisme, deel 2, 1983, pp. 42-43. After the death of Plantin other books by Hi√´l were printed by Augustijn van Hasselt in Cologne. In 1687 Jacob Clausen published the complete works of Hi√´l in a German translation which were very successful in Pietist circles. = London = As from 1657 Hi√´l‚Äôs works began to appear in England. The first English translation called The Spiritual Journey of A Young Man towards the Land of Peace was printed in 1659 and sold by Giles Calvert, a prominent printer in London who specialized in spiritual literature.Alastair Hamilton, \\"Hi√´l in England 1657-1810\\", Quaerendo, XV, 4, 1985, pp. 286-287. The German translation of Hi√´l‚Äôs works of 1687 was read by the Behmenist William Law and his circle of friends interested in mysticism. As a result of this Hi√´l was to become considered as a precursor of Jakob B√∂hme. The great admiration which William Law had for Hi√´l appears from the letter of Thomas Langcake to a friend, dated 30 November 1782, which said: > Mr. Law said to me [of ‚Ä¶ Protestant Mystics] that Jacob Behmen was the first > in Excellency, Hi√´l the next, and in the third place the Quakers ‚Ä¶ tho' the > deep mystic writers of the Romish Church surpassed them in their exceeding > Love of God and Divine Wisdom.D√©sir√©e Hirst, Hidden Riches. Traditional > Symbolism from the Renaissance to Blake, 1964.p. 196.Alastair Hamilton, Hi√´l > in England 1657-1810, Quaerendo, XV, 4, 1985, pp. 292, 303-304.Gerda J. > Joling-van der Sar, The Spiritual Side of Samuel Richardson, Mysticism, > Behmenism and Millenarianism in an Eighteenth-Century English Novelist, > 2003, pp. 140-141. On the title page of the Erkl√§rung der Offenbarung Johannis Hi√´l wrote \\"The Kingdom of God cometh not with observation/The Kingdom of God is within you.\\" (Luke 17:20-21). This idea is expressed by William Law in The Spirit of Prayer (1749): > God, the only Good of all intelligent Natures, is not an absent or distant > God, but is more present in and to our souls, than our own Bodies.Spirit of > Prayer, Part I, p. 4., 1749. The prominent 17th century French mystic and Christian philosopher Pierre Poiret (1646-1719) dedicated a chapter to Hi√´l in his Lettre sur les Auteurs Mystiques.Marjolaine Chevallier, Pierre Poiret 1646-1719: Du Protestantisme √† la mystique, Labor et Fides, 1994, pp. 30.

She was a correspondent for ABC's 20/20 from its inception until 1985, when she left to become a news anchor at KRON-TV in San Francisco; in 1990 she returned to ABC News in New York. Early life and education Chase was born in Northfield, Minnesota, where she graduated from Northfield High School. She was the youngest of three children. Her aunt was a radio announcer in Minneapolis, and in junior high school Sylvia and her sister produced a local radio show on news from the school. Her parents divorced early in her childhood and she had foster parents; she refused a scholarship from Wellesley College to join her sister studying at the University of California in Los Angeles, where her father was living, but he died shortly before she started classes. She worked her way through a degree in English, graduating in 1961. Career Chase managed the UCLA urban extension program; after graduation she was a temporary secretary and receptionist and modeled on weekends at I. Magnin; for some time she worked for Democratic California legislators and managed political campaigns in the state. In 1969 she went to work as a reporter at KNX, then a CBS radio station. She moved to New York in 1971, where she worked for CBS News and became a correspondent in 1974; she was the writer and narrator for a new radio show, The American Woman, which replaced the radio version of the advice column Dear Abby. She became one of the earliest prominent women reporters in the Walter Cronkite era of the CBS Evening News, persuading the network to cover stories such as the Coalition of Labor Union Women conference in 1974 in Chicago, and serving as a role model; she also headed the CBS employees' women's rights group that presented a list of concerns to the network president, Arthur Taylor. She anchored CBS Newsbreak and hosted the daytime Magazine news show, and also made appearances on 60 Minutes. She transferred in 1977 to ABC News, where she was a general assignment correspondent and co- anchor of ABC News Weekend Report. She was a correspondent for 20/20 from its start in summer 1978 to 1985. TV Guide referred to her during this period as \\"the most trusted woman on TV\\" and readers voted her the best investigative reporter for the U.S. TV news magazines. In late 1985, she left for San Francisco to take a job as a news anchor at KRON (San Francisco's NBC affiliate at the time). She later stated that ABC News president Roone Arledge's cancellation of a 20/20 story she had worked on based on a book by Anthony Summers about Marilyn Monroe's relationships with President Kennedy and his brother Bobby Kennedy, which was to have been featured in that year's season premiere, had precipitated the move; after being shortened and postponed, the segment was canceled shortly before it was to have aired. At the time of her move she denied a connection, and that her resignation was related to that of Geraldo Rivera, who left shortly before her after criticizing the decision. KRON advertised her arrival with the slogan \\"The Chase is on!\\". In addition to co-anchoring the station's news broadcasts, she also hosted news documentaries, including one on environmental degradation in Leningrad, and frequently reported on the AIDS crisis and on children. She was in Europe when the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake struck the Bay Area. In late 1990, she returned to ABC News in New York, telling the San Francisco Chronicles columnist Herb Caen, \\"I hate to leave the Bay Area, but if I‚Äôm going to get mugged it might as well be in New York\\". She co-anchored Prime Time Live and was a correspondent for 20/20; among other work, she reported on an American woman whose children were taken by her Serbian ex-husband and narrated Hopkins 24/7, a six-hour documentary about the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore that aired in 2000. Following her investigative report on the death of Kimberly Bergalis, the US Centers for Disease Control and the American Dental Association both increased requirements for sterilization of dental equipment. In 2001, when ABC cutbacks led to her contract not being renewed, she moved to PBS, where she was a contributing correspondent for Now with Bill Moyers and the narrator on Expos√©: America's Investigative Reports. She retired to Belvedere, California. Awards Chase's awards included the 1983 Pinnacle Award in Television News, the 1983 National Headliner Award for Outstanding Investigative Reporting, and two Emmy Awards for her 20/20 work, a Peabody Award for a KRON documentary on homeless children in 1989, three further Emmy awards for local news, the National Headliner Award in 1979, 1983, and 1994, and the 1991 Matrix Award from New York Women in Communications. She also received duPont-Columbia and Washington Press Club awards. Personal life and death While in college Chase married Robert Rosenstone, a graduate student in journalism who became a history professor at the California Institute of Technology, and moved with him to Wisconsin; she returned to UCLA when they separated two years later, and they subsequently divorced. She had both a professional and a personal relationship with producer Stanhope Gould, whom she met at CBS and with whom she shared an Emmy for a report on cars with exploding gasoline tanks and also collaborated on the Monroe report and at KRON; they traveled together to Russia. In retirement, she volunteered at De Marillac Academy, a Catholic middle school in the Tenderloin neighborhood of San Francisco; she made a documentary about one family whose children attended the school. Chase was diabetic. She died on January 3, 2019, at the age of 80, after undergoing treatment for brain cancer.

Hastings is known for his contributions to the current understanding of biological clocks in mammals and marine invertebrates.  Background  Hastings was admitted to the University of Liverpool to study marine biology (1974) and his PhD was spent at the University‚Äôs Port Erin Marine Biological Station on the Isle of Man (1977‚Äì80). With a view to becoming a science teacher, he took a Post-graduate Certificate of Education (Technical) at the Victoria University of Manchester, but then elected to pursue a career in biological research. He is married to neuroscientist Angela Charlotte Roberts (University of Cambridge).  Career and research  Hastings‚Äô PhD work introduced him to biological clocks, in the context of tidal and semi-lunar rhythms in the marine isopod crustacean Eurydice pulchra (Leach). With a post- doctoral position in Cambridge (Department of Anatomy, supervisor Joe Herbert) he moved into seasonal time-keeping in mammals with a focus on the role of the pineal gland and its hormone melatonin in photoperiodic regulation of reproduction and metabolism. In 1984 he was appointed to a junior lectureship, receiving tenure in 1988 and a readership in neuroscience in 1998. In this time he developed a research programme into the cellular actions of melatonin in the brain, and the neurochemistry of the central circadian clock, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus. In 2001 he moved to the Division of Neurobiology at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology (Cambridge) as a Group Leader to develop molecular genetic approaches to understanding the SCN molecular clockwork. His recent work has focussed on the genetic basis of cellular circadian time-keeping in mammals, the role of intercellular signalling in synchronising and stabilising the neural circuitry of the SCN, and the role of circadian mechanisms in normal metabolic regulation and its dysregulation in neurodegenerative disease. In October 2013 Hastings joined Michel Goedert as joint head of the Division of Neurobiology, and since May 2015 has been sole Head of Division.

He fought in the Black Hawk war, in which he was wounded. He led some gaming expeditions in the Cleveland area after the war, then joined a theatrical company in which his depiction of Native American life made him very popular throughout the Eastern United States and then Europe. Feeling the effects of old war wounds, he was on his way home via a goodwill tour when he fell seriously ill and died in Cleveland. His gravesite has attracted attention since his death, both because of his story and as a result of local superstition. Biography =Life= Joc-O-Sot was born circa 1810 of the Meskwaki tribe, whose home was based around present-day Iowa. His father's name was Katuchasha, who secured the honorific name \\"The Bear\\" through his exploits in war against the Osage Nation. The Meskwaki allied themselves with the Sauk people in the Black Hawk War, and although he personally made effort to prevent that war Joc-O-Sot fought in the conflict as a Meskwaki leader, and as a result suffered notable wounds. Within a couple of years after the war he relocated to the Cleveland, Ohio area and directed expeditions of fishing and hunting. While in Cleveland he began a close association with Dr. Horace Ackley. Through Ackley he was introduced to Dan Marble, and with the purpose of providing financial support to his tribe joined Marble's theatrical troupe, in which he portrayed scenes of Native American culture. His first theatrical appearance occurred in Cincinnati and proved highly popular, and the act continued across the Eastern United States. Encouraged by Marble, Joc-O-Sot joined in 1844 a company headed by William Vincent Wallace which was to tour England. His appearances there proved highly popular, owing to his costuming, which resulted in a summons for a Royal performance. He was noted for his intelligence, regal bearing, and courtesy. Joc-O-Sot's official lithograph portrait (now lost) by Day and Hague was commissioned by Queen Victoria who had been highly impressed. Joc-O-Sot was not in England very long before he became ill from what was likely tuberculosis and left for the United States of his own accord, his planned destination being home near Fort Leavenworth, Missouri. Evidently he stopped at Washington, D.C. on a diplomatic mission on behalf of his people to President John Tyler, and then headed to Montreal, Canada for the same purpose, making several goodwill stops along the way. He walked as far as Buffalo, New York, at which point his failing health prevented him from walking further. He was persuaded to take a boat further west, but his illness compelled him to stop in Cleveland. He evidently was poorly recompensed by the theater company, as by the time of his arrival in Cleveland he had no financial resources. In Cleveland he was diagnosed with \\"quick consumption\\" by a physician and given a place to stay by local coal magnate John G. Stockley in his office. Joc-O-Sot in all likelihood realized he was dying, among his last words were \\"Joc-O-Sot go up.\\" =Death and burial= Joc-O-Sot's grave pictured in 2016 Shortly after his arrival in Cleveland he died, on September 3, 1844. Ackley, Stockley and other friends took care of the funeral and burial proceedings. A funeral service was held the day following his death at the Second Presbyterian Church. He was then buried at Erie Street Cemetery in downtown Cleveland, an act intended to honor not only Joc-O-Sot but the Native American race. Soon after news of his death became known, he was elected chief of the Sauk. A sandstone gravestone was placed at the gravesite, but it incorrectly lists his death as having occurred in August, instead of September. In all likelihood his remains were body-snatched for the purpose of medical research, in any case his body was confirmed as removed in 1882 Cleveland city records. The tombstone was fractured into three pieces in 1877 when the cemetery caretaker was maintaining a tree at the gravesite, and a heavy limb fell upon it. It was repaired with rivets, but by 1884 was in pieces again. This original tombstone was further damaged by vandals in 1907. Status as Chief Controversy surrounds Joc-O-Sot's status as a Chief. Orlando J. Hodge found the claim plausible noting that Joc-O-Sot considered himself a chief and was accustomed to being addressed as such, but noted Joc- O-Sot's youth and lack of distinguishing accomplishments in battle. Oghema Niagara's granddaughter claimed that Joc-O-Sot was among the \\"greatest chiefs\\" of his era and was accordingly honored by local tribes and by herself in annual visits. He is known to have been elected as a chief subsequent to his death. Folklore surrounding gravesite The Cleveland Paranormal Society attributes the condition of the original tombstone to Joc-O-Sot's distress regarding his inability to return to his tribe. Another local legend recognizes the tombstone's vandals, but states they were supernaturally punished with insanity as a result of a curse place by Oghema Niagara. Indeed, Niagara proclaimed that a \\"terrible disaster\\" would afflict Cleveland if Joc- O-Sot's burial place were to be further disturbed.‚ÄúChief Thunderwater,‚Äù Cleveland Historical, accessed November 18, 2019, . Misfortune was said to affect several disparate developers who wished to move the graves for economic purposes. For several years three stalks of maize would grow beside Joc-O- Sot's grave, attributed to a Sauk tribe member who visited regularly. Joc-O- Sot's supposed ghost has been held responsible by the superstitious for losses by the Cleveland Indians baseball team. Accordingly, tokens of atonement have been placed on his grave in order to deflect game-day interference.

It is located in 8 Rustaveli Avenue, close to the foothills of Mount Mtatsminda. The building complex was constructed as the House of Government of Georgian SSR on the site of the demolished 19th-century Alexander Nevsky Cathedral and adjacent churchyard, with burials of the Georgian cadets killed during the Bolshevik invasion of 1921. It consists of two buildings; the \\"upper\\" building was designed by Viktor Kokorin and Giorgi Lezhava and built from 1933 to 1938. The \\"lower\\" building, along Rustaveli Avenue, was constructed by the same architects with an input from Vladimer Nasaridze from 1946 to 1953. The two buildings are connected with a courtyard, with staircases and fountains. The design of both buildings heavily uses elements of traditional Georgian architecture. The exterior facing the avenue is dominated by a monumental arcade, with massive eaves and \\"arch\\" pediment. The buildings are built of lightweight reinforced concrete, with exterior cladding of tufa rock, granite, and other materials. The complex was severely damaged during the December 1991‚ÄìJanuary 1992 military coup, during which the beleaguered President Zviad Gamsakhurdia was entrenched in the underground bunker under the government premises. The building was subsequently restored, refurbished, and used as the seat of the Parliament of Georgia from 1997 to 2012, when the legislature moved to the newly constructed edifice in Kutaisi, Georgia's second most important city. In 2014 holding of parliament committee meetings was allowed in the parliament premises of Tbilisi, while the regular sessions continued to be held in Kutaisi. The constitutional amendment passed in 2017 entered into force in December 2018, containing no reference to Kutaisi as the seat of the Parliament, meaning that the Parliament fully returned to the capital in January 2019.

It has offices in Tel Aviv, London, Singapore, and New York; its headquarters are in New York. History The company was founded in 2014 by software engineers who formerly worked at Fraud Sciences, which was bought and integrated into PayPal in 2008. Before working at Fraud Sciences, the founders served in the Israeli Army's Intelligence unit. Funding Forter's funding includes a combined $100 million from Sequoia Capital, Scale Venture Partners, New Enterprise Associates, March Capital Partners, and Salesforce Ventures. Technology According to specialists, the challenge to online retailers seeking to prevent online fraud is to be able to assess the customer's trustworthiness in real- time without blocking a legitimate sale or delaying it so long the customer abandons the purchase. In its 2018 analysis of the online fraud detection and prevention, SaaS firms that included both established and newer firms (SAS and Feedzai, e.g.), Gartner Group categorized Forter's technology as fraud analytics.

She was one of the most active members of the Danish Women's Society (Dansk kvindesamfund), editing its journal from 1908 and becoming its vice-president in 1913. She later headed the Copenhagen chapter of the Women's Society. Early life and education Born on 10 August 1873 in Skodsborg, Esther Henriette Hansen was the daughter of the merchant Harald Andreas Hansen (1835‚Äì1902) and Anna Georgiana C√©cile de Jonqui√®res (1847‚Äì1941). Raised in a well-to-do bourgeois home in Copenhagen, she matriculated from N. Zahle's School in 1893. In 1897, she took the examination for the first part of the civil engineering programme of study at the Polytechnical Institute. She did not complete her studies as in 1898 she married Ivan Carstensen (1871‚Äì1949), an officer in the Life Guards. Career From an early age, like her cousin Estrid Hein, Carstensen took a special interest in the status of women in the community. In 1906, she was a co-founder of Foreningen til Hj√¶lp for enligtstillede (Association for Supporting Single Mothers) but went on to devote most of her time to the Danish Women's Society. In 1907, she replaced Astrid Stampe Feddersen as head of the society's voting rights committee but failed to persuade all the other women's organizations interested in voting rights to join the Women's Society. From then on, she became a leading member of the organization, serving as vice-president from 1913 to 1918. In addition, from 1908 to 1913, she edited the Society's journal Kvinden & Samfundet, working with Thora Daugaard as editing secretary. Not only did she display fine editing skills, she became an effective contributor to the journal herself. As local branches of the Women's Society were created, Carstensen headed the Copenhagen chapter from 1913 to 1918 and later from 1934 to 1944, when she was elected honorary president for life. On moving to Viborg with her husband, she headed the Society's Viborg chapter from 1928 to 1932. While Carstensen was involved in improving all aspects of women's rights, she was particularly concerned with the insecurity experienced by married women, given their lack of economic independence. An effect speaker and discussion leader, despite her aristocratic manner she was always ready to take up any aspect of work, including going out on the streets to distribute leaflets or sell the Society's marguerites. Esther Carstensen died on 12 December 1955 in Copenhagen.

The twenty-fourth tropical storm and tenth typhoon of the annual typhoon season, Trami developed from a low- pressure area southeast of Guam on September 20. It intensified into a tropical storm on the next day, and intensified into a typhoon on September 22. Trami steadily intensified and reached its peak intensity late on September 24. On the following day, Trami slowed and drifted northward. It began to weaken due to upwelling. Trami accelerated and turned northeastward on September 29, before it struck Japan on the next day, and became extratropical on October 1. The extratropical remnants persisted for days until dissipated completely on October 8. Trami caused additional damage to Japan, while it still recovering from the impacts of Typhoon Jebi. Transportation was disrupted with several domestic flights were cancelled. Over 380,000 people were evacuated. In total, Trami killed 4 people and left hundreds of injures. Insurance loss were estimated to be ¬•306 billion (2018 JPY, $2.69 billion USD). Meteorological history On September 20, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) began to track a tropical depression located to the southeast of Guam. Moving northwestward, the depression gained some organization, and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA), and classified the system as a tropical depression later that day, giving the numeral designation 28W. The JMA started issuing advisories once the system attained winds of 55 km/h (30 mph). The JTWC upgraded 28W to a tropical storm on September 21, as it became better organized. The JMA followed suit later that day, assigning the international name Trami. The system moved west-northwestward on September 22, under the influence of a subtropical ridge to its north. Benefited from the favourable condition such as high sea surface temperatures (SSTs) of and low wind shear, Trami gradually intensified, attaining severe tropical storm on the morning, and became the tenth typhoon of the annual typhoon season later that day. The JTWC followed suit three hours later. Continued moving west-northwestward, Trami kept on intensifying thanks to favourable environmental condition. It developed a pinhole eye on that day, but soon entered a period of eyewall replacement cycle. Trami completed this cycle early on September 24 and resumed its intensification, with its eye became larger. According to JMA, the storm achieved its peak intensity at 18:00 UTC that day, with 10-minute maximum sustained winds of 195 km/h (120 mph), and a central pressure of 915 hPa (mbar; 27.02 inHg). The JTWC said that Trami has become a Category 5-equivalent super typhoon three hours later, with 1-minute sustained winds of 260 km/h (160 mph). Soon afterwards, Trami lost its steering current and slowed as it is situated between two subtropical high pressure, an area called the pressure field of the saddle type. The typhoon's persistence over the same location for several days resulted in tremendous upwelling of cooler waters, with sea surface temperatures dropping from . The combined effect of cooler water and dry air resulted in significant weakening, and Trami dropping below super typhoon status late on September 25. However, the previously small eye of Trami expanded dramatically. On September 28, the subtropical ridge over the Pacific Ocean slightly intensified, and Trami accelerated to the northwest. Trami turned to the northeast along a westerlies on September 29, and passed just west of the Okinawa Island. The typhoon made landfall near Tanabe, Wakayama at 8:00 p.m. JST on September 30 (11:00 UTC), with winds of 150 km/h (90 mph). After Trami impacted Honshu, it completely transitioned into a hurricane-force extratropical cyclone and impacted the Kuril Islands and weakened to a storm-force system. Its extratropical remnants were last tracked in the Bering Sea, near the Aleutian Islands. Impact =Taiwan= On September 28, the Central Weather Bureau (CWB) issued the heavy rain and extremely heavy rain alert to 7 cities and counties of Taiwan, warned that the rainfall in 24 hours will reach in those alerted area. The CWB also warned that the coastal and open areas may be affected by winds of Beaufort scale 9‚Äì11. Although Taiwan avoided a direct hit from Trami, large waves still affected the northern Taiwan. Wave heights at were recorded, and 4 people were injured by the large surf. =Japan= Downed trees in Tsukuba, Ibaraki after Trami Trami made its closest approach to the Okinawa Island in the afternoon of September 29, passing just west of the Naha Airport.

Throughout his career, he has worked within various visual arts disciplines that include painting, engraving, and sculpture. Characterized by his work of textures and natural pigment colors, his work is mainly based on abstract art and shows some attributes of figurativism and abstract expressionism, infused with ancient Japanese gods, biblical content, and Greek and Egyptian mythology. Raised and trained in Japan, and having lived in Paris before settling in Barcelona, Motomiya's work has been exhibited in several European cities such as Barcelona, Paris, Amsterdam and Mah√≥n (Minorca). However the vast majority of his works are exhibited in his native country, Japan. Through his specialization in engraving and the subsequent creation of the Taller Nou studio, he has worked with national and international artists, such as Antoni T√†pies, Barry Flanagan, Balthus, Miquel Barcel√≥ and Perejaume. The studio has been acknowledged as one of the best printmaking studios in Spain.  Early life and education  Takeshi Motomiya was born on 5 December 1959 in Shibuya, Tokyo. He was born into a highborn family of painters, and grew up surrounded by an artistic environment, between galleries and exhibitions. His grandmother, Migishi Setsuko (, 1905‚Äì1999), known as one of the pioneering Japanese women in oil painting, and his grandfather, Migishi K≈çtar≈ç (, 1903‚Äì1934), known as one of the first painters who began paintings by surrealism in Japan, were the main influential characters in Motomiya's interest towards the art world. He graduated in Fine Arts in 1982, with a master's degree specializing in engraving techniques in 1984 by the Tama Art University of Tokyo. Despite the fact that his academic background was focused on engraving, his personal development as an artist has matured above all in the area of painting. In 1984, with an invitation from his grandmother who at the time was living in France, Motomiya undertook his first trip to Europe with the intention of getting to know the art of European museums. While residing in France, Motomiya travelled around Europe were he had the opportunity to exhibit alongside his grandparents, and his uncle in a joint exhibition at the Galerie d‚ÄôEendt in Amsterdam in 1986. It was that same year, in one of his European trips where Motomiya, at the age of 27, fell in love with the city of Barcelona, where he has been established since 1986. It was upon his settlement in Barcelona that Motomiya began to focus entirely on his painting.  Career  Motomiya's work has been exhibited mainly in art galleries in Tokyo such as the Ueda Gallery, the Galerie 421, the 21+yo, the Okumura Gallery or the Libre Gallery. He has shown his work in art galleries across Japan as well; at the Yamaguchi Gallery in Chiba, and the Ecru-no-mori Gallery in Mishima. He has participated in several editions of the Nippon International Contemporary Art Fair, currently known as Art Fair Tokyo, and has exhibited at various editions of the Japan Art Dealers Association in Tokyo. Outside Japan, Motomiya's work has been mostly exhibited in Europe, in cities such as Barcelona, Paris, Amsterdam and Mah√≥n (Minorca) where he has been regularly exhibiting since 2012.During his first exhibition at the 5th NiCAF in 1997, Motomiya was introduced to the Japanese poet and literary critic, Makoto ≈åoka (Â§ßÂ≤° ‰ø°, 1931‚Äì2017). After seeing Motomiya's work, ≈åoka described him as the artist painted by pictures, which he later used as the title for the article in which he wrote about Motomiya's work. ≈åoka who came to admire the artist's work, became a regular buyer of Motomiya's work. Today, some of those paintings are part of the private collection exhibited at the ≈åoka Makoto Kotoba Museum, in Mishima, Shizuoka Prefecture. In 2009, Motomiya began teaching printmaking techniques at the Escola Massana of Barcelona within the Experimental Edition Course of the Massana Permanent program. The course was taught until 2012. = Taller Nou studio = After settling in Barcelona, in 1989, while continuing his work in painting, he and an associate founded the Taller Nou studio, which became a printmaking studio specialized in engraving and etching techniques for professional artists. Since the beginning of their work as printmakers, and for more than twenty years, they were the only printmaking studio of Antoni T√†pies' work. In fact, they kept working with him until the artist's passing in 2012. Apart from T√†pies, they have worked with many other national and international artists, among which are Barry Flanagan, Balthus, Miquel Barcel√≥ and Perejaume. Originally located in the Gracia district of Barcelona, the studio has been referred to as one of the best printmaking studios in Spain. Their work has been exhibited in museums around the world such as the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) of New York, during the Antoni T√†pies in Print exhibition, or at the Mus√©e Picasso Paris, during Miquel Barcel√≥, Sol y Sombra exhibit in 2016.

She began her career as a trainee with McLaren after graduating from Queen's University Belfast in 2009. Three years later, Collins became a performance engineer and became its leader in that role full-time in 2014, working for 2009 World Champion Jenson Button. She joined Force India in 2015 and helped the team finish fourth in the following year's Constructors' Championship. Collins has featured on Forbes list of 30 Under 30 list for Manufacturing & Industry in Europe and was an ambassador for the United Kingdom government's Make it in Great Britain campaign. Biography =Early life and education= Collins was born in around 1986 and 1987. She is from the village of Maguiresbridge in County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland. Collins' father works in a garage but not as a mechanic. She described herself as a partial \\"tom-boy\\" because she built and dismantled farmyard machinery with her father. Although she did not intend to be employed within motor racing, Collins was undecided on her future career during a period of five years at Mount Lourdes Grammar School. Eventually, she chose to enrol on a mechanical engineering course at the Queen's University Belfast because of her like of mathematics and physics. Collins was one of three female students in a class of 30. Her interest in motor racing emerged in her final two years at university when she was part of the annual Formula Student programme that is organised by the Institution of Mechanical Engineers where universities design, test. construct and drive small-scale formula style racing cars. =Career= Following the completion of Formula Student programme, but before she graduated in 2009, Collins applied for a graduate trainee programme with the McLaren Formula One racing team after seeing it advertised through Queen's University's Mechanical Engineering department. She was initially skeptical over securing the traineeship but she took advantage of an opportunity to visit the McLaren Technology Centre. Then, after completing a series of online assessments and tests, Collins secured a place on the programme in 2009. Her position entailed her rotating departments every three months to gain knowledge on each role and inter-team requirements. During her graduate year, Collins transferred into McLaren's design department and worked primarily on the transmissions of their vehicles. She also volunteered as an engineer at GP3 Series race weekends in order to broaden her experience. Then, Collins received an offer to work part-time for the McLaren GT sports car racing team and undertook support for its factory operation to manage its greenhouse emissions, something she desired to work in. In 2012, she was promoted to the role of a performance engineer. That June, Collins was named as the United Kingdom government's Make it in Great Britain's 30 Under 30 list and she consequently became an ambassador for the campaign. She worked as a race engineer for the United Autosports GT team in 2013. When McLaren's primary performance engineer was absent on paternity leave in late 2013, Collins was temporary assigned to the position for the Indian and Abu Dhabi Grands Prix and was later handed the job full-time for the 2014 season. She worked with 2009 World Champion Jenson Button and the two had a good working relationship. In May 2015, Collins left McLaren to join Force India as a performance and senior strategy engineer to driver Nico H√ºlkenberg as part of her objective of becoming an operations engineer. That season, she helped the team claim a podium with Sergio P√©rez at the 2015 Russian Grand Prix and later got the team to fourth in the Constructors' Championship in 2016. That year, Collins was featured by Forbes in their 30 Under 30 list for Manufacturing & Industry in Europe.

The park offers access to hiking and cycling trails including the Katy Trail. Camping and fishing facilities are also available. Klondike park also has a very diverse set of wildlife and habitats. History Klondike Park was originally a silica sand quarry, but was restored to natural condition by St. Charles County Parks. One unique feature of the park is the powdery white silica sand. This substance was mined to be blown into glass when the park was still an operating silica mine. The Lewis and Clark Expedition passed along what would be the park's northern border in 1804. The expedition stopped at nearby Tavern Rock on May 23, 1804, and again on September 21, 1806. The land was originally owned by Wilhelm (William) Engelage. The park is located on the site of the old Klondike Sandstone Quarry, which was founded in 1898 when the Tavern Rock Sand Company acquired the land. This location is on the eastern end of a 45 mile belt of St. Peter Sandstone. The sandstone was found well below ground level so the surface rock, Joachim dolomite, needed to be removed to access the sandstone. The sandstone was crushed on site, and then shipped by railroad to be used in the manufacture of glass. The quarry closed in 1983. St. Charles County purchased the land in 1999. Cliffs and bluff are made of limestone and sandstone. There are many warning signs on cliffs due to numerous deaths of cliffs giving away to weight.  Location  Klondike Park is located along the Missouri River. Klondike Park is located next to the Katy Trail State Park, and the rail runs through the park. Activities The park features six different cabins that host up to eight guests and over forty campsites with restrooms and shower houses. Wildlife One of the most popular locations in the park is the large pond. It was created after the quarry was mined out and rain filled the hole in the ground. The sand from the quarry can still be seen gathered around the lake today. The park has many different habitats for wildlife such as the large pond, riparian forest, emergent wetland, and grassland. Different animals and life forms call Klondike Park their home. Shorebirds and waterfowl can be found on the pond‚Äôs edge, along with sunfish, channel catfish, bluegill, and largemouth bass found in the park's lakes. There are also multiple types of woodpeckers, such as hairy, downy, and red- bellied woodpeckers, which can be found around the park. The grassland areas attract white-throated sparrow, dickcissel, and eastern meadowlark. Bald eagles, northern harrier, red-tailed hawk, red-shouldered hawk, and other birds-of-prey frequent the varied habitats on the area. Great blue heron, green heron, and great egret can be found on the pond's shoreline. Pied-billed grebe, Canada geese, and mallards use the deeper water in the center. There are many different kinds of plants, including horsetail (puzzlegrass). Klondike Park lake in winter.

The film is set against the backdrop of the 2002 Godhra train burning. Both the Central Board of Film Certification CBFC) and its appellate authority, the Film Certificate Appellate Tribunal refused to grant a certificate to the film. The film was released only after the Bombay High Court quashed the decisions of CBFC and FCAT. Plot Tusshar Mehta (Usman Raza), a businessman, has arranged the marriage of his son Rahul (Faisal Khan) to Meghna (Aliza). However, Rahul is in love with Saveen (Shama Sikander), and Meghna steps away from the marriage when she comes to know of their love.

He stated that the story was \\"truth ... gathered through numerous newspapers\\". The film was the directorial debut of Sharique Minhaj, who was working as an equipment supplier for a television channel during the 2002 Gujarat riots. Chand Bujh Gaya marked the first collaboration between Faisal Khan and Minhaj. They would later come together for Chinar Daastaan-E-Ishq (2015). Mahesh Bhatt had warned Anwar, stating: \\"you have put your hands in dynamite, not fire\\". The character based on Narendra Modi, Chief Minister of Gujarat, was played by Pratap Singh, who was subsequently offered the same role in a television serial, which he declined. In a 2007 interview, Anwar called the film \\"an attempt to bring about a sense of understanding between Hindus and Muslims\\". Certification controversy The producers had applied for a censor certificate in September 2003. The Examination Committee of the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) initially refused to certify the film, fearing that certain visuals and dialogues in the film may have the \\"danger of inciting communal violence\\". Upon discussion with the committee, the filmmakers removed certain scenes, reducing the footage to from . Despite the cuts, the committee refused to certify the film, citing that \\"the Gujarat violence is a live issue and a scar on national sensitivity. Exhibition of the film will certainly aggravate the situation\\". One key objection made by the board was the likeness between the film's villain and Modi. The CBFC had also denied certificates to two documentaries based on the 2002 Gujarat riots: Rakesh Sharma's Final Solution and Rakesh Pimple's Aakrosh. The producers expressed their inability to make any further cuts to the film as that would \\"dilute the message of communal harmony\\" the film intended to portray. To this, the CBFC, in January 2004, finally refused to grant certification to the film in its existing form. The producers filed an appeal against the CBFC's decision before the Film Certificate Appellate Tribunal (FCAT) in April 2004; FCAT found the CBFC's decision correct and affirmed that the depiction of explicit violence and resemblance of its characters to real-life people could ignite communal violence and \\"public disharmony\\". Rakesh Sinha, a Tribunal member, stated: \\"There seems to be a sort of ideological prejudice in the making of the film\\"; he felt that it gave the impression that the \\"Chief Minister [was] engineering the riots\\". He added that one character in the film \\"not only looks like Modi, he talks and moves like him\\", and the film \\"deliberately\\" targeted the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. The producers refused to cast another actor for the role of the Chief Minister. The filmmakers petitioned the Bombay High Court against the decisions of CBFC and FCAT as encroachment on the right to free speech and expression. A two-member bench comprising Chief Justice Dalveer Bhandari and Justice Dhananjaya Y. Chandrachud viewed the film and reached the conclusion that the \\"theme of the film is the absolute insensibility of violence. The film does not extol violence nor does it condemn any community as having taking recourse to violence\\". In F.A. Picture International v. CBFC AIR 2005 Bom 145, the bench observed that CBFC's and FCAT's refusal to grant a certificate to the film was a \\"clear infringement of the fundamental right of the producer under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution\\", and said they had \\"misconceived the scope and function of their powers and jurisdiction\\". The bench in its judgment dated 5 November 2004 directed the CBFC to grant appropriate certification to the film. Release Chand Bujh Gaya was released on 18 March 2005 with a U certificate, implying unrestricted public exhibition. However, the Chief Minister of Gujarat, Narendra Modi, banned the film within Gujarat. The film was dubbed into German and titled '. Soundtrack In its review of the film's soundtrack album, The Hindu noted that the title song \\"[caused] discomfort\\" but was appreciative of the three songs: \\"Chupke Chupke De Jaati Hai Pyaar Ka Paigaam Teri Yaadein\\", \\"Rehta Nahin Hai Chand Kabhi Chandni Se Dur\\", and \\"Zulf Meri Lehrai Re\\", calling them \\"pretty soft and romantic\\". It opined that from a child's perspective, the song \\"Yeh Apna Hindustan\\" \\"[did] sound good\\" and \\"Yaad Aaye woh Din\\" was a \\"mood melody\\". Reception Upon its release, Chand Bujh Gaya performed poorly at the box office. According to the Indian film trade website Box Office India, the film had a worldwide first-week collection of and a worldwide gross of approximately , thus earning the label of \\"disaster\\". Rohit Murari wrote in his 3-star review for Fullhyd.com that the film \\"scores a few points - for its blatant honesty\\" and Sikander was the \\"best thing to have happened to the movie\\". He found the film's music a \\"typical B-grade affair\\" and concluded his review by saying: \\"[T]here [was] no clear, or even unclear, objective behind making the movie\\".

Ananya Bhattacharya of India Today took note of the film's bias towards the protagonist: \\"Even the most controversial parts of PM Narendra Modi's life ‚Äì the Godhra riots ‚Äì are planted on the Opposition as a way to keep Modi from serving his people\\". Nandini Ramnath of Scroll.in wrote, \\"Any insights the movie offers into Modi's rise are inadvertent. The monomaniacal focus on one man above all else will surely be of interest to those who study how cinema can be used for propaganda\\". Renuka Vyavahare of The Times of India gave the film two and a half stars out of five and criticised the script, opining, \\"This one is too lopsided for you to appreciate. It leaves a lot unanswered. While it firmly believes ‚ÄòModi ek insaan nahi, soch hai‚Äô, we wish the script was as thoughtful\\". However, she was among the few who appreciated Oberoi's performance- \\"He gets the mannerisms, accent and tone right and thankfully doesn't overdo it\\". Writing for The Indian Express, Shubhra Gupta gave the movie two stars out of five and stated, \\"The film is not a mere bio-pic, it is a full-fledged, unabashed, unapologetic hagiography\\". Kennith Rosario of The Hindu summarised the movie's narrative as \\"a obsequious love letter\\" to the protagonist which tells the audience \\"how sincere, hardworking, fair and honest Modi is, [and] that it makes you wonder if life is a parody of this film\\". = Box office = The film collected 2.25-25 million nett on its opening day, and was the second best-performing film among all others released in India on that day, after Aladdin (2019). The following day, it earned 3 crore nett. Collections on Sunday showed minor growth with earnings of 4.25 crore.

It is the only utility-scale CPV system utilizing Suncore third-generation technology that is operational and grid-connected in the US. A portion of the output is being sold to PNM under a Power Purchase Agreement. Facility details The facility was constructed by Suncore and Bixby Electric starting in 2012 on a former landfill near EMCORE's corporate headquarters in the Sandia Science and Technology Park. Suncore Photovoltaics Technology Co, Ltd, was founded in 2010 as a joint-venture company by Chinese LED optoelectronics manufacturer San'an Optoelectronics Co, Ltd (60%) and U.S. semiconductor manufacturer EMCORE Corporation (40%). EMCORE was also purchasing part of the facility's output for its local administrative and manufacturing operations. The 1.21 MWp (1.0 MWAC) concentrator photovoltaics (CPV) portion of the facility consists of 48 dual-axis Suncore CPV-Gen3.5 solar tracking systems divided into 2 sections. The 24 systems of each section are connected in parallel to a central grid-connected 500 kW SatCon inverter. Each system supports 56 DDM-1090X CPV modules which are each rated to produce 450 Wp. Each module contains 15 fresnel lenses to concentrate sunlight 1090 times onto approximately 1 cm2 multi-junction solar cells which were locally developed and manufactured by EMCORE, allowing 28% module efficiency which is greater than other photovoltaic power plants. The Gen3.5 tracker system is especially notable for its tilt and roll design, which is unique among the trackers used by other CPV vendors. The same system is utilized at the 1.26 MWp Evora Landfill facility in Portugal, and at Suncore's 138 MWp Golmud CPV Solar Park, the largest CPV power station in the world.

Many phenomena in our world such as chemical reactions, electric circuits, mechanical vibrations, cardiac cells, and spiking neurons are examples of rhythmic phenomena, and can be considered as nonlinear limit cycle oscillators. History The theory of phase reduction method was first introduced in the 1950s, the existence of periodic solutions to nonlinear oscillators under perturbation, has been discussed by Malkin in, in the 1960s, Winfree illustrated the importance of the notion of phase and formulated the phase model for a population of nonlinear oscillators in his studies on biological synchronization. Since then, many researchers have discovered different rhythmic phenomena related to phase reduction theory.  Phase model of reduction Consider the dynamical system of the form : \\\\frac{dx}{dt}=f(x), where x\\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^N is the oscillator state variable, f(x) is the baseline vector field. Let \\\\varphi:\\\\mathbb{R}^N\\\\times \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{R}^N be the flow induced by the system, that is, \\\\varphi(x_0,t) is the solution of the system for the initial condition x(0)=x_0. This system of differential equations can describe for a neuron model for conductance with x=(V,n)\\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^N, where V represents the voltage difference across the membrane and n represents the (N-1)-dimensional vector that defines gating variables. When a neuron is perturbed by a stimulus current, the dynamics of the perturbed system will no longer be the same with the dynamics of the baseline neural oscillator. Isochrons and a stable limit cycle of the planar system \\\\dot{x}=x - y - x(x^2+y^2); \\\\dot{y}= x + y - y(x^2+y^2). The system has a unique stable limit cycle (solid circle). Only isochrons corresponding to phases nT/5, n=1, 2, 3, 4, 5, where T=2\\\\pi is the period of the orbit, are shown (dotted lines). Neighbouring trajectories (blue dotted curves) with different initial conditions are attracted to the cycle (except the origin). The target here is to reduce the system by defining a phase for each point in some neighbourhood of the limit cycle. The allowance of sufficiently small perturbations (e.g. external forcing or stimulus effect to the system) might cause a large deviation of the phase, but the amplitude is perturbed slightly because of the attracting of the limit cycle. Hence we need to extend the definition of the phase to points in the neighborhood of the cycle by introducing the definition of asymptotic phase (or latent phase). This helps us to assign a phase to each point in the basin of attraction of a periodic orbit. The set of points in the basin of attraction of \\\\gamma that share the same asymptotic phase \\\\Phi(x) is called the isochron (e.g. see Figure 1), which were first introduced by Winfree. Isochrons can be shown to exist for such a stable hyperbolic limit cycle \\\\gamma. So for all point x in some neighbourhood of the cycle, the evolution of the phase \\\\varphi=\\\\Phi(x) can be given by the relation \\\\frac{d\\\\varphi}{dt}=\\\\omega , where \\\\omega=\\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{T_0} is the natural frequency of the oscillation. By the chain rule we then obtain an equation that govern the evolution of the phase of the neuron model is given by the phase model: : \\\\frac{d\\\\varphi}{dt}= abla\\\\Phi(x)\\\\cdot f(x)=\\\\omega, where abla\\\\Phi(x) is the gradient of the phase function \\\\Phi(x) with respect to the vector of the neuron's state vector x, for the derivation of this result, see This means that the N-dimensional system describing the oscillating neuron dynamics is then reduced to a simple one-dimensional phase equation. One can notice that, it is impossible to retrieve the full information of the oscillator x from the phase \\\\Phi because \\\\Phi(x) is not one-to-one mapping. Phase model with external forcing Consider now a weakly perturbed system of the form : \\\\frac{dx(t)}{dt}=f(x)+\\\\varepsilon g(t), where f(x) is the baseline vector field, \\\\varepsilon g(t) is a weak periodic external forcing (or stimulus effect) of period T, which can be different from T_0 (in general), and frequency \\\\Omega=2\\\\pi/T , which might depend on the oscillator state x. Assuming that the baseline neural oscillator (that is, when \\\\varepsilon=0) has an exponentially stable limit cycle \\\\gamma with period T_0 (example, see Figure 1) \\\\gamma that is normally hyperbolic, it can be shown that \\\\gamma persists under small perturbations. This implies that for a small perturbation, the perturbed system will remain close to the limit cycle. Hence we assume that such a limit cycle always exists for each neuron. The evolution of the perturbed system in terms of the isochrons is : \\\\frac{d\\\\varphi}{dt}=\\\\omega +\\\\varepsilon \\\\, abla\\\\Phi(x)\\\\cdot g(t), where abla\\\\Phi(x) is the gradient of the phase \\\\Phi(x) with respect to the vector of the neuron's state vector x, and g(t) is the stimulus effect driving the firing of the neuron as a function of time t. This phase equation is a partial differential equation (PDE). For a sufficiently small \\\\varepsilon>0, a reduced phase model evaluated on the limit cycle \\\\gamma of the unperturbed system can be given by, up to the first order of \\\\varepsilon, : \\\\frac{d\\\\varphi}{dt}=\\\\omega + \\\\varepsilon \\\\, Z(\\\\varphi) \\\\cdot g(t), where function Z(\\\\varphi):= abla\\\\Phi(\\\\gamma(t)) measures the normalized phase shift due to a small perturbation delivered at any point x on the limit cycle \\\\gamma, and is called the phase sensitivity function or infinitesimal phase response curve. In order to analyze the reduced phase equation corresponding to the perturbed nonlinear system, we need to solve a PDE, which is not a trivial one. So we need to simplify it into an autonomous phase equation for \\\\varphi, which can more easily be analyzed. Assuming that the frequencies \\\\omega and \\\\Omega are sufficiently small so that \\\\omega-\\\\Omega=\\\\varepsilon\\\\delta , where \\\\delta is O(1), we can introduce a new phase function \\\\psi(t)=\\\\varphi(t)-\\\\Omega t. By the method of averaging, assuming that \\\\psi(t) does not vary within T, we obtain an approximated phase equation : \\\\frac{d\\\\psi(t)}{dt}=\\\\Delta_\\\\varepsilon + \\\\varepsilon\\\\Gamma(\\\\psi), where \\\\Delta_\\\\varepsilon=\\\\varepsilon\\\\delta , and \\\\Gamma(\\\\psi) is a 2\\\\pi- periodic function representing the effect of the periodic external forcing on the oscillator phase, defined by : \\\\Gamma(\\\\psi)= \\\\frac 1 {2\\\\pi} \\\\int_0^{2\\\\pi}Z(\\\\psi+\\\\eta)\\\\cdot g\\\\left(\\\\frac\\\\eta\\\\Omega\\\\right) \\\\, d\\\\eta . The graph of this function \\\\Gamma(\\\\psi) can be shown to exhibit the dynamics of the approximated phase model, for more illustrations see . Examples of phase reduction For a sufficiently small perturbation of a certain nonlinear oscillator or a network of coupled oscillators, we can compute the corresponding phase sensitivity function or infinitesimal PRC Z(\\\\varphi).

No other act spent more than one week in the top spot. Top Country Albums is a chart that ranks the top-performing country music albums in the United States, published by Billboard. In 2019, 21 different albums topped the chart, based on multi-metric consumption, blending traditional album sales, track equivalent albums, and streaming equivalent albums. The number-one position was dominated in 2019 by Luke Combs, who spent 34 weeks in the top spot during the year. His debut album This One's for You had first reached number one in the summer of 2017, but continued to return intermittently to the top of the chart for more than two years, particularly after the release of a deluxe edition in mid-2018. In 2019 the album had ten separate spells at number one, totalling 29 weeks atop the chart. Having already spent 21 weeks at number one in 2017 and 2018, the album reached a total of 50 weeks in the top spot, tying the record set by Shania Twain's album Come on Over for the highest total number of weeks at number one on the Top Country Albums chart. In June, The Prequel, a five-track EP, spent a single week at number one, and in November his second full-length album What You See Is What You Get reached the top spot, where it had spent four non- consecutive weeks by the end of the year. It also became the singer's first album to top the all-genres Billboard 200 chart, a feat also achieved by Thomas Rhett's album Center Point Road, which topped both listings in June. Every other chart-topper of 2019 spent only a single week at number one, and no act other than Combs achieved more than one number one during the year in its own right, although Maren Morris reached number one with her solo album Girl and also as a member of the Highwomen, a supergroup of female country singers. Several acts reached the top of the chart for the first time in 2019, beginning in the year's first week when former television and film singing cowboy Gene Autry was at number one with Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer and Other Christmas Classics, giving him his first chart-topper more than 20 years after his death. Other acts to reach the top of the chart for the first time during the year were Cody Johnson with Ain't Nothin' to It, Tyler Childers with Country Squire, the Highwomen with their self-titled debut album, Midland with Let It Roll, and the band Whiskey Myers with its eponymous album. In contrast, Honky Tonk Time Machine was the 27th number one for veteran country star George Strait, a record number of chart-toppers for a single artist. The year's final number one was Fully Loaded: God's Country, a compilation album by Blake Shelton, which topped the chart in the issue of Billboard dated December 28. Chart history Maren Morris topped the chart with a solo album and also as part of the group The Highwomen. Country Squire was the first number one for Tyler Childers. Center Point Road was a crossover success for Thomas Rhett, also topping the Billboard 200.

Now, Lawrence is an eight- piece soul-pop group. Lawrence family Clyde and Gracie Lawrence, who are three and a half years apart, have created music and performed together since childhood. Their father, Marc Lawrence, is a filmmaker, screenwriter, and director, best known for movies such as Miss Congeniality and Music and Lyrics. They also have a younger brother named Linus whom Lawrence has featured in songs such as \\"Come On, Brother\\" on their album Breakfast and is also often in Lawrence videos. =Clyde Lawrence= Clyde is a singer, pianist, and songwriter. He began writing music soon after he started playing the piano at age 4 and now also plays guitar, organ, and keyboard. After graduating from the Dalton School in 2011, he completed college at Brown University in 2015. When Marc Lawrence was working on the 2000 film Miss Congeniality and was not pleased with his options for the Miss United States pageant theme song, he turned to Clyde to see what he thought was wrong. At only 5, Clyde wrote his own version, and the film's other producers chose it without knowing its writer. The Miss United States pageant anthem that Clyde composed is prominently featured in the film, and his composition led him to become the youngest member of the Songwriters Guild of America. In recent years, a line from this song that Clyde wrote, \\"She's beauty, she's grace\\" has become widely used on the Internet. While attending high school at Dalton, Clyde continued to compose music for major motion pictures. He wrote original score for the 2007 movie Music & Lyrics as well as \\"Dance With Me Tonight\\", a song which Hugh Grant performs. He wrote two tracks, one of which he performed himself, for 2009 movie Did You Hear About the Morgans? Clyde has written songs for additional films including The Rewrite (2015) and Landline (2017). He also composed the songs featured in the Season 2 episode of Instinct entitled \\"Broken Record\\" which aired on July 7, 2019. Clyde, along with Cody Fitzgerald, composed the entire score for the 2019 Disney+ film, Noelle, starring Bill Hader and Anna Kendrick. They are the youngest people to serve as composers of a Disney film. =Gracie Lawrence= Gracie is both a singer and actress. She also attended Dalton, graduating in 2015, and also attended Brown after taking a gap year to tour with the band. Gracie would have been set to graduate from Brown in 2020, but she has since left college to play with Lawrence full time. Beyond music, she has acted on Broadway, television, and films for over a decade. In 2009, she acted in the Broadway show Brighton Beach Memoirs and also played Lucy Granger in the film Did You Hear About The Morgans?. She has also acted in the 2011 film The Sitter as well as TV shows such as The Good Wife, The Americans, and Younger. In 2018, she played Julie Gardner on the main cast of thriller CBS-All Access series One Dollar, which also featured Leslie Odom Jr. and John Carroll Lynch. She was featured in Town & Country Magazine's \\"Modern Swans\\" September 2018 issue. Band formation While at Brown University, Clyde started a band which he originally called The Clyde Lawrence Band. While he sung lead vocals and played the keyboards, the band also featured a rotating crew of Brown students and Gracie would visit from their home in New York to perform as well while she was still in high school. The band played at events around campus as well as colleges and venues across the Northeast. In 2013, Clyde wrote and recorded a full album, entitled Homesick, on which the Clyde Lawrence Band performed. After many years playing together, the band's name changed to Lawrence when Gracie became co-lead singer. Seven of the eight band members attended Brown. Music Lawrence released its first full-length album, Breakfast, in 2016, which hit #6 on the iTunes R&B; charts on its first day of release. Produced by Grammy winner Eric Krasno, Breakfast includes musical appearances from members of Snarky Puppy, Anderson .Paak, and Lettuce. Their hit single from the album, \\"Do You Wanna Do Nothing with Me?\\" has several million plays on Spotify. Their sophomore album, Living Room, was released in September 2018. Living Room reached #2 on the iTunes R&B;/Soul chart, earned a featured placement on Spotify‚Äôs ‚ÄúNew Music Friday‚Äù playlist, and led the band to its late-night television debut on NBC‚Äôs Last Call with Carson Daly. The album, which combines elements of Lawrence's old and new influences while featuring themes of childhood and family issues, was co-produced by bandmates Jordan Cohen (tenor/baritone saxophone) and Jonny Koh (guitar), Brooklyn-based producer Eli Crews, and Clyde and Gracie themselves. Lawrence has performed both in the United States and internationally. The band has headlined several tours across the USA and also has appeared at Bonnaroo, Outside Lands, SXSW, Electric Forest, Firefly, Okeechobee, and Hangout festivals. The band has also opened for Jon Bellion, Lake Street Dive, Vulfpeck, Soulive, Jacob Collier, Blues Traveler, O.A.R., and Bernhoft. =Jon Bellion collaboration and record deal= In February 2019, Lawrence announced via social media that the band would be an opener for Jon Bellion on his summer 2019 national tour, the Glory Sound Prep Tour. In June, Lawrence released its first of many Jon Bellion-produced singles, \\"Casualty\\". In July, Bellion and Lawrence announced that Bellion had launched his own record label, Beautiful Mind Records and had signed Lawrence as its first artist. Bellion has stated that his intention with this new label is to \\"take care of artists for the rest of their careers\\" and to create a family of musical creators who he supports and with whom he collaborates.

IR welding typically uses a range of wavelengths from 800 to 11,000 nm on the electromagnetic spectrum to heat, melt, and fuse the interface between two plastic parts through the absorption and conversion of the IR energy into heat. Laser welding is a similar joining process that applies IR radiation at a single wavelength. There are many different welding techniques that use IR heating, with the three major modes being surface heating, through transmission IR welding (TTIr), and IR staking. A variety of heating configurations have been applied to these techniques such as scanning, continuous illumination, and mask welding. Advantages such as faster and controllable non-contact heating applicable for a wide range of simple or complex part geometries sets IR welding apart from other forms of plastic welding. CO detectors, IV bags, and brake transmission lines are just a few of the many products that utilize IR welds.  History  IR welding is categorized as a form thermal plastic welding alongside hot gas welding, hot tool welding, and extrusion welding. Although infrared radiation was first discovered in the 1800s, IR was not applied as a source of heat until the beginning of WWII when it was found to be more effective than the fuel convection ovens of that time. IR radiation was first tested for the welding of thermoplastic polymers in the late 1900s, but the process was relatively new and not fully understood. IR welding systems offered faster heating times than the other forms of thermal welding, but the high capital costs limited its development. With a decrease in the price of equipment in the 1990s, IR welding has become more popular in the industry.  Physics of IR welding  Electromagnetic spectrum Electromagnetic wave interactions IR welding typically uses wavelengths from 800 to 11,000 nm on the electromagnetic spectrum. Plastics interact with IR radiation through reflection, transmission, and absorption. Incident IR radiation can either be reflected off the surface of the plastic, transmitted through the plastic, or absorbed into the plastic as other forms of energy including thermal energy. The ratio of these three interactions depends on the wavelength of the IR radiation and the receiving plastic's properties. Amorphous plastics are generally optically clear and can transmit almost all incident IR radiation. For this reason they are commonly used in TTIr. Semi-crystalline plastics can diffuse incident IR radiation between the amorphous and crystalline boundaries, reducing the transmittance and increasing the absorbance of the material. The higher absorptivity results in more heat generation for a given IR source. Additives such as clarifying agents can be used increase a plastic's transmittance while dies and pigments can be used increase the absorbance of a material. Increasing amounts of these additives can decrease the strength of both the material and the welded joint. The closer the IR radiation source, the higher incidence efficiency on the material. IR radiation is most effective when directing radiation normal to the part. Radiation energy always affects the surface of a part while the depth of penetration that the energy can reach is dependent on the plastic's crystallinity.  Equipment  = IR Sources = Potential IR welding sources include quartz lamps and ceramic heaters which can generate a wide range of IR wavelengths. Laser welding employs IR sources that operate at a single wavelength such as CO2 lasers, Nd:YAG lasers, laser diodes. The equipment selected for each welding process stems from the type of radiation produced. Quartz lamps produce wavelengths of around 1,000 to 5,000 nm and ceramic heaters produce wavelengths of around 5,000 to 10,000 nm. = Attachments = P-wave technology utilizes an IR lamp and a pre-placed focusing device such as an IR transducer or film that can filter and focus IR radiation at a desired wavelength and increased intensity within a selected area to improve weld penetration with minimal surface damage. This method allows improved IR welding of polymers with higher melting temperatures such as most fluoropolymers and polyketones.  IR welding techniques  The three major welding techniques used in the industry today include surface heating, through transmission IR welding, and IR stacking. All IR welding techniques contain the following six basic steps in some form: Basic steps of the IR surface heating modeTTIr Welding Diagram # Loading of parts into the welding system that will hold the parts in place # Insertion of IR source in front of the face of each part that will welded together # Application of IR radiation to melt a thin layer of plastic on the surface of each part # Change-over in which the IR source is removed from the face of each part # Clamping of the parts to join the melted surfaces together under pressure as they cool and solidify # Unloading of the parts after the weld has been made = Surface Heating = Surface heating includes heating and melting of the interface between plastic parts with IR radiation and forcing the parts together into a molten joint that solidifies as one part. This process can be split into 3 phases as shown in the figure to the right: A) Loading of parts, insertion of the IR source, and IR application. B) Change-over with the removal of IR source and clamping of the parts to join them. C) Unloading of the parts after the weld was made. = Through Transmission IR Welding (TTIr) = TTIr welding is the joining of an IR transparent part to a second part such that the IR radiation travels through the transparent part and heat the surface of the second part as shown in the figure to the right. IR wavelengths are generally within 800 to 1050 nm. To make a transparent part absorbent to IR radiation, the addition of dies or colorants such as carbon black can be used. Highly absorbent thermoplastic films can be placed at the joint to receive the IR radiation and melt the interface during welding. Using these methods, TTIr welds can be completed between parts of both the same or different materials. IR Stacking = IR Staking = IR staking includes the localized welding of a thermoplastic stud from one part into the cavity of a non-weldable part to form a mechanical fastener. As shown in the figure to the right, the polymer part and non-weldable part are first placed together (A), then the excess polymer is melted and formed around the non-weldable part to fasten the two part together (B). The stud can be heated through directed TTIr when pre- placed within the cavity of an IR transparent part, then melted to deform it into a button shape required to fill the cavity before solidifying. Surface IR radiation can also be used to soften the plastic stud and press it into a button-shaped forming head, forcing the stud to deform into the shape of the forming head before solidifying.  Heating Configurations  IR systems generally rely on one of three surface heating methods: scanning, continuous illumination, and mask welding. = Scanning = Scanning involves the movement of an IR beam across the surface of a part using either an automated motion system or galvanic mirrors. Equipment is limited by the speed of movements across the part's surface to maintain uniform temperatures on the surface. In TTIr welding, scanning allows the un-melted portion of the part to act as a mechanical stop in order to maintain the joint gap between the two parts. = Continuous illumination = Continuous illumination uses more than one IR radiation source to heat the entire joint interface at the same time. Part tolerances or fit is not as crucial with this method as the entire surface will be melted before welding. This method is useful when welding parts with complex geometries, employing the multiple IR sources to evenly heat all forms of joint interfaces. = Mask welding = Similar to continuous illumination, mask welding utilizes multiple IR sources to completely illuminate a joint interface while placing an IR radiation mask over the parts to control which regions will form a melt layer.  Materials  Below is a list of materials well known for their IR weldability: *Polycarbonate (PC) *Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) *Ethylene vinyl alcohol (EVOH) *Acrylic *Polystyrene (PS) *Acrylonitrile butadiene stryrene (ABS) *Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) *Polyethylene (PE) *Polypropylene (PP) *Polyketone (PK) *Elastomers *Polyamide (PA) *Polyoxymethylene (POM or Acetal) *Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) *High density polyethylene (HDPE) * Glass fiber reinforced polyethylene (PPE) *Polybutylene terephthalate (PBT) * Glass fiber reinforced polyether sulfone (PES)  Advantages / Disadvantages  = Advantages = * Fast heating and cycle time than other thermal plastic welding processes * Non- contact heating on the weld interface prevents plastic parts from sticking to the heat source, as seen in hot plate welding * Controlled heat affected zone for reduced flash than seen in hot plate welding * Minimal contamination risk with prevention of production of particulate than other thermal plastic welding processes * Continuous and easily automated process * Potential for higher joint strengths and lower residual stresses than other thermal plastic welding processes * Cost-effective in comparison to laser welding * Direct heat transfer to parts allows for maximum energy efficiency and fast response time with lower weight equipment than other thermal plastic welding processes * Well suited for welding high temperature thermoplastics in comparison to hot plate welding = Disadvantages = * IR welding parts and systems are more expensive than other thermal plastic welding processes * IR welding can only weld materials susceptible to IR waves and part interfaces exposed to IR radiation * Prolonged heating may cause material degradation or vapor oxidation entrapment  Applications  New joining technologies using IR welding are critical for fabricating complex parts and assemblies at high speeds and low costs. Although IR plastic welding has many advantages over other types of plastic welding, limitations such as equipment costs and susceptible materials properties reduce the amount of industrial applications of the method. A few examples of current industrial applications are shown below: CO detector IV bag *CO detector filters are IR welded to their plastic housing to prevent damaging the filter with particulate * Medical IV-bags are IR welded to achieve minimal flash and particulate generation for smooth and clean fluid flow *High-speed cut and seal film (300 m/min) processes allow for minimal fraying at the edges and cauterized seams *Brake fluid reservoirs are IR welded to prevent clogging and contamination of the small fluid transmission channels *PE pipes in the infrastructure of natural gas transmission undergo IR welding using TTIr to improve joint strength with minimal coupling deformation PE pipe  References  Category:Welding ","title":"IR welding"},{"id":"59600753","text":"Nakatindi Yeta Nganga (1922‚Äì1972)Wim van Binsbergen (1987) Chiefs and the state in independent Zambia Journal of Legal Pluralism was a Lozi aristocrat and Zambian politician.

The mall operated as an enclosed shopping center from 1975 to 2018 with main anchor stores and a variety of interior stores. The interior mall was closed September 28, 2018 leaving just three businesses - a car repair shop, a building supply outlet store, and a moving van rental operation - as of 2019. The mall's anchor stores were Sears, Bergner's, JCPenney, and Kmart. History Carl Sandburg Mall was proposed and developed by Skokie, Illinois- based Kenroy, Inc. beginning in 1971. The $15 million development was built beginning in February 1974 and continuing into 1975 on 97 acres near the intersection of Henderson Street and U.S. Route 34 in northwest Galesburg.\\"Sears will Build in Kenroy Mall.\\" Galesburg Register-Mail, 18 April 1973, p. 2.

The Mall expanded twice in 1982 and 1992 bringing about a two-screen cinema operated by Kerasotes Theatres and a fourth anchor when Kmart opened a location in the mall. In addition to the four anchors, Sandburg Mall has spaces for 46 interior stores and has two outparcel buildings for automotive centers. Original retailers included Osco Drugs, Bresler's Ice Cream, Team Electronics, Garcia's Pizza-in-a-Pan, GNC, Karmelkorn, and Musicland. The mall began a downturn not long after its original owner GGP sold it in the late 1990s. The mall was operated next by Ken Tucker and Associates but the Galesburg area suffered through economic downturn including the closing of its Maytag factory. As 30-year leases came due, many interior stores left the mall. Kerasotes closed the twin-screen cinema on December 18, 2003 creating an eight-screen theatre not far from the mall.Pulliam, John.

She was also the first Adygean woman aviator.  Early life  Boguzokova was raised by her aunt and uncle after her father was repressed in the 1930s while her mother worked in Krasnodar. After completing secondary school with excellent marks she moved to the city of Maykop where she studied at a local aeroclub since she was a member of the Komsomol while a student at pedagogical school. She had been inspired to become a pilot from reading in newspapers about the feat of women pilots Valentina Grizodubova, Polina Osipenko, and Marina Raskova. After completing pedagogical school she began working as a teacher in the Chechen-Ingush ASSR, and in May 1942 she was appointed as the director of the Novo-Atagin school, but was evacuated from the area in August that same year due to the war.  World War II  After being evacuated from the warfront she sent in a request to be allowed to join the air force. Her request was granted in 1943, and in November she was assigned to fly as a radio operator and gunner in the 765th Assault Aviation Regiment. She flew in her first ground-attack sortie on the North Caucasian Front. In the middle of the war she married pilot Pyotr Pavlovich Likarenko, and after their wedding ceremony they painted ‚ÄúFrom Moscow to Berlin‚Äù on the side of one of the regiment's aircraft. They had met when Pyotr completed pilot training and was informed, to his disbelief, that she would be his radio operator and gunner. Lyolya went on to fly ground-attack missions with her husband, even while she was pregnant with their son Igor during the Battle of Berlin. During the war she completed 59 combat missions, engaged in five dogfights and shot down two enemy aircraft in the process.  Personal life  After the war Boguzokova returned to the field of education, and after continuing her schooling at a pedagogical institute she became a Russian language teacher in Moscow. On 24 September 1951 she died from Leukemia and was buried in the Khatukai aul, her mother's hometown. Her son Igor followed in her footsteps and also held a career in military aviation, reaching the rank of colonel.

Initially a promising young actress, Spitzeder became a well-known private banker in 19th-century Munich when her theatrical success dwindled. Running what was possibly the first recorded Ponzi scheme, she offered large returns on investments by continually using the money of new investors to pay back the previous ones. At the height of her success, contemporary sources considered her the wealthiest woman in Bavaria. Opening her bank in 1869, Spitzeder managed to fend off attempts to discredit her for a few years before authorities were able to bring her to trial in 1872. Because Ponzi schemes were not yet illegal, she was convicted instead of bad accounting and mishandling customers' money and sentenced to three years in prison. Her bank was closed and 32,000 people lost 38 million gulden, the equivalent of almost 400 million euros in 2017 money, causing a wave of suicides. Her personal fortune in art and cash was stripped from her. After her release from prison in 1876, Spitzeder lived off benefactors and unsuccessfully tried to act again in Altona and Berlin. She left Germany for Vienna but police there prevented her engagement, so she returned to Munich in 1878 to publish her memoir. She was arrested again in 1880 for attempting to open a new bank without having the necessary permits but later released without charges. Spitzeder performed as a folk singer, living off friends and benefactors, but she never left her criminal life completely behind her, resulting in further trials and periods of incarceration. She died of cardiac arrest on 27 or 28 October 1895 in Munich. Spitzeder never married, but it was noted that she carried on several lesbian relationships. Outwardly, she maintained the persona of a pious Christian woman who helped the poor, which aided the success of her business.  Early life  Adelheid Luise Spitzeder was born on 9 February 1832 in Berlin. Her parents were the actors and singers Josef Spitzeder and Elisabeth \\"Betty\\" Spitzeder-Vio. She had six half-siblings from her father's first marriage to Henriette Sch√ºler. Her parents met in Berlin where both were engaged at the K√∂nigsst√§dtisches Theater, Josef as a director and Betty as an actress; they married in 1831. That year, he performed as a guest at the National Theater in Munich to critical acclaim. King Ludwig I offered him and his wife a salary of 6,000 gulden yearly if they took a permanent engagement at the National Theater, which led to the family moving to Munich. When Josef Spitzeder died suddenly on 13 December 1832, Ludwig I agreed to help Betty by paying for the children's tuition. Betty then married Franz Maurer and took an engagement at the Carltheater in Vienna in 1840, where Spitzeder attended a H√∂here M√§dchenschule run by the order of the Ursulines; after a year, she entered the convent's boarding school. In 1844, she and her mother moved back to Munich, where the family lived with Spitzeder's half-siblings and cousins. At age 16, she went to a renowned school led by Madame Tanche. After leaving Tanche's school, she was tutored in foreign languages, composing and piano- playing. = Acting career = alt=A young woman with black hair pinned up looking sternly Wanting to follow in her parents' footsteps and against her mother's wishes, Spitzeder studied with Munich actresses Konstanze Dahn and Charlotte von Hagn. In 1856 or 1857, she debuted at the Hofb√ºhne in Coburg to great acclaim playing Deborah and Mary Stuart. In her memoirs, she claims that the Duke of Coburg and the Duke of W√ºrttemberg both praised her talent. Since there were no vacancies at Coburg, she left the Hofb√ºhne to take an engagement at Mannheim before returning to Munich for a few guest roles at the National Theatre. Despite being offered a contract to play there, she knew that she would only be tasked with playing supporting roles due to fierce competition and thus decided to instead work at the theater of Brno. According to her autobiography, her success there led to conflicts with the other actors which in turn led her to leave the engagement after six months for health reasons. She then returned to Munich for six months to recuperate. Despite her mother's urging, she returned to acting at Nuremberg where she was engaged for a year. Afterwards, she played in Frankfurt, Bern, Z√ºrich, Mainz and Karlsruhe. After returning to Munich to visit her mother, she was offered an acting job in Pest with annual salary of 3,000 gulden which she turned down at her mother's wishes. Her mother offered her 50 gulden per month for life if she turned the job down. Nevertheless, she took one last engagement in Altona. During one of her engagements, she met Emilie Stier, stage name Branizka, a fellow actress with whom she soon began a romantic relationship. Despite multiple engagements over a period of many years, she failed to achieve lasting success on the stage. The contemporary source Der Neue Pitaval attested that she had the necessary talent but attributed her lack of success to her appearance. In his biography of Spitzeder, Julian Nebel cites a contemporary describing her as having a \\"not very beautiful, square face with rough traits, out of which a long, broad nose protrudes; the mouth is broad, the chin pointy, the gray eyes hard to read, a real butch\\".: \\"Ein wenig sch√∂nes, eckiges Gericht mit groben Z√ºgen, aus dem eine lange, breitfl√ºgelige Nase hervorsteht; breit ist der Mund, spitz das Kinn, die grauen Augen von schwer zu bedeutendem Ausdruck, ein richtiges Mannsweib.\\" Her \\"masculine\\" behavior is generally highlighted, such as her cigar smoking and surrounding herself with beautiful young women. Unable to restrict her lifestyle, she began to live at the expense of her creditors and accrued significant debt in Hamburg and Zurich while working there. In 1868, she returned to Munich with her girlfriend Emilie to await job offers from theatrical agents but did not receive any she wanted. Dejected and penniless, she only had her mother's stipend of 50 gulden to live on. The money, however, was not sufficient to pay for her lifestyle of residing in hotels and inns with her girlfriend and six dogs.  Spitzedersche Privatbank  Sketch of Spitzeder in 15 March 1873 issue of Harper's Weekly Spitzeder soon had to borrow money from moneylenders to maintain her lifestyle. In late 1869, she met a carpenter's wife in Munich's Au district, then the city's poor neighborhood. After gaining her trust, Spitzeder claimed she knew someone who would pay the woman a return of 10 percent each month on her investments. The wife gave her 100 gulden and immediately received 20 gulden, two months of returns, with the promise of another 110 gulden within three months. According to a contemporary story in Harper's Weekly, Spitzeder also placed an advertisement in the city's major newspaper, the M√ºnchner Neueste Nachrichten, asking to borrow 150 gulden with the promise of 10 percent interest after two months. Another contemporary source, a 1872 article in the M√ºnchner Neueste Nachrichten citing her indictment, claims her first money lending activities started in the spring of 1869. = Growth of business = Spitzeder's banking services quickly became the talk of the town in Munich's poorer communities thanks to favorable word-of-mouth advertising and soon, more people gave her their savings. In 1869, she officially founded the Spitzedersche Privatbank. Because her customers were mostly workers from the northern outskirts of Munich, especially the town of Dachau, her bank also came to be known as \\"Dachauer Bank\\". Some farmers sold their farms to live off the interest alone. Many lower-class Christians mistrusted the Jewish moneylenders, preferring to bank with a Christian, and she soon had to rent additional rooms in her hotel to accommodate her up to forty employees. One of her employees was Rosa Ehinger, whose beauty and charm Spitzeder used to attract young men to the bank. Spitzeder's business practices and accounting were unconventional and chaotic. Money was deposited in large sacks and in various cupboards. Her employees, all or almost all without training in accounting, regularly simply took money, with the accounting being restricted to recording the names of depositors and the amounts they paid in, often only signed with \\"XXX\\" by her illiterate customers. Her business relied solely on acquiring new customers quickly enough to pay existing customers with the newly acquired money. According to some sources, hers was the first known Ponzi scheme. Contemporaneous English-language publications such as Harper's Weekly referred to it as the \\"Spitzeder swindle\\". In her doctoral thesis, Hannah Davies recounts the case of Johann Baptist Placht, who in 1874 was indicted for running a Ponzi scheme in Vienna and notes that contemporaries compared his business model to Spitzeder's. Unlike Placht and other fraudsters, Spitzeder never made claims of investing the money and explicitly gave no securities, which paradoxically led customers to trust her more. By October 1871, the proprietor of the hotel in which she was living and working was no longer willing to tolerate the customer traffic. Spitzeder moved into the house at No. 9 Sch√∂nfeld Street near the Englischer Garten which she bought for 54,000 gulden of her customers' money. Including bank employees, there were 83 people who worked from her house, many of whom were brokers who received a five-to- seven percent commission for each new customer. She soon expanded her business and started buying and selling houses and land throughout Bavaria, buying 17 houses in prime locations in Munich alone. By 1871, she received 50,000 to 60,000 gulden each day, although she had lowered her returns paid to 8% per month. Despite the size of her business, the bank had no premises of its own and all business was done first out of her hotel rooms and later her house. By 1871, Spitzeder was in possession of multiple millions of gulden and artwork valued at several million. According to a contemporary report in Harper's Weekly, at the height of her fortune in 1872 she was considered to be the wealthiest woman in Bavaria.  Clashes with authorities and competition  From 1871, the authorities tried to find legal reasons to stop her business but since she was fulfilling her obligations to her customers as promised, she avoided official intervention. While the city of Munich began taxing her as a \\"Bankier 2. Klasse\\" (\\"second class banker\\"), she avoided calls to be entered into the register of companies at this time. In 1872, the Munich Commerce Court decided that she had to enter her business in the register of companies, revising its earlier decision, which included rules about proper accounting. Since the court's ruling only applied to her money-lending business, she instead stopped lending and focused on taking in money. To circumvent the official ban on lending money, she allowed her workers to take money from the bank and lend it to customers under their own name. Some of her workers used this opportunity to enrich themselves, such as Franz Wagner, a scribe with a monthly salary of 60 gulden, who later bought a house for 59,000 gulden. The success of the Dachauer Bank led to customers withdrawing large amounts of funds from other banks, especially the Sparkassen, threatening their existence. The Munich Sparkasse's leadership first discussed the competition by Spitzeder in May 1871, having lost some 50,000 gulden to her bank. In the fall of 1872, Bavaria's Minister of the Interior had to report to the king that the Sparkasse of Alt√∂tting had to resort to drastic measures to pay out all its customers who wished to invest with Spitzeder instead and the president of the government of Upper Bavaria noted on 29 October 1872 that the large amount of withdrawals might force the Sparkasse of Ingolstadt to recall its debts to be able to meet payout demands. Similar reports of large scale withdrawals were reported by the Sparkassen of Traunstein and M√ºhldorf. As a consequence, the Bavarian Ministry of the Interior placed large scale advertisements in a major newspaper on 30 October and 5 November 1872, warning customers to no longer invest with Spitzeder. On 7 November 1872, Munich's police also issued a lengthy statement detailing the bank's lack of reliability. = Public image = Caricature of Spitzeder opening one of her soup kitchens, from the M√ºnchner Neueste Nachrichten Spitzeder cultivated an image of a resolute, pious woman concerned for the public welfare. During banking hours at her house in Sch√∂nfeld Street she was often seen sitting on an elevated leather chair in the middle of her banking office wearing a red nightgown and a cross around her neck, demonstratively signing notes for the money she received. In the halls of the building, cutouts of the negative articles from the M√ºnchner Neueste Nachrichten were posted in an attempt to demonstrate that she had nothing to fear from such coverage. The long lines of waiting customers were often entertained by musical groups playing outside the bank and she provided free meals and drinks at the tavern \\"Wilhelm Tell\\" next door. She only allowed deposits after all payouts had been processed, which often took until noon, thereby creating long queues of waiting customers that enforced the impression that they should consider themselves lucky to be allowed to give her money. Customers who reached her were treated with crass and direct language, with Spitzeder telling them that she did not call them nor would she give them any securities. Her flaunted honesty combined with her demonstrative warnings and the focus on entertaining her customers served to enhance her standing with the common people. Spitzeder made generous donations to the Church, ostensibly for charity, and partook in regular pilgrimages to the Shrine of Our Lady of Alt√∂tting. Whenever she ventured to the hinterland, she treated the masses ‚Äì who often welcomed her with cheers and gifts ‚Äì to beer and hearty snacks. She also opened the \\"M√ºnchner Volksk√ºche\\" (Munich peoples' kitchen) at the Platzl, a tavern providing beer and food at discounted prices and with seating for up to 4,000 patrons, strengthening her image as the \\"angel for the poor\\". In total, she opened and operated twelve such soup kitchens. Her pious demeanor also persuaded local Catholic clergy to support her endeavors, bringing her new customers and shielding her from criticism by the government. The publicity Spitzeder generated soon attracted the interest of the local newspapers. The foremost of her critics was the liberal M√ºnchner Neueste Nachrichten which in 1870 began calling Spitzeder a fraudster and kept questioning her honesty and business practices until the end. In reaction to it, she placed an ad in every major newspaper ‚Äì except the M√ºnchner Neueste Nachrichten, which refused to print it ‚Äì challenging her critics to demonstrate that she enticed her customers to give her money or that they were being disadvantaged. After attempts to bribe the M√ºnchner Neuste Nachrichten's editor in chief, August Napoleon Vecchioni, to cease their criticism failed, Spitzeder turned to the newspaper's main rival, the Catholic-conservative Volksbote. A newspaper circulated in similar numbers as the M√ºnchner Neueste Nachrichten, the Volksbote was in serious financial troubles which it solved with a 13,000 gulden loan from Spitzeder; in turn, the Volksbote responded to each criticism in the M√ºnchner Neueste Nachrichten. Other conservative Catholic newspapers, especially Das Bayerische Vaterland published by Johann Baptist Sigl, also supported her and characterized criticism of Spitzeder as attempts by \\"Jewish capital\\" to discredit a pious and hard-working woman, tapping into the widespread antisemitism of the times. From 1871, Spitzeder began publishing her own newspapers. She was granted ownership of the S√ºddeutscher Telegraph, the Neue Freie Volkszeitung and the Extrablatt when their respective publishers were unable to repay their loans. Additionally, she founded her own newspaper, the M√ºnchener Tageblatt. Her popularity outside the city walls was enhanced significantly when she granted Theophil B√∂sl, the publisher of the Freier Landesboten, a loan of 14,000 gulden and B√∂sl in turn gave her written insurance not to report negatively on her business. Positive coverage in the Landesboten led to a large number of customers traveling to Munich to invest with the Dachauer Bank. = Bankruptcy and criminal charges = Spitzeder withstood the pressure levied against her by the authorities and the M√ºnchner Neueste Nachrichten for a while, mainly because banking laws and financial regulations were non-existent and because a few years prior, Bavaria had introduced legislation that allowed almost any business to operate with almost no oversight. In February 1872, an attempt by the M√ºnchner Neueste Nachrichten to discredit her made a lot of customers ask for their investments back, but also brought a rise in new customers. In March 1872, Munich's police director had to admit that the attack, which the police had hoped would end Spitzeder's business, had failed. The M√ºnchner Neueste Nachrichten started a new attack on Spitzeder in the fall of 1872, repeating the warnings of the authorities, explaining the possible ways the government might intervene and prophesying the immediate demise of the bank. In November 1872, the withdrawals clearly exceeded the investments, forcing Spitzeder to limit withdrawals to an hour between six and seven in the morning, with no withdrawals on Wednesdays and Saturdays. The police persuaded 40 of her customers to present their claims to the district court, which then ordered a review of the bank's books. On 12 November 1872, a five-person inquiry commission arrived at the bank to perform a court-ordered review. Additionally, 60 customers, organized by rival private banks, visited her residence and demanded all of their money back, which was more than Spitzeder had available, leading to the bank's collapse. Ehinger tried to flee with 50,000 gulden that she claimed was a gift from Spitzeder but both women were arrested and the money seized. Spitzeder's house was closed by the police and soldiers and policemen were placed on the premises to safeguard the remaining items of value and prevent acts of aggression by the populace. During her bank's existence, 32,000 customers were defrauded of 38 million gulden, roughly 400 million euros in 2017 money. After review, only assets corresponding to 15 percent of the investments were recovered. A wave of suicides by people who lost everything followed. Spitzeder was accused of failure to keep books, embezzlement of customers' funds and excessive wasting of money; she was sentenced in July 1873 to three years and ten months in prison for fraudulent bankruptcy. She was not convicted of fraud itself because her business scheme did not meet the law's definition of fraud. During and after the trial, she refused to acknowledge any wrongdoing and maintained that her business was completely legal. The lack of legal requirements for accounting and the fact that she had never advertised any securities were accepted as mitigating circumstances. Ehinger was sentenced to six months in prison for aiding Spitzeder. For health reasons, Spitzeder was allowed to stay in the prison in Baader Street, Munich, where she wrote her memoir.  Later life and death  Munich's Old Southern Cemeteryalt=A cubic tombstone inscribed with the names Anna Schmid, Friedrich Schmid and Anna Schmid Spitzeder was released from prison on 9 September 1876 in poor health, being hemiplegic and unable to walk stairs on her own. During and after her stay in prison, those who had profited from her abandoned her and the newspapers that previously defended her made money by publishing expos√©s about her. However, some former customers, despite their losses, helped her; she found a place to stay with the widow of a judge and was given money. Her doctor prescribed her a stay at the sanatorium in Bad Wildbad where she went at her benefactors' expense. Shortly after arriving, she was surrounded by fans and received publicity in local newspapers. She lived in Bad Wildbad for ten months where she started writing music for the pianino. She met the director of a theater in Altona who offered her a guest role but she was received negatively. The local Altonaer Generalanzeiger newspaper commissioned the production of small whistles which they sold as \\"Spitzeder-whistles\\" for people to use at her next performance. Spitzeder however refused to act on the stage in Altona again and left the town for Berlin where people waited in anticipation to see the famous fraudster. However, before she could perform, the Berlin police prevented her performance and forced her to depart the city the same day, so she returned to Munich. No longer able to find work in Germany, she left for Vienna but the authorities there forbade any contact between her and the theater's director. Unable to perform under her own name, she began composing music and performing as Adele Vio. In 1878, she published her memoir entitled Geschichte meines Lebens (Story of my life). In it, she had formulated plans for after her release from prison, such as opening a brewery in the Au, a large restaurant in western Munich, and a horse racing track near Nymphenburg Palace, none of which came to fruition. After releasing her memoir, she again began to give out promissory notes that now contained explicit warnings that she was not providing any security and that the creditor has to be willing to waive any rights of reimbursement if she was not able to pay them back. She was arrested on 13 February 1880 with her new companion, Marie Riedmayer, who had cared for her after her release from prison. However, the local prosecutors determined that people who were still willing to give her money after all that had happened did not need to be protected and Spitzeder was released. The constant scrutiny of the police was too much for her to bear and so she continued to perform as Adele Vio, living off friends and benefactors instead. She also still received the 50 gulden monthly that her mother had provided. Minor swindles led to further trials and periods of incarceration. Spitzeder died of cardiac arrest in Munich on 27 or 28 October 1895 at age 63 and was buried in her family's plot in Munich's Alten S√ºdlichen Friedhof cemetery with her parents. Her family posthumously changed her name to Adele Schmid.  Personal life  Josefine Gallmeyer, Spitzeder's first companion Spitzeder never married, and she rejected numerous marriage proposals, including ones from men of the aristocracy. Despite her demonstrative Christian demeanor at a time when official Catholic doctrine declared homosexuality a sin, she tended to have an entourage composed mostly of young, attractive women. She was in relationships with multiple women. Spitzeder's first documented relationship was during her time in Brno with fellow actress Josefine Gallmeyer. However, as Gallmeyer was erratic and quickly grew bored with her, the relationship soon ended and Spitzeder left Brno for Munich. At some point during her acting career she met Emilie Stier (stage name Branizka) with whom she returned to Munich in 1868. During her trial, the court's president emphasized the intimate relationship between both women, who shared a bed \\"breast to breast\\". The relationship continued into Spitzeder's banking career which Stier was actively supporting, with the M√ºnchner Neueste Nachrichten soon reporting on \\"two tricksters that take people's money\\". However, the romantic relationship ended abruptly when after a fight Stier left the premises head over heels; the reason for their fight is unknown to this day. The end of the relationship depressed Spitzeder who locked herself in her rooms and only recovered because her customers, wishing to be able to invest in her bank again, cared for her until she recovered. In need of a new companion, Spitzeder placed an advertisement in the local newspapers for a \\"Gesellschafterin\\" (\\"lady's companion\\"), a code that was known to refer to women seeking a female romantic partner. Out of a large number of applicants, she chose a French woman who however apparently did not understand the code and thus left her house after only a few weeks. Shortly afterwards, Rosa Ehinger moved into the house next door with her mother. Originally from Augsburg, Ehinger had dreams of becoming an actress, so Spitzeder, 19 years her senior, took the young woman, who soon started working in her bank, in and showered her with lavish gifts. After Spitzeder's arrest however, Ehinger disavowed her and denied having any romantic relationship with her. Ehinger even tried to argue that the payment of 50,000 gulden was damages for the reputational damage she suffered because of the rumors about her homosexuality, but she was ordered to repay the sum in full. Following her release from prison, she was cared for by Marie Riedmayer, who was again described as her \\"Gesellschafterin\\" and who accompanied her to Bad Wildbad.  In popular culture  brought Adele Spitzeder's story to the stage as a play for marionettes in the 1870s. In 1972, Martin Sperr wrote a television movie that was directed by Peer Raben and starred Ruth Drexel as Spitzeder. The play Die Spitzeder by Sperr was first performed on 11 September 1977. In 1992, the Bayerischer Rundfunk broadcast the documentary Adele Spitzeder oder das M√§rchen von den Zinsen (\\"Adele Spitzeder or the fairy tale about the interest\\") by . Xaver Schwarzenberger adapted the story again as a television movie titled Die Verf√ºhrerin Adele Spitzeder (\\"The seducer Adele Spitzeder\\"). It was produced by the Bayerischer Rundfunk and the ORF, starred Birgit Minichmayr as Adele Spitzeder and was first broadcast on 11 January 2012.

Allmendinger was a wooden hulled steam barge built in 1883, that ran aground during a storm on November 26, 1895, on Lake Michigan, off the coast of Mequon, Ozaukee County, Wisconsin, United States. On October 11, 2018, the remains of the Allmendinger were listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History The J.M. Allmendinger (Official number 76411) was built in 1883 by Albert Burgoyne of Benton Harbor, Michigan for John Allmendinger and Samuel Hull, two wholesalers and retailers of fruit. She was named after John Allmendinger. She had a length of , her beam was wide and her cargo hold was deep. She had a gross tonnage of 230.94 tons, and a net tonnage of 207.04 tons. She was powered by a fore and aft compound steam engine, and one boiler. She mostly carried lumber, but she also carried iron ore, shingles and sundries. In May, 1887 the Allmendinger ran aground in Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin and was freed by a passing tug. In 1888 she was remeasured, and she was rated 183.17 tons. In July, 1889 the Allmendinger had fourteen of her stanchions damaged when the St. Paul Bridge in the Menominee River swung the bridge against her hull. In May, 1890 on White Lake near Whitehall, Michigan while waiting for a storm to pass, and was freed by the steamer Hilton. In May, 1892 he Allmendinger stranded on a reef at North Point near Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and was freed by the tugs Welcome and Carl. In November, 1893 she grounded twelve miles north of Milwaukee, Wisconsin and was freed by the tug Welcome and a lighter. In June, 1894 the Allmendinger was towed to Manistee, Michigan by the tug J.L. Wheeler for repairs. Final voyage On November 26, 1895 the Allmendinger was bound from Milwaukee, Wisconsin to Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin with a cargo of lumber. She eventually encountered a blizzard and was blown off course, grounding on a beach near Fox Point at around 3:00 A.M. She ended up about off Mequon, Wisconsin. Captain Peterson and his crew of eight were rescued by the life-saving crew. An April 24, 1897 issue of the Door County Advocate described her wreck: > The steambarge J.M. Allmendinger, which was driven ashore fourteen miles > north of Milwaukee late in the season of 1895 and abandoned as a total loss, > has at last gone to pieces and her timbers lie scattered along the beach. > Not a vestige of the craft remains in sight at the point where she struck. > From the time of her abandonment until well along in February the hull and > upperworks remained intact and conveyed the idea to some the vessel might be > rescued. But the constant beating of heavy seas resulting from the > prevailing easterly winds finally disintegrated the hull, and when the > collapse came it was of the most complete description, every vestige of the > steamer being wiped out in a single night. The J.M. Allmendinger today The remains of the Allmendinger were rediscovered in July, 1934 by Max Nohl, Jack Browne, and Verne Netzow, who worked with a raft, homemade diving helmets and oxygen tanks to recover portions of the wreckage. Her wreck lies 2.5 miles south of Concordia University in Mequon, Wisconsin about from shore in of water. The wreckage consists of the keelson, the lower frames, the rudder, the boiler and the steam drum attached to the boiler.

Its publisher is Sarah Longwell. While it launched as a news aggregator, it was revamped into a news and opinion site using key digital staffers from the defunct magazine The Weekly Standard.  History  Following the end of publication of The Weekly Standard in December 2018, editor-in-chief Charlie Sykes said: \\"the murder of the Standard made it urgently necessary to create a home for rational, principled, fact-based center-right voices who were not cowed by Trumpism.\\" The site was created in December 2018 as a news aggregator as a project of the Defending Democracy Together Institute, a 501(c)(3) conservative advocacy group led in part by Weekly Standard co-founder William Kristol, who was a prominent voice pushing for the U.S. invasion of Iraq. Several former editors and writers of The Weekly Standard soon joined the staff and within weeks of launch began publishing original news and opinion pieces. CNN reported in January 2019 that approximately $1 million had already been raised for the site, which was said to be adequate to keep the site running for one year but that additional funding was being sought. A podcast hosted by Sykes and executive editor Jonathan V. Last was launched on December 21, 2018. Ideology Despite the initial editorial makeup of The Bulwark being largely from the coalition of neoconservatives and libertarians that wrote Weekly Standard, the website's intense opposition to the administration of Donald Trump over time brought it to a more centrist stance on balance, including liberal commentators alongside the more conventional conservatism that held sway in the Republican Party from the 1950s to the mid-2010s. It is opposed to populist expressions of conservatism, as well as tradtionalism, particularly as expressed by Trump-aligned politicians and pundits, as well as earlier exponents of those ideologies such as Pat Buchanan and Samuel T.

A 1995 model of Earth's dynamo predicted super-rotations of up to 3 degrees per year; the following year, this prediction was supported by observed discrepancies in the time that p-waves take to travel through the inner and outer core. Seismic observations have made use of a direction dependence (anisotropy) of the speed of seismic waves in the inner core, as well as spatial variations in the speed. Other estimates come from free oscillations of Earth. The results are inconsistent and the existence of a super-rotation is still controversial, but it is probably less than 0.1 degrees per year. When geodynamo models take into account gravitational coupling between the inner core and mantle, it lowers the predicted super-rotation to as little as 1 degree per million years. For the inner core to rotate despite gravitational coupling, it must be able to change shape, which places constraints on its viscosity.  Background  At the center of Earth is the core, a ball with a mean radius of 3480 kilometres that is composed mostly of iron. The outer core is liquid while the inner core, with a radius of 1220 km, is solid. Because the outer core has a low viscosity, it could be rotating at a different rate from the mantle and crust. This possibility was first proposed in 1975 to explain a phenomenon of Earth's magnetic field called westward drift: some parts of the field rotate about 0.2 degrees per year westward relative to Earth's surface. In 1981, David Gubbins of Leeds University predicted that a differential rotation of the inner and outer core could generate a large toroidal magnetic field near the shared boundary, accelerating the inner core to the rate of westward drift. This would be in opposition to the Earth's rotation, which is eastwards, so the overall rotation would be slower. In 1995, Gary Glatzmeier at Los Alamos and Paul Roberts at UCLA published the first \\"self-consistent\\" three-dimensional model of the dynamo in the core. The model predicted that the inner core rotates 3 degrees per year faster than the mantle, a phenomen that became known as super-rotation. 1996, Xiaodong Song and Paul G. Richards, scientists at the Lamont‚ÄìDoherty Earth Observatory, presented seismic evidence for a super-rotation of 0.4 to 1.8 degrees per year, while another study estimated the super-rotation to be 3 degrees per year.  Seismic observations  Schematic of PKP(BC) and PKP(DF) waves Location of the South Sandwich Islands, which are nearly antipodal to Alaska. The main observational constraints on inner core rotation come from seismology. When an earthquake occurs, two kinds of seismic wave travel down through the Earth: those with ground motion in the direction the wave propagates (p-waves) and those with transverse motion (s-waves). S-waves do not travel through the outer core because they involve shear stress, a type of deformation that cannot occur in a liquid. In seismic notation, a p-wave is represented by the letter P when traveling through the crust and mantle and by the letter K when traveling through the outer core. A wave that travels through the mantle, core and mantle again before reaching the surface is represented by PKP. For geometric reasons, two branches of PKP are distinguished: PKP(AB) through the upper part of the outer core, and PKP(BC) through the lower part. A wave passing through the inner core is referred to as PKP(DF). (Alternate names for these phases are PKP1, PKP2 and PKIKP.) Seismic waves can travel multiple paths from an earthquake to a given sensor. PKP(BC) and PKP(DF) waves have similar paths in the mantle, so any difference in the overall travel time is mainly due to the difference in wave speeds between the outer and inner core. Song and Richards looked at how this difference changed over time. Waves traveling from south to north (emitted by earthquakes in the South Sandwich Islands and received at Fairbanks, Alaska) had a differential that changed by 0.4 seconds between 1967 and 1995. By contrast, waves traveling near the equatorial plane (e.g., between Tonga and Germany) showed no change. One of the criticisms of the early estimates of super-rotation was that uncertainties about the hypocenters of the earthquakes, particularly those in the earlier records, caused errors in the measurement of travel times. This error can be reduced by using data for doublet earthquakes. These are earthquakes that have very similar waveforms, indicating that the earthquakes were very close to each other (within about a kilometer). Using doublet data from the South Sandwich Islands, a study in 2015 arrived at a new estimate of 0.41¬∞ per year. = Inner core anisotropy = Song and Richards explained their observations in terms of the prevailing model of inner core anisotropy at the time. Waves were observed to travel faster between north and south than along the equatorial plane. A model for the inner core with uniform anisotropy had a direction of fastest travel tilted at an angle 10¬∞ from the spin axis of the Earth. Since then, the model for the anisotropy has become more complex. The top 100 kilometers are isotropic. Below that, there is stronger anisotropy in a \\"western\\" hemisphere (roughly centered on the Americas) than in an \\"eastern\\" hemisphere (the other half of the globe), and the anisotropy may increase with depth. There may also be a different orientation of anisotropy in an \\"innermost inner core\\" (IMIC) with a radius of about 550 kilometers. A group at the University of Cambridge used travel time differentials to estimate the longitudes of the hemisphere boundaries with depth up to 90 kilometers below the inner core boundary. Combining this information with an estimate for the rate of growth for the inner core, they obtained a rate of 0.1‚Äì1¬∞ per million years. Estimates of the rotation rate based on travel time differentials have been inconsistent. Those based on the Sandwich Island earthquakes have the fastest rates, although they also have a weaker signal, with PKP(DF) barely emerging above the noise. Estimates based on other paths have been lower or even in the opposite direction. By one analysis, the rotation rate is constrained to be less than 0.1¬∞ per year. = Heterogeneity = A study in 1997 revisited the Sandwich Islands data and came to a different conclusion about the origin of changes in travel times, attributing them to local heterogeneities in wave speeds. The new estimate for super-rotation was reduced to 0.2‚Äì0.3¬∞ per year. Inner core rotation has also been estimated using PKiKP waves, which scatter off the surface of the inner core, rather than PKP(DF) waves. Estimates using this method have ranged from 0.05 to 0.15¬∞ per year. = Normal modes = Another way of constraining the inner core rotation is using normal modes (standing waves in Earth), giving a global picture. Heterogeneities in the core split the modes, and changes in the \\"splitting functions\\" over time can be used to estimate the rotation rate. However, their accuracy is limited by the shortage of seismic stations in the 1970s and 1980s, and the inferred rotation can be positive or negative depending on the mode. Overall, normal modes are unable to distinguish the rotation rate from zero.  Theory  In the 1995 model of Glatzmeier and Roberts, the inner core is rotated by a mechanism similar to an induction motor. A thermal wind in the outer core gives rise to a circulation pattern with flow from east to west near the inner core boundary. Magnetic fields passing through the inner and outer cores provide a magnetic torque, while viscous torque on the boundary keeps the inner core and the fluid near it rotating at the same rate on average. The 1995 model did not include the effect of gravitational coupling between density variations in the mantle and topography on the inner core boundary. A 1996 study predicted that it would force the inner core and mantle to rotate at the same rate, but a 1997 paper showed that relative rotation could occur if the inner core was able to change its shape. This would require the viscosity to be less than 1.5 x 1020 pascal- seconds (Pa¬∑s). It also predicted that, if the viscosity were too low (less than 3 x 1016 Pa¬∑s), the inner core would not be able to maintain its seismic anisotropy. However, the source of the anisotropy is still not well understood. A model of the viscosity of the inner core based on Earth's nutations constrains the viscosity to 2‚Äì7 √ó 1014 Pa¬∑s. Geodynamo models that take into account gravitational locking and changes in the length of day predict a super-rotation rate of only 1¬∞ per million years. Some of the inconsistencies between measurements of the rotation may be accommodated if the rotation rate oscillates.

She was the fifth iyalorix√° (chief priestess) of Il√™ Ax√© Op√¥ Afonj√°, a Candombl√© terreiro in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil. M√£e Stella was trained as a public health nurse. She was initiated into the Candombl√© religion in 1939 and became the iyalorix√° of Il√™ Ax√© Op√¥ Afonj√° in 1976. M√£e Stella is noted for writing on the beliefs and practices of Candombl√© for the general public, rather than practitioners. She lived in the interior of Bahia after a stroke and was interred in Salvador after her death in 2018. Early life M√£e Stella de Ox√≥ssi was born in Salvador, the fourth daughter of Esmeraldo Antigno dos Santos and Thom√°zia de Azevedo Santos. She became an orphan and was raised by her maternal aunt. She studied at the Federal University of Bahia and graduated from the School of Nursing and Public Health. M√£e Stella de Ox√≥ssi worked as a community health nurse for more than thirty years. Leadership in Candombl√© She was initiated by M√£e Senhora (1890-1967) on September 12, 1939, at the age of 14. She received the oruk√≥ (spiritual name) of Od√© Kayod√™ at this time. M√£e Stella studied under M√£e Senhora at Il√™ Ax√© Op√¥ Afonj√° until M√£e Senhora's death in 1967. She was named the fifth iyalorix√° of Il√™ Ax√© Op√≥ Afonj√° on March 19, 1976, succeeding M√£e Ondina de Oxal√° (1916-1975). She retired from nursing in the same year. M√£e Stella de Ox√≥ssi visited Yoruba holy sites in Osogbo, Osun State, Nigeria beginning in 1981. The visit began religious and cultural exchanges between the Candombl√© and Yoruba religious communities in Brazil and Nigeria. M√£e Stella also began to write articles and books on Candombl√© traditions and practices, which were largely orally transmitted into the 20th century. She opened a museum, Ohun Lailai Museum, in 1981. It was the first public museum attached to a Candombl√© terreiro. The museum displays clothing used in Candombl√© rituals, chairs, ritual objects, ritual instruments, and cooking implements; these were largely hidden or unknown to the general public prior to the opening of the museum. M√£e Stella campaigned for the recognition of Il√™ Ax√© Op√¥ Afonj√° by the National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage (IPHAN). The terreiro was recognized as a federal protected historic site in 1999. Beliefs M√£e Stella de Ox√≥ssi is noted for her opposition to syncretism between Candombl√© and Catholicism, long a basis of Candombl√© practice. While writing on mutual respect between the religions, she wrote that \\"I am not against the Catholic Church, but against syncretism.\\" She advocated for the removal of statues of Catholic saints from Candombl√© altars, and used the Yoruba language-term iyalorix√° instead of the Portuguese m√£e de santo. M√£e Stella advocated for the use of Yoruba in both naming practices and liturgy. Death M√£e Stella de Ox√≥ssi moved to the city of Nazar√© das Farinhas in the interior of Bahia in 2017 after a stroke. She died in Santo Ant√¥nio de Jesus on December 27, 2018.

First explored in 1874 by Josef Stefan, squeeze flow describes the outward movement of a droplet of material, its area of contact with the plate surfaces, and the effects of internal and external factors such as temperature, viscoelasticity, and heterogeneity of the material.Engmann, J., Servais, C., & Burbidge, A. S. (2005). Squeeze flow theory and applications to rheometry: A review. Journal of Non-Newtonian Fluid Mechanics, 132(1-3), 1-27. doi:10.1016/j.jnnfm.2005.08.007 Several squeeze flow models exist to describe Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids undergoing squeeze flow under various geometries and conditions. Numerous applications across scientific and engineering disciplines including rheometry, welding engineering, and materials science provide examples of squeeze flow in practical use.  Basic Assumptions  Conservation of mass (expressed as a continuity equation), the Navier-Stokes equations for conservation of momentum, and the Reynolds number provide the foundations for calculating and modeling squeeze flow. Boundary conditions for such calculations include assumptions of an incompressible fluid, a two-dimensional system, neglecting of body forces, and neglecting of inertial forces. Relating applied force to material thickness: F=-\\\\frac{4*L^3*\\\\eta*W}{h^3}{dh \\\\over dt} Where F is the applied squeezing force, 2L is the initial length of the droplet, \\\\eta is the fluid viscosity, W is the width of the assumed rectangular plate, 2h is the final height of the droplet, and {dh \\\\over dt}is the change in droplet height over time. To simplify most calculations, the applied force is assumed to be constant. Visualization of surface-to-surface contact; asperity highlighted in red. = Newtonian fluids = Several equations accurately model Newtonian droplet sizes under different initial conditions. Consideration of a single asperity, or surface protrusion, allows for measurement of a very specific cross-section of a droplet. To measure macroscopic squeeze flow effects, models exist for two the most common surfaces: circular and rectangular plate squeeze flows.alt=  Single asperity  For single asperity squeeze flow: \\\\frac{h_0}{h}=\\\\left (1+\\\\frac{5*F*t*h_0^2}{4*\\\\eta*W*L_0^3}\\\\right )^{1/5} Where 2h_0 is the initial height of the droplet, 2h is the final height of the droplet, F is the applied squeezing force, t is the squeezing time, \\\\eta is the fluid viscosity, W is the width of the assumed rectangular plate, and 2L_0 is the initial length of the droplet. Based on conservation of mass calculations, the droplet width is inversely proportional to droplet height; as the width increases, the height decreases in response to squeezing forces.Grewell, D., Benatar, A., & Park, J. (2013). Plastics and composites welding handbook. New York: Hanser. Circular plate squeeze flow diagram at initial and follow-on conditions; circular plates (gray), droplet (hash marked ellipse between both plates).

Rectangular plate  alt= For rectangular plate squeeze flow: \\\\frac{h_0}{h}=\\\\left (1+\\\\frac{F*t*h_0^2}{2*\\\\mu*W*L^3}\\\\right )^{1/2} These calculations assume a melt layer that has a length much larger than the sample width and thickness. = Non-Newtonian fluids = Simplifying calculations for Newtonian fluids allows for basic analysis of squeeze flow, but many polymers can exhibit properties of non-Newtonian fluids, such as viscoelastic characteristics, under deformation. The power law fluid model is sufficient to describe behaviors above the melting temperature for semicrystalline thermoplastics or the glass transition temperature for amorphous thermoplastics, and the Bingham fluid model provides calculations based on variations in yield stress calculations.  Power law fluid  For squeeze flow in a power law fluid: \\\\frac{h_0}{h}=\\\\left ( 1+t*(\\\\frac{2n+3}{4n+2})(\\\\frac{(4*h_0*L_0)^{n+1}*F*(n+2)}{(2*L_0)^{2n+3}*W*m})^{1/n}\\\\right )^{n/2n+3} Where m (or K) is the flow consistency index and n is the dimensionless flow behavior index. m=m_0*exp\\\\left ( \\\\frac{-E_a}{R*T} \\\\right ) Where m is the flow consistency index, m_0is the initial flow consistency index, E_ais the activation energy, Ris the universal gas constant, and Tis the absolute temperature. During experimentation to determine the accuracy of the power law fluid model, observations showed that modeling slow squeeze flow generated inaccurate power law constants (mand n) using a standard viscometer, and fast squeeze flow demonstrated that polymers may exhibit better lubrication than current constitutive models will predict. The current empirical model for power law fluids is relatively accurate for modeling inelastic flows, but certain kinematic flow assumptions and incomplete understanding of polymeric lubrication properties tend to provide inaccurate modeling of power law fluids.  Bingham fluid  Bingham fluids exhibit uncommon characteristics during squeeze flow. While undergoing compression, Bingham fluids should fail to move and act as a solid until achieving a yield stress; however, as the parallel plates move closer together, the fluid shows some radial movement. One study proposes a ‚Äúbiviscosity‚Äù model where the Bingham fluid retains some unyielded regions that maintain solid-like properties, while other regions yield and allow for some compression and outward movement. \\\\tau = \\\\begin{cases} \\\\eta_2*{du \\\\over dy}+\\\\tau_1, & \\\\text{if }\\\\tau\\\\geq\\\\tau_1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\eta_1*{du \\\\over dy}, & \\\\text{if }\\\\tau<\\\\tau_1 \\\\end{cases} Where \\\\eta_2 is the known viscosity of the Bingham fluid, \\\\eta_1 is the \\"paradoxical\\" viscosity of the solid-like state, and \\\\tau_1 is the biviscosity region stress. To determine this new stress: \\\\tau_0=\\\\tau_1(1-\\\\epsilon) Where \\\\tau_0 is the yield stress and \\\\epsilon=\\\\frac{\\\\eta_2}{\\\\eta_1} is the dimensionless viscosity ratio. If \\\\epsilon=1, the fluid exhibits Newtonian behavior; as \\\\epsilon\\\\rightarrow0, the Bingham model applies.Wilson, S. (1993). Squeezing flow of a Bingham material. Journal of Non-Newtonian Fluid Mechanics, 47, 211-219. doi:10.1016/0377-0257(93)80051-c  Applications  Squeeze flow application is prevalent in several science and engineering fields. Modeling and experimentation assist with understanding the complexities of squeeze flow during processes such as rheological testing, hot plate welding, and composite material joining. = Rheological testing = Squeeze flow rheometry allows for evaluation of polymers under wide ranges of temperatures, shear rates, and flow indexes. Parallel plate plastometers provide analysis for high viscosity materials such as rubber and glass, cure times for epoxy resins, and fiber-filled suspension flows.Macosko, C. W., & Larson, R. G. (1994). Rheology: Principles, measurements, and applications. New York: VCH. While viscometers provide useful results for squeeze flow measurements, testing conditions such as applied rotation rates, material composition, and fluid flow behaviors under shear may require the use of rheometers or other novel setups to obtain accurate data. Hot plate welding; (a) Heating Phase, (b) Change-over Phase, (c) Joining Phase. Polymer materials (gray), heating element (red), melt layers (orange), squeeze out regions (orange, hash mark borders). = Hot plate welding = During conventional hot plate welding, a successful joining phase depends on proper maintenance of squeeze flow to ensure that pressure and temperature create an ideal weld. Excessive pressure causes squeeze out of valuable material and weakens the bond due to fiber realignment in the melt layer, while failure to allow cooling to room temperature creates weak, brittle welds that crack or break completely during use. = Composite material joining = Prevalent in the aerospace and automotive industries, composites serve as expensive, yet mechanically strong, materials in the construction of several types of aircraft and vehicles. While aircraft parts are typically composed of thermosetting polymers, thermoplastics may become an analog to permit increased manufacturing of these stronger materials through their melting abilities and relatively inexpensive raw materials. Characterization and testing of thermoplastic composites experiencing squeeze flow allow for study of fiber orientations within the melt and final products to determine weld strength. Fiber strand length and size show significant effects on material strength,Picher-Martel, G., Levy, A., & Hubert, P. (2015).

It served as the high school for black students until the public schools were integrated in 1968. History For most of its history, Collier County did not provide for education of the black youth of Naples. They were allowed to attend schools in Fort Myers, a one hour bus trip, and later to Bethune School in Immokalee. In the 1950s, schools for elementary-school aged blacks were opened, and grades were added year-by-year until by 1959 they reached high-school level and George Washington Carver High School was founded. There were two teachers provided for the school. Athletics were segregated as well, so the teams had to travel long distances for games. Blacks were not allowed to attend the Naples High School's games, but were permitted to watch through the fence. The school graduated a total of 33 students in its 9 year history. In the mid 1960s, Collier County School superintendent Bill Reynolds integrated the faculty of Naples High School by moving Herbert Cambridge, a teacher at Carver, to Naples. Unlike many segregated districts in Florida, there was no court order and black students were assigned to white schools with little public comment in 1968. The school site now houses the River Park Community Center as well as the George Washington Carver public housing project.

Life  Arnold Buchthal was the son of Rosa and Felix Buchthal. His mother was the first woman in the Dortmund city council, while his father ran a coffee import and roasting facility with some branches in the city. Arnold grew up in the new building built by the parents at Bornstra√üe 19. He graduated from high school in 1918 at the Municipal Gymnasium. As part of his law studies he came in 1923 as a trainee to the Higher Regional Court Hamm and 1924 to Dortmund district court. Later he was district and county magistrate with an annual salary of 7800 Reichsmark. He spoke five languages. With the seizure of power by the National Socialists in January 1933, within a few months all Jewish citizens in civil servant positions were dismissed. Arnold Buchthal, son of Jewish parents, \\"full Jew\\" in Nazi jargon, was one of them. He received his dismissal from the Prussian Ministry of Justice on July 7, 1933. He and his wife Grete could barely pay for the medical delivery costs of the second daughter (the businesswoman and philanthropist Steve Shirley) in September 1933. The family emigrated to Austria at the end of 1933. After the annexation of Austria by the German Reich in 1938, the survival of Jews became problematic there. To save the lives of their daughters, the parents in 1939 sent them off with a Kindertransport from Vienna to England. Renate, born in 1929, emigrated to Australia much later, Vera became one of England's most successful entrepreneurs in the 1970s and was named Dame Stephanie in 1980. Arnold Buchthal and his wife Grete (n√©e Schick), born in Krems, Austria, separated. The main reason for the discord was Grete's accusation of having to suffer as a non-Jew from his political problems. Arnold Buchthal emigrated to Switzerland and little later to England. Like all male adults who fled Nazi Germany, he was considered an \\"enemy alien\\". The British immigration authorities deported him ‚Äì along with some 2,000 Jewish refugees and 400 German and Italian prisoners of war ‚Äì to Australia in 1940, where they were sent to the prison camp in Hay, New South Wales. Only a debate in the British Parliament ensured that the survivors of that incarceration came back to England. From 1941 on Arnold Buchthal belonged to an auxiliary team of British troops. After the Second World War Buchthal transferred to the American Army and was called as a translator to the Nuremberg war crimes trials. Among other things, he had to explain to the US judges words like \\"Polnisches Untermenschentum\\", a racist term in Nazi language. Arnold Buchthal moved to Offenbach and went into civil service. Until October 1957 he was senior prosecutor of the Frankfurt district court. In this function he had to deal with the pending case against the Nazi war criminals Adolf Eichmann and his deputy Hermann Krumey. Buchthal cooperated in this matter with his colleague Fritz Bauer, who the Attorney General of Hesse, and the driving force to organize the Frankfurt Auschwitz trials. Buchthal also received criticism: As prosecutor he acted rashly against a controversial election campaign ad published in several newspapers in 1957. As a result he was transferred as Senate President at the Higher Regional Court to Darmstadt. Buchthal died in Italy in 1965.

Charlotte was born in Massachusetts and at six-years old moved to Utah with her mother as new members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), her mother later becoming Brigham Young's fifth plural wife. Charlotte, previously a plural wife herself, spoke out against polygamy and gained much opposition from polygamous women suffragists because of it. Her first marriage was to William S. Godbe, the leader of the Godbeite offshoot from the LDS Church. After divorcing Godbe, Kirby married John Kirby, a non-LDS man, and they were together until Charlotte's death in 1908. Charlotte was a leading figure of the Utah Territory Woman Suffrage Association, and served as a correspondent to the government and other suffragist organizations, including the National Women's Suffrage Association. Charlotte often traveled to the East Coast to deliver lectures regarding women's rights and temperance, the first Utah woman and the first woman with voting rights to speak to national suffragist audiences. Charlotte Ives Cobb Kirby died on January 24, 1908, at age 71 in Salt Lake City, Utah.  Women's Rights and Suffrage  = Suffrage in Utah = After the enfranchisement of women in Wyoming in December 1869, the Utah territorial legislature granted Utah women the right to vote in 1870. Shortly before enacting enfranchisement, Salt Lake received reports that Congress threatened to disenfranchise the women of Utah because of the nationally unpopular practice of polygamy of the LDS Church, predominant in Utah. After being informed of these reports and anti-polygamist ideas, Territorial Secretary S. A. Mann signed the bill to enfranchise women in the territory of Utah on February 12, 1870. This enfranchisement raised national attention as it brought in forty times more eligible women than Wyoming did, the majority of women being members of the LDS Church. Congress as well as suffrage organizations like the National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA) thought the enfranchisement in Utah would lead to women voting for the end of polygamy. On the other hand, LDS members expected women's suffrage to strengthen their religious traditions by empowering women during the practice of polygamy. Utah petitioned for statehood through the 1880s. Congress denied Utah's petition for statehood, proposing instead to admit them if women were disenfranchised. Additionally, the Edmunds-Tucker Act stripped all Utah women of their voting rights because suffrage did not end polygamy. Suffragist Belva Ann Lockwood began campaigning that the fight was not only for ‚ÄúMormon‚Äô female votes‚Äù but for ‚Äúwoman‚Äôs equal rights in principle.‚Äù After this campaign, suffragists were accused of supporting polygamy. Suffragists such as Susan B. Anthony attempted to clarify their intentions of solely advocating women's suffrage, not polygamy, and continued fighting for the vote in the west. This association with polygamy tainted the public view of the national suffrage movement and its associations with LDS suffragists. Suffragists continued to fight for Utah's women's suffrage and many visited Utah in 1895. Leading the Rocky Mountain Suffrage Conference held in Salt Lake City, Susan B. Anthony and Anna Howard Shaw aided in the formation of a suffrage association in Utah called the Utah Territory Woman Suffrage Association as many Utah men wanted to abandon women's suffrage in order to obtain statehood. = Kirby's Role in Suffrage = right As the Utah territorial legislature proposed a state constitution that made polygamy illegal and did not include women's right to vote, radical suffragists took a stand against this. Charlotte Ives Cobb Kirby was one of those influential Utah feminists that fought for women's suffrage in Utah. Charlotte's dedication to the suffrage movement was inspired by her mother, Augusta Adams Cobb. Charlotte explained in a letter to Wilford Woodruff in 1889 that in Boston, Augusta had been close friends with suffragist Lucy Stone, and that Charlotte had maintained that friendship. On her deathbed, Augusta made Charlotte promise that she would continue the work of woman suffrage. She fulfilled her mother's wish. During the 1870s, Charlotte became very involved in the Woman's Suffrage Movement. On a visit east in 1871 with her first husband, she appeared at a suffrage meeting in Providence, Rhode Island. In May 1871, she was made the Utah delegate to the National Woman's Suffrage Educational Committee of the United States. In July 1871, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony of NWSA visited Utah at the invitation of the Godbeites. Charlotte and Godbe met the suffragists at the train station and hosted their stay in Utah. Stanton and Anthony were also invited by Brigham Young to speak to women at the Mormon Tabernacle.Iversen, Joan. \\"The Mormon- Suffrage Relationship: Personal and Political Quandries.\\" In Battle for the Ballot: Essays on Woman Suffrage in Utah, 1870-1896, edited by Carol Cornwall Madsen, 150-169. Logan, Utah: Utah State University Press, 1997. After speaking at the Tabernacle, they spoke to the Godbeites at their newly dedicated Liberal Institute, and then to the Godbeite women, the Ladies Mututal Improvement Society. After their visit, Charlotte maintained close ties with these suffragists and the national suffrage movement. Charlotte was a prominent figure in the Utah Territory Woman Suffrage Association by writing articles and corresponding with other suffragists and local and national governments. Although they did not get along, Charlotte worked alongside Utah suffragist Emmeline B. Wells in the Utah Territory Woman Suffrage Association; they debated the statehood proposal that would deny women their voting rights in Utah. Emmeline, however, was often skeptical of Charlotte. She was polygamous and advocated for that practice and woman suffrage simultaneously. She expressed her feelings that Charlotte could not be a representative for the women in Utah because she did not advocate for polygamy or the LDS Church before woman's suffrage. In other words, Wells saw women's suffrage as a means for improving the general public's perceptions of Mormon women and the LDS Church, while Charlotte saw women's suffrage as a separate issue from the LDS Church. While Charlotte played an active role in the national women's suffrage movement, she also advocated for the national temperance movement. She consistently traveled to the East Coast to deliver lectures on temperance and women's suffrage. The Salt Lake Herald-Republican newspaper shared the success Charlotte had giving a lecture on temperance in New York on March 14, 1881. She promoted the Temperance Club of Salt Lake City, which a Mr. Bradley served as president. Along with other LDS members, she sought to work with people of other religions to advance the temperance movement.  Personal life  = Early Years = Charlotte Ives Cobb (nicknamed \\"Lottie\\") was born in 1837 in Boston, Massachusetts, to Henry Cobb and Augusta Adams Cobb. Augusta listened to an LDS (Mormon) leader preach in Boston and converted to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints despite her husband's disapproval; after many years of practicing her religion secretly, Augusta left her husband and five of her children in the 1840s to join the LDS community in Nauvoo, Illinois. Augusta took two of her children with her; six-year old Charlotte Ives and Brigham. Brigham Cobb died shortly after the journey. In Nauvoo, Augusta married Brigham Young as one of his first plural wives and was sealed (part of the marriage ceremony of the LDS Church) for eternity in the Mormon temple. Charlotte was brought up as Young's daughter and described Young as being affectionate and concerned with her education. In 1848, Augusta and Charlotte traveled to Utah, but they always maintained their social ties to family and friends in the East. Augusta later requested to have her eternal sealing to Young cancelled so that she could be sealed to the deceased Joseph Smith, while still remaining sealed and married to Young. Young complied and stood proxy as Joseph Smith for this sealing. Despite this change in her mother's relationship, Young remained the effective father of Charlotte. = Marriages = left  William S. Godbe  In April 1869, Charlotte was married to William S. Godbe as his fourth wife, and Brigham Young performed the sealing ceremony. In the fall of 1869, Godbe was excommunicated from the LDS church, along with Elias L. T. Harrison, for his criticisms of Brigham Young's economic policies and his adoption of spiritualism. After his excommunication, Godbe and his followers, including Thomas B. Stenhouse and Edward Tullidge, started the Church of Zion, a group often referred to as the Godbeites. The Godbeites were known for their liberal economic and social views and their help in forming the Liberal Party of Utah. Notably, they were helpful in creating a relationship with Eastern suffragists Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton; when these two women came to visit Utah for the first time in 1871, it was at the invitation of the Godbeites. Charlotte and William Godbe met them at the train station and Godbe opened his home for them to stay at while in Utah. While Charlotte's relationship with these and other Eastern suffragists continued, her marriage to Godbe did not. After publicly denouncing polygamy in July 1871, Godbe slowly divorced all of his wives except for the first. Charlotte and Godbe separated in 1873, but their divorce was not finalized until 1879. Out of Godbe's four wives, Charlotte was the only one who did not leave the LDS church after Godbe's excommunication.Beeton, Beverly. \\"Woman Suffrage in Territorial Utah.\\" In Battle for the Ballot: Essyas on Woman Suffrage in Utah, 1870-1896, edited by Carol Cornwall Madsen, 116-135. After distancing herself from Godbe and polygamy, she established a better relationship with national suffrage organizations.  John Kirby  In 1884, Charlotte remarried a man named John Kirby. Twenty years her junior, Kirby was a wealthy mine owner and was not a member of the LDS church.Beeton, Beverly. \\"A Feminist among the Mormons: Charlotte Ives Cobb Godbe Kirby.\\" In Battle for the Ballot: Essays on Women Suffrage in Utah, 1870-1896, edited by Carol Cornwall Madsen, 137-149.

Biography  Waley was born in Nelson, New Zealand in 29 April 1901. In late 1920, she began writing children's page called the \\"Fairy Ring\\" which come out every Saturday in The Evening Post published in Wellington, New Zealand. She wrote under the name Fairiel and was producing most of the writing and drawing for the page. Waley was also a well known poet and associate of Robin Hyde. Some of her poetry was published in 1930 in an anthology of New Zealand poetry titled Kowhai Gold. In 1929, she traveled to London, sold her return ticket to New Zealand, and then began working in publishing. That same year, she met Arthur Waley. They would remain lovers for the rest of Arthur's life. Her relationship with him is the subject of her memoir. Waley met Arthur at a literary restaurant called Antoine's located on Charlotte Street. Waley was on an Antipodian Grand Tour. After meeting at the restaurant, she and Arthur talked and she \\"became emamoured before she realised that he was her hero, Arthur Waley, whose translations were the only book she had brought with her.\\" At the time, Arthur's patron and possible lover, Beryl de Zoete, asked him to leave Waley. Waley went on to marry Hugh Ferguson Robinson and had a son, John. She would stay married to Robinson for fifteen years. Arthur and Alison home at 50 Southwood Lane in Highgate, London Waley and her family moved London, where she worked for a publisher. She started writing poetry and also worked on her memoir. She and Arthur met again during World War II. During this time, she and Arthur would meet, despite de Zoete trying to keep them apart. De Zoete even intercepted letters between the couple. After de Zoete died in 1962, Arthur felt able to devote himself to Waley. A month before Arthur died in 1966, he and Waley married. Alison and he had been living together in his home at Highgate, but only his closest friends knew about their love affair. Alison Wiley continued to live at Highgate until her death on 21 May 2001.  Work  The accuracy of various accounts in her memoir, A Half of Two Lives, published in 1983, are disputed. In his review of the book in The New York Times, Humphrey Carpenter describes Waley's recollection of when she and Arthur first met as \\"one of many scarcely credible incidents in this strange book.\\" Nonetheless, through this book, she follows her relationship with Arthur, her marriage to another man, his marriage to another woman, and the feelings of love and longing. In the last months of his life, after his wife had died, Alison and Arthur wed. In spite of the various unsubstantiated parts of the book, Carpenter nonetheless declared the book to be a \\"kind of mad, splendid poem in itself,\\" attributing certain distortions of reality in the book to the confusing, maddening treatment Alison endured throughout the relationship. Waley also adapted Chinese folktales, such as Dear Monkey, which was published in 1973.

The Cromwell Argus was founded by James Matthews and George Fenwick, and was instrumental in the latter's career. Matthews and Fenwick were colleagues at the Otago Daily Times. Matthews bought the Tuapeka Press and Goldfields Advocate and offered Fenwick a partnership, and Fenwick's younger brother William a job. Tuapeka proved too small for two newspapers and when they were offered ¬£150 from their competition, the Tuapeka Times, they sold the rights to their newspaper to them. Looking for other opportunities, Matthews and Fenwick identified Cromwell that did not have a newspaper yet. When they investigated the town in detail in October 1868, they found that Robert Carrick intended to set one up. When Carrick agreed to drop his venture Matthews and Fenwick proceeded, only to find that Carrick had changed his mind and was also going ahead with his Cromwell Guardian. The last issue of the Tuapeka Press and Goldfields Advocate was printed on Wednesday, 3 November 1868 and after the normal print run, they changed the masthead to read The Cromwell Argus and printed the first issue in Lawrence. Fenwick rode by horse from Tuapeka to Cromwell and by the following Monday had distributed the 500 copies printed for the first issue. As they explained in their first edition, it did thus not contain any local Cromwell news. Their rival paper, the Cromwell Guardian, did not last for long. Proprietors of The Cromwell Argus In 1871, George Fenwick transferred his part-ownership to this younger brother and moved to Dunedin. In 1875, William Fenwick and Matthews sold The Cromwell Argus to Stephen Noble Brown. Subsequent ownership changes took place in 1887 (Thomas McCracken), 1899 (Abel Warburton), 1905 (James Goodger), 1920 (Richard Grose Vercoe), 1927 (James Robert Munro), and 1943 (William Washington Webb). The last edition of The Cromwell Argus was issued on 26 October 1948. The newspaper office was in Melmore Terrace, Cromwell's main street. When the Clyde Dam was filled in 1990 it flooded most of that main street. Many buildings from the 1860s were rebuilt on higher ground and now form the town's heritage precinct. The office building of The Cromwell Argus is one of those relocated buildings.

One of these was Christ on the Cross, which was so admired by the artist's contemporaries that Seville's city council suggested he moved there permanently in 1629. As in Diego Velasquez's 1632 Christ Crucified, the artist shows Christ's two feet nailed separately - the number of nails used to crucify Christ was then a matter of controversy, with Bridget of Sweden writing of four nails. Both works also draw on a Counter Reformation trend after the Council of Trent to depictions focusing solely on Christ rather than those gathered around the cross.

Identified as Portrait de la M. Elisab[eth] de la croix de J√©sus, fondatrice de l'instit[ution] de N[ot]re Dame du refuge des vierges et des filles p√©nit[entes] √† Nancy en Lorraine. Marie Elisabeth de Ranfaing (30 October 1592 ‚Äì 1 January 1649) also known as Marie Elisabeth de la Croix de Jesus was the French founder of the Order of Refuge, and a Catholic woman once claimed to be demonically possessed. Biography Elisabeth de Ranfaing was born on October 30, 1592 at Remiremont, Lorraine to the lesser nobles, Jean-Lienard Ranfaing and Claude de Magnieres. She was forced into wedlock by her parents to marry the much older nobleman Francois Dubois, to whom she had no desire to marry so she fled to the monastery for refuge. In 1618, she was recovered and married to Dubois, to whom she had three children.Ferber, Sarah (2005).

Rituals, Images and Words: Varieties of Cultural Expression in Late Medieval and Early Modern Europe. Turnhout, Belgium: Brepols Publishers Later that year she became 'demonically possessed' at a social event. This possession lasted till 1625, relenting after a length exorcism. French professor and early sceptic, Claude Pithoys, was called in to perform an exorcism but he instead declared his suspicion that Ranfaing had been drugged by the local doctor, Charles Poirot, into convulsions simulating demonic possession. Pithoys was dismissed and another less skeptical doctor, Remy Pichard, was brought in, to perform the Exorcism. Poirot was burned in 1622 for his suspected witchcraft. Ranfaing later claimed Poirot, had charmed her into demonic possession.. Skepticism has been placed on Poirot's guilt in modern times with √âtienne Delcambre and Jean Lhermitte doubting that the doctor's drug would persist in convulsions for the seven years Ranfaing was possessed. Claiming instead that fabricated her own possession to integrate herself in the religious society of France. She was widowed at 24 and on January 1, 1631 she founded the Order of Refuge for women recovering from a life of prostitution. In 1634, Pope Urban VIII approved the order. Ranfaing died on January the 14th, 1649 in Nancy, France. In popular culture In Fran√ßoise Mallet-Joris's book Trois √¢ges de la nuit, Mallet-Joris presents a fictionalised account of Elisabeth de Ranfaing's life along with the witch trials of two other 16th and 17th century figures accused of witchcraft.

A significant body of research has explored \\"overuse\\" phenomena, commonly known as \\"digital addictions\\", or \\"digital dependencies\\". These phenomena manifest differently in many societies and cultures. Some experts have investigated the benefits of moderate digital media use in various domains, including in mental health, and the treatment of mental health problems with novel technological solutions. The delineation between beneficial and pathological use of digital media has not been established. There are no widely accepted diagnostic criteria, although some experts consider overuse a manifestation of underlying psychiatric disorders. The prevention and treatment of pathological digital media use is also not standardised, although guidelines for safer media use for children and families have been developed. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) and the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) do not include diagnoses for problematic internet use and problematic social media use; the ICD-11 include diagnosis for gaming disorder (commonly known as video game addiction), whereas the DSM-5 does not. Experts are still debating how and when to diagnose these conditions. The use of the term addiction to refer to these phenomena and diagnoses has also been questioned. Digital media and screen time have changed how children think, interact and develop in positive and negative ways, but researchers are unsure about the existence of hypothesised causal links between digital media use and mental health outcomes. Those links appear to depend on the individual and the platforms they use. Several large technology firms have made commitments or announced strategies to try to reduce the risks of digital media use.  History and terminology  A young boy engaged with a smartphone The relationship between digital technology and mental health has been investigated from many perspectives. Benefits of digital media use in childhood and adolescent development have been found. Concerns have been expressed by researchers, clinicians and the public in regard to apparent compulsive behaviours of digital media users, as correlations between technology overuse and mental health problems become apparent. Terminologies used to refer to compulsive digital-media-use behaviours are not standardised or universally recognised. They include \\"digital addiction\\", \\"digital dependence\\", \\"problematic use\\", or \\"overuse\\", often delineated by the digital media platform used or under study (such as problematic smartphone use or problematic internet use). Unrestrained use of technological devices may affect developmental, social, mental and physical well-being and may result in symptoms akin to other psychological dependence syndromes, or behavioural addictions. The focus on problematic technology use in research, particularly in relation to the behavioural addiction paradigm, is becoming more accepted, despite poor standardisation and conflicting research. Internet addiction has been proposed as a diagnosis since the mid-1990s, and social media and its relation to addiction has been examined since 2009. A 2018 Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development (OECD) report noted the benefits of structured and limited internet use in children and adolescents for developmental and educational purposes, but that excessive use can have a negative impact on mental well-being. It also noted an overall 40% increase in internet use in school-age children between 2010 and 2015, and that different OECD nations had marked variations in rates of childhood technology use, as well as differences in the platforms used. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders has not formally codified problematic digital media use in diagnostic categories, but it deemed internet gaming disorder to be a condition for further study in 2013. Gaming disorder, commonly known as video game addiction, has been recognised in the ICD-11. Different recommendations in the DSM and the ICD are due partly to the lack of expert consensus, the differences in emphasis in the classification manuals, as well as difficulties utilising animal models for behavioural addictions. The utility of the term addiction in relation to overuse of digital media has been questioned, in regard to its suitability to describe new, digitally mediated psychiatric categories, as opposed to overuse being a manifestation of other psychiatric disorders. Usage of the term has also been criticised for drawing parallels with substance use behaviours. Careless use of the term may cause more problems‚Äîboth downplaying the risks of harm in seriously affected people, as well as overstating risks of excessive, non-pathological use of digital media. The evolution of terminology relating excessive digital media use to problematic use rather than addiction was encouraged by Panova and Carbonell, psychologists at Ramon Llull University, in a 2018 review. Due to the lack of recognition and consensus on the concepts used, diagnoses and treatments are difficult to standardise or develop. Heightened levels of public anxiety around new media (including social media, smartphones and video games) further obfuscate population-based assessments, as well as posing management dilemmas. Radesky and Christakis, the 2019 editors of JAMA Paediatrics, published a review that investigated \\"concerns about health and developmental/behavioural risks of excessive media use for child cognitive, language, literacy, and social-emotional development.\\" Due to the ready availability of multiple technologies to children worldwide, the problem is bi-directional, as taking away digital devices may have a detrimental effect, in areas such as learning, family relationship dynamics, and overall development. Problematic use Though associations have been observed between digital media use and mental health symptoms or diagnoses, causality has not been established; nuances and caveats published by researchers are often misunderstood by the general public, or misrepresented by the media. Females are more likely to overuse social media, and males video games. Following from this, problematic digital media use may not be singular constructs, may be delineated based on the digital platform used, or reappraised in terms of specific activities (rather than addiction to the digital medium). =Mental health= A 2019 systematic map of reviews suggested associations between some types of potentially problematic internet use and psychiatric or behavioural problems such as depression, anxiety, hostility, aggression and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The studies could not determine if causal relationships exist, reviewers emphasising the importance of future prospective study designs. While overuse of digital media has been associated with depressive symptoms, digital media may also be utilized in some situations to improve mood. Symptoms of ADHD have been positively correlated with digital media use in a large prospective study. The ADHD symptom of hyperfocus may cause affected individuals to overuse video games, social media, or online chatting, however; the correlation between hyperfocus and problematic social media use is weak. A 2016 technical report by Chassiakos, Radesky, and Christakis identified benefits and concerns in adolescent mental health regarding digital media use. It showed that the manner of social media use was the key factor, rather than the amount of time engaged. A decline in well-being and life-satisfaction was found in older adolescents who passively consumed social media, but these were not apparent in those who were more actively engaged. The report also found a U-shaped curvilinear relationship in the amount of time spent on digital media, with risk of depression increasing at both the low and high ends of internet use. A 2018 review into the Chinese social media platform WeChat found associations of self-reported mental health symptoms with excessive platform use. However, the motivations and usage patterns of WeChat users affected overall psychological health, rather than the amount of time spent using the platform. In the United Kingdom, a study of 1,479 individuals aged compared psychological benefits and problems for five large social media platforms: Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter and YouTube. It concluded that YouTube was the only platform with a net positive rating \\"based on the 14 health and wellbeing-related questions\\", and the other platforms measured had net negative ratings, Instagram having the lowest rating. The study identified Instagram as having some positive effects including self-expression, self- identity, and community, but found that these were outweighed by the negative effects, specifically on sleep, body image, and \\"fear of missing out\\". A report published in Clinical Psychological Science in 2018 featured two cross- sectional surveys of 506,820 American high school students, and found that use of digital media was associated with higher rates of depressive symptoms and suicidality. They concluded that more time engaged with electronic devices, and less time on \\"non-screen activities\\" (such as in-person social interaction, sports/exercise, homework, and attending religious services) was correlated with depressive symptoms and suicide-related outcomes (suicidal ideation, plans, and attempts), especially among girls. A later report in the same publication questioned the survey's research methodology, citing \\"inaccurate research measurements, negligible correlations between the main variables, [and] insufficient and inadequate statistical analyses\\". The relationship between bipolar disorder and technology use has been investigated in a singular survey of 84 participants for Computers in Human Behavior. The survey found marked variations in technology use based on self-reported mood states. The authors of the report then postulated that for patients with bipolar disorder, technology may be a \\"double-edged sword\\", with potential benefits and harms. FoMO, or Fear of Missing Out, is a disruptive behavioral phenomenon that causes emotional stress. Studies show that the more social media accounts an individual has, the higher chance they have FoMO. There is a direct correlation between the number of accounts an individual has and the individual's levels of anxiety and depression. There is no significant link between ethnicity and FoMO/overall loneliness meaning anxiety and depression caused by FoMO from social media is consistent across the board for all ethnicities. A US study done in 2019 found an association between social media and depression in adolescence. Based on the upward social comparison, it may be that repeated exposure to idealized images lowers adolescents‚Äô self-esteem, triggers depression, and enhances depression over time. Furthermore, heavier users of social media with depression appear to be more negatively affected by their time spent on social media, potentially by the nature of information that they select (eg, blog posts about self-esteem issues), consequently potentially maintaining and enhancing depression over time. =Screen time= A systematic examination of reviews, published in 2019, concluded that evidence, although of mainly low to moderate quality, showed an association of screen time with a variety of health problems including: \\"adiposity, unhealthy diet, depressive symptoms and quality of life\\". They also concluded that moderate use of digital media may have benefits for young people in terms of social integration, a curvilinear relationship found with both depressive symptoms and overall well-being. A research study done on urban adolescents in China revealed that more than a quarter of adolescents in China were exposed to over 2 hours of screen time per day. They found that screen time and physical activity was independently associated with mental health. Specifically, an increase in screen time and decrease in physical activity contributed to an additional risk for mental health productivity by increasing depressive anxiety symptoms and life dissatisfaction. A 2017 UK large-scale study of the \\"Goldilocks hypothesis\\"‚Äîof avoiding both too much and too little digital media use‚Äîwas described as the \\"best quality\\" evidence to date by experts and non-government organisations (NGOs) reporting to a 2018 UK parliamentary committee. That study concluded that modest digital media use may have few adverse affects, and some positive associations in terms of well- being. = Proposed diagnostic categories = Gaming disorder has been considered by the DSM-5 task force as warranting further study (as the subset internet gaming disorder), and was included in the ICD-11. Concerns have been raised by Aarseth and colleagues over this inclusion, particularly in regard to stigmatisation of heavy gamers. Christakis has asserted that internet addiction may be \\"a 21st century epidemic\\". In 2018, he commented that childhood Internet overuse may be a form of \\"uncontrolled experiment[s] on [...] children\\". International estimates of the prevalence of internet overuse have varied considerably, with marked variations by nation. A 2014 meta- analysis of 31 nations yielded an overall worldwide prevalence of six percent. A different perspective in 2018 by Musetti and colleagues reappraised the internet in terms of its necessity and ubiquity in modern society, as a social environment, rather than a tool, thereby calling for the reformulation of the internet addiction model. Some medical and behavioural scientists recommend adding a diagnosis of \\"social media addiction\\" (or similar) to the next Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders update. A 2015 review concluded there was a probable link between basic psychological needs and social media addiction. \\"Social network site users seek feedback, and they get it from hundreds of people‚Äîinstantly. It could be argued that the platforms are designed to get users 'hooked'.\\" Internet sex addiction, also known as cybersex addiction, has been proposed as a sexual addiction characterised by virtual internet sexual activity that causes serious negative consequences to one's physical, mental, social, and/or financial well-being. It may be considered a form of problematic internet use. =Related phenomena= Luckia Games, an online gambling provider  Online problem gambling  A 2015 review found evidence of higher rates of mental health comorbidities, as well as higher amounts of substance use, among internet gamblers, compared to non- internet gamblers. Causation, however, has not been established. The review postulates that there may be differences in the cohorts between internet and land-based problem gamblers. Cyberbullying Cyberbullying, bullying or harassment using social media or other electronic means, has been shown to have effects on mental health. Victims may have lower self-esteem, increased suicidal ideation, decreased motivation for usual hobbies, and a variety of emotional responses, including being scared, frustrated, angry, anxious or depressed. These victims may also begin to distance themselves from friends and family members. According to the EU Kids Online project, the incidence of cyberbullying across seven European countries in children aged increased from 8% to 12% between 2010 and 2014. Similar increases were shown in the United States and Brazil. Media multitasking Concurrent use of multiple digital media streams, commonly known as media multitasking, has been shown to be associated with depressive symptoms, social anxiety, impulsivity, sensation seeking, lower perceived social success and neuroticism. A 2018 review found that while the literature is sparse and inconclusive, overall, heavy media multitaskers also have poorer performance in several cognitive domains. One of the authors commented that the data does not \\"unambiguously show that media multitasking causes a change in attention and memory\\", therefore it is possible to argue that it is inefficient to multitask on digital media. =Assessment and treatment= Rigorous, evidence-based assessment of problematic digital media use is yet to be comprehensively established. This is due partially to a lack of consensus around the various constructs and lack of standardization of treatments. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has developed a Family Media Plan, intending to help parents assess and structure their family's use of electronic devices and media more safely. It recommends limiting entertainment screen time to two hours or less per day. The Canadian Paediatric Society produced a similar guideline. Ferguson, a psychologist, has criticised these and other national guidelines for not being evidence-based. Other experts, cited in a 2017 UNICEF Office of Research literature review, have recommended addressing potential underlying problems rather than arbitrarily enforcing screen time limits. Different methodologies for assessing pathological internet use have been developed, mostly self-report questionnaires, but none have been universally recognised as a gold standard. For gaming disorder, both the American Psychiatric Association and the World Health Organization (through the ICD-11) have released diagnostic criteria. There is some limited evidence of the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy and family-based interventions for treatment. In randomised controlled trials, medications have not been shown to be effective. A 2016 study of 901 adolescents suggested mindfulness may assist in preventing and treating problematic internet use. A 2019 UK parliamentary report deemed parental engagement, awareness and support to be essential in developing \\"digital resilience\\" for young people, and to identify and manage the risks of harm online. Treatment centers have proliferated in some countries, and China and South Korea have treated digital dependence as a public health crisis, opening 300 and 190 centers nationwide, respectively. Other countries have also opened treatment centers. NGOs, support and advocacy groups provide resources to people overusing digital media, with or without codified diagnoses, including the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. Mental health benefits alt=People using phones while walkingIndividuals with mental illness can develop social connections over social media, that may foster a sense of social inclusion in online communities. Sufferers of mental illness may share personal stories in a perceived safer space, as well as gaining peer support for developing coping strategies. People with mental illness are likely to report avoiding stigma and gaining further insight into their mental health condition by using social media. This comes with the risk of unhealthy influences, misinformation, and delayed access to traditional mental health outlets. Other benefits include connections to supportive online communities, including illness or disability specific communities, as well as the LGBTQI community. Furthermore, in children, the educational benefits of digital media use are well established. Other disciplines =Digital anthropology= Daniel Miller from University College London has contributed to the study of digital anthropology, especially ethnographic research on the use and consequences of social media and smartphones as part of the everyday life of ordinary people around the world. He notes the effects of social media are very specific to individual locations and cultures. He contends \\"a layperson might dismiss these stories as superficial. But the anthropologist takes them seriously, empathetically exploring each use of digital technologies in terms of the wider social and cultural context.\\" Digital anthropology is a developing field which studies the relationship between humans and digital-era technology. It aims to consider arguments in terms of ethical and societal scopes, rather than simply observing technological changes. Brian Solis, a digital analyst and anthropologist, stated in 2018, \\"we've become digital addicts: it's time to take control of technology and not let tech control us\\". =Digital sociology= Digital sociology explores how people utilise digital media using several research methodologies, including surveys, interviews, focus groups, and ethnographic research. It intersects with digital anthropology, and studies cultural geography. It also investigates longstanding concerns, and contexts around young people's overuse of \\"these technologies, their access to online pornography, cyber bullying or online sexual predation\\". A 2012 cross-sectional sociological study in Turkey showed differences in patterns of internet use that related to levels of religiosity in 2,698 subjects. With increasing religiosity, negative attitudes towards internet use increased. Highly religious people showed different motivations for internet use, predominantly searching for information. A study of 1,296 Malaysian adolescent students found an inverse relationship between religiosity and internet addiction tendency in females, but not males. A 2018 review published in Nature considered that young people may have different experiences online, depending on their socio-economic background, noting lower-income youths may spend up to three hours more per day using digital devices, compared to higher-income youths. They theorised that lower-income youths, who are already vulnerable to mental illness, may be more passive in their online engagements, being more susceptible to negative feedback online, with difficulty self-regulating their digital media use. It concluded that this may be a new form of digital divide between at-risk young people and other young people, pre-existing risks of mental illness becoming amplified among the already vulnerable population. =Neuroscience= Dar Meshi and colleagues noted in 2015 that are beginning to capitalise on the ubiquity of social media use to gain novel insights about social cognitive processes\\". A 2018 neuroscientific review published in Nature found the density of the amygdala, a brain region involved in emotional processing, is related to the size of both offline and online social networks in adolescents. They considered that this and other evidence \\"suggests an important interplay between actual social experiences, both offline and online, and brain development\\". The authors postulated that social media may have benefits, namely social connections with other people, as well as managing impressions people have of other people such as \\"reputation building, impression management, and online self-presentation\\". It identified \\"adolescence [as] a tipping point in development for how social media can influence their self- concept and expectations of self and others\\", and called for further study into the neuroscience behind digital media use and brain development in adolescence. Although brain-imaging modalities are under study, neuroscientific findings in individual studies often fail to be replicated in future studies, similar to other behavioural addictions; as of 2017, the exact biological or neural processes that could lead to excessive digital media use are unknown. Digital mental health care \\"Wellmind\\", a United Kingdom alt= Photograph of a screen from the \\"Wellmind\\" smartphone application Digital technologies have also provided opportunities for delivery of mental health care online; benefits have been found with computerised cognitive behavioural therapy for depression and anxiety. Research of digital health interventions in young people is preliminary, with a meta-review unable to draw firm conclusions because of problems in research methodology. Potential benefits according to one review include \\"the flexibility, interactivity, and spontaneous nature of mobile communications [...] in encouraging persistent and continual access to care outside clinical settings\\". Mindfulness based online intervention has been shown to have small to moderate benefits on mental health. The greatest effect size was found for the reduction of psychological stress. Benefits were also found regarding depression, anxiety, and well-being. Smartphone applications have proliferated in many mental health domains, with \\"demonstrably effective\\" recommendations listed in a 2016 review encouraging cognitive behavioural therapy, addressing both anxiety and mood. The review did however call for more randomised controlled trials to validate the effectiveness of their recommendations when delivered by digital apps. The Lancet commission on global mental health and sustainability report from 2018 evaluated both benefits and harms of technology. It considered the roles of technologies in mental health, particularly in public education; patient screening; treatment; training and supervision; and system improvement.  Industry and government  Several technology firms have implemented changes intending to mitigate the adverse effects of excessive use of their platforms, and in Japan, China and South Korea legislative and/or regulatory governmental efforts have been enacted to address the interrelated issues. In December 2017, Facebook admitted passive consumption of social media could be harmful to mental health, although they said active engagement can have a positive effect. In January 2018, the platform made major changes to increase user engagement. In January 2019, Facebook's then head of global affairs, Nick Clegg, responding to criticisms of Facebook and mental health concerns, stated they would do \\"whatever it takes to make this environment safer online especially for youngsters\\". Facebook admitted \\"heavy responsibilities\\" to the global community, and invited regulation by governments. In 2018 Facebook and Instagram announced new tools that they asserted may assist with overuse of their products. In 2019, Instagram, which has been investigated specifically in one study in terms of addiction, began testing a platform change in Canada to hide the number of \\"likes\\" and views that photos and videos received in an effort to create a \\"less pressurised\\" environment. It then continued this trial in Australia, Italy, Ireland, Japan, Brazil and New Zealand before extending the experiment globally in November of that year. The platform also developed artificial intelligence to counter cyberbullying. China's Ministry of Culture has enacted several public health efforts from as early as 2006 to address gaming and internet-related disorders. In 2007, an \\"Online Game Anti-Addiction System\\" was implemented for minors, restricting their use to 3 hours or less per day. The ministry also proposed a \\"Comprehensive Prevention Program Plan for Minors‚Äô Online Gaming Addiction\\" in 2013, to promulgate research, particularly on diagnostic methods and interventions. China's Ministry of Education in 2018 announced that new regulations would be introduced to further limit the amount of time spent by minors in online games. In response, Tencent, the owner of WeChat and the world's largest video game publisher, restricted the amount of time that children could spend playing one of its online games, to one hour per day for children 12 and under, and two hours per day for children aged . In 2018, Alphabet Inc. released an update for Android smartphones, including a dashboard app enabling users to set timers on application use. Apple Inc. purchased a third-party application and then incorporated it in iOS 12 to measure \\"screen time\\".

Two institutional investors in Apple Inc., JANA Partners LLC and the California State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS), stated in 2018 that they \\"believe[d] both the content and the amount of time spent on phones need to be tailored to youths\\". They called on Apple Inc. to act before regulators and consumers potentially force them to do so. Apple Inc. responded that they have, \\"always looked out for kids, and [they] work hard to create powerful products that inspire, entertain, and educate children while also helping parents protect them online\\". The firm is planning new features that they asserted may allow them to play a pioneering role in regard to young people's health.

Pata Zoo has operated since the beginning of 1983, along with the department store. For years it has been the focus of Thai animal rights activists who charge the zoo with inhumane treatment of animals. Layout The zoo is divided into two parts: Bua Noi *Sixth floor: Nocturnal animals, reptiles, and amphibians. Of interest are the many albino Burmese pythons, which the zoo is able to breed successfully. Also in captivity is a giant freshwater stingray, the largest freshwater stingray in the world and an endangered species. *Seventh floor: Birds, orangutans and monkeys, penguins, guinea pigs and rabbits, goats and sheep, Asian black bears, sun bears, tigers, leopard cats, leopards and black panther, golden jackals, artificial waterfall and botanical garden. Featured here is a 30 year-old female eastern gorilla named Bua Noi (‡∏ö‡∏±‡∏ß‡∏ô‡πâ‡∏≠‡∏¢, 'little lotus'), the only gorilla left in Thailand. Most critics of the Pata Zoo have focused on the living conditions of Bua Noi. She has been held captive in the zoo since 1987. The zoo veterinarian and zoo director insist that she is in good mental and physical health. Public outrage Animal rights activists submitted a petition of 35,000 signatures in September 2014 to Thailand's Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation (DNP) calling for the zoo's closure and the immediate removal of Bua Noi from the zoo. The DNP responded by declaring it could not withdraw the licence of Pata Zoo as the zoo had not done anything against the law. The DNP director-general argued that the Wildlife Conservation and Protection Act did not forbid animals from being caged in high-rise buildings and, therefore, Pata Zoo did not violate the law by maintaining a zoo on top of a building. The zoo immediately declared its innocence of any wrongdoing. In March 2015, it was reported that Thai authorities charged that Pata Zoo had broken several laws and ordered the removal of all large animals, including Bua Noi, from the zoo. The zoo refused to free the gorilla and give her to another zoo. , Bua Noi was still in captivity at the zoo.
