The village has a population of 14,112 (Male: 6,928 Female: 7,184) based on 2001 census data. Location A 13-km drive from Ponda brings you into Shiroda. It is located 36 kilometres east of the state capital Panaji, via NH4A. The village is bordered by the Zuari river on side and the villages of Bethora, Panchawadi, Nirankal and Borim on the other. Education Shiroda houses one of the engineering colleges of Goa, Shree Rayeshwar Institute of Engineering and Information Technology and two colleges of Alternative medicine, the Gomantak Ayurved Mahavidyalaya & Research Centre and Shri Kamaxshi Devi Homeopathic Medical College & Hospital. There are 20 govt primary schools one middle school 7 high schools and two higher secondary schools.  History and religious importance  The name \\"Shiroda\\" is derived from \\"Shivanath\\", which translates to \\"Drawn from god\\". Shiroda is very popular for its Kamakshi Temple. People visit this temple on Amavasya or New moon day of every month. Every year on the day of Shivaratri, a grand temple festival or zatra is held which is attended by thousands of devotees from Goa as well as Karnataka and Maharashtra. Other temples include Ravalnath (which is situated in Shiroda market) Hanuman, Mahamaya, Madhav, Veer Bhadra, Betal, Shivnath, Narayan Dev, Kelbai Sateri, Kshetrapal, Mahamaya, Brahma Durga, Bhagwati and Mandaleshwara. The village's oldest temple is Mandaleshwar, which was built in the eight century and houses the village deity (gram devta). Near the Madhav temple lies the holy place made of stone and mud, called Vato. It now lies in ruins. Shiroda has a church situated in Karai, namely St. Joseph Church, which holds Goa biggest cross. Shiroda community celebrates Shigmo, Dhendlo, carnival and; Dasara which is a day later then whole Goa's Dasara festival. The Dasara starts at Betal Temple and then proceeds to Valpeshwar Temple and then to Ravalnath Temple.

Body of the dead Christ, after Titian Together with Vorsterman, Schelte a Bolswert and Boetius √† Bolswert, Pontius became one of the leading engravers of the first generation who made reproductions after Rubens' works. When Vorsterman left for England in 1624 after he had a conflict with Rubens, Pontius took over from Vorsterman as Rubens' foremost engraver. He even took up lodgings in Rubens' house from 1624 to 1631. Pontius married three times. The names of his successive wives were: Christina Herselin, Catlyne van Eck and Helena Schryvers. He had respectively one son, two sons and three daughters, and one daughter with his spouses. His son Fran√ßois was an engraver and art dealer. By 1634 Pontius was living with his first wife Christina Herselin in the Everdijstraat in the house of his father-in-law. On 26 April 1634 the famous but impoverished genre painter Adriaen Brouwer took up lodgings in his house as the two men were close friends. The same year the pair joined the local chamber of rhetoric Violieren.F. Jos. van den Branden, Adriaan de Brouwer and Joos van Craesbeeck, Dela Montagne, 1882, p. 53‚Äì54 It has been suggested that Brouwer's painting called Fat man or Luxuria (Mauritshuis), which possibly represents the deadly sin of lust, is at the same time a portrait of Paulus Pontius.Karolien de Clippel; Adriaen Brouwer, Portrait Painter: New Identifications and an Iconographic Novelty, in: Simiolus: Netherlands Quarterly for the History of Art, Vol. 30, No. 3/4 (2003), Stichting Nederlandse Kunsthistorische Publicaties, pp. 196‚Äì216 Gaspar de Gusman, Count of Olivares, after Rubens After Rubens' death in 1640, Pontius created reproductions after the work of, amongst others, Rubens, Anthony van Dyck, Jacob Jordaens, Pieter van Avont, Abraham van Diepenbeeck, Anselm van Hulle, Gerard Seghers, Gaspar de Crayer, Gonzales Coques, Frans Luycx, Titian and Vel√°zquez. His pupils included Alexander Voet the Younger, Coenraet Waumans and Frans van den Wyngaerde. Work Pontius was able to develop early in his career a personal style characterized by precise drawing that renders the original painting accurately. He was a master in suggesting the effects of light and the colours in a very subtle manner. Pontius worked as one of the principal engravers for Rubens' workshop. Pontius also worked after the work of pupils or imitators of Rubens. He can be regarded as one of the principal engravers of van Dyck's work. Altogether Pontius produced 42 plates after Rubens. As several of these works were portraits of the rulers of the Spanish Netherlands such as the king and queen of Spain and the governors and ministers of the Spanish Netherlands, Pontius can be seen as the official portrait engraver. An example is the Portrait of Gaspar de Gusman, Count of Olivares, which Pontius made in 1626 after a design by Rubens. This was one of his first important portrait commissions and the success of the print led to many more official commissions.Joost vander Auwera, 'Rubens, l'atelier du g√©nie : autour des oeuvres du ma√Ætre aux Mus√©es royaux des beaux-arts de Belgique : exposition, Bruxelles, Mus√©es royaux des beaux-arts de Belgique, 14 septembre 2007 - 27 janvier 2008', Lannoo Uitgeverij, 2007, p. 92 In his portraits Pontius conveyed the figures and their expressions in an attractive and faultless manner. This quality of his work made him one of the most sought after engravers for the various publication projects of the prominent portrait painters active in Flanders at the time. He made many of the portrait engravings that were published in van Dyck's Iconography (Antwerp, c. 1632‚Äì44), Johannes Meyssens' Images de divers hommes, Cornelis de Bie's Het Gulden Cabinet (Antwerp, 1661) and Anselm van Hulle's Icones legatorum (Antwerp, 1648).

Arthropods (including crayfish and lobsters) and some mammals (including pinnipeds and manatees) can use sensory hairs to detect water movements. Systems that detect hydrodynamic stimuli are also used for sensing other stimuli.

Kaminski. ‚ÄúSensitivity of the mystacial vibrissae of harbour seals (Phoca vitulina) for size differences of actively touched objects.‚Äù Journal of Experimental Biology 198, no. 11 (1995): 2317-23. . Relative to other sensory systems, our knowledge of hydrodynamic sensing is rather limited.Bleckmann, Horst. \\"Reception of Hydrodynamic Stimuli in Aquatic and Semiaquatic Animals.\\" In Progress in Zoology, Vol. 41, edited by W. Rathmayer, 1-115. Stuttgart, Jena, New York: Gustav Fischer, 1994. This could be because humans do not have hydrodynamic receptors, which makes it difficult for us to understand the importance of such a system. Generating and measuring a complex hydrodynamic stimulus can also be difficult. Overview of hydrodynamic stimuli=Definition ‚ÄúHydrodynamic‚Äù refers to the motion of water against an object that causes a force to be exerted upon it.Merriam-Webster.com, s.v. ‚ÄúHydrodynamics,\\" http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary. A hydrodynamic stimulus is therefore a detectable disturbance caused by objects moving in a fluid. The geometry of the disturbance depends on properties of the object (shape, size, velocity) and also on properties of the fluid, such as viscosity and velocity.Wieskotten, S, B Mauck, L Miersch, G Dehnhardt, and W Hanke. ‚ÄúHydrodynamic discrimination of wakes caused by objects of different size or shape in a harbour seal (Phoca vitulina).‚Äù Journal of Experimental Biology 214, no. 11 (2011): 1922-30. . .Bradbury, Jack W., and Sandra L. Vehrencamp. Principles of Animal Communication, Second Edition. Sunderland: Sinauer, 2011. 249-257. These water movements are not only relevant to animals that can detect them, but constitute a branch of physics, fluid dynamics, that has importance in areas such as meteorology, engineering, and astronomy. A frequent hydrodynamic stimulus is a wake, consisting of eddies and vortices that an organism leaves behind as it swims, affected by the animal's size, swimming pattern, and speed.Videler, J J, U K Muller, and E J Stamhuis. ‚ÄúAquatic vertebrate locomotion: wakes from body waves.‚Äù Journal of Experimental Biology 202, no. 23 (1999): 3423-30. . Although the strength of a wake decreases over time as it moves away from its source, vortex structure of a goldfish's wake can remain for about thirty seconds, and increased water velocity can be detected several minutes after production.Hanke, W, C Brucker, and H Bleckmann. ‚ÄúThe ageing of the low-frequency water disturbances caused by swimming goldfish and its possible relevance to prey detection.‚Äù Journal of Experimental Biology 203, no. 7 (2000): 1193-200. . Uses of hydrodynamic stimuli Since movement of an object through water inevitably creates movement of the water itself, and this resulting water motion persists and travels, the detection of hydrodynamic stimuli is useful for sensing conspecifics, predators, and prey. Many studies are based upon the question of how an aquatic organism can capture prey despite darkness or apparent lack of visual or other sensory systems and find that the sensing of hydrodynamic stimuli left by prey is probably responsible.Catania, K C, J F Hare, K L Campbell. ‚ÄúWater shrews detect movement, shape, and smell to find prey underwater.‚Äù PNAS 105, no. 2 (2008): 571-76. .Dehnhardt, G, B Mauck, and H Bleckmann. ‚ÄúSeal whiskers detect water movements.‚Äù Nature 394, no. 6690 (1998): 235-6.Pettigrew, J D, P R Manger, and S L Fine. ‚ÄúThe sensory world of the platypus.‚Äù Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

As for detection of conspecifics, harbor seal pups will enter the water with their mother, but eventually ascend to obtain oxygen, and then dive again to rejoin the mother. Observations suggest that the tracking of water movements produced by the mother and other pups allows this rejoining to occur. Through these trips and the following of conspecifics, pups might learn routes to avoid predators and good places to find food, showing the possible significance of hydrodynamic detection to these seals. Hydrodynamic stimuli also function in exploration of the environment. For example, blind cave fish create disturbances in the water and use distortions of this self- generated field to complete spatial tasks, such as avoiding surrounding obstacles.Windsor, S P, D Tan, and J C Montgomery. ‚ÄúSwimming kinematics and hydrodynamic imaging in the blind Mexican cave fish (Astyanax fasciatus). Journal of Experimental Biology 211, no. 18 (2008), 2950-9. . . Visualizing hydrodynamic stimuli Since water movements are difficult for humans to observe, researchers can visualize the hydrodynamic stimuli that animals detect via particle image velocimetry (PIV). This technique tracks fluid motions by particles put into the water that can be more easily imaged compared to the water itself. The direction and speed of water movement can be defined quantitatively. This technique assumes that the particles will follow the flow of the water. Invertebrates To detect water movement, many invertebrates have sensory cells with cilia that project from the body surface and make direct contact with surrounding water.Budelmann, Bernd-Ulrich. \\"Hydrodynamic Receptor Systems in Invertebrates.\\" In The Mechanosensory Lateral Line. Neurobiology and Evolution, edited by S Coombs, P Gorner, H Munz, 607-632. New York: Springer, 1989. Typically, the cilia include one kinocilium surrounded by a group of shorter stereocilia. Deflection of stereocilia toward the kinocilium by movement of water around the animal stimulates some sensory cells and inhibits others. Water velocity is thus related to the amount of deflection of certain stereocilia, and sensory cells send information about this deflection to the brain via firing rates of afferent nerves. Cephalopods, including the squid Loligo vulgaris and cuttlefish Sepia officinalis, have ciliated sensory cells arranged in lines at different locations on the body.Budelmann, B U, and H Bleckmann. ‚ÄúA lateral line analogue in cephalopods: water waves generate microphonic potentials in the epidermal head lines of Sepia and Lolliguncula.‚Äù Journal of Comparative Physiology A 164 (1988): 1-5. Although these cephalopods have only kinocilia and no stereocilia, the sensory cells and their arrangement are analogous to the hair cells and lateral line in vertebrates, indicating convergent evolution. Arthropods are different from other invertebrates as they use surface receptors in the form of mechanosensory setae to function in both touch and hydrodynamic sensing. These receptors can also be deflected by solid objects or water flow. They are located on different body regions depending on the animal, such as on the tail for crayfish and lobsters.Douglass, J K, and L A Wilkens. ‚ÄúDirectional selectivities of near-field filiform hair mechanoreceptors on the crayfish tailfan (Crustacea: Decapoda).‚Äù Journal of Comparative Physiology A 183 (1998): 23-34. Neural excitation occurs when setae are moved in one direction, while inhibition occurs with movement in the opposite direction. Fish Lateral line on an Atlantic cod Fish and some aquatic amphibians detect hydrodynamic stimuli via a lateral line. This system consists of an array of sensors called neuromasts along the length of the fish's body. Neuromasts can be free-standing (superficial neuromasts) or within fluid-filled canals (canal neuromasts). The sensory cells within neuromasts are polarized hair cells contained within a gelatinous cupula. The cupula, and the stereocilia within, are moved by a certain amount depending on the movement of the surrounding water. Afferent nerve fibers are excited or inhibited depending on whether the hair cells they arise from are deflected in the preferred or opposite direction. Lateral line receptors form somatotopic maps within the brain informing the fish of amplitude and direction of flow at different points along the body. These maps are located in the medial octavolateral nucleus (MON) of the medulla and in higher areas such as the torus semicircularis.Plachta, D T T, W Hanke, and H Bleckmann. ‚ÄúA hydrodynamic topographic map in the midbrain of goldfish Carassius auratus.‚Äù Journal of Experimental Biology 206, no. 19 (2003): 3479-86. . Mammals Detection of hydrodynamic stimuli in mammals typically occurs through use of hairs (vibrissae) or ‚Äúpush-rod‚Äù mechanoreceptors, as in platypuses. When hairs are used, they are often in the form of whiskers and contain a follicle-sinus complex (F-SC), making them different from the hairs with which humans are most familiar.Dehnhardt, G, H Hyv√§rinen, A Palviainen, and G Klauer. ‚ÄúStructure and innervation of the vibrissal follicle-sinus complex in the Australian water rat, Hydromys chrysogaster.‚Äù The Journal of Comparative Neurology 411, no. 4 (1999): 550-62. .Marshall, C D, H Amin, K M Kovacs, and C Lydersen. ‚ÄúMicrostructure and innervation of the mystacial vibrissal follicle- sinus complex in bearded seals, Erignathus barbatus (Pinnipedia: Phocidae).

Pinnipeds Pinnipeds, including sea lions and seals, use their mystacial vibrissae (whiskers) for active touch, including size and shape discrimination, and texture discrimination in seals.Miersch, L, W Hanke, S Wieskotten, F D Hanke, J Oeffner, A Leder, M Brede, M Witte, and G Dehnhardt. ‚ÄúFlow sensing by pinniped whiskers.‚Äù Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B 366, no. 1581 (2011): 3077-84. . . When used for touch, these vibrissae are moved to the forward position and kept still while the head moves, thus moving the vibrissae on the surface of an object. This is in contrast to rodents, which move the whiskers themselves to explore objects. More recently, research has been done to see if pinnipeds can use these same whiskers to detect hydrodynamic stimuli in addition to tactile stimuli. While this ability has been verified behaviorally, the specific neural circuits involved have not yet been determined. =Seals= Research on the ability of pinnipeds to detect hydrodynamic stimuli was first done on harbor seals (Phoca vitulina). It had been unclear how seals could find food in dark waters. It was found that a harbor seal that could use only its whiskers for sensory information (due to being blindfolded and wearing headphones), could respond to weak hydrodynamic stimuli produced by an oscillating sphere within the range of frequencies that fish would generate. As with active touch, whiskers are not moved during sensing, but are projected forward and remain in that position. To find whether seals could actually follow hydrodynamic stimuli using their vibrissae rather than just detect them, a blindfolded harbor seal with headphones can be released into a tank in which a toy submarine has left a hydrodynamic trail. After protracting its vibrissae to the most forward position and making lateral head movements, the seal can locate and follow a trail of 40 meters even when sharp turns to the trail are added. When whisker movements are prevented with a mask covering the muzzle, the seal cannot locate and follow the trail, indicating use of information obtained by the whiskers. Trails produced by live animals are more complex than that produced by a toy submarine, so the ability of seals to follow trails produced by other seals can also be tested. A seal is capable of following this center of this trail, either following the direct path of the trail or using an undulatory pattern involving crossing the trail repeatedly. This latter pattern might allow the seal to track a fish swimming in a zigzagging motion, or assist with tracking weak trails by comparing the surrounding water with the prospective trail.Gl√§ser, N, S Wieskotten, C Otter, G Dehnhardt, and W Hanke. ‚ÄúHydrodynamic trail following in a California sea lion (Zalophus californianus).‚Äù Journal of Comparative Physiology A 197, no. 2 (2011): 141-51. . . Other studies have shown that the harbor seal can distinguish between the hydrodynamic trails left by paddles of different sizes and shapes, a finding in agreement with what the lateral line in goldfish is capable of doing. Discrimination between different fish species might have adaptive value if it allows seals to capture those with highest energy content. Seals can also detect a hydrodynamic trail produced by a fin-like paddle up to 35 seconds old with an accuracy rate greater than chance.Wieskotten, S, G Dehnhardt, B Mauck, L Miersch, and W Hanke. ‚ÄúHydrodynamic determination of the moving direction of an artificial fin by a harbour seal (Phoca vitulina).‚Äù The Journal of Experimental Biology 213, no. 13 (2010): 2194-200. . . Accuracy diminishes as the trail becomes older. =Sea Lions= More recently, studies on hydrodynamic detection in the California sea lion (Zalophus californianus) have been done. Despite the structure of their mystacial vibrissae, different from those of seals, these sea lions can detect and follow a trail made by a small toy submarine. Sea lions use an undulatory pattern of tracking similar to that in seals, but do not perform as well with increased delay before they are allowed to swim and locate the trail. =Species differences in vibrissae= Studies raise the question of how detection of hydrodynamic stimuli in these animals is possible given the movement of the vibrissae due to water flow during swimming. Whiskers vibrate with a certain frequency based on swim speed and properties of the whisker. Detection of the water disturbance caused by this vibrissal movement should overshadow any stimulus produced by a distant fish due to its proximity. For seals, one proposal is that they might sense changes in the baseline frequency of vibration to detect hydrodynamic stimuli produced by another source. However, a more recent study shows that the morphology of the seal's vibrissae actually prevents vortices produced by the whiskers from creating excessive water disturbances.Hanke, W, M Witte, L Miersch, M Brede, J Oeffner, M Michael, F Hanke, A Leder, and G Dehnhardt. ‚ÄúHarbor seal vibrissa morphology suppresses vortex-induced vibrations.‚Äù Journal of Experimental Biology 213, no. 15 (2010): 2665-72. . . In harbor seals, the structure of the vibrissal shaft is undulated (wavy) and flattened. This specialization is also found in most true seals. In contrast, the whiskers of the California sea lion are circular or elliptical in cross-section and are smooth. When seals swim with their vibrissae projected forward, the flattened, undulated structure prevents the vibrissae from bending backward or vibrating to produce water disturbances. Thus, the seal prevents noise from the whiskers by a unique whisker structure. However, sea lions appear to monitor modulations of the characteristic frequency of the whiskers to obtain information about hydrodynamic stimuli. This different mechanism might be responsible for the sea lion's worse performance in tracking an aging hydrodynamic trail. Since the whiskers of the sea lion must recover its characteristic frequency after the frequency is altered by a hydrodynamic stimulus, this could reduce the whisker's temporal resolution. Manatees Similar to the vibrissae of seals and sea lions, Florida manatees also use hairs for detecting tactile and hydrodynamic stimuli. However, manatees are unique since these tactile hairs are located over the whole post-cranial body in addition to the face. These hairs have different densities at different locations of the body, with higher density on the dorsal side and density decreasing ventrally. The effect of this distribution in spatial resolution is unknown. This system, distributed over the whole body, could localize water movements analogous to a lateral line. Research is currently being done to test detection of hydrodynamic stimuli in manatees. While the anatomy of the follicle-sinus complexes of manatees have been well studied, there is much to learn about the neural circuits involved if such detection is possible and the way in which the hairs encode information about strength and location of a stimulus via timing differences in firing. Platypuses In contrast to the sinus hairs that other mammals use to detect water movements, evidence indicates that platypuses use specialized mechanoreceptors on the bill called ‚Äúpush-rods‚Äù. These look like small domes on the surface, which are the ends of rods that are attached at the base but can move freely otherwise. Using these push-rods in combination with electroreceptors, also on the bill, allows the platypus to find prey with its eyes closed. While researchers initially believed that the push-rods could only function when something is in contact with the bill (implicating their use for a tactile sense), it is now believed that they can also be used at a distance to detect hydrodynamic stimuli. The information from push-rods and electroreceptors combine in the somatosensory cortex in a structure with stripes similar to the ocular dominance columns for vision. In the third layer of this structure, sensory inputs from push-rods and electroreceptors may combine so that the platypus can use the time difference between arrival of each type of signal at the bill (with hydrodynamic stimuli arriving after electrical signals) to determine the location of prey. That is, different cortical neurons could encode the delay between detection of electrical and hydrodynamic stimuli. However, a specific neural mechanism for this is not yet known. Other mammals The family Talpidae includes the moles, shrew moles, and desmans. Most members of this family have Eimer's organs, touch-sensitive structures on the snout. The desmans are semi-aquatic and have small sensory hairs that have been compared to the neuromasts of the lateral line. These hairs are termed ‚Äúmicrovibrissae‚Äù due to their small size, ranging from 100 to 200 micrometers. They are located with the Eimer's organs on the snout and might sense water movements.Catania, K C. ‚ÄúEpidermal Sensory Organs of Moles, Shrew Moles, and Desmans: A Study of the Family Talpidae with Comments on the Function and Evolution of Eimer‚Äôs Organ.‚Äù Brain, Behavior and Evolution 56, no. 3 (2000): 146-174. . Soricidae, a sister family of Talpidae, contains the American water shrew. This animal can obtain prey during the night despite the darkness. To discover how this is possible, a study controlling for use of electroreception, sonar, or echolocation showed that this water shrew is capable of detecting water disturbances made by potential prey. This species probably uses its vibrissae for hydrodynamic (and tactile) sensing based on behavioral observations and their large cortical representation. While not well studied, the Rakali (Australian water rat) may also be able to detect water movements with its vibrissae as these have a large amount of innervation, though further behavioral studies are needed to confirm this. While tying the presence of whiskers to hydrodynamic reception has allowed the list of mammals with this special sense to grow, more research still needs to be done on the specific neural circuits involved.

He was the son of Whitfield S. Johnson, who served as New Jersey Secretary of State from 1861 to 1866. Early life and education Johnson was born in Newton, New Jersey to Whitfield Schaeffer and Ellen (Green) Johnson. He attended the New Jersey State Model School at Trenton, and received a BA from Princeton College in 1867. He continued at Princeton, receiving a Master of Arts, and went on to read law with Edward W. Scudder. He was admitted to the bar in June 1870, and practiced law in Trenton until moving to Hackensack, New Jersey in 1874. On October 22, 1872, he married Maria E. White of Trenton, and the couple had three children. Political career In 1895, Johnson was the first Republican elected to the New Jersey State Senate from Bergen County. He was re-elected in 1888, and served as President of the Senate in 1900. During this term, Johnson was Acting Governor from May 21 to June 19 while Governor Voorhees was out of the country. Johnson left the State Senate when he was appointed as First Assistant Postmaster by President William McKinley in August 1900. Johnson was a delegate to the Republican National Conventions in 1888 and 1904. Philanthropy Johnson was a financial supporter of Princeton, his alma mater. He donated the land and paid for the construction of a building for a public library in Hackensack. He also donated $5,000.00 for the purchase of books. Johnson additionally provided the salaries of the library staff for the first two years of its operation. In 1915, Johnson donated an additional $30,000 for an expansion of the library. The Johnson Public Library is located at 274 Main Street and is a member of the Bergen County Cooperative Library System. Death Johnson died as a result of bronchitis at his home in Hackensack on September 11, 1928.

Most studies have focused on use of organic fertilizer. Conventional hydroponics have a difficult time using organic compounds as fertilizer. In this method of organic hydroponics, organic fertilizer is degraded into inorganic nutrients by microorganisms in the hydroponic solution via ammonification and nitrification. The microorganisms are cultured with a method of multiple parallel mineralization. The culture solution can be used as the hydroponic solution. Practical method of organic hydroponics is developed in National Agriculture and Food Research Organization (NARO), in Japan, in 2005. History of organic hydroponics Studies for establishing organic hydroponics have been conducted for a long time. Kennedy Space Center had studied organic hydroponics for crop production in space.C.L. Mackowiaka, b, J.L. Garlanda, b, R.F. Strayera, b, B.W. Fingera, b, R.M. Wheeler(1996) Comparison of aerobically-treated and untreated crop residue as a source of recycled nutrients in a recirculating hydroponic system. Adv. Space Res. 18, 281-287 It was necessary to develop the method to generate nitrate from organic fertilizer via ammonification and nitrification, because most of crops are nitrate-phylic but not ammonium-philic. It is easy to generate ammonium from organic fertilizer by saprophytic microorganisms. However it was difficult to degrade organic fertilizer to nitrate efficiently because the growth of nitrifying bacteria, such as the obligate chemolithoautotrophs Nitrosomonas spp. and Nitrospira spp., is particularly inhibited by the presence of organic compounds (Jensen 1950; Quastel and Scholefield 1951; Rittenberg 1969; Smith and Hoare 1977; Krummel and Harms 1982; Takahashi et al. 1992; Stutte 1996; Xu et al. 2000; Tomiyama et al. 2001). Shinohara invented the method to efficiently generate nitrate form in water. The method, multiple parallel mineralization, consists of three manipulations: small inoculation of soil microorganisms, addition of small amounts of organic fertilizer, and aeration. The mineralized solution can be used as the hydroponic solution and organic fertilizer can be added in the solution during cultivation. This is the first practical organic hydroponics technique that organic fertilizer can be added directly during cultivation. Farajollahzade et al.,M Shinohara, C Aoyama, K Fujiwara, A Watanabe, H Ohmori, Y Uehara & Masao Takano (2011) Microbial mineralization of organic nitrogen into nitrate to allow the use of organic fertilizer in hydroponics. Soil Sci. Plant Nutr. 57, 190-203 introduced a method in which soil remained as the source of nutrients and the nitrogen was supplied by a in-line tank containing nitrogen-fixing bacteria. This method could be considered as a variation of soil culture in which the plant and soil are connected by cycling liquid. By use of organic soil as the source of nutrients, they believe that it could be considered within the definition of organic agriculture.

It is named after the prominent italian lawyer and jurist Luigi Majno (1852-1915). According to a study made by Corriere della Sera, Viale Luigi Majno is one of the most expensive residential areas of Milan, reaching up to ‚Ç¨20,000 per square meter in some buildings.  Location and Extension  Viale Luigi Majno is located in the eastern part of Milan's Cerchia dei bastioni (the area of the city which was surrounded by the Spanish walls built in 1549 by Ferrante I Gonzaga and demolished between the 19th and 20th century). This street extends from Viale Bianca Maria (in the south) to Viale Citt√† di Fiume (in the north); it is separated from the first by Piazza del Tricolore (which is traversed by Corso Monforte as well) and from the second by Piazza Guglielmo Oberdan (or just Porta Venezia). Viale Luigi Majno connects two of the busiest streets in the city: Corso Buenos Aires (and its prosecution Corso Venezia) and Corso Monforte. Although Viale Majno is only about 550 meters long, it is connected to West by (from North) Via Borghetto, Via Giuseppe Baretti, Via Gioacchino Rossini, Via Giuseppe e Francesco Carlo Maggiolini and it is connected to East (to the parallel street Viale Piave) by (from North) Via Giovanni Morelli, Via Lamberto De Bernardi and Via Ippolito Pindemonte.  Other Features  Viale Majno is approximately 30 meters wide. The pavements are equally sized on both the sides and are from 1.5 to 2 meters wide. The roadway is structured as follows (from East): parking lots (in line and for residents only), double- track one-way North-directed roadway, two parallel lines of trees with a concrete pathway in the middle, double-track one-way South-directed roadway, parking lots (in line and for residents only). Since Viale Majno separates two parking areas (Area 4 on West and Area 14 on East) - one of which is located in Zona di decentramento 4 although it is located the Zona di decentramento 1 (Centro Storico) - it is considered for traffic-regulation purposes an arterial-road; the speed limit is set to 50 km/h.  Ecopass Area and Area C  Viale Luigi Majno used to constitute one of the borders of the Ecopass area of Milan. Since January 16, 2012 - when the Ecopass area was converted into the Area C - Viale Luigi Majno represents the border of the new congestion area. Since the newly established Area C is delimited by the same borders of the Ecopass area, the buildings on the western side of Viale Luigi Majno (with odd numbers) are considered to be in the Area C (even if the main entrances are located outside the Area C), while the buildings on the eastern side (with even numbers) are considered to be outside the area.  Buildings and Daily Sun Exposure  Since Viale Luigi Majno is located in a densely populated residential area, its buildings are between 25 and 35 meters high, and have 4 (in the most ancient) to 10 storeys. Because of the urban development plan of 2004, Viale Luigi Majno and the surrounding areas can't be subject to invasive demolitions or edifications; new buildings erected since 2004 have had to comply with some very strict and precise building and aesthetic regulations. Viale Majno, as other areas in the city of Milan, is rich of modern buildings (built after the allied bombing during the Second World War) and some ancient ones (some of which were edified in the 15th century). Being North-South oriented, the ground level of Viale Majno is fully exposed to sunlight only during the central hours of the day: in summer from 10 a.m. to 5.30 p.m. and in winter from 11 a.m. to 3.30 p.m. During the rest of the day, the pavements and the roadways are in the shade of the surrounding buildings and of the trees in the middle of the way. Still, the intense car-flow keeps Viale Majno one of the warmest areas in winter and of the hottest in summer.

BeKm-1 acts by selectively inhibiting the human Ether-√†-go-go Related Gene (hERG) channels, which are voltage gated potassium ion channels.  Etymology  Be is the abbreviation of the scorpion from which the venom is isolated, Buthus eupeus. is an abbreviation of M-type K+ current, which is inhibited by the venom.Angelo, K., et al., A radiolabeled peptide ligand of the hERG channel, [125I]-BeKm-1. Pfl√ºgers Arch, 2003. 447(1): p. 55-63.  Chemistry  BeKm-1 is a 4 kDa peptide consisting of 36 amino acids with six positively charged residues and six cysteines, which forms three disulfide bridges.Korolkova, Y.V., et al., An ERG channel inhibitor from the scorpion Buthus eupeus. J Biol Chem, 2001. 276(13): p. 9868-76. The primary amino acid sequence of BeKm-1 is: H-Arg-Pro-Thr-Asp-Ile-Lys-Cys-Ser-Glu-Ser-Tyr-Gln-Cys-Phe-Pro-Val-Cys-Lys-Ser- Arg-Phe-Gly-Lys-Thr-Asn-Gly-Arg-Cys-Val-Asn-Gly-Phe-Cys-Asp-Cys-Phe-OH. Its tertiary structure consists of an alpha-helix and three beta-strands, arranged in a strongly twisted antiparallel beta sheet, compactly fold up. The helix is confined by two ‚Äòcaps‚Äô that have also been described in other short scorpion toxins.Korolkova, Y.V., et al., New binding site on common molecular scaffold provides HERG channel specificity of scorpion toxin BeKm-1. J Biol Chem, 2002. 277(45): p. 43104-9. BeKm-1 shows structural homology to the family of scorpion venom potassium channel blockers, the Œ±-KTx family. Despite the similarities between BeKm-1 and these scorpion toxins, BeKm-1 belongs to a new subfamily of scorpion K1 channel blocking peptides. The differences between the subfamilies are in the COOH-terminal part: the newly described family of toxins, BeKm-1 included, contains Arg 17, Val 29 and Phe32, while the older one Lys, Met and Lys.  Mode of action  BekM-1 selectively inhibits hERG potassium channels that are coded by the human ether-a-go-go-related gene.Zhang, M., et al., BeKm-1 is a hERG-specific toxin that shares the structure with ChTx but the mechanism of action with ErgTx1. Biophys J, 2003. 84(5): p. 3022-36. By toxin mutagenesis study it is found that the positive residues are important for the binding of BeKm-1 to the HERG channel. The important residues located in the alpha helix (Lys-23, Arg-20, Lys-18 and Tyr 11) form a positive electrostatic surface of the molecule that interact with the negatively charged outer vestibule of the hERG channel to suppress its currents. The HERG channel is bound both in its resting and activated state by BeKm-1; BeKm-1 unbinds in the inactivated state. By binding above the pore entrance, BeKm-1 does not totally block the K+ flux through the pore. The toxic blocks the channel with an IC50 of 3.3 nM. The hERG channels are prominently expressed in myocytes; inhibition of these channels by BekM-1 prolongs the QT interval in the ECG.Qu, Y. et al., BeKm-1, a peptide inhibitor of hERG potassium currents, prolongs the QTc intervals in isolated rabbit heart. J Pharmacol Exp Ther, 2011. 337(1): p. 2-8.  Toxicity  The LD50 of subcutaneous injection of the venom of Buthus eupeus in mice is 1.45 mg/kg.  Treatment  Anti-venom of Androctonus crassicaude can be used in the treatment of envenomation by Buthus eupeus scorpion stings.Ozkan, O. and A.

The site includes maps, predictions and analysis articles. It has separate sections for elections in Scotland and Northern Ireland. From April 2019, the headline prediction covered the Brexit Party and Change UK - The Independent Group. Change UK was later removed from the headline prediction ahead of the 2019 general election as their poll scores were not statistically significant.  Methodology  The site is based around the employment of scientific techniques on data about Britain's electoral geography, which can be used to calculate the uniform national swing. It takes account of national polls and trends but excludes local issues. The calculations were initially based on what is termed the Transition Model, which is derived from the additive uniform national swing model. This uses national swings in a proportional manner to predict local effects. The Strong Transition Model was introduced in October 2007, and considers the effects of strong and weak supporters.

It is an evergreen climbing plant, growing slowly to 20‚Äì30 m high where suitable surfaces are available, and also growing as ground cover where there are no vertical surfaces. It climbs by means of aerial rootlets which cling to the substrate. It is more common at higher altitudes in rocky, shadowy riverine forest, over 400‚Äì650 m. In its natural habitat it can be distinguished easily from Hedera helix subsp. poetarum, also present, because the latter has yellow fruits, while Hedera cypria is always black-fruited. Hedera cypria does not resemble any other ivy into such a unique white patterns conspicuous grey veining, red stemmed. It is an attractive robust plant, growing slowly. It has alternate and small to medium ovate leaves, with a long petiole; there are two types of leaves, palmately five-lobed juvenile leaves on creeping and climbing stems, and unlobed lauroid adult leaves on fertile flowering stems. In this species, the juvenile leaves are almost unlobed with an isosceles triangle shape, and the green leave is blotched with a grid of leaf-nerves greenish-yellow to grey. Hedera cypria is closely related to Hedera pastuchovii. Hedera cypria is found on the island of Cyprus and H. pastuchowii is distributed in close proximity in Iran, Caucasus and Transcaucassus. The DNA analysis confirmed that they are not strongly separated but they must to be separated into distinct species, due largely to genetic differences that occur between other traits in the presence of distinct white markings over the veins in its young leaves as compared to less distinct white markings in young H. pastuchowii leaves, coupled with greater vigour in H. cypria plants.

It initially aired on AMC in the United States on October 23, 2011. The episode was written by Glen Mazzara and directed by Ernest Dickerson. In this episode, Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) and Shane Walsh (Jon Bernthal) rush to save the life of Rick's son, Carl (Chandler Riggs), and discover a possible safe haven in the process. Production commenced in Newnan, Georgia at Newnan High School in early July 2011, after attaining approval from the city council and the Coweta County School System. The episode featured guest appearances from Scott Wilson, Lauren Cohan, Emily Kinney and Pruitt Taylor Vince, amongst several other recurring actors and actresses for the series. \\"Bloodletting\\" was well received by television critics, who praised the character development in the episode. Upon airing, it gained 6.70 million viewers and garnered a 3.6 rating in the 18-49 demographic, according to Nielsen ratings. Plot In a flashback, Lori Grimes (Sarah Wayne Callies) is talking with other mothers about a fight she had with her husband, Rick (Andrew Lincoln). Rick's partner, Shane Walsh (Jon Bernthal), pulls up in a police cruiser and tells Lori that Rick has been severely wounded in a highway shootout. Lori then tells her and Rick's son, Carl (Chandler Riggs) the news, causing him to break down in tears. In the present, Carl has been accidentally shot by a man named Otis (Pruitt Taylor Vince), who was hunting for deer. Otis brings Rick, Carl and Shane to a veterinarian named Hershel Greene (Scott Wilson), for whom Otis works as a farm hand. Hershel lives with his daughters Maggie (Lauren Cohan) and Beth (Emily Kinney), Beth's boyfriend Jimmy (James Allen McCune), and Otis' wife Patricia (Jane McNeill). He treats Carl, but he reveals that the bullet was broken into six fragments. Rick must donate blood to Carl in order to keep him alive. Lori, Glenn (Steven Yeun), Carol (Melissa McBride), Daryl (Norman Reedus), and Andrea (Laurie Holden) are still searching for Carol's daughter, Sophia (Madison Lintz), when they overhear a gunshot. Meanwhile, on the highway, Dale (Jeffrey DeMunn) believes that T-Dog (IronE Singleton) has contracted a blood infection from the wound he received in the previous episode, prompting their fruitless search for antibiotics. At the Greene farm, Hershel reveals that Carl needs major surgery to live, and that he will need a respirator. Otis suggests that they might find supplies at a nearby high school‚Äîwhere the Federal Emergency Management Agency has set up a trailer‚Äîalthough the place is likely overrun with walkers. Otis and Shane decide to get the supplies, while Maggie retrieves Lori from the group and brings her to the Greene home. Rick and Hershel discuss the walker epidemic; Rick believes there is no cure, while Hershel has faith that there could be one. The group searching for Sophia returns to the highway, where Daryl reveals that he has a bag containing painkillers and doxycycline antibiotics that T-Dog can take. Shane and Otis retrieve the supplies, but are spotted by walkers. The two have no choice but to barricade themselves in the high school. Production \\"Bloodletting\\" was written by Glen Mazzara and directed by Ernest Dickerson. In June 2011, it was announced that Scott Wilson, Lauren Cohan, and Pruitt Taylor Vince would appear on the second season as recurring characters. In an interview with TV Guide, Gale Anne Hurd explained that Wilson's character, Hershel Greene, served as a patriarchal figure for the group. She continued: \\"He's a veterinarian with a great sense of humanity and a very unique take on the [walkers].\\" According to Hurd, Scott Wilson was cast because of his \\"tremendous scope and gravitas\\". Hurd also stated that Cohan's character, Greene's daughter Maggie, was a woman in her twenties who eventually becomes a romantic interest for Glenn (Steven Yeun). Further, Cohan added in an interview with the Philadelphia Daily News that Maggie was a Christian from a sheltered background. In preparation for her role, she spent a few months in Los Angeles, California to work with a dialect coach. Emily Kinney also joined the cast as Hershel's younger daughter and Maggie's half- sister, Beth. Principal photography commenced in Newnan, Georgia at Newnan High School in July 2011, after approval was received from the city council and the Coweta County School System. Site preparation initiated on July 1, and filming began at the gymnasium of the school over a period of four days from July 7‚Äì8 and again from July 11‚Äì12. The location was temporarily renovated to mirror an abandoned Federal Emergency Management Agency camp. Michael Riley, the production manager for the episode, contacted the Newnan Police Department to collaborate with producers. Because of the large size of the filming location, Riley's production company notified surrounding neighborhoods, to avoid inconvenience. \\"Bloodletting\\" begins with a flashback of Rick Grimes' relationship with Lori, before she became romantically linked to Shane. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Robert Kirkman asserted that it \\"speaks to Shane and his relationship to Lori and Rick in the early days.\\" He continued: > \\"A lot of people think of Shane as a clear villain and that he did a bad > thing. But if you really analyze that situation, he‚Äôs a good guy and has > done the right thing at every turn. Because he's done that, and it‚Äôs not > working out for him, it‚Äôs driving him crazy. So we really wanted to show > that he‚Äôs a tragic figure much more than a villainous figure. It‚Äôs just a > series of unfortunate situations that have led to him slowly losing himself > in this world. Popping back in time and showing his concern for Rick and how > he cares for Lori and Carl, I thought that would be a good thing to do.\\" During a scene on the road, Daryl reveals a plastic bag of Merle's drug stash he originally kept in hiding from the crew, only bringing it out to aid T-Dog's rising fever. In the bag are doxycyclin (because, Daryl explains, Merle occasionally catches the clap), painkillers, ecstasy, and methamphetamine. The meth is blue, leading to speculations that it was a reference to the famous blue meth prepared by Walter White in the television series, Breaking Bad. In his interview in the after-show Talking Dead, Kirkman stated that the scene was \\"a little Easter egg we were doing for AMC fans.\\" Reception=Ratings \\"Bloodletting\\" was first broadcast on October 23, 2011 in the United States on AMC. The episode received 6.70 million viewers and attained a 3.6 rating in the 18-49 demographic, according to Nielsen ratings. An encore presentation gained an additional 2.077 million viewers and garnered a 1.0 rating in the 18-49 demographic. Along with becoming the highest-rated program on basic cable for the night, \\"Bloodletting\\" became the second highest-rated program of the week on basic cable, scoring higher than the season finale of Jersey Shore, but garnering less than a game between the Miami Dolphins and the New York Jets as part of the 2011 NFL season. Total viewership and ratings for the episode were moderately down from the previous episode, \\"What Lies Ahead\\", which was watched by 7.26 million viewers and attained a 3.8 rating in the 18-49 demographic, according to the Nielsen ratings. Critical response The episode was well received by television critics. Ology writer Josh Harrison gave the episode a nine out of ten rating, and opined that the episode was a \\"home run episode\\" for the series. Harrison continued: \\"Its central conflict is intense, its action is solid, and its new arrivals are engaging characters in their own right. Light on the gore and heavy on the drama‚Äîjust how I like my Sunday night zombie adventures.\\" Scott Meslow from The Atlantic gave the episode a positive review, deeming it as an improvement from the previous episode, and appreciated that the episode had opened up new plot points for future episodes to come. Meslow wrote, \\"At the bare minimum, The Walking Dead should be exciting, and the final moments of \\"Bloodletting\\" provides more than enough action.\\" Echoing similar sentiments, Catherine Gee of The Daily Telegraph gave the episode a 3.5 out of 5 stars, and compared it to the second season premiere, opining: \\"It may have been a calmer episode but there was no shortage of story to chew on.\\" Joe Oesterle of Mania.com commended the opening sequence of the episode, and praised the performances of Lincoln and Bernthal. Oesterle wrote, \\"Andrew Lincoln and Jon Bernthal [...] gave a fine bit of acting, and I found it interesting how the character Rick started looking and walking a little bit zombish after giving blood. The scenes between the two men were moving, and if you listened close you could decipher the main differences between these two cowboy cops. Rick is bound and determined to get back to his wife and let her know their son is in mortal danger, without ever doubting his own ability to successfully complete the mission, while Shane on the other hand is not quite as automatically selfless and heroic.\\" In conclusion, Oesterle gave \\"Bloodletting\\" a 'B' grade. Eric Goldman of IGN gave the episode an 8.5 out of ten, signaling a \\"great\\" response. Goldman stated that it was an improvement over the last episode, and that it had a great scare moment and cliffhanger. Similarly, Paste Josh Jackson gave the episode an 8.3 out of ten rating, signifying a \\"commendable\\" rating. Steve West of Cinema Blend expressed that \\"Bloodletting\\" was superior to the previous episode, opining that it was \\"a character strengthening episode.\\" He continued: \\"Even those throwaway threads are immensely important to what‚Äôs about to go down at the Green farm.\\" Some television critics were less enthusiastic about the episode. Zack Handlen from The A.V. Club felt that the episode was inferior to the previous episode, deeming it tedious. He wrote, \\"'Bloodletting' was a step down from last week's premi√®re, mostly because it focused more on conversations than scares. Much as I want this show to find some way to do its characters right, those conversations were bland, providing no new information beyond, hey, it would suck to have your son get shot in front of you, huh?\\" Concluding his review, Handlen gave the episode a 'B‚Äì' grade. In concurrence, Nate Rawlings of Time stated: \\"For an episode titled 'Bloodletting' there was surprisingly little of it last night. What we got instead were outpourings of emotion and frustration. Two entries in, and it's already clear that the show wants to strike a balance between gore and humanity.\\" Andrew Conrad of the Chicago Tribune was unhappy with the episode; he expressed disappointment with the low number of zombie sequences, writing, \\"It must be a bit of a relief for the show's make-up department, but I'd like to see at least one walker every ten minutes or so.\\" ReferencesExternal links *\\"Bloodletting\\" at AMC * * Category:2011 American television episodes Category:The Walking Dead (season 2) episodes ","title":"Bloodletting (The Walking Dead)"},{"id":"33439402","text":"Kirk Field is a city-owned public-use airport located one nautical mile (2 km) northwest of the central business district of Paragould, in Greene County, Arkansas, United States.

On 10 June 1940, Italy declared war on France while the latter was already on the verge of defeat in its war with Germany. After the fall of Paris on 14 June, the French requested an armistice from Germany and, realising that the Germans would not allow them to continue the war against their Italian allies, also sent an armistice request to Italy, whose forces had not yet advanced. Fearing that the war would end before Italy had achieved any of its aims, Prime Minister Benito Mussolini ordered a full-scale invasion across the Alps to begin on 21 June. The Franco-German armistice was signed on the evening of the 22 June, but would not come into force until the Italians signed their own armistice. Their troops unable to break through, the Italians abandoned their major war aims and signed the armistice on 24 June. It came into effect early the next morning. It established a small occupation zone and an Italian Armistice Commission with France (Commissione Italiana d'Armistizio con la Francia, CIAF) in Turin to oversee French compliance. Armistice commissions were also established for French North Africa and French Somaliland. The armistice remained in force until November 1942, when during Case Anton the Italians occupied most of southeastern France and Corsica and invaded Tunisia. French request On 17 June, the day after he transmitted a formal request for an armistice to the German government, French Foreign Minister Paul Baudoin handed to the Papal nuncio Valerio Valeri a note that said: \\"The French government, headed by Marshal P√©tain, requests that the Holy See transmit to the Italian government as quickly as possible the note it has also transmitted through the Spanish ambassador to the German government. It also requests that he convey to the Italian government its desire to find together the basis of a lasting peace between the two countries.\\" That same morning, Mussolini received word from Hitler that France had asked Germany for an armistice, and he went to meet Hitler at Munich, charging General Roatta, Admiral Raffaele de Courten and Air Brigadier Egisto Perino with drafting Italy's demands. Ciano wrote in his diary about the ridiculous demand some of his staff suggested: the entire French fleet, all its colonies, all its locomotives, the Mona Lisa. The final list of demands actually presented to the French were mild. Italy dropped its claims to the Rh√¥ne Valley, Corsica, Tunisia, and French Somaliland. According to Romain Rainero, Mussolini still clung to the goals laid out in his meeting with Hitler on 18 June as late as 21 June, when the \\"Protocols of the Armistice Conditions between France and Italy\\" were officially published in Rome. It was his view that it was not German pressure that led him to back down. Indeed, Hitler had wanted the Italians to claim even more territory from the defeated French. Badoglio, however, had warned Mussolini that a larger occupation of southern France would require fifteen divisions. Negotiations On the evening of 21 June, Ambassador Dino Alfieri in Berlin transmitted the German armistice terms to Rome. According to Ciano, \\"under these [mild] conditions, Mussolini is not prepared to make territorial demands ... and [will] wait for the peace conference to make all our formal demands.\\" He added that Mussolini wished to delay the meeting with the French in the hopes that General Gambara would take Nice. The French had tried to play the allies off against each other; they \\"flattered the Germans [and] belittled the Italian war effort\\". Unlike the Franco-German armistice talks, the Franco-Italian negotiations would be genuine. At 1500 hours on 23 June, the French delegation, headed by General Charles Huntziger, who had signed the German armistice the previous day, landed in Rome aboard three German aircraft. The French negotiators were the same who had met with the Germans: Huntziger, General Maurice Parisot, a peacetime friend of Badoglio's, General Jean Bergeret, Admiral Maurice Le Luc, Charles Rochat of the Foreign Ministry and L√©on N√∂el, former ambassador to Poland. Italy was represented by Badoglio, Cavagnari, Ciano, Roatta and Francesco Pricolo. The first meeting of the two delegations took place at 1930 hours at the Villa Incisa all'Olgiata on the Via Cassia. It lasted only twenty-five minutes, during which Roatta read out Italy's proposed terms, Huntziger requested a recess to confer with his government and Ciano adjourned the meeting until the next day. During the adjournment, Hitler informed Mussolini that he thought the Italian demands too light, and he proposed linking up the German and Italian occupation zones. Roatta convinced Mussolini that it was too late to change the demands. At 1915 hours on 24 June, at the Villa Incisa, after receiving his government's permission, General Huntziger signed the armistice on behalf of the French and Marshal Badoglio for the Italians signed the armistice. Both armistices came into effect at thirty-five minutes past midnight (0035 hours) on 25 June. Just minutes before the signing, Huntziger had asked Badoglio to strike the clause calling for the repatriation to Italy of political refugees (like the socialist Pietro Nenni). Badoglio consulted Mussolini, he agreed. After signing, Huntziger said to Badoglio, \\"Marshal, in the present, infinitely painful circumstances, the French delegation is comforted by the sincere hope that the peace which will follow shortly will allow France to begin the task of reconstruction and renewal and will create the basis for lasting relations between our two countries in the interest of Europe and of civilization.\\" Badoglio responded, \\"I hope France will have a resurgence; it is a great nation with a great history, and I am certain that it will have a great future. From one soldier to another, I sincerely hope so.\\" Mussolini remarked that the agreement was \\"more a political than a military armistice after only fifteen days of war‚Äîbut it gives us a good document in hand\\". Terms Map of Vichy France after the armistices The armistice established a modest demilitarized zone deep on the French side of the border, thus eliminating the Alpine Line. The actual Italian occupation zone was no more than what had been occupied up to the armistice. It contained 832 km¬≤ and 28,500 inhabitants, which included the city of Menton and its 21,700 inhabitants.Rochat 2008, ¬∂27. Italy retained the right to interfere in French territory as far as the Rh√¥ne, but it did not occupy this area until after the Allied invasion of French North Africa in November 1942.Rochat 2008, ¬∂29. In addition, demilitarized zones were established in the French colonies in Africa. Italy was granted the right to use the port of Djibouti in French Somaliland with all its equipment, along with the French section of the Djibouti‚ÄìAddis Ababa railway. More importantly, the naval bases of Toulon, Bizerte, Ajaccio and Oran were also to be demilitarized.

Sources  Heteroscodratoxin-1 can be obtained from venom glands of Heteroscodra maculata (Togo starburst tarantula or Togo starburst baboon spider).  Chemistry  Heteroscodratoxin-1 is a basic protein (isoelectric point of 7.7) composed of 35 amino acids with a carboxylated C-terminus. Its sequence shows strong similarity with other taruntala toxins such as scodratoxin, hanatoxin and SGTx1. Structurally the protein belongs to the huwentoxin-1 family of inhibitory spider peptides based on its knottin backbone that consists of three crossing disulfide bridges (Cys1-Cys4/Cys2-Cys5/Cys3-Cys6). Hm1a has the following amino acid sequence: ECRYLFGGCSSTSDCCKHLSCRSDWKYCAWDGTFS. Its molecular weight is 3,995.61 Da.  Target  Heteroscodratoxin-1 inhibits subtypes of both delayed rectifier (KV2.1 and KV2.2) and A-type rapidly inactivating (KV4.1, KV4.2 and KV4.3) voltage-gated potassium channels. At a concentration of 100-300 nM, in transfected COS cells it blocks 23% of KV2.1, 19% of KV2.2, 50% of KV4.1, 39% of KV4.2, and 43% of KV4.3 conductance at a potential of 0 mV. No significant effect on other A-type rapidly inactivating (KV1.4 and KV3.4) or delayed rectifier potassium channels (KV1.1, KV1.2, KV1.3, KV1.5, KV1.6, KV1.2/ KV1.5, or KVLQT1), or on sodium and calcium channels has been observed. Physiologically probably more important than its action on potassium channels is its action on the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.1 (EC50 = 38 ¬± 6 nM). More specifically, it is thought that Hm1a targets the domain IV S3-S4 loop and the S1-S2 loop of Nav1.1, as application of this toxin to a chimeric channel which contained these regions resulted in full toxin sensitivity (compared to other chimeric channels which contained only one of either of these regions). This, therefore, indicates that both the S1-S2 and the S3-S4 domains determine toxin sensitivity and selectivity. Hm1a enhances the Nav1.1 channel activity by inhibiting fast and slow inactivation of the channel. Hm1a prevents the movement of the voltage sensor domain IV. Hm1a and Hm1b prevent the movement of the sensor domain towards the inner part of the cell thereby inhibiting fast inactivation of the Nav1.1 channel. Hm1a also inhibits the slow inactivation of the Nav1.1 channel by preventing a current reduction in the ion channel, but the underlying mechanism has not yet been elucidated.  Mode of action  It is thought that heteroscodratoxin-1 modifies gating of specific potassium channels by shifting the activation threshold to more positive values. As a result larger depolarizations are needed to open channels. The mechanism underlying this modification has been largely elucidated using molecular docking simulation for the KV2.1 potassium channel which is highly expressed in mammalian neurons and interacts strongly with heteroscodratoxin-1. In this model the C-terminal residue of the KV2.1 S3-segment (S3C) serves as a binding site for Hmtx-1 forming both hydrophobic and hydrophilic bonds. Interaction between the toxin and the potassium channel induces a helical movement of S3C resulting in limited spatial freedom of the S4-segment which is responsible for channel gating.  Toxicity  Information on toxic effects of Heteroscodratoxin-1 in humans is not available. In mice, however, it has been found that intracerebroventricular injection of 500 pmol HmTx1 induces convulsions, spasms, tremors and death within 1 hour.

The episode was written by Michael Hitchcock and directed by Eric Stoltz, and originally aired on Fox in the United States on November 15, 2011. Special guest star Idina Menzel is featured as rival glee club director Shelby Corcoran, and she and Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) hold a mash-up competition between the Troubletones and the New Directions. Santana (Naya Rivera) mercilessly taunts rival glee club member Finn (Cory Monteith), who ultimately responds by publicly accusing her of cowardice in her relationship with Brittany, thereby revealing to their fellow students that she is a lesbian. Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) starts a propaganda campaign against Burt Hummel (Mike O'Malley), her chief rival in the special election for congress. Principal photography for \\"Mash Off\\" occurred in October 2011. The episode features four mash-ups, including the show's 300th musical number, Adele's \\"Someone Like You\\" and \\"Rumour Has It\\", which sold 160,000 copies in its first week and debuted at number eleven on the Billboard Hot 100. All songs from the episode were released as singles available for digital download. \\"Mash Off\\" was met with a mostly positive reception from critics, and its musical performances and cover versions were also well received by reviewers. Upon its initial airing, this episode was viewed by 7.08 million American viewers and earned a 3.0/8 Nielsen rating/share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. The total viewership was up from the previous episode, \\"The First Time\\". Plot Puck (Mark Salling) fantasizes about his substitute teacher, Shelby Corcoran (Idina Menzel), whom he recently kissed and has since fallen in love with. He sings \\"Hot for Teacher\\" by Van Halen, with Mike (Harry Shum, Jr.), Blaine (Darren Criss) and Finn (Cory Monteith). Puck tries to convince Shelby, who adopted the child he fathered with Quinn (Dianna Agron), to start a relationship with him, but she rejects the idea. Quinn still wants to get Beth, her birth daughter, back from Shelby, and tries to join Shelby's glee club, the Troubletones, to get closer to Shelby. After Puck tells Shelby of Quinn's true intentions, Shelby informs Quinn that she does not want her in Beth's life. Will (Matthew Morrison) and Shelby agree to hold a mash-up competition between the New Directions and the Troubletones. Santana (Naya Rivera) takes the rivalry very seriously, and taunts and derides her former New Directions teammates‚Äîparticularly Finn. He challenges Santana and the other Troubletones to a game of dodgeball. Finn and Santana are the last two people standing, until Santana whips a ball at Finn's face, and wins the game. Despite having won, Santana violently targets Rory (Damian McGinty), and makes his nose bleed. Cheerleading coach Sue (Jane Lynch) starts a campaign against Burt Hummel (Mike O'Malley), her main rival in the election for congress. When Burt's son Kurt (Chris Colfer) accuses her of lying, Sue defends her tactics, and tells Kurt that his own campaign for senior class president is boring and lacks edge. When the presidential candidates make their assembly speeches, Kurt pledges to ban dodgeball, a sport he says is too often used to bully. Rachel (Lea Michele) withdraws her candidacy and urges everyone to vote for Kurt. Rachel later confesses to Kurt that she quit so that he could have something important to put on his college application, and because she missed being his friend. The two make up, and go to work on Kurt's campaign. Mercedes (Amber Riley) is elected president of the Troubletones, and tells Santana that she should play fair against New Directions from now on. Santana makes a rare apology to Finn in the school hallway, but her so-called apology consists of a series of insults. As she walks away, Finn retaliates by telling her to come out of the closet, and calls her a coward for constantly tearing others down while not accepting herself and her relationship with Brittany. A couple of days later, Santana is told by Sue and Burt that the niece of one of their opponents in the election overheard the conversation between her and Finn, and said opponent is about to release an attack ad that criticizes Sue for choosing a lesbian as head cheerleader. Santana runs out of the office in tears, saying that her parents do not yet know she is gay. The episode concludes with the Troubletones' mash- up of Adele songs. The moment the performance ends, Santana jumps down from the stage, blames Finn for outing her to the world and slaps him in the face. Production The episode featured a mash-up of Adele's \\"Someone Like You\\" and \\"Rumour Has It\\" \\"Mash Off\\" was written by Michael Hitchcock and directed by Eric Stoltz. Principal photography for the episode commenced on October 6, 2011, while the fifth episode, \\"The First Time\\" was still shooting; It was initially filmed in parallel with that episode, which continued through October 14, 2011, and also with the seventh episode, which began filming on October 13, 2011. This episode marked the 300th musical number Glee has filmed, which was a mash-up of two Adele songs: \\"Rumour Has It\\" and \\"Someone Like You\\", with lead vocals by Amber Riley and Naya Rivera. The performance was filmed with great fanfare \\"in front of an audience of press and crew members\\" on October 26, 2011, and included a press briefing afterward. Riley revealed during the briefing that she suggested the idea that she perform Adele to co-creators Brad Falchuk and Ryan Murphy after finding out that Adele was hoping Riley would sing her music on the show: \\"Someone actually e-mailed me a video of Adele saying that she wanted me to sing her song, so I e-mailed it to Brad and Ryan.\\" The episode was to contain a flashback to a sixteen- year-old Sue, played by Colby Minifie, singing the title song of the musical Oklahoma! in a scene that would have explained Sue's antipathy to music in the schools. Series co-creator Ian Brennan said \\"we wanted to show that Sue at one point had Broadway dreams\\", and Lynch reveals, \\"Will tells Sue, 'Poor little Susie Sylvester was told she wasn't good, and now she's got to punish the world.' Like a lot of angry people out there, Sue's a wannabe.\\" However, the scene was not broadcast because it was, according to Murphy, \\"too long for the episode\\"; he also stated that the footage, with the title \\"How Sue Sylvester Became a Bitch\\", would be released in the future, \\"either as a DVD extra or online\\". Three other mash-ups beyond the Adele one are performed in the episode: a Hall & Oates mash-up of \\"I Can't Go for That\\" and \\"You Make My Dreams\\" performed by New Directions, a mash-up of Lady Gaga's \\"You and I\\" and Eddie Rabbitt and Crystal Gayle's \\"You and I\\", performed by Morrison and Menzel, and one of Pat Benatar's \\"Hit Me with Your Best Shot\\" and Blondie's \\"One Way or Another\\", performed by competing glee clubs New Directions and the Troubletones. Van Halen's \\"Hot for Teacher\\", performed by Mark Salling, is also included. Recurring guest stars appearing in the episode include teacher Shelby Corcoran (Menzel), Kurt's father and new congressional candidate Burt Hummel (O'Malley), Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba), football coach Shannon Beiste (Dot-Marie Jones), cheerleader Becky Jackson (Lauren Potter), rival glee club member Sugar Motta (Vanessa Lengies), and exchange student Rory Flanagan (McGinty). Reception=Ratings \\"Mash Off\\" was first broadcast on November 15, 2011 in the United States on Fox. It received a 3.0/8 Nielsen rating/share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, and attracted 7.08 million American viewers during its initial airing, which tied with \\"Pot o' Gold\\" for the lowest rating of the third season. While the show's viewership was up slightly from the 6.91 million viewers for the previous episode, \\"The First Time\\", which was broadcast on November 8, 2011, the rating in the 18‚Äì49 demographic decreased slightly from the 3.1/8 rating/share received by that episode. Viewership was also up slightly in Australia, but decreased in Canada and hit a season low in the United Kingdom, where \\"Mash Off\\" was watched on Sky1 by 900,000 viewers, down over 7% compared to \\"The First Time\\" the previous week, when 973,000 viewers were watching.UK viewership data: * \\"Mash Off\\": * \\"The First Time\\": In Australia, \\"Mash Off\\" was watched by 683,000 viewers, which made Glee the fourteenth most-watched program of the night for the second week in a row.

Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone felt that the series returned to form in the episode, and commented: \\"We've said it before and we'll say it again: we like our Glee with just enough ridiculousness, and this week had it.\\" Entertainment Weekly journalist Abby West noted that she loved the fact that it \\"was a bullying episode that snuck up on us\\". Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal opined that \\"Mash Off\\" was one of the best installments of Glee, and cited the episode's storylines as highlights: \\"The mash-up episodes every season can be hit or miss, but this year was perfected to the nth degree.\\" Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times wrote that there was plenty of \\"airy fun to be found\\" in \\"Mash Off\\", but added that \\"underneath all the silly fake mustaches and snappy quotes about root-beer fountains and robot teachers beat a very dark baboon heart. In the end, that murky, telltale undercurrent burst to the fore, like a ... slap in the face, leaving us gasping and a little confused.\\" Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson stated that it was \\"surprisingly good\\", and that \\"Mash Off\\" was a \\"solid hour of television that was bursting with fantastic musical numbers and some really gratifying narrative developments\\". Michael Slezak of TV Line said that the episode contributed to a revitalization of the quality of the show's third season. Catriona Wightman of Digital Spy wrote, \\"This was a confusing episode of Glee. For a while, it seemed pretty unremarkable‚Äîa standard installment, meandering along enjoyably enough. But then, in the last few minutes, it suddenly got really rather dark indeed. I'm intrigued about what happens next.\\" The A.V. Club Emily VanDerWerff gave \\"Mash Off\\" a \\"C\\" grade, and felt that the episode did not reach its full potential. She wrote, \\"The gut-punch moment is sufficiently gut-punchy, and we'll get to that in a bit. But everything building up to it is so messy that the solidly dramatic moment almost made me angry. There's something about this show that leads to messy tonal mash-ups. But where the show's musical mash-ups are usually pretty harmonious, the tonal shifts can often be brutally unsubtle.\\" James Poniewozik of Time felt that it was notably inferior to the previous episode, with many more \\"forgettable scenes and stories\\". The character development of Santana and her interactions with Finn were well received by critics. Poniewozik stated that Santana confronting her sexuality was one of the highlights of \\"Mash Off\\". Wightman commented that despite Santana's callous personality, \\"watching her burst into tears and sob that she hasn't even told her parents about her sexuality yet [was] heartbreaking\\". Robert Canning of IGN wrote, \\"The biggest development was the unexpected way Santana's sexuality became public. It was a nice way to end things, building tension towards hopefully more resonating episodes to come.\\" VanDerWerff said that \\"the last five minutes of this episode are phenomenal, one of those times that the show gets the mix of tones just right and something that's vaguely comedic gets more and more horrifying and dramatic, and then we plunge down the rabbit hole and everything goes nuts.\\" To Ryan Gajewski of Wetpaint, the scene that concluded \\"Mash Off\\" was a \\"fascinating twist, and one that makes it hard to choose sides\\". He added, \\"Santana has certainly been not-exactly- cuddly these past few weeks, but it's still clear that Finn totally crossed the line.\\" Music and performances The opening number for the episode, \\"Hot for Teacher\\", was commended by most critics. Futterman described it as a \\"high-energy performance with the right amount of absurdity\\". Brett Berk of Vanity Fair gave the musical number a four out of five stars, and cited the choreography as the highlight of the performance. West gave it a grade of \\"A‚Äì\\", and wrote, \\"This was such big fun and the backup guys ... really helped amp it up.\\" Slezak was less enthusiastic about the sequence. He was critical of Salling's vocals, and felt that a heavy metal song was not suited to his stylings; he ultimately gave it a \\"C+\\" grade. He also criticized the choreography, and stated that he had to \\"downgrade a little for Blaine and Mike Chang's grotesque 'whoopsie, I'm hiding an erection!' dance move that will probably haunt me to my grave.\\" Berk said that the mash-up of the two \\"You and I\\" songs \\"almost worked\\", while Los Angeles Times writer L'Oreal Thompson praised the vocals of Menzel: \\"It's official. Shelby sings Gaga as good as, if not better than, Gaga sings Gaga.\\" Slezak awarded the performance a \\"B\\" grade, and opined: \\"I loved the audacity of mashing up Lady Gaga with an Eddie Rabbit‚ÄìCrystal Gayle chestnut, and the results had the sheen of '70s a.m. radio fare. Shelby's voice was almost too crystal clear for the Gaga half of the composition.\\" Futterman said that Menzel \\"can kill a Gaga ballad\\", and while she \\"outshines\\" Morrison, he \\"complements her nicely\\". West gave the mash-up a \\"B+\\", called it \\"really well-done\\" and said it was \\"elevated\\" by Menzel's voice. MTV's Kevin P. Sullivan wanted Menzel to interpret more songs by Lady Gaga. In contrast, Rae Votta of Billboard denounced the sequence, and called it \\"horrendous\\". West gave the mash-up of \\"Hit Me With Your Best Shot\\" / \\"One Way or Another\\" a \\"B\\" grade, while Slezak gave the performance a \\"B+\\". Slezak wrote, \\"Santana's moments on lead were obviously stronger than Finn's Auto-Tuned into submission vocals, but that doesn't mean the number wasn't a hoot.\\" Futterman called it a \\"fierce match\\", and added the mash-up was well crafted. Hankinson rated it the second best performance of the episode. Brian Moyler of Gawker, who writes of his dislike of mash-ups, characterized it as \\"the only mash-up of the night that actually makes sense\\" but he called it an \\"awful aural clash\\" and \\"the second least dreadful\\". Moyler felt that the combination of \\"I Can't Go for That\\" and \\"You Make My Dreams\\" was \\"an abomination\\" and \\"New Directions at their worst\\". He summarized: \\"The outfits are hokey, the dance is silly, and the music has absolutely no emotion in it.\\" Slezak, however, issued the performance an \\"A‚Äì\\" grade, and wrote, \\"The Troubletones beat New Directions in this particular battle, but I loved the frothy, silly spirit of this number, with the guys dressed like Miami Vice extras, Puck and Blaine rocking Oatestaches, and Tina getting a little moment on lead vocals.\\" Votta characterized the performance as a \\"fun, retro number\\", and Jen Chaney of The Washington Post was similarly pleased, and gave it a \\"B+\\". The episode's concluding musical number, \\"Rumour Has It\\" / \\"Someone Like You\\", was acclaimed as its main highlight. Raymund Flandez described Rivera's vocals as \\"electrifying\\" and \\"golden\\". Futterman wrote that the performance was one of Glee best sequences: \\"Mercedes and Santana nail their vocals and the song combines great tracks from one of the year's biggest albums while capturing both the sass and sadness of the Troubletones at this particular moment.\\" Votta called it the best performance since the cast's rendition of \\"Don't Stop Believin' in the season one finale, \\"Journey to Regionals\\", and stated, \\"Naya Rivera's powerful vocals and the strong arrangement still packs the emotional punch Glee was targeting.\\" Chaney awarded the sequence an \\"A+\\" grade: \\"Given the emotional stakes raised by Santana's outing, which happened in the scene right before this performance, and the fact that it marked the series's 300th musical performance, this marriage\\" of the two Adele songs, \\"Rumour Has It\\" and \\"Someone Like You\\", was \\"all the more powerful\\". Moyler asserted that the number was \\"perfection\\" and said, \\"This is why I watch Glee. It is just brilliant from Mercedes first belting to the snaps on the beat to the choreography with the girls walking in a circle and making little whispers to Santana bringing tears to my eyes singing 'Someone Like You' as if it was the last song she'll ever sing in her damn life.\\" Cinema Blend's Melissa Duko stated that the show \\"hit it out of the park\\" and added that it was her favorite performance of the season. Slezak gave the number an \\"A+\\" and wrote, \\"Nobody can completely match Adele doing Adele, and yet Naya Rivera and Amber Riley somehow made the sum of this mashup a worthy equal to Adele's glorious original parts.\\" In December 2012, TV Guide named the mash-up one of Glee best performances. Chart history While five singles were released from the episode, it was the four mash-ups that debuted on the Billboard Hot 100. \\"Rumour Has It\\" / \\"Someone Like You\\" debuted at number eleven in the issue dated November 23, 2011. It sold 160,000 digital downloads in its first week, the fifth-highest first week digital sales for the series. The mash-up sparked a revival in sales for \\"Rumour Has It\\", which achieved a new peak at number sixty that same week, during which it sold 42,000 digital copies. In Canada, the mash-up entered on the Canadian Hot 100 at number twelve on the strength of sales of 14,000 downloads. The remaining three mash-ups that charted in the Billboard Hot 100 were \\"You and I\\" / \\"You and I\\" at number sixty-nine, \\"I Can't Go for That\\" / \\"You Make My Dreams\\" at number eighty, and \\"Hit Me with Your Best Shot\\" / \\"One Way or Another\\" at number eighty-six.Peak chart positions for season 3 singles in the United States: \\"Rumour Has It\\" / \\"Someone Like You\\", \\"You And I\\" / \\"You And I\\", \\"I Can't Go For That\\" / \\"You Make Me Dreams\\" and \\"Hit Me With Your Best Shot\\" / \\"One Way Or Another\\" In Canada, \\"I Can't Go for That\\" / \\"You Make My Dreams\\" debuted at number seventy-four, \\"You and I\\" / \\"You and I\\" at number ninety-three, and \\"Hit Me with Your Best Shot\\" / \\"One Way or Another\\" at number ninety-five. \\"Hot for Teacher\\" did not chart, though it and \\"Rumour Has It\\" / \\"Someone Like You\\" were both featured on the subsequently released soundtrack album Glee: The Music, Volume 7.

By blocking the inactivation of sodium ion channels, Œ±-scorpion toxins prolong action potentials. Sources Bukatoxin (short names: BukaTx or BKTx, alternative name: BuK-alpha-Tx) is a neurotoxin that is expressed and secreted by the venom gland of the scorpion Buthus martensii Karsch (Chinese Scorpion). Chemistry Bukatoxin has a linear sequence of 65-residue amino acid with 8 cysteines (at positions 12, 16, 22, 26, 36, 46, 48 and 63) that are linked by four disulfide bridges. The molecular weight of the neurotoxin is 7.2 kDa.https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P82815 Bukatoxin is a member of the 4C-C scorpion toxin superfamily. It can be further categorized as a polypeptide gating modifier toxin that belongs to the Œ±-subfamily of scorpion neurotoxins. Target Based on its homology to other members of the Œ±-scorpion toxin family, bukatoxin most likely blocks the inactivation of neuronal sodium channels by binding to the neurotoxin receptor site 3 of sodium channels, thereby prolonging the action potential. Mode of Action The region between 52 and 56 in the amino acid sequence of bukatoxin, the 52PDKVP 56 loop, interacts with the neurotoxin receptor site 3, which is located on the extracellular loop of sodium channels that connects the S3 and S4 segments on the domain IV. Specifically, the tripeptide segment 53 DKV 55, which forms a surface loop that is available for binding, is suggested to play a significant role in the blocking of the inactivation of sodium channels. Other residues that could contribute to the binding of bukatoxin to the neurotoxin receptor site 3 of the sodium channels are the Val 1 and Asp 9, which reside in the same surface loop. The binding of bukatoxin is thought to lead to blocking of conformational changes in the sodium channel, by preventing the outward movement of the IVS4 transmembrane segment during depolarization. As a result, inactivation of the channel becomes slower, leading to a broadened action potential.Catterall W.A., Cest√®le S., Yarov- Yarovoy V., Yu F.H., Konoki K., Scheuer T. (2007). Voltage-gated ion channels and gating modifier toxins. Toxicon, 49(2), 124-141, Effects It has been shown that relaxation of carbachol-precontracted rat anococcygeous muscle occurs through the binding of bukatoxin to sodium channels, suggesting that bukatoxin has a muscle relaxation effect. Bukatoxin produces the effects by mediating the activation of nitrergic nerve fibers, most likely via an effect on presynaptic sodium channels.Srinivasan K.N., Nirthanana S, Sasakic T., Satoc K., Chengd B., Gweeb M.C.E., Kinie R.M., Gopalakrishnakonea P.

Grace moves to Italy with David in mid-2004 and is not seen on-screen again until late in 2006, when her daughter Kay admits that Sam's ex, Ivy, had hired David to pretend to be Grace's husband in a ploy to win Sam for herself. While in London awaiting a flight back to the United States on January 4, 2007, Grace is killed in a bus explosion engineered by Vincent Clarkson. Character history Grace has no memories prior to Sam rescuing her from a Boston fire in the late 1970s. It is said that the evil witch Tabitha set the fire due to Tabitha not wanting the Standish women coming into their full powers. He got her name from a piece of paper he found in her pocket. They married soon after, and he brought her home to Harmony, to live in the house where he grew up. Over the years they had three children, and Grace helped Sam raise his much younger brother Hank. Grace and Sam looked for her family, but after the births of their children, Grace decided that she didn't need to know her past. That worked until after their oldest, Noah, left home for university. Grace started wondering about her family, so Sam started using the Internet to search for them. He found a woman, \\"Seeker\\", in a chat room, and managed to realize that she was a member of Grace's family. Grace was thrilled to learn that she had a twin sister. Over the years Faith tried to find her sister but due to the evil witch Tabitha Lenox, who was also Grace's next door neighbor, she couldn't do so. She didn't realize that her own children had met her niece, Charity, and that her daughter, Kay, was keeping the two apart in the hopes that Charity and Faith would leave, and she would get Miguel. Grace and Faith managed to connect once, via their computers, but then couldn't. Faith was the victim in a fire set by an ancient enemy of the Standish family (the Bennett's next door neighbor, Tabitha). Her twin sister was dead, but Grace had something to hold on to. Her niece, Charity. Once Charity was out of the hospital, Grace and Sam moved her into the Bennett home. Grace soon realized that, like her, Charity has something special about her. While Grace received visits from a little angel girl, Charity had premonitions. She never would have guessed that her premonitions were warning her about a new friend of hers, Ivy Crane. For nearly two years, Grace believed that Ivy was a good friend of hers, because Ivy made her believe that. At no time did Grace ever suspect that Ivy was merely pretending to be her friend to break up her marriage. She began having nightmares about a woman who wanted to take Sam away from her, and even had Sam's son. Her worst nightmares ever came true the night of Ethan and Theresa's engagement party. Not only did she learn that Sam had committed adultery with Ivy (before he met Grace), but Ethan Winthrop is Sam's son! In a dead faint, she fell down the stairs of the Crane mansion, and woke up in the hospital fighting for her life, and that of her unborn son (the child the doctors had told her it was impossible to conceive). Her mental condition was fragile at best, and seeing Sam and Ivy in a compromising condition was the last straw. Grace lost the baby, and blamed Sam for it. Grace also cursed Ivy with her Standish powers. It took Grace hours to convince Sam to take her home, and when they got there, they found out that Charity had been seized by the demons of Hell. Grace blamed Sam for that as well, because she knew something was wrong and he wouldn't take her home. Shortly afterwards they all tried to find a way to save Charity but all failed resulting in the Bennett house being sucked into the ground by demons of hell. Grace, Jessica and Charity moved in at Tabitha's house. Sam moved in at a hotel. Sam and Grace were finding it hard to connect. Her anger didn't last long though. After hearing Sam once again blast Ivy for her selfishness and tell Ivy how much he loved his wife, Grace, she forgave him. Until she found out he knew she was there the whole time. Sam and Grace finally settled things between them, until a man named David Hastings came to town, claiming to be Grace's long-lost husband from before the fire. David also claims that Grace is the mother of his teenage son, John Hastings. David is actually a man who was blackmailed by Ivy to break up Sam and Grace, and Grace is not John's mother. This made Sam and Grace's marriage tear apart once again. Kay, the middle of the children, got angry at this and wanted to become evil. Grace always take Charity's side over Kay; this angered her even more. One day, as she went to a park, she overheard David and Ivy plotting to tear Grace and Sam. Kay then, angry at her mother, started to work with them. One day Kay got very angry and left home. She then stayed over at Tabitha's house. Whilst there Kay told everyone about David and Ivy. But at first nobody believed her (except her father). Once Kay discovered that Tabitha is really a witch and whats in her basement she wanted to show and tell everyone. But when Tabitha showed her what will happen she then changed her mind and worked with them. In March 2004 she decided to leave Harmony and go with David and John to Italy. Having a Dysfunctional marriage with Sam. Eventually, Kay exposes what she, Eve, and Ivy did, causing Sam to kick Ivy out of his home. Sam contacts Grace and tells her everything, and Grace immediately plans to return to the United States. While getting ready to return to Harmony, Grace receives a mysterious phone call. She exclaims to the mystery caller that \\"My mind is made up! I won't be a victim anymore!\\" before she hangs up. She is able to see Kay in her wedding dress thanks to a camera phone, and tells Kay, Jessica, Noah, and Sam that she loves them and will hopefully be back in time to see them at Fox and Kay's wedding reception. She also warns Sam that someone is going to try to hurt their family and friends, and she will tell him in person who it is when she returns. She is seen getting on a bus that will take her to a different airport so that she can return home when a man disguised as a priest blows up the bus, killing her on January 4, 2007. It is later revealed that Vincent Clarkson was behind the bomb, and it is implied that Grace discovered that Alistair Crane was alive in Europe and that he subsequently ordered her death. Supernatural incidents Grace, like all other Standish descendants, has powers. It was mentioned and seen by Tabitha that she has the power to curse. When Grace found out about Sam and Ivy's love affair she lost her baby due to the pressure of finding out. She became angry with Ivy and then cursed her with her Standish powers; however, unlike Kay, Grace never knew how to use her powers properly. Grace also frequently received visits from the little angel girl about danger which threatened her and her loved ones. Hidden Passions According to the book Hidden Passions Grace and Faith's parents were Zachary and Mercy Sutter. But when Tabitha killed their father, Mercy took her maiden name Standish. It is said in the book that Grace had known about Sam through her Standish powers and knew they would be in love. In the book she at one time prayed and saved Sam and ivy at the time when Tabitha tried to kill them. One day when Mercy had a visit from a little angel girl about one of the twins giving birth to a powerful Standish descendant, Mercy and Faith went to church and prayed. Meanwhile, Grace became skeptical and left for a world tour and when she did she went to Boston where Tabitha had set a fire to her apartment intending to kill her but she survived and suffered amnesia. It was during that fire that Sam had rescued her. Information from the book about this has not been shown (on-screen).

Created by head writer James E. Reilly, Jessica was portrayed by three actresses during the show's run: Mary Elizabeth Winstead (July 5, 1999 to March 28, 2000), Jade Harlow (June 5, 2000 to July 8, 2003) and Danica Stewart (July 10, 2003 to July 17, 2008). She was also played by model Michelle Holgate for two episodes in 2002 when Harlow was unavailable. Jessica is a member of the Bennett family. DevelopmentStorylines=Mary Elizabeth Winstead (1999‚Äì2000) Jessica was a quiet, seemingly perfect daughter. She was very close to her mother, working part-time in her mother's craft shop, even though she was only fourteen when the show started. While she loved her sister Kay, the two had an adversarial relationship, mostly because she knew that Kay was always scheming. When push came to shove, though, she was there for Kay, refusing to tell their parents that Kay knew Faith was Grace's sister for weeks before the rest of them found out the truth, and that Kay's schemes to get Miguel are the real reason that Faith and Grace never met. In part because she sees their love for each other, and in part to foil her scheming sibling, Jessica has always been a strong supporter of Charity and Miguel. Jade Harlow (2000‚Äì2003) Jessica's first major act on her own was to switch the voting box at the prom, which Kay had rigged to make sure Miguel was crowned king and she was crowned queen. She was in the background for a long period of time, but has been involved more and more in Kay's plans to get to Miguel by her own secret crush on Miguel. Unfortunately for Jessica, Reese can only see one woman. Her older sister Kay. As the youngest character on the show, Jessica is the only one still in high-school. Jessica's faith in her family was shaken by the recent appearance of David and John, but she is determined to support her mother, and help her new brother John acclimate to life with siblings. Although she suspects David is up to no good, she has no idea that John isn't her brother. Right now Jessica is stuck in the middle of the war between her sister, Kay, their parents, Miguel, and Charity. Jessica was the one who found Kay in Miguel's bed, and for just one moment, saw Charity in the bed instead of Kay. She knows that Miguel believed that it was Charity he was with, and has seen enough of her sister's hatred and evil over the years to know that Kay forced herself on Miguel. But she doesn't have much of a foothold right now, as everyone recently learned that Jessica was secretly involved with Kay's boyfriend Reese for the past few months. When Kay used magic on some popcorn in the hopes of breaking up Charity and Miguel, the plan backfired, and instead, it broke up Jessica and Reese. It wasn't long before Jessica realized her sister was behind her break-up. Danica Stewart (2003‚Äì2008) After graduating from high-school, Jessica got a job as a \\"mark\\" cosmetics girl to help pay her way. Although currently attending college, much of her time is spent worrying about her family. Since Grace chose David Hastings, Jessica turned her back on her mother, in part because she was vulnerable to her sister Kay's manipulations. Jessica seemed to be the \\"good\\" Bennett sister, never getting into trouble, but when Sam and Ivy's relationship started getting more serious, Jessica ended up on a downward spiral, and began acting out by cutting herself and smoking. She became a club girl, and it wasn't long before she was drugged and raped by an older man named Randy at a club. Jessica soon met the older Spike, the owner of the sleaziest late-night dive in Harmony. Spike took advantage of Jessica's confusion and pain, and it wasn't long before he had his young lover addicted to drugs, and convinced her that she had to prostitute herself for him on the streets. He used guilt to convince her to do it, because her family was responsible for his club burning down. Every time she tried to fight him to go him, Spike would manipulate her into coming back to him, and it wasn't long before Jessica started experiencing blackouts and waking up next to dead johns. Although Paloma and Simone helped her to cover her role in the murders, even Jessica herself doesn't know if she actually killed the men. Jessica kept trying to get away with Spike, and it seemed like she finally did in Rome, where The couple eventually married during the summer of 2006, although the wedding was not shown on-air like other marriages on Passions. In November 2006, Jessica attended several meetings of AA for her drinking problem. Jessica had the idea that Miguel wanted her help to forget about Kay and tried to seduce him. Jessica's recovery was set back when she learned that Grace had died in an explosion in London while trying to get home to reunite with Sam. Jessica didn't believe she had the strength to leave Spike, but she was given a vision of her future by Endora and that gave her the strength to move back into her father's house. The same day she moved in, she learned that she was pregnant, by Spike. Spike wanted her to sell the baby and she refused, running to Tabitha's house next door for safety. Spike tried to kill Jessica by burying her in a crate. Jessica's family and friends searched everywhere for her, but they were too late; Jessica and her unborn baby's spirits left her body. However, Kay had everyone pray to God for Jessica's safe return before they unburied her, causing their spirits to return to Jessica's body. After unburying her, Eve was able to wake up Jessica. She is currently at home with policeman guarding her, since Spike broke out of jail. Sam soon discovered Jessica's role in the murders and was about to arrest her, but thanks to the magical intervention by her novice witch sister Kay, Spike was revealed to be the murderer and arrested by Paloma Lopez-Fitzgerald. Jessica returned to Harmony on January 7, 2008, after staying in a convent with her cousin Charity in order to give birth away from Spike and those that she felt were judging her. Either in late 2007 or early January 2008, Jessica gave birth to a son, whom she named Samuel Bennett after her father and grandfather; she eventually gave the boy the middle name of Herbert at the demand of Spike, whose legal first name is Herbert. Kay has since mentioned that Jessica entered rehab to make sure she stayed clean and to keep herself and Samuel away from Spike. Jessica returned on July 16, 2008 to wish Kay luck for her wedding to Miguel. She revealed that she had reconciled with Reese, and was continuing in rehab with her son Sam by her side. Jessica did not attend Kay and Miguel's wedding due to the temptations of alcohol. It is revealed in the series finale, Jessica has powers like her sister, cousin, and mother. Supernatural incidents Although a Standish woman, Jessica seemingly did not inherit the Standish powers, but Jessica believes in both her mother and cousin's visions and powers. Even though Jessica seemingly has no powers, though, she has an uncanny ability to see through evil. In the series finale of \\"Passions\\", it is revealed by Kay that Jessica also received the Standish powers and she is a witch; however, she chooses not to use them.

Kay has been played by Taylor Anne Mountz (July 5, 1999 ‚Äì August 2, 2000), Deanna Wright (September 25, 2000‚ÄîOctober 6, 2003), and Heidi Mueller (October 24, 2003‚ÄîAugust 7, 2008) since being introduced to the show in 1999. She was also played temporarily by Gina Marie May (August 3‚ÄîSeptember 20, 2000) while producers searched for a replacement for Mountz. Stephanie Patton also portrayed Kay in various flashbacks in 2003 at age nine. Character history Kay is the middle Bennett child. She refuses to get along with her sister, teasing her constantly. She developed a crush on her friend Miguel, and uses her best friend, Simone, and his best friend, Reese, to try to get closer to him. His growing relationship with Charity is a threat to her, so Kay has been doing everything to get rid of Charity, knowing she is her cousin. When Simone suggested that Charity's long-lost aunt might be her mother's sister, Kay did everything she could to make sure that the two never met - her crush on Miguel proved more important to her than her mother's happiness. Although she pretended to support Charity and Miguel, in reality, she was trying to keep them apart. After the incident in the mineshaft, Kay became more determined than ever to get Miguel, and sold her soul to Hecuba in order to get him. She helped Hecuba arrange for the demons of Hell to get their hands on Charity, but her plan failed when the demons seized Kay as well. Kay was lucky enough to escape from the bowels of Hell and get her soul back, but her flirtation with goodness didn't last too long before she found the Book of Spells, and cast a spell to entomb Charity in a block of ice, and created a Zombie Charity to aid her in getting Miguel. Things seemed to be going okay, until Zombie Charity developed a mind of her own, and developed her own agenda. While her plan has always been to get Miguel at all costs, even Kay isn't heartless enough to want her family dead to get what she wants. Zombie Charity has been threatening not only Miguel, but also Grace, and Kay tried her best to convince Zombie Charity not to kill any of her loved ones. Zombie Charity was defeated, but not before Kay committed the ultimate betrayal, she used Charity's essence to make Miguel think she was her cousin, then seduced him. Miguel was horrified and disgusted upon learning that he had actually slept with Kay, because he had no idea it was her, they found Charity a short time later, and while Miguel is thrilled to have his love back, Kay is still (metaphorically) wishing her cousin dead. Not only that, but she is fighting with Grace as well, blaming her mother for all of her problems; due to all the years that Grace had neglected Kay (albeit unintentionally/unwittingly) since her cousin, Charity came into the picture. Kay watched the man she was in love with made plans to marry her cousin, and sought to destroy them at all times by threatening to tell Charity, even though Eve said it would be dangerous for her to know the truth. She also continued her verbal attacks on her mother, who would not support Kay in her schemes to destroy Miguel and Charity's relationship. On Charity and Miguel's wedding day, Kay fainted at the Church, and everyone was shocked to learn Kay was pregnant. Kay was thrilled that her condition resulted in the wedding being postponed, and despite Miguel informing everyone that he never would have gone near her, Kay told everyone that Miguel was meant to be hers. She is basing everything on something Miguel said once in the mine shaft, which is that if Charity never came to town, he may have asked her out. Recently she vowed to move out of the house after her mother gave her a choice. Either follow the rules that Grace and Sam had or leave. So to punish her mother for not helping her with her schemes and for treating her badly (as well as the fact that it became the last straw for her; this would be the breaking point of their relationship) Kay left in the middle of a blizzard, putting both herself and her unborn child at risk. Kay finally ended up at Tabitha's and blackmailed Tabitha into letting her live with her. Once she learned that Ivy and David were lying to Grace and Sam, rather than tell her parents the truth (no longer having any loyalty to her mother; in Kay's eyes Grace never loved or cared about her and she wanted to get revenge on her mother) she immediately began using it to her advantage, holding it over her mother's head whenever her mother wouldn't help her in her schemes to get Miguel. Kay also decided she wanted to learn to be a real witch like Tabitha, so that she could use the same evil she used to get Miguel into bed to break him and Charity up permanently. Unfortunately, nothing is working for Kay. Miguel is now wary of her after getting a glimpse of her dark side, and he is more in love with Charity than ever, even though Kay has just given birth to his daughter. The baby's life was in jeopardy numerous times, but it didn't stop Kay from continuing her scheming. She even used her daughter's health crises in an attempt to manipulate Miguel away from Charity. Although she is unwilling to kill Charity to win Miguel (partly because she doesn't want to end up in prison, and mainly because of her morals), she is still desperate to break up Miguel and Charity so that she can force him to be with her. She refuses to listen to Tabitha and Simone when they tell her that if Miguel is only with her by force, then it's not love. When her niece Sarah died Kay didn't care about the baby or her half-brother Ethan, only how she could use it to get to Miguel. Kay continued to pursue Miguel, thrilled when they seemed to break up after Miguel caught Charity with Reese. Once she realized that Miguel was still dreaming about Charity and had no interest in her, she began plotting again full-force with Tabitha. Tabitha put a spell on Kay that turned her into a dog, and in that form, Kay (unwilling) went after Charity in Castleton, nearly killing her. When Miguel, trying to save Charity, speared the dog, it turned back into Kay, leading Miguel to believe he had accidentally speared Kay and not the dog. In the aftermath, Kay learned that due to the intensive medical damage, she could never have more children. When Miguel still refused to give up his love for Charity, Kay railed at him, blaming him for everything that had ever gone wrong in her life. It didn't make a difference, Miguel still left Harmony. After Miguel left Harmony, Kay began to turn her life around. Although still living with Tabitha, Kay worked double shifts at the cannery to support herself and her baby daughter, and began to become a responsible adult. She started realising all of the things she had done wrong over the years, and although she did not confess the details, apologized to her father and sister for everything that had happened. With Miguel out of Harmony, Kay fell in love with the rich Crane heir Fox Crane during a tsunami that hit Harmony. The two moved into Tabitha's house. Kay had briefly tutored under Tabitha to learn magic, but her powers never really surfaced. After a Cinderella-esque romance, Kay and Fox became engaged. Kay's storyline soon shifted to her struggle to remain faithful to Fox. Ivy Winthrop, Fox's overbearing mother, was able to trick Miguel into returning to Harmony. Ivy, due to Theresa's betrayal of her favorite son Ethan Winthrop, is distrustful of most women who become interested in her sons. Ivy is particularly hostile towards Kay because Kay knows Ivy's darkest secret - that Ivy had blackmailed David Hastings into pretending to be Kay's mother, Grace's first husband so Ivy could get Kay's father Sam, her first love, back. Kay, who thought she had overcome her feelings for Miguel, soon realized that her old feelings were resurfacing. However, Kay refused to be with Miguel even after he declared that he had given up on Charity and wanted to be a family with Kay and Maria. Kay was dealing with her jealousy over Miguel's relationship with Siren, a mermaid-turned-human. However, Endora zapped Siren into a fish tank after Fox complained that she was complicating his relationship with Kay. Despite the chaos regarding Fox and Miguel, Kay married Fox on January 10, 2007. Fox lied that he had a terminal illness to get Kay to stay with him and compounded his lies by accusing Miguel of running him down with his car and trying to kill him. Miguel was convicted in a sham trial and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole; the judge was blackmailed by the same blackmailer Vincent, who was taking control of Theresa's life. Kay planned on telling Fox, from much urging by Miguel, that she is leaving him for Miguel. She tried once, but he pretended that he was asleep. But Julian Crane struck a deal with Kay; that he would get Miguel out of prison, if she stayed with Fox. Kay agreed and now she waits for Fox to die of his \\"terminal illness\\" so she can be with Miguel forever. In June 2007, Kay accompanied Tabitha to another realm to rescue Tabitha's daughter Endora from two evil witches. They wanted to utilize Endora's powers for evil. The witches proved to be too much for Tabitha and Endora, and it looked as though they were going to lose. However, Kay used her love for her friends to summon the magical powers deep within her and vanquished the two evil witches. She was excited about her newly released powers and experimented with them, with disastrous results. One evening, Fox caught Kay and Miguel and started to fight with him. Kay used her magical powers with the help of the demon elf she released when looking for her kidnapped sister Jessica. She saw that Fox had faked his illness and left him. She and Miguel then had a commitment ceremony. Kay's divorce from Fox was set to be finalized but was instead dissolved when he was murdered. Tragedy also ensued when Miguel found out the truth that Kay, Tabitha, and Endora were witches. The \\"Boys in the Basement\\" retaliated and kidnapped Endora. When Miguel tried to save her they were both sucked into another dimension. Both Kay and Tabitha tried to rescue Endora and Miguel by seeking them out in other dimensions but, to no avail. Both later received a ransom note from the \\"dark side\\" ordering the two witches to inflict Harmony with evil and misery or else never see their loved one's ever again. A desperate Tabitha went back to her evil ways much to Kay's reluctance. Kay also has become a main suspect in the murder of her late husband Fox, and has been falsely/wrongfully accused by Ivy of being a serial killer. Both Kay and Miguel, and Tabitha and Endora were reunited on Christmas. Miguel made Kay and Tabitha both take a solemn oath never to do magic again, much to Tabitha's dismay. The newly acquainted couple also begin planning a double wedding with Miguel's sister Paloma Lopez- Fitzgerald, and Kay's brother Noah Bennett which eventually turned into a quad wedding with Miguel's brother Luis Lopez-Fitzgerald and Noah's ex-girlfriend Fancy Crane and Ethan Winthrop and Gwen Hotchkiss joining in. Kay and Miguel married on the July 21, 2008 episode. Miguel and Maria briefly traveled to another dimension in order for Kay to find a way to stop the disaster that was destined to destroy Harmony, but she was unsuccessful. When Tabitha prophesied that a volcano would destroy Harmony, Kay went to heaven and spoke to Timmy, who said that Tabitha had to become a Christian in order to save Harmony. Supernatural incidents Although a Standish woman, Kay (seemingly) did not receive the Standish powers. However, in June 2007 Kay and Tabitha rescued Endora from evil witches who wanted to use her powers for evil Kay used her power of love, this is when Kay realized that she has receive the Standish powers. When Tabitha was burnt at the stake by the testimony of Prudence Standish, Tabitha cursed all Standish descendants to die by fire (that prophecy which came true when Faith died in a fire and Grace who died in a bus that exploded). Tabitha also prophesied that one of the Standish descendants will use their powers for evil. The prophecy came true in the form of Kay, whether she used her powers for good or evil, every spell she cast led to disaster. According to Tabitha, unlike Grace and Charity, Kay knows how to use her powers properly. Since Tabitha embraced goodness at the end of the series; it is very likely that the curse on the Standish descendants has been lifted.

Out of costume, Carla was portrayed by Tess Alexandra Parker, while Sisco actually portrayed the costumed Carla in most of her appearances as \\"Charity\\". Born to Faith Standish and an unknown man, Charity has the power to channel the forces of goodness. She was not aware of these powers for the first fifteen years of her life, leading a very sheltered life. Character history=First Moments with Miguel and Beginning of visions(1999-2000) Charity was born to an unknown man and Faith Standish, very little is known about her life prior to the beginning of the series. Her mother, Faith, loved her dearly and had fear of evil forces trying to harm her daughter. Charity had powers of goodness which would come into full fruition once she made love to her true love Miguel Lopez-Fitzgerald. For this reason Charity never had the chance to go to school and meet friends since her mother feared for the life of her daughter. Faith was the only one who knew this secret. Charity met her lover Miguel at a carnival festival held by Grace Bennett, Faith's twin sister. Faith over the years tried to find her twin sister Grace but because of the evil witch Tabitha Lenox causing obstruction she couldn't be able to do so. When, at the carnival, they entered a tent where Tabitha was telling fortunes. When they entered, everything started spinning in mid air but stopped when Faith and Charity left. After the carnival festival, Charity and Faith went home and whilst home, Tabitha tricked her and tried to drag her through the sink into her house but failed. At one stage, Grace and Faith were close to meeting when they were at the same restaurant, but didn't when Tabitha stopped them. After that, Tabitha also tried to disguise her voice as a small child and make Charity fall into the sea but failed when saved by Miguel. When Charity was leaving harmony, Tabitha disguised herself as a taxi driver and tried to get Charity alone, but because of the little angel girl giving a sign to priest church Father Lonigan Miguel came and took Charity home. Shortly afterwards, when Faith was on internet she was chatting to her twin sister Grace. When she was about to show the evil that tried to destroy Grace they were interrupted by Tabitha who changed the picture. When Tabitha found out that Faith and Grace were about meet Tabitha tried to put a stop to it. Tabitha disguised herself as a dog and went after Faith. She and Faith had a scuffle which accidentally created a fire. Faith died in the fire but Charity was saved by her lover Miguel. This incident also caused Tabitha to loose her powers to the dark side since she failed to destroy Charity. After that she moved in with Grace and her family. She barely remembers her life before the fire. Charity moving in angered charity's cousin Kay Bennett. She was also in love with Miguel and wanted him. Kay resented Charity since she came in the way of her and Miguel. While living with Grace, Tabitha time after time tried to get rid of charity. She tried killing her by putting her on railway track but was saved by Miguel. On Halloween, she conjured up demons from a fire and tried to destroy Grace and Charity but failed when Father Lonigan came and threw holy water destroying the demons. When Charity arrived at Tabitha's house, she tried to kill her through a fire poker, but failed. She tried burning her at the stake when Charity was doing a school play about witches but was saved by the angel girl and Miguel. Tabitha also dressed up as Santa and tried electrocuting Charity and Miguel by lighting a Christmas tree but failed. On New Year's Eve she tried to kill Charity by chopping her head off but failed once again. While at New Year's Eve party the little angel girl came to her telling Tabitha that charity might be brought to the dark side due to the death of someone close. This incited Tabitha to try to find a way to make Charity become evil. Tabitha found out through an ancient tome that Charity can be brought over to evil if she kills the person she loves, Miguel. Tabitha tried to make Charity kill Miguel by giving them a patty. She poisoned the patty that Charity was going to give Miguel but Timmy Lenox (Tabitha's brought to life doll) swapped the patty making Tabitha eat the patty. Tabitha melted but through the help of Timmy, Dr Bombay and an old enemy of Tabitha, Matilda Matthews, she came back to life. Again she tried to make Charity kill Miguel by making Charity give Miguel poison tea but failed when Charity saw her tea leaves and screamed making Miguel spill his tea. Kay trying to find a way, also to get rid of charity, found out that when Charity was near a bird statue she was freaking out by having visions. Kay found out that Tabitha possessed the bird statue. Kay found the bird statue and put it near Charity and it made her have visions she couldn't explain. She was eventually put in a psych ward. Tabitha found out about what Kay was doing and went to the hospital. Tabitha then put an act of being crazy and ended up in the psych ward. While being next to the room where Charity was she was overhearing everything. When Charity's situation wasn't getting better, Tabitha overheard the doctor's administrating a drug which if given will make anyone do what another person wants them to do. Tabitha used the opportunity and told Charity to kill Miguel. Simone Russell, Kay's best friend, knew about her schemes and didn't want Charity to suffer anymore. She removed the bird statue which stopped Charity's visions. Charity was then released from the hospital while at home still under the drug she tried to kill Miguel but however was stopped. Tabitha's scheme failed once again. Tabitha made a very narrow escape from the hospital. While at home Charity had continuous visions of Miguel being dead. She broke up with him for a while fearing his life. Miguel decided to go on a ski trip. Charity sensed danger for Miguel. Tabitha however found out and tried to make Charity kill Miguel by making her send Miguel into a dangerous place in the ski trip. She started an avalanche which almost killed Miguel and Charity. All survived and Tabitha's scheme failed. While scheme after scheme failed for Tabitha, the dark forces in her basement were becoming angry at her failure. Charity, while sleepwalking, approached the dark forces. They also tried to kill Charity but failed. Harmony high prom was coming up and Tabitha needed to find a way for charity to become evil. Tabitha found a movie called Carrie and knew what to do. She told Timmy to take the movie and hide it under Kay's bed. Tabitha knew if Kay watched the movie she'd know what to do. Kay got an idea from the movie and decided on prom night to spill fish guts on her. Evil Charity and the pendant(2000) Tabitha however created an evil pendant which would possess Charity and make her use her powers for evil and kill Miguel. Tabitha gave the pendant to Charity and on the night of the prom Kay spilled fish guts on Charity triggering her powers and making Charity evil. The pendant made her use her powers resulting in the prom boat being destroyed and everyone almost drowning. After the night of the prom Charity, possessed by the pendant, tried to kill Miguel but failed. She cooked quiche with poison mushrooms but Grace gave the wrong mushroom to Miguel resulting in Tabitha eating poison mushroom but survived. Evil Charity told Timmy and Tabitha to remove all the brakes of Miguel's bike and make the bike loose so Miguel would die. This plan failed however, since Theresa Lopez-Fitzgerald took the bike almost killing her. Evil Charity planted snakes and tried to kill Miguel by trapping him in the shed. But Miguel escaped and evil Charity failed. Miguel was planning their high school trip and decided to take everyone to the woods. Tabitha wanted to stop them but failed. When in the woods Charity went into a trance and tried to burn Tabitha at the stake but was interrupted. Tabitha then made Charity wear the pendant and then told evil Charity to go near the mining shaft and try and push Miguel into it. Miguel was pushed in it. Evil Charity also pushed Kay inside the shaft. Tabitha angry at evil Charity pushed her inside. While inside Kay was trying to pull Miguel away as she was doing so Miguel's foot kicked a box. The box had extreme powers of goodness that could destroy Tabitha and the evil in Charity. While the box was opened, Saint Michael an angel tried to kill Tabitha but failed when Timmy closed the box. Evil Charity tried to kill Miguel while in the mine shaft but failed continuously. Hell in the Closet(2000-2001) While in the mining shaft Kay and Miguel found the evil witch Hecuba's cave. Hecuba was an evil witch trapped in a cave by Tabitha. While leaving the cave Kay took a diamond not knowing it could break the curse. While in the shaft Miguel and Kay found the box used it and destroyed the pendant on Charity. Tabitha's scheme to destroy Charity once again failed. Kay, still hating Charity for taking Miguel away from her, was still planning on how to get Charity away from Miguel. Kay then made a deal with the evil witch Hecuba and sold her soul. At one stage Kay disguised herself, as Charity when Hecuba cast a spell making her look like Charity, to make love to Miguel but was interrupted when the real Charity showed up. When the real Charity showed up they were both in bed together. They were about to make love but Tabitha and Timmy stopped them since they knew that if they made love Charity would come into her full powers. Shortly before Christmas Hecuba came and took Kay's soul. Kay now had no choice but to do everything that Hecuba told her. She got a strand of Charity's hair and nail clippings only to cause Hecuba to make ravens attack the Bennett house. She then afterwards made blood drip from the walls and then tried trap Charity in hell. At first Hecuba failed in putting Charity in hell due to Miguel interfering. But however she succeeded the second time when Miguel left Charity and Kay alone. At first Kay did not tell anyone where Charity was due to Hecuba threatening not to give her soul back however when Hecuba tried to kill Miguel, Kay realized that Hecuba only used her to destroy Charity. After that Kay then decided to tell everyone that Charity was in hell. After Miguel found out about her he jumped into hell to rescue her. Father Lonigan, Reese and everyone else tried to find a way to save them but were constantly stopped by Hecuba. They threw a ladder of Lucifer into hell but Miguel got knocked out and Hecuba cut the rope trapping Charity in hell. Miguel then tried to rescue Charity by trying to destroy Hecuba but failed when they closed the box not fully destroying Hecuba. This made Tabitha and Timmy trick Hecuba and trap her in a bottle. Miguel, still trying to think of a way jumped into hell once again. Kay also jumped in only for all of them to realize that they were being dragged to the 10th level of hell. Timmy however having a big crush on Charity wanted to save Charity when evil was starting to destroy the Bennett house. He found out from Tabitha that a demons claw could save Charity. The little angel girl seeing Timmy's good nature approached him telling him to use it. Timmy then used it resulting in the demons in hell being destroyed and the Bennett house getting sucked in to hell. Tabitha, Timmy, Charity, Miguel and Kay all survived. Hecuba's scheme to get rid of Charity failed just like Tabitha's. Trip to Warlock Island and the return of prominent visions(2001) With Grace and Sam's house in ruins, Charity, Grace and Jessica stayed over at Tabitha's house and Kay stayed with Miguel. Charity afterwards was trying to remember what happened and she started to. She also started feeling that Kay didn't have a soul. She prayed for Kay's soul to return and Kay got her soul back when Timmy heard Charity's prayer. Shortly afterwards Kay decided she wanted to be good. Miguel was planning their high school trip and came across warlock island. As they went, Tabitha and Timmy followed them escaping from an axe murderer named Norma who wanted to kill them. After entering warlock island Tabitha feared for her life that the warlocks would want her since she trapped them on the island. While there Charity had a vision that the boat that Luis and Sheridan were on was about to explode and that Theresa was about to do something that she would later regret. They couldn't tell them since the boat they had was destroyed by Norma who tried to kill Tabitha and Timmy. Also while there, the warlocks called Charity to tell her about Tabitha she at first was confused but then thought it was a dream. Miguel, Kay, Simone and Reese went looking for her in the cave. When she was found the warlocks demanded that they wanted someone dead in order for them to come out of the cave. The warlocks took Tabitha, the one they wanted and then they came out only to realize that a freaky hurricane had started. Miguel, Kay, Reese and Simone were washed away by the heavy storm. Charity then saw a tree talking to her telling her to use her powers to save her drowning friends. The tree also warned that she might loose Miguel if she does save them. She used her powers which not only saved her friends but all the Townsville folks of Harmony. Zombie Charity(2001-2002) When returning from warlock island Charity tried to remember the deal she made. She and Grace started realizing that they might have special powers. They then said a prayer which resulted in the resurrection of Sheridan Crane who was dead from the boat explosion. Charity and the others then heard bad news that Grace and Sam were not legally married. This angered Kay who reverted to her former self. Tabitha knowing this used it to her advantage and then kept a book of spells which Kay found and used a spell to trap Charity in a block of ice. Kay then created a zombie Charity who was in fact a succubus sent from the dark forces in Tabitha's basement. The dark forces also gave zombie Charity Tabitha's powers. After zombie Charity was created she started to do what Kay told her to do. At times, Charity would, at Kay's telling, flirt with other boys, try and lose her temper and always find a way to hurt Miguel. After a while Kay started to realize that zombie Charity had an agenda of her own and that she wanted to do what she wanted to do. Kay, at one point, found out from Reese that Someone-after sleeping with a succubus- dies. Kay started to discover that zombie Charity wanted Miguel dead. Kay started regretting what she did and wanted to get rid of zombie Charity. Meanwhile, Tabitha's real life doll Timmy found out that the real Charity can be saved when a device called the Demon's horn is used. Timmy left in search for the demon's horn. Zombie Charity then saw Timmy as a threat and proceeded to try and get rid of him. Meanwhile, Kay time after time failed in getting rid of zombie Charity. She used the book of spells to try and destroy Zombie Charity but failed when Zombie Charity stopped Kay. She followed zombie Charity to Miguel's house where they were about to make love. She started a fire which burnt and destroyed the entire Lopez-Fitzgerald home. At another stage Kay prayed and asked the angels to destroy her but however Miguel came in and they disappeared. At Another stage they were at a grave yard and zombie Charity tried to make love and kill Miguel but Kay used holy water and stopped her. After Charity's 18 birthday they went to the hotel and stayed but Kay once again stopped them. Zombie Charity also transformed herself into Julian Crane when Theresa tried to end her life convincing Theresa she saw Julian in hell. She made Theresa make a deal to get Ethan. When Timmy escaped and ran away in search of the demon's horn, zombie Charity, at times, would send assassins to try and kill Timmy. She sent the bird of mordred to find out where Timmy was but before it could tell zombie Charity anything Tabitha killed it. She discovered where Timmy was through a crystal ball. She cast the spell of beldacrusta which made animals appear. She however failed since Timmy escaped. She also sent a scarecrow and an iron man but Timmy was saved by Julian, who fled Harmony cause of everyone trying to kill him. She also sent a snake but this time however Timmy was saved by Tabitha. Timmy then returned to Harmony. By that time zombie Charity stole the good essence of the real Charity and tried to use it but by the time she could zombie Charity started to realize that the real Charity was starting to thaw. Kay then used the essence making her look like Charity then seducing Miguel. Meanwhile, zombie Charity ran over to the cave, where she was confronted by the real Charity. Timmy also started to use the Demon's horn. Zombie Charity and real Charity got into a scuffle and Timmy got struck by zombie Charity gravely injuring him. The real Charity woke up and used the horn destroying zombie Charity. Timmy and Charity were rushed to the hospital. In the hospital doctors discovered Timmy was too gravely injured and couldn't make it, He died shortly after. Charity also died resulting in Tabitha getting her full powers. When she received her powers she realized that she signed a form that gave permission to donate Timmy's heart to Charity. At first, when learning this, she tried to put a stop to it but Timmy came and convinced Tabitha not to do so and Tabitha stopped, and Charity survived. After Charity survived, Tabitha's plans towards getting rid of Charity had subsided due to Timmy's heart being in Charity. Failed Wedding, Family Drama(2002-2003) After that Charity and Miguel had plans to get married. On their wedding day tragedy struck when Kay found out she was pregnant with Miguel's baby. Charity was upset and called the wedding off. Charity and Miguel were finding it hard to get back together. During that time Kay and Grace were having fights due to Kay accusing her of taking Charity's side all the time. Kay moved out moving in with Tabitha and working with the dark forces once again. Whilst Kay was living with Tabitha, she tried to use a love potion Tabitha gave her. She went to the cinema where she was with Charity, Miguel, Jessica and Reese. She mixed the love potion in the popcorn which she wanted to give to Miguel but however Reese ended up eating it resulting in Charity and Miguel getting back together and Reese breaking up with Jessica. Shortly afterwards when Sheridan was kidnapped by Beth Wallace's accomplice, Charlie, who was actually Alistair Crane in disguise, Charity had visions that Sheridan was kidnapped and tried to make Beth tell everyone but Beth denied it and no one believed Charity. Deal with Death and Departure from Harmony(2003-2004) Few months later Kay's baby was born. When Kay's baby was born, Charity saw death coming to take the baby. Death told her that if she prays the baby will survive since she has powers of goodness. Charity was confused but eventually prayed and saved the baby's life. Death told Charity that if the baby survives she has to stay away from Miguel. But Charity continued being near Miguel. A Few months later Charity had another vision of Sheridan being drowned in water. She told everyone and when Luis went to save her Death came back to take Luis and Sheridan but Charity once again saved them. After that Death wanted to take Miguel's baby again. This time Charity stayed away from Miguel by flirting with other guys and nearly end up sleeping with Reese Durkee when Tabitha's Daughter Endora cast a spell on them. Charity's behavior changed as a result of the spell. She began to lose her inhibitions by dancing in her underwear. But however despite all of it Charity still had feelings for Miguel. Then when Kay and Tabitha were unable to separate them, Endora created an evil Faith and made Charity go to Castletown where her house burnt down in 1999. After that Tabitha cast a spell that turned Kay into a rabid dog to attack Charity. Kay, transformed into a dog, went after Charity trying to kill her, but the spirit of good Faith appeared and gave Miguel a sign where Charity was and Miguel took a spear and speared Kay resulting in Kay receiving an infection which left her unable to have more children. Miguel and Charity were still unable to break up. Charity had a suggestion of leaving town. Tabitha, hearing this, showed Charity all the evil brought to Harmony from the time she came. Charity seeing all the pain she caused decided to leave Harmony. Miguel went after her and left Harmony, but returned in March 2006, after ending his search for Charity. Brief Return to Harmony and Faux Charity (2006-2007) In November 2006, Fox Crane, Kay's fianc√© at the time, tried to contact her to bring her back to Harmony but failed. Miguel, however, phoned her and asked her to come back, but she refused saying that she suffered a great deal in Harmony and had found happiness elsewhere. Shortly after Fox failed to contact Charity, he resorted to hiring an out-of-work actress, disguising her as Charity, and bringing her to Harmony to try and break up Miguel and Kay. Kay saw Charity and Miguel making love. When Tabitha heard this, she wondered why she and the dark forces weren't destroyed. She then found out that a fake Charity was wandering Harmony. The real Charity, however, returned in January after hearing about the death of her aunt Grace. After the funeral, Charity left Harmony again. The real Charity and Miguel never made love. If they did, their combined forces of good would destroy the all evil in Harmony, including Tabitha and Endora. When Jessica Bennett left her abusive husband Spike Lester, she went and stayed with Charity to have her baby. In the series finale, it was mentioned that she was staying in the Bahamas and was said to be living as a nun. Supernatural Incidents All the women of the Standish family by blood have supernatural powers; out of all the standish descendants Charity Standish is seemingly the most powerful Standish descendant prophesied to be born with extreme powers of goodness. Some standish women have the power to see visions of the past, the present and the future, while others have an affinity for witchcraft, but none of the Standish descendants' powers are seemingly as potent as Charity's. Charity's first experience with the supernatural came at the Harmony carnival when she went into the fortune telling tent. Upon returning to Castleton, Charity was rinsing her face when Tabitha reached into her magic bowl and tried to drag her through to Tabitha's living room, but luckily, Charity managed to escape. Charity's powers lay fairly dormant for some time, until Kay begin plotting against her, and bringing the bird statue near her. This prompted psychic visions for Charity, in which she saw Julian and Eve making love. Eve had her committed to the psychiatric ward, and Kay continued to bring the bird statue near her, keeping Charity's visions coming and keeping her locked up. After her release, Charity's powers were quiet for a long time; however, being possessed by a pendant, she used her powers for evil. She did occasionally get twinges that evil was after her (particularly when Kay was around) and saw Kay once in her true demon form, since Kay sold her soul to the evil witch Hecuba. She spent time burning in the fires of hell because of Kay and Hecuba, but escaped and survived. Also whilst on Warlock Island she had a vision of a boat, which Luis and Sheridan were in, that exploded. She also spent almost a year frozen in a block of ice, but eventually the ice melted, due to Timmy finding the demon's horn, which Charity then used to defeat the Zombie Charity that had taken her place. Before Sheridan was kidnapped Charity had visions that she was in trouble, and also knew that Beth was somehow behind it, but she couldn't prove it. She also had visions of Sheridan being drowned in water which Beth had thrown her in. Charity has never come into her full powers, as they will only take effect when she makes love to her soulmate, Miguel Lopez-Fitzgerald. Charity's powers have primarily manifested themselves as premonitions, which at times come true. Look Alikes Charity was plagued by Tabitha and due to evil spells caused by her, Kay, and Hecuba at different points in time Charity's likeness was used by one or the other into creating a doppelg√§nger of herself. An entity created by Kay known as Zombie Charity plagued Harmony for several months in 2002 later revealing it was a succubus, and later returning as a ghost. Kay even used Charity's essence to disguise herself as Charity in order to make love her boyfriend Miguel. At one point, Fox hired a lookalike to impersonate Charity as well using a mask, but the ruse eventually fell apart.

Helothermine inhibits ryanodine receptors, calcium channels and potassium channels. Helothermine can cause lethargy, partial paralysis of rear limbs and lowering of the body temperature. Etymology The name of the toxin helothermine is derived from its source, a Heloderma lizard, and one of its effects in mice, induction of hypothermia. Sources Helothermine is a toxin found in the venom (salivary secretion) of the Mexican beaded lizard Heloderma horridum horridum, one of the four subspecies of the beaded lizard. Besides helothermine the venom of the Mexican beaded lizard also contains at least three other toxins and several enzymes. Chemistry The peptide HLTx consists of 242 amino acids residues in a single polypeptide chain. It is stabilized with eight disulfide bridges and has a molecular weight of 25.5 kDa. The iso-electric point is 6.8 and the N-terminal amino acid sequence is: Glu-Ala-Ser-Pro-Lys-Leu-Pro-Gly-Leu-Met- Thr-Ser-Asn-Pro-Asp-Gln-Gln-Thr- Glu-Ile. HLTx shows no structural similarities with any of the known sodium-, potassium- or calcium channel- specific toxins. Highest similarities are found with a family of cysteine-rich secretory proteins (CRISP), found in human and in mice testes. Target and mode of action HLTx inhibits ryanodine receptors of sarcoplasmatisch reticulum and both calcium channels and potassium channels. Calcium channels The effects of HLTx on voltage-dependent calcium channels have been tested in granule cells of the cerebellum. In these cells, HLTx inhibits up to 67% of the calcium currents, acting on multiple subtypes. This inhibition is reversible, concentration-dependent and practically voltage- independent. No effects on the activation and inactivation kinetics were observed. A small shift in the steady-state inactivation curve has been reported. IC50 is 0.25 ŒºM. Potassium Channels HLTx inhibits both delayed rectifier and A-type potassium channels in cerebellar granular cells. HLTx reduces the A-type current in a voltage and concentration-dependent way, with an IC50 of 0.52 ŒºM. It slows down both the activation and the inactivation kinetics of the A-type current. The block of the delayed-rectifier current is not voltage-dependent, but only concentration-dependent, with an IC50 of 0.83 ŒºM. Ryanodine receptor The ryanodine receptor, both in skeletal and in cardiac sarcoplasmatic reticulum (SR), is inhibited by HLTx. The affinity of the toxin is much higher for the skeletal- than for the cardiac SR receptors, but binding is reversible in both cases. Toxicity The main effect of HTLx seems to be the induction of hypothermia. Other effects are lethargy, intestinal distension/diarrhea and paralysis of the rear limbs. Sporadic tonic convulsions can occur when the intoxicated animals are touched on the dorsal parts of their body. The specific toxins of the Mexican beaded lizard are probably evolved to immobilize preys, as these lizards move very slowly themselves. References J. Mochca-Morales, B.M. Martin, L.D.

He was the first democratically elected mayor of Arles. Although he came from an aristocratic family, he was a strong supporter of the French Revolution, initially in the south of France, particularly Arles and Provence, and ultimately in Paris. Called the single most influential figure of the French Revolution in Arles, Antonelle was heavily involved in the reunion of the Comtat Venaissin with France and was one of the leading figures in Gracchus Babeuf's Conspiracy of the Equals. Biography=Early years Antonelle was born to a wealthy aristocratic family in Arles. Antonelle's father died in December 1747, and therefore Antonelle was largely raised by his mother and the archbishop of Angoul√™me. The strict education he received from the archbishop is cited as one of the primary factors behind his later anticlericalism. In 1762, Antonelle served as a cadet in the Arm√©e, eventually reaching the rank of lieutenant and commanding his own regiment. He had little taste for army life, resigning in 1782. Revolutionary period Antonelle, heavily inspired by the Age of Enlightenment was an early supporter of the French Revolution.Adolphe Robert, Gaston Cougny, Dictionnaire des parlementaires fran√ßais de 1789 √† 1889, Paris, Bourloton, 1889, tome 1, pp. 77-78 He was the leader of the Monnaidiers, the Arlesien partisans of the Revolution. He was the first elected mayor of Arles and as mayor adopted a series of anticlerical policies, including the expulsion of non-juring priests. While still mayor of Arles, Antonelle was sent to Avignon to facilitate the reunion of the Comtat Venaissin with France. Afterwards, Antonelle was sent to Marseille with orders to restore public order. Beginning in June 1791, Antonelle was forced to flee Arles for Aix-en-Provence, when public opinion turned against the revolution. In August 1791, Antonelle was elected deputy of Bouches-du-Rh√¥ne to the Assembl√©e nationale l√©gislative, and soon became secretary to the body. He was sent to the Arm√©e du Nord with orders to arrest the general La Fayette, but was detained in M√©zi√®res while La Fayette escaped. After returning to Paris, Antonelle became president of the Jacobin Club and became a member of the Revolutionary Tribunal. He refused to strongly condemn the Girondists, a move which was regarded with suspicion by Antonelle's Jacobin allies, and Antonelle was imprisoned until the Thermidorian reaction. Shortly after being freed from prison, Antonelle sided with the National Convention during the insurrection of 13 Vend√©miaire. After this, Antonelle largely retired from active political service to publish works on the theory behind the Revolution and on human rights. In November 1795, he became the editor in chief of Bulletin politique, the official journal of the Directory. Antonelle was fired from the position after only ten days, and he moved on to become one of the principal contributors to the Journal des hommes libres. In 1796, Antonelle was named one of the secret directors of the Conspiracy of Equals, but was acquitted, possibly due to the influence of Barras. Alongside Barras, Antonelle then founded the journal D√©mocrate constitutionnel. He supported the Coup of 18 Fructidor, but was nearly imprisoned again when Merlin de Thionville attempted to have Antonelle deported as an aristocrat. He was elected deputy of the Bouches-du-Rh√¥ne, but the election was declared invalid the next day. Frustrated, Antonelle began to publish anti-government polemics and co-founded the Club du Man√®ge. Shortly before Napol√©on's coup d'√©tat, Antonelle was elected to the Council of 500, but the election was again annulled. One week later, Antonelle was exiled to Charente-Inf√©rieure. Later life After being exiled, Antonelle was regarded as a dangerous anarchist agitator and repeatedly denounced during the First French Empire. As a result, he allied himself with Louis XVIII during the Bourbon Restoration, publishing a pamphlet titled Reveil d'un vieillard which advocated a constitutional monarchy. After spending some time in Italy, he retired to Arles where he inherited a large estate. Still popular in Arles, he became well known for his fair treatment of the farmers who worked his lands. Crowds greeted his public funeral ceremony in 1817, which was boycotted by local clergy due to his strong anticlericalism.

As of Q4 2013, there are 1 230 000 customers with Mobile TV, or over 15.8% of Bell's mobile customer base. History=2000s: Early versions Early versions of Bell Mobile TV used the slower CDMA network. 2010s: new HSPA+ version and tablet support The Bell Mobile TV was launched for Bell smartphones on October 18, 2010. Support for tablet computer and Virgin Mobile Canada customers was later added. 2015s: Version 5.0 Version 5.0 was launched on Android devices in December 2014 and on iOS in January 2015. The new app introduced new usage metering to allow users to track their viewing time. The application added support for the newer operating systems such as iOS 8 and Lollipop. The video on demand section of the app had an overhaul to allow better navigation of content. Crave TV content was included as a section of Bell Satellite TV app. Hardware Early iterations of Bell Mobile TV only supported CDMA handsets with the Evolution- Data Optimized (EV-DO) technology. In the 2010s, support for these older devices was discontinued in favor of faster HSPA+ handsets and technology. Devices capable of Bell Mobile TV include iOS hardware such as the iPhone and iPad, but not the iPod Touch or the Apple TV. Newer Android and BlackBerry handsets and tablets sold by Bell or Virgin Services=Mobile TV Service plans for Mobile TV cost $5 per month and include 5 hours (formerly 10) of access to all live and on demand channels, with additional hours costing $3 each. If any hours are unused, they cannot be rolled over to the next month. As of April 29, 2015, Bell Mobile TV usage is counted as part of subscribers' overall mobile data usage. As compensation, subscribers will also receive 5 hours of Mobile TV access over Wi-Fi. Channels Bell divides its Mobile TV channels into several themes. Although each previously incurred separate charges, Bell's current rates include access to all channels without having to choose specific themes: * HBO: Curb Your Enthusiasm, Entourage, Sex and the City and True Blood * Sports: TSN, TSN2, RDS, RDS2, NFL, NFL Network, NFL RedZone, Vancouver Whitecaps FC and CBN * English entertainment: CBC, CTV, CTV Two, Juicebox, MTV, Treehouse TV, YTV, Comedy Time, bpm:tv, B4U Music, Comedy, Aux and Bite TV * French entertainment: Radio-Canada, TVA and V * News: BNN, CBC News Network, CTV News Channel, NDTV 24x7 Channels and programming in italics are On Demand. These channels are also available Live, with the exception of Aux, Bite, Comedy, and all HBO offerings.  Criticism  In 2011, the CRTC ruled in a complaint by Telus that Bell could not use the Mobile TV service to tie exclusive mobile rights to television content (specifically, NHL and NFL games) to its own services without offering them to competing providers. In December 2013, the CRTC received a complaint alleging that Bell's original pricing structure for Mobile TV was a violation of the undue preference rules in the Telecommunications Act; as the service charged by hours viewed, counting separately from overall mobile data use, it was considered to be an effective subsidy on Bell-owned content transmitted over the mobile network that does not apply to any other competing video services. On January 29, 2015, the CRTC ruled that Bell had violated the undue preference rules with its mobile TV offerings, and ordered the company to change its pricing structure by April 29, 2015. Effective April 29, 2015, Bell Mobile TV usage counts towards subscribers' overall data usage.

The particular cartoon cited in 1928, \\"May His Shadow Never Grow Less\\", was a tribute drawn at the end of the 1927 calendar year to flier Charles Lindbergh. The Christmas-themed cartoon was published at the very end of 1927 and was eligible for Pulitzer consideration in 1928. Harding was born in New York City. His work was often politically conservative by the standards of his day. He took a leading role in opposition to what some New Yorkers considered to be a threat from Bolshevism in the late 1910s, during the so-called First Red Scare. His cartoons portrayed political radicals as bomb-throwers and terrorists.

Aborted film version In 1954, Marilyn Monroe was placed on suspension from 20th Century-Fox after refusing to accept the lead role in a film version of The Girl in Pink Tights. During her suspension, she married baseball star Joe DiMaggio and the two honeymooned in Japan, during which she took time to entertain soldiers in Korea. Fox had intended on casting Sheree North in The Girl in Pink Tights, even testing her in Monroe's own studio wardrobe.
