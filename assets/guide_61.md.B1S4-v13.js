Being antiracist is based on the conscious efforts and actions to provide equitable opportunities for all people on an individual and systemic level. People can act against racism by acknowledging personal privileges, confronting acts of racial discrimination, and working to change personal racial biases. European origins European racism spread to the Americas alongside the Europeans, but establishment views were questioned when applied to indigenous peoples. After the discovery of the New World, many of the clergy sent to the New World who were educated in the new humane values of the Renaissance, still new in Europe and not ratified by the Vatican, began to criticize Spain and their own Church's treatment and views of indigenous peoples and slaves. In December 1511, Antonio de Montesinos, a Dominican friar, was the first European to rebuke openly the Spanish authorities and administrators of Hispaniola for their \\"cruelty and tyranny\\" in dealing with the American natives and those forced to labor as slaves. King Ferdinand enacted the Laws of Burgos and Valladolid in response. However enforcement was lax, and the New Laws of 1542 have to be made to take a stronger line. Because some people like Fray Bartolomé de las Casas questioned not only the Crown but the Papacy at the Valladolid Controversy whether the Indians were truly men who deserved baptism, Pope Paul III in the papal bull Veritas Ipsa or Sublimis Deus (1537) confirmed that the Indians and other races were deserving men, so long as they became baptized. Afterward, their Christian conversion effort gained momentum along social rights, while leaving the same status recognition unanswered for Africans of Black Race, and legal social racism prevailed towards the Indians or Asians. However, by then the last schism of the Reformation had taken place in Europe in those few decades along political lines, and the different views on the value of human lives of different races were not corrected in the lands of Northern Europe, which would join the Colonial race at the end of the century and over the next, as the Portuguese and Spanish Empires waned. It would take another century, with the influence of the French Empire at its height, and its consequent Enlightenment developed at the highest circles of its Court, to return these previously inconclusive issues to the forefront of the political discourse championed by many intellectual men since Rousseau. These issues gradually permeated to the lower social levels, where they were a reality lived by men and women of different races from the European racial majority.  Quaker initiatives  John Brown's blessing In 1688, with the \\"Germantown Petition Against Slavery,\\" German immigrants created the first American document of its kind that made a plea for equal human rights for everyone. Ultimately set aside and forgotten, re- discovered by the US abolitionist movement again in 1844, misplaced around the 1940s, and once more re-discovered in March 2005.https://www.historyofinformation.com/detail.php?id=3701&fbclid;=IwAR2Xm4Om5QG7QCoY4QyJMkr2iNJOKRil8xX68ZXrkupdmYEj9w8xuS2dkU0 Prior to the American Revolution, a small group of Quakers including John Woolman and Anthony Benezet successfully persuaded their fellow members of the Religious Society of Friends to free their slaves, divest from the slave trade, and create unified Quaker policies against slavery. This afforded their tiny religious denomination some moral authority to help begin the Abolitionist movement on both sides of the Atlantic. Woolman died of smallpox in England in 1775, shortly after crossing the Atlantic to bring his anti- slavery message to the Quakers of the British Isles. During and after the American Revolution, Quaker ministrations and preachings against slavery began to spread beyond their movement. In 1783, 300 Quakers, chiefly from the London area, presented the British Parliament with their signatures on the first petition against the slave trade. In 1785, Englishman Thomas Clarkson, enrolled at Cambridge, and in the course of writing an essay in Latin (Anne liceat invitos in servitutem dare (Is it lawful to enslave the unconsenting?), read the works of Benezet, and began a lifelong effort to outlaw the slave trade in England. In 1787, sympathizers formed the Committee for the Abolition of the Slave Trade, a small non-denominational group that could lobby more successfully by incorporating Anglicans, who, unlike the Quakers, could lawfully sit in Parliament. The twelve founding members included nine Quakers, and three pioneering Anglicans: Granville Sharp, Thomas Clarkson, and William Wilberforce – all evangelical Christians. Later successes Later successes in opposing racism were won by the abolitionist movement, both in England and the United States. Though many Abolitionists did not regard blacks or mulattos as equal to whites, they did, in general, believe in freedom and often even equality of treatment for all people. A few, like John Brown, went further. Brown was willing to die on behalf of, as he said, \\"millions in this slave country whose rights are disregarded by wicked, cruel, and unjust enactments ...\\" Many black Abolitionists, such as Frederick Douglass, explicitly argued for the humanity of blacks and mulattoes, and the equality of all people. Prior to and during the American Civil War, racial egalitarianism in the North became much stronger and more generally disseminated. The success of black troops in the Union Army had a dramatic impact on Northern sentiment. The Emancipation Proclamation was a notable example of this shift in political attitudes, although it notably did not completely extinguish legal slavery in several states. After the war, the Reconstruction government passed the Fourteenth Amendment and Fifteenth Amendments to the Constitution to guarantee the rights of blacks and mulattoes. Many ex-slaves had access to education for the first time. Blacks and mulattoes were also allowed to vote, which meant that African-Americans were elected to Congress in numbers not equaled until the Voting Rights Act and the Warren Court helped re-enfranchise black Americans. Due to resistance in the South, however, and a general collapse of idealism in the North, Reconstruction ended, and gave way to the nadir of American race relations. The period from about 1890 to 1920 saw the re-establishment of Jim Crow laws. President Woodrow Wilson, who regarded Reconstruction as a disaster, segregated the federal government. The Ku Klux Klan grew to its greatest peak of popularity and strength. D. W. Griffith's The Birth of a Nation was a movie sensation. In 1911 the First Universal Races Congress met in London, at which distinguished speakers from many countries for four days discussed race problems and ways to improve interracial relations. Scientific anti-racism Friedrich Tiedemann was one of the first people to scientifically contest racism. In 1836, using craniometric and brain measurements (taken by him from Europeans and black people from different parts of the world), he refuted the belief of many contemporary naturalists and anatomists that black people have smaller brains and are thus intellectually inferior to white people, saying it was scientifically unfounded and based merely on the prejudiced opinions of travelers and explorers. The evolutionary biologist Charles Darwin wrote in 1871 that ‘[i]t may be doubted whether any character can be named which is distinctive of a race and is constant’ and that ‘[a]lthough the existing races of man differ in many respects, as in colour, hair, shape of skull, proportions of the body, &c.;, yet if their whole structure be taken into consideration they are found to resemble each other closely in a multitude of points.’ At the start of the 20th century, the work of anthropologists trying to end the paradigms of cultural evolutionism and social Darwinism within social sciences—anthropologists like Franz Boas, Marcel Mauss, Bronisław Malinowski, Pierre Clastres and Claude Lévi-Strauss—began the initiative to the end of racism in human sciences and establish cultural relativism as the new dominant paradigm. Racial equality: Paris 1919 After the end of seclusion in the 1850s, Japan signed unequal treaties, the so-called Ansei Treaties, but soon came to demand equal status with the Western powers. Correcting that inequality became the most urgent international issue of the Meiji government. In that context, the Japanese delegation to the Paris peace conference proposed the clause in the Covenant of the League of Nations. The first draft was presented to the League of Nations Commission on 13 February as an amendment to Article 21: > The equality of nations being a basic principle of the League of Nations, > the High Contracting Parties agree to accord as soon as possible to all > alien nationals of states, members of the League, equal and just treatment > in every respect making no distinction, either in law or in fact, on account > of their race or nationality. After Makino's speech, Lord Cecil stated that the Japanese proposal was a very controversial one and he suggested that perhaps the matter was so controversial that it should not be discussed at all. Greek Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos also suggested that a clause banning religious discrimination should also be removed since that was also a very controversial matter. That led to objections from a Portuguese diplomat, who stated that his country had never signed a treaty before that did not mention God, which caused Cecil to remark perhaps this time, they would all just have to a take a chance of avoiding the wrath of the Almighty by not mentioning Him. Australian Prime Minister Billy Hughes clarified his opposition and announced at a meeting that \\"ninety-five out of one hundred Australians rejected the very idea of equality. Hughes had entered politics as a trade unionist and, like most others in the working class, was very strongly opposed to Asian immigration to Australia. (The exclusion of Asian immigration was a popular cause with unions in Canada, the US, Australia, and New Zealand in the early 20th century.) The Chinese delegation, which was otherwise at daggers drawn with the Japanese over the question of the former German colony of Tsingtao and the rest of the German concessions in Shandong Province, also said that it would support the clause. However, one Chinese diplomat said at the time that the Shandong question was far more important to his government than the clause. British Prime Minister David Lloyd George found himself in an awkward situation since Britain had signed an alliance with Japan in 1902, but he also wanted to hold the British Empire's delegation together. Although the proposal received a majority (11 out of 16) of votes, the chairman, the proposal was still problematic for the segregationist US President Woodrow Wilson, who needed the votes of segregationist Southern Democrats to succeed in getting the votes needed for the US Senate to ratify the treaty. Strong opposition from the British Empire delegations gave him a pretext to reject the proposal. Billy Hughes and Joseph Cook vigorously opposed it as it undermined the White Australia policy. Revival in the United States Opposition to racism revived in the 1920s and 1930s. At that time, anthropologists such as Franz Boas, Ruth Benedict, Margaret Mead, and Ashley Montagu argued for the equality of humans across races and cultures. Eleanor Roosevelt was a very visible advocate for minority rights during this period. Anti-capitalist organizations like the Industrial Workers of the World, which gained popularity during 1905–1926, were explicitly egalitarian. In the 1940s Springfield, Massachusetts invoked The Springfield Plan to include all persons in the community. Beginning with the Harlem Renaissance and continuing into the 1960s, many African-American writers argued forcefully against racism. During the Civil Rights Movement, Jim Crow laws were repealed in the South and blacks finally re-won the right to vote in Southern states. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was an influential force, and his \\"I Have a Dream\\" speech is an exemplary condensation of his egalitarian ideology.  Antiracism Intervention Strategies  When people of color experience racial Microaggressions, it causes harm to their mental and physical health which can lead to many negative consequences in a work environment, learning environment, and to their overall sense of self-worth. Antiracism work combats microaggressions and helps to break systemic racism by focusing on actions against discrimination and oppression. Standing up against discrimination can be an overwhelming task for people of color who have been previously targeted. White allies and bystanders are people who can help victims of racial discrimination. Antiracist microinterventions can be a tool used to act against racial discrimination. Microintervention strategies provide the tools needed to confront and educate racial oppressors. Specific tactics include: revealing the hidden biases or agendas behind acts of discrimination, interrupting and challenging oppressive language, educating offenders, and connecting with other allies and community members are ways to act against discrimination. Using these microinterventions allows the oppressor to see the impact of their words and provides a space for an educational dialogue about how their actions can oppress people of color and marginalized groups. Microagressions can be conscious acts where the perpetrator is aware of their racist actions or microagressions can be hidden and metacommunicated without the perpetrator's awareness. Regardless of whether microagressions are conscious or unconscious behaviors, the first antiracist intervention is to name the ways it is harmful for a person of color. Calling out an act of discrimination can be empowering because it provides language for people of color to bring awareness to their lived experiences and justifies internal feelings of discrimination. Antiracist strategies also include confronting the racial microaggression by outwardly challenging and disagreeing against the microaggression that harms a person of color. Microinterventions such as a verbal expression of \\"I don't want to hear that talk\\" and physical movements of disapproval are ways to confront microaggressions. Microinterventions aren't used to attack others about their biases, but instead they are used to allow the space for an educational dialogue. Educating a perpetrator on their biases can open up a discussion about how the intention of a comment or action can have a damaging impact. For example, phrases such as \\"I know you meant that joke to be funny, but that stereotype really hurt me\\" can educate a person on the difference between what was intended and how it is harmful to a person of color. Antiracist microintervention strategies give the tools for people of color, white allies, and bystanders to combat against microaggressions and acts of discrimination. Influence Crowd rallying at a demonstration in Israel against manifestations of racism and discrimination. Egalitarianism has been a catalyst for feminist, anti-war, and anti- imperialist movements. Henry David Thoreau's opposition to the Mexican–American War, for example, was based in part on his fear that the U.S. was using the war as an excuse to expand American slavery into new territories. Thoreau's response was chronicled in his famous essay \\"Civil Disobedience\\", which in turn helped ignite Gandhi's successful campaign against the British in India. Gandhi's example in turn inspired the American civil rights movement. As James Loewen notes in Lies My Teacher Told Me: \\"Throughout the world, from Africa to Northern Ireland, movements of oppressed people continue to use tactics and words borrowed from our abolitionist and civil rights movements.\\" In East Germany, revolutionary Iran, Tiananmen Square, and South Africa, images, words, and tactics developed by human rights supporters have been used regularly and repeatedly. Many of these uses have been controversial. In Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe has used anti-racist rhetoric to promote a land distribution scheme whereby privately held land is confiscated from white Rhodesians and distributed to blacks, which has resulted in widespread starvation (see Land reform in Zimbabwe). = White genocide conspiracy theory = The phrase \\"Anti-racist is a code word for anti-white\\", coined by high-profile white nationalist Robert Whitaker, is commonly associated with the topic of white genocide, a white nationalist conspiracy theory that mass immigration, integration, miscegenation, low fertility rates and abortion are being promoted in predominantly white countries to deliberately turn them minority-white and hence cause white people to become extinct through forced assimilation. The phrase has been spotted on billboards near Birmingham, Alabama and in Harrison, Arkansas.

It established the statutory body of the Electricity Commissioners ‘to promote, regulate and supervise the supply of electricity’ under the direction of the Board of Trade. It provided for the formation of electricity districts and, where necessary, the establishment of joint electricity authorities, ‘to provide or secure the provision of a cheap and abundant supply of electricity’.  Background  In 1917, the UK government was planning the reconstruction of the nation's industries after the First World War. The Board of Trade set up the Electric Power Supply Committee, chaired by Sir Archibald Williamson, which proposed the effective nationalisation of the industry. Subsequently, in 1919 under the chairmanship of Sir Henry Birchenough, the Advisory Council to the Ministry of Reconstruction produced the Report of the Committee of ChairmenViscount Haldane, Sir Archibald Williamson and Sir Charles Parsons on Electric Power Supply. The committee were asked to submit general comments or suggestions on the broad administrative and commercial issues which had arisen out of the Williamson Report. The Birchenough Committee generally agreed with the Williamson Report but recommended that generation and transmission should be a single unified system with state regulation and finance and that means should be found for including distribution as well. This recommendation was very far- sighted but considered too ambitious by the government. If acted upon it would have anticipated the Electricity Act 1947 by 28 years. Parliament rejected what would have been the effective nationalisation of the industry but enacted two of the committee's recommendations in a weaker form, including the setting up of the Electricity Commissioners and a number of joint electricity authorities formed by the electricity suppliers in each area. The Electricity (Supply) Act 1919, was based essentially on the Williamson and Birchenough reports and introduced central co-ordination by establishing the Electricity Commissioners, an official body responsible for securing reorganisation on a regional basis.  The Electricity (Supply) Act 1919  The Electricity (Supply) Act 1919 received Royal Assent on 23 December 1919. Its long title is: ’An Act to amend the Law with respect to the supply of electricity’. = Provisions = The provisions of the Act were as follows.Electricity (Supply) Act 1919 Electricity Commissioners To established a body called the Electricity Commissioners to promote, regulate and supervise the supply of electricity (section 1 (1)).

Joint electricity authorities  Four joint electricity authorities were established after the Electricity (Supply) Act 1922 had enabled then to borrow money to finance electricity schemes. = North Wales & South Cheshire Joint Electricity Authority = The North Wales and South Cheshire Joint Electricity Authority was formed in 1923. The principal electricity undertaking was North Wales Power Company which, under the supervision of the Joint Electricity Authority, controlled generation and transmission and supplied electricity to local undertakings in the area with the exception of Chester. Upon abolition in 1948 the joint electricity authority’s assets were transferred to the Merseyside & North Wales Electricity Board (MANWEB). = London and Home Counties Joint Electricity Authority = The London and Home Counties Joint Electricity Authority was established in 1925 to \\"provide or secure the provision of a cheap and abundant supply of electricity within the district\\". The district covered 1,841 square miles including the whole of the counties of London and Middlesex, and parts of Hertfordshire, Essex, Kent, Surrey, Buckinghamshire, and Berkshire. The population served by the authority in 1931 was 9,088,764. There were 83 authorised undertakers in the district comprising the JEA itself, 44 local authority and 38 companies. By 1932 the London JEA had acquired the following undertakings: Callender's (Surbiton), Edmundson's (Dorking), Leatherhead and District, South Metropolitan Tramways, Twickenham and Teddington, and Urban (Weybridge). Companies in the London area were required to notify the JEA of any proposal to spend any capital exceeding £5,000 on assets. The London JEA intended to build a large power station at Chiswick, however the Central Electricity Board rejected the scheme and instead proposed the expansion of Fulham power station which was nearer to the centre of load. The joint electricity authority’s headquarters in 1945 were at 5-6 Lancaster Place, Strand, London WC2.Trade Directory (1947) Upon abolition in 1948 the JEA’s assets were split between the South Eastern Electricity Board, the Eastern Electricity Board and the London Electricity Board. = West Midlands Joint Electricity Authority = The West Midlands Joint Electricity Authority was established in 1925 by the West Midlands Electricity District Order 1925 made under the Electricity (Supply) Act 1919. It covered an area of about 1,000 square miles, including much of Shropshire, Staffordshire and Worcestershire. The JEA included representatives of Midland Electricity Corporation; Wolverhampton, Walsall, West Bromwich, Cannock and Shrewsbury councils; colliery owners; railway companies; and electricity industry workers. In 1928 it acquired four power stations: Ocker Hill formerly operated by the Midland Electric Corporation for Power Distribution; the 30 MW Wolverhampton power station; the 28 MW Walsall Birchills power station; and the 6.65 MW West Bromwich station. The joint electricity authority built the 200 MW Ironbridge A power station (1932). The JEA’s stations were linked through a system operating at 33 kV. On 1 October 1938 the JEA took over Shrewsbury power station. The JEA’s principal office was at Phoenix Buildings, Dudley Road, Wolverhampton. Upon abolition in 1948 the JEA’s assets were transferred to the Midlands Electricity Board. = North West Midlands Joint Electricity Authority = The North West Midlands Joint Electricity Authority was established by the North West Midlands Electricity District Order 1928. It covered an area of 800 square miles of Staffordshire, Shropshire and Cheshire including Stoke-on-Trent. It acquired the Stoke-on-Trent and Stafford power stations on 1 April 1930. Thereafter Stoke Corporation and Stafford Corporation purchased electricity in bulk from the JEA. It was based in York Chambers, Kingsway, Stoke-on-Trent. The joint electricity authority built the 120 MW Meaford A power station first commissioned in 1947. Upon abolition in 1948 the JEA’s supply assets were transferred to the Midlands Electricity Board, with generating assets going to the British Electricity Authority.  Later enactments  The Electricity (Supply) Act 1922 (12 & 13 Geo. 5. c. 46). Enabled joint electricity authorities to borrow money to finance electricity schemes. The London Electricity (Nos. 1 & 2) Acts 1925 (14 & 15 Geo. 5) permitted the London and Home Counties Joint Electricity Authority to purchase company electricity undertakings in London area in 1971. The Electricity (Supply) Act 1926 (16 & 17 Geo. 5. c. 51), established the Central Electricity Board. The Electricity Act 1947 (10 & 11 Geo. 6, c. 54), nationalised the UK electricity supply industry. The Electricity Commissioners and the joint electricity authorities were abolished. The ownership of electricity generation and transmission facilities were vested in the British Electricity Authority, and electricity distribution and sales in local electricity boards. The 1919 Act and most other electricity-related British legislation were repealed and replaced by the Electricity Act 1989.

Three ETA members carrying pistols and submachine guns killed Unceta, the Government appointed President of the Provincial Deputation of Biscay and Mayor of Guernica. He was ambushed as he arrived to play his weekly sports game. His two bodyguards, Antonio Hernández Fernández-Segura and Ángel Rivera Navarrón were also killed in the attack, which was ETA's deadliest of 1977. The attack heralded an upsurge in the use of violence by ETA in subsequent years.  Background  The attack resembled the assassination of Juan María de Araluce Villar, the Government appointed President of the Provincial Deputation of Gipuzkoa, a year before. Following that attack, ETA had stated that they intended to kill all Franco-appointed heads of the delegations in the Basque Country. On 2 October 1977, ETA political-military, one of three ETA factions, had announced that it was abandoning the use of violence. On 5 October, the Anti-communist Apostolic Alliance (AAA), a far-right paramilitary group, had bombed the offices of Punto y Hora, a left wing Basque nationalist weekly publication and on 7 October, the day before the attack, they shot dead a taxi driver who they accused of having ETA links. Also on 7 October, the government had agreed a draft bill granting amnesty to political prisoners of the Franco government. The law was passed by parliament on 14 October 1977.  Target  Unceta had been born in Guernica on 5 December 1923. He had interests in local businesses and served as manager of Astra-Unceta y Cia SA, a large weapons manufacturing company founded by his father. He had been appointed vice-president of the delegation of Biscay by Franco in 1966 and later became President of the delegation. His last official act before his death was in September 1977, when he participated in a memorial service for Juan María de Araluce Villar. He had received letters from ETA, demanding that he pay their \\"revolutionary tax\\" but refused to do so. He had also received ETA death threats and, as a result, had been granted a bodyguard of two civil guards.  The attack  Unceta was fond of 'fronton', a Basque sport, which he played weekly at the Jai alai court. The attack occurred when he arrived at the court: as he was parking his car, three youths exited a nearby car and opened fire on him and his bodyguards with machine guns, shouting \\"Gora Euzkadi!\\" as they did so. He was hit several times in the head and chest and died at the scene of the attack. His bodyguards, who had been travelling in a car 20 metres behind him, were also killed. The attack, which was claimed later the same day by ETA-military, was ETA's deadliest of the year and the second deadliest attack in Spain that year following the AAA's killing of five left-wingers in the Atocha massacre in January.  Reactions  The killing of Unceta was criticised as an attempt to destabilise the ongoing process of compromise between the Spanish government and the opposition. In their claim of responsibility, ETA rejected this hypothesis, stating that, in their opinion, democracy had not been established in Spain and the country remained a military dictatorship. The assassination was condemned by all the main political parties on the left and right in Spain and the Spanish king and queen cancelled their attendance at a concert as a mark of respect. Unceta's funeral was attended by an estimated 5,000 people, including politicians from the governing Union of the Democratic Centre, the Basque Nationalist Party and the Basque Christian Democracy party. At the funeral, right wing activists belonging to New Force and the People's Alliance held an anti-government protest, calling for the government to resign, banging on the cars of politicians attending the funeral and surrounding and unsuccessfully attempting to overturn the car of Eduardo Navarro, the Deputy Interior Minister. A memorial plaque to Unceta was subsequently placed in the Bilbao Palace, however an attempt to place a plaque commemorating both Unceta and Araluce was voted out in 2010. In August 2008, a street in Socuéllamos, the home town of Ángel Rivera Navarrón, one of the civil guards killed in the attack, was renamed in his memory.  Subsequent police investigation  Following the attack, police cordoned off the area and increased police patrols on the Spanish-French border near Irun and on the mountainous highways in the Basque Country and Navarre. The car used by the attackers was found abandoned near the highway linking Guernica and Amorbieta, it had been stolen at gunpoint by three youths on the morning of the attack. Police retrieved parabellum and marietta shell casings from both the attackers' and the victim's cars. In December 1978, police arrested José Antonio Torre Altonaga (alias Medios), who named two ETA commanders, José Manuel Pagoaga Gallastegui (Peixoto), and Francisco Javier Aya Zulaica (Trepa), as participants in the attack. Trepa's father released a statement denying his son's involvement. In 1989, ETA member Martín Apaolaza was tried and acquitted of participation in the attack due to lack of evidence.  Aftermath  The attack marked the beginning of a deadlier phase in ETA's operations and the following three years would see an increase in attacks and killings carried out by the group.

Matzpen (, lit. 'Compass') is the name of a revolutionary socialist and anti-Zionist organisation, founded in Israel in 1962 which was active until the 1980s. Its official name was the Socialist Organisation in Israel, but it became better known as Matzpen after its monthly publication. Origins The organisation was founded by former members of the Israeli Communist Party – Maki – who opposed that party's unquestioned support for the international policies of the Soviet Union. They offered a more radical analysis of and opposition to Zionism. An early analysis of the Arab–Israeli conflict, written before they left the Communist Party, by Moshe Machover and Akiva Orr (using a pseudonym, N. Israeli), appeared in Hebrew in 1961 under the title of Shalom, Shalom ve'ein Shalom (שלום, שלום, ואין שלום; Peace, Peace When There is No Peace – an English translation was completed in 2009; although still unpublished as of August 2016, the translation is available online). Matzpen drew together Jewish and Arab activists with various backgrounds in left-wing organisations and affiliations. Prominent among them was Jabra Nicola, a Palestinian-Israeli intellectual and activist who helped shape the theoretical orientation of the nascent organisation. It published a magazine of the same name in Hebrew and Arabic. The organisation grew in the period after the 1967 Six-Day War and Israel's occupation of Palestinian and Arab territories.Ran Greenstein, \\"Class, Nation, and Political Organization: The Anti-Zionist Left in Israel/Palestine\\", International Labor and Working Class History, 75 (Spring 2009): 85–108 Core positions In a statement titled \\"Down with the Occupation”, from 1 January 1969, Matzpen distinguished itself – together with the Communist Party (Rakah) – as the only forces conducting \\"a consistent struggle against the continued occupation of the territories conquered in June '67\\". Faced with a situation in which \\"Israel controls the whole of the Palestine Mandate territory as well as vast tracts of Egyptian territory and a region in the south of Syria\\", Matzpen asserted in \\"General Declaration by the ISO\\" in March 1968, that \\"It is both the right and duty of every conquered and subjugated people to resist and to struggle for its freedom. The ways, means and methods necessary and appropriate for such struggle must be determined by the people itself and it would be hypocritical for strangers - especially if they belong to the oppressing nation – to preach to it, saying, 'Thus shalt thou do, and thus shalt thou not do.'\\" It added, that despite its recognition of \\"the unconditional right of the conquered to resist occupation\\", as an organization it could support politically \\"only such organizations which, in addition to resisting occupation, also recognize the right of the Israeli people for self-determination\\" in order to enable \\"a joint struggle of Arabs and Jews in the region for a common future.\\" In this context, Matzpen's aim was to create a broad front of people opposed to the occupation and in favour of a de-Zionized Israel, which would form part of a socialist federation of the entire Middle East. In contrast to the Communist Party and the Zionist Left, Matzpen insisted that the 1967 occupation was but one stage in the long history of Zionist settlement, and reversing it would be a necessary but not sufficient condition for overall solution to the problems of the Middle East. For such a solution, political mobilization of Arabs, Jews, and other national minorities in the region would be needed. The political framework for this mobilization became known as the Arab Revolution, which combined national and socialist tasks in the process of struggle against Zionism, imperialism and Arab reaction.Jabra Nicola and Moshe Machover, \\"The Palestinian Struggle and Revolution in the Middle East\\", Matzpen 50, August 1969, To advance these aims, Matzpen established links with New Left organisations in Europe and other parts of the world, and also with progressive Palestinian organisations, such as the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine. Many of the original analyses and statements of the organisation were included in a published collection under the title The Other Israel: The Radical Case Against Zionism, edited by Arie Bober (Doubleday, 1972). Bober's book provided an overview of the positions held by Matzpen at the time on a range of issues, and thus is an essential resource on the organisation's analysis of Israeli society and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In the introduction to the book he says: > \\"This book is the result of five years' collective effort by a small group > of Arab and Jewish citizens of Israel to penetrate the dense net of illusion > and myth that today dominates the thinking and feeling of most Israelis and, > at the same time, largely determines the prevailing image of Israel in the > Western world. According to the Zionist fairy tale, the state of Israel is > an outpost of democracy, social justice and enlightenment, and a homeland > and haven for the persecuted Jews of the world. This outpost, so the story > goes, though earnestly seeking peace with its neighbors finds itself in a > state of perpetual siege because of the greed of Arab rulers, the inherent > “unreasonableness” of the Oriental mind and the innate Gentile proclivity > toward hatred of the Jews. > \\"The reality, this book demonstrates, is utterly different. The Zionist > state was born in the violent expropriation and expulsion from their country > of the Palestinian Arabs, and that process continues today. In open alliance > with Western, especially United States, imperialism, and in scarcely hidden > collusion with the most reactionary forces in the Arab world, the Zionist > state actively sets itself against every step, no matter how faltering, > taken by the Arab masses to alleviate the centuries’ old misery imposed on > them by colonialism and imperialism. Within the territories occupied since > 1967, the Zionist state employs a system of direct military repression to > expel Palestinian Arabs from their lands and secure Jewish colonization of > them, and to crush every expression of Palestinian resistance. Within its > own borders, the Zionist state engages in systematic national oppression of > its minority of Arab citizens. The dark-skinned majority of the privileged > Jewish community itself increasingly feels the sting of racist > discrimination, as economic inequality increases and social conditions > deteriorate. Far from offering a haven to the persecuted Jews of the world, > the Zionist state is leading new immigrants and old settlers alike toward a > new holocaust by mobilizing them in a colonial enterprise and a > counterrevolutionary army against the struggle of the Arab masses for > national liberation and social emancipation – a struggle that is not only > just but will eventually be victorious. This state of affairs is, moreover, > in no sense accidental. It was the inevitable outcome of the success of the > Zionist project to establish a Jewish state in Palestine. And to change this > reality requires not merely a change of government or a modification of one > or another specific policy, but a revolutionary transformation of the very > foundations of Israeli society.\\" Matzpen outside Israel In the late 1960s and early 1970s, supporters of Matzpen abroad published Israca (Israeli Revolutionary Action Committee Abroad). The magazine included many articles published in Matzpen. Some of Matzpen was censored and that material was republished in Israca. Moshé Machover, Eli Lobel, Haim Hanegbi, and Akiva Orr were all part of the editorial board. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, supporters of the organisation and other radical left academics and activists formed another journal in the UK, Khamsin, in which they published their analyses of current events. A selection of material from Khamsin was published under the title Forbidden Agenda: Intolerance and Defiance in the Middle East (Saqi Books, 2000). Splits and debates In 1970 the organisation started going through a process of ideological and organisational fragmentation, with some members leaving to form new groups, such as Avangard with a Trotskyist orientation, led by Menahem Carmi and Sylvain Cypel, and Ma'avak (Revolutionary Communist Alliance), with a Maoist orientation, led by Ilan Albert and Rami Livneh. A further split within the latter organisation saw the formation of the Revolutionary Communist Alliance - Red Front, led by Udi Adiv and Dan Vered. Avangard also underwent splits, which saw the formation of the Spartacist League in 1974 and the Nitzotz group in 1977.Details in Ran Greenstein, \\"Socialist Anti-Zionism: A chapter in the history of the Israeli radical left\\", Socialist History, 35 (2009): 20-39 The theoretical debates that led to the splits in Matzpen had to do with the conceptualization of the relations between class struggle and nationalism in the struggle for socialism. Avangard regarded Israel as a normal capitalist society in which the working class was the primary revolutionary agent. Hence, it saw its goal as the mobilization of that class to create an Israeli socialist republic. It regarded Matzpen's focus on the Israeli-Palestinian national conflict and on the colonial origins of Israeli society as a distraction from the class struggle. Ma'avak, in contrast, saw Matzpen as not emphasizing enough the colonial character of Israeli society. It saw its goal as that of facilitating the Palestinian national liberation struggle as a necessary step towards socialism. In response to both groups, Matzpen re-asserted its combination of support for national and social struggles. A major split within the core group of mainstream Matzpen took place in 1972, and both factions kept the name Matzpen for their respective journals, an issue that gave rise to sharp dispute between them. The obvious value of the 'Matzpen' label as a marker of radical left-wing politics was behind that decision. Most of the original leadership remained in what became known as Matzpen Tel Aviv, while the other faction became known as Matzpen Jerusalem. That latter group adopted the name Matzpen Marxist, to distinguish itself from its rivals. In 1975 it changed its name to Revolutionary Communist League, section of the Fourth International, while retaining the title Matzpen Marxist for its regular publication. The Tel Aviv group also changed its name subsequently (in 1978) to the Socialist Organization in Israel and dropped the adjective 'Israeli' in order to avoid possible association with Zionism. Both groups retained the original Matzpen dual focus on class and national liberation. Machover, Orr and Haim Hanegbi remained with the Tel Aviv based group, while the Jerusalem-based group was led by Arieh Bober and Michel Warschawski (Mikado). A youth movement known as Hafarperet (mole) was affiliated with the latter group, and was active in the mid-1970s, mostly in Haifa. The Red Front trial One of the organizations to emerge from Matzpen, the Red Front, had a brief history of just over a year. At the end of 1972 many of its members were arrested and charged with espionage and collaboration with the enemy (Syrian military intelligence), based on a secret trip some of them took to Damascus. None of the activists detained and charged were members of Matzpen at the time, or at the time they committed their alleged offences against state security. In a well-publicised trial in 1973 five members of the Red Front were sentenced to various periods in prison. Many of the defendants stated that they had been subjected to torture and other forms of physical and mental harassment by the Israeli security services before the trial, to force confessions out of them.Statements about the torture, including names of affected people, and a petition by family members and human rights activists are found in both issues of Matzpen 67 published separately by the two factions in January 1973, http://israeli-left- archive.org/greenstone/collect/znews/index/assoc/HASH01e4/5fd5f17b.dir/doc.pdf and It is obvious that none of them had any interest in working with the Syrian or other Arab regimes, and their sole interest consisted in establishing links with other revolutionary organizations in the region, primarily Palestinian ones. Statements before the trial, submitted by the leading defendants – Daud Turki and Ehud Adiv – allow us to get a clear idea of their perspective. Turki, A Palestinian-Arab citizen of Israel, defined their goal as socialism: “the common goal of all workers, peasants and those who are persecuted in Israeli society. The Jews have a share, and they must have a share, because they are members of the organization on a footing of equality with me, in establishing a new government and a new regime which will allow both the Jewish people and the Arab people to play an effective part in the struggle of the Arab people for liberation”. Turki went on to criticise Zionism, which “instead of adopting, as it should, a neutral attitude, or one of support for the Arab struggle for national and socialist liberation, it has stood beside this movement's enemies, beside the Americans who are persecuting the Vietnamese people, beside American imperialism which is exploiting the peoples of Latin America and the peoples of Asia and Africa, and setting the Jewish people against the Arab people forever. I think that this attitude amounts to a crime against both the Jewish people and the Arab people.” In his view, Jews should support the Arab struggle for liberation rather than a struggle that supersedes nationalism, although both groups have “the same future and would live together in a single homeland under the rule of a single state, a state liberated from all foreign influence and all social exploitation.” The same approach was displayed by Adiv. Accepting that “all trends of Matzpen” had “a sound theory”, he argued that they lacked “the chapter entitled ‘what is to be done’ to reach the multi-national socialist Middle East they talk of, and in their political activity they restrict their talk to the Jewish state of Israel. That is to say they are preoccupied with convincing the Jews, and completely disregard the Arab struggle, and in particular the Palestinian Arab struggle against Zionism and the state of Israel.” A change of focus was needed to convert the national conflict into a class struggle. This could be done only “if the Jews will prove to the Arabs, who have been fighting Zionism for dozens of years, that they [the Jews] are on their side, that they are prepared to sacrifice everything they have, to be subjected to the same ‘treatment’ and to share everything with them. Without this no Arab will have confidence that the sincerest Jewish revolutionary is really revolutionary. No ideology, not even the most equitable and progressive, can convince the Arabs unless it is accompanied by action on the part of those who adhere to it.”\\"The Red Front Trial: The Depositions of Turki and Adiv\\", Journal of Palestine Studies, 2, 4 (Summer 1973): 144-150, https://www.jstor.org/pss/2535650 Beyond organizational existence – Matzpen's legacy With the rise of new, vibrant and less ideologically rigid protest movements in the 1980s, in opposition to the continued occupation and to the war in Lebanon (Committee for Solidarity with Birzeit University, committees against torture and house demolitions, Yesh Gvul, Alternative Information Center, Workers Advice Center, and so on), the different factions of Matzpen lost much of their raison d'etre. The space for overall left-wing organizations, with comprehensive political agendas, shrank with the growing focus on the occupation and its consequences. Many activists sought new organizational forms in order to enhance their ability to make an effective contribution to the political struggle, without carrying cumbersome ideological and organizational baggage. Much of the energy of the Revolutionary Communist League, for example, went into creating and maintaining the Alternative Information Center, which effectively depleted the League of its own organizational capacity. As a result, most of the Matzpen factions ceased to have a distinct organizational existence by the late 1980s, if not before that. Many of their former members though, continue to participate as dedicated individuals in various activities against the occupation and for workers and human rights. A documentary about the group, entitled \\"Matzpen\\", was made by Eran Torbiner in 2003. Another documentary about Avangard was produced in 2009 by Tom Carmi (son of two former leaders of the group) and presented at the Tel Aviv Docaviv festival. It is titled \\"Away from the Tribe's Centre\\", and was awarded second prize in the students' films competition. In these documentaries as well as most other books by and interviews with members who ended-up in different factions, the doctrinal differences that led to their divergent paths disappear from view. The focus almost invariably is on activities against the occupation, anti-Zionist positions, the sense of dissent, and so on, which they all shared, rather than on what had set them apart. Despite the absence of organizational activity, some of the original Matzpen members continue to write and be active politically. Haim Hanegbi and Michel Warschawski played a key role in writing the 2004 Olga Document, which is a statement of the anti-Zionist position and a radical critique of Israeli policies and practices, and Warschawski published his political memoir in English, On the Border (South End Press, 2004; original French in 2002). He further published, together with Lebanese academic and activist Gilbert Achcar, a book titled The 33-Day War: Israel's War on Hezbollah in Lebanon and Its Consequences (Paradigm Publishers, 2007), in which the war is covered with a focus on both Israeli and Lebanese perspectives. Sylvain Cypel wrote a historical and political analysis of Israeli society under the title Walled: Israeli Society at an Impasse (Other Press, 2007; original French in 2006). Moshe Machover has continued to publish theoretical papers analyzing Israel/Palestine within the broader Middle Eastern framework, and in 2009, together with Ehud Ein-Gil, he published an article in the UK journal Race & Class, titled \\"Zionism and Oriental Jews: a dialectic of exploitation and co-optation\\", in which they analyze the question of ethnic divisions within Israel society. A new book on Matzpen was published in Israel in September 2010, under the title Matzpen: Conscience and Fantasy (Tel Aviv: Resling, 2010). It is the most comprehensive account to date of the organization's history, based on interviews with former activists and a study of documents.

A member of the Irgun as a teenager, Avnery sat for two terms in the Knesset from 1965 to 1974 and from 1979 to 1981. He was also the owner of the news magazine HaOlam HaZeh from 1950 until its closure in 1993. He became known for crossing the lines during the Siege of Beirut to meet Yassir Arafat on 3 July 1982, the first time the Palestinian leader met with an Israeli. Avnery was the author of several books about the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, including 1948: A Soldier's Tale, the Bloody Road to Jerusalem (2008); Israel's Vicious Circle (2008); and My Friend, the Enemy (1986). Early life Avnery was born in Beckum, near Münster in Westphalia, as Helmut Ostermann, the youngest of four children, to a well-established German Jewish family, his father being a private banker in the town. He grew up in Hanover where he counted among his companions Rudolf Augstein, the future proprietor of Der Spiegel. Avnery and his family emigrated to Mandatory Palestine in 1933, following Adolf Hitler's rise to power. He attended school in Nahalal and then in Tel Aviv, leaving after 7th grade, at age 14, in order to help his parents. He started work as a clerk for a lawyer, a job he held for about five years. He joined the Irgun, a Zionist paramilitary group, in 1938, in reaction to the British hanging of Shlomo Ben-Yosef, who had thrown a grenade (which failed to explode) into a bus carrying Arab women and children, but unlike his comrade-in-arms Yitzhak Shamir who joined up at roughly the same time, Avnery was judged too young to engage directly in actions such as killing Jews suspected of being informers for the British, and bombing Arab markets. He changed his surname to Avnery, a Hebraic rendering of Werner,Werner Osterman CWGC record accessed September 24,2018 to honour the memory of his only brother, who died fighting in the British Army on the Ethiopian front in 1941. He left the Irgun in 1942 after becoming disenchanted with their tactics, stating in a 2003 interview that, \\"I didn't like the methods of terror applied by the Irgun at the time\\", noting he did not back killing people in retaliation for similar acts by the Arabs. He abandoned Zionism at an early age, while remaining a nationalist, which he regarded as a natural feeling for desiring to belong to a collectivity, legitimate for Jews as it was for Arabs. Zionism's mission, in his view, ended with the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948. In 1947 Avnery founded his own small group, Eretz Yisrael HaTze'ira (\\"Young Land of Israel\\"), which published the journal Ma'avak (\\"Struggle\\"). From 1941 to 1946, he wrote for two fascist newspapers, HaHevrah (Society) and BaMa'avak (In the Struggle). Avnery's early political thought was influenced by Canaanism. As early as 1946 he coined the term Hishtalvut BaMerhav (integration into the region) to express the idea that the future state of the Jews must align itself within a broad \\"Semitic space\\" (Merhav HaShemi), a choice of terminology dictated by his perception that the region had been dominated by Western imperialism and colonialism. This \\"Semitic region\\" where he envisaged an alliance between Arab and Jewish national movements included Palestine, Transjordan, Lebanon, Syria, and Iraq. =Military service= Avnery during his military service in 1948 During the 1948 Arab-Israeli War Avnery fought on the southern front in the Givati Brigade as a squad commander, and later in the Samson's Foxes commando unit (and also wrote its anthem, The Foxes of Shimshon, which has been called \\"one of the enduring battle anthems of the 1948 campaign\\"). He wrote dispatches from the front line which were published in Haaretz and later as a book, In the Fields of Philistia (, Bi-Sdot Pleshet). His experiences impressed him with the understanding that there was such a thing as the Palestinian people. They would enter villages where lighted fires and Primus cookers indicated that the inhabitants had fled minutes before. It was rational for them to flee because that is what all civilians do when fired on. Avnery was wounded twice, the second time, toward the end of the war, seriously; he spent the last months of his army service convalescing and was discharged in the summer of 1949. Career =Journalism career= Though it was forbidden for soldiers to write for newspapers, Avnery wrote articles on his frontline experiences during the 1948 war. Shortly after his stint with that newspaper, Avnery (with Shalom Cohen and two others) in 1950 bought the failing magazine HaOlam HaZeh (\\"This World\\"). Avnery edited the weekly magazine, with its banner maxim \\"without fear, without bias,\\" during the 1950s and the 1960s, turning it into an anti-establishment tabloid known for many sensational scoops. Its impact was such that David Ben-Gurion refused to mention it by name, and would only speak of \\"that particular magazine\\". The magazine was divided into two sections, the first half dealing with indepth muckraking journalistic investigations into corruption, the second half writing up titillating gossip. It featured nudes on its back cover. The editorial office and printer of the paper were subject to three bombing attacks. He was arraigned on charges of sedition, survived two assassination attempts, and, in 1953, an unknown person—in one version he states that soldiers were involved—assaulted him, leaving him with both hands and all his fingers broken. Avnery introduced a punchy, aggressive style of newspaper writing into Israeli journalism and, according to Greer Fay, virtually every journalist who trained under him moved on to become a star elsewhere. After the Egyptian Revolution of 1952 Avnery used his editorials in HaOlam HaZeh to call for a preventive strike against Egypt, arguing that \\"the reactionary Arab regimes\\" would attack Israel \\"the minute Arab superiority in weapons over Israel is great enough.\\" He began to revise his views after the 1956 Suez Crisis, which ended in Israeli withdrawal and strengthened Nasser. In June 1957 Avnery suggested that Israel aid Palestinians in overthrowing the Hashemite monarchy in Jordan (a \\"product of imperialism\\"); Israel would then form a federation with the new Palestinian Jordanian state. In the late 1950s Avnery was among the founders of the group Semitic Action, which argued for a regional federation of Israel and its neighbors. =Knesset= In 1965, Avnery created a political party bearing the name of his and Cohen's magazine, HaOlam HaZeh – Koah Hadash, and was elected to the Knesset in the 1965 election. The move was inspired by the passage in 1965 of a Law against Defamation in Israel, which Avnery took personally as a legislative measure designed to muzzle his newspaper's reportage. The dominant focus of his criticism was the Mapai establishment. Although he retained his seat in the 1969 election, the party disintegrated and Avnery renamed it Meri. Although it failed to win any seats in the 1973 elections, Avnery returned to the Knesset as a member of the Sheli party after the 1977 election, but did not retain his seat in the 1981 election. He was later involved in the Progressive List for Peace. He wrote a book of his early period in parliament, entitled 1 against 119: Uri Avnery in the Knesset, (1969). =Israel–Palestine peace activism= Avnery with Yassir Arafat in Beirut, July 1982 By the 1970s, Avnery came to think that Zionism—an ideology centered on the ingathering of the exiles—was effectively dead, since diaspora Jews in significant numbers were no longer performing aliyah. In late 1975 he was among the founders of the Israeli Council for Israeli–Palestinian Peace. Shortly after the group's founding, Avnery was assaulted and stabbed several times. Avnery crossed the front lines and met Yasser Arafat on 3 July 1982, during the Siege of Beirut—said to have been the first time an Israeli met personally with Arafat. He was tracked by an Israeli intelligence team which intended to kill Arafat, even if it meant killing Avnery at the same time once the latter had inadvertently led them to Arafat's hide-out. The operation, \\"Salt Fish\\", failed when the PLO managed to lose their trackers in the alleyways of Beirut. Robert Fisk interviewed Avnery at the time, when the Sabra and Shatila massacre took place, and asked him how survivors of the Holocaust and their children could look on as 1,700 Palestinians were massacred. He replied: > \\"I will tell you something about the Holocaust. It would be nice to believe > that people who have undergone suffering have been purified by suffering. > But it's the opposite, it makes them worse. It corrupts. There is something > in suffering that creates a kind of egoism. Herzog [the Israeli president at > the time] was speaking at the site of the concentration camp at Bergen- > Belsen but he spoke only about the Jews. How could he not mention that > others – many others – had suffered there? Sick people, when they are in > pain, cannot speak about anyone but themselves. And when such monstrous > things have happened to your people, you feel nothing can be compared to it. > You get a moral \\"power of attorney\\", a permit to do anything you want – > because nothing can compare to what has happened to us. This is a moral > immunity which is very clearly felt in Israel.\\" Avnery at a Hadash rally against the 2006 Lebanon War His visit with Arafat was among the reasons he became estranged from his mother, Hilda Ostermann, who disinherited him. She did not learn Hebrew and knew nothing of politics other than what she gleaned from a German nationalist newsletter. To meet the Palestinian leader he had to forsake his regular Friday visit to his mother in Rehovot. In her will, Hilda wrote \\"I do not leave a penny to my son Uri, who instead of taking care of me went off to visit that murderer Yasser Arafat\\". However, his sister gave him his share of the inheritance. He later turned to left-wing peace activism and founded the Gush Shalom movement in 1993, and argued that every Israeli settlement was a \\"landmine on the road to peace\\". He was a secularist and strongly opposed to the Orthodox influence in religious and political life. In 2001, Avnery and his wife Rachel Avnery were honoured with the Right Livelihood Award \\"for their unwavering conviction, in the midst of violence, that peace can only be achieved through justice and reconciliation\\". In 2006, settler activist Baruch Marzel called on the Israeli military to carry out \\"a targeted killing\\" against Avnery. He advocated negotiations with Hamas. In 2007 Gush Shalom had a sticker printed which read: \\"Talk to Hamas\\". Avnery himself had once, in 1993, addressed in Gaza an audience of 500 bearded sheikhs, who listened as he spoke to them in Hebrew, and, applauding him, invited him to lunch. Later years Avnery was a contributor to the news and opinion sites such as for CounterPunch. In April 2018, Avnery wrote a column for CounterPunch criticizing the Israeli military for their response to the 2018 Gaza border protests. He wrote: \\"I dissociate myself from the [Israeli] army sharpshooters who murder unarmed demonstrators along the Gaza Strip, and from their commanders, who give them the orders, up to the commander in chief\\". On 4 August 2018, Avnery suffered a stroke and was hospitalized in a critical condition in Tel Aviv. He died at Ichilov Hospital on 20 August 2018 at the age of 94, less than a month short of his 95th birthday. In accordance to his wishes, he was cremated and his ashes were scattered off the coast of Tel Aviv.https://www.timesofisrael.com/israelis- palestinians-pay-respects-to-late-peace-activist-uri-avnery/ Personal life Uri Avnery in 2006 Avnery's life with his companion Rachel () lasted 58 years, five of them before they married. In 1995 he stated proudly that they were the only Israeli couple he knew who were not divorced. They first met when she was 14 years old, in 1946, she being the daughter of the landlord of the house where one of the members of his Semitic nation group lived and where they went to discuss ideas. Around 1951, they crossed paths again when a director of a theatrical troupe introduced her as a possible choice for a photograph required for an ad his magazine intended to run. When he failed, some time later, to turn up for a date, she went to his office and learned he had had all his fingers broken. She took care of him, and they lived together for 5 years, both being averse to religion and, in Israel, civil marriages are not permitted. They formalized their relationship privately with a rabbi to set Rachel's father's mind at rest when the latter fell ill. Avnery said her outstanding trait was empathy, something he illustrated by an anecdote of watching a film concerning an old woman in the Slovak Republic who does not understand a deportation order, and neighbours assist her in going to the assembly point for departure to the death camps. At the end, when the lights came on, Menachem Begin happened to be sitting in a row in front of them. He stood up, weeping, and came over and kissed her on the brow. The gesture of kissing her on the brow was repeated by Yasser Arafat when she and her husband acted as human shields when he was under siege and holed up in the Mukataa. She earned the respect and friendship of Raed Salah during tent protests against Yitzhak Rabin's deportation of 415 Palestinians to Lebanon in December 1992. She was a primary school teacher for 28 years. She died in May 2011 of the long-term debilitating effects of a Hepatitis C infection contracted some two decades earlier. Their marriage was childless by choice. Avnery suffered from both diabetes and Crohn's disease. In his testament he willed his assets and savings to the people of Israel, to finance further peace projects.

He described himself as a \\"Hebrew-speaking Palestinian\\". The son of poultry vendors, he was educated at a religious school. In his teens, after initially joining Ze'ev Jabotinsky's Betar organization, he became a member of all three Jewish underground military organizations in British-ruled Mandatory Palestine: Lehi (the \\"Stern Gang\\"), Etzel, and Haganah (Palmach) that fought the British and the Arab populations. The British Mandatory authorities arrested him and detained him for several months at Latrun. With the establishment of Israel, he briefly joined the Israeli Communist party. He fought in Israel's first three wars: 1948–50, 1956, and 1967. However, Tzabar strongly disagreed with the annexation of the Golan Heights and East Jerusalem and takeover of the West Bank and Gaza Strip by Israel in the aftermath of the Six-Day war. In September 1967 he became famous for a declaration he published in Ha'aretz, together with 11 co-signatories, protesting against the incipient occupation. In part it read:- > \\"Our right to defend ourselves from extermination does not give us the right > to oppress others. Occupation entails foreign rule. Foreign rule entails > resistance. Resistance entails repression. Repression entails terror and > counter-terror. The victims of terror are mostly innocent people. Holding on > to the occupied territories will turn us into a nation of murderers and > murder victims. Let us get out of the occupied territories immediately.' He subsequently left Israel in protest and settled in England. Tzabar was a columnist for a number of years for both the daily Haaretz and the weekly Ha'olam Haze newspapers. He also published 27 books in Hebrew, among these are works of fiction, travel, children's books and poetry. Allen Lane, the hardcover imprint of Penguin Books, published his English book, The White Flag Principle, that had been translated and published in Japan and in most European languages. His views eventually evolved towards anti-Zionism: Tzabar became an outspoken opponent of Zionism in addition to the occupation; he criticized peace groups like Peace Now and Gush Shalom. In 2004 Michelin threatened to sue him for trademark infringement, after he published a study of Israel's prisons under the title \\"MUCH BETTER THAN THE OFFICIAL MICHELIN Guide to Israeli prisons, Jails, concentration camps and torture chambers\\". The company eventually dropped the case, much to Tzabar's disappointment. An accomplished painter, polymath, and mycophile, he identified a species of mushroom.

He was an outspoken critic of Zionism and supported a one-state solution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. After 1968 Orr was a leading advocate of radical direct democracy.Politics Without Politicians  Early life  Orr was born in Berlin in 1931. His parents left Germany when he was three years old, in the aftermath of the Nazi rise to power, and moved to Palestine, then under British rule. Orr grew up in Tel Aviv and attended the First Municipal School of Tel Aviv. He was a keen swimmer and was the Maccabi 200 m breast-stroke champion in 1946 and 1947. In 1946 he was drafted into the Haganah, the Jewish paramilitary organization that was to develop into the Israeli Defence Forces following the creation of the State of Israel in 1948. He joined the Navy, which played a minor role in the 1948 War of Independence. Political career =\\"Maki\\" Communist party= Orr served in the Israeli navy until 1950, and then joined the merchant navy. He participated in the Israeli Seamen's Strike of 1951, which lasted 40 days. It was during this time that he became politicized in the wake of a beating incurred at the hands of the Israeli police. In the same year he joined the Israeli Communist Party. He remained in the merchant navy until 1955, when he moved to Jerusalem to study mathematics and physics at the Hebrew University. There, he served as secretary of the Union of Communist Science Students at the University. Following his graduation in 1958, he started teaching mathematics and physics at the AIU Technical College. In 1961, Orr published his first major work. Written with Moshe Machover under the pseudonym, A Israeli, Shalom, Shalom ve'ein Shalom (Hebrew: ; Peace, Peace, and there is no Peace) set out to demonstrate how Israeli Prime Minister Ben-Gurion had colluded with Britain and France in a colonial war against Egypt and to disprove Ben-Gurion's claims that the 1956 Suez War had been a war fought to save Israel from annihilation (see Protocol of Sèvres). =\\"Matzpen\\" socialist organization= In 1962, Orr left the Israeli Communist Party and, alongside Machover, Oded Pilavsky and Jeremy Kaplan, formed the Israeli Socialist Organization, better known by the name of its publication Matzpen. Its founders rejected what they saw as the Israeli Communist Party's unquestioning loyalty to the Soviet Union. They defined \\"Socialism\\" as a regime run by workers councils, not by a political party. Matzpen criticized the Zionist project in Israel as a colonizing project, although they were careful to distinguish it from the European colonialism of the 19th and 20th century, arguing that the Zionists had come to Palestine to expropriate the indigenous population rather than to exploit them economically. Matzpen remained on the fringes of Israeli politics throughout its existence, never gaining more than a few dozen members,Website of Matzpen, The Socialist Organization in Israel. Accessed 22 August 2009. although the group began to receive attention in the Israeli press after the 1967 war and the emergence of the Palestinian Liberation Organization. =In London= Orr left Israel in 1964 to study Cosmology in London, where he continued to be politically active. He co-founded and was on the editorial board of ISRACA (Israeli Revolutionary Action Committee Abroad), an anti- Zionist publication \\"devoted to a critique of the ideological, cultural and psychological aspects of Political Zionism\\".ISRACA, issue no. 5, January 1973, p. 3. In London, Orr became acquainted with several prominent left-wing intellectuals, such as the Austrian poet Erich Fried, the veteran revolutionary Rosa Meyer-Leviné (1890 - 1979), the German student leader Rudi Dutschke, and the Trinidadian Marxist and cricketing authority C. L. R. James, with whom he enjoyed close friendships. In 1968 Orr joined the London-based group Solidarity, a libertarian socialist organization, and befriended its Greek mentor Cornelius Castoriadis. From this time on, Orr became a libertarian socialist (not ideologically bound to the theories of Marx and Lenin). The year 1972 saw the publication of The Other Israel: The Radical Case Against Zionism, a collection of articles and documents by various Matzpen members, including Orr, Machover and Haim Hanegbi, edited by Arie Bober. In 1984 Ithaca Press published Orr's The Un-Jewish State: the Politics of Jewish Identity in Israel, in which he argued that political Zionism had failed to create a secular Jewish identity. In 1994, Israel: Politics, Myths and Identity Crises was published, a collection of Orr's essays that also dealt with issues arising from the clash between Israel's secular and Jewish identities. By this time, Orr had moved back to Israel (in 1990). Beginning in the 1970s Orr lectured in the United Kingdom and Israel to student bodies and political organizations on various aspects of the Arab-Israeli conflict and on direct democracy. He was invited to speak at the 2011 Israeli tent protests on Rothschild Boulevard, Tel Aviv, where he delivered lectures on the Seamen's Strike of 1951 and on direct democracy.  Direct democracy  Following his conversion to libertarian socialism in the late 1960s, Orr became increasingly active in the promotion of radical direct democracy, which rejects the notion of representative democracy and calls for political decision-making to be placed in the hands of every single citizen. His ideas were grounded in the events of May 1968 in France. In the wake of this wildcat general strike (opposed at first by all unions and political parties), which at its peak saw 10 million employees on strike for 20 days, thousands of self-managed committees sprang up throughout the country. They did not make any economic demands but asserted their right to run their institutions independently. Drawing on contemporary reports of the Observer journalists Patrick Seale and Maureen McConville,Seale, P. & McConville, M. (1968). French Revolution 1968, London: Penguin. Orr asserted that the desire of the strikers was not to reform the political system but to replace it entirely by a system of democratic self-governance, in which all employees have a say in the decision- making process. Orr argued that while in 1968 the technology did not exist to enable all citizens to participate in decision making, it exists today. He argued that political corruption is an inherent feature of politics by representatives and of all elections and that only a system of \\"politics without politicians\\" can eliminate corruption. Orr wrote and distributed two major works on direct democracy, Politics without Politicians, an outline of the central tenets of direct democracy, and Big Business, Big Government or Direct Democracy: Who Should Shape Society?, a history of the 20th century viewed in terms of the conflict between state and private control of the economy, a conflict that he regarded as the defining feature of the epoch. He argued that a system of direct democracy is the only viable alternative to \\"big government states\\" or \\"big business states\\", both of which he viewed as oppressive forms of governance.Orr, A.

Retrieved on 17 August 2011 He stepped down as Hamas' politburo chief at the end of his term limit in 2017.Hamas Elects New Politburo Chief: Haniyeh Replaces Meshal as Political Leader After the founding of Hamas in 1987, Mashal was the leader of the Kuwaiti branch of the organization. He moved from Kuwait to Jordan in 1991. Following the expulsion of the Hamas leadership from Jordan in August 1999, Mashal lived in Qatar, before moving to the Syrian capital of Damascus in 2001. He returned to Qatar in 2012 as a result of the Syrian Civil War. Early life Mashal was born in 1956 in Silwad in the West Bank, then annexed by Jordan. He attended Silwad Elementary School until the 1967 Six-Day War. His father moved the family to Kuwait afterwards for financial reasons, where he, like his half-brother Mufid, completed high school. Mashal joined the Muslim Brotherhood in 1971. He holds a bachelor of science degree in Physics from Kuwait University. Membership in Hamas While at Kuwait University, Mashal headed the Islamic Justice (qa’imat al-haq al-islamiyya) list in the General Union of Palestinian Students (GUPS) elections in 1977. The basis for the Islamic Justice list was the Palestinian Islamic movement, as part of the Muslim Brotherhood. After the cancellation of the GUPS elections, Mashal established the Islamic League for Palestinian Students (al-rabita al-islamiyya li tolaab filastin) in 1980.Khalid Meshaal : The Making of a Palestinian Islamic Leader Interviewed by Mouin Rabbani, Journal of Palestine Studies, Vol 37, no. 1 (Spring 2008), p. 59 Mashal was a teacher in Kuwait from 1978 to 1984. In 1983, the Palestinian Islamic movement convened an internal, closed conference in an Arab state, which included delegates from the West Bank, Gaza Strip and Palestinian refugees from Arab states. It laid the foundation for the creation of Hamas. Mashal was part of the leadership of the project to build a Palestinian Islamic movement from its inception. After 1984, he devoted himself to the project on a full-time basis. Mashal lived in Kuwait until the 1991 Gulf War. When Ba'athist Iraq invaded Kuwait, he then moved to Jordan and began working directly with Hamas. He has been a member of Hamas' Political Bureau since its inception and became its chairman in 1996. 1997 assassination attempt On 25 September 1997, Mashal was targeted in an assassination attempt carried out by the Israeli Mossad under orders from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his security cabinet. The assassination was intended as retaliation for the 1997 Mahane Yehuda Market Bombings. At the time of the assassination attempt, Mashal was considered Hamas' Jordanian branch chief. Two Mossad agents carrying fake Canadian passports entered Jordan, where Mashal was living. The Mossad agents waited at the entrance of the Hamas offices in Amman, and as Mashal walked into his office, one of the agents came up from behind and held a device to Mashal's left ear that transmitted a fast-acting poison.McGeough, Paul (2009) Kill Khalid – The Failed Mossad Assassination of Khalid Mishaal and the Rise of Hamas. Quartet Books; . Page 184. Soon afterward the two Israeli agents were captured.Hartley, Lea, Cossali and Rowe, 2004, p. 231. Immediately after the incident, Jordan's King Hussein demanded that Netanyahu turn over the antidote for the poison, threatening to sever diplomatic relations and to try the detained Israeli agents. Netanyahu at first refused, and the incident quickly grew in political significance.

CT conduct and provide research, strategic communications and campaign execution services throughout the world, most notably in Canada, Australia, Britain, Africa, Italy and New Zealand. Recent work In 2008, Mark Textor claimed success for the successful Boris Johnson London Mayoral campaign. With his partner Lynton Crosby he helped develop Johnson's \\"donut strategy\\" that overcame the trend whereby Conservative voters in outer boroughs opted out of mayoral elections because they could not identify with issues important with those in the centre of the city. In the 2010 and 2013 Australian federal election campaigns, Textor was the principal national pollster and chief external strategist for Tony Abbott and the Liberal Party. The campaign delivered more seats and votes to the Liberal Party than the incumbent Labor Party after only one term. He claimed responsibility for the message: \\"We will stop the boats, stop the big new taxes, end the waste, and pay back the debt\\". In 2012 Textor was strategist and pollster for Campbell Newman's Liberal National Party election campaign; one that delivered a majority for the party. On his efforts the new Queensland Treasurer Tim Nicholls concluded in parliament: \\"If and when a history of researchers and pollsters is ever written, Mark Textor will rank in the first order throughout not only Australia but the world\\".The Hon. Nicholls, Tim. Address in Reply. Queensland Parliament, 17 May 2012. He also led the catastrophic effort which saw Newman's government removed from office after only a single term in government – matched by the reverse in Victoria of the same year.

In June 2014 CrosbyTextor conducted published polling on behalf of Australian Marriage Equality which showed the strongest support for same-sex marriage ever recorded in Australia. It found that 72% of Australians supported legalising same-sex marriage, while only 21% were opposed. Further, 77% of respondents agreed that Coalition MP's and Senators should be granted a conscience vote on the issue. In 2019, The Guardian announced it had seen documents revealing that multiple outwardly independent groups behind adverts on Facebook promoting a hard Brexit are administrated by employees of Lynton Crosby's lobbying firm, CTF Partners. In June 2020 CT carried out research commissioned by the From the Heart campaign regarding an Indigenous voice to Parliament, as recommended in the Uluru Statement from the Heart.

UBCF has grown to serve women, men and their families across the country as a national philanthropic organization. UBCF has been a Combined Federal Campaign approved charity since 2013. The founder and Executive Director of UBCF is Stephanie Mastroianni, who was inspired to form the organization after her mother died from breast cancer at the age of 42. According to the organization's IRS Form 990, Ms. Mastroianni, her father, Nicholas Mastroianni Sr., and her brother, Nicholas Mastroianni Jr., comprise the three members of the Board of Directors.

Reviewing the novella in The Future Fire, J. Moufawad-Paul wrote: “And Shall Machines Surrender is the perfect example of how much can possibly be packed into a novella. The equal depth of style, story, characterization, and world- building is quite striking”; and, “Due to the strength of And Shall Machines Surrender — its clarity and intricacy, its ability to compress complexity into a minimalist structure — it is almost criminal that Sriduangkaew is not a household name”. Most of Sriduangkaew's work is queer-normative and trans- inclusive, and foregrounds lesbian relationships and South-East-Asian themes or influences. Online activity In 2014, Sriduangkaew was revealed to have been the controversial blogger and book reviewer \\"Requires Hate\\" (also known as \\"Requires Only That You Hate\\", as well as \\"Winterfox\\"). Using these internet identities, she published violently intimidating and harsh critiques, which included death and rape threats, of many writers she claimed to have paid insufficient attention to racism, sexism, heteronormativity, or colonialism in their fiction. Many of her targets were themselves young, female, transgender, and/or persons of color.Acclaimed sci-fi writer exposed as notorious Internet troll, by Aja Romano, at The Daily Dot; published November 12, 2014; retrieved November 13, 2014 A blog post about Sriduangkaew's behavior by fellow writer Laura J. Mixon won Mixon the 2015 Hugo Award for Best Fan Writer. In reporting on Sriduangkaew's online activities, the Daily Dot wrote that it is not certain whether or not she is indeed a Thai writer, or whether Benjanun Sriduangkaew is a pseudonym or her real name. In a blog post in 2015, Sriduangkaew wrote that she had become the target of harassment and cyberstalking campaigns after her internet identities were revealed, while conceding that \\"I've been shitty in the past\\".

Coquille served as a passenger vessel from 1908 to 1916, when the boat was transferred to the lower Columbia River. Coquille was reconstructed into a log boom towing boat, and served in this capacity from 1916 to 1935 or later. Initial construction Coquille was built by Frank Lowe at Coquille, Oregon in 1908 for the Coquille River Navigation Company for passenger service on the Coquille River.Newell, Gordon R., ed., H.W. McCurdy Maritime History of the Pacific Northwest, Superior (1966), at page 149. The vessel was steam-powered and propeller-driven. The hull was built from Port Orford cedar. On completion, the overall size of the vessel was 63 gross and 46 net tons.Annual List of Merchant Vessels (for year ending June 30, 1909)., at page 177. Coquille was long, with a beam of and depth of hold. The official steamboat registry number was 205472. Coquille was launched on October 10, 1908.\\"Will Launch New Steamer\\", Coos Bay Times, October 10, 1908, page 1, col. 6. Reconstruction Coquille was rebuilt several times. With the addition of new machinery and an upper cabin in 1912 or 1913, the boat was measured at 77 gross and 60 net tons.Annual List of Merchant Vessels (for year ending June 30, 1913). While still in passenger service, Coquille was reconstructed again, and reduced somewhat in size, to 62 gross and 46 net tons. Coquille was reconstructed a third time, in 1916, when the vessel was converted to towing service. Collision with Wolverine On September 16, 1909, a rival boat, the motor vessel Wolverine collided with Coquille, at Johnson's Mill.U.S. Steamboat Inspection Service, Annual Report of the Supervising Inspector General to the Secretary of Commerce, at page 271. No damage was sustained by either vessel. On October 18, 1909, it was reported that two steamboat inspectors and a secretary had departed Portland, Oregon bound by steamer to Coos Bay to investigate first the collision of the ocean-going steamer Breakwater with the riverine steamer Alert, and second, the charges that had been brought by Orsan R. Willard, owner of Wolverine against T.R. Panter, owner of the river steamer Coquille to the effect that while Wolverine had been docked, Coquille had been deliberately rammed into the launch.\\"Will Probe Boat Trouble -- United States Inspectors to Investigate Coos Bay and Coquille Collisions\\", Coos Bay Times, October 18, 1909, page 1, col. 3. The hearing on the Willard accusation was scheduled to be held on October 23, 1909 in Coquille, Oregon. On October 28, 1909, the Steamboat Inspection Service announced its decision. The license of Orsan R. Willard, master of Wolverine would be suspended for 30 days, and the license of Thomas W. Panter, master of Coquille, would be suspended for 60 days. Second deck added Coquille in 1913, with upper cabin added. Coquille was intended to be the fastest vessel on the Coquille river, but this did not prove to be the case. As built, Coquille had a single cabin.\\"Bygone Era -- Riverboats Were Lifeline of Coquille Valley\\", Coquille Valley Sentinel, December 12, 2001, page 3. In 1912 or 1913 a second, upper, cabin was added to Coquille. Unfortunately this made the vessel top-heavy, so that when the steamer came around the sharp bend in the river near Prosper, all passengers had to move to the lower cabin to stabilize the boat. The upper deck was added under the direction of Hank Dunham, who also had a more powerful engine installed at the same time. The engine was new, and had been built in Portland, Oregon. This made the vessel top-heavy, so that \\"in anything like a wind swayed so that people were afraid to ride on her.\\" This occasioned a second reconstruction, which occurred sometime before the sale of the vessel to Portland interests in January 1916. These changes were reported to have been satisfactory. Child overboard On December 23, 1912, it was reported that a child, a young girl, had fallen overboard near the Lyons and Johnson mill at Bandon.\\"Child Floats Under Wharf\\", Coos Bay Times, December 23, 1912, page 1, col. 5. The child was not missed on the steamer for 15 minutes. She was found and rescued by the mill's engineer, who heard her crying and found her floating on her back in the deep water under the mill wharf. In January 1913, there were four vessels operating on the Coquille River which transported both passengers and freight.\\"Better Transportation Service Makes Bandon Travelers' Mecca\\", Sunday Oregonian, January 26, 1913, section three, page 10, col. 1. Of these, two ran from Bandon to Myrtle Point and the other two covered only the route from Bandon to Coquille. In addition to these four vessels, there were two passenger only boats operating on the river between Bandon and Coquille, the steamer Coquille and the motor vessel Wolverine. In January 1913, Coquille made two round trips daily between Bandon and Coquille City, and had been doing so since June 1, 1912. The steamer left Bandon at 6:00 a.m. and 1:00 p.m. and arrived in Coquille at 9:30 a.m. and 3:30 p.m. From June 1, 1912 to January 1, 1913, Coquille had carried about 21,000 passengers, which worked out to about 100 passengers per day. The steamer was reported to have Morris chairs for passengers, electric lighting and \\"many other conveniences of modern river travel.\\" \\"Deportation\\" of IWW sympathizer On the afternoon of July 11, 1913, the citizens of Bandon \\"deported\\" a newspaper editor, Dr. Bailey K. Leach, a chiropractor, because he had published editorials sympathetic to the Industrial Workers of the World, who were rumored to be planning to \\"invade\\" Bandon, by placing Dr. Leach on board Coquille, bound for Coquille City, with orders never to return.\\"Bandon Editor is Deported by Citizens -- Ordered Never to Return Because He Published Editorials Favorable to I.W.W. Horde\\", Daily Capital Journal, Page 7, col. 5. Dr. Leach was reported to have been \\"accompanied by a committee of Bandon businessmen\\" while on board Coquille. In addition, the steamer Favorite, \\"loaded with businessmen\\" accompanied Coquille on the journey upriver. According to the UPI story, \\"[t]here were no sympathizers to object to the deportation of Dr. Leach, and he was a sorry figure, alone and friendless. Practically the entire citizenship was present to witness his departure ...\\" Sinking On February 18, 1914, Coquille was reported to be back in service after having been recently raised.\\"News from Oregon Ports\\", Morning Oregonian, February 19, 1914, page 7. Following rebuilding at Prosper, Coquille was reported to be making better speed. Transfer to Myrtle Point Transportation Company On November 20, 1915 the owners of Coquille, the Coquille River Transportation Company sold out all their interests in the river transport business to their chief competitor, the Myrtle Point Transportation Company, which was composed primarily of the numerous Panter family.\\"Consolidation of River Boats -- Myrtle Point Transportation Company Absorbs Coquille River Co. and Makes New Schedule\\", Bandon Recorder, November 23, 1915, page 1, col. 1. At this time, the stock of the Coquille River Transportation Company was held by C.W. Ashton and E.W. Schetter, with O.R. \\"Ott\\" Willard having sold his interests the previous summer. With the purchase of Coquille, and the Coquille River Transportation company's other boat, the motor vessel Charm, Russell Panter and the Panter family now controlled eight vessels on the river.\\"Boats are Bought\\", Coos Bay Times, November 19, 1915, page 2, col. 3. The other Panter boats were the gasoline launches Pronto, Norma and Maple, and the sternwheelers Telegraph, Dora, and Myrtle. The new owners now controlled all river transport on the Coquille except for two remaining opposition boat, Dispatch and Favorite, both owned by the Farmers Transportation Company. A new schedule was put out, with Coquille leaving Coquille at 7:00 a.m., and, on the return trip, departing Bandon at 2:00 p.m., making one round-trip per day. Stacy Panter would be the new pilot and Carl Donaldson would be the new engineer. Transfer to Columbia River Coquille in 1916, prior to reconstruction as towboat. On January 25, 1916, it was reported that the previous week a sale of the Coquille to the Shaver Transportation Company, a Columbia River towing concern, had been concluded.\\"Steamer Coquille Sold to Portland People\\", The Bandon Recorder, January 25, 1916, page 1, col. 2. The vessel would be transferred as soon as weather permitted. Shaver at that time was a large concern with a dozen or more boats in operation. The new owners intended to place Coquille in service on the Willamette River. At this time, the overall size of the vessel was 62 gross and 46 net tons, with a length of , beam of and depth of hold of . The sale occurred after Capt. J.W. Shaver, of Shaver Transportation, travelled to the Coquille River to inspect the vessel.\\"Coquille is Coming\\", The Morning Oregonian, February 18, 1916, page 16, col. 5. Myrtle Point Transportation Company agreed on the sale price, and further agreed to transfer the vessel to the Columbia. Favorable weather for the transfer came about the next month. On February 17, 1916, Coquille departed Bandon at 9:50 am., passed by Coos Bay en route to the Columbia River.\\"News from Northwest Ports\\", The Morning Oregonian, February 18, 1916, page 16, col. 4. Coquille arrived at Astoria on February 19, 1916.\\"News from Northwest Ports\\", The Sunday Oregonian, February 20, 1916, section two, page 16, col. 4. The vessel was intended to be placed into towing service. Shaver planned to reconstruct Coquille for towing by, among other things, eliminating the passenger accommodations, cutting away the after section of the vessel's deckhouse, leaving one stateroom on each side, and lowering the smokestack to allow the boat to pass under bridges. Coquille burned coal on the trip to the Columbia, but Shaver planned to convert the vessel into an oil-burner. It was reported that Shaver intended to use Coquille on the lower Columbia river to bring logs out of creeks and sloughs, so that larger vessels could tow them to Portland.\\"Coquille Bought to Tow Logs to Columbia\\", The Bandon Recorder, February 22, 1916, page 1, col. 4. Although the length and beam of the vessel were unaffected, this reconstruction reduced the overall size of Coquille to 53 gross and 36 net tons.Annual List of Merchant Vessels (for year ending June 30, 1918). at page 94. The home port for Coquille was changed to Astoria. Sale by Shaver On February 28, 1918, Shaver Transportation sold Coquille to Knappton Mill and Lumber Company.\\"Coquille is Sold\\", Morning Oregonian, March 1, 1918, page 16, col. 3. The new owners placed Capt. J.H. Lamley in charge of Coquille, which they planned to use to tow log rafts the Grays and Deep rivers, both of which were Washington state tributaries of the lower Columbia river. This sale left nine boats in the Shaver flotilla. Coquille had been the only propeller-driven steamer belonging to Shaver.  Service with Knappton Towing  On May 2, 1919, when Coquille and another Knappton towboat, Defender were towing the hulk Ontepro down the Columbia River, the tow struck a drawbridge at Youngs Bay belonging to the Spokane, Portland & Seattle Railway.The Morning Oregonian, December 5, 1919, page 20, col. 2. On December 4, 1919, a lawsuit was filed against the Knappton Mill company in federal district court, which sought $8,756.37 in damages. Coquille remained in service with the Knappton Towboat Company as of July 1, 1922.\\"Tow Interests Are Merged\\", Sunday Oregonian, July 2, 1922, page 15, col. 1. Coquille was still registered as being in service in 1935, with a home port of Astoria, under the ownership of the Knappton Towing Co.U.S. Department of Commerce, Merchant Vessels of the United States, 1934-1935, at pages 46-47. Crew at that time was shown as five, and the vessel's machinery was listed as generating 225 horsepower. Knappton Towing's office was located at the foot of 14th Street, in Astoria.

Hydrogenics is divided into two business units: OnSite Generation and Power Systems. Onsite Generation is headquartered in Oevel, Belgium and had 73 full-time employees as of December 2013. Power Systems is based in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada, with a satellite facility in Gladbeck, Germany. It had 62 full-time employees as of December 2013. Hydrogenics maintains operations in Belgium, Canada and Germany with satellite offices in the United States, Indonesia, Malaysia and Russia. Business overview =OnSite Generation= The OnSite Generation business segment is based on water electrolysis technology, which involves the decomposition of water into oxygen (O2) and hydrogen gas (H2) by passing an electric current through a liquid electrolyte. The resultant hydrogen gas is then captured and used for industrial gas applications, hydrogen fueling applications, and is used to store renewable and surplus energy in the form of hydrogen gas. Hydrogenics' HySTAT electrolyzer products can be used both indoors and outdoors. =Power Systems= The Power Systems business segment is based on PEM fuel cell technology, which transforms chemical energy resulting from the electrochemical reaction of hydrogen and oxygen into electrical energy. (Edgar) Its HyPM products can handle electrical power outputs ranging from 1 kilowatt to 1 megawatt. The company also develops and delivers hydrogen generation products based on PEM water electrolysis. =Power to Gas= Power- to-Gas is an energy process and storage technology, which takes the excess power generated by wind turbines, solar power, or biomass power plants and converts carbon dioxide and water into methane using electrolysis, enabling it be stored. The excess electricity can then be held in existing reserves, including power and natural gas grids. This allows for seasonally adjusted storage of significant amounts of power and the provision of CO2-neutral fuels in the form of the resulting renewable energy source gas. History In 1988, Hydrogenics was founded under the name Traduction Militech Translation Inc. In 1995, it entered into the fuel cell technology development business and Traduction Militech Translation changed its name to Hydrogenics in 1990. In 2002, Hydrogenics acquired EnKAT GmbH, which formed its Hydrogenics Europe division. It also acquired Greenlight Power Technologies, Inc., a competing fuel cell testing business, in 2003. A year later, in 2004, the company acquired Stuart Energy, a manufacturer of hydrogen-generation products based on alkaline electrolyte technology. In 2007, Hydrogenics narrowed the focus of its fuel cell activities by exiting the fuel cell testing business and working more on forklift power and backup power markets. That same year, Heliocentris partnered with Hydrogenics and SMA Solar Technologie to incorporate Hydrogenics' fuel cell power modules into stationary backup power systems. In September 2010, Hydrogenics formed an alliance with CommScope Inc., a Hickory, North Carolina-based multinational telecommunications company. Per the alliance, CommScope invested US$8.5 million in Hydrogenics as part of a joint product development program. Hydrogenics signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Iwatani Corporation, a Japanese industrial energy company, in April 2012. The companies began to collaborate on hydrogen solutions in the Japanese energy market, including utility-scale hydrogen energy storage, hydrogen generation and fuelling, fuel cell integration, and industrial hydrogen generation. Later that month Hydrogenics and Enbridge Inc. entered into a joint venture to develop utility-scale energy storage beginning in Ontario. Under the agreement, hydrogen produced during periods of excess renewable generation will be injected into Enbridge's existing natural gas pipeline network. In June 2013, Hydrogenics announced that its Power-to-Gas facility was operational with the first direct injection of hydrogen into a gas pipeline. Hydrogenics entered into a joint venture with South Korea-based Kolon Water & Energy to provide power generation in that country in June 2014. In 2019 Hydrogenics was acquired in large parts by Cummins as part of their New Power division. Hydrogenics is now owned 81 % by Cummins and 19 % by Air Liquide. =Projects= In June 2000, General Motors and Hydrogenics released their codeveloped HydroGen1, a vehicle powered by a first generation proton exchange membrane fuel cell system. The following year, in October, the two companies developed low-pollution technology to power cars and trucks. In December 2002, Natural Resources Canada (NRCan) selected Hydrogenics to develop a next-generation hybrid fuel cells bus; Hydrogenics integrated its vehicle-to-grid technology into a 12.5 meter New Flyer Inverno 40i transit bus. Hydrogenics' FC Hybrid Tecnobus midibus was exhibited in Europe in 2005. In January 2010, Hydrogenics began development of a next-generation power system to be used for surface mobility applications on the moon for the Canadian Space Agency. The system includes an electrolyzer that produces both hydrogen and oxygen using solar power, and a fuel cell system that can be used for mobility, auxiliary, and life support systems. Heliocentris and FAUN Umwelttechnick collaborated with Hydrogenics to develop a hybrid waste disposal vehicle for BSR (Berliner Stadtreinigung) in August of that year. In July 2012, Hydrogenics joined a consortium with EU members to build the world’s largest steady state hydrogen storage facility in the Puglia region of Italy. The system is part of the R&D; smart grid project \\"INGRID.\\" In April 2013, Hydrogenics won a contract to supply a 1 megawatt hydrogen energy storage system to German utility E.ON in Hamburg. The system will use electrolyzers based on Hydrogenics' proton exchange membrane (PEM) technology for hydrogen production and use excess power generated from regional renewable energy sources, primarily wind energy. In November the first of E.ON's P2G facilities provided by Hydrogenics became operational. The Falkenhagen facility uses wind-powered electrolysis equipment to transform water to hydrogen, which is then mixed with natural gas. In February 2014, Hydrogenics was awarded two projects with the United Kingdom government. Hydrogenics will provide its technology to build hydrogen fuel stations throughout the UK. Hydrogenics was selected as a Preferred Respondent for a power-to-gas project in Ontario by the Independent Electricity System Operator. (IESO), a corporation responsible for operating the electricity market and directing the operation of the bulk electrical system in the province of Ontario, Canada, in July 2014.

It is also released by Google under the Noto fonts project as Noto Sans CJK. The family includes seven weights, and supports Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, Japanese and Korean. It also includes Latin, Greek and Cyrillic characters from the Source Sans Pro family. Design The Latin, Greek and Cyrillic characters are taken from the Source Sans Pro family, and adjusted to fit in with Chinese, Japanese and Korean (CJK) text. For example, in the normal weight Latin and Latin-like characters are scaled to 115% of their original size, hence they appear larger than Source Sans Pro at the same point size. For the Chinese, Japanese and Korean characters, the underlying design was designed by Ryoko Nishizuka from Adobe. Multiple type foundaries drew the glyphs for different languages based on the designs: Changzhou Sinotype and Arphic Technology for Chinese, for Japanese, and Sandoll Communications for Korean. Ken Lunde of Adobe consolidated the glyphs and created the final font resources, while Google provided funding, testing resources and input. 返 between different language versions of Source Han Sans Source Han Sans has five language versions: Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese for Taiwan, Traditional Chinese for Hong Kong, Japanese and Korean. Because of the different conventions and standards for each of the regions where the languages are used, the same character in Unicode may have a different shape for each of the language versions. The font family includes seven font weights: ExtraLight, Light, Normal, Regular, Medium, Bold, and Heavy. At its release, the fonts contains 65,535 glyphs, the maximum limit for CID-based fonts. The font current cover all of the characters in Unified Repertoire and Ordering of the Unicode Standard in version 2.001, but still doesn't cover all of CJK Compatibility Ideographs and extensions of the CJK Unified Ideographs. Release The 28-font OTC version of Source Sans Pro became available in version 1.001. Source Han Sans version 2.000 is a major update of the font family, the major changes include: * Several glyphs proposed for CJK Unified Ideographs Extension G were included and accessible via the 'ccmp' GSUB feature. * The Hong Kong flavor of Traditional Chinese was introduced. * The glyphs for bopomofo were redesigned. * The glyphs for half- width jamo were replaced. * Macintosh 'name' table strings were omitted. * Regular weight is style-linked to the Bold weight. * The deprecated 'hngl' GSUB feature was removed. * The 'vert' GPOS (not GSUB) feature was added to support combining jamo in vertical writing. * Some glyphs for newer versions of Unicode were added. Version 2.001 added a new character stands for Japanese era name Reiwa, and several glyphs for Hong Kong locale.

He had a cousin, also named Theophil Spörri (1887 – 1955) who was a prominent Swiss Methodist theologian and with whom he is sometimes confused. He had a nephew, from his mother's side of the family, called Daniel Isaac Feinstein. When the boy was 11 his father was arrested and killed. Daniel was then adopted by his uncle, Theophil Spoerri and changed his name to Daniel Spoerri. Daniel Spoerri subsequently gained prominence as an artist. Professional biography Theophil Spoerri studied at Zürich, Siena and Paris. He obtained his doctorate at Bern in 1916. His dissertation was published in Milan in 1918 under the Italian-language title “Il dialetto della Valsesia” (”The dialect of Valsesia”). Between 1912 and 1922 he worked as a high school teacher in Bern. Between 1922 and 1956 he was an Associate Professor of Romance Philology at the University of Zurich where his students included the future novelist Max Frisch. In respect of university administration he was made Dean in 1932, and university Rector between 1948 and 1950. Between 1942 and 1951, together with his colleague Professor Emil Staiger, he produced a quarterly publication entitled “Trivium. Schweizerische Vierteljahresschrift für Literaturwissenschaft und Stilkritik” (”Trivium: Swiss quarterly journal for literary knowledge and criticism“) Spoerri held an honorary doctorate from the University of Geneva (1950). He published several essays on Dante Alighieri, and was a holder of the Golden Dante-Medal (Florence 1962). Spoerri's religious upbringing gave him a powerful religious, social and political commitment. In 1940 he joined with others to form an anti-Nazi organisation called the Gotthard League, becoming its first president. He was also a member of the Neue Helvetische Gesellschaft (New Helvetic Society) and of the Oxford Group along with the Moral Re-Armament movement that grew out of it. The strong religious element in his make-up was also apparent in his academic research work which covered writers such as Blaise Pascal, Jean Racine, Dante Alighieri, Ludovico Ariosto und Torquato Tasso.

The bill was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. Background President Barack Obama, when arguing in favor of healthcare reform and talking about his signature legislation, the Affordable Care Act (ACA), Obama often said that \\"if you like your plan, you can keep it\\" in reference to individuals' health insurance plans. However, the ten requirements from the ACA meant that some existing health insurance plans were being forced to be discontinued. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Employee Health Care Protection Act of 2013 would permit a health insurance issuer that has in effect health insurance coverage in the group market on any date during 2013 to continue offering such coverage for sale during 2014 outside of a health care exchange established under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The bill would treat such coverage as a grandfathered health plan for purposes of an individual meeting the requirement to maintain minimum essential health coverage. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Energy & Commerce on July 30, 2014, with modifications reflected in Rules Committee Print 113-56 and an amendment (HR3522-RCP-AMD_01.XML) posted on the website of the Committee on Rules on September 8, 2014. This is a public domain source. H.R. 3522, as amended, would allow insurers to offer group health insurance plans that they offered on any date during 2013 until December 31, 2018, regardless of whether the coverage they provide complies with the market and benefit rules that took effect on January 1, 2014, under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Groups would be allowed to enroll in such plans even if they had not previously been covered by them, and people enrolled in those plans would be considered to be in compliance with the individual mandate imposed by the ACA, which requires most residents of the United States to have “minimum essential coverage” (as defined in that act) beginning in 2014. However, insurers would not be allowed to offer such coverage through health insurance exchanges. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation estimate that enacting H.R. 3522 would increase federal revenues by a total of $1.25 billion over the fiscal years 2015 to 2024. About $400 million of that increase in revenues would be off-budget (Social Security payroll tax collections are classified as off- budget). Pay-as-you-go procedures apply to H.R. 3522 because enacting the legislation would affect revenues. H.R. 3522 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act. Procedural history The Employee Health Care Protection Act of 2013 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on November 18, 2013 by Rep. Bill Cassidy (R, LA-6). It was referred to the United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce, the United States House Committee on Ways and Means, and the United States House Energy Subcommittee on Health. On September 8, 2014 the Committee reported the bill alongside House Report 113-580. The House voted on September 11, 2014 in Roll Call Vote 495 to pass the bill 247-167. There were twenty-five Democrats who voted in favor of the bill. President Barack Obama released a Statement of Administration Policy announcing that \\"if the President were presented with H.R. 3522, he would veto it.\\" Debate and discussion Rep. Cassidy, who sponsored the bill, said that the \\"legislation is about keeping a promise and doing right by the American people.\\" Cassidy said that they should \\"keep the promise to middle class workers and ensure that if they like their healthcare plan, they can keep it.\\" Opponents, such as Rep. Frank Pallone (D-NJ), argued that \\"this bill is nothing more than another political attack on the Affordable Care Act.\\" The Congressional Budget Office estimated that at least 2 million people would probably sign up for the health insurance plans that would once again be legal if this bill were to pass.

Its programming consists entirely of the linear feed offered as part of the WWE Network video streaming service. History and distribution The channel launched on August 12, 2014 using a dedicated channel within the existing Sportsnet PPV licence, similar to how Rogers initially distributed the Sportsnet World service. The channel is offered on a subscription basis on Rogers Cable and, according to Rogers, has been offered to all other cable, satellite, and IPTV service providers across Canada. Rogers has indicated that other providers have shown interest in carrying the channel, but that negotiations are ongoing and may \\"take some time\\". Rogers also sponsored an application by WWE to the Canadian Radio- television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to add the WWE Network (U.S.) linear channel as a non-Canadian programming service authorized for distribution, which will ultimately replace the Rogers-operated PPV channel. This application was published on September 10, 2014, and was open for public comment until October 10. The launch of WWE Network in Canada as a traditional cable TV channel is part of an exclusive Canadian distribution agreement between Rogers and WWE, which runs through 2024, and includes Rogers' Sportsnet 360 retaining exclusive rights to WWE's weekly programming (E!'s reality series Total Divas, which airs on its Canadian counterpart, owned by Bell Media, was not affected by this agreement). This means that Rogers controls the Canadian distribution of WWE Network and will not immediately be making it available on an over-the-top basis (i.e. without going through a service provider such as Rogers), though Rogers has not ruled out making it available via over-the-top (OTT) in the future. On November 26, 2014, The CRTC approved adding the WWE Network to the list of non-Canadian programming services authorized for distribution (the list), part of the approval for the WWE Network. Rogers confirmed that the WWE Network service that it proposed to distribute in Canada would broadcast the same content as that broadcast by the WWE Network service in the United States and that the service would complement its other offerings, such as various sporting programs on Sportsnet 360 and live events on pay-per-view. On December 17, 2014, the network launched on Eastlink, making it the first provider other than Rogers to carry it. On February 12, 2015, Rogers announced a carriage agreement with Cogeco, Shaw, Vidéotron and Telus. It launched for Telus TV, Videotron, Bell Satellite TV and Bell Fibe TV on February 25, Cogeco Cable on March 24, and Shaw and Shaw Direct on March 17.http://www.wwe.com/wwenetwork/expands-in-canada-27096674 As of March 9, 2015, those who have subscribed to the WWE Network, via a cable or satellite provider, can now access it through the over-the-top streaming service at WWE.com. This service is currently available to Rogers, Eastlink, and Optik TV subscribers, with more to be added in the future. As of late 2015 Sasktel has begun carrying the WWE Network. On March 23, 2017, WWE Network On Demand launched on Bell Fibe TV On Demand, Fibe TV App, Bell Satellite TV On Demand and Bell Aliant Fibe TV On Demand. Programming The channel itself carries approximately 20 hours of programming each day, seven days a week, drawn directly from the U.S. streaming service's linear channel. The subscription also includes access to a video on demand library with a limited number of offerings, accessible via cable set-top box (somewhat similar to the former WWE Classics on Demand package), but does not currently provide access to the Internet-based on-demand library.

It was founded by Uranus H. Crosby in 1865 with the goal of advancing the arts in Chicago by bringing opera to the city. The five-story building was designed by William W. Boyington and contained statues of painting, sculpture, music and commerce that welcomed visitors as they entered through the arch of the building. After holding only occasional performances, Crosby ran into many business difficulties that resulted in a decision to sell the building in 1866. The Crosby Opera House Art Association was formed to help Crosby sell the building by lottery. The lottery distributed over 210,000 tickets, awarding purchasers great works of art and even the building itself. After being sold back to Crosby by the lottery winner, A.H. Lee, the hall began producing more consistent performances. The opera house stood for less than six and a half years before it was destroyed in the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 and was never rebuilt. In 1989 the city demolished the deteriorated properties and have only recently made plans for redevelopment. During the city's twenty-year discussion regarding what to do with the property, it was used as an art studio for Chicago public school students and as a skating rink through the winter season. History Uranus Harold Crosby came to Chicago from Chatham, Massachusetts, on September 4, 1850. He did so on recommendation of his cousin Albert, who insisted that the city was well-cultured. Albert had arrived two years earlier to establish a liquor and tea trading house, Albert Crosby & Co. In 1851, the cousins established a liquor manufactory and the operation became the largest wholesale distributor of distilled alcohol and camphine. Despite his new-found wealth, Uranus Crosby was disappointed at the lack of culture that he was promised in Chicago. The growing city could offer little more than brothels, saloons, and gambling houses for entertainment. The area's only theater, built by John Blake Rice in 1847, had been destroyed in a fire shortly before Crosby's arrival. When Rice rebuilt the theater in 1851, Crosby was disappointed by Rice's lack of interest in exhibiting opera performances. James Hubert McVicker, a close friend of Crosby's who was a neighbor in the Briggs House hotel, built a playhouse. Crosby probably assisted McVicker with raising credit for the institution. By 1855, Rice had retired from the theater business, leaving his theater a house of novelty shows. McVicker's Theater became the cultural center of Chicago entertainment, but Crosby believed that the city was overdue for a grand opera house like the ones he knew back East. He selected a site on the north side of Washington Street between State Street and Dearborn Avenue, then embarked with architect William W. Boyington on a tour of opera houses in Union cities. Boyington then designed Crosby's Opera House with assistant architect John W. Roberts. The building itself was five stories. The first floor housed businesses like music publishers Root & Cady, the piano store of W.W. Kimball, and the restaurant of H.M. Kinsley. The second and third floors were occupied by business offices and the fourth floor was an art gallery equipped with studios for the artists. The 3,000-seat opera house was situated in the rear of the building. The center of the ceiling was a dome encircled by paintings of Beethoven, Mozart, Auber, Weber, Verdi, and Wagner. Surrounding it were frescoes that were painted by Otto Jevne and Peter M. Almini, who were partners in a Chicago decorating firm specializing in ornamental painting.Jevne and Almini, Chicago Illustrated A forty foot painting of Aurora, based on Guido Reni's fresco, was displayed at the front of the stage above the orchestra. Wellbaum & Bauman handled carpentry and masonry with cut stone work by L. H. Boldenweck. The structure cost $600,000 (), which ruined Crosby financially. =Early performances= Crosby's Opera House was scheduled to open April 17, 1865. The conductor Jules Grau would lead the inaugural series of Italian operas, performed by a company from New York City's Academy of Music featuring Clara Louise Kellogg. However, the assassination of Abraham Lincoln forced a three- day delay in the house's opening. Il trovatore was the first performance, followed by a four-week season with Lucia di Lammermoor, Il Poliuto, Martha, Norma, Faust, Linda di Chamounix, La sonnambula, I puritani, Un ballo in maschera, Dom Sébastien, Lucrezia Borgia, Ernani, and Fra Diavolo.Many of the performances were assessed by critic George Upton, a critic for the Chicago Tribune who arrived to Chicago in 1855 with a bachelor of music degree from Brown University. Upton favored Italian opera and had strong feelings against Wagnerian opera. Because the opera house did not employ a permanent company, performances were not consistently scheduled. In late May 1865, three comedies and a performance of Hamlet were staged as a benefit for the Chicago Sanitary Fair. Karl Formes gave concerts that September, followed by performances by the Hanlon Brothers comedy group. The Music Hall annex, intended mostly for lectures and concerts, was completed on November 29. It was here that Edwin Forrest made his first appearance in Chicago since 1848 on January 22, 1866 with a company led by John Edward McCullough and James Edward Murdoch gave a reading for charity on February 5, 1866. After its brief heyday, the opera house began to experience a lull in activity. Crosby had overestimated the demand for opera in the city. The public's disinterest in operatic performances paired with Crosby's inexperience as a theater manager contributed to Crosby falling further into debt. The opera house remained open between opera performances by programming minstrel shows like comedy acts, dancing, and theater performances. =The Crosby Opera House lottery= View of the auditorium and stage on the day of the lottery Crosby Opera House on the day of the lottery By May 1866, investors were weary of the leadership of Crosby, who failed to make significant profit on the property. The Crosby Opera House Art Association was formed and they organized a scheme to raise funds and dispose of property through a lottery. Instead of having people think they were gambling, they encouraged people to believe they were promoting culture in the city. For $5 a ticket, people would receive an engraving and had the chance to acquire the opera house or any of its holdings. Works from the art gallery wing were of particular interest. The lottery was very successful, and the association had to open branch offices in other cities to comply with the demand for tickets. In the meantime, the money raised helped the opera house to hold performances from Euphrosyne Parepa-Rosa and Pasquale Brignoli, which were free to anyone holding a ticket. The prizes, and their values advertised, were: Recognition, by Constant Mayer, was the sixth prize of the lottery. *First: Crosby's Opera House, valued at $600,000 plus $30,000 expected earnings per year of use *Second: Albert Bierstadt's The Yo Semite Valley, valued at $20,000. *Third: Jasper Francis Cropsey's An American Autumn, valued at $9,000 *Fourth: Christian Schussele's Washington Irving and His Friends, valued at $5,000 *Fifth: James McDougal Hart's Woods in Autumn, valued at $5,000 *Sixth: Constant Mayer's Recognition, valued at $5,000 *Seventh: William Holbrook Beard's Deer on the Prairie, valued at $4,000 *Eighth: Régis François Gignoux's Alpine Scenery, valued at $3,000 The drawing was originally scheduled for October 11, 1866, but because of high ticket demand it was delayed until January 21, 1867. The association distributed 210,000 tickets and offered three hundred and two prizes, with the opera house as the grand prize. 25,593 tickets were purchased by Crosby in hopes of maintaining ownership; the rest were sold. Most shops and businesses in Chicago closed so that employees could attend the event. Nineteen trusted public officials from around the country such as banker William F. Coolbaugh, former Lieutenant Governor of Illinois Francis Hoffmann, American Express agent J. C. Fargo, and historian David Pulsifer oversaw the drawing. On the morning of the 21st, special trains brought ticket-buyers from all over the country into the city. At precisely 11 AM the first ticket number was pulled out of a drum. This continued until 112 pieces of art were awarded to visiting patrons. Woods in Autumn was won by J. J. Taylor of Springfield, Illinois and Alpine Scenery was awarded to E. P. Dwyer of Chicago. Crosby maintained possession of The Yo Semite Valley, An American Autumn, and a sculpture of Abraham Lincoln by Leonard Volk, valued at $2,500. Deer on the Prairie was awarded to Daniel Russell of Boston, Massachusetts. A. H. Lee of Prairie du Rocher, Illinois had the winning ticket, #58,600, for the opera house. However, Lee's wife was ill and he had little interest in leaving her for Chicago. On January 25, 1867, he met with Crosby in Chicago and agreed to sell the house to him for $200,000. The public bought over $1,000,000 in chances on a $600,000 building. Subtracting the $200,000 given to A.H. Lee, Crosby paid off the construction cost and pocketed profits all while still maintaining ownership of the opera house. Given the convenience of the transaction, the public began to speculate as to whether or not A. H. Lee even existed or if Crosby had staged the outcome. Shortly after, Uranus Crosby returned to Massachusetts. =Later engagements= Adelaide Ristori made her first Chicago appearance the day after the lottery, January 22, 1867, as the lead role in Médée. James William Wallack and Edward Loomis Davenport gave a rendition of Othello on September 16. Edward Payson Weston held two receptions on November 28 after completing his walk from Portland, Maine. Patrick Gilmore's band, featuring Camilla Urso, began a series of concerts starting January 20, 1868. Fanny Janauschek performed for two weeks starting February 18. Works included Médée, Adriana Lecouvreur, Marie Stuart, Deborah, Love and Intrigue, and Emilia Galotti. Edwin Forrest made a final appearance in Chicago on March 23. The opera house was host to the 1868 Republican National Convention. Lydia Thompson was arrested after attacking Wilbur F. Storey following his scathing review in the Chicago Times of one of her performances. In November 1869, Lydia Thompson brought her troupe of dancers for a burlesque. She returned the next year on February 14. Thompson performed again on the 24th with Pauline Markham; after a particularly foul review by Wilbur F. Storey in the Chicago Times, Thompson and Markham assaulted Storey in the street. Four were arrested and the trial made headlines. In April 1870, the Germania Männerchor gave three performances of The Magic Flute. In May, they exhibited Stradella. In November, Marie Seebach presented Marie Stuart and Faust. Christina Nilsson sang three concerts in December 1870. Starting on December 28 and continuing for over a month, notorious businessman James Fisk leased the house for his production, The Twelve Temptations. Following the outrage over Rev. Lorenzo Sabine's refusal to accept the remains of actor George Holland, a charity event was held on February 16, 1871 at Crosby's, raising almost $2,000 in support of Rev. George Hendric Houghton at the Little Church Around the Corner. Charles Wyndham gave the last major performance, a two-week engagement with his English Comedy Company. =Destruction= In the summer of 1871, the opera house underwent alterations after $80,000 had been raised to lavishly redecorate the venue. An advertisement stated that the Crosby Opera House was to re-open on October 9, 1871 with a performance by Theodore Thomas. Theodore Thomas was on tour in early October 1871 and had planned to head to the opera house for a two-week series event of orchestral concerts for the reopening. However, two years of planning were wasted when a fire tore through the city on the night before the re-opening. By the evening of the next day, the Great Chicago Fire had destroyed over of the city, including Crosby's Opera House. When the fire bell alarmed on October 8th, many Chicagoans paid no attention since the summer had been particularly dry and there had already been several fires. A strong wind blew through the city and exhausted the firefighters' efforts. By Tuesday morning the fire had ended and nearly 300 people died, 100,000 were homeless, and Chicago's business district was in ruins. Chief usher James S. Osgood and Crosby went back to the opera house to save some of the art gallery. They took large pictures out of the frames and lowered them by rope out of the windows, eventually taking them to Garrisons House at 226 South Wabash Street. Thomas and his orchestra played a benefit concert at their next stop in St. Louis in honor of the Chicago area. It was never rebuilt, and there was no permanent venue for opera in the city until the Chicago Opera House opened in 1885.

SiS offers a number of different treatment plans and mandatory care, when voluntary intervention have failed, and the right to forcibly detain and isolate individuals has become necessary. Decisions regarding compulsory care is made by the administrative court, on the application of social services. SiS runs residential homes for young people with psychosocial problems, suffering from substance abuse problems, or having committed crimes, under the terms of the Care of Young Persons Special Provisions Act (abbreviated LVU) and the Secure Youth Care Act (LSU). SiS also operates homes for adults with alcohol abuse problems, substance abuse problems, or a combination of these under the Care of Substance Abusers Special Provisions Act (LVM).

The average time spent in these homes are around five months, and just over half are discharged within three months. Everyone is given a treatment plan based on their individual needs and circumstances, and treatment is planned together with the patient, family and social services. The most common therapeutic approach is cognitive behavioural therapy. Methods of treatment include: Aggression Replacement Training, Relapse Prevention, Motivational Interviewing and individual psychotherapy. Secure youth care Young people between the ages of 15 and 17, who commit serious criminal offences such as robbery, aggravated assault, rape, manslaughter or murder can be sentenced to a high- security youth care unit, managed by the SiS. As treatment progresses the person is moved to more open units, and aftercare is the responsibility of social services. Homes for adults with substance misuse Approximately one thousand adults with serious substance abuse problems are taken into care each year, and admitted to one of SiS homes for people with substance misuse problems, under the terms of LVM. Compulsory care is limited to a maximum of six months. During that time, the client is detoxified, receives care and medical treatment. The methods of treatment vary from patient to patient. Motivational Interviewing, Relapse Prevention, the Community Reinforcement Approach and 12-Step programmes are the most common methods.

The name derives from the former use as shot tower. In 1939 the production of shot balls in this tower was discontinued.  Building  In 1908 the company Bleigießerei und Maschinenfabrik Juhl & Söhne (Lead Foundry and Machine Factory Juhl & Sons), since 1901 owner of the property Nöldnerstraße (formerly known as Prinz-Albert-Straße) 15 & 16, built the rectangular, 38 metres high brick tower as part of the factory wing, an extension to their residential and office building. The tower protrudes out of the roof of the building by 18 metres. The platform at the top of the tower can be reached by walking 197 steps. The design of its facade follows the medieval design of North Italian towers, e.g. in Bologna and San Gimignano. During the days of the GDR the tower as part of a foundry belonged to the VEB Druckguß und Formbau (VEB Die Casting and Mould Making). The factory was a listed building. With the German reunification it was delisted. Since 1994 the residential building and the tower have become listed buildings once more. Due to extensive damage the tower was renovated between 1998 and 2000 at the cost of 230.000 DM. It is unique in the Berlin and Brandenburg region. The tower can be visited during the Tag des offenen Denkmals ( Doors Open Day as Germany's contribution to the European Heritage Days, usually on a weekend in September) and during guided tours by the Büro für Industriekultur.  Process of shot making  At the topmost storey of the tower lead was heated until molten and then poured into a drop tube. During the free fall the lead drops became seamless spheres. By the time they reached the water-filled basin at the bottom of the tower the balls had already solidified. Sodium sulfide and oil or tallow were added to the water preventing the oxidation of the shot balls. The windows in the tower have never been glazed, but were fitted with wooden slats thus providing a draught in the tower which assisted the cooling of the falling shot.

Unlike its predecessor, the Surface 2, Surface 3 utilizes an x86 Intel Atom system-on- chip architecture, or SoC, rather than a processor with ARM architecture such as the Nvidia Tegra that powered the Surface 2, and runs Windows 10.  History  The older, original Surface (also known as Surface RT) and Surface 2, with their ARM-based processors and Windows RT operating system, are pitched against the iPad and other tablets. The first Surface was criticized for performance issues though this was rectified in the succeeding Surface 2. The biggest problem was that these ARM-powered devices were incompatible with the vast number of programs written for x86 personal computers, while suffering from the limitations of the Windows RT operating system and its sparse application ecosystem. Released prior to Surface 3, the Surface Pro 3 (featuring a more powerful Intel Core processor) became a profitable business for Microsoft in late 2014. It had a starting price of $799, features a high- resolution ClearType display and competes with high-end ultraportable laptops like the Apple MacBook Air and other Ultrabooks. With the introduction of the Surface 3, Microsoft aims to make the Surface more affordable for those who don't need the power of the Surface Pro 3, at the expense of some performance. Surface 3 can be considered a closer competitor to traditional tablets like Apple iPad, with Surface 3 offering full desktop OS capabilities instead of a tablet's mobile OS.  Features  = Hardware = The Surface 3 share a similar design to the Surface Pro 3 with a body made of magnesium alloy giving a matte gray finish to the back of the device. It features a kickstand that can be set to three different angles: 22, 44, and 60 degrees. The Surface 3 does not have a fan, therefore lacking the ventilation holes seen on Surface Pro line. The Surface 3 weighs 620 grams features a diagonal multi-touch display with a 3:2 aspect ratio. For a charger Surface 3 uses a standard Micro-USB, giving users a wider variety of charging options, including charging the device with a mobile phone charger. Surface 3 has the 14 nm quad- core Intel Atom x7-Z8700 SoC. The Atom x7-Z8700 is able to drive up to three external displays over Mini DisplayPort and support a resolution of up to 4K with a single external display. The 2-in-1's own display has a resolution of 1920x1280. The device ships with either a 64 or 128 GB solid-state drive and 2 or 4 GB of system memory. The device's storage capacity can be increased by installing a microSD memory card of up to 200 GB. = Software = Unlike its predecessors, the Surface 3 is the first device in the non-Pro line to feature the full Windows desktop OS as opposed to Windows RT. This therefore puts the device into the category of 2-in-1 PC, which cannot be said for its predecessors, the original Surface and Surface 2, due to their use of ARM processors. Surface 3s purchased before 29 July 2015 come with Windows 8.1 but are upgradeable to Windows 10 for free from that date onwards. Since the Windows 10 release, consumer models of the Surface 3 now ship with Windows 10 Home, unlike the devices of the Surface Pro line, which ship with Windows 10 Pro. Business models of the Surface 3, however, now ship with Windows 10 Pro. = Accessories = Surface Pro 3 with red Type Cover. The Surface 3, as with its predecessors and Surface devices of a Pro line, features an optional Type Cover accessory—an attachable keyboard, which is also a protective cover for the screen, with an announced price of 129 USD. The Surface 3 is the first non-Pro Surface to feature a pen digitizer and hence supports the Surface Pen. Unlike Surface Pro 3, however, it is not included in the box, but is available for purchase separately. Various aftermarket USB or Bluetooth peripheral devices, such as keyboards and mice can be connected to the Surface 3.  Reception  Surface 3 received generally positive reviews from computer critics. They praised Microsoft's shift from ARM architecture toward x86, and therefore from Windows RT to a regular Windows OS. Most noted a well designed chassis and accessories produced of quality materials, and overall premium feeling of use. While less powerful, the Surface 3 was a lighter and cheaper alternative to the Surface Pro 3. More importantly, the Surface 3 could compete at the high-end of Android and iPad tablets, with the advantage of being a device running a full desktop OS instead of a mobile OS for a similar price.

The event took place on November 8, 2014, in Osaka, Osaka, at the Bodymaker Colosseum and featured eleven matches (including one dark match), five of which were contested for championships. It was the fourth event under the Power Struggle name. Storylines Power Struggle featured eleven professional wrestling matches that involved different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in the scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. The first matches for the event were revealed on October 14, 2014, the day after King of Pro-Wrestling. At King of Pro-Wrestling, A.J. Styles lost the IWGP Heavyweight Championship to Hiroshi Tanahashi, after a surprise return from NJPW original Yoshitatsu, who stopped his Bullet Club stablemate Jeff Jarrett from interfering in the match. The day after Styles' title loss, a match between him and Yoshitatsu was announced for Power Struggle. In pre-Power Struggle interviews, Yoshitatsu was given a new \\"Bullet Club hunter\\" character with him claiming that, while working for WWE, he had grown sick of seeing employees wearing Bullet Club shirts and was now looking to eliminate the villainous stable from professional wrestling. Also on October 14, the main event for January 4, 2015, and the Wrestle Kingdom 9 in Tokyo Dome show between IWGP Heavyweight Champion Hiroshi Tanahashi and the 2014 G1 Climax winner Kazuchika Okada was made official. At Power Struggle, the two were set to face off in a tag team match, where Tanahashi would team with Kota Ibushi and Okada with his regular tag team partner Yoshi-Hashi. The third match announced for the event would see Shinsuke Nakamura defend his IWGP Intercontinental Championship against Katsuyori Shibata. The match came as a result of King of Pro-Wrestling, where Shibata and Hirooki Goto defeated Nakamura and Yoshi-Hashi in a tag team match, after which Nakamura nominated Shibata as his next challenger. Nakamura and Shibata had previously faced off in a singles match on July 21, during the 2014 G1 Climax, where Shibata was victorious. In storyline the rivalry between the two dated back to a brawl in August 2004. On October 27, NJPW announced two more title matches for Power Struggle. In the first, Chase Owens was set to defend the NWA World Junior Heavyweight Championship against Jyushin Thunder Liger. Representing the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA), Owens made his NJPW debut at King of Pro- Wrestling, successfully defending his title against Bushi. Following the match, NWA president Bruce Tharpe nominated Liger as Owens' next challenger. The NJPW junior heavyweight veteran viewed this as an opportunity at one final run as a singles champion. As part of the relationship between NJPW and NWA, Liger had challenged Rob Conway for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship on September 29, 2013, at Destruction, but was defeated following a distraction from Tharpe. Liger had previously held the NWA World Junior Heavyweight Championship in early 1997 as one of the eight junior heavyweight titles in his \\"J-Crown\\". The second title match announced would see Tomohiro Ishii defend his NEVER Openweight Championship against Hirooki Goto. The match came as a result of a six-man tag team match on October 25, where Goto pinned Ishii for the win. Despite Goto claiming that he was only interested in Ishii, not his title, the match between the two was made with the championship on the line. Goto had recently entered a storyline, where he started leading a counterattack against the Bullet Club and Chaos stables, with the goal of revitalizing the NJPW Seikigun (\\"regular army\\"), which he represented alongside the likes of Shibata and Tanahashi. Prior to Power Struggle, Goto also tried to recruit Togi Makabe as part of his movement, which he dubbed \\"Revolution\\". Ishii, Nakamura and Okada, meanwhile, all represent Chaos. The rest of the matches were announced on November 4, following the conclusion of the 2014 Super Jr. Tag Tournament. Four matches at Power Struggle stemmed from the tournament, including two title matches. In the first, the tournament's winning team, reDRagon (Bobby Fish and Kyle O'Reilly), were set to challenge Time Splitters (Alex Shelley and Kushida) for the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship. reDRagon represented the American Ring of Honor (ROH) promotion and made their NJPW debut during the previous May's events co- produced by NJPW and ROH in Toronto and New York City. This match was a rematch from August 10, when Time Splitters successfully defended their title against reDRagon in Fish and O'Reilly's Japanese debut. In the second title match, Taichi was set to challenge Ryusuke Taguchi for the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship. At King of Pro-Wrestling, Taguchi made his first successful title defense against Taichi's Suzuki-gun stablemate El Desperado, despite being attacked before, during and after the match by both Taichi and Taka Michinoku. On October 25, during the first round of the 2014 Super Jr. Tag Tournament, Taguchi, teaming with Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) representative Fuego, faced off against the Suzuki-gun team of El Desperado and Taichi. Following outside interference from Michinoku and El Desperado hitting Taguchi with his own title belt, Taichi pinned him to win the match and afterwards demanded himself a shot at the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship, which was granted on November 4. Other matches announced included a tag team match continuing the rivalry between Suzuki-gun representatives Minoru Suzuki and Takashi Iizuka and the team of Kazushi Sakuraba and Toru Yano and an eight-man tag team match, where Bad Luck Fale, Doc Gallows, Karl Anderson and Yujiro Takahashi of Bullet Club were set to face Captain New Japan, Tetsuya Naito, Togi Makabe and Tomoaki Honma. Anderson had also announced that Bullet Club would be introducing a new member at Power Struggle. Event In the second match of the pay-per-view, Kazushi Sakuraba and Toru Yano defeated Suzuki-gun leader Minoru Suzuki and Takashi Iizuka. Sakuraba pinned Suzuki for the win with the Kido Clutch, the finishing maneuver of Universal Wrestling Federation (UWF) veteran Osamu Kido. UWF was a promotion that in the 1980s popularized shoot-style wrestling maneuvers in professional wrestling and where Suzuki had worked early in his career. Following the match, an enraged Suzuki challenged Sakuraba to an UWF-style grudge match. In the first title match of the event, Jyushin Thunder Liger defeated Chase Owens to win the NWA World Junior Heavyweight Championship, 17 years after he had last held it. In the second title match, Ring of Honor's World Tag Team Champions reDRagon captured the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship from Time Splitters, who failed in their fourth title defense. This marked the third year in a row when the Super Jr. Tag Tournament winner had captured the title at Power Struggle. Afterwards, reDRagon was challenged by both Forever Hooligans and The Young Bucks. In the next title match, Ryusuke Taguchi made his second successful defense of the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship against Taichi, despite outside interference from El Desperado and Taka Michinoku. Following the match, Bullet Club entered the arena to reveal their newest member, Kenny Omega. This marked Omega's first appearance under a NJPW contract, having joined the promotion at the start of the month. When his signing was announced on October 3, Omega dismissed the idea of joining Bullet Club, claiming that after six years of living in Japan, he no longer considered himself a gaijin and would therefore not fit in the stable of foreigners. However, now Omega claimed he had lied about loving NJPW and only wanted money and the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship. Taguchi agreed to defend his title against Omega. Next up, Yoshitatsu was defeated by Bullet Club's A.J. Styles in his first NJPW match in seven years, following outside interference from Jeff Jarrett, who had accompanied Styles to the match. After the match, Jarrett hit Yoshitatsu with his signature guitar, leading to Hiroshi Tanahashi, Tetsuya Naito and Tomoaki Honma coming out. While Tanahashi and Honma helped Yoshitatsu backstage, Naito confronted Styles. In the fourth title match of the event, Tomohiro Ishii made his first successful defense of the NEVER Openweight Championship against Hirooki Goto. After the match, Togi Makabe, who had accompanied Goto for the match, stepped up as the next challenger for the title. In the semi-main event of the evening, Hiroshi Tanahashi and Kota Ibushi defeated Chaos' Kazuchika Okada and Yoshi-Hashi, when Ibushi pinned Yoshi-Hashi for the win. Finally, in the main event, Shinsuke Nakamura made his first successful defense of the IWGP Intercontinental Championship against Katsuyori Shibata. The event concluded with Kota Ibushi entering the ring and performing a German suplex on the much larger Nakamura, before challenging him to a match for the IWGP Intercontinental Championship. Reception Dave Meltzer of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter called the match between Ishii and Goto a \\"match of the year candidate\\", only criticizing the decision to hold it at Power Struggle instead of the Tokyo Dome, claiming that it \\"can't be topped\\" by the teased match between Ishii and Makabe. Regarding the main event, Meltzer wrote that it was \\"missing something\\" and that it \\"[c]ouldn't hold a candle\\" to their previous G1 Climax match. Aftermath The day after Power Struggle, Ring of Honor announced that reDRagon and Time Splitters would face each other in a rematch on December 7 at Final Battle 2014, this time contested for the former's ROH World Tag Team Championship. reDRagon went on to win that match as well. On November 10, NJPW announced five more matches for Wrestle Kingdom 9 in Tokyo Dome, stemming from Power Struggle. These were Shinsuke Nakamura defending the IWGP Intercontinental Championship against Kota Ibushi, Ryusuke Taguchi defending the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship against Kenny Omega, Tomohiro Ishii defending the NEVER Openweight Championship against Togi Makabe, reDRagon defending the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship in a four-way match against Forever Hooligans, Time Splitters and The Young Bucks and Minoru Suzuki and Kazushi Sakuraba facing off in a match, which could only end by knockout, submission or referee stoppage. Following the events of King of Pro-Wrestling and Power Struggle, Hiroshi Tanahashi and Yoshitatsu announced they were forming a new tag team named \\"The World\\". During his match with A.J. Styles at Power Struggle, Yoshitatsu landed awkwardly on his neck while taking the Styles Clash finishing move. After initially trying to work through the injury, he was pulled out of the 2014 World Tag League and was hospitalized, upon which it was discovered that he had two broken bones in his neck.

As a three- year-old in 2007 he won the Prix du Jockey Club and Prix Jean Prat. Since being retired to stud he has made a good start as a stallion, siring Group 1 winners Most Improved, Just The Judge and Law Enforcement. Lawman was trained by Jean-Marie Béguigné and owned by Claudio Marzocco and Ernesto Ciampi. Background Lawman is a bay horse bred by Petra Bloodstock Agency and foaled on 9 May 2004. He was sired by Invincible Spirit, a sprinter who won the Duke of York Stakes and Haydock Sprint Cup in 2002. Since retiring from racing he has become one of Ireland's leading stallions, siring Fleeting Spirit, Kingman, Mayson, Moonlight Cloud and Vale of York. Lawman's dam is Laramie, a daughter of Gulch who raced in two maiden races, finishing seventh and fourth. Lawman was purchased as a yearling for €75,000 and was trained in France by Jean-Marie Béguigné. Racing career Lawman made his racecourse debut on 12 November 2006 in 1600-metre contest for unraced two-year-olds at Saint-Cloud. He won the race, which was his only start as a two-year-old, beating Vespucci by two lengths. Lawman's first race as a three-year-old was the Prix Machado, a 1600-metre race run at Longchamp on 29 March 2007. He finished the race in third place, two and a half lengths behind winner Chichi Creasy and one length behind runner up Brooklyn Boy. However the second and third placing were reversed, moving Lawman up to second place. In the Prix de Fontainebleau, Lawman was held up at the rear of the field by jockey Olivier Peslier. He ran on in the final 300 metres and took fourth place near the finish, with the race being won by Chichi Creasy. In the Prix de Guiche on 9 May 2007, Lawman set the pace and quickened clear in the finishing straight to win easily by two and a half lengths from Holocene, who just beat Chinese Whisper and Hurricane Fly to finish second. Lawman's easy win in the Prix de Guiche made him one of the favourites for the Prix du Jockey Club on 3 June 2007, when he was ridden for the only time by Frankie Dettori. As in his previous he led from the start and was driven along by Dettori 300 metres from the finish. He ran on well to win the race by one and a half lengths from second placed Literato. Shamdinan and Zambezi Sun finished just behind the runner-up in third and fourth place respectively. Lawman was ridden by Olivier Peslier again when he stepped back down in distance for the Prix Jean Prat on 8 July. As in his previous two races, Lawman was sent into an early lead by Peslier. He quickened clear 300 metres out and won easily by three lengths from Stoneside. Golden Titus was one and a half lengths behind Stoneside in third place, with pre-race favourite Astronomer Royal finishing fourth. In the Prix Jacques Le Marois about one month later, Lawman was near the front of the field for much of the race, but was out of contention with about 300 metres still to run. He eventually finish last of the six runners, approximately 13 lengths behind winner Manduro. Lawman was then being aimed at the Irish Champion Stakes and Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, but got an infection, causing his liver enzymes to rise, and was retired. Assessment Lawman was awarded an official rating of 120 for his win in the Prix Jean Prat, ranking him as the joint 34th best racehorse in the world in 2007. Stud career Upon retirement, Lawman was purchased by Ballylinch Stud and syndicated into 45 shares, with Ciampi and Marzocco retaining part ownership. He now stands as a stallion at Ballylinch Stud in Thomastown, County Kilkenny, Ireland for a stud fee of €25,000. His most notable progeny to date are: * Forces Of Darkness – a bay mare foaled in 2009. In 2012 she finished third in the Prix Saint-Alary and fourth in the Prix de Diane, before winning the Prix Minerve. *Most Improved – a bay horse foaled in 2009 who, after finishing third in the Dewhurst Stakes as a two-year-old, went on to win the St James's Palace Stakes as a three-year-old. He now stands as a stallion at Coolmore Stud for a stud fee of €6,000. *Just The Judge – a brown filly foaled in 2010. She was undefeated as a two-year-old in 2012, including a win in the Rockfel Stakes. She started 2013 by finishing second in the 1000 Guineas and then winning the Irish 1,000 Guineas. At Royal Ascot that year she finished third in the Coronation Stakes. She stayed in training as a four-year-old, finishing third in the Pretty Polly Stakes. * Law Enforcement – a bay gelding foaled in 2010 who won the 2012 Gran Criterium. * Us Law – a grey gelding who won the Prix Thomas Bryon and finished third in the Critérium International as a two-year- old. *Marcel, a bay colt who won the Racing Post Trophy. *Harbour Law, a bay colt who won the St Leger.

The population was 5,841 at the 2010 census. Rumford is home to both ND Paper Inc's Rumford Mill and the Black Mountain of Maine ski resort. History Bird's-eye view of Rumford Falls in 1905 Originally called New Pennacook Plantation, the township was granted in 1779 to Timothy Walker, Jr. and associates of Concord, New Hampshire. Both Pennacook and Rumford are former names of Concord, from which many early settlers arrived. The first pioneers, however, were Jonathan Keyes and his son Francis in 1782 from Shrewsbury, Massachusetts. Incorporated in 1800, the town would later annex land from Peru and Franklin Plantation. Located in the foothills of the White Mountains, Rumford is the site of Pennacook Falls, called by historian George J. Varney \\"the grandest cataract in New England,\\" where the Androscoggin River drops over solid granite. Bands of St. Francis Indians once hunted and fished here, where salmon spawn in the pool below Upper Falls, a barrier that fish cannot pass. Indians also came here to trade furs brought from the lakes region. Sawmills and gristmills were built to harness water power from the falls, although Rumford would remain primarily agricultural during its first 100 years. In 1882, industrialist Hugh J. Chisholm recognized the falls' potential for the manufacture of paper. Chisholm directed construction of the Portland and Rumford Falls Railway connecting Rumford to the national rail network in 1892. The first paper mill began operation in 1893, drawing an infusion of people and money into the sleepy community of about 200 residents. Oxford Paper Company, owned by Chisholm, would dominate Rumford's riverfront and economy. William Berry Lapham, History of Rumford, Oxford County, Maine: From Its First Settlement in 1779; published 1890. Much of the mill town was built in the spurt of prosperity at the turn of the century, and Rumford retains significant Victorian and Edwardian architecture. Most notable is Strathglass Park, perhaps the finest company housing in the nation. Wishing to avoid the stacked slums endemic at Lowell and Lawrence, Massachusetts, Hugh Chisholm commissioned Cass Gilbert in 1900 to plan a site in his company town, instructing the prominent architect that \\"We will build of brick and stone and slate, and we will provide not merely for a house, but for comfort, elegance and social gratification.\\" Named after the seat of Clan Chisholm at Strathglass Carries, Scotland, Gilbert in 1901 produced 5 designs for 51 duplexes, each with subtle differences. The same year, Chisholm founded The Rumford Realty Company to build the oval-shaped development, its entrance marked by an imposing granite gateway. With attractive lawns and broad, tree- lined streets, all maintenance was provided by the Oxford Paper Company. Even valet service was included. Tenants paid a rent of $9.00 per month, plus $1.00 per month to the Rumford Falls Power Company, also belonging to Chisholm. But in 1948, the incomplete development was no longer economically viable, and the houses were sold for between $3,400 and $3,900 per duplex. In June 1941, the cabin cruiser \\"The Don\\" sunk off of Harpswell, Maine with 34 residents of Rumford on board. It remains the largest loss of life in the town's history. The cause of the wreck was never determined but multiple theories abound as to the vessel's demise including it being sunk by a U-boat or an insurance scheme. The only communication from the boat was shortly after it left port when a radio distress call came out to nearby ships with a voice saying \\"If I don't get off this boat somebody's gonna get thumped.\\" Recognized for unique architectural and social merit, in 1974 Strathglass Park was added to the National Register of Historic Places as a historic district. Today, much of the history of Rumford is preserved by the Rumford Historical Society. Founded in 1961, under the sponsorship of prominent residents Louis Thibodeau, Minerva Anderson and Jonathan Mackenzie, the society pledges to preserve the rich history of the western mill town and encourage community involvement among all.

It is a bulbous perennial. Taxonomy In June 2004, a joint University of Reading and Natural History Museum funded group (including Dr Stephen Jury – Reading University's Herbarium Curator) was sent on an expedition to Morocco in 2004. They found a group of irises similar in form to Iris serotina, in north Morocco (north of the Kebdana Mountains), at a height of 90m above sea level. Dr Jury sent a sample of the new iris to Dr Pablo Vargas,(a former Reading University student), now working on related Spanish irises in Madrid. Later, in 2006, another team from Real Jardin Botanico de Madrid (Spanish for Royal Botanical Garden of Madrid) travelled to the same area and found the same species of iris. Then a detailed morphological, phylogenetic and karyological research was carried out on specimens of this iris species. It was found to be distinct from Iris serotina. It was then published (and described) jointly by Jorge Martin Rodriguez, Pablo Vargas, Mark Carine and Stephen Jury in 'Candollea' Vol. 64: 128 in 2009. It has been named after named after Mr Ronald Rutherford, who has been a botanist working at the School of Biological Sciences. He is also Deputy Curator of Reading University's Herbarium. The newly named Iris rutherfordii is included in an account being prepared in French by Reading botanists for the 'Flore Pratique du Maroc', Morocco's first complete Flora. Iris rutherfordii is not yet an accepted name by the RHS, as of October 2014. Description Iris rutherfordii has a brown bulb (19–27 mm × 12–18mm) with a paper-like covering. It has 2–3 whitish narrow leaves (which reach up to 35–40 cm long and 1.2–3 mm wide), surrounding a stem about 40–50 cm long. The blue flowers which emerge in June, have a perianth tube about 1.5–4 mm long. It has purple-blue limbs with white nerve-like stripes. The standards are blue. It has yellow pollen and cylinder-like seed capsules which fruit in July. Native Iris rutherfordii was found near (the city of) Nador, Rif(region) in North Morocco, a small population (about 50 plants in 2006) growing in open grassland with rocky soil at altitudes of between 50–100 m above sea level. It is beside a recently widened road, so may be in endanger of extinction. The population of iris meets the criteria for 'Critically Endangered', set by IUCN(International Union for Conservation of Nature).

Founded in 2013 and headquartered in London, United Kingdom, the company is privately owned and operated by Fluentify LTD. The platform offers online language classes with selected native speakers.  History  Fluentify was founded in February 2013 and launched into public beta in May 2013. The same month, the company was selected to join London-based Accelerator Academy for three months of training. In March 2014, Fluentify announced that it had raised $410k in angel funding from the banker Stefano Marsaglia. Marsaglia is a prominent M&A; banker, currently the co-head of corporate and investment banking at Mediobanca, Italy’s biggest publicly traded investment bank.  Working as a tutor  Fluentify runs on a marketplace platform model where it connects students and tutors and enables transactions without hiring any tutor individually. Unlike traditional language schools and online tutoring websites, Fluentify scales not by increasing its inventory or number of employees but by increasing the number of students and tutors and matching them with each other. The company claims that top tutors can earn up to £2,500 per month.  Media attention  In September 2013, the company was selected from more than 200 nominations to take part in the TechCrunch Competition in Rome. GiPStech, a startup that developed an advanced indoor positioning technology based on the world's geomagnetic field, won the $50k prize. In January 2014, the company was shortlisted for the BT Infinity Lab program, a competition promoted by the British multinational telecommunications company BT Group. Fluentify and its founders have received consistent media coverage in Italy. In April 2014, two of its founders were invited as guests in the prime time TV program Che tempo che fa, one of the most popular shows in Italy hosted by Fabio Fazio.

Hampden is part of the Bangor metropolitan statistical area. History The town was originally called Wheelersborough after its original settler, Benjamin Wheeler. It was incorporated on February 24, 1794, and named after the English patriot John Hampden. During the War of 1812, on September 3, 1814, about 400 local militia under the command of Brigadier General John Blake of nearby Brewer attempted to hold off a superior force of British regulars at Hampden. The American line, however, collapsed before a charge and was quickly routed. The Americans suffered one fatality with eleven wounded, and the British lost two (one an officer). A civilian spectator was also killed. The British fleet, which under command of Sir John Coape Sherbrooke (then lieutenant governor of Nova Scotia) had recently captured Castine, looted Hampden and nearby Bangor. They were trying to capture the USS Adams, a frigate with 750 men which had fled up the Penobscot River and anchored at Hampden. The crew of Adams, under Captain Charles Morris, burned the ship to prevent her capture and subsequently escaped overland. General Blake and two other officers, Lieutenant-Colonel Andrew Grant of Hampden and Major Joshua Chamberlain of Brewer (grandfather of Civil War general Joshua L. Chamberlain), were court- martialed in Bangor in 1816 for their part in the defeat. Blake and Chamberlain were both exonerated, but Grant was cashiered.

Brought to the Ottoman court at a young age, Şehabeddin started as a court eunuch (hadım), then advanced to become Kapi Agha, a close advisor to the Sultan, before being appointed governor (sanjakbey) in Albania, and then at the height of his career, provincial governor (beylerbey) of Rumelia (1439–42). Şehabeddin was known as ardent supporter of the expansionist policy of Ottoman Empire. He commanded the Ottoman forces that captured Novo Brdo in 1441. After his forces were heavily defeated in a battle with forces of Janos Hunyadi in September 1442, he was dismissed from the position of beylerbey. After 1444 he was again briefly appointed to the position of beylerbey of Rumelia. Şehabeddin died in 1453 in Bursa.  Name and early life  Şehabeddin is commonly identified also as Kula Şahin Paşa. In some sources the nickname \\"Kula\\" was mistakenly translated as \\"brown falcon\\", although kula (not kule) is actually a reference to his slave origin (kul), because he was a devşirme conscript. \\"Şahin\\" is the common shortening of his name, \\"Şehabeddin\\". The founding inscription at the Kirazli mosque dated 1436–37, commonly identified as the foundation of Şehabeddin, names his father \\"Abdullah\\". He was brought to the Ottoman court at very young age, as a slave, and was probably of Georgian descent. He completed the Enderun School and served as a court eunuch (thus honourably titled hadim) in the sultan's harem and palace.  Military career  Türbe of Hadim Şehabeddin in Plovdiv He advanced in the court hierarchy and became Kapi Agha (the head of the Inner Palace and the eunuch gatekeepers) which was the most powerful position a slave could reach at the Ottoman court. At this position he was the channel for all petitions to the sultan, which provided him with an opportunity to have certain influence to both the sultan and petitioners. The first position of Şehabeddin outside the sultan's palace was in Gjirokastër, as the sanjakbey (governor) of Sanjak of Albania. In 1439 he was appointed to the highest military position in the empire, the beylerbey (provincial governor) of the Rumelia Eyalet. Şehabeddin has been known as one of the \\"falcons\\" in the sultan's palace and advocate of the aggressive expansionist Ottoman policy. Being hadim meant that he had access to sultan's family which included his son known as Mehmed the Conqueror, in whom he might have planted the seed of thirst for expansion of the empire. Against the orders of Şehabeddin the Ottoman forces captured and garrisoned medieval fortress Žrnov, located on the highest top of Avala (in Serbia), and enforced its fortifications under the Pasha's direct supervision. On 13 June 1441 Şehabeddin, who was in Vučitrn at the time, wrote a letter to the Ragusans in which he guaranteed safe conduct to Ragusan diplomats. On 27 June 1441 forces under the command of Şehabeddin captured the mining district of Novo Brdo, after having looted and burnt the town itself. Şehabeddin received Ragusan diplomat Primović in Dobrijevo near Vučitrn and advised him that Ragusans should \\"honor sultan\\" with rich presents if they want to avoid paying tribute to Ottoman Empire. They took his advice and after a lot of efforts reached agreement with veziers and sultan to send them rich presents every year. Saraçhane Bridge On 2 or 6 September 1442 an army commanded by Şehabeddin and sixteen sanjakbeys subordinated to him, sent by sultan Murad II sent to Wallachia to kill Vlad II Dracul, was heavily defeated near Ialomița River by the forces led by Janos Hunyadi. After this defeat Şehabeddin was dismissed from the position of beylerbey of Rumelia. In 1444 Şehabeddin appeared as commander of the forces that fought against Orhan, the challenger of the sultan's throne and again as beylerbey of Rumelia, in Varna. His advocacy of the aggressive expansionist policy made him the main rival of Çandarlı Halil Pasha the Younger. He died in 1453 in BursaSAHABETTİN PAŞA (Hadım) after he had witnessed the success of the expansionist policy he has always been advocating when Ottomans captured Constantinople and executed his main rival Çandarlı Halil Pasha.  Legacy  Şehabeddin built a mosque in 1436 in Adrianople. It is known as Hacı Şahabettin Camii or Kirazlı Cami (). Evliya Celebi recorded that in Plovdiv Şehabeddin build a mosque, madress, han and caravansaray which were all named after him. In 1451 the Saraçhane Bridge across the Tunca river in Edirne was built against orders of Şehabeddin.

It is the only Llamasoft game so far to include a level editor. The title screen gives the game's full name as \\"Buck! The story of GoatUp 2\\", a reference to the arcade game Rainbow Islands, and the game's interface and appearance resemble that platform with the exception that the font is the same Namco Galaga font used in Super Ox Wars. Gameplay The player controls a goat, resembling the goat from the original GoatUp, which can freely move and jump around a 2D scrolling level. The objective is to collect a number of flashing objects (which have a different appearance on each level) and then to go to the level exit, represented by a London Underground sign. Enemies exist on the platforms and kill the goat immediately on contact; the goat also has a \\"hunger\\" meter, resembling the one included in Sheep in Space, which causes the goat to die if too much time passes without eating grass. Grass is found on most platforms and is eaten automatically but does not reappear once eaten. Collected objects form a trail behind the goat; other objects collected can also join the trail without contributing to completion of the level. By tapping while the goat is in the air the user can cause the goat to fart, performing a midair jump and also releasing a burst of particles downwards which can harm enemies beneath. There is no limit to the number of midair jumps that can be performed in sequence as long as the player has enough objects available. The gameplay is based on interactions with these and other objects, which include: * Chicken Vindaloo, which grants unlimited farting for a period; * Goat kids, who increase the score multiplier for the stage; * Gravity redirectors that adjust the direction of gravity; * The Queen's head, which prevents farting; * Minotaurs, which award substantial bonus points; * Cups of tea, which make the goat briefly invulnerable. Level Editor GoatUp 2 includes a level editor which allows all items that appear within the main game to be placed. The game also contains a set of levels that serve as a tutorial for both using the editor and designing enjoyable levels. However, the game does not support iCloud or any other networking service, requiring the iOS device to be connected via USB to a computer in order to upload, download or share levels. User engagement with the Level Editor has been low and few levels have been built or exchanged.

China controls 97% of the production of these elements. The US, EU and Japan argued that the restrictions were a violation of the WTO trade regulations, while China stated that the restrictions are aimed at resource conservation and environmental protection. In 2012, the Obama administration filed a case with the Dispute Settlement Body of the WTO. In 2014, the WTO ruled against China, which led China to drop the export quotas in 2015. The 2010 episode generated increased investment in rare earth developments outside China. Thus, this episode also shows that rare earths embargoes are a weapon of limited effectiveness in the long-term and can also backfire. Products at issue The rare earth elements (or rare earths) are 17 elements that have magnetic and conductive properties. They are used extensively in electronic gadgets such as cellphones, and in national defense equipment. Despite their name, the elements are not so rare, as they can be found widely. However, they are not often found in economically exploitable concentrations. Their mining is also environmentally hazardous. The rare earths were discovered and first put to industrial use in the United States. But lower labor costs and less strict environmental regulations in China have now enabled the country to be the world's predominant supplier of rare earths, accounting for 97% of the current supply. History of the dispute China had levied duties and implemented quotas on exporting rare earth elements since 2006. Dispute arose when the Chinese government reduced its export quotas by 40% in 2010, sending the rare earths prices in the markets outside China soaring. The government argued that the quotas were necessary to protect the environment. Critics charged, however, that the move was protectionism in disguise. The difference in prices inside and outside China gave unfair advantage to Chinese firms. The American news program 60 Minutes broadcast a segment on the dispute in which the news anchor said that, due to the ubiquity of the use of the rare earths, especially in weaponry, the Chinese restrictions posed a national security threat to the US. China was accused of unofficially banning of rare earths exports to Japan during a diplomatic standoff between the two countries after the 2010 Senkaku boat collision incident, though China denies such reports. Critics pointed at this incident to argue that China was not above using its dominance in rare earths production to gain leverage in international negotiations. The WTO case The US brought a case to WTO's Dispute Settlement Body against the Chinese restrictions. The European Union and Japan also joined the case on the US side. The US argued that the Chinese restrictions were in breach of the accession treaty that China had signed when it joined the WTO in 2001. The treaty disallowed export duties and quotas, except for goods specifically listed. Rare earths were not among the goods specifically listed. China argued that its restrictions were legal because WTO regulations allow countries to impose export duties and quotas for reasons of conservation and to protect plant, animal, and human safety. The Dispute Settlement Panel ruled against China. Though the Panel acknowledged that countries are allowed to restrict exports for reasons brought up by China, the Panel was not persuaded that the Chinese restrictions served those reasons. It is true that countries have the right to restrict mining for reasons of conservation and safety, but once the material is out of the ground, WTO member governments could not discriminate between domestic and foreign firms in giving access to the mined resource. China's restrictions gave its domestic firms preferential access to the rare earths, which was against the principle of “non-discrimination” that WTO members are obligated to follow. Response to the WTO ruling China expressed disappointment with the ruling (NYT) and filed an appeal repeating its conservation argument. The Appellate panel of the WTO, however, upheld the ruling. The US Trade Representative hailed the ruling as a victory for openness and fairness around the world. China dropped its export restrictions in January 2015. As a result of the higher prices China charged outside of China prior to the WTO ruling, many rare earth mining companies in the U.S. and Europe were able to raise capital, and in some instances publicly, through stock sales. Chevron Mining spun off the Molycorp-owned Mountain Pass rare earth mine as a free-standing public company in 2008. However, in response to the WTO action and this growth in competition, China dropped the price of rare earths significantly, making these entities less attractive for investment and, in the case of Molycorp, unsustainable, forcing it into bankruptcy in June 2015. In June 2017, the Molycorp mine was sold out of bankruptcy at auction and was purchased by MP Mine Operations LLC, a company in which Shenghe Resources Holding Co., a Chinese minority shareholder, is granted the exclusive right to market all rare earths from the mine. In popular culture The rare earths dispute formed part of the storyline in Season 2 of the Netflix series House of Cards (Real Clear World) and Call of Duty: Black Ops II. From February to May 2015, the Thyssen Bornemisza Museum ran an art exhibition titled RARE EARTHS related to the dispute, featuring seventeen commissioned works, one for each element. Contemporary artists from The European Union, China, Mexico, Congo and Russia contributed works. Artist and political activist Ai Weiwei was among the artists who contributed.

The type species, Llanocetus denticrinatus, reached gigantic proportions, with the juvenile specimen reaching an estimated in length; a second, unnamed species, known only from three isolated premolar teeth, reached an estimated total body length of up to . Like contemporary baleen whales, Llanocetus completely lacked baleen in its jaws. It was probably a suction feeder like the modern beaked and pygmy right whales. History Llanocetus was described in 1989 by paleontologist Edward Mitchell based on the braincase and a partial mandible with two teeth, specimen USNM 183022, from the La Meseta Formation of Seymour Island, Antarctica. Dating back to the Late Eocene, it is the second-oldest known baleen whale, behind Mystacodon. However, Mitchell classified it into the new infraorder Crenaticeti as an intermediary between Archaeoceti–the forerunners of modern whale types–and more modern baleen whales, but Crenaticeti was later invalidated in 2016. The genus name is in honor of the American biologist George A. Llano who helped Mitchell gain access to the specimen. The species name derives from Latin denti, teeth, and crena, notch, in reference to the tooth shape which is similar to the crabeater seal. The complete skull was described in 2018 by paleontologists Robert Ewan Fordyce and Felix Marx. It is grouped into the Eocene family Llanocetidae along with Mystacodon and an as yet undescribed specimen OU GS10897 from New Zealand. Though Mitchell, based on the size and density of the bone, thought the specimen was an adult, Fordyce and Marx concluded it was a juvenile due to the loss of both epiphyses–which are the surfaces that the vertebra connects to the other vertebrae to–on the single preserved neck vertebra. Description Llanocetus had several ancient characteristics reminiscent of archaeocetes. The dental formula, , indicating number of, in order, incisors, canines, premolars, and molars in one half of a jaw, is similar to basilosaurid archaeocetes. However, the broad snout is unlike archaeocetes. Wearing patterns on the cheek teeth, the molars and premolars, indicate they sheared passed each other while biting, which would have given Llanocetus the ability to slice through flesh, and serration wearing indicates a gripping function. It had wide gaps (diastema) between the teeth. Its teeth had one of the thickest enamel layers of any known baleen whale, 830–890 μm at the top and 350–380 μm at the base, which is also consistent with a shearing action. It had a crest on the mandible which may have supported proper musculature to pucker its lips. All baleen whales have in their mouth palatal sulci, which carry blood, between tooth sockets, which has generally thought to be indicative of baleen. However, in Llanocetus, these sulci are present within the tooth sockets, meaning sulci are not always indicative of baleen, and the whale probably did not have baleen. Palatal sulci are generally associated with large gums, and this enhanced blood supply in these early whales may have eventually led to the secondary evolution of baleen in later whales. The estimated minimum length for this juvenile specimen is , comparable to a modern-day adult minke whale, and exceeding the size of most whales until the Late Miocene. For most of the Oligocene and Miocene, whales generally stayed well below in length. Large size in baleen whales was thought to be linked to the evolution of baleen and bulk feeding behavior, however Llanocetus is evidence that gigantism evolved multiple times in baleen whales. The size of Llanocetus is probably due to its polar environment or potential long-distance traveling. Paleobiology Llanocetus, when it was first described, was thought to have been a filter feeder with a similar mechanism to the modern crabeater seal, based on the notched teeth which Mitchell thought fit together to strain food out of the water. However, it is now thought to have been a suction feeder, and similar facial structures are seen in the modern day suction feeding beaked whales and the pygmy right whale. It may have used a combination of suction feeding and raptorial behavior–whereby it used its teeth to hunt prey. Paleoecology The La Meseta Formation represents the Eocene, which spans 48 to 34 million years ago (mya). The area probably was a cool-water environment, unlike modern Antarctica, with the still-forming Humboldt Current cycling cold, nutrient-rich water. The specimen was found in what probably was a river delta in a lagoon, protected from waves by shoals. The formation displays a diverse elasmobranch (sharks and rays) assemblage, the most common found being angelsharks, Pristiophorus sawsharks, and sand sharks, mainly cool-water fauna, though some warm-water immigrants were found, such as the zebra shark. Bony fish are not as common. The leatherback sea turtle Psephophorus was found. The most common seabirds were giant penguins.

Leeman (born May 9, 1930) is an American endocrinologist considered one of the founders of neuroendocrinology.  Early life and education  Susan Leeman was born Susan Epstein in Chicago in 1930. Her mother was born in the United States and her father had emigrated from Russia to New York City. Her father was an academic metallurgist and her mother attended college at George Washington University at a time when few other women did. When Leeman was six weeks old she and her family moved to Columbus, Ohio before moving to Bethlehem, Pennsylvania when she was six. A Jewish family, they were the target of antisemitism. Leeman received her bachelor's degree from Goucher College 1951 and her masters degree and PhD from Radcliffe College in 1954 and 1958 respectively.  Career  Leeman began her career at Harvard University in 1958 but moved to Brandeis University the following year where she stayed for the next 12 years. In 1972, having not yet received a full position, Leeman returned to Harvard as an assistant professor until 1980. She then left the medical school when she realised that she would not be offered a tenure there either, gaining a tenured professorship in physiology at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. In 1992 Leeman left Massachusetts to help start the pharmacology department at Boston University. In 1974 Leeman discovered the structure of substance P – a peptide whose discovery won Ulf von Euler the Nobel Prize in 1970. She also discovered another peptide, neurotensin. As a result of her work Leeman is considered one of the founders of the field of neuroendocrinology.  Awards  Leeman became the first woman elected to the National Academy of Sciences in physiology and pharmacology in 1991. She was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1987. In 1993 she won the FASEB Excellence in Science Award and in 2005 won the Committee on Women in Neuroscience's Mika Salpeter Lifetime Achievement Award.

Distillex Ltd. operated a chemical recovery service, annually recycling 10,000 tonnes (11,023 tons) of oxygenated, hydrocarbon, and halogenated solvents and 1,000 tonnes (1,102 tons) of other chemical wastes produced by manufacturing industries and laboratories. The plant was situated in the middle of a largely residential area. Fire The fire was caused by sparks from an angle grinder igniting solvent-contaminated rags in a waste skip. This spread rapidly to a storage area holding 400,000 litres of chemicals. The fire was compounded by chemicals mixing with melting plastic from intermediate bulk containers. =Emergency services response= Northumbria Police immediately declared a Major Incident, and set up a half- mile exclusion zone around the factory, causing the evacuation of around 500 residents. More than 150 police officers were deployed to patrol the exclusion zone while 300 fire fighters tackled the fire.Major Incident is an emergency services and emergency planning term used in the UK to describe \\"an emergency that requires the implementation of special arrangements by one or more of the emergency services which may also involve other agencies such as Local Authorities, the National Health Service, the Environment Agency, military and voluntary agencies\\". As the fire spread through the factory there were a number of explosions which launched containers and drums into the air and a thick plume of toxic smoke, visible more than 20 miles away, was produced. Both the Tyne and Wear Metro light rail system, between Tynemouth and North Shields, and the Tyne road tunnel beneath the River Tyne were closed down while the fire was active. A 5-mile (8 km) no-fly zone was also placed over nearby Newcastle International Airport. It took 25 fire appliances 5 hours to bring the fire under control, and damping down continued through the following day. Investigation On 15 April 2002, the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) began an investigation of the fire. On the same date Chris Nicholls, operations director at Distillex, told BBC Radio Newcastle that the solvents recycling operation would not continue and admitted: \\"Seeing the aftermath of this incident it would seem it is an inappropriate location for such an operation.\\" =Prosecution= Following the investigation the HSE prosecuted Distillex for 2 breaches of the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 for failing to ensure the safety of the public and its own employees. Although Distillex pleaded guilty, magistrates at North Tyneside magistrates court instead referred the case to a crown court judge after deciding the maximum £40,000 fine they could impose was insufficient. In November 2002, at Newcastle Crown Court, Judge Peter Bullock fined the company a total £39,000. Alan Campbell, the MP for Tynemouth, said that the judge had been \\"far too lenient\\". He added: \\"I was there on the day of the fire and saw the damage and disruption it caused to North Tyneside. It was a huge risk to public safety. This is another example of the law being clear, penalties being available and courts failing to use the powers available to them.\\" Previous incidents On 30 January 2002, the factory was the source of a release of harmful chemical vapour after a tank containing methyl chloride overheated. The incident was reported at 6.40 am GMT and required 50 firefighters to bring it under control. A 1-mile cordon was set up by police around the factory and residents warned to stay indoors with all doors and windows closed. The Tyne and Wear Metro station at Tynemouth and nearby schools were closed.

When announcing the schools under investigation, Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Catherine E. Lhamon suggested that \\"increased transparency will spur community dialogue about this important issue... and foster better public awareness of civil rights.\\" Investigations previously went unannounced, and were known only to members of university and college communities. This list constitutes the first time the federal government has announced ongoing sexual violence investigations. The decision to release the names of universities and colleges under investigation was due to pressure from both the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault and the New Campus Anti-Rape Movement.

It lies on the right bank of the Olza river, in the historical region of Cieszyn Silesia and has a population of 855 (2001).  History  It could have been first mentioned in a Latin document of Diocese of Wrocław called Liber fundationis episcopatus Vratislaviensis from around 1305 as item in Cula sunt XL mansi, de quibus monachi de Orlavia XVI) mansos ab antiquo habent, reliqui vero spectant ad mensam episcopalem. It meant that the village had 40 smaller lans, and that it was from long time obliged to pay a tithe from 16 of the lans to the Benedictine abbey in Orlová, and from the rest to bishops. So it was obvious that the village was much older, probably it could have been established in the 12th century, or even in the tribal era, when the Golensizi tribe dwelled in the area. It could have been also (re)settled by Benedictine abbey after it was founded in Orlová in 1268.I. Panic, 2010, p. 430 It was later mentioned as Czulaw in 1439. It became a seat of a Catholic parish, which was mentioned in the register of Peter's Pence payment from 1447 among 50 parishes of Teschen deaconry as Czula. Afterwards this name disappears in sources, and the large and developed village is often regarded to be lost in the following centuries. Its connection to Staré Město is uncertain and disputed, however it had to lay somewhere not far from it. Concurrently to the Cula/Kula/Czula village Staré Město was first mentioned in 1406 as Antiqua Civitate prope Freyenstad civitatem, later in 1434 as Altstadt, in 1447 as Stari Frystath and in 1450 as Stare miesto.R. Mrózek, 1984, p. 164 The name, Old Town, indicates that it could have been originally intended to be the ground for the location of the town of Frienstad (Fryštát), but as it soon proved to be prone to flooding the town was located on the grounds of Ráj (Ray) village instead. Politically the area belonged initially to the Duchy of Opole and Racibórz and Castellany of Cieszyn, which was in 1290 formed in the process of feudal fragmentation of Poland and was ruled by a local branch of Piast dynasty. In 1327 the duchy became a fee of Kingdom of Bohemia, which after 1526 became part of the Habsburg Monarchy. Ondra Foltýn, who sparked a peasant revolt in 1766 which led to a partial abolishment of socage in the region, was born here. After the Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire, a modern municipal division was introduced in the re- established Austrian Silesia. The village as a municipality was subscribed at least since 1880 to political district and legal district of Freistadt. According to the censuses conducted in 1880, 1890, 1900 and 1910 the population of the municipality grew from 1,150 in 1880 to 2,864 in 1910. In terms of the language spoken colloquially the majority were Polish-speakers (between 91.5% and 93.8%), accompanied by German-speakers (at most 138 or 6.1% in 1890) and Czech-speakers (between 1.9% and 3.1%). In terms of religion, in 1910 the majority were Roman Catholics (95.1%), followed by Protestants (112 or 3.9%) and Jews (25 or 1%). After World War I, the fall of Austria-Hungary, the Polish–Czechoslovak War and the division of Cieszyn Silesia in 1920, the village became a part of Czechoslovakia. Following the Munich Agreement, in October 1938 together with the Zaolzie region it was annexed by Poland, administratively organised in Frysztat County of Silesian Voivodeship. The village was then annexed by Nazi Germany at the beginning of World War II. After the war it was restored to Czechoslovakia. In 1948 it was merged with Fryštát and a few other settlements to form a contemporary town of Karviná.

Career Berder was born in 1989 in Morlaix, and grew up in the nearby city of Quimper. A very energetic child, she was pushed by her parents toward sport. Her first choice was rock climbing, but the class was full, so she opted for fencing at Escrime Quimper Cornouaille. She first tried foil, the traditional teaching weapon, but found it boring. Coach Serge Larher suggested she try sabre, even though the class had only boys. After her baccalauréat, she joined the centre for promising young athletes in Orléans, where she trained with the likes of Anne- Lise Touya and Léonore Perrus. She won the bronze medal in the 2007 Junior European Fencing Championships at Prague. In 2008, Berder was selected as reserve for the Beijing Olympics. The same year, she took her first national senior title. In the 2009 World Championships at Antalya, she climbed her first international podium with a team silver medal after France was defeated in the final by Ukraine. The next season, Berder climbed her first podium in the World Cup with a bronze medal in the Orleans Grand Prix, hosted by her own club. France was defeated again by Ukraine in the 2010 World Championships at home in Paris, this time in the semi-finals. In the small final, they overcame the United States, weakened by the injury withdrawal of Olympic champion Mariel Zagunis, to earn the bronze medal. In 2011, Berder made her way to the final of the Orléans Grand Prix, where she was defeated by Zagunis. In the 2013–14 season Berder won her first World Cup title in Antalya, defeating reigning Olympic champion Kim Ji-yeon along the way. She also earned her first medal in the European Championships with a team silver in Strasbourg. In the World Championships, she got to the table of 16, a personal best to date, but was stopped by Zagunis. In the team event, France defeated Hungary, then host Russia and Italy to meet the United States in the final. France stood their ground for most of the match, leading 20–15 at some point, before giving way in the seventh leg. They were eventually beaten 39–45. Berder finished the season 16th in world rankings, a personal best. Berder is pursuing a master of journalism at the École supérieure de journalisme de Paris. Berder is competing at the 2016 Summer Olympics. She defeated Ibtihaj Muhammad in the second round.

Although they share a name it is not directly connected to the Party of New Forces in France. Emergence The PFN first emerged in 1975 under the name Forces Nouvelles, initially operating as a coalition of like-minded extremists rather than a political party.Christopher T. Husbands, \\"Belgium: Flemish Legions on the March\\", Paul Hainsworth (ed.), The Extreme Right in Europe & the USA, Pinter, 1992, p. 133 Early members of the group had come from the Front de la Jeunesse.Piero Ignazi, Extreme Right Parties in Western Europe, Oxford University Press, 2006, p. 128 Its early years were dominated by internal struggles, resulting in the group doing little publicly between 1975 and 1980 due to this strife.Elisabeth Carter, The Extreme Right in Western Europe: Success Or Failure?, Manchester University Press, 2005, p. 75 In 1979 the group was instrumental in the formation of Eurodroite, an alliance of European far-right political parties that also included the Italian Social Movement (MSI), the French PFN and Fuerza Nueva amongst others.R. Chiarini, 'The Movimento Sociale Italiano: A Historical Profile', L. Cheles, R. Ferguson & M. Vaughan, Neo- Fascism in Europe, Harlow: Longman, 1992, p. 38 Ideology Ideologically the party tended towards the neo-fascist or neo-NaziCarter, The Extreme Right in Western Europe, p. 59 end of the far-right and sought early contact with the MSI. It celebrated the heritage of Rexism and shared with it contempt for parliamentary democracy and support for corporatism in economics. The group also adopted a strongly anti-American strain to its discourse. Whilst anti- immigration has been at the centre of its appeal the PFN has also focused on anti-Semitism and has been active in promoting Holocaust denial. Its anti- immigrant rhetoric frequent included calls to biological racism. Repatriation of immigrants was a central part of their position.Carter, The Extreme Right in Western Europe, p. 33 The group has also campaigned vigorously against abortion. Elections The group contested the 1989 regional elections but failed to attract much support, capturing only 1.1% of the vote in Brussels. The PFN spent much of the 1980s competing with the Front National for votes and tended to come off worse. Thus in Brussels in 1985 the PFN won 0.7% of the vote to the FN's 0.5% (the FN having been formed only that year) but by the 1988 municipal elections this had shifted to 0.5% for the FN to 0.9% for the FN whilst by 1991 the FN had won seats in the Chamber of Representatives.Husbands in Hainsworth, Extreme Right, p. 134 Nonetheless it did manage to gain pockets of local support, with its vote rising as high as 15% in some districts. Decline The PFN supported the use of publicity stunts in order to raise its profile and took a stand at the Brussels International Book Fair where its stock of Holocaust denial material attracted police attention. A scuffle broke out when the police attempted to remove the stall, with the incident widely covered in the Belgian press. The incident however exacerbated internal divisions and in 1989 Willy Freson and the Liege group of the PFN split to form their own movement, Agir. Robert Destrouder, a member of the PFN secretariat, also switched over to this new group. After 1989 the PFN continued to decline, with many party members switching allegiance to the FN thereafter.Ignazi, Extreme Right Parties, p. 129 Having been seriously weakened by these splits and having failed to make any headway in the elections it contested the PFN formally dissolved in 1991. Following its disappearance some members joined the Walloon Regional Front, a short- lived group that was itself absorbed by the FN in 1993 whilst others went into a new group, Renouveau Nationaliste (formed in 1993), a group closely associated with the French and European Nationalist Party.Institute of Jewish Affairs, Antisemitism World Report 1994, Institute of Jewish Affairs, 1994, pp. 14-15 References Category:Defunct political parties in Belgium Category:Far-right political parties in Belgium Category:Francophone political parties in Belgium Category:Holocaust denial in Belgium Category:Neo-fascist parties Category:Political parties established in 1975 Category:Political parties disestablished in 1991 ","title":"Party of New Forces (Belgium)"},{"id":"43443048","text":"The , later published as the Hawaii Times, was a Japanese-English language newspaper based in Honolulu, Hawai'i. Established as the Yamato Shimbun by Shintaro Anno in 1895, the paper began as a six-page semi-weekly printed on a lithograph machine, and changed hands four times before being taken over by Yasutaro \\"Keiho\\" Soga in 1905. Soga changed the name of the paper to the Nippu Jiji, Japanese for \\"newspaper for telling timely news,\\" on November 3, 1906, and under his direction the paper was expanded to a twelve-page daily printed on a rotary press with a circulation of 15,000.Nakamura, Kelli Y. \\"Nippu Jiji (newspaper),\\" Densho Encyclopedia. Retrieved 31 July 2014. The paper gained prominence through its support of the territory-wide strikes of sugarcane plantation workers in 1909 and 1920, publishing sympathetic editorial columns and featuring extensive reports on the often slave-like living and working conditions of the, in many cases indentured, laborers.Azuma, Eiichiro. \\"Japanese Immigrant Press,\\" in Asian Americans: An Encyclopedia of Social, Cultural, Economic, and Political History, ed. Xiaojian Zhao and Edward J.W. Park (Greenwood, 2013), pp 630-32. Also active in covering legislative attempts to curb the practice of Japanese language education in the islands (and the subsequent lawsuit against the territorial government), the Nippu Jiji became a key source of information for Japanese Americans in Hawaii before World War II and continued to wield a significant influence through the war years and after. The paper ceased operations in 1985. Early history In its early years, the Nippu Jiji was a paper directed at Hawaii's Japanese plantation workers. These laborers and, later, their families, made up the bulk of its subscription, and so the paper's content was largely catered to their interests and concerns. In 1909, exploitative conditions on the plantations was at the top of the list, and under Yasutaro Soga's direction the Nippu Jiji became active in disseminating information related to the newly formed labor movement. The paper published in-depth accounts of the conditions in the fields and company housing, pushing the issue further into the public eye and pulling plantation owners and haole politicians into the debate. The strike failed, although it was the first to unite workers from multiple plantations and the island-wide work stoppage ultimately cost plantation owners $2,000,000 and forced them to make some concessions.Nakamura, Kelli Y. \\"Hawaii Hochi (newspaper),\\" Densho Encyclopedia. Retrieved 25 September 2014. Soga was convicted of conspiracy to incite violence for his role in organizing the strike, and sentenced to ten months in Oahu Prison. Some ten years later, the Nippu Jiji similarly supported a second, also unsuccessful, strike. In 1919, the Nippu Jiji became the first Japanese language newspaper in Hawaii to introduce an English section, an attempt to reach out to American-born Nisei and, in Soga's words, \\"promote better understanding between the Japanese and the Americans.\\"Tamura, Eileen. Americanization, Acculturation, and Ethnic Identity: The Nisei Generation in Hawaii (University of Illinois Press, 1994), pp 71-75. It was also a move to counteract widespread distrust of Japanese Americans, heightened by Japan's military successes in Russia and China, as well as the fact that the immigrant Issei and their children had by then become the islands' largest ethnic group. In 1921, Lawrence M. Judd (then a territorial senator) introduced an American Legion backed bill to require all foreign language publications to provide full translations of their content. Part of a larger movement to \\"Americanize\\" Hawaii's large and multi-ethnic immigrant population, the bill would have forced publishers to either expand at a tremendous cost increase or shrink their foreign language section to make room for the translations, and Soga editorialized against it. (The bill was later changed to require translations only from newspapers whose publishers had previously been convicted of violence, intimidation or promoting distrust between groups of people. Soga's 1909 conspiracy conviction, and the law itself once passed, were largely ignored.) Soon after, the Nippu Jiji became involved in a political controversy regarding the 163 Japanese language schools then operating in Hawaii. The territorial legislature began imposing restrictions on instructor certifications, textbook content, and the amount of time students were allowed to spend at Japanese school in 1920 (after several unsuccessful attempts to pass more restrictive laws in 1918 and 1919).Kimura, Yukiko. Issei: Japanese Immigrants in Hawaii (University of Hawaii Press, 1992), pp 186-89.Niiya, Brian. Japanese American History: An A-to-Z Reference from 1868 to the Present (New York: Facts on File, 1993), p 190. The Federal Commission of Education declared in 1920 that the 20,000 students attending these schools were being \\"retarded in accepting American customs, manners, ideals, principles, and standards.\\" In April 1923, the territorial legislature enacted the Clark Bill, establishing a per-student tax on the language schools and forcing schools unable to afford the tax to close.Nakamura, Kelli Y. \\"Japanese language schools,\\" Densho Encyclopedia. Retrieved 2 September 2014. Some teachers and parents elected to push back and sued to repeal the restrictions; the Nippu Jiji, drifting away from the leftist stance it took during the sugar strikes, printed articles opposing litigation and urging the community instead to work with the politicians who had drafted the laws. World War II and later years Martial law was declared in Hawaii a few hours after the December 7, 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, and Governor Joseph Poindexter conceded his authority to Commanding General Walter Short. Five days later the Nippu Jiji, along with every other Japanese-language newspaper, was forced to close. Yasutaro Soga and others at the paper were interned. However, the military government soon discovered that without the Japanese newspapers they had no way of communicating with the many Issei who could not read English, and on January 9, 1942 the Nippu Jiji and its main pre-war rival, the Hawaii Hochi, were ordered to reopen and operate under Short's directives. Military supervising staff were assigned by the censorship office, and took over administration of the newspaper and much of the English writing. Existing staff members translated the English articles into Japanese, which were then sent on to FBI or Army linguists for approval before going into print. As part of the military government's policy of pushing for the assimilation and Americanization of the Islands' Japanese American population, both papers were forced to change their names to English titles, and on November 2, 1942 the Nippu Jiji became the Hawaii Times (and would continue to publish under this name until its closure). With the Hawaii Herald (formerly the Hawaii Hochi) as its only competition during the war, the Times maintained its place in the community as an influential and widely read newspaper, and continued to reach a large audience for years after the war. The paper closed in 1985, and nearly 30,000 photos and documents left behind were claimed by University of Hawai'i at Manoa Professor Dennis M. Ogawa and the Hawaii Times Photo Archives Foundation.

The center studies several diseases that affect American wildlife including bat white nose syndrome, chronic wasting disease (CWD), avian influenza, and sylvatic plague, among others. In addition to the study of disease, NWHC has the capability to diagnose the causes of mass wildlife die-offs. This is done via necropsy and the work of several pathologists, biologists, and other scientists. The scientists are able to run toxicology, heavy metal and tissue analyses to determine cause of death. A notable instance of this capability in use was during the mass die-off of birds, primarily red-winged blackbirds, in Beebe, Arkansas, on December 31, 2010. The NWHC determined the die-off to be the result of blunt trauma, most likely caused when the birds were frightened out of their nests at night by fireworks.  Honolulu Field Station  In addition to the main facility in Madison, Wisconsin, the NWHC maintains a field station in Honolulu, Hawaii.

The bill would provide $2.7 billion in supplemental funding. The bill was introduced into the United States Senate during the 113th United States Congress. The House bill \\"Making supplemental appropriations for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2014 (H.R. 5230; 113th Congress)\\" is intended to address the same issues as this one. Background The children's immigration crisis refers to the surge in unaccompanied children from Central America seeking entrance to the United States. The surge has increased rapidly, doubling in volume each year, reaching crisis proportions in 2014 when tens of thousands of women and children from Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador migrated to the United States. Many of the children had no parent/legal guardian available to provide care or physical custody and quickly overwhelmed local border patrols.6 U.S.C. § 279(g)(2) The provisions of H.R. 7311, William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008, signed into law by George W. Bush give substantial rights and protection to unaccompanied children from countries which do not have a common border with the United States. This made expeditious deportation of the large number of children from Central America difficult and expensive, prompting a call by President Barack Obama for an emergency appropriation of nearly $4 billion and resulted in discussions on how to interpret or revise the 2008 law in order to expedite handling large numbers of unaccompanied children. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2014 would appropriate supplemental funds for FY2014 to specified federal agencies and programs to respond to the increased apprehensions of unaccompanied children and minors along the southwestern border, fight wildfires, and support Israel's Iron Dome anti-missile defense system. The bill would provide appropriations for the United States Department of Justice (DOJ); the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS), including U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE); the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS); and the United States Department of State to cover necessary expenses to respond to the significant rise in unaccompanied children and adults with children at the southwest border. The bill would provide appropriations for the U.S Department of Agriculture's (USDA's) Forest Service to cover anticipated wildfire suppression funding shortfalls if funds previously provided for wildfire suppression will be exhausted imminently and USDA notifies the appropriations committees of the need for additional funds. The bill would amend the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 to require certain adjustments to discretionary spending limits for FY2015-FY2021 for wildfire suppression operations in the wildland fire management accounts at the United States Department of the Interior and the USDA. The bill would provide appropriations for the Department of Defense (DOD) to assist the government of Israel with procurement of the Iron Dome defense system to counter short-range rocket threats. The bill would designate funding provided in the Act as an emergency requirement pursuant to the Balanced Budget And Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. The bill would specify authorized, restricted, and prohibited uses of appropriated funds. Procedural history The Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2014 was introduced into the United States Senate on July 23, 2014 by Senator Barbara Mikulski (D-MD). On July 28, 2014, President Barack Obama released a statement of administration policy in support of the bill, urging \\"Congress to act swiftly to pass the bill to allow a timely and effective response to these pressing needs.\\" Debate and discussion On July 9, 2014 a hearing on the crisis was held by the United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. The testimony of Statement of Craig Fugate Administrator, Federal Emergency Management Agency U.S. Department of Homeland Security was that \\"We are talking about large numbers of children, without their parents, who have arrived at our border—hungry, thirsty, exhausted, scared and vulnerable.\\"Statement of Craig Fugate Administrator, Federal Emergency Management Agency U.S. Department of Homeland Security Senator Dianne Feinstein compared the crisis to the American refusal to accept Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany aboard the MS St. Louis. The President's request for additional funds was met in both houses of Congress by proposals to modify or eliminate the rights granted by the 2008 reauthorization of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 A 2014 Mother Jones article suggests many of these unaccompanied children are attempting to escape abusive situations. Analysis of Border Patrol statistics shows a correlation between gang-related killing of children in Central America, particularly San Pedro Sula in Honduras, and the surge in migration. The bill would provide $2.7 billion in supplemental funding, about $1 billion less than the $3.7 billion requested by President Obama. President Obama supported the bill anyway, despite the lower funding amount. According to the administration, \\"this bill responsibly addresses the humanitarian situation without injecting partisan provisions that are unworkable and would increase costs without solving the problem.\\" The Administration compared this bill favorably with the House bill \\"Making supplemental appropriations for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2014 (H.R. 5230; 113th Congress)\\".

The team's head coach]was Ron Hunter serving his fourth season at GSU. The Panthers played their home games at the GSU Sports Arena competing as members of the Sun Belt Conference. They finished the season 25–10, 15–5 in Sun Belt play to win the Sun Belt regular season championship. They defeated Louisiana–Lafayette and Georgia Southern to become champions of the Sun Belt Tournament. They received an automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament where they defeated Baylor in the second round before losing in the third round to Xavier. Preseason notes * Despite playing at Louisville during the 2013–14 season, shooting guard Kevin Ware was granted an NCAA waiver to play immediately at Georgia State due to hardship resulting from an internationally witnessed compound fracture in his leg during a 2013 NCAA tournament Elite Eight game against Duke. Though returning the following season after partial recovery, Ware only saw limited minutes early in the season, and suffered a major setback in a mid-December game against Missouri State, when he was kicked in the same right leg that had been fractured. He did not play for the rest of the season, making him eligible for an NCAA hardship waiver, popularly known as a \\"medical redshirt\\". He withdrew from the team entirely after the end of the season, choosing to transfer out, and chose Georgia State because the school was close to his family's current Atlanta-area home. =Preseason rankings and accolades= *Georgia State was voted unanimously in the preseason conference coaches poll to win, picking up all 11 votes. *Junior R. J. Hunter was voted preseason basketball player of the year as well as the conference player of the year. *R. J. Hunter and Ryan Harrow were both selected for the preseason all conference first team. Curtis Washington was selected for the preseason all conference third team. Season notes *During the regular season opener on the 15th of November, the Panthers beat the regular season record for margin of victory against Tennessee Temple, beating them by 60 points. The previous record was set in 1986 against Piedmont. *During the regular season opener on the 15th of November, the Panthers set a school record for assists at 27. *During the conference game against Arkansas State, RJ Hunter tied the school record for total points made during his career at 1,515, tying him with Rodney Hamilton. His record currently stands at 1,620. *During the January 31st game against Arkansas State, Ryan Harrow scored his 1,000th career point, being the second-fastest Panther in school history to make the mark. *During the February 14th win against Texas State, R. J. Hunter set a new record for 3-point attempts in a career at 642. =Regular season championship title= Toward the end of the regular season, three teams would find themselves tied for first place. ULM, Georgia Southern and Georgia State were all in a position to win the championship, which brought with it a number 1 seed in the Sun Belt Tournament, as well as an automatic bid to the NIT if that team did not win the conference tournament. Heading into the first matchup against first place instate rivals Georgia Southern, the Panthers found themselves half a game behind, with a win over the Eagles set to push them ahead in the rankings to first place. While the Panthers held the lead for most of the game, including a 6-point lead at the half, the Eagles surged at the end in front of a sellout crowd of 4,325 to win the game, 58–54. Georgia State celebrating winning the regular season Sun Belt basketball title in spring 2015 The loss set the Panthers back behind both ULM and Georgia Southern. The following Saturday, ULM would beat the Eagles in Statesboro, giving the Warhawks first place in conference, followed by the Eagles and finally the Panthers in third. Following that point, both teams would lose two more games with the Panthers only losing one, creating a three- way tie going into the final week of Sun Belt play. A scheduling quirk would have Georgia State play at ULM on the final Thursday of regular season play, followed by Georgia Southern at home on the final Saturday. Prior to the Thursday game against ULM, it was announced that the Sports Arena, the home court of the Panthers, was sold out for the game against Georgia Southern. The Panthers would go on to beat ULM as the Eagles beat UT-Arlington, pushing the Warhawks out of first place with no chance to recover, and making the final regular-season game at the Sports Arena the determining game for the winner of the Sun Belt regular season title. The GSU women's basketball game would precede the men's game, with fans pouring in before that game had begun. During the first half of the game, leading Sun Belt scorer Ryan Harrow fell with an injury to his knee, being helped off the court and unable to put pressure on his leg. He would check back into the game with 4:40 remaining in the first half only to be taken back out after 2 and a half minutes for the rest of the game. Without Harrow, the Panthers finished the first half with an 11-point lead. However, after returning for the second half, the Eagles would cut that lead to four with a score of 38–34 after back-to-back three-pointers were scored along with a two-point jumper. R. J. Hunter went on to pull the lead back by scoring 10 consecutive points, after which the Eagles did not threaten again. Sun Belt commissioner, Karl Benson, was on hand to present the Sun Belt trophy to the team after the win, which gave the Panthers back-to- back Sun Belt Basketball regular season titles. = Regular season awards and accolades= *Ryan Harrow was named the Atlanta Tipoff Club's Georgia Men's College Player of the Year *R. J. Hunter was awarded the Sun Belt Player of the Week award three times over the course of the regular season *R. J.

Hunter was named Sun Belt Male Student-Athlete of the Year by the Sun Belt Conference for the second year in a row. *Ryan Green was included in the Sun Belt Conference's leadership team. Sun Belt Tournament Due to the Sun Belt Conferences tournament format, only the top eight basketball teams were eligible to compete, with the top two seeds receiving double byes straight into the tournaments semifinals. After competing for the conference regular season title in the final regular-season game, Georgia State and Georgia Southern received those top seeds, respectively. The Panthers faced Louisiana-Lafayette in their first game, the same team that had eliminated them from the title game of the previous season's Sun Belt Tournament. The Panthers would end up beating the Ragin' Cajuns 83–79 after allowing them to come back in the final minutes. Georgia Southern would beat ULM in their first game, setting the Panthers and the Eagles for a rematch of the unofficial regular season title game. The game would be one of the lowest scoring tournament games since such statistics have been tracked, ending in the Panthers favor with a final score of 38–36. After the final buzzer rang, the Panthers' head coach Ron Hunter rushed off the sidelines to embrace his son R. J. Hunter and began hopping as they met, both falling on the floor. It would be reported later that he had torn his Achilles tendon during the celebration. This, along with the dominating performance of Kevin Ware in the title game, would surround the Panthers in the media during the run up to the NCAA Tournament, where the 14 seed would face third seed Baylor. NCAA Tournament The Panthers would face Baylor in Jacksonville, Florida, at Jacksonville Veterans Memorial Arena. While the game was kept close throughout the first half, Baylor managed to take a three-point lead at half time by throwing up a buzzer-beating three- pointer that bobbled its way into the basket. After pulling away from the Panthers in the second half, Baylor would watch Georgia State claw its way back into the game in the final two minutes, erasing a 12-point deficit and making it a two-point game with under a minute left. After sending Baylor to the free throw line with less than 20 seconds remaining, the Panthers got the ball to R. J. Hunter, who drained a deep three-point shot with 2.8 seconds remaining to take a 1-point lead. While watching the ball go into the net, coach Ron Hunter, sitting on a stool due to his injured Achilles tendon, fell off the stool onto the court. The Panthers would pull off the upset, beating Baylor 57–56 and continuing into the third round of the tournament. The events on the court would make the team \\"the darlings of the NCAA Tournament\\", shooting the Panthers, and especially R. J. and Ron Hunter into fame. Numerous memes and videos would be made in reference to Coach Hunter's fall, while the father-son story would result in news specials and national exposure to the team. The Panthers faced Xavier in the third round of the tournament, where their season ended with a 67–75 loss. Aftermath After the season ended, attention to the Hunter family and the Georgia State program grew almost immediately as the TV channel covering the game switched its feed over to the post game press conference, airing video of a crying Ron Hunter explaining how proud of his team and his son he was. As the week continued, it would turn out that Georgia State would be the fourth most mentioned team on Twitter after Iowa State, Kentucky, and UAB respectively. At the same time, the second and fourth most talked about moments of the tournament were Georgia State beating Baylor and R.J. Hunter hitting the game winning three-pointer, respectively, while R. J. Hunter was the most talked about player in the tournament. Stories were run in local and national media, having interviews with Ron and R. J., as well as articles on the trainer that helped Ron up after his fall from the stool after he fell, and the reaction to R. J.'s game winning shot of the Georgia State men's golf team. After arriving back in Atlanta, it was reported that Hunter would meet with the Athletic Department of Georgia State to plan for ways to keep Georgia State at a high level in basketball, and also to negotiate Hunter's contract. It was later reported that Hunter had negotiated raises for his assistant coaches, and put pressure on the administration to begin the process of building a practice facility for the basketball team and improving the Sports Arena for the coming season. It was later reported that Ron and R. J. would join the Turner Sports broadcast team as guest analysts in their Atlanta studio during the following weeks games.

The bill was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. Background 3D tsunami simulation A tsunami, also known as a seismic sea wave, is a series of water waves caused by the displacement of a large volume of a body of water, generally an ocean or a large lake. Earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and other underwater explosions (including detonations of underwater nuclear devices), landslides, glacier calvings, meteorite impacts and other disturbances above or below water all have the potential to generate a tsunami. Tsunami waves do not resemble normal sea waves, because their wavelength is far longer. Rather than appearing as a breaking wave, a tsunami may instead initially resemble a rapidly rising tide, and for this reason they are often referred to as tidal waves. Tsunamis generally consist of a series of waves with periods ranging from minutes to hours, arriving in a so-called \\"wave train\\". Wave heights of tens of metres can be generated by large events. Although the impact of tsunamis is limited to coastal areas, their destructive power can be enormous and they can affect entire ocean basins; the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami was among the deadliest natural disasters in human history with at least 290,000 people killed or missing in 14 countries bordering the Indian Ocean. Summary of provisions The bill authorizes the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to continue through 2017 its on-going programs to forecast tsunamis. The bill would authorize NOAA to spend $27 million a year on this program over fiscal years 2015, 2016, and 2017. Procedural history The Tsunami Warning, Education, and Research Act of 2014 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on July 31, 2014 by Rep. Suzanne Bonamici (D, OR-1). The bill was referred to the United States House Committee on Science, Space and Technology. On September 8, 2014, the House voted to pass the bill in a voice vote. The bill was received in the United States Senate on September 9, 2014 and referred to the United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. Debate and discussion Rep. Bonamici, who introduced the bill, said that \\"the coastlines of the United States already play an integral role in the economic prosperity of this country and we must strengthen their preparedness and resiliency so they can continue to play that role going forward.\\" Bonamici also said that the bill \\"will improve the country's understanding of the threat posed by tsunami events\\" because it will \\"improve forecasting and notification systems, support local community outreach and preparedness and response plans, and develop supportive technologies.\\" Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA) also supported the bill, saying that, because of the devastating nature of tsunamis, \\"we must learn more about tsunami events, provide better and more accurate tsunami forecasting, and reduce impacts on at-risk communities.\\" See also *List of bills in the 113th United States Congress References External links *Library of Congress - Thomas H.R. 5309 *beta.congress.gov H.R. 5309 *GovTrack.us H.R. 5309 *OpenCongress.org H.R. 5309 *WashingtonWatch.com H.R. 5309 * Animation of DART tsunami detection system * How to survive a tsunami – Guide for children and youth * National Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Program Coordinated U.S. Federal/State effort * NOAA Center for Tsunami Research (NCTR) * NOAA Tsunami – General description of tsunamis and the United States agency NOAA's role Category:Proposed legislation of the 113th United States Congress Category:Risk management Category:Articles containing video clips ","title":"Tsunami Warning, Education, and Research Act of 2014"},{"id":"43443128","text":"St. Mark is a painting by the Dutch Golden Age painter Frans Hals, painted in 1625. It was purchased from the art dealer Colnaghi, London in September 2013 for the Pushkin Museum and donated to that museum in November that year, where it still hangs.  Description  The painting depicts St. Mark in traditional iconography as a gray-haired old man in a rough cloak, leaning on a pile of books of the biography of Christ written by him. At his elbow shows the head of a lion - an indispensable attribute of Mark.De evangelist Marcus in record for this painting in the RKD The waist section of the figure and the small size of the canvas (68.5 x 52.5 cm) indicate its chamber purpose. The space of the room is barely marked, which focuses the viewer's attention on the face and hands of the character, which are sharply characterized. The canvas is made with oil on canvas in warm colors, with a predominance of brown, which corresponds to the color scheme of the Golden Age of Dutch art.  The Four Evangelists of Frans Hals  Initially, the picture was part of a series of paintings of the four Evangelists: Luke, Matthew, Mark and John. The art historians Seymour Slive and Klaus Grimm agree the series dates back to the mid-1620s.. Nothing is known about the commissioner of the paintings and the circumstances of their creation. Perhaps the paintings were made for the Catholic or Lutheran church, although the small size and intimate nature of the painting suggests that they were made for a small private chapel, or perhaps for the hidden Catholic church (schuilkerk) in Haarlem, or even for a private house. Catholic services were allowed in Haarlem in April 1581, but home chapels were before. It is also possible that the customer was a Protestant, or the artist painted them for himself, as Hendrick ter Brugghen did with a similar cycle, or Rembrandt with the apostles. Klaus Grimm and Seymour Slive agree that the order was most likely private, rather than secular. Until the 18th century, the canvases were in Holland.. The four evangelists by Hals were documented in 1910 by Hofstede de Groot, who wrote \\"The Four Evangelists. - Four separate pictures, each of them a half-length, showing the hands and attributes of the saint.

Life The son of Francis Newbold, a surgeon of Macclesfield, he was born there on 8 February 1807. He obtained a commission as ensign in the 23rd regiment Madras light infantry under the East India Company in 1828. Arriving in India in that year, he passed an examination in Hindustani in 1830, and in Persian in 1831. From 1830 to 1835 Newbold was quartermaster and interpreter to his regiment. Moved to Malacca in 1832, he became lieutenant in 1834. While in command of the port at Lingy, he detained a boat supplying a belligerent, in a conflict in relation to which government of Malacca desired to maintain a strict neutrality. On his prosecution by the owner, the legality of the seizure could not be maintained; but Newbold's conduct was approved by the court, and he was reimbursed his expenses. Arriving at the presidency with a detachment of his corps in August 1835, he was approved aide-de-camp to Brigadier-general E. W. Wilson, C.B., commanding the ceded districts, an appointment which he held until 1840. He was appointed deputy assistant quartermaster-general for the division in 1838, and deputy assistant adjutant- general and postmaster to the field force in the ceded districts in 1839. Newbold left India on leave of absence early in 1840, and visited Jebel Nákas (\\"Bell Mountain\\"), a tourist attraction in the Sinai peninsula in June of that year. He was elected a member of the Asiatic Society on 5 June 1841, and during a residence of some months in England read several papers before the society. Newbold was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society on 6 January 1842.Royal Society Database, Newbold; Thomas John (1807 - 1850) He was promoted to the rank of captain on 12 April, and was recalled to India in May. Arriving at Madras, he was appointed assistant to the commission at Kurnool, and also to command the horse. He was assistant to the agent to the governor of Fort St. George at Kurnool and Bunganahilly from 1843 to 1848, when he was appointed assistant to the resident at Hyderabad. He was permitted to go to Egypt for two years in June 1845. He died at Mahabuleshwar on 29 May 1850. Works In the Royal Society's catalogue forty-six scientific papers are mentioned of which Newbold was the author. During his residence of three years in the Straits of Malacca, where he had constant contact with the Malayan peninsula, he accumulated material for papers contributed to the journals of the Asiatic societies of Bengal and Madras. These papers formed the basis of his Political and Statistical Account of the British Settlements in the Straits of Malacca … with a History of the Malayan States on the Peninsula of Malacca, London, 2 vols. 1839. Newbold also investigated the mineral resources of India, and was an authority on the geology of Southern India, which he investigated with great thoroughness. He was among the first to describe Neolithic ashmounds from peninsular India. The results of his observations were published from time to time in scientific periodicals. He was also an oriental scholar, and studied Eastern poetry.

At the end the name chosen was Edsel. Given the responsibility of researching potential names and being frustrated by conventional research, Wallace secured the aid of poet Marianne Moore who did not disappoint with such suggestions as Mongoose Civique, Resilient Bullet, Andante con Moto and Utopian Turtletop among others. The entire correspondence was later reproduced in The New Yorker (April 13, 1957, p. 130–136). It was up to Wallace to inform Miss Moore of Ford's final choice which he did in this pungent letter: > November 8, 1956 Dear Miss Moore, Because you were so kind to us in our > early and hopeful days of looking for a suitable name, I feel a deep > obligation to report on events that have ensued. And I feel I must do so > before the public announcement of same come Monday, November 19. We have > chosen a name out of the more than six thousand-odd candidates that we > gathered. It has a certain ring to it. It fails somewhat of the resonance, > gaiety, and zest we were seeking. But it has a personal dignity and meaning > to many of us here. Our name, dear Miss Moore, is—Edsel. I hope you will > understand. Cordially, David Wallace, Special Products Division (The New > Yorker, April 17, 1957, p. 136) Wallace later wrote of his experiences with Ford Motor Co. in Automotive Quarterly, \\"Something went wrong. History had never witnessed anything like it before. More money was spent in its launching than any other previous product offered upon the consumer market anywhere – a quarter of a billion dollars. It was to be the most perfectly conceived automobile the world had ever seen – every part of its planning guided by public opinion polls, motivational research, Science. It did not work out that way…\\" (Automobile Quarterly, 1975, Vol. XIII, No. 2, “Naming the Edsel”, p. 182-191)  Career  *Time Magazine, Manager of Promotion Research, 1939-49. *Ford International, Manager of Foreign Marketing Research, 1949-1951 *Crossley Inc., Vice President 1952-53 *Ogilvy, Benson & Mather, Inc., Advertising Agency, Mgr. of Market Research, 1954-55. *The Ford Motor Co.

As relations between Spain and the United States deteriorated in the spring of 1898, the leaders of the U.S. Army began to plan for its first large-scale campaign since the Civil War, which had ended more than 30 years previously. On April 15, 1898, the regiments of the Regular Army were ordered to various assembly points in the South, with only a handful of units to remain at their peacetime posts. The troops assembling at Camp Thomas, Georgia (in the Chickamauga Battlefield Park) were formed into a provisional field corps on April 23 under the command of Major General John R. Brooke. After the declaration of war, General Order 36 of May 7 approved the organization of eight \\"army corps,\\" each of which was to consist of three or more divisions of three brigades each. Each brigade was to have approximately 3,600 officers and enlisted men organized into three regiments and, with three such brigades, each division was to total about 11,000 officers and men. Thus the division was to be about the same size as the division of 1861, but army corps were to be larger. The division staff initially was to have an adjutant general, quartermaster, commissary, surgeon, inspector general and engineer, with an ordnance officer added later. The brigade staff was identical except that no inspector general or ordnance officer was authorized. General Order 46 of May 16, 1898 assigned commanding officers and training camps to the new corps. Major General Brooke was named as commander of First Army Corps, which was to assemble at Camp Thomas, Georgia. In July 1898, First Division of the First Army Corps (division numbers were not unique in this era) was assigned to the Puerto Rico expedition. On July 23, General Brooke was relieved by Major General James F. Wade, who in turn relinquished command to Brigadier General Royal T. Frank; on August 2, General Frank relinquished command to Major General Joseph C. Breckinridge. (Many accounts claim that First Corps led the invasion of Puerto Rico (as the Fifth had done at Santiago), but the troops under Brooke were the only element of the corps to take part in the expedition, which was headed by the Army's commanding general, Nelson A. Miles and included troops led by generals Guy Vernon Henry and Theodore Schwan who commanded the First Divisions of the Fourth and Seventh corps.) As hostilities concluded and conditions at Camp Thomas deteriorated, it was decided to break up the encampment and move the troops to healthier grounds. On August 22, the Second Division of the corps was ordered to Lexington, Kentucky; the Third Division was sent to Knoxville, Tennessee at the same time. Corps headquarters and General Breckinridge moved with the Second Division. Major General James H. Wilson (USV) succeeded General Breckenridge in command of First Army Corps on October 20, 1898. At the end of 1898, he was ordered to prepare his corps headquarters and a portion of the corps for service in Cuba. The movement began on January 7, 1899 and the troops were assigned to occupation duty in Matanzas and Santa Clara provinces. Shortly after the movement to Cuba, First Army Corps was \\"discontinued\\" on January 16, 1899; its troops remaining in the United States were assigned to Second Army Corps as separate brigades.

Swarm for iOS and Android devices launched on May 15, 2014. A spin- off from and companion app to Foursquare City Guide, Swarm allows users to check-in to a given location, and see who is nearby. These check-ins are chronologically listed to create a personal lifelog for each user, which serves as a digital library for all the places they’ve been, in a searchable database that can be revisited and shared. Location and check-in data collected in Swarm are used to improve a user's recommendations in Foursquare City Guide. Splitting check-ins and general location sharing in to the separate Swarm app was designed to let the main Foursquare app focus on exploring and discovering information on locations, in a Yelp-like fashion. Swarm supports checking in with photos or stickers attached to it, and allows broadcasting of check-ins to other networks including Facebook and Twitter. Swarm features include a shareable and interactive personalized map, and unique stats like total lifetime check-ins, number of unique categories visited, and data on streaks and mayorships. Features Swarm 5.0, released on iOS August, 8 2017 and on Android August 16, 2017, was the most significant update to the app’s core functionality since launching in 2014, focusing more on lifelogging. =Check-ins= If a user wants to share their location, they can \\"Check In\\" to a specific venue and this location will be shared with their friends. Users can write a message with their check-in and mention (or check in) their friends at the venue with them. It is also possible to include a photo, as well as cross-posting the check-in to Twitter and Facebook. A user's location is never shared publicly - it is only ever shared with their friends in Swarm, unless they specifically choose to share their check-in to Facebook or Twitter. In 2016, Swarm added a feature that allowed users to check in to a location without sharing the location with their friends. These check ins were called “off-the-grid” and would show up in their history, but won’t be visible to their friends when they view their page. Each time a user checks in, a pin is dropped on their interactive personal check-in map. This map is meant to serve as a visual representation of everywhere they've been. =Messaging= Swarm introduced in 2014 a new feature called Plans that let users send out a group message which is then seen by all their friends that are nearby. Its purpose was to facilitate group meetups. In 2015 this feature was replaced with private Messaging. Messages allow users to send direct and group messages, but no longer broadcast their location on a neighborhood level. =Stickers= Users can attach a single sticker to any check-in to quickly express how they feel or what they are doing. Unlock instructions for new stickers are often not provided in the app itself 'to keep stickers a surprise'. There are 100 Collectible Stickers in addition to special Bonus Stickers that can be unlocked. For example, the Newbie sticker can be unlocked after a user's first check-in and the Explorer sticker after fifty check-ins. Other ways to unlock collectible stickers include tagging friends, using key phrases in checkins (such as \\"Congratulations\\" or \\"Happy Birthday'\\") and more. Aside from the 100 Collectible stickers, over 100 Bonus stickers have been released to celebrate various occasions and miscellany. Many sticker releases coincide with holidays, world events, or particular achievements. The \\"Superuser\\" sticker is only available to Superusers. For a time, there were 25 golden stickers. Users who had the most check-ins against their friends at a certain category were awarded this sticker. Swarm 5.0 introduced 52 new stickers and “Collectible Categories.” There are 100 stickers that each coincide with a popular category, such as Diner, Bowling Alley, and Pizza Place. Users can upgrade stickers to earn 2x and 3x coin multipliers by continuing to check in to those 100 collectible categories. = Challenges = Released in 2016, Swarm Challenges encourage users to check in to specific venue types, a certain number of times within a specific date range, to be entered to win prizes. For example, the first Swarm Challenge was the Summer Kickoff, requiring users to check into 3 summer spots (beaches, parks, trails, etc) to be entered to win $10,000 towards a dream vacation. Swarm Challenges were only available to residents of the United States. = Memory Lane = Located in the stickers tab, Memory Lane displays every badge unlocked in classic Foursquare. =Mayorships= The user who checks in at a venue more than any other over a 30-day period is awarded the title of \\"Mayor\\". This is similar to the game mechanic found in classic Foursquare. When Swarm launched in May 2014, Foursquare's public Mayorships were all lost. Instead of competing with everyone on the service to become \\"Mayor\\" of a venue, users now competed with their friends only. Mayors 2.0 meant that venues could have many different mayors, one for each circle of friends, instead of just a single mayor at each place. In July 2015, responding to negative feedback, Mayors 2.0 were retired, and Swarm introduced the current Mayorship game, that more closely resemble the one in classic Foursquare. =History search= Swarm lets a user search their past check-ins and reflect on where they've been and what they've done. Users are able to search their check-ins by friends they checked in with, city, category, or even the type of places they've been (such as Mexican Restaurant, Park, etc.).  Merchandise  Users who publicize impressive achievements in the app via social media may be sent an exclusive pack by Swarm containing branded stationery and physical stickers. Reception CNET described the app as a \\"bold move\\", and praised it for removing some of the \\"clutter\\" of Foursquare and focusing on letting the user \\"quickly see where your friends are and make plans\\". The redesign was unpopular with some existing Foursquare users, who complained about its lack of gamification elements, and the need to download two apps for what used to be contained in a single Foursquare app. Foursquare is calling Swarm’s latest incarnation the “lifelog,” and it’s meant to offer a new way of thinking about the trademark check-in process that’s less about gamification and leaderboards and more personal. With younger smartphone users gravitating toward text, photos, and videos that disappear — and the more raw and genuine style of sharing that allows — Foursquare now wants to create a space where you can plant a virtual flag, to come back to a memory and savor it later on in life.

Life The son of John Newman (of the same name), a wholesale dealer in leather in Skinner Street, Snow Hill, London, and a common councillor of the ward of Farringdon Without, he was baptised at the church of St Sepulchre-without-Newgate, on 8 July 1786. Newman was employed under Sir Robert Smirke in the erection of Covent Garden Theatre in 1809, and on the London General Post Office between 1823 and 1829. From approximately 1815, Newman was one of the three surveyors in the commission of sewers for Kent and Surrey, and with the other surveyors, Joseph Gwilt and Edward I'Anson, published a Report relating to the Sewage in 1843. He was for many years in the office of the Bridge House Estates, and eventually succeeded to the clerkship. He held several surveying appointments, including that to the commissioners of pavements and improvements for the west division of Southwark, and to Earl Somers' estate in Somers Town, London. He was honorary architect to the Royal Literary Fund from 1846, and to the Society of Patrons of the Charity Children's Anniversary Meeting in St. Paul's Cathedral. Newman retired in 1851. He died at the house of his son-in-law Alexander Spiers, at Passy near Paris, on 3 January 1859. Architectural works St Mary Moorfields, designed by Newman in 1820 (print 1852) Newman designed: * Roman Catholic church of St. Mary, Blomfield Street, Moorfields, in 1817–20, which was used as the pro-cathedral of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Westminster until 2 July 1869; * houses in Duke Street, London Bridge, with wharves and warehouses, constructed when the line for the new bridge was prepared in 1824; * Islington Proprietary School, Barnsbury Street, 1830; * School for the Indigent Blind in St George's Fields, Southwark, 1834–8, in the Gothic style; * St. Olave's Girls' School, Maze Road, Southwark, 1839–40. Antiquarian Newman collected antiquities found in London and the surrounding neighbourhood. Some bronzes in his possession from the bed of the Thames were mentioned in a paper by Charles Roach Smith, read before the Society of Antiquaries of London in June 1837. Among them was the colossal bronze head of Hadrian, now in the Anglo-Roman room of the British Museum. In 1842, Smith again made use of Newman's collection when reading another paper before the society on Roman Remains recently found in London. In 1847, Newman exhibited before the British Archaeological Association an earthen vase of notable form found during the excavations for the new houses of parliament. His collection was sold by auction at Sotheby's in 1848. He was a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries from 1830 to 1849, and an original fellow of the Institute of British Architects, where he founded the travelling fund. Family Newman married in 1819 a daughter of the Rev. Bartholomew Middleton, sub-dean of Chichester. The architect Arthur Shean Newman (1828–1873) was his son.

She is credited as being instrumental in promoting single malt whisky, in particular Islay malts and Laphroaig, during the then-emerging US trend for single malts. Biography Williamson was born in Glasgow in 1910 the second child of Agnes Whyte (née Paton) and John Williamson, a mercantile clerk. In World War I her father was a gunner with the Royal Garrison Artillery, and died in France in 1918. She attended the University of Glasgow from 1927, intending to become a teacher, graduating with an MA in 1932. While waiting to enrol at Jordanhill College of Education she worked as an office assistant with her uncle William Paton, an accountant working for the restaurateurs and purveyors Smith (Glasgow) Ltd. In 1934, Williamson took a summer job as a shorthand typist at Laphroaig distillery, on Islay, intending to stay a few months. She worked directly with then owner Ian Hunter, and eventually became office manager. When Hunter suffered a stroke in 1938, Williamson took on responsibility for distribution to the United States. By the time of World War II she had become the full-time manager of the distillery. With operations mothballed during the war and the government seeking to use the distillery for storage and training purposes, Williamson succeeded in preventing the theft of stock or damage to equipment that had occurred at other distilleries such as Old Bushmills Distillery in Dublin and could have hampered recovery of production in the postwar period. Over 400 tonnes of ammunition were stored at the facility during the early years of her tenure. After production restarted following the war, Williamson continued to pursue the blending sales that had been the backbone of Laphroaig's business model beforehand, but starting to guide the business elsewhere. Upon Hunter's death in 1954, Williamson inherited the controlling interest in the Laphroaig distillery on Islay, Hunter's house Ardenistiel, and the island of Texa. Williamson is credited with being among the first to anticipate the coming trend for single malt scotches and to position the Laphroaig product, and by extension other Islay malts, to the American market. Williamson was quoted on UK television in the 1960s saying \\"The secret of Islay whiskies is the peaty water and the peat ... there's an increasing demand for the [single] Islay whiskies. We can't supply the demand that we have for our whiskies.\\" The Scotch Whisky Association named Williamson as its American spokesperson from 1961 to 1964 and she toured the United States representing Islay whisky to buyers and distributors. While visiting the US she met her future husband, the singer and entertainer Wishart Campbell and they married in 1961. In 1962 Williamson sold a third of her business shares to Seager Evans and Co. The balance of ownership was released in 1967 to Long John Distilleries. Williamson continued as managing director of the distillery until her retirement in 1972. Long John International was acquired by Whitbread & Co in 1975 and sold to Allied Lyons, now Allied Domecq, in 1990. Fortune Brands split up its business product lines in 2011, forming its spirits business into Beam Inc. Beam was purchased by Suntory in April 2014. Williamson died at Gartnavel General Hospital in Glasgow on 26 May 1982.

History The Metropolitan Museum of Art embarked its first educational venture during the winter of 1879-1880 with the establishment of a school to provide vocational training in woodworking and metalworking. This first school was funded by a $50,000 contribution from Gideon F.T. Reed, former partner of Tiffany and Co., with organizational assistance from Edward Moore, a silversmith. Over the next 15 years the school's name was changed numerous times, in part a reflection of changing ideas about education held by Metropolitan Museum Trustees. Among names used were Industrial Art Schools of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Technical Art Schools of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Metropolitan Museum Art Schools, and The Metropolitan Museum of Art Schools. The schools were supervised by a succession of managers under the direction of a Committee on Art Schools, which in turn reported to the Metropolitan's Board of Trustees. Managers included John Buckingham, John Ward Stimson, Arthur L. Tuckerman and Arthur Pennington.Finding aid for Schools of The Metropolitan Museum of Art Records (1879-1895). The Metropolitan Museum of Art. Retrieved 31 July 2014. The first location of the Schools was the third floor of 31 Union Square, on the northwest corner of Broadway and 16th Street. Free classes in woodwork and metalwork met twice weekly in the evening. In 1880, Richard T. Auchmuty, a proponent of trade schools, offered the Museum rent-free use of a building he had newly erected on 1st Avenue between 67th and 68th Streets. His only condition was that students be charged a nominal tuition of $5 or $8 per semester, depending on whether they took day or evening classes. Prior to this classes had been free. At the 1st Avenue location 143 students studied drawing and design, modeling and carving, carriage drafting, decoration in distemper and plumbing. The school soon relocated to the upper floors of the Glass Hall building, 214-216 East 34th Street, where it remained until 1887. At this location elementary classes were added and the number of teachers was increased. The following year the school moved once again to 797-799 3rd Avenue. John Ward Stimson, a former Museum superintendent who became head of the Museum Schools, oversaw the development of the Schools from thirty to four hundred students in seventeen classes by 1888. At this point, two-thirds of the Schools' were women, and Stimson was adamant that the School had the potential to provide women with vocational training opportunities.\\"TO TRAIN ARTIST ARTISANS.\\" New York Times (1857-1922): 9. Jul 15 1888. Retrieved via ProQuest 3 Aug. 2014. Despite significant contributions from Museum Trustees (including a $30,000 gift from Museum President Henry Gurdon Marquand) the school was financially challenged through much of its existence. In an 1889 cost-cutting move, the school relocated into the basement of the Museum building on 5th Avenue and 82nd Street. There the curriculum evolved to encompass the fine arts; course offerings included antique, life and still life painting, architecture, ornamental design, illustration and sculpture. In 1892 advance courses were instituted and prominent artist John La Farge was hired as instructor. In 1893, Frederick Ruckstull was appointed to teach modeling and marble carving, and the tuition was recorded as fifty dollars for a season ticket of day classes and thirty dollars for night classes.\\"A VITAL AMERICAN SCHOOL.\\" New York Times (1857-1922): 8. Oct 02 1893. Retrieved via ProQuest 3 Aug. 2014. Two years later, because of increased expenses, all elementary courses were discontinued and the advanced painting class was cancelled soon after. Museum Trustees ceased operation of the school program in spring 1895. Early in the 20th century the Trustees recommitted the Museum to a pedagogic mission by establishing an Education Department focused on a collections-based fine arts instruction.

A step and repeat banner (sometimes a step and repeat wall or press wall) is a publicity backdrop used primarily for event photography, printed with a repeating pattern such that brand logos or emblems are visible in photographs of the individuals standing in front of it. Step and repeat banners are common fixtures of red carpet or fashion events, or custom-printed for weddings or galas in order to give a more \\"celebrity-like\\" feel to attendees' photos.  Material  Step-and-repeat backdrops can be made in several ways. The most common ways are either vinyl, fabric, poster paper, canvas or adhered onto a hard substrate such as plywood or foamcore. Recently step and repeats have been created with greenery, called 'green step and repeats'. Each has its own sets of pros and cons. Fabric is less likely to have hotspots in photography which means it tends to absorb a flash rather than reflecting it. Vinyl is heavier duty and sometimes has brighter, more vibrant images. The support structure can vary depending on size. Standard trade show display frames are often used, or it can be hung from or applied on a wall.  Usage  The main use for step and repeats is brand awareness. Vendors may charge a sponsorship fee for a logo to be displayed or for the company name to be featured in the background. The idea is that the photos will be shared through various platforms causing a ripple effect in impressions. More recently, step and repeat banners are being used more widely in and not just for hollywood style events.

Overview On 30 July 2014, the Federal Government of Somalia officially endorsed a new Central Regions State, following a signed agreement in Mogadishu between representatives from the Galmudug and Himan and Heeb regional administrations, as well as Ahlu Sunna Waljama'a. The formalization ceremony for the new federal state was held at the Villa Somalia presidential compound and was presided over by President of Somalia Hassan Sheikh Mohamud and Prime Minister Abdiweli Sheikh Ahmed, with UN, EU, AU, IGAD and AMISOM envoys also in attendance. According to the Prime Minister's office, the Federal Government appointed a ministerial committee to guide the formation of the new state. It also organized a number of consultative meetings with the regional representatives, with each party eventually agreeing to establish a new administration in the Mudug and Galguduud regions. Additionally, the Central Regions State will be subject to the Provisional Federal Constitution. On 9 August 2014, the UN, EU and IGAD envoys for Somalia reiterated that federal government representatives and signatories had indicated prior to the signing of the central state agreement that the pact would only apply to Galguduud and Galmudug. North Mudug would remain an integral part of Puntland state. On 24 August 2014, Federal Parliament Speaker Mohamed Osman Jawari announced that Federal MPs hailing from Puntland had begun brokering negotiations between the federal government and the Puntland regional administration. On 14 October 2014, a three-day conference in Garowe concluded with a 12-point agreement between the Federal Government and Puntland authorities, which stipulates that the earlier Central Regions State pact between the Galmudug and Himan and Heeb regional administrations only applies to the Galguduud and south Mudug provinces. On 25 December 2014, ahead of a state formation conference in Adado, the Federal Government appointed six committees to oversee the establishment of the prospective Central Somalia regional state. The steering bodies include a technical committee facilitating the creation of Central State, which is chaired by Halimo Ismail Ibrahim; a constitution committee, which is chaired by Abdinoor Moalim Mohamud; a reconciliation committee tasked with solving of differences and selection of delegates, which is chaired by Sheikh Omar Mohamud Mahad; a security, protocol and supervision committee, which is chaired by Uke Haji Abdirahman; a mobilization committee, which is chaired by Abdullahi Abdi Abdille; and a committee of accommodation of delegates and guests of honour, which is chaired by Dahir Hassan Guutaale. On 21 January 2015, members of the technical committee for the establishment of a new Central State of Somalia arrived in Adado to facilitate the launching of an inauguration ceremony for the prospective regional state. The delegates were accompanied by elders and intellectuals, and subsequently held talks with Himan and Heeb administration officials and other local representatives. In late March 2015, President Mohamud and Dhusamareb traditional elders began talks over a possible relocation of the Adado conference to Dhusamareb. Mohamud preferred holding the summit in Adado, whereas the traditional elders favored Dhusamareb for security-related reasons and because the town had already recently hosted smaller reconciliation meetings. In April 2015, during consultative talks with local politicians and traditional elders, President Mohamud officially announced that Dhusamareb was slated to be the administrative capital of the Central State. On 16 April 2015, President Mohamud officially launched the Central State formation conference in Adado. The summit was attended by Federal Cabinet ministers and MPs, state formation technical committee Chairperson Halima Ismael, UN Special Envoy to Somalia Ambassador Nicholas Kay, IGAD Special Ambassador Mohamed Abdi Afey, Ambassador of Turkey Olgen Bakar and Uganda Special Envoy Nathan Mugisha. International representatives from the governments of Ethiopia, the United States, the United Kingdom, Italy and Sweden as well as AMISOM also welcomed the formation conference, and urged the local stakeholders to work together to ensure broad-based reconciliation, peacebuilding and statebuilding. According to Mohamud, traditional leaders are now tasked with selecting 510 delegates, who will then elect a new regional president within two weeks. In May 2015, a federal delegation led by the Ministry of Interior launched the second phase of the Central State state formation conference in Adado. The meeting included talks with local politicians, elders and intellectuals as well as technical committee officials.

While in exile from Peru he founded an art school in San Miguel de Allende in Mexico in 1938. The school failed, but on his return in 1950 he founded the Instituto Allende, a university-level arts school that was still active in 2014. The short film \\"Felipe Cossio del Pomar in San Miguel de Allende\\", by Ezequiel Morones is in Youtube. Early years Felipe Cossío del Pomar was born on 31 May 1888 in Morropón Province in the Piura region of Peru. His family was connected to important figures in Peru, including Pío de Tristán, the last Viceroy and later foreign minister of the Peru–Bolivian Confederation. He was also related to Paul Gauguin, the grandson of Flora Tristan. He studied in Lima at the Colegio de Guadalupe, graduating in 1904. He then began the study of Letters at the Universidad de San Marcos. His parents wanted him to become a lawyer. For this reason, in 1906 he sailed to Europe to study Law at the University of Leuven. However, he chose to stay in Brussels and enrolled at the Free University to study fine arts for three years. He then studied and worked as an artist in Paris until the beginning of World War I (1914–18). He became part of the bohemian circle in Paris led by Pablo Picasso, Marc Chagall and Henri Matisse. Cossío moved to the USA in 1917, where he was much in demand for his talent as a portrait painter in the modernist style. After his return to Peru in 1921 he transferred to the Universidad San Antonio de Abad in Cuzco. It was at this time that he became a friend of Víctor Raúl Haya de la Torre. He obtained a degree of Doctor of Letters in 1922 with a thesis on the history of painting in Cuzco. This was the basis for his book on colonial painting in Cuzco. Haya de la Torre was deported by the Legufa regime in October 1923. In 1924, the nascent Alianza Popular Revolucionaria Americana (APRA) was forming its first sections in Mexico, Cuba, Panama, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Colombia, Venezuela, Argentina and Uruguay. Cossío had returned to the USA by 1925, where he formed an important base of support for the APRA. Cossio visited Haya de la Torre in Mexico City, and while there met the painter Diego Rivera who introduced him to the forms and colors of traditional Aztec art. In 1927 Cossío del Pomar visited the town of San Miguel de Allende in Mexico and was enchanted by the quality of light. Cossío del Pomar returned to Europe in 1929, where he lived in Brussels, Florence and Paris. In France he worked with the surrealists André Breton and Louis Aragon. In 1931 Cossío was back in Peru helping to organize the APRA. Cossío used his reputation to push for improvements in the teaching of art, both to modernize the teaching and to upgrade it to a graduate level where before it had simply been considered a minor trade. In the second half of 1932 Haya de la Torre was imprisoned and threatened with the death penalty. Cossío del Pomar moved to Buenos Aires and Santiago de Chile. In 1935 Cossío was placed on a blacklist, threatened with immediate arrest if he returned to Peru, and the sale of his books was banned. Mexico In 1937 Cossío del Pomar returned to Mexico. He founded the Escuela Universitaria de Bellas Artes (University School of Fine arts) in San Miguel de Allende in a former convent that had been used as a barracks. With the support of president Lázaro Cárdenas the government transferred the property to the school, which opened in 1938. The American artist and writer Stirling Dickinson was made director of artistic studies. The influx of students brought new prosperity to the town. Cossío del Pomar returned to Peru in 1945 when the government granted amnesty to exiles. He sold his holdings, which included a ranch as well as the school, to the Mexico City lawyer Alfredo Campanella. Cossío returned to San Miguel de Allende in 1950, discovered the earlier school had been ruined by Campanella, and founded a new school with the help of the former governor of Guanajuato Enrique Fernández Martínez, and Fernández's wife Nell Harris. Cossio and Fernández bought the ruined 18th century Renaissance palace that the Count of Canal had built during the silver boom, with its large grounds. They renovated the building, and also opened several cottages and a hotel for visitors. Stirling Dickinson became art director of the newly opened Instituto Allende. Later years Cossío remained in Mexico until 1954, then moved to Madrid. He lived there until 1959, when he moved to Havana after the success of the Cuban Revolution. He disagreed with the ideological direction of the revolution, and in 1961 moved back to Spain to Gandia, Valencia, in the southeast. This was Cossío's most prolific period, both as an artist and an author. He returned to live in Peru in 1980, aged 92, and died the following year. Although he died in Lima, he had arranged for his remains to be buried in the city of Piura. He left the city his private art collection with the purpose of erecting the Museum of Art of that city. Publications Cossío del Pomar was a writer as well as a painter, and the author of a number of literary works.

The bill was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. It was signed into law on August 8, 2014 by President Barack Obama. Background During the War in Afghanistan, the United States promised some Afghans protection in exchange for being translators for the U.S. In 2009, the United States began issuing 3,000 visas each year to Afghans, and their families, who helped the United States during the war, usually by being an interpreter or a guide. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The bill would amend the Afghan Allies Protection Act of 2009 to increase by 1,000 the number of Afghan special immigrant visas available in FY2014. The bill would require, with regard to such visas, that: :*the period during which an alien must have been employed must terminate by December 31, 2014, :*the principal alien seeking special immigrant status shall apply to the Chief of Mission by December 31, 2014, and :*the authority to provide such status shall terminate on December 31, 2014. The bill would direct the United States Secretary of State, by January 1, 2015, to increase temporarily the fee or surcharge (by $1) for processing machine-readable nonimmigrant visas and machine-readable combined border crossing identification cards and nonimmigrant visas. Procedural history The Emergency Afghan Allies Extension Act of 2014 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on July 24, 2014 by Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-OR). The bill was referred to the United States House Committee on the Judiciary and the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs. On July 30, 2014, the House voted to pass the bill in a voice vote. The Senate passed the bill on August 1, 2014 and President Barack Obama signed it into law on August 8, 2014. Debate and discussion According to Rep. Blumenauer, who sponsored the bill, there was \\"need for immediate action because the State Department has confirmed they have completely exhausted all visas Congress authorized in December.\\" Blumenauer argued that \\"a failure to provide these additional visas ensures the many brave translators the U.S. promised to protect in exchange for their services would be left in Afghanistan, hiding, their lives still threatened daily by the Taliban.\\" See also *Withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan References External links *Library of Congress - Thomas H.R. 5195 *beta.congress.gov H.R. 5195 *GovTrack.us H.R. 5195 *OpenCongress.org H.R. 5195 *WashingtonWatch.com H.R. 5195 Category:United States federal immigration and nationality legislation Category:United States federal defense and national security legislation Category:Acts of the 113th United States Congress ","title":"Emergency Afghan Allies Extension Act of 2014"},{"id":"43443600","text":"David Ariel Mendieta Chávez (born 22 August 1986) is a Paraguayan footballer who plays for 12 de Octubre in the Paraguayan Primera División.

Rukmani Kund, 28 km from Bilaspur, was selected in HGKK (Har Gaon Ki Kahani Programme) for the year 2012–2013.Rukmani Kund is considered the place of sacrifice of Rukmani and a Mela (fair) has been started here since some years on the name of sacrificer. A small temple has also been constructed here. It is the source of water supply for so many villages in the area. How to Reach There is no direct bus to Rukmani Kund. If you are traveling through Bus then Auhar is last bus stop for you. If you have your personal vehicle then the road leading to the Rukmani Kund bifurcates from Bhaged Village, towards Auhar on the Shimla-Dharamshala Highway. If you want to go on foot then a path lead to Rukmani from a kilometer ahead on Auhar-Rishikesh road. If you want to continue in your personal vehicle then you have to go 3 km ahead on Auhar- Gehrwin road and there is a kuchha road of almost 2 km which takes you to the Rukmani Kund. History The entire Auhar region was in trouble because of dearth of water despite their repeated efforts to dig a well. Once the ruler of Barsandh had a dream that in case his son or daughter in law is offered as a sacrifice, water could come out. Legend is there that a newly married young lady named Rukmani of Taredh Village married to Rundh Family, Rajput ruler of Barsandh village, was buried alive by the side of the spot which was selected for digging a Baoli (Tank). The daughter-in-law, Rukmani offered herself in preference to her husband. She sacrificed her life and the present Rukmani Kund is a result of her courageous act. It is said that she was buried alive at the place where we have this Kund today. According to Omacanda Hāṇḍā in Buddhist Art & Antiquities of Himachal Pradesh, Up to 8th Century A.D., such stories of Woman sacrifices were common instances in which women were sacrificed to Nāga Devta for the sake of water. Similar stories can be taken into consideration like Rupi Rani of Gushal Village in Lahul Valley, Rani Nayana of Raja Sahil Varman of Chamba, Bichi of Sirmaur and Kandi Rani of Kishtwar in Jammu who were sacrificed to Nāga Devta for the sake of water. Human Sacrifices to Nāga Devta has been one of the most conspicuous features of Austric Tribes. Grass (baggad) hanging from the walls of the Kund is considered her hair. And it is there because of the magical power of the reservoir water. People tie ribbons, bangles to the grass to offer tribute to Rukmani. It is also believed that the waters of this reservoir can cure skin ailments. Rukmani belonged to Auhar (erstwhile Tared Village) and even today people from Rukmani's village don't drink or bathe in the Kund's waters. Such is the pride they take in their daughter's sacrifice. Fair Baishakhi Mela is organized here annually. Geography Rukmani Kund lies in the middle Shiwalik Hills (the Shiwalik comprises conglomerates triable micaceous sand stone, siltstone and claystone), in Bilaspur District. Water Supply Five Gram Panchayats are being provided with water for Drinking and Irrigation purposes. Proposals and Reality On 14 April 2000 Mr.Suresh Chandel, Ex-MP, announced that Rukmani Kund would be developed into a tourist resort. This religious place would be connected by an all-weather road. Mr. Chandel declared that not only Himachal's Tourism Department and Art and Cultural Department would collaborate for development of this centre but he would ensure sufficient Central grant from the Centre for its faster development. On 5 February 2012, Mr. Rikhi Ram Kaundal, Vidhan Sabha Deputy Speaker announced that a sum of Rs.5 Lacs would be spent for providing tourist facilities at the famous Rukmani Kund near Auhar in Jhandutta constituency under the \\"Shrine Tourism\\" agenda of their government. On 15 April 2013 Mr. Rajesh Dharmani, Chief Parliamentary Secretary, Forests and Fisheries, announced that Rukmani Kund shrine will be developed into a tourist spot. But, till this date the place has not reached up to the condition of satisfaction so far. The Rukmani Kund is not given even half as much attention as to other victim villages of the Har Gaon Ki Kahani programme. While in other cases, they did construct a road, painted the walls colorful, and put on the Welcome Boards; Rukmani Kund wasn't that lucky. The road leading to the Kund is as good as the terrible stretch between Batal and Chatrru in Lahaul and Spiti district. And if it is the rainy season, the road turns into a muddy canal. The Tourism Department did spend handsome amount to conceptualize HGKK programme. However, they probably forgot about the Rukmani Kund.

The next instance are the administrative courts of appeal (). The administrative courts handle numerous types of cases relating to disputes between private persons and the authorities. There are 12 administrative courts spread across Sweden. Types of cases Over 500 different kinds of cases are assigned to the administrative courts. For example: * Cases concerning the compulsory care for young people. * Cases concerning adults with substance misuse problems. * All decisions made by a municipality or county council can be appealed, under the Local Government Act. * Cases involving the social services in a municipality, on issues like welfare, under the Social Services Act. * Decisions made by the Swedish Tax Agency, regarding income tax, property taxes or a VAT decision, etc. * Cases concerning psychiatric care, under the terms of Compulsory Psychiatric Care Act and the Forensic Psychiatric Care Act. * Decisions made by the Swedish Social Insurance Agency. This includes sick pay, compensation for occupational injuries, and more. Other common cases are: driving licence revocation, alcohol licensing, animal welfare issues, appeals on public procurement decisions and agricultural subsidies. =Migration Courts= Decisions made by the Swedish Migration Agency, on issues like deportation or refusal of entry, can be appealed at the Migration Courts, which are located at four of Sweden's administrative courts: Stockholm, Malmö, Gothenburg and Luleå. Decisions made by these courts can be appealed at the Migration Court of Appeal, which is located at the Administrative Court of Appeal in Stockholm. Organization Sweden is divided into 12 court districts () for the administrative courts, as prescribed by the government (SFS 1977:937). In the administrative courts, a judge other than the president of a court or a division of a court is simply titled Judge (). A judge who presides over a division is titled Senior Judge (), and the head official of the administrative court is titled Chief Judge (). The administrative courts have approximately 1,500 employees. About 220 of these are employed as judges. There are also lay judges () linked to the administrative court. Lay judges are laymen, not legally qualified representatives of the people, appointed by the county councils, serving four years. Permanent salaried judges () are appointed by the Government. Special provisions apply for the selection of judges and their dismissal, to guarantee the independence of the court, making them almost impossible to fire. In most cases, the bench constitutes a quorum with one legally qualified judge and three lay judges. However, some simpler cases may be decided on without any lay judges, and in more complicated cases the lay judges may be replaced by specially appointed experts. Appeal With the exception of tax cases, cases concerning the compulsory care for young people or adults with substance misuse problems, and people who are mentally ill, a leave to appeal is required for the next instance to hear a case. This means that the Administrative Court of Appeal needs to grant an appeal, and this is only done if there's reason to believe the court's decision might be changed, or set an important precedent in a higher court.

The bench usually constitutes a quorum with three qualified judges. However, two officers of the court is enough if they are in agreement about granting a leave to appeal. In certain cases, such as when the case involves decision about social welfare insurance and child custody cases, two lay judges are required to form part of the bench. Appeal The Supreme Administrative Court needs to grant a leave to appeal, to consider a case. A permission to appeal will only be granted if there is reason to believe the case may be of importance as a precedent.

Faught was born in Buffalo, Guernsey County, Ohio on August 1, 1907, the son of Arthur G. and Hattie Hollenbeck Faught. For five years after graduating from high school, he set up store window displays in Detroit, Michigan while attending Detroit Art School. In 1932 he moved back to Ohio and enrolled in Muskingum College, majoring in pre-law. He entered Ohio State University College of Law in 1935, and graduated in 1938. He passed the Ohio bar in July 1938, and began practice in Cambridge, Ohio with Melton Boyd, Robert E. Scott, A. R. McCulloch and Frank R. Danello. He was elected prosecuting Attorney of Guernsey County in 1940 as a Democrat, but defeated in a re-election bid in 1944. In 1945, a death caused a vacancy on the Guernsey County Court of Common Pleas. Governor Frank Lausche appointed Faught to the seat, and he won election to the unexpired four years of the term in 1946. He chose not to run for re-election in 1950. Edward C. Turner, an Associate Justice of the Ohio Supreme Court died on September 13, 1950. Governor Lausche appointed Faught to the seat on September 27, and he was seated October 4. The Ohio Constitution requires that any judicial vacancy that occurs more than 40 days before the next general election can only be filled until that election. Lack of time before the November election necessitated a write-in election, and Faught came in third behind winner Henry A. Middleton. Faught only served until the election results were certified by the Ohio Secretary of State. Faught returned to Cambridge, and worked with the firm Willis, Danello, Faught & Moorehead. In 1952 he challenged incumbent Charles B. McClintock for his seat on the 5th District Court of Appeals of Ohio, but lost.

Before his judicial service he was in the Ohio House of Representatives, a county commissioner, the state tax commissioner, and was a legal author. Schneider was born in Cincinnati, Ohio on September 26, 1921, the son of Louis J. and Florence Schneider. He graduated Cincinnati public schools and attended Princeton University 1939 to 1941. He then attended the University of Cincinnati, graduating in 1943. He then entered the United States Army, commissioned as a first lieutenant. He was discharged in 1946. Schneider graduated from the Cincinnati Law School in 1949, passed the bar exam, and entered private practice. In 1952, he and his father authored Schneider's Criminal Code, which was reprinted a number of times. Schneider served in the Ohio House of Representatives from 1951 to 1959, was Hamilton County commissioner from 1959 to 1963, and was Ohio tax commissioner in 1963 and 1964 under Governor Jim Rhodes. In November 1964, he ran for the remaining two years of the unexpired term of James F. Bell, who had resigned in 1962. He defeated Lynn B. Griffith, who had been appointed to the seat by previous governor Michael DiSalle, and was sworn in when the election results were certified. Schneider ran for a full six-year term on the Supreme Court in 1966, and defeated Clifford F. Brown. He tried for a second full term in 1972, but lost to William B. Brown. He then returned to private practice in Cincinnati. On September 5, 1947, Schneider was married to Ruth Ann Kirkendall. They had three children. He died December 15, 1999, was cremated, and was interred in Spring Grove Cemetery.

He was Trumbull County, Ohio prosecuting attorney 1927 and 1928. He faced Clarence Darrow in a bribery case that ended in a hung jury. Darrow would later visit the Griffith farm when passing through Trumbull County. Another house-guest of Griffith was William Jennings Bryan, who died a few days after visiting Griffith. In 1930, Griffith was elected to the Trumbull County Court of Common Pleas, and held that seat until 1950. That year, Governor Frank Lausche appointed Griffith to fill an unexpired term on Ohio Seventh District Court of Appeals. He won re-election in 1954 and 1960.

He was enrolled in the elementary courses at the Imperial Academy of Arts in 1782, and later studied with Grigory Ugryumov and Gabriel François Doyen, graduating in 1797. He began teaching there in 1798 and became an Academician in 1803. During this time, he was engaged in copying the old Italian masters and painting icons. In 1812 he was appointed a Professor for his painting of Prince Mstislav the Brave and the defeat of Rededya. In 1820, he painted the fresco \\"Minerva Hovering in the Sky\\" for the iron staircase at the Academy. His painting \\"The Death of General Kulnev\\" angered Tsar Nicholas I when it was exhibited in 1830, apparently because it portrayed a controversial (and almost certainly apocryphal) moment from the incident; Kulnev's order to his allied officers to remove their insignia so the enemy wouldn't know that the Russian army was without a commander. As a result, Ivanov was removed from the Academy.RusArtNet: Biography A few years later, when Karl Briullov returned to Russia and was presented with a laurel wreath, he took it off his head and placed it on Ivanov's instead, as a sign of respect and appreciation. Despite his forced retirement, Ivanov remained active as a painter and member of several artistic societies. He died of cholera. His grave in the Smolensk Cemetery has not survived. His son was the painter Alexander Andreyevich Ivanov.

It is supported by the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) that is funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF). History Brown Dog is part of the DataNet partners program funded by NSF in 2008. DataNet was conceived to address the increasingly digital and data-intensive nature of science, engineering and education. Brown Dog is part of a follow-on effort called Data Infrastructure Building Blocks (DIBBs), focused on building software to support DataNet. The project was proposed by researchers at NCSA and the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign as well as researchers from Boston University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Unstructured, uncurated, long tail data Much scientific data is smaller, unstructured and uncurated and thus not easily shared. Such data is sometimes referred to as \\"long tail\\" data. This borrows a term from statistics and refers to the tail of the distribution of project sizes. The majority of smaller projects lack the resources to properly steward the data they produce. This so-called \\"long tail\\" data, both past and present, has the potential to inform future research in many study areas. Much of this data has become inaccessible due to obsolete software and file formats. The resulting impossibility of reviewing data from older research disrupts the overall scientific research project. Approach Brown Dog describes itself as the \\"super mutt\\" of software (thus the name \\"Brown Dog\\"), serving as a low-level data infrastructure to interface digital data content across the internet. Its approach is to use every possible source of automated help (i.e., software) in existence in a robust and provenance- preserving manner to create a service that can deal with as much of this data as possible. The project sees the broader impact of its work in its potential to serve the general public as a sort of \\"DNS for data\\", with the goal of making all data and all file formats as accessible as webpages are today. Technology Brown Dog seeks to address problems involving the use of uncurated and unstructured data collections through the development of two services: the Data Access Proxy (DAP) to aid in the conversion of file formats and the Data Tilling Services (DTS) for the automatic extraction of metadata from file contents. Once developed, researchers and general public users will be able to download browser plugins and other tools from the Brown Dog tool catalog. =Data Tilling Service= Data Tilling Service (DTS) will allow users to search data collections using an existing file to discover other similar files in a collection. A DTS search field will be appended to configured browsers where example files can be dropped. This tells DTS to search all the files under a given URL for files similar to the dropped file. For example, while browsing an online image collection, a user could drop an image of three people into the search field, and the DTS would return all images in the collection that also contain three people. If DTS encounters a foreign file format, it will utilize DAP to make the file accessible. DTS also indexes the data and extract and appends metadata to files and collections enabling users to gain some sense of the type of data they are encountering. This service runs on port 9443. =Data Access Proxy= Data Access Proxy (DAP) allows users to access data files that would otherwise be unreadable. Similar to an internet gateway or Domain Name Service, the DAP configuration would be entered into a user's machine and browser settings. Data requests over HTTP would first be examined by DAP to determine if the native file format is readable on the client device. If not, DAP converts the file into the best available format readable by the client machine. Alternatively, the user could specify the desired format themselves. This service runs on port 8184. Use cases Brown Dog targets three use cases proposed by groups within the EarthCube research communities. Developers and researchers from these communities will work together on use cases that span geoscience, engineering, biology and social science. =Long tail vegetation data in ecology and global change biology= This use case is led by Michael Dietze, Boston University > Data on the abundance, species composition, and size structure of vegetation > is critically important for a wide array of sub-disciplines in ecology, > conservation, natural resource management, and global change biology. > However, addressing many of the pressing questions in these disciplines will > require that terrestrial biosphere and hydrologic models are able to > assimilate the large amount of long-tail data that exists but is largely > inaccessible.

Founded in 1986, LaserShip is based in Vienna, Virginia and has sortation centers in New Jersey, Ohio, North Carolina, and Florida. As of 2016, LaserShip has 63 distribution centers and four sorting centers servicing 22 states and Washington, D.C.Parcel Magazine >https://issuu.com/rbpublishing/docs/par_mayjune?e=2333928/35918877 LaserShip handles deliveries for Amazon and others from New England to Florida, specifically Amazon's Same Day Service. In early 2018, LaserShip was purchased by private equity firm Greenbriar Equity Group. In April 2019, LaserShip was officially awarded the International Supply Chain Protection Organization (ISCPO) Carrier Certification, as part of the ISCPO’s Carrier Security Audit & Certification program. LaserShip achieved full compliance with ISCPO Carrier Security Requirements, which includes a comprehensive due diligence process and analysis of security standards needed to ensure the integrity of goods flowing through LaserShip and its clients’ extended supply chain. History LaserShip began as a document delivery service in 1986. In the 1990s, LaserShip landed in the small parcel business during the dot-com boom. In 1999, the company partnered with Barnes & Noble to provide same-day shipping services in New York City. In March 2014, LaserShip added four states to its service area: New Hampshire, Rhode Island, West Virginia and Delaware. This expanded the LaserShip footprint by 44 percent, reaching an additional 8.5 million consumers. Also in March 2014, LaserShip acquired Cleveland-based-last mile delivery company Prestige Delivery Systemshttp://parcelindustry.com/article-4612-LaserShip-expands-footprint-in- New-Jersey-to-meet-growing-ecommerce-demand.html, further expanding services to Ohio, Kentucky, Michigan and Indiana. Disputes and settlements =Package tossing, property damage, and theft= Numerous news reports backed up by surveillance camera footage depict LaserShip delivery drivers recklessly tossing packages onto customers' property. A New York magazine article entitled \\"LaserShip, Amazon's New Shipping Partner, Might Be the Most Hated Company on the Internet\\" features a compilation video showing numerous such incidents at over a dozen different households, with packages ending up on porches, in front lawns, and on driveways.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJeJZ7BeQ8c In one incident from 2016, a LaserShip delivery man was caught on tape tossing a $500 camera lens several yards onto a poured-concrete porch. In March 2017, a customer caught on tape a delivery man tossing a package containing a router, damaging the contents, and reported the incident to Lasership. After the complaint, the delivery man then returned to the customer's residence four times, prompting the customer to call the police. The customer spoke with the Vice President of LaserShip, who noted that the employee had been with the company for 10 years. In February 2018, a LaserShip driver dumped a package onto the lawn of a Naples, Florida, resident before proceeding to run over an orange tree sapling in her front yard while quickly executing a three-point turn. The resident captured the incident on a surveillance camera and reported the story to WINK News. At 5:19 PM on 7 July 2019, a LaserShip employee was caught on tape delivering a package and then stealing a Coach bag from the garage of the delivery destination containing $1,600 in electronics. =Misclassification and nonpayment of drivers= In April 2014, the company reached a class-action settlement of $800,000 with drivers in Massachusetts who accused the company of misclassifying them as independent contractors. In November 2015, a class action lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that workers were denied overtime payments, were unlawfully denied earned compensation, and for other violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act.Crosby and Lewis v. Lasership, Inc., Et Al., Index Number 08694-CV-2015, SDNY - retrieved through pacer.gov and http://www.fslawfirm.com/pdfs/cs/Lasership-Complaint.pdf The results of this litigation are pending. In June 2019, LaserShip was ordered to pay almost $600,000 to drivers in New Jersey who had been classified as independent contractors after an investigation by the US Department of Labor. =Cigarette settlement= In September 2014, LaserShip reached a $5 million settlement with the city of New York over deliveries of untaxed cigarettes. The original suit alleged that LaserShip had delivered more than 120,000 cartons between 2011 and 2013 violating federal and state laws and resulting in tax losses of $1.9 million. The case was prosecuted under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act. Under the settlement agreement, LaserShip ended all cigarette shipments.

Biography Burroughs was born in 1961 in Boston, Massachusetts. She received a Bachelor of Arts degree, cum laude, from Middlebury College. She received a Juris Doctor, cum laude, in 1988 from the University of Pennsylvania Law School. She began her legal career as a law clerk for Judge Norma L. Shapiro of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania from 1988 to 1989. She served as an Assistant United States Attorney in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania from 1989 to 1995 and in the District of Massachusetts from 1995 to 2005. From 2005 to 2014 she was a partner at Nutter McClennen & Fish where she represented individuals and corporations in criminal and civil proceedings primarily before Federal Courts. Federal judicial service On July 31, 2014, President Obama nominated Burroughs to serve as a United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, to the seat vacated by Judge Rya W. Zobel, who took senior status on April 1, 2014. She received a hearing before the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary on September 17, 2014.\\"Judicial Nominations\\" United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary, September 17, 2014. On November 20, 2014, her nomination was reported out of committee by voice vote. On December 13, 2014, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid filed a motion to invoke cloture on the nomination. On December 16, 2014, Reid withdrew his cloture motion on Burroughs' nomination, and the Senate proceeded to vote to confirm Burroughs by a voice vote. She received her federal judicial commission on December 19, 2014, and was sworn in on January 7, 2015.  Notable rulings  Judge Burroughs is most notable for her order putting a hold on President Donald Trump's travel ban in January 2017 (Executive Order 13769), and as the judge who presided over United States v. Salemme, Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard University, and United States v. Babich. Salemme was the last major trial of La Cosa Nostra mobsters. Francis Salemme (aka \\"Cadillac Frank\\") and co-defendant Paul Weadick were convicted of the murder of 43-year-old Steven A. DiSarro, who disappeared in May 1993. Salemme and Weadick were sentenced to life in prison in September 2018. In October 2018, Burroughs held a three-week bench trial in SFFA v. Harvard, a lawsuit challenging Harvard's admissions program as discriminatory against Asian Americans. A decision in favor of the University was announced on October 1, 2019.Harvard Admissions Process Does Not Discriminate Against Asian-Americans, Judge Rules. https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/01/us/harvard- admissions-lawsuit.html. Retrieved October 1, 2019. United States v. Babich is a criminal case brought against several former executives of the pharmaceutical company Insys Therapeutics. The government alleged that the executives violated the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C. 1692 et seq., by engaging in a scheme to sell the fentanyl- based pain medication Subsys by bribing physicians to prescribe the drug. The indictments led to guilty pleas, including by former Insys CEO Michael Babich. The remaining defendants were tried from January through April 2019. All five remaining defendants, including former billionaire John Kapoor, were convicted of racketeering. Judge Burroughs also presided over a July 2020 lawsuit filed by Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) that sought to halt an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) policy that required international students in the United States on F-1 visas to depart the country if they would not be attending in-person classes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Judge Burroughs announced that the Trump administration had agreed to reverse the policy during a July 14, 2020 hearing in her Boston courtroom. Judge Burroughs has also presided over several class actions related to consumer products, including the In re Intuniv Antitrust Litigation, which concerns allegedly anticompetitive agreements between drug makers Shire and Actavis purportedly aimed at charging supracompetitive prices for an ADHD medication, and cases against each of Nestle, The Hershey Company, and Mars alleging that the companies violated Massachusetts law by failing to disclose the use of slave labor in their cocoa bean supply lines. Judge Burroughs' In re Intuniv Antitrust Litigation class certification opinions (one opinion certifying a class of direct purchasers, and another declining to certify a class of indirect, consumer purchasers) are notable for their application of the predominance required for class certification where putative classes contain numerous uninjured members. Judge Burroughs dismissed the complaints against the chocolate bar companies in January 2019, a decision upheld by the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in June 2020. In September 2019, Burroughs also dismissed a class action suit that claimed the packaging of Honey Bunches of Oats cereal was misleading given the cereal's limited honey content.https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=19181846-24e0-46f6-af57-2f9d291c4c4d In a February 2020 decision, Judge Burroughs ordered the release of certain grand jury materials related to the Pentagon Papers.

The Water Authority was formed in 1944 by the California State Legislature, and operates under the County Water Authority Act, which can be found in the California State Water Code. SDCWA serves 24 agencies with 36 Board of Director members. Current board members are Jim Madaffer (Chair), Gary Crocher (Vice Chair), and Christy Guerin (Secretary). SDCWA receives its water supply from the Colorado River, Northern California , as well as desalinated water from the Claude \\"Bud\\" Lewis Carlsbad Desalination Plant . SDCWA also runs water conservation programs both in a class setting as well as practical application . SDCWA head quarters are located in Kearny Mesa. Members Members served by SDCWA are cities, water districts, irrigation districts, municipal water districts, public utility districts, and a military base The following agencies purchase water from the Water Authority: * Carlsbad Municipal Water District * City of Del Mar * City of Escondido * Fallbrook Public Utility District * Helix Water District * Lakeside Water District * National City (Member of Sweetwater Authority) * City of Oceanside * Olivenhain Municipal Water District * Otay Water District * Padre Dam Municipal Water District * Camp Pendleton Marine Corps Base * City of Poway * Rainbow Municipal Water District * Ramona Municipal Water District * Rincon Del Diablo Municipal Water District * City of San Diego * San Dieguito Water District * Santa Fe Irrigation District * South Bay Irrigation District (Member of Sweetwater Authority) * Sweetwater Authority * Vallecitos Water District * Valley Center Municipal Water District * Vista Irrigation District * Yuma Municipal Water District History Spanish missionaries in the San Diego area in 1769 noticed that the local water supply was in need of infrastructure, such as dams and aqueducts, to increase supply to the area. One of the first water projects in San Diego was the Old Mission Dam which preceded the erection of six privately funded dams between 1887 and 1897, all of which are still in existence today .Through an act of California state legislation, the San Diego County water authority was created in 1944 to oversee San Diego County’s water rights over the Colorado River . In 1952 San Diego started receiving water from the State Water Project from pipelines built by SDCWA. The Capital Improvement Program (CIP) was created in 1989 to lower the need for imported water to the region . In 2003 the Quantification Settlement Agreement put into writing an agreed upon allocation of water for SDWCA. With the construction of concrete lined canals, for 110 years, the water district will receive of water via this agreement.In 2015 SDCWA started supplementing their supply with water from the desalination plant in Carlsbad, CA.By 2035 it is projected that local water will meet the region's water demands Water sources San Diego County Water Authority supplies its members both imported and local water resources. Imported water used by SDCWA comes from the Sacramento-San Joaquin rivers through State Water Project aqueducts , and from the Colorado River (through the Colorado River Aqueduct) . California is one of seven states which receive water from The Colorado River. Around 17% of the water supplied through SDCWA comes from the State Water Project. Local sources from the Metropolitan Water District include recycled water, groundwater pumping, and desalinated water from the Carlsbad Desalination Plant. The Carlsbad desalination plant can supply up to of water  Current Projects  SDCWA currently has officials working at a state and federal level to keep track of legislative decisions which may affect San Diego's water supply . Current projects include The Capital Improvement Program (CIP), which works to create infrastructure to meet regional water needs has been an ongoing project since 1989. A current project of CIP is the $1.5 billion Emergency and Carryover Storage Project which is a fail-safe plan in case of a lapse in imported water supply. The Emergency and Carryover Storage Project consists of dams, reservoirs, pipelines, and pumping stations to ensure continued supply to the region. In efforts to supplement imported water supply, SDCWA helped to facilitate the opening of the Claude \\"Bud\\" Lewis Carlsbad Desalination Plant in 2015. This desalination plant is currently the largest desalination plant world wide and produces 50 million gallons of water a day. In January 2020, the 2020 Urban Water Management Plan was developed with 6 elements outlining future forecast, savings, supply and reliability, and planning and shortage analysis in the region that SDCWA covers.  Current Consumer Programs  SDCWA has water saving incentives and programs for both residential and business consumers. = Residential Programs = Residential programs include water saving tips for both indoor and outdoor uses, as well as gardening demonstrations. Residential incentives include rebates for high- efficiency washers and toilets for indoor use, and rebates on sprinkler nozzles, rain barrels, and turf replacement for outdoor water use. = Business Programs = For businesses, the SDCWA has incentives including both indoor and outdoor water efficiency rebates and programs including their community partnering program run through the Metropolitan Water Districts Innovative Conservation Program (ICP). ICP does work to evaluate water saving technology and their efficiencies. The ICP provides funding with the help of the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (USBR), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Southern Nevada Water Authority (SNWA), the Central Arizona Project (CAP), the Southern California Gas Company, and Western Resource Advocates. . = Contractor Programs = For contractors the SDCWA has a WaterSmart Contractor Incentive Program (WSCIP), where participants can purchase water saving devices to use in their watering systems.

Edwin Saunders, 1884 portrait Life Born in London on 12 March 1814, he was son of Simon Saunders, senior partner in the firm of Saunders & Ottley, publishers, in Brook Street, London. He was articled as a pupil to Mr. Lemaile, a dentist in Southwark. At the end of three years he gave a course of lectures on elementary mechanics and anatomy at a mechanics' institute. The surgeon Frederick Tyrrell was present at one lecture, and Saunders was invited to lecture at St. Thomas's Hospital. With the diploma of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1839, Saunders was appointed dental surgeon and lecturer on dental surgery to St. Thomas's Hospital, a post he occupied until 1854. In 1855 he was elected F.R.C.S. He was also dentist from 1834 to the Blenheim Street Infirmary and Free Dispensary, and in 1840 he started, in conjunction with Mr. Harrison and Mr. Snell, a small institution for the treatment of the teeth of the poor. It was the first charity of its kind, and lasted about twelve years. Whilst working on cleft palate, Saunders came to know Alexander Nasmyth, who had a large dental practice in London; and after 1846, when Nasmyth was incapacitated by paralysis, Saunders bought Nasmyth's practice, which he carried on at Nasmyth's house, 13a George Street, Hanover Square, until he retired to Wimbledon. He succeeded Nasmyth in 1846 as dentist to Queen Victoria, Albert, Prince Consort, and other members of the Royal family. Saunders was president of the dental section at the meeting of the International Medical Congress which met in London in 1881, and in the same year was president of the metropolitan counties branch of the British Medical Association. In 1883 he was knighted, being the first dentist to receive that honour. In 1886, he was president of the British Dental Association. He died at Fairlawn, Wimbledon Common, on 15 March 1901, and was buried at the Putney cemetery. Professionalisation of dentistry Saunders tried to organise the dental profession, and in 1856 he, with others, petitioned the Royal College of Surgeons of England to grant a diploma in dental surgery; but it was not until after many negotiations that the college obtained powers, on 8 September 1859, to examine candidates and grant a diploma in dentistry. The Odontological Society was founded at Saunders's house in 1857 to unite those who practised dental surgery. Saunders was the first treasurer, and was president in 1864 and 1879. Saunders was trustee of the first dental hospital and school established in London, in Soho Square in 1859. The institution prospered, and in 1874 the Dental Hospital in Leicester Square was opened, being handed over to the managing committee, free of debt. Colleagues and friends commemorated the work of Saunders by founding in the school the Saunders scholarship. Works Saunders was author of: * Advice on the Care of the Teeth, 1837. * The Teeth as a Test of Age considered in reference to the Factory Children. Addressed to the Members of both Houses of Parliament, 1837; it was used by factory inspectors. Family In 1848 Saunders married Marian, eldest daughter of Edmund William Burgess, with whom he celebrated his golden wedding in 1898.

The party existed from 1989 to 1997 and during its life had elected representatives at a provincial and municipal level. The initial base of Agir was the Liège branch of the Parti des forces nouvelles (PFN). The PFN had endured poor electoral results as well as adverse publicity following a brawl with police at the Brussels International Book Festival, resulting in the Liège going their own way in 1989.Piero Ignazi, Extreme Right Parties in Western Europe, Oxford University Press, 2006,p. 128 The three founding leaders of Agir were Willy Freson, a one-tine leading activist in the Front de la Jeunesse, Robert Destordeur, a member of the PFN secretariat and Robert Steuckers, the main ideologue of the Nouvelle droite tendency in Belgium. The party belonged to an authoritarian xenophobic strand of the extreme right, eschewing the neo-liberalism that was growing in importance at the time.Elisabeth Carter, The Extreme Right in Western Europe: Success Or Failure?, Manchester University Press, 2005, p. 59 The party however rejected the biological racism of its PFN predecessor, preferring instead to emphasise cultural nationalism and identity politics.Carter, The Extreme Right in Western Europe, p. 38 It strongly supported the repatriation of immigrants.Carter, The Extreme Right in Western Europe, p. 33 They described themselves as an \\"opposition popular party\\" and rejected the label of extreme right.

The Cape Copper Company Medal for the Defence of O'okiep is a private campaign medal which was instituted by the Cape Copper Company Limited in 1902. The medal was awarded to members of the O'okiep Garrison who defended the town while it was besieged by Boer Commandos from 4 April to 4 May 1902, near the end of the Second Boer War.South African Medal Website - Unofficial Military Awards (Access date 27 April 2015) The Cape Copper Company The Cape Copper Company had its origin in the Cape Copper Mining Company, which was established in 1862 or 1863 as the Cape of Good Hope Copper Mining Company to take over the copper mining properties of Phillips & King, an enterprise which had been involved in copper mining around O'okiep in Namaqualand since the 1850s. The Cape Copper Mining Company was restructured as the Cape Copper Company in 1888. The Siege of O'okiep The Cape of Good Hope was invaded by Boer commandos towards the end of the Second Boer War and the town Concordia, a few kilometres to the north of O'okiep, surrendered to Boer forces on 4 April 1902. From 4 April to 4 May, the town O'okiep was besieged by the Boer forces under General Jan Smuts, whose strategy was to capture the rich copper fields and thus force the British to send troops from Cape Town to O'okiep, which would then leave Cape Town vulnerable to attack. The garrison of O'okiep, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel W.A.D. Shelton DSO, consisted of some 900 men and included local miners who assisted Shelton's troops. The civilian defenders were mostly employees of the Cape Copper Company, three-quarters of whom were Coloured. A chain of blockhouses and other defensive positions had been prepared, and early in the siege the garrison succeeded in repulsing several determined attacks by the commando. However, when the departure of Smuts with a British safe-conduct to the deliberations at Vereeniging heralded the end of the war, the siege became little more than a good-humoured blockade. The locomotive Pioneer derailed outside O'okiep after the Boer commando attack on the town On 1 May 1902, the commandos launched an attack on O'okiep, using the commandeered locomotive \\"Pioneer\\" of Concordia's Namaqua United Copper Company to propel a mobile bomb in the form of a wagon-load of dynamite into the besieged town. The protective defences at O'okiep consisted of a barbed wire fence, which was erected across the railway line at Braakpits Junction, just north of the town. The points at the junction were rigged to the fence, with the result that when the dynamite laden wagon breached the fence, it derailed at the points and spilled its load of dynamite on the ground, where it burned out harmlessly without exploding. According to Jan Smuts, the railway between the two towns was still intact, but since there were women and children in O'okiep town, all the commando was allowed to do was to give O'okiep a tremendous fright with a harmless explosion. Boer General Ben Bouwer had inspected the trainload before it was sent hurtling into the besieged town, to make sure that there were no caps in the dynamite. O'okiep Defence Medal After the war ended, the British government awarded the Queen's South Africa Medal to all those regular troops who had seen active service in Namaqualand during the war, as well as the King's South Africa Medal to those who had seen service on or after 1 January 1902 and completed 18 months service before 1 June 1902. When it transpired that the Coloured members of the O'okiep garrison were precluded from receiving these medals, the Cape Copper Company decided to strike a medal of its own and to present it to all the defenders of the town, regardless of race. The silver medal Two versions of the Cape Copper Company Medal for the Defence of O'okiep were struck. The bulk were struck in bronze and were awarded to the rank and file of the military and civilian defenders of the town, most of whom were mine workers who had taken part in the defence of O'okiep. A silver medal was awarded to officers, higher ranking mine officials and at least one non-commissioned officer, Paymaster Sergeant Harry Rodda, who was also the paymaster of the O'okiep Copper Company. Description ;Obverse The Cape Copper Company Medal is a silver or bronze medallion, 36.5 millimetres in diameter with a raised rim, depicting the encircled company emblem, a miner with a spade standing next to a mining cocopan, and inscribed \\"1888\\" at the bottom and \\"THE CAPE COPPER COMPANY LIMITED\\" around the perimeter. ;Reverse The reverse is smooth with a raised rim and is inscribed \\"PRESENTED TO THE OFFICERS NON-COMMISSIONED OFFICERS AND MEN OF THE GARRISON OF OOKIEP IN RECOGNITION OF THEIR GALLANT DEFENCE OF THE TOWN UNDER LT.

On the India medal the suspender is affixed by means of claws and a pin through the upper edge of the medal. ;Ribbon The ribbon is 1¼ inches wide and dark brown with a ¼ inch wide green band in the centre. Status While privately instituted military decorations and medals do not enjoy official status, as a result of not having been formally instituted or sanctioned by the fount of honour at the time, and while none of them were therefore allowed to be worn with military uniform, some have become well-known and have acquired recognition in South Africa's military medal history. Four of these decorations and medals are considered to be significant.South African Medal Website - Legal aspects - Fount of Honour (Accessed 1 May 2015) * Sir Harry Smith's Medal for Gallantry of 1851. * The Johannesburg Vrijwilliger Corps Medal of 1899. * The Kimberley Star of 1900. * The Cape Copper Company Medal for the Defence of O'okiep of 1902.

Modeling career Mercado broke into the fashion industry within four years. She started off in modeling as a photographer; she was trying to build her business but didn't have the money to hire professional models. A celebrity photographer told her that she had a beautiful face and that she should be modeling. She had taken pictures of herself but was often rejected because of her size. Many times fashion industry people liked her face in her portfolio but balked after seeing her in person due to her size, and told her that if she lost weight she would have more work. Media career Mercado started working at the age of 15, Mercado was a radio personality in Las Vegas as an early morning host. She went on to work for Telemundo and Univision doing red carpet interviews with high profile latino celebrities.

She is currently a co-host on a new entertainment talkshow produced by Dr.Phil called Face The Truth on CBS and has her book coming out in 2019 with publishing company Harper Collins One. Makeup and fashion design With her parents teachings of hard work and high values, Mercado turned her makeup skills into a career. She was a celebrity makeup artist who worked in magazines, TV and film. She also took her designing skills and launched her first collection of dresses in 2013 celebrating the beauty of plus size women around the world. Weight After letting her weight increase to well over 400 pounds,http://www.people.com/article/rosie- mercado-lost-210-lbs-after-being-told-wouldnt-fit-in-plane-seat\\" Mercado managed to start losing weight to deal with mobility issues and embarrassment as she became larger and larger. She was chosen to be the face of Full Figured Fashion Week in 2010 still weighing over 350 pounds. By 2012, she had gotten her weight down to 178 pounds.

Early life Holliday was born and raised in Laurel, Mississippi. Her mother left her father when Holliday was a young child and Holliday claims her family moved forty times before she turned ten. In June 1995, her mother was paralyzed and disabled after she was shot twice in the head by her fiancé, who was charged with attempted murder. At the age of ten Holliday and her brother moved back to their grandparents' house in Mississippi while their mother recovered. Holliday was bullied from fifth grade on for her weight and pale skin, having a disabled mother and because they lived in a trailer behind her grandparents' house. She left school at the age of 17 and earned her GED. Holliday has also alleged verbal abuse about her size by her father, but she has said that she was supported and encouraged by her mother to become a model. Holliday has severed contact with her father. Career At the age of 15, while she was a US size 16 (UK 18/20) and 5 feet 3 inches tall, Holliday auditioned at a casting call for plus models in Atlanta, Georgia, where she was told she would be lucky to do print advertisements or catalogue work because she was too short and big. Subsequently, Holliday relocated to Seattle where she stayed for two years and worked as a make-up artist, head make-up artist, hair stylist and creative director at fashion shows. She then moved back to Mississippi and gave birth to her son (at the age of 20). Then following Hurricane Katrina, she returned to Seattle (where she had some pictures taken for her then boyfriend and posted them on Model Mayhem in October 2009) then she moved to Los Angeles in 2010. Her move to Los Angeles helped her gain confidence. In 2011, while working as a receptionist at a Los Angeles dental office she became a professional model. She responded to 'House of Dreams Model Search' by Torrid and was accepted. At the same time, A&E; chose her to be the face of documentary television series Heavy after being discovered online. In June 2011, she became the face of the television show and was on an advert that ran nationwide and billboards across the country. Holliday has been featured on \\"fatshion\\" blogs, she models accessories and plus size clothing lines, and was contacted to audition for Vh1's The Big Girls Club. She has shot a campaign for Benefit Cosmetics, worked with David LaChapelle, featured in Vogue Italia and she has appeared in Nylon magazine. In 2014, Holliday quit her day job at the dental office to pursue her modeling career full-time. In May 2014, a video was uploaded on Vimeo called #everyBODYisflawless, which featured Holliday and fellow plus-size fashion bloggers and models Gabi Gregg and Nadia Aboulhosn lip-synching and dancing to Beyoncé's 2013 song \\"Flawless\\". In September of that year, she was interviewed by Jacob Soboroff and Meghan McCain on TakePart Live. In January 2015, London-based modeling agency Milk Model Management announced that they had signed Holliday to their plus-size division, Curves. They declared that Holliday had become the largest plus-size model of her size and height to be signed to a mainstream modeling agency, and the first Curve model above a size 20. In May, she had her first agency shoot. In March 2014, Holliday became the first model over size 18 to model Monif Clarke's clothing line after she was hired as the face of the latest campaign for her swimwear line Sea by Monif C - a line that is specifically designed for women sizes 14–24. In the same month, she modeled for Torrid. She also collaborated with the plus size clothing retailer Yours Clothing for the second time when she was officially announced as the face of their high summer campaign. In May 2015, she was featured on the cover of People. In September 2015, Holliday starred in H&M;'s sustainable fashion campaign alongside singer Iggy Pop, artist Daniel Lismore, sex blogger Karley Sciortino and blogger Pardeep Singh Bahra. In the same month, she starred in Addition Elle's fall 2015 capsule collection campaign. In the same month, she also confirmed that she is in the process of designing her own clothing line. In November of the same year, she was involved in a fashion shoot for Marie Claire UKs December 2015 issue. In January 2016, Canadian plus size retailer Penningtons announced that the brand has partnered with Holliday to release a capsule collection bearing her name under their mblm label. Activism Holliday also self- describes as a \\"body positive activist\\". She embraces the word 'fat' and advocates that people should be able to eat as much and whatever they want without suffering from social ostracism. In 2013, she started her #effyourbeautystandards movement on Instagram. The movement shows women that they do not have to be a certain size to love their body (big or small) and that their size should not dictate their fashion choices. Since February 2015, Holliday has employed a team of six social media specialists to help manage her message across the world. She has said that the movement has led to women letting her know that they now feel good about how they look and wear what they like. She also talks at public events about body confidence. In February 2014, Holliday appeared on Channel 4 News. In April 2015, she was interviewed by Meredith Vieira on The Meredith Vieira Show. In the same month, she appeared on Plus Sized Wars, a Channel 4 documentary about changing beauty standards and explores the fast-growing plus-size fashion industry. In August 2015, Holliday demanded a boycott of Facebook, Instagram and Tumblr accounts under the name 'Project Harpoon', which photoshopped her image and images of other women including Rebel Wilson and Melissa McCarthy to make them appear slimmer without authorization. In September 2015, she criticized Victoria's Secret for their limited amount of plus-size clothing options. In a January 2016, interview with Paper, Holliday stated that she embraces the term \\"plus- size\\" and disagrees with other people's rejection of it. She discussed how she does see how the term as negative or derogatory and thought the term is 'very important' for larger women to have their own labels. Controversy In late 2014, Holliday began producing a series of T-shirts with the phrase, \\"Eff Your Beauty Standards\\", with some of the proceeds being donated to an organization that helps survivors of domestic violence. In December, approximately 140 orders failed to deliver to customers, though about 3000 orders were successful. A post on Reddit accused her of withholding money promised to charity, as well as not delivering her products. In December 2015, Holliday told Refinery29 that the project was launched with \\"pure intentions\\" and \\"My mother and I are both victims of DV.\\" She said, \\"The idea that I would willfully defraud the people who have supported me along the way, and a charity that touches on my own family's struggles, is so upsetting.\\" Holliday admits that she did not know how to handle the logistics of the project, was unable to keep up with orders, and takes responsibility for some customers not receiving the merchandise they paid for. \\"The system we were using just didn't work,\\" she said, attributing missing merchandise to \\"one big batch that was lost by the post office\\" and \\"usual business discrepancies\\". She was unable to make the charity donation after paying \\"thousands and thousands of dollars\\" out of pocket to a shipping and distribution center to ensure issues with merchandise would be resolved, which \\"ate up what little [was] left of the profits\\". She said, adding that she has given a \\"substantial contribution\\" to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence. In January 2016, National Coalition Against Domestic Violence's Development Manager Dina Coates Koebler confirmed, \\"A donation in the amount of $1,000 was made to our organization on 12/13/2015 by Ms. Hoven.\\" Personal life At the age of 20, Holliday gave birth to her son, Rilee. In June 2015, The Guardian reported she no longer had any contact with her son's father. In 2012, Holliday met Australian businessman, photographer and artist Nick Holliday on Tumblr. They talked online for seven months before Holliday traveled to the U.S. to visit, and in April 2015, he moved from Melbourne to the U.S. On July 5, 2014, they got engaged. They secretly wed one year later on July 5, 2015. In January 2016, it was announced that Holliday was pregnant and expected to give birth in June. She gave birth to her second son in June 2016. Holliday lives with her mother, husband, and sons. She was born Ryann Hoven but changed her name to Tess Munster (a surname she chose because she liked the television sitcom The Munsters) when she started doing alternative modeling and has also used the name Tess Typhoon. In January 2015, she adopted and officially started using her fiancé's surname. In 2019, Holliday came out as pansexual.https://people.com/health/tess-holliday-comes-out-pansexual/ Holliday is tall and wears a US dress size 22 or 3x. She is heavily tattooed, including a Miss Piggy tattoo on her right outer forearm, a Mae West tattoo on her right inner forearm, a Marilyn Monroe tattoo on her left bicep, a plus- size mermaid tattoo on her right upper thigh, a Hello Kitty tattoo on her right calf and a Dolly Parton tattoo on her right arm.

The video was released on May 7, 2014. It was created by Gregg to promote body positivity and acceptance in response to harassment. Background Gabi \\"GabiFresh\\" Gregg was inspired to create a new version of Beyoncé's 2013 \\"Flawless\\" after receiving discrimination due to her body size. She decided to recreate the video to include larger bodies by recruiting and collaborating with fellow plus-size fashion bloggers and models Nadia Aboulhosn and Tess Munster to film the video. Partly inspired by Beyoncé's decision to keep her entire self-titled album Beyoncé a secret until it was released, Gregg kept the video project a secret until its release. Gregg hopes that people support her campaign by using the hashtag and sharing the video. Gregg said, \\"...This video is dedicated to the mainstream media, to the fashion industry, to internet bullies, and to anyone else who thinks it's their right to try to make us feel less than because of their insecurities.\\" Aboulhosn said, \\"For me, this video is to show all of my followers that you define your definition of beauty...\\" Munster said, \\"This is OUR way of giving an 'eff you' to the critics that say we promote obesity, that we have no place in the fashion industry.\\" Gregg added: \\"As someone who gets my fair share of negativity in my industry, I thought the message was definitely applicable. I just wanted to do something fun that was also empowering women to give a middle finger to a fat-phobic society.\\" Aboulhosn added: \\"All three of us are feminists, and we really wanted to get across the fact that we can all empower each other and work together in an industry that is so competitive. We aren't here to compete with each other; instead, we are here to uplift one another, especially because we have similar struggles in a world that isn't very accepting of us.\\" Munster mused, \\"I want women, young girls to see this and realize that we are perfect the way we are, \\"to push back to the 'standards' that society tries to place on us and [realize] that we are so much stronger together.\\" Development The video was styled and produced by Gregg, and directed by Helton \\"Brazil\\" Siqueira. Gregg and Munster both live in the Los Angeles area and Aboulhosn flew in for a few days for the shoot. It took a month after that to finish the editing process with Siquiera. The introduction reads: 'Fat is not a flaw'. It then segues into a music video featuring Gregg, Aboulhosn and Munster lip-synching and dancing to Beyonce's track. The clip shows the trio recreating the Beyoncé video in a wardrobe of sequins, shorts and crop-tops. The video ends with a Huffington Post comment: \\"Regardless of how people's metabolism function, or what they look like, each of us deserves respect, compassion, and can't be judged by anyone but themselves.\\" It also uses the same excerpt by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie from the original. Release The video was uploaded on Vimeo on May 7, 2014. It was released two weeks after Beyoncé released her Pretty Hurts video and, subsequently, the #WhatIsPretty campaign, which asks fans to upload images and quotations that define what beauty means to them. Critical response Julie Gerstein of BuzzFeed thought the aim of the video is \\"...To let women know that there's more than one ideal body, one ideal vision of beauty and that 'you don't have to be a certain size to claim your flawlessness'.\\" Danielle Young of Hello Beautiful said, \\"The result is an absolutely flawless display of self love that can inspire even those who wear single digit clothing. You don't have to be plus size to know that loving your body is a must.\\" Michelle Guerrero Denison of Zaftig Times said, \\"obvious sisterhood, body positivity, and feminism oozing through this video.\\" Maeve Keirans said, \\"...the fact that Beyonce, Gabi, Nadia, and Tess are making people talk about it and are opening their minds/beliefs/understandings to the variety out there is very cool. Bow down.\\" Kimberley Foster of Coloures said, \\"...I can only imagine the psychological toll the endless body shaming must take on these women. Creating their own image of unity and confident to combat the nastiness was an incredible idea...\\" Bellanaija.com thought the \\"Three plus size bloggers – GabiFresh, Nadia Aboulhosn, and Tess Munster, prove you can be big, absolutely fabulous, and comfortable in your own skin.\\" Liza of Persephone Magazine thought \\"There's something truly magical about seeing big boobs, back rolls, and flabby arms moving without apology and with confidence channeled from Queen Bey [Beyoncé] herself.\\" Cassandra of Swagger New York thought \\"the ladies go from glam to hood chic as they lip sync the track in between close ups of their curves.\\" Daily Life commented that it \\"features some pretty fantastic fashions...\\" SourceFed said, \\"This is an amazing movement, and a grand example of three very different plus size women recreating and reinterpreting such a positive, empowering piece of art. FLAWLESS.\\" Alex Rees of Cosmopolitan thought it is a \\"kick-ass music video. One that comes with the hashtag #everyBODYisflawless, as a means of furthering the conversation around — and in support of — body positivity, in all shapes and sizes.\\" Liz Black of Refinery29 said, \\"With huge social followings of their own, these body- positive women are already influential. But, this video speaks volumes of truth that they may not have previously revealed...\\" Clutch said about Gregg, \\"...her version of Beyonce's '***Flawless' video is a celebration of everything body positive.\\" Sweetest thought \\"Other women of all sizes and backgrounds should stand up against set beauty standards for women and know that #EveryBodyIsFlawless.\\" Giselle Childs of StyleBlazer reiterated \\"...Every body is flawless. It's a lesson we should all take care to remember.\\" Emma Cueto of Bustle said, \\"...used to promote body positivity and fat acceptance... and all three ladies kill it... So checkout GabiFresh's Twitter hashtag #everyBODYisflawless and prepare to fall in love with her video.\\" CRAZY COOL GROOVY!!! thought the women \\"put their own brand-spankin' new spin on the BEYONCE banger, FLAWLESS!!!\\" Sinha Smrita of Mic noted \\"The movement seems to have hit something of a nerve online, where people have taken to social media to applaud the concept.\\" Yesha Callahan of The Root noted \\"As the video went viral, kudos have been pouring in:\\" Arabelle Sicardi of The Style Con said about Gregg, \\"When she dropped this video on us, my love for her was sealed for all of eternity.\\" Eun Kyung Kim of Today said of the video, \\"The result is full of attitude and self acceptance.\\" Laura Williamson of Mamamia thought \\"...this the most ***Flawless, film clip recreation ever.\\" Kaitlyn of Autostraddle said \\"The result is — forgive me — flawless.\\" Rebecca Rose of Jezebel described it as \\"FUCKING FLAWLESS MAGIC\\": Kate Lloyd of Grazia Daily stated \\"We love it\\". Nina Bahadur of The Huffington Post claimed \\"We couldn't 'bow down' any further if we tried.\\" Maura Brannigan of Lucky called it a \\"wonderful video\\".

R. Martin, and its television adaptation Game of Thrones. Introduced in 2000's A Storm of Swords, he is a renowned wildling leader and chief lieutenant of Mance Rayder, the King-Beyond-The-Wall. He subsequently appeared in Martin's A Dance with Dragons. Although initially antagonistic towards Jon Snow and the Night's Watch, he later proves to be a crucial ally in their fight against the White Walkers. Tormund Giantsbane is portrayed by Norwegian actor Kristofer Hivju in the HBO television adaptation, for which he has received positive reviews.  Character  Tormund, better known as Tormund Giantsbane or Tormund Thunderfist, is a famous wildling raider. On his massive arms he wears golden bands engraved with runes of the First Men, which have been passed down by his forefathers. Tormund is armored with heavy ringmail taken from a dead Night's Watch ranger. Like most of the wildlings, he is illiterate. He has four sons: Toregg, Torwynd, Dryn and Dormund; and one daughter, Munda. The often jovial Tormund enjoys food and drink, especially ale and mead, and likes cracking dick jokes. He is styled Tall-talker, Horn-blower and Breaker of Ice, Husband to Bears, the Mead-king of Ruddy Hall, Speaker to Gods and Father of Hosts. Mance Rayder named him Horn-blower for the power of Tormund's lungs, as it is said that Tormund can laugh the snow off mountaintops. Although Tormund is said to have slain a giant, he claims to have actually cut open the belly of a sleeping giantess and slept in her for warmth during a winter storm. Tormund claims the giantess, thinking he was a babe, then suckled him for three months in the spring. Tormund also claims to once have drunkenly slept with a bear. Tormund once thought to make himself King-Beyond-the-Wall, but he was defeated by Mance Rayder. He distrusts the men of the Frozen Shore.  Storylines  =In the books= Tormund is not a point of view character in the novels, so his actions are witnessed and interpreted exclusively through the eyes of Jon Snow.  A Storm of Swords  When Jon Snow is captured, Tormund is among those gathered in Mance Rayder's tent when Jon is presented to Mance. Jon is later attached to Tormund's war party, with Ygritte and Longspear Ryk joining as well. Tormund is friendly towards Jon, and Jon grows quite fond of him despite the distrust. Tormund joins in the singing of \\"The Last of the Giants\\", and encourages Jon to sleep with Ygritte. During the battle beneath the Wall, Jon spots Tormund and two of his sons near a siege turtle. When Jon goes to treat with Mance for the Night's Watch, Tormund is the first to greet him. He brings Jon to Mance's tent and defends Jon's right to speak, and during the negotiation Mance threatens to have Tormund blow the Horn of Winter to bring down the Wall. When Stannis Baratheon attacks the wildlings, Tormund leads a triple line of spearmen but are flanked and routed by Stannis's knights. Tormund escapes capture but his son Dormund is killed by Ser Richard Horpe.  A Dance with Dragons  With Mance a captive at Castle Black, Tormund leads a band of four thousand free folk beyond the Wall. He is forced to kill one of his sons, Torwynd, who dies from a chill and later rises as a wight. Tormund's daughter Munda marries Longspear Ryk, much to his chagrin. Jon Snow, now Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, and other officers expect that Tormund will besiege the undermanned Wall again. Jon sends Mance Rayder's sister-in-law Val to find Tormund and bring an offer of peace to him. When Jon meets with Tormund, Tormund dislikes the terms offered by the Night's Watch, but consents due to increasing attacks by the Others and the need to get his people south of the Wall. In accordance with the terms, Tormund has the free folk give their valuables to the Watch to help the Watch pay for food to feed the free folk, while a son is required as a hostage from each of their chiefs, a term implemented to prevent the free folk from raiding the lands belonging to various Westerosi. Tormund gives over his gold wristbands but though Jon insists he keep them due to their personal importance to Tormund, Tormund refuses; he will not let it be said he made the rest of his people give up their wealth while he kept his. Tormund also confides in a sympathetic Jon about the loss of his son. As part of the peace, the free folk warriors help the Night's Watch brothers garrison the abandoned castles along the Wall to defend it from the Others, while the non-martial free folk will be settled on the Gift and the New Gift. Jon re-garrisons Oakenshield as Tormund's seat, and takes on Tormund's son Dryn as his page. Another son, Toregg, burns the dead to prevent them from becoming wights. When Cotter Pyke's Eastwatch fleet report back desperate situations at Hardhome, Jon asks Tormund to help him rescue the stranded wildlings there. Later, Jon receives a threatening letter from Ramsay Bolton. Jon discusses the situation with Tormund for two hours. Tormund agrees to lead the ranging to Hardhome in Jon's stead while Jon deals with Ramsay. Jon calls for volunteers to march with him to Winterfell and confront Ramsay and the wildlings volunteer. However, after the meeting, Jon is attacked and stabbed by mutineers led by Bowen Marsh. =In the show= Tormund is played by Kristofer Hivju in the television adaption of the series of books. He is one of Mance's top generals, fierce and terrifying in combat. Season 3 When Jon Snow first arrives in the wildling camp, Jon initially mistakes Tormund for Mance Rayder, much to Tormund's amusement. Mance directs Tormund to lead a group of wildlings including Jon Snow and his captor, Ygritte, south of the Wall to await the signal of Mance Rayder to attack the Night's Watch. Season 4 After joining up with a clan of the cannibalistic Thenns, Tormund leads the wildlings in a rampage through the lands south of the Wall, including a sack of Mole's Town. During the Battle of Castle Black, he duels and severely wounds Ser Alliser Thorne, but is brought down by several arrows and taken prisoner. After his wounds are healed by Maester Aemon, Jon briefly talks with him, and Tormund tells Jon that Ygritte loved him, citing Ygritte's apparent desire to kill him as proof. He asks Jon to burn Ygritte's body north of the Wall. Season 5 Tormund is later present at Mance's execution and is saddened by his friend's death. Jon frees Tormund and they journey to Hardhome, where Tormund attempts to convince the local wildlings to ally with the Night's Watch against the White Walkers. When Hardhome is overrun by wights, Tormund and Jon fight them off and they, along with the surviving wildlings, escape to the boats. Jon takes Tormund and the wildlings south of the Wall and into Westeros. Season 6 After Jon's assassination by Ser Alliser and his mutineers, Tormund and the wildlings are summoned by Edd Tollett to help capture them. Jon is later resurrected by the red priestess Melisandre, and Tormund tells him that some of the wildlings believe him to be a god. Several days later, Jon's half-sister Sansa Stark arrives at the Wall fleeing her abusive husband Ramsay Bolton. Tormund is attracted to Brienne of Tarth and attempts to court her, although she doesn't seem interested in his advances. After Ramsay sends a letter to Jon threatening to kill Jon's half-brother Rickon and the wildlings if Sansa is not returned, Tormund persuades the wildlings to help Jon and Sansa defeat the Boltons. Tormund later participates in the Battle of the Bastards, killing Lord Smalljon Umber, biting off his ear in the process. Following the battle, he is amongst those who declare Jon King in the North. Season 7 Jon asks Tormund and the wildlings to reinforce defenses at Eastwatch-by-the-Sea, the Night Watch's fortress closest to Hardhome. Later, scouts find the Brotherhood Without Banners and Sandor Clegane attempting to pass through the Wall, and interns them in Eastwatch's ice cells. Later, Jon, Davos, Jorah Mormont and Gendry arrive, revealing that they need to capture a wight in order to convince Daenerys Targaryen and Cersei Lannister of the White Walkers' existence. Although displeased at having to ally with Jeor Mormont's son, Tormund, the Brotherhood, and the Hound join Jon's allies beyond the Wall. They successfully capture a wight but are soon surrounded by the White Walkers and their army of wights. However, Daenerys arrives with her dragons to rescue them but one of the dragons, Viserion, is killed by the Night King. As the Night King prepares to attack again, they are forced to leave Jon behind when Jon tells them to flee but he manages to return to Eastwatch. Tormund remains at Eastwatch while Jon, Daenerys, the Hound, and Jorah travel to King's Landing. Soon after, the White Walkers and their army finally march on the Wall. The Night King, which has reanimated Viserion, uses the dragon to destroy Eastwatch and the section of the Wall behind the castle, allowing the army of the dead to march on the Seven Kingdoms and seemingly trapping Tormund and Beric Dondarrion on top of the remaining part of the Wall. Season 8 Tormund and Beric manage to escape the Wall and retreat to Winterfell. Along the way, they stop at Last Hearth and find it has already been overwhelmed by the White Walkers. They encounter Dolorous Edd and the Night's Watch. Tormund realises that they must reach Winterfell to warn its defenders of the dead's proximity, and arrive on the eve of the White Walkers' arrival. Tormund fights in the ensuing battle and is amongst the survivors when the Night King is finally defeated. Afterward, Tormund tells Jon that he and his people are returning to their lands beyond the Wall after the worst of winter has passed. Jon asks him to take his direwolf, Ghost, with him, saying Ghost belongs in the far North. Following Daenerys massacring King's Landing after the city surrenders to her, Jon tries but fails to dissuade her from more destruction and ultimately assassinates her, for which he is exiled to the Night's Watch. Tormund and Ghost are reunited with Jon when he arrives at Castle Black. Jon and Ghost accompany Tormund as he leads the wildlings to return to their lands beyond the Wall.

It was built in 1844 by John Robinson, a longtime revenue commissioner in Madison County who became one of the county's largest landowners. During the Civil War, the house was used by the Union Army as an officers' quarters. The family vacated the house in the late 19th century, and during the Spanish–American War, the grounds were used as an army camp and hospital. In 1919, the house was purchased by the Dilworth family and restored from its poor condition. The house was later owned by Max Luther, a prominent local merchant. The Greek Revival house has a five-bay main block with two attached wings to the sides, an unusual layout for the time in Alabama. A portico spans the center three bays, and has four smooth Doric columns supporting a plain entablature and pediment. Pilasters with Doric capitals are present on the corners of both the main block and the wings, as well as terminating the portico. The main block has a gable roof, while the one-story wings have flat roofs with deep cornices forming parapets. There are four interior chimneys in the main block, and one each in the wings. The double entry doors have multi-pane sidelights and a transom. The interior is laid out with a large central hall on both floors, flanked by a pair of rooms on each side. Each wing features one room, with extensions built in the 1920s containing bathrooms. A kitchen was added to the rear in the 1940s.

Plot On one evening, Hong Kong's largest gang, the Hero Gang, uses an armed robot named Pioneer I to rob a bank and the police was unable to stop it. Maria (Sally Yeh) is a loyal member to the Hero Gang and its leader (Ben Lam) and did not hesitate to kill the mechanical maintenance staff who tried to escape. Master (Lam Ching-ying), an elder member of the gang was dissatisfied with Maria's style of cold-blooded killing. Maria later discovers that the leader is obsessed with robots and he created a female armed robot named Pioneer II, which was modeled after Maria's face. This leads Maria to develop a strong hatred towards Pioneer II. Reporter Chong Chi Keung (Tony Leung) was fired because he was unable to photograph Pioneer I during the bank robbery. Curly (John Shum), who works at the Research Department of the police force, invents a cannon that may be able to fight robots, which attracts jealousy from his superior. Whiskey (Tsui Hark), a young member of the Hero Gang, feels dissatisfied about the gang's development and resigns. Later, Whiskey meets and befriends Curly at a bar and he is suspected to have betrayed the gang and the Hero Gang sends Pioneer II to kill him. While chasing Whiskey, Pioneer II malfunctions and is taken away by Whiskey (who has a secret crush on Maria) and Curly. Afterwards, Curly was wanted by the police for suspected collision with the Hero Gang. Curly and Whiskey flees with the malfunctioned Pioneer II to a shack where Curly repairs its vanguard and reprogrammed it so that would only obey his commands, which also inadvertently causes it to produce human responses. Maria then brings Pioneer I to the shack to kill Whiskey. Curly commands Pioneer II to attack Pioneer I but the latter was armed with a \\"Counteract Bullets Device\\" making the former's attack ineffective. At this time, Master comes in masked and helps Whiskey and Curly escape the gang and flee to s shipyard. Reporter Chong also tracks them to the shipyard and performs a comedy skit with Pioneer II, who is gradually developing more human reactions. Chong then informs the police and Curly and Whiskey were arrested while Pioneer II fell into the hands of the Hero Gang again to be reprogrammed. Later, Chong begins to sympathize for Curly and Whiskey and sneaks into the base of the Hero Gang. With the hep of Master, Chong was able to escape with Pioneer II from there while Master gets into a fight. Master, who raised every member of the gang from childhood, was dissatisfied with the gang's recent development and wants to terminate the leader's plan to create robots. When he was fighting with the leader, Master discovers that he himself has been made into a robot by the leader. Master soon lost the fight and was captured. Chong gets Pioneer II to help Curly and Whiskey to escape from prison where afterwards, the four of them bring Curly's cannons to confront the Hero Gang at its base. Pioneer II fights the gang, Curly and Whiskey installs cannons around the base and Chong goes to save the soon-to-be executed Master. After defeating the gang, however, Pioneer II was captured by Pioneer I and Curly and Whiskey were suppressed by Maria and were unable to fire the cannons. At this time, Whiskey knocks down Maria to save Pioneer II and Pioneer II also ignores her own safety and shoots a cannon near herself and Pioneer I and destroys the robot it while saving Curly and Whiskey. The leader wants to activate the giant robot Pioneer III: The Ultimate Pioneer and escape. As the leader enters the navigation space of the robot, he was kicked off by Chong and Master whom had earlier sneaked in. Master and the leader fight on top of the robot's shoulder where Master uses the robots' giant joint to defeat the leader. Chong, however, mishandled the robot and flew up in the air but fortunately, Chong and Master successfully jumped out. The leader falls to his death from the roof and Maria also jumps off to die with him. In the end, Curly, Whiskey and the now anthropomorphic Pioneer II lead a happy lives together while Chong dashingly abandons the pictures he took.

Although during her life she must have been an influential person, not much is known for certain about her family relationships. The names of her parents have not come down to us and the identity of her husband is not beyond dispute. She is often seen as either the wife or grandmother of the High Priest at Thebes, Piankh,Morris Bierbrier, JNES 32 (1973), 311 but it has also been suggested that she may have been the wife of the High Priest Amenhotep.Ad Thijs, ZÄS 140 (2015), 54-69 As will be explained below, Hrere’s exact place in the family of Theban High Priests ultimately depends on two factors, neither of which has yet been resolved: # the identity of her daughter Nodjmet # the relative order of Herihor and Piankh Her relation to Nodjmet The only thing which can be established beyond doubt is that she was the mother of the lady Nodjmet whose mummy and funerary outfit have been found in the Great Royal Cache near Deir el Bahri.Kenneth Kitchen, The Third Intermediate Period in Egypt, 2nd revised Edition, Warminster 1996, 43-45 With the mummy of this Nodjmet two Books of the Dead, were found.Kitchen, o.c., 42-45 One of them, Papyrus BM 10490, now in the British museum, belonged to “the King’s Mother Nodjmet, the daughter of the King’s Mother Hrere”. Whereas the name of Nodjmet was written in a cartouche, the name of Hrere was not. Since mostly this Nodjmet is seen as the wife of the High Priest Herihor, who is also attested with royal titles, Hrere’s title is often interpreted as “King’s Mother-in-law”,Kitchen, o.c., 44 although her title “who bore the Strong Bull” suggests that she actually must have given birth to a king.Edward Wente, JNES 26 (1967), 173-174 However, recently, the common opinion that there was only one Queen Nodjmet has been challenged and the old view that the mummy found in the Royal Cache was that of the mother of Herihor rather than his wife has been revived. Although it is beyond dispute that Herihor had a queen called Nodjmet (this was already recognised by Champollion), Édouard Naville postulated in 1878 that Herihor must have had a mother called Nodjmet. He did so on the basis of Papyrus BM 10541, the other Book of the Dead found with her mummy. It is indeed remarkable that, although Herihor figures in P. BM 10541, Nodjmet nowhere in either of her two Books of the Dead is designated as “King’s Wife”. All the stress is on her position as “King’s Mother”, as if this was her only title relevant in relation to Herihor.Thijs, ZÄS 140 (2013), 54-69 The ruling family from the transitional period from the 20th to the 21st dynasty is notorious for the repetitiveness of names,Kitchen, o.c., 47 so Herihor having a homonymous wife and mother would in itself not be impossible or unlikely. If the Nodjmet from the Royal Cache was indeed the mother of Herihor, it follows that Hrere must have been the grandmother of Herihor rather than his mother(-in-law). In this position she could well have been the wife of the High Priest Amenhotep. However, the debate on this issue is still going on. The Late Ramesside Letters One of the “Late Ramesside Letters”, letter no.2, written by the Scribe of the Necropolis Dhutmose, mentions Hrere as being in Elephantine during a military expedition of Piankh. Since this seemed to imply that Piankh had his grandmother accompany him on the first part of a dangerous campaign, M. Bierbrier suggested that besides a Hrere A, the mother of Nodjmet, there may have been a Hrere B, the daughter of Nodjmet and the wife of Piankh.Morris Bierbrier, JNES 32 (1973), 311 The need for a second Hrere more or less ceased to exist when Karl Jansen-Winkeln proposed to put the pontificate of Piankh before that of Herihor.Karl Jansen-Winkeln, ZÄS 119 (1992), 22-37; GM 157 (1997), 49-74 In his model there was only one Hrere, who was both the wife of Piankh and the mother-in-law of Herihor. Her title “who bore the Strong Bull” now became related to her being the mother of the High Priest Pinuzem, who is believed to have taken on semi-royal status later in his career.

Large waterfall is called \\"Bobas\\"; its height is about seven metres. On the right slopes above the waterfall there is a source of drinking water that centuries has been connected with popular legends.

The sport can be played both indoors and outdoors. Walking football was devised as a competitive sport pre-1930, but Steve Bloomer of England football fame refereed the first reported fixture in 1932 between Derby and Crewe Railway Veterans. Coverage of a BBC Sports News walking football session in Bury in 2012 led to several other clubs taking up this version of the game. It has since become a current craze. Through the creation of the bespoke website Walking Football United, now thousands of teams and session have been developed all over the UK, with players now featuring in specific age categories - over 50s, over 60, and over 70s. The sport has also proved popular with women and is played from ages over 40 years. Though based on association football, the laws of the game established by the FA, from standard football, with the main difference being that if a player runs anywhere on the pitch they concede a free kick to the other side. This restriction, together with a ban on slide tackles, is aimed both at avoiding injuries and facilitating the playing of the sport by those whom are physically disadvantaged. The manner in which the sport is played promotes cardiovascular fitness whilst producing the least stress on the body. It also helps participants maintain an active lifestyle. In walking football the game has the ball not permitted to exceed head height. Different footballs are used in the indoor and the outdoor variations of the sport. When played indoors, a size 4 futsal ball is the preferred option. Outdoor games involve a traditional size 5 football. The size of the pitch can vary to suit different locations. The length should be from 20 to 40 yards and the width between 15 and 30 yards. The sport came to wider public attention in July 2014, when Barclays Bank aired a television advertisement featuring walking football to promote their services.Two further Barclays promotional short films featuring famous footballers playing the walking format had 5.5 million views worldwide, sparking a further huge interest in the game. The Governing Body of walking football in England is The FA (Football Association) based at Saint George’s Park. Other home nations, such as Wales and Scotland, have their own governing bodies. An International governing body was established to help promote and coordinate international matches between nations. This body is the International Walking Football Federation, based in Sutton Coldfield, England. They held the first walking football World Cup at Leyton Orient in 2019.

Represented by a single species, Electrotettix attenboroughi, which lived 18-20 million years ago, it fed primarily on moss, fungi, and algae. The genus name is derived from electrum, Latin for \\"amber\\", and Greek tettix, meaning \\"grasshopper\\". The species was named after Sir David Attenborough. The female measures 8 millimeters in length: the male is unknown. The species is distinguished from modern members of the Cladonotinae subfamily by the fact that it retains vestigial wings, a feature lost somewhere between the ancient specimens and more modern species. E. attenboroughi was identified from a collection of amber at the Illinois Natural History Survey, which had been stored in a cabinet under a sink since it was collected in the 1950s by entomologist Milton Sanderson.

Political career In 1982, Baldeh was elected to the House of Representatives but was ousted out in 1985. He was reelected to the House of Representatives in 1987 and became the secretary for the Ministry of Health in 1990. Baldeh also held the portfolio of Minister of Youth and Sports from 1992 until 1994. His tenure as an MP ended with the 1994 Gambian coup d'état. Arrest During the 1994 coup by Yahya Jammeh, Baldeh aligned himself with the APRC party. However, his relationship with the APRC weakened after he was arrested by the National Intelligence Agency for forging evidence in 2004. Baldeh was exonerated of the charges in June 2005. Exile After an attempted coup by Ndure Chum in 2006, Baldeh moved and lived in exile in Senegal from 2006 until his death in 2014. He died in Dakar, Senegal, on July 9, 2014 from stomach pains.

It was released for Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux on July 7, 2017, which followed a three-year long early access beta phase. Unturned allows players to create custom maps, cosmetics and mods using an in-game editor, and allows them to publish these maps on the Steam Workshop.Steam Community announcement Gameplay Unturned features several different game modes, all of which consist of the same basic concept of zombie survival. The game also has multiple difficulty settings. In the survival game mode, the player's character is spawned on a game map with clothes depending on their skill set. Players must find weapons and supplies to survive against the zombies. As the player progresses through the game, they gain experience points which can then be used for upgrades. Survival mode is also available in multiplayer. The greater aim is to survive, but the players may team-up or fight each other. Players must keep up their health, food and water, and radiation levels. Radiation damage can be obtained from getting hit by zombies or entering \\"deadzones\\" without proper hazmat protection. The game's multiplayer option has created a platform for multiple kinds of gameplay, such as survival, roleplay, creative, paintball and battle royale style arena matches where Nelson first started his development career. The game has a chance to give players a cosmetic item, like clothing or effects for their character, or camouflage or skins for weapons. Players can purchase keys, cases, and other items from the Steam Market. The game supports the use of the steam workshop to add custom items, vehicles, armor, and weapons to either enhance or change the basic experience. Many popular user-created maps are curated, and many custom skins for items in the base game are added with updates. However, although the game supports mods, the game's files are closed source and players cannot add new categories of assets, they instead must place their creations in an already existing category. The game has several maps available. Arena game mode is for multiplayer only. Players are spawned in the middle of a map with supplies and weapons scattered around. The winner is the last person, or the last team, alive. Players may die due to being slain by other players or by crossing the boundaries of the map. The game will also spawn helpful items like armor, attachments for guns, and the 3 types of health items. These items are essential, as the game has an intense bleeding out mechanic that can finish a player without medical supplies. The game will also spawn vehicles, which can enable players to avoid the border or roadkill other players. The arena mode grants a massive advantage to teams in arena mode. Since there is no separated solo/squad modes, solo players will be up against teams who can aid each other. The game does not require teams to fight each other, so multiple players can win. Players who want to make a team must join a shared Steam group. Arena maps also contain hidden easter eggs and secret spots, which can aid the player in battle. The game's story is spread out across all of its maps. On the Washington map, there is a lab belonging to a company known as Scorpion-7. Outside the lab, there is an overrun military unit and within the building, in the basement, there are canisters containing zombies in stasis, one of which is broken. An apology note can also be found in which it appears the writer was attacked before the note was completed. It is assumed that this lab was ground zero for the start of the outbreak. The exact origin and the cause of the outbreak remain vague, but it is heavily implied that the virus was inadvertently created through bioweapons research the company was conducting, and the outbreak was caused by the escape of a test subject from their containment. It is unknown how long the outbreak has been going on at the start of the game. The player is introduced as one of the few survivors, hence the name of the game, 'Unturned' which alludes to the idea that the player hasn't \\"turned\\" into a zombie. The player can help the Coalition, the organization fighting the outbreak and locating survivors. The player can take quests to help the Coalition, but as the game has no true campaign, no move is made to get rid of or cure the outbreak. In singleplayer, there are no other players or human NPCs except for in \\"safezones.\\" Development Unturned was developed by Nelson Sexton, an indie game developer from Calgary, Canada. He was only twelve years old at the time of Unturned first release. Sexton started his career with Roblox, creating two of the most-popular games on the Roblox site, Battlefield and Deadzone. Deadzone was a zombie-survival game similar to Unturned. Neither of Nelson's original Roblox games are still on Roblox, they were both made private due to Roblox being flooded with copies of both very popular games. Before Unturned was on Steam, it was played on web browsers and officially known as 'Unturned 1.0'. Unturned was originally listed in Steam Greenlight as 'Unturned 2.0' on the May 6, 2014. It was successfully voted in by the Steam community on May 28, 2014. After Unturned was accepted into the Steam store it underwent significant changes and became known as 'Unturned 3.0', which is the current version available to the general public. Shortly after this the game was officially released out of early access on July 7, 2017. Nelson Sexton is currently developing a newer version of the game, which is known as both 'Unturned 2' and sometimes 'Unturned 4.0'. This version is being completely developed from scratch in the Unreal Engine and Sexton has confirmed it will be free, just like all earlier versions of Unturned. Reception According to gaming website Kotaku, Unturned was one of the most-popular games on Steam in mid-2014. Both Kotaku and Rock, Paper, Shotgun characterized the game's popularity as unexpected, since the game is mainly developed by a single person without a major studio's resources. PC Gamer said that while Unturned had few real ideas on its own, it was a \\"simple, accessible survival- simulator\\" that players may enjoy provided they could \\"stomach the low production values\\".

A. sommerfeldti is one of three species in the ant genus Aphaenogaster to have been noted from fossils found in Baltic amber by William Morton Wheeler. History and classification When first examined, Aphaenogaster sommerfeldti was described from a pair of type specimen workers which are fossilized as inclusions in transparent chunks of Baltic amber. Baltic amber is approximately forty six million years old, having been deposited during Lutetian stage of the Middle Eocene. There is debate on what plant family the amber was produced by, with evidence supporting relatives of either an Agathis relative or a Pseudolarix relative. All the type specimens were collected over 125 years ago, and when first described were part of the University of Königsberg amber collection. The fossils were first studied by Austrian entomologist Gustav Mayr who placed the species in the genus Aphaenogaster. Mayr's 1868 type description of the new species was published in the Königsberg journal Beiträge zur Naturkunde Preussens. William Morton Wheeler in his 1915 paper The ants of the Baltic amber noted that the University of Königsberg collections then contained a total of fourteen workers, plus one unnumbered specimen. An additional three were present in the private collection of Professor Richard Klebs, who first interested Wheeler on working with Baltic amber ant specimens. Alongside A. sommerfeldti, three other Aphaenogaster species are known from European amber fossil, A. antiqua, A. mersa, and A. oligocenica. While both A. oligocenica and A. sommerfeldti are known from Baltic and Bitterfeld amber, A. mersa has only been found in Baltic amber and A. antiqua from Rovno amber. Description Overall Aphaenogaster sommerfeldti can be distinguished from the related Baltic amber species A. oligocenica in several ways. A. sommerfeldti individuals have an overall more sloped and curved mesonotum with the epinotum showing more tooth liked projections on the surface then seen in A. oligocenica. The other Baltic amber species, A. mersa, shows a more extensive amount of rugose structuring to the head, thorax, and body, with a reticulation in the structuring, while that of A. sommerfeldti is a longitudinal striate pattern. A. sommerfeldti shows a similar morphology to the living species A. subterranea from the warmer areas of southern Europe. The two species differ in the more upright spines on the epinotum of A. sommerfeldti. The head capsule of A. sommerfeldti is slimmer with thinner antenna segments and more complex rugosity on the rear of the capsule.

From left to right: the Torhaus, the Theater am Aegi, and the Headquarters of Nord/LB and of Sparkasse Hannover. The Aegidientorplatz, colloquially known as Aegi is a busy square in Hanover located above the U-bahn station of the same name. The square was named for the Aegidientor, one of the city gates of Medieval Hanover, which existed until 1780.  Aegidientor  Aegidientor in the Civic fortifications of Hanover Aegidientor as a decorative archway, circa 1830 From the Middle Ages, the Aegidientor was the southeastern gate in the civic fortifications of Hanover. The name - occasionally also written as Egidien Thor - derived from the nearby Aegidienkirche. The road from Hildesheim entered the city through this gate. The settlement of Eddingerode stood before the door; established in the ninth century, it later fell into ruin. The gate was first built in 1307. A multi-story inner tower-gate, with a passageway, stood in the middle of Breiten Straße (Broad Street). During the renovation of the city walls in 1504, a ward was built outside the walls, right next to the outer gatehouse (roughly in the middle of the modern Aegidientorplatz). After that, visitors entered the city by passing over the moat on a drawbridge, through the outer gatehouse, over a second bridge and through the inner gate. This arrangement was removed in the dismantling of the civic fortifications from 1763. Today there is a plaque at 7/10 Breite Straße, marking the former location of the medieval inner tower-gate. The tower had been demolished in 1748, by mayor Christian Ulrich Grupen in order to build the Aegidienneustadt.  Aegidientorplatz  In the course of the slighting of the civic fortifications after 1780, the remnants of the gate structure was demolished. The location of the Aegidientor was taken by the Aegidientorplatz (\\"Aegidientor square\\") from 1844. A checkpoint (somewhere near the end of Marienstraße) and a more decorative gate structure took over the last remaining functions of the city gate. This structure was itself demolished in 1859. The square was long characterised by a severely geometrical, classicising arrangement of streets. From 1872, a Horsecar stopped at the Aegidientoplatz, linking it to Kröpcke via Georgstraße.

Beginning in September 1968, a raised roadway was built above the square as part of the inner city ring, despite five construction stoppages to allow the construction of the Stadtbahn Hannover. It was opened to traffic on 1 November 1968.\\"Hannoversche Allgemeine Zeitung vom 20. September 1968\\", in Karl Schreeck Zum Bau der Aegi- Hochstraße, http://www.drehscheibe- online.de/foren/read.php?5,6913650,6915617#msg-6915617 This street, usually known as Aegi High Street or Aegi Bridge, was originally intended as a temporary measure, but remained in use until it was demolished on the 17 and 18 October 1998.haz.de: Fotostrecken Hannover, Hannovers Hochbrücken, http://www.haz.de/Hannover/Fotostrecken-Hannover/Hannovers-Hochbruecken#p8 The Aegi-High Street often had to be closed in winter due to ice build up, was only authorised for cars weighing under 3.5 tonnes, and limited to a top speed of 30 km/h. Planning for the reconstruction and renovation of the square began in 1996. At this time the Stadtbahn line 10 ended at Friedrichstraße (now the site of the NORD/LB building). By rearranging the Stadtbahn and demolishing the dilapidated High Street, a completely new arrangement was to be produced. This plan followed a general plan of the civil engineering department of city of Hanover and TransTeC-bau, a subsidiary of üstra. From the end of 1997 until 1999, the square was completely rebuilt. The Stadtbahn received a raised rail platform designed by the architectural firm Wiege and ran from Thielenplatz to the entrance of Aegidientorplatz. The space that had been opened up with the demolition of the High Street was used for additional turning lanes and also for a central Bus lane. Before the beginning of this project there was much discussion of whether the square could deal with its traffic load without the High Street. Traffic jams were predicted in all directions by many critics. The experience of the first years of operation has been that these predictions were not correct. Centre of Aegidientorplatz as a traffic island, with the Aegidienwald, a stylised birch forest In 2003 therefore planning begun for further renovations, which would begin in November 2004, after the waiting period for the previous project imposed by the Municipal Transport Financing Act had expired. The bus lane created in the previous project would be abandoned as far as the intersection with Hildesheimer Straße to permit an easier route for the buses. Some of the space was used for a new lane in the direction of Schiffgraben street. The remaining space was converted into the so-called Aegidienwald, designed by Dominik Geilker and Stefanie Schmoll, landscape architecture students at the Leibniz University Hannover, who were supervised by Professor Udo Weilacher and civil engineer Thomas Göbel-Groß. The planning and project management of the project was the responsibility of the architectural firm of Klaus Determann.  Buildings  Directly on the Aegidientorplatz is the Theater am Aegi, built in 1953, which has been a privately operated theatre for external performances since 1994. At the northern end of the square is an office complex used by the Norddeutschen Landesbank. The ensemble consists of five buildings, including a nine-story skyscraper. The travertine clad buildings were erected between 1956 and 1958.Dirk Böttcher and Klaus Mlynek (ed.):Hannover - Kunst- und Kultur- Lexikon: Handbuch und Stadtführer. Springe, zu Klampen, 2007. p. 34. . At the northeastern end of the square is the Hansa-Haus between the intersections of Arnswaldtstraße und der Marienstraße. This was erected in 1905/6, originally in the neo-baroque style.Sparkassenverband wird 125 Jahre alt, article on HAZ.de with an image of the Hansa-Hauses in its original form.

It is now a listed building.Conrad von Meding, \\"Das sollen Denkmale sein?\\", Hannoversche Allgemeine Zeitung 23 March 2010, p. 15 A notable example of urban planning on the Aegidientorplatz is the massive headquarters of the Norddeutschen Landesbank. Of architectural interest is the so-called Torhaus-Hannover located between Marienstraße and Hildesheimer Straße. This building overhangs the sidewalk by several meters, but for structural reasons could not rest on the Stadtbahn station below it. The weight of this portion of the building is therefore borne by large steel beams extending into the back part of the building. On the east side of the theatre, since 2012, an office building of the accounting firm Deloitte has been being built (completed: June 2014).Neunstöckiger Bürobau soll Aegidientorplatz bereichern, article in HAZ.de.

Initially, the Hanoverian architecture firm BKSP planned an office building with nine stories, later this was raised to ten.Neubau am Aegi wird ein Geschoss höher, article on HAZ.de. accessed on 9 June 2014. The facade of the new building, made of white concrete and natural stone should match the old Nord/LB building opposite it. On the same location, at the intersection with Hildesheimer Straße is an office building of VGH- Versicherung from 1950. For the bus stops of lines 100 and 120 on the square, Jasper Morrison designed functionalist stop as part of the artproject BUSSTOPS.

Created by the construction of the John T. Montford Dam in 1993, it is operated and used as a future tertiary water supply by the city of Lubbock, Texas and serves as a recreational spot for the region of West Texas. The surface area of the lake is with a mean depth of . Lake Alan Henry is located east of Justiceburg, Texas, and south of Lubbock.  Geography  Lake Alan Henry is located on the Double Mountain Fork Brazos River in West Texas. South of Lubbock and east of Justiceburg, the lake extends and has over of shoreline. Its elevation is lower than the city of Lubbock. Lake Alan Henry has a maximum depth of with an average depth of , and the water is typically murky-to-clear with a visibility depth of one to four feet. Lake water levels fluctuate moderately between two and four feet per year. Vegetation of the lake mainly consists of flooded trees. Operating at full capacity, Lake Alan Henry could potentially contain over 40 billion gallons of water. =Fish populations= Lake Alan Henry has been stocked with several different populations of fish in order to encourage recreational and fishing activities. Stocking of the lake began in 1993 with adult shads and gizzards. Between 1993 and 1994, Lake Alan Henry was stocked with largemouth bass, white crappie, smallmouth bass, channel catfish, and other assorted fish by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. Currently, a consumption advisory is in place for certain species of fish found in the lake due to concerns of high levels of mercury.  History  In the 1960s, the city of Lubbock moved forward with plans to create another water source for its growing population, and after years of soil studies and engineering research, the current location of the John T. Montford Dam was chosen as the closest and most suitable area for the structure and subsequent reservoir. After an application was approved by the Army Corps of Engineers, design work on the dam began in the 1980s. Construction started in 1991, and after two years, the dam was completed and began operation in 1993. The dam was named in honor of Senator John Thomas Montford for his efforts in legislation concerning the reservoir; likewise, Lake Alan Henry was named for a former mayor of Lubbock. In 1994, as the reservoir began to fill, a water sampling program was created by Lubbock city officials in order to establish baseline water quality data. Before its water can be officially utilized, it is projected three pumping stations, a new water treatment plant, and of pipeline are needed to be established in-between Lubbock and Lake Alan Henry. This would have a predicted maximum yield of 23 million gallons of water per day for Lubbock. Today, the lake is used primarily as a recreational spot for the surrounding areas; fishing, water skiing, hunting, and other outdoor activities (including hiking and camping) are the main draw for visitors to the lake.

As part of demobilization following World War I the NRFC was completely inactive by 1922; but it is remembered as the origin of the naval aviation component of the United States Navy Reserve, the Naval Air Reserve. Many Naval Reserve Flying Corps pilots trained in this Curtiss Model F seaplane. Background United States naval aviation inventory was six airplanes at the beginning of World War I. Four operated from Naval Air Station Pensacola and two were assigned to . The Navy organized an unfunded naval militia in 1915 encouraging formation of ten state-run militia units of aviation enthusiasts. The Naval Appropriations Act of 29 August 1916 included funds for both a Naval Flying Corps (NFC) and a Naval Reserve Flying Corps. Students at several Ivy League colleges organized flying units and began pilot training at their own expense. The NFC mustered 42 Navy officers, 6 United States Marine Corps officers, and 239 enlisted men when the United States declared war on 6 April 1917. These men recruited and organized qualified members from the various state naval militia and college flying units into the NRFC. Wartime A three-part pilot training program was implemented beginning with two months of ground school, followed by preliminary flight training teaching student pilots to fly solo, and advanced flight training to qualification as a naval aviator with a commission in the Naval Reserve Flying Corps. The first ground school for pilot training was at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The first class of fifty student pilots arrived on 23 July 1917 for an eight-week program covering electricity, signals, photography, seamanship, navigation, gunnery, aeronautic engines, theory of flight, and aircraft instruments. Later classes received an initial period of indoctrination and preliminary training aboard a receiving ship before assignment to ground school. Those who successfully completed ground school were transferred to naval air stations for flight training. In July 1918 parallel ground school programs began at the University of Washington in Seattle and at Dunwoody Institute in Minneapolis; but few graduates of these schools could be counted among the 18,000 naval aviation personnel who reached Europe before the war ended. United States naval aviation manpower had climbed to 37,407 when the First Armistice at Compiègne ended hostilities on 11 November 1918. Reservists accounted for 82 percent of this number. There were 6,716 officers and 30,693 enlisted men in Navy units, and 282 officers and 2,180 men in Marine Corps units. The number of qualified pilots was approximately 1,600. Awarding of naval aviator precedence list numbers in the sequence of pilot qualification did not begin until January 1918; and some duplicate or fractional numbers were awarded in subsequent attempts to appropriately place pilots qualified before that date. Several NRFC pilots achieved significant recognition. Charles Hammann was the only Navy pilot to be awarded the Medal of Honor during World War I. Stephen Potter of the second Yale University flying unit was the first Navy pilot credited with destruction of an enemy aircraft in aerial combat; and David Sinton Ingalls of the First Yale Unit was the only Navy flying ace of World War I. James Forrestal of the Princeton University flying unit was designated Naval Aviator number 154 and later became the first United States Secretary of Defense. Other members of the Yale Unit were Naval Aviator # 73 John Martin Vorys and Naval Aviator # 74 Kenneth MacLeish. Peacetime Funding was provided in 1920 for fifteen-day training periods at Naval Air Station Rockaway for a limited number of NRFC pilots; but no funding was available in subsequent years. Without the opportunity to continue flying, many pilots failed to re-enroll upon completion of their four-year obligation. Those who did were transferred from the NRFC to the Volunteer Naval Reserve Force. A few reserve pilots were able to fly periodically from Naval Air Station Rockaway, Naval Air Station Anacostia and Naval Air Station Squantum.

He has been teaching English as a Foreign Language worldwide since 1978 and is well-known for his lively, highly practical approach, materials, talks and teacher training. He now works freelance from his home in Brighton, and has evolved into a Latin America specialist. Education Seligson received his master's degree in Teaching English as a Foreign Language and is qualified as a CELTA (Certificate in Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages) assessor and London Chamber of Commerce & Industry (LCCI) examiner. Career Seligson began his teaching career in 1978, with International House in Algeria. Next he worked for the British Council, in locations such as Egypt, Venezuela and Spain, working five year in Valencia as the Assistant Director of Studies. He has also taught in Brazil, Argentina, Turkey and Mexico. He began writing in the United States, where he spent a year, then moved back to the United Kingdom, teaching English to immigrants and refugees. He also set up his own language school in Brighton. His work as a teacher trainer has included COTE (Certificate for Overseas Teachers of English), DOTE, CELTA, DELTA, FTBE (First Certificate for Teachers of Business English), graduate and post-graduate courses on four continents, as well as a stint from 2000 to 2001 with the Oxford University Press. Today he freelances as a writer, trainer and speaker at conferences, having given hundreds of sessions in English, Spanish, French and Portuguese and noted for his upbeat style and practical content. Seligson has also worked as a consultant in universities in Europe, North Africa, Asian and Latin America, along with observation programs in Spain, Turkey and Mexico. He strongly believes we can best accelerate teen and adult foreign language learning by anticipating, embracing and building on and around their existing linguistic knowledge. Post-primary learners inevitably translate most items until a very high level. So, rather than teach through immersion, as if to children, or through a non-specific, ‘general English programme’ as if to learners in a multi-lingual class, we should be focussing on making creative, efficient use of what they already know. In the case of Latin America, this would largely be from Spanish and Portuguese, but not forgetting the English they have picked up from song lyrics, video games, TV series, and elsewhere. Hence his new edition of Richmond’s English ID series and its follow-on, IDentities 1 and 2.

A condensed version, Anglès fàcil, was published in 2013 by BarcaNova. Paul says, ‘Latin American learners really can develop fluency significantly earlier, if we stop hiding what’s easy for them, tailor our teaching to their specific linguistic strengths and needs, celebrate and take advantage of all the common ground between English and their Latin-based languages’.

He was appointed by Barack Obama and began his term on December 19, 2014. Biography Amit Priyavadan Mehta was born in 1971 in Patan, Gujarat, India. Raised in Reisterstown, Maryland, Mehta graduated in 1989 from Franklin High School. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1993 from Georgetown University, graduating Phi Beta Kappa. He received a Juris Doctor in 1997 from the University of Virginia School of Law, graduating Order of the Coif. He served as an associate at the law firm of Latham & Watkins from 1997 to 1998, leaving to clerk for Judge Susan P. Graber of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit from 1998 to 1999. He served as an associate at the law firm of Zuckerman Spaeder, LLP from 1999 to 2002, and then as a staff attorney at the Public Defender Service for the District of Columbia from 2002 to 2007. From 2007 to 2014 he rejoined Zuckerman Spaeder, serving as partner from 2010 to 2014. He represented clients in civil and criminal matters before state and federal courts.Official Biography at Zuckerman Spaeder Federal judicial service Judge Mehta in 2015 On July 31, 2014, President Obama nominated Mehta to serve as a United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, to the seat vacated by Judge Ellen Segal Huvelle, who took senior status on June 3, 2014. He received a hearing before the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary on September 17, 2014. On November 20, 2014 his nomination was reported out of committee by voice vote. On Saturday, December 13, 2014 Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid filed a motion to invoke cloture on the nomination. On December 16, 2014, Reid withdrew his cloture motion on Mehta's nomination, and the Senate proceeded to vote to confirm Mehta in a voice vote. He received his federal judicial commission on December 19, 2014. In May 2019, Mehta ruled that accounting firm Mazars had to provide its records of Donald Trump's accounts from before his presidency to the House Oversight Committee in response to their subpoena. In a 41-page opinion, he asserted that Congress has the right to investigate potential illegal behavior by a president, including actions both before and after the president assumed office. The ruling will be appealed by Trump's personal legal team. In July 2019, Mehta sided with pharmaceutical firms Merck & Co., Eli Lilly & Co., and Amgen Inc., and blocked a Trump administration rule requiring drugmakers to put prices in television ads, a central part of the president’s push to lower the cost of prescription medications.

SR 160 splits from SR 25 and turns back to the north, running along the town border between Porter and Hiram. The highway crosses between the western edge of Hiram and northeastern corner of Porter twice before entering Brownfield.

Between Limerick and Brownfield, SR 160 is the westernmost north-south highway in the state. History Modern SR 160, as first designated in 1933, was in length and had its southern terminus at SR 25 near Kezar Falls in Porter. In 1937-8, the SR 160 designation was applied to a new routing through Parsonsfield southward to the current terminus in downtown Limerick. SR 160 was co-routed along SR 25 in Porter to connect the two segments, adding to the route's overall length. The first highway in Maine designated SR 160 was located in the extreme northern part of the state and ran between Saint Francis and Madawaska in 1925.

The firm is run by John Overdeck and David Siegel.The World's 100 richest Hedge Funds, Bloomberg Markets History Two Sigma Investments was founded in 2001 by John Overdeck, David Siegel and Mark Pickard. Siegel is a computer science Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and held the position of Chief Information Officer for D. E. Shaw & Co. prior to starting Two Sigma. Overdeck is an International Mathematical Olympiad Silver Medalist who subsequently studied mathematics at Stanford University and then rose to the position of Managing Director at D. E. Shaw prior to leaving to co-found Two Sigma. Pickard served as the President of the firm from its inception until his retirement in 2006. According to Two Sigma, the firm's name was chosen to reflect the duality of the word sigma. A lower case sigma, σ, designates the volatility of an investment's return over a given benchmark, and an upper case sigma, Σ, denotes sum. By adding together the volatilities of individual positions measured against the benchmark, Two Sigma can amplify forecast signals, the company's website says. In October 2013, Two Sigma Private Investments announced that it was joining with Stephen Hannahs to form Wings Capital Partners, a commercial aviation private equity, investment, advisory and financing company. In July 2014, it was announced that Simon Yates, Citigroup's global head of equity derivative sales and trading, left the bank to join Two Sigma. In 2016, Two Sigma Investments ranked 11th on Penta's Top 100 Hedge Funds. As of early 2017, Two Sigma had used crowdsourcing options to find trading signals. By March 2017, the fund was running a competition on Kaggle to code a trading algorithm. The fund managed around $8 billion in November 2011, $23 billion in October 2014, and $32 billion by the end of 2015. , the fund had assets reaching more than $50 billion. In May 2019, the fund had assets reaching $60 billion.  Technology  At the end of 2016, Two Sigma Investments introduced an artificial intelligence challenge called Halite. Halite is a programming game inviting coding enthusiasts to build smart bots whose goal is to gain control of a virtual grid. Due to the success of Halite I, Two Sigma decided to develop a second season of Halite called Halite II. This ran from October 2017 to January 2018, and in this version players competed for control of planets using ships. Fund information Two Sigma has been noted in the business press for its unusually high rate of return, comparable to its older and more mature competitors D. E. Shaw & Co. and Renaissance Technologies. In October 2014, Two Sigma had raised $3.3 billion for a macro hedge fund in one of the largest new pools of such capital raised since the 2008 financial crisis. There are a few specialized divisions which focus on private investments, venture capital investments (with a focus on companies operating in the realm of data science), advising institutional clients, and running a high frequency broker-dealer. Controversies =Accessing and duplicating confidential information= In February 2014, Forbes reported that former Two Sigma employee Kang Gao, aged 29, was prosecuted by the Manhattan District Attorney and is accused of using a remote-access device to view Two Sigma's proprietary trading models and emailing this information to his personal email account, lifting quantitative trading strategies, trading models, a marketing presentation, and a scientific white paper. The case, New York. v. Kang Gao, led to Gao receiving 8 months in jail as of October 2014.

History E. B. Scott was born in Gillingham, Kent, of a well-to-do family. His father was James Scott, of the Royal Navy. At the age of 16 years, he emigrated on Duke of Edinburgh to New South Wales, where he had a letter of introduction to John Macarthur, alas dead by the time Scott arrived. After a short time in Sydney he joined his brother John Mansel Scott, Master of the Revenue Cutter Ranger, at Port Phillip, then went to a station at Mount Macedon to experience sheep and cattle farming. This did not last long, as the station owner and his family were all drowned in a voyage from Sydney to Port Phillip, and the station was sold. In 1839 he joined his friend George Hamilton (later to be appointed Commissioner of the South Australia Police), droving a herd of cattle from Port Phillip to South Australia for William Mundy and Captain Smythe, reaching Adelaide in 1839. =With Edward John Eyre= In Adelaide he met Edward John Eyre and Alfred M. Mundy, (who became Colonial Secretary in the first South Australian Legislative Council under Governor Grey, and was to marry Jane, the eldest daughter of John Hindmarsh). He was invited to join them in an expedition to Western Australia with sheep and cattle, which were shipped from the North Arm of the Port River to Albany, Western Australia, then drove them overland to Perth. To conserve water most of the travelling was done by night. The trip was highly profitable. Back in Adelaide in 1840, Eyre was organising an expedition to find an overland route to Western Australia, and invited Scott to join him as travelling companion and second in command, sharing in all expenses (apart from a £100 grant from the Government). Eyre wrote in his journal: :\\"Mr. Scott, who ever since the commencement of our preparations had been most indefatigable and useful in his exertions, was even still more severely tasked on this day. At night, however, we were all amply rewarded by seeing everything completely and satisfactorily arranged; the bustle, confusion, and excitement over; and our drays all loaded and ready to commence on the morrow a journey of which the length, the difficulty, and the result were all a problem yet to be solved.\\" The party left Government House, Adelaide, on 18 June 1840. Somewhere past Crystal Brook, he wrote: :\\"My own time, when not personally engaged in conducting the party, was occupied in keeping the journals and charts and in taking observations in the daily register, of the barometer, thermometer, winds, and weather, and in collecting specimens of flowers or minerals. My young friend Mr. Scott was equally busy, for in many of these duties he assisted me, and in some relieved me altogether. ... He was the only sportsman of the party, and upon his gun we were dependent for supplies of wallabies, pigeons, duck, or other game to vary our bill of fare and make the few sheep we had hold out as long as possible. As a companion I could not have made a better selection — young, active, and cheerful— I found him ready to render me all the assistance in his power.\\" They set up a depot at Mount Arden (north of Quorn), and then Eyre started for the interior, setting out on horseback with one of his Aboriginal assistants and a pack horse to carry provisions, preferring not to subject the others to the difficulties and hazards of exploring unknown country. After 16 days fruitlessly trying to find a way to the interior, he returned. While Eyre was exploring, Scott was in charge of the depot, collected botanical and geological specimens, and took the routine observations three times a day. The party then moved from Mount Arden to Depot Pool, from which point Eyre again struck out for the interior. He followed Mount Deception Range, examining the watercourses, one of which he named the Scott. Failing to find a way to the centre of the continent, Eyre returned to Depot Pool. Here he rested for a time, and then made another attempt by another route. On 21 or 22 August Eyre wrote: — \\"Not having seen the native for the last two days I thought I might venture to explore the watercourse we were encamped upon, and set off on horseback immediately after breakfast, accompanied by Mr. Scott. ... Having tied up our horses Mr. Scott and I ascended to the top of the high cliff by winding along the ridges at the back of it. From its summit we had an extensive view, and I was enabled to take several angles. One of these high peaks, in the Mount Deception Range, I named the Scott. ... In the course of the morning Mr. Scott shot a rock wallaby of rather a large species, and many more were seen about the high, perpendicular cliffs, under which we had found water.\\" A few days later Eyre found another watercourse, which her named the Mundy. Eyre ascended Mt. Hopeless on 2 September and returned to the base depot. Abandoning hopes of reaching the centre of the continent from Depot Pool, Eyre made for Streaky Bay, to make his next base depot on the West Coast. Near Port Lincoln they came to a large rocky watercourse with large pools of fresh water. There they had the pleasure of a swim, and Scott shot several ducks; a welcome addition to their diet. On 1 October 1840, they came to a sheep station, owned by Mr. Driver, of which Mr. Dutton was the manager, where they were treated to hospitality. Dutton was to die two years attempting to drove cattle from Port Lincoln to the head of Spencer's Gulf. Eyre and his party proceeded to Port Lincoln, but found the town in a bad way and unable to supply the provisions they required. Scott hired an open boat from Dr. Harvey and with two men sailed her through a gale to Glenelg walked to Adelaide, and reported to Governor Gawler with Eyre's specimen collections, letters and despatches. Gawler placed a cutter, (presumably , with its own crew) at his disposal and sailed her back to Port Lincoln with the required stores. Eyre wrote: :\\"Mr. Scott had managed every thing confided to him admirably, and I felt very greatly indebted to him for the ready and enterprising manner in which he had volunteered to undertake the voyage from Port Lincoln to Adelaide in an open boat, and the successful manner in which he had accomplished it\\" They set up their next base at Fowler's Bay. Eyre made several attempts to round the head of the Great Australian Bight. In one attempt three of his horses died. He decided to reduce the size of his party, sending two back to Adelaide in the cutter, leaving Scott, the overseer Baxter, one man and two native assistants. Eyre determined to make one more attempt to get round the head of the Bight. On 29 December 1840 he left the depot with Baxter and one of the natives, leaving the sheep, and four horses in charge of Mr. Scott and the other native. On this occasion Eyre reached the head of the Bight and returned to the depot at Point Fowler on 16 Januarv 16 1841. Eyre would have liked to send Scott with provisions to set up a forward base at Cape Arid, but Gawler had insisted that the cutter not leave the waters of South Australia, so he set off alone with his two native assistants, and Scott returned to Adelaide. Eyre wrote in his journal: :\\"It now became my duty to determine, without delay, who were to be my companions in the perilous attempt before me. The first and most painful necessity impressed upon me by the step I contemplated was that of parting with my young friend Mr. Scott, who had been with me from the commencement of the undertaking, and who had always been zealous and active in promoting its interests as far as lay in his power. I knew that, on an occasion like this, the spirit and enterprise of his character would prompt in him a wish to remain and share the difficulties and dangers to which I might be exposed; but I felt that I ought not to allow him to do so. I had no right to lead a young and enthusiastic friend into a peril from which escape seemed to be almost hopeless: and. painful as it would be to us both to separate under such circumstances, there was now no other alternative. ... I took the opportunity, whilst walking down the beach with Mr. Soott, of explaining the circumstances in which I was placed, and the decision to which I had been forced. He was much affected at the intelligence, and would fain have remained to share with me the result of the expedition, whatever that might be, but I dared not consent to it.\\" Eyre, Baxter, three Aborigines, nine pack horses, a Timor pony and six sheep set off from Fowler's bay on 25 February 1841. After a series of privations which included the murder of Baxter on 29 April and the decamping of two of the natives, Eyre and the third Aborigine, Wylie, arrived at a bay near Esperance, Western Australia, where they met with the French whaler Mississippi and were given hospitality and supplies by Captain Rossiter, then on 7 July arrived at Albany. Eyre had achieved his goal, but at a considerable price. =Public servant and pastoralist= Scott assisted Lieutenant Pullen in his task of surveying Lake Albert and the Murray mouth, and in 1841 mate on Pullen's boat Water Witch, which he negotiated from Wellington to Moorundie (5 km downstream from Blanchetown) on the River Murray, a distance of about .Mudie, Ian Riverboats Sun Books Melbourne 1965 pp. 200–205 This journey helped establish Moorundie (often spelled \\"Moorundee\\") as the first European settlement on the River Murray in South Australia, and Eyre (who had explored the area in 1839) was appointed there as the Resident Magistrate and Protector of Aborigines. He assisted Eyre in founding the Government station at Moorundie, which was established by Governor Grey to protect \\"overlanders\\" from the hostile attacks of the natives. He assisted Eyre in mapping parts of the River Darling which had been missed by Major Mitchell. He established a cattle station at North West Bend (near the current-day Morgan), but lost money on the project, as did later lessees and owners Philip Levi and Charles H. Armytage. In 1847 he succeeded Eyre at Moorundie as magistrate, Sub- Protector of Aborigines (appointed 1848), inspector of native police, and returning officer. Eyre left for England and never returned to South Australia. Around this time Scott married and started a family. Scott remained at Moorundie until 1857, when the position was abolished by the Government. In 1856, he took over Moorna station (later occupied by John Crozier), near Wentworth, New South Wales, where in 1858 he lost everything in a fire. They headed inland again, to Ki station, below Euston, New South Wales, where they worked for three years, but were driven back to Adelaide by drought around 1866. Riverboats Scott was a passenger from Wentworth on Bunyip in December 1863 when that boat was destroyed by fire just after she entered the Murray. Two crew members and two passengers died in the flames or were drowned. Scott was conspicuous in the rescue of several passengers. =Public servant again= He was appointed acting Protector of Aborigines in 1867; in the first 6 months he travelled on inspection tours of the 58 depots of this department. and developed outposts for the SA police Force including Overland Corner. In 1869 he was appointed supervisor of the Dry Creek Labor Prison, known as \\"The Stockade\\", now Yatala Labour Prison. He resigned October 1892 and was replaced by Robert H. Edmunds (1834 – 12 February 1917). He retired to his home, \\"Hamilton Lodge\\", Currency Creek, where he died after a short illness.

The explosions occurred later at 23:57 on Yisin Road, Ersheng Road, Sanduo Road and Guanghua Road. Witnesses reported seeing fireballs soaring into the sky and flames reaching 15 stories high. The blasts ripped up roads, trapped and overturned cars and firetrucks, and caused a blackout to the electrical grid. About 6 km of road length were damaged. The explosions reportedly blew cars and motorcycles high up in the air; some vehicles and victims were found at the rooftops of buildings three or four stories high. One street had been split along its length, swallowing fire trucks and other vehicles. Premier Jiang Yi-huah stated that there had been at least five blasts around the city. The blasts cut gas supplies to 23,600 households, electricity to 12,000 households, and water to 8,000 households. Firefighters from Kaohsiung City, Chiayi City, Pingtung County, Tainan City and Taitung County rushed to the scene to extinguish the fires and help the rescue efforts.

Paramedics, search and rescue dogs and helicopters swept the area looking for survivors. Heavy construction equipment was brought to the blast site to begin removing debris from the street. Schools and offices were closed on that day and residents were asked to leave their houses to smooth out the search and rescue operations. By afternoon, hundreds of people who fled the explosion scenes had returned home after houses around the explosion areas had been declared safe by the city spokesman. They confirmed that no more explosions could happen and that all of the fire had been put out. Traffic restrictions were put in place on Sanduo, Guanghua, Yixin, and Kaisyuan Roads. Taiwan Area National Freeway Bureau also closed the northbound exit from Sun Yat-sen Freeway to Sanduo Road. However, Kaohsiung MRT and buses were not affected by the search and rescue works. To help the city in the rescue efforts, at 22:30 on Friday night the Taiwan Power Company (Taipower) shut down their four sets of generators fed with liquid natural gas, even though none of their pipelines had been damaged during the explosions. The shutdown lowered Taiwan's total electricity output by 1,100 MW, or about 2.7% of the total capacity. The decision to stop the supply was reached after a discussion between the Kaohsiung City Government and the oil refinery CPC Corporation, so that road repair and other disaster relief work could proceed without interruption. With their total generation expected to reach 36,970 MW in the peak hours of the coming week, Taipower has an excess capacity of 3,170 MW and thus can still meet the local energy demand in Kaohsiung. As a precaution, China Petrochemical Development Co., which also operates in Kaohsiung, reduced the gas pressure in its propene pipelines. On Sunday, another 1,885 servicemen were deployed for the search and rescue operation at the explosion sites, bringing the total servicemen deployed during the incident to 5,567 people. Included among the servicemen were the chemical detection troops who continued to monitor any leaking gas. Equipment such as 22 ambulances, three chemical-detection vehicles, 13 excavators, 26 life detecting monitors, and other equipment were also being used in the rescue efforts. The rescue works attracted many passerby to watch, wander, or even for an \\"adventure date\\" in conjunction with Chinese Valentine's Day, a move considered disrespectful for the dead. The police had to ask them to leave and ask the public to stay away from the areas where the explosions occurred, citing the fragility of the ground or the ruined buildings around. = Immediate aftermath = The remaining 260 tons of propene inside the damaged pipes was vented out completely by Monday from both of their input and output points. Nitrogen gas was put into pipes ensuring all propene had been removed, a move which had been done earlier by the CPC. The Environmental Protection Administration also had dispatched personnel to Kaohsiung to assist local government in air pollution monitoring. On 5 August, the Kaohsiung District Prosecutor's Office issued the death certificates of two missing firefighters who had fought the fires caused by the gas explosions, despite their bodies having yet to be found. The prosecutors said that rescuers could not find the bodies and suspected that they might have been vaporized from the explosions. On 8 August, another gas leak was reported in Cianjhen District shortly before 7:50 a.m causing widespread panic among residents. People who lived within 150 meters radius of Kaisyuan 3rd Road were evacuated the city police department to Kaohsiung Municipal Guanghua Junior High School and Le Chyuan Elementary School, raising concern among residents over their safety. Authorities tried to pin down the source of the gas and they dispatched personnel to the intersection of Yisin and Kaisyuan Roads. The gas concentration level reading peaked at 5,000 ppm at around 11 a.m which was mostly methane. However, by 14:30 the concentration level finally dropped below 10 ppm. Early measurements indicated that at least four gases leaked were methane, propene, ethylene and butane. On 9 August, the Kaohsiung City Government ordered LCY to halt all of operations until its plan to improve pipeline safety had been reviewed by the government. Should LCY refuse to do so, the government would notify the Taipower and Taiwan Water Corporation to stop providing the company with electricity and water respectively.  Investigation  sewer system creating trenches. The Minister of Economic Affairs Chang Chia-juch, acting as the Director of the Central Emergency Operation Center, suspected that the explosions were caused by a propene leak, and the firefighters could not extinguish the fires with water. Emergency workers had to wait until the gas had burnt away after the supply was shut down. It is suspected that the affected pipelines were those used for gas delivery to the petrochemical factory LCY Chemical Corp. (LCY; ). The affected pipelines were designed and constructed by the government-owned CPC Corporation. However, CPC said that the pipeline system did not show any sign of problems before the explosion. The gas pipelines were approved in 1990 by Vice President Wu Den-yih, who served as mayor of Kaohsiung from 1990 to 1998, and the construction was completed in 1994. The pipelines had not been properly inspected for 24 years. The Kaohsiung City Government found out that a pipeline delivering propene to Ren Da Industrial Park was found to encounter abnormal pressure between 20:40 and 21:00 the night the gas leak was discovered. Pressure in the LCY piping system used to transport propene from one of its suppliers began to show abnormality starting 20:00 Thursday night and 3.77 tons of propene leaked between 20:00 and 21:00 The company did not shut down the pipe until 23:40, 16 minutes before the first gas explosion occurred. The concentration of the propene at the explosion site was abnormally high at 13,000 ppm. In a press conference on Friday, LCY CEO said that the company is fully cooperating with the authorities in the investigation and the company will bear the responsibility if found guilty. During a press conference on Sunday at the Taiwan Stock Exchange in Taipei, LCY said that it was the responsibility of CPC to design and check the gas pipes. CPC responded that the pipes belonged to LCY and CPC did not have any maintenance contract with them. LCY further explained that detecting pressure drops indicating gas leaks was the responsibility of the China General Terminal and Distribution Corporation (CGTD; ), who transport LCY's petrochemicals through the pipes. LCY claimed they first detected abnormalities when the propene supply completely ceased at 8:49 p.m and returned to normal half an hour later. At 22:35, they detected further problems, shutting down transporting immediately. According to Kaohsiung's top environment official, though, 3.77 metric tons of gas had leaked already between 20:00 and 21:00, and the pipe system was only shut down at 23:40 - just 16 minutes before the explosion. On 5 August, the Kaohsiung District Prosecutors Office (KDPO) retrieved documents and records related to propene transport after they raided LCY and CGTD offices a day before. Several employees were brought to the prosecutors office for questioning. To better investigate the causes of the accident, KDPO also invited domestic metal and petrochemical experts to the blast areas to collect evidence. On 18 December, the CEO and five employees of LCY Chemical, three employees of China General Terminal and Distribution, and three employees of the Kaohsiung Public Works Bureau were indicted for their role in the incident. The indictment charges these three groups with negligence, due to their failure to inspect or maintain the pipeline.  Reactions  Taiwanese flag flown half-mast at the Presidential Office Building for three days starting on 5 August 2014. = Domestic = President Ma Ying-jeou ordered full rescue efforts to help the blast victims. During his visit to Kaohsiung on Saturday to visit injured patients in hospitals and view the explosion sites, President Ma vowed to fully investigate the cause of the incident and to review the underground piping networks, stressing the need for a more comprehensive design and efficient management. During his inspection of the damage in Kaohsiung, Premier Jiang Yi-huah, ordered the Taiwanese national flag to be flown at half-mast for three days starting 5 August to commemorate the victims of the gas explosions and also the TransAsia Airways Flight 222 crash a week before in Penghu County. Vice Premier Mao Chi-kuo said during the rescue and relief effort works that public utilities companies would work hard to resume power and water supplies within three to five days. Taiwan Power Company said that power supply to about 3,900 households in less-affected areas should resume in two days, while temporary overhead lines set up to supply the worst-hit areas were expected to allow electricity to resume in three days. Taiwan Water Corporation said that the city government agreed to temporary water pipelines to supply the affected areas within five days. However, there was no schedule set up to resume the gas supply for the affected areas. Kaohsiung City Mayor Chen Chu said that schools and offices in the affected districts were closed the day after the explosion to facilitate search and rescue. She ordered gas supply companies CPC Corporation and Hsin Kao Gas to cut off gas delivery along the gas pipelines after the first explosion occurred. Mayor Chen asked President Ma to study and review the underground petrochemical pipeline system in Kaohsiung to avoid similar accidents in the future, which could eventually involve rerouting to avoid densely populated areas. She also asked the central government to help Kaohsiung City Government to replace all of the ageing pipes, many of which have been in operation for a period of 20–30 years, and in some cases for more than 40 years. The Ministry of National Defense deployed around 1,600 soldiers for the rescue operations, including 131 transport vehicles, 29 ambulances, 3 fire trucks, 3 chemical-detection vehicles, 15 engineering machines and other equipment. The ministry also provided blast victims with free accommodations at military bases. Mayor Chen's party, Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), suspended all of their upcoming municipal and local election activities scheduled for November after an emergency meeting chaired by Chairperson Tsai Ing-wen. DPP also asked other municipalities and counties led by DPP to help with the rescue efforts in Kaohsiung. The ruling Kuomintang party also suspended all of their upcoming activities. Several major festivals in Taiwan, such as Qixi Festival and Dadaocheng Fireworks Festival, were cancelled as a result of the incident. The Financial Supervisory Commission announced on Friday that it had instructed insurance companies to provide expedited insurance claims to all affected individuals and businesses in the area. They also stated that individuals and businesses may apply to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for assistance. Public reactions towards the government have been largely negative, criticizing what was seen as a slow response by the authorities to stop and isolate the gas leak after it was first reported. In wake of the disaster, many local residents have said that the government should relocate the gas pipes away from their neighborhoods. One resident claimed that he had notified city authorities prior to the explosion when he smelled a gas odor near his apartment. However, authorities told him that the situation was under control and had been declared safe after police and firefighters arrived at the scene. Kaohsiung city authorities responded to these criticisms by saying that had residents been evacuated prior to the explosions, there may have been even more fatalities, since most of the injured or dead were those on the roads at the time of the incidents. According to Taipower, staying indoors was the best precaution that could be taken for people facing such a disaster. The Kuomintang caucus of the Kaohsiung City Council sued Mayor Chen Chu for negligence that led to loss of life. The Democratic Progressive Party caucus responded by filing a lawsuit against former Kaohsiung mayor Wu Den-yih, for \\"illegitimately\\" allowing the pipelines to be buried. Wu then publicized documents stating that the pipes were installed before his leadership of Kaohsiung. = International = Banner displayed by local residents to show support for Kaohsiung. * – Xi Jinping, serving as General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, conveyed condolences over the Kaohsiung explosions through the Taiwan Affairs Office.

Relief efforts  Taiwanese army soldiers during the search and rescue period at Sanduo 1st Road on Friday after the explosion A total of ten emergency shelters consisting of several schools and a cultural center were used for the 12,000 people who had evacuated overnight. Many people, including high school students, had volunteered to help the post-disaster relief efforts by helping with the relief supplies distribution and offering of other services, such as counseling. Dozens of hotels around Kaohsiung offered temporary free lodging, laundry and washroom facilities for the people who were left homeless after their houses were damaged by the blast. Restaurants, supermarkets and convenience stores also provided various kinds of supports. Relief supplies and works, such as food, blanket, sleeping bags, bottled water, injury and emergency assistance, counseling and funeral arrangements, were made possible by the Tzu Chi Foundation, the Kaohsiung Branch of the Taiwanese Red Cross, the Sunshine Social Welfare Foundation and many other foundations. Religious rituals were also held at the blast sites for grieving relatives who had lost their loved ones. Donations also came from enterprise sectors, such as Formosa Plastics Group, Advanced Semiconductor Engineering, Inc., Foxconn, Kinpo Group, Acer Inc., HTC, E-United Group, Chailease Holding Co., MediaTek, Fubon Financial Holding Co., Capital Bus Company, Taipei Bus Company, Shanghai Commercial Bank, Tripod Technology, RT-Mart, Taiflex and many others. Companies such as FamilyMart, 7-Eleven, Chinese Television Service and Videoland Television Network also organized fund-raising drives and events for the blast victims. Taiwanese businesses operating in Beijing and Shanghai also joined in donating money for the blast victims.Taipei's 307 bus route to donate day's income chinapost.com Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-pin offered NT$200,000 to the families of the blast victims.

In a joint statement, five leaders from the DPP-controlled counties and municipality pledged to donate one month of their salary to the blast victims, which are Chiayi County Magistrate Helen Chang, Pingtung County Magistrate Tsao Chi-hung, Yilan County Magistrate Lin Tsung-hsien, Yunlin County Magistrate Su Chih-fen and Tainan City Mayor William Lai.KAOHSIUNG DISASTER: DPP officials pledge one month of salaries to relief taipeitimes.com Taiwanese singers such as Kenji Wu, Mayday, and Peter Ho and Chinese mainland singer Ding Dang joined the public in giving donations to support the blast victims, since many of their relatives also live in Kaohsiung. The Ministry of Culture launched a poetry drive to honor the blast victims posted on the ministry's Facebook page. Culture Minister Lung Ying-tai herself contributed a poem entitled If I Had Known Earlier (). The Ministry of Health and Welfare has been providing services to hold counselings to help residents to go through posttraumatic stress disorder by mobilizing medical personnel and social workers to the affected district areas. The services will be in place for the next two to three months. Despite the donations and support Kaohsiung had received, many victims complained that they had to wait in line for more than two hours to get them. Some people were also caught on camera pretending that they were the explosion victims or taking turns in group to get the donations several times more than what they were supposed to get. As of 7 August, a total NT$2.38 billion worth of donations had been received from companies and individuals, with another NT$1.6 billion funds agreed to be provided by the Executive Yuan.  Restoration works  Heavy vehicles mobilized for reconstruction works at Kaisyuan 2nd Road. The initial estimation of the total damage done to Kaohsiung City due to the blast reached around NT$1.9 billion for rebuilding the damaged roads and drainage system. However, the cost may arise higher if the cost to rebuild damaged buildings and to compensate victims are included in order to get their live back on track as soon as possible. The rebuilding of the 6 km damaged road began on Monday by road resurfacing. Sanduo Road work was done by Maintenance Office of the Kaohsiung City Government, Yisin Road by New Construction Office and Kaisyuan Road by Water Resources Bureau. The restoration works included the repaving of the roads, reparation of the damaged sidewalks and replanting of trees along the road which would cost around NT$600 million. The restoration of the rain water drainage system under the road will take around three months which costs another NT$600 million. Around 1,500 stores along the damaged roads are affected with the reconstruction work of the roads, which lead the owners to temporarily close their stores due to lack of customers. Some of the business owners at Kaisyuan Road are already looking for relocation than waiting for the roadwork to finish in months. The Economic Development Bureau had received registrations from 1,275 companies so far for compensation related to the disaster. The bureau added that the city government will give tax reductions for the affected stores and will construct temporary paths to allow access to the areas without roadworks, and businesses could also apply for social aid.KAOHSIUNG DISASTER: Businesses facing loss of customers during repairs taipeitimes.com In the coming days after the explosions, restoration and reconstruction works had mostly been hampered, delayed or sometimes halted by heavy rain and the excessive flooding around the area due to the rain. Trenches created from the blasts were flooded and water flow was blocked due to the damaged sewage, culverts and drainage system. Water pipes had been utilized to minimize flooding in some areas of the city. Armies and fire fighters also were put on standby ready to be deployed with life rafts whenever needed. On 20 November 2014, the Sanduo, Kaisyuan and Yishin Roads were finally opened again for traffic after restoration works. In the end of December 2014, in order to revive the economic activities to the affected stores and shops area, the Kaohsiung City Government held lucky draws and other promotional sales to attract consumption at those stores.  Aftermath  = The petrochemical industry = Share prices of several Taiwanese petrochemical companies took a dive in the aftermath of the explosions, especially those operating in Kaohsiung, with LCY shares dropping 30% in the days following the explosion. Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs Woody Duh said that the ministry would set up a system soon to help check the underground pipelines and build a database for safety management in the future, starting from Kaohsiung and followed by other cities, municipalities and counties. Duh mentioned that relocation of the Kaohsiung underground pipelines would be considered once the roadworks are completed. Taipei City Government ordered mandatory inspections of all four major gas pipelines in Taipei within a week after reports of gas leakage smell in Zhongshan and Wanhua Districts for five consecutive days. Great Taipei Gas had earlier inspected the site and found no immediate danger, adding that the firm had sealed the leaks and plans to change the pipes. Still at Zhongshan District, the gas company did some maintenance work to the reported gas leak near Songjiang Road. On Friday, Taipei Deputy Mayor Chen Hsiung-wen led an inspection of a gas storage unit in Neihu District and said that underground gas pipelines crossing Taipei City carry low-pressure gas and do not carry any chemical substances. He also added that major gas suppliers are required to inspect all of their pipelines within a week. The city government also later on launched a website for Taipei residents to check what types of underground cables and pipelines running near their houses, ranging from electric lines, telecommunication lines, and pipelines used to transport sanitized water, waste water, rain water, natural gas and oil. Few days after the blast, Premier Jiang Yi-huah appointed the Ministry of Economic Affairs to gather and sort out Taiwan's entire underground petrochemical pipeline network information and to establish a management system to avoid similar accidents from happening in the future, adding that such a management system would help local governments to determine which petrochemical pipelines need to be relocated and which ones can stay in place. A People First Party legislator called on the local governments to form agencies that deal with chemical hazards and employ trained professionals to oversee disaster management, and to better educate firefighters on the nature of different chemicals in order to make correct decisions and reduce casualties. = Criticism and resignation of government officials = On 6 August, Premier Jiang Yi-huah and Economic Affairs Minister Chang Chia-juch came under fire and were asked to step down by demonstrators after Jiang's \\"Three Noes\\" remarks on 4 August stating that there were no need for a special provision bill, financial assistance through special budget allocation, and a dedicated agency to administer post disaster relief and reconstruction for Kaohsiung. Also on the same day, residents and DPP councilors of Kaohsiung City Council went to Taiwan Kaohsiung District Court to protest against LCY in an attempt to prevent the company from avoiding compensation payments over the gas blasts. Mayor Chen said that Kaohsiung City Government had frozen firm assets and properties worth around NT$1.9 billion as a precautionary measure. On 7 August, in order to take the responsibility for the blast, Kaohsiung City Deputy Mayor Wu Hong-mo, Water Resources Bureau Director Lee Hsien-yi, Public Works Bureau Director Chen Tsun-yung and Kaohsiung Mass Rapid Transit Bureau Director Chen Tsun-yung tendered their resignation, a move which Mayor Chen praised and that she approved and stated that the resignation would take effect after the relief works ended. In the evening, the Ministry of Economic Affairs issued a statement saying that Minister Chang Chia-juch and Deputy Minister Woody Duh had also tendered his resignation earlier at 10 a.m. to the Executive Yuan due to the difficult political environment as a result of persistent boycott by opposition parties over several economic policies in the past 1.5 years. Despite Premier Jiang Yi-huah efforts to persuade Chang to stay in his ministerial position, the Executive Yuan finally approved his resignation on 10 August and appointed Deputy Minister Woody Duh to replace Chang. = Memorial services = Funerals for the deceased was held on the same day at Kaohsiung municipal mortuary, attended by Vice Premier Mao Chi-kuo, Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu, Minister without Portfolio Yang Chiu-hsing, DPP Chairperson Tsai Ing-wen and also LCY Chairman Bowei Lee. Lee bowed his head to apologize to the families of the blast victims, promising them that the company would provide good financial compensation to them. On 12 August, a national religious service was held in Kaohsiung Arena, bringing together around 10,000 people from 30 local religious groups covering Buddhism, Christianity, Islam and Taoism. President Ma Ying-jeou, who also attended the event, commended the soldiers and firefighters who risked their lives in saving life of the people. He reassured the audience that the government would provide the necessary assistance to help Kaohsiung residence back to their normal life as soon as possible. He also expressed his gratitude to the business and volunteers who had made generous contributions to the relief and reconstruction efforts after the blast disaster.

Service Employees International Union, 567 U.S. 298 (2012), is a US constitutional law case. The United States Supreme Court held in a 7-2 decision that Dianne Knox and other non-members of the Service Employees International Union did not receive the required notice of a $12 million assessment the union charged them to raise money for the union's political fund.. In a tighter 5-4 ruling, the court further held that the long-standing precedent, the First Amendment requirement that non-union members covered by union contracts be given the chance to \\"opt out\\" of special fees was insufficient. Setting new precedent, the majority ruled that non-members shall be sent notice giving them the option to opt into special fees. Background Under Abood v. Detroit Board of Education (1977) states may allow unions to charge nonmember workers “fair share” fees to prevent the free rider problem of nonmembers benefiting from a union's collective bargaining gains. Nonmembers must annually opt out of paying full union membership dues after the union sends a Hudson notice of what portion of the dues is chargeable to collective bargaining costs.. California is one of the states that allow for such an “agency shop”. Arnold Schwarzenegger won a recall election against California Governor Gray Davis in November 2003. Governor Schwarzenegger then proposed a broad fiscal reform agenda and called a 2005 special election to pass several ballot proposition and initiative constitutional amendments.Richard Hasen, Assessing California's Hybrid Democracy, 97 Cal. L. Rev. 1501 (2009). One of these, Proposition 75 would have required union nonmembers to affirmatively opt into paying full union dues instead of needing to opt out. Service Employees International Union Local 1000 is the largest labor union in California, with bargaining rights for half of all California state employees. In June 2005 SEIU sent out its annual Hudson notice, giving nonmembers thirty days to opt out of union dues and only pay a fair share fee. Shortly after the opt out deadline expired SEIU mailed a notice to all workers announcing an emergency fee to build a “Political Fight Back Fund”. The fee was then automatically deducted from all workers’ subsequent paychecks until after the 2006 California gubernatorial election. On November 1, 2005 plaintiff state employees filed a class action lawsuit in Sacramento Federal District Court alleging SEIU's emergency fee compelled plaintiffs speech in violation of the First Amendment. SEIU's Political Fight Back Fund along with an alliance of other public sector unions expended $24 million campaigning against Schwarzenegger's fiscal reform, with the California Teachers Association expending an additional $56 million and going so far as to mortgage its Sacramento headquarters to fund more campaign spending. Schwarzenegger likewise spent nearly $8 million of his own fortune campaigning. The tenor was highly divisive, with Schwarzenegger calling his opponents “stooges” and at one point Warren Beatty leading a bus full of public employees to follow the governor and shout down his events. Proposition 75 and all Governor Schwarzenegger's other fiscal reform agenda initiatives were defeated by wide margins. It had been the most expensive election in California history. As the results came out in Sacramento the president of the California Professional Firefighters union waived a broom over his head while state employees chanted “sweep, sweep, sweep”. In March 2008 District Court Judge Morrison England granted plaintiffs’ summary judgment against SEIU, finding it “hard to imagine” a clearer example of political purposes than when actually spending funds on an election campaign. On appeal the Ninth Circuit panel reversed and remanded with an order to grant summary judgment against plaintiffs, with former Chief Judge J. Clifford Wallace authoring a lengthy dissent. Plaintiffs petitioned the United States Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari and the petition was granted.Ross Runkel, When union fees go up, must a “Hudson notice” go out?, SCOTUSblog (Jan. 5, 2012, 10:01 AM) Plaintiffs then filed their opening brief. Instead of filing a reply brief, SEIU mailed a ten-page booklet to the 28,000 plaintiffs offering terms and conditions for a full refund, even including a $1 bill. SEIU then moved to dismiss the case as moot. Opinion of the Court Writing for the Court in a unanimous ruling, Justice Alito first finds the case is not moot. Alito disregards SEIU's refund offer, finding such maneuvering “must be viewed with a critical eye”.Knox, 132 S. Ct. at 2287. Furthermore, SEIU's refund offer contained so many “unnecessarily complicated” conditions and caveats that Alito feels it might still be improper. As such, Alito feels he must proceed to the constitutional question. Alito begins by correlating First Amendment protection of compelled funding with compelled speech and compelled association. He reads precedent as allowing compulsory fees funding private speech only when a compelling state interest requires the comprehensive regulation of a mandatory association and the fees are necessary for the regulatory purpose.132 S. Ct. at 2289. Questioning the necessity of compulsory union fees Alito writes “acceptance of the free-rider argument as a justification for compelling nonmembers to pay a portion of union dues represents something of an anomaly—one that we have found to be justified by the interest in furthering “labor peace.”132 S. Ct. at 2290 citing Clyde Summers, Book Review, Sheldon Leader, Freedom of Association: A Study in Labor Law and Political Theory, 16 Comparative Labor L.J. 262, 268 (1995). He finds this anomaly is “a remarkable boon for unions” and that it only came about as a “historical accident”. Alito is unwilling to extend the anomaly of compelling ordinary union dues to further compelling extraordinary union fees. The SEIU Political Fight Back fee had, then, extracted a forced loan out of the nonmembers, coercing them to fund a political campaign they disagreed with and only offering to return the funds after the campaign had been won.132 S. Ct. at 2293. This particularly troubles Alito with regard to Proposition 75 because “the effect of the SEIU’s procedure was to force many nonmembers to subsidize a political effort designed to restrict their own rights”.132 S. Ct. at 2292. Finally, SEIU had argued that its Political Fight Back fee was not political because for a public employees union “lobbying the electorate” is part of contract negotiations.132 S. Ct. at 2294. Alito is not persuaded, finding this definition of contract negotiations “would effectively eviscerate the limitation of use of compulsory fees to support unions’ controversial political activities.”132 S. Ct. at 2295. The Court therefore holds unions cannot impose extraordinary fees on nonmembers without first receiving nonmembers’ affirmative consent. Concurrence in Judgment Justice Sotomayor, joined by Justice Ginsburg, concur in the judgment only. Sotomayor agrees that the SEIU Political Fight Back fee was for political activities and that nonmembers could not be forced to pay for political activities without being provided an opportunity to opt out.132 S. Ct. at 2297. Sotomayor cannot agree, however, that the First Amendment allows such fees only after nonmembers opt in. Because neither the question presented, briefed, or argued disputed the constitutionality of requiring nonmembers to opt out of fees, Sotommayor does not feel the Court has the power to make affirmatively opting into fees a constitutional requirement. Because what is chargeable and nonchargeable to nonmembers is uncertain, Sotomayor feels the “majority’s answer to its unasked constitutional question is not even clear.”132 S. Ct. at 2299. Dissent Justice Breyer, joined by Justice Kagan, dissent. Breyer agrees with SEIU that “lobbying the electorate” is a contract negotiation. As support, the San Francisco native cites a California statute permitting unions to engage in political lobbying.132 S. Ct. at 2304 (Breyer, J., dissenting, citing Cal. Govt.Code Ann. Sec. 3515.8 (West 2010)). Agreeing with Sotomayor that the majority answered an unasked constitutional question, Breyer believes the majority's opt in requirement is “directly contrary to precedent.” Finally, Breyer laments that the majority's opinion is “virtually guaranteed” to “play a central role in the ongoing, intense political debate” regarding Right to Work laws.132 S. Ct. at 2306 (Breyer, J., dissenting). Reactions The editors of the New York Times disliked the outcome, decrying that \\"the legal approach is indistinguishable from politics.\\" Erwin Chemerinsky called Knox the term's \\"biggest sleeper case\\". Chermerinsky would latter write that Knox should be read to increase union political power.. Michael Dorf disliked Justice Alito's \\"broadly anti-union rhetoric\\". Students on the Harvard Law Review called the case \\"undoubtedly represents a watershed moment in the field of union campaign finance\\" and welcomed \\"a restraint on government power to rig the marketplace of ideas\\".Leading Cases, 126 186 (2012). The court would soon extend First Amendment protections against unions in Harris v. Quinn (2014).

Little information exists about his life and identity. He is best known for his influential commentary on The Emerald Tablet entitled Liber super textum Hermetis. It was composed before 1325, and the original work has two sections. The first is entitled Spiritus quinte essentie et in quo elemento habitat. It is dedicated to making a prodigious substance, the quintessence, from a mysterious material called argento vivo, which happens to be wine. Ortholan is the first author to relate alcohol and quintessence, half a century before Jean de Roquetaillade.JOSÉ RODRÍGUEZ-GUERRERO, Desarrollo y Madurez del Concepto de Quintaesencia Alquímica en la Europa Medieval (s. XII-XIV). pp. 30-56. http://www.revistaazogue.com/azogue5.htm According to his view, the quintessence would have a universal presence, but is best obtained of some substances; ideally the wine. The second part is a theoretical text. It is written as a comment to the Emerald Tablet attributed to Hermes. Its theme revolves around the primordial heat, praised by Hermes as a universal substrate that gives dynamism to the whole cosmos. Ortolanus believes alcohol or quintessence is the hidden primordial heat in all material things. This second part was published in the alchemical compilation In hoc volumine de alchemia continentur hæc (1541). It was printed again in 1545. A 1560 edition appeared under the name Compendium alchimiae and was attributed to Johannes de Garlandia (philologist). Another edition followed in 1571.Bibliotheca Chemica, Part 1 By John Ferguson p.420 With this widespread publishing, the second section became very popular among alchemists of the Early modern period. The first part, which was never published, was forgotten and no one related Ortolanus to the development of the concept of quintaessencia. Identity The true identity of Ortolanus is unknown. His works have been falsely attributed to Johannes de Garlandia (philologist) (fl. 1205-1255), and more probably to Jakob Ortlein of Nördlingen (fl. 1275-1325), who may have been a Dominican friar.JOSÉ RODRÍGUEZ-GUERRERO, Desarrollo y Madurez del Concepto de Quintaesencia Alquímica en la Europa Medieval (s. XII-XIV). p. 40. http://www.revistaazogue.com/Azogue5-3.pdf He has also been given the names Martin Ortolan or Lortholain in later sources.

The Pico House now stands on its lot. History Engraving of Californio politician José Antonio Carrillo who made Los Angeles the capital of Alta California. One June 21, 1821, Jose Antonio Carrillo petitioned the Comisionado for a house lot near the \\"new Temple which is being built for the benefit of our holy religion.\\" The lot, 40x60 varas (114x170 feet) was granted the next day. This is the only record of a grant of a house lot made between 1786 and 1836—just one real estate transfer in fifty years. When Lieutenant Edward Ord made his plan of the City of Los Angeles in 1849, he took as the initial point of his survey the northwest corner of Carrillo's house that stood on this lot; and his bearings from a point opposite that corner gave direction to the lines of the city's streets, and virtually to the plan of the city. The building was begun in 1822 and completed in 1825. It was the most pretentious and aristocratic residence in the Pueblo de Los Ángeles at that time. A lot of entertaining occurred at the Carrillo house, as well as political discussions as its owner was a politician and an entertainer. The spacious ball room was known for its dances; Pio Pico, Carrillo's brother-in-law, married Maria Ignacia Alvarado in the Carrillo House in 1834 with the merriment continuing for eight days. For four decades, Carrillo and his family resided at the abode, but it was abandoned in 1862 following Carrillo's death. It was then purchased by Pico who razed the building in September 1869, and built Pico House, a brick and stucco hotel, which opened on June 19, 1871. Architecture The adobe residence fronted on the plaza. It featured wings extending back on Main Street, and from its eastern end, to an adobe wall in the rear, thus enclosing a patio or inner court. Although but a one-story building, its height gave it the appearance of a two-story house. Its high gabled roof of red tiles and its white walls were in contrast to the prevailing clay-colored fronts and the flat asphalt roofs of the neighboring houses.

Kersten (born October 25, 1953) is a computer scientist with research focus on database architectures, query optimization and their use in scientific databases. He is an architect of the MonetDB system, an open-source column store for data warehouses, online analytical processing (OLAP) and geographic information systems (GIS). He has been (co-) founder of several successful spin-offs of the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI). Biography He started his career in computer science as research assistant in 1975. As of 1979 he was scientific researcher and lecturer at the Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam. Until 1985 he worked on database security, database programming languages and he developed a relational DBMS, which became a component of a commercial CASE environment from 1985-1991. He was visiting researcher at the University of California, San Francisco (1980 and 1983), visiting researcher Stanford University (2001,2002), and Microsoft Research (2005). In 1985 he moved to Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI), the national research institute for mathematics and computer science in the Netherlands, to establish the Database Research Group. Between 1986 and 1990 he was co- designer of the PRISMA database machine, a RDBMS for a 100-node multiprocessor. In a follow up ESPRIT-II project Kersten was responsible for the development of an enhanced version of SQL for documents and geographical data. From 1989-1993 he led a national project on the exploitation of the Amoeba distributed system for advanced database management and a national project for database design formalizations. Data mining projects in the 1990s required better analytical database support. This resulted in a CWI the spin- off called Data Distilleries, which used early MonetDB implementations in its analytical suite. Data Distilleries eventually became a subsidiary of SPSS in 2003, which in turn was acquired by IBM in 2009. In April 1992 he became the head of the department of Information Systems. At the same time he started the ESPRIT-III Pythagoras project aimed at performance quality assessment of advanced database systems. He remained associate professor at the Vrije Universiteit, teaching advanced courses on database technology until mid-1994. In 1992 he became an associated professor at the University of Amsterdam and a full professor in multimedia databases in January 1994. Between 1997 and 2010, Kersten served as head of the Database Architectures research group at the CWI Amsterdam. Since 2011 Kersten is a research fellow at the CWI. Kersten is an active reviewer for European Strategic Program on Research in Information Technology (ESPRIT) projects and scientific publications. Moreover, he is a trustee of the VLDB Endowment board, which aims to promote and exchange scholarly work in databases and related fields worldwide. Since 2007 Kersten is also editorial board member of \\"PVLDB\\" and he served on the editorial board of ACM Transactions on Database Systems journal in 2010. In 2017 he became a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery.. Publications Martin Kersten has more than 150 publications to date. In 2009, a team of researchers from the CWI Database Architercutes group, composed of Milena Ivanova, Martin Kersten, Niels Nes and Romulo Goncalves, won the \\"Best Paper Runner Up\\" at annual ACM SIGMOD conference for their work for on \\"An Architecture for Recycling Intermediates in a Column-store\\".

MonetDB MonetDB is a high-performance column-store relational database management system with automatic index management, flexible optimizer infrastructure, and programmable backend functionality. MonetDB (initially only called Monet) was first created by 2002 doctoral student Peter Boncz and professor Martin Kersten as part of the 1990s MAGNUM research project at University of Amsterdam. The first version under an open-source software license (a modified version of the Mozilla Public License) was released on September 30, 2004.MonetDB historic background MonetDB introduced innovations at all database management system layers: a storage model based on vertical fragmentation, a modern CPU-tuned query execution architecture that often gave MonetDB a speed advantage on the same algorithm over a typical interpreter- based RDBMS. MonetDB is one of the first database systems to focus its query optimization effort on exploiting CPU caches. MonetDB also features automatic and self-tuning indexes, run-time query optimization, and a modular software architecture.P. A. Boncz, T. Grust, M. van Keulen, S. Manegold, J. Rittinger, J. Teubner.

It linked 25 state-based coalitions of businesses. The organization also had a sister foundation, ImmigrationWorks Foundation, that was a registered 501(c)(3) charitable organization. People Tamar Jacoby, Senior Fellow at the Manhattan Institute and long-time advocate of free movement of labor, was the driving force behind ImmigrationWorks USA. Principles Jacoby claimed to advance the following principles through ImmigrationWorks: * A legal system that works: Bringing the United States' annual legal intake of foreigners in line with the country's labor needs. * Smarter, better enforcement that would be made easier by the reduced incentives to migrate illegally once labor movement has been liberalized. * Worksite verification that does not penalize employers for errors in government databases. * A remedy for past mistakes: Finding a middle ground for dealing with the current unauthorized population that involves neither deportation nor amnesty. * Protecting U.S. workers by holding legal foreign workers to the same labor standards as domestic workers are held. * Washington and the states: Immigration policy is a federal responsibility, and must ultimately be resolved at the federal level. Charity evaluator GiveWell, in its review, stated: \\"In practice, IW focuses primarily on the first of these bullet points, and its advocacy efforts tend to be oriented towards Republicans.\\" Activities ImmigrationWorks worked to facilitate more grassroots lobbying by local businesses, as well as public opinion research and lobbying legislators. On request from charity evaluator GiveWell, ImmigrationWorks prepared a list of things they would do with additional money (that they then received from Good Ventures): # Advocacy for immigration reform # Public opinion research # Building consensus around policy External reviews Charity evaluator and effective altruism organization GiveWell reviewed ImmigrationWorks in 2015 as a potential funding opportunity. History According to a New York Times article, Tamar Jacoby, a Senior Fellow at the Manhattan Institute, was motivated to create ImmigrationWorks USA after seeing the political difficulties that ensnared the attempted passage of immigration reform in 2006. ImmigrationWorks USA started operations in 2008 so as to help employers make their case for the need for freer movement of workers more effectively to politicians as well as the general public. Their work, including a successful lobbying effort in Arizona, was reported in The New York Times in 2008. According to ProPublica, ImmigrationWorks USA submitted Internal Revenue Service documentation from 2008 to 2016 as a tax exempt non- profit organization. ProPublica does not list analogous \\"form 990\\" information from 2017 or 2018. Funding ImmigrationWorks received funding from a number of foundations, including the Carnegie Corporation, Ford Foundation, Four Freedoms Fund, and Open Society Institute.
