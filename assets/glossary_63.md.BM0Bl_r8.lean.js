It tells the story of an undercover police officer's experiences in a Hasidic community. It was entered into the 1992 Cannes Film Festival. It is often cited as one of Lumet's two failures of the 1990s, the other being Guilty as Sin (1993). Despite the poor reviews suffered by both these films, Lumet received the 1993 D. W. Griffith Award of the Directors Guild of America. The film was also the first credited role for actor James Gandolfini. The shooting of this movie was used as an example in Lumet‚Äôs book Making Movies.  Plot  Hardened New York City homicide detective Emily Eden (Melanie Griffith), daughter of a divorced former cop, and her partner Nick (Jamey Sheridan) attempt to arrest two drug dealers. However, Nick is stabbed by one of the dealers, whom Emily wounds instead of alerting assistance at first. As a result, her superior Lt. Oliver (David Margulies) temporarily takes away her gun. After Nick is hospitalized, eventually heading to recovery, while the dealers have been apprehended, Emily goes undercover to investigate the murder of a Hasidic diamond-cutter named Yaakov Klausman (Jake Weber). She questions the family of the Hasidic rebbe (Lee Richardson), an elderly Holocaust survivor who is revered for his wisdom and compassion toward his fellow Jews. He says to her, \\"You and I have something in common: We are both intimately familiar with evil. It does something to your soul.\\" While living with the rebbe's family, Emily changes her appearance and takes a liking to his son, Ariel (Eric Thal), a young man who works as a diamond-cutter but teaches in the yeshiva and is expected to follow his father as the next rebbe. In addition to keeping all 613 Mitzvot, he is waiting for his intended, or basherte, the daughter of a Paris rebbe whom he has not yet actually met. They are the subjects of an arranged marriage, but he believes that she is his soul mate, chosen by God. He is also studying the Kabbalah, which is regarded as rather daring for a man under 40. Its discussion of sexual intimacy is restrained but specific, as well as a metaphor for the relationship between Man and God. Emily finds out that the \\"inside man\\" in the murder plot is the rebbe's adopted daughter Mara (Tracy Pollan), who had been living a disorderly life until Yaakov introduced her to the rebbe. Afterwards, she joined the community as a repentant baalat tshuva, \\"one who has returned,\\" until a person from her past approached her and she let him into the Diamond Center to steal diamonds worth about $750,000 and kill Yaakov. Shortly after, Emily saves the rebbe's daughter Leah (Mia Sara) from being scammed by the Baldessari brothers Anthony (James Gandolfini) and Christopher (Chris Latta), who claim to be Yaakov's killers. Emily instructs her second partner Levine (John Pankow) to alert assistance and arrests the Baldessaris, but the Baldessaris manage to escape. In the ensuing chase, Levine is injured, while Emily fatally shoots the Baldessaris. Before succumbing to his wounds, Anthony admits to Emily that he and Christopher were not responsible for Yaakov's death. Having solved the case such as Mara now an accessory to murder, Emily rejects Nick's proposal, secretly romances Ariel to overcome her personal problems, and returns to the rebbe's home with him, but finds that Mara has taken Leah hostage. After Emily attempts to negotiate, Mara knocks her out, and Ariel kills Mara with Emily's revolver, avenging Yaakov. Ariel comments that sometimes an evil deed has a partially good result. Emily is hospitalized for an examination, while the rebbe and his family bid her farewell. Ariel and his basherte Shayna Singer (Rena Sofer) get married, in which a reformed Emily watches from a distance. Eventually, she returns to work and catches up with an also reformed Levine, who is on leave and invites her on a two-week trip to Aruba. However, she declines and awaits her bashert.

It currently holds a 22% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 41 reviews.http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/stranger_among_us/ Some of the criticism of A Stranger Among Us is based on comparisons with the Academy Award-winning film Witness, which has a superficially similar plot. Similarly, Lumet's earlier film Fail-Safe was unfavorably compared to Dr. Strangelove, but in that case both films have subsequently achieved cult status. Griffith's performance in the lead role has also been heavily criticized, for which her role won her the Razzie Award for Worst Actress (also for the year's Worst Picture, Shining Through), while Tracy Pollan was nominated for Worst Supporting Actress.  Setting  Some aspects of the plot recall the 1977 murder of diamond dealer Pinchos Jaroslawicz. The filming of the shootout took place at the Eldridge Street Synagogue on the Lower East Side of Manhattan.

Plot introduction Narrated by a young novelist, Vanya (Ivan Petrovich), who has just released his first novel which bears an obvious resemblance to Dostoevsky's own first novel, Poor Folk, it consists of two gradually converging plot lines. One deals with Vanya's close friend and former love object, Natasha, who has left her family to live with her new lover, Alyosha. Alyosha is the saintly but dimwitted son of Prince Valkovsky, who hopes to gain financially by marrying Alyosha off to an heiress, Katya. Valkovsky's cruel machinations to break up Alyosha and Natasha make him one of the most memorable \\"predatory types\\" (like Stavrogin in The Possessed) that Dostoevsky created. The other plotline focuses on a thirteen-year-old orphan, Nellie, whom Vanya saves from an abusive household by taking her into his apartment, and whose deceased mother's story in some ways parallels that of Natasha. It's unusual to see a well-developed character as young as Nellie in a Dostoevsky novel, but Nellie may be one of his most moving creations, and she in particular shows the influence of Dickens (Dostoevsky is known to have read Dickens during the Siberian exile; this novel was conceived near the end of this exile. In turn Japanese director Akira Kurosawa adapted Nellie's story in his 1965 film, Red Beard). One of the most important themes throughout Dostoevsky's work is the expiative value of suffering, and The Insulted and Injured, with its tragically moving plot and characters, develops that theme. Plot summary Natasha leaves her parents' home and runs away with Alyosha (prince Alexey) ‚Äì the son of Prince Valkovsky. As a result of his pain, her father, Nikolai, curses her. The only friend that remains by Natasha's side is Ivan ‚Äì her childhood friend who is deeply in love with her, and whom Natasha has rejected despite their being engaged. Prince Valkovsky tries to destroy Alyosha's plans to marry Natasha, and wants to make him marry the rich princess Katerina. Alyosha is a na√Øve but loveable young man who is easily manipulated by his father. Following his father's plan, Alyosha falls in love with Katerina, but still loves Natasha. He is constantly torn between these two women, too indecisive and infatuated with both to make a decision. Eventually, Natasha sacrifices her own feelings and withdraws in order for Alyosha to choose Katerina. Meanwhile, Ivan rescues an orphan girl, Elena (known as Nellie), from the clutches of a procuress and learns that her mother ran away from her father's (Jeremy Smith's) home with her sweetheart, a man who abandoned her when Nellie's mother gave birth. It is later revealed that Prince Valkovsky is Nellie's father. Her parents were legally married, but Prince Valkovsky persuaded his young and innocent wife to rob her father, Jeremy. After moving to Petersburg, Nellie's mother asks forgiveness to her father, but he rejects them. Before dying, Nellie's mother makes Nellie promise to never go to her real father, whose name is on a document she leaves her daughter. In attempt to make Nikolai (Natasha's father) reconcile with Natasha, Ivan persuades Nikolai and his wife to adopt Nellie. By telling them her life story, Nellie makes Nikolai's heart soften and he forgives Natasha and removes his curse, and they are reunited. Natasha's family plans to move from Petersburg, but just before they leave Nellie dies from a chronic heart condition; the little girl makes it clear to Ivan she does not forgive her father for his cruel treatment of her mother. She also tells him he should marry Natasha. The story ends on an ambiguous note with Natasha and Ivan reflecting on the events that have unfolded.

It rises in the Harz mountains and drains them in a northerly direction. After it discharges into the Saale at Nienburg. The river is named after a legendary giant, the wild, rampaging, Bohemian, Prince Bodo, who, according to the Rosstrappe legend changed into a marauding dog that guarded the crown of Princess Brunhilde in the Kronensumpf (\\"crown marsh\\") in the present-day Bode Gorge (). The gorge is the narrow section of the Bode valley between Treseburg and Thale.  The Bodo legend  Hexentanzplatz plateau near Thale According to tradition, there was once a giant called Bodo who came from Thuringia to pursue Brunhilde, the king's beautiful daughter, whom he wanted to marry against her will. Brunhilde fled on a white stallion (Ross), but they suddenly came to a deep ravine. With one bold leap she reached the rocks on the far side, but her pursuer fell into the abyss. The hoofprint of her horse can still be seen today as the so-called Rosstrappe. Meanwhile, Bodo was turned into a dog. As her horse leapt the gorge, however, the princess lost her golden crown, which was now guarded by the dog Bodo in the valley of the river. The river was given the name Bode after the giant Bodo who was now under a spell.  Geography =Source and catchment areas The Bode is heavily divided in its source region on the Brocken, the highest peak in the Harz, but its two most important source streams are the: * Kalte Bode, , which rises at Bodesprung in * Warme Bode, long, with its headstream, the Bodebruch The two rivers, which actually have a temperature difference of 2 ¬∞C, merge not far from the K√∂nigsburg Ruins immediately before flowing into the K√∂nigsh√ºtte Dam (a feeder dam or √úberleitungssperre). Other tributaries of the Bode include the Rappbode and the Luppbode. The Rappbode is impounded near Wendefurth by the Rappbode Dam. At the northern end of this reservoir, the Rappbode joins the Bode, which is impounded here by the Wendefurth Dam. Other tributaries of the Bode are the Goldbach, the Holtemme and the Selke.  Waterfalls  The waterfalls in the Harz are not high. The Upper Bode Falls (Obere Bode-Fall) on the Warme Bode are really a fast-flowing stream (Sturzbach) with small steps about 1 metre in height. Likewise the Lower Bode Falls (Untere Bode-Fall) on the Warme Bode is simply ledge of similar height. The Bodekessel in the Bode Gorge is a former step in a large hollow, that was reduced in height in 1798 from 2 metres to 1 metre by explosive. The fourth waterfall is in the K√§stental.  Course  The Bode winds its way between Treseburg and Thale through a long, narrow valley, the Bode Gorge. Today, the valley is a nature reserve. The Bode Gorge and its villages are the primary setting for Theodor Fontane‚Äôs novel, C√©cile. The river then crosses the Harz Foreland in a curving and, in places, diked and canalised, course until it discharges into the Saale at Nienburg. Important Bode tributaries are the Selke and the Holtemme. Other towns on the Bode river are Quedlinburg, Wegeleben, Gr√∂ningen, Oschersleben, Hadmersleben, Egeln and Sta√üfurt. The Bode gorge north of Thale is now a protected area.

The catchment areas of the various reservoirs are as follows: for the Wendefurth Reservoir, , for the Rappbode Pre-Dam and Rappbode Reservoirs, , and for the K√∂nigsh√ºtte Reservoir, . The Mandelholz Dam impounds the water of the Kalte Bode. The total catchment area of the Bode is about .  History and culture = Middle Ages  In the Early Middle Ages the Bode formed the border between the provinces of the Harzgau in the west and the Schwabengau in the east. The two most important Bode crossings at that time were the settlements of Ditfurt und Gr√∂ningen, mentioned frequently in the Fuldau annals.  Modern era  Heinrich Heine depicts the romantic Bode valley in his 1826 travelogue Die Harzreise:  Flood and low water  Board by the Jungfern Bridge built in 1927 after its predecessor was destroyed on 30 December 1925 The 'most devastating' floods from the Bode occurred in the years 1539, 1667, 1730, 1740, 1772 and especially at Christmas in 1925.Vgl.

By mid-1962, BMEWS \\"quick fixes\\" for ECCM had been installed at Thule and Clear and by June 30, 1962, Ent AFB integration of BMEWS and SPADATS data was completed. On July 31, 1962, NORAD recommended a tracking radar at Clear to close the BMEWS gap with Thule for low-angle missiles vice those with the 15-65 degree angle for which BMEWS was designed1962 NORAD/CONAD Historical Summary, July-December (North Dakota's Cavalier AFS radar built in 1975 currently monitors for Hudson Bay launches.)

(Clear was unable to perform its mission for 6 minutes due to the record 1964 earthquake.) In 1966, the last of the 5 BMEWS tracking radars was installed an RCA AN/FPS-92 Radar Set with an diameter antenna housed in a diameter radome.

Cochinita pibil (also puerco pibil or cochinita con achiote) is a traditional Mexican slow-roasted pork dish from the Yucat√°n Peninsula. Preparation of traditional cochinita involves marinating the meat in strongly acidic citrus juice, adding annatto seed which imparts a vivid burnt orange color, and roasting the meat while it is wrapped in banana leaf. Methods Cochinita Cochinita means baby pig, so true cochinita pibil involves roasting a whole suckling pig. Alternatively, pork shoulder (butt roast), or pork loin is used in many recipes. The high acid content of the marinade and the slow cooking time tenderizes the meat, allowing otherwise tough pieces of meat to be used. The Yucatecan recipes always employ the juice of Seville or bitter oranges for marinating. In areas where bitter oranges are not common, juice of sweet oranges combined with lemons, limes, or vinegar are employed to approximate the effect of the bitter orange on the meat. Another important ingredient in all pibil recipes is achiote (annatto), which gives the dish its characteristic color and adds to flavor. It is usually eaten with side dishes such as: yellow corn tortillas, red pickled onion, refried black beans and habanero chilies. Traditionally, cochinita pibil is buried in a pit with a fire at the bottom to roast it. In popular culture Cochinita pibil is a recurring element of the movie Once Upon a Time in Mexico directed by Robert Rodriguez, where it is the favorite food of a CIA agent played by Johnny Depp, who orders this dish every time he enters a Mexican restaurant and urges every person he has lunch with to taste it. He will go as far as killing a cook because his puerco pibil is \\"too good\\". Rodriguez also includes a recipe for puerco pibil and demonstrates how to prepare it in the special features section of the DVD.

History Windesheim as it currently exists was formed in 1986 as the result of the merger of several education providers. The merger took place over a number of years with more and more institutions joining. The academy for Journalism and the academy for Social Studies from Kampen became part of the new institute as well as the School of Physical Exercise from Arnhem. Most of the education providers who joined were located in Zwolle: Higher Education in Economics and Administration (HEAO), Higher Education in Engineering and Technology (HTS), College of Education, School of Nursing, Academy of Journalism and Higher Education in Information Technology. These separate institutions all became part of Windesheim which then joined forces on an administrative level with the VU University Amsterdam. In 2012 this set up was discontinued and both institutions now have their own board and organization behind them. In September 2006, it changed its degree system to the bachelor/master system.

These locomotives were intended for suburban passenger service, but did not prove satisfactory, so they ended up on freight service.Marsden, Richard. The Ivatt R1 0-8-2 Tank Locomotives .

Number 14 is operational, it was built in 1909 in Bristol. The design combination of this 0-8-2 tank Locomotive and the N.S.W.

North America The 0-8-2 was not a common wheel arrangement. In North America, its use was confined to 2-8-2 \\"Mikado\\" types assigned to switcher roles; the lead truck was often removed to give more weight on drivers, a guiding truck not being needed at slow speed. However, the Illinois Central rebuilt some of their 2-8-2s into 0-8-2s for use in Markham Yard in Chicago, Illinois. Narrow-gauge railways Italian narrow- gauge 0-8-2T The arrangement has proved a little more popular on narrow-gauge and minimum-gauge lines, where the lack of leading wheels was less important due to the relatively slow operating speeds. 0-8-2 locomotives operate, for example, on the Zillertalbahn in Austria.

Turner left both strips in 1943 to begin Buz Sawyer, but a series of assistants kept the combined Captain Easy daily and Sunday strips going until October 1, 1988. History Initially titled Washington Tubbs II, it originally was a gag-a-day daily strip which focused on the mundane misadventures of the title character, a bespectacled bumbler who ran a store. However, Crane soon switched from gag-a-day to continuity storylines. He reinvented the strip after its 12th week to make it the first true action/adventure comic strip, initially by having Tubbs leave the store and join a circus. To research this, Crane spent many days with a circus, even incorporating characters in the strip based directly on the circus performers he knew personally.Blackbeard, Bill. Wash Tubbs and Captain Easy, NBM Publishing, 1987‚Äì92. Wash was a girl-crazy zany, and his character never truly changed even as the strip changed around him. After a Polynesian treasure hunt in which Wash made and lost a fortune, adventures followed in which he fell afoul of his arch-enemy, Bull Dawson, who reappeared throughout the series. Since the short Wash was not a fighter, Crane tried out several scrappier sidekicks until May 6, 1929, when he introduced Captain Easy, a tough, taciturn Southerner with a mysterious past. Easy gradually took over the strip and became its lead character, getting his own Sunday page, Captain Easy, Soldier of Fortune, starting July 30, 1933. Wash continued to appear as a supporting character, but he became steadily less important during the 1940s. The Tubbs and Easy characters were owned by the Newspaper Enterprise Association syndicate. Crane left that syndicate and abandoned the strips in 1943 to begin Buz Sawyer, a strip he would own outright. Crane's last daily Wash Tubbs strip ran on May 29, 1943. After Crane‚Äôs departure, control of the strip then passed to Crane‚Äôs assistant, Leslie Turner, who had ghosted on the daily strip since 1937. Turner's assistant Walt Scott drew the Sunday page. Easy was in the Army by that time, and Tubbs had an increasingly unimportant role, so both daily and Sunday strips displayed the name Captain Easy in 1949 (with Wash Tubbs fading away). Scott drew the Sunday strip until 1952, when Turner took it over with inks by assistant Bill Crooks. began ghosting the Sunday page in 1960. Turner continued to draw the daily strip until he retired in 1969, with his last credited daily strip running January 17, 1970. Following Turner's departure, the strips passed to his assistants, Bill Crooks (art) and Jim Lawrence (story). The pair produced both the daily and Sunday strips from January 19, 1970 to May 23, 1981. When Lawrence left in May 1981, the Sunday page ended. Mick Casale joined as the new writer, and he and Crooks produced the daily strip until it was discontinued on October 1, 1988. Wash remained a supporting character in Leslie Turner's Captain Easy (February 29, 1964) Wash Tubbs toppers Starting February 27, 1927, a Wash Tubbs-themed topper, or subsidiary strip, appeared over the Sunday page of J. R. Williams' Out Our Way with the Willets Sunday strip. Originally an extension of the gag- a-day comic strip, the topper shifted focus to become A Wash Tubbs Game from September 4, 1932 to January 29, 1933. After this, the comic strip returned for a few weeks, and then became Wash Tubbs Comical Jigsaw Puzzle from March 19 to May 7, 1933. The topper was then turned into a children's craft-ideas panel called Goofy-Ginks, and ran until September 24, 1933. Books Wash Tubbs and Captain Easy were featured in Big Little Books during the 1930s. They also appeared in Dell comic books from 1936 (Captain Easy, as early as The Funnies #1, October 1936 cover date)The Funnies #1, October 1936, Grand Comics Database and 1937 (Wash Tubbs, as early as The Comics #1, March 1937 cover date)The Comics #1, March 1937, Grand Comics Database into the 1940s. The entire 1924‚Äì43 run of Crane‚Äôs strip was reprinted in Wash Tubbs and Captain Easy, an 18-volume series with biographical and historical commentary by Bill Blackbeard and design by Bhob Stewart.

The principals were Francis L.S. Mayers, Oscar Harold Murray, and Hardie Phillip. For the first few years after Goodhue's death, the firm was focused on executing Goodhue's unfinished projects and designs, which included eleven buildings on the Caltech campus alone. Buildings credited to the firm reflect Goodhue's characteristic massing and incorporation of ornament by longtime collaborators. Of the three architects, Hardie Phillip is solely credited with completing the Honolulu Museum of Art. For the 1929 Church of the Heavenly Rest at 90th Street and Fifth Avenue in New York City, the firm completed a steel-frame, simplified Neo-Gothic limestone structure on land sold by the Carnegie family. The church features integrated architectural sculpture by Lee Lawrie in the form of Moses and John the Baptist emerging from the stonework, although most of the sculptural program was never executed.Gray, Christopher.

The design of the 1931 Oriental Institute on the grounds of the University of Chicago partly reflects the Egyptian Revival craze of the 1920s on a particularly appropriate building. A bas-relief above the door by sculptor Ulric Ellerhusen and designed by Institute director James Henry Breasted, depicts various symbolic icons and hieroglyphics, figures including Herodotus and Julius Caesar, and includes an image of Goodhue's Nebraska State Capitol. Goodhue's own Rockefeller Chapel is nearby. For the 1939 World's Fair, Mayers, Murray & Phillip designed the Medicine and Public Health Building with interior murals by Hildreth Meiere, and three large allegorical sculptures to represent American virtues: Humility (the Devil and Texan folklore figure Strap Buckner), Efficiency (Paul Bunyan), and Benevolence (Johnny Appleseed).

The strip ran for more than five decades until it was discontinued on October 1, 1988. Characters and story Originally, Captain Easy was a supporting character in the daily comic strip Wash Tubbs, which focused on the adventures of the zany Washington Tubbs II. On February 26, 1929, Crane introduced taciturn toughguy Captain Easy, who soon took over the strip. On July 30, 1933, Crane launched Captain Easy, Soldier of Fortune as a Sunday page starring Easy. Captain Easy was a chivalrous Southern adventurer in the classic adventure-hero mold. After a series of globe-trotting adventures, Easy enlisted in the U.S. Army during World War II, afterwards becoming a private detective. Sunday strips The Sunday adventures were initially unconnected to those of the Wash Tubbs strip and dealt with Easy's adventures prior to meeting Tubbs. They are considered a tour-de-force by Crane, who crafted layouts intended to be seen as a coherent whole rather than a disparate collection of panels. Comics historian R. C. Harvey described Crane's Sunday page innovation: :On Sundays, Crane concentrated on Easy, and these pages soon absorbed him. The art chores on the dailies were assigned to others in the NEA bullpen so that Crane could pour his imagination into the weekly installments of Easy's adventures. Crane loved the spacious potential of the Sunday page‚Äîas would any graphic artist; and he spent most of his energy here rather than on the less visually challenging dailies. And on the Sunday pages, Crane did some of his finest work. Since he was drawing for the addition of color, Crane shaded these pages very little, so his artwork here is refined to its unembellished essence. And in its essence, Crane's work demonstrates the marvelous precision and telling efficacy of a line so simple it seems naive. But appearances in art are as often deceiving as they are in life. The simplicity of Crane's linework is the ultimate sophistication of irreducible economy, the absolute in purity of graphic expression. :Crane's Sunday pictures are carefully, lovingly, drawn, every panel composed to tell the story while sustaining the illusion of time and place. And the pages themselves are artful designs, irregular albeit nonetheless pleasing patterns of panels rather than uniform grids. But these layouts are not simply designs: they were devised to give visual impact to the story. When Crane drew Easy at the brink of a cliff, he gave depth to the scene by depicting it in a vertical panel that is two- or three-tiers tall. When Easy leads a cavalry charge or paddles a canoe down a lazy river, the panel is as wide as the page, giving panoramic sweep to the scene depicted.Harvey, R.C. \\"A Flourish of Trumpets: Roy Crane and the Adventure Strip\\" Unfortunately, in 1937, the Newspaper Enterprise Association syndicate, which employed Crane and owned the strip, introduced a new policy requiring Sunday pages designed so the panels could be rearranged into different formats. Crane then turned the Sunday pages over to his assistant Leslie Turner so he could concentrate on the daily strip. The Tubbs and Easy characters were owned by NEA, and in 1943, Crane abandoned his strips and exited NEA to begin Buz Sawyer, a strip he owned outright. Crane's last daily Wash Tubbs strip ran on May 29, 1943. After Roy Crane After Crane‚Äôs departure, Turner took control of the strips, with his assistant Walt Scott drawing the Sunday page. Easy was in the Army by that time, and Tubbs had an increasingly unimportant role, so both daily and Sunday strips displayed the name Captain Easy in 1949 (with Wash Tubbs fading away). Scott drew the Sunday strip until 1952, when Turner took it over with inks by assistant Bill Crooks. began ghosting the Sunday page in 1960. Turner continued to draw the daily strip until he retired in 1969, with his last credited daily strip running January 17, 1970. Following Turner's departure, the strips passed to his assistants, Bill Crooks (art) and Jim Lawrence (story). The pair produced both the daily and Sunday strips from January 19, 1970 to May 23, 1981. When Lawrence left in May 1981, the Sunday page ended. Mick Casale joined as the new writer, and he and Crooks produced the daily strip until it was discontinued on October 1, 1988. Before the Sunday Captain Easy, there was a short-lived Wash Tubbs Sunday third, which began with gags featuring Tubbs and later puzzles for children. It ran from 10 May 1931 to 9 July 1933. Captain Easy appeared in one strip. Reprints Wash Tubbs and Captain Easy were featured in Big Little Books during the 1930s. They also appeared in Dell comic books from 1936 (Captain Easy, as early as The Funnies #1, October 1936 cover date)The Funnies #1, October 1936, at Grand Comics Database website. http://www.comics.org/issue/133/ and 1937 (Wash Tubbs, as early as The Comics #1, March 1937 cover date)Cover of The Comics #1, March 1937, at Grand Comics Database website. http://www.comics.org/issue/128497/cover/4/?style=default into the 1940s.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 18, 1993. In the episode, Bart, intoxicated from an all-syrup Squishee, mistakenly joins the Junior Campers, a Boy Scout-style organization. Homer and Bart join a father-son rafting trip which goes awry when they are stranded at sea. The episode was written by Dan McGrath and directed by Jeffrey Lynch. Ernest Borgnine guest starred in the episode as himself. He recorded his lines at the Village Recorder in West Los Angeles. The episode makes cultural references to the films My Dinner with Andre, The Terminator, On the Town, \\"Crocodile\\" Dundee, Deliverance, Friday the 13th, and Boyz n the Hood (in the title) as well as the song \\"Sugar, Sugar\\" by The Archies. Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. It acquired a Nielsen rating of 13.0, and was the highest-rated show on the Fox network the week it aired. Plot Bart and Milhouse find $20 that Homer lost and order a Super Squishee made entirely of syrup from Apu at the Kwik-E-Mart. With their senses reeling from the high sugar content, they spend the rest of the money on a bender in Springfield. The next morning, Bart wakes up with a hangover and realizes he joined the Junior Campers, an organization like the Boy Scouts, during his revelry. Bart plans to quit the group as soon as possible, but he attends a meeting to avoid a pop quiz at school. When he learns that Junior Campers are issued pocket knives, he keeps attending meetings. Homer mocks him relentlessly for embracing the scouts. When a father-son rafting trip is planned, neither Bart nor Homer wish to go together. They offer invitations to each other thinking they will both refuse them, but inadvertently end up agreeing to attend. Homer is distressed when he learns that he and Bart will share a raft with Ned and his son Rod. When Homer loses the map after folding it into a makeshift hat that blows away, they paddle the wrong way and find themselves lost at sea. Their plan to ration the little food onboard fails when Homer greedily eats most of it. They are stranded with no food or water for several days; the Springfield Police Department refuses to search for them because their rescue boat is out of refreshments. The raft springs a leak after Homer accidentally drops a pocket knife he was intending to gift to Bart. All seems lost, but Homer smells the scent of food from a Krusty Burger on an unmanned offshore oil rig and places a large order. Bart is proud of his father after the rafting party survives their ordeal. Led by Ernest Borgnine, the other Junior Campers take the right route but suffer a worse fate: they become trapped in a dark, tangled swamp while being hunted by mountain men. Borgnine is unable to repel a bear attack because Homer has stolen his Swiss Army knife, so they flee to an abandoned summer camp. They start singing campfire songs, but soon an unseen figure lurking in the woods -- strongly implied to be Jason Voorhees -- attacks them. Production Ernest Borgnine guest starred as himself in the episode. \\"Boy-Scoutz 'n the Hood\\" was written by Dan McGrath and directed by Jeffrey Lynch. The episode was recorded at the Village Recorder in West Los Angeles. Ernest Borgnine guest starred in the episode as himself. The staff liked his work on the films Marty and From Here to Eternity, so they asked him to do a guest appearance on the show. Borgnine felt he could not say no to the offer because his grandchildren were fans of the show. In the final scene of the episode, Borgnine plays a guitar and sings campfire songs with the children. Borgnine was a guitar player in real life, so he brought his own guitar with him to the recording studio. Borgnine apologized because he felt that he was not being able to sing very well, but Nancy Cartwright, who provides the voice of Bart, thought his voice \\"added to the authenticity of his character\\". The Simpsonss creator Matt Groening thought the recording sessions with Borgnine were \\"so much fun\\". Hank Azaria, who provides the voice of Apu, commented that Borgnine \\"had no idea what the hell he was doing. He's a good actor, and he read his lines just fine, but he had no idea what the show was, no idea what we were doing.\\" In her book My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy, Cartwright comments that she was a fan of Borgnine's performance in Marty. She writes that the film had \\"changed [her] forever\\", and that it made her \\"realize that actors have the power through their work to inspire and enlighten others.\\" She recalls that when Borgnine arrived for the recording session, she \\"lost all coolness\\" and ran up to him and exclaimed \\"ohmygod, Marty!\\" Cultural references When Bart and Milhouse visit the local video arcade at the beginning of the episode, Martin Prince is seen playing an arcade game based on the 1981 film My Dinner with Andre. Other games at the arcade include a game based on the 1984 film The Terminator.. The \\"Springfield, Springfield\\" number performed by Bart and Milhouse on their night out in town is a reference to the musical number \\"New York, New York\\" from the film On the Town, starring Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra. During a scene in which Hans Moleman and Moe fight with knives, Hans tells Moe, \\"You call that a knife? This is a knife!\\", a reference to a line from the 1986 film \\"Crocodile\\" Dundee. Ernest Borgnine introduces himself a la Troy McClure to the Junior Campers by recalling his role in From Here to Eternity, a film which modern children are unlikely to have seen. During a hallucination, Homer imagines himself singing the song \\"Sugar, Sugar\\" by The Archies while dancing with lollipops and ice cream cones. While on the raft, Homer misquotes lines from Samuel Taylor Coleridge's The Rime of the Ancient Mariner when he says \\"Water, water everywhere/So let's all have a drink.\\" The scene in which Borgnine and the other rafters drift through a dark forest watched by mountain men is a reference to a scene in the 1972 film Deliverance, and the scene features the music from the film's \\"Dueling Banjos\\" scene. The unseen person or creature that attacks Borgnine at the end of the episode is implied to be Jason Voorhees from the Friday the 13th film series. Reception In its original American broadcast, \\"Boy-Scoutz 'n the Hood\\" finished 35th in the ratings for the week of November 15 to November 21, 1993, with a Nielsen rating of 13.0, translating to 12.3 million households. The episode was the highest-rated show on the Fox network that week. Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote: \\"A terrific episode, with Homer so stupid it isn't true, yet still saving the day. Seeing Ned Flanders get it wrong is great, but the show-stealer is a toss-up between Borgnine's great self-deprecating role, the ironic seagull, and the dolphins.\\" DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson called it a \\"brilliant episode from start to finish\\". He commented that \\"We see what an amazing amount of goods and services one can purchase in Springfield with only $20, and we get a fun spoof of scouting. Add to that terrific rivalry moments between Bart and Homer and the show excels.\\" Patrick Bromley of DVD Verdict called the plot of the episode \\"typically inspired\\", and gave it a grade of A. Bill Gibron of DVD Talk gave the episode a score of 5 out of 5. TV DVD Reviews's Kay Daly wrote: \\"And just when you think the Simpsons' creators have taken parody as far as it can go, they air an episode like this. The writers cram the 22-minute episode with allusions to movie genres including disaster movies, Broadway musicals, adventure-suspense and classic teen horror.\\" Adam Suraf of Dunkirkma.net named it one of his ten favorite episodes of the show. He called the musical sequence a \\"classic\\". Rick Porter of Zap 2 It wrote in that he was not a \\"fan\\" of the episode's second half: \\"Despite the presence of Borgnine, Homer is a little too aggressively stupid for my taste\\". He thought the first part was \\"absolutely brilliant\\", though. Kurt M. Koenigsberger analyzed a scene from the episode in his piece \\"Commodity Culture and Its Discontents\\", published in the compilation work Leaving Springfield: The Simpsons and the Possibility of Oppositional Culture edited by John Alberti. He commented that The Simpsons literary and cultural awareness extends to the \\"conventions of its own medium\\" in this episode. Bart criticizes an Itchy & Scratchy episode because Itchy stakes down Scratchy's appendages and props his belly to form a tent with faulty knots. With Homer looking on from the couch, Lisa reminds Bart that cartoons do not simply reproduce reality, a point hammered on as a second Homer meanders past the living-room window. Koenigsberger said that \\"this moment and many others like it reveal a strong sense of self-awareness within the show, an awareness especially characteristic of high modernism.\\" In the United Kingdom, when the 300th episode was shown, Sky 1 held a Golden D'ohnuts evening, in which viewers voted for their favourite episodes to win in each category. This episode won the category of: Best School Jinx.

It is down the line from Brighton. The station is managed by Southern, who operate the majority of trains serving it; Great Western Railway and Thameslink who only run a handful of services per day during peak hours. It is one of the main stations on the West Coastway Line; all timetabled trains stop here. At times in its history the station had been named Worthing Central. This name is sometimes incorrectly still used, either out of habit or intentionally to distinguish it from and stations. Worthing is the only station in DfT category C that has not been given a subcategory; it is listed by DfT as simply \\"C\\", while all other stations in this group have been divided into C1 and C2. History The station opened on 24 November 1845. The first service arrived early in the morning from Shoreham but the official opening was scheduled for mid-day. Crowds thronged on Teville Bridge adjoining the station to witness a train from Shoreham drawn by a locomotive called \\"Ercombert\\", probably named after Eorcenberht of Kent (died 664), a king of Kent. As the train passed under the bridge, a local band of musicians played the National Anthem. The original station buildings opened in 1845 and are now Grade II listed. They were converted into 2 cottages sometime after 1859 when a new station was built further west. This \\"new\\" station was rebuilt and expanded in 1911. In August 2007, ticket barriers were introduced separating the platforms from the ticket office. However, their effectiveness is compromised by the layout of the station insofar as the rear car park entrance leads directly to the subway connecting the platforms. A small ticket booth, frequently unmanned, has been installed in the subway in an attempt to address this issue. In April 2009, the station was made fully accessible to disabled passengers, which new ticket windows which can be adjusted to height and a ramp was also provided. The station was also fitted with new folding doors.  Facilities  The main station entrance is on the south side in Station Approach. The passenger car park is on the north side of the station in Southcourt Road and has a separate entrance to the station. Parking is free only on Sundays and Bank Holidays. The concourse and ticket office leads directly to the side platform (platform 3), which is used mostly for westbound services. The island platform (platforms 1 and 2) is connected to this platform by a subway, which also leads out to the car park. Station facilities include:  Platform layout  The station has three platforms, all of which are long enough to accommodate 12-carriage trains. *Platform 1: only used at peak times, often for terminating services *Platform 2: used for eastbound services to , and *Platform 3: used for westbound services to , , , and beyond.  Services  Most trains serving the station are run by Southern with some Thameslink and GWR services at peak times, with the typical off-peak service consisting of the following: *Eastbound: **4 to via ; **2tph to via Hove and . *Westbound: **2tph to only; **2tph to ; **1tph to via and ; **1tph to via Chichester, Havant and . On Sundays the eastbound service is halved in frequency (2tph to Brighton and 1tph to London Victoria), while westbound there is 1tph to Portsmouth Harbour, 1tph to Littlehampton and 1tph to Southampton Central. Great Western Railway serves the station with two services a day to via , and , one of which continues to via , and . In the opposite direction, there is one daily service from Great Malvern (via Bristol Temple Meads). On Sundays there is no service to or from Great Malvern, but there is a service to and from Cardiff Central (via Bristol Temple Meads).

Their work was often presented in unconventional media forms such as postcards, prints, posters, wallpaper, balloons, crests and pins. Self-mythology was a continuous strategy that informed their work. They created a fictional system that self-referenced and self-legitimized, claiming a space for their local art scene in Canada. Their intent was to reach a greater audience and so their work moved from art galleries and museums to newsstands. This ensured that different types of people who spent time in different places could have a psychological or social reaction in a place comfortable to them.

This led to a series of self portrayal or marketing images including \\"Fin de Si√®cle\\".

Pre- General Idea  AA Bronson (aka Michael Tims, b June 16, 1946, Vancouver, British Columbia) attended the University of Manitoba in the School of Architecture. He dropped out of university with a group of friends to found a commune and free school. There, he became involved in writing and publishing as an editor for the Loving Couch Press. He became heavily involved with the commune and radical education movements. Felix Partz (aka Ronald Gabe, b April 23, 1945, Winnipeg Canada; d 1994, Toronto Canada) was also a student at the University of Manitoba, studying painting under Kenneth Lochhead and developed a casual acquaintance with Bronson there. Jorge Zontal (aka Slobodan Saia-Levy b January 28, 1944, Parma Italy; d 1994, Toronto Canada) arrived in Caracas, Venezuela as a post-WWII refugee. He later went to Dalhousie University to study architecture, and became increasingly involved with filmmaking. This interest took him to New York to take acting lessons. By 1968, he studied video recording at Simon Fraser University, and had established links with the Vancouver art scene. He took a workshop with dancer Deborah Hay at Intermedia. He briefly met Bronson while in Vancouver.  Meeting in Toronto  Bronson came to Toronto in 1969, specifically to investigate and participate in the Rochdale College experiment. Partz's then-girlfriend Mimi Paige was involved in Rochdale College, and Partz arrived in Toronto the same year, both to visit Paige and to find a gallerist. Zontal also arrived in Toronto in 1969, with the intention of filming a documentary at Theatre Passe Muraille. Page, Partz, Bronson and Zontal all subsequently became involved in the scene in and surrounding Passe Muraille, which forged their initial collaboration. Before long, the four, along with actor Daniel Freedman, moved into a house at 78 Gerrard St, which eventually became the first General Idea Headquarters. Their neighbour from across the street, Sharon Venne (aka Granada Gazelle), quickly became a part of the group. The name General Idea was, in fact, the result of a miscommunication at their first group exhibition, Concept 70. A Space listed the title of the group's work as the name of the collective, and the mistake stuck. Bronson would later joke that it was a reference to the \\"general idea\\"AA Bronson, \\"Interview with Anne Pasternak and AA Bronson,\\" Creative Time (October 2008), http://creativetime.org/programs/archive/2008/invocation/interview.html of the group's work.  Early Work (1969-1975)  The central themes that would preoccupy General Idea throughout their career ‚Äì self-mythologization, spectacle, appropriation, parody, media deconstruction, an ironic interest in commerce and the semiotics of advertising language ‚Äì were clearly present in the early days of the group. They shared an interest in the forms and methods of popular culture and mass media, and were influenced by the writing of Marshall McLuhan, William Burroughs, and by the Situationist International. The earliest activities of the group involved the use of their home: creating ersatz commercial shops, only visible to the general public through the street-facing window (a sign was always posted saying that the store would be open in 5 minutes), and creating installations and hosting exhibitions in their living room. They worked on an uncompleted film (God is my Gigolo, 1969) which starred the five cohabitants, and also included Honey Novick and Tina Miller. Bronson executed a series of chain-letter mail art projects, sparked by his interest in correspondence networks and mail art. It was via this participation in mail-art correspondence networks that the members of the group began using pseudonyms. Gabe became Private Partz, then Felicks Partz, then Felix Partz. Tims took on the name AA Bronson while co-writing an erotic novel with Susan Harrison (AA Bronson was a confusion of his nom de plume which stuck), and Saia-Levy became Jorge Zontal after a popular jazz song \\"I Just Want to be Horizontal\\".  What Happened (1970)  What Happened was a multimedia event organized for the International Festival of Underground Theatre at the St Lawrence Centre for the Arts and the Global Village Theatre in Toronto. The group's contribution was a multi-part performance based on Gertrude Stein's first play (also called What Happened). The whole play, in 5 acts and 4 intermissions, was spread across the three weeks of the festival. Events happened both within and without the theatre centre, variously documented by tape recorder, Polaroid cameras, sketch pads and VTR recorders . The documentation was sent to the theatre and displayed there. Among the performances that occurred during one of the intermissions was the 1970 Miss General Idea Pageant, which \\"crowned\\" Novick as Miss General Idea 1970. Paige and Gazelle were revealed as Miss General Ideas 1968 and 1969 (an inclusion that gave rise to the fiction that General Idea was formed in 1968).  Mail Art Projects (1970-71)  General Idea initiated two large-scale mail art projects: the Orgasm Energy Chart (inviting participants to log the time and date of their orgasms) and Manipulating the Self: Phase 1 ‚Äì A Borderline Case (1970‚Äì71). Participants were asked to photograph themselves holding the side of their head, and send the documentation to General Idea (who had since left their Gerrard St location for 87 Yonge St). The results were published in an eponymous pamphlet. Participation in these projects was facilitated via contact with Ray Johnson and his New York Correspondence School and the foundation of Image Bank by Michael Morris, Gary Lee-Nova and Vincent Trasov ‚Äì all General Idea collaborators/participants ‚Äì in Vancouver.  The 1971 Miss General Idea Pageant  Performed at the Art Gallery of Ontario, the Pageant was General Idea's major project for the year, created via the mail art network. Sixteen finalists were pre-selected, and sent an Entry Kit by mail. The kit was a box, silkscreened with the Pageant logo, containing various items: a brown dress (the Miss General Idea Gown), a typed letter of invitation by Granada Gazelle (Miss General Idea 1969), a General Idea business card, the Pageant program, an application form, an acceptance card, and photographs of Miss Honey (Miss General Idea 1970) and the Artist's Conception of Miss General Idea 1971. Finalists were asked to respond with a series of photographs of themselves modelling the Miss General Idea Gown. Of the sixteen people contacted, thirteen people responded. One person ‚Äì artist Janis Campbell ‚Äì refused, accusing the group of being \\"male chauvinist pigs.\\" General Idea took her response as an entry. The pageant was conceived of and executed as if it was a live-broadcast televised spectacle, and appropriated all of its conventions, including glamorous pre-show red carpet arrival. Audience reactions and cues were rehearsed. The judges for the Pageant were Dorothy Cameron, an art consultant, and David Silcox, a former visual arts officer of the Canada Council, the then-Dean of the Fine Art Department at York University. The Pageant, while successful, was an enormous undertaking. The members of General Idea decided that they couldn't face organizing such an event on an annual basis. They decided that the next Pageant would take place in 1984, and the group's projects and performances would be either in service of, or explicit rehearsals for this moment. Furthermore, it would take place in a huge Pavillion (the largesse of it reflected in the tongue-in-cheek appropriation of the French spelling) built precisely for the purpose. The selection of the date of 1984 gave the group a kind of goal, or deadline: to stay together and work together until that year. The Pageant format, and the implied timeline set by the deadline of 1984, provided them with a kind of thematic universe in which all their media experiments could be collected. Conceptually, the Pageant concretized the various self-mythologizing aspects of the General Idea project: an inhabitation and ambiguous parodying of the creative processes of the artist and the fame/commercial processes of the art world.  FILE Megazine (1972-1989)  In 1972, the group founded FILE Megazine. The publication served a dual purpose. The editorials of the magazine elaborated the group's major ideas. It also initially served as way for members of the mail art network to keep in contact with each other, and as a record of their activities. The magazine quickly garnered a worldwide following. The name and design of the magazine were meticulous spoofs of Life, and the collective hoped to use the visual familiarity as \\"a kind of virus within the communication systems.\\"AA Bronson, interview with Paul O‚ÄôNeill, NDP#3(2006), 2, http://www.northdrivepress.com/interviews/NDP3/NDP3_BRONSON_ONEILL.pdf In Issue 75: The Glamour Issue, they asserted that \\"in order to be glamorous we had to become plagiarists.\\"General Idea, \\"Glamour\\", FILE Megazine, vol. 3, no. 1 (fall 1975): 22. FILE ran for 26 issues, and was instrumental in the formation of a network of Canadian Artist-run centres, serving as a vehicle for artist's projects and the \\"wisecracks, wordplay, and cryptic layers of fact and fiction\\"Gwen Allen, \\"The Magazine as Mirror: FILE, 1972‚Äì1989\\", Artists‚Äô Magazines: An Alternative Space for Art (Cambridge: MIT Press, 2011), 147. of General Idea's self-mythologizing sensibilities.  The 1984 Miss General Idea Pavillion  In 1973, as the mail-art phenomenon had begun to fade, General Idea switched their focus towards the creation of the 1984 Miss General Idea Pavillion [sic]. The group began to create a series of architectural proposals that articulated various aspects of the Pavillion. The first realized installation was Luxon VB, a set of double-sided mirrored Venetian blind slats. They also collected a series of talismans: The Hand of the Spirit (an effete, arched hand made of plexiglas and mounted on a wand- like handle, which originally appeared in Vincent Trasov's entry for the 1971 Miss General Idea Pageant), The Miss General Idea Shoe. This was all under the rubric of the Search for the Spirit of Miss General Idea ‚Äì in the group's conceptual framework, an analogy for artistic inspiration and research. This framework served as a structuring principle for future performances (which continued to take the form of audience rehearsals). In 1974, General Idea opened Art Metropole, an archive, shop and distribution centre for artist's multiples and ephemera. The announcement came via FILE Megazine: \\"Art Metropole intends to keep abreast of the tide, housing and distributing evidence of activity and imagery: megazines [sic], publications, videos, correspondence, snapshots, memories and the ephemeral flood.\\". The shop opened on October 26 of that year, the occasion used as another opportunity to rehearse the public for the 1984 Miss General Idea Pageant. In 1975, the group staged another performance, Going Thru the Motions, again at the Art Gallery of Ontario. Similar in structure to the 1971 Miss General Idea Pageant (this time including a crew of 40 people, including cameramen who recorded everything, and all the trappings of pageant or awards-show glamour), this was another audience rehearsal. The evening featured a parade of the VB Gowns (a series of ziggurat-shaped 'gowns' made of manipulated Venetian blind slats) and a performance by Rough Trade. Going Thru the Notions was shown at the Carmen Lamanna Gallery in the same year. The exhibition was a summary of the group's thinking around the 1984 Miss General Idea project. It featured architectural blueprints, the Pavillion Hoarding (installed outside the storefront window of the gallery), as well as their Showcards Series (1975‚Äì79), an articulation of themes and beliefs central to the overarching Miss General Idea project.  1975-1985  The group announced, via a huge performance (done as part of a residency in Kingston, Ontario), the destruction of the 1984 Miss General Idea Pavillion in 1977. The performance was spectacular, featuring smoke-bombs, fire trucks and a newscast helicopter. The destruction of the Pavillion coincided with the group's increasing profile, both in Canada and in Europe. As they kept having more shows, the performative destruction allowed them to shift roles as artists, from self- styled architects to archeologists, and gave them a conceptual grounding to shift into a more object-based art practice (as had begun to happen with the Showcards and the architectural \\"features\\" of the Pavillion-to-be). A series of sculptures, prints and paintings were created as \\"fragments\\" or \\"ruins\\" of the destroyed Pavillion. The group used these fragments to further play with then-outr√© concepts: glamour, effeminacy, camp and kitsch, and by extension, homosexuality. The group adopted the poodle as their mascot. The animal appeared as a constantly repeating motif. It also served as a symbol not only of self-identification, but also as a vessel through which the group could continue their strategy of media appropriation, which in turn allowed them to respond to the artistic exigencies of operating within the larger international gallery world. The poodle images were vehicles for a series of stylistic appropriations, for instance, the orgiastic Neo-Geo Mondo Cane Kama Sutra paintings. The group also created a series of videos in this period. Pilot (1977) was commissioned by TVOntario, Test Tube (1979) was created during a residency at the De Appel Gallery and produced for Dutch television. Shut the Fuck Up (1984) was likewise commissioned by De Appel, this time in collaboration with Time Based Arts, also for Dutch television. Pilot, an appropriation of the documentary format, is a further elaboration of the General Idea identity. Test Tube (a faux-soap opera, complete with commercials) and Shut the Fuck Up are deconstructions of and confrontations with the media distortion of the persona of the artist. The group had been, throughout their career thus far, making multiples and editions, each of which was a further elaboration of, or in some way tied to an existing General Idea work. For instance, the products discussed in the Test Tube video \\"commercials\\" were turned into actual multiples (and by extension, the text of the commercials became the Getting Into the Spirits Cocktail Book, an ersatz cocktail recipe book). In 1980, the group created the Boutique of the 1984 Miss General Idea Pavillion. It functioned as both a display strategy and potential point of sale for General Idea's multiples.  AIDS and IMAGEVIRUS: 1986-1994  General Idea's attention was increasingly focused on New York, specifically the downtown art scene. The eventual move to New York City was precipitated by an increase anti-LGBT policing in Toronto at the time (Zontal was caught in one of the routine bathhouse raids performed by police), by a backlash in Toronto against non-material art practices, as well as the group's perceived disproportionate ubiquity and clout in the city's small art scene. They relocated to New York City in 1986.  AIDS Paintings and IMAGEVIRUS  The first AIDS painting was created for an amfAR benefit. It is an appropriation of Robert Indiana's by-then ubiquitous LOVE logo (substituting, in the same visual arrangement and color composition, the letters L-O-V-E with A-I-D-S). General Idea intended for their AIDS logo to get \\"out of their control\\" and they found themselves successful when the logo showed up on lottery tickets, posters, and more. The group (knowing that the appropriation and the consequent image was in \\"bad taste\\") subsequently decided to repeat the image in a series of paintings. The initial painting was painted on a white canvas in red lettering. It was then changed to exhibit different colored backgrounds with different colored lettering. In one example, the lettering of AIDS was painted on a black and white canvas in gold. Due to the color scheme, it was not obvious to observers that the painting spelled AIDS. This painting was placed on a metal structure and was displayed around the world. Following the paintings, the AIDS logo was turned into a poster campaign called IMAGEVIRUS, where the logo was wheatpasted along big sections of city blocks in New York and San Francisco (and then subsequently Berlin). The initial reception of the AIDS works was highly controversial, especially among AIDS activists. To them, the General Idea AIDS logo was distanced and ironic, when what was called for was unambiguous and direct (in response, Gran Fury appropriated General Idea's AIDS logo and turned it into RIOT). With IMAGEVIRUS, activists interpreted General Idea as going against what activist artists should be doing, namely countering government neglect, providing safer-sex education and fighting for access to medical treatments. Furthermore, critics claimed that, in its repetitions, it drained the word of meaning at a time when a political battle being waged over the meaning of the disease itself. The IMAGEVIRUS campaign continued to proliferate: as a public art project, it was displayed on the Times Square Spectacolor Board, it adorned the sides of trams in Amsterdam, and was installed in the advertising windows in New York City Subway cars. The image proliferated further, as wallpaper, public sculpture, and, at the behest of medical and charitable organizations, as stamps, postcards, and other ephemera (the image was used on the cover of the New England Journal of Medicine, and remains the logo for Deutsche AIDS Hilfe).  Final Years: 1990-1994  With Partz and Zontal's AIDS diagnoses, the group continued to address the AIDS crisis in various ways. They created a large scale installation (Fin de Siecle, 1990): a faux ice floe created from sheets of styrofoam with three stuffed harp seals ‚Äì a new form of animal familiar for General Idea ‚Äì isolated at the installation's centre. It addresses the imminence of disaster, isolation and precarity/fragility (a photographic version of the installation was created in 1994, furthering the identification of the members of General Idea with the three endangered seals). The medical/pharmacological realities of daily coping with the disease also appeared in General Idea's work. The pill entered into the group's visual vocabulary, iterated and reiterated in various formats: as helium-filled balloons (a foil version of which was an appropriation Andy Warhol's silver balloons), as a sculptural object of various dimensions (the group created large-scale installations illustrating Partz's and Zontal's AZT intake) and as a backdrop, featured in one of the group's self-portraits, Playing Doctor (1992), The group continued their practice of viral insertions/appropriations, recasting iconic images by Piet Mondrian and Gerrit Rietveld in the colors of the IMAGEVIRUS campaign. Partz had been commuting back and forth from Toronto to New York for most of this period. Due to his worsening health however, he remained in Toronto, eventually opting for home hospice care. Zontal and Bronson relocated to Toronto to join him in 1993. Both Zontal and Partz died in Toronto, in 1994.  Exhibitions  Retrospectives of General Idea's work continue to tour Europe and North America. General Idea Editions: 1967-1995 was featured at the Centro Andaluz de Arte Contempor√°neo, Seville, Spain from 30 January - 1 April 2007 , and included a recreation of the installations Magic Bullet and Magic Carpet, as well as the major installation Fin de Si√®cle. Before that Editions was exhibited at the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh, the Munich Kunstverein, Kunstwerke (Berlin), and the Kunsthalle Z√ºrich, Switzerland. General Idea has been featured in the Paris, Sydney, S√£o Paulo and Venice Biennales, as well as at Documenta 8 in Kassel, Germany. Their work continues to be exhibited in group and solo shows worldwide. Recent career retrospectives include Haute Couture at the Mus√©e d'Art Moderne de la ville de Paris, and subsequently toured to the Art Gallery of Ontario in 2010-2011. They had their first Latin American museum show/retrospective, General Idea: Tiempo Partido at Museo Jumex, Mexico City and MALBA, Buenos Aires, in 2016-2017. They continue to have solo exhibitions at Esther Schipper Gallery (Berlin), and are slated to have their first show with Mitchell-Innes and Nash in late 2017.  Legacy  General Idea is widely recognized as a leading part of a branch of a conceptual art movement that embraced the expression of ideas in multiple media. They were instrumental in the creation and elaboration Canadian artist- run culture. They are represented in the permanent collections of numerous museums, including the National Gallery of Canada, the Museum of Modern Art (New York), the Stedelijk Museum (Amsterdam). The estate of General Idea is represented by the Esther Schipper Gallery, Berlin, Maureen Paley, London, Galerie MAI 36, Zurich and Mitchell-Innes & Nash, New York. General Idea appears in Derek May's 1981 documentary film on the Toronto art scene, Off the Wall.

Holbrook, Mass. : Adams Pub, 1995. (pp. 149-50) Distributed by King Features Syndicate, it had a run from November 1, 1943 to October 7, 1989. The last strip signed by Crane was dated 21 April 1979. Characters and story During World War II, the adventurous John Singer Sawyer, nicknamed Buz Sawyer, became a Naval Aviator and flew as an ace Navy fighter and dive bomber pilot in the Pacific Theater where he had numerous adventures with his sidekick Sweeney. As a civilian in the post-World War II years, Buz became an oil company troubleshooter, traveling to far-flung locales. He married Christy Jameson on 13 December 1948, and their son Pepper was born in 1951. Buz rejoined the Navy in the 1950s and flew carrier-based reconnaissance attack jets over Vietnam during the 1960s. Roy Crane was one of the innovators of the adventure comic strip. Wash Tubbs began in 1924 as a humorous story about the romantic adventures of Washington Tubbs, but increasingly Tubbs became involved in exciting adventures in exotic places. With the creation of the popular soldier of fortune Captain Easy in 1929, the strip became, along with Tarzan of the Apes and Buck Rogers, one of the first adventure strips. However, Crane was an employee of the Newspaper Enterprise Association syndicate, which owned the rights to the Tubbs and Easy characters. Crane approached King Features with an idea for a new strip, and when they offered him ownership, he abandoned Wash Tubbs and Captain Easy in 1943, giving full concentration to launching Buz Sawyer. Crane remembered the events this way: :I drew Wash Tubbs until 1943, when I started drawing Buz Sawyer. It was during World War II, so I decided to make Buz a Navy pilot. It promised lots of action, and I also felt that I would be making a contribution to the war effort. Before actually starting the strip, and to insure authenticity, I did a great deal of research. I‚Äôve always loved to travel, so I went to many different places in search of information that I could use in the strip; I even spent some time aboard an aircraft carrier. In addition, I gathered together a very large collection of Navy photographs to use as background material. Rosco Sweeney, who is now featured on the entire Sunday page, was Buz‚Äôs wartime buddy. He was also the gunner on the Navy bomber which Buz flew. After the war, I had Sweeney start an orange grove in Florida‚Ä¶ the same as I did. I have no plans for bringing Buz into the Sunday page. Action is one of the most important elements in a strip. In fact, I feel that graphic pictorialization is the essence of the comic strip medium and that is what makes it a unique art form. When newspapers cut the size of the comic strip until there is no room left for anything but dialogue, then that will be the end of comics. Buz is conceived four weeks in advance. My collaborator, Hank Schlensker, finishes the layouts from my rough drawings. He works approximately one week behind me. I am also assisted by Al Wenzel and Edwin Granberry. I own the rights to the strip. The rendering of Buz Sawyer is done with Craftint; a technique pioneered in this strip as well as in Wash Tubbs. I have always been interested in trying new techniques, and I especially try to capture a three-dimensional quality in the strip. Daily strip Granberry began writing Buz Sawyer during the 1940s, continuing as the strip's scripter until 1983. In 1946, 31-year-old Henry G. Schlensker, who had created Biff Baker with Ernest Lynn (1941‚Äì45), settled in Orlando, where he became Crane's art assistant. An ulcer resulted in Crane's retirement from the strip in the 1960s, but he continued to work closely with Granberry and Schlensker. After Crane's death in 1977, Schlensker began signing the strip. The duo continued as a team until 1983. When they retired, John Celardo drew the daily until it was discontinued on 7 October 1989. Schlensker, who fought with the Army Air Corps in East Asia during World War II, died in 1997 at the age of 82. \\"He loved to draw, and he loved action. That strip was his whole life,\\" said his wife, Virginia Schlensker.Comas, Henry. \\"Comic Strip Artist, Veteran Of World War Ii Dies At 82\\". Orlando Sentinel. February 14, 1997. Sunday Strip -- Roscoe Sweeney Rosco Sweeney, who was Sawyer's comic-relief sidekick, was the lead character of the Buz Sawyer Sunday strip. The Sunday comic was titled Buzz Sawyer Featuring His Pal Roscoe Sweeney, and was about Roscoe and his sister Lucille, living and working on a Florida farm, which included a citrus grove. At times Roscoe remembered his war years with Buzz, and set out on adventures, but he always returned to the farm.https://thesaucersthattimeforgot.blogspot.com/2019/06/ufos-contact-in- comics-from-1964.html Sweeney largely disappeared from the dailies after World War II. Beginning in the late 1940s, Crane assigned the writing and drawing chores for the Sunday strip to cartoonist Clark Haas, who was a pioneer jet pilot. Later, Al Wenzel did the Sunday strip, which Crane brought to a conclusion on 19 May 1974. Awards Roy Crane won the Reuben Award from the National Cartoonists Society in 1950 (when it was the Barney Award). He also won their Story Comic Book Award in 1965. Books and reprints Roy Crane's comic strip was adapted into a Better Little Book, Buz Sawyer and Bomber 13. The daily Buz Sawyer has been reprinted by Comics Art Showcase, Dragon Lady Press and Comics Revue. Manuscript Press has published two books collecting the daily strip from the beginning. Only a few scattered Sundays have ever been reprinted. The comic strip was also adapted into a Better Little Book, Buz Sawyer and Bomber 13. In 2011, Fantagraphics Books published the first in a series of books reprinting the daily strips, along with selected Sunday strips. The first volume covers the daily strips from 1 November 1943 (the first strip) until 5 October 1945 (when Buz leaves the Navy). The second volume covers daily strips from October 1945 to July 1947, along with the Salvaduras Sunday sequence, and came out in 2012. The third volume covers daily strips from July 1947 to July 1949, and came out in 2014. The fourth volume covers daily strips from July 1949 to June 1952, and came out in 2016.

She was the first Queen consort of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, as Baldwin's brother and predecessor Godfrey of Bouillon was unmarried. Life Her name is unrecorded in contemporary sources, but since the 17th century she has been traditionally called Arda. She was the daughter of a minor Armenian noble named Thathoul (or Thoros), lord of Marash. Baldwin married her in 1097 after the death of his first wife, Godehilde, who had travelled with him on the First Crusade. Thoros promised 60,000 bezants as a dowry. This was a politically convenient marriage, as Baldwin was the first Count of Edessa, a crusader state carved out of Armenian territory in Mesopotamia. Baldwin succeeded his brother as King of Jerusalem in 1100, but Arda did not immediately accompany him south; she travelled by sea and arrived probably in 1101. In 1105 Baldwin had the marriage annulled, supposedly because Arda had been unfaithful, or, according to Guibert of Nogent, because she had been raped by pirates on the way to Jerusalem. In reality, Thoros had paid very little of the dowry, Arda had produced no children, and an Armenian wife was less useful in Jerusalem than in Edessa. Fulcher of Chartres, the chronicler closest to Baldwin, does not mention the matter at all, which likely means that Baldwin had no legitimate reason to annul the marriage. Instead, he simply forced Arda to enter the monastery of Saint Anne. Arda later demanded to be released and went to Constantinople, where her father had fled when his lands were taken over by Edessa. In 1112 Baldwin sought to marry Adelaide del Vasto, widow of Roger I of Sicily and Regent for Roger II. The marriage was arranged, although Baldwin was legally still married to Arda. Patriarch Arnulf of Chocques was deposed for having supported the marriage, but was reinstated by Pope Paschal II in 1116, on condition that the marriage was annulled; Baldwin agreed and then attempted to bring Arda back from Constantinople. Arda never returned, and Baldwin died in 1118. The dates of Arda's birth and death are unknown.

Neighbouring municipalities  Forst an der Weinstra√üe borders in the north on Wachenheim, in the northeast on Friedelsheim, in the southeast on Niederkirchen and in the south on Deidesheim.  History  The Salian Count Johann, Emperor Heinrich IV's nephew and from 1090 to 1104, as Johann I, Prince-Bishop of Speyer, gave his personal holdings in the Speyergau in 1100, among which was Deidesheim, as a donation to the Bishopric of Speyer. The vast woodlands north of Deidesheim, also known as Vorst or Forst (cognate with English forest and meaning the same) was excluded from this arrangement and was reserved as the Prince- Bishop's hunting ground. In this forest lie the village's beginnings, and of course its namesake. On 10 May 1525, during the German Peasants' War, Louis V, Elector Palatine led negotiations with the insurgent peasants of the Geilweiler Haufen and the Bockenheimer Haufen. When the French Revolution spread to the German lands on the Rhine‚Äôs left bank, Forst, too, temporarily became part of France‚Äôs territory. In 1816, what had once been Electoral Palatinate territory on the left bank was named the Rheinkreis, and later Rheinpfalz, and annexed to the Kingdom of Bavaria; the Palatinate remained Bavarian until the end of the Second World War.  Politics = Municipal council  The council is made up of 12 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman. Kommunalwahl Rheinland-Pfalz 2009, Gemeinderat  Coat of arms  The German blazon reads: Geteilt und unten gespalten, oben auf gr√ºnem Boden in Silber sieben gr√ºne B√§ume unterschiedlicher L√§nge, unten rechts in Blau ein durchgehendes silbernes Kreuz, unten links in Gr√ºn mit rotem Boden ein silbernes Gotteslamm mit goldenem Nimbus und Kreuzesfahne. The municipality‚Äôs arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Per fess argent on a ground vert seven trees in fess, the second, fourth and sixth taller than the others of the same, and per pale azure a cross of the first and vert on a mount gules and Agnus Dei tripping reguardant with a nimbus Or and bearing on a pole of the same a standard of the first charged with a cross of the fourth. The arms were approved by the Bavarian Ministry of the Interior in 1902 and date from a 1725 seal. The silver cross on the blue field recalls the village‚Äôs former allegiance to the Bishopric of Speyer.Karl Heinz Debus: Das gro√üe Wappenbuch der Pfalz. Neustadt an der Weinstra√üe 1988, The trees are a canting charge for the municipality‚Äôs name, Forst, which is also a German word for ‚Äúforest‚Äù. The oldest seal mentioned above had a fourth charge, a hunter, but this does not appear in the modern arms.

Forst lies in the Mittelhaardt- Deutsche Weinstra√üe Region and is famous for its wineries, above all for Forster Ungeheuer, Forster Kirchenst√ºck and Pechstein. The predominant grape variety is Riesling with a share of some 85% of the roughly 180 ha of vineyard area. The municipality's livelihood is also based increasingly on tourism, which itself is bound with winegrowing and gastronomy.  Transport  Forst is a ‚Äústreet village‚Äù ‚Äì by some definitions, a ‚Äúthorpe‚Äù ‚Äì meaning that, originally at least, there was only one road leading through the village, in Forst's case from north to south. Nowadays, a 1.2 km stretch of this road is part of the German Wine Route. In the beginning, this was also Bundesstra√üe 271 linking Bad D√ºrkheim and Neustadt an der Weinstra√üe. An early, small bypass road was built about 1970 right at the village's eastern outskirts; it has since been ‚Äúassumed‚Äù by the municipality. In the 1990s, the B 271 throughout the whole region was shifted a kilometre to the east and no longer reaches the wine centres. Over the B 271 and its Deidesheim interchange, however, there has also been since then a quick link between Forst and the Autobahn A 65 (interchange 11 Deidesheim), over which Ludwigshafen can be reached in about 25 minutes and Karlsruhe in about 50. Towards the north, the B 271 leads to Bad D√ºrkheim and the interchange on the A 650 (Bad D√ºrkheim‚ÄìLudwigshafen) found there.  Religion  In 2007, 52.4% of the inhabitants were Catholic and 29.6% Evangelical. The rest practised other faiths or none.KommWis, Stand: 31.12.2007  Famous people = Sons and daughters of the town  * Wilhelm Spindler (1861‚Äì1927), chairman of the Palatine Centre Party, Member of the Landtag and the Reichstag, was born in Forst and there ran a winery. * Peter Lewandowski (1957‚Äì ), journalist.

Smith holds school records for career rushing yards, career total yards, most points in a game (30) and most touchdowns (5) (vs. Texas Tech on October 25, 2003).  Professional career =2006 NFL Combine New York Jets  Smith was the 103rd overall selection in the 2006 NFL draft. The New York Jets drafted Smith as a Wide Receiver/Running Back/Quarterback in the fourth round. He was signed by the New York Jets on July 21, 2006 as a Wide Receiver/Quarterback. In a preseason game in 2007, he was played at quarterback and rallied the Jets to 10 points and scrambled for the game-winning touchdown. He was then declared a \\"bona fide quarterback\\" by Jets coach Eric Mangini and was listed higher on the depth chart at quarterback than wide receiver. Through Week 5 of the 2007 season, the Jets used Smith in a variety of ways, lining him up at quarterback, running back, and wide receiver. He was also a standout on special teams. Smith scored his first career receiving touchdown on October 7, 2007, against the New York Giants. On December 16, 2007, Smith substituted for starter Kellen Clemens who was injured in a game against the New England Patriots. Smith would then alternate with former starter Chad Pennington for the rest of the game, running an option and also attempting a pass. He is also a winner of the Jets' 2007 Kyle Clifton Good Guy Award, which recognizes consistent willingness, cooperation and professionalism in everyday dealings with various departments in organization. Smith was used in the Jets' wildcat formations. He had been injured (quad) throughout the beginning of the 2009 season, but emerged to become a leader of special teams, including being the starting kick returner. On December 13, 2009, Smith ran a fake punt play, in which he completed a pass to Eric Smith, having the longest completion of any team that day, the play went for 27 yards. On December 27, 2009, Smith returned the opening kickoff of the 2nd half for a 106-yard touchdown against the Indianapolis Colts. This is the longest play in New York Jets history, and tied for the second longest kickoff return in NFL history. In the last game of the 2009 regular season, Smith had 91 rushing yards, lining up at quarterback each time, having a 57-yard play, and scoring a 32-yard touchdown. During the 2010 season, Smith was mostly used as a wildcat specialist and return specialist. One of Smith's best games was on Thanksgiving of November 25, 2010 where he scored a 53-yard touchdown on a wildcat end-around and an 89-yard kickoff return touchdown in a Jets 26‚Äì10 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals.  Buffalo Bills  Smith agreed to a four-year, $15 million contract with the Buffalo Bills on July 28, 2011. The Bills used him that season mostly out of wildcat formations, and they also used him as a wide receiver. During the 2012 season, Smith returned an 89-yard kick off for a touchdown in a loss vs. the Tennessee Titans. On November 8, 2013, the Bills released Smith off of their injured-reserve list.https://www.wsj.com/articles/AP1400073e17624db0b24b07744ab7e7bd  Philadelphia Eagles  Smith was signed by the Eagles on November 12, 2013.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on April 14, 1996.. It was written by Richard Appel, David S. Cohen, Jonathan Collier, Jennifer Crittenden, Greg Daniels, Brent Forrester, Dan Greaney, Rachel Pulido, Steve Tompkins, Josh Weinstein, Bill Oakley, and Matt Groening, with the writing being supervised by Daniels. The episode was directed by Jim Reardon. Phil Hartman guest starred as Lionel Hutz and the hospital board chairman. The episode depicts brief incidents experienced by a wide array of Springfield residents in a series of interconnected stories that take place over a single day. The episode's concept originated from the end segment of the season four episode \\"The Front\\", and serves as a loose parody of Pulp Fiction, which gave the staff the idea of a possible spin-off from The Simpsons. The title is a reference to the film Thirty Two Short Films About Glenn Gould. The episode received positive reviews from critics, and is noted for its popularity among fans. Plot The episode is a series of shorts ranging in length from under half a minute to over two and a half minutes, each showing daily life in Springfield after Bart wonders if anything interesting happens to the town's citizens. # Bart and Milhouse spit and squirt condiments from a highway overpass onto cars, then go to the Kwik-E- Mart. # Apu closes the Kwik-E-Mart for five minutes to attend a party at Sanjay's house, trapping Moleman in the store. # Bart unknowingly throws gum in Lisa's hair, and Marge tries to remove the gum by putting peanut butter and mayonnaise on her hair. # Lisa's hair attracts a swarm of bees, one of which flies away. # While bike riding with Mr. Burns, Smithers suffers an allergic reaction to the bee's sting and rides to the hospital, but the orderlies admit only Burns. # Dr. Nick is criticized by the hospital board for his unorthodox medical procedures, only to treat Grampa with an electric light socket, saving his career. # Moe gets robbed by Snake after Barney gives him $2,000 to pay for a portion of his $14 billion bar tab. # While hosting Superintendent Chalmers for lunch, Principal Skinner burns his roast and bluffs his way through the meal. # Homer accidentally traps Maggie in a newspaper vending box. # Chief Wiggum, Lou, and Eddie compare McDonald's and Krusty Burger. # Bumblebee Man arrives home after a horrible day at work and his house is destroyed, causing his wife to leave him. # Snake runs Wiggum over, and their ensuing fight ends with Herman capturing them at gunpoint in his store. # Reverend Lovejoy urges his pet Old English Sheepdog to use Ned Flanders's lawn as a toilet. # Various townspeople advise Marge and Lisa how to remove the gum stuck in Lisa's hair. # Cletus offers Brandine some shoes he found on a telephone line. # Milhouse tries to use the bathroom in Comic Book Guy's Android's Dungeon, but is forced to leave the store before he can use it. # Milhouse goes with his father to use the bathroom in Herman's store and accidentally knocks out Herman with a flail, saving his father, Snake, and Wiggum. # Jake the barber cuts the gum out of Lisa's hair, leaving her with a different hairstyle. # Nelson laughs at an extremely tall man in a small car, who then publicly humiliates Nelson to teach him a lesson. # Bart and Milhouse squirt ketchup and mustard onto Nelson from the overpass, and conclude that life is interesting in their town after all. # Professor Frink attempts to tell his story but is cut off by the ending credits. Production The episode's principal idea came from the season four episode \\"The Front\\", which contained a short sequence entitled The Adventures of Ned Flanders, featuring its own title card and theme song, at its conclusion. The scene has no relevance to the main plot of the episode and was designed solely as filler to accommodate the episode's short runtime. The staff loved the concept and attempted to fit similar scenes into other episodes, but none were short enough to require one. Show runners Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein decided to make an entire episode of linked short scenes involving many of the show's characters, in a similar style to Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction. The title \\"22 Short Films About Springfield\\" was decided upon from the start of the episode's production, even though there are not actually twenty-two stories in it. Originally there were more scenes, but several of them had to be cut out for time. To decide who would write each of the segments, all of the writers chose their top three favorite characters and put them into a hat, the names were drawn out and the writers were assigned their parts. Oakley wrote the Superintendent Chalmers story, Weinstein did the Comic Book Guy and Milhouse scene, David Cohen penned the Reverend Lovejoy sketch, as well as the deleted Krusty the Clown scene. Brent Forrester wrote the Krusty Burger scene, while Rachel Pulido wrote the Bumblebee Man one. Richard Appel wrote a deleted \\"elaborate fantasy segment\\" revolving around Marge, the only remnant of which is her cleaning the sink during the first Lisa scene, and also did a scene with Lionel Hutz that was dropped as well. The episode's first draft was 65 pages long and needed to be cut down to just 42, so numerous scenes were cut for time or because they did not fit into the overall dynamic of the episode. To solve this problem, a scene before the second act break, where the townspeople go to the Simpson house to provide advice of how Lisa can get the gum out of her hair, was created to include every character that did not appear anywhere else during the course of the episode. Weinstein and writing supervisor Greg Daniels was responsible for ordering and linking together the episodes, and director Jim Reardon had the challenge of segueing between each section in a way that did not make the change seem abrupt. Those that were hard to link were put before or after an act break or were given a theme song, one of which was cut from the Apu story, but was included as a deleted scene on The Complete Seventh Season DVD. Bill Oakley wrote the Chalmers scene because he is his all-time favorite character from the show. The main reason he loved him was that, until Frank Grimes was created for the season eight episode \\"Homer's Enemy\\", Chalmers was the only character that \\"seemed to operate in the normal human universe\\". In previous episodes, Skinner and Chalmers' scenes together revolved around one joke: Skinner tells Chalmers an unbelievable lie, but Chalmers believes him anyway. So, their scene in this episode is made up of a string of thirteen interconnected lies. The dialogue between him and Skinner was something that had never been done before, in that it is just a long relaxed conversation with nothing important being said at all. In the Mr. Burns story, every single word he yells at Smithers is real and used correctly. To maintain accuracy, the writers used a 19th-century slang thesaurus to look up words. Many of the Spanish words used in Bumblebee Man's segment are easily understood cognates of English and not accurate Spanish; this was done deliberately so that non-Spanish speakers could understand the dialogue without subtitles. The very tall man was a caricature of writer Ian Maxtone-Graham, and the crowd on the street who laugh at Nelson includes caricatures of Matt Groening, Bill Oakley, and Josh Weinstein. Oakley wrote in the script that the street was filled with Springfield's biggest idiots and so the animators drew him, Weinstein, and Groening into the scene. Cultural references The episode contains numerous references to Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction. Like the film, the episode's plot is episodic, though the stories are interconnected. The policemen's conversation about McDonald's parallels the famous \\"Royale With Cheese\\" discussion, and the music played during the segment's beginning was also taken from the film. The story involving Chief Wiggum and Snake is a direct parody of the \\"Gold Watch\\" segment of the film. Snake runs over Wiggum at a red light, alluding to the segment of the film where the character of Butch Coolidge did the same to Marsellus Wallace, before crashing into a fire hydrant and beginning an on- foot chase. The two run into Herman's Military Antique shop, where Herman beats, ties up and gags the two, then waits for \\"Zed\\" to arrive, exactly as Maynard does in Pulp Fiction. The writers were pleased that Herman already existed as otherwise they would have had to create another character just for this scene. The episode's title is a reference to the film Thirty Two Short Films About Glenn Gould. Reception In its original broadcast, \\"22 Short Films About Springfield\\" finished tied for 73rd in the weekly ratings for the week of April 8‚Äì14, 1996, with a Nielsen rating of 6.9. It was the seventh highest rated show from the Fox network that week. On March 12, 2002, the episode was released in the United States on a DVD collection titled The Simpsons Film Festival, along with the season eleven episode \\"Beyond Blunderdome\\", the season four episode \\"Itchy & Scratchy: The Movie\\", and the season six episode \\"A Star is Burns\\". The episode is Bill Oakley's personal favorite episode, but he claimed that it is hated by two prominent (and unnamed) figures within the running of the show. When The Simpsons began streaming on Disney+ in 2019, Oakley named this one of the best classic Simpsons episodes to watch on the service. The episode is frequently cited as a popular one among the show's fans on the Internet. In 1998, TV Guide listed it in its list of top twelve Simpsons episodes. Entertainment Weekly, in 2003, placed the episode 14th on their top 25 The Simpsons episode list, praising the episode's structure and finding the Pulp Fiction references \\"priceless\\". Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, the authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, called it \\"an untypical episode, and a very good one\\", naming the Skinner and Chalmers story as the best. In 2019 several sources cited the episode as one of the show's best, including Consequence of Sound who ranked it number five on its list of top 30 Simpsons episodes, Entertainment.ie who named it among the 10 greatest Simpsons episodes of all time, The Guardian who named it one of the five greatest episodes in Simpsons history and while IGN named \\"A Fish Called Selma\\" the best episode of the seventh season, they added that \\"22 Short Films About Springfield\\" was \\"good competition\\" for the crown. In 2004, Empire named the episode's Pulp Fiction parody the seventh best film gag in the show, calling Wiggum and Snake bound and gagged with red balls in their mouths \\"the sickest visual gag in Simpsons history\\". The episode is the favorite of British comedian Jimmy Carr who, in 2003, called it \\"a brilliant pastiche of art cinema\\". Legacy The episode sparked the idea among the staff for a spin-off series entitled Springfield Stories or simply Springfield. The proposed show would focus on the town in general, rather than the Simpson family. Every week would be a different scenario, such as three short stories, an adventure with young Homer, or a story about a background character that was not tied into the Simpson family at all. The idea never resulted in anything, as Groening realized that the staff did not have the manpower to produce another show as well as The Simpsons. By 2006, the staff maintained that it was something that they would still be interested in doing, and by 2007 that it \\"could happen someday.\\" \\"22 Short Films About Springfield\\" also helped inspire the Futurama episode \\"Three Hundred Big Boys\\". =\\"Steamed Hams\\"= A steamed hamburger, sliced in half In one segment of the episode, titled \\"Skinner & The Superintendent\\", Seymour Skinner invents the term \\"steamed hams\\" to refer to hamburgers, claiming that it is an expression in the regional dialect of Albany, New York. Starting in late 2016, over two decades from the episode's premiere, the scene gained renewed popularity in Facebook groups and pages relating to The Simpsons. It has also spawned numerous parody and remix videos on YouTube, many of them featuring \\"Steamed Hams But\\" in their titles, including some videos from an original Seattle- Tacoma's FOX affiliate KCPQ airing. In 2016, Australian supermarket chain Woolworths noted that \\"about 1000 people\\" commented on its Facebook page inquiring about \\"steamed hams\\". The company responded to these requests by posting an image of hams with the caption, \\"We've received a lot of feedback from you all in the last 24 hours about whether we stock 'Steamed Hams'. Please note that in Australia, we call them Hamburgers. 'Steamed Hams' is an Albany, New York expression. Fans of The Simpsons, this is for you\\". The continuing popularity of the segment with Skinner and Superintendent Chalmers also caused an upsurge in fan-made YouTube remixes and variants in November 2017 and afterward. In January 2018, Bill Oakley, original writer of the segment posted the original draft for the segment on Twitter. In April 2018, a reporter for GameSpot, during an interview with actor Jeff Goldblum for the film Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, had Goldblum read the part of Skinner in a recreation of the scene. Goldblum commented at the end of the read, \\"I like the writing, too‚Äîthat was from what?\\" Oakley responded immediately on Twitter, writing \\"[I'm] not a fan of fairly big companies like GameSpot having famous actors perform scripts I wrote, verbatim, without giving me any sort of credit whatsoever.\\" The video was taken down within days of its posting.

Eventually, large lots of land were allocated to some 40 families. People of the settlement did not come from the settler mainstream establishment. Many of the original settlers were raised on the \\"hills\\". It gained a reputation for being particularly extremist and very callous towards local Palestinians, none of whom were allowed to pass anywhere near the settlement.Ami Pedahzur ,Arie Perliger,Jewish Terrorism in Israel, Columbia University Press, 2011 pp.112-113 In the early 2000s general elections, half of Bat Ayin voters expressed a preference for the Herut candidate Baruch Marzel.Motti Inbari, Religious Zionism Confronts Israeli Territorial Compromises, Cambridge University Press, 2012 p.100 In 1993, Motti Karpel and Chaim Nativ set up the Chai Vekayam (Alive and Well) movement in Bat Ayin, whose document, \\"Identity Card\\", stated clearly that the laws of the state of Israeli are not binding on West Bank settlers.Motti Inbari,Jewish Fundamentalism and the Temple Mount: Who Will Build the Third Temple?, SUNY, 2009, pp. 70-71.

Bat Ayin Underground Bat Ayin residents have been suspected of numerous acts of terror, aside from attacking Arabs: These include plots to attack Israeli politicians, and plans to blow up mosques, including those on the Temple Mount. Though arrests have been made, all suspects have been released for want of evidence.Inbari (2009), p. 179 A terrorist movement based in Bat Ayin, later known as the Bat Ayin Underground, was founded on the belief, shared by extremist settlers, that the Israeli government was acting against the interests of the Jewish people. The group's agenda has been seen as \\"isolationist\\" in its hostility to secular Israeli society and commitment to the Torah.Ami Pedahzur, Arie Perliger, 'The Fourth Wave: comparison of Jewish and other manifestations of religious terrorism,' in Jean E. Rosenfeld (ed.), Terrorism, Identity, and Legitimacy: The Four Waves Theory and Political Violence, Routledge 2011, pp. 103-111, p. 106. The notion of forming such a group apparently arose in late 1998, as a result of a conversation between two eighteen-year-olds - Shahar Dvir-Zeliger, who hailed from the Adei Ad farm, and Sela Tor, who alternated between Hebron and the Maon Farm founded by his brother Yehoshafat. The Maon Farm provided several recruits, as did the Jewish settlement in Hebron. They eventually recruited Shahar's brother Shlomo, Yarden Morag, and Ofer Gamliel, whose engineering background in the IDF was to prove useful in making a bomb. In early 2001, they began to engage in drive-by shootings of Palestine cars at nighttime on minor roadways, spraying them with fire from automatic weapons, and the planting of bombs in public buildings. Their most notable success was an ambush of a Palestinian Mercedes truck near Ramallah and Kokhav HaShahar, killing its two occupants, one a twenty-year-old man. Cell members claimed responsibility through a group called \\"Tears of the Widows and the Orphans\\". Overall, the group, once arrested, admitted to seven attacks of this nature, which claimed eight Palestinian lives and sixteen wounded.Ami Pedahzur, Arie Perliger,Jewish Terrorism in Israel, Columbia University Press, 2011, pp. 117-118Daniel Byman, A High Price: The Triumphs and Failures of Israeli Counterterrorism, Oxford University Press, 2011, p. 285. On 17 September 2001, the network planted two bombs in a Palestinian schoolyard at Yatta: One was timed to explode during the recess, and a second bomb several minutes later, in the expectation that teachers and students would be drawn to examine the damage. A malfunction caused the first bomb to explode earlier, and Israeli sappers managed to defuse the second bomb in time. In a second operation on 5 March 2002, the Bat Ayin group, retaliating for a Hamas suicide bombing at Beit Yisrael, planted a bomb in a pink ice cream carton at a Palestinian boys school in Sur Baher. Children noticed it, covered it with pillows, and informed their principal who called the police, but it exploded before they arrived, and ten of the boys were slightly injured.Ami Pedahzur, Arie Perliger,Jewish Terrorism in Israel, Columbia University Press, 2011, p. 119. In an operation undertaken on the night of April 29, 2002, Yarden Morag and Shlomo Dvir drove a vehicle with a trailer to East Jerusalem. They were initially stopped near the Beit Orot Yeshiva by Mount Scopus, because it was irregular for Jews with skullcaps to drive in Palestinian areas of East Jerusalem, at night. They were not detained, since police accepted their excuse that they were on their way to a yeshiva. The same police officers, Shimon Cohen and Barak Segev, later sighted the same vehicle near a girls' school, close by the Al-Makassad hospital in the At-Tur neighbourhood. The officers stopped the two and examined the car, finding that the trailer had two containers of gasoline rigged to two TNT bricks, and propane gas tanks. The explosive charge consisted of a \\"vergin\\" (military battery), and the device, in a baby carriage, was timed to explode at 7:35 am., when dozens of girls would have been entering the schoolgrounds. Later investigations revealed this was not a one-off strike, but rather, part of a West Bank network of settlers conducting a campaign against Palestinians. Israeli intelligence soon heard of a large cache of weapons, and suspected it might imply an attack on the Temple Mount was being prepared. Eventually, 6 men, residents of Bat Ayin and Hebron, were convicted, while other led members were charged with minor felonies or not put on trial. Efforts to discover the weapons catch and convict members of the wider network, who had connections to the Kach terrorist group, failed, according to Daniel Byman, because they had learnt the lessons of the group's manual on how to confront a Shin Bet interrogation.Daniel Byman, A High Price: The Triumphs and Failures of Israeli Counterterrorism, Oxford University Press, 2011, p. 286.

His body was found down the hill from the settlement in a secluded location where he frequently prayed. Two teenagers from Khirbet Safa confessed to the murder. On April 2, 2009, an Arab wielding an ax entered Bat Ayin and murdered Shlomo Nativ, aged 13. A 7-year-old child was also wounded. The attacker was arrested a few weeks later by Israel's security services.

Demographics In 2013, there were about 200 families, many of them residing as tenants, in Bat Ayin.Margarida Santos Lopes, 'A rabbi and a Palestinian farmer are neighbors, partners ‚Äì and friends,' at [Christian Science Monitor], October 4, 2013. The majority of the residents are religious-Zionist and Chardal Jews who adhere to a philosophy that combines spiritual religious life with organic agriculture, with Hasidic Breslov the predominate affiliation. Social norms are rigid, and some young people tend to leave. Bat Ayin Orthodoxy is popularly known as \\"Chavakuk\\" (Hebrew, ◊ó◊ë◊ß◊ï\\"◊ß), an acronym for Chabad, Breslov, (Rabbi Abraham Isaac) Kook, and (Shlomo) Carlebach. There is a Chabad Lubavitch community, as well. The Bat Ayin community includes doctors, builders, plumbers, electricians, and psychologists. Landmarks The area around Bat Ayin is rich in natural springs, (Heb. ma'ayanot), and one is used as a mikvah. There is also an ancient mikvah from the times of the second Temple that is not in use. According to OCHA collected testimonies, settlers from Bat Ayin began planting trees in the area of the Ein al-Sijme spring, on Palestinian land leased to the Thawabta family, in the late 1990s. Due to harassment, the family was forced to abandon its vineyards and orchards, and the area remains uncultivated. There are remains of an ancient Jewish village and a miqwah called khribet helal at the entrance to the village. Education and religious institutions The Bat Ayin Yeshiva is an institution of advanced Jewish learning for men offering two main programs: a Beit Midrash study program and a Smicha program for rabbinical ordination. Midreshet B'erot Bat Ayin offers women's programs, a conversion program, and seminars. The rabbi of Bat Ayin is Daniel Kohn, who holds a BA in comparative religion from Columbia University and received rabbinic ordination from the Chief Rabbinate of Israel. He co- founded the Bat Ayin Yeshiva, and served as co-Rosh Yeshiva for nine years.

VINING, PAMELIA SARAH (Yule), teacher and author; b. 10 April 1826 in Clarendon, N. Y., daughter of Daniel Vining and Lydia ‚Äî; m. 6 April 1866 James Colton Yule in Woodstock, Upper Canada; they had no children; d. 6 March 1897 in Ingersoll, Ont. Biography Pamelia Sarah Vining grew up on farms in New York and Michigan. According to a brief, unpublished autobiographical account, while still a child she moved to Oxford County, Upper Canada, where eventually she worked as a district school teacher for a few years. She entered Albion College (Albion, Mich.) in 1855, from which she received an msa degree the following year and where she subsequently taught for three years. In 1860 she was invited by the Reverend Robert Alexander Fyfe*, the first principal of the Canadian Literary Institute, a Baptist school in Woodstock, to teach art, literature, and English. She accepted the invitation and taught there until 1866, when marriage to a student of hers necessitated her resignation. The couple began married life in Brantford, where James Yule ran a private grammar school, and then, after 1 Oct. 1868, lived in York Mills (Toronto), where he was pastor of York Mills Baptist Church. In 1874, after James accepted a professorship in New Testament studies at the Canadian Literary Institute, they returned to Woodstock. Following her husband's death from tuberculosis on 28 Jan. 1876, Yule lived in Brantford and then in Ingersoll. She remained active in the church, particularly concerning foreign missions, and reports and articles by her appeared regularly in the Canadian Missionary Link (Toronto) between 1886 and 1889. Yule contributed poems extensively to journals and newspapers in both Canada and the United States from about 1856. Her earliest appearance in an anthology seems to have been the three poems which William Turner Coggeshall included in The poets and poetry of the West (New York, 1860). The appearance of eight of her poems in Edward Hartley Dewart*‚Äôs Selections from Canadian poets, which was published in Montreal by John Lovell in 1864, brought her work before a larger Canadian public, and Dewart‚Äôs enthusiasm for her poetry (‚ÄúThere is no Canadian poet whose poetry we have read, and re-read, with greater interest and delight than Miss Vining‚Äôs‚Äù) helped to establish her reputation. Her earliest separate publication was The names of Jesus; a poem, originally read at the Canadian Literary Institute on 27 Jan. 1866. A more substantial work, Poems of the heart and home, appeared in Toronto in 1881. Some time after her marriage she began to write fiction. Ada Emory; or, the sister's Bible; a story and Up hill; or Paul Sutherland's progress (1887) were issued in Philadelphia by the American Baptist Publication Society. No copy of Ada Emory has been located; that it was published in 1871 is confirmed in the autobiographical note; advertisements for it appeared in Canadian Baptist between 1873 and 1876. The only recorded copy of the second novel, the one deposited at the Library of Congress, was at some later point discarded. Sowing and reaping: or, records of the Ellisson family, a temperance novel, was published in Toronto by William Briggs* in 1889 (not 1899, as is usually stated). She also edited the papers of her husband and published them, together with her memoir of him, as Records of a vanished life . . . (Toronto, 1876). In addition to her poetry and fiction she published on religious subjects, contributing, for example, a series of Sunday school lessons to The Christian helper (Toronto) in the early 1880s. A number of unpublished manuscripts remain among her papers at the Canadian Baptist Archives, including ‚ÄúThe Heathen World,‚Äù a substantial non-fiction work that deals with the church's obligation to carry the gospel to the heathen. Excerpts were published in the Canadian Missionary Link between 1886 and 1888. Though praised by Dewart and of sufficient repute in her day to be included in Archibald MacMurchy's Handbook of Canadian literature (English) (Toronto, 1906), Yule's writing may strike the contemporary reader as somewhat artificial and didactic. Her work reflects the typical feelings and standards of Victorian Canada in matters ranging from nature to temperance, and all of her books are dominated by an entirely unreluctant Christianity expressed in a style modelled largely on Tennyson and Longfellow.

In this role, she steered the Child Poverty Act onto the statute book, alongside Stephen Timms. After the 2010 general election, Goodman nominated Ed Miliband for the leadership of the Labour Party. After his election as party leader, she was appointed as opposition spokesman in Labour's Justice team with special responsibility for Prisons and Sentencing policy. In October 2011, she became Shadow Minister for Media. In this role she has campaigned for better child protection online. In October 2013, she was also given responsibility for Labour's Arts policy. In 2010, she ran a successful campaign in conjunction with The Northern Echo to save the Zurbar√°n paintings at Auckland Castle when the Commissioners of the Church of England threatened to sell them. In February 2013, appalled at the impact of the \\"bedroom tax\\" on her constituents, she tried to live for a week on ¬£18. In 2011, Helen led Labour's response to the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Bill. On 3 December 2014, she became Shadow Minister for Welfare Reform as part of a small Shadow Cabinet reshuffle by Ed Miliband.Helen Goodman named as Shadow Minister for Welfare Reform by Miliband , bbc.co.uk; accessed 12 December 2015. Since February 2016, Goodman has also served as a member of the Advisory Board at Polar Research and Policy Initiative. From 9 June 2016 to 12 June 2016 she attended the 64th annual Bilderberg Conference in Dresden, Germany. Goodman supported Remain in the June 2016 EU referendum campaign, and during the December 2019 General Election was endorsed by the People's Vote Campaign. In 2017, she took part in a campaign to save the DWP office in Bishop Auckland from closure. She raised questions in Parliament regarding the proposed office closure and took part in a match and Rally opposing the closure on 18 March 2017 In July 2017, Goodman was appointed as a junior spokesperson for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs under Shadow Foreign Secretary, Emily Thornberry, with responsibility for the Americas and the Far East. In May 2018, she successfully led Labour's attempt to secure Magnitsky Clauses in the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Bill during its Committee Stage and was instrumental in a cross-party initiative that secured an amendment to the Bill requiring public registers of beneficial ownership in the Overseas Territories. Other work included developing Labour's policy on the crisis in Hong Kong in 2019, visiting Colombia in May 2019 to meet various stakeholders involved in the implementation of Colombia's faltering peace process and frequently pressing the UK Government to act on a number of human rights issues including the treatment of the Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang, the Rohingya refugee crisis and the rights of West Papuans. Alongside veteran MP Ken Clarke, Goodman first developed the concept of holding indicative votes in Parliament to resolve the Brexit deadlock. In March 2019, during the indicative votes held by MPs to decide which version of Brexit that they supported, Goodman again worked closely with Ken Clarke to secure support for the option to remain with the EU Customs Union. The Customs Union option came closest to securing an overall majority out of all the other options, falling three votes short. In October 2019, Goodman was again selected by her local party as Bishop Auckland constituency's Parliamentary Labour candidate. During the December 2019 General Election, Bishop Auckland was one of the 59 constituencies lost by the Labour Party. 2009 expenses scandal In May 2009, The Daily Telegraph revealed that Goodman had claimed ¬£519.31 for use of a cottage in her own constituency on her expenses, and had submitted hotel bills dated two months prior to being elected to the House of Commons. Goodman argued that she was carrying out Parliamentary business when using the cottage and thus her claim was accepted, and the claim for the hotel stay ‚Äì which was rejected ‚Äì was a mistake. She also claimed a ¬£600 fee for advice from her management consultant husband. Goodman pointed out that the independent inquiry by Thomas Legg into MPs expenses had given her \\"an entirely clean bill of health and concluded that none of my claims required further explanation or clarification.‚Äù Ingleton speech controversy Goodman in the House of Commons, March 2016 In June 2014, Goodman was invited to give a speech at the opening of a village fayre at Ingleton, County Durham, in the parliamentary constituency which she had represented for nine years. During her speech, she praised the village for the beauty of its waterfalls and caves and for its connection with the author, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. None of these features applied to the County Durham village, but were, in fact, references to the village of Ingleton, situated seventy miles away in North Yorkshire. The speech reportedly \\"baffled\\" the audience and after five minutes she was called away from the microphone and informed of her mistake. Twitter controversy In October 2015, Goodman attracted criticism from fellow MPs over a tweet mentioning Jeremy Hunt's wife. Hunt had mentioned his wife in a speech on Asian economies' work culture, and Goodman's tweet asked: \\"If China is so great, why did Jeremy Hunt's wife come to England?\\". The Labour Party issued a statement saying that Goodman's tweet \\"did not represent its views\\" and Labour's Shadow Leader of the House of Lords Lady Smith said Goodman's tweet was \\"absolutely bizarre\\". Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said it was a \\"terrible tweet\\" and called for Goodman to apologise. She later deleted the tweet and issued an apology.Helen Goodman: Twitter apology , bbc.co.uk; accessed 12 December 2015. Personal life Goodman is married to Charles Seaford, a Senior Fellow at Demos. The couple have two children.

Funerary magic Fragment of a tomb relief showing a funerary ritual scene. It depicts meat-offering of the \\"opening of the mouth ceremony\\". Late 18th Dynasty. From Egypt. The Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology, London Ay performing the Opening of the Mouth for Tutankhamun The ceremony involved a symbolic animation of a statue or mummy by magically opening its mouth so that it could breathe and speak. There is evidence of this ritual from the Old Kingdom to the Roman Period. Special tools were used to perform the ceremony, such as a ritual adze, an arm shaped ritual censer, a spooned blade known as a peseshkaf, a serpent-head blade, and a variety of other amulets. A calf's leg was also held up to the lips painted on the coffin. The ancient Egyptians believed that in order for a person's soul to survive in the afterlife it would need to have food and water. The opening of the mouth ritual was thus performed so that the person who died could eat and drink again in the afterlife. The ceremony involved up to 75 \\"episodes\\" and, in its most complete version, included the following stages:University College London *Episodes 1‚Äì9 Preliminary rites *Episodes 10‚Äì22 Animation of the statue *Episodes 23‚Äì42 Meat offerings aligned with upper Egypt *Episodes 43‚Äì46 Meat offerings aligned with lower Egypt *Episodes 47‚Äì71 Funerary meal *Episodes 72‚Äì75 Closing rites The Book of the Dead also contains a spell for this process, which the deceased may use on themselves: Translating literally as \\"opening of the mouth,\\" the Egyptian terms for the ritual are wpt-r and um-r. According to Ann Macy Roth, the verb wpi connotes an opening that splits, divides or separates: \\"it can be used, for example, to describe the separation of two combatants, the dividing of time, or even an analysis or determination of the truth.\\" Connections with Psalm 51 Parallels between the Opening of the Mouth and Psalm 51 have been noted.Benjamin Urrutia, \\"Psalm 51 and the 'Opening of the Mouth' Ceremony.\\" Scripta Hierosolymitana: Publications of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, volume 28, pages 222‚Äì223 (1982).

Its closest relatives are the Chilean pigeon and the ring-tailed pigeon, which form a clade of Patagioenas with a terminal tail band and iridescent plumage on their necks. There are at least 8 sub-species, and some authorities split this species into the northern band-tailed pigeon (Patagioenas fasciata) and the southern band-tailed pigeon (Patagioenas albilinea). It ranges from British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, California, and southern Arizona south in higher elevations through Mexico and Central America to northern Argentina. In autumn it migrates out of its permanent resident range into northern California, New Mexico, and parts of Utah and Colorado. It is found from almost sea level to , generally in oak, pine-oak, and coniferous forests. It feeds on seeds, notably acorns, as well as berries and small fruits. Description Upper body It is the biggest pigeon in North America, measuring long and weighing . The coastal subspecies P. f. monilis (averaging ) is larger than the inland subspecies (averaging ). The band- tailed pigeon has a wingspan of 26 cm. The plumage is gray, somewhat darker above. The head and underparts have a faint pink cast, especially in the adult male; the belly is nearly white. The distal half of the tail is also pale (except in the subspecies of Baja California), whence the English name. The bill and feet are yellow, good identification marks at sufficiently close range. Adults have green iridescence on the back of the neck, adjacent to a thin white collar on the nape. Juvenile birds have white feather edges above, giving a scaly appearance. Behavior and ecology At a feeder near Pecos, New Mexico This species is relatively quiet for a pigeon. Its voice is low- pitched and owl-like, often in two-syllable calls that rise and then fall (huu-ooh) with even spacing between calls. It also makes a variety of harsh squawking sounds for a variety of reasons. It builds a rudimentary platform nest out of twigs, in which it lays one or two eggs. Outside the breeding season it forms flocks, sometimes over 50 birds, and often becomes nomadic, following the acorn crop or moving to lower altitudes or other areas outside its breeding range. They commonly congregate at and drink from mineral springs, although it is not fully understood why. In addition to acorns and other seeds, the band-tailed pigeon will seasonally consume fruits such as Pacific madrona and Toyon berries. This species often visits bird feeders. With the introduction of English Holly and English Ivy, two popular plants in landscaping in western North America, the bird is found in persistent numbers in suburban areas now as well. The parasitic louse Columbicola extinctus, believed to have become extinct with the extinction of the passenger pigeon, was recently rediscovered on the band-tailed pigeon. The band-tailed pigeon is the closest genetic relative of the passenger pigeon and has been investigated for being used in efforts to bring back that extinct species.

The ambassador and ten other people were taken hostage. After lengthy negotiations, the hostages were freed in exchange for the release of a jailed Red Army member (Yatsuka Furuya), $300,000 and the use of a plane, which flew the hostage-takers to Syria. Syria did not consider hostage taking for money revolutionary, and forced them to give up their ransom.

Loyless (ca.1871 - March 19, 1926) is now best known as the managing owner of the Warm Springs spa resort (for which his financial backer was George Foster Peabody). Prior to managing the resort, Loyless, a native of west Georgia, served as a newspaper reporter, editor and publisher at papers in Augusta, Columbus and Macon. As a young editor Loyless earned a reputation for bluntness and a fiery temper that did not always limit itself to print. An 1897 dispute with H.C. Hanson, editor of the rival Macon Morning Telegraph (later merged with Macon Evening News to form the Macon Telegraph) in which Loyless accused Hanson of bias in reporting became so heated that when meeting Hanson in person Loyless struck him. Hanson in turn drew a handgun. By 1915 Loyless was editor of the Augusta Chronicle. He was one of the few newspaper editors in Georgia to proclaim the innocence of Leo Frank and denounced his prosecutors as corrupt. Though he continued to edit the paper until 1920, his editorials about Frank cost him his local popularity and made him an enemy of the Ku Klux Klan. Soon after his departure from the Chronicle, he became the manager of the Warm Springs resort. Loyless proved an ambitious caretaker of the much-in-disrepair property. After a young man suffering from polio discovered that the springs helped him, Loyless and Warm Springs attracted the attention of Franklin D. Roosevelt, who had been stricken by a paralytic illness in 1921, diagnosed at the time as polio. Based on his own improvement, Roosevelt decided that Warm Springs could help victims of polio, and he worked together with Loyless on improvements to the resort and spa. Loyless remained at Warm Springs until his health failed due to cancer in 1925. An obituary (featuring the subheading \\"Georgia Editor Was an Unceasing Enemy of the Klan\\") appeared on page 19 of the March 22, 1926, issue of the New York Times. Loyless is portrayed in the 2005 movie Warm Springs by Tim Blake Nelson. While the film gives the impression that Loyless was no longer active in newspapers at the time of Roosevelt's visits, he was in fact still involved with the Columbus (Georgia) Ledger (of which Loyless owned a percentage). Franklin Roosevelt contributed several editorials to the paper as a guest editor and nine guest-editorials for Loyless's former paper, the Macon Telegraph, which were syndicated nationally.FDR's ties to Georgia ReferencesExternal links * Franklin D.

A former politician, Newmark served as the Conservative Member of Parliament for Braintree until 2015. Prior to entering politics, he was involved in various businesses and was previously a Senior Partner at an International Private Equity firm. Newmark is currently a visiting academic at the University of Oxford and became a guest lecturer in politics after finishing his parliamentary career. First elected in 2005, he served in various positions including as Minister for Civil Society, government whip, and foreign affairs whip in opposition. On 11 October 2014, following fresh allegations of sending sexually-explicit text messages, Newmark announced that he would stand down at the 2015 general election. Newmark is a founder of the charity A Partner in Education, which helps Rwandan teachers deliver a better education to Rwandan children. Early life Bedford School Newmark was born in Westport, Connecticut, in the United States, on 8 May 1958 to Howard Newmark and Gilda Gourlay (n√©e Rames). He is of Jewish heritage. He moved to the UK aged nine and attended Caldicott Preparatory School and Bedford School and graduated from Harvard College, receiving a BA in History in 1980 and was a member of the Delphic Club. He was a Research Graduate in Politics at Worcester College, Oxford, from 1980 to 1982, and has an MBA in Finance from Harvard Business School and an MSc in Education from Oxford University. Business interests Newmark was Vice President in the International Division of Shearson Lehman Brothers from 1984 to 1987, a Managing Director of Newmark Brothers Ltd., a corporate finance advisory company, from 1988 to 1993, and then a director of Stellican Ltd from 1993 to 1998.

He has been a director of Connaught Brown since 2015 and a director of the Catholic Herald since 2016. Parliamentary career Newmark contested Newcastle Central in 1997, and Braintree in 2001. He was elected as the Member of Parliament for Braintree (in mid Essex) in the 2005 general election over the Labour incumbent, Alan Hurst, and was re-elected in 2010 with a greater majority. He served as a Government Whip for Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, Department for International Development, Department for Business, and Innovation & Skills. In opposition, Newmark served as the Foreign Affairs Whip (2009‚Äì10) and Treasury Whip (2007‚Äî08).

Newmark was re-elected onto the Treasury Select Committee in 2012 after 5 years in the Whips' Office. In mid July 2014, Newmark was appointed as the Minister for Civil Society, in the Cabinet Office.\\"Reshuffle at-a-glance: In, out and moved about\\" , BBC News, 15 July 2014Aimme Meade \\"\\"Nick Hurd resigns: what do charities want from next civil society minister?\\" , The Guardian (Professional), 15 July 2014 In response to a question, following his first public speech in that role, he said that charities should \\"stick to their knitting\\" and \\"keep out of the realm of politics\\". It was later argued that these quotations were taken out of context, and in fact suggested that politicians should support charities, but not interfere.Brooks Newmark: charities should keep out of politics Civil Society Magazine 3 September 2014 During his time as an MP, Newmark co-founded and co-chaired Women2Win, an organisation established to encourage women into politics and public service. Newmark is credited for increasing the number of Conservative female MPs from 17 to 68 between 2005 and 2015. He also co- founded the Million Jobs Campaign to address the need for more to be done regarding youth unemployment. In the 2015 budget, the Chancellor abolished National Insurance for anyone 18‚Äî25 and newly employed following a recommendation by Newmark. Newmark resigned as Minister for Civil Society on 27 September 2014, a day before the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham. David Cameron accepted Newmark's resignation following allegations, published by the Sunday Mirror, that he had been sexting with a ‚Äòfemale party activist‚Äô who was in fact a male undercover reporter who was posing as a female to deliberately target Newmark, having failed with various other male MPs, over social media. Fellow Conservative MP Mark Pritchard announced that he would make a formal complaint against the newspaper saying that \\"questionable techniques\\" had been involved in the paper's report. An IPSO investigation later cleared the Sunday Mirror of any wrongdoing in an announcement that came three weeks after the regulator was formed. Following a new \\"text-and-tell story\\" in October 2014 involving a young mother, Newmark announced he would not seek re-election to Parliament in the forthcoming general election. Life after Parliament Newmark is currently a Research Associate at the University of Oxford in the Department of Politics and International Relations. He is also guest lecturing at the Said Business School on private equity, and frequently travels to universities outside the UK to lecture in either politics or finance. He is the author of various articles on the war in Syria, Brexit, US politics and homelessness. In April 2016, Newmark was made President of the new Braintree District Community Foundation, an organisation led by local people supporting community projects. He has authored a report on homelessness at the Centre for Social Justice.

It is down the line from Brighton. The station is operated by Southern. Immediately west of the station, there is a stabling point and a series of sidings. Two trains terminate here every hour on a normal weekday timetabled service running to and from Brighton.  History  Historically, the station was planned to be the southern terminus of a new line running from the Midlands to the South Coast, and delivering holidaymakers to the new town of West Worthing; it was consequently built near the northern end of Grand Avenue, which runs from the station to the sea. The line was never constructed. The station was built by J.T. Firbank and opened on 4 November 1889. It was expanded by the addition of a large goods yard in 1905 which catered for the produce of the large number of market gardens in the area, but by 1932 part of the yard was given over to the carriage sheds which, until mid-2008, stood to the west of the station.Sussex Industrial Archaeology Society Retrieved 8 Nov 08 In January 2008 demolition of the former depot building began.

The series' primary focus is on the effect of advances in science and technology on western society in its philosophical aspects. The title comes from the philosophical idea that the universe essentially only exists as one perceives it through what one knows; therefore, if one changes one's perception of the universe with new knowledge, one has essentially changed the universe itself. To illustrate this concept, James Burke tells the various stories of important scientific discoveries and technological advances and how they fundamentally altered how western civilization perceives the world. The series runs in roughly chronological order, from around the beginning of the Middle Ages to the present. In the United States, the ten-week hour-long series was broadcast from 13 October to 15 December 1986, on PBS and was rebroadcast on The Learning Channel in 1993.Unger, Alfred, \\"PBS Presents Eight New Series, Many Specials\\"; The Christian Science Monitor, 16 October 1986 A 1985 companion book was published with the same title, also written by Burke, presenting the same general premise of the television series in expanded detail.

It closed after the death of its owner. The railroad ran from Wilton to Greenfield, New Hampshire, using a state-owned rail line that was once part of the Boston and Maine Railroad's Hillsboro Branch. The line is still in limited commercial use, but has not been used for regular passenger service since the 1930s. The railroad opened May 17, 2003, running from Wilton to the former Boston & Maine Railroad railyard in Greenfield, covering the entire route of the Peterboro Railroad which built the line from Wilton to Greenfield in the 1860s. Passengers were allowed to get off and stretch their legs in Greenfield before getting back on the train and heading back to Wilton. On August 23, 2003, the railroad began running almost a mile north of Greenfield to Greenfield State Park.Sisterbetty.org: \\"We arrive in Greenfield State Park an hour after leaving Wilton. The train pauses for fifteen minutes before reversing direction.\\" The Wilton Scenic Railroad had many plans before it ended service in 2006. One was to use the former B&M; freight depot in Wilton, built in 1860, as the Wilton Scenic Railroad's depot. Stuart Draper owned the building as a storage unit for his company Draper Energy. It was his dream to renovate the freight depot. The depot never became part of the railroad. Service was provided by a pair of 800 horsepower (600 kW), diesel engine Budd Rail Diesel Cars, previously used by BC Rail in British Columbia, Canada. Stuart Draper, the railroad's founder, died of a heart attack on January 31, 2006. In October 2006, the railroad's two RDCs were sold to the Newport Dinner Train in Rhode Island. In March 2018 it was announced that the owner of the Milford and Bennington Railroad (the current freight operator of the rail line), in cooperation with the towns of Wilton and Greenfield, was looking at bringing back the scenic railroad. In October 2018 it was reported that the owner of the railroad had entered into a tentative agreement with an owner of passenger equipment. NHDOT is currently assessing the condition of the tracks, and the New Hampshire Attorney General is determining if the line for passenger operations needs to go out to bid. Pan Am Railways, a regional class II freight carrier, has also expressed interest in bringing back the Wilton Scenic in its first ever attempt at a heritage operation.

This derivative of benzidine is a precursor to polybenzimidazole, which forms fibers that are renowned for their chemical and thermal stability.Hans Schwenecke, Dieter Mayer \\"Benzidine and Benzidine Derivatives\\" in Ullmann‚Äôs Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2005, Wiley- VCH, Weinheim. As its water-soluble tetrahydrochloride, DAB has been used in immunohistochemical staining of nucleic acids and proteins. Structure DAB is symmetric about the central carbon bond between both ring structures. In the crystal, the rings of each molecule are co-planar and the amine units connect molecules to form an intermolecular 3-dimensional hydrogen bond network. Preparation Diaminobenzidine, which is commercially available, is prepared by treating 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine with ammonia with a copper catalyst at high temperature and pressure, followed by acidic workup. An alternate synthesis route involves the diacylation of benzidine with acetic anhydride under basic conditions: :(NH2)C6H4C6H4(NH2) + 2 (CH3CO)2O ‚ü∂ (NHCOCH3)C6H4C6H4(NHCOCH3) + 2 CH3CO2H The diacetylated compound then undergoes nitration with nitric acid to produce an ortho-dinitro compound due to the ortho-directing acetyl substituents: :(NHCOCH3)C6H4C6H4(NHCOCH3) + 2HNO3 ‚ü∂ (O2N)(NHCOCH3)C6H3C6H3(NHCOCH3)(NO2) + 2H2O The acetyl groups are then removed through saponification: :(O2N)(NHCOCH3)C6H3C6H3(NHCOCH3)(NO2) + 2NaOH ‚ü∂ (O2N)(NH2)C6H3C6H3(NH2)(NO2) + 2(NaOCOCH3) The dinitrobenzidine compound is then reduced with hydrochloric acid and iron to produce 3,3'-diaminobenzidine: :3(O2N)(NH2)C6H3C6H3(NH2)(NO2) + 12HCl + 10Fe0 ‚ü∂ 3(NH2)2C6H3C6H3(NH2)2 \\\\+ 4Fe2O3 \\\\+ 6FeCl2 The reduction of the dinitrobenzidine compound can also proceed with tin(II) chloride instead of iron powder or with sodium dithionite in methanol. Applications In its main application, DAB is the precursor to polybenzimidazole. Diaminobenzidine is oxidized by hydrogen peroxide in the presence of hemoglobin to give a dark-brown color. This color change is used to detect fingerprints in blood. The solubility of DAB in water allows for adaptability compared to other detection solutions which use toxic solvents. Improperly prepared tissue samples may give false positives. In research, this reaction is used to stain cells that were prepared with hydrogen peroxidase enzyme, following common immunocytochemistry protocols. Relevant to Alzheimer's disease, AŒ≤ protein amyloid plaques are targeted by a primary antibody, and subsequently by a secondary antibody, which is conjugated with a peroxidase enzyme. This will bind DAB as a substrate and oxidize it, producing an easily observable brown color. Plaques can then be quantified for further evaluation. One other method uses complexes of injected biocytin with avidin or streptavidin, biotin, and then peroxidase.

Trevelyan is portrayed by actor Sean Bean. The likeness of Bean as Alec Trevelyan was also used for the 1997 video game, GoldenEye 007. Film biography= Character information  Once known as \\"Agent 006\\" under the employment of Her Majesty's Secret Service, Trevelyan betrays MI6 during a mission to blow up the Arkhangelsk chemical weapons facility in the Soviet Union while working with his close friend, James Bond (Pierce Brosnan). During the operation, Trevelyan is caught and apparently executed by the base's commander, Colonel Arkady Ourumov (Gottfried John). Presuming Trevelyan dead, Bond continues the mission and escapes aboard a supply plane. Bond later admits to M (Judi Dench) that he feels responsible for Trevelyan's apparent death. Nine years later, Bond's pursuit of a stolen helicopter and investigation of an explosion at Severnaya leads him to Saint Petersburg, where he learns from Valentin Zukovsky (Robbie Coltrane) that \\"Janus\\", the head of the crime syndicate responsible for the theft, is a Lienz Cossack. Later, when he finally meets Janus, Bond is shocked to discover Trevelyan, who staged his own execution at Arkhangelsk and now employs Ourumov, now a general in the Russian army. Trevelyan's face is scarred from the explosion at the weapons factory, a direct result of Bond changing the sequence detonation timers. Trevelyan reveals that his motive for his betrayal is a personal one. His parents were Lienz Cossacks who had collaborated with the Nazis but attempted to defect to the UK at the end of World War II. When the UK instead sent them back to the Soviets, many were executed by Joseph Stalin's death squads. Though Trevelyan's parents survived, his father, ashamed to have lived, killed his wife and himself. At the time, Trevelyan was only six years old. He was then transported to the United Kingdom and taken in by MI6, which continued to sponsor his training and education throughout his childhood (by Trevelyan's own account, MI6 thought he would've been \\"too young to remember\\"). He began formal work for the British government on turning 18 and began planning his revenge against the British government for his family's demise. He had considered asking his close friend to join him in his scheme but knew deep down that Bond would never betray MI6 to help him.  Scheme  Trevelyan's scheme begins with the theft of the experimental Tiger helicopter from the French frigate La Fayette docked in Monte Carlo, using his two primary operatives, Ourumov and Xenia Onatopp (Famke Janssen). With the helicopter, the two fly to the GoldenEye satellite facility in Severnaya, where they murder the staff and steal the access disk and keys for the GoldenEye satellite and program the satellite to target the facility in order to cover up the theft. The GoldenEye satellite, actually two disposable satellites named Petya and Mischa, are capable of emitting targeted electromagnetic pulses capable of destroying any machinery with an electronic signal. As Petya destroys the Severnaya facility, Ourumov and Onatopp escape aboard the Tiger helicopter, which is insulated against electromagnetic radiation. Mischa would then be used to aid Trevelyan in stealing hundreds of millions of pounds sterling via computer from the Bank of England in London, and erasing all evidence of the transaction. Mischa would also erase the bank's financial records, crippling the British economy and government, triggering a catastrophic currency crisis, and causing global economic chaos. Bond stops this scheme with the help of surviving Severnaya technician Natalya Simonova (Izabella Scorupco) and CIA agent Jack Wade (Joe Don Baker). Wade helps Bond and Natalya track Trevelyan's headquarters, and Natalya subsequently programs the GoldenEye satellite to crash after resetting the access codes. As Bond attempts to disable the GoldenEye antenna, Trevelyan attacks him. In the subsequent fight, Trevelyan finally gets the better of Bond, and is about to shoot him when Bond kicks a ladder releasing it and carrying Bond to the bottom of a satellite antenna, suspended high above the dish. Trevelyan then climbs down to Bond, who slips and is just able to stay on the tiny platform. Bond eventually knocks Trevelyan off the antenna, but reflexively grabs him by the leg. While hanging, Trevelyan smugly asks Bond, \\"For England, James?\\" to which Bond replies, \\"No, for me.\\" Bond then lets go, and Trevelyan falls all the way down to the dish; he survives, but is mortally wounded. Moments later, the antenna array, due to Bond's sabotage, explodes and collapses in a fiery wreck on top of Trevelyan, killing him. GoldenEye 007 (video game) *The original GoldenEye 007 had no voiceovers, and thus no voice actor played Alec Trevelyan. He is based almost completely on his GoldenEye persona, including appearance and back-story. *The 2010 enhanced remake of the original updates the story, setting it to the present day. With his original motivation of revenge for his parents' betrayal no longer practical given his age, Trevelyan's motives for betraying the United Kingdom are now his disgust at the current economic system; it is implied that he was actively involved in operations as Janus while still working with MI6 rather than starting Janus after his 'death'. His essential plan remains the same, however. His appearance has been changed as well. His background includes having served in the Parachute Regiment prior to joining MI6. He is voiced by Elliot Cowan and also uses Cowan's likeness. Reception Trevelyan is the only 00 Agent (other than Bond himself) to have a substantial role in a Bond film, which includes a sizeable screen and speaking time. The only other 00 agent to have any amount of screentime in a Bond film is Octopussys 009, portrayed by stuntman Andy Bradford. Apart from seeing the back of their heads or shortly before they are killed and/or dead already (Thunderball, A View to a Kill, and The Living Daylights), other 00 agents are rarely seen and only spoken of. When Bean auditioned for the film, he was considered for the role of Bond (see List of actors considered for the James Bond character). Trevelyan has been ranked among the greatest Bond villains and is considered the dark inversion of Bond.

She was first elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Washington and Sunderland West in 2010, but previously served as the MP for Gateshead East and Washington West. Early life Hodgson was born in Gateshead, County Durham and was educated locally at Greenwell Junior High School and Heathfield Senior High School, where she obtained eight O-Levels. After leaving school, she worked as an accounts clerk in the Team Valley, then attended Newcastle College and the Trades Union Congress Academy in London. Hodgson later worked for Northern Rock in Gosforth, and then as a payroll and accounting clerk for local companies. After being a full-time mother for a few years in the mid-1990s, and volunteering for the Labour Party in Stockton-on-Tees during the 1997 general election campaign, she became a party organiser in 1999. In 2000, she became the local Party organiser for two years in the Mitcham and Morden constituency, helping the sitting Labour MP Siobhain McDonagh to be re- elected at the 2001 general election. Before her election to Parliament, Hodgson worked as Labour Link Officer for UNISON. She was elected for two years as the women's officer within the Tyne Bridge Constituency Labour Party (CLP) in 1998. In 2002, she was elected as the secretary of the Mitcham and Morden CLP in the London Borough of Merton. Parliamentary career In 2004, Hodgson was chosen as the official Labour candidate for Gateshead East and Washington West at the 2005 general election. Her selection followed the retirement of the sitting Labour MP Joyce Quin, and came about as a result of an all-woman shortlist. Hodgson held the seat with a majority of 13,407 votes, and gave her maiden speech in the House of Commons on 25 May 2005. Following boundary changes, the constituency of Gateshead East and Washington West was abolished and replaced by two new seats, Gateshead and Washington and Sunderland West at the 2010 general election. David Clelland, then MP for Tyne Bridge, was chosen in December 2006 by Labour Party members to become the candidate for the Gateshead constituency at the next general election. Following her failure to be selected for the Gateshead seat, Hodgson announced her intention to run for selection as the Labour Party candidate for the new Washington and Sunderland West seat in September 2007, and she was selected. She was elected as the MP for that seat in the 2010 general election with a majority of 11,458. In Parliament, she has served on several select committees since her election in 2005, including the North East Regional Committee and the Children Schools and Families Committee. She has also served as the Parliamentary Private Secretary to Liam Byrne in the Home Office, Bob Ainsworth at the Ministry of Defence and Dawn Primarolo at the Department of Health. In June 2009, Hodgson was promoted to the position of assistant Government Whip.

She resigned from the role and supported Owen Smith in the failed attempt to replace Jeremy Corbyn in the 2016 Labour leadership election. Three months later, in October 2016, she was appointed the Shadow Minister for Public Health. In Keir Starmer's first oppostion frontbench, Hodgson was appointed Shadow Minister for Veterans.

Commonly, the size of a micropolygon is close to or even less than the area of a pixel. Micropolygons allow a renderer to create a highly detailed image. The concept of micropolygons was developed within the Reyes algorithm, in which geometric primitives are tessellated at render time into a rectangular grid of tiny, four-sided polygons. A shader might fill each micropolygon with a single color or assign colors on a per-vertex basis. Shaders that operate on micropolygons can process an entire grid of them at once in SIMD fashion. This often leads to faster shader execution, and allows shaders to compute spatial derivatives (e.g. for texture filtering) by comparing values at neighboring micropolygon vertices. Furthermore, a renderer using micropolygons can support displacement mapping simply by perturbing micropolygon vertices during shading. This displacement is usually not limited to the local surface normal but can be given an arbitrary direction. Further reading * Robert L.

He has been the Member of Parliament (MP) for Gravesham since 2005. He has been a vocal supporter of pro-Brexit lobby group Leave Means Leave. Early life and career Holloway was born on the 29 July 1965 in Faversham, Kent, the son of the Revd Roger Holloway OBE (died 2010). He was privately educated at Cranleigh School before going to Magdalene College, Cambridge where he studied social and political sciences, graduating as MA, before postgraduate studies at Imperial College London (MBA). After graduating from university Holloway attended the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst, from which he was commissioned into the British Army's Grenadier Guards in 1987. During his four-year military career he saw service with the British Army on the Rhine as an Armoured Infantry platoon officer, and in the Persian Gulf War.Profile of Holloway as an attendee at the 'National Security & Resilience Conference', February 2018, London. http://www.nsr-conference.co.uk/conference/speakers/adam-holloway/ After resigning from the Army in 1991 with the rank of Captain, Holloway worked as an investigative journalist and reporter with ITN, World in Action, Panorama, and also the Sunday Times. During his media career he produced an award- winning documentary series for ITV called \\"No Fixed Abode\\" (1991), in which he spent three months homeless on the streets of London examining the plight of the capital's growing homeless population, particularly those with mental health issues.Speakers profile for Holloway, 'National Security & Resilience Conference', February 2018, London. http://www.nsr- conference.co.uk/speakers/adam-holloway/ Parliamentary career Holloway was elected in the 2005 general election to represent the Kent constituency of Gravesham, defeating a former Labour Minister, Chris Pond, by just 654 votes, but with one of the largest swings from Labour to Conservative in the country at 4.9% at that general election. This was the first time since the Second World War that Gravesham (or its predecessor Gravesend constituency) had not been held by the party of Government. He delivered his maiden speech in the House of Commons on 28 June 2005. Holloway was also invited to speak (on 15 September 2006) alongside US Congressman John Shimkus to students on the campus of Southern Illinois University Edwardsville (SIUE). In 2009 a report written by Holloway suggested that some of the claims about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction used to support the UK government's case for war in 2003 originated from an Iraqi taxi driver, and that this may have included the claim about their being \\"ready to launch in 45 minutes\\". According to Holloway, reservations expressed by MI6 analysts about much of the data were ignored when preparing the case for war under pressure from Downing Street. He was criticised in the local media in May 2009 for having the highest expenses claims in North Kent, but argued his claims were legitimate. In the wake of the Westminster Parliamentary Expenses scandal in 2009, Holloway was ordered by Sir Thomas Legg, the head of a committee examining abuse of expenses by Members of Parliament, to repay ¬£1000 to the Exchequer which he had over- claimed.'MP's expenses, who's in the clear and who owes what;, 'The Guardian', 16 October 2009. https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/oct/16/mps- expenses-list-who-owes'M.P.

This came after all the other local MPs had given answers to the newspapers questions. Holloway was returned as MP for Gravesham on 6 May 2010 with 22,956 votes (48.5% of the vote) and with an increased majority of 9,312. He went on to be re-elected in 2015 and 2017. In October 2010 he was appointed as Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to David Lidington, Minister of State for Europe and NATO in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. In 2011, he resigned this junior governmental post to defy of a three-line (party) whip and vote in favour of an early referendum on membership of the EU.www.spectator.co.uk In October 2014 he was one of just six Conservative MPs to vote against air strikes targeting Islamic State in Iraq, after visiting a border region held by the Kurdish Peshmerga. He argued the campaign hadn't \\"been thought through\\". He actively abstained in the vote for air strikes in Syria in November 2015. In a September 2015 Parliamentary speech Holloway described giving asylum to refugees from the Middle East as \\"bonkers\\", stating than many asylum seekers go on holiday in the countries they had fled from and used his barber as an example. His barber, a Kurdish refugee, subsequently stated that he was holidaying in Great Yarmouth that week, not Iraq. Holloway publicly supported the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union in the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum.'Gravesham M.P.

As Chairman of the All Party Parliamentary Group on drones, Holloway provided an article to Politics Home and was interviewed about drones on BBC Radio 5 Live on 17 July 2018.

In April 2018, Holloway said in Parliament that sleeping rough is \\"a lot more comfortable\\" than military exercises and that the majority of rough sleepers were \\"foreign nationals\\", in a debate on tackling street homelessness. Rival politicians and charities pointed to evidence that 78 homeless people had died the previous winter and that 80% of recorded homeless people were UK nationals.

It is located in the Nilgiri hills, has a core area of , which is surrounded by a buffer zone of . This national park has some rare species of flora and fauna. This area was explored in 1847 by the botanist Robert Wight. The national park is one of the last undisturbed tracts of South Western Ghats mountain rain forests and tropical moist evergreen forest in India. Contiguous with the proposed Karimpuzha National Park () to the north and Mukurthi National Park (78.46 km2) to the north-east, it is the core of the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve (1,455.4 km2), and is part of the Nilgiri Sub-Cluster (6,000+ km2), Western Ghats World Heritage Site, recognised by UNESCO in 2007. Plans for a hydroelectric project that threatened the park's biodiversity stimulated an environmentalist social movement in the 1970s, known as the Save Silent Valley movement, which resulted in cancelling the project and creating the park in 1980. The visitors' centre for the park is at Sairandhri.  History  Map of Nilgiris Biosphere Reserve, showing Silent Valley National Park in relation to multiple contiguous protected areas The first Western investigation of the watersheds of the Silent Valley area was in 1857 by the botanist Robert Wight. The British named the area Silent Valley because of a perceived absence of noisy cicadas. Another story attributes the name to the anglicisation of Sairandhri. A third story refers to the presence of many lion-tailed macaques Macaca silenus. In 1914, the forest of the Silent Valley area was declared a reserve forest. Between 1927 and 1976, portions of the Silent Valley forest area were subjected to forestry operations. In 1928, the location on the Kunthipuzha River at Sairandhri was identified as an ideal site for electricity generation, and in 1958 a study and survey of the area was conducted and a hydroelectric project of 120 MV costing Rs. 17 crore was proposed by the Kerala State Electricity Board. Environmental concerns Lion-tailed macaque Silent Valley is home to the largest population of lion-tailed macaques, an endangered species of primate. Public controversy over their habitat led to the establishment of Silent Valley National Park. In 1973 the valley became the focus of \\"Save Silent Valley\\", India's fiercest environmental movement of the decade, when the Kerala State Electricity Board decided to implement the Silent Valley Hydro-Electric Project (SVHEP) centered on a dam across the Kunthipuzha River. The resulting reservoir would flood 8.3 km2 of virgin rainforest and threaten the lion-tailed macaque. In 1976 the Kerala State Electricity Board announced plans to begin dam construction and the issue was brought to public attention. Romulus Whitaker, founder of the Madras Snake Park and the Madras Crocodile Bank, was probably the first person to draw public attention to the small and remote area. In 1981 Prof.C.V.Subramanian, the internationally acclaimed mycologist, wrote to Mrs Indira Gandhi, seeking her intervention to stop the Dam construction which held very unique flora and fauna. Prof Subramanian also submitted a report on the Silent Valley on the basis of which Mrs Gandhi, decided to abandon the project. The Silent Valley forests were declared as a National Park. On 7 September 1985 the Silent Valley National Park was formally inaugurated and a memorial at Sairandhri to Indira Gandhi was unveiled by Rajiv Gandhi, her son and the next Prime Minister. On 1 September 1986 Silent Valley National Park was designated as the core area of the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve. Since then, a long-term conservation effort has been undertaken to preserve the Silent Valley ecosystem. In 2001 a new hydro project was proposed and the \\"Man vs. Monkey debate\\" was revived. The proposed site of the dam (64.5 m high and 275 m long) is just 3.5 km downstream of the old dam site at Sairandhiri, 500 m outside the National Park boundary. The Kerala Minister for Electricity called The Pathrakkadavu dam (PHEP) an \\"eco-friendly alternative\\" to the old Silent Valley project. The claim was that the submergence area of the PHEP would be a negligible .041 km2 compared to 8.30 km2 submergence of the 1970s (SVHEP). From January to May 2003, a rapid Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) was carried out. On 15 November, Minister for Forest Binoy Viswam said that the proposed buffer zone for Silent Valley would be declared soon. On 21 February 2007 ex-Chief Minister A. K. Antony told reporters after a cabinet meeting that \\"when the Silent Valley proposal was dropped, the centre had promised to give clearance to the Pooyamkutty project. This promise, however, had not been honoured. The Kerala government has not taken any decision on reviving the Silent Valley Hydel Project\\". On 18 April 2007, Kerala Chief Minister V S Achuthanandan and his cabinet approved the Pathrakkadavu Hydro-electric project and sent it to the Union Government for environmental approval.  Buffer zone  Territorial forests located around the national park have been subject to a working-plan to accomplish revenue oriented objectives such as extraction of bamboo and reed which affect the long-term conservation of the park. In addition Illegal activities such as ganja cultivation, setting forest fires, trapping and poaching wild animals, frequently occur in the territorial forests located in the immediate vicinity of the national park. This has resulted in degradation of habitat and reduced forest cover, which has adverse effects on the long-term survival of the core area of the national park.

This means that the total park area is now increased to . It is now the largest national park in Kerala. On 6 June 2007 the Kerala cabinet approved the buffer zone proposal. The new 147.22 km2 zone will include 80.75 km2 taken from Attapady Forest Range, 27.09 km2 from Mannarkkad Forest Range and 39.38 km2 from Kalikavu Forest Range and consolidated to form a new range, Bhavani Forest Range, of 94 km2 and 54 km2 would be brought under the existing Silent Valley Range of the National Park. The Cabinet also sanctioned 35 staff to protect the area and two new forest stations in Bhavani range at Anavai and Thudukki. Forest Minister Benoy Viswom said \\"the zone would have reserve forest status and tribals in the area would not be affected. The decision reaffirmed the commitment of the LDF Government to protection of environment. The zone is a necessity, not just of the State but also of the nation.\\" The proposal was then sent to Kerala Minister for Electricity, Mr. A.K. Balan, who has voiced the need for setting up the Pathrakadavu hydroelectric project in the proposed southwest buffer zone of the National Park, the Thenkara Range of the Mannarkkad Forest Division. As of 9 May 2007 Mr. Balan has not given his opinion on the buffer zone proposal. In August 2006, the new Minister for Forests, Benoy Viswom, approved a proposal from the Conservator of Forests for a 148 km2 buffer zone around the core area of the park. The proposal says: \\"It is felt absolutely essential that an effective buffer of forests should be immediately formed around the national park in order to save the world famous Silent Valley National Park from all potential dangers. This can only be achieved by bringing the management of Silent Valley National Park as well as the proposed buffer zone under one management umbrella to insulate the park from all possible dangers.\\" The proposed buffer zone will have 94 km2 in Attappady Reserve Forest east of the Kunthipuzha and 54 km2 taken from the Mannarkaad range and Nilambur south division west of the river. In January 2006, the former Kerala Minister for Forest and Environment, A. Sujanapal, said the Government would consider the demand for a 600 km2 buffer zone for Silent Valley National Park made by Bharathapuzha Protection Committee, Malampuzha Protection Committee, One Earth One Life and Jana Jagratha. A buffer zone proposal was made in the 1986 park management plan but not implemented. In 1979, Dr. M.S. Swaminathan, then Secretary to the Department of Agriculture, visited the Silent Valley area and suggested that 389.52 km2 including the Silent Valley (89.52 km2), New Amarambalam (80 km2), Attappadi (120 km2) in Kerala and Kunda in Coimbatore (100 km2) reserve forests, should be developed into a National Rainforest Biosphere Reserve. Geography Hanging Bridge across the Kuntipuzha River ‚Äì Silent Valley National Park (SVNP) Silent Valley National Park Topography 1:250,000., 1959'. Silent Valley is rectangular, twelve kilometres from north to south and seven from east to west. Located between 11¬∞03' to 11¬∞13' N (latitude) and 76¬∞21' to 76¬∞35' E (longitude) it is separated from the eastern and northern high altitude plateaus of the (Nilgiris Mountains) by high continuous ridges including Sispara Peak (2,206 m) at the north end of the park. The park gradually slopes southward down to the Palakkad plains and to the west it is bounded by irregular ridges. The altitude varies from 658 m to 2328 m at Anginda Peak, but most of the park lies within the altitude range of 880 m to 1200 m. Soils are blackish and slightly acidic in evergreen forests where there is good accumulation of organic matter. The underlying rock in the area is granite with schists and gneiss, which give rise to the loamy laterite soils on slopes. Rivers The Kunthipuzha River drains the entire 15 km length of the park from north to south into the Bharathapuzha River. Kunthipuzha River divides the park into a narrow eastern sector of width 2 kilometers and a wide western sector of 5 kilometers. The river is characterized by its crystal clear water and perennial nature. The main tributaries of the river, Kunthancholapuzha, Karingathodu, Madrimaranthodu, Valiaparathodu and Kummaathanthodu originate on the upper slopes of the eastern side of the valley. The river is uniformly shallow, with no flood plains or meanders. Its bed falls from 1,861 m to 900 m over a distance of 12 km, the last 8 km being particularly level with a fall of only 60 m. Kunthipuzha is one of the less torrential rivers of the Western Ghats, with a pesticide-free catchment area. Climate Silent Valley from JPL Map server. Silent Valley gets copious amounts of rainfall during the monsoons, but the actual amount varies within the region due to the varied topography. In general, rainfall is higher at higher altitudes and decreases from the west to the east due to the rain shadow effect. Eighty per cent of the rainfall occurs during the south-west monsoon between June and September. The park also receives a significant amount of rainfall during the north-east monsoon between October and November. The park being completely enclosed within a ring of hills, has its own micro-climate and probably receives some convectional rainfall, in addition to rain from the two monsoons. In the remaining months, condensation on vegetation of mist shrouding the valley is estimated to yield 15 per cent of the total water generated in the rainforest. In 2006, the Walakkad area of the park received the highest ever annual rainfall of 9,569.6 mm. In 2000, the figure was 7,788 mm; in 2001, 8,351.9 mm; in 2004, 8465.3 mm; and in 2005, 9,347.8 mm. The annual rainfall received in the valley (at Sairandhri?) was 7,788.8 mm in 2000; 8,361.9 mm in 2001. In 2002, 4,262.5 mm; in 2003, 3,499.65 mm; in 2004, 6,521.27 mm, in 2005, 6,919.38 mm; in 2006, 6,845.05 mm; in 2007, 6,009.35 mm; and in 2008 it was 4386.5 mm. The figure till October 2009 was 5,477.4 mm. Average annual rainfall in the park between 2000 and 2008 was thus 6,066 mm. The mean annual temperature is 20.2 ¬∞C. The hottest months are April and May when the mean temperature is 23 ¬∞C and the coolest months are January and February when the mean temperature is 18 ¬∞C. Because of the high rainfall, the relative humidity is consistently high (above 95%) between June and December.  Indigenous people Attappadi tribal chief at Kuntipuzha River There is no record of the valley ever having been settled, but the Mudugar and Irula tribal people are indigenous to the area and do live in the adjacent valley of Attappady Reserved Forest. Also, the Kurumbar people live in the highest range outside the park bordering on the Nilgiris. Many of the Mudugar, Irula and Kurumbar now work as day labourers and porters. Some work for the Forest Department in the park as forest guards and visitor guides. 16 out of 21 tribal colonies in the Attappady range cultivate marijuana. Many Mudugar are in abject poverty and easily recruited by the so-called ganja mafia. In 2006, it was planned to employ 50 additional men from the 21 tribal settlements as forest guards. Flora and fauna The valley areas of the park are in a Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests Ecoregion. Hilly areas above 1,000 m are in the South Western Ghats montane rain forests region. Above 1,500 m, the evergreen forests begin to give way to stunted forests, called sholas, interspersed with open grassland, both of which are of interest to ecologists as the rich biodiversity here has never been disturbed by human settlements. Several threatened species are endemic here. New plant and animal species are often discovered here. Fauna Birds = A thumb Birdlife International lists 16 bird species in Silent Valley as threatened or restricted:- Nilgiri wood-pigeon, Malabar parakeet, Malabar grey hornbill, white-bellied treepie, grey-headed bulbul, broad-tailed grassbird, rufous babbler, Wynaad laughing thrush, Nilgiri laughing thrush, Nilgiri blue robin, black-and-rufous flycatcher, Nilgiri flycatcher, white-bellied blue-flycatcher, crimson-backed sunbird and Nilgiri pipit.BirdLife International 2005 World Bird Database, Version 2.0. Cambridge, UK: BirdLife International. Available: World Bird Database, accessed 3/24/2007 Rare bird species found here include the Ceylon frogmouth and great Indian hornbill. The 2006 winter bird survey discovered the long- legged buzzard, a new species of raptor at Sispara, the park's highest peak. The survey found 10 endangered species recorded in the IUCN Red List including the red winged crested cuckoo, Malabar pied hornbill and pale harrier. The area is home to 15 endemic species including the black-and-orange flycatcher. It recorded 138 species of birds including 17 species that were newly observed in the Silent Valley area. The most abundant bird was the black bulbul. = Mammals = There are at least 34 species of mammals at Silent Valley including the threatened lion-tailed macaque, Niligiri langur, Malabar giant squirrel, Nilgiri tahr, Peshwa's bat (Myotis peshwa) and hairy-winged bat. There are nine species of bats, rats and mice. Distribution and demography of all diurnal primates were studied in Silent Valley National Park and adjacent areas for a period of three years from 1993 to 1996. Fourteen troops of lion- tailed macaque, eighty-five troops of Nilgiri langur, fifteen troops of bonnet macaque and seven troops of Hanuman langur were observed. Of these, the Nilgiri langur was randomly distributed, whereas the lion-tailed macaque troops were confined to the southern sector of the Park. Bonnet macaques and Hanuman langurs were occasional visitors. The Silent Valley forest remains one of the most undisturbed viable habitats left for the endemic and endangered primates lion-tailed macaque and Nilgiri langur. Tiger, leopard, leopard cat, jungle cat, common palm civet, small Indian civet, brown palm civet, ruddy mongoose, stripe-necked mongoose, dhole, clawless otter, sloth bear, small Travancore flying squirrel, Indian pangolin (scaly anteater), porcupine, wild boar, sambar, spotted deer, barking deer, mouse deer, elephant and gaur also live here. = Insects = Vestalis submontana, endemic to Western Ghats There are at least 730 identified species of insects in the park. The maximum number of species belong to the orders Lepidoptera and Coleoptera. Many unclassified species have been collected and there is a need for further studies. 33 species of crickets and grasshoppers have been recorded of which one was new. 41 species of true bugs (eight new) have been recorded. 128 species of beetles including 10 new species have been recorded. Over 128 species of butterflies and 400 species of moths live here. A 1993 study found butterflies belonging to 9 families. The families Nymphalidae and Papilionidae contained the maximum number of species. 13 species were endemic to South India, including 5 species having protected status. Seven species of butterflies were observed migrating in a mixed swarm of thousands of butterflies towards the Silent Valley National Park. In one instance an observer noted several birds attempting to catch these butterflies. A survey jointly conducted by Indian Dragonfly Society and the Forest and Wildlife Department in September 2018 in the buffer zone of the Silent Valley National Park found 82 species of odonata. The species found include Indosticta deccanensis, Burmagomphus laidlawi, Microgomphus souteri, Onychogomphus nilgiriensis, Euphaea dispar, Idionyx travancorensis, Megalogomphus hannyngtoni and Lestes dorothea. = Other = Silent Valley Bush Frog, Raorchestes silentvalley At least 500 species of earthworms and leeches have also been identified in the park. The Silent Valley Bush Frog, Raorchestes silentvalley, first described in 2016, is named after the park.  Flora  The flora of the valley include about a 1000 species of flowering plants, 108 species of orchids, 100 ferns and fern allies, 200 liverworts, 75 lichens and about 200 algae. A majority of these plants are endemic to the Western Ghats. Senecio neelgherryanus in Silent Valley thumb =Flowering plants= Angiosperm flora currently identified here include 966 species belonging to 134 families and 599 genera. There are 701 Dicotyledons distributed among 113 families and 420 genera. There are 265 Monocotyledons here distributed among 21 families and 139 genera. Families best represented are the Orchids with 108 species including the rare, endemic and highly endangered orchids Ipsea malabarica, Bulbophyllum silentvalliensis and Eria tiagii, Grasses (56), Legumes (55), Rubiaceae (49) and Asters (45). There are many rare, endemic and economically valuable species, such as cardamom Ellettaria cardamomum, black pepper Piper nigrum, yams Dioscorea spp., beans Phaseolus sp., a pest- resistant strain of rice Oryza Pittambi, and 110 plant species of importance in Ayurvedic medicine. Seven new plant species have been recorded from Silent Valley, including in 1996, Impatiens sivarajanii, a new species of Balsaminaceae. =Trees= Occurrence of lion-tailed macaque is dependent on the flowering of Cullenia exarillata in the forest. Six distinct tree associations have been described in the valley. Three are restricted to the southern sector: *Cullenia exarillata and Palaquium ellipticum *Palaquium ellipticum and Mesua ferrea (Indian rose chestnut) *Mesua ferrea and Calophyllum elatum The remainder are confined to the central and northern parts of the park: *Palaquium ellipticum and Poeciloneuron indicum *Calophyllum elatum and Ochlandra species *Poeciloneuron indicum and Ochlandra species A study of natural regeneration of 12 important tree species of Silent Valley tropical rain forests showed good natural regeneration of all 12 species. The species studied were Palaquium ellipticum, Cullenia exarillata, Poeciloneuron indicum, Myristica dactyloides, Elaeocarpus glandulosus, Litsea floribunda, Mesua nagassarium, Cinnamomum malabatrum, Agrostistachys meeboldii, Calophyllum polyanthum, Garcinia morella and Actinodaphne campanulata. Recent selective felling of three trees per acre, has led to the cutting of 48,000 m3 of timber from about 20 km2. There is a huge hollow kattualying tree here which can fit 12 people inside. =Genetic resources= Throughout human history about 10% of the genetic stock found in the wild has been bred into palatable and higher yielding cereals, fruits and vegetables. Future food security depends on the preservation of the remaining 90% of the stock through protection of high biodiversity habitats like Silent valley. The National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources of ICAR (India), Plant Exploration and Collection Division has identified Silent Valley as high in bio-diversity and an important Gene Pool resource for Recombinant DNA innovations. An important example of use of wild germplasm is gene selection from the wild varieties of rice Oryza nivara (Central India) and Oryza Pittambi found in Silent Valley for the traits of broad spectrum disease resistance in high yielding hybrid rice varieties including IR-36, which are responsible for much of the Green Revolution throughout Asia. Also, genetic evaluation of plant growth promoting Rhizobacteria obtained from Silent Valley indicated that strain, IISR 331, could increase the growth of black pepper cuttings by 228% and showed 82.7% inhibition of the common plant wilting disease Phytopthora capsici in laboratory tests (in vitro).  Challenges =Forest fire Fire is one of the major threats facing forests in Kerala. People engaged in grazing livestock often burn an area to get fresh grass shoots for their cattle, especially during dry season when fire danger is greatest. Also, illicit activities like ganja cultivation, poaching, tree felling, non timber forest products (NTFP) collection and very often careless tourists and pilgrims are responsible for big forest fires. Cannabis cultivation Silent Valley is home to some of India's largest illegal plantations of cannabis. Cannabis is one of the traditional plantations in these forests and there are people who depend on 'Ganja economy' for a livelihood. Tribes like Irula, Muduga and Kurumba (particularly the last one) have always grown cannabis in their history.Stone Age  Outlook India Magazine The seedless variety of cannabis cultivated in Silent Valley is known as Sairandhri and is renowned internationally for its quality. According to former additional chief secretary Madhava Menon, the cannabis cultivated here is one of the best in the world and is sold worldwide. The cannabis mafia has cut hundreds of acres of evergreen tropical forest in the Attappady Hills, including Silent Valley buffer zones, for illegal cultivation of the cash crop. The Forest Department had an ambitious plan to root out ganja cultivation from the Attappady forests by April 2006. Maoist Presence The ticket counter of the Silent Valley National Park at Mukkali was attacked by a group of Maoists in December, 2014. A big contingent of special police has been deployed there since then, but the growing influence of Maoist groups in tribal east Kerala is of grave concern.Panic grips tribal villages in Silent Valley - The Hindu  References= Further reading  * *Aiyappan A.

The great white shark (bottom) was originally considered the apex predator of the ocean; however, the orca (top) has proved to be a predator of the shark. An apex predator, also known as an alpha predator or top predator, is a predator at the top of a food chain, without natural predators. Apex predators are usually defined in terms of trophic dynamics, meaning that they occupy the highest trophic levels. Food chains are often far shorter on land, usually limited to being secondary consumers ‚Äì for example, wolves prey mostly upon large herbivores (primary consumers), which eat plants (primary producers). The apex predator concept is applied in wildlife management, conservation and ecotourism. Apex predators have a long evolutionary history, dating at least to the Cambrian period when animals such as Anomalocaris dominated the seas. Humans have for many centuries interacted with apex predators including the wolf, birds of prey and cormorants to hunt game animals, birds, and fish respectively. More recently, humans have started interacting with apex predators in new ways. These include interactions via ecotourism, such as with the tiger shark, and through rewilding efforts, such as the proposed reintroduction of the lynx. Ecological roles=Effects on community The great skua is an aerial apex predator, both preying on other seabirds and bullying them for their catches. Apex predators affect prey species' population dynamics and populations of other predators, both in aquatic and in terrestrial ecosystems. Non-native predatory fish, for instance, have sometimes devastated formerly dominant predators. A lake manipulation study found that when the non-native smallmouth bass was removed, lake trout, the suppressed native apex predator, diversified its prey selection and increased its trophic level. As a terrestrial example, the badger, an apex predator, predates on and also competes with the hedgehog, a mesopredator, for food such as insects, small mammals, reptiles, amphibians and the eggs of ground-nesting birds. Removal of badgers (in a trial investigating bovine tuberculosis) caused hedgehog densities to more than double. Predators that exert a top-down control on organisms in their community are often considered keystone species. Humans are not considered apex predators because their diets are typically diverse, although human trophic levels increase with consumption of meat. Effects on ecosystem Apex predators can have profound effects on ecosystems, as the consequences of both controlling prey density and restricting smaller predators, and may be capable of self-regulation. They are central to the functioning of ecosystems, the regulation of disease, and the maintenance of biodiversity. When introduced to subarctic islands, for example, Arctic foxes' predation of seabirds has been shown to turn grassland into tundra. Such wide-ranging effects on lower levels of an ecosystem are termed trophic cascades. The removal of top-level predators, often through human agency, can cause or disrupt trophic cascades. For example, reduction in the population of sperm whales, apex predators with a fractional trophic level of 4.7, by hunting has caused an increase in the population of large squid, trophic level over 4 (carnivores that eat other carnivores). This effect, called mesopredator release, occurs in terrestrial and marine ecosystems; for instance, in North America, the ranges of all apex carnivores have contracted whereas those of 60% of mesopredators have grown in the past two centuries. Conservation The wolf is both an apex predator and a keystone species, affecting its prey's behaviour and the wider ecosystem. Because apex predators have powerful effects on other predators, on herbivores, and on plants, they can be important in nature conservation. Humans have hunted many apex predators close to extinction, but in some parts of the world these predators are now returning. They are increasingly threatened by climate change. For example, the polar bear requires extensive areas of sea ice to hunt its prey, typically seals, but climate change is shrinking the sea ice of the Arctic, forcing polar bears to fast on land for increasingly long periods. Dramatic changes in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem were recorded after the gray wolf, both an apex predator and a keystone species (one with a large effect on its ecosystem), was reintroduced to Yellowstone National Park in 1995 as a conservation measure. Elk, the wolves' primary prey, became less abundant and changed their behavior, freeing riparian zones from constant grazing and allowing willows, aspens and cottonwoods to flourish, creating habitats for beaver, moose and scores of other species.Bystroff, Chris. \\"The wolves of Yellowstone\\" (2006-04-17), p. 2. Retrieved 2010-01-25. In addition to their effect on prey species, the wolves' presence also affected one of the park's vulnerable species, the grizzly bear: emerging from hibernation, having fasted for months, the bears chose to scavenge wolf kills, especially during the autumn as they prepared to hibernate once again. The grizzly bear gives birth during hibernation, so the increased food supply is expected to produce an increase in the numbers of cubs observed. Dozens of other species, including eagles, ravens, magpies, coyotes and black bears have also been documented as scavenging from wolf kills within the park. Human trophic level Humans sometimes live by hunting other animals for food and materials such as fur, sinew, and bone, as in this walrus hunt in the Arctic, but their status as apex predators is debated. Ecologists have debated whether humans are apex predators. For instance, Sylvain Bonhommeau and colleagues argued in 2013 that across the global food web, a fractional human trophic level (HTL) can be calculated as the mean trophic level of every species in the human diet, weighted by the proportion which that species forms in the diet. This analysis gives an average HTL of 2.21, varying between 2.04 (for Burundi, with a 96.7% plant-based diet) and 2.57 (for Iceland, with 50% meat and fish, 50% plants). These values are comparable to those of non-apex predators such as the anchovy or pig. However, Peter D. Roopnarine criticised Bonhommeau's approach in 2014, arguing that humans are apex predators, and that the HTL was based on terrestrial farming where indeed humans have a low trophic level, mainly eating producers (crop plants at level 1) or primary consumers (herbivores at level 2), which as expected places humans at a level slightly above 2. Roopnarine instead calculated the position of humans in two marine ecosystems, a Caribbean coral reef and the Benguela system near South Africa. In these systems, humans mainly eat predatory fish and have a fractional trophic level of 4.65 and 4.5 respectively, which in Roopnarine's view makes those humans apex predators. Evolutionary history Anomalocaris was an apex predator in the Cambrian seas. Apex predators are thought to have existed since at least the Cambrian period, around 500 million years ago. Extinct species cannot be directly determined to be apex predators as their behaviour cannot be observed, and clues to ecological relationships, such as bite marks on bones or shells, do not form a complete picture. However, indirect evidence such as the absence of any discernible predator in an environment is suggestive. Anomalocaris was an aquatic apex predator, in the Cambrian. Its mouthparts are clearly predatory, and there were no larger animals in the seas at that time. Carnivorous theropod dinosaurs including Allosaurus and Tyrannosaurus have been described as apex predators, based on their size, morphology, and dietary needs. A Permian shark, Triodus sessilis, was discovered containing two amphibians (Archegosaurus decheni and Cheliderpeton latirostre), one of which had consumed a fish, Acanthodes bronni, showing that the shark had lived at a trophic level of at least 4. Among more recent fossils, the sabre-tooth cats, like Smilodon, are considered to have been apex predators in the Cenozoic. Interactions with humans boar hunt. In hunting Humans hunted with wolves and in turn with domestic dogs for some 40,000 years; this collaboration may have helped modern humans to outcompete the Neanderthals. Humans still hunt with dogs, which have often been bred as gun dogs to point to, flush out, or retrieve prey. The Portuguese Water Dog was used to drive fish into nets. Several breeds of dog have been used to chase large prey such as deer and wolves. Eagles and falcons, which are apex predators, are used in falconry, hunting birds or mammals. Tethered cormorants, also top predators, have been used to catch fish. In ecotourism Tiger sharks are popular ecotourism subjects, but their ecosystems may be affected by the food provided to attract them. Ecotourism sometimes relies on apex predators to attract business. Tour operators may in consequence decide to intervene in ecosystems, for example by providing food to attract predators to areas that can conveniently be visited. This in turn can have effects on predator population and therefore on the wider ecosystem. As a result, provisioning of species such as the tiger shark is controversial, but its effects are not well established by empirical evidence. Other affected apex predators include big cats and crocodiles. Rewilding The reintroduction of predators like the lynx is attractive to conservationists, but alarming to farmers. In some densely populated areas like the British Isles, all the large native predators like the wolf, bear, wolverine and lynx have become locally extinct, allowing herbivores such as deer to multiply unchecked except by hunting. In 2015, plans were made to reintroduce lynx to the counties of Norfolk, Cumbria, and Northumberland in England, and Aberdeenshire in Scotland as part of the rewilding movement. The reintroduction of large predators is controversial, in part because of concern among farmers for their livestock. Conservationists such as Paul Lister propose instead to allow wolves and bears to hunt their prey in a \\"managed environment\\" on large fenced reserves.

Her novels, giving vivid accounts of Scottish life and presenting sharp views on women's education, remained popular throughout the 19th century. Life Susan Ferrier was the youngest daughter of Helen Coutts (1741‚Äì1797) (daughter of Robert Coutts, a farmer near Montrose) and James Ferrier (1744‚Äì1829), Writer to the Signet and one of the principal clerks of the Court of Session, in which office he was a colleague of Sir Walter Scott. Her father came from Linlithgow. She was probably born at Lady Stair's Close, Edinburgh, as the ninth of ten surviving children. The family moved in 1784 to 11 Retrieved 31 August 2018. (now 25) George Street in the New Town.Corvey 'Adopt an Author': Susan Edmonstone Ferrier Ferrier was privately educated. Through her family she came to know many notable Edinburgh people, including Scott and the novelist Henry Mackenzie. In 1797 her father took her in 1797 to Inveraray, home of his client and patron John Campbell, 5th Duke of Argyll. She became a friend of the family, especially of a granddaughter, Charlotte Clavering (died 1869), with whom she corresponded. Clavering was initially involved in the writing of Ferrier's first novel Marriage, although ultimately her contribution was limited to the section entitled \\"The History of Mrs Douglas\\".Elspeth Yeo's ODNB entry: Retrieved 2 May 2012.

East Morningside House The grave of Susan Ferrier, St Cuthberts Churchyard, Edinburgh Gatepost sign After her mother died, Ferrier kept house for her father, as her three older sisters were married. Like many well-to-do Edinburgh families, they took a house outside the city in the summer, East Morningside House. While there she wrote The Inheritance. She still wished her work to appear anonymously, but her identity was widely known by then. In 1811 Ferrier visited Scott at Ashiestiel Farm and House on the banks of the River Tweed, near Clovenfords in the Scottish Borders, and again in 1829 and 1831 at his new residence, Abbotsford House. They enjoyed each other's company and he wrote of her: \\"This gifted personage besides having great talents has conversation the least exigeant of any author, female at least..., simple, full of humour, and exceedingly ready at repartee, and all this without the least affectation of the blue stocking.\\" He mentioned her in the same sentence as Maria Edgeworth and Frances Burney in 1825.Victoria Chance's dissertation: Retrieved 2 May 2012. Ferrier's account of the visits eventually appeared posthumously in the magazine Temple Bar (1874). Ferrier's own tastes in literature appear in her letters. She admired Jane Austen and Scott (though she had reservations about some works of his), but scorned John Galt and John Gibson Lockhart. The last of several visits to London was paid in 1830 to see an oculist, when she stayed at the villa of Lord Casilis in Isleworth, the model for a house known as Woodlands in Destiny.R.

She died on 5 November 1854 at her brother's house, 38 Albany Street, Edinburgh, and was buried with her family in St Cuthbert's Churchyard. The grave lies on a main dividing wall immediately north of the church. Ferrier's eldest brother married the sister of John Wilson, who wrote under the pseudonym Christopher North.R. Brimley Johnson... p. x. The novels Ferrier wrote three novels. Marriage was written in 1810 but much revised. It was published anonymously in 1818 by the Edinburgh firm of William Blackwood, which paid ¬£150 for it. Its success was remarkable. A French translation appeared in 1825. In 1824 Blackwood was prepared to pay ¬£1000 for the second novel, The Inheritance, which according to 20th-century scholars, \\"mixes sententious moralizing with detailed, wry, caustic observation of the 'thrice-told tale' of factors which make unions happy or unhappy.\\" The third novel, Destiny, was dedicated to Sir Walter Scott, who found that Robert Cadell of Edinburgh was willing to pay ¬£1700 in 1831. In 1841 Ferrier sold the copyrights to the three novels to Richard Bentley, who reissued them in an illustrated edition with authorial revisions. In 1851 this edition was reprinted, with Ferrier's name included for the first time as the author. The library edition of 1881 and 1882 included a Memoir.R. Brimley Johnson..., p. vii.

Zeugma Mosaic Museum contains mosaics from the site, and is one of the largest mosaic museums in the world. History Zeugma was founded as Seleucia by Seleucus I Nicator in the early 3rd century BC on the site where he had the first bridge over the Euphrates built. In 64 BC, the Romans controlled the city. Zeugma was of great importance to the Romans as it was located at a strategically important place. Up to 70'000 people shall have lived in the city, and it became a center for the military and commerce for the Romans. In 253 AD, it was destroyed by the Sassanids, but was later rebuilt. In late antiquity, Zeugma was a diocese, but the place seems to have been abandoned in the 7th century due to Persian and Arab raids. Arabs lived there temporarily in the Middle Ages, and in the 17th century the Turkish village of Belkis was built near the ruins.

As a member of the Conservative Party, Carswell was elected as the MP for Harwich in 2005, and for Clacton in 2010. In August 2014, he changed his political allegiance to UKIP and announced his resignation as an MP. He stood in the subsequent by-election and was returned as a UKIP MP. He stated that he was joining UKIP out of a desire to see \\"fundamental change in British politics\\" and because he believed \\"many of those at the top of the Conservative Party are simply not on our side. They aren't serious about the change that Britain so desperately needs.\\" In 2016, Carswell said that he had \\"jumped ship with the express goal of changing the image of UKIP and ensuring that it was an asset rather than a liability in the referendum campaign‚Ä¶to decontaminate the brand\\".'All Out War', Tim Shipman. William Collins, 2016 p40 He left UKIP on 25 March 2017, to sit as an independent MP. He did not stand at the 2017 general election. Education and early life Carswell is the son of two physicians. He lived in Uganda until his late teens. His father, Wilson Carswell, a respected Scottish doctor and Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons, diagnosed the first confirmed Ugandan cases of HIV/AIDS in the early 1980s, and was one of a number of people engaged in drawing the world's attention to the unfolding pandemic. His father's experiences in Uganda were the inspiration for the character Dr Nicholas Garrigan in Giles Foden's novel The Last King of Scotland. Carswell later attributed his libertarianism to his experiences of the \\"arbitrary rule\\" of Idi Amin. The young Carswell was educated at two independent boarding schools for boys: St Andrews School in Turi in Kenya in East Africa, and Charterhouse in Godalming, Surrey, in southern England, followed by the University of East Anglia (UEA), where he was taught by Edward Acton, and graduated with an upper second-class honours bachelor's degree in history in 1993. He then attended King's College London, receiving a master's degree in British imperial history. Carswell worked as corporate development manager for television broadcasting in Italy from 1997 until 1999, and later for Invesco. Political career At the 2001 general election, Carswell contested Sedgefield, the constituency of Prime Minister Tony Blair, as the Conservative candidate. Blair's majority fell by 7,430 votes with Carswell effecting a swing of 4.7% to the Conservatives compared to 1997, against a national swing of 1.8%. In the months before the 2005 general election, Carswell worked in the Conservative Party's Policy Unit, then run by David Cameron. Member of ParliamentFirst parliamentary term (2005‚Äì10)= Carswell was elected to the House of Commons at the 2005 general election for the constituency of Harwich, defeating Ivan Henderson, the sitting Labour Member of Parliament (MP), by 920 votes. Carswell made his maiden speech on 28 June 2005 in the debate on the Identity Cards Bill. He was a member of Conservative Friends of Israel. Carswell served on the House of Commons' Education Select Committee and the Public Accounts Committee. In 2008, Carswell took part in an Armed Forces Parliamentary Scheme trip to Afghanistan, after which he called for more resources to be allocated to British troops serving there. In December 2009, Carswell tabled a Bill in the House of Commons calling for a public referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union (EU). The Daily Telegraph nominated him a Briton of the Year 2009, and Spectator readers voted him their choice as Parliamentarian of the Year in the same year. In February 2010, he asked Gus O'Donnell to suspend Cabinet meetings held outside London, when it was found that the government was using them to host Labour Party events in marginal seats. =Second parliamentary term (2010‚Äì15)= In the new constituency of Clacton that was created from Harwich at the 2010 general election, Carswell increased his majority over Henderson to 12,068 votes. UKIP decided not to field a candidate against Carswell in the 2010 general election. Instead, the party actively campaigned in support of his re-election in view of his staunch anti-EU views. In the first week of the new parliamentary session of the Conservative-led Government, Carswell revealed he intended to force a referendum on the Treaty of Lisbon, over the need to resolve an oversight of apportionment in the European Parliament by re- ratifying the treaty. Carswell also strongly advocated for electoral reform, including the right for constituents to be able to recall MPs.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORVBeYvHU7w The Recall of MPs Act 2015 later became law. On 28 August 2014, Carswell defected from the Conservatives to UKIP. Although not required to do so, he resigned his seat as an MP, thus triggering a by-election. Less than a month before switching parties, Carswell had approved a letter from Conservative supporter Giles Watling to a local newspaper describing UKIP as a \\"one policy party\\" and saying \\"a vote for Ukip will be a vote for Labour\\". He later said he had been \\"decidedly cool towards the sentiments of the letter.\\" Clacton by-election Following Carswell's resignation, Roger Lord, UKIP's nominated candidate for the 2015 general election, declared that he still wanted to stand, although the UKIP National Executive Committee voted to select Carswell. Two early opinion polls showed Carswell with a substantial lead. He was successful at the by-election on 9 October 2014, with a substantial majority of 12,404 votes over his nearest rival. Carswell later contrasted his willingness to put his switch of parties to the electorate to that of the eleven anti-Brexit MPs who switched to The Independent Group, none of whom held by-elections when changing parties. He noted \\"When I changed parties it didn't occur to me to not hold a by election. If my own electorate weren't supportive, what was the point?\\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-47306022 =Third parliamentary term (2015‚Äì17)= At the 2015 United Kingdom general election, Carswell won the seat of Clacton with a majority of 3,437 ‚Äì down from a majority of 12,404 in the 2014 by-election. Carswell won UKIP's only seat in the general election. Carswell is a Eurosceptic, and supported Vote Leave ‚Äì advocating leaving the EU ‚Äì during the EU referendum in June 2016. In March 2017, Carswell quit UKIP to become an independent MP for Clacton, leaving UKIP with no MPs in Parliament. On quitting the party he said, \\"Now we can be certain that that [Brexit] is going to happen, I have decided that I will be leaving Ukip.\\" On 20 April 2017, following the announcement two days earlier by Prime Minister Theresa May of a snap UK general election, Carswell confirmed he would not be a candidate in the June election. His relationship with then-UKIP party leader Nigel Farage was full of \\"animosity\\" and \\"tension\\"; on several occasions he called for Farage to step down as party leader. Farage called Carswell \\"irrelevant\\" in response to them supporting different campaigns to leave the European Union in the 2016 referendum. In response to Carswell calling for the party leader's resignation, Farage said that Carswell should \\"put up or shut up\\", further saying that \\"either he's going to have to accept that [UKIP is unified] or do something different\\". After Farage's resignation as UKIP leader following the EU referendum, Carswell tweeted a \\"sunshades smiley emoji\\", which some parts of the media described as showing the \\"uneasy relationship\\" between the two men, Carswell later said to the BBC that \\"I tweet smiley faces all the time, I'm very optimistic\\". He also said that while Farage had \\"played a role\\" in the referendum, the resignation was \\"a huge opportunity\\" for the party. This happened a week after Farage suggested that Carswell could be kicked out of the party, saying that \\"We find somebody inside our party who doesn't agree with anything the party stands for, it's a very odd state of affairs\\". Parliamentary expenses scandal After being elected in 2005, Carswell originally designated a ¬£1 million flat in London as his second home, and claimed over ¬£21,000 for food, rent and furniture. In 2007 he began renting a house in Thorpe-le-Soken in Essex, which he designated his second home, and again paid a deposit and for furniture, including a ¬£655 love seat, from his expenses (see Flipping ¬ß Second home flipping). Between 2007 and 2009 he claimed ¬£32,000 in expenses for the house, commenting \\"I believe this is entirely justified\\". Following an investigation of the expenses of all MPs, Carswell was ordered to repay ¬£2,159 in expenses.https://www.lowestoftjournal.co.uk/news/mps-to-repay-more-than-1m-in- expenses-1-515800 Influence in the Conservative Party Conservative Party commentator and Daily Telegraph columnist Charles Moore credits Carswell, together with MEP Daniel Hannan, as the architects behind the idea of a Great Repeal Bill, as well as the concept of a \\"Contract with Britain\\" offered during the election, the \\"recall\\" of MPs who have displeased their constituents, open primaries for the selection of parliamentary candidates, and plans for elected police commissioners. According to Moore's analysis not only is \\"The localism of the Carswell/Hannan \\"direct democracy\\" movement is now good Coalition orthodoxy\\", but Cameron's policy guru, Steve Hilton, \\"enthusiastically lifted several bits of The Plan\\", the best-selling moderniser book written by Carswell and co-author Daniel Hannan. Even before the formation of the Coalition, the influence of Carswell's ideas was evident in speeches made by David Cameron ‚Äì including a speech to the Open University made by Cameron in Milton Keynes in May 2009. Influence on UKIP and Leave New Statesman commentator Stephen Bush has argued that Carswell was correct to recognise that a successful Brexit campaign depended on its messages being associated with people other than Farage, but also observed that there \\"is no electoral majority to be found in Britain for the libertarian brand of conservatism that Carswell espouses\\". Bush also suggested that Carswell's ability to win his seat owed more to the appeal of his party to Clacton's voters than his own personal influence, observing that \\"the evidence suggests that he has kept his seat thanks to the popularity of the party leaders he has consistently undermined and worked against\\". During his time as a UKIP MP, Carswell, along with Mark Reckless and Stephen Crowther, established UKIP Parliamentary Resource Unit Limited. After politics Carswell co-founded Disruptive, a data analytics company.https://www.disruptiveanalytica.com/about Companies House filings show that Carswell resigned as a Director on 10 April 2019.https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/11030575/officers In popular culture Carswell was portrayed by actor Simon Paisley Day in the 2019 HBO- and Channel 4-produced drama Brexit: The Uncivil War. Personal life Carswell and his wife Clementine have a daughter. Carswell's recreations include gardening, swimming, running, blogging, riding and making quince jelly.

RKC has a 26-acre (105,000 m¬≤) campus in Rajkot. History K S Ranjitsinhji played for the English cricket team K S Ranjitsinhji & the English cricket team The foundation stone of Rajkumar College was laid in 1868. The institution was designed by Colonel Keatinge and was formally opened by the Governor of Bombay, H. B. Sir Seymour Fitzgerald, in 1870. The college was founded for the education of the princely order by the princes and chiefs of Kathiawad for their sons and relations. In 1938, on the initiative of its founding members, the college became a public school (private school in American terms). The college is a founding member of the Indian Public Schools Conference and a member of the Round Square conference of schools, a worldwide association of more than 60 schools that allows students to travel between schools and tour the country or do community service. In 2001 the college opened its doors to girls, in what has been a boys' bastion for over a century. The school has around 50 girls, with boarding facilities. Another endeavor of the Rajkumar College Administration has been Priyalok Villas, a pre-school program for the kids; originally housed in a 1909 Hyde sanatorium but now housed in a different building. Whilst having its own domain, it has access to all the facilities of the Rajkumar College. The school is expanding.

As a Lieutenant Colonel he commanded the historic Pointe du Hoc battle during the Invasion of Normandy. He also commanded the US Troops at the Battle of the H√ºrtgen Forest and led a series of delaying actions and ambushes during the Battle of the Bulge. General Rudder also at various times served as Texas Land Commissioner, the 16th president of Texas A&M; University, third president of the Texas A&M; University System, mayor of Brady, Texas, and a high school and college teacher and coach. Military career Texas historical marker in the German observation bunker at Pointe du Hoc After graduation from Texas A&M;, Rudder had been commissioned a second lieutenant of infantry in the United States Organized Reserve Corps. After being called into active duty in 1941, Rudder took part in the D-Day landings as commanding officer of the United States Army's 2nd Ranger Battalion. His U.S. Army Rangers stormed the beach at Pointe du Hoc, scaling 100-foot (30-meter) cliffs under enemy fire to reach and destroy a German gun battery. The battalion's casualty rate for this perilous mission was greater than 50%. Rudder himself was wounded twice during the course of the fighting. Though there was fierce resistance the Germans had removed the main armament from Pointe du Hoc in April 1944, and secretly constructed Maisy battery as the main heavy artillery position in the sector which was left operational. In spite of this Rudder ordered his men to dig in and they fought off German counterattacks for two days until relieved.Gal Perl Finkel, 75 years from that long day in Normandy ‚Äì we still have something to learn, The Jerusalem Post, June 12, 2019. His men and he helped to successfully establish a beachhead for the Allied forces. The siege was replicated in the 1962 epic film The Longest Day. Seven months later, Rudder was reassigned in the middle of an assault to the 109th Infantry Regiment, which saw key service in the Battle of the Bulge. Rudder earned military honors including the Distinguished Service Cross, Bronze Star with Oak Leaf Cluster, Purple Heart with Oak Leaf Cluster, French Legion of Honor with Croix de Guerre and Palm, and Order of Leopold (Belgium) with Croix de Guerre and Palm. He was a full colonel by the war's end and was promoted to brigadier general of the United States Army Reserve in 1954 and major general in 1957. Political and academic career Rudder's statue on the Texas A&M; University campus in College Station, Texas Rudder served as mayor of Brady, Texas, for six years from 1946‚Äì52. In 1953, he became vice president of Brady Aviation Company. On January 1, 1955, he assumed the office of Texas Land Commissioner after James Bascom Giles abandoned the position. At that time, the Veterans Land Program was under scrutiny for mismanagement and corruption. Rudder undertook the task of reforming policies, expediting land applications, and closely supervising proper accounting procedures. He also oversaw the proper leasing of state lands by employing more field inspectors for oil and gas sites and adding a seismic exploration staff. In addition, he improved working conditions for his staff and instigated a program to preserve the many deteriorating General Land Office documents. Rudder won the 1956 state land commissioner election as a Democrat. He became vice president of Texas A&M; University in 1958 and was named its president in 1959. He was president of the entire A&M; System from 1965 until his death in 1970. In 1967, President Lyndon B. Johnson presented him with the Army Distinguished Service Medal, the Army's highest peacetime service award. Since his death in 1970, an annual service has been held in Normandy, France, in his honor. While president of Texas A&M;, Rudder is credited for transforming it from a small, all-male land-grant college to the renowned university of today. Specifically, he made membership in the Corps of Cadets optional, allowed women to attend, and led efforts to integrate the campus. While the changes were hugely unpopular to the former students (it has been said only a president with Rudder's heroic military record could pull off such drastic changes), there is no doubt these changes freed Texas A&M; to become the fourth-largest university in the United States. Many reminders of Rudder are on campus, including Rudder Tower, next to the Memorial Student Center. A special training unit within the Corps of Cadets known as \\"Rudder's Rangers\\" is named in his honor. Cadets within the Corps of Cadets at A&M; are expected to be able to recite an excerpt from the inscription on Rudder tower, a \\"Campusology\\" that reads: Death Rudder died on March 23, 1970, after suffering a cerebral hemorrhage.

The Planetarium produced more than 250 shows, was visited by nearly six million spectators and made more than 58,000 presentations in both French and English. The Planetarium was one of Montreal's most popular tourist attractions. Closure of the Dow Planetarium On October 10, 2011, the Dow Planetarium presented its final show. The city-owned building has since been ceded to the √âcole de technologie sup√©rieure, a major engineering school which is located nearby. The Rio Tinto Alcan Planetarium opened in April 2013 as the successor to the Montreal Planetarium. It is located near the Olympic Stadium and the Biodome. The new installation has two separate theatres as well as exhibits on space and astronomy. The building is certified LEED Platinum.

The host city is usually one with an established pride event or a significant LGBTI community. For up to a month, numerous sporting, artistic and human rights events are staged throughout the host city. EuroPride usually culminates during a weekend with a traditional Mardi Gras-style pride parade, live music, human rights conference, special club nights, and an AIDS memorial vigil.  History  Europride Madrid July 2007 World Pride 2000 in Rome EuroPride was inaugurated in London in 1992, attended by estimated crowds of over 100,000. The following year, Berlin hosted the festivities. When Amsterdam hosted EuroPride in 1994, it turned into a financial disaster, leaving debts of approximately 450,000 euros. In 1996, EuroPride moved to Copenhagen, where it enjoyed strong support from city leaders. The organisers were successful on all fronts but not able to achieve a financial surplus. Lady Gaga at Rome Europride 2011Paris hosted EuroPride in 1997. The festival had numerous commercial sponsors and was widely hailed as a success. During the parade, over 300,000 people marched to the Bastille. Stockholm was the host city in 1998. London was to host EuroPride again in 1999, but the event was canceled when the organisers went bankrupt. In 2000, WorldPride took place for the first time and, as has happened each time since, when WorldPride is in Europe, no separate EuroPride takes place. The event took place in Rome and was well-attended by LGBTI people from all over the world. After initially supporting the event, city leaders pulled their support just days before due to pressure exerted by the Vatican, which was organising its Great Jubilee. Vienna hosted the 2001 EuroPride, drawing large crowds from Central Europe. In 2002, K√∂ln (Cologne), Germany, held the then-biggest ever EuroPride; officials estimated crowds to number well over one million. EuroPride was hosted by Manchester in 2003, and Hamburg in 2004. Oslo hosted it in 2005, with Ian McKellen as the guest of honour. London hosted the event in 2006, organising a two-week festival culminating in a parade on the final day (1 July) in which marchers were invited to walk down Oxford Street, one of the city's busiest shopping streets, the first time they had been legally allowed to do so. The parade was attended by Mayor of London Ken Livingstone, Conservative MP Alan Duncan, human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell, and the first transgender MEP, Italian Vladimir Luxuria. Following the parade, events were held in three of the capital's squares: a rally in Trafalgar Square addressed by Ian McKellen, and entertainment in Leicester and Soho Squares. EuroPride 2006 marked the first time that London's main pride rally and entertainment areas were staged within the city itself, rather than in open parks. In 2007, Madrid hosted EuroPride, which took place in Chueca, the capital's gay village, during the last week in June. Madrid was chosen because of the gay marriage and gender identity laws Spain had passed during the previous two years. More than 1.2 million people attended the final parade as it passed through the downtown streets of Alcal√°, and Gran V√≠a, ending up at Plaza de Espa√±a. For the first time, Madrid City Hall contributed financing to the MADO (Madrid Orgullo) organisation. In addition, a private event, the Infinitamentegay Party, took place in Casa de Campo Park. In 2008, the Stockholm Pride organization organised EuroPride for a second time, held from 25 June to 3 August in Stockholm, a decade after hosting EuroPride 1998. Zurich hosted EuroPride in 2009 with a month-long roster of events from 2 May to 7 June, culminating in a parade through downtown Zurich on 6 June. The 2010 event was held in Warsaw, Poland. Organisers prepared multifaceted events between July 9 to 18. The Parade took place on July 17. It marked the first time this pan-European LGBT celebration took place in a former communist country. The Warsaw EuroPride formulated, as its main theme, a demand for legalisation of same sex civil partnerships. In 2011, EuroPride returned to Rome. Hosted by Claudia Gerini, the parade closed with a performance and a speech by Lady Gaga at the Circus Maximus. That year one million people took part. The 2013 EuroPride was in Marseille, France from July 10‚Äì20, focusing on gay marriage in France and celebrated the biggest gay wedding in Europe EuroPride in Riga in 2015 The 2016 EuroPride returned to Amsterdam. UK singer/songwriter Tara McDonald sang her single \\"I Need A Miracle\\" which was chosen as the EuroPride anthem and was remixed by Gregor Salto. There was no EuroPride in 2017 as WorldPride took place in Madrid. In June 2019, President of Austria Alexander Van der Bellen became the first Head of State to address a EuroPride parade.  World Pride  The European Pride Organisers Association, which licences EuroPride and owns the trademark, has decided that a World Pride event held in Europe also automatically carries the title of EuroPride. The first World Pride was held in Rome in 2000 (see above). The second WorldPride was held in Jerusalem in 2005-2006. London, also hosting the 2012 Summer Olympics, beat out competing candidate, Stockholm, in the fall of 2008 to hold World Pride 2012, which was held from 23 June to 8 July. WorldPride 2017 was held in Madrid, and WorldPride 2021 will be held in Copenhagen, Denmark.  Madrid success  Madrid's EuroPride 2007 was the most well-attended ever, with an estimated 2.5 million visitors. This huge attendance was not only a success for Madrid, but for the whole LGBT Spanish community, due to the celebration of the change of terms in the laws related to gay marriage and adoptions. Madrid was one of the first Spanish cities celebrating the legalization of gay marriage, with the support of all political parties, even the conservatives in the Government, headed by the ex-mayor of the city, Alberto Ru√≠z Gallard√≥n from Partido Popular. Due to these and other advances in same-sex freedom and social progress, Madrid was chosen in 2012 to host WorldPride 2017.

It owns the EuroPride trademark and licenses its use to one Pride organisation each year. EPOA is a small organisation with eight elected board members, all of whom serve with Pride organisations in Europe. It has no paid staff, and has its headquarters in Brussels, Belgium. The board meets several times each year, often holding a meeting in a city holding its Pride event that weekend. Any Pride organisation can become a member of EPOA upon payment of a membership fee. This gives the organisation voting rights at the Annual General Meeting, including on votes on future EuroPride bids. Membership to EPOA automatically makes a Pride a member of InterPride, its international equivalent. EPOA has more than 60 members across Europe. The current President of EPOA is Latvian human rights activist, Kristine Garina.

He has been the Member of Parliament for Kettering since the 2005 general election. Early life Hollobone was born on 7 November 1964 in Bromley, Kent. He was privately educated at Dulwich College, where he was a contemporary of former UKIP leader Nigel Farage. He went on to study at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford where he was awarded a BA degree in Modern History and Economics. He was a prominent member of the Oxford University branch of the Monday Club - a 'hard right' pressure group that was later disassociated from the Conservative Party over its policies, such as the voluntary repatriation of ethnic minorities. In 1984, he worked as a voluntary teacher in Honduras with a Baptist mission. He worked for various companies as an industry research analyst and investment banker between 1987 and 2003 and was in the Territorial Army between 1987 and 1995. Political career His elected political career began in the London Borough of Bromley, where he served as a councillor for the Martins Hill & Town ward between 1990 and 1994, when he did not stand again and the Liberal Democrat candidate won his former seat. He unsuccessfully contested Lewisham East at the 1997 General Election where he was defeated by the sitting Labour MP Bridget Prentice by 12,127 votes. In 1998 he sought re-election to the London Borough of Bromley in his former ward, but was defeated by the Liberal Democrats.London Borough of Bromley He was later selected as the Conservative candidate for the marginal Northamptonshire constituency of Kettering for the 2001 general election; he lost to incumbent Labour MP Phil Sawford by 665 votes. Following his defeat, Hollobone moved to Kettering and secured election in 2003 to Kettering Borough Council‚Äîfirst representing the rural ward of Buccleuch, before representing the suburban ward of Piper's Hill from 2007. He also became Vice Chairman of the Kettering Conservative Constituency Association in 2002. He was re-elected as a councillor in 2011, but did not re-stand in 2015. Hollobone secured election to the House of Commons at his third attempt, during the 2005 general election, defeating Phil Sawford by 3,301 votes. He made his maiden speech on 24 May 2005. Some of his subsequent speeches were not well received. In 2006, he was one of three new MPs specifically mentioned in an article in The Times about manipulating the performance figures for the Theyworkforyou website. The article claimed new MPs boosted \\"their ratings on the internet by saying very little, very often\\". Whilst Hollobone's frequent \\"speeches\\" might give the appearance of \\"Churchill or Gladstone\\", many were interventions of only two or three sentences. In response, Hollobone said that as a new MP he tried to speak as often as possible on behalf of constituents and take part in many different debates. Hollobone was rated as the Conservatives' most rebellious MP in 2010. He stated that his job is to \\"represent constituents in Westminster, it's not to represent Westminster in the constituency\\". He has attempted to reintroduce national service. His private member's bill on capital punishment received its first reading in the House of Commons on 24 June 2013, but was withdrawn, and so did not receive a second reading. Similarly, his Young Offenders (Parental Responsibility) Bill, Foreign National Offenders (Exclusion from the United Kingdom) Bill, Fishing Grounds and Territorial Waters (Repatriation) Bill, Asylum Seekers (Return to Nearest Safe Country) Bill, BBC Licence Fee (Civil Debt) Bill and Equality and Diversity (Reform) Bill, all due for second reading on 28 February 2014, were all withdrawn. His European Communities Act 1972 (Repeal) Bill failed to progress to a vote. He was re-elected at the 2010 general election, 2015 general election and 2017 general election. In March 2015, Hollobone was criticised by The Independent for being one of just 4 MPs who voted against a Bill to increase the powers of the House of Lords to penalise peers who had broken the law and expel the worst offenders. This followed an expenses scandal relating to the former peer Lord Hanningfield. Hollobone argued the act could be used to discriminate against older male peers. In January 2016, the Labour Party unsuccessfully proposed an amendment in Parliament that would have required private landlords to make their homes \\"fit for human habitation\\". According to Parliament's register of interests, Hollobone was one of 72 Conservative MPs who voted against the amendment who personally derived an income from renting out property. The Conservative Government had responded to the amendment that they believed homes should be fit for human habitation but did not want to pass the new law that would explicitly require it. In February 2018, following the announcement that Northamptonshire County Council had brought in a \\"section 114\\" notice, putting it in special measures following a crises in its finances, Hollobone was one of seven local MPs who released a statement arguing that the problems with the authority were down to mismanagement from the Conservative councillors who led it rather than funding cuts from the Conservative Government. They further argued that government commissioners should take over the running of the Council. In March 2018, he joined three other Conservative backbench MPs in \\"talking out\\" a bill by Green Party MP Caroline Lucas, which aimed to reverse moves to privatise the NHS. By filibustering for three-and-a-half hours, Lucas was left with just 17 minutes to present her bill, which was subsequently shelved without a vote.NHS Reinstatement Bill: Tory MPs filibuster debate by talking about deporting foreigners for hours. The Independent. Published 11 March 2016. Retrieved 1 November 2017. In Parliament he serves on the Panel of Chairs, for which he receives an annual payment of ¬£15,000 (in addition to his MP's salary of ¬£77,379). He has previously been a member of the Transport Committee and the Backbench Business Committee. Political views Hollobone is regarded as being on the right wing of the Conservative Party, and is a member of the socially conservative Cornerstone Group. He has advocated the privatisation of both the NHS and the BBC and policies such as bringing back capital punishment and military conscription. In 2013, Hollobone was one of four MPs who camped outside Parliament in a move to facilitate parliamentary debate on what they called an \\"Alternative Queen‚Äôs Speech\\" ‚Äì an attempt to show what a future Conservative government might deliver. Some 42 policies were listed including reintroduction of the death penalty and conscription, privatising the BBC, banning the burka in public places and preparation to leave the European Union. Hollobone was a supporter of the Better Off Out campaign, which campaigned for Britain's withdrawal from the EU. The Eurosceptic United Kingdom Independence Party did not field a candidate against Hollobone in the 2010 general election and subsequently campaigned for his re-election as a result of his Eurosceptic views. Hollobone continued to deny speculation that he would be the most likely MP to follow Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless in defecting to UKIP and remained a Conservative MP. UKIP did not field a candidate against him again in the 2017 general election. Burqas In February 2010, Hollobone described the wearing of burqas as like \\"going round wearing a paper bag over your head\\" and expressed his \\"huge sympathy\\" with those calling for a ban on the garments. He went on to say that he would refuse to speak with constituents wearing burkas if they came to see him, although he did not cite any examples of where this had happened in the past and he was told he would face legal action if he was to do so. On 30 June 2010, Hollobone introduced the Face Coverings (Regulation) Bill, which would regulate the use of certain facial coverings, including the burka, in public. However, his bill did not progress further towards adoption. Expenses In April 2009, Hollobone was reported to be the thriftiest Member of Parliament in terms of expenses: the average MP claimed ¬£144,176 whereas Hollobone's expenses bill amounted to ¬£47,737. In response to a written question by Hollobone, the expenses claimed for public duties by former Prime Ministers after they had left office was revealed to the public.http://news.sky.com/home/politics/article/16098067 In November 2017, Hollobone was reported to be the MP who had benefited from the largest sum of expenses that he was not entitled to, but had not been forced to pay the money back. The unjustified claim of ¬£17,000 was written off because the expenses watchdog admitted that it should have picked up on the error earlier. Personal life He married Donna Cooksey in St John's church, Cranford in June 2001. They had a son named Thomas in June 2004 and a daughter named Emily in 2006 and lived in Barton Seagrave. They separated in 2012 and divorced in 2013. Hollobone has played occasionally for Kettering Rugby Football Club in the past and served as a special constable with British Transport Police for six years until asked to resign in 2015 due to new rules about police officers taking part in politics.\\"MPs asked to leave Special Constabulary\\", Police Oracle, 13 January 2015 ReferencesExternal links * * Profile at the Conservative Party * Guardian Unlimited Politics - Ask Aristotle: Philip Hollobone MP * Category:1964 births Category:Alumni of Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford Category:British Parachute Regiment soldiers Category:Conservative Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies Category:Councillors in Northamptonshire Category:Councillors in the London Borough of Bromley Category:British critics of Islam Category:Islamic clothing controversy in Europe Category:Living people Category:People educated at Dulwich College Category:UK MPs 2005‚Äì2010 Category:UK MPs 2010‚Äì2015 Category:UK MPs 2015‚Äì2017 Category:UK MPs 2017‚Äì2019 Category:UK MPs 2019‚Äì Category:Members of the Freedom Association Category:British special constables Category:People from Barton Seagrave ","title":"Philip Hollobone"},{"id":"1872807","text":"Samuel Sydney Silverman (8 October 1895 ‚Äì 9 February 1968) was a British Labour politician and vocal opponent of capital punishment. Early life Silverman was born in poverty to a migrant Jewish parents from Jassy, Romania. His father was a draper living in the Kensington Fields area of Liverpool. Silverman attended Liverpool Institute and the University of Liverpool, thanks to scholarships. During the First World War he was a conscientious objector to military service and served three prison sentences, in Preston, Wormwood Scrubs and Belfast prisons. Career Silverman was a lecturer in English at the National University of Finland from 1921 to 1925, and then returned to the University of Liverpool to teach and read law. After qualifying as a solicitor he worked on workmen's compensation claims and landlord-tenant disputes. From 1932 to 1938 Silverman served on Liverpool City Council. He contested Liverpool Exchange without success at a by-election in 1933, but was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Nelson and Colne in the general election in 1935. The Riegner Telegram, addressed to Sydney Silverman in August 1942, was one of the first pieces of evidence of the implementation of the Final Solution by the Nazis. Silverman was prominent in his support for Jews worldwide and for their rights in Palestine. He rethought his pacifism in light of the reports of antisemitism in Europe, and reluctantly supported Britain's entry into the Second World War. He was vocal in asking from the government (and Churchill in particular) for a statement of war aims, which had become a contentious issue in the early years of the war. Silverman was prominent within the debates over the potential repatriation of Jewish refugees, telling Churchill 'that it would be difficult to conceive of a more cruel procedure than to take people who have lost everything they have ‚Äì their homes, their relatives, their children, all the things that make life decent and possible ‚Äì and compel them against their will, to go back to the scene of those crimes'.Anthony Grenville. Jewish Refugees from Germany and Austria in Britain, 1933-1970: Their Image in AJR Information.(London: Mitchell, 2010) 58 Silverman was widely expected to join the government after the Labour victory in the general election in 1945, but, as he was a leftist, he was not appointed by Clement Attlee. He became opposed to the government's foreign policy. He refused to support German rearmament in 1954 and had the Labour Party Whip withdrawn from November 1954 to April 1955. He was one of the founders of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. In 1961, as a protest against bipartisan support for British nuclear weapons, he voted against the Royal Air Force, Royal Navy and British Army estimates in the House of Commons, and was suspended from the Labour Party Whip from March 1961 until May 1963. Silverman died on 9 February 1968 following a stroke. Opponent of capital punishment A fervent opponent of the death penalty, Silverman founded the National Campaign for the Abolition of Capital Punishment. He wrote about several miscarriages of justice in the 1940s and 1950s, such as the hanging of Timothy Evans when it later emerged that serial killer John Christie had murdered Evans's wife and had given perjured evidence at Evans's trial in 1949. Silverman proposed a private member's bill on abolition of the death penalty, which was passed by 200 votes to 98 on a free vote in the House of Commons on 28 June 1956; but was defeated in the House of Lords. In 1965, he successfully piloted the Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Bill through Parliament, abolishing capital punishment for murder in the UK and in the British Armed Forces for a period of five years but with provision for abolition to be made permanent by affirmative resolutions of both Houses of Parliament before the end of that period. The appropriate resolutions were passed in 1969. Silverman was opposed at the 1966 general election in the Nelson and Colne constituency by Patrick Downey, the uncle of Lesley Anne Downey, a victim in the Moors murders case, who stood on an explicitly pro- hanging platform. Downey polled over 5,000 votes, 13.7%, then the largest vote for a genuinely independent candidate since 1945.

Since 2005, he has been the Member of Parliament (MP) for the Ludlow constituency in Shropshire. He has been a farmer since 1987, at his family's farm just over the county boundary in Herefordshire, at Leintwardine near Ludlow, and was elected in 2001 as a councillor on the South Shropshire District Council, of which he was the Conservative leader in 2003‚Äì2005. He was also secretary of the Ludlow Conservative Association for a year in 2001. Background Philip Dunne was born in Ludlow, Shropshire, and has an ancestry of politicians and courtiers. He is the son of Sir Thomas Dunne KG, the former Lord Lieutenant of Herefordshire and Worcestershire, who in turn is the son of Philip Russell Rendel Dunne (who briefly sat in the Commons), who in turn was the son of Edward Marten Dunne (who also sat in the Commons). Philip Dunne was educated at Abberley Hall School, followed by Eton College and Keble College, Oxford, where he was awarded a degree in Philosophy, Politics and Economics. At Oxford he was part of the Bullingdon Club.

The duchy lay left of the Rhine river between the Electorate of Cologne in the east and the Duchy of Limburg in the west. It had territories on both sides of the river Rur, around its capital J√ºlich ‚Äì the former Roman Iuliacum ‚Äì in the lower Rhineland. The duchy amalgamated with the County of Berg beyond the Rhine in 1423, and from then on also became known as J√ºlich-Berg. Its territory lies in present-day Germany (part of North Rhine-Westphalia) and in the present-day Netherlands (part of the Limburg province), its population sharing the same Limburgish dialect. History Nideggen Castle In the 9th century a certain Matfried was count of J√ºlich (pagus Juliacensis). The first count in the gau of J√ºlich in Lower Lorraine, Gerhard I, was mentioned in 1003; his grandson Gerhard III began to call himself Count of J√ºlich in 1081. William IV, who became count in 1219, significantly enlarged the territory and in 1234 granted J√ºlich town privileges, provoking the Cologne Archbishop Konrad von Hochstaden, whose troops devastated the city five years later. William IV's son Walram (Count from 1278 to 1297) remained a fierce opponent of the Bishopric, supporting Duke John I of Brabant at the 1288 Battle of Worringen against Archbishop Siegfried II of Westerburg. Though Walram's younger brother Count Gerhard V had sided with German king Adolf of Nassau against his rival Albert I of Habsburg, he managed to retain his territories after Adolf of Nassau lost the Battle of G√∂llheim in 1298, and in 1314 supported the coronation of Louis IV of Wittelsbach at the nearby City of Aachen, once more against the will of the Cologne bishop. The long-time conflict came to an end when Gerhard's younger son Walram became Archbishop of Cologne in 1332. His elder brother Count William V in 1336 received the title of a margrave from Emperor Louis IV, and in 1356 Emperor Charles IV of Luxembourg raised William V to the rank of duke. His son Duke William II, however, became entangled in a fierce feud with the Emperor's half-brother Wenceslaus of Luxembourg, Duke of Brabant, whom he defeated at the Battle of Baesweiler in 1371. Thereafter J√ºlich's history became closely intertwined with that of its neighbours: the Duchies of Cleves and Berg as well as Guelders and the County of Mark: Duke William II had married Mary, the daughter of Duke Reginald II of Guelders, and duchess herself after the death of her half-brother Reginald III of Guelders in 1371. William II settled the conflict with the Imperial House of Luxembourg and his son William III inherited both duchies. When in 1423 however his younger brother Rainald died without heirs, the Gelderland estates chose Arnold of Egmond as duke, while J√ºlich amalgamated with Berg and passed to Adolf, Duke of J√ºlich-Berg, who belonged to a younger branch, and who had obtained Berg by virtue of the marriage of one of his ancestors. In 1511 Duke John III of Cleves inherited J√ºlich and Berg through marriage with Maria of J√ºlich-Berg, the daughter of the last Duke, William IV. She inherited her father's estates: J√ºlich and Berg with the County of Ravensberg. From 1521 J√ºlich-Berg and Cleves formed the United Duchies of J√ºlich-Cleves-Berg in a personal union under Duke John III. When the last duke of J√ºlich-Cleves-Berg died without direct heirs in 1609, the War of the J√ºlich succession broke out. It ended with the 1614 Treaty of Xanten, which divided the separate duchies between Palatinate-Neuburg and the Margraviate of Brandenburg. J√ºlich and Berg fell to Count Palatine Wolfgang William of Neuburg and after the last duke of Palatinate-Neuburg (also Elector of the Palatinate from 1685) Charles III Philip had died without issue in 1742, Count Charles Theodore of Palatinate- Sulzbach (after 1777 also Duke of Bavaria) inherited J√ºlich and Berg. In 1794 Revolutionary France occupied the Duchy of J√ºlich (Duch√© de Juliers), which became part of the French d√©partement of the Roer. The Treaty of Lun√©ville in 1801 officially acknowledged the cession of J√ºlich to France. In 1815, following the defeat of Napoleon, the duchy became part of the Prussian Province of J√ºlich-Cleves-Berg (after 1822 part of the Prussian Rhine Province), except for the cities Sittard and Tegelen, which became part of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands.

According to Guardian journalist Kira Cochrane it was the greatest challenge to women's abortion rights in nearly 20 years. Dorries' amendment was defeated by 332 votes to 190, with a separate 22-week limit opposed by 304 votes to 233. A majority of MPs continued to support the 24-week limit. She said of her tactics on this issue in 2007: \\"If I were to argue that all abortions should be banned, the ethical discussions would go round in circles ... My view is that the only way forward is to argue for a reduction in the time limit ... it‚Äôs every baby‚Äôs right to have a life.\\" Channel 4 documentary In May 2008, Dorries featured in the Channel 4 Dispatches documentary \\"In God's Name\\". The programme examined the growing influence of Christian evangelical movements in the UK and highlighted the Lawyers' Christian Fellowship's involvement in lobbying the British Government on issues such as abortion, gay rights and the enforcing of laws relating to blasphemy. The programme included footage of a LCF representative meeting with Dorries to influence policy on matters where they had a common agenda. Damian McBride email affair In April 2009, Dorries stated that she had commenced legal action following the leaked publication of emails sent by Damian McBride, Prime Minister Gordon Brown's head of strategy and planning, which suggested spreading a rumour that Dorries had a one-night stand with a fellow MP, in an email to Derek Draper, a Labour-supporting blogger. McBride resigned and Dorries denounced the accusation as libellous: \\"[t]he allegations regarding myself are 100 per cent untrue\\",Nadine Dorries \\"I have become accustomed to the grubby world of British politics.

The newspaper also queried hotel bills including one for 'Mr N Dorries': these had been disallowed by the Fees Office and Dorries said they were submitted by mistake. On 22 May 2009, she spoke on BBC Radio 4 and drew parallels between the McCarthy 'Witch-Hunts' and the press's 'drip-drip' revelation of MP's expenses, eliciting David Cameron's public criticism. She said everyone was fearing a 'suicide', and colleagues were constantly checking up on each other.\\"MP's fears of expenses 'suicide'\\" , BBC News, 22 May 2009. Later in the day her blog was taken down. It transpired that Withers, lawyers acting for the Barclay Brothers, the owners of the Daily Telegraph, had required the removal of the blog, on threat of libel action against the service provider.Gaby Hinsliff, Telegraph lawyers shut down Tory MP's blog , The Guardian. (23 May 2009). In January 2010, it was reported that Dorries was being investigated by John Lyon, the parliamentary commissioner for standards, regarding her claim for second home expenses. There was some debate as to the location of her main home. It was also reported that Dorries had claimed ¬£20,000 in office expenses for work undertaken by a media relations and public affairs company. High heels at work In late 2009, Dorries campaigned against what she called \\"a proposal to ban the wearing of high heels in the office\\" which was to be debated at the 2009 Trades Union Congress (TUC). The motion, submitted to the TUC by the Society of Chiropodists and Podiatrists, pointed out that \\"around two million days a year are lost through sickness as a result of lower limb disorders\\" and that \\"many employers in the retail sector force women workers to wear high heels as part of their dress code\\". It did not call for a ban on high heels at work, but rather called on employers to consider the health impact of their dress codes and encourage the wearing of healthy, comfortable shoes. Criticism of Speaker Bercow Prior to John Bercow's election as Speaker of the House of Commons in June 2009, Dorries accused him of opportunism and disloyalty to the Conservative Party and questioned his mental stability. She described his election as \\"a two-fingered salute to the British people from Labour MPs, and to the Conservative Party\\". After Bercow's wife, Sally, was approved as a Labour parliamentary candidate and gave an interview about her personal life, Dorries argued that the Bercows were damaging the historic respect accorded to the office of Speaker. Benefit claimants In February 2010 Dorries took part in the Channel 4 documentary series Tower Block of Commons, in which MPs stay with welfare claimants. In October 2010, Dorries suggested that benefit claimants who made more than 35,000 postings on Twitter should be reported to the Department for Work and Pensions.

Bercow and Dorries' new expenses issues She was reportedly part of a plot to oust John Bercow from the Speaker's chair in the run up to the 2010 general election, and, after the election, sent an email to all new MPs advocating his removal.The email is cited by Peter Hoskin \\"Nadine Dorries' Kill Bercow email\\", The Spectator (blog), 18 May 2010 On 9 May 2010, two days after retaining the Mid Bedfordshire seat at the general election, The Sunday Times reported that Dorries was facing the first complaint about an MP's expenses claim of the new parliament. The newspaper reported that she had claimed around ¬£10,000 for an annual report in 2007 on her performance as an MP, but that her former Commons researcher had never seen the report or worked on it. Dorries insisted that she had indeed published the report, placing a photograph of it on her blog.The Blog of Nadine Dorries. Post entitled 2007, posted Saturday, 24 April 2010 at 16:39.

Three days later, The Sunday Times reported that police had since handed a file to the Crown Prosecution Service for consideration. In February 2013, it was reported that Dorries was being investigated by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority over her expenses, although no specific details were given at this time.

Election court petition On 29 May 2015, the independent candidate in Mid Bedfordshire, Tim Ireland, lodged an appeal against the result accusing Dorries of breaches of section 106 of the Representation of the People Act 1983 by making false statements about his character. The development first emerged in early-June after the three-week petition for such an action had expired. The petition was rejected by the High Court of Justice because it was served at Dorries' constituency office and not her home address. EU Customs Union Buzzfeed reported that in October 2017 Dorries had become confused about her party's position on Brexit after talking with a politics teacher about a key element of her party's position, Britain's proposed exit from the European Union Customs Union. The EU Customs Union is an agreement between EU members not to impose tariffs (i.e. import taxes) on goods passing across their mutual borders. From a semi-private discussion that Buzzfeed made public, it was suggested that Dorries believed the UK could leave the EU but stay within the customs union whilst at the same time negotiating free trade deals with other countries. Later in December 2017 she tweeted: \\"If we stay in the single market and the customs union, we haven't left.\\" Parliament of 2017‚Äì2019=Burka ban In August 2018, Boris Johnson was criticised for a column that he had written in the Daily Telegraph. As part of an article discussing the introduction of a burka ban in Denmark, Johnson said that Muslim women who wore burkas \\"look like letter boxes\\" and the garment gave them the appearance of \\"bank robbers\\", although the point of the article was to condemn governments who tell 'a free-born adult woman what she may or may not wear, in a public place, when she is simply minding her own business'. Dorries, however, said that Johnson \\"did not go far enough\\", saying the burka should have no place in Britain and it was \\"shameful that countries like France and Denmark are way ahead of us on this\\". On 7 August 2018, Dorries tweeted \\"No woman in a liberal, progressive society should be forced to cover up her beauty or her bruises.\\" Brexit In November 2018, Dorries, who was strongly in favour of Brexit, said of the Withdrawal Agreement negotiated between the UK Government and the EU27: \\"This is a very sad place to be, but unfortunately, the future of the country and of our relationship with Europe is at stake.

As a carrier of the virus, it was revealed she could have infected the guests of an International Women's Day event that took place on 3 March at Downing Street and, on 6 March, she held surgery attended by 12 people, whose details were later passed on to the National Health Service. Promotion to Minister of State In May 2020, Dorries was promoted to the ministerial rank of Minister of State. On 14 May 2020, Dorries was criticised after she retweeted a doctored video from a far-right Twitter account which falsely claimed that Labour leader Keir Starmer obstructed the prosecution of grooming gangs while he served as Director of Public Prosecutions.

(Less commonly, the term \\"zero ring\\" is used to refer to any rng of square zero, i.e., a rng in which for all x and y. This article refers to the one-element ring.) In the category of rings, the zero ring is the terminal object, whereas the ring of integers Z is the initial object. Definition The zero ring, denoted {0} or simply 0, consists of the one-element set {0} with the operations + and ¬∑ defined such that 0 + 0 = 0 and 0 ¬∑ 0 = 0. Properties * The zero ring is the unique ring in which the additive identity 0 and multiplicative identity 1 coincide.Artin, p. 347.Lang, p. 83. (Proof: If in a ring R, then for all r in R, we have .) * The zero ring is also denoted Z1. * The zero ring is commutative. * The element 0 in the zero ring is a unit, serving as its own multiplicative inverse. * The unit group of the zero ring is the trivial group {0}. * The element 0 in the zero ring is not a zero divisor. * The only ideal in the zero ring is the zero ideal {0}, which is also the unit ideal, equal to the whole ring. This ideal is neither maximal nor prime. * The zero ring is not a field; this agrees with the fact that its zero ideal is not maximal. In fact, there is no field with fewer than 2 elements. (When mathematicians speak of the \\"field with one element\\", they are referring to a non-existent object, and their intention is to define the category that would be the category of schemes over this object if it existed.) * The zero ring is not an integral domain.Lam, p. 3. Whether the zero ring is considered to be a domain at all is a matter of convention, but there are two advantages to considering it not to be a domain. First, this agrees with the definition that a domain is a ring in which 0 is the only zero divisor (in particular, 0 is required to be a zero divisor, which fails in the zero ring). Second, this way, for a positive integer n, the ring Z/nZ (or Zn, which is isomorphic to Z/nZ) is a domain if and only if n is prime, but 1 is not prime. * For each ring A, there is a unique ring homomorphism from A to the zero ring. Thus the zero ring is a terminal object in the category of rings.Hartshorne, p. 80. * If A is a nonzero ring, then there is no ring homomorphism from the zero ring to A. In particular, the zero ring is not a subring of any nonzero ring.Hartshorne, p. 80. * The zero ring is by definition the unique ring with the characteristic 1. * The only module for the zero ring is the zero module. It is free of rank ◊ê for any cardinal number ◊ê. * The zero ring is not a local ring. It is, however, a semilocal ring. * The zero ring is Artinian and (therefore) Noetherian. * The spectrum of the zero ring is the empty scheme.Hartshorne, p. 80. * The Krull dimension of the zero ring is ‚àí‚àû. * The zero ring is semisimple but not simple. * The zero ring is not a central simple algebra over any field. * The total quotient ring of the zero ring is itself. Constructions * For any ring A and ideal I of A, the quotient A/I is the zero ring if and only if I = A, i.e. if and only if I is the unit ideal. * For any commutative ring A and multiplicative set S in A, the localization S‚àí1A is the zero ring if and only if S contains 0. * If A is any ring, then the ring M0(A) of 0 √ó 0 matrices over A is the zero ring. * The direct product of an empty collection of rings is the zero ring. * The endomorphism ring of the trivial group is the zero ring. * The ring of continuous real-valued functions on the empty topological space is the zero ring.

An example of a performative contradiction is the statement \\"I am dead\\" because the very act of proposing it presupposes the actor is alive.  Usage in philosophy  Solipsism is often held to be a performative contradiction if stated. If not stated it is usually considered an example of the normative application of qui tacet consentire videtur (He who remains silent seems to consent). J√ºrgen Habermas and related philosophers point out that statements spoken during justificatory argumentation carry additional presuppositions and so certain statements are performative contradictions in this context. Habermas claims that post-modernism's epistemological relativism suffers from a performative contradiction. Hans-Hermann Hoppe claims in his theory of argumentation ethics that arguing against self-ownership results in a performative contradiction. Jaakko Hintikka more rigorously fleshed out the notion of performative contradiction in analyzing Descartes' famous cogito ergo sum argument, concluding that cogito ergo sum relies on performance rather than logical inference.

In 1962, the song was released as a single by Bennett on Columbia Records as the b-side to \\"Once Upon a Time,\\" peaked at #19 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, and was also included on the album I Left My Heart in San Francisco. It also reached number seven on the Easy Listening chart. The song is one of the official anthems for the city of San Francisco. In 2018, it was selected for preservation in the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or artistically significant.\\" Background The music was written by George Cory, with lyrics by Douglass Cross, about two amateur writers nostalgic for San Francisco after moving to New York. Although the song was originally written for Claramae Turner, who often used it as an encore, she never got around to recording it. The song found its way to Tony Bennett through Ralph Sharon, Bennett's longtime accompanist and friends with the composers. Sharon brought the music along when he and Bennett were on tour and on their way to San Francisco's Fairmont Hotel. Prior to Tony Bennett hearing it, the song was pitched to Tennessee Ernie Ford, whom Claramae Turner suggested Cross take it to. Ford turned the song down. In December 1961, in the famous \\"Venetian Room\\" at the Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco, Tony Bennett first sang \\"I Left My Heart in San Francisco\\". In the audience that night were San Francisco mayor George Christopher and future mayor Joseph L. Alioto. From the 1960s through the 1980s, at San Francisco's premier supper club the \\"Venetian Room,\\" Bennett sang the city song. Recording history Bennett first recorded the song at the CBS 30th Street Studio on January 23, 1962; CBS released it as the b-side of \\"Once Upon A Time.\\" The A-side received no attention, and DJs began flipping the record over and playing \\"San Francisco.\\"Gary Mamorstein. The Label: The Story of Columbia Records. New York\\": Thunder's Mouth Press, 2007. p. 375. It became a hit on the pop singles chart in 1962 and spent close to a year on various other charts, achieving gold record status. It then won the top prize of Grammy Award for Record of the Year, as well as for Best Male Solo Vocal Performance. Legacy In 2001 \\"I Left My Heart in San Francisco\\" was ranked 23rd on an RIAA/NEA list of the most historically significant Songs of the 20th Century. It has often been performed in public by Bennett in concert as well as on special occasions. A statue of Tony Bennett was unveiled outside the Fairmont Hotel on 19 August 2016, in honor of his 90th birthday, the hotel performance, and the song's history with San Francisco. The Songwriters Hall of Fame gave Bennett the \\"Towering Performance Award\\" for his vocal rendition of the song. Rhythm and blues singer Bobby Womack released a version on Minit Records which peaked at #48 on the Billboard R&B; chart in 1969. On May 15, 1984, the song was adopted by the City and County of San Francisco as one of its two official anthems, the other being the title song from the 1936 film San Francisco (1936 film). The San Francisco Giants play the song after each victory at their home field, Oracle Park. Bennett has performed the song live at multiple Giants games, including the first game at Oracle (then called Pacific Bell Park) in 1993 and before games in the 2002 and 2010 World Series. At noon (PDT) on Saturday, April 25, 2020, in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic and the shelter-in- place orders for people across the United States, San Franciscan residents sang I Left My Heart in San Francisco in unison from their residences and other places of sheltering as a tribute to the spirit of the city and its fight to keep the virus in check. Tony Bennett led the sing-along.

The articles also broaden the aim of the movement, explaining the common bond among Remodernist filmmakers being a search for truth, knowledge, authenticity and spirituality in their work, but having different approaches on achieving that goal.

For many centuries the vestries were the sole de facto local government and presided over local, communal fundraising and expenditure until the mid or late 19th century with local Established Church chairmanship. More punitive matters tended to be dealt with by the manorial court and hundred court during the epoch of the vestries. Their initial power derived from custom and was very occasionally ratified by the common law or asserted in statute such as the Elizabethan Poor Law. At the high point of their powers before removal of Poor Law responsibilities in 1834, the vestries spent not far short of one-fifth of the budget of the British government which derived much of its income from global trade and imperialism. Secular and ecclesiastical aspects of the vestries were separated, for all areas where they had not earlier been, under a reforming statute of 1894. Their secular duties have been performed in England since then by parish councils or more superior councils, leaving their ecclesiastical duties to the Church of England where they have been performed by parochial church councils (PCCs) since 1921. Realised secularisation of local government was opposed by administrations of the Tory Party preceding the Third Salisbury ministry, the British government led by Lord Salisbury from 1895 to 1900 and several earlier influential High Whigs. A public right in the PCC (church) meeting remains in that all Members of an overlapping civil parish can speak at their annual meetings (which may appoint churchwardens for instance). A right to tax by a PCC for church chancel repairs remains as to liable (apportioned) local residents and businesses across an apportioned area of many church parishes, in the form of chancel repair liability however in some tithes were replaced by no further such taxation. The term vestry remains in use outside of England and Wales to refer to the elected governing body and legal representative of a parish church, for example in the Scottish and American Episcopal Churches. Vestry committees in England and Wales Notice dated April 1843 (which would have been pinned to the church doorParish Notices Act 1837) calling a meeting of the select vestry of the parish of St Bees, for rating and assessing property in the parish to raise money for the repair of the church and the provision of ornaments and other necessary goods for the coming year. It is signed by the Rev R P Buddicom, vicar of St Bees, and three of the four churchwardens The vestry was a meeting of the parish ratepayers chaired by the incumbent of the parish, originally held in the parish church or its vestry, from which it got its name.The Companion to British History. Charles Arnold- Baker, 2nd edition 2001, Routledge. The vestry committees were not established by any law, but they evolved independently in each parish according to local needs from their roots in medieval parochial governance. By the late 17th century they had become, along with the county magistrates, the rulers of rural England.Parish Government 1894-1994. KP Poole & Bryan Keith-Lucas. National Association of Local Councils 1994 In England, until the 19th century, the parish vestry committee equated to today's parochial church councils plus all local government responsible for secular local business, which is now the responsibility of a District Council as well as in some areas a Civil Parish Council, and other activities, such as administering locally the poor law. Parish chest in St Mary's Church, Kempley, Gloucestershire. Origins The original unit of settlement among the Anglo-Saxons in England was the tun or town. The inhabitants met to carry out this business in the town moot or meeting, at which they empowered or tasked men with various positions and the common law would be promulgated. Later with the rise of the shire, the township would send its reeve and four best men to represent it in the courts of the hundred and shire. However, township independence in the Saxon system was lost to the feudal manorial court leet which replaced the town meeting. Assembly of parishes rested on land ownership, so increasingly the manorial system, with parishes assembled by lords of the manor in concert with local clergy and religious institutions by serving via a new church a manor, or more than one manor plus commons, barren land (waste) and land set aside for church benefit as rectory or vicarage lands (glebelands). Initially, the manor was the principal unit of local administration, common customs and justice in the rural economy, but over time the church replaced the manorial court as to key elements of rural life and improvement -- it levied its local tax on produce, tithes. Much subinfeudation, division of manors and a new mercantile middle class had widely eroded the old feudal model by the early Tudor period and which changes nationally accelerated with the Reformation in the 1530s seeing the sequestration of religious houses and the greatest estates of the church, but also under Mary I and others a turning to the parish system to attend to social and economic needs. These changes transformed participation in the township or parish meeting, which dealt with an increasing variety of civil and ecclesiastical demands, needs and projects. This new meeting was supervised by the parish priest (vicar/rector/curate), probably the best educated of the inhabitants, and became generally dubbed the vestry meeting. Growth of power As the complexity of rural society increased, the vestry meetings pragmatically acquired greater responsibilities, and were given the power to grant or deny payments from parish funds. Although the vestry committees were not established by any law, and had come into being in an unregulated ad-hoc process, it was highly convenient to allow them to develop. This was convenient when they were the obvious body for administering the Edwardian and Elizabethan systems for support of the poor on a parochial basis. This was their first, and for many centuries their principal, statutory power. With this gradual formalisation of civil responsibilities, the ecclesiastical parishes acquired a dual nature and could be classed as both civil and ecclesiastical parishes. In England, until the 19th century, the parish vestry was in effect what would today usually be called a parochial church council, but was also responsible for all the secular parish business now dealt with by civil bodies, such as parish councils. Eventually, the vestry assumed a variety of tasks. It became responsible for appointing parish officials, such as the parish clerk, overseers of the poor, sextons and scavengers, constables and nightwatchmen. At the high point of their powers, just prior to removal of Poor Law responsibilities in 1834, the vestries spent not far short of one-fifth of the budget of the national government itself.. More than 15,600 ecclesiastical parish vestries looked after their own: churches and burial grounds, parish cottages and workhouses, endowed charities, market crosses, pumps, pounds, whipping posts, stocks, cages, watch houses, weights and scales, clocks and fire engines. Or to put it another way: the maintenance of the church and its services, the keeping of the peace, the repression of vagrancy, the relief of destitution, the mending of roads, the suppression of nuisances, the destruction of vermin, the furnishing of soldiers and sailors, even to some extent the enforcement of religious and moral discipline. These were among the multitudinous duties imposed on the parish and its officers, that is to say the vestry and its organisation, by the law of the land, and by local custom and practice as the situation demanded. This level of activity had resulted in an increasing sophistication of administration. The decisions and accounts of the vestry committee would be administered by the parish clerk, and records of parish business would be stored in a \\"parish chest\\" kept in the church and provided for security with three different locks, the individual keys to which would be held by such as the parish priest and churchwardens. Select vestry Satirical cartoon of the select vestry of St. Paul's, Covent Garden. Thomas Jones 1828 Whilst the vestry was a general meeting of all inhabitant rate-paying householders in a parish,. in the 17th century the huge growth of population in some parishes, mostly urban, made it increasingly difficult to convene and conduct meetings. Consequently, in some of these a new body, the select vestry, was created. This was an administrative committee of selected parishioners whose members generally had a property qualification and who were recruited largely by co-option. This took responsibility from the community at large and improved efficiency, but over time tended to lead to governance by a self-perpetuating elite. This committee was also known as the \\"close vestry\\", whilst the term \\"open vestry\\" was used for the meeting of all ratepayers. By the late 17th century, the existence of a number of autocratic and corrupt select vestries had become a national scandal, and several bills were introduced to parliament in the 1690s, but none became acts. There was continual agitation for reform, and in 1698 to keep the debate alive the House of Lords insisted that a bill to reform the select vestries, the Select Vestries Bill, would always be the first item of business of the Lords in a new parliament until a reform bill was passed. The First Reading of the bill was made annually, but every year it never got any further. This continues to this day as an archaic custom in the Lords to assert the independence from the Crown, even though the select vestries have long been abolished. Decline A plaque commemorating an 1897 bridge building initiative in London. George Bernard Shaw was elected to the St Pancras vestry in 1897. It became the Metropolitan Borough of St Pancras in 1900. A major responsibility of the vestry had been the administration of the Poor Law, but the widespread unemployment following the Napoleonic Wars overwhelmed the vestries, and under the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834 this duty was transferred to elected boards of guardians for single parishes or to poor law unions for larger areas. These new bodies now received the poor law levy and administered the system, and removed a large portion of the income of the vestry and a significant part of its duties. The vestries escaped the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, which brought more democratic and open processes to municipal bodies, but there was gradual movement to separate the vestry's ecclesiastical and secular duties. The Vestries Act 1850 prevented the holding of meeting in churches, and in London, vestries were incorporated under the Metropolis Management Act 1855 to create properly regulated civil bodies for London parishes, but they did not have any ecclesiastical duties. As the 19th century progressed the parish vestry progressively lost its secular duties to the increasing number of local boards which came into being and operated across greater areas than single parishes for a specific purpose. These were able to levy their own rate. Among these were the local boards of health created under the Public Health Act 1848, the Burial boards, which took over responsibility for secular burials in 1853, and the Sanitary Districts which were established in 1875. The church rate ceased to be levied in many parishes and was made voluntary in 1868.Arnold-Baker on Local Council Administration, 1989 However, the proliferation of these local bodies led to a confusing fragmentation of local government responsibilities, and this became a driver for large scale reform in local government, which resulted in the Local Government Act 1894. The problem of so many local bodies was expressed by H H Fowler, President of the Local Government Board, who said in the parliamentary debate for the 1894 Act.... Under the Act, secular and ecclesiastical duties were finally separated when a system of elected rural parish councils and urban district councils was introduced. This removed all secular matters from the parish vestries, and created parish councils or parish meetings to manage these. The parish vestries were left with only church affairs to manage. Residual ecclesiastical use  Following the removal of civil powers in 1894, the vestry meetings continued to administer church matters in Church of England parishes until the Parochial Church Councils (Powers) Measure 1921 Act established parochial church councils as their successors. \\\\- Parochial Church Councils Measure 1921 Since then, the only remnant of the vestry meeting has been the meeting of parishioners, which is convened annually solely for the election of churchwardens of the ecclesiastical parish. This is sometime referred to as the \\"annual vestry meeting\\". All other roles of the vestry meetings are now undertaken by parochial church councils. The term vestry continues to be used in some other denominations, denoting a body of lay members elected by the congregation to run the business of a church parish. This is the case in the ScottishThe vestry duties in the Scottish Episcopal Church, and the American Episcopal Churches, and in Anglican ecclesiastical provinces such as Australia and New Zealand. In the American Episcopal church, vestry members are generally elected annually and serve as the legal representatives of the church . Within the Church of Ireland the term \\"select vestry\\" is used to describe the members of the parish who are elected to conduct the affairs of the parish.

Such corrections typically become important when a significant number of electrons reach speeds greater than 0.86c (Lorentz factor \\\\gamma=2). Such plasmas may be created either by heating a gas to very high temperatures or by the impact of a high-energy particle beam. A relativistic plasma with a thermal distribution function has temperatures greater than around 260 keV, or 3.0 GK (5.5 billion degrees Fahrenheit), where approximately 10% of the electrons have \\\\gamma > 2. Since these temperatures are so high, most relativistic plasmas are small and brief, and are often the result of a relativistic beam impacting some target. (More mundanely, \\"relativistic plasma\\" might denote a normal, cold plasma moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light relative to the observer.) Relativistic plasmas may result when two particle beams collide at speeds comparable to the speed of light, and in the cores of supernovae. Plasmas hot enough for particles other than electrons to be relativistic are even more rare, since other particles are more massive and thus require more energy to accelerate to a significant fraction of the speed of light. (About 10% of protons would have \\\\gamma > 2 at a temperature of 481 MeV - 5.6 TK.) Still higher energies are necessary to achieve a quark‚Äìgluon plasma. The primary changes in a plasma's behavior as it approaches the relativistic regime is slight modifications to the equations which describe a non-relativistic plasma and to collision and interaction cross sections. The equations may also need modifications to account for pair production of electron-positron pairs (or other particles at the highest temperatures). A plasma double layer with a large potential drop and layer separation, may accelerate electrons to relativistic velocities, and produce synchrotron radiation.

Corrington and John William Corrington. Made on a low budget, the film is loose adaptation of Sister of the Road, a pseudo-autobiographical account of the fictional character Bertha Thompson, written by Ben L. Reitman. It was Scorsese's second feature film. Plot The film tells the story of Boxcar Bertha Thompson and \\"Big\\" Bill Shelly, two train robbers and lovers who are caught up in the plight of railroad workers in the American South. When Bertha is implicated in the murder of a wealthy gambler, the pair become fugitives. Cast *Barbara Hershey as Boxcar Bertha *David Carradine as Big Bill Shelly *Barry Primus as Rake Brown *Bernie Casey as Von Morton *John Carradine as H. Buckram Sartoris *Harry Northup as Harvey Hall *Victor Argo as First McIver Production After the success of Bloody Mama, Roger Corman wanted to make another female gangster film. Julie Corman researched female gangsters and came across the story of Boxcar Bertha. Martin Scorsese was hired to direct on the strength of his first feature. He was given the lead actors, including Barbara Hershey, David Carradine, and Barry Primus, and a shooting schedule of 24 days in Arkansas.Chris Nashawaty, Crab Monsters, Teenage Cavemen and Candy Stripe Nurses - Roger Corman: King of the B Movie, Abrams, 2013 p 120 The Reader Railroad was used for the train scenes. The locomotive in those scenes was 1920 Baldwin 2-6-2 #108, who later saw service on the Conway Scenic Railroad in the late 1970s. The engine is currently at the Blacklands Railroad yard in Sulphur Springs, Texas, awaiting restoration. Locomotive #1702, a USATC S160 2-8-0 built by Baldwin in 1942, was also seen in the film as well. The locomotive is now operational at the Great Smoky Mountains Railroad. Scorsese makes a cameo in the film as one of Bertha's clients during the brothel montage.Gary A. Smith, The American International Pictures Video Guide, McFarland 2009 p 33 Hershey later called the film \\"a lot of fun even though it's terribly crippled by Roger Corman and the violence and sex. But between the actors and Marty Scorsese the director, we had a lot of fun. We really had characters down but one tends to not see all that, because you end up seeing all the blood and sex.\\" Reception Boxcar Bertha received mixed reviews from critics. It holds an approval rating of 52% on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes based on 23 reviews, with an average rating of 5/10. The website's critical consensus says, \\"Too derivative of other Roger Corman crime pictures to stand out, Boxcar Bertha feels more like a training exercise for a fledgling Martin Scorsese than a fully formed picture in its own right.\\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three stars out of four and called it \\"a weirdly interesting movie [...] Director Martin Scorsese has gone for mood and atmosphere more than for action, and his violence is always blunt and unpleasant ‚Äî never liberating and exhilarating, as the New Violence is supposed to be.

Worries about family illnesses contributed to his interest in Galton's ideas of \\"hereditary improvement\\" (which would later be called Eugenics). He continued to help with the work of Downe parish church and associated village amenities, despite problems with control being seized by a new High Church vicar, and he remained on good terms with the Church's patron, the Revd. John Brodie Innes. There was continuing interest in Charles Darwin's views on religion, but he remained reticent. Despite repeated problems and delays caused by Charles Darwin's illness, his work on evolution-related experiments and investigations continued, with the production of books on the movement of climbing plants, insectivorous plants, the effects of cross and self fertilisation of plants, different forms of flowers on plants of the same species, and The Power of Movement in Plants. His ideas on evolution were increasingly accepted in scientific circles despite some bitter disputes, and he received numerous honours. As well as writing out his own autobiography for his family, he wrote an introduction to a biography of his grandfather Erasmus Darwin. In his last book, he returned to the effect earthworms have on soil formation. He died in Downe, Kent, England, on 19 April 1882. He had expected to be buried in St Mary's churchyard at Downe, but at the request of Darwin's colleagues, William Spottiswoode (President of the Royal Society) arranged for Darwin to be given a major ceremonial funeral and buried in Westminster Abbey, close to John Herschel and Isaac Newton. Background In the aftermath of the publication of On the Origin of Species through Natural Selection in 1859, Charles Darwin's allies Charles Lyell, Joseph Dalton Hooker, Thomas Huxley, Alfred Russel Wallace and Asa Gray in America worked to spread acceptance of its ideas despite difficulty in coming to terms with natural selection and man's descent from animals. Darwin's research and experiments on plants and animals continued, and his extensive writings countered the arguments against evolution, particularly those put by the Duke of Argyll and St George Mivart. Family matters, eugenics Darwin's sons George and Horace were ill and arrived home at Christmas 1872 for nursing. Darwin turned from his insectivorous plants to a more leisurely update of his monograph on climbing plants. He was intrigued by Galton's latest \\"hereditary improvement\\" ideas (which would be called Eugenics after 1883), proposing that society should breed out mental and physical disability and improve the nation's stock by introducing \\"a sentiment of caste among those who are naturally gifted\\". Families would be registered and incentives offered so that the best children chosen from each \\"superior family\\" would marry and reproduce. Darwin, aware that of his brood only William had good health, had already dismissed the aims as too \\"utopian\\" in the Descent of Man. He thought these new proposals impractical if voluntary and politically horrifying if enforced by compulsory registration, even were they the \\"sole feasible\\" way of \\"improving the human race\\". He felt it better simply to publicise the \\"all-important principle of inheritance\\" and let people pursue the \\"grand\\" objective for themselves. In any case it was too late for his own infirm offspring. Huxley was also ill, needing a rest and harried by a neighbour suing over a damp basement. The X Club (a dining club formed in November 1864 to support the evolutionary \\"new reformation\\" in naturalism, including Huxley, Hooker, John Tyndall, Busk, Spencer, and Spottiswoode) raised a ¬£2,000 collection for him, primed by Darwin with ¬£300. Darwin's spirits were again downcast when Lyell's wife died. In June 1873 Darwin resumed work on his insectivorous plants, with some distractions as his wife Emma took care of the seven Huxley children while Huxley and Hooker went on holiday to the continent. Having young children in the house was like the 1850s again. Parish conflict A new reforming High Church vicar, the Revd. George Sketchley Ffinden, had been imposing his ideas since taking over the parish in November 1871. Darwin had to write to the patron, John Brodie Innes, explaining what had upset the parishioners. Ffinden now usurped control of the village school which had been run for years by a committee of Darwin, Lubbock and the incumbent priest, with a \\"conscience clause\\" which protected the children from Anglican indoctrination. Ffinden began lessons on the Thirty-nine Articles of the Anglican faith, an unwelcome move from the point of view of the Baptists in the village. Darwin withdrew from the committee and cut his annual donation to the church, but continued with the Friendly Society work. Hensleigh Wedgwood's daughter Effie had married Thomas \\"Theta\\" Farrer in May, and on 5 August 1873 the Darwins went to visit them for a few days. They arrived to hear that a fortnight previously the Farrer's servants had been called to an accident. Earl Granville's riding companion Samuel Wilberforce had been killed in a fall from his horse, and was subsequently laid out in state for two days in the Farrer's drawing room. Although an opponent of the Origin, Wilberforce had always thought Darwin a \\"capital fellow\\". Pause At home, a heated discussion with Hooker ended with Darwin lying in bed with his memory gone and \\"a severe shock continually passing through my brain\\". Emma feared an epileptic fit, but the doctor put him on a diet and in September he returned to work on insectivorous plants. His correspondence continued, funding worthy projects and acknowledging countless gifts including Das Kapital from \\"a sincere admirer\\", Karl Marx, which Darwin had difficulty in following, but hoped that both their efforts towards \\"the extension of knowledge... [would] add to the happiness of mankind\\". Frank struggled with his medical studies, and after finishing his thesis on animal tissues he was to assist with plant tissues at Downe. George's legal career had been ended by stomach illness and he had spent two years going to spas. He began writing topical essays, the first in the Contemporary Review on Galton. His latest essay boldly dismissed prayer, divine morals and \\"future rewards & punishments\\". Darwin urged him not to publish it for some months, and \\"to pause, pause, pause.\\" Fiske During a visit in November 1873 the Harvard philosopher John Fiske amused the X Club with his story of a cockney in New York warning him \\"What, that 'orrid hold hinfidel 'Uxley? Why, we don't think hanythink of 'im in Hingland! We think 'e's 'orrid!\\", himself writing that \\"I am quite wild over Huxley... what a pleasure to meet such a clean-cut mind! It is like Saladin's sword which cut through the cushion.\\" and \\"Old Darwin is the dearest, sweetest, loveliest old grandpa that ever was. And on the whole he impresses me with his strength more than any man I have seen yet. There is a charming kind of quiet strength about him and about everything he does. He isn't burning and eager like Huxley. He has a mild blue eye, and is the gentlest of gentle old fellows. [His] long white hair and enormous white beard [made him] very picturesque... guileless simplicity... I am afraid I shall never see him again, for his health is very bad. Of all my days in England I prize today the most.\\" New edition of The Descent of Man Darwin tackled a new edition of the Descent of Man, and offered the self-financing Wallace the work of assisting him. Wallace quoted seven shillings an hour, mentioning that he was \\"dipping into politics\\" proposing nationalisation of coal mining. Emma found out and had the task given to their son George, so Darwin had to write apologetically to Wallace, adding \\"I hope to Heaven that politics will not replace natural science.\\" Parish reading room For two years, Emma had organised a winter reading room in the local school for local labourers, who subscribed a penny a week to smoke and play games, with \\"Respectable newspapers & a few books... & a respectable housekeeper..there every evening to maintain decorum.\\" This was a common facility to save men from \\"resorting to the public house\\". In 1873 the Revd. Ffinden opposed it, as \\"Coffee drinking, bagatelle & other games\\" had been allowed and \\"the effects of tobacco smoke & spitting\\" were seen when the children returned in the morning. Emma got Darwin to get the approval of the education inspectorate in London, and just before Christmas 1873 the Darwins and Lubbocks got the agreement of the school committee, offering to pay for any repairs needed \\"to afford every possible opportunity to the working class for self improvement & amusement\\". A furious Ffinden huffed that it was \\"quite out of order\\" for the Darwins to have gone to the inspectorate behind his back. In the autumn of 1874 Darwin let off steam at Ffinden and formally resigned from the school committee on health grounds. Spiritualism Francis Galton was attracted to the recent spiritualism movement. On a visit to London in January 1874 Darwin attended a s√©ance at Erasmus's house with relatives including Hensleigh Wedgwood, as well as Huxley. George had hired the medium Charles Williams, and they sat round the table in the dark, but as the room grew stuffy Darwin went upstairs to lie down, missing the show, with sparks, sounds and the table rising above their heads. While Galton thought it a \\"good s√©ance\\", Darwin later wrote \\"The Lord have mercy on us all, if we have to believe such rubbish\\" and told Emma that it was \\"all imposture\\" and \\"it would take an enormous weight of evidence\\" to convince him otherwise. At a second s√©ance Huxley and George found that Williams was nothing but a cheat, to Darwin's relief. Emma told Hensleigh's daughter Snow that Charles \\"won't believe it, he dislikes the thought of it so much\\". Snow remembered that her uncle \\"used to look upon it as a great weakness if one allowed wish to influence belief\\" and when Emma said that \\"he does not always act up to his principles\\" Snow thought that was \\"what one means by bigotry\\", to which Emma said \\"Oh yes, he is a regular bigot\\". New edition of Descent Darwin continued painfully rewriting his books with the help of Henrietta and George, incorporating ideas from Galton and new anecdotes. He bought from Lubbock the Sandwalk he had been renting for years, but the price seemed excessive and affected their friendship. News of a dispute involving the removal of George Bentham from presidency of the Linnean Society, allegedly spurred on by Owen, led Darwin to write \\"What a demon on earth Owen is. I do hate him\\". With Huxley's assistance he updated the Descent on ape-brain inheritance, which Huxley thought \\"pounds the enemy into a jelly... though none but anatomists\\" would know it. The manuscript was completed in April 1874, and the publisher John Murray planned a 12 shilling half-price edition to replicate the success of the cheap revision of the Origin. Darwin left the proofs to George, and turned again to Plants. The new edition was published on 13 November with the price cut to the bone at 9 shillings. Insectivorous plants Figure 1 from Insectivorous Plants. During 1874 Darwin contacted many of his old friends to assist with experimentation on insectivorous or carnivorous plants. Helpers included Hooker and his assistant William Thiselton-Dyer at Kew, John Burdon- Sanderson at University College London running lab tests on the plant's digestion, and Asa Gray at Harvard. Enquiries to Nature magazine brought in sacks of mail to be dealt with by Frank, who settled into Brodie Innes's old house in the village and married Amy Ruck on 23 July. At this time the family was joined by George Romanes who had been a student with Frank at Cambridge. Plants experimented on were members of the genera Drosera and Pinguicula, including D. rotundifolia and P. vulgaris. Controversy with Mivart As well as working on the proofs, George Darwin made a statistical analysis of first cousin marriages (three times more frequent in \\"our rank\\" than in the lower) and, influenced by Galton, published an article on \\"beneficial restrictions in marriage\\". Mivart attacked this anonymously in the Quarterly Review, misinterpreting advocacy of divorce in cases of criminality or advice as \\" the most oppressive laws, and the encouragement of vice in order to check population\\", talking of \\"hideous sexual criminality\\". A furious Darwin told George to take legal advice while he contacted the publisher of his books and the Quarterly, John Murray, threatening to \\"take his business elsewhere\\". Darwin's holiday at Southampton with William was overshadowed as he drafted George's response. John Tyndall's address to the British Association later that month laid claim to \\"wrest from theology the entire domain of cosmological theory\\" and led to calls for his prosecution for blasphemy. Lyell, now nearly blind and in deteriorating health, wrote to Darwin applauding the boost to \\"you and your theory of evolution\\" despite his qualms about the hereafter. Darwin was sympathetic, but did \\"not feel any innate conviction\\" of life after death. The October issue of the Quarterly carried George's response and an \\"apology\\" from Mivart which still maintained \\"that the doctrines... are most dangerous and pernicious\\" and infuriated Darwin. On 13 November Hooker's wife Fanny died suddenly, and a devastated Hooker felt unable to return home after the funeral and brought his family to Downe. Emma looked after the children, and when Hooker returned to Kew, Darwin urged \\"hard work\\" to overcome his \\"utter desolation\\". Later, Darwin mentioned the Mivart argument and Hooker rallied the X Club (a dining club formed in November 1864 to support the evolutionary \\"new reformation\\" in naturalism, including Huxley, Hooker, John Tyndall, Busk, Spencer, and Spottiswoode). Huxley eagerly used a review to attack \\"anonymous slander\\", telling Darwin that he \\"ought to be like one of the blessed gods of Elysium, and let the inferior deities do battle with the infernal powers.\\" Mivart confidentially pleaded to make amends, but Huxley told Darwin that the \\"most effectual punishment\\" was to \\"give him the cold shoulder\\". Darwin was itching to speak his mind, and when no apology had come by 12 January 1875 he wrote vowing never to communicate with Mivart again. Insectivorous Plants, parish and vivisection Darwin struggled on, by February 1875 telling George that \\"I know full well the feeling of life being objectless & all being vanity of vanities\\", and Hooker that he was even \\"ready to commit suicide\\". The death of Lyell on 22 February had him feeling \\"as if we were all soon to go\\". Their friendship had cooled after Lyell declined to back natural selection, and Darwin pleaded illness rather than take part as a pall-bearer at the funeral in Westminster Abbey. In March Darwin took the proofs of Insectivorous Plants to Murray. For a year the vicar had refused to speak to any of the Darwins, and when two evening lectures were proposed for the village, Lubbock had to act as an intermediary in requesting use of the schoolroom. The committee agreed, but Ffinden refused to co- operate, writing that \\"I had long been aware of the harmful tendencies to revealed religion of Mr. Darwin's views, but.. I had fully determined.. not to let my difference of opinion interfere with a friendly feeling as neighbours, trusting that God's grace might in time bring one so highly gifted intellectually and morally to a better mind.\\" Darwin was equally haughty in return, condescending that \\"If Mr. F bows to Mrs D. and myself, we will return it\\". He found that dealing with Mivart and Ffinden was increasing his private hostility to Christianity. Darwin's daughter Henrietta at first supported a petition drawn up by Frances Power Cobbe demanding anti-vivisection legislation. Though Darwin was an animal lover and had never carried out vivisection, he persuaded her that \\"Physiology can only progress by experiments on living animals\\". During his spring break in London he took the matter up with his contacts, at first thinking of a counter-petition, then on Huxley's advice seeking support lobbying for a pre-emptive bill to provide for regulated vivisection with what he called a \\"more humanitarian aspect\\". The hint to the fox-hunting houses of parliament that a ban could lead to further restrictions helped, and though Cobbe's bill reached the House of Lords on 4 May 1875 a week before the scientist's bill reached the House of Commons, the Home Secretary announced a Royal Commission of inquiry to resolve the arguments, with Huxley co-opted on to the Commission. The demand for Darwin as an author was shown when Insectivorous Plants, a 450-page catalogue of plant experiments, sold out quickly and in July a 1,000 copy reprint sold out within a fortnight. Variation revised Now Darwin turned to work on a new edition of The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication incorporating additions from the hundreds of letters and scores of monographs that had been sent to Darwin in the seven years since it had been published. Parts were altered or discarded, and George Romanes set aside work on jellyfish to graft vegetable plants in experiments aimed at finding out about the \\"gemmules\\" which Darwin thought formed the mechanism of inheritance of characteristics. Investigations into \\"pangenesis\\" by Galton had tried blood transfusions between different breeds of rabbits without success. Darwin continued to look for proof of inheritance of acquired characteristics, amassing evidence of blacksmith's children being muscular and babies born with scars matching those of their parents. He would not follow Huxley in discarding these ideas, and Descent had presented such inheritance as a significant factor in human evolution. Darwin had long been concerned that his children could have inherited his weaknesses. He was proud that Frank seemed to have inherited his interest in natural history, coming to Down House from the village to carry out plant experiments, and put his son up for a Fellowship of the Linnean Society. Cross and Self Fertilisation With Variation at the printers and with his old essay on The Movements and Habits of Climbing Plants due out in November 1875 with \\"illustrations... drawn by my son, George\\", Darwin wrote The Effects of Cross and Self Fertilisation in the Vegetable Kingdom. This drew on a painstaking series of experiments, protecting the plants from insects and controlling the pollination of flowers, counting the seeds and checking them for fertility, repeated for up to ten generations with detailed records kept at every stage. Darwin tabulated the results, Galton checked his statistics, and they found the crossed plants significantly superior to self- fertilised ones in height, weight, vigour and fertility. The same principle would apply to people, and though the attempt to get a question on the census had failed, George analysed data from lunatic asylums and the Pall Mall Gazette which Darwin cited as showing a small effect produced by first-cousin marriages. While Emma ensured that he took short breaks, Darwin pressed on with work as \\"my sole pleasure in life\\" and finished the first draft of Fertilisation in May 1876, promptly going on to a revision of Orchids. Recollections They visited Hensleigh and Fanny to celebrate the announcement that Frank's wife Amy was five months pregnant, and Charles and Emma would shortly become grandparents. Darwin decided to leave a posthumous memoir for his family, and on Sunday 28 May 1876 he began Recollections of the Development of my mind and character. He found this candid private memoir easy going, covering his childhood, university, life on the Beagle and developing work in science. A section headed \\"Religious Belief\\" opened just before his marriage, and frankly discussed his long disagreement with Emma. (see Charles Darwin's views on religion) He recalled Annie and thought of how, but for her untimely death, she would now \\"have grown into a delightful woman... Tears still come into my eyes, when I think of her sweet ways\\". He completed his memoir on 3 August, concluding that after his book on fertilisation was published, \\"my strength... will probably be exhausted\\". On 7 September the baby, named Bernard, was born at Down House, but his mother suffered a fever and convulsions, and died four days later at the age of 26. Darwin thought it the \\"most dreadful thing\\", and Frank in a state of shock and grief moved into Down House with the baby. The contractors were brought in to extend the house for him, and Frank carried on with mechanical chores for his father, making a fair copy of the memoir and correcting proofs of Orchids. Liberalism Despite Ffinden's continuing opposition, Emma's project of a parish reading room for labourers was restarted and opened before Christmas. Darwin saw Orchids and Cross and Self Fertilisation published as he wrote his next book on flowers. In February 1877 he attended the George and Dragon in his position as treasurer and persuaded the village labourers, who were suffering from wage cuts and a threat to their jobs in a farm slump, not to disband the Friendly Society and take the proceeds, but to keep some protection for their longer term security by keeping the books open while distributing their surplus funds. His old Whig principles fitted well with the Self-Help philosophy of another Murray author, Samuel Smiles, who had impressed Darwin. As a \\"thorough Liberal\\", Darwin supported Gladstone, the \\"Grand Old Man\\" of British politics. Three months earlier Darwin had backed the outcry against the \\"Bulgarian horrors\\" when 15,000 (Christian) Bulgarian rebels were massacred by Muslim \\"Turkish\\" troops of the Ottoman Empire, and supported Gladstone's calls for Russian intervention in opposition to the Tory government's support for the Turks. Marx thought this a hypocritical preference for a Christian oppressor, and complained about Darwin's support for the \\"piggish demonstration\\". On 10 March Gladstone, while doing the rounds of his backbenchers and visiting Lubbock, turned up with his entourage at Down House and for two hours regaled a silent Darwin with comments from his latest pamphlet on \\"Turkish terrorism\\", and \\"launched forth his thunderbolts with unexhausted zest\\". Before leaving he asked Darwin if evolution meant that the future belonged to America as the Eastern civilisations decayed; after thinking it over, Darwin responded \\"Yes.\\" Watching Gladstone's \\"erect alert figure\\" walking away, he said \\"What an honour that such a great man should come to visit me!\\" A fortnight after Gladstone's visit, the leading secularist, militant atheist and unofficial Liberal candidate Charles Bradlaugh with co-publisher Annie Besant caused public outrage by publishing do-it-yourself contraceptive advice from an American doctor, Charles Knowlton, in a sixpenny pamphlet Fruits of Philosophy. View original copy. :See also: Bradlaugh and Besant were accused of obscenity and committed for trial on 18 June 1877. A fortnight beforehand they subpoenaed Darwin for their defence, expecting his support. Appalled, he wrote protesting the \\"great suffering\\" this would put him to, and advised that he would have to denounce the defendants as he had \\"long held an opposite opinion\\" on birth control, as evidenced by an extract from the Descent of Man stating that \\"our natural rate of increase, though leading to many and obvious evils, must not be greatly diminished by any means.\\" The practice of contraception would \\"spread to unmarried women & would destroy chastity on which the family bond depends; & the weakening of this bond would be the greatest of all evils to mankind.\\" Holidays The subpoena was dropped, and Darwin was not held back from holidaying at Leith Hill and Southampton for his much needed \\"rest\\" which, as usual, meant working furiously away from home. He visited Stonehenge for the first time, examining how worm castings had buried the megaliths over time. Emma feared that the day-trip involving two hours train journey and a 24-mile drive would \\"half kill\\" him, but he was in wonderful form even after digging in the hot sun. In mid July 1877 his work on the sex life of plants culminated in the publication of The Different Forms of Flowers on Plants of the Same Species, dedicated to Asa Gray. He could not \\"endure being idle\\" and turned to his next book, on plant movement. Emma got him away for his autumn break to Abinger on the North Downs, and though Wallace now lived only a few miles away, Darwin avoided him, diplomatically writing that he \\"wished to come over to see you, but driving tires me so much that my courage failed.\\" Honorary doctorate The University of Cambridge had come round to Darwinism, and on Saturday 17 November the family attended the Senate House for a ceremony in which Darwin was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Laws in front of crowds of students, who strung a cord across the chamber with a monkey-marionette which was removed by a Proctor then replaced by a \\"missing link\\", a beribboned ring which hung over the crowd through the ceremony. Darwin entered to a roar of approval. The Public Orator gave his panegyric describing Darwin's work with purple Latin prose, to some good humoured heckling from the students, and distanced the dignitaries from \\"the unlovely tribe of apes\\" saying \\"'Mores in utroques dispares' ‚Äì the moral nature of the two races is different\\". Emma had a headache, so she and Darwin let their boys to stand in for them at a dinner in his honour at which Huxley chided the university for failing to honour Darwin twenty years earlier. On the Sunday, after a \\"brilliant luncheon\\" with George at Trinity College, they were given guided tours. The engineering professor James Stuart showed Emma and Darwin round his workshop and later wrote of \\"A strong.. looking man with iron grey hair..[as though] rough hewn from a rock with a heavy..hammer,... A man of genius.. indeed one of 'the few'.\\" Romanes Into the spring of 1878 Darwin and Frank again filled the house with experiments on the movement of plants. To Frank it was \\"as if an outside force were compelling him\\", and in March the strain brought back his old sickness of attacks of dizziness. Dr. Clark in London prescribed a \\"dry diet\\" which helped, and refused to charge his patient so Darwin sent ¬£100 towards the development of a fungus-proof potato by a \\"highly respectable\\" Belfast breeder. He also responded to an appeal asking 's officers for help in supporting an orphan ‚Äì the grandson of Jemmy Button. George Romanes had become Darwin's leading prot√©g√©, but a conflict between his reasoned scepticism and earlier longing for faith came to a head when his sister died. His attempt to get solace from a leading spiritualist came to nothing. Darwin invited Romanes to Downe to help him recover. Romanes had earlier written a refutation of theism, and had taken Darwin's advice to pause, but now wanted to publish. Darwin counselled anonymity, and suggested study of the evolution of religious reasoning, giving him unused notes on instinct from his work on Natural Selection. Romanes launched on the study of comparative psychology, and in August was given a standing ovation for his talk at the British Association. In November the Darwins were staying with the Litchfields, and Romanes drove there to introduce his fianc√© and present his new book, A Candid Examination of Theism by \\"Physicus\\". Darwin read it with \\"very great interest\\", but was unconvinced. Biography of Erasmus Darwin The German scientific periodical Kosmos featured, as a 70th birthday tribute to Charles Darwin, an essay by Ernst Krause on his grandfather Erasmus Darwin. In March 1879 he arranged for it to be translated as a book to which he would add a biographical preface. This would counter Samuel Butler's Evolution Old and New in which the previously supportive, though unscientific, author of Erewhon had turned against Darwinism, and he sent a copy of it to Krause. In the summer he became bogged down with the proofs of his preface about Erasmus, and Henrietta edited out controversial points. The publisher John Murray was satisfied, but Darwin vowed \\"never again\\" to be \\"tempted out of my proper work\\". Abominable mystery The origin and swift diversification of flowering plants in the Early Cretaceous appeared to go against Darwin's view of gradual evolution, and in a July 1879 letter to Joseph Dalton Hooker he called this an \\"abominable mystery\\". He sought explanations such as a long earlier development having taken place in an area where the fossil record had been lost, possibly a sunken continent, or relatively rapid development having been spurred by coevolution between insects and plants. Although he tired more quickly now, Darwin still worked for several hours a day. Emma ensured he took holidays, in autumn 1879 joining the Litchfields for a month in the Lake District where he met with John Ruskin, though this was not a meeting of minds. On return the Darwins were visited by Ernst Haeckel whose \\"roaring\\" about the freedom of science had Darwin retreating to his plants. Darwin unsuccessfully tried to get government support for the Belfast potato breeder from the Permanent Secretary, Thomas \\"Theta\\" Farrer (Effie Wedgwood's husband). Farrer was more concerned that his daughter by his first marriage wanted to marry the unsuitable sickly Horace Darwin. Despite her father's opposition the young couple prevailed, with Darwin giving his son ¬£5,000 of railway stock and assuring Farrer that Horace would have a suitable inheritance. The wedding took place on 3 January 1880, with the families not on speaking terms. Samuel Butler In Evolution Old and New Samuel Butler claimed that earlier evolutionists had correctly seen the mind as controlling evolution, and Mivart told Richard Owen that he thought the book would \\"help to burst the bubble of 'Natural Selection'.\\" Ernst Krause's Erasmus Darwin countered this, and Butler took affront at Darwin's preface which said that Krause's essay predated Butler's book, when it clearly had passages written later. Darwin had to admit that Krause had revised his essay, and spent a week in February 1880 drafting responses, then was persuaded to ignore the dispute, writing to Huxley \\"I feel like a man condemned to be hung who has just got a reprieve\\". Butler took the silence as a tacit admission of guilt. Coming of Age Huxley titled his Royal Institution talk The Coming of Age of the Origin of Species, celebrating its 21st anniversary, though wrongly claiming that before its publication only catastrophism was accepted. While Darwin (on holiday with the Farrers, now on good terms) was delighted by the press coverage, he was disappointed to find no mention in its text of natural selection ‚Äì even \\"Darwin's Bulldog\\" was still not committed to the central plank of his theory. In April, Gladstone defeated the Tories at the general election, delighting Charles and Emma Darwin though not all their relatives, and a buoyant Charles sent a large subscription to Abbot's The Index with hearty wishes for success in the \\"good cause of truth\\" and 'free religion'. The Liberal success even got the militant atheist Charles Bradlaugh elected as MP for Northampton, and public controversy about atheism erupted. He was prevented from taking his seat in the House of Commons by procedural requirements of the oath of allegiance, and secularists such as Edward Aveling toured the country leading protests. Aveling had been writing a series on Darwin and his Works in Bradlaugh's paper The National Reformer, and Darwin had sent written thanks which he now feared would be published to his shame. In June, after sending Movement in Plants to his publisher John Murray, Darwin visited William and Sarah at Southampton, and he got William to write to Abbot withdrawing the endorsement that had been printed as advertising copy in the magazine: even association with free thought in distant America could damage his respectability. Darwin as photographed by Elliott & Fry at Down House, 1879 Worms Darwin again took up his work on worms. As ever, he corresponded widely, encouraging and helping fund research and collecting anecdotes. Emma supported his commitment, saying that \\"if it was a condition of his living, that he sh[oul]d do now work, she was willing for him to die\\". For their autumn break they visited Horace and Ida in Cambridge, and to spare him the stress of getting between London stations and changing trains Emma arranged a private railway carriage. At Cambridge he showed Emma around the \\"scenes of my early life\\". In September 1880 he completed the proofs of Movement in Plants, his largest botany book at 600 pages with 196 wood-cuts, sighing \\"I am turned into a sort of machine for observing facts & grinding out conclusions.\\" When on 13 October he got the request he had feared from Aveling, for permission to dedicate the Darwin and his Works articles to Darwin in book format, he declined in a four-page letter marked PRIVATE emphasising that he confined his writing to science and avoided aiding attacks on religion. Attacks on Darwin's theory continued, and when the official report of a scientific voyage slighted \\"the theory which refers the evolution of species to extreme variation guided only by natural selection\\" he responded in Nature, \\"Can Sir Wyville Thomson name any one who has said that the evolution of species depends only on natural selection?\\" and set out multiple causes, including \\"use and disuse of parts\\". He called Thomson's criticism appropriate to \\"theologians and metaphysicians\\", and was only stopped by Huxley from using \\"irreverent language\\". Help for Wallace Wallace was suffering \\"ever-increasing anxiety\\" over funds, and Arabella Buckley, Lyell's old secretary, pleaded with Darwin to help him find \\"some modest work\\". Hooker persuaded Darwin it was hopeless, noting that Wallace had \\"lost caste\\" over spiritualism and a ¬£500 bet he had won by proving the world was a globe to a rich flat-earth fanatic who then started litigation which cost Wallace more than the bet had won. When Wallace's \\"best book\\" to date, Island Life, came out in November 1880 Darwin devoted all his attention to getting his friends to sign a testimonial he wrote, then rushed it to Gladstone before the re- opening of Parliament at the start of January and was overjoyed when Gladstone agreed to recommend a civil list pension of ¬£200 a year, backdated six months. As Darwin passed on the good news to Wallace, Emma organised the family accounts so that Charles could distribute the surplus from the year's ¬£8,000 investment income to the children. Work on worms Downe was snowed in, and an outbreak of swine fever involved Darwin as magistrate signing orders daily to allow movement of stock. He wrote to Kovalevsky \\"I make sure, but wo[e]fully slow progress, with my new book\\" on worms. In late February he visited London, and called on Duke of Argyll, his old opponent. They had a long and \\"awfully friendly\\" discussion, and when Argyll asked if it was not \\"impossible to look at [the design of orchids] without seeing that they were the effect and the expression of Mind?\\", Darwin looked at him \\"very hard\\" before replying that he could see the \\"overwhelming force\\" this argument might have, but he could no longer accept it. The billiard room at Down House was now devoted to worm experiments which included Darwin shining different colours of lights at them at night, his sons playing different musical instruments to them, different scents and kinds of food. Other stimuli were ignored, but a bright white light or a touch of breath would make them bolt \\"like rabbits\\" into their burrows. They appeared to \\"enjoy the pleasure of eating\\" showing \\"eagerness for certain kinds of food\\", sexual passion was \\"strong enough to overcome... their dread of light\\", and he saw \\"a trace of social feeling\\" in their way of \\"crawling over each other's bodies\\". Experiments showed that they dragged leaves into their burrows narrow end first, having somehow got a \\"notion, however rude, of the shape of an object\\", maybe by \\"touching it in many places\\" with a sense like \\"a man... born blind and deaf\\" and a rudimentary intelligence. By mid march he was writing the final chapters of what he told Victor Carus would be \\"a small book of little moment. I have little strength & feel very old.\\" He wrote to The Times about the anti-vivisection cause, accusing it of committing \\"a crime against humanity\\" by holding back the \\"progress of physiology\\", then commented that we \\"ought to be grateful\\" to worms, which reached a depth of \\"five or six feet\\" even \\"here at Down\\" where he expected to be buried shortly. No heart or strength Before Easter he sent off his manuscript for The Formation of Vegetable Mould through the Action of Worms, and found he had no \\"heart or strength... to begin any investigation lasting for years\\". \\"Never happy except when at work\\", he was at a loose end until he remembered his autobiography. On 22 April 1881, exactly 30 years after Annie's burial, he re-read the passages about her and Emma's letter of that time, and added a note under his daguerreotype of Annie, \\"When I am dead, know that many times, I have kissed & cryed over this.\\" [sic.] He left the proofs of Worms to Frank and, despondent, turned down Gladstone's invitation to become a Trustee of the British Museum. Early in June 1881 Emma and the Litchfields took him to the Lake District, together with William and young Bernard. The sky was \\"like lead\\" and an attempt at climbing brought spots before his eyes and a doctor's diagnosis that his heart condition was \\"precarious\\". He wrote to Hooker that \\"Illness is downright misery to me... I cannot forget my discomfort for an hour [and] must look forward to Down graveyard as the sweetest place on earth.\\" The Creed of Science Then he was perked up by the 400-page The Creed of Science by the Irish philosopher William Graham arguing the validity of traditional beliefs in the face of materialism. Darwin wrote to Graham expressing doubts about the conclusions ‚Äì \\"The chief one is that the existence of so-called natural laws implies purpose. I cannot see this.\\" He was swayed by one ‚Äì \\"You have expressed my inward conviction.. that the Universe is not the result of chance\\", but then qualified this by his \\"horrid doubt\\" that such beliefs might have arisen as the human mind evolved, and were no more to be trusted than \\"the convictions of a monkey's mind, if there are any convictions in such a mind\\". He still supported natural selection as the engine of social progress, pointing out that \\"The more civilised so-called Caucasian races have beaten the Turkish hollow in the struggle for existence\\" and telling Graham that elimination of \\"lower races\\" by \\"higher civilised races\\" was inevitable in the progress of Malthusian struggle. Back at Downe, a letter from Wallace promoted the socialist ideas of Henry George's Progress and Poverty proposing to \\"make land common property\\" as morally just. The landowner Darwin responded that such books had \\"a disastrous effect\\" on his mind, he hoped that Wallace would not \\"turn renegade to natural history\\" while adding that \\"I have everything to make me happy and contented\\". Pleasant memories To Hooker he wrote of \\"Pleasant memories of long past days... many a discussion and... a good fight\\". Hooker valued their arguments \\"as iron sharpeneth iron\\" and, longing to \\"throw off the trammels of official life\\" and retire from Kew, found it \\"difficult to resist the pessimist view of creation\\", but \\"when I look back... to the days I have spent in intercourse with you and yours, that view takes wings to itself and flies away.\\" That summer Darwin was in his \\"happiest spirits\\", chatting \\"deliciously\\" for hours and in the evenings asking for Bach and Handel to be played repeatedly. Romanes, visiting with his wife and baby, thought the old man as \\"grand and good and bright as ever\\". Darwin stayed with Erasmus while his portrait was painted by John Collier and on 3 August dined by special invitation with the Prince of Wales, the Crown Prince of Germany and eminent physicians at the start of the Seventh International Medical Congress. Later, Erasmus became gravely ill and died on 26 August, and at the funeral at Downe on 1 September Charles, looking \\"old and ill\\", was a picture of \\"sad reverie\\". Subsequently, Darwin inherited half Erasmus's estate. William announced that this made Darwin's wealth over a quarter of a million pounds, \\"without mother's fortune\\", and Darwin redrafted his will. He sent a note to his sister Caroline about her half of Erasmus's estate, enclosing a miniature of their mother and commenting that he could not remember her face, though he did recall her \\"black velvet gown\\" and the \\"death scene\\". A requested visit from the eminent but atheist German Doctor Ludwig B√ºchner in company with the notorious Edward Aveling went amiably on Thursday 28 September with Darwin introducing his old friend the Revd. Brodie Innes, and defending agnosticism (see Charles Darwin's views on religion). Worms was published in October 1881 and within weeks thousands had been sold. It brought a flood of letters, with many \\"idiotic\\" enquiries, and a \\"worn out\\" Darwin escaped with Emma to visit Horace and Ida in Cambridge. Roots and illness Darwin, \\"quite set up\\", returned to his experiments on plant roots standing in an ammonia solution, preparing sections and looking for \\"physiological division of labour\\" through his microscope. In London he made an unannounced visit to the house of Romanes on 15 December. Romanes was absent, and Darwin declined the concerned butler's invitation to come in. He crossed the street, stumbled and clutched the railings before getting a cab. The next morning Dr. Clark pronounced him fine, but Emma kept him indoors and he was visited by eminent scientists. He seemed bright and animated, but told the geologist John Judd that he had \\"received his warning\\". Once home, this did not hold him back from working hard at his root cells, as well as still doing his walks round the Sandwalk, receiving visitors and dealing with letters. In one he argued with an American feminist that women are \\"inferior intellectually\\". In February he was \\"miserable to a strange degree\\" with a cough. On 7 March 1882 he had a seizure while on the Sandwalk 400 yards from the house and struggled back to collapse in Emma's arms. Dr. Clark diagnosed angina and prescribed morphine pills for the pain. Darwin lay prostrate in despair, then a younger doctor, Dr. Norman Moore, assured him that his heart was only weak and within days Darwin was back at work, writing to Nature about beetles. Having company helped. Henrietta brought her friend Laura Forster (aunt of E. M. Forster), herself making a rapid recovery from illness. Darwin daily told Laura of his symptoms and feelings. One day he came out into the garden and, putting his arms round Emma, said \\"Oh Laura, what a miserable man I should be without this dear woman.\\" Another afternoon he joined her in the drawing-room and said \\"The clocks go dreadfully slowly, I have come in here to see if this one gets over the hours any quicker than the study one does.\\" Emma wanted a quiet Easter, so Laura and Henrietta left on 4 April, but on the 4th and 5th Darwin suffered attacks, noting \\"much pain\\". He recorded his own symptoms, and continued to note sporadic attacks. He took capsules of amyl nitrite, an antispasmodic, and was attended by Dr. Moore and a local physician, Dr. Allfrey. On the 10th, George arrived back from the West Indies, and though Darwin was not up to talking for very long, he enjoyed George's news. Emma remembered how Darwin was \\"gracious & tender\\" when being attended for his illness, and would say \\"It is almost worth while to be so to be nursed by you\\". George helped Frank and Jackson (the butler) to carry Darwin to and from his bed. On the nights of 11 and 12 April, Darwin had excruciating attacks of pain. On Saturday 15 April they were visited by the Lichfield family. Darwin joined them for dinner but had a giddy attack and fell down, and had to retire early. He did better on the Sunday, and on Monday was well enough to walk, supported on both sides, as far as the orchard. Death Darwin seemed \\"fully up to the average, so on Tuesday 18 April the Lichfields left and George went to Cambridge. Darwin stayed up late later than usual in the evening, chatting to Bessy. Just before midnight he again had agonising pain, and woke a flustered Emma to ask for the amyl nitrite. She had difficulties finding it at first, and with the assistance of Bessy gave him brandy. Emma later noted that he had woken her saying \\"I have got the pain & I shall feel better or bear it better if you are awake\\". He had taken the antispasmodic twice, and afterwards said \\"I am not the least afraid of death- Remember what a good wife you have been to me ‚Äì Tell all my children to remember how good they have been to me\\". Dr Allfrey attended and gave some relief, then after he left at 8 a.m. Charles began violent vomiting, after two hours gasping \\"If I could but die\\" repeatedly. Frank and Henrietta returned to join Bessy, who persuaded a worn out Emma to take an opium pill and rest. Charles woke in a daze, recognised his children and embraced them with tears. Emma's notes state that after the worse of the distress he said \\"I was so sorry for you ‚Äì but I could not help you... there never were such good nurses as you [Francis] & Henrietta ‚Äì Where is Mammy\\", and when told she was lying down, \\"I am glad of it... Don't call her I don't want her\\", and often \\"It's almost worth while to be sick to be nursed by you\\". He suffered more bouts of nausea and pain, then at 3.25 p.m. groaned \\"I feel as if I should faint\\". Emma was called and held him as he suffered excruciating pain, then lost consciousness and died at 4 p.m. on Wednesday 19 April 1882. Dr Allfrey signed the death certificate which gave \\"Angina pectoris Syncope\\" as the cause of death. Frank brought Bernard from the nursery to the garden. As they walked past the drawing-room window Bernard noticed his aunts and said \\"Why are Bessy and Etty crying? because Grandpa is so ill?\\" Grief-stricken, Frank eventually said \\"Grandpa has been so ill that he won't be ill any more.\\" They reached the Sandwalk and Bernard gathered a bouquet of wild lilies. Funeral Arrangements were made for burial in St. Mary's churchyard at Downe, with Brodie Innes offering to perform the rites, and the customary black edged letters were sent out to friends, relatives and colleagues. In London Galton got William Spottiswoode as President of the Royal Society to telegraph the Darwins asking if they would consent to burial in Westminster Abbey, an honour that Darwin had been glad to see given to Lyle in 1875. They told Hooker, Lubbock and Huxley who with Spottiswoode met the Revd. Frederic Farrar, Canon of Westminster. Farrar suggested a petition to overcome any objections to an agnostic being buried in the Abbey, and approached the Revd. George Granville Bradley, Dean of Westminster. Lubbock took up a petition in the House of Commons stating that \\"it would be acceptable to a very large number of our countrymen of all classes and opinions that our illustrious countryman Mr. Darwin should be buried in Westminster Abbey.\\" It was \\"very influentially signed\\". Newspapers took the request up, sending a public plea to Emma and the children to consent, as foreign tributes poured in. The Standard maintained that \\"true Christians can accept the main scientific facts of Evolution just as they do of Astronomy and Geology\\", The Times declared the 1860 debate was \\"ancient history\\" and the Daily News said that Darwin's doctrine was consistent \\"with strong religious faith and hope\\". Hurried arrangements were made, and Emma saw it \\"nearly settled. It gave us all a pang not to have him rest quietly by Eras ‚Äì ; but William felt strongly, and on reflection I did also, that his gracious & grateful nature would have wished to accept the acknowledgement of what he had done\\". While her children and relatives attended the funeral, she stayed at Downe. The Downe tradesmen were disappointed, the publican pointing out that it \\"would have helped the place so much, for it would have brought hosts of people down to see his grave\\". The joiner had \\"made his coffin just the way he wanted it, all rough, just as it left the bench, no polish, no nothin\\", but this was returned and replaced by one \\"you could see to shave in\\". He added that \\"They buried him in Westminster Abbey, but he always wanted to lie here, and I don't think he'd have liked it.\\" That Sunday, Church sermons praised Darwin, saying Natural Selection was \\"by no means alien to the Christian tradition\\" (if interpreted correctly) and seeking a \\"reconciliation between Faith and Science\\". On Tuesday there was a massive demand for admission cards to the funeral. All day on Tuesday the hearse was drawn by four horses the 16 miles from Downe to Westminster in cold drizzling rain. Next morning the Abbey filled with mourners including international dignitaries and scientists. At mid day on Wednesday 26 April 1882 the full pomp of a state occasion began. The service included a specially commissioned anthem setting words from the Book of Proverbs to music composed for the occasion by Frederick Bridge, \\"Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and getteth understanding\\".Words of Anthem composed by J. Frederick Bridge. Westminster Abbey, 1882. As the Darwin family later recalled, William \\"was sitting in the front seat as eldest son and chief mourner, and he felt a draught on his already bald head; so he put his black gloves to balance on the top of his skull, and sat like that all through the service with the eyes of the nation upon him.\\" Darwin was buried beneath the monument to Isaac Newton, next to Sir John Herschel, and as the coffin was lowered, the choir sang an anthem from Ecclesiasticus to music by Handel, \\"His body is buried in peace, but his name liveth evermore\\". Pallbearers at the funeral included: William Cavendish, 7th Duke of Devonshire; George John Douglas Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll; Edward Henry Stanley, 15th Earl of Derby; James Russell Lowell; William Spottiswoode; Joseph Dalton Hooker; Alfred Russel Wallace; Thomas Henry Huxley; John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury; and last but by no means least Rev. Frederic Farrar;The Funeral of Mr Darwin, The Times, 27 April 1882. (Wikisource) Stanley and Farrar were both Cambridge Apostles as Erasmus Alvey 'Ras' Darwin had been; Charles Darwin himself had not been a member of the Cambridge Apostles. The service was conducted by Canon George Prothero (1818-1894) and the other Westminster Abbey staff present were minor canon Rev. John Henry Cheadle (? - ?); minor canon Rev. John Troutbeck (1832-1899); Canon Thomas James Rowsell (1816-1894); Canon Alfred Barry (1826-1910); Canon Robinson Duckworth (1834-1911); Rev. Samuel Flood Jones, precentor, (1826-1895); the Chapter Clerk, Mr. Charles St. Clare Bedford (1810-1900); Frederick Bridge, organist 1844-1924 (according to The Times, he composed an anthem for the funeral). The Dean, George Granville Bradley, was not in the country at the time of the funeral hence Canon Prothero was in charge. Commemoration Galton proposed a commemorative stained glass window in the Abbey, with panels symbolising the works of nature, each contributed by a different country. The evolution pane did not proceed, but the Royal Society formed a committee which decided on a bronze plaque in the Abbey, and a statue for the new Natural History Museum at South Kensington. Richard Owen remained opposed, and unveiling of the statue had to wait till 1885, after his retirement. The pomp and ceremony was attended by the Prince of Wales, scientists and the family, though not Emma, and led by Huxley. Darwin's Westminster Abbey funeral expressed a public feeling of national pride, with the Pall Mall Gazette proclaiming that Great Britain had \\"lost a man whose name is a glory to his country\\". Religious writers of all persuasions praised his \\"noble character and his ardent pursuit of truth\\", calling him a \\"true Christian gentleman\\". In particular the Unitarians and free religionists, proud of his Dissenting upbringing, supported his naturalistic views. William Benjamin Carpenter carried a resolution praising Darwin's unravelling of \\"the immutable laws of the Divine Government\\", shedding light on \\"the progress of humanity\\". The Unitarian preacher John Chadwick from New York wrote that \\"The nation's grandest temple of religion opened its gates and lifted up its everlasting doors and bade the King of Science come in.\\" NotesReferences * * Further reading *The Complete Works of Charles Darwin Online ‚Äì Darwin Online; Darwin's publications, private papers and bibliography, supplementary works including biographies, obituaries and reviews.

In November 1922, she was the second woman to be called to the Bar of England and Wales, following the example set by Ivy Williams in May 1922. When she married she kept her surname and in 1924 she was the first British married woman to have a passport in the name she was born with.  Early life  Normanton was born in East London to Jane Amelia (nee Marshall) and piano maker William Alexander Normanton. In 1886, when she was just four years old, her father was found dead in a railway tunnel.

She says that as a twelve years old girl, she was visiting a solicitor's office with her mother, who was unable to understand the solicitor‚Äôs advice. Normanton recognised this situation as a form of sex discrimination and wished to help all women gain access to the law, which at the time was a profession only open to men. In the book, Normanton reflects: \\"I still do not like to see women getting the worst end of any deal for lack of a little elementary legal knowledge which is the most common form amongst men\\". She read modern history at the University of London as an external student, graduating with first class honours, obtained a Scottish Secondary Teachers' Diploma, and held a diploma in French language, literature and history from Dijon University.Who's Who 1938, p. 2513 She lectured in history at Glasgow University and London University, and began to speak and write about feminist issues. She spoke at meetings of the Women's Freedom League and supported the Indian National Congress. Legal career Normanton held ambitions to become a barrister from a young age. An application to become a student at Middle Temple in 1918 was refused, and she lodged a petition with the House of Lords. She reapplied on 24 December 1919, within hours of the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act 1919 coming into force, and was admitted to Middle Temple.'Obituary: Mrs H. F. Normanton, Q.C.', The Manchester Guardian, 16 October 1957 She married Gavin Bowman Watson Clark in 1921, but preserved her maiden name for professional reasons. In 1924, she became the first married British woman to be issued a passport in her maiden name. She was the second woman to be called to the bar, on 17 November 1922, shortly after Ivy Williams. She was the first woman to obtain a divorce for her client, the first woman to lead the prosecution in a murder trial, and the first woman to conduct a trial in America and to appear at the High Court and the Old Bailey. In 1949, along with Rose Heilbron, she was one of the first two women King's Counsel at the English Bar. Photograph of Helena Normanton taken in 1950 Feminism Normanton was a campaigner for women's rights and women's suffrage, becoming the first married woman in Britain to have a passport in her maiden name, believing that men and women should keep their money and property separately.Edge Hill magazine, Edge Hill University, accessed 10 January 2011 She was also a pacifist, later being a supporter of CND. Ten years after the passing of the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act 1919, Normanton spoke at the Women‚Äôs Engineering Society‚Äôs seventh Annual Conference in July 1929, alongside Professor Winifred Cullis, the first woman to hold a professorial chair at a medical school, and architect Edna Mosely. In her speech, Normanton noted that there were \\"nearly a hundred women solicitors in this country and most of them have brilliant qualifications; she did not believe in any boycott of men in professions, but the women ought at least to be brought into the sphere of action. There was a general muddle as present in regard to the position of women‚Ä¶They might become engineers but not minsters of the Church; they might not enter the sacred portals of the Stock Exchange nor the House of Lords; they could become a Cabinet Minister but not an Ambassador. While any woman was held back from the position to which her talents drew her, the whole of womanhood was lowered\\". She acted as the Honorary Legal Adviser for the Women's Engineering Society from 1936 until 1954, succeeding Theodora Llewelyn Davies in the role. She campaigned for divorce reform, and was president of the Married Women's Association until 1952, when the other officials resigned over her memorandum of evidence to the Royal Commission on Divorce, which they regarded as 'anti-man'. Normanton formed a breakaway body called the Council of Married Women. She founded the Magna Carta Society. She was a pacifist throughout her life, and demonstrated against the nuclear bomb after the Second World War.

Legacy  In February 2019, 218 Strand Chambers rebranded as Normanton Chambers in her honour. This is the first instance of a barristers' chambers being named after a woman. In 2020 barrister Karlia Lykourgou set up the first legal outfitter dedicated to offering courtwear for women, as much of the existing provision was impractical and uncomfortable. She named it Ivy & Normanton, in honour of Ivy Williams, the first woman to be called to the Bar in May 1922, and Helena Normanton.

Her career included many \\"firsts\\" for a woman ‚Äì she was the first woman to achieve a first class honours degree in law at the University of Liverpool, the first woman to win a scholarship to Gray's Inn, one of the first two women to be appointed King's Counsel in England, the first woman to lead in a murder case, the first woman recorder, the first woman judge to sit at the Old Bailey, and the first woman treasurer of Gray's Inn. She was also the second woman to be appointed a High Court judge, after Elizabeth Lane. Early life Heilbron was born in Liverpool, the daughter of a Jewish hotelier, Max Heilbron. He assisted Jews who wanted to emigrate. She attended The Belvedere School and Liverpool University, where she became one of the first two women to gain a first class honours degree in law, in 1935. She was awarded the Lord Justice Holker scholarship at Gray's Inn in 1936, and she became one of only two women to hold a master of laws degree in 1937. Two years later she was called to the bar, and joined the Northern Circuit in 1940. Career Heilbron practised mainly in personal injury and criminal law. Her rapid rise may have been aided by the fact that so many men were in the armed forces in the Second World War, during her first six years as a barrister. She was junior counsel for the West Indian cricketer Learie Constantine in his case in 1944, Constantine v Imperial Hotels, after he was turned away from a hotel due to his colour. In 1946, in Adams v Naylor, she represented two boys injured in a minefield on the beach between Crosby and Southport in a claim against an army officer; the unsuccessful appeal to the House of Lords contributed to the Crown Proceedings Act 1947. By 1946, Heilbron had appeared in 10 murder trials, and in 1949, just a few months after the birth of her daughter, she was one of the first two female King's Counsel at the English Bar (the other was Helena Normanton). Aged 34, she was the youngest KC since Thomas Erskine in 1783 when he was aged 33. She became something of a household name, especially in her home city, when, in 1949‚Äì50, she became the first woman to lead in a murder case, when she defended the gangster George Kelly, accused of shooting dead the deputy manager of the Cameo Cinema in Liverpool, which became known as the \\"Cameo murder\\". He reportedly said that he was not \\"having a Judy defend [him]\\", but he later praised her for her painstaking defence, which led to her being named the Daily Mirrors \\"Woman of the Year\\". She was unable to save Kelly from the gallows, but the Court of Appeal quashed his conviction as unsafe in 2003. Heilbron's successes in the first half of the 1950s included the defence of four men accused of hanging a boy during a burglary, in which she was able to show that the death had been an accident; and the defence of Louis Bloom, a solicitor from Hartlepool who was accused of murdering his mistress in his office, but was found guilty of manslaughter. However, in 1953 she was unable to save John Todd from the gallows for the murder of a shopkeeper in Aintree. She led in several other important cases, included Ormrod v Crosville Motor Services on vicarious liability in 1953, and Sweet v Parsley on the presumption of a requirement for mens rea in criminal offences in 1970. Heilbron was appointed as Recorder for Burnley in November 1956, the first appointment of a woman as Recorder, although not the first time one had sat. (Sybil Campbell was appointed a metropolitan stipendiary magistrate in 1945, and Dorothy Knight Dix was the first woman to preside at a jury trial in 1946, as deputy recorder of Deal). In 1957, she was the first woman to sit as a Commissioner of Assize. Elizabeth Lane was appointed the first female judge in the County Court in 1962 and of the High Court in 1965, but Heilbron was appointed as the first female judge to sit at the Old Bailey on 4 January 1972. She became leader of the Northern Circuit in 1973 and then followed Lane as the second woman High Court judge in 1974. Despite her background in criminal cases, which would have naturally suited her to the Queen's Bench Division, she was assigned to the Family Division, and created a DBE. She took charge of many criminal cases while presiding judge of the Northern Circuit (the first woman Presiding Judge of any Circuit) from 1979 to 1982. In 1975, the Home Secretary, Roy Jenkins, appointed Heilbron to chair a committee to consider reform of rape laws. The committee's subsequent report recommended that the identity of rape complainants should be kept secret, and that the defence should be limited in its ability to cross-examine the complainant about their sexual history in an effort to attack their character. In 1976, she was made an honorary fellow of Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford. She became a bencher at Gray's Inn in 1968, and was the first woman to head one of the four Inns of Court when she became its Treasurer in 1985. She retired from judicial office in 1988. Dame Rose Heilbron Q.C was the inspiration for the character of Harriet Peterson in the classic 1970s Yorkshire television series \\"Justice\\", which ran for three years (1971-74). Personal life Her hobbies included golf and walking, and she was a keen member of Soroptimist, the worldwide organisation for women in management and the professions, working to advance human rights and the status of women. She was an honorary Colonel of the East Lancashire Battalion of the WRAC. It was reported that she was the first woman in Liverpool to wear a calf-length evening dress.Obituary, The Guardian, 13 December 2005 In 1945, she married the Dublin-born general practitioner, Dr Nathaniel Burstein (1905‚Äì2010). He became a consultant at a Liverpool hospital, and there is little doubt that the availability of medical knowledge was a great help to her in some cases. Her daughter, Hilary, was born in January 1949; Hilary also became a barrister and was in 1987 appointed a QC, the 29th woman so honoured. Death Heilbron and her husband had moved from Liverpool to London when she was appointed a High Court judge. She died in a nursing home in Islington, of pneumonia and cerebrovascular ischaemia, survived by her husband and daughter. A biography of Rose Heilbron by her daughter Hilary was published in 2012.

He was the son of Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook, the first Ashkenazi chief rabbi of British Mandatory Palestine. His teachings are partially responsible for the modern religious settlement movement in Judea and Samaria, largely through the Gush Emunim movement, which was founded by his students. Many of his ideological followers established such settlements, and he has been credited with the dissemination of his father's ideas, helping to form the basis of Religious Zionism. Under the leadership of Kook, with its center in the yeshiva founded by his father, Jerusalem's Mercaz HaRav, thousands of Orthodox Jews campaigned actively against territorial compromise, and established numerous settlements throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Many of these settlements were subsequently granted official recognition by Israeli governments, both right and left. Biography Rabbi Zvi Yehuda Kook (left) with Rabbi Shlomo Goren (middle) and Rabbi Abraham Shapira (right) at Mercaz HaRav, 1981 Zvi Yehuda Kook was born in 1891 in Zaumel in the Kovno Governorate of the Russian Empire (now ≈Ωeimelis in Northern Lithuania), where his father served as rabbi. His mother was his father's second wife, Reiza Rivka, the niece of Eliyahu David Rabinowitz-Teomim, Chief Rabbi of Jerusalem together with Shmuel Salant. Kook was named after his maternal grandfather, Rabbi Zvi Yehuda Rabinowitz-Teomim. In 1896, his father, with his entire family, moved to Bauska, Latvia, to serve as rabbi there. There Zvi Yehuda Kook studied Talmud under the guidance of Rabbi Reuven Gotfreud, the son-in- law of Rabbi Yoel Moshe Salomon, the founder of Petakh Tiqva. Later, he studied under R. Moshe Zeidel and Benjamin Levin. His principal teacher, however, remained his father throughout his life. His father also hired a private tutor to teach him Russian. In 1904, at age 13, he moved to Jaffa, when his father was appointed Chief Rabbi of the city, then part of Ottoman- controlled Palestine. Like his father, he would celebrate on each year the date of his ascent to Land of Israel, on the 28th day of Iyyar. In 1906, Zvi Yehuda Kook went to study at one of the most prominent yeshivas in Jerusalem at that time, Torat Chaim, in the future building of Ateret Cohanim. There, he became close to the Rosh Yeshiva, Rabbi Zerakh Epstein, despite being relatively young (around 15). His studies there, however, did not last long. He soon returned to Jaffa, where he assisted his father in an attempt establish a yeshiva in Jaffa. During this time, he began his close relationship with Rabbi Yaakov Moshe Charlap, a disciple of his father and future dean of the Mercaz HaRav yeshiva, and assisted Charlap in publishing Tzvi laTzadik. In 1910, at age 19, he assisted his father in publishing Shabbat Haaretz on the sale permit for the Sabbatical year, even writing some of the Halachic preface. Seeing he lacked time to truly study Torah like most people his age, he decided to remove himself from public activity for some time. First, he went to Porat Yoseph, the leading Sephardic yeshiva of Jerusalem. Then, he left to Halberstadt, Germany, and studied there in the local yeshiva. He also attended lectures at the local university. In addition to his own studies, Kook taught Talmud, Halacha, and Bible to young men in the area. With the outbreak of World War I in 1914, he was arrested as a citizen of the Russian Empire, the enemy country. After several weeks under difficult conditions in a detention camp in Hamburg, he was released and allowed to return to Halberstadt, where he needed to report once every two days in the local office. Only the following year, at the end of 1915, was he granted permission to leave Germany and join his father in Switzerland, where he was stuck due to the war. There he learned with his father, until his father left in 1916 to fill a rabbinic position in London. In 1920, he returned to Palestine (then under the British Mandate) and began teaching at Netzakh Israel school. A year later, he went to Europe to promote his father's new movement, \\"Degel Yerushalayim\\", among the leading rabbis of Europe. In 1922, he married Chava Leah Hutner in Warsaw. Chava Leah died childless in 1944, and Rabbi Tzvi Yehuda remained a widower until his death nearly 40 years later. From 1923, he served as the administrative director of the Mercaz HaRav yeshiva. After Rabbi Charlap died in 1952, he became Rosh Yeshiva until his own death. After the Six-Day War in 1967, he induced the Israeli government to approve the building of settlements in the West Bank and Gaza, and sent his students to that mission. He tried to strengthen the Chief Rabbinate, which he saw as the precursor of the future Sanhedrin. He passed away in Jerusalem on Purim of 1982, and was buried in the Mount of Olives Jewish Cemetery.The New York Times obituary Ideology=The process of redemption Rabbi Tzvi Yehuda Kook saw in the establishment of the modern State of Israel a major step in the redemption of the Jewish people. Many Torah scholars rejected the Zionist movement because they envisioned redemption as a future era that arrives complete from the very start, and not an ongoing process. But Talmudic Sages taughtJerusalem Talmud, Berakhot 1:1 that the redemption will take place \\"little by little\\", like the spreading light of dawn in the morning sky. This indicates that the redemption of Israel is a process that advances in stages. Furthermore, Rabbi Kook would note that the various stages of redemption are clearly described in the order of Ezekiel's prophecy (). Ezekiel first spoke of an initial stage of redemption, the ingathering of the exiles; only after that initial stage does the prophet describe the spiritual return of the people. Political views Rabbi Kook disapproved of religious coercion in Israel and even gave his support to the 'League for the Prevention of Religious Coercion.' In a newspaper interview, he explained, \\"I said at the time to the members of the 'League' that they were absolutely right: I hate religious coercion. With what sort of justice, and with what kind of integrity can one impose religion on a person?\\" He greatly respected Rabbi Shlomo Carlebach for his love for every Jew. When his students were surprised to see him meet with Carlebach - the \\"Singing Rabbi\\" known for his efforts to reach out to young men and women on the margins of Jewish society, he told them, \\"You should know, [Carlebach] goes to places that none of you ever go.\\" He staunchly opposed any political moves to relinquish parts of the Land of Israel. \\"We are not a nation of conquerors. We are returning to the land of our fathers. No one, no prime minister, has the authority to renounce any part of the country. It belongs to the entire people of Israel, to the Jews of Pakistan, the United States and the Soviet Union.\\" Rabbi Zvi Yehuda greatly admired Rabbi Meir Kahane and his activism on behalf of Jewry. When Rabbi Kahane formed a political party, Rabbi Zvi Yehuda endorsed his bid for a Knesset seat. Though he had originally been a staunch supporter of the National Religious Party, he broke with them in 1974 after they entered the Rabin government over his opposition. In his letter of support to Kahane, he stated: \\"The presence of Rabbi Meir Kahane and his uncompromising words from the Knesset platform will undoubtedly add strength and value to the obligatory struggle on behalf of the entire Land of Israel.\\" The announcement of his support of Rabbi Kahane and his letter were made available to the Jewish Telegraphic Agency. According to his student Rabbi Uzi Kalheim, however, Rabbi Zvi Yehuda Kook's support of Rabbi Kahane was more nuanced. The rabbi approved of Kahane's activities in the U.S. to protect Jews and bolster Jewish pride. But in Israel, Rabbi Zvi Yehuda did not agree with Kahane's positions. He felt that Rabbi Kahane should be able to serve in the Knesset and express his opinions there, but he himself did not agree with his views. He explicitly wrote that his support for Kahane was \\"without any identification with or connection to the specifics of his words and aims\\". Rabbi Kook's view was that Israel's struggle with the Arabs over the Land of Israel is a national one. The rights of individual minorities, however, must be respected. Thus, when the Israeli High Court ruled that the Elon Moreh group of settlers had to evacuate lands of the Rujeib village, which was under Palestinian ownership, the rabbi told his followers to abide by the court's verdict, even though his ideological view was that \\"there is no such thing as Arab land in Eretz Israel.\\" Benny Katzover recalled: \\"The rabbi told us several times, 'We cannot damage land belonging to Ahmad and Mustafa', that we couldn't touch lands that had belonged to Arabs for generations.\\" Rabbi Kook's approach is also apparent in a letter he wrote in 1947. The rabbi lodged a complaint with the principal and teachers at a Jewish school in Jerusalem after he witnessed a group of students physically and verbally harassing two Arab street vendors. \\"I was deeply pained and ashamed at what I saw\\", Rabbi Kook wrote. \\"This incident, which pained and embarrassed me, requires me to inform you of the need for particular attention to educate against such actions. Students must be taught that such behavior is prohibited - both due to the essential teachings of Torah, Judaism, and morality, and also due to the practical value for the Jewish community and maintaining peaceful relations with neighbors.\\" Settlement movement Sometimes called the \\"prophet of Greater Israel,\\" Rabbi Zvi Yehuda Kook was the leader of the now defunctEncyclopaedia Judaica: Volume 8, p. 145 settler movement, Gush Emunim. Their beliefs are based heavily on the teachings of Rabbi Zvi Yehuda's father, Rabbi Abraham Kook. The two rabbis taught that secular Zionists, through their conquests of the Land of Israel (Eretz Yisrael), had unwittingly brought about the beginning of the \\"final redemption\\", which would end in the coming of the Jewish messiah. Gush Emunim supporters believe that building Jewish settlement on land God has allotted to the Jewish people as outlined in the Hebrew Bible, is an important step in the process of redemption. Like his father, Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook, Kook (whom some called \\"the Father of the Return to Judea and Samaria\\") did not advocate aggressive conquest.Judaism and the ethics of war, Norman Solomon. International Review of the Red Cross. Volume 87, Number 858, June 2005 Teaching emunah Rabbi Zvi Yehuda Kook rarely gave lectures in the traditional yeshiva subjects of Halakha and Gemarah. This was not due to lack of knowledge, as his writings readily prove his expertise in these topics. Rather, he felt that his goal is to teach Emunah (Jewish thought). Once, a student asked him to deliver a Gemarah lecture, and the rabbi refused, explaining that his life project is to teach Emunah. His attitude to Emunah was influenced by his father, Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook. Rabbi Kook (the father) wrote frequently about the need to study Emunah, especially in our generation. One notable example is the essay titled, \\"Me'at Tzori\\" in his book Eder Haykar. In many yeshivot, there is little or no study of Emunah texts. In the Mercaz HaRav yeshiva, where Rabbi Zvi Yehuda served as the yeshiva's dean for many years, there are many lectures on this topic, and students devote around one hour a day studying Emunah. Attitude toward earlier rabbinic authorities Rabbi Tzvi Yehuda held the previous generations of rabbis in the highest regard. He would quote the Talmudic proverb: \\"If the earlier generations were like angels, then we are like people. And if the earlier generations were like human beings, then we are like donkeys.\\"Shabbat (Talmud) 112b In his writings, there are references to many of the major rabbis of earlier generations. For example, in the book Mitoch Hatorah Hagoelet, he wrote that the first Rebbe of Chabad, the author of the Tanya, was a \\"great man\\", but the Vilna Gaon was even greater. Students The most well known among his students are rabbis Shlomo Aviner, Zvi Thau, Zalman Melamed, Yitzchak Sheilat, Avihu Schwartz, Dov Lior, Zephaniah Drori, Issar Klonsky, Haim Steiner, Yoel Bin-Nun, Eliezer Melamed, David Samson, Moshe Ganz, Nachum Romm, Haim Drukman, Aharon Shear-Yashuv, Moshe Levinger, and Yaakov Ariel. Several of these students are among those who he encouraged to establish settlements and moshavim. Numerous yeshivas in Israel follow his teachings, primarily Mercaz HaRav. Writings Most of the younger Kook's published works were editions and collections of his father's work, but many of his original articles and letters were later collected and published in book form. * Collections of articles: Or Lenetivati, Lenetivot Israel, two volumes. * Collections of letters: Tzemach Tzvi, Dodi Litzvi.

The duchy's territory roughly covered the present-day German districts of Cleves (northern part), Wesel and the city of Duisburg, as well as adjacent parts of the Limburg, North Brabant and Gelderland provinces in the Netherlands.  History  In the early 11th century Emperor Henry II entrusted the administration of the Klever Reichswald, a large forested area around the Kaiserpfalz at Nijmegen directly subordinate to the Imperial rule, to local Lower Lorrainian nobles at Geldern and Kleve. A County of Cleves (; ) was first mentioned in the 11th century. In 1417, the county became a duchy. Upon the death of Count Johann in 1368, the fief was inherited by his nephew Adolf III of the Marck. Cleves and the Marck were finally ruled in personal union by the House of La Marck after Adolf's elder brother Count Engelbert III had died without issue in 1391. King Sigismund of Germany raised Count Adolph I to the status of a duke and a Prince of the Holy Roman Empire in 1417. Schwanenburg Castle, Cleves The Cleves-Mark territories became one of the most significant estates of the Lower Rhenish‚ÄìWestphalian Circle in 1500, rivaled by the Prince-Bishops of M√ºnster. In 1511 John III of La Marck, son of Duke John II of Cleves, by his marriage with Maria inherited the fiefs of J√ºlich and Berge upon the death of his father-in-law Duke William IV. When John III succeeded his father as Duke of Cleves in 1521, the states of J√ºlich, Berge, Cleves and Mark formed the United Duchies of J√ºlich-Cleves-Berg. His daughter Anne of Cleves (1515‚Äì1557) even became Queen Consort of England for a few months in 1540, as her brother William, duke since 1539, quarrelled with Emperor Charles V over the possession of Guelders and sought support from King Henry VIII. When the last duke of J√ºlich-Cleves-Berge died issueless in 1609, the War of the J√ºlich succession broke out. The lands were finally divided between the Wittelsbach dukes of Palatinate-Neuburg (J√ºlich and Berge) and the Margraviate of Brandenburg, who gained Cleves with Mark and Ravensberg according to the 1614 Treaty of Xanten. The Hohenzollern margraves thereby got a first foothold in the Rhineland; however, large parts of the Duchy of Cleves were occupied by the United Provinces until the Franco-Dutch War in 1672. Finally incorporated into Brandenburg-Prussia by the Great Elector Frederick William I of Brandenburg in 1666 and part of the Kingdom of Prussia after 1701, Cleves was occupied by French forces in the Seven Years' War (1757‚Äì1762). In 1795 the Duchy of Cleves west of the Rhine and Wesel was occupied by France, and became part of the French d√©partement of the Roer. The rest of the duchy was occupied between 1803 and 1805, and became part of the d√©partement of Yssel-Sup√©rieur and the puppet-state Grand Duchy of Berg (after 1811, the d√©partement of Lippe). In 1815, after the defeat of Napoleon, the duchy became part of the Prussian Province of J√ºlich-Cleves-Berg, which merged in the Prussian Rhine Province in 1822. The cities Gennep, Zevenaar, and Huissen became part of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands as a result of the 1815 Congress of Vienna.

It provides acute hospital services to the residents of the western and central portions of Berkshire, and is managed by the Royal Berkshire NHS Foundation Trust. The hospital provides approximately 813 inpatient beds (627 acute, 66 paediatrics and 120 maternity), together with 204-day beds and spaces. In doing so, it employs over 5,000 staff and has an annual budget of ¬£228 million. History The original frontage of the Royal Berkshire Hospital The Royal Berkshire Hospital was opened in 1839 on the London Road on land donated by Henry Addington, 1st Viscount Sidmouth, a local resident and former Prime Minister. The hospital was built by local architect and builder Henry Briant, who won the design competition. King William IV took a keen interest in the hospital before it was built and as a consequence, his arms appear on the central pediment, although he died before the hospital opened. The first patron of the hospital was William's niece and successor, Queen Victoria. In the 1860s, the original building was extended with east and west wings designed by Joseph Morris. In the 1880s, a new chapel was added to the rear of the main block, together with long side wings. Both chapel and side wings were also designed by Morris. In 1993, the Royal Berkshire and Battle Hospitals NHS Trust was formed, to manage both the Royal Berkshire Hospital and Battle Hospital, the town's other general hospital. On 24 February 2006, The Queen accompanied by The Duke of Edinburgh opened the new buildings of the Royal Berkshire Hospital. This was to celebrate the completion of an eight-year project to move the Battle Hospital services onto the Royal Berkshire Hospital site. In August of the same year, the trust became an NHS Foundation Trust under the name of Royal Berkshire NHS Foundation Trust, reflecting both its new status and the closure of Battle Hospital. In 2008, the hospital was awarded 'Excellent' for its use of resources and 'Good' for the quality of its services in the Healthcare Commission's annual health check of all the hospitals within the National Health Service. The accident and emergency department is consistently one of the most efficient in the country, with more than 99% of patients being seen and treated, admitted or discharged within four hours. In August 2010, it was reported that the number of jobs in the hospital would be reduced by 600, out of a total of around 4,000, to achieve a saving of ¬£60 million. In October 2013, as part of a screening process by the Care Quality Commission, based on existing data and intended for use in prioritising inspections, the Trust was put into the highest risk category. On 5 March 2020, a patient at the Royal Berkshire Hospital was the first confirmed UK fatality from the COVID-19 pandemic. Buildings The endoscopy (white) and maternity blocks (yellow) The hospital occupies a long thin site, running gently uphill from London Road to Addington Road, and flanked by Craven Road and Redlands Road. The buildings that house the hospital are of various ages, from the original building of 1839 to the latest ward block built in 2006. Despite the various ages and styles of building, almost all of the hospital's departments are accessible from a single indoor pedestrian route that runs the length of the site. The original entrance on London Road still exists, but the main entrance is now situated in Craven Road, roughly at the midpoint of this route. The original building of 1839, together with the wings added in the 1860s, are now listed grade II* by English Heritage. They are built of Bath Stone with slate roofs, and the main building comprises 2 storeys and a basement. The frontage has 11 bays, with the central 7 bays forming a projecting pedimented hexastyle portico with Ionic columns. Berkshire Medical Heritage Centre Amongst the buildings within the hospital complex is the old laundry, built in 1881. This now houses the museum of the Berkshire Medical Heritage Centre, which contains 3,000 artefacts relating to medicine, surgery, nursing, midwifery, pharmacy and dentistry. Some of the exhibits date back to the 17th century. Notable patients *In 1931, the famous fighter pilot Douglas Bader had both legs amputated in the hospital by the surgeon Leonard Joyce, after an aircrash at Woodley Aerodrome.

A., & Einstein, G. O. (2007). Prospective memory: An overview and synthesis of an emerging field . Sage Publications Ltd. Prospective memory tasks are common in daily life and range from the relatively simple to extreme life-or-death situations.Levent. A & Davelaar E.J. (2019) Illegal drug use and prospective memory: A systematic review. Drug and Alcohol Dependence, 204, 107478. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2019.04.042 Examples of simple tasks include remembering to put the toothpaste cap back on, remembering to reply to an email, or remembering to return a rented movie. Examples of highly important situations include a patient remembering to take medication or a pilot remembering to perform specific safety procedures during a flight. In contrast to prospective memory, retrospective memory involves remembering people, events, or words that have been encountered in the past.Burgess, P., Shallice, T. (1997). .The relationship between prospective and retrospective memory: Neuropsychological evidence. Cognitive models of memory (249-256). Whereas retrospective memory requires only the recall of past events, prospective memory requires the exercise of retrospective memory at a time that has not yet occurred. Prospective memory is thus considered a form of \\"memory of the future\\". Retrospective memory involves the memory of what we know, containing informational content; prospective memory focuses on when to act, rather than focusing on informational content.Baddeley, A. (Ed.). (1997). Human memory: Theory and practice. Hove, UK: Psychology Press. There is some evidence demonstrating the role of retrospective memory in the successful execution of prospective memory, but this role seems to be relatively small.McDaniel, M., Einstein, O., Graham, T., & Rall, E. (2004). Delaying execution of intentions: Overcoming the costs of interruptions. Applied Cognitive Psychology, 18. 533-547.  Types = Event-based vs. time-based  There are two types of prospective memory: event-based and time-based prospective memory.Levent. A & Davelaar E.J. (2019) Illegal drug use and prospective memory: A systematic review. Drug and Alcohol Dependence, 204, 107478. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2019.04.042 Event-based prospective memory involves remembering to perform certain actions when specific circumstances occur. For example, driving past the local library cues the remembrance of the need to return an overdue book. Time-based prospective memory involves remembering to perform an action at a particular point in time. For example, seeing that it is 10:00 PM acts as a cue to watch a favorite television show. Research performed by Sellen et al. (1997) compared event-based and time-based cues on prospective memory tasks.Sellen, A. J., Louie, G., Harris, J. E., & Wilkins, A. J. (1997). What brings intentions to mind? An in situ study of prospective memory. Memory, 4, 483-507. The experimenters gave participants a place (event-based cue) and a time (time- based cue) and were told to press a button each time those cues appeared during the study. It was found that performance on event-based tasks was better than performance on time-based tasks, even when participants took more time to think about their responses. The difference in task performance between the two types of prospective memory suggests that the intended action was better triggered by external cues of the event-based task than internal cues of the time-based task. External cues, as opposed to internal cues, act as a prompt for better performance, making it easier to complete event-based tasks. = Types of event-based prospective memory: Immediate-execute vs. delayed-execute = McDaniel et al. (2004) further distinguished event-based prospective memory into immediate-execute tasks and delayed-execute tasks. Immediate-execute tasks involve a response as soon as a particular cue is noticed, while delayed-execute tasks involve delays between the perception of the relevant cue and the performance of the intended action. Delayed-execute tasks more commonly occur in real life when circumstances of a situation prevent intermediate action once the cue has been perceived. Research was performed by McDaniel et al. (2004), in which participants completed tasks involving various delays and interruptions between cues and responses. It was demonstrated that correct performance suffered when there was a delay or interruption during a task. However, it was further shown that the use of reminders for participants eliminated the effects of the interruption task.  History and theoretical perspectives  There is great interest about the possible mechanisms and resources that underlie the workings of prospective memory.  The preparatory attentional and memory (PAM) theory  The preparatory attentional and memory (PAM) theory proposes two types of processes involved in successful prospective memory performance. The first component of this theory involves a monitoring process that begins when a person constructs an intention that is then maintained until it is performed. This monitoring component involves a capacity-consuming process, similar to those used when maintaining attention, because there is a need for the intention to be stored and maintained in memory. The second component involves the use of elements of retrospective memory processes.Smith, R., & Bayen, U. (2004). A multinomial model of event-based prospective memory. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 30. 756-777. These elements are used to differentiate between the wanted prospective memory intention and unwanted thoughts, in an attempt to keep focus on the goal and not the other options surrounding it. Retrospective memory is also used to remember specifically what intention is supposed to be performed in the future, and the monitoring process is needed to be able to remember to perform this action at the correct condition or time. According to this theory, prospective memory should be enhanced when complete attention is given to the desired task than when attention is divided among multiple tasks. Research conducted by McDaniel et al. (1998) attempted to prove that prospective memory performance is better on focused tasks as opposed to those where attention is split.McDaniel, M., Robinson, B., & Einstein, P. (1998). Prospective remembering: Perceptually driven or conceptually driven processes? Memory & Cognition, 26, 121-134. Subjects completed a prospective memory task in either a condition where full attention was given or a condition where attention was divided on other tasks. The results were consistent with the PAM theory, showing that participants' prospective memory performance was better with full attention. However, there is a lot of scepticism that the rather complex mechanisms of the PAM theory are required for all, sometimes mundane, prospective memory tasks. In research by Reese and Cherry (2002), participants formed an intention to act in the future, but were interrupted prior to acting on their intention when the cue was present. When participants were asked their thoughts at the moment of interruption, only 2% reported that they were thinking of the original intention.Reese, C. M., & Cherry, K. E. (2002). The effects of age, ability, and memory monitoring on prospective memory task performance. Aging, Neuropsychology, and Cognition, 9(2), 98-113. This demonstrated evidence against the PAM theory, that there is constant maintenance from the time of constructing the intention to acting upon it at the right circumstance.  Reflexive-associative theory  Further research conducted by Einstein and McDaniel in 1990, found that subjects during prospective memory tasks reported that their intention often \\"popped\\" into mind, instead of being constantly monitored and consciously maintained.Einstein, G.O., & McDaniel, M.A. (1990). Normal aging and prospective memory. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 16, 717‚Äì726. Another theory was proposed in 2000, called the reflexive-associative theory, which states that when people create an intention for a prospective memory task, they make an association between the target cue and the intended action. Later when the target cue occurs, the automatic associative-memory system triggers the retrieval of the intended action and brings it back into conscious awareness.McDaniel, M., & Einstein, G. (2000). Strategic and automatic processes in prospective memory retrieval: A multiprocess framework. Applied Cognitive Psychology, 14, S127-S144. Therefore, as long as the target cue occurs, the association previously made will initiate the retrieval of the intended action, regardless of whether the intention is in consciousness.  Multi-process model  Another theory that has been used to explain the mechanisms of prospective memory is the multi- process model proposed by McDaniel and Einstein (2005).Einstein, O., & McDaniel, M. (2005). Prospective memory: Multiple retrieval processes. Current Directions in Psychological Science, 14, 286-290. This theory states that prospective memory retrieval does not always need an active monitoring process but can occur spontaneously (i.e., the occurrence of a cue can cause the intention to be retrieved, even when no preparatory attentional processes are engaged). Therefore, multiple processes can be used for successful prospective memory. Further, it was believed that it would be maladaptive to rely solely on active monitoring because it requires a lot of attentional resources. This may potentially interfere with other forms of processing that are required for different tasks during the retention interval. Prospective memory cues will lead to spontaneous retrieval of an intention when at least one of four conditions is met: the cue and target action are highly associated with each other, the cue is salient, the other processes performed during the period between cue and action of the prospective memory task direct attention to relevant cue features (e.g., task appropriate processing), or the intended action is simple. Further research has found that although many aspects of prospective memory tasks are automatic, they do involve a small amount of processing.Einstein, O., McDaniel, M., Thomas, R., Mayfield, S., Shank, H., Morrisette, N., & Breneiser, J. (2005). Multiple processes in prospective memory retrieval: Factors determining monitoring versus spontaneous retrieval. Journal of Experimental Psychology, 134.327-342. An experiment conducted by Einstein et al. (2005) found that some participants performed slower on a filler task when performing a prospective memory task at the same time. Even though some of the participants did not engage in active monitoring, they showed nearly the same rate of success on the task, demonstrating the use of multiple processes for prospective memory performance.  Neuroanatomy = Frontal lobe  View of the frontal lobe (red) in the left cerebral hemisphere As prospective memory involves remembering and fulfilling an intention, it requires episodic memory, declarative memory, and retrospective memory, followed by supervisory executive functions.Martin, T., McDaniel, M.A., Guynn, M.J., Houck, J.M., Woodruff, C.C., Bish, J.P., et al. (2007). Brain regions and their dynamics in prospective memory retrieval: A MEG study. International Journal of Psychophysiology, 64, 247‚Äì258. All of these are controlled by the frontal lobe which is situated at the front of the cerebral hemisphere.Adda, C.C., Castro, L.H.M., Al√©m-Mare Silva, L.C., de Manreza, M.L.G., & Kashiara, R. (2008). Prospective memory and mesial temporal epilepsy associated with hippocampal sclerosis. Neuropsychologia, 46, 1954‚Äì1964. Studies using positron emission tomography (PET) trace a slight increase in blood flow to the frontal lobe in participants completing prospective memory tasks involving remembering a planned action, while performing other tasks.Okuda, J., Fujii, T., Yamadori, A., Kawashima, R., Tsukiura, T., Fukatsu, R., et al. (1998). Participation of the prefrontal cortices in prospective memory: evidence from a PET study in humans. Neuroscience Letters, 253, 127‚Äì130.Burgess, P.W., Scott, S.K., & Frith, C.D. (2003). The role of the rostral frontal cortex (area 10) in prospective memory: a lateral versus medial dissociation. Neuropsychologia, 41, 906‚Äì918.Burgess, P.W., Quayle, A., & Frith, C.D. (2001). Brain regions involved in prospective memory as determined by positron emission tomography. Neuropsychologia, 39, 545‚Äì555. During these procedures, sites of brain activation include the prefrontal cortex, specifically the right dorsolateral, ventrolateral, and medial regions, as well as the median frontal lobe. The prefrontal cortex is responsible for holding the intention in consciousness and suppressing other internal thoughts. The median frontal lobe keeps attention focused on the planned action instead of the other tasks. The prefrontal cortex is involved mainly in event-based as opposed to time-based prospective memory.Cheng, H., Wang, K., Xi, C., Niu, C., & Fu, X. (2008). Prefrontal cortex involvement in the event-based prospective memory: Evidence from patients with lesions in the prefrontal cortex. Brain Injury, 22(9), 697‚Äì704. Cheng et al. (2008) had participants with lesions in the prefrontal cortex perform event-based and time-based prospective memory tasks. They found that performance was impaired in the event-based tasks, which use event cues to trigger intentions, but not in the time-based tasks which use time cues to trigger intentions. Other lesion studies have also shown the use of the frontal lobe in remembering and focusing on intentions. Burgess et al. (2000) studied patients with lesions to areas in the frontal lobe such as Brodmann's area 10, finding that these patients failed to follow instructions and switch attention during prospective memory tasks.Burgess, P.W., Veitch, E., de Lacy Costello, A., & Shallice, T. (2000). The cognitive and neuroanatomical correlates of multitasking. Neuropsychologia, 38, 848-863.  Parietal lobe  View of the parietal lobe (red) in the left cerebral hemisphere The parietal lobe is typically involved in processing sensory information and is situated in the superior region of the brain. For prospective memory, the parietal lobe is important for recognizing cues that trigger an intended action, especially when the cues are visual or spatial. The parietal lobe is also responsible for maintaining attention on the intended action and inhibiting other activities during performance.Kondo, K., Maruishi, M., Ueno, H., Sawada, K., Hashimoto, Y., Ohshita, T., et al. (2010). The pathophysiology of prospective memory failure after diffuse axonal injury ‚Äì Lesion symptom analysis using diffusion tensor imaging. BMC Neuroscience, 11, 147-154. Studies using PET have shown that the parietal lobe is activated when participants engage in prospective memory tasks involving visual information such as remembering a series of numbers.Coull, J.T., Frith, C.D., Frackowiak, R.S.J., & Grasby, P.M. (1996). A fronto-parietal network for rapid visual information processing: a PET study of sustained attention and working memory. Neuropsychoogia, 34(11), 1085-1095.Pardo, J.V., Fox, P.T, & Raichle, M.E. (1991). Localization of a human system for sustained attention by positron emission tomography. Nature, 349, 61-65. Activation of the parietal lobe is also evident in studies using magnetoencephalography (MEG) which traces electric activity of the brain. Harrington et al. (1998) found that neural areas ranging from the inferior parietal cortex to the frontal gyri are involved in temporal monitoring during time-based prospective memory tasks.Harrington, D.L., Haaland, K.Y., & Knight, R.T. (1998). Cortical networks underlying mechanisms of time perception. The Journal of Neuroscience, 18(3), 1085‚Äì1095. Patients with damage to these areas of the brain had difficulty judging duration and frequency of auditory tones that were presented. Keeping track of information over time is important for prospective memory, remembering intentions to perform in the future.  Limbic system  Much of the limbic system, which contains primitive brain structures relating to emotion and motivation, are involved in memory.LeDoux, J.E. (1993). Emotional memory systems in the brain. Behavioural Brain Research, 58, 69-79. :* Hippocampus ::View of the hippocampus (red) in the left and right cerebral hemispheres The hippocampus is found in the medial temporal lobe and plays an extensive role in memory retrieval. For prospective memory, the hippocampus is responsible for searching for the intended action among other memories. Studies using PET show activation in the hippocampus during event-based and time-based prospective memory tasks. :: Adda et al. (2008) assessed patients with episodic memory impairment due to epilepsy associated with mesial temporal sclerosis. Patients with this disorder have damage in the medial temporal lobe and hippocampus. Their performance on both event-based and time-based prospective memory tasks was significantly impaired. Their prospective memory performance was also worse than that of the control group after immediate, 30-minute, and seven-day delays, but was especially noticeable after the long delays because the patients could not maintain information for long periods of time. Patients also suffered in their speed of processing, disregarding distractions, and episodic memory. :: The same impairment in prospective memory is also seen in patients with lesions to the hippocampus. Damage to the left hippocampus has shown to have a worse effect on prospective memory than damage to the right hippocampus. While the hippocampus as a whole may be involved in prospective memory, the left side plays more of a dominant role. This shows the complexity of the brain and more research is needed to further understand the role of each section. :* Parahippocampal region ::View of the parahippocampal gyrus (red) in the left cerebral hemisphere The parahippocampal gyrus surrounds the hippocampus. Sensory information passes from cortical areas, through the parahippocampal gyrus to the hippocampus.Dickerson, B.C., & Eichenbaum, H. (2010). The episodic memory system: Neurocircuitry and disorders. Neuropsychopharmacology Reviews, 35, 86-104. The parahippocampal gyrus is activated during prospective memory tasks as shown by Kondo et al. (2010) who used diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging to trace the amount of water flow throughout the brain. This region is believed to play a role in recognizing cues that trigger the performance of intended actions. :: Studies using PET have come to the same conclusions regarding the use of the parahippocampal gyrus for prospective memory.Dolan, R.J., & Fletcher, P.C. (1997). Dissociating prefrontal and hippocampal function in episodic memory encoding. Nature, 388(7), 582-586. The parahippocampal gyrus is activated in paired-associate prospective memory tasks, in which participants must learn a pair of words and be able to remember one half of the word pair in later trials. It is suspected that the parahippocampal gyrus is additionally involved in monitoring the novelty of presented stimuli. If not monitored properly, new stimuli can be distracting during attempts to remember intentions for the future. :* Thalamus View of the thalamus (red) in the left and right cerebral hemispheres :: The thalamus is also located near the hippocampus. It relays sensory information among cortical areas of the brain, mediating the responses of cells and attentional demands.Sherman, S.M., & Guillery, R.W. (2002).The role of the thalamus in the flow of information to the cortex. Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B, 357, 1695‚Äì1708. During successful prospective memory tasks, PET shows that the thalamus is activated when intention cues are presented and acted upon. No activity is shown in conditions where participants are expecting the cues to appear. Therefore, it is likely that the thalamus helps to maintain intentions and execute intentions only at the appropriate time. :* Anterior and posterior cingulate View of the cingulate (red) in the left cerebral hemisphere :: The cingulate is another structure associated with the hippocampus. Its role in memory function is relaying information between the hippocampus and cortical areas.Andreasen, N.C., O'Leary, D.S., Cizadilo, T., Arndt, S., Rezai, K., Watkins, G.L., et al. (1995). PET studies of memory: novel vs. practised free recall of word lists. Neuroimage, 2, 296-305. The anterior and posterior cingulate are involved in planning and creating intentions, which are initial stages in prospective memory. Lesions in the left anterior cingulate lead to failing to recall intentions, especially after a delay, which is needed for later stages of prospective memory.  Testing methods  Methods that test prospective memory require the distinction between retrospective memory, which is remembering information, and prospective memory, which is remembering information for the future. Prospective memory requires retrospective memory because one must remember the information itself in order to act in the future. For example, remembering to buy groceries after work (prospective memory) requires the ability to remember what type of groceries are needed (retrospective memory). While prospective memory and retrospective memory are connected, they are distinguishable. This makes it possible to separate these two processes during tests.  Self-report  :* Early self-report measures ::Many early measures of memory did not account for the distinction between prospective and retrospective memory.Crawford, J.R., Smith, G., Maylor, E.A., Sala, S.D., & Logie, R.H. (2003). The Prospective and Retrospective Memory Questionnaire (PRMQ): Normative data and latent structure in a large non-clinical sample. Memory, 11(3), 261-275. For example, the Cognitive Failures Questionnaire created by Broadbent et al. (1982) consists of 25 questions with only two relating to prospective memory. The Everyday Memory Questionnaire created by Sunderland et al. (1984) contains 18 questions with only three relating to prospective memory. :* The Prospective and Retrospective Memory Questionnaire (PRMQ) ::The Prospective and Retrospective Memory Questionnaire (PRMQ) was developed by Smith et al.

Memory, 8(5), 311-321. to measure self- reports of prospective and retrospective memory in patients with Alzheimer's disease. It is a questionnaire consisting of 16 items; in which participants rank how often memory failure occurs using a 5-point scale (Very Often, Quite Often, Sometimes, Rarely, and Never). The PRMQ equally assesses three variables: prospective and retrospective memory, short-term memory and long- term memory, and self-cued and environmentally-cued memory.Crawford, J.R., Henry, J.D., Ward, A.L., & Blake, J. (2006). The Prospective and Retrospective Memory Questionnaire (PRMQ): Latent structure, normative data and discrepancy analysis for proxy-ratings. British Journal of Clinical Psychology, 45(1), 83-104. ::Since the PRMQ relies on self-report, it is limited by how participants interpret the questions, how participants perceive the strength of their own memory, and the willingness of participants to be truthful. ::The PRMQ has been proven to be a reliable and accurate method of testing memory. It has been evaluated against 10 other competing models and used for a range of different demographics including gender, education, economic status, age and country of origin.Piauilino, D.C., Bueno, O.F.A., Tufik, S., Bittencourt, L.R., Santos-Silva, R., Hachul, H., et al. (2010). The Prospective and Retrospective Memory Questionnaire: A population based random sampling study. Memory, 18 (4), 413-426. ::Many studies have used versions of the PRMQ since it was created. For example, the study by Crawford et al. (2003) used a PRMQ to test memory of a sample of the general adult population ranging in age from 17 to 94. Many questions are used to test all possible combinations of the different memory types assessed by the PRMQ. For example, questions such as \\"Do you decide to do something in a few minutes' time and then forget to do it?\\" assessed prospective memory, short-term memory, and self-cued memory. Questions such as \\"Do you repeat the same story to the same person on different occasions?\\" assessed retrospective memory, long-term memory, and environmentally-cued memory.  Prospective memory tasks  Prospective memory tasks can be used in a variety of ways to assess prospective memory. Firstly, results from these tasks can directly assess prospective memory. Furthermore, these tasks can be performed while experimenters use PET, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or MEG to monitor brain activation. Finally, these tasks can be followed by questionnaires about prospective memory. Combining different assessments can confirm or deny experimental findings, making sure that conclusions about prospective memory are accurate. All tasks can assess individual stages of prospective memory such as the formation or execution of an intention, or access prospective memory as a whole by looking at overall performance. :* Event-based prospective memory tasks ::In event- based prospective memory tasks, participants are asked to remember to perform a task when cued by the appropriate information. There are numerous possible types of event-based tasks. For example, Raskin (2009)Raskin, S.A. (2009). Memory for Intentions Screening Test: Psychometric properties and clinical evidence. Brain Impairment, 10(1), 23-33. asked participants to sign their name when given a red pen, while Adda et al. (2008) asked participants to remember to request for a personal item to be returned at the end of the experiment. :*Time-based prospective memory tasks ::In time-based prospective memory tasks, participants are asked to remember to perform a task at a certain point in time. There are also numerous possible types of time-based tasks. For example, Cheng et al. (2008) asked participants to check a clock every five minutes during a written test, while Adda et al. (2008) asked participants to remind the experimenter to pay a bill on time. :*Standardized tests ::Standardized tests have been created to uniformly test prospective memory and can incorporate different event-based and time-based tasks at the same time. Experimenters can test prospective memory by having people perform tasks in order, perform tasks in order but with interruptions, and multitask. ::A typical standardized test may include the following five steps:Einstein, G.O., & McDaniel, M.A. (2005). Prospective Memory: Multiple retrieval processes. Current Directions in Psychological Science, 14(6), 286-290. ::1) Participants are given instructions about an ongoing task and are allowed to practice. ::2) Participants are given instructions for another task involving prospective memory. ::3) Participants perform other activities during a delay between the formed intention and the presentation of the target cue. ::4) Participants are reintroduced to the first ongoing task without being reminded of the prospective memory task. ::5) The target cue is presented during the ongoing task, while the participants' memory is assessed by how many times they remember to perform the intended action from the prospective memory task. ::Standardized tests such as the Cambridge Prospective Memory Test (CAMPROMT)Fleming, J., Riley, L., Gill, H., & Gullo, M.J. (2008). Predictors of prospective memory in adults with traumatic brain injury. Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society, 14, 823‚Äì831. or the Memory for Intentions Screening Test (MIST) are written tests in which participants complete event-based and time-based tasks while performing distractor tasks such as a word search. Participants are given verbal and written instructions and are allowed to use strategies such as note-taking in order to aid memory. Their performance is scored on a scale of 1 to 18, with 18 representing highest prospective memory performance.  Technological assessments  Technological assessments were created in order to more appropriately evaluate prospective memory by combining real life intentions with experimental control. :* Virtual reality ::In virtual reality, participants perform prospective memory tasks in a virtual world on a computer. Experimenters can create event-based tasks such as remembering to label boxes as fragile before moving or time-based tasks such as allowing a removal man to enter the house in five minutes.Brooks, B.M., Rose, F.D., Potter, J., Jayawardena, S., & Morling, A. (2004). Assessing stroke patients' prospective memory using virtual reality. Brain Injury, 18(4), 391-401. All tasks involve daily and other real life actions that rely on some aspects of prospective memory. :* Prospective Remembering Video Procedure (PRVP) ::In the Prospective Remembering Video Procedure (PRVP), participants are informed that they will receive tasks to complete while watching a video on a television screen.Titov, N., & Knight, R.G. (2001). A video-based procedure for the assessment of prospective memory. Applied Cognitive Psychology, 15, 61-83. They are given a response sheet in order to record details of the tasks when the appropriate cues appear in the video. A distractor task is given at a certain point in order to test for prospective memory. Titov and Knight (2001) used a PRVP with a video consisting of a pedestrian walking through a shopping district and required participants to make decisions on whether to buy certain items as if they were the pedestrian. Shopping requires many prospective memory intentions such as remembering what items are needed and what items can be purchased another day.  Factors affecting prospective memory =Age There is an increasing amount of research on the effect of age on prospective memory where typical studies compare groups of people from different ages. A study by Smith et al. (2010) comparing event-based prospective memory in schoolchildren (7‚Äì10 years old) and young adults found that adults had better memory performance.Smith, R.E., Bayen, U., Martin, C. (2010). The cognitive processes underlying event-based prospective memory in school-age children and young adults: A formal model-based study. Developmental Psychology, 46(1), 230-244. Another study by Kvavilashvili et al. (2009) comparing time-based prospective memory among young adults (18- to 30-year-olds), young-old adults (60- to 75-year-olds) and old-old adults (76- to 90-year-olds) showed that young adults had better performance.Kvavilashvili, L., Kornbrot, D. E., Mash, V. (2009) Differential effects of age on prospective and retrospective memory tasks in young, young-old, and old-old adults. Memory, 17(2), 180-196. Event- based prospective memory was further compared between young-old and old-old adults and findings were that young-old adults performed better than old-old adults.Schnitzspahn, K. M., Kliegel, M. (2009) Age effects in prospective memory performance within older adults: the paradoxical impact of implementation intentions. European Journal of Ageing, 6, 147-155. These studies suggested that there is continual improvement of prospective memory from childhood into young adulthood but that a decline begins in late adulthood.  Genetics  A study comparing prospective memory of non- psychotic first-degree relatives of patients with schizophrenia and control participants showed that the relatives performed significantly worse on time- based and event-based prospective memory tasks.Wang, Y., Chan, R. C. K., Cui, J., Deng, Y., Huang, J., Li, H., et alYan, C., Xu, T., Ma, Z., Hong, X., Li, Z., Shi, H., Shum, D. (2010). Prospective memory in non-psychotic first-degree relatives of patients with schizophrenia. Psychiatry Research, 179, 285-290. Since schizophrenia has a heritable component, this suggested that genetics may play a role in affecting prospective memory.  Substance use  :*Smoking ::Research shows mixed findings on the effect of smoking on prospective memory, but more evidence is in favour of smoking diminishing prospective memory performance. Self-reported measures such as the Prospective and Retrospective Memory Questionnaire (PRMQ) have reported no difference between smokers and non-smokers; however, results from prospective memory tasks have suggested otherwise. Tasks are more objective as they eliminate subjective biases which can occur on the PRMQ. A study by Heffernan et al. (2010)Heffernan, T., O'Neill, T., Moss, M. (2010). Smoking and everyday prospective memory: A comparison of self-report and objective methodologies. Drug and Alcohol Dependence, 112, 234-238. suggested that persistent smoking is associated with prospective memory decrements and the impact of nicotine on long-term prospective memory may be dose dependent.Heffernan, T., Ling, J., Parrott, A. C., Buchanan, T., Scholey. A. B. (2005). Self-rated everyday and prospective memory abilities of cigarette smokers and non-smokers: a web-based study. Drug and Alcohol Dependence, 78, 235-241. Greater amounts of smoking lead to worse prospective memory performance. :*Alcohol ::Excessive drinkers self-reported more deficiencies in both short-term and long-term prospective memory on questions in the PRMQ.Heffernan, T., Clark, R., Bartholomew, J., Ling, J., Stephens, S. (2010). Does binge drinking in teenagers affect their everyday prospective memory? Drug and Alcohol Dependence, 109, 72-78. Chronic heavy alcohol users showed impaired performance on tasks including learning word lists, short- and long-term logical memory, general working memory, and abstract reasoning.Ling, J., Luczakiewicz, K., Heffernan, T., Stephens, R. (2010). Subjective ratings of prospective memory deficits in chronic alcohol users. Psychological Reports, 106(3), 905-917. Research has also accessed the effects of binge drinking on everyday prospective memory in adolescents. Binge drinkers and non-binge drinkers participated in two prospective memory sub- scales of the PRMQ. In addition to the questionnaires, the Prospective Remembering Video Procedure (PRVP) was used to test for an objective measure of prospective memory. It was shown that increasing the amount of alcohol consumed per week was correlated with poorer prospective memory performance on the PRVP, illustrating a damaging effect of excessive drinking upon everyday prospective memory for adolescents. :*Cannabis ::Cannabis is a commonly used recreational drug derived from the plant Cannabis sativa. The drug targets the central nervous system and is associated with cognitive impairments such as deficits in decision-making, learning, and speed of processing.Bartholomew, J., Holroyd, S., Heffernan, T. (2010). Does cannabis use affect prospective memory in young adults? Journal of Psychopharmacology, 24(2), 241-246. The most consistently reported deficit among users is related to memory performance. A study by Bartholomew et al. (2010) was conducted using the PRMQ and a video-based prospective memory task to test cannabis users and non- users. Cannabis users performed significantly worse on both the PRMQ and the video-based prospective memory task, suggesting that cannabis negatively affects prospective memory. :*Ecstasy and methamphetamine ::Ecstasy: Prospective memory performance is sensitive to regular and even moderate ecstasy use.Rendell, P. G., Gray, T. J., Henry, J. D., Tolan, A. (2007). Prospective memory impairment in \\"ecstasy\\" (MDMA) users. Psychopharmacology, 194, 497-504. Ecstasy users experience generalized difficulties with prospective memoryLevent. A & Davelaar E.J. (2019) Illegal drug use and prospective memory: A systematic review. Drug and Alcohol Dependence, 204, 107478. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2019.04.042 ::Methamphetamine is a highly abused drug known commonly as \\"crystal meth\\" and chronic use is known to cause cognitive impairment.Rendell, P. G., Mazur, M., Henry, J. D. (2009) Prospective memory impairment in former users of methamphetamine. Psychopharmacology, 203, 609-616. Levent. A & Davelaar E.J. (2019) Illegal drug use and prospective memory: A systematic review. Drug and Alcohol Dependence, 204, 107478. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2019.04.042 The same researchers studying the effects of ecstasy use on prospective memory have found parallel effects of methamphetamine. Impairments in prospective memory are still recognizable in former users who have been drug-free for an average of six years.  Diseases and disorders  Many diseases and disorders negatively affect prospective memory, as well as source memory, item recognition, and temporal order memory.Edgecombe, M.S., Woo, E., Greeley, D.R. (2009). Characterizing multiple memory deficits and their relation to everyday functioning in individuals with mild cognitive impairment. Neuropsychology, 23(2), 168-177. The effects range from mild cognitive impairments to more detrimental impairments such as early onset dementia.Thompson, C., Henry, J. D., Rendell, P. G., Withall, A., Brodaty, H. (2010). Prospective memory function in mild cognitive impairment and early dementia. Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society, 16, 318-325. :*Sickle cell disease ::Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an autosomal recessive genetic blood disorder which leads to alterations in the shape of red blood cells.Bunn, H.F. (1997). Pathogenesis and treatment of Sickle Cell Disease. The New England Jounrnal of Medicine, 337, 762-769. Not only can SCD impact the immune system, but it can lead to complications with memory. Children with SCD have shown impairments in event-based prospective memory.McCauley, S.R., Pedroza, C. (2010). Event-based prospective memory in children with sickle cell disease: effect of cue distinctiveness. Child Neuropsychology, 16(3), 293-312. They may struggle with aspects of daily life that require prospective memory, such as forgetting to do homework even with a schoolbag nearby. More importantly, it is more difficult to manage the disease as they can forget about when to take medication or go to a doctor appointment. These effects can also persist into adulthood. :*Parkinson's disease ::Patients with early Parkinson's disease suffer a large enough amount of prospective memory impairment to be affected in everyday life.Foster, E. R., McDaniel, M. A., Repovs, G., Hershey, T. (2009). Prospective Memory in Parkinson disease across laboratory and self- reported everyday performance. Neuropsychology, 23(3), 347-358. These patients show impairment in the use of internal attentional strategies which are required for intention retrieval. Parkinson's disease leads to poorer performance on time-based but not event-based prospective memory tasks.Costa, A., Peppe, A., Caltagirone, C., Carlesimo, G. Prospective memory impairment in individuals with Parkinson's disease. Neuropsychology, 22(3), 283-292 For example, patients may forget to take medication at certain times of the day, but forgetting is less likely if they see the medicine bottle. :*Schizophrenia ::Schizophrenia has been shown to result in generalized prospective memory difficulties and is also associated with impairments in retrospective memory and executive functioning. Some studies have shown that retrospective memory impairment is not sufficient enough to produce the prospective memory impairment observed in schizophrenia patients.Henry, J. D., Rendell, P. G., Kliegel, M., Altgassen, M. (2007). Prospective memory in schizophrenia: Primary or secondary impairment? Schizophrenia Research, 95, 179-185. Therefore, schizophrenia leads to primary deficits in prospective memory, resulting in poor performance on both event-based and time-based prospective memory tasks.Wang, Y., Chan, R. C. K., Hong, X., Ma, Zheng., Yang, T., Guo, L., Yu, X., Li, Z., Yuan, Y., Gong, Q., Shum, D. (2008). Prospective memory in schizophrenia: Further clarifation of nature of impairment. Schizophrenia Research, 105, 114-124. Managing schizophrenia includes the use of medication and therapy techniques such as cognitive behavioral therapy. Prospective memory is extremely important for these management techniques because forgetting medication or a therapy appointment can lead to the re-immergence of schizophrenic symptoms such as hallucinations, disorganized speech, and paranoia. :*Multiple sclerosis ::Multiple sclerosis is an inflammatory disorder that results in demyelination throughout the central nervous system.Rinaldi, F., Calabrese, M., Grossi, P., Puthenparampil., Perini, P., Gallo, P. (2010). Cortical lesions and cognitive impairment in multiple sclerosis. Neurological Sciences, 31, 235-237. The relationship between the location of demyelination and cognitive impairment has not been consistently identified. Retrospective memory has been studied heavily and is known to be affected negatively by multiple sclerosis. However, a study by Rendell et al. (2006)Rendell, P. G., Jensen, F., Henry, J. D. (2007). Prospective memory in multiple sclerosis. Journal of International Neuropsychological Society, 13, 410-416. showed that prospective memory failure is not entirely due to the failure of retrospective memory, and that multiple sclerosis can lead to generalized prospective memory difficulties.  Pregnancy  The effect of pregnancy on prospective memory is still under current study. Rendell et al. (2008)Rendell, P.G., Henry, J.D. (2008). Prospective-memory functioning is affected during pregnancy and postpartum. Journal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology, 30(8), 913-919. tested the prospective memory of 20 pregnant women in the laboratory. There were no significant differences observed between pregnant and non-pregnant women for event-based prospective memory tasks, but there were clear hindrances in performance for pregnant women in time-based prospective memory tasks such as a job deadline. Pregnant women are more likely to remember to perform an intention after the cue has already passed. Further, women tested a few months after giving birth were found to forget intentions entirely. Both these findings may be related to stress encountered during pregnancy or child rearing and lack of sleep.  Emotional target cues  Emotional target cues have been shown to eliminate age differences in prospective memory. For older participants, emotional prospective memory cues were better remembered than neutral cues. Whether the cues are positive or negative, strong emotional attachment makes the cue more self-relevant and easier to remember. For example, an aversive picture of a snake biting a person or a positive picture of a dog licking its owner are easier to remember because they evoke emotional responses, as opposed to a neutral picture of an animal that does not evoke an emotional response. It is speculated that the amygdala and hippocampus may play a role in this emotionally enhanced memory effect.Altgassen, M., Philips, L. H., Henry, J. D., Rendell, P. G., Kliegel, M. (2010). Emotional target cues eliminate age differences in prospective memory. The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology, 63(3), 1057-1064.  Motivational incentives  In a study by Kliegel et al. (2008),Kliegel, M., Brandenberger, M., Aberle, I. (2008). Effect of motivational incentives on prospective memory performance in preschoolers. European Journal of Developmental Psychology, 7(2), 223-232. it was shown that motivational state affected performance in two age groups (three-year-olds and five-year-olds) completing the same prospective memory task. There was no difference for the two age groups when motivation was high but performance of the three years old was reduced when motivation was low. If a person considers a task to be unimportant or is affected by fatigue, they will not be motivated to remember the intention. Less attention will be given to relevant cues and the memory is more likely to be forgotten. Therefore, prospective memory can be enhanced by avoiding low motivational states.  Everyday prospective memory  Various studies have reported that 50-80% of all everyday memories are, at least in part, related to prospective memory.Kliegel, M., Martin, M. (2010). Prospective memory research: Why is it relevant? International Journal of Psychology, 38(4), 193-194. Prospective memory is crucial for normal functioning since people form future intentions and remember to carry out past intentions on a daily basis. Numerous aspects of daily life require prospective memory, ranging from ordinary activities such as remembering where to meet a friend, to more important tasks such as remembering what time to take medication.  Time management  There is a complicated relationship between prospective memory and time management skills which include making lists, scheduling activities, and avoiding interruptions. Studies have not identified distinct cause and effect relationships between prospective memory and time management, but many consistent correlations have been observed. For example, people who reported better prospective memory according to the Prospective and Retrospective Memory Questionnaire (PRMQ) also indicated a higher likelihood of setting goals and priorities and being more organized.Macan, T., Gibson, J.M., Cunningham, J. (2010). Will you remember to read this article later when you have time? The relationship between prospective memory and time management. Personality and Individual Differences, 48, 725-730. There may be a cyclical effect between prospective memory and time management: better memory may lead to better organization, and better organization may further lead to better memory.  Aviation  Aviation controllers are often occupied with multiple tasks at the same time, and hazardous effects can occur when prospective memory fails. In an accident in 1991, a tower controller in an airport forgot a step in a simple procedure and that led to two planes crashing into each other, killing a number of passengers and crew.Stone, M., Dismukes, K., Remington, R. (2001). Prospective memory in dynamic environments: Effects of load, delay, and phonological rehearsal. Memory, 9(3), 165-176. An analysis of over 1300 fatal aviation accidents from 1950-2009 showed that the majority were due to pilot error: 50% attributed to pilot error, 6% due to non-pilot human error, 22% to mechanical failure, 12% to bad weather, 9% to sabotage, and 1% to other causes.PlaneCrashInfo.com, \\"Statistics: Causes of Fatal Accidents by Decade\\", 2011.  Nursing  The nursing environment is full of event-based and time- based prospective memory tasks. Simple tasks such as remembering to order a drug or calling patient's family and remembering when to switch shifts are just some examples of a nurse's reliance on prospective memory. It is surprising that not much research has been done concerning the importance of prospective memory in nurses since they face many life-threatening tasks.Wolf, L, Potter., Sledge, J. Bowerman, S., Grayson, D., Evanoff, B. (2006) Describing nurses' work: combing quantitative and qualitative analysis. Human Factors, 48(1), 5-14.  Contraception  Prospective memory is required to remember when to take oral contraceptive pills. A study performed by Matter and Meier (2008)Matter, S., and Meier, B. (2008). Prospective memory affects satisfaction with the contraceptive pill. Contraception, 78(2), 120-124. showed that women who self-reported higher prospective memory ability were more satisfied with oral contraceptive use and experienced lower stress levels. Having better memory makes it is easier for these women to remind themselves to take their contraceptives at the required time of the day.  Smartphones  With advancements in technology, Smartphones can serve as prospective memory aids. Electronic calendars are of great use in time-based prospective memory tasks and recently they have been shown to also cue event- based tasks. The iPhone, as well as phones using the Android operating system, can track the user's location using the phone's Global Positioning System (GPS) and send reminders based on the current location.Apple support pages, \\"Using Reminders\\", http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4970Svoboda, E., Richards, B., Polsinelli, A., Guger, S. (2010). A theory-driven training programme in the use of emerging commercial technology: Application to an adolescent with severe memory impairment. Neuropsychological Rehabilitation, 20(4), 562-586. For example, when a parent is near their children's school, the phone can send a reminder for them to pick up their children after school.  Education  Prospective memory has been implicated in the steering cognition model of how children coordinate their attention and response to learning tasks in school. Walker and Walker showed that pupils able to adjust their prospective memory most accurately for different curriculum learning tasks in maths, science and English were more effective learners than pupils whose prospective memory was fixed or inflexible.  Prospective person memory  Attempts to find wanted or missing individuals through public alert systems sometimes make use of a type of event based prospective memory called prospective person memory.Lampinen, J.M., Arnal, J.D., & Hicks, J.L. (2009). Prospective person memory. In M. Kelley (Ed.) Applied Memory. (pp. 167-184). Hauppauge NY: Nova. In prospective person memory, a picture of a wanted or missing person is presented to the public with instructions to report any sightings of the individual to authorities. Field experiments show that prospective person memory is often quite poor.Lampinen, J.M., Curry, C., & Erickson, W.B. (2015).

Vara is a former Vice-Chairman of the Conservative Party. In 2006, he was appointed to the shadow ministerial post of Shadow Deputy Leader of the House of Commons. He previously held Parliamentary Under Secretary of State roles at the Ministry of Justice and Department of Work and Pensions, before being appointed to the Northern Ireland Office (NIO) under Karen Bradley in January 2018. Vara resigned as an NIO minister in November 2018 over the Government's proposed Brexit agreement. Early life Born in Uganda to Gujarati Indian immigrants, Vara moved to Britain with his family in 1964 when he was four and had a Hindu upbringing.https:www.timesofindia.com/world/uk/15-indian-origin-mps-in-new-uk- parliament/amp_articleshow/72550708.cms Educated at Aylesbury Grammar School and Brunel University, Vara qualified as a solicitor.

As Vice- Chairman of the Party, he had a broad range of responsibilities. These included advising Michael Howard, deputising for the Party chairman, party spokesman with the media and looking after Conservative Future (which comprises the 10,000 or so people in the party under 30). Vara was elected Member of Parliament for North West Cambridgeshire in May 2005. He had previously contested the Birmingham Ladywood seat at the 1997 general election, which Labour's Clare Short won easily, and Northampton South in the 2001 general election, which Vara failed to win by only 885 votes. At the Conservative Party Conference in 2000, he was awarded the accolade of official \\"rising star\\" of the Party, with Lord Alexander of Weedon describing him as a \\"future Conservative Party leader\\".'Rising star' hopes for Westminster ascent, BBC News, 28 May 2001 In the run-up to the 2001 general election, Vara was a member of the Party's manifesto teams for Law and Order and Legal Affairs. On 30 June 2016, Vara confirmed his support for Michael Gove in the impending Conservative leadership contest. Vara said \\"I have worked very closely with Michael Gove at the Ministry of Justice and have been very impressed with him. He is a man of conviction with a very sharp intellect. He cares passionately about Britain and I believe he has the necessary qualities to lead our negotiations with the EU.\\" In the 2019 Conservative leadership election, he initially backed the ultimately-aborted candidacy of Dominic Raab. Breast Cancer Bill The Breast Cancer Bill was Vara's chosen issue after he was one of 20 MPs who were selected at random to introduce a private member's bill to the House of Commons in 2006. He has campaigned to broaden the age of routine breast cancer screening for women from the present 50‚Äì70 age group to 45‚Äì75 years. The proposal was not supported by the government, which Vara claimed effectively blocked its progress by talking through to the end of the debate. Vara has given his backing to Breast Cancer Campaign's (BCC) award-winning national \\"wear it pink\\" day, and showed his support for breast cancer charity Breakthrough Breast Cancer at a meeting in the House of Commons.Wear it pink for cancer campaign, Peterborough Telegraph, 24 October 2006 Resignation as Northern Ireland Minister Early on 15 November 2018, Vara announced his resignation as a Northern Ireland Minister on Twitter, posting his letter of resignation. His resignation followed the previous day's marathon-length cabinet meeting to discuss the draft Brexit withdrawal agreement. Vara was opposed to Brexit prior to the referendum on the UK's continued EU membership in June 2016. However, Vara resigned from his role at the Northern Ireland Office as he did not believe the Government's proposed exit agreement honoured the outcome of the referendum.

After returning to England, she attended Twizzletwig School in Hindhead, Surrey, and then Malvern Girls' College, before deciding against studying at university. She spent time with her brother in Montreal in 1924, where she met Randall Lane. They were married in Didsbury in 1926, and later lived in Manchester. They had a son in 1928 who had a mental disability and died in his teenage years. Career After Lane's husband decided to become a barrister, they both studied the law at the same time. She was called to the bar at the Inner Temple in 1940, where she later became a bencher in 1966. She joined the Midland Circuit and was appointed King's Counsel in 1950, the third female KC in England after Rose Heilbron and Helena Normanton took silk the previous year. She was Assistant Recorder of Birmingham from 1953 to 1961 and then Recorder of Derby until 1962. In 1962 she was appointed as the first female judge in the County Court. Three years later she became the first woman to sit in the High Court, assigned to the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division, and was appointed a Dame Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire, corresponding to the customary knighthood received on appointment by a male High Court judge. From 1971 to 1973, she chaired a committee which investigated the operation of the Abortion Act. Retirement Her husband became legal adviser to the British Council and died in 1975. Lane retired in 1979, and moved to Winchester. She continued to sit on the Court of Appeal from time to time. She became an honorary fellow of Newnham College, Cambridge in 1986. She died in Winchester in 1988, aged 82.

Medicine Maternal impression, according to a long-discredited medical theory, was a phenomenon that explained the existence of birth defects and congenital disorders. The theory stated that an emotional stimulus experienced by a pregnant woman could influence the development of the fetus. For example, it was sometimes supposed that the mother of the Elephant Man was frightened by an elephant during her pregnancy, thus \\"imprinting\\" the memory of the elephant onto the gestating fetus. Mental problems, such as schizophrenia and depression, were believed to be a manifestation of similar disordered feelings in the mother. For instance, a pregnant woman who experienced great sadness might imprint depressive tendencies onto the fetus in her womb. The theory of maternal impression was largely abandoned by the 20th century, with the development of modern genetic theory. Folklore In folklore, maternal imprinting, or Versehen (a German noun meaning \\"inadvertance\\" or as a verb \\"to provide\\") as it is usually called, is the belief that a sudden fear of some object or animal in a pregnant woman can cause her child to bear the mark of it. Oswald Spengler understood maternal imprinting to be a folkloric understanding of what he called \\"blood feeling\\" or the formation of a group aesthetic of a bodily ideal: > What is called the Versehen of a pregnant woman is only a particular and not > very important instance of the workings of a very deep and powerful > formative principle inherent in all that is of the race side. It is a matter > of common observation that elderly married people become strangely like one > another, although probably Science with its measuring instruments would > \\"prove\\" the exact opposite. It is impossible to exaggerate the formative > power of this living pulse, this strong inward feeling for the perfection of > one's own type. The feeling for race-beauty‚Äîso opposite to the conscious > taste of ripe urbans for intellectual-individual traits of beauty‚Äîis > immensely strong in primitive men, and for that very reason never emerges > into their consciousness. But such a feeling is race-forming.

The Bucks County Historical Society operates the Mercer Museum, as well as the Research Library, and Fonthill Castle, former home of the museum's founder, archeologist Henry Chapman Mercer. The museum was individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972, and was later included in a National Historic Landmark District along with the Moravian Pottery and Tile Works and Fonthill. These three structures are the only poured-in-place concrete structures built by Mercer. History Sample of tile work from the on-site production facility in the Mercer Museum Henry Mercer was a gentleman anthropologist. On a cruise up the Ruhr in early adulthood, Mercer was impressed by the eclipse of artisanal culture by industrial production, and resolved himself to preserving artifacts of preindustrial life. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Mercer collected pre-industrial hand tools and other implements of the past. He believed that the story of human progress and accomplishments was told by the tools and objects that people used and saw these time-honored crafts slowly disappearing from memory. Mercer personally designed plans for a museum to house his collection, six stories tall and cast of poured-in-place concrete. Mercer's museum was completed in 1916. In addition to tools, it displays furnishings of early America, carriages, stove plates, a gallows, antique fire engines, a whaleboat, and the Lenape Stone. The Spruance Library, which houses the Bucks County Historical Society's archive of historical research materials, is located on its third floor. In June 2011, construction was completed on a new, extensive visitors center at the front of the museum. Why concrete? The museum is one of three poured- in-place concrete structures built by Mercer. The others include his home Fonthill and the Moravian Pottery and Tile Works, both of which are located one mile from the museum. Mercer decided to build with concrete after the Great Boston Fire of 1872 destroyed his aunt's prized collection of medieval armor, which had been stored in wooden structures. He did not want his own collections to suffer the same fate. Locals mocked his choice of building materials, but on completion of the museum, he lit a bonfire on its roof to prove that it was fireproof . Mercer's museum was an early demonstration of rebar-reinforced concrete as a structural material.

It tells the story of a book titled Pleasuring: One Couple's Journey to Fulfillment and the effects it has on a family. The fictional book is a sex manual, much like The Joy of Sex. It was written by a married couple and is full of detailed illustrations of them engaged in numerous sexual positions. One day while the authors are out, their children discover the book and their lives are changed forever. The story looks at the effect the book has on their lives over the course of many decades, jumping forward decade by decade. The author tells the story by switching between the different points of view of the members of the family. The parents are unaware the children have discovered the book, so their story is very different from the children's. It also explores how each character feels about the others. For example, the husband thinks his wife is the most sexually desirable woman to him on the Earth and feels he is the luckiest man alive. On the other hand, she feels her husband is too mechanical when it comes to lovemaking, approaching it as some sort of scientific experiment.

It was Scorsese's feature film directorial debut and Keitel's debut as an actor. Exploring themes of Catholic guilt similar to those in his later film Mean Streets, the story follows Italian-American J.R. (Keitel) as he struggles to accept the secret hidden by his independent and free-spirited girlfriend (Bethune). This film was a nominee at the 1967 Chicago Film Festival. Plot J.R. is a typical Catholic Italian-American young man on the streets of New York City. Even as an adult, he stays close to home with a core group of friends with whom he drinks and carouses around. He gets involved with a local girl he meets on the Staten Island Ferry, and decides he wants to get married and settle down. As their relationship deepens, he declines her offer to have sex because he thinks she is a virgin and he wants to wait rather than \\"spoil\\" her. One day, his girlfriend tells him that she was once raped by a former boyfriend. This crushes J.R., and he rejects her and attempts to return to his old life of drinking with his friends. However, after a particularly wild party with friends, he realizes he still loves her and returns to her apartment one early morning. He awkwardly tells her that he forgives her and says that he will \\"marry her anyway.\\" Upon hearing this, the girl tells him marriage would never work if her past weighs on him so much. J.R. becomes enraged and calls her a whore, but quickly recants and says he is confused by the whole situation. She tells him to go home, and he returns to the Catholic church, but finds no solace. Cast Martin Scorsese appears in an uncredited role as a gangster. Production Who's That Knocking at My Door was filmed over the course of several years, undergoing many changes, new directions and different names along the way. The film began in 1965 as a student short film about J.R. and his do-nothing friends called Bring on the Dancing Girls. In 1967, the romance plot with Zina Bethune was introduced and spliced together with the earlier film, and the title was changed to I Call First. The film was shot with a combination of 35 mm and 16 mm cameras. Scorsese shot most of the 35 mm footage with a Mitchell BNC camera, a very cumbersome camera that impeded mobility. He opted to shoot several scenes with the 16 mm Eclair NPR camera in order to introduce greater mobility, then blow up the footage to 35 mm. Release The film received its world premiere at the Chicago International Film Festival in November 1967. Finally, in 1968, exploitation distributor Joseph Brenner offered to buy the picture and distribute it on the condition that a sex scene be added to give the film sex exploitation angles for marketing purposes. Scorsese shot and edited a technically beautiful but largely gratuitous montage of J.R. fantasizing about bedding a series of prostitutes (shot in Amsterdam, the Netherlands with a visibly older Keitel) and the film finally became Who's That Knocking at My Door (named for the 1959 song by The Genies which closes the film). The film was re-issued in February 1970 by Medford Film Distribution under the title J.R., however all subsequent releases have been published under the 1968 title. Reception American critic Roger Ebert gave the film an extremely positive review after its world premiere at the Chicago International Film Festival in November 1967 (when it still went by the name I Call First). He called the film \\"a work that is absolutely genuine, artistically satisfying and technically comparable to the best films being made anywhere. I have no reservations in describing it as a great moment in American movies.\\" When the film finally received its theatrical release two years later, Ebert admitted that he had been perhaps a little over eager with his first review, admitting that \\"Scorsese was occasionally too obvious, and the film has serious structural flaws.\\" However, he was still highly positive towards the film, and suggested that \\"It is possible that with more experience and maturity Scorsese will direct more polished, finished films.\\" As of January 2020, Who's That Knocking at My Door holds a rating of 70% on Rotten Tomatoes from 20 reviews.http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/whos_that_knocking_at_my_door Notable appearances and cameos Martin Scorsese's mother, Catherine, appears briefly as J.R.'s mother cooking at the beginning of the film and serving food near the end. Mrs. Scorsese would continue to appear in many of her son's films until her death in 1997. Scorsese himself appears uncredited as one of the gangsters. To this day, he still makes cameo appearances in many of his films. The role of Sally Gaga is played by Michael Scala, the father of rapper Pizon.

It was first published in the May 1954 issue of Universe Science Fiction, and has since been republished in several collections and anthologies, including Earth Is Room Enough (1957) and The Best Science Fiction of Isaac Asimov (1986). (In Earth Is Room Enough (Panther Books Ltd. reprint 1973 edition) the title of the story is \\"An Immortal Bard\\" in the Contents list but \\"The Immortal Bard\\" on the destination page. There is a similar, but reversed variation in title with The Author's Ordeal.) Like many of his stories, it is told as a conversation, in this case between two professors at a college faculty's annual Christmas party. It is likely that Asimov wrote this short story after seeing how literary academia viewed his own writing. His autobiography, In Memory Yet Green, describes how science fiction gradually became more \\"respectable\\", while at the same time, professors of literary studies wrote things about SF -- even about Asimov's own stories -- which he completely failed to grasp. \\"The Immortal Bard\\" is an expression of Asimov's own deep admiration for William Shakespeare which also satirizes the interpretations built upon Shakespeare's work -- such as symbolic, Freudian, and New Critical. Plot summary The physics professor, Dr. Phineas Welch, has gotten himself slightly drunk and begins speaking with Scott Robertson, a young English teacher. Welch announces, \\"I can bring back the spirits of the illustrious dead.\\" He goes on to explain that, via \\"temporal transference\\", he can bring people from the past into the present. At first, Robertson treats Welch's story as an amusing, alcohol-induced fantasy, and he begins to enjoy the conversation. Welch says that he first tried bringing eminent scientists from earlier eras‚ÄîArchimedes, Isaac Newton, Galileo Galilei. However, none of the scientists were adaptable enough to handle twentieth-century society; Welch realized that he needed to find an adaptable, universal mind. \\"So,\\" he continues, \\"I tried Shakespeare.\\" This startles and incenses Robertson, since it strikes \\"closer to home\\". Shakespeare, according to Welch, was flexible enough to understand human beings of every era, and he adjusted to the modern world much more easily. Welch reports that Shakespeare was eager to find what future generations thought of him. When Welch finds him a book of literary criticism, Shakespeare cries in exasperation, \\"God ha' mercy! What cannot be racked from words in five centuries? One could wring, methinks, a flood from a damp clout!\\" Eventually, Welch says, he enrolled Shakespeare in a night school class on Shakespeare's plays‚Äîtaught, as it happens, by Robertson. At this point, Robertson begins to become genuinely worried. He recalls a bald man with an unusual accent, and starts to doubt whether Welch's story was all alcoholic fantasy. Timidly, he asks Welch what happened, and the physicist explodes with anger. Shakespeare had been humiliated, he says, and Welch had to send him back to 1600: \\"You poor simpleton, you flunked him!\\" Asimov comments that he wrote the story to get back at English teachers. Additionally he says, that the story is really about himself. Not being able to answer most of the questions he's posed on his works, he realizes he would probably flunk a test on himself.

It includes a variety of samples ranging from differential equations to 3D-rendered Toroids and Lorenz attractors. It is also capable of dealing with functions and compositions of them. One can edit the appearance of graphs by changing line colors, adding patterns to rendered surfaces, adding comments, and changing the fonts and styles used to display them. Grapher is able to create animations of graphs by changing constants or rotating them in space.  History  Before Grapher and Mac OS X, Mac OS 9 was bundled with Pacific Tech's Graphing Calculator, a similar program to Grapher that had been included with over 20 million Macintoshes since 1994 with System 7. No versions of Mac OS X prior to Mac OS X v10.4 included a bundled graphing calculator application. On July 22, 2004, Apple bought Arizona Software's \\"Curvus Pro X,\\" and renamed it ‚ÄúGraphing Calculator‚Äù, before deciding on ‚ÄúGrapher‚Äù. The news was publicly announced on September 15, 2004 at AppleInsider. Version 2.0 of Grapher was bundled with Mac OS X v10.5, and version 2.1 with Mac OS X v10.6. It was notable for being one of the few applications bundled with 10.6 to ship without 64-bit support. As of OS X 10.9, it became a 64-bit application.  Features  Grapher is a graphing calculator capable of creating both 2D graphs including classic (linear- linear), polar coordinates, linear-logarithmic, log-log, and polar log, as well as 3D graphs including standard system, cylindrical system, and spherical system. Grapher is a Cocoa application which takes advantage of Mac OS X APIs. It also supports multiple equations in one graph, exporting equations to LaTeX format, and comes with several pre-made equation examples. It is one of the few sophisticated graphing programs available capable of easily exporting clean vector art for use in printed documents (although exporting 3D graphs to vector is not possible). Animation of graphs is also supported in both 2D and 3D, generating a QuickTime file. It is also possible to use the operating system's copy-and-paste feature to copy equations from the application's visual equation editor. By doing so, Grapher functions as something of an equation editor; the user may copy images, EPS, PDF or LaTeX versions of entered equations into other applications. Any equation can be entered and copied; it is not limited to plottable equations.  References  External links  * Usage Guide on MacRumors Category:MacOS-only software made by Apple Inc.

He is best known by his ring name The Warlord and for his tenures in National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) and the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) as one half of The Powers of Pain alongside The Barbarian. His first national exposure was in the NWA territory Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP), where Powers of Pain held the World Six-Man Tag Team Championship until they departed the company in 1988 and joined WWF, where they competed in the tag team division until the team was quietly split in 1990. Warlord then competed as a singles wrestler until departing in 1992, and had a small stint in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in 1996, where he briefly reunited with The Barbarian as The Super Assassins. Professional wrestling career=Jim Crockett Promotions (1986-1988) In 1986 while working out at a gym in Minnesota, Szopinski met its owner Joe Laurinaitis, better known as the professional wrestler Road Warrior Animal. After coming up with possible ring names with Sharkey and Animal, Szopinski adopted the \\"Warlord\\" as his ring name and sent some photos of his work to Dusty Rhodes. Soon afterwards, Rhodes hired him and he began wrestling for the National Wrestling Alliance's Jim Crockett Promotions later that year. After a brief stint in JCP, the territory's owner Jim Crockett, Jr. sent him to the Kansas City-based Central States Wrestling territory for more training. While there, he teamed with Karl Kovac and won the territory's tag team championship on June 8, 1987, in a tournament. However, he and Kovac were soon stripped of the title when Kovac was fired and Szopinski traveled to Japan for more training. In late 1987, Szopinski returned to Jim Crockett Promotions under his Warlord name and began teaming with Ivan Koloff with Paul Jones as their manager. In 1988, he then formed a permanent tag team with the Barbarian known as \\"The Powers of Pain\\", the heel counterparts to the Road Warriors, while retaining Jones as their manager. While continuing to team with Koloff, The Powers of Pain feuded heavily with The Road Warriors, and defeated them and Dusty Rhodes for the World Six-Man Tag Team Championship. To continue the feud, JCP management wanted them to do some scaffold matches against the Warriors, but this was met with opposition from Szopinski and Vailahi over fears of injury. As a result, they both left JCP and joined the World Wrestling Federation, vacating the six-man tag team title in the process. World Wrestling Federation (1988-1992) Upon their arrival in the WWF in June, the Powers were faces, initially managed by Tito Santana,Warlord and Barbarian - Demolition's Nightmare - Pro Wrestling Illustrated November 1988PWI Poll - The Powers Of Pain - Pro Wrestling Illustrated December 1988 and feuded with World Tag Team Champions Demolition (Ax and Smash), who had defeated Strike Force (Santana and Rick Martel) for the title and then injured Martel (kayfabe). Although the Barbarian had already been wearing face paint in JCP, it was at this point that the Warlord began to also use face paint. The Powers were introduced as mercenaries to help Martel and Santana gain revenge on Demolition for both the title loss and the injury to Martel. They were soon after managed by the Baron. At Survivor Series, the Powers' team defeated Demolition's team in a tag team elimination match, with the Powers being the sole survivors of their team. Near the end of the match, Demolition's manager Mr. Fuji double-crossed them and after they beat him up and left, the Powers came to his aid, gaining Fuji as their manager in the process, in return for which his interference helped the Powers eliminate the last remaining opponents, the Conquistadors. Afterwards, the Powers and Fuji celebrated until Demolition returned and drove them from the ring. As a result, the Powers became villains while Demolition became fan favorites. In 1989, Szopinski entered the Royal Rumble as the twenty-first entrant, but lasted only two seconds before being eliminated by Hulk Hogan, setting the record for shortest time spent in a Royal Rumble match. The Powers of Pain teamed with Fuji in a losing effort to Demolition in a match for the World Tag Team Championship. In March 1990, The Powers of Pain split, with Fuji selling Barbarian's contract to Bobby \\"The Brain\\" Heenan while selling Warlord's contract to Slick. After the team's split, Warlord received an attire change, where he abandoned his Road Warrior-like reverse mohawk and face paint in favor of a shaved head and a silver metallic Cyborg-style Phantom of the Opera-like half-mask and black armor. He also brought a metal staff topped with a W with him to his matches, and used it as a weapon on occasion. He began a feud with the British Bulldog leading to a match at WrestleMania VII. He was granted a chance at the world title against Hulk Hogan on February 8, 1991, in which he was defeated. He then began a long- running series of matches with the Texas Tornado, which rarely had either man winning. However, he did manage to score a singles victory over a high profile wrestler in Jake Roberts on August 23, 1991. On April 17, 1992, Szopinski lost to Virgil in his final match for the WWF. Independent circuit (1992-1995) After leaving the WWF for the independent circuit, Szopinski traveled to the CWA and lost to CWA Champion Rambo in the CWA Catch Cup 1992 on August 22, 1992 in Germany. He wrestled two additional times in the fall, losing to Rambo in a rematch and then falling to new champion Buffalo Peterson. In April 1993 Szopinski traveled to another German promotion, World Wrestling Superstars and had considerable success as he dominated Butch Reed in multiple encounters. Throughout the year he appeared in multiple other promotions, including Herb Abrams' UWF, the WWC, ECW, and WAR. In 1994 Szopinski narrowed his focused to the IWF and WAR, participating in lengthy tours with both companies. On August 26, 1994, he teamed with Bob Backlund and Scott Putski to defeat Gedo, Hiromichi Fuyuki & Jado and win the WAR Six-Man Tag Team Championship in an event held in Yokohama, Japan. They would lose the titles days later in a rematch on September 1. On September 23, 1994 the Powers of Pain reunited for the first time in over two years to compete for the vacant UWF Tag-Team Championship at UWF Blackjack Brawl. They were defeated by The Killer Bees. Szopinski and Vailahi continued their renewed partnership in 1995, traveling to the NWC where they faced the team Aerial Assault (Bob Bradley and a young Rob Van Dam). World Championship Wrestling (1995-1996) On October 11, 1995, they made their return to World Championship Wrestling. They were now dubbed the Super Assassins, wrestled under masks, and were managed by Colonel Robert Parker. The Super Assassins were defeated by The Nasty Boys in their first match. Both wrestlers participated in the three-ring battle royal in the main event of WCW World War 3 on November 26. On December 16 they earned their first victory, defeating The State Patrol on WCW Worldwide. Their last match was on the January 1, 1996 edition of Monday Nitro where they fell to Lex Luger and Sting, after which the team was disbanded. Injury and retirement (1996-2003) The Warlord was forced to retire from wrestling due to suffering neck injuries in a car accident involving a Pizza Hut delivery van in 1996. The accident caused significant life-altering injuries, including nerve damage that left one side of his body permanently disfigured. After attempting a comeback in 2001, Szopinski was sidelined yet again after suffering severe leg damage in a motorcycle accident. During his recovery, he retired from wrestling and began training as a security guard and started providing his services for Relief Group International, an auto relief group. He soon extended his services into bodyguarding, and worked alongside celebrities such as 50 Cent, Thomas Jones and Kimbo Slice, who nicknamed Szopinski the \\"Wall\\". Return to wrestling (2003-present) On January 10, 2003, Szopinski made his first wrestling- related appearance in years as he acted as a special guest referee for Hardkore Championship Wrestling in a match between Christian York and Reckless Youth, which Youth won. On January 25, he made his official in-ring return under his Warlord name and character as he defeated Joe Gomez. After wrestling regularly throughout the rest of 2003 and 2004, Warlord wrestled at the first WrestleReunion on January 29, 2005, where he competed in a battle royal for the IWA Heavyweight Championship. However, he was eliminated by Greg \\"The Hammer\\" Valentine, who would go on to win the match and the title. On April 29, 2006, he defeated Chaz to win the Maximum Xtreme Pro Wrestling Heavyweight Championship, his first singles title. In August 2012, Chikara announced that the Warlord would be making his debut for the promotion in the following month's 2012 King of Trios tournament, where he will reunite with the Barbarian and Meng as the \\"Faces of Pain\\". On September 14, the team was eliminated from the tournament in the first round by Team ROH (Mike Bennett, Matt Jackson and Nick Jackson). Two days later, on the final day of the tournament, the Barbarian and the Warlord took part in a tag team gauntlet match, from which they eliminated their old WWF rivals, Demolition, before being eliminated themselves by the 1-2-3 Kid and Marty Jannetty. Personal life Szopinski met Chris Jericho early in Jericho's career, and helped him out with food issues while they traveled together overseas and in Japan. Dave Batista cites Szopinski as his all-time favorite wrestler. In July 2016, Szopinski was named part of a class action lawsuit filed against WWE which alleged that wrestlers incurred traumatic brain injuries during their tenure and that the company concealed the risks of injury. The suit was litigated by attorney Konstantine Kyros, who has been involved in a number of other lawsuits against WWE. The lawsuit was dismissed by US District Judge Vanessa Lynne Bryant in September 2018. In other media The Warlord is the second enemy in the 1991 computer game, WWF WrestleMania.

In most versions of the game, the player can choose between playing as the Fourth, Fifth or Seventh Doctor; in the MS-DOS and Amiga versions, the player can play as the Second, Fourth or Seventh Doctor, and in the ZX Spectrum version only the Seventh Doctor was available. A second player may play as the Doctor's companion (Ace or a UNIT soldier, although in the Spectrum version only Ace is available). K-9 also makes appearances later in the game as does Davros, creator of the Daleks in the TV series, as the final end of level boss. The game is set in London, Paris, New York, Tokyo and Skaro. The game was released on all major formats of the time except for the Amstrad CPC, which was announced but never released. It was designed and storyboarded by 221B Software Development. Graphics were by John Gyarmati and Wayne Dalton. Nick Kimberley programmed the PC, Spectrum and (unreleased) Amstrad versions. The Amiga and Atari ST versions were programmed by Richard Turner. Jason Heggie was in charge of the Commodore 64 version. Music was by Paul Tankard. On the PC and Amiga versions, there was a secret room behind some blocks. The room gave some of the programming credits for each game, in particular the graphics and music. The credits were hidden in this way due to the BBC not wanting individual credits for the game development team to be included in the game. Perhaps surprisingly, the PC version, which had the most sophisticated graphics, and the ZX Spectrum version, the most basic version, were both coded by the same person. This was due to the similarities between Z80 and 8086 assembly language. Alternative Software released the ZX Spectrum version only due to popular demand, since by 1992 the Spectrum was no longer a commercially viable platform. Dalek Attack was released for the Spectrum in 1993, and was the last licensed Spectrum game. It differed from all the others in its first level; in all the other releases the first level involved the Doctor on a hoverboard going along the sewer. The Spectrum version had the Doctor on foot running around collecting hostages and avoiding globes. The Spectrum version also lost out on other features such as different enemies; only the Robomen, Ogrons and standard Daleks featured. The end-level guardians were also different. Before its release Spectrum owners who wrote to Alternative software pressing for a release received a letter back stating that the game was in production, and were sent a sticker depicting the game's box front emblazoned with the legend \\"I've Been Exterminated!\\" Other versions of the game featured special Daleks such as hovering Daleks from the TV Century 21 comics strips of the 1960s. 1960s \\"movie\\" Daleks also made an appearance, as did the special weapons Dalek from Remembrance of the Daleks. Another special Dalek also featured, based on a sketch in an article from the Doctor Who Magazine 10th anniversary special showing how a Dalek might look when the television series came back. The game was later re-released, first in a three pack compilation set called the Sci-Fi Collection with two other titles (Galactic Warrior Rats, Suburban Commando) for the PC. The front cover was in a \\"Y\\" shape with Dalek Attack in the bottom right and the instruction booklet was photocopied. This was followed in 1994/95 by another re-release, which was the same as the original except for a purple and black border added to the front and back covers.

Early career Scott was selected by the Mets in the second round of the 1976 Major League Baseball draft. He made his major league debut with the Mets in . By the end of the 1982 season, Scott had compiled a 14-27 record. The Mets traded him to the Astros for Danny Heep on December 11, . In 1983, Scott had a mostly successful first season with the Astros making 24 starts and going 10-6 with a 3.72 earned run average. Scott struggled in 1984 going 5-11 with a 4.68 ERA for the Astros. The turning point in Scott's career came in , when he became a student of pitching coach Roger Craig. Craig taught Scott the split-finger fastball, a pitch he had made famous while coaching the pitchers of the 1984 World Series champion Detroit Tigers. Scott became an 18-game winner in 1985 and was rewarded with a three-year deal with the Astros, valued at $2 million. However, there were rumors that Scott's dominating performance was the result of doctoring the baseball or cutting it or \\"scuffing\\" it. Scott had been accused of using sandpaper by the Chicago Cubs in 1985. In August 1986, Roger Craig, then the manager of the San Francisco Giants, complained that Scott's real secret was that he scuffed the baseball. \\"It's great,\\" Scott said of the charges. \\"Any time you have hitters coming to the plate thinking you're doing something, it takes their minds off the pitch . . .

This game was voted one of the top five games played in the Astrodome after the Astros moved to Enron Field following the 1999 season.Five greatest games at the Astrodome He led a strong starting rotation that included Bob Knepper, Nolan Ryan, and Jim Deshaies. Scott's outstanding form continued into the postseason, when Houston faced the Eastern Division champion New York Mets in the 1986 National League Championship Series. The Astros lost the series, 4 games to 2, but both Astros victories were courtesy of Scott's overwhelming starting pitching performances in Games 1 and 4. The Mets aggressively voiced their suspicions that Scott was doctoring the baseball to the media during the series. So dominating was Scott in those two games ‚Äî 0.50 ERA, 19 strikeouts, 8 hits and only one walk in 18 innings ‚Äî that the Mets considered Game 6 something of a \\"must win\\"; a loss would have meant facing an apparently unbeatable Mike Scott in Game 7 in the Astrodome. The Mets won Game 6 in 16 innings, averting another Scott start, to win the league pennant. In recognition of his regular season performance, Scott was awarded the 1986 National League Cy Young Award as the league's best pitcher. Scott was also voted the NL 1986 NLCS MVP, the first time in NLCS history that a member of the losing team was so honored (a year later, the San Francisco Giants' Jeffrey Leonard would become the second consecutive NLCS MVP of the losing team). Later career In , Scott was the National League starter in the All-Star Game, and threw two scoreless innings. He was also the opening day starter for the Astros. He went 16-13 with a 3.23 earned run average, eight complete games and three shutouts in 247.2 innings while finishing second in the National League with 233 strikeouts. In , Scott once more was named the Astros' opening day starter. On June 12, he was denied a second no-hitter when the Atlanta Braves' Ken Oberkfell singled to right with two outs in the ninth inning.

He grew up in Carson City, Nevada. Charlie played baseball for the Carson City High Senators. After he entered major league baseball, almost all of his career was spent with the Houston Astros. With the Astros, Kerfeld became known for a quirky sense of humor. He pitched for the Houston organization between 1985 and 1990, winning a division title with the Astros in 1986. He was in the minor leagues in 1988 and 1989 before briefly returning to the major leagues with the Houston Astros and Atlanta Braves in 1990. After his retirement, Kerfeld entered minor league baseball as a coach. He holds a front office position for the Philadelphia Phillies. Career Kerfeld was the Astros' first pick (5th overall) in the secondary phase of 1982 draft, and fared well his first year at Asheville, and his second at Columbus, with sub 3.00 ERAs and 30 wins. He led the 1983 Sally League in wins, complete games, and innings pitched, while finishing second in strikeouts, earning Pitcher of the Year honors. Though he struggled initially at the triple-A level, he eventually found his bearings and even earned a July 1985 call-up to the major league club at the age of 21. Kerfeld made the big league roster out of spring training in 1986, and had a career year posting an 11-2 record and a 2.59https://www.baseball- reference.com/players/k/kerfech01.shtml ERA as the setup man for closer Dave Smith. His unexpected performance that year was a key reason the Astros won the National League Western Division title that season. He led the National League in won-loss percentage and finished fourth in the Rookie of the Year balloting. Kerfeld capped his season by pitching four innings and giving up a run in the NLCS. He took the loss in Game 5 when Gary Carter slapped Kerfeld's twelfth-inning pitch for a single, scoring Wally Backman. Kerfeld began 1987 with the Astros, but was sent down to Tucson on April 26 after 11 games after posting an 0 ‚Äì 2 record and a 6.67 ERA. After being taken out of a May game in Tucson, Kerfeld flung the baseball, underhanded but forcefully, at Tucson manager Bob Didier. The manager fined Kerfeld and suspended him for two games. Tucson pitching coach expressed frustration with Kerfeld, saying, \\"A lot of things have been said. A lot of things have been done. But very little sinks in.\\" Later, Kerfeld walked away from the Tucson team for a day after Rocky Childress was called up to the Astros. Kerfeld thought that he should have been called up. He said that he hastily spoke to Astros general manager Dick Wagner and said things that he regretted. In mid-July, Wagner said that Kerfeld's attitude and pitching had improved and that his weight was the biggest factor keeping him from the major leagues. He went 4 ‚Äì 4 at Tucson with a 4.74, and was briefly recalled to Houston before going on the DL for two months with calcium deposits in his elbow. He pitched effectively in three games in late September, and looked to be rounding back into his stellar 1986 form. Kerfeld, battling elbow, neck and weight problems, struggled in the minors in 1988 and 1989. He was on the Astros' Opening Day 1990 roster, but appeared in only five games, going 0 ‚Äì 2 with a horrendous 16.20 ERA. His last game for the Astros was April 19, 1990. Ten days later, Kerfeld was traded to the Atlanta Braves for outfielder Kevin Dean and pitcher Lee Johnson. He pitched 30 innings in relief for the Braves that season, but was released during the offseason. He was signed by the Detroit Tigers and pitched briefly for their AA affiliate the London Tigers in 1991, but retired following that season. Antics A fan favorite, Kerfeld was known for his quirky sense of humor and bullpen antics. When asked in 1987 what he would do if he had only a week to live, Kerfeld replied, \\"I'd get Hulk Hogan, Brian Bosworth, Charles Barkley and I'd have a four-man tag team match with the Four Horsemen.\\" Pondering alternative career options after a 1988 shoulder surgery, Kerfeld said, \\"Arena Football is first. Then the World Wrestling Federation. Maybe go back to college and get a brain surgery degree. Or become an assistant clubhouse man. Or go to Harry Wendelstedt's umpiring school.\\" When Kerfeld, whose uniform number was 37, learned that Jim Deshaies had signed for US$110,000 in 1987, he asked for and received $110,037.37 plus 37 boxes of orange Jell-O. On March 1, 1987 Kerfeld declared he would buy up 3,000 tickets per game to give away to charity causes. Without a discount, which the Astros didn't discuss, the cost for the seats would total as much as $1.6 million. Unable to afford that on a $110,000 salary, Kerfeld backed down from the offer. He is remembered for his lucky Jetsons tee shirt (which he wore under his uniform when he pitched because the Jetsons' dog was named Astro) and for occasionally donning a rubber Coneheads mask in the bullpen along with fellow relievers Larry Andersen and Dave Smith. Coming to the ballpark, he often wore such things as pink high-tops and a Rambo cammies outfit. Kerfeld gained fame for giving a drunken interview live to Bill Worrell and HSE in the Astros locker room after they clinched the NL West on September 25, 1986. The display was typical of his good nature and gregarious manner. Kerfeld was seen drinking a Busch beer during the interview, and then later pouring it on Nolan Ryan while Ryan was giving an interview with Milo Hamilton. Ryan retaliated by spraying champagne in Kerfeld's face. The clip can be found on the website YouTube. Charlie or Charley? Sometime around the 1987 season Kerfeld's first name began to appear in print as \\"Charley.\\" There was no explanation offered for the change and it became a source of befuddlement to players and fans alike. For the rest of his career, and to the present day, his name is often seen spelled in both forms. Post-playing career Kerfeld remained in baseball managing in the minor leagues, including a brief stint with the Abilene Prairie Dogs of the Texas‚ÄìLouisiana League. He was the Western League manager of the year in 1998 and in 2001-02. In November 2006, he became a special assistant to the general manager for the Philadelphia Phillies. As of August 2013, Kerfeld is a senior advisor to the general manager for the team.

The term has been translated as \\"for this time only,\\" and \\"once in a lifetime.\\" The term reminds people to cherish any gathering that they may take part in, citing the fact that any moment in life cannot be repeated; even when the same group of people get together in the same place again, a particular gathering will never be replicated, and thus each moment is always a once-in- a-lifetime experience. The concept is most commonly associated with Japanese tea ceremonies, especially tea masters Sen no Riky≈´ and Ii Naosuke. History Sen no Rikyu The term can be traced back to the 16th century to an expression by tea master Sen no Riky≈´: . Riky≈´'s apprentice Yamanoue S≈çji instructs in Yamanoue S≈çji Ki to give respect to your host . Ichigo () is a Buddhist term meaning \\"from one's birth to death\\", i.e. one's lifetime. Later, in the mid-19th century, Ii Naosuke, Tair≈ç (chief administrator) of the Tokugawa shogunate, elaborated on the concept in Chanoyu Ichie Sh≈´: > Great attention should be given to a tea gathering, which we can speak of as > \\"one time, one meeting\\" (ichigo, ichie). Even though the host and guests may > see each other often socially, one day's gathering can never be repeated > exactly. Viewed this way, the meeting is indeed a once-in-a-lifetime > occasion. The host, accordingly, must in true sincerity take the greatest > care with every aspect of the gathering and devote himself entirely to > ensuring that nothing is rough. The guests, for their part, must understand > that the gathering cannot occur again and, appreciating how the host has > flawlessly planned it, must also participate with true sincerity. This is > what is meant by \\"one time, one meeting.\\" This passage established the yojijukugo (four-letter idiomatic) form ichi-go ichi-e () known today. Interpretation and usage Ichi-go ichi-e is linked with Zen Buddhism and concepts of transience. The term is particularly associated with the Japanese tea ceremony, and is often brushed onto scrolls which are hung in the tea room. The term is also much repeated in bud≈ç (martial ways). It is sometimes used to admonish students who become careless or frequently stop techniques midway to \\"try again,\\" rather than moving on with the technique despite the mistake. In a life-or-death struggle, there is no chance to \\"try again.\\" Even though techniques may be attempted many times in the dojo, each should be seen as a singular and decisive event. Similarly, in noh theater, performances are only rehearsed together once, a few days before the show, rather than the many times that are typical in the West, this corresponding to the transience of a given show. In popular culture * Romanian conductor Sergiu Celibidache's focus was on creating, during each concert, the optimal conditions for a what he called a \\"transcendent experience\\".

Eric Meyer, M.D., an anesthesiologist who designed the dual-aperture f/21 Ritchey-Chretien telescope, and his wife, Barbara, donated $1 million and brought the optical components personally from Chicago. The optical/infrared telescopes saw first light in August 1997. During the 2011‚Äì12 winter, the dome over the telescope was damaged by high winds, allowing snow to enter the observing area. The telescope was secured in early April 2012 by a mountaineer who hiked to the summit. A complete inspection of the damage did not take place until the road to the summit opened in May. During the following summer, the remains of the old dome were demolished and a new dome was fabricated. Installation of the new structure occurred on October 20, 2012. Decommissioning Citing a lack of funds and interest, the University of Denver began decommissioning the observatory in 2018. The facility will be razed and the site will be abandoned.

With the title of Deputy Minister of Sport, he coached the Hungarian team known as the Mighty Magyars in the 1950s. Among the players in the team were Ferenc Pusk√°s, Zolt√°n Czibor, S√°ndor Kocsis, J√≥zsef Bozsik, and N√°ndor Hidegkuti. Together with B√©la Guttmann and M√°rton Bukovi, he formed a triumvirate of radical Hungarian coaches who pioneered the 4-2-4 formation. Sebes advocated what he referred to as socialist football, an early version of Total Football, with every player pulling equal weight and able to play in all positions. Under Sebes, Hungary went unbeaten for 22 consecutive matches. During this run, Hungary became Olympic Champions in 1952 and Central European Champions in 1953. They also twice defeated England, 6‚Äì3 in 1953 and 7‚Äì1 in 1954, and finished as runners- up in the 1954 FIFA World Cup. Defeat in the final marked the beginning of the end for Sebes. Following this defeat, Hungary embarked on an 18-game unbeaten run that came to an end on 19 February 1956, when they lost 3‚Äì1 to Turkey. Despite the winning streak, Sebes was sacked after a 5‚Äì4 defeat against Belgium on 3 June 1956. He remained active in football throughout his life, working as an administrator and holding coaching positions at √öjpesti D√≥zsa SC, Budapest Honv√©d SE, and Di√≥sgy≈ëri VTK. Player career Sebes was born in Budapest, Austria-Hungary. The son of a cobbler, he initially played youth team football in Hungary with, among others, Vasas SC. He then worked as a trade union organiser in both Budapest and later, Paris, where he was employed as a fitter for four years with Renault at Billancourt. Sebes also played for the factory team Club Olympique Billancourt. On returning to Hungary in the 1920s, he played for MTK Hung√°ria FC, where his teammates included Jen≈ë K√°lm√°r and P√°l Titkos, both of whom later worked as assistants to Sebes. Other teammates included Iuliu Baratky and Ferenc Sas. During his time at MTK, he helped the club win the Hungarian League on three occasions and the Hungarian Cup once. Manager career=Honv√©d and MTK In 1948, Sebes, along with B√©la Mandik and G√°bor Komp√≥ti-Kl√©ber, was part of a three-man committee that took charge of the Hungary national football team. However, by 1949, with the title of Deputy Minister of Sport, Sebes was in sole charge and was given complete control of planning for the national side. He was inspired by the Austrian Wunderteam and the Italian team that won two World Cups in the 1930s. Both teams were predominantly drawn from one or two clubs, and Sebes wanted a similar system in Hungary. In January 1949, when Hungary became a Communist state, the resulting nationalisation of football clubs gave Sebes the opportunity. The two biggest Hungarian clubs at the time were Ferencv√°rosi TC and MTK Hung√°ria FC. However, while the secret police (the √ÅVH) took over MTK, Ferencv√°ros was considered unsuitable because of its right wing and nationalist traditions. Sebes turned instead to Kispest AC, and the club was taken over by the Hungarian Ministry of Defence; it became the Hungarian Army team and was subsequently renamed Budapest Honv√©d SE. The Kispest AC team already included Ferenc Pusk√°s and J√≥zsef Bozsik, but army conscription now enabled Honv√©d to recruit S√°ndor Kocsis, Zolt√°n Czibor, and L√°szl√≥ Budai from Ferencv√°rosi TC; Gyula L√≥r√°nt from Vasas SC; and goalkeeper Gyula Grosics. Sebes was effectively able to use Honv√©d as a training camp for the national team. Meanwhile, at MTK, coach M√°rton Bukovi began using the vital 4-2-4 formation, later adopted by Sebes. In particular, Bukovi, together with P√©ter Palot√°s and N√°ndor Hidegkuti, pioneered the crucial deep lying centre-forward position. Other MTK players, Mih√°ly Lantos and J√≥zsef Zakari√°s, provided the Mighty Magyars with a solid defence. Olympic Champions It was at the 1952 Helsinki Summer Olympics that Sebes and his Mighty Magyars first came to prominence. With a forward line that included Ferenc Pusk√°s, S√°ndor Kocsis, and super-sub P√©ter Palot√°s, Hungary easily progressed to the final. In five games, they scored 20 goals and conceded only two. In the semifinal, they defeated defending Olympic Champions Sweden 6‚Äì0; and in the final, they beat Yugoslavia 2‚Äì0, with goals from Pusk√°s and Zolt√°n Czibor. Among those who witnessed Hungary's Olympics victory was Stanley Rous, secretary-general of the English FA and future FIFA president; he subsequently approached Sebes and invited Hungary to play England at Wembley. Hungary v. England Sebes planned for the game against England meticulously. He borrowed the heavier type of balls used by the English FA so that his team could practice with them and altered his training pitch so that the dimensions matched those at Wembley. He also arranged practice matches against Hungarian club sides ordered to play in the English style, and on 15 November 1953‚Äîtwo weeks before the England game‚ÄîHungary played Sweden's team, coached by Englishman George Raynor. He also made the decision to use N√°ndor Hidegkuti instead of P√©ter Palot√°s in the deep lying centre-forward role. On 19 September 1952, in a Central European International Cup game against Switzerland with Hungary down 2‚Äì0 after half an hour, he replaced Palot√°s with Hidegkuti. Inspired by Hidegkuti, Hungary was level at half time and eventually won, 4‚Äì2. On 17 May 1953, Hidegkuti helped Hungary clinch the Central European title when he scored in a 3‚Äì0 win against Italy at the Stadio Olimpico. In 1953, on the way to London to play England, Sebes and the Mighty Magyars stopped in Paris and played a warm-up game against his former team (Olympique Billancourt), beating them 18‚Äì1 in front of 3,000 spectators. On 25 November 1953, Hungary took on an English team that included Stanley Matthews, Stan Mortensen, Billy Wright, and Alf Ramsey, and defeated them 6‚Äì3. In a stunning display of football, Hidegkuti scored a hat trick and Ferenc Pusk√°s scored twice. After the game, a rematch was arranged as a warm-up for the 1954 World Cup. The return took place at the N√©pstadion in Budapest, and Hungary put in another impressive performance, winning 7‚Äì1. The 1954 World Cup Hungary entered the 1954 World Cup with both confidence and an unbeaten record stretching back to 1950. They easily progressed through the group stages, with wins over South Korea and understrength Germany. Then, in the quarter-finals, Hungary won 4‚Äì2, surviving a bruising encounter (also known as the Battle of Berne) with Brazil. The game finished in a brawl, and Sebes ended up with four stitches after having been struck with a broken bottle. In the semifinals, Hungary defeated reigning world champions Uruguay. The game was 2‚Äì2 in extra time until S√°ndor Kocsis scored twice to seal another 4‚Äì2 win. In the final, they met Germany once again; however, the competition would end in disappointment for Hungary, losing 3‚Äì2 to the Germans in the \\"Miracle of Bern.\\" Honours Manager Hungary *Olympic Champions **1952 *Central European Champions **1953 *World Cup **Runner-up: 1954 Player MTK Hung√°ria FC/Hung√°ria FC *Hungarian League **Winner: 1929, 1936, 1937: 3 **Runner-up: 1928, 1931, 1933, 1940: 4 *Hungarian Cup **Winner: 1932 : 1 **Runner-up: 1930, 1935: 2 Individual *World Soccer 24th Greatest Manager of All Time: 2013 ReferencesSources * External links * Biography at FIFA * Short Biography at Magyar √âletrajzi Lexikon (Hung.) * Hungary national team managers at RSSSF *Profile of Guszt√°v Sebes (in Dutch) Category:1906 births Category:1986 deaths Category:Association football midfielders Category:Hungarian footballers Category:Jewish footballers Category:Vasas SC players Category:MTK Budapest FC players Category:Hungarian football managers Category:Hungary national football team managers Category:1954 FIFA World Cup managers Category:Di√≥sgy≈ëri VTK managers Category:Hungarian Jews Category:Hungarian communists Category:Hungary international footballers Category:Footballers from Budapest ","title":"Guszt√°v Sebes"},{"id":"1873197","text":"CIHT-FM (89.9 FM, Hot 89.9) is a radio station licensed to Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.

Initially unsuccessful as a writer of drama, he fared better as a novelist (he wrote a sci-fi novel, Le Monde Tel Qu'il Sera) and as a researcher and writer of Breton folklore. He was posthumously awarded the Prix Lambert. Biography=Education He was the son of a civil engineer and was educated at the college of Pontivy, with the intention of following his father's career by entering the Polytechnic School. However, his father died in 1823 and he matriculated as a law student at Rennes but soon devoted himself to literature. He was by turns a bookseller's assistant and a private schoolmaster in Nantes, a journalist and a grammar school teacher in Brest and a teacher in Mulhouse. He settled in Paris in 1836. In 1848 he became professor in the school for the instruction of civil servants initiated by Hippolyte Carnot, but which was soon to be cancelled. Literary career He began his literary career with a drama, the ', performed at the Th√©√¢tre fran√ßais in 1828. This tragedy was a pronounced failure. In novel writing he did much better than for the stage, deliberately aiming at making the novel an engine of moral instruction. His first two novels ' and ' met with favourable receptions. Souvestre published a series of articles in 1834 on Breton culture, and then an article on Breton poetry. These were combined and published as ' (4 vols, 1835‚Äì1837), followed by ' (1844), where the folklore and natural features of his native province are worked up into story form, and in Un Philosophe sous les toils, which received in 1851 an academic prize. He also wrote a number of other works-- novels, dramas, essays and miscellanies. In 1846, Souvestre published the ambitious ' [The World As It Will Be],The 1846 first edition of ' was illustrated by Bertall, Penguilly and Prosper Saint-Germain. a full-blown dystopia and science fiction novel which featured some remarkable predictions. In it, a French couple, Maurice and Marthe are taken to the year 3000 by a man named John Progress on a flying, steam-powered, Time traveling locomotive. There, they discover the existence of steam-powered subways, submarines, synthetic materials imitating real wood, marble, etc., telephone, air conditioning, giant fruits and vegetables obtained through what we would call today genetic engineering, etc. The world is one nation, the capital of which is Tahiti. Parenting has vanished, because most children are removed from their parents and taken to places where eugenics, genetic manipulation, and different forms of education give rise to somewhat human grotesques tailored for specific tasks. Corporations have enough power to influence government decisions to ensure good profit margins. The medical community manipulates people to ensure that they are seriously sick when they enter, and conducts medical experiments on animals. This is paid for by cutting costs in the food the patients receive. No sympathy or encouragement is given to the poor or disabled. China has become inactive and listless, going into a steep decline after their socio-economic structure was ruined by opium, and wars and murders occur in Persia for idiotic religious reasons. Russia seems more or less a backwater obscurity, and Germany is a jingoistic nation that permits freedom while undermining it at the same time. Death and legacy Souvestre died in Paris on July 5, 1854. His widow was awarded the Prix Lambert, awarded jointly by the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise and the Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts, for the moral quality of his work. French sculptor and Souvestre's friend Philippe Grass made his portrait on his tomb at the P√®re Lachaise Cemetery.

According to Roman mythology, Italy was the ancestral home promised by Jupiter to Aeneas of Troy and his descendants, whose descendants were the founders of Rome. Aside from the legendary accounts, Rome was an Italic city-state that changed its form of government from kingdom to republic and then grew within the context of a peninsula dominated by the Celts in the North, the Etruscans and Umbrians in the Centre, and the Messapians (Illyrian Colonies) and Greeks colonies in the south. The consolidation of Italy into a single entity occurred during the Roman expansion in the peninsula, when Rome formed a permanent association with most of the local tribes and cities. The strength of the Italian confederacy was a crucial factor in the rise of Rome, starting with the Punic and Macedonian wars between the 3rd and 2nd century BC. As provinces were being established throughout the Mediterranean, Italy maintained a special status which made it \\"not a province, but the (ruler) of the provinces\\". Such a status meant that Roman magistrates exercised the (police power) within Italy, rather than the (military power) used abroad. Italy's inhabitants had Latin Rights as well as religious and financial privileges. The period between the end of the 2nd century BC and the 1st century BC was turbulent, beginning with the Servile Wars, continuing with the opposition of aristocratic √©lite to populist reformers and leading to a Social War in the middle of Italy. However, Roman citizenship was recognized to the rest of the Italics by the end of the conflict and then extended to Cisalpine Gaul when Julius Caesar became Roman Dictator. In the context of the transition from Republic to Principate, Italy swore allegiance to Octavian Augustus and was then organized in eleven regions from the Alps to the Ionian Sea. More than two centuries of stability followed, during which Italy was referred to as the (queen of the world) and (motherland of all lands). Several emperors made notable accomplishments in this period: Claudius incorporated Britain into the Roman Empire, Vespasian subjugated the Great Revolt of Judea and reformed the financial system, Trajan conquered Dacia and defeated Parthia, and Marcus Aurelius epitomized the ideal of the philosopher king. The crisis of the third century hit Italy particularly hard and left the eastern half of the Empire more prosperous. In 286 AD the Roman Emperor Diocletian moved the capital of the Western Roman Empire from Rome to Mediolanum.Video of Roman Milan Nevertheless, the islands of Corsica, Sardinia, Sicily and Malta were added to Italy by Diocletian in 292 AD, and Italian cities such as Mediolanum and Ravenna continued to serve as capitals for the West. The Bishop of Rome gained importance during Constantine's reign and was given religious primacy with the Edict of Thessalonica under Theodosius I. Italy was invaded several times by the barbarians and fell under the control of Odoacer, when Romulus Augustus was deposed in 476 AD. In the sixth century, Italy's territory was divided between the Eastern Roman Empire and the Germanic peoples. After that, Italy remained divided until 1861, when it was reunited by the House of Savoy in the Kingdom of Italy, which became the present-day Italian Republic in 1946. Characteristics Following the end of the Social War in 88 BC, Rome had allowed its Italian allies full rights in Roman society and granted Roman citizenship to all the Italic peoples. After having been for centuries the heart of the Roman Empire, from the 3rd century the government and the cultural center began to move eastward: first the Edict of Caracalla in 212 AD extended Roman citizenship to all free men within the imperial boundaries. Then, Christianity became the dominant religion during Constantine's reign (306‚Äì337), raising the power of other Eastern political centres. Although not founded as a capital city in 330, Constantinople grew in importance. It finally gained the rank of eastern capital when given an urban prefect in 359 and the senators who were clari became senators of the lowest rank as clarissimi. As a result, Italy began to decline in favour of the provinces, which resulted in the division of the Empire into two administrative units in 395: the Western Roman Empire, with its capital at Mediolanum (now Milan), and the Eastern Roman Empire, with its capital at Constantinople (now Istanbul). In 402, the capital was moved to Ravenna from Milan, confirming the decline of the city of Rome (which was sacked in 410 for the first time in seven centuries). History The name Italia covered an area whose borders evolved over time. According to Strabo's Geographica, before the expansion of the Roman Republic, the name was used by Greeks to indicate the land between the strait of Messina and the line connecting the gulf of Salerno and gulf of Taranto (corresponding roughly to the current region of Calabria); later the term was extended by Romans to include the Italian Peninsula up to the Rubicon, a river located between Northern and Central Italy. In 49 BC, with the Lex Roscia, Julius Caesar gave Roman citizenship to the people of the Cisalpine Gaul; while in 42 BC the hitherto existing province was abolished, thus extending Italy to the north up to the southern foot of the Alps. Under Augustus, the peoples of today's Aosta Valley and of the western and northern Alps were subjugated (so the western border of Roman Italy was moved to the Varus river), and the Italian eastern border was brought to the Arsia in Istria. Lastly, in the late 3rd century, Italy came to also include the islands of Sicily, Corsica and Sardinia, as well as Raetia and part of Pannonia. The city of Emona (modern Ljubljana, Slovenia) was the easternmost town of Italy. Augustan organization At the beginning of the Roman imperial era, Italy was a collection of territories with different political statuses. Some cities, called municipia, had some independence from Rome, while others, the coloniae, were founded by the Romans themselves. Around 7 BC, Augustus divided Italy into eleven regiones, as reported by Pliny the Elder in his Naturalis Historia: Roman Italia (in green) as organized by Augustus. The Tropaeum Alpium The Victory Monument of the Alps, La Turbie, France, marked the augustan border between Italy and Gaul Italia annonaria and Italia suburbicaria dioceses. * Regio I Latium et Campania * Regio II Apulia et Calabria * Regio III Lucania et Bruttium * Regio IV Samnium * Regio V Picenum * Regio VI Umbria et Ager Gallicus * Regio VII Etruria * Regio VIII Aemilia * Regio IX Liguria * Regio X Venetia et Histria * Regio XI Transpadana Italy was privileged by Augustus and his heirs, with the construction, among other public structures, of a dense network of Roman roads. The Italian economy flourished: agriculture, handicraft and industry had a sensible growth, allowing the export of goods to the other provinces. The Italian population may have grown as well: three census were ordered by Augustus, to record the number of Roman citizens throughout the empire. The surviving totals were 4,063,000 in 28 BC, 4,233,000 in 8 BC, and 4,937,000 in AD 14, but it is still debated whether these counted all citizens, all adult male citizens, or citizens sui iuris. Estimates for the population of mainland Italy, including Cisalpine Gaul, at the beginning of the 1st century range from 6,000,000 according to Karl Julius Beloch in 1886, to 14,000,000 according to Elio Lo Cascio in 2009. Diocletian and Constantinian re- organizations During the Crisis of the Third Century the Roman Empire nearly collapsed under the combined pressures of invasions, military anarchy and civil wars, and hyperinflation. In 284, emperor Diocletian restored political stability. He carried out thorough administrative reforms to maintain order. He created the so-called Tetrarchy whereby the empire was ruled by two senior emperors called Augusti and two junior vice-emperors called Caesars. He decreased the size of the Roman provinces by doubling their number to reduce the power of the provincial governors. He grouped the provinces into several dioceses (Latin: diocesis) and put them under the supervision of the imperial vicarius (vice, deputy), who was the head of the diocese. During the Crisis of the Third Century the importance of Rome declined because the city was far from the troubled frontiers. Diocletian and his colleagues usually resided in four imperial seats. The Augusti, Diocletian and Maximian, who were responsible for the East and West respectively, established themselves at Nicomedia, in north-western Anatolia (closer to the Persian frontier in the east) and Milan, in northern Italy (closer to the European frontiers) respectively. The seats of the Caesars were Augusta Treverorum (on the River Rhine frontier) for Constantius Chlorus and Sirmium (on the River Danube frontier) for Galerius who also resided at Thessaloniki. Under Diocletian Italy became the Dioecesis Italiciana. It included Raetia. It was subdivided the following provinces: **Liguria (today's Liguria and western Piedmont) ** Transpadana (eastern Piedmont and Lombardy) ** Rhaetia (eastern Switzerland, western and central Austria, part of southern Germany, and part of northeastern Italy) ** Venetia et Histria (today's Veneto, Friuli-Venezia Giulia and Trentino-Alto Adige and Istria county) ** Aemilia (Emilia-Romagna) ** Tuscia (Etruria) et Umbria (Tuscany and Umbria) ** Flaminia (Picenum and the former Ager Gallicus, in today's Marche) ** Latium et Campania (the coastal parts of Lazio and Campania) ** Samnium (Abruzzo, Molise and Irpinia) ** Apulia et Calabria (today's Apulia) ** Lucania et Bruttium (Basilicata and Calabria) ** Sicilia (Sicily and Malta) ** Corsica et Sardinia Constantine subdivided the empire into four Praetorian prefectures. The Diocesis Italiciana became the Praetorian prefecture of Italy (praefectura praetoria Italiae), and was subdivided into two dioceses. It still included Raetia. The two dioceses and their provinces were: Diocesis Italia annonaria (Italy of the annona - its inhabitants had to provide the administration in Milan and the troops stationed in that city the annona - food, wine and timber). **Alpes Cottiae (modern Liguria and western part of Piedmont) ** Liguria (western Lombardy and eastern part of Piedmont) ** Venetia et Histria (Istria [which is now part of Croatia, Slovenia and Italy], Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Trentino-Alto Adige, Veneto and eastern and central Lombardy) ** Raetia I (eastern Switzerland and western Austria) ** Rhaetia II (central Austria, part of southern Germany, and part of northeastern Italy) ** Aemilia (the Emilia part of Emilia-Romagna) ** Flaminia et Picenum Annonarium (Romagna and northern Marche) Diocesis Italia Suburbicaria (Italy \\"under the government of the urbs\\", i.e. Rome) ** Tuscia (Etruria) et Umbria (Tuscany, Umbria and the northern part of coastal Lazio) ** Picenum suburbicarium (Piceno, in southern Marche) ** Valeria Sabina (the modern province of Rieti, other areas of Lazio and areas of Umbria and Abruzzo) ** Campania (central and southern coastal Lazio and coastal Campania except for the modern province of Salerno) ** Samnium (Abruzzo, Molise and the mountain areas of modern Campania; i.e., the modern provinces of Benevento and Avellino and part of the province of Caserta) ** Apulia et Calabria (today's Apulia) ** Lucania et Bruttium (modern Calabria, Basilicata and the province of Salerno in modern Campania) ** Sicilia (Sicily and Malta) ** Sardinia ** Corsica Western Roman Empire In 330, Constantine inaugurated Constantinople. He established the imperial court, a Senate, financial and judicial administrations, as well as the military structures. The new city, however, did not receive an urban prefect until 359 which raised it to the status of eastern capital. After the death of Theodosius in 395 and the subsequent division of the empire Italy was part of the Western Roman Empire. As a result of Alaric's invasion in 402 the western seat was moved from Mediolanum to Ravenna. Alaric, king of Visigoths, sacked Rome itself in 410; something that hadn't happened for eight centuries. Northern Italy was attacked by Attila's Huns in 452. Rome was sacked in 455 again by the Vandals under the command of Genseric. The \\"Praetorian Prefecture of Italy\\" (in yellow) stretched from the Danube river to North Africa According to Notitia Dignitatum, one of the very few surviving documents of Roman government updated to the 420s, Roman Italy was governed by a praetorian prefect, Prefectus praetorio Italiae (who also governed the Diocese of Africa and the Diocese of Pannonia), one vicarius, and one comes rei militaris. The regions of Italy were governed at the end of the fourth century by eight consulares (Venetiae et Histriae, Aemiliae, Liguriae, Flaminiae et Piceni annonarii, Tusciae et Umbriae, Piceni suburbicarii, Campaniae, and Siciliae), two correctores (Apuliae et Calabriae and Lucaniae et Bruttiorum) and seven praesides (Alpium Cottiarum, Rhaetia Prima and Secunda, Samnii, Valeriae, Sardiniae, and Corsicae). In the fifth century, with the Emperors controlled by their barbarian generals, the Western imperial government maintained weak control over Italy, whose coasts were periodically under attack. In 476, with the abdication of Romulus Augustulus, the Western Roman Empire had formally fallen unless one considers Julius Nepos, the legitimate emperor recognized by Constantinople as the last. He was assassinated in 480He may have been recognized by Odoacer. Italy remained under Odoacer and his Kingdom of Italy, and then under the Ostrogothic Kingdom. The Germanic successor states under Odoacer and Theodoric the Great continued to use the Roman administrative machinery, as well as being nominal subjects of the Eastern emperor at Constantinople. In 535 Roman Emperor Justinian invaded Italy which suffered twenty years of disastrous war. In August 554, Justinian issued a Pragmatic sanction which maintained most of the organization of Diocletian. The \\"Prefecture of Italy\\" thus survived, and came under Roman control in the course of Justinian's Gothic War. As a result of the Lombard invasion in 568, the Byzantines lost most of Italy, except the territories of the Exarchate of Ravenna - a corridor from Venice to Lazio - and footholds in the south Naples and the toe and heel of the peninsula.

Residual stresses are stresses that remain in a solid material after the original cause of the stresses has been removed. Residual stress may be desirable or undesirable. For example, laser peening imparts deep beneficial compressive residual stresses into metal components such as turbine engine fan blades, and it is used in toughened glass to allow for large, thin, crack- and scratch-resistant glass displays on smartphones. However, unintended residual stress in a designed structure may cause it to fail prematurely. Residual stresses can result from a variety of mechanisms including inelastic (plastic) deformations, temperature gradients (during thermal cycle) or structural changes (phase transformation). Heat from welding may cause localized expansion, which is taken up during welding by either the molten metal or the placement of parts being welded. When the finished weldment cools, some areas cool and contract more than others, leaving residual stresses. Another example occurs during semiconductor fabrication and microsystem fabrication when thin film materials with different thermal and crystalline properties are deposited sequentially under different process conditions. The stress variation through a stack of thin film materials can be very complex and can vary between compressive and tensile stresses from layer to layer.  Applications  While uncontrolled residual stresses are undesirable, some designs rely on them. In particular, brittle materials can be toughened by including compressive residual stress, as in the case for toughened glass and pre-stressed concrete. The predominant mechanism for failure in brittle materials is brittle fracture, which begins with initial crack formation. When an external tensile stress is applied to the material, the crack tips concentrate stress, increasing the local tensile stresses experienced at the crack tips to a greater extent than the average stress on the bulk material. This causes the initial crack to enlarge quickly (propagate) as the surrounding material is overwhelmed by the stress concentration, leading to fracture. A material having compressive residual stress helps to prevent brittle fracture because the initial crack is formed under compressive (negative tensile) stress. To cause brittle fracture by crack propagation of the initial crack, the external tensile stress must overcome the compressive residual stress before the crack tips experience sufficient tensile stress to propagate. The manufacture of some swords utilises a gradient in martensite formation to produce particularly hard edges (notably the katana). The difference in residual stress between the harder cutting edge and the softer back of the sword gives such swords their characteristic curve.Prince Rupert's Drops In toughened glass, compressive stresses are induced on the surface of the glass, balanced by tensile stresses in the body of the glass. Due to the residual compressive stress on the surface, toughened glass is more resistant to cracks, but shatter into small shards when the outer surface is broken. A demonstration of the effect is shown by Prince Rupert's Drop, a material-science novelty in which a molten glass globule is quenched in water: Because the outer surface cools and solidifies first, when the volume cools and solidifies, it \\"wants\\" to take up a smaller volume than the outer \\"skin\\" has already defined; this puts much of the volume in tension, pulling the \\"skin\\" in, putting the \\"skin\\" in compression. As a result, the solid globule is extremely tough, able to be hit with a hammer, but if its long tail is broken, the balance of forces is upset, causing the entire piece to shatter violently. In certain types of gun barrels made with two tubes forced together, the inner tube is compressed while the outer tube stretches, preventing cracks from opening in the rifling when the gun is fired.  Premature failure  The collapsed Silver Bridge, as seen from the Ohio side Castings may also have large residual stresses due to uneven cooling. Residual stress is often a cause of premature failure of critical components, and was probably a factor in the collapse of the Silver Bridge in West Virginia, United States in December 1967. The eyebar links were castings which showed high levels of residual stress, which in one eyebar, encouraged crack growth. When the crack reached a critical size, it grew catastrophically, and from that moment, the whole structure started to fail in a chain reaction. Because the structure failed in less than a minute, 46 drivers and passengers in cars on the bridge at the time were killed as the suspended roadway fell into the river below.  Compressive residual stress  Common methods to induce compressive residual stress are shot peening for surfaces and High frequency impact treatment for weld toes. Depth of compressive residual stress varies depending of the method. Both methods can increase lifetime of constructions significiantly. Example of a HiFIT treated assembly  Creation of residual stress  There are some techniques which are used to create uniform residual stress in a beam. For example, the four point bend allows inserting residual stress by applying a load on a beam using two cylinders.  Measurement techniques  A diagram comparing residual stress measurement techniques, showing the measurement length scale, penetration, and level of destruction to the measured component.  Overview  There are many techniques used to measure residual stresses, which are broadly categorised into destructive, semi-destructive and non-destructive techniques. The selection of the technique depends on the information required and the nature of the measurement specimen. Factors include the depth/penetration of the measurement (surface or through-thickness), the length scale to be measured over (macroscopic, mesoscopic or microscopic), the resolution of the information required, and also the composition geometry and location of the specimen. Additionally, some of the techniques need to be performed in specialised laboratory facilities, meaning that \\"on-site\\" measurements are not possible for all of the techniques.  Destructive techniques  Destructive techniques result in large and irreparable structural change to the specimen, meaning that either the specimen cannot be returned to service or a mock-up or spare must be used. These techniques function using a \\"strain release\\" principle; cutting the measurement specimen to relax the residual stresses and then measuring the deformed shape. As these deformations are usually elastic, there is an exploitable linear relationship between the magnitude of the deformation and magnitude of the released residual stress.G.S.Schajer Practical Residual Stress Measurement Methods.

Non-destructive techniques  The non- destructive techniques measure the effects of relationships between the residual stresses and their action of crystallographic properties of the measured material. Some of these work by measuring the diffraction of high frequency electromagnetic radiation through the atomic lattice spacing (which has been deformed due to the stress) relative to a stress-free sample. The Ultrasonic and Magnetic techniques exploit the acoustic and ferromagnetic properties of materials to perform relative measurements of residual stress. Non-destructive techniques include: * Electromagnetic a.k.a. eStress - Can be used with a wide range of sample dimensions and materials, with accuracy on par to that of neutron diffraction. Portable systems are available such as the eStress system, which can be used for on-site measurements or permanently installed for continuous monitoring. Speed of measurement is 1-10 seconds per location. * Neutron Diffraction - A proven technique that can measure through- thickness but which requires a neutron source (like a nuclear reactor). * Synchrotron Diffraction - Requires a synchrotron but provide similarly useful data as eStress and the neutron diffraction methods. * X-Ray Diffraction - a limited surface technique with penetration of a few hundred microns only. * Ultrasonic - an experimental process still in the works. * Magnetic - Can be used with very limited sample dimensions.  Relief of residual stress  When undesired residual stress is present from prior metalworking operations, the amount of residual stress may be reduced using several methods. These methods may be classified into thermal and mechanical (or nonthermal) methods. All the methods involve processing the part to be stress relieved as a whole.  Thermal method  The thermal method involves changing the temperature of the entire part uniformly, either through heating or cooling. When parts are heated for stress relief, the process may also be known as stress relief bake. Cooling parts for stress relief is known as cryogenic stress relief and is relatively uncommon. = Stress relief bake = Most metals, when heated, experience a reduction in yield strength. If the material's yield strength is sufficiently lowered by heating, locations within the material that experienced residual stresses greater than the yield strength (in the heated state) would yield or deform. This leaves the material with residual stresses that are at most as high as the yield strength of the material in its heated state. Stress relief bake should not be confused with annealing or tempering, which are heat treatments to increase ductility of a metal. Although those processes also involve heating the material to high temperatures and reduce residual stresses, they also involve a change in metallurgical properties, which may be undesired. For certain materials such as low alloy steel, care must be taken during stress relief bake so as not to exceed the temperature at which the material achieves maximum hardness (See Tempering in alloy steels). = Cryogenic stress relief = Cryogenic stress relief involves placing the material (usually steel) into a cryogenic environment such as liquid nitrogen. In this process, the material to be stress relieved will be cooled to a cryogenic temperature for a long period, then slowly brought back to room temperature.  Nonthermal methods  Mechanical methods to relieve undesirable surface tensile stresses and replace them with beneficial compressive residual stresses include shot peening and laser peening. Each works the surface of the material with a media: shot peening typically uses a metal or glass material; laser peening uses high intensity beams of light to induce a shock wave that propagates deep into the material.

The CRTC decision authorizing the launch of CBON-FM in fact encouraged, but did not direct, Radio-Canada to retain an AM frequency for its talk radio network, and to reserve CBON-FM for its music network. However, the station launched in 1978 as an affiliate of the talk network after the CBC was unable to negotiate an agreement with F. Baxter Ricard to directly acquire CFBR. Prior to CBON-FM's sign-on, CJBC Toronto simulcasted on most of the rebroadcast transmitters across northern Ontario. Radio-Canada's music network was not available in the city until the launch of CBBX-FM in 2001, although from 1984 to 1991 the CBC held an unused license to launch that station.CRTC Decision 84-905 Programming The station's regional morning program is Le matin du Nord, weekdays from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m., and its regional afternoon program is Jonction 11-17, weekdays from 3:30 p.m. to 6 p.m. On Saturday mornings, the station airs the provincewide morning program Enfin samedi. The provincewide programs airs on CBON and CJBC, as well as CBEF in Windsor.

He was head writer for Spitting Image, and has written for many TV and radio programmes, including Alas Smith and Jones, Dead Ringers and Alistair McGowan's Big Impression. His work helped these shows to win numerous awards, including a British Comedy Award and the Sony Gold. With his comedy partner Andy Parsons, he has performed satirical shows in live venues in Australia and as part of the Edinburgh Fringe. Parsons and Naylor's Pull-Out Sections broadcast its ninth season on BBC Radio 2 during Spring 2007. A compilation CD was released in 2003. The duo also set up London's first comedy sketch club, TBA, at the Gate Theatre in the 1990s, and in the process helped discover many of Britain's leading sketch performers, including Armstrong and Miller, Tony Gardner and The Cheese Shop. In 2008 he created, directed and executive-produced Headcases, a satirical ITV show very similar to Spitting Image but made with CGI rather than puppets. The show won numerous prestigious TV awards - including the RTS for Design and Innovation, and the C21 Award for Best New Sketch Show at Cannes' Mipcom - and was nominated for Best New Programme in the Broadcast Awards. On the live circuit, Henry has been a regular at the Edinburgh Festival, performing, writing and directing numerous sketch shows and plays (15 in total). In 2014 he was awarded one of the Festival's highest accolades, the Fringe First. He was also one of the international acts invited to perform at the Melbourne and Sydney Comedy Festivals. He played Rowan Atkinson's sidekick Bough in a series of 17 commercials for Barclaycard.,https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/henry-naylor- from-spitting-image-to-syria-xqlwr2s8j and in 1993 appeared in the children's television series Press Gang as the acerbically-drawn host (on roller skates) of a Saturday-morning kids' show alongside a puppet cat. In 2003 he was in the news for throwing a full English breakfast at David Blaine during his Above the Below stunt on the South Bank of the River Thames in London.https://www.standard.co.uk/news/blaines-strange- friend-6954401.html%3Famp Plays Naylor has written and directed award- winning plays for the Edinburgh Fringe, usually playing in The Gilded Balloon Teviot. Finding Bin Laden (2003) was a satire about media representation of the 2003 Invasion of Iraq, which also featured co-producer Sam Maynard's documentary photography. Hunting Diana, his 2004 Fringe offering, was about conspiracy theories surrounding the death of Diana, Princess of Wales.The Scotsman Hunting Diana review In 2007 he directed Sarah Kendall's Fringe show My Very First Kidnapping. In the summer of 2014 he wrote his first drama- tragedy - The Collector - which won one of the leading awards at the Edinburgh Festival, the Fringe First.\\"Fringe First Winner\\" announcement\\"The Collector\\" review Set in an Iraqi gaol during the occupation of Iraq in 2003, the play attacked brutality on both sides of the conflict. The show transferred off- London's West End, and played a sell-out season at the Arcola Theatre in November 2014, to critical acclaim. In autumn of 2016, the show will be going on an extensive 3-month tour of the UK. In 2015, he premiered the second part of his Arabian Nightmares - Echoes. Opening at the Gilded Balloon, it won the Spirit of the Fringe Award at Edinburgh. Exploring the surprising parallels between the Jihadi adventurers of today and early Victorian pioneers, the play was a provocative and brutal examination of colonialism, and the resonances of history. Echoes received many highly favourable reviews, including one from the Guardian‚Äôs lead critic Mark Lawson, who described it as a ‚Äòhugely impressive play.‚Äô The play transferred both off-West End and off-Broadway - to the Arcola Theatre in London (November 2015), and to the 59e59 Theater in New York (April 2016). Its world tour commenced in early 2016, and at the world's second-largest Fringe - Adelaide - the show became one of the most decorated at the festival's history, winning five major Fringe Awards, including for Best Theatre, Critics' Choice and Pick of the Fringe. Again, it scored stellar five-star reviews. In 2016 Naylor was due to premiere the third instalment of the Arabian Nightmares at the Gilded Balloon - its working title being Angel.

History Broadcast area for the station. The station was originally launched in 1925 as CKNC on 840 AM, owned by the Canadian National Carbon Company. In January 1927, the station moved to 690 kHz, returning to 840 kHz a month later. The station then moved to 580 in 1928, and to 1030 kHz in 1931. The station was leased and then acquired by the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission, the forerunner of the modern Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, in 1933 and became CRCY, before leaving the airwaves in 1935. The following year, it returned at 1420 kHz, as a signal booster for CRCT. The station's callsign was changed to CBY in 1938, in 1941 the station moved to 1010 kHz, and to CJBC on November 15, 1943. In 1944, CJBC became the flagship of the CBC's Dominion Network. On September 1, 1948, CJBC moved to its current frequency, 860 kHz. its signal strength was boosted to 50,000 watts, up from its previous strength of 1,000 watts. As a Dominion Network affiliate, the station carried network programming in the evening, which included light entertainment fare and some American programming, and local programming during the day. CJBC began carrying some French language programming in 1962, initially in the form of a nightly, half- hour newscast.

Kennedy and the Kennedy family. Billings was a prep school roommate of Kennedy, an usher at his wedding and a campaigner for his successful 1960 presidential bid. Joseph Kennedy Sr. called him \\"my second son,\\" and he sometimes acted as escort for several of the Kennedy women. Billings served with Sargent Shriver as a trustee for the Kennedy family trusts. Early years Billings was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on April 15, 1916, the third child of Frederic Tremaine Billings (1873‚Äì1933) and Romaine LeMoyne (1882‚Äì1970). His father was a prominent physician and a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy. His mother was a Mayflower descendant and his great-grandfather Francis Julius LeMoyne was a prominent abolitionist linked to the underground railroad who helped establish what is today known as LeMoyne-Owen College.Pitts, 319-20 The Billings family were Episcopalians and Republicans.Pitts, 120; Smith 30 Billings, a 16-year-old third-year student, and Kennedy, a 15-year-old second-year student, met at Choate, an elite preparatory school, in the fall of 1933. Billings as a teenager was 6' 2\\", weighed 175 pounds, and was the strongest member of the Choate crew.Perret, 35-6 They became fast friends, drawn to each other by their mutual distaste for their strict school. While at Choate, they formed a club and called themselves \\"The Muckers\\". The Muckers would pull pranks around the school and even planned to dump horse manure in the school gym, but that fell through after the headmaster found out. Billings' first visit with the Kennedy family was for Christmas in Palm Beach in 1933, after that, he joined them for holidays, participated in family events, and was treated like a member of the family. The Depression had hurt the Billings family financially, and Lem Billings was at Choate on scholarship. Billings repeated his senior year so that he and Kennedy could graduate from Choate together in 1935. Billings and Kennedy took a summer trip through Europe in the summer of 1937. Between Munich and Nuremberg, they bought a dachshund for $7 and named him Dunker after the German word \\"thank you\\", one of the few words Kennedy and Billings knew. The two had to give Dunker up due to Kennedy's allergies.Pitts, 64‚Äì67; Perret, 61 The trip lasted two and a half months and solidified their friendship.

Ben Bradlee, a Kennedy friend who worked at Newsweek during the Kennedy Administration, and no friend of Billings,Smith, 8 said \\"they were childhood friends and stayed loyal to each other forever.\\" Billings, he said, \\"had a natural jealousy. He didn't want to share his friendship with Jack.\\"Pitt, 197 Gore Vidal, who was banned from the White House after a run-in with Billings,Pitts, 231 was critical of Billings,Vidal, 380, 391‚Äì2 but also thought Billings played an important role as an aide to Kennedy, who was often ill or in pain. \\"He needed Lem Billings to get around ‚Äî better than a trained nurse\\" that would have made his political career impossible. Vidal thought Jacqueline Kennedy thought Billings \\"was kind of a nothing ... but Jack needed him and she was practical.\\"Pitts, 232 Many testify to Billings' wit and ability to help the President relax. He once described the Kennedy family's lack of business awareness: \\"Listening to the Kennedy brothers talk about business was like hearing nuns talk about sex.\\"Smith, 56 Billings also served the President as an artistic adviser, selecting scrimshaw for display in the Oval OfficeSmith, 86 and, on one European tour, quickly assembling a selection of artworks to be presented as gifts.Smith, 433-4; see also: Smith, 113: \\"The only counterbalance to the [Kennedy] family's philistinism had been Lem Billings, whose passion for art and antiques had begun with his Princeton theses on Tintoretto, a precociously sophisticated study.\\" Billings spent less time with the President in the fall of 1963. One of their friends thought \\"that Jackie was trying to close Lem out.\\"Smith, 510 Billings spent the last weekend of October 1963 with the couple, the last time he saw them together. Billings saw the President for the last time when they dined at the White House with Greta Garbo on November 13, 1963, nine days before the President's assassination in Dallas.Pitts, 205-6; Smith, 483-4 Personal life Friends from the 1970s confirmed that Billings was homosexual, but not open to discussing it.Pitts, 263-4, 267, 292 In 2006, looking back to the Kennedy Administration, Ben Bradlee said: \\"I suppose it's known that Lem was gay....It impressed me that Jack had gay friends.\\" At the same time, he admitted that no one ever expressed the idea aloud during Kennedy's White House years.Pitts, 265 Red Fay, a friend of the President from his World War II service, said of Billings: \\"I didn't see anything overtly gay about him; I think he was neutral.\\"Smith, 31 One historian wrote that after the 1963 assassination Billings was: \\"probably the saddest of the Kennedy 'widows'.\\"Smith, 465 Though newspapers often mentioned Billings' attendance at major social events, they identified him either as the escort of a member of the Kennedy family or included him in a list of Kennedy friends. Otherwise he attended without female accompaniment.For example: New York Times: \\"Huntington Hartford Weds Diane Brown in New Jersey,\\" October 8, 1962, accessed September 23, 2011; One instance of Billings engaging in homosexual sex in the mid 1940s has been documented. Vidal, 380; Pitts, 202 Though there has never been any proof of homosexual activity between them, John F. Kennedy would often, and even when married, some believe they shared a bedroom with Billings.Barbara A. Perry in Rose Kennedy, the Life and Times of a Political Matriarch p. 248 This idea is often debunked, since Billings had his own personal bedroom in the White House. Some historians believe that Billings expressed his sexual interest in Kennedy in writing in 1934 and that Kennedy rebuffed his advances.Perret, 38, 405n.; Pitts, 22-3 Kennedy knew Billings had rightly been accused of homosexual behavior by a fellow Choate student during their years there.Perret, 405n26; Pitts, 87; Vidal, 380 Charles L. Bartlett, a journalist who introduced Kennedy to Jacqueline BouvierTIME: \\"Women: Jackie,\\" January 20, 1961, accessed January 18, 2011 and friend of both Billings and Kennedy, described their relationship: \\"Lem was a stable presence for Jack. Lem's raison d'√™tre was Jack Kennedy. I don't think it's true that he did not have views of his own, as some have said. He had a very independent mind. He had interests of his own that Jack didn't necessarily share. He certainly didn't have the same interest in politics and women that Jack had.\\"Pitts, 207 Though Gore Vidal thought Billings was \\"absolutely nobody,\\" he also believed \\"it was a good idea that Jack had somebody he could trust like that around him.\\" He believed Billings loved Kennedy. \\"Jack made a big difference in my life,\\" Billings said. \\"Because of him, I was never lonely. He may have been the reason I never got married.\\"New Haven Register: Luther Turmelle, \\"Book details JFK's friendship with gay man,\\" May 16, 2007 Later years In 1964, Billings was named to select a memorial to Kennedy to be placed in the Kennedy Center.New York Times: \\"Friend of Kennedy Named To Head Memorial Group,\\" July 8, 1964, accessed January 23, 2011 In 1965, Jacqueline Kennedy invited Billings to accompany her and her children to England for the unveiling of a memorial to President Kennedy at Runnymede. He escorted Jean Kennedy Smith, sister of the President, to a gala ballet performance in 1966New York Times: \\"Humphreys Attend a Gala Ballet Premiere,\\" January 19, 1966, accessed January 23, 2011 and Ethel Kennedy, the president's sister-in-law, to the 1971 opening of the Kennedy Center.New York Times: Nan Robertson, \\"Glittering Audience Attends Kennedy Center's Opening,\\" September 9, 1971, accessed January 23, 2011 After the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy in 1968, Billings became depressed and started to drink in excess, an addiction that plagued him for the majority of his life.Pitts 2009 p.294 He maintained close ties to the Kennedys and their children for the rest of his life, frequently socializing with Bobby Kennedy Jr., to whom he became almost a surrogate father, and Christopher Lawford.Pitts, 293 Billings' behavior changed drastically in the late 1960s. According to Kennedy family members, such as Peter Lawford, and others, Billings began using drugs due to the influence of the Kennedy and Lawford boys. The elder Kennedys began to discourage the boys from associating with Billings because of his excessive recreational drug use (including alcohol). Billings served for many years along with Sargent Shriver as a trustee for the Kennedy family trusts,New York Times: Michael C. Jensen, \\"Managing the Kennedy Millions,\\" June 12, 1977, accessed January 23, 2011 working from an office in the Pan Am Building. Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis included Billings as a guest at a party marking the birthdays of her children Caroline (21st) and John Jr. (18th) in 1978.Pitts, 210 In 1987, historian Doris Kearns Goodwin described how Billings structured her interviews with him. She had to submit questions in advance. Billings then prepared responses and read them aloud to her.New York Times: Doris Kearns Goodwin, \\"Fitzgeralds and Kennedys,\\" March 8, 1987, accessed January 21, 2011 Death On May 28, 1981, Billings died in his sleep following a heart attack in his Manhattan apartment.Pitts, 306 His dying wish was for the young Kennedy men to carry his casket to its final resting place. When they arrived at the cemetery, it was already in place to be lowered. The young Kennedys took the casket and carried it around the gravesite before returning it to the burial plot. He is buried in Allegheny Cemetery in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

It is called the hypoexponetial distribution as it has a coefficient of variation less than one, compared to the hyper-exponential distribution which has coefficient of variation greater than one and the exponential distribution which has coefficient of variation of one. Overview The Erlang distribution is a series of k exponential distributions all with rate \\\\lambda. The hypoexponential is a series of k exponential distributions each with their own rate \\\\lambda_{i}, the rate of the i^{th} exponential distribution. If we have k independently distributed exponential random variables \\\\boldsymbol{X}_{i}, then the random variable, : \\\\boldsymbol{X}=\\\\sum^{k}_{i=1}\\\\boldsymbol{X}_{i} is hypoexponentially distributed. The hypoexponential has a minimum coefficient of variation of 1/k. Relation to the phase-type distribution As a result of the definition it is easier to consider this distribution as a special case of the phase-type distribution. The phase-type distribution is the time to absorption of a finite state Markov process. If we have a k+1 state process, where the first k states are transient and the state k+1 is an absorbing state, then the distribution of time from the start of the process until the absorbing state is reached is phase-type distributed. This becomes the hypoexponential if we start in the first 1 and move skip-free from state i to i+1 with rate \\\\lambda_{i} until state k transitions with rate \\\\lambda_{k} to the absorbing state k+1. This can be written in the form of a subgenerator matrix, : \\\\left[\\\\begin{matrix}-\\\\lambda_{1}&\\\\lambda_{1}&0&\\\\dots&0&0\\\\ 0&-\\\\lambda_{2}&\\\\lambda_{2}&\\\\ddots&0&0\\\\ \\\\vdots&\\\\ddots&\\\\ddots&\\\\ddots&\\\\ddots&\\\\vdots\\\\ 0&0&\\\\ddots&-\\\\lambda_{k-2}&\\\\lambda_{k-2}&0\\\\ 0&0&\\\\dots&0&-\\\\lambda_{k-1}&\\\\lambda_{k-1}\\\\ 0&0&\\\\dots&0&0&-\\\\lambda_{k} \\\\end{matrix}\\\\right]\\\\; . For simplicity denote the above matrix \\\\Theta\\\\equiv\\\\Theta(\\\\lambda_{1},\\\\dots,\\\\lambda_{k}). If the probability of starting in each of the k states is : \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\alpha}=(1,0,\\\\dots,0) then Hypo(\\\\lambda_{1},\\\\dots,\\\\lambda_{k})=PH(\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\alpha},\\\\Theta). Two parameter case Where the distribution has two parameters (\\\\lambda_1 eq \\\\lambda_2) the explicit forms of the probability functions and the associated statistics are CDF: F(x) = 1 - \\\\frac{\\\\lambda_2}{\\\\lambda_2-\\\\lambda_1}e^{-\\\\lambda_1x} + \\\\frac{\\\\lambda_1}{\\\\lambda_2-\\\\lambda_1}e^{-\\\\lambda_2x} PDF: f(x) = \\\\frac{\\\\lambda_1\\\\lambda_2}{\\\\lambda_1-\\\\lambda_2}( e^{-x \\\\lambda_2} - e^{-x \\\\lambda_1} ) Mean: \\\\frac{1}{\\\\lambda_1}+\\\\frac{1}{\\\\lambda_2} Variance: \\\\frac{1}{\\\\lambda_1^2}+\\\\frac{1}{\\\\lambda_2^2} Coefficient of variation: \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{\\\\lambda_1^2 + \\\\lambda_2^2}}{ \\\\lambda_1 + \\\\lambda_2 } The coefficient of variation is always < 1\\\\. Given the sample mean (\\\\bar{x}) and sample coefficient of variation (c), the parameters \\\\lambda_1 and \\\\lambda_2 can be estimated as follows: \\\\lambda_1= \\\\frac{ 2}{ \\\\bar{x} } \\\\left[ 1 + \\\\sqrt{ 1 + 2 ( c^2 - 1 ) } \\\\right]^{-1} \\\\lambda_2 = \\\\frac{ 2 }{ \\\\bar{x} } \\\\left[ 1 - \\\\sqrt{ 1 + 2 ( c^2 - 1 ) } \\\\right]^{-1} The resulting parameters \\\\lambda_1 and \\\\lambda_2 are real values if c^2\\\\in[0.5,1]. Characterization A random variable \\\\boldsymbol{X}\\\\sim Hypo(\\\\lambda_{1},\\\\dots,\\\\lambda_{k}) has cumulative distribution function given by, : F(x)=1-\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\alpha}e^{x\\\\Theta}\\\\boldsymbol{1} and density function, : f(x)=-\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\alpha}e^{x\\\\Theta}\\\\Theta\\\\boldsymbol{1}\\\\; , where \\\\boldsymbol{1} is a column vector of ones of the size k and e^{A} is the matrix exponential of A. When \\\\lambda_{i} e \\\\lambda_{j} for all i e j, the density function can be written as : f(x) = \\\\sum_{i=1}^k \\\\lambda_i e^{-x \\\\lambda_i} \\\\left(\\\\prod_{j=1, j e i}^k \\\\frac{\\\\lambda_j}{\\\\lambda_j - \\\\lambda_i}\\\\right) = \\\\sum_{i=1}^k \\\\ell_i(0) \\\\lambda_i e^{-x \\\\lambda_i} where \\\\ell_1(x), \\\\dots, \\\\ell_k(x) are the Lagrange basis polynomials associated with the points \\\\lambda_1,\\\\dots,\\\\lambda_k. The distribution has Laplace transform of : \\\\mathcal{L}{f(x)}=-\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\alpha}(sI-\\\\Theta)^{-1}\\\\Theta\\\\boldsymbol{1} Which can be used to find moments, : E[X^{n}]=(-1)^{n}n!\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\alpha}\\\\Theta^{-n}\\\\boldsymbol{1}\\\\; . General case In the general case where there are a distinct sums of exponential distributions with rates \\\\lambda_1,\\\\lambda_2,\\\\cdots,\\\\lambda_a and a number of terms in each sum equals to r_1,r_2,\\\\cdots,r_a respectively. The cumulative distribution function for t\\\\geq0 is given by :F(t) = 1 - \\\\left(\\\\prod_{j=1}^a \\\\lambda_j^{r_j} \\\\right) \\\\sum_{k=1}^a \\\\sum_{l=1}^{r_k} \\\\frac{\\\\Psi_{k,l}(-\\\\lambda_k) t^{r_k-l} \\\\exp(-\\\\lambda_k t)} {(r_k-l)!(l-1)!} , with :\\\\Psi_{k,l}(x) = -\\\\frac{\\\\partial^{l-1}}{\\\\partial x^{l-1}} \\\\left(\\\\prod_{j=0,j eq k}^a \\\\left(\\\\lambda_j+x\\\\right)^{-r_j} \\\\right) . with the additional convention \\\\lambda_0 = 0, r_0 = 1.

The new command, along with the U.S. Army Forces Command (FORSCOM), was created from the Continental Army Command (CONARC) located at Fort Monroe, Virginia. That action was the major innovation in the Army's post-Vietnam reorganization, in the face of realization that CONARC's obligations and span of control were too broad for efficient focus. The new organization functionally realigned the major Army commands in the continental United States. CONARC, and Headquarters, U.S. Army Combat Developments Command (CDC), situated at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, were discontinued, with TRADOC and FORSCOM at Fort Belvoir assuming the realigned missions. TRADOC assumed the combat developments mission from CDC, took over the individual training mission formerly the responsibility of CONARC, and assumed command from CONARC of the major Army installations in the United States housing Army training center and Army branch schools. FORSCOM assumed CONARC's operational responsibility for the command and readiness of all divisions and corps in the continental U.S. and for the installations where they were based. Joined under TRADOC, the major Army missions of individual training and combat developments each had its own lineage. The individual training responsibility had belonged, during World War II, to Headquarters Army Ground Forces (AGF). In 1946 numbered army areas were established in the U.S. under AGF command. At that time, the AGF moved from Washington, D.C. to Fort Monroe. In March 1948, the AGF was replaced at Fort Monroe with the new Office, Chief of Army Field Forces (OCAFF). OCAFF, however, did not command the training establishment. That function was exercised by Headquarters, Department of the Army through the numbered armies to the corps, division, and Army Training Centers. In February 1955, HQ Continental Army Command (CONARC) replaced OCAFF, assuming its missions as well as the training missions from DA. In January, HQ CONARC was redesignated U.S. Continental Army Command. Combat developments emerged as a formal Army mission in the early 1950s, and OCAFF assumed that role in 1952. In 1955, CONARC assumed the mission. In 1962, HQ U.S. Army Combat Development Command (CDC) was established to bring the combat developments function under one major Army command.TRADOC Military History - FAQs. Tradoc.army.mil.

Emil Snethlage, a Lutheran pastor, after the death of her mother. In 1889 she passed an examination that allowed her to teach young women at secondary school. At the age of 21 she studied French at Neuchatel and worked for a few years as a tutor in England, Ireland and Germany. She became interested in nature at an early age through the book Entdeckungsreisen in Feld und Flur by Hermann Wagner and she collected plants for a herbarium apart from sending notes on birds to Rudolf Blasius at a young age. In 1899, at the age of 30 she decided to study natural history at the University of Berlin. The conditions for her at attend university included the need to be in class five minutes before time and sit behind a folding screen. She was not to ask any questions during class and had to leave the premises only fifteen minutes after the end of the class. Snethlage was one of the pioneer women to attend university and she continued her studies in Jena and Freiburg, obtaining a doctorate in 1904, summa cum laude. Her thesis work was on insect musculature with August Weismann as thesis advisor. She then worked as a zoological assistant at the Berlin Natural History Museum before being hired by Em√≠lio Goeldi for the natural history museum in Bel√©m on the recommendation of Dr. A. Reichenow. Goeldi had worked since 1894 to head the Museo Paraense and when the Swiss zoologist Gottfried Hagmann (1874-1946) left the museum after disagreements with Goeldi, the vacancy was filled by Snethlage in 1905. Brazil Snethlage's work in the Brazilian Amazon took her to Acre and other remote places on collecting expeditions. She became the director of the Museu Paraense Em√≠lio Goeldi, after the death of botanist Jacques H√ºber, between 1914 and 1922. She wrote the Cat√°logo das Aves Amaz√¥nicas (1914). Snethlage was granted honorary membership in the British Ornithologists' Union in 1915. In 1921 she went to the National Museum in Rio de Janeiro, as \\"naturalista viajante.\\" She continued her studies of the Brazilian avifauna with field trips to Minas Gerais, Maranh√£o, Cear√°, Esp√≠rito Santo, Santa Catarina, Paran√°, S√£o Paulo state, and the Brazilian Amazon. On an expedition on the Curua, the main tributary of the Iriri in 1914 she was in a boat with her hand in the water when a piranha bit her. The cut became infected and she was forced to amputate, by herself, the middle finger of her right hand with a machete. She died of heart failure in Porto Velho, Rond√¥nia, and was buried at the cemetery of inocentes while on a field trip. In her last letter, written shortly before she died, Snethlage mentions meeting the English butterfly collector Margaret Fountaine.Lutz, Bertha. (1958) ‚ÄúEmilie Snethlage (1868-1929)‚Äù. In: Museu Nacional/Universidade do Brasil. Relat√≥rio annual, 1957 [Annual Report]. Rio de Janeiro. p. 39-43. Her nephew was the ethnologist Dr. Emil Heinrich Snethlage. Legacy Snethlage's tody-tyrant, Hemitriccus minor, was described as a new species by her, while the Madeira parakeet, Pyrrhura snethlageae, described as new to science in 2002, was named in her honour. Snethlage is also commemorated in the common and scientific names of the Emilia's marmoset (Mico emiliae), also known as Snethlage's marmoset, and the scientific names of two species of South American reptiles: Atractus snethlageae, a snake; and Loxopholis snethlageae, a gymnophthalmid lizard.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011).

Los Angeles Air Force Base houses and supports the headquarters of the United States Space Force's Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC). The center manages research, development and acquisition of military space systems. The 61st Air Base Group provides support functions for the base.  History  leftLos Angeles Air Force Base traces its history back to the Air Research and Development Command's Western Development Division, which was activated on 1 July 1954 in Inglewood, not far from the current base. In 1961, the Air Force developed a plan to consolidate its Space Systems Division and the Research and Development (R&D;) Center of The Aerospace Corporation, which had been created in 1960 to support Air Force space programs. The plan involved acquisition of two pieces of real estate adjoining the R&D; Center. An aircraft plant owned by the Navy, at the northwest corner of Aviation and El Segundo Boulevards, was transferred to the Air Force in October 1962. Another site, at the southwest corner of the same intersection, was owned by a mining company. The Aerospace Corporation acquired that site in November 1962 and built its new headquarters there between February 1963 and April 1964. By April 10, 1964, the Air Force property at the intersection of Aviation and El Segundo Boulevards was designated as Los Angeles Air Force Station, which was re-designated Los Angeles Air Force Base in September 1987. In 2006, Area A of LAAFB was permanently closed after a deal with a local builder to exchange the land in Area A for the creation of the Schriever Space Complex on Area B and other new facilities. In February 2007, a new base exchange opened up on Area B. The portion of Fort MacArthur remaining in military use is a sub-base of Los Angeles Air Force Base serving as a housing and administrative annex. Fort MacArthur is in the San Pedro district of Los Angeles, approximately twenty miles south-east of Los Angeles Air Force Base. Role and operations Los Angeles Air Force Base is headquarters to the Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC), a command of the United States Space Force. SMC is responsible for research, development, acquisition, on-orbit testing and sustainment of military space systems. In addition to managing Space Force space systems development, SMC participated in space programs conducted by other U.S. military services, government agencies and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) allies. SMC turns these systems over to the appropriate operating command. 61st Air Base Group The 61st Air Base Group provides medical, civil engineering, communications, chaplain, security, logistics, personnel, readiness, and quality-of-life services to the Space and Missile Systems Center and other Department of Defense units in the Los Angeles basin.

He played quarterback at Tulane and Northeast Louisiana and was taken in the third round of the 1986 NFL Draft by the Steelers. Brister played his high school football in Monroe, Louisiana, and originally enrolled at Tulane;. Bubby transferred to Northeast Louisiana (now Louisiana-Monroe) in 1982. Brister was originally drafted to play baseball in the fourth round out of high school by the Detroit Tigers. He played one season for the minor league Bristol Tigers before attending college for football. College career Brister began 1983 as Tulane's starting quarterback, before being replaced by Jon English. He then transferred to Northeast Louisiana.  Pittsburgh career  When Brister was selected, comparisons were almost immediately made between him and Steelers great Terry Bradshaw, who is also from Louisiana. Over the years, Pittsburgh sports writers and Steelers fans frequently made jokes about Brister's thick Southern accent and perceived lack of sophistication, traits that were similarly mocked in Bradshaw. In a similar vein, his name was often misspoken. In a 1999 Sports Illustrated article, Brister cited \\"Bubba Brewster\\" and \\"Bobby Blister\\" as common manglings. Brister spent two years as the backup to Bradshaw's immediate successor, Mark Malone, starting two games as a rookie in 1986 and appearing briefly in relief in two games in 1987. In his NFL debut in October 1986 Pittsburgh played on Monday Night Football against rival Cincinnati Bengals and Brister passed for 191 yards and scored a rushing touchdown, although the team lost, 24‚Äì22. He won a three-way competition for the Steelers' starting quarterback job with Todd Blackledge and Steve Bono. Career highlights during his 1988‚Äì1991 run as Pittsburgh's starting QB included ranking 4th in the NFL in average yards per pass completion in 1988 and ranking 10th in the league in passer rating in 1990. Brister had five scoring passes that were 65 yards or longer in 1988, including an 89-yard touchdown to Louis Lipps vs the Philadelphia Eagles on November 13 that was the longest pass completion by a Steeler in Three Rivers Stadium history. In 1989, he set a team record with 15 consecutive pass completions in a road win over Detroit, including a 48 yarder to Lipps. Brister also set a team record in 1989 throwing 178 consecutive passes without an interception. It was 1990 that Brister established career highs for starts (16), yards passing (2,725) and touchdown passes (20). Brister missed 8 games with injuries in 1991, setting up a competition with back up Neil O'Donnell for the starting job. Pittsburgh went 5-3 when Brister played, only 2-6 with O'Donnell as a starter. Brister was the starting quarterback during Hall Of Fame Coach Chuck Noll's final post season run with the Steelers, winning the 1989 AFC Wild Card in overtime on the road against the Houston Oilers, then losing a close game to eventual AFC champion Denver Broncos. Brister led an 82-yard drive at the end of the 4th quarter to tie the Houston game and force overtime. Against Denver, he passed for 229 yards and 1 touchdown, with no turnovers. One of Brister's famous quotes came after a 1991 game between the Houston Oilers and Pittsburgh Steelers. Pittsburgh was getting blown out, and coach Chuck Noll wanted to pull starter Neil O'Donnell and replace him with Brister to finish the hopeless game. Brister replied \\"I don't mop up for anybody.\\" O'Donnell was starting in place of an injured Brister. Even though Brister was not forced to enter that late-season loss against Houston, he did supplant the struggling O'Donnell the next week, starting the team's final two games, both wins over Cincinnati and Cleveland. Brister played for the Steelers for 7 years, several of them as the regular starter at quarterback. In 1992, new Steelers head coach Bill Cowher chose backup quarterback O'Donnell over Brister, effectively ending his career as a starting player for the Steelers. Still, Brister played a significant role in the team's 1992 success. Brister won two games as a starter for an injured O'Donnell against the Indianapolis Colts and Cleveland Browns. In the Cleveland game, the Steelers needed to win to clinch home field advantage throughout the AFC Playoffs and Brister passed for 223 yards, 1 touchdown, and no interceptions, and had a string of 11 consecutive pass completions in one stretch. In two other games Brister came off the bench, relieving a struggling O'Donnell when he was hurt and led fourth-quarter comebacks over the Seattle Seahawks and Detroit Lions.  Later career  After brief stops as a backup quarterback for the Eagles and New York Jets, Brister sat out the 1996 season. In his first season in Philadelphia in 1993, Brister ranked 7th in the league in passer rating and 4th in lowest interception percentage, starting 8 games with two relief appearances subbing for an injured Randall Cunningham. Highlights that season included his 27 completion, 245 yard, two touchdown performance vs. the Super Bowl champion Dallas Cowboys on Monday Night Football, and his 353-yard, three-touchdown performance in the final game of the regular season, again on Monday Night Football, leading the Eagles to a win over NFC West champion San Francisco. Brister's interception percentage that year was the lowest in Eagles team history for more than a decade until eclipsed by Donovan McNabb. His former teammate in Philadelphia, linebacker Bill Romanowski, had signed with the Denver Broncos and, in 1997, suggested to Broncos head coach Mike Shanahan that he take a look at Brister. Brister signed with Denver and became their number 3 quarterback for the 1997 season, backing up Hall of Fame quarterback John Elway and Jeff Lewis. Brister's only significant playing time in the 1997 season came in a week 17 game against the San Diego Chargers. Before the 1998 season, Lewis had fallen out of favor with the Broncos; thus, Brister became the primary backup quarterback. During the 1998 season, Elway was forced to sit out a number of games due to injury and Brister started those games in his place. He played well and the Broncos went undefeated in all of his starts (4-0); Brister also broke the team's (then) record for longest rushing touchdown by a quarterback and recorded a higher passer rating than Elway. However, when Elway retired in 1999, Brister was passed over for the starting spot in favor of Brian Griese, and the Broncos released him after that season. During his three seasons with the Broncos, he won two Super Bowl rings. Brister spent 2000 with the Vikings. He signed with the Kansas City Chiefs in 2001 but was cut before the season began. He then retired from football. He finished his career with a passing record of 1,207 completions in 2,212 attempts for 14,445 passing yards and 81 touchdowns. Brister played in three conference championship games and two Super Bowls.  After retiring  After retiring from football, Brister spent a short time as a television sports analyst for Fox Sports Rocky Mountain in Denver. In 2003, Brister became the co-host of a hunting and fishing oriented show called Louisiana Outdoor Adventures on The Outdoor Channel. In 2005, he joined the staff of Hunter's Specialties, a producer of hunting and fishing adventure videos. He lives in Mandeville, Louisiana, with his wife and two children.

The plot relays between a large cast of people affected in some way by the phenomenon; usually Lil' Slugger's victims or the detectives assigned to apprehend him. As each character becomes the focus of the story, details are revealed about their secret lives and the truth about Lil' Slugger. Plot Tsukiko Sagi, a shy character designer who created the immensely popular pink dog Maromi, finds herself under pressure to repeat her success. As she walks home one night, she is attacked by an elementary school boy on inline skates. Two police detectives, Keiichi Ikari and Mitsuhiro Maniwa, are assigned to the case. They suspect that Tsukiko is lying about the attack, until they receive word of a second victim. Soon the attacker, dubbed Lil' Slugger (Sh≈çnen Batto in Japanese, meaning \\"Bat Boy\\"), is blamed for a series of street assaults in Tokyo. None of the victims can recall the boy's face and only three distinct details are left in their memories: golden inline skates, a baseball cap, and the weapon: a bent golden baseball bat. Ikari and Maniwa set out to track down the perpetrator and put an end to his crimes. Their hunt is unsuccessful, however, and the investigation eventually leads to both men losing their positions as police detectives. As the attacks continue, it is revealed that they are not random. Instead, Lil' Slugger seems to target people in crisis, and the attacks, though violent, lead to some improvement in the life of the victim. Maniwa becomes convinced that Lil' Slugger is a supernatural force, driven to rescue the desperate from their tragedies through violence. He becomes obsessive, broadcasting his warning about Lil' Slugger via shortwave radio and seeking a way to kill the supernatural assailant. As public fear of Lil' Slugger intensifies, his attacks start to become deadly and the line between truth and fiction becomes blurred. At the same time, public anticipation for the launch of the Maromi television series reaches a fanatical high, almost as if the fear of one is feeding (and feeding off) the anticipation for the other. Things come to an end on the night that the Maromi show is set to air. Ikari, now a private security guard, and Maniwa, now a wandering \\"knight\\", attempt to battle Lil' Slugger, now an incredibly powerful force leaving a path of death and destruction throughout Tokyo. The two men confront Tsukiko where it is revealed that Maromi was based on a real puppy that Tsukiko had in childhood, whose leash she had one day accidentally dropped, allowing the puppy to run into traffic where it was killed. Fearing reprisal from her strict father, instead of taking responsibility for the puppy's death, young Tsukiko invented a story about a bat-wielding, skate-wearing puppy killer‚ÄîLil' Slugger's first \\"attack.\\" Ultimately, Lil' Slugger is a paranormal figment of Tsukiko's guilt and fear, brought inexplicably to life when the adult Tsukiko desperately needed to escape her responsibilities and then fed and nurtured by the fear of the populace. This was all further exacerbated by the public using Maromi as a form of escapism to avoid their own fears and anxieties. When Tsukiko finally confesses the truth, and in doing so accepts the guilt for the death of Maromi, Lil' Slugger is defeated. Two years later, with Tokyo fully recovered from Lil' Slugger's rampage and the reconstruction of city complete, a new character has captured the attention of the public. A cryptic warning from a wizened Maniwa implies that a new cycle is about to begin. Characters ; ; :One of the central characters of the series, she is a famous, but timid, character designer best known for a cartoonish dog named Maromi. She carries a plush toy copy of Maromi everywhere. She is Lil' Slugger's first apparent victim in the series, and the catalyst who jump-starts the plot. ; ; :The enigmatic figure the series revolves around. He appears as a grinning, baseball cap-wearing juvenile who travels on golden inline skates and attacks people with a gold-colored metal baseball bat that is curiously bent. ; ; :One of two police detectives assigned to investigate the attacks by the Lil' Slugger. He is extremely old fashioned and yearns for the simpler, less hurried times; he is often chastised for this by his young and idealistic partner Mitsuhiro Maniwa. ;Detective ; :Young, idealistic, and a flexible thinker, Maniwa is the perfect complement as well as foil to the more rustic Keiichi Ikari. He is open-minded and unconventional in his methods. ; ; :Maromi is a popular Sanrio-esque mascot created by Tsukiko. A pink dog with big black eyes and droopy ears, Maromi is a parody of real life (relaxing characters), such as tarepanda and rilakkuma. In Tsukiko's presence (usually when she is alone), Tsukiko's plush Maromi toy walks, rolls its eyes, and talks to her. Names Many of the characters in Paranoia Agent are often referred to with animal names, especially in each \\"Prophetic Vision\\" (a segment at the end of each episode that previews the next) and the episode \\"The Holy Warrior,\\" in which some characters are depicted as animal-like creatures.

The opening theme and the ending theme are performed by Hirasawa. Proposed film In December 2009, Japanese cult-film director Takashi Shimizu announced plans for a film adaption of the anime. However, plans eventually fell through and ultimately no film was ever made.Takashi Shimizu Produces 'Paranoia Agent' Reception A review in Empire gave Paranoia Agent three stars out of five, saying \\"for those who like their animation 'out there', Satoshi Kon's Paranoia Agent delivers by the oddball bucketload\\". Journalist Jean-Luc Bouchard, writing for BuzzFeed, praised Paranoia Agent as a depiction of depression. A review for IGN gave the first three episodes of Paranoia Agent a score of seven out of ten, comparing it to the works of David Lynch, but criticizing the animation as \\"downright primitive in places\\". Paste listed Paranoia Agent as the 14th best anime series of all time, comparing it to Kon's other works Paprika and Perfect Blue, saying \\"it's every bit the sublime exercise in psychological thriller as either\\".

Although a Pioneer Sergeant holds the rank of Sergeant in the army, the Pioneer Sergeant title itself is a regimental appointment rather than an official military rank. Pioneer Sergeants are found only in line infantry regiments and regiments of the Foot Guards, and are normally responsible for carpentry, joinery and related work. Since the Falklands conflict of 1982, most Line Infantry Regiments have re-introduced the establishment of one Assault Pioneer Platoon, commanded by the Assault Pioneer Sergeant as part of Headquarters Company, or Support Company. The modern Pioneers are fully trained in Mine warfare, Field Defences, including Obstacles, Explosives, and Demolitions, Watermanship, Water Supply, and General Engineering tasks. They are trained by the Royal Engineers to perform these works, and a series of qualifications are awarded to successful candidates. Upon successfully completing the Assault Pioneer Class one qualification, the soldier, of any rank, is allowed to wear the cross axes to show his trade status. The modern Pioneer Sergeant is normally responsible directly to Battalion Headquarters as their Combat Engineering adviser, in conjunction with the Assault Pioneer Warrant Officer. History and tradition The tradition of the pioneer sergeant began in the eighteenth century, when each British infantry company had a pioneer who marched at the head of the regiment. The pioneer wore a ‚Äústout‚Äù apron and carried an axe, ostensibly to clear a path for all who followed.Christopher Jobson, Looking forward looking back: customs and traditions of the Australian Army page 89, (Big Sky Publishing:2009), , The apron served to protect the pioneer sergeant's uniform whilst performing his duties. A tradition, dating perhaps from the early nineteenth century and possibly copied from the French, is that of infantry pioneers wearing full beards. This practice may have developed from the need for these men to perform duty as smiths, and so sported beards to protect the face. A general order of 1856 allowed for one pioneer per company in each regiment. The tools carried by the pioneers included a sawback sword, pickaxe, billhooks, shovels, and axes. citing and Walton, P.S., Simkin's Soldiers, The British Army in 1890, v.II The Infantry, Chippenham : Picton Publishing Ltd, 1987 In the modern era, the Pioneer Sergeant carries an axe on parade instead of a rifle and is the only soldier in the army who is allowed to wear a full beard, in deference to the ancient tradition. A Pioneer Sergeant can be identified by an embroidered badge of two crossed axes sewn above the Sergeant's rank chevrons on his sleeve. Uniform The pattern of dress within the British Army is dependent both on the regiment and the date. For example, the portrait of the Lance Sergeant above has elements distinctive of the Coldstream Guards, such as the cuff design the buttons down the tunic front clearly showing the two button spacing pattern that is a regimental distinction of the Coldstream Guards. The distinctions of the Pioneer Sergeant uniform consist of the badge of rank worn on the right arm consisting of three white chevrons, with crossed axes, and a small rose badge above. In the case of a Lance Sergeant, strips were white instead of gold as would be worn by a sergeant. A sergeant would also have worn a sash. In Australia In Australia, the tradition began in 1965 when Governor-General Lord De L‚ÄôIsle presented the 4th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (4RAR), with its Colours. On this occasion he suggested that the Battalion‚Äôs Pioneer Sergeant should wear a beard and carry an axe, as is the custom in the British Army. From 1973 to 1995 the 4th Battalion was linked with the 2nd Battalion (2RAR), and the tradition continued within the amalgamated Battalion (2/4RAR). In the early years of the twenty-first century 4RAR became a commando unit and removed the position of pioneer sergeant from its establishment, but the relevant standing orders allow for the Battalion to reinstate the position at a later date. In 2007 it was formally established that 2RAR could also have the bearded pioneer sergeant, making both 2 and 4RAR the only units within the Australian Army officially authorised to have bearded troops. On being re- posted the outgoing pioneer sergeant has his beard removed by the unit‚Äôs commanding officer in front of the entire battalion.

Early life and education Fabian Strachan Woodley was born on 19 July 1888, in Redland, Bristol, the son of William Augustus Woodley jnr. (1855-1933), a solicitor and part-proprietor of the Somerset County Gazette, and Ada Constance Woodley, nee Strachan (d. 29 December 1920); he had one younger brother, Seymour Woodley. His father remarried following the death of his mother in 1920. Woodley‚Äôs paternal grandfather was William Augustus Woodley (1817-1891), proprietor of the Somerset County Gazette from 1843. His great- grandfather, Rev. George Woodley (bap. 1786, d. 1846), was also a poet. Woodley was educated at Cheltenham College (1903‚Äì07, Southwood House) and University College, Oxford (BA, 1911). During his time at Cheltenham, he was a member of the Clifton Rugby Club; at Oxford, he was captain of his college rugby team. Woodley‚Äôs family were members of the Church of England. However, he was married in a Catholic church (1917), and he left money in his will to the administrator of a Catholic church, for the good of the poor of the parish (1957); it is therefore possible that Woodley converted to Catholicism in early life. Marriage Woodley married Ida Leonora Lees on 20 October 1917 at the Pro-Cathedral of the Holy Apostles, Clifton, whilst serving with the Royal Munster Fusiliers. His wife was granted a decree of nullity of marriage on 15 June 1922, on the grounds of ‚Äòthe inability of her husband to consummate the marriage‚Äô. Subsequently Ida Lees married Major Henry Aplin, DSO, TD, on 6 August 1924. Major Alpin had also served with the Royal Munster Fusiliers. He died suddenly on 9 July 1928. Career After university, Woodley appeared set for a career in newspapers, joining the staff of the Bristol Times and Mirror, and then moving to a London paper. Woodley served with distinction in World War I. In September 1914 he was appointed to a temporary commission in the New Army (often referred to as Kitchener's Army)The London Gazette, 2 October 1914, Pages 7813-7814 and posted to the 8th Service Battalion of the Royal Munster Fusiliers. He was promoted to Lieutenant in September 1915.Supplement to The London Gazette, 1 November 1915, Page 10745 He was appointed acting Captain on several occasions, 'whilst commanding Companies'.Supplement to The London Gazette, 29 November 1916, Page 11684Supplement to The London Gazette, 8 February 1917, Page 1366Supplement to The London Gazette, 2 April 1917, Page 3184Supplement to The London Gazette, 20 September 1917, Page 9741Supplement to The London Gazette, 18 December 1918, Page 14879Supplement to The London Gazette, 19 August 1919, Page 10544 Woodley was presented with three Divisional Parchment Certificates for gallantry in action and was awarded the Military Cross in October 1916: ‚ÄòFor conspicuous gallantry during operations. By his skill and determination he beat off three counter-attacks of the enemy, who were endeavouring to reach his trench. Four days later he led his men in two attacks with great pluck‚Äô. When recommending him for a permanent commission in August, 1918, his Commanding Officer wrote: \\"This officer has served continuously in France for a period of two years and 8 months, and has commanded a Company both in and out of the line, for 2¬Ω years‚Äù.Supplement to The London Gazette, 14 November 1916, Pages 11044 / 11071 The Gloucestershire Echo of Wednesday, 22 May 1918 reported Woodley had been wounded. Woodley‚Äôs medals (Military Cross, 1914-15 Star, British War Medal and Victory Medal) were auctioned by Dix Noonan Webb Ltd in May 2017, realising ¬£3,400. After the war, Woodley obtained a Diploma for Journalism (1920, presumably from London University), and worked with his father on the staff of the Somerset County Gazette, at Taunton. Woodley then taught English at several schools, including Wrekin College, and served with the Officers Training Corps;The London Gazette, 12 December 1922, Page 8799The London Gazette, 4 September 1923, Page 5993 he retired as a teacher at the Peter Symonds School, Winchester (a boys' grammar school), were he had taught for many years. Woodley was a director of the Somerset County Gazette group of newspapers, founded by his grandfather, William Augustus Woodley senior. Poetry Woodley‚Äôs only book of poetry, A Crown of Friendship, was published in 1921 by the family publishing and printing company, Woodley, Williams & Dunsford Ltd of Taunton. The book was 62 pages long and sold for 2s 6d. It contained 35 poems; eight of the poems were written during the war; two of the poems commemorate his mother, who had died the year before. The subject matter of some of the poems has caused Woodley to be categorised as a Uranian poet by some later critics. Considered more broadly, Woodley is a Georgian poet, using the term as a description of a poetic style (characterised by romanticism, sentimentality and hedonism), rather than in its strict sense. A Crown of Friendship was reviewed in several newspapers in the south-west of England, but it does not appear to have been noticed nationally. The reviews were generally favourable, but only hinted at the ‚Äòuranian‚Äô nature of some of the poems. The Cheltenham Chronicle observed ‚ÄòThere is a generous note running throughout‚Äîthe love and loyalty of a young and ardent soul for his friends‚Äîschoolmates, college mates, comrades in the Great War‚Äô. The Exeter and Plymouth Gazette thought that ‚ÄòIn some of the poems the Greek spirit is dominant, in others that of Faerie, and the poet loves Nature, the Great Mother‚Äô. The review in the Bath Chronicle and Weekly Gazette included a summary of Woodley‚Äôs life up to 1921.

Owned and operated by the government-owned Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, it broadcasts on 88.5 MHz using a directional antenna with an average effective radiated power of 11,510 watts and a peak effective radiated power of 25,000 watts (class B) from a transmitter atop Mount Royal. The station has a commercial-free news/talk format and is part of the CBC Radio One network which operates across Canada. Like all CBC Radio One stations, but unlike most FM stations, it broadcasts in mono. Some local shows and newscasts produced at CBME-FM are also heard on a chain of stations across Quebec. Its studios and offices, along with those of sister stations CBM-FM, CBF-FM and CBFX-FM are located at Maison Radio-Canada at 1400 Ren√© L√©vesque Boulevard East. Master control is at the Canadian Broadcasting Centre in Toronto. History The station was launched in 1933 on 1050 AM and was originally known as CRCM, operated by the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission. When ownership was transferred to the CBC in 1937, the station call sign became CBM and the frequency was changed to 960. On March 29, 1941, like most radio stations in North America, CBM moved to 940. Originally 5,000 watts, CBM's power was increased to 50,000 watts, the maximum power permitted by the CRTC for AM stations. Prior to 1978, CBM broadcast from a transmitter site near Marieville. In 1978 the CBC consolidated its two AM transmitters for Montreal at a site in Brossard, on the south shore of Montreal. The AM transmitter allowed CBM to be heard across most of the eastern half of North America at night, including much of Eastern Canada. However, it was difficult to hear in some parts of Montreal during the day. To solve the problem, CBM got permission to move to 88.5 FM on July 4, 1997.Decision CRTC 97-294 The FM transmitter went on the air in 1998, and the AM transmitter was shut down in May 1999, four months after French-language sister station CBF, which got permission to move to FM at the same time and which shared CBM's transmitter site in Brossard, shut down its own AM transmitter on 690 kHz. The 940 outlet is a Class A clear-channel station which is nulled slightly in the direction of Mexico City to protect the other Class A station on 940, XEQ-AM. There are plans to return it to service, offering French-language commercial programming. The call sign change to CBME-FM occurred in order to distinguish the station from sister station CBM-FM. Local programming The station's local programs are Daybreak (hosted by Mike Finnerty) in the morning and Homerun (hosted by Sue Smith) in the afternoon. The station also produces the Quebec edition of Radio Noon, which airs on all Radio One transmitters throughout the province. The station also broadcasts All in a Weekend on Saturday and Sunday mornings, and Cinq √† Six on Saturdays. Transmitters CBM once operated a large network of repeaters across the eastern two-thirds of Quebec. However, most of those repeaters were transferred to the license of CBVE-FM in Quebec City when it became a separate station in 1994. Because of deficiencies with the main FM signal which did not exist when the station was on AM, CBME-FM added FM rebroadcasting transmitters with directional antennas in the western part of Montreal (98 watts, from the corner of Cavendish and Sherbrooke Streets in Notre-Dame-de-Gr√¢ce) and in Cowansville (2,700 watts). The call sign CBME was formerly used for a low-power AM repeater in La Tuque which changed to CBVE-1.

To date, 1982 remains as their most active year, with 32 attacks; despite having mostly targeted tourist developments, it has also assassinated a number of French police personnel. In 1984, they attacked the Biarritz airport before the arrival of the French president Fran√ßois Mitterrand, who was accused by IK of \\"not respecting the Basque culture and national rights\\". Despite sharing the same goals and methods, it held an uneasy relation with ETA, a more powerful organization based in the Southern Basque Country, mostly because ETA has used the Northern Basque Country as a hideout and did not want to provoke the French Government in this regard. In 1998 it declared a unilateral truce, which broke when in 2000 it attacked a police station in Lecumberry and a tourism site in Bayonne. To date, it has not claimed any more actions, but another group, Irrintzi (probably numbering no more than one cell), followed IK's path in the French Basque Country by starting an on-off campaign against tourist targets.

In the 1990 film adaptation of the novel, Wilkes was portrayed by Kathy Bates, who won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her portrayal. A nurse by training, she has become one of the stereotypes of the nurse as a torturer and angel of mercy. Character background The novel provides Wilkes' backstory, stating that she was born in Bakersfield, California, on April 1, 1943, and graduated from the University of Southern California's nursing school with honors in 1966. After several years of working in hospitals across the country, she settled in a remote portion of Colorado's Western Slope. In both the book and film, Wilkes rescues protagonist Paul Sheldon after he breaks both of his legs in a car accident, and takes him to her home to convalesce. She fawns over Sheldon, a writer of romance novels starring her favorite literary character, Misery Chastain; she professes to be his \\"number one fan\\" and says that she loves him. She also implies that she has visited the hotel where Sheldon finishes his novels as he was staying there. These statements, and the fact that she is not in a hurry to take him to a hospital, make Sheldon uneasy. He has studied psychological disorders as part of his research for the Misery series, and suspects early on that Wilkes is mentally unstable. Wilkes is furious when she discovers Sheldon killed off Misery at the end of his latest novel. She tells him she has not called a hospital or told anybody about him and makes a veiled threat on his life. She holds him captive in her home and subjects him to a series of physical and psychological tortures. She also forces him to burn the only copy of a novel he felt would put him back on track as a mainstream author, and then makes him write a new novel bringing Misery back to life. Sheldon writes the book as Wilkes wants, but bridles at her treatment of him and manages to sneak out of his room several times while she's away. On one of his trips out of his room, Sheldon finds Wilkes' old scrapbook and learns from the newspaper clippings inside that she is a serial killer whose spree dates back to her childhood in Bakersfield. Among her victims were a neighboring family, her own father, her college roommate, and a hitchhiker with whom she had a brief fling. Sheldon also learns that she killed several patients at other hospitals where she worked. However, while serving as head maternity nurse at a hospital in Boulder, eleven infants in her care died under mysterious circumstances. She was tried for their deaths, but acquitted due to lack of evidence. Sheldon also finds that Wilkes was formerly married to a physical therapist named Ralph Dugan, who later divorced her, citing \\"mental cruelty\\". The last picture is an article about Sheldon's own disappearance, leading him to fear that he is Wilkes' next victim. Sheldon doesn't know it, but Wilkes has known all along that he has been sneaking around her house. This sets off one of the film's most infamous scenes, in which she breaks his ankles with a sledgehammer to stop him from escaping. In the book, she chops off his foot with an axe and cauterizes it with a blowtorch and later cuts off one of his thumbs with an electric knife when he complains about a missing letter on his typewriter (this never happens in the film). In the book, Wilkes brutally murders a Colorado state trooper who sees Sheldon in her house by stabbing him with a wooden cross and running him over with a lawnmower. In the film, the local sheriff comes to Wilkes' farm to investigate Sheldon's disappearance. Wilkes drugs Sheldon and hides him in her basement before subsequently killing the officer by shooting him in the back with a double-barreled shotgun when he hears Sheldon's cries for help. Wilkes then says they should \\"celebrate\\" the new novel in a murder‚Äìsuicide. Sheldon pretends to go along with it, telling her he needs a bottle of Dom P√©rignon champagne and a cigarette, as per his usual practice after finishing a book. He soaks the manuscript with lighter fluid he picked up in the basement and sets it ablaze. While Wilkes tries to put the fire out, Sheldon overpowers her by cracking her over the head with his typewriter and choking her. In the film, he chokes her with pages of the burnt novel. In the book, he chokes her with blank pages which she believes to be the book; the real novel is hidden from sight and was later published. She ultimately dies of a fractured skull; Sheldon is then rescued by police. In the book, she fractures her skull when she slips and falls against the mantle of the guest room bed. When the police go in to search the bedroom where Wilkes is believed to have died, they find it empty. It is later revealed that, despite being mortally wounded, she managed to escape the bedroom and died in her barn with her hands on a chainsaw, which she presumably intended to use on Sheldon. In the movie, Sheldon trips her up so she falls and cracks her head on the corner of the typewriter she forced him to use; she recovers from this and attacks him, but he kills her by ramming a metal statue of her pet sow pig ‚Äì named Misery after his stories ‚Äì into her head. Personality King characterizes Annie Wilkes as a cunning, brutal and devious woman who hides her malice behind a cheery fa√ßade. Both the novel and the film portray her as extremely paranoid, and also suggest that she may have bipolar disorder. In the novel, she has day-long bouts with depression, during which she is seen maiming herself; Sheldon also finds evidence that she gorges herself on vast quantities of food. She has an unhealthy obsession with romance novels, particularly Sheldon's Misery series. She abhors profanity, to the point that she will fly into fits of rage if it is used in front of her. She instead expresses anger with childishly strange words and phrases like \\"cockadoodie\\", \\"mister man\\", \\"dirty bird\\", \\"dirty birdy\\", \\"oogie\\", \\"fiddely- foof\\" and \\"rooty-patooties\\". In the novel, however, she lets more conventional profanities slip on occasion. She has violent tantrums over insignificant matters. For instance, when Sheldon complains that the packet of Eaton's Corrasable Bond paper she bought for him is smudge-prone, she smashes his still-healing knee; in the book, when he mentions that her typewriter is missing a key, she cuts off his thumb. King has noted that Wilkes \\"may seem psychopathic to us, but it's important to remember that she seems perfectly sane and reasonable to herself ‚Äì heroic, in fact, a beleaguered woman trying to survive in a hostile world filled with cockadoodie brats\\". In a special feature on the collectors' edition DVD, forensic psychologist Reid Meloy said that Wilkes' personality (as portrayed by Kathy Bates) is a virtual catalog of mental illness. According to Meloy, Wilkes has bipolar disorder, a severe borderline personality disorder with schizoid, schizotypal and obsessive‚Äìcompulsive features, and sadomasochism. He also believes her profile is typical of people who stalk celebrities. In his commentary on the film available on the DVD, director Rob Reiner notes that Wilkes is loosely based on that of Genene Jones, a nurse who is believed to have killed as many as 50 children who were in her care over a two-year period.  Other appearances  The fictional version of King that appears in The Dark Tower VII: The Dark Tower (2004) discusses Annie Wilkes. Annie Wilkes is mentioned in Kim Newman's novella, The Other Side of Midnight. In the novel, which is set in Newman's alternate history crossover Anno Dracula series, Wilkes is the murderer of John Lennon. When she is arrested for the crime, she tells the press that she loved Lennon, but that he had to die for splitting up the Beatles. Kathy Bates reprises her role as Annie Wilkes in a 2008 commercial for DirecTV, with the setting being the infamous scene where she breaks Paul Sheldon's ankles. There is also Tamil film Julie Ganapathi from 2003 directed by Balu Mahendra, based loosely on the novel, and South Indian actress Saritha playing film's title character Julie Ganapathi, which is based on the Annie Wilkes character.Eat This With Some Fava Beans The novel was later adapted into a play, which went on to Broadway from November 2015 to February 2016. Annie was played by Laurie Metcalf. At the 70th Annual Tony Awards, Metcalf was nominated for Best Actress in a Play for her performance. There are also two Finnish play adaptations called Piina based on the 1990 film adaptation's screenplay by William Goldman.

Owned and operated by the government-owned Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, it transmits on 95.1 MHz from the Mount Royal candelabra tower with an effective radiated power of 100,000 watts (class C1) using an omnidirectional antenna. Its studios and master control are located at Maison Radio-Canada in Montreal. The station has a non-commercial news/talk format and is the flagship of the Ici Radio-Canada Premi√®re network which operates across Canada. Like all Premi√®re stations, but unlike most FM stations, it broadcasts in mono. In the summer of 2018, the Montreal 95.1 station started to broadcast in FM multiplex. History CBF went on the air on December 11, 1937, as the CBC launched its French-language network, known as Radio-Canada. CBF operated on 910 using 50,000 watts full-time with an omnidirectional antenna as a clear channel Class I-A station. The transmitter was located in Contrecoeur. The station moved to 690 on March 29, 1941, as a result of the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement. In 1978 the CBC consolidated its two Montr√©al AM broadcast transmitters and the station moved to a new transmitter site shared with CBM in Brossard (Now known as CBME-FM on 88.5 FM). CBF started to broadcast from Maison Radio-Canada in November 1971. Commercial advertising on the station was eliminated in 1974 except for Montreal Canadiens hockey games. (CBF was the Canadiens' radio flagship since its opening in 1937 and would remain so until 1997.) CBF applied to move to FM and was authorized to do so by the CRTC on July 4, 1997.Decision CRTC 97-293 The AM signal covered much of the western half of Quebec, and was strong enough to be heard in Ottawa and the National Capital Region, as well as parts of New York State and Vermont. Indeed, until CBOF signed on in 1964, CBF doubled as the Radio-Canada outlet for Ottawa as well. Its nighttime signal covered most of the eastern half of North America, including much of Eastern Canada. However, radio frequency interference rendered it almost unlistenable in parts of Montreal during the day, which prompted the decision to move the station to the FM dial. The FM transmitter was put on the air ahead of schedule on January 22, 1998, and initially had special programming targeting people affected by the 1998 Ice Storm (i.e., people without electricity). The AM signal was shut down on January 21, 1999. (English-language sister station CBM got permission to move to FM and started FM operations at the same time, retaining its AM signal until May 14, 1999.) CBF became CBF-FM when it moved to the FM dial. The existing station with the CBF-FM callsign at 100.7 MHz was renamed CBFX-FM. The station's old home at 690 was taken over by CKVL, which moved from 850 under the new callsign CINF. That station closed down in 2010, and the frequency remained dark until 2012, when English-language sports station CKGM moved there. To improve reception, CBF was authorized to increase its power from 17,030 watts to 100,000 watts on June 2, 2000. The power increase was implemented in mid-2001. In recent years the popularity of the station has increased significantly. The station is now usually one of the top five stations in Bureau of Broadcast Measurement ratings (using shares), after decades of being an also-ran. On September 27, 2018, CBF-FM began broadcasting in HD Radio for compatible receivers, with its second digital radio subchannel offering ICI Musique Classique, a digital-only music feed.https://communiques.radio-canada.ca/radio/8278/ICI-MUSIQUE-CLASSIQUE- ACCROIT-SON-RAYONNEMENT-POUR-SON-PREMIER-ANNIVERSAIRE (in french) Transmitters On October 17, 1986 the CRTC approved the CBC's application to change CBF-3's frequency from 1400 to 650 kHz. (Now part of CHLM- FM).86-1031 CBF-FM-10 in Sherbrooke and CBF-FM-8 in Trois-Rivi√®res were once full satellites of CBF, but began airing some local programming in 1998. They have both been licensed as full-fledged stations since 2000, despite still having rebroadcaster-like call signs. Both stations have their own local programs and news bulletins; otherwise, their schedules are similar to CBF. On July 5, 2010, the CBC applied to decrease the effective radiated power of CBF-20, and also on the same date, the CBC also applied to broadcast, on the rebroadcasting transmitters CBF-16, CBF-17 and CBF-18, the programming of CBF-8 instead of the programming of CBF. All technical parameters of the rebroadcasters would remain unchanged.Broadcasting Notice of Consultation CRTC 2010-454 numbers 3 and 4 On July 29, 2010, the CRTC approved the application to transfer transmitters CBF-1, CBF-3 and CBF-4 from CBF to CHLM-FM Rouyn- Noranda.Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2010-527 On October 30, 2012, the CBC received approval to change the source of programming from CBF to CBFG-FM Chisasibi on the following repeaters:Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2012-599 CBFG- FM Chisasibi ‚Äì New transmitters and revocation of licences, CRTC, October 30, 2012Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2012-602-1 CFFB Iqaluit ‚Äì New transmitters in Puvirnituq, Kuujjuarapik, Inukjuak, Salluit and Kuujjuaq (Fort Chimo) ‚Äì Correction, CRTC, November 5, 2012 CBFA-1 Manawan, CBFA-2 Obedjiwan, CBFW Wemindji, CBFM Mistissini, CBFA-3 Wemotaci, CBFH Waskaganish and CBFV Waswanipi.

It received a full license on March 5, 1948, as CBF-FM, broadcasting at 95.1 MHz.Broadcasting Yearbook 1965 page B-181 For most of its early years, it simulcast co-owned CBF. Occasionally in the 1960s and 70s, it would break away from its AM counterpart to air special programming. With the CBC's English- language FM network already established since the 1960s, plans were made to create a French-language FM network, with CBF-FM as its originating station. In 1971, in preparation for its role as the French FM flagship, CBF-FM swapped frequencies with CBM-FM. CBF-FM moved to 100.7, just vacated by CBM-FM, while that station moved to a new frequency, 93.5 MHz.Broadcasting Yearbook 1973 page B-236 The move not only allowed CBF-FM to boost its signal to a full 100,000 watts, but it also began to broadcast in stereo for the first time. In 1972, La Cha√Æne Culturelle (The Cultural Network) was launched on four CBC- owned FM stations, CBF-FM in Montreal, CBOF-FM in Ottawa, CBV-FM in Quebec City and CBJ-FM in Chicoutimi. The network aired mostly classical music with some jazz and other arts programming. In 1998, CBF-FM changed its call sign. Its AM sister station, CBF, moved to the FM band and picked up the CBF-FM call letters. That required the former CBF-FM to switch to a new call sign, CBFX- FM. In 2004, the network was renamed Espace Musique. And in 2014, it became Ici Musique, still with 100.7 CBFX-FM as its originating station.

The Trois-Rivi√®res repeater at 104.3 MHz will upgrade to an average ERP of 45,400 watts, and a maximum ERP of 100,000 watts (up from 43,000 watts max ERP currently) with an effective height above average terrain of 249.7 metres.

He is best known for his appearances with the professional wrestling promotions the World Wrestling Federation/World Wrestling Entertainment and World Championship Wrestling in the late 1990 and early 2000s under the ring names Shawn Stasiak and Meat. Championships held by Stasiak over the course of his career include the WCW World Tag Team Championship and WWF Hardcore Championship. Stasiak is the son of former WWWF Champion Stan Stasiak.Intelius search  Early life  Born in the United States, Stipich was raised in Oakville, Ontario, Canada. He attended White Oaks Secondary School, where he wrestled in Ontario Federation of School Athletic Associations events. After graduating, he attended Boise State University, studying communications. During his studies, Stipich made it to second place in the Pacific-10 Conference in two consecutive years.  Professional wrestling career = Early career (1996‚Äì1998)  Stipich trained as a professional wrestler under Dory Funk, Jr., debuting in 1996 under the ring name \\"Shawn Stasiak\\" for the Vancouver-based independent promotion Pacific Coast Championship Wrestling.  World Wrestling Federation (1998‚Äì2000)  In 1996, Stipich sent a tape consisting of vignettes to the World Wrestling Federation, with one of the segments seeing him dressed up as a Halloween character named Fobia and instructing kids on how to trick-or- treat safely. After reviewing the tape, the WWF allowed him to have a tryout match in October 1997. Stipich was then signed to a developmental deal in January 1998, and he began training with Tom Prichard in the Memphis, Tennessee-based Power Pro Wrestling, where he stayed until he was called up to the WWF in 1999. While with PowerPro, one of the angles he was involved in revolved around Jerry Lawler and his real life wife, Stacy \\"The Kat\\" Carter. Stasiak first won the services of Stacy for two weeks by beating Jerry Lawler in a match. He then claims that they have started a relationship, and he introduces Stacy to his \\"sister\\" (storyline).https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQaClPfRGfY The next week, he introduces Stacy to his \\"mother\\", Mae Young.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WC2vmJWSnQ This begins a series of different matches between Stasiak, Lawler, Mae Young, and Stacy. He made his WWF debut on the April 13, 1999 episode of Sunday Night Heat as Meat, attacking Tiger Ali Singh. He soon became the storyline \\"boy-toy\\" of the Pretty Mean Sisters (Terri Runnels, Jacqueline, and Ryan Shamrock), although Shamrock left the company a few months later. Meat picked up many victories for a few months over the likes of Droz, Brian Christopher, and The Blue Meanie. However, he would soon be relegated to that of a jobber, with the on- air explanation for this was that he would tire himself out before matches by sexually pleasuring PMS. This led to Jacqueline leaving Meat and Terri by themselves. The character only lasted a few months before he split from Terri after Terri saw Meat kissing Marianna, Terri's nemesis, on the Titantron. This led to her and Chaz attacking Meat. In the next couple of weeks, Stipich dropped the Meat name and began to compete under his Shawn Stasiak name. At Survivor Series, Stasiak was defeated by the debuting Kurt Angle. Stasiak was later suspended in December 1999 after he recorded a heated conversation between Davey Boy Smith and Steve Blackman without their permission. Although Stasiak stated that this was done as a joke, he was fired regardless.  World Championship Wrestling (2000‚Äì2001)  After working on the independent circuit, Stasiak was signed by World Championship Wrestling in early 2000. After training in the company's Power Plant wrestling school with Paul Orndorff, he made his WCW debut on the April 10, 2000 episode of Nitro by attacking Curt Hennig. He later joined the New Blood and began feuding with Hennig. He was soon given nicknames such as \\"The Perfect One\\" and later \\"PerfectShawn\\" Stasiak, the latter of which was a parody of Hennig's \\"Mr. Perfect\\" character. Stasiak picked up two victories over Hennig, one of which was Stasiak's WCW pay-per-view debut on May 7, 2000 at Slamboree. Hennig soon became impressed with Stasiak and briefly coached him before Hennig's WCW contract expired in June 2000. In late-May, Stasiak formed the tag team called the Perfect Event with Chuck Palumbo, and they soon won the World Tag Team Championship after defeating KroniK (Brian Adams and Bryan Clark). After winning the title, they began feuding with KroniK over the title. In August, the Perfect Event helped form The Natural Born Thrillers alongside Mike Sanders, Sean O'Haire, Mark Jindrak, Johnny the Bull and Reno, while they were briefly \\"coached\\" by Kevin Nash. Stasiak and Palumbo would later win the World Tag Team Title two more times before splitting in early January 2001 when Stasiak and Palumbo won a tag team battle royal with O'Haire and Jindrak. Sanders declared both teams victorious and that one member from each team would start teaming together and get a tag team title shot against The Insiders (Diamond Dallas Page and Kevin Nash). Palumbo began teaming with O'Haire and they defeated the Insiders and became the World Tag Team Champions while Stasiak and Jindrak began teaming together. In February 2001, the Natural Born Thrillers broke up when Stasiak and Jindrak became jealous of Palumbo and O'Haire. The two teams faced off at SuperBrawl Revenge on February 18, 2001 for the World Tag Team Title, but Palumbo and O'Haire retained. In March 2001, Stasiak acquired the services of Miss Hancock as his valet, gaining the nickname \\"The Mecca of Manhood\\" in the process. He was also, in storyline, hinted as the alleged father of Hancock's baby, which later turned out to be a stack of 8x10 cameras in a stroller. As a heel, Stasiak used the cameras to take pictures of himself before throwing the pictures to fans as a way to show off his physique. While with Miss Hancock, he also started a brief feud with Bam Bam Bigelow. The feud culminated on the very last episode of Nitro on March 26, 2001, as Stasiak defeated Bigelow in a tattoo match. Following this, WCW was purchased by the World Wrestling Federation and most of the talent contracts, including Stasiak's, were picked up.  Return to WWF/WWE (2001‚Äì2002)  Stasiak returned to the WWF in July 2001 as part of The Alliance after WCW was bought by the WWF. Stasiak won at InVasion where he, Kanyon, and Hugh Morrus defeated The Big Show, Billy Gunn, and Albert. Throughout August, he was given the gimmick of being clumsy while trying to impress the Alliance's leader, Stone Cold Steve Austin. Every time he tried attacking major WWF stars such as The Rock or Kurt Angle, he would run into a wall, statue, milk truck, or just completely miss and trip over his boots. In late August, Stasiak was also briefly paired with Stacy Keibler again, but she stopped being his valet in late September to manage the Dudley Boyz. He was injured soon after and was out of action until late October. On November 18 at Survivor Series, Stasiak, in storyline, lost his job along with all of the Alliance members when Team WWF defeated Team Alliance. The Alliance members still worked house shows and dark matches for a while, however, until being ready to be called up to the main active roster. However, Stasiak was injured in late November and required surgery on his knee to remove his damaged bursa sac. He was later cleared to wrestle on January 1, 2002. In February 2002, Stasiak was sent to the Heartland Wrestling Association for training and to work off ring rust. Stasiak was later called up to the Raw brand in late-March 2002 and had his return televised match on the April 7, 2002 edition of Sunday Night Heat, defeating Tommy Dreamer and the following week on Sunday Night Heat Stasiak was defeated by Goldust. Stasiak made his return on the April 15, 2002 episode of Raw with a new character that saw him claim that he was from Planet Stasiak, heard voices in his head, talked to himself with rhymes, and acted comically insane. On this same night, Stasiak was defeated by Big Show. Stasiak traded the Hardcore Championship several times with the likes of Steven Richards, Justin Credible, Bradshaw, and Tommy Dreamer until he requested his early release on September 27, 2002 to pursue other business ventures.  Chiropractic career  After his release, Stipich retired from wrestling and became a chiropractor. He currently works for the Advanced Comprehensive Medical team based out of Texas as a chiropractor. In 2007, he received a certificate in manipulation under anesthesia from the Academy of Physical and Manual Medicine in New York. In addition to his work as a chiropractor, Stipich also works as a motivational speaker and uses the Fobia character he created while in college during his talks with children.  Other media  In September 2007, his documentary \\"Determined\\" was released on DVD. Personal life Stipich is the son of former WWWF Champion Stan Stasiak. During his early childhood, Stipich travelled with his father as he wrestled in various territories, and met the likes of Andr√© the Giant and Jesse \\"The Body\\" Ventura during this time.

Career to Stormont West was born in County Fermanagh and educated at Portora Royal School in Enniskillen. He worked as a farmer, taking an interest in local government, but it was not until 1954 that he entered Stormont as member for the Enniskillen seat, succeeding Thomas Nelson. In 1960 he was appointed Minister of Agriculture in the government of Lord Brookeborough, which he was to retain under the leadership of Terence O'Neill. He became one of a number of Stormont MPs critical of O'Neill's conciliatory approach towards Nationalists and in 1969 he had the whip withdrawn, along with William Craig. In 1971 the whip was restored under the new Ulster Unionist leader and Prime Minister of Northern Ireland Brian Faulkner. West became Minister of Agriculture once more and retained that position until the Stormont government was dissolved in 1972. Sunningdale West emerged as a fierce critic of the negotiations that would lead to the Sunningdale Agreement, and led the \\"anti-White Paper\\" Unionists in the Northern Ireland Assembly, 1973. When in January 1974 the Ulster Unionist Council voted against Faulkner's course of action the latter was forced into resignation. West succeeded him as leader of the party and sought to regain much of the support that the party had lost to breakaway and other Unionist groupings. In the February 1974 general election West negotiated the United Ulster Unionist Coalition with the Vanguard Progressive Unionist Party, led by Craig, and the Democratic Unionist Party, led by Ian Paisley, which would put up a single anti-Sunningdale Unionist candidate in all twelve constituencies on a platform of abolishing the power-sharing executive. West himself stood in Fermanagh and South Tyrone and won, albeit due to a split nationalist vote. The UUUC campaigned fiercely for the abolition of the executive, which came about in May 1974 following a general strike. West continued to seek ways to expand unionism and recruited the ex-Conservative Member of Parliament Enoch Powell to the party. Powell stood for and won the South Down constituency in the October 1974 general election, but his opposition to the restoration of Stormont and preference for greater integration with the United Kingdom was to cause ruptures within the party. West himself lost his seat in Parliament due to a pact between Nationalists, so having the dubious distinction of being the only MP who served between the two general elections in 1974 who never served in any other Parliament, but he remained leader of the party. The UUUC lasted another few years and won the overwhelming majority of the seats in the 1975 Northern Ireland Constitutional Convention which sought to gain consensus on the future of the province. When the Vanguard Party fell apart over proposals for a voluntary coalition with the Social Democratic and Labour Party, West negotiated with Craig for the majority faction to merge into the Ulster Unionists. The 1979 general election was relatively disappointing for the Ulster Unionists, as they won only five of the province's twelve constituencies. In June 1979 West stood as one of two candidates in the first elections to the European Parliament. However he was unsuccessful in the Single Transferable Vote constituency for the entire province and had the personal humiliations of seeing rival DUP leader Ian Paisley top the poll, fellow Ulster Unionist John Taylor win one of the seats and former Ulster Unionist member James Kilfedder performing better than West to become runner up. West resigned shortly afterwards.  April 1981 by-election in Fermanagh and South Tyrone  He remained active in the Ulster Unionists for some years and was the party's unsuccessful candidate in the bitter April 1981 by- election in Fermanagh and South Tyrone caused by the death of the sitting MP Frank Maguire, West received 29,046 votes and was defeated by Bobby Sands standing on an Anti-H-Block/Armagh Political Prisoner ticket with 30,493 votes; Sands died twenty-six days after his election. West was considered to have fought a lacklustre campaign, and the UUP chose Ken Maginnis instead to fight the second by-election; although he did not win he was considered to have fought a more dynamic campaign. Afterwards West remained a member of the Ulster Unionist Council and was highly critical of his successor, James Molyneaux, for his opposition to proposals for power sharing devolution. Family He was married to Maureen Hall and they had four sons and three daughters. He was a Presbyterian. His nephew is James Cooper, who was chairman of the Ulster Unionist Party from 2003 to 2005 and unsuccessfully was the Party's candidate in Fermanagh and South Tyrone in 2001.

The company is the largest petrochemical company in Latin America and has become a major player in the international petrochemical market (8th largest resin producer worldwide).  Products  Braskem is the Americas‚Äô top thermoplastic resins producer. With 36 industrial plants spread across Brazil, United States, Mexico and Germany, the company produces over 16 million tons of thermoplastic resins and other petrochemicals per year. Braskem is the world‚Äôs leading biopolymers producer with its 200,000 tons Green PE plant that produces polyethylene from sugarcane-based ethanol.  Basic petrochemicals  Braskem controls the three largest petrochemical complexes in Brazil, located in the cities of Cama√ßari, Bahia, Mau√°, S√£o Paulo and Triunfo, Rio Grande do Sul. Besides these three petrochemical complexes, Braskem also controls a complex in Duque de Caxias, Rio de Janeiro, which is based on gas rather than naphtha. Its basic petrochemical units account for the supply of ethylene and propylene to the company's nearby polymer units. The company also produces other chemical products such as benzene, butadiene, toluene, xylene and isoprene. These compounds are mostly sold to other chemical companies based within the same complexes, such as Innova S.A., Elekeiroz and Dow Chemical. Although its main feedstock is naphtha, Braskem's green ethylene plant was inaugurated in September, 2010. This green ethylene plant is an important step forward in the strategy of becoming a global leader in sustainable chemicals. The plant is the largest industrial-scale operation in the world producing ethylene made from 100% renewable raw materials, i.e., sugar-cane; however, Sugar cane and other energy crops are not green, nor renewable if the fertilizers used to grow the crops were produced from fossil fuel, such as synthetic nitrogen...NH3. The project was conceived and installed in less than two years based on Braskem‚Äôs proprietary technology. Located at the Triunfo petrochemical complex in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, the plant produces 200,000 tons of green ethylene, which will be transformed into an equivalent volume of green plastic.  Polymers  Braskem is Brazil's main producer of polyethylene, polypropylene and polyvinyl chloride ‚Äì PVC, with 5.7 million tons of resins capacity production in Brazilian territory. The company is also the leader in the US polypropylene market, with 1.5 million tons of capacity production. In addition, its polypropylene capacity production in Germany is 545,000 tons. Braskem is also implementing an integrated petrochemical complex in Mexico. The complex will consist of a cracker using ethane as feedstock, and three integrated polyethylene plants with a combined annual capacity of 1.05 million tons. The complex will begin production by mid-2015. Developed through a joint venture with the Mexican group Idesa, the project will increase the share of gas in the company‚Äôs feedstock matrix, improving its competitiveness.  History  Braskem was formed in 2002, already Latin America's leading petrochemical company, with industrial units and offices in Brazil, as well as commercial bases in the United States and Argentina. The company was formed by the consolidation of six companies: Copene, OPP, Trikem, Nitrocarbono, Proppet and Polialden. In 2006, Braskem acquired Politeno, the third largest polyethylene producer in Brazil. The company joined Petrobras and Ultrapar the following year in the biggest merger in Brazilian history, when those three companies acquired Grupo Ipiranga for US$4 billion.[3] While Petrobras and Ultrapar shared the fuel distribution operations, Braskem took over Ipiranga Petroqu√≠mica, Ipiranga's former petrochemical operation. In 2016, Braskem was fined $957 million over a bribery scandal.  Braskem America  Braskem America is the leading producer of polypropylene in the United States, with five production plants located in Texas, Pennsylvania and West Virginia, and a Technology and Innovation Center in Pittsburgh. Headquartered in Philadelphia, Braskem America is a wholly owned subsidiary of Braskem S.A. Braskem Europe is headquartered in Frankfurt, Germany with two plants in Schkopau and Wesseling. Braskem Europe is a wholly owned subsidiary of Braskem S.A.  Purchases  On January 22, 2010, Braskem announced the acquisition of Quattor, in line with its strategy to strengthen the Brazilian petrochemical chain and become one of the five largest and most competitive petrochemical companies in the world. The acquisition of Quattor Participa√ß√µes S.A., Unipar Comercial e Distribuidora S.A., and Polibutenos S.A. Ind√∫strias Qu√≠micas was unanimously and fully approved by the board of directors of the Administrative Council of Economic Defense (CADE) on February 23, 2011. On February 1, 2010, Braskem announced the acquisition of the PP assets of Sunoco Chemicals, 4th largest polypropylene producer in the U.S. The transaction represented an important step in Braskem‚Äôs international expansion process, offering the combination of growth in the U.S. market, with alternative sources of raw materials at competitive costs and access to major consumer markets. With this acquisition, Braskem has become the 3rd largest polypropylene player in the world. On July 27, 2011, Braskem announced the acquisition of the polypropylene business (PP) of Dow Chemical. The transaction involved 4 industrial units, 2 plants in the United States and 2 plants in Germany. The U.S. assets, located in Freeport, Texas and Seadrift, Texas, have combined production capacity of 505 kton, which represents 50% of the country‚Äôs annual PP production of 1,425 kton. The German assets, located in the cities of Wesseling and Schkopau, have combined annual production capacity of 545 kton. On September 30, 2011, the acquisition was approved by the antitrust agencies of the United States, the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice, as well as the European Union. The transaction represented an important step forward in consolidating the company‚Äôs international expansion and positioned it as the largest PP producer in the United States. In 2012, the company commissioned a new PVC plant with annual production capacity of 200 kton in the state of Alagoas. Braskem also expanded its production of butadiene, a key input used by the rubber industry, at its plant located in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, which increased its annual production capacity of this product by 100 kton; in line with its strategy of adding value to the existing chains. In 2014, the company completed its investment in the expansion and conversion of one of its polyethylene production lines in Bahia to produce metallocene- based LLDPE. This resin, of more modern technology, will supply the plastic film industry.

These pioneers were normally employed to march in front of the advancing army, clearing the route as necessary. They could also construct defenses and bivouac facilities. More recently (since the Second World War) assault pioneers have normally formed a Platoon in infantry battalions, and such platoons can be found in a number of British Army and Commonwealth infantry units. In some of these armies, soldiers serving in the Assault Pioneer Platoon can be identified by a specialist skill badge of two crossed felling axes sewn on their uniforms. These felling axes have traditionally been iconic of the pioneer in various armies throughout history. The wearing of beards by Assault Pioneers has also been a traditional practice at various times in infantry battalions of British and Commonwealth armies, such as those of Australia and Canada. This tradition began in the French Army (possibly in Napoleonic times) and was one of the dress practices adopted by the British after their defeat of Napoleon in 1815 (along with the Foot Guards bearskin headdress). In the Australian and Canadian armies, on special occasions some battalions may still parade a ceremonial detachment of assault pioneers in historical uniforms wearing leather aprons, gauntlets and gaiters, and carrying the various tools of their trade such as felling axes, crosscut saws, hatchets and billhooks, picks and shovels. Assault Pioneers do not replace combat engineers: the latter have a much greater range of skills, capabilities and resources. Instead, Assault Pioneers are intended to provide the infantry battalion with its own integral (\\"organic\\") light engineering support in the same sense as the Mortar Platoon provides the same battalion with its own 'organic' indirect fire support. This organic support permits the infantry battalion to conduct operations effectively without relying on the external support of Combat Engineers who are normally subject to a demanding list of priority tasks across the battlefield. On operations Assault Pioneers often work separately in small detachments providing specialist skills, tools and advice to the infantry companies and platoons with those sub-units providing the bulk of the labour. The term 'Assault Pioneer' reflects the tradition (arising in the First and Second World Wars) of employing these soldiers in the first wave of assaults on fortified enemy positions, using their skills and equipment to support the attacking force in crossing and breaching the enemy's defenses. While Assault Pioneers normally function in a specialist role, they are infantry soldiers first and are fully capable of engaging in combat as needed.  British Army  During World War II British Army Pioneer Platoons had ten Pioneers plus tradesmen. In 1944 they were renamed Assault Pioneer Platoons and had two Assault Sections plus one Pioneer Section. The five man strong Assault Sections had a jeep and trailer and a 3-ton lorry. The Assault Sections had specialist men and equipment for the disposal of mines and breaching obstacles. The Pioneer Section had eight tradesmen, a mason, a bricklayer and six carpenters. The Pioneer Section was used to turn buildings into accommodation for riflemen; riflemen were the principal unit in the British and American army. ;Composition *Assault Section **Commander (Corporal), armed with a rifle **Driver for Jeep (Private) armed with a Sten submachine gun **Three Pioneers (Privates) with rifles *Pioneer Section **Pioneer Sergeant (Sergeant) with rifle **Bricklayer (Private), with rifle **Mason (Private), with rifle **Six Carpenters (Privates), with rifles **Driver for 3-ton lorry (Private) with Sten See also * Pioneer Sergeant * Combat engineering References Category:British Army specialisms Category:Combat occupations Category:Military engineering ","title":"Assault pioneer"},{"id":"1873452","text":"Filippo De Filippi (April 20, 1814 ‚Äì February 9, 1867) was an Italian doctor, traveler and zoologist.

Sorolla excelled in the painting of portraits, landscapes and monumental works of social and historical themes. His most typical works are characterized by a dexterous representation of the people and landscape under the bright sunlight of Spain and sunlit water.\\"By reason of his native genius and stubborn will-power he became what he is‚Äîthe painter of vibrating sunshine without equal. Let there be no mincing of comparisons in this assertion. Not Turner, not Monet, painted so directly blinding shafts of sunlight as has this Spaniard.\\" (James Gibbons Huneker, quoted in Peel, Edmund: The Painter Joaquin Sorolla, Philip Wilson Publishers, Ltd., 1989, p. 13.) Biography=Early life Joaqu√≠n Sorolla was born on 27 February 1863 in Valencia, Spain. Sorolla was the eldest child born to a tradesman, also named Joaquin Sorolla, and his wife, Concepci√≥n Bastida. His sister, Concha, was born a year later. In August 1865, both children were orphaned when their parents died, possibly from cholera. They were thereafter cared for by their maternal aunt and uncle, a locksmith.Sorolla, Francisco Pons: \\"Sorolla: his Painting and his Family\\", The Painter Joaquin Sorolla, p. 19. The death of Pedro Velarde y Santill√°n during the defence of the Monteleon Artillery Barracks, 1884 He received his initial art education at the age of 9 in his native town, and then under a succession of teachers including Cayetano Capuz, Salustiano Asenjo. At the age of eighteen he traveled to Madrid, vigorously studying master paintings in the Museo del Prado. After completing his military service, Sorolla, at age twenty-two, obtained a grant which enabled a four-year term to study painting in Rome, Italy, where he was welcomed by and found stability in the example of Francisco Pradilla, the director of the Spanish Academy in Rome. A long sojourn to Paris in 1885 provided his first exposure to modern painting; of special influence were exhibitions of Jules Bastien-Lepage and Adolf von Menzel. Back in Rome he studied with Jos√© Benlliure, Emilio Sala, and Jos√© Villegas Cordero.Peel, p. 244. In 1888, Sorolla returned to Valencia to marry Clotilde Garc√≠a del Castillo, whom he had first met in 1879, while working in her father's studio. By 1895, they would have three children together: Maria, born in 1890, Joaqu√≠n, born in 1892, and Elena, born in 1895. In 1890, they moved to Madrid, and for the next decade Sorolla's efforts as an artist were focussed mainly on the production of large canvases of orientalist, mythological, historical, and social subjects, for display in salons and international exhibitions in Madrid, Paris, Venice, Munich, Berlin, and Chicago.Peel, p. 14. His first striking success was achieved with Another Marguerite (1892), which was awarded a gold medal at the National Exhibition in Madrid, then first prize at the Chicago International Exhibition, where it was acquired and subsequently donated to the Washington University Museum in St. Louis, Missouri. He soon rose to general fame and became the acknowledged head of the modern Spanish school of painting. His picture The Return from Fishing (1894) was much admired at the Paris Salon and was acquired by the state for the Mus√©e du Luxembourg. It indicated the direction of his mature output.\\"The Return from Fishing is a key painting in Sorolla's development. It is his first large Valencian beach scene and his first large painting of a natural subject‚Äîone might almost say that it was his first Sorolla.\\" (Peel, p. 215.) Sorolla painted two masterpieces in 1897 linking art and science: Portrait of Dr. Simarro at the microscope and A Research. These paintings were presented at the National Exhibition of Fine Arts held in Madrid in that year and Sorolla won the Prize of Honor. Here, he presents his friend Simarro as a man of science who transmits his wisdom investigating and, in addition, it is the triumph of naturalism, as it recreates the indoor environment of the laboratory, catching the luminous atmosphere produced by the artificial reddish-yellow light of a gas burner that contrasts with the weak mauvish afternoon light that shines through the window. These paintings may be among the most outstanding world paintings of this genre.Campos Bueno, JJ, (2010) Art and Science in Sorolla‚Äôs Painting A Research in Dr. Simarro‚Äôs Lab. Psychologia Latina, 1, 9‚Äì26 Sad Inheritance Sad Inheritance, 1899. Crippled children bathing at the sea in Valencia; in the center the image of two children affected by polio (Bancaja Collection). An even greater turning point in Sorolla's career was marked by the painting and exhibition of Sad Inheritance (1899, seen at right), an extremely large canvas, highly finished for public consideration. The subject was a depiction of crippled children bathing at the sea in Valencia, under the supervision of a monk. They are the victims of hereditary syphilis the title implies, perhaps.The Guardian 14 March 2019 Campos has suggested that the polio epidemic that struck the land of Valencia some years earlier is present, possibly for the first time in the history of painting, through the image of two affected children.Campos Bueno, JJ, (2010) The painting earned Sorolla his greatest official recognition, the Grand Prix and a medal of honor at the Universal Exhibition in Paris in 1900, and the medal of honor at the National Exhibition in Madrid in 1901. A series of preparatory oil sketches for Sad Inheritance were painted with the greatest luminosity and bravura, and foretold an increasing interest in shimmering light and of a medium deftly handled.Peel, p. 217. Sorolla thought well enough of these sketches that he presented two of them as gifts to American artists; one to John Singer Sargent, the other to William Merritt Chase.Peel, pp. 217‚Äì218. After this painting Sorolla never returned to a theme of such overt social consciousness. Maturity My Wife and Daughters in the Garden or \\"Mi Esposa e Hijas en el Jard√≠n\\" which is the original name, 1910. The exhibit at the Paris Universal Exposition of 1900 won him a medal of honour and his nomination as Knight of the Legion of Honour; within the next few years Sorolla was honoured as a member of the Fine Art Academies of Paris, Lisbon, and Valencia, and as a Favourite Son of Valencia. A special exhibition of his works‚Äîfigure subjects, landscapes and portraits‚Äîat the Galeries Georges Petit in Paris in 1906 eclipsed all his earlier successes and led to his appointment as Officer of the Legion of Honour. The show included nearly 500 works, early paintings as well as recent sun-drenched beach scenes, landscapes, and portraits, a productivity which amazed critics and was a financial triumph.F.P. Sorolla, p. 22. Though subsequent large-scale exhibitions in Germany and London were greeted with more restraint, while in England in 1908 Sorolla met Archer Milton Huntington, who made him a member of The Hispanic Society of America in New York City, and invited him to exhibit there in 1909. The exhibition comprised 356 paintings, 195 of which sold. Sorolla spent five months in America and painted more than twenty portraits.Peel, pp. 246‚Äì247. Sorolla's work is often exhibited together with that of his contemporaries and friends, John Singer Sargent and Anders Zorn. Portraits American President William Howard Taft, 1909 Although formal portraiture was not Sorolla's genre of preference, because it tended to restrict his creative appetites and could reflect his lack of interest in his subjects,\\"I do not care to paint portraits indoors [...] I cannot feel sympathetic.\\" (Joaqu√≠n Sorolla, quoted in Evening Post, 5 February 1909.) the acceptance of portrait commissions proved profitable, and the portrayal of his family was irresistible. Sometimes the influence of Vel√°zquez was uppermost, as in My Family (1901), a reference to Las Meninas which grouped his wife and children in the foreground, the painter reflected, at work, in a distant mirror.Peel, p. 221. At other times the desire to compete with his friend John Singer Sargent was evident, as in Portrait of Mrs. Ira Nelson Morris and her children (1911).The impact may have been reciprocal: \\"[...] that Sorolla was influenced by Sargent in his portraiture seems apparent [...] It certainly appears that Sargent's landscape painting after 1906 was strongly influenced by Sorolla.\\" (Peel, p. 15.) A series of portraits produced in the United States in 1909, commissioned through the Hispanic Society of America, was capped by the Portrait of Mr. Taft, President of the United States,File:Joaquin Sorolla Portrait of President Taft.jpg ‚Äì Wikimedia Commons at commons.wikimedia.org. This portrait, which was painted at the White House, is on permanent display at the Taft Museum of Art in Cincinnati, Ohio.Peel, p. 230. Portrait of Dr Simarro at the microscope, 1897, (Luis Simarro Legacy Trust, Fundaci√≥n General, Complutense University) The appearance of sunlight could be counted on to rouse his interest, and it was outdoors where he found his ideal portrait settings.Peel, pp. 63, 232. Thus, not only did his daughter pose standing in a sun-dappled landscape for Mar√≠a at La Granja (1907), but so did Spanish royalty, for the Portrait of King Alfonso XIII in a Hussar's Uniform (1907).File:Joaquin Sorolla Retrato Del Rey Don Alfonso XIII con el Uniforme De Husares.jpg ‚Äì Wikimedia Commons at commons.wikimedia.org For Portrait of Mr. Louis Comfort Tiffany (1911),The portrait of Louis Tiffany is on permanent display at the Hispanic Society of America in Manhattan. the American artist posed seated at his easel in his Long Island garden, surrounded by extravagant flowers. The conceit reaches its high point in My Wife and Daughters in the Garden (1910, see gallery below), in which the idea of traditional portraiture gives way to the sheer fluid delight of a painting constructed with thick passages of color, Sorolla's love of family and sunlight merged. The Provinces of Spain Early in 1911, Sorolla visited the United States for a second time, and exhibited 152 new paintings at the Saint Louis Art Museum and 161 at the Art Institute of Chicago a few weeks later.Peel, p. 247. Later that year Sorolla met Archie Huntington in Paris and signed a contract to paint a series of oils on life in Spain. These 14 magnificent murals, installed to this day in the Hispanic Society of America building in Manhattan, range from 12 to 14 feet in height, and total 227 feet in length. The major commission of his career, it would dominate the later years of Sorolla's life. Huntington had envisioned the work depicting a history of Spain, but the painter preferred the less specific Vision of Spain, eventually opting for a representation of the regions of the Iberian Peninsula, and calling it The Provinces of Spain.Muller, Priscilla: \\"Sorolla and America\\", The Painter Joaquin Sorolla, p. 65. Despite the immensity of the canvases, Sorolla painted all but one en plein air, and travelled to the specific locales to paint them: Navarre, Aragon, Catalonia, Valencia, Elche, Seville, Andalusia, Extremadura, Galicia, Guipuzcoa, Castile, Leon, and Ayamonte, at each site painting models posed in local costume. Each mural celebrated the landscape and culture of its region, panoramas composed of throngs of laborers and locals. By 1917 he was, by his own admission, exhausted.Muller, p. 67. He completed the final panel by July 1919.\\"Yesterday afternoon I was able to do quite a lot of work on the picture, so that I hope to finish it today, the feast of St. Peter. That will be the end of more than six years' work, of suffering and struggle, with so much that was good and bad, especially at this stage\\". (F.P. Sorolla, p. 29.) Sorolla suffered a stroke in 1920, while painting a portrait in his garden in Madrid. Paralysed for over three years, he died on 10 August 1923. He is buried in the Cementeri de Valencia, Spain. The Sorolla Room, housing the Provinces of Spain at the Hispanic Society of America, opened to the public in 1926.Felipe Gar√≠n and Facundo Tom√°s Visi√≥n de Espa√±a.

The Sorolla Room reopened in 2010, with the murals on permanent display. Legacy Sorolla's influence on some other Spanish painters, such as Alberto Pla y Rubio and Julio Romero de Torres, was so noted that they are described as \\"sorollista.\\" After his death, Sorolla's widow, Clotilde Garc√≠a del Castillo, left many of his paintings to the Spanish public. The paintings eventually formed the collection that is now known as the Museo Sorolla, which was the artist's house in Madrid. The museum opened in 1932. Sorolla's work is represented in museums throughout Spain, Europe, America, and in many private collections in Europe and America. In 1933, J. Paul Getty purchased ten Impressionist beach scenes made by Sorolla, several of which are now housed in the J. Paul Getty Museum.J. Paul Getty Museum. Joaqu√≠n Sorolla y Bastida. Retrieved 6 September 2008. In 1960, Sorolla, el pintor de la luz, a short documentary written and directed by Manuel Dom√≠nguez was presented at the Cannes Film Festival. The Spanish National Dance Company honored the painter's The Provinces of Spain by producing a ballet Sorolla based on the paintings. Valencia high-speed railway station has been named after Sorolla. Temporary exhibitions In 2007 many of his works were exhibited at the Petit Palais in Paris, alongside those of John Singer Sargent, a contemporary who painted in a similarly impressionist-influenced manner. In 2009, there was a special exhibition of his works at the Prado in Madrid, and in 2010, the exhibition visited the Oscar Niemeyer Museum in Curitiba, Brazil. From 5 December 2011 to 10 March 2012, several of Sorolla's works were exhibited in Queen Sof√≠a Spanish Institute, in New York. This exhibition included pieces used during Sorolla's eight-year research for Vision of Spain. An exhibition titled Sorolla & America explored Sorolla's unique relationship with the United States in the early twentieth century.

The pass is located on the continental divide, at the crest of the Front Range along the border between Park (south) and Summit counties. Description The pass crosses the range where it divides the headwaters of the Blue River (a tributary of the Colorado River) to the north with South Park and the headwaters of the South Platte River to the south. It is traversed by Forest Service Road 33, a gravel road that is closed in winter but passable by two-wheel drive automobiles in good weather. In winter, the road is used by cross-country skiers. The road over the pass goes north from the town of Como in the northern South Park northeast of Fairplay, crossing the path northward to Breckenridge. In good weather, it furnishes an alternative route to nearby Hoosier Pass, offering splendid views of aspen trees and nearby Mount Silverheels and the Tenmile Range. The round trip up to the top from Breckenridge is popular with bicyclists.http://trails.mtbr.com/cat/united-states-trails/trails- colorado/front-range/trail/boreas-pass-summit-county/prd_340590_5844crx.aspx Retrieved 2011-06-13. Cross-country skiers traveling the old Boreas Pass railroad grade pass the restored Bakers water tank The pass was formerly known as Breckenridge Pass in the 1860s, when it served as an early route for thousands of prospectors during the Colorado Gold Rush who crossed from South Park to look for gold in the valley of the Blue around Breckenridge. In 1866, it was widened to a wagon road that accommodated stagecoaches. In 1882, under the direction of Sidney Dillon of the Union Pacific Railroad, the Denver, South Park and Pacific Railroad (by then controlled by the Union Pacific) begun laying narrow gauge tracks up the pass, which Dillon renamed in honor of Boreas, the Ancient Greek god of the North Wind. The line was a spur to Breckenridge (eventually extended to Leadville) off the company's main line from Denver through South Park. A roundhouse, still in existence, was constructed at Como at the junction of the lines. The rail line over the pass was a major engineering feat, primarily because of the winter snows at high altitude. When completed, it had dozens of snow sheds along its route, which approached a 4% grade in many places. A town of Boreas, now a ghost town, was constructed at the summit, primarily to house workers to clear the line in winter. The line was abandoned in 1937 by the Colorado & Southern, along with most of the company's narrow gauge right-of-way. After World War II, the Army Corps of Engineers reconstructed the route for automobile traffic. On the north side of the pass, Forest Service Road 593 leads to the 1880s ghost town site of Dyersville, as well as many abandoned mining sites. The Boreas Pass Ditch was completed in 1910 to divert water over the pass from the headwaters of Indiana Creek, a tributary of the Blue River into North Tarryall Creek, a tributary of the South Platte River. The 0.8 mile (1.3 km) ditch has a capacity of 16 cubic feet per second (0.45m3/s), and in an average year, it transports about 140 acre-feet (170,000m3) of water. The ditch was originally built to irrigate land in South Park, but it currently serves the city of Englewood, which rehabilitated the ditch In 1990. The Boreas Railroad Station Site is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

It was commercialized in the TT1 and TTx chip sets designed by Abrizio and sold by PMC-Sierra.  Context  A crossbar is the central portion of a crossbar switch fabric which connects the inputs to the outputs. A set of decisions of which inputs are connected to which outputs must be made each arbitration period. In high speed cell switching or packet switching applications, the arbitration period is very short. There are often millions or billions of arbitration periods per second. An arbiter is the circuit that makes the decision as to which of the crossbar's many switches should be closed. Speed is a key design criterion of an arbiter in some applications.  Algorithm description  A wavefront arbiter is a particular type of arbiter that is optimized for high-speed operation. For a unicast switch, the algorithm is as follows: # The decision starts at a single point in the x-y matrix which represents the physical switches, for example the upper left hand corner. # Based on the requests, a decision is made whether to close that switch, connecting the corresponding input and output. # The result of this decision is then fed to the right along the matrix axis representing the input, and down along the matrix axis representing the output. # The results of the first computation then enable the next computation at the point to the right and at the point below and switch closing decision is made at each of those two points. # The results of these subsequent two calculations then are then fed to the points below and to the right of them. These results then enable the decisions at the next three points which are to the right and below. # These results are again fed to the right and below. # In the case where the calculation did not start in the upper left hand corner, the results wrap around the right back to the first left column and around the bottom to the top row. # The calculation continues until all of the decisions have been made.  Benefit of use  The benefits of this type of calculation include: * Speed ‚Äì the algorithm can be implemented in a combinatorial manner (without hardware registers), allowing the wavefront to propagate across much or all of the matrix in one or a few clock periods. * Regularity ‚Äì the nodes of the physical structure used to compute this are all identical. This is often called a systolic computation. Regular structures can sometimes lead to compact semiconductor implementations.  Variants  There are numerous variants of this method including: * Randomizing or shuffling the order in which the rows and columns are considered. Some sort of shuffling is generally necessary to achieve fairness. * Multicast variants of this method where one input can be connected to multiple outputs in either one or multiple passes.

Southwestern College is a private Methodist college in Winfield, Kansas. It was founded in 1885 as Southwest Kansas Conference College and graduated its first class of three in June 1889. The name of the school was changed to its current form in 1909. History=Background The first step towards the establishment of Southwest Kansas Conference College took place in the spring of 1884 when land was platted for the purpose east of Wichita, Kansas.\\"Southwest Kansas College,\\" Wichita Daily Eagle, vol. 1, no. 122 (Oct. 4, 1884), pg. 4. With construction slated for the future, in October of that same year the principals behind the project decided to acquire a substantial residence to serve as a temporary building for the school. The Wichita home of a certain Dr. Crokey, located on the corner of Central and Topeka Avenues, was obtained for this purpose at a cost of $4,000. Initial plans called for establishment of a school with academic departments in the fields of business, music, and art. A 1901 newspaper advertisement for Southwest Kansas Conference College touting the school's \\"Christian influence.\\" The school was incorporated in Topeka on October 9, 1884, headed by a nine-member board of directors.\\"State House,\\" Topeka Daily Capital, vol. 6, no. 247 (Oct. 10, 1884), pg. 8. No courses were conducted during the 1884-85 school year, however, and the project remained dormant. The Southwest Kansas Conference of the Methodist Church affirmed its connection with the college project at its April 1885 annual meeting at El Dorado. There the regional division of the church formally decided to establish a college within the district, selecting a committee of 7 headed by Rev. N.S. Buckner to find a suitable permanent location.\\"Letter to the Great Bend Inland Tribune from James Clayton, April 10, 1885,\\" Inland Tribune, vol. 9, no. 36 (April 10, 1885), pg. 4. Conditions established by the committee included the availability of at least 20 acres of land and community donations of at least $15,000 towards completion of the project. The committee's decision on siting was initially slated for a meeting to be held in Wichita on May 12, 1885. This proved to be a preliminary gathering, however, at which guidelines for bids were established and interested communities made their initial presentations.\\"The M.E. College,\\" Wichita Daily Beacon, vol. 2, no. 39 (May 13, 1883), pg. 4. Communities making initial appeals for the siting of the college included El Dorado, Harper, Newton, Peabody, Winfield, and Wichita. The towns of Hutchinson and Wellington also later made proposals.\\"Location of an M.E. College,\\" Topeka Daily Commonwealth, (June 11, 1885), pg. 1. A tour of visitation by Buckner's siting committee was planned. Formal decision was rendered at a meeting held in Wichita on June 9, 1885, at which the bid of Winfield was accepted. Winfield in its winning bid pledged $40,000 towards college construction, 20 acres of land for the campus, additional payments of $2,000 a year for ten years, and an additional 40 acres of land.\\"The M.E. College,\\" Fort Scott Weekly Monitor, vol. 2, no. 11 (June 18, 1885), pg. 7. The selection of Winfield was met the next day with Cowley County approving the issuance of $100,000 in bonds on behalf of the Denver, Memphis & Atlantic Railway for the expeditious construction of a new railway line to the town. Construction of the main college building began in the fall of 1885 upon a plan designed by W.A. Ritchie, with the 4-story building anticipated to be ready for occupancy September 1, 1886, in time for the 1886‚Äì87 academic year.\\"Our Improvements,\\" Winfield Tribune, vol. 1, no. 41 (Sept. 2, 1885), pg. 5. Dormitory cottages were also to be built. Total cost of construction was projected at $60,000. Upon completion the building was touted in the local press as \\"one of the finest buildings in the state.\\"W.C. Barnes, Editorial in the Winfield Tribune, June 16, 1886, pg. 5. Launch In April 1886, Dr. John E. Earp, formerly head of Indiana Asbury University, a Methodist-affiliated college in Greencastle, Indiana, was tapped by the board of trustees as the first President of the Southwest Kansas Conference College.\\"Local Miscellany,\\" Newton Daily Republican, vol. 2, whole no. 425 (April 23, 1886), pg. 1. Southwest Kansas Conference College graduated its first class of 3 students on June 3, 1889.\\"Southwestern College: History,\\" www.sckans.edu/ Name change In 1909 the name of Southwest Kansas Conference College was changed to Southwestern College. Southwestern College today=Academics The main campus is a laptop learning community, with laptop computers provided to all incoming students. An emphasis on service learning has led to nationally recognized programs in leadership, discipleship, and sustainability (green issues). In addition to bachelor's degrees, several master's programs give undergraduate students the option of completing a graduate degree. Its doctoral degree in education started during the summer of 2012. Southwestern College's professional studies programs focus on degree completion for working adults. Six professional studies sites in three states allow students to earn their bachelor's degrees and selected master's programs in either a traditional classroom setting or online. The ground locations are in Wichita, McConnell AFB, Fort Riley, Kansas and Midwest City, Oklahoma. The school owns and operates radio station KSWC-LP. Accreditation Southwestern College is accredited by The Higher Learning Commission and is a member of the North Central Association.The Higher Learning Commission Southwestern College (listing) It is further accredited by the University Senate of the United Methodist Church and other accrediting bodies for individual majors.  Athletics  Southwestern College teams are nicknamed as the Moundbuilders. The university is a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing in the Kansas Collegiate Athletic Conference (KCAC). Men's sports include basketball, cross country, football, golf, soccer, tennis and track & field; while women's sports include basketball, cheerleading, cross country, dance, golf, soccer, softball, tennis, track & field and volleyball. The Men's Track Team has won 30 consecutive conference championships, while the women have won 16 straight. Men's Cross Country has won 30 consecutive conference championships, while the women have won 4 straight and 11 of the last 14, with the school garnering 134 conference championships in nine different sports since 1960. The track teams are coached by Jim Helmer and Mike Kirkland. The school has had over 160 All- American scholar-athletes since 1980. Southwestern College football players have gone on to successful coaching careers, including Jerry Kill, a former head football coach at the University of Minnesota.  \\"The Mound\\"  The college's nickname, \\"Moundbuilders,\\" (frequently shortened to just \\"Builders\\") has inspired the creation of a large pile of rocks on the college campus, called \\"The Mound.\\" At the beginning of each school year, the \\"Moundbuilding Ceremony\\" allows students, faculty, clubs, and guests of Southwestern College to place a rock on the Mound. Participants are invited to decorate their rocks with paint, and some are decorated quite creatively. Although rocks are never removed from the Mound, the Mound itself was moved from the upper campus to the lower campus in the 1970s when Darbeth Fine Arts Building was built on the original site of the Mound. A major renovation in 2006 added a plaza area around the Mound with commemorative stones, benches, and landscaping. The nickname Moundbuilders originated in 1910 when students wanted to be called something other than \\"Preachers\\" or \\"Methodists.\\" Editorialists toyed with various suggestions based on the fact that Southwestern students lived on \\"the hill.\\" The name \\"Cliff-dwellers\\" was suggested but was ultimately scrapped for \\"Moundbuilders\\" after student Harry Hart wrote that \\"anybody could just dwell there, but 'builders' shows action.\\" The Moundbuilding ceremony was instituted in 1927 by Dean Leroy Allen who said, \\"Nobody but Moundbuilders can build mounds. So no other college has now, or ever is likely to have such a custom.\\"  The Order of the Mound  The Order of the Mound is the official Honor Society for Southwestern College graduates. Although the society was formally organized in 1917, membership in the Order of the Mound includes graduates from 1889 onward. In 1927, a process was established to induct qualified graduates from years prior to 1917. Currently, to qualify for induction, students must be in the top 10% of all graduates who have completed at least 60 graded hours or more at Southwestern College.

This view holds \\"that AD 30 to 70 represented the millennial reign of Christ, and that this Last Days period transformed all things and ushered in the covenental kingdom\\" p306 King pioneered a field of theology that he termed \\"covenant eschatology.\\" Within fundamentalist and conservative Evangelical contexts, he contended that Biblical eschatology was not related to the end of the space- time universe, but to the transition of the Old Covenant to the New Covenant. King offered a unique interpretation concerning the millennium as found in Revelation 20 as pertaining to the forty-year period from 30-70 AD. He called this time \\"the transition period\\" from Old Covenant to New Covenant. In King's view, this transition opened the way for the full presence of God to dwell with all of humanity. To describe this relationship, King coined the phrase \\"Comprehensive Grace.\\" King's transmillennialism emerged in the late 1990s as an alternative to dispensational premillennialism, amillennialism or postmillennialism. It differentiated itself from Reformed preterism and Christian reconstructionism in view of postmodern issues facing the emerging church and the need to forward its scholarship in the context of historical Jesus studies. In King's view, the covenantal transformation of the first century serves as a model for personal, organizational and societal transformation today. King's first major book, The Spirit of Prophecy, was published in 1971. He published a monthly print journal, The Living Presence, for 15 years; it is currently available in electronic format. King's annual \\"Covenant Eschatology Seminar\\" spanned the 1990s and continued through the early 2000s as the \\"Transmillennial\\" national conference. Some of King's other major works include Old Covenant Israel and New Covenant Salvation and The Cross and The Parousia of Christ. His work has now attracted the attention of Spiral Dynamics practitioners like Don Edward Beck, interspiritual pioneers like Kurt Johnson, and Integral theorists like Ken Wilber. Max's final manuscript, a study of Romans 9-11 that purports to do for realized soteriology what his previous works did for realized eschatology, is due in late 2017.

History The Fabulous Freebirds started performing together in 1979 when Mid South Wrestling promoter Bill Watts put together the duo of Michael \\"P.S.\\" Hayes and Terry \\"Bam Bam\\" Gordy. Though originally meant to be a tag team, he soon added Buddy \\"Jack\\" Roberts into the mix, and they became a \\"three man gang\\" type of tag-team‚Äîan unusual concept at the time. They invented a concept that is now called The Freebird Rule in their honor, in which any two of three members can defend the team's championships. They usually worked as heels but also had several face runs as well. After wrestling for Watts in Mid South, they worked for Memphis based Continental Wrestling Association (CWA) where they feuded with Jerry Lawler and Bill Dundee. The group next wrestled in the Dallas-based World Class Championship Wrestling (WCCW) territory, where they had a legendary feud with the Von Erichs (David, Kevin, Kerry, Chris and Mike). This feud was ignited by an infamous incident in which Terry Gordy slammed Kerry Von Erich's head in a steel cage door, inciting a riot. During this feud, as the Von Erichs would wave the flag of Texas, the Freebirds started using the flag of Georgia, which contained the Confederate battle flag, as a group symbol to counter it. They also performed in the NWA-affiliated Georgia Championship Wrestling (GCW) and World Championship Wrestling (WCW), the American Wrestling Association (AWA), and the Oklahoma-based Universal Wrestling Federation (UWF). While in the AWA they feuded primarily with The Road Warriors, costing them the World Tag Team Titles in a match against long time Freebird ally Jimmy Garvin and his partner Steve Regal. They had a very brief run in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in 1984, where they were a part of the Rock 'n' Wrestling Connection period. In the WWF, they wrestled under the guidance of Cyndi Lauper's manager David Wolff, but soon left the promotion after an altercation with Andr√© the Giant, who was upset when the Freebirds arrived late to a show. The group then moved on to their AWA run, returned to World Class, and then started a stint in the UWF where Gordy became the promotion's champion, Roberts held its TV title, and Hayes usually acted as their manager or served as a heel commentator on television broadcasts. After JCP purchased UWF in 1987, Hayes wrestled in World Class and several independent promotions, sometimes with Gordy, who began spending most of his time in Japan, and Roberts began to wind down his career. Hayes and Garvin were paired as the Freebirds in WCW in 1989, enjoying several reigns as World and United States tag-team champions, and were joined by Gordy for a while as well. They later employed the services of masked third partner Brad Armstrong (under the name Badstreet) and managers Diamond Dallas Page, Big Daddy Dink, Little Richard Marley and Precious (Garvin's real-life wife and longtime valet). The Freebirds were last together when Hayes, Gordy, and Garvin worked for the Global Wrestling Federation (GWF) in 1994,New Wave Wrestling, February 1995 issue, number 15, p.42. ending the group after 15 years. In 1999, Gordy and Hayes reunited as they fought Glen Kulka and JR Smooth to a no contest for Power Pro Wrestling on May 28, 1999.https://www.cagematch.net/?id=2&nr;=539&page;=4&year;=1999&promotion;=1010 On January 21, 2000 Gordy and Hayes wrestled for Oklahoma Pro Wrestling when the lost to The Hardy Boyz. Gordy died of a heart attack, caused by a blood clot on July 16, 2001, at age 40 while Roberts died on November 29, 2012, at the age of 67, of pneumonia and on November 1, 2012, Armstrong died of a suspected heart attack making Hayes and Garvin the only living members of the Freebirds.Jim Ross comments on Roberts' death Hayes (who retired from in-ring competition shortly after the Freebirds disbanded) is currently the head of the road agents/producers within WWE, while Garvin retired from wrestling shortly after disbanding and has become an Airline Transport Pilot. On April 2, 2016, The Fabulous Freebirds (excluding Brad Armstrong) were inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame by The New Day. Entrance music The Freebirds concept was heavily derived from the Lynyrd Skynyrd song \\"Free Bird\\" and the image of \\"Southern pride\\" evoked by the band. For most of the team's early existence, the song was used as their entrance music, in both television and live appearances. On occasion, they would also enter the ring to Willie Nelson's rendition of \\"Georgia on My Mind\\". The Freebirds are sometimes credited as the first wrestlers to use entrance music for their ring introductions, although others including Gorgeous George's use of \\"Pomp and Circumstance,\\" Big Daddy's use of \\"We Shall Not Be Moved\\" and Kendo Nagasaki's use of \\"Kendo's Theme\\" all predate the Freebirds. During the mid 1980s, a number of North American wrestling promotions who licensed copyrighted music faced difficulties in continuing those licenses. Other promotions which did not license music were under scrutiny for the practice. Promotions began looking for solutions. The WWF, which hired Jimmy Hart and Jim Johnston in 1985, used their talents to write and produce music under which the copyrights could be controlled by the company. Around this same time, Hayes recorded the song \\"Badstreet USA\\" and released a music video, which included the other Freebird members, as well as a cameo by a young Jim Ross. This song would largely be used as the entrance music for the Freebirds from that point forward, though they would use the other songs on occasion. Freebird Rule During the Freebirds' career in the NWA, they won several of its regional tag team championships. While holding the title, promoters added a sub-gimmick to the team ‚Äì \\"The Freebird Rule\\" ‚Äì which allowed any two of the three members of the team to defend the title on any given night. This rule has been re-used by a number of other companies when a three (or more) man team captures a tag team championship. Examples include: *The Midnight Express: Dennis Condrey, Randy Rose, and Norvell Austin (Southeastern Championship Wrestling, 1980‚Äì1983) *The Russians: Ivan Koloff, Nikita Koloff, and Krusher Khruschev (JCP, 1985‚Äì1986) *Demolition: Ax, Smash, and Crush (WWF, 1990) *The Heavenly Bodies: Stan Lane, Tom Prichard, and Bobby Eaton (SMW, 1993)Wrestling 93: Rulebreaker, Spring 1993 issue, p.10.Wrestle America, June 1993 issue, p.60. *The Wolfpac: Kevin Nash, Scott Hall, and Syxx (WCW, 1997) *The Flock: Raven, Perry Saturn, and Chris Kanyon (WCW, 1999) *The Jersey Triad: Diamond Dallas Page, Bam Bam Bigelow, and Chris Kanyon (WCW, 1999) (Unlike other uses, the Jersey Triad was allowed to switch between the three members during a match, as long as one member was on the floor) *Triple X: Elix Skipper, Low Ki, and Christopher Daniels (TNA, 2003) *3 Live Kru: Konnan, B.G. James, and Ron Killings (TNA, 2003‚Äì2004) *Chri$ Ca$h, SeXXXy Eddy, Nate Webb and J.C. Bailey (Combat Zone Wrestling, 2004‚Äì2005) *The Spirit Squad: Kenny, Johnny, Mitch, Nicky, and Mikey (WWE, 2006) *The Dudebusters: Trent Barreta, Caylen Croft and Curt Hawkins (Florida Championship Wrestling, 2009‚Äì2010) *The Beautiful People: Lacey Von Erich, Velvet Sky, and Madison Rayne (TNA, 2010) *The Band: Kevin Nash, Scott Hall, and Eric Young (TNA, 2010) *The McGraws: Masky, Mini and Uncle Ulysses (Power League Wrestling 2010) *The Family: Jessie Godderz, Rob Terry, Mohamad Ali Vaez and Rudy Switchblade (OVW, 2012) *The New Day: Big E, Kofi Kingston, and Xavier Woods (WWE, 2015‚Äì2016 (Raw); 2017‚Äì2020 (SmackDown)) *Cerberus: Ilja Dragunov, Julian Nero and Robert Dreissker/Dirty Dragan (wXw, 2015‚Äì2016) (Robert Dreissker was replaced by Dirty Dragan on April 22, 2016 due to a shoulder injury)wXw World Tag Team Championship *The Wyatt Family: Bray Wyatt, Randy Orton and Luke Harper (WWE (SmackDown), 2016) *Sanity: Alexander Wolfe, Eric Young, and Killian Dain (NXT, 2017) *The Undisputed Era: Bobby Fish, Kyle O'Reilly, Roderick Strong and Adam Cole (NXT, 2017‚Äì2018) *The Dynasty: Maxwell Jacob Friedman, Richard Holliday and Alexander Hammerstone (MLW, 2019‚ÄìPresent) In some cases, the Freebird rule has been applied to singles titles, most notably when Chyna and Chris Jericho co-held the WWF Intercontinental Championship in 2000. Other such cases included when 3 Count won the WCW Hardcore Championship in 2000, and when Matt Bentley and Frankie Kazarian co- held the TNA X Division Championship in 2004. In 2010, after Layla won the WWE Women's Championship, Team LayCool (Layla and Michelle McCool) co-held the title. This was a slight variation to the Freebird rule, as while both women defended the title, only Layla was recognized as the official champion. Later that year, the same rule was instituted when Michelle McCool won the WWE Divas Championship; both members of Team LayCool defended the title, but only McCool was recognized as official champion. A similar situation happened in Ring of Honor (ROH) in 2017, where Bullet Club invoked \\"Bullet Club Rules\\", which allowed Cody, Kenny Omega and Marty Scurll to defend the ROH World Six-Man Tag Team Championship. However, only the title's original winners, Adam Page, Matt Jackson and Nick Jackson, were recognized as official champions. Offshoots=Blackbirds The Blackbirds were formed in 1988 in World Class Championship Wrestling by Iceman Parsons. He had just teamed with Terry Gordy and Buddy Roberts as the \\"Blackbirds\\" in their feud with Michael Hayes. He teamed up with Perry \\"Action\\" Jackson and Harold T. Harris to form the Blackbirds. They also wrestled as the Blackbirds in the Global Wrestling Federation in 1992. Extreme Freebirds The Extreme Freebirds were formed in NWA Wildside and the NAWA by the son of Terry Gordy, Ray Gordy. He teamed up with Tank and Iceberg in 2004 to form this group. Other appearances The original three Freebirds briefly appear in a match against Greg Gagne, The Tonga Kid, and Jim Brunzell during the opening sequence of the 1986 fantasy film Highlander, which occurs at a show in Madison Square Garden (although the scene was actually filmed at the Brendan Byrne Arena across the river). Members and incarnations *Main Members **Michael Hayes was the leader of the group. Nicknamed \\"P.S.\\" (Purely Sexy), he was the main talker, and was known to get the crowd going with his antics. **Terry Gordy was the powerhouse of the group. Nicknamed \\"Bam Bam\\", he loved to fight and beat his opponents down. **Buddy Roberts, nicknamed \\"Jack\\" for his love of Jack Daniel's whiskey, was the speed of the group, who would often frustrate other wrestlers into chasing him, until Hayes and/or Gordy surprised them with a move. Buddy was also acknowledged as the best ring technician of the group and the guy who would often take the high spot bumps. **Jimmy Garvin's association with the Freebirds began in 1983, as he had often teamed with Hayes, Gordy, and Roberts in WCCW and AWA. In 1988, he teamed with Steven Dane while Hayes was injured as a watered-down version of the Freebirds, and with Hayes during a reignited WCW run between June 1989 and July 1992. He was always considered the fourth Freebird by Hayes, Gordy and Roberts,Inside Wrestling, March 1988 issue, article: \\"Terry Gordy & Buddy Roberts declare: Michael Hayes and Jim Garvin are not The Freebirds!\\", p.36.The Wrestler, October 1989 issue, p.18. although no one really believed it until 1989, when Hayes and Garvin (nicknamed \\"Jam\\") teamed up for the NWA World Tag Team Championship tournament. *Associated members **During the Buddy Roberts and Terry Gordy feud against Michael Hayes: ***Iceman Parsons - in late 1987, he joined Terry Gordy and Buddy Roberts after Michael Hayes left the Fabulous Freebirds to help them get revenge on him. Parsons was known as the \\"Blackbird\\" during this feud. ***The Angel of Death teamed with Terry Gordy, Buddy Roberts and Iceman \\"King\\" Parsons in the late-1987‚Äì1988 version of the Freebirds. He had previously feuded with Gordy, Roberts and Michael Hayes in the UWF prior to joining the group. **During the Michael Hayes and Jimmy Garvin tag team era: ***Steve Cox teamed with Hayes as The Freebirds in WCCW, CWA, and AWA. When Hayes was injured, he would team with Garvin. ***Badstreet - Brad Armstrong under a mask in WCW, and the group's light-heavyweight/cruiserweight. Originally appeared as \\"Fantasia\\", but WCW changed the name to Badstreet to avoid a legal confrontation with Disney. ***Big Daddy Dink - the Freebird alias of manager Sir Oliver Humperdink; in keeping with the Freebirds' \\"frustrated rock & roll band\\" gimmick, he was referred to as their \\"tour manager\\"/\\"road boss\\" in WCW (1991). ***Little Richard Marley - WCW jobber Rocky King, who as \\"Little Richard Marley\\" served as a ringside pest to Freebird opponents in late 1990. **Later: ***Ray Gordy formed a one-night Freebirds reunion with Michael Hayes, in tribute to his father, Terry Gordy. *Managers **Big Daddy Dink **David Wolff **Diamond Dallas Page **Precious **Sunshine Championships and accomplishments *Georgia Championship Wrestling **NWA National Tag Team Championship (3 times) - Hayes and Gordy **NWA Georgia Tag Team Championship (1 time) - Hayes and Gordy *Global Wrestling Federation **GWF Tag Team Championship (1 time) - Gordy and Garvin *Mid-South Wrestling/Universal Wrestling Association **Mid-South Tag Team Championship (2 times) - Hayes and Gordy (1), Gordy and Roberts (1) **UWF Heavyweight Championship (1 time) - Gordy **UWF Television Championship (1 time) - Roberts *NWA Mid-America **NWA Mid-America Tag Team Championship (2 times) - Hayes and Gordy *Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame **Class of 2015 - Roberts, Gordy and Hayes *Pro Wrestling Illustrated **Tag Team of the Year (1981) - Michael Hayes and Terry Gordy **Ranked Michael Hayes and Terry Gordy #3 of the 100 best tag teams during the PWI Years in 2003 *World Championship Wrestling **NWA United States Heavyweight Championship (1 time) - Hayes **WCW United States Tag Team Championship (2 times) - Hayes and Garvin **WCW World Six-Man Tag Team Championship (1 time) - Hayes, Garvin and Badstreet **NWA/WCW World Tag Team Championship (2 times) - Hayes and Garvin *World Class Championship Wrestling **NWA American Heavyweight Championship (1 time) - Gordy **NWA American Tag Team Championship (1 time) - Hayes and Gordy **WCCW Six-Man Tag Team Championship (6 times) - Hayes, Gordy and Roberts (5 times) Gordy, Roberts and Parsons (1 time) **WCCW Television Championship (1 time) - Roberts **NWA Knuckles Championship (Texas version) (1 time) - Gordy **WCWA Texas Heavyweight Championship (1 time) - Parsons *Wrestling Observer Newsletter **Tag Team of the Year (1980) - Gordy and Roberts **Feud of the Year (1983) - Freebirds vs. the Von Erichs **Feud of the Year (1984) - Freebirds vs. the Von Erichs **Match of the Year (1984) - Freebirds vs. the Von Erichs (Kerry, Kevin, and Mike), Anything Goes match, July 4, Fort Worth, Texas **Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame (Class of 2005) - Hayes, Gordy, and Roberts *WWE ** WWE Hall of Fame (Class of 2016 - Hayes, Roberts, Gordy, and Garvin) See also *The Dangerous Alliance *The Diamond Exchange *The Hollywood Blonds *The Samoan SWAT Team ReferencesFurther reading * External links Category:American Wrestling Association teams and stables Category:Independent promotions teams and stables Category:Masked tag teams Category:Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum Category:World Championship Wrestling teams and stables Category:WWE Hall of Fame inductees Category:WWE Hall of Fame team inductees Category:WWE teams and stables ","title":"The Fabulous Freebirds"},{"id":"1873515","text":"Lucius Aelius Stilo Praeconinus (, ; c. 154 ‚Äì 74 BC), of Lanuvium, was the earliest known philologist of the Roman Republic. He came from a distinguished family and belonged to the equestrian order. He was called Stilo (from Latin , \\"pen for writing on wax\\") because he wrote speeches for others, and Praeconinus from his father's profession (, \\"announcer, public crier, herald\\"). His aristocratic sympathies were so strong that he voluntarily accompanied Caecilius Metellus Numidicus into exile. At Rome he divided his time between teaching (although not as a professional schoolmaster) and literary work. His most famous pupils were Varro and Cicero, and amongst his friends was Coelius Antipater, the historian. According to Cicero, who expressed a poor opinion of his powers as an orator, Stilo was a follower of the Stoic school. Only a few fragments of his works remain. He wrote commentaries on the hymns of the Salii (Carmen Saliare), and probably also on the Twelve Tables. He analysed the authenticity of comedies supposedly by Plautus, and recognized 25 as canonical, four more than were allowed by Varro. It is probable that he was the author of a general glossographical work, dealing with literary, historical and antiquarian questions. The rhetorical treatise Ad Herennium was attributed to him by some scholars of the early 20th century.

In contrast to a hysterectomy, the uterus remains preserved and the woman retains her reproductive potential. Indications The presence of a fibroid does not mean that it needs to be removed. Removal is necessary when the fibroid causes pain or pressure, abnormal bleeding, or interferes with reproduction. The fibroids needed to be removed are typically large in size, or growing at certain locations such as bulging into the endometrial cavity causing significant cavity distortion. Treatment options for uterine fibroids include observation or medical therapy, such a GnRH agonist, hysterectomy, uterine artery embolization, and high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation. Procedure A myomectomy can be performed in a number of ways, depending on the location, size and number of lesions and the experience and preference of the surgeon. Either a general or a spinal anesthesia is administered. Laparotomy Traditionally a myomectomy is performed via a laparotomy with a full abdominal incision, either vertically or horizontally. Once the peritoneal cavity is opened, the uterus is incised, and the lesion(s) removed. The open approach is often preferred for larger lesions. One or more incisions may be set into the uterine muscle and are repaired once the fibroid has been removed. Recovery after surgery takes six to eight weeks. Laparoscopy Using the laparoscopic approach the uterus is visualized and its fibroids located and removed. Studies have suggested that laparoscopic myomectomy leads to lower morbidity rates and faster recovery than does laparotomic myomectomy. As with hysteroscopic myomectomy, laparoscopic myomectomy is not generally used on very large fibroids. A study of laparoscopic myomectomies conducted between January 1990 and October 1998 examined 106 cases of laparoscopic myomectomy, in which the fibroids were intramural or subserous and ranged in size from 3 to 10 cm. Hysteroscopy A fibroid that is located in a submucous position (that is, protruding into the endometrial cavity) may be accessible to hysteroscopic removal. This may apply primarily to smaller lesions as pointed out by a large study that collected results from 235 patients suffering from submucous myomas who were treated with hysteroscopic myomectomies; in none of these cases was the fibroid greater than 5 cm. However, larger lesions have also been treated by hysteroscopy. Recovery after hysteroscopic surgery is but a few days. Complications and risks Complications of the surgery include the possibility of significant blood loss leading to a blood transfusion, the risk of adhesion or scar formation around the uterus or within its cavity, and the possible need later to deliver via cesarean section.American Society of Reproductive Medicine Patient Booklet: Uterine Fibroids, 2003 It may not be possible to remove all lesions, nor will the operation prevent new lesions from growing. Development of new fibroids will be seen in 42-55% of patients undergoing a myomectomy. It is well known that myomectomy surgery is associated with a higher risk of uterine rupture in later pregnancy. Thus, women who have had myomectomy (with the exception of small submucosal myoma removal via hysteroscopy, or largely pedunculated myoma removal) should get Cesarean delivery to avoid the risk of uterine rupture that is commonly fatal to the fetus. To reduce bleeding during myomectomy, the use of misoprostol in the vagina and the injection of vasopressin into the uterine muscle are both effective. There is less evidence supporting the usefulness chemical dissection (such as with mesna), vaginal insertion of dinoprostone, a gelatin-thrombin matrix, tranexamic acid, infusion of vitamin C, infiltration of a mixture of bupivacaine and epinephrine into the uterine muscles, or the use of a fibrin sealant patch. Myomectomy during pregnancy Leiomyomata tend to grow during pregnancy but only the large ones causing endometrial cavity distortion could interfere with the growing pregnancy directly. Generally, surgeons tend to stay away from operative interventions during the pregnancy because of the risk of haemorrhage and the concern that the pregnancy may be interrupted. Also, after a pregnancy, myomas tend to shrink naturally. However, in selected cases myomectomy may become necessary during pregnancy, or also at the time of a caesarean section to gain access to the baby.

Born of a bourgeois family, Ary dos Santos soon developed several skills for poetry. At only 14, the family published some poems, against his will - (he thought the poems were not good enough). In 1954, at the age of 16, Ary saw some of his poems being selected for the Anthology of the Almeida Garrett prize. After that, Ary fell out with his father and left his family home, working on several jobs, like errand boy, bubblegum and machines seller, tutor, docker, clerk and finally publicist. His poetic work continued to develop and in 1963 he published his first book, A Liturgia do Sangue [Liturgy of Blood]. 1969 was the year that changed Ary's life, as he liked to say. He became a member of the Portuguese Communist Party and quickly developed his revolutionary vein. Ary dos Santos established himself as one of the best known poets of his time by virtue of his song- writing. Having a profound impact in the late 20-th century Portuguese music, Ary dos Santos authored more than 600 hundred lyrics, voiced by the most respected Portuguese singers such as Amalia Rodrigues, Simone de Oliveira, Carlos do Carmo, Paulo de Carvalho and Fernando Tordo. Ary participated, under a pseudonym, in the 1969's RTP Song Contest, writing the lyrics of the winning song: A Desfolhada, performed by Simone de Oliveira. During his career, Ary also wrote several revolutionary poems, for political intervention, about the Estado Novo regime's anti-democratic policies, the need for freedom and celebrating the post-revolutionary conquests, which led him to be called the poet of the revolution. Ary dos Santos died at age 46 from cirrhosis.

The town is in the valley of the River Leach in the Cotswolds, about northeast of Cirencester and east-southeast of Cheltenham. The 2011 Census recorded the parish's population as 1,854. Manor Northleach seems to have existed by about AD 780, when one Ethelmund son of Ingold granted 35 tributarii of land to Gloucester Abbey. The abbey later granted estates including Northleach to Ealdred, Bishop of Worcester, probably in about 1058 when he had the abbey church rebuilt. In 1060, Ealdred was translated to York, taking the lordship of Northleach with him. The Domesday Book of 1086 assessed the manor of Northleach at 37 hides. In 1095 a later Archbishop of York, Thomas of Bayeux, restored manors including Northleach to Gloucester Abbey. His successors disputed this until 1157, when the claim was finally settled in the abbey's favour. In 1539 Parliament passed the Suppression of Religious Houses Act, and in 1540 Gloucester Abbey was suppressed and surrendered its estates to the Crown. Northleach became a Royal manor and remained so until 1611, when James I sold it to George and Thomas Whitmore. By 1641 it had passed to their brother Sir Thomas Whitmore, 1st Baronet, of Apley, Shropshire. Sir Thomas was a Royalist, so in 1645 in the English Civil War the Parliamentarians sequestered his estates, but Northleach was given such a low valuation that he was allowed to keep it. Northleach stayed in his family until 1753, when William Whitmore sold it to James Lennox Dutton, who had inherited a number of houses in the town from his father. In 1771 his son John Lenox Dutton left Northleach to Rev. Richard Rice, Rector of Quenington. It then descended via Rice's son and was divided between his three granddaughters. Jevon Harper, husband of one of the three sisters, eventually obtained all three shares in the manor. By 1863 the manor had passed to Rev. Richard Blanche, minister of Northleach's Congregational chapel. In 1870 and 1906 one Thomas Stephens held the manor. In 1914 it was held by one Charles Cole, who died in 1931, leaving it to Mrs Alice Cole. Church and chapels=Church of England 15th-century east window of SS Peter and Paul parish church, with glass designed by Christopher Webb and made in 1963 The earliest record of the parish church is from about 1100. Little from this period survives in the current Church of England parish church of SS Peter and Paul except some Norman masonry in the west wall of the lady chapel. The next oldest part of the church is a 14th-century cusped doorway on the north side of the chancel. From the late 14th century the church was almost completely rebuilt in Perpendicular Gothic style. The west tower was built in about 1380‚Äì1400, and the font is also late 14th-century. The current nave and south porch were built in the first half of the 15th century, as was the pulpit. The nave has tall five-bay arcades with slender octagonal columns ornamented with concave sides. The nave clerestory was paid for by John Fortey, a wool merchant, who died in 1459. The lady chapel is south of the chancel, was completed in 1489 and has a squint to the high altar in the chancel. The church was restored 1877‚Äì84 to designs by the Gothic Revival architect James Brooks. The chancel received a stained glass east window made by Alexander Gibbs in 1871. Little of Brooks' work at Northleach survives, except for his choir stalls in the north aisle. In 1920 a new high altar with riddel posts designed by FE Howard was installed in the chancel. In 1961 a new restoration was begun, which includes seats designed by Sir Basil Spence and made by Gordon Russell. In the chancel Gibbs' 1871 east window was replaced by a modern one of Christ in Majesty made by Christopher Webb in 1963. The church is now a Grade I listed building. Its benefice is now combined with the parishes of Cold Aston, Compton Abdale, Farmington, Hampnett, Haselton, Notgrove and Turkdean. The parish church has a number of monumental brasses. Most portray local wool merchants in civilian clothes with their wives: John Taylour (died 1400) and his wife Joane, Thomas Fortey (died 1447) with his wife Agnes and her first husband William Sors, John Fortey (died 1459), William Midwinter (died 1501) and his wife, Robert Serche (died 1501) and his wife Anne, Thomas Busshe (died 1526) and his wife Johane. In the chancel is a brass portraying a priest, William Lander (died 1530), in his Mass vestments. In 1700 William and Robert Cor of Aldbourne, Wiltshire cast a ring of six bells for the west tower. In 1897, the year of the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria, Mears and Stainbank of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry cast a new treble and second bell to increase the ring to eight, and the enlarged ring was rehung. In 1922 the sixth (formerly the fourth) bell from 1700 was recast. David Verey described the church as \\"next to Cirencester the most beautiful church in the Cotswolds\\". Congregational chapel Congregational chapel in High Street Dissenters were recorded in Northleach in the 17th and 18th centuries, and by 1796 a Congregationalist group established was meeting in a room in the town. A chapel for it was built at West End in 1798, with a burial ground that remained in use until the 1950s. The chapel was recorded in 1801 as sharing a minister with the chapel at Pancakehill in Chedworth, an arrangement that continued until about 1950. In 1851 the congregation numbered 80 and in 1860 a new chapel was built for it on the main street by the marketplace. In 1900 membership had declined to 28. In 1964 the chapel needed extensive repairs, so it was sold and converted into a house. For a while the congregation worshipped in the Cotswold Hall, but by 1969 it had so few members that it was meeting in a member's home. Methodist chapel In 1821 a group was recorded as meeting at Northleach who may have been Wesleyan Methodists. A small chapel for the group was built at Millend in 1827 and had a Sunday school by 1833. In 1851 the chapel's afternoon service had a congregation of 100 and its evening service had 117. The chapel was a member of the Cheltenham Circuit, and often members of the Cheltenham congregation walked each way on Sundays to conduct services at Northleach. Membership later declined, partly attracted by the new Congregational chapel opened in 1860, and the Wesleyan chapel was closed in 1883. The Primitive Methodists soon bought the chapel but their mission in Northleach was unsuccessful. By 1889 The Salvation Army had bought the chapel, but they too were unsuccessful. The Congregationalists had bought the former Wesleyan chapel by 1912 and used it as an institute until about 1923. Economic and social history Market place and town sign In 1219 or 1220 Gloucester Abbey founded the town as a borough with a charter to hold a regular market. The town is strategically placed on what used to be the main road between Oxford and Gloucester, just east of its junction with the Fosse Way Roman road. In the late Middle Ages the town prospered as a strategic centre for the wool trade. Roads and railways The Oxford ‚Äì Gloucester road was turnpiked in 1751, and by the 1770s it was the main road for both stagecoaches and mail coaches linking Gloucester and South Wales with London. Northleach became a staging post, with the King's Head became the main coaching inn, and by about 1820 the Sherborne Arms trying to win a share of the trade. In 1841 the Cirencester Branch Line opened and the coach trade lost traffic to the Great Western Railway. A truncated coach service via Northleach then linked Gloucester and Cheltenham with Steventon railway station in what was then Berkshire, until in 1845 the Cheltenham and Great Western Union Railway completed the Golden Valley Line between and via . By 1853 Northleach's only remaining coach was a single service between Cheltenham and Oxford. In 1860 a bill to build a railway via Northleach was presented to Parliament. Objections, chiefly from the Great Western Railway, defeated the bill at the committee stage. In 1862 the Bourton-on-the-Water Railway opened, with its terminus at northeast of Northleach. In 1881 the Banbury and Cheltenham Direct Railway was completed between Bourton and and opened a station at north of Northleach. The Oxford ‚Äì Cheltenham road ceased to be a turnpike in 1870. It has been classified as the A40 road since the 1920s, and in 1984 it was diverted north of the town by the building of a new bypass road. Since the 1920s the Fosse Way between Cirencester and Halford, Warwickshire has been classified as the A429 road. In 1962 British Railways closed and dismantled the line between Bourton and Cheltenham and withdrew passenger trains between Bourton and . In 1964 BR withdrew freight services from Bourton and dismantled the line between there and Kingham. Since then the nearest railway stations to Northleach have been Kemble on the Golden Valley Line and Kingham on the Cotswold Line between and . Kingham is nearer in a straight line, but each is about from Northleach by road. Law and administration The former House of Correction, built in 1791 and extended in 1842 In 1791 the House of Correction was built outside Northleach on land just west of Fosse Way. It was a new prison designed by the architect William Blackburn on principles advocated by the prison reformer Sir George Onesiphorus Paul. Petty sessions were held at the prison, serving a Petty sessional division whose extent was confirmed in 1836 as 25 parishes. By 1841 a detachment of the new Gloucestershire Constabulary was based at Northleach, and a women's wing was added to the prison in 1842. In 1857 the prison was reduced to holding only remand prisoners, and part of the building was converted into the police station. In 1859 part of the keeper's house was converted into the petty sessions court. Northleach Court care home. It was built in 1836 as the workhouse. Parliament passed the Poor Law Amendment Act in 1834 and a poor law union based on Northleach was established in 1836. A workhouse was designed on a cruciform plan by George Wilkinson of Witney, Oxfordshire and built at the east end of the town. From 1846 a division of the Gloucester county court sat at Northleach, initially at the King's Head Inn. Under the Local Government Act 1894, a Northleach rural district was established in 1895 administering 29 local parishes. In 1936‚Äì37 the main cell blocks of the prison were demolished and the height of the perimeter wall was reduced. In 1972 the police moved to a new station in West End. The following year Northleach petty sessional division was merged with that of Stow-on-the- Wold, and all trials were moved there. In 1980 the surviving prison buildings were converted into a museum or rural life. They are now a Grade II* listed building. In the late 1940s the workhouse was converted into a geriatric hospital. It was closed in 1987, sold, converted into a private nursing home and reopened as such in 1995. The County Court ceased sitting at Northleach in 1950. Under the Local Government Act 1972, Northleach Rural District Council was dissolved in 1974 and the area became part of the new Cotswold District Council. Northleach and several neighbouring parishes form the district council's Northleach ward. For elections to Gloucestershire County Council, Northleach is part of the ward of Bourton-on-the-Water and Northleach. Grammar schools In 1559 a bequest by wealthy landowner and sheep-farmer, Hugh Westwood of Chedworth, founded Northleach Grammar School. In 1560 a building on the corner of High Street and Conduit Street (now Farmington Road) was bought by the town to be the school building. In 1606 an Act of Parliament vested its patronage and rights of presentation in The Queen's College, Oxford. College House was built in the 17th century and extended in the late 18th or early 19th century. It was the headmaster's house and also lodged the boarding pupils. In 1877 it was reorganised under the Endowed Schools Acts of 1873 and 1874, and it had 30 pupils in 1885. It ran out of funds and was closed by its governors about 1904. In 1927 a new, co-educational Westwood's Grammar School was built at the east end of the town. It later came under the administration of Gloucestershire County Council. In 1987 it had 305 pupils in 1987. In 1988 it was closed and its pupils were transferred to the Cotswold School at Bourton-on-the-Water. In 1989 the Westwood Educational Trust was established. Westwood's Grammar School has since been demolished and the Westwood Community Centre built on its site. Primary school A National School in Northleach was founded in 1831 and had 32 pupils in 1833. School buildings on a new site south of Millend were started in 1874 and completed the next year, when the school moved in with about 117 pupils. By 1897 it had been enlarged with capacity for 200 pupils, and average attendance was 144. In 1997 Northleach Church of England Primary School had 122 pupils. It is one of the few Gloucestershire primary schools with its own outdoor swimming pool.Northleach Church of England Primary School The pool is open to the public for a small charge in the summer holidays. Amenities The Sherborne Arms The town has two pubs: The Sherborne ArmsSherborne Arms Northleach and The Wheatsheaf Inn.The Wheatsheaf Inn There are also a food takeaway, a butcher, a baker, art and antique dealers and other shops. The former House of Correction is now the Old Prison museum and visitor centre, also called Escape to the Cotswolds. Northleach used to have a private museum, the World of Mechanical Music, that exhibited and restored music boxes and other self- playing instruments. It closed down in 2019. The building is now a private house. Northleach Town Football Club has two teams, both of which play in the Cheltenham Association Football League.Northleach Town F.C. Northleach Town Cricket Club has a first and second men's team, ladies' team and junior team. The first eleven played in the Cotswold District Cricket Association league until 2013, since which time it has played only friendly matches.Northleach Town Cricket Club Northleach also has a sports and social club, darts, running, skittles, snooker and pool and tennis clubs. Most of the clubs use the Northleach Pavilion which is leased from the Town Council. Westwood Community Centre has facilities for a number of sports and community activities. The Snooker Club uses the ground floor of the Cotswold Hall which is on West End, almost opposite the Wheatsheaf Inn. Public transport Northleach's main bus service is Stagecoach West route 853, which links Cheltenham and Oxford via Burford and Witney. Services run four times each way a day from Mondays to Saturdays. There is currently no Saturday service. Stagecoach took over the service in July 2020. Its previous operator, Swanbrook Services of Staverton, had operated route 853 with coaches for 35 years. Pulham's Coaches of Bourton-on-the-Water serve Northleach. Pulham's route 801 runs between Cheltenham and Moreton-in-Marsh via Charlton Kings, Andoversford, Bourton-on-the-Water and Stow-on-the-Wold. Not all services on route 801 serve Northleach: only two each way a day on Mondays to Saturdays and one on public holidays. A Pulham's bus on route 855 in the Market Square Pulham's route 855 between Cirencester and Moreton-in-Marsh via Bourton-on- the-Water and Stow-on-the-Wold also serves Northleach. Currently three buses each way a day serve Northleach on Mondays to Saturdays. In culture and media In 1947 L. S. Lowry painted \\"A Street in Northleach\\". In 1999 the BBC drama The Wyvern Mystery was filmed in Northleach. In 2002, The Gathering was filmed in Northleach, taking over the market place with a fair and fake bomb explosion. It was released to DVD in several European countries, but the DVD was not released in the UK until 2010. In August 2014 filming began for the BBC's adaptation of J. K. Rowling's The Casual Vacancy with the marketplace being transformed into the fictional town of Pagford. In 2015 filming started for You, Me and the Apocalypse a Sky One miniseries, the marketplace was again transformed to look like an apocalyptic version of a Suffolk village. In September 2016 BBC Three started filming This Country, a mockumentary sitcom set in an anonymous Cotswolds village, first broadcast on BBC iPlayer. The first series was filmed over three weeks. In June 2017 the music video for \\"Benz Truck\\" by the now deceased US singer and rapper Lil Peep was released for his debut album Come Over When You're Sober, Pt. 1. Several parts of the video were filmed in Northleach, most notably outside the parish church. Other parts were filmed in Russia and Los Angeles, California. As of November 2018 the video had garnered more than a hundred million views on YouTube and forty million listens on the streaming platform SoundCloud. Lil Peep was filmed on the curiously named road \\"All Alone\\" in Northleach, but he missed an opportunity by not finding a nearby street called \\"The Peep\\".

It is situated on the V√§r√∂ Peninsula (Swedish: V√§r√∂halv√∂n) in Varberg Municipality approximately 65 km south of Gothenburg. With a total power rating of 3,055 MWe, it is the largest power plant in Sweden and generates 23 TWh of electricity a year, the equivalent of 15% of the electrical power usage of Sweden. It is owned 70% by Vattenfall and 30% by Uniper SE. The plant has three operating reactors: one boiling water reactor (R1) and two pressurized water reactors (R3 and R4). A third pressurized water reactor, R2, was permanently shut down in 2019.  History = Planning and construction, 1965-1983  Planning and land procurement of the site started in 1965. Two reactors were ordered in 1968: one boiling water reactor from ABB-ATOM (R1) and one pressurized water reactor from Westinghouse (R2). Construction work started in 1969; commercial operation started for R2 in 1975, and for R1 in 1976. Two more pressurized water reactors, R3 and R4, were ordered from Westinghouse in 1971 and construction work started in 1972. So far the public and political opinion in Sweden was fairly positive to nuclear power. One reason was that until 1970 nearly all electricity came from a continuously increasing exploitation of the large and wild rivers in the north of Sweden, and the diminishing number of remaining, unexploited rivers created fierce opposition against further hydro power development. Opinion changed and in the parliamentary election of 1976 a new government was elected with a clear mandate to phase out nuclear power no later than 1985. Formally this was imposed through a new law, Villkorslagen which required proof of an \\"absolute safe\\" method for disposal of spent nuclear fuel before new reactors were allowed to be loaded with fresh nuclear fuel. The law went into force in spring 1977 and hindered the recently completed unit R3 from being loaded with nuclear fuel. The Swedish nuclear industry then developed a concept for disposal of high-level radioactive waste called KBS-1, later further developed to KBS-3. Based upon the KBS-1 concept R3 was, through a highly controversial process including a governmental crisis, granted permission to load fuel on 27 March 1979. The Three Mile Island accident occurred the following day which triggered a referendum in Sweden about nuclear power. The referendum was held on 23 March 1980 and the result was interpreted as a \\"yes\\" to completion of construction and operation of the whole Swedish nuclear program with 12 reactors. Hence R3 could be loaded with fuel and started commercial operation on 9 September 1981, more than four years after essentially completed the construction phase in 1977. R4 was also somewhat delayed due to the referendum but also due to remediation of some technical problems identified at the start-up of the sister-plant R3, and started commercial operation 21 November 1983.  Major modifications and upgrades  As a result of the Three Mile Island accident in 1979, all Swedish reactors were required to install FCVS - Filtered Containment Venting System - and ICSS - Independent Containment Spray System. In case of an accident with core degradation and loss of all cooling systems the ICSS can still limit the containment pressure, and should this fail the FCVS can relieve the containment pressure with limited releases of radioactivity. The systems went into operation at Barseb√§ck 1985 and for the other plants 1989. As a result of the Barseb√§ck strainer incident in 1992 the recirculation strainer capacity was significantly increased for R1 in 1992 and R2 in 1994. Units R3 and R4 made similar upgrades in 2005. During the 2005-2015 period, significant improvements were made regarding fire separation, redundancy and diversification of various safety systems, particularly for the older plants R1 and R2 . The original steam generators for the Ringhals PWRs had tubes of Inconel-600 and details in the construction that made them prone to cracks and corrosion. This triggered huge efforts for inspection, maintenance and repair. Although designed for 40 years of operation, both unit R2 and R3 replaced their steam generators after 14 years, i.e. 1989 and 1995. Unit R4, starting later, could take advantage of being aware of the problems, and due to high attention to water chemistry and maintenance efforts the R4 steam generators were replaced in 2011 after 28 years of operation. All the new steam generators have tubes of Inconel-690 and improved design, and have had very few problems and high availability. This is especially true for R2 which, as of 2017, had been operating 28 years with the new steam generators. As a result of analysis and observations from the Three Mile Island accident, the Ringhals PWR reactors installed PAR - Passive Autocatalytic hydrogen Recombiners in 2007. Each reactor contains a number of PAR units with catalytic plates, which after a severe core degradation can process the hydrogen emanating from the fuel cladding oxidation within a few hours and hence reduce the risk for violent hydrogen combustion. All European nuclear power plants including Ringhals had to perform stress-tests after the Fukushima accident 2011, where consequences of certain beyond-design-events should be assessed. The availability of FCVS - Filtered Containment Venting System, ICSS - Independent Containment Spray System and PAR - Passive Autocatalytic hydrogen Recombiners, turned out to be valuable capabilities in these beyond-design-events and no immediate plant modifications were proposed as a post-Fukushima-response. On the contrary Ringhals made significant upgrades in the emergency preparedness organization in the size, education and training of the staffing, and in the independence and durability (power supply, communications, etc) for certain systems and buildings. In December 2014, the Swedish regulator required that all Swedish reactors should be equipped with an Independent Core Cooling System - ICCS - before 31 December 2020. The system should be able to cool the reactor during 72 hours without any supply of water, power, fuel or other consumables, and should survive external events (seismic events, hard weather etc) with an estimated probability of exceedance of 10‚àí6/yr. The requirements are influenced by the so called \\"Forsmark-event\\" 25 July 2006 and the Fukushima accident. Design of and preparations for ICCS is (2017) already underway for R3 and R4, but will not be made for R1 and R2 since they will be shut down before 2021.  Incidents  Following a number of observations of deficiencies in the safety culture since 2005, the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority decided in 2009 to put Ringhals under increased surveillance. Ringhals made certain efforts in order to improve traceability and transparency in decision making, internal audits and analyses of incidents and mistakes. The regulator acknowledged the improvements, and the increased surveillance was waived for 2013. In 2012 a small quantity of explosives, although without any firing device, was found during a routine check underneath a truck at the plant. For a short time all nuclear power plants in Sweden increased their alert level, but no more explosives were found, and no-one could be tied to the discovery. In October 2012, 20 anti-nuclear Greenpeace activists scaled the outer perimeter standard industrial fence, and there was also an incursion at Forsmark nuclear power plant. Greenpeace said that its non-violent actions were \\"intended to protest against the continuing operation of these reactors, which it argues were shown to be unsafe in European stress tests.\\" The inner perimeter fence (with barbered wire, CCTV-surveillance, \\"no-go\\" zone etc) around the reactors was not scaled. On 30 July 2018, Ringhals-2 was taken offline during the 2018 European heat wave, since the sea water temperature exceeded the design limit 25 DegC. The reactor was restarted on 3 August. The other reactors R1, R3 and R4 were not affected since they are licensed for slightly higher temperatures.  Plans for operation and decommissioning  In October 2015, Vattenfall decided to close down Ringhals 1 by 2020 and Ringhals 2 by 2019 due to their declining profitability, instead of, as previously announced, around 2025. Ringhals 3 and 4 are still expected to continue in service until the 2040s. In January 2016, Vattenfall announced that all its Swedish nuclear power plants, including the newer reactors, were operating at a loss due to low electricity prices and Sweden's nuclear power tax (\\"effektskatt\\"). It warned that it may be forced to shut all the nuclear plants down, and argued that the nuclear output tax, which constituted over one third of the price, should be scrapped. Through an agreement 10 June 2016 the major part of the nuclear power tax was removed on 1 July 2017, but combined with prolonged and enhanced support for renewable electricity production. The removal of the nuclear power tax corresponds to a tax reduction of approximately 7 √∂re or 0.007 EUR/kWh which corresponds to around 25% of the generating cost. This is a significant cost reduction and has been important for Vattenfall's decision to operate R3 and R4 until the 2040s. On 20 December 2019, the R2 reactor was permanently shut down. On June 2020, a contract was signed between Svenska kraftn√§t (Swedish national grid operator) and Ringhals AB that would grant Ringhals an allowance of 300 million SEK (approximately 30 million US dollars) to keep R1 reactor connected to the grid from 1st of July to 15th September 2020 in order to increase grid stability. Strictly Ringhals 1 is not required to produce any active power during the contract period, but the generators will be available for control of voltage and reactive power in a situation with large electricity generation in the north of Sweden and large consumption in the south.

A member of the House of Yngling from the Ynglinga saga, he was the son of Gudr√∏d the Hunter and according to the late Heimskringla, a half-brother of Halfdan the Black. Gudr√∏d and Olaf ruled a large part of Raumarike. Ynglinga saga In the Ynglinga saga portion of the Heimskringla, the king is reported to have died of a \\"disease in his foot\\" (f√≥tarverkr) or gout, although the Flateyjarb√≥k suggests the king succumbed to a plague . The Ynglinga saga also inserts the following verse by √ûj√≥√∞√≥lfr of Hvinir (original author of the Ynglingatal): > { - valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"50%\\" Og ni√∞kv√≠sl / √≠ Noregi > √ær√≥ttar √ûr√≥s / of √ær√≥ast n√°√∞i. > R√©√∞ √ìlafr / ofsa for√∞um > v√≠√∞ri grund / of Vestmari. > > Uns f√≥tverkr / vi√∞ Foldar √ær√∂m > v√≠gmi√∞lung / of vi√∞a skyldi. > N√∫ liggr gunndjarfr / √° Geirst√∂√∞um > herkonungr / haugi ausinn. >  Long while this branch of Odin's stem > Was the stout prop of Norway's realm; > Long while King Olaf with just pride > Ruled over Westfold far and wide. > At length by cruel gout oppressed, > The good King Olaf sank to rest: > His body now lies under ground, > Buried at Geirstad, in the mound. > } King Olaf the Saint was regarded as a reincarnation of Olaf Geirstad-Alf according to legend.  Olaf Geirstad-Alf Olaf was worshipped after his death as an \\"elf\\", and was called the Geirstad-alf (the \\"elf of Geirstad\\"). The account of this is recorded in the √û√°ttr √ìlafs Geirsta√∞a Alfs in the Flateyjarb√≥k version of √ìl√°fs saga helga, and continues with a fantastical story of how he became a drow (draugr) haunting his own (', or grave-mound), but instructed to be destroyed so he can be reborn as Olaf the Saint. According to this version, Olaf was carried away by a plague that subsided after his death. Olaf had instructed his people to build a howe and lay him to rest inside, forbidding them to worship him after his death seeking propitious boon. But as Olaf suspected, once the next famine arrived, \\"they resorted to the plan of sacrificing to King Olaf for plenty, and they called him Geirsta√∞a√°lfr\\". Later, the spirit of Olaf appears in a dream to a man named Hrani, who is instructed to break into the howe, salvage the ring, with the sword named Besing (B√¶singr) and a belt which are to be presented to Queen √Åsta for her future son. The man was also bidden to sever the head of the drow though making sure the head was set straight on its neck in the beheading process. The man does as instructed, and the queen gives birth to the future Olaf the Saint., citing Flateyjarb√≥k: √ìl√°fs Saga Helga, II, 7, p. 7. Later on as Olaf the Saint is riding by the howe, one of his men remember him saying he had once been laid to rest there. The king vehemently denies this, saying his soul could not occupy two bodies. Davidson suggest the notion of rebirth is communicated here., citing Flateyjarb√≥k: √ìl√°fs Saga Helga, II, 106, p. 135. At any rate, Olaf the Saint is thought to be eponymously named after Olaf Geirstad-Alf. That the king came to be called an \\"elf\\" should not be taken too literally. Vigfusson and Powell discusses Olaf's rite and other example under the topical heading of \\"Ancestor Worship\\" and notes that in these instances, \\"the dead were called 'Elves'\\". H. R. E. Davidson gives a more extensive summary under the chapter \\"The Cult of the Dead\\", and notes that as for the animated corpse that he had become inside his grave-mound, \\"the usual word for him is draugr\\". A current hypothesis identifies Geirstad with Gjerstad near Gokstadhaugen and links Olaf's burial with the Gokstad Ship. This theory is unproven at present.

It rose to political significance between the First and Second World Wars and is currently professed by 5.7%https://www.indexmundi.com/palau/demographics_profile.html to 8.8% of Palau's population. Modekngei is a hybrid of ancient Palauan customs and Christianity. Followers of the religion believe in the Christian God and recognize Jesus Christ as their savior and simultaneously make appeasements to the traditional Palauan deities. History The origins of Modekngei are unknown, but one theory is that Modekngei began as a form of cultural resistance to the Japanese occupation of Palau. By amalgamating native animistic and Christian beliefs in an oral tradition of chants called keskes, the islanders may have been better able to preserve and transmit their traditions. A common story in Ngatpang is that the religion developed from the efforts of Christian missionaries in Palau who hoped to convert the islanders. After visiting Ibobang, a village of about 100 people in Ngatpang state, where most of the 100 inhabitants follow Modekngei today, the missionaries were so impressed by the villagers' commitment their customs that they allowed the Palauans to keep their goddess while still practicing Christianity. Practices The goal of Modekngei is to preserve ancient Palauan traditions in a way that aligns with Christianity. Adherents in Ibobang practice a traditional lifestyle centered on ancient ideas of family, community, and purity. The religion prohibits followers from all alcohol and drug use, and children in the village are required to be home by dark and abstain from making loud noises in sacred places. Citizens of Ibobang attend daily church services. The church building is located in the center of the village and is likewise the center of activity. One Modekngei custom requires members of the community to walk silently to church each morning. To speak, especially loudly, before a church service is disrespectful and borderline blasphemous. Women in Ibobang usually dress in western apparel, but at church they are required to always wear a skirt or dress when either entering or passing the building. As a result, it‚Äôs not uncommon to see a woman in Ibobang dressed in pants to take a longer route to her destination to keep from crossing the church grounds without the proper attire. Daily Modekngei church services are short, consisting mostly of individual and group prayers. However, services celebrating both traditional and religious holidays are more elaborate and can last several days, with weeks of communal preparation. One custom that most Palauans observe‚Äîregardless of religious affiliation‚Äîis the prohibition of alcohol or tobacco within the Ibobang city limits. According to tradition, violating this religious ban will bring terrible rainstorms upon the village that won‚Äôt go away until the sin has been forgiven by the Modekngei goddess. Even Palauans who may normally drink or smoke will abstain from bringing the banned substances within the city limits. The belief that rains will plague the village is so strong that Modekngei elders will hang fruit and other treats on tree branches throughout the village in hopes of bribing the goddess to be forgiving of outsiders' misconduct. Another customary activity that takes place in Ibobang is the blessing of the roads. This particular custom coincides with the moon‚Äôs cycle. A few days before each full moon, the community works together to clean the entire village. Lawns are cut, trash is cleaned and houses are scrubbed. Then, the evening before the full moon dawns, everyone who lives in Ibobang waits inside their houses while a village elder walks up and down the streets chanting prayers and blessings over the village. This is a necessary practice in Modekngei because it‚Äôs believed that during a full moon, the Modekngei goddess is better able to see the malpractices of her people. Belau Modekngei School Ibobang is the home of Belau Modekngei School (BMS), a boarding school for high school students situated at the far end of the village. In 1974, a handful of Modekngei elders realized their desire to pass on the ancient traditions of the Modekngei religion to future generations. Today, between 25 and 30 students from the 9th to 12th grade are enrolled at BMS. Students and faculty have the option of living on campus in traditional dormitory-style housing with no electricity or running water, or in the surrounding villages of Ngatpang. Slightly more than half the students live on campus. The student body at BMS is diverse. Some of the students attend because they come from families who value a traditional education. Other students enroll at BMS as a last resort. As one of very few private high schools on Palau, BMS has the option of accepting students who have been expelled from the island's only public high school. Students at BMS study core academic subjects such as English, Math and Palauan, but they also take Modekngei religious classes, have the opportunity to farm ancient medicinal crops, and practice traditional customs with the wider village. Belau Modekngei's primary goal is to preserve Modekngei religion for future generations of Palauans.

It was legislated into creation in 1996 in response to recommendations made by the Royal Commission on Learning in February 1995. EQAO is governed by a board of directors appointed by the Lieutenant Governor in Council. Cameron Montgomery has been the chair of the board since February 2019.EQAO welcomes Dr. Cameron Montgomery, Chair of its Board of Directors EQAO has an annual budget of approximately $33 million CDN. Purpose The stated purpose of EQAO tests is to ensure that there is accountability between school boards and schools in the publicly funded system in Ontario. Educational accountability is important to three key stakeholders: taxpayers, elected officials, and teachers.Volante, L. (2007). Educational quality and accountability in Ontario: Past, present, and future. Canadian Journal of Educational Administration and Policy, 1(58), 1-21. By providing yearly standardized tests, the Ministry of Education hopes to increase the quality of education in Ontario, while also using the tests to make plans for future improvement.(2012). Education Quality and Accountability Office. Retrieved from http://www.eqao.com/categories/home.aspx?Lang=E. EQAO tests are intended to measure the students' ability to: * Make sense of what they read in different kinds of texts; * Express their thoughts in writing using appropriate grammar, spelling and punctuation and * Use appropriate math skills to solve problems (2011). EQAO tests in elementary school: A guide for parents. Retrieved from http://www.eqao.com/pdf_e/11/EQAO_ParentGuide_PrimaryJunior2011. EQAO versus classroom tests It is important to note that EQAO tests have different goals and intentions than normal classroom tests. These tests are not the same, but when considering the EQAO test results along with the classroom results, they can provide a picture of the students' overall learning. Classroom tests: * measure how well students have learned specific information; * provide quick results teachers can use to modify teaching strategies; * may have subjective components, based on the teacher‚Äôs knowledge of each student, and * provide results that may not be comparable across the school, board or province (2011). EQAO tests in elementary school: A guide for parents. Retrieved October 26, from http://www.eqao.com/pdf_e/11/EQAO_ParentGuide_PrimaryJunior2011. EQAO tests: * measure students‚Äô cumulative knowledge and skills in relation to a provincial standard; * are given at key stages of students‚Äô education; * are administered, scored and reported on in a consistent and objective manner and * provide results that are comparable across the school, board, and province from year to year (2011). EQAO tests in elementary school: A guide for parents. Retrieved October 26, from http://www.eqao.com/pdf_e/11/EQAO_ParentGuide_PrimaryJunior2011. Mandate EQAO‚Äôs mandate is to conduct province-wide tests at key points in every student‚Äôs primary, junior and secondary education and report the results to educators, parents and the public. The specific responsibilities of the Office include: * developing tests for students in both the French- and English- language publicly-funded school systems, * overseeing the administration and marking of tests, in co-operation with school boards * evaluating the quality and effectiveness of Ontario‚Äôs education system * managing Ontario's participation in national and international tests * researching and collecting information on assessing academic achievement * reporting to the public and to the Minister of Education and Training on the results of tests and generally on the quality and effectiveness of elementary and secondary school education and on the public accountability of boards * making recommendations to the Government of Ontario on any matter related to the quality or effectiveness of elementary and secondary school education or to the public accountability of boards. EQAO conducts province-wide tests annually. Students attending publicly-funded elementary and secondary schools in Ontario are required to take the respective tests at their grade level: * Grade 3 (literacy and math tested at the end of the primary division); * Grade 6 (literacy and math tested at the end of the junior division); * Grade 9 (math tested in the first year of secondary school) and * Grade 10 (literacy tested as a graduation requirement, known as the Ontario Secondary School Literacy Test). For students with special education needs, some accommodations that are consistent with regular classroom assessment practices are permitted on the provincial tests. Special provisions may also be permitted for English language learners. In extenuating circumstances, the principal may exempt a student from writing the test if they are unable to complete part or all of the test, even with the appropriate accommodations.(2011). EQAO tests in elementary school: A guide for parents. Retrieved from http://www.eqao.com/pdf_e/11/EQAO_ParentGuide_PrimaryJunior2011. The question on EQAO‚Äôs tests are developed by Ontario educators and linked directly to the learning expectations in The Ontario Curriculum. Use of test results Educators use the results of Ontario‚Äôs province-wide tests in combination with other important information, such as demographic information, to help improve student learning and achievement. According to a 2010 survey by EQAO, more than 95% of elementary school principals and 80% of Grades 3 and 6 teachers use EQAO test results to identify areas of strength and areas for improvement in reading, writing and math programs. More than 95% of principals also reported that they use the data to guide overall school improvement initiatives. Ontario student achievement results have had mixed success and failure since the EQAO began. For example, in the last five years, Grade 6 student reading scores have increased from 79% to 82% of students meeting the provincial standard (up from an all time low in 1999 of only 48%). Similar improvements have been seen for writing with the percentage of students meeting the provincial standard increasing from 78% to 80% in the last 5 years (up from an all time low in 1999 of only 48%). However, over the last five years Math scores have degraded from 54% of students achieving the provincial standard in 2013 to only 49% in 2018. Previous EQAO math testing had a high score of 63% in 2009. The dramatic 14% decrease in math scores in only ten years has resulted in the province launching an entire new math curriculum for the 2019-2020 school year. Information for parents EQAO tests are based on The Ontario Curriculum, which is the foundation for what is taught in classrooms every day. Therefore, students should not need to study or do extra preparation for the test. All of the information in the test will have been covered by the classroom teacher throughout the entire school year. The best way for parents to support their children in writing the test is simply to be supportive and a play an active role in their children's learning every day of the school year.(2011). EQAO tests in elementary school: A guide for parents. Retrieved from http://www.eqao.com/pdf_e/11/EQAO_ParentGuide_PrimaryJunior2011. This support includes being aware of what the students are learning, being in constant communication with the classroom teacher about the student's learning development and needs, and providing a welcoming environment at home where students are able to complete any homework or assignments they may have. An additional way that parents can help students in preparing for the test is to visit the EQAO website (eqao.com) in order to find links explaining the format and sample test items, a result guide that explains how to interpret the marks, as well as a parent bulletin regarding the test.Mu, M., & Childs, R. (2005). What parents know and believe about large-scale assessments. Canadian Journal of Educational Administration and Policy, 1(37), 1-24. The school boards also provide parents with information sessions regarding the tests, to ensure that the parents are fully aware of the purpose, format and implementation of the test.Mu, M., & Childs, R. (2005). What parents know and believe about large-scale assessments. Canadian Journal of Educational Administration and Policy, 1(37), 1-24. Challenges One of the biggest challenges surrounding EQAO testing is the idea that the traditional paper- and-pencil test does not assess all aspects of student learning. While the test is able to assess students' reading and writing, it struggles to effectively assess performance-based skills such as being able to work effectively in a group, designing a project or model, and speaking clearly.Volante, L. (2007). Educational quality and accountability in Ontario: Past, present, and future. Canadian Journal of Educational Administration and Policy, 1(58), 1-21. Another challenge associated with EQAO testing is that students' ability to do their best on the test may be affected by feelings of stress and test anxiety. Some students may feel pressured to do well, because of external pressures from the teacher and parents, or pressure from themselves to succeed, and therefore may struggle to complete the test in a way that truly demonstrates their knowledge and learning.Volante, L. (2007). Educational quality and accountability in Ontario: Past, present, and future. Canadian Journal of Educational Administration and Policy, 1(58), 1-21. Criticisms The establishment of the EQAO, and in particular standardized testing in Ontario, has been criticized by a number of groups, including the Ontario Secondary School Teachers' Federation (OSSTF) and the Elementary Teachers' Federation of Ontario (ETFO). . Since the beginning, EQAO has received extensive criticism, especially about areas such as validity of the test, timelines for the tests, uses of the data results, and security.The Elementary Teachers' Federation of Ontario. (2012). EQAO testing. Retrieved October 26, from http://www.etfo.ca/issuesineducation/eqaotesting/pages/default.aspx . The ETFO published a video on August 17, 2010, titled \\"Is EQAO Failing Our Children?\\". This video provides an outlook on EQAO from the teachers perspective, discussing how the test may be causing more damage to children than good. This video can be seen on YouTube here. While technical reports are available on the agency‚Äôs Web site, some have complained that the Office publishes little technical information about its tests. An evaluation conducted for EQAO, published by it in 2013, and posted on the websiteTodd Rogers. (2013). What is the quality of EQAO assessments? Excellent!. Toronto: Education Quality and Accountability Office. mentions no aspects of reliability or validity other than inter-rater agreement, and inter-rater agreement is presented as evidence of validity rather than of reliability. Some have also pointed out that EQAO‚Äôs staff tends to be drawn from the provincial education establishment. For example, former chair Charles Pascal, is a former deputy minister of education. The Office's impartiality has been questioned when it has issued test results that might be taken as reflecting well on the provincial government. Another major area of criticism is focused on the monetary expenses used each year to conduct the EQAO tests. The annual report states that $33 million was used in 2009/2010, plus an additional $77 million spent by the Literacy and Numeracy Secretariat, in hopes to improve future test scores.The Elementary Teachers' Federation of Ontario. (2012). EQAO testing. Retrieved October 26, from http://www.etfo.ca/issuesineducation/eqaotesting/pages/default.aspx . Some critics believe that the money poured into these annual tests could be better spent on things such as smaller class sizes, new schools, new classrooms, additional technology in classrooms, additional educational assistants, and additional classroom materials.The Elementary Teachers' Federation of Ontario. (2012). EQAO testing. Retrieved October 26, from http://www.etfo.ca/issuesineducation/eqaotesting/pages/default.aspx . Some critics believe that the teacher knows best about the students' learning, and that a standardized-test does not adequately assess the authentic learning that has gone on in the classroom throughout the year.The Elementary Teachers' Federation of Ontario. (2012). EQAO testing. Retrieved October 26, from http://www.etfo.ca/issuesineducation/eqaotesting/pages/default.aspx . Teachers are able to see the students everyday, track their learning progress, and provide the students with beneficial feedback to continue improving their work. EQAO tests on the other hand, approach learning from a structured and systematic perspective, forcing students to demonstrate their knowledge in a way very different from that which is typically done in the classroom. The test does not allow for the student to grow or learn from the process, due to the fact that feedback is prohibited throughout the time writing the test. The majority use of multiple-choice questions limits critical thinking, and restricts creativity in the students. In addition, the test provides only one form of assessment. Authentic assessment is that which provides students with multiple ways to demonstrate their learning (example, through writing, speaking, demonstration, and hands-on interactions).The Elementary Teachers' Federation of Ontario. (2012). EQAO testing. Retrieved October 26, from http://www.etfo.ca/issuesineducation/eqaotesting/pages/default.aspx . Other subjects such as science, business, visual arts, music and physical education are not being assessed in the test despite being part of the education system. Another recognized flaw in the EQAO testing system is with regards to Ontario‚Äôs French Immersion program, which is consistently growing in attendance and popularity. Canadian Parents for French. (2015). The state of French second language education in Ontario. Retrieved October 27, from http://on.cpf.ca/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/State-of-FSL-Education-in- Ontario-October-2015.pdfStudies have shown that students enrolled in early French Immersion programs demonstrate a lag in their English literacy skills in the grade 3 EQAO test. These lower scores cause undue stress and concern for parents, students and teachers of these students. It has been recommended that EQAO offers the opportunity for early immersion students to opt out of the grade 3 testing as the results do not accurately represent the students‚Äô abilities.

He was also a founder member of the polling firm YouGov. Political career Duddridge unsuccessfully contested Rother Valley at the 2001 general election for the Conservative Party, finishing second some 14,882 votes behind the sitting Labour MP, Kevin Barron but achieving a 5% swing in his favour. He was subsequently selected as the Conservatives' parliamentary candidate for Rochford and Southend East at the 2005 general election, following Sir Teddy Taylor's retirement. He held the seat for the Conservatives with a majority of 5,494 and delivered his maiden speech in the House of Commons on 9 June 2005. From 2005 to 2007, Duddridge has served on the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Select Committee, and the International Development Committee from 2006 to 2008, and in January 2008, he was appointed an Opposition Whip. He was returned at the 2010 general election again as Rochford and Southend East's MP, becoming a Lord Commissioner of the Treasury (Government Whip) with responsibility for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Department for Education, but later left government in Prime Minister David Cameron's September 2012 reshuffle. On 3 December 2010, Duddridge was permitted to reply on HM Government's behalf from the Despatch Box during an Adjournment debate, a rarity as Commons Whips ‚Äì particularly Government Whips ‚Äì by convention do not speak in the Chamber. Duddridge voted in favour of the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill at both its second reading in February 2013 and its third reading in May 2013. On 11 August 2014, it was announced that Duddridge would return to Government as Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs following the resignation of Mark Simmonds over his claims that he 'could not support his family in London on an MP's salary'. In September 2014, he claimed ¬£11,348 for accommodation in London on expenses, mostly for hotels, despite already owning two homes in the city. He stated that his claims were in accordance with the Independent Parliamentary Standards authority. The previous year, it was reported that he had the highest expenses claim of local MPs in Essex. He was accused by Sir Ian Kennedy of pursuing a \\"squalid vendetta\\" after he helped block the former head of the Commons expenses watchdog from an appointment to a new job of electoral commissioner in January 2018. Duddridge is seen as highly Eurosceptic having suggested in 2013 that the Government should tell the European Commissioner to \\"sod off\\" rather than pay benefits to Romanians and Bulgarians. In January 2016, the Labour Party unsuccessfully proposed an amendment in Parliament that would have required private landlords to make their homes \\"fit for human habitation\\". According to Parliament's register of interests, Duddridge was one of 72 Conservative MPs who voted against the amendment who personally derived an income from renting out property. The Conservative Government had responded to the amendment that they believed homes should be fit for human habitation but did not want to pass the new law that would explicitly require it. On 9 February 2017, Duddridge tabled an Early Day Motion following comments made by Commons speaker John Bercow on the subject of the pending state visit of US President Donald Trump. The motion proposed \\"that this House has no confidence in Mr Speaker\\", and received criticism from across the house. The bid to remove Bercow as Commons Speaker failed after just five MPs backed Duddridge's motion of no confidence. In the House of Commons he sits on the High Speed Rail (West Midlands - Crewe) Bill Select Committee (Commons) and has sat on the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee, the International Development Committee, the Regulatory Reform Committee, the Procedure Committee and the International Development Sub-Committee on the Work of the Independent Commission for Aid Impact. On 27 September 2017, The Times reported that Duddridge, who was Africa minister until 2016, was being paid ¬£3,300 for eight hours' work a month as a consultant for Brand Communications on top of his MP's salary. The newspaper reported that this had led to renewed calls to review the rules surrounding jobs for former members of government. It was reported that he was working for Brand Communications and that the company was one of a handful that had not agreed to the industry's code of conduct that bans hiring sitting MPs. Duddridge told The Times: \\"The work I do involves helping companies going into the African marketplace re-brand themselves. It is not a public affairs role.\\" On 27 Jul 2019 he was appointed Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union in Boris Johnson's administration.

Gordy is best known for his appearances in the United States with promotions such as World Class Championship Wrestling, Jim Crockett Promotions/World Championship Wrestling and the Universal Wrestling Federation as a member of The Fabulous Freebirds, as well as his appearances in Japan with All Japan Pro Wrestling as one-half of The Miracle Violence Connection. Championships held by Gordy over the course of his career include the Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship, AJPW World Tag Team Championship, WCW World Tag Team Championship, NWA World Tag Team Championship, UWF Heavyweight Championship and SMW Heavyweight Championship. He has been posthumously inducted into the Wrestling Observer, Professional Wrestling, and WWE Hall of Fame.  Professional wrestling career = Early career (1975‚Äì1979)  Gordy started wrestling in 1975 at the age of 14 as Terry Mecca for the International Wrestling Association. In early 1979, he began wrestling under his real name and formed The Fabulous Freebirds with Michael Hayes. Buddy Roberts was later added to the group.  Memphis CWA Wrestling and Mid South Wrestling (1979‚Äì1985)  The Freebirds came to Memphis the first time in 1979 and feuded mainly with Jerry Lawler & Bill Dundee. When in mid South Wrestling, he formed The Fabulous Freebirds as the suggestion by Bill Watts with Michael Hayes and Buddy Roberts. They returned in 1984 to feud with Lawler & Austin Idol and later with Lawler & Phil Hickerson.  World Class Championship Wrestling (1982‚Äì1989)  In 1982, the Freebirds went to World Class Championship Wrestling and had a heated and memorable feud with the Von Erichs (David, Kevin, Kerry and Mike) that was famously kicked off when Gordy slammed the Cage door on Kerry during his Cage Match at WCCW Star Wars (1982) against Ric Flair where Michael Hayes was the special guest Referee inciting a riot among fans attending. They traded the six man title back and forth a few times over the years. Gordy was also at one time one half of the WCCW American Tag Team champions. While in WCCW, Killer Khan taught Gordy how to perform the Oriental Spike.  All Japan Pro Wrestling (1983‚Äì1994)  Gordy teamed with Stan Hansen beginning in 1983 in All Japan Pro Wrestling. Gordy later teamed with Steve Williams as The Miracle Violence Connection. During his time there, he also held the Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship on two occasions.  World Wrestling Federation (1984)  The Freebirds spent a very brief time in the World Wrestling Federation in 1984, but were fired after missing a show and showing up, many times, late and drunk. Universal Wrestling Federation (1986) In 1986, when the Freebirds were in the Universal Wrestling Federation, the former Mid South Wrestling, Gordy won the UWF Heavyweight Championship title and held it for six months, before losing it via forfeit to The One Man Gang, after an angle the same night in which Gordy was injured by \\"Dr. Death\\" Steve Williams. During this time, Gordy and the Freebirds had an ongoing feud with the UWF fan favorite Hacksaw Jim Duggan, in which Duggan and Gordy frequently squared off, usually ending in a disqualification because of outside interference.  Jim Crockett Promotions/NWA World Championship Wrestling (1987, 1989, 1992)  The Freebirds spent some time in the National Wrestling Alliance's Jim Crockett Promotions where they split to feud briefly, but later reunited. In 1989, Gordy helped Hayes to reform the Freebirds, with Jimmy Garvin, in Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP), which became World Championship Wrestling in 1991. Later he alongside of Dr. Death Steve Williams defeated the Steiners to become World Tag Team Champions. Gordy and Williams returned to World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in 1992 and won the WCW World Tag Team titles. They also won the NWA World Tag Team titles in a tournament at the Great American Bash card in Albany, Georgia, one week later, and unified the titles. Their feud with Rick and Scott Steiner; in Japan, this was hyped as a feud between the best foreign teams of the two top Japanese promotions (the Steiners were competing for rival New Japan Pro Wrestling at the time). Despite advances by New Japan, Gordy and Williams, out of loyalty to the AJPW founder and promoter, Giant Baba, refused to compete for the promotion (which had business ties with WCW at the time), leading to Gordy's departure from WCW before Halloween Havoc and Williams' departure after Starrcade. In 1993 Gordy, while traveling from the United States to Japan for a tour, took an overdose of pain medication and slipped into a coma, ultimately suffering permanent brain damage.Foley, Mick (1999). Have a Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks. ReganBooks. . He returned to action later that year, but never received a shot at the Triple Crown again. In 1994, Gordy had a small reunion with Hayes and Garvin as the Freebirds in the Global Wrestling Federation where he and Garvin won the GWF Tag Team titles. Various promotions (1989-1995) After World Class folded in 1989, Gordy wrestled in various promotions. He started working for United States Wrestling Association (USWA). In 1991, he worked for Universal Wrestling Federation where he feuded with Don Muraco. In 1994, he reunited with The Freebirds (Michael Hayes and Jimmy Garvin) for Global Wrestling Federation in Texas where they feuded with Bill Irwin, Black Bart and Moadib. Gordy returned to USWA in 1995 where he teamed with Tracy Smothers.  Smokey Mountain Wrestling (1995)  In 1995 Gordy worked for Smokey Mountain Wrestling teaming with Tommy Rich as the Militia. He would feud with Brad Armstrong. Gordy won the SMW Heavyweight Championship defeating Armstrong when he teamed with Thrasher to defeat Armstrong and the Wolfman on October 27. A month later he dropped the title back to Armstrong in a Country whipping match. Gordy left SMW before its closed its doors at the end of the year.  Extreme Championship Wrestling (1996)  In 1996, Gordy showed up in Extreme Championship Wrestling to challenge Raven for the ECW World Heavyweight title, as the \\"internationally recognized #1 contender\\". He had been working for the International Wrestling Association of Japan promotion in Japan, wrestling deathmatches. He lost, but went on to team up with Tommy Dreamer and later to reunite with \\"Dr. Death\\" Steve Williams to wrestle The Eliminators. He also wrestled Bam Bam Bigelow in what was the second ever \\"Battle Of The Bam Bams\\" (The first happened on a Windy City Wrestling show). Gordy lost the match due to outside interference from The Eliminators.  Return to World Wrestling Federation (1995, 1996‚Äì1997, 1998)  On February 11 and 12 1995 Gordy worked as the Executioner teaming with Mike Bell losing to The Smoking Gunns. Gordy had a brief run in the WWF as The Executioner in 1996 and 1997. He teamed up with Mankind, both managed by Paul Bearer, and feuded with The Undertaker. The Executioner came to the ring under a mask and carrying an axe. He made his TV debut at the In Your House pay-per-view, Buried Alive, where he interfered in The Undertaker's Buried Alive match with Mankind, hitting Undertaker with a shovel and burying him with the help of Mankind and several other wrestlers. However, at In Your House 12: It's Time, The Undertaker defeated The Executioner in an Armageddon Rules match, and Gordy left the promotion shortly afterwards. His final televised appearance was on the January 12, 1997 episode of WWF Superstars, where he lost to Goldust, after which Paul Bearer turned on him by hitting him with his urn. He was advertised to be one of the 30 participants in the 1997 Royal Rumble match, but did not make an appearance. He returned to WWF one last time at a house show as the Executioner on April 28, 1998 losing to Wellington Wilkins. On an episode of Something to Wrestle With, Bruce Prichard claimed that the Executioner gimmick was given to Gordy because McMahon had doubts that Gordy could still compete effectively and the use of a mask was intended to protect Gordy so that if that were the case, Gordy's legacy would not be tainted. Had Gordy been able to compete at a high level then there would have been the opportunity later for Gordy to unmask. It was mentioned that the hiring was mostly done as a favor for Michael Hayes.  International Wrestling Association of Japan and WAR (1995‚Äì1997, 1998)  Gordy returned to Japan working for International Wrestling Association of Japan where he wrestled in deathmatches. Mainly worked in tag teams. He left IWA Japan in 1997. In 1998, Gordy returned to Japan for the final time working for Wrestle Association R where he feuded with Genichiro Tenryu.

On February 21, 1998 Gordy teamed with Dan Severn in a losing effort to Doug Gilbert and Dutch Mantel at the Eddie Gilbert Memorial Show for IWA Mid-South. Gordy would reunite with Hayes as they fought Glen Kulka and JR Smooth to a no contest for Power Pro Wrestling on May 28, 1999. He wrestled his last match returning to IWA Japan on February 4, 2001 with Shoichi Ichimiya, Tomohiro Ishii, Yukihide Ueno, and Yuji Kito defeating Doug Gilbert, TJ Shinjuku, Ultra Sebun, Takashi Uwano and Keizo Mastuda.  Personal life  Gordy left behind 2 young daughters, Amber and Miranda Gordy, and a son, Ray Gordy. Ray Gordy wrestled for WWE as \\"Jesse\\" and \\"Slam Master J\\" before being released in 2010. His nephew is Richard Aslinger, who competed for All Japan Pro Wrestling as Richard Slinger. His daughter Miranda currently wrestles on the independent circuit and has also competed in Japan.  Death  Gordy died of a heart attack caused by a blood clot on July 16, 2001. He was 40 years old. In 2014, he was posthumously inducted into the Southern Wrestling Hall of Fame. A year later, he was also posthumously inducted into the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum.

She was elected at the general election of 2005 as the Member of Parliament for St Albans in Hertfordshire, and was re-elected in 2010, 2015 and 2017. She lost her seat to Daisy Cooper, a Liberal Democrat, at the 2019 general election. Early life Main was born in Cardiff, Wales in 1957. She was state-educated at the Bishop of Llandaff Church in Wales High School in Rookwood Close in Llandaff, Cardiff. She read English at Swansea University obtaining a BA Hons, where she met her first husband, Stephen. She then obtained a PGCE from the University of Sheffield. She moved to the London area, and taught English and drama at an inner London comprehensive school. Political career Main's political career began in 1999, when she was elected as a town councillor in Beaconsfield in Buckinghamshire.St Albans & Harpenden Review ‚Äì St Albans MP Anne Main's full interview with John Lyon, November 2009, in which she states that \\"My family are based in our main home [in Beaconsfield] and I like to get home and see my husband in the evening.\\" She served as councillor for Beaconsfield South Ward on South Bucks District Council from 2001 to 2005. At the 2005 general election, she was elected as the Member of Parliament for St Albans, defeating the sitting Labour MP Kerry Pollard, achieving a 6.6% swing. In November 2005, Main endorsed David Cameron in the Conservative Party leadership election, after originally supporting his rival David Davis. At the general election of 2010 she retained her seat with an increased majority, despite a 3.75% swing to the Liberal Democrats. She then increased her majority in 2015 to 12,732 votes, picking up some votes from the Liberal Democrats as part of the collapse of that party's support nationwide. At the snap general election of 2017, Main received 43% of the vote, Daisy Cooper (Liberal Democrat) received 32%, Kerry Pollard (Labour) received 23% and Jack Easton (Green Party) received 2%. UKIP declined to stand a candidate in recognition of Main's eurosceptic views. She became Chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Bangladesh, and served on a number of Select Committees; in addition she became a member of the Panel of Chairs. At the 2016 EU Referendum, Main campaigned for a \\"Leave\\" vote. Main largely voted in accordance with her party, but rebelled over Brexit (which she supports), high-speed rail (which she opposes) and equal rights for gay marriage (which she opposes). Mrs Main was the MP for St Albans from 2005 to 2019 Against the national swing, she lost her seat to the Liberal Democrat candidate Daisy Cooper at the 2019 general election.https://www.bbc.com/news/politics/constituencies/E14000960 Main was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2020 Birthday Honours for public and parliamentary service. Expenses Main was investigated by The Daily Telegraph in May 2009 for claiming a second home allowance and a council tax discount for an apartment for a constituency home, which was also lived in full-time and rent-free by her daughter. On 26 June 2009, it was reported that she would face a Parliamentary inquiry into these allegations under John Lyon, the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, following a formal complaint thought to be from a constituent. In February 2010, Lyon concluded that the public should not have been expected to meet living costs for Main's daughter, and Main was ordered to repay ¬£7,100 (being ¬£2,100 wrongly claimed for food, along with an additional ¬£5,000 to reflect the daughter's use of the flat), and to provide a written apology to the committee. Main had argued the Fees Office had told her it was permissible for her daughter to share the second home. Main claimed ¬£22,000 a year for a second home, despite being able to commute both from her taxpayer-funded flat in St Albans, 26 miles from Westminster, or from her family house in Beaconsfield, 31 miles from Westminster. Concerns raised in connection with her parliamentary expenses resulted in an attempt by the local St Albans Conservative Association to deselect her, with a local party vote led by the association's chairwoman, Seema Kennedy, a future Member of Parliament who served as the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Immigration under Boris Johnson.

He lost his seat at the 2017 general election to Conservative Party candidate Jack Brereton. Early life Flello was born in Bournville, Birmingham. He attended Bournville Junior and Infant schools before going to King's Norton Boys' School. At age 18 he went to University of Wales, Bangor to read Chemistry. He graduated in 1987 with a B.Sc (Hons). Career After graduating, Flello worked for a short time at Cadbury in Bournville before joining the Inland Revenue. In 1989 he left to join Price Waterhouse accountants as a personal tax advisor. In 1995 he moved to Arthur Andersen. In 1999, he co-founded Platts Flello Limited, tax and financial advisors. In late 2003 he left to work as the CEO of Malachi Community Trust until December 2004. Political career Flello was elected as a councillor to the Longbridge ward of Birmingham City Council in 2002, stepping down in 2004. He is a former chairman of the Birmingham Northfield Constituency Labour Party. He served as a governor at the Newman College in Bartley Green, and was Chair of Governors for both Colmers Farm infants and junior schools. He was also a governor at The Meadows primary school. He served as a regional organiser for the Labour Party in 2004 until his election to Westminster. Parliament Flello was elected to the House of Commons at the 2005 general election for Stoke-on-Trent South following the retirement of George Stevenson. Flello held the seat with a majority of 8,681 and made his maiden speech on 19 May 2005.House of Commons Hansard Debates for 19 May 2005 (pt 20). Publications.parliament.uk (19 May 2005); retrieved 9 May 2015. In parliament he was a member of the Science and Technology Select Committee. While Labour were in government he served as Parliamentary Private Secretary first to the Lord Chancellor, Charles Falconer, Baron Falconer of Thoroton, then to the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, Hazel Blears, and finally after 2009 to the Secretary of State for Defence, Bob Ainsworth. In June 2016, Labour Party activists in Stoke-on-Trent South proposed a motion of no confidence in Flello after he called on Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to \\"do the decent thing and resign\\". He had supported Owen Smith in the failed attempt to replace Jeremy Corbyn in the 2016 Labour leadership election. In 2019 he defected to the Lib Dems and was selected as their parliamentary candidate for his old seat. 36 hours after his selection, however, the Lib Dems deselected Flello, citing \\"how greatly his values diverge from ours\\". It is believed that they objected to his socially conservative views on abortion and same-sex marriage. Social views Flello is a convert to Catholicism and stated in 2014 \\"I could no more leave my faith at the door of the House of Commons than I could my name or my gender or my arms and legs\\". He was a member of the anti-abortion All-Party Parliamentary Pro-Life Group. Flello also opposes same-sex marriage and was one of the few Labour MPs to vote against the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013, citing his religious views. Controversies In 2007 Flello was accused of filibustering a fellow Labour backbencher's private members bill. The bill, introduced by neighbouring Staffordshire MP Paul Farrelly, aimed to give temporary and agency workers similar employment rights to permanent staff. It was backed by the Unite trade union. The incident provoked an angry response in the Daily Mirror. In 2017, Flello blamed \\"shocking congestion\\" in London on the loss of tarmac from building cycle lanes, which received a critical response from bike charity the London Cycling Campaign and cycling website road.cc, both pointing out that tarmac had been repurposed to another form of transport and that the increased number of journeys overall in Central London were what was causing congestion, not the segregated cycle tracks that are on less than 1% of London roads.

Minney. The film, directed by Lewis Gilbert, is based on the true story of Special Operations Executive agent Violette Szabo, GC, who was captured and executed while serving in Nazi-occupied France. Szabo was played by Virginia McKenna. Plot Violette Bushell is a young woman whose father is English, and whose mother is French, living in London early in the Second World War. She meets French Army officer Etienne Szabo, stationed in the city, and they become engaged to be married. They have a daughter, Tania, but Etienne never sees the child, as he is killed fighting in the North African front; Violette Szabo and her daughter move into her parents' home. Because of her linguistic skills, the widowed Szabo is recruited as a spy by the Special Operations Executive (SOE) for operations in France. On her first mission, she is teamed with Captain Tony Fraser (Paul Scofield), a man she had met earlier socially and liked. She arrives by small plane in France, and shares a train compartment to Rouen with curious German soldiers. The French Resistance group Fraser had set up in Rouen has been betrayed. The job of the new arrivals is to contact any survivors and to blow up a major railway viaduct. One Resistance member who Szabo contacts tells her that another survivor, a garage mechanic (Andr√© Maranne), is suspect, but Szabo takes the risk of meeting him anyway. He informs her that only three of 98 group members remain. Nonetheless, she persuades him to try to blow up the viaduct. Szabo is picked up and questioned by the Gestapo. She is released, and meets in Paris with Fraser, who congratulates her: The viaduct was destroyed. They return to Britain, and Szabo reluctantly agrees to another mission. Once again, she is under Fraser's command, this time in the Limoges region. She sets out with a guide to contact the various Resistance units to coordinate their actions. She and her guide become involved in a firefight with German soldiers. They are outnumbered and they flee. Szabo injures her ankle, and she insists on remaining behind. She runs out of ammunition and is captured. Though tortured, she defiantly refuses to provide any information. Eventually she is reunited with two fellow women agents she had befriended during their initial training, Lilian Rolfe and Denise Bloch, in a Nazi prison. As Allied forces advance on Paris, the women are placed on a train for Germany. When the train is bombed by Allied aircraft, the women have a chance to attempt to escape, but Szabo instead fetches water for male prisoners. One of them is Fraser. That night, Szabo and Fraser acknowledge their love for each other. The men and women are separated. The three women are taken to a concentration camp, where they are executed. After the war, Tania and her grandparents go to Buckingham Palace, where King George VI gives the child her mother's posthumous George Cross. Afterwards, they meet Fraser.

Box office The film was one of the twelve most popular at the British box office in 1958. Kinematograph Weekly listed it as being \\"in the money\\" at the British box office in 1958. Award nominations *BAFTA Award for Best Actress ‚Äì Virginia McKenna The real Violette Szabo With her blonde hair and handsome angular features, Virginia McKenna bears no resemblance to the real Violette Szabo, a pretty if not ravishing brunette with dark eyes standing at less than 5 ft 5in tall.M. R. D. Foot, 'Szabo, Violette Reine Elizabeth (1921‚Äì1945)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004. McKenna gives Szabo a marked south London accent brushed with received pronunciation, her performance being in the tradition of the \\"stiff upper lipped\\" strictly class- structured heroine that would be anticipated by audiences in the atmosphere of a pre-Bond 1950s Britain.Sarah Helm, A Life in Secrets: The Story of Vera Atkins and the Lost Agents of SOE, Little, Brown and Company, 2005, p. 412. The film itself, released in 1958, does not show the full horror of Szabo's treatment in captivity, especially in Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp, or the true manner of her execution, but it gives a broad impression of her bravery and fortitude. Szabo was described in the citation to her posthumous George Cross as having shown a \\"magnificent example of courage and steadfastness\\", by her daughter, Tania, in the title of her 2007 book about her mother's missions, as \\"young, brave, and beautiful\\", and by fellow SOE agent, Odette Sansom, GC, who survived Ravensbr√ºck, as \\"the bravest of us all\\". Denise Bloch and Lilian Rolfe were fellow SOE agents, and were executed with Violette Szabo on 5 February 1945 in Ravensbr√ºck. Colonel Maurice Buckmaster was head of SOE F Section; Vera Atkins was his assistant and the section's intelligence officer, with special responsibility for female agents. Vera Atkins, Odette Sansom, and Leslie Fernandez, one of Szabo's SOE instructors and a field agent himself, were advisors on the film. The role played by Paul Scofield, Tony Fraser, was created for dramatic purposes, but is based upon Szabo's actual male colleague on her missions to France, and organiser of the Salesman circuit, Philippe Liewer ('Major Charles Staunton').M. R. D. Foot, 'Szabo, Violette Reine Elizabeth (1921‚Äì1945)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004. \\"The Life That I Have\\" The poem, \\"The Life That I Have\\", also known as \\"Yours\\", recited to Violette by her husband Etienne, was once believed to have been written especially for the film, but was in fact the actual code poem given to her in March 1944 by the SOE cryptographer Leo Marks, and written by him on Christmas Eve 1943 in memory of his girlfriend, Ruth, who had recently died in a plane crash. Marks, who became a scriptwriter after the war, would only let the poem be used on condition that his authorship was not revealed.

The South African Defence Force (SADF) comprised the South African armed forces from 1957 until 1994. Shortly before the state reconstituted itself as a republic in 1961, the former Union Defence Force was officially succeeded by the SADF, which was established by the Defence Act (No. 44) of 1957. The SADF, in turn, was superseded by the South African National Defence Force in 1994. The SADF was organised to perform a dual mission: to counter possible insurgency in all forms, and to maintain a conventional military arm which could defend the republic's borders, making retaliatory strikes as necessary. As the military expanded during the 1970s, the SADF general staff was organised into six sections‚Äîfinance, intelligence, logistics, operations, personnel, and planning; uniquely, the South African Medical Service (SAMS) was made co-equal with the South African Army, the South African Navy and the South African Air Force. The military was mostly composed of white South Africans, who alone were subject to conscription. However, black South Africans were the second largest group, and Asians and Coloured citizens with mixed ancestry were eligible to serve as volunteers, several attaining commissioned rank. From 1971 onwards, several black battalions were raised in the Infantry and Service Corps on a tribal basis, most Black soldiers serving in these exclusive tribal Battalions, which had black NCOs but white commissioned officers. The first black personnel were accepted into commissioned ranks only from 1986, and then only for serving black soldiers and NCOs. The regular Commission would not be open for Bantus until 1991, and then again they would serve only in black units or Support/Service Support units, to avoid having position of authority over white combat arms personnel. The first black officer to be promoted to Lieutenant Colonel rank and have command over a Battalion sized unit was only appointed in February 1994, by which time the old SADF was already on its deathbed. However, black officer candidates from the various Homeland Forces and from South West Africa/SWATF had been accepted since 1981 Units such as the 32 Battalion incorporated many black volunteers, as did the 101 Battalion. Conscription was opposed by organisations such as the End Conscription Campaign, but overall, white morale remained high‚Äîas indicated by the few recruits tried for serious disciplinary offences. During apartheid, armed SADF troops were used in quelling opposition to minority rule, often directly supporting the South African Police. South African military units were involved in the long-running Mozambican and Angolan civil wars, frequently supporting Pretoria's allies, the Mozambican National Resistance (RENAMO) and the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA). SADF personnel were also deployed during the related South African Border War. History SADF paratroops in training. Before 1957, the Union of South Africa had relied on small standing cadres for defence, expanding during wartime through the use of white conscripts. During the Second World War the Union Defence Force initially fielded only 3,353 full- time soldiers, with another 14,631 active in reserve roles. These troops were not prepared to fight in Europe proper, as they had hitherto been trained only in basic light infantry tactics and bush warfare. However, Jan Christiaan Smuts proved remarkably resourceful in raising 345,049 men for overseas operations; South African soldiers went on to distinguish themselves as far abroad as Italy and Egypt. After 1957, the new South African Defence Force was faced with a post-war upsurge in African nationalism, and forced to expand its resources accordingly. In 1963 its total strength stood at around 25,000 men. By 1977, the United Nations was imposing arms sanctions on the republic due to its controversial policy of racial apartheid.http://www.mpil.de/shared/data/pdf/pdfmpunyb/wood_2.pdf South Africa responded by developing a powerful domestic arms industry, capable of producing quality hardware, including jet fighters, drones, guided missiles, armoured cars, multiple rocket launchers, and small arms. SADF units fought in the Angolan Civil War during Operation Savannah and were also active alongside Rhodesian Security Forces during the Rhodesian Bush War. Although both campaigns were strategically unsuccessful, it was clearly proven that South Africa's military was immeasurably superior in strength and sophistication than all her African neighbours combined. Further enlargement and modernisation of the armed forces continued under former defence minister Pieter Willem Botha, who became state president in 1984. Shortly after Botha took office, the SADF numbered some 83,400 men (including 53,100 conscripts and 5,400 non-whites): one armoured brigade, one mechanised infantry brigade, four motorised brigades, one parachute brigade, a special reconnaissance regiment, one Marine brigade, twenty artillery regiments, supporting specialist units, a balanced air force, and a navy adequate for coastal protection in all. In addition, numerous auxiliary formations were trained as support units capable of occupying strategic border areas, including the predominantly Angolan 32 Battalion, Namibia's South West African Territorial Force, and several Bantustan militias. During Botha's term, the SADF began focusing on taking a more aggressive stance to the ongoing war against communist-supported nationalist guerrillas in South Africa and Namibia (then South West Africa) and targeting neighboring countries that offered them support. This was partially justified as a new structure intended to turn back a \\"total onslaught\\" on the republic from abroad. The post-colonial rise of newly independent black governments on the apartheid administration's doorstep created a perceived menace to the existing structure, and Pretoria's occupation of Namibia threatened to bring it into direct confrontation with the world community. On the ground, militant guerrilla movements such as the African National Congress (ANC), South West African People's Organisation (SWAPO) and the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania (PAC) challenged white supremacy with force of arms. In 1984, at least 6,000 such insurgents were being trained and armed by Tanzania, Ethiopia, the Soviet Union, and Warsaw Pact member states. In general the struggle went badly for South Africa's opponents. Mozambique provided support and shelter to ANC operatives; in retaliation South African units launched massive counterstrikes which the local security forces were in no position to block. Military aircraft and special forces units deployed across Zimbabwe, Botswana, Lesotho, and Zambia to attack suspected insurgent bases. 30,000 South African military personnel were posted on the Namibian border by late 1985, frequently crossing the frontier to battle SWAPO groups operating from southern Angola. SWAPO's MPLA allies, with the backing of the Cuban military, were often unable to protect them. These raids reflected the SADF's talent for combating rural insurgency. Major guerrilla camps were always chief targets, whether on foreign or domestic soil. Consequently, establishing good intelligence and effective assault strategy were commonly reflected in tactical priorities. The SADF's success eventually compelled SWAPO to withdraw over 200 miles from the Namibian border, forcing their insurgents to travel great distances across arid bush in order to reach their targets. Many could no longer carry heavy weapons on these treks, occasionally abandoning them as they marched south. Moreover, serious SWAPO losses were already having a negative effect on morale. ANC operations fared little better. Most high-profile terrorist attacks were foiled or offered negative publicity from a normally sympathetic international stage. While it was clear that popular support was growing and guerrilla skills were being improved upon, affrays on South Africa itself did not seriously disrupt the economy or impact the country's superior military and industrial status. By the fall of apartheid in 1991, the SADF was an uneven reflection of both the strengths and weaknesses of South Africa's white society at large. It employed many personnel with developed technical skills; thus, the military could more easily maintain and operate sophisticated hardware than black African forces drawn from underdeveloped regions. In an unusual contrast with Southern Africa's other white armies, the SADF had a stern sense of bureaucratic hierarchy. Commanders deferred to civilian supervisors and normally could not aspire to political power. The SADF's technical performance had also improved greatly, owing largely to realistic and efficient training procedures. The army in particular was skilled in both counterinsurgency warfare and conventional mechanised operations. In 1984, 11,000 infantrymen were even trained to execute blitzkrieg tactics. White soldiers were for the most part reasonably motivated; conscripts had a sense of defending their own country rather than some far-off foreign venture. Commissioned officers generally accepted in principle recruits of all colours, placed an emphasis on technical efficiency, and preferred to fight a foreign rather than domestic enemy despite extensive preparation for both. Integration As non-racial democracy was introduced to the republic in 1994, the SADF was amalgamated with the formerly independent Bantustan security forces, the ANC's Umkhonto we Sizwe, PAC's Azanian People's Liberation Army and the 'self-protection units' of the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) to form the South African National Defence Force.

According to Conservative Home Bone has \\"run both a public company and a family business.\\" In 1995, according to The Guardian, Bone was described as Britain's \\"meanest boss\\" by the Daily Mirror when he defended paying a 17-year-old trainee at Palm Travel (West) 87p an hour. By way of context, the average wage was over ¬£8 per hour in 1995. While appearing on the British satirical television programme Have I Got News for You, Bone, to laughter, said the Mirrors claim was \\"wholly correct\\" but pointed out that the wage in question was part of a \\"government training scheme\\", paying \\"¬£30 a week\\". Political career In 1978, Bone was elected as a councillor for the Blenheim ward on Southend-on- Sea Borough Council, where he served for eight years until 1986. He was elected as the Deputy Chairman of the Southend West Conservative Association in 1977 and continued in the position until 1984. In 1982, he became press secretary to the Conservative MP Paul Channon. He unsuccessfully contested the parliamentary seat of Islwyn in the South Wales valleys at the 1992 general election against the then Leader of the Opposition Neil Kinnock. He subsequently fought the European Parliament election in 1994 for Mid and West Wales coming third and suffering a swing against his party of 7.5%. Bone was a member of the National Union Executive Committee between 1993 until 1996. He was chosen for the seemingly safe Conservative seat of Pudsey following the retirement of the veteran MP Giles Shaw at the 1997 general election but lost following a swing of 13.20% to the Labour's Paul Truswell, compared to a national swing of 10% from Conservative to Labour. In the 2001 general election he fought the ultra-marginal seat of Wellingborough, where the sitting Labour MP Paul Stinchcombe was holding on with a majority of just 187, having defeated the veteran Tory MP Peter Fry in 1997. Stinchcombe held on to his seat by 2,355, a swing of 2.1% to Labour compared with a national swing of 1.75% to the Conservatives. However, four years later, in the 2005 general election, Bone ousted Stinchcombe in Wellingborough with a majority of 687 votes, a swing of 2.9% compared to a national swing of 3.1% to the Conservatives. He made his maiden speech on 7 June 2005. Early on in his career he was described as one of the most active MPs in Parliament, in terms of Questions asked and other contributions. However, the quality of those interventions was questioned in a 2006 article in The Times about the Theyworkforyou website. Bone was one of three MPs specifically alleged to have \\"boosted their ratings on the internet by saying very little, very often.\\" Among his 109 speeches was one which ran to three short sentences (standing up for Royal Mail in that a sub-postmaster in Little Irchester had the only business in the village). He regularly referenced his then wife \\"Mrs Bone\\" in questions to the Prime Minister's Questions. Bone is a member of the 1922 Committee and was an executive member from 2007 to 2012. In April 2012, The Daily Telegraph reported that the modernising \\"301 Group\\" was planning a coup to replace Bone and others. Bone was voted off the executive in May 2012. In March 2009, Bone was one of the key speakers opposing the use of the House of Commons by the UK Youth Parliament, having been appointed one of the Tellers. Although Bone was not mentioned in the 2009 Legg Report that was central to the official investigation into the United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal and therefore was not one of the 343 MPs required to pay back any money, he was subject to some later controversies relating to his expenses. He was one of 32 MPs who claimed the maximum allowance of ¬£4,800 a year for food in 2010 and came under investigation in 2014 for expenses claims relating to the upkeep of his second home. In 2016 he was reported to be one of 26 MPs who had expenses debts of up to ¬£500 written off after failing to pay them by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority and in 2016 was criticised for using the government's help-to-buy scheme, which was meant to help young first time buyers, to buy himself a new constituency home. Bone proposed a bill in July 2013, arguing that the August Bank Holiday should be renamed to Margaret Thatcher Day to commemorate her premiership. The bill ran out of time, due to filibustering by Labour MPs and formally ended its passage through Parliament in 2014. Bone was frequently critical of the Coalition Government between the Conservative Party and the Liberal Democrats and is rated as one of the Conservatives' most rebellious MPs. In February 2014, The Times newspaper reported that Bone had been under investigation by the Police for the previous 12 months relating to an alleged ¬£100,000 fraud concerning benefit payments of care home fees for his mother-in-law. Bone issued a lengthy statement denying fraud allegations.\\"In full: Wellingborough and Rushden MP Peter Bone‚Äôs statement denying fraud allegations\\" Northants Telegraph In March 2014 the Crown Prosecution Service said it had concluded that there was insufficient evidence to bring criminal charges. In the 2015 general election, he increased his majority by 1,347 achieving 52.1% of the votes cast. And was re-elected again in the 2017 general election. In February 2018, following the announcement that Northamptonshire County Council had brought in a \\"section 114\\" notice, putting it in special measures following a crises in its finances, Bone was one of seven local MPs who released a statement arguing that the problems with the authority were down to mismanagement from the Conservative councillors who led it rather than funding cuts from the Conservative Government. They further argued that government commissioners should take over the running of the Council. In Parliament, he serves on the Procedure Committee, the Committee on Exiting the European Union and the Panel of Chairs. He has previously been a member of the Trade and Industry Select Committee, the Health Select Committee, the Backbench Business Committee, the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments and the Commons Committee on Statutory Instruments. Before they separated, Bone employed his wife, Jennie, as his executive secretary. In 2007‚Äì2008 he paid her \\"in the top bracket of up to ¬£40,000\\" per annum. The practice of MPs employing family members has been criticised by some sections of the media as nepotism. Although MPs who were first elected in 2017 have been banned from employing family members, the restriction is not retrospective ‚Äì meaning that Bone's employment of his wife was lawful. In June 2018, Bone defended fellow Conservative MP Christopher Chope after he was widely criticised for blocking a government-backed bid to make it illegal to take photos of people aimed up their skirts. Bone argued that Chope was \\"a great parliamentarian and public servant\\". Political views Bone is regarded as being on the right wing of the Conservative Party, and is a member of the socially conservative Cornerstone Group. He has suggested major constitutional changes such as abolition of the Whips office and confirmation of new Cabinet appointees. His criticisms of the NHS include a 2007 report in which he argued that it \\"would not be out of place in Stalin's Russia\\". He has voted to lower the abortion time limit to twelve weeks and voted against abolishing the offences of blasphemy and blasphemous libel. He has urged the Charity Commission to award the tax breaks of registration to any legal faith group. The abortion time limit vote failed, the blasphemy vote passed, and tax breaks were not awarded. Bone opposed the introduction of the National Minimum Wage, which he claimed would \\"condemn hundreds of thousands to the dole queue\\", and later backed a private member's bill tabled by his colleague Christopher Chope proposing to enable employees to opt out of the minimum wage. Bone described government proposals to introduce same-sex marriage rights as \\"completely nuts\\". He subsequently voted against the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013. In 2013, Bone was one of four MPs who camped outside Parliament in a move to facilitate parliamentary debate on what they called an \\"Alternative Queen's Speech\\" ‚Äì an attempt to show what a future Conservative government might deliver. 42 policies were listed including reintroduction of the death penalty and conscription, privatizing the BBC, banning the burka in public places and preparation to leave the European Union. The Daily Telegraph believes the whips sent Edward Leigh to try to persuade the group not to table the amendments. Bone blamed the Liberal Democrats for tying David Cameron's hands. A prominent Eurosceptic, Bone has often been named as a potential defector to the United Kingdom Independence Party. Bone described UKIP's emergence as a \\"good thing for British politics\\", and criticised his own party for \\"neglecting\\" the views of traditional Conservatives on other issues such as immigration, but said he intended to campaign for withdrawal from the EU from within the Conservative Party. Bone is a director of Grassroots Out and was a director of the now dissolved Go Movement Limited with Nigel Farage and Tom Pursglove. In 2009, Bone said: \\"We have gone from having one of the best health services in the Western world to arguably the worst\\", which had \\"centralised and Stalinist management\\". In March 2019, Bone was one of 21 MPs who voted against LGBT inclusive sex and relationship education in English schools. In September 2019, Bone expressed his beliefs that a general election would be a \\"good thing\\" and a necessary step in order to establish a \\"Conservative government with a majority\\" and prevent a no-deal Brexit. Bone also protested against a motion to debate attempts to stop Boris Johnson from taking the United Kingdom out of the European Union without a deal. Bone has also criticised his fellow Conservative party members for refusing to support Boris Johnson's victory in the leadership race for a Prime Minister. Despite winning the vote, 21 Conservative MPs voted against him, a move which Bone has criticised, according to the Daily Express. Bone has been quoted saying that Boris Johnson would be an \\"excellent prime minister and get a proper Brexit deal and lead us to victory in the next general election\\". Personal life Bone primarily lives in London, but also owns a flat in the Denington Estate (formally John Lea School site) in Wellingborough. He married Jeanette Sweeney in 1981; together they had two sons and a daughter. Bone separated from his wife, who is a Conservative Councillor in the Borough of Wellingborough and his Executive Secretary, in 2016 and is now in a relationship with physiotherapist Helen Harrison, who is now his new Executive Secretary. Bone played cricket as a left-arm bowler for Cambridge Methodists Cricket Club in Leeds, and has tweeted in the past of his matches playing with Wellingborough Old Grammarians 3rd XI, despite not actually being a member of the club. Bone has also played cricket as a member of a Parliamentarians team, alongside Crispin Blunt and Hugh Robertson. He is an active member of the Church of England and attends St Mary's Church in Rushden, as well as holding constituency surgeries in the church hall.

Afriye in 1999 worked for Jeffrey Archer on his unsuccessful campaign to be the first directly elected Mayor of London. Afriyie was selected as parliamentary candidate for the constituency of Windsor in October 2003. He was first elected at the 2005 general election, with an increased share of the vote (49.5%) and a swing to the Conservatives of 1.2%. He is the Conservative Party's first mixed-race MP, although he said in an interview with the Evening Standard that he considers himself not as black but \\"post-racial\\". In the election of 2010, Afriyie was re elected, with an increased share of the vote (60.8%) and a swing to the Conservatives of 11.4%. He made his maiden speech on 23 May 2005. In Parliament, he was a member of the Science and Technology Select Committee from 2005, until its abolition in July 2007, and has since been a member of the Children, Schools and Families select committee. Since 2010, he has been the President of the Conservative Technology Forum. He has been the chair of the Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology since 2010. Afriyie voted against the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill, citing his fear for religious freedom, and also that he thought that straight civil partnerships should be allowed, but the Bill did not. In November 2013, Afriyie proposed an amendment to the European Union (Referendum) Bill 2013‚Äì14, to force an early vote for an early referendum on membership of the European Union, against the express wishes of his party. He continued to advocate an early referendum after his rebel amendment was easily defeated in the House of Commons with just 6% of the vote, citing public support for such a move. In December 2014, Afriyie along with six other Conservative Party MPs voted against the Equal Pay (Transparency) Bill, which would require all companies with more than 250 employees to declare the gap in pay between the average male and average female salaries. He was mooted as a possible candidate for a challenge to David Cameron for leadership of the Conservative Party, but there was little support within the party for a leadership challenge or Afriyie as a potential candidate.

Her works have sold 50 million copies internationally. Biography Tourtel was born Mary Caldwell, the youngest child of Samuel Caldwell, a stained-glass artist and stonemason, and his wife Sarah. Mary studied art under Thomas Sidney Cooper at the Sidney Cooper School of Art in Canterbury (now the University for the Creative Arts), and became a children's book illustrator. In 1900 she married an assistant editor of The Daily Express, Herbert Bird Tourtel, at Eton.The Life and Works of Alfred Bestall: Illustrator of Rupert Bear, 2010, Caroline Bott289x289px Rupert Bear was created in 1920, at a time when the Express was in competition with The Daily Mail and its then popular comic strip Teddy Tail, as well as the strip Pip, Squeak and Wilfred in The Daily Mirror. The then news editor of the Express, Herbert Tourtel, was approached with the task of producing a new comic strip to rival those of the Mail and Mirror and immediately thought of his wife Mary, already an established author and artist. Rupert Bear was the result and was first published as a nameless character in a strip titled Little Lost Bear on 8 November 1920. The early strips were illustrated by Mary and captioned by her husband, often in poetry and were published as two cartoons a day with a short story underneath. Rupert was originally a brown bear until the Express cut inking expenses giving him his iconic and characteristic white colour. Mary‚Äôs Rupert was more like a real bear, with a lumbering gait and more fur. The vibrant red and yellow clothing of contemporary Rupert was originally a soft blue jumper with grey trousers. Mary stopped drawing Rupert in 1935 when her eyesight started failing. In 1931 Herbert Tourtel died in a German sanatorium, and Mary retired four years later in 1935 after her eyesight and general health deteriorated. The Rupert Bear strips were continued by a Punch illustrator, Alfred Bestall. Mary lived most of her life in different hotels, never finding a fixed home as she preferred the freedom of travel. Mary Tourtel died on 15 March 1948, aged 74, at the Kent and Canterbury Hospital, a week after she collapsed in Canterbury High Street from a brain tumour. She was buried with her husband at St Martin's Church, Canterbury; they had no children but travelled the world together. In 2003, the Canterbury Heritage Museum, which closed in 2018, opened a special wing dedicated to Rupert Bear. There is now a Rupert display case in the Beaney House of Art and Knowledge, alongside the Clangers. Bibliography=Rupert series The complete listing may be found at Rupert Little Bear Library.

It is a minimalist film about a man who drives through a city suburb, in search of someone who can carry out the task of burying him after he commits suicide. It was awarded the Palme d'Or at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival, which it shared with The Eel. Plot summary Mr Badii (Homayoun Ershadi), a middle-aged man, drives through Tehran looking for someone to do a job for him, and he offers a large amount of money in return. During his drives with prospective candidates, Badii reveals that he plans to kill himself and has already dug the grave. He needs someone to throw earth on his body, after his death. He does not discuss why he wants to commit suicide. His first recruit is a young, shy Kurdish soldier, who refuses to do the job and flees from Badii's car. His second recruit is an Afghan seminarist, who also declines because he has religious objections to suicide. The third is an Azeri taxidermist. He is willing to help Badii because he needs the money for his sick child, but tries to talk him out of it; he reveals that he too wanted to commit suicide a long time ago but chose to live when he tasted mulberries. The Azeri promises to throw earth on Badii if he finds him dead in the morning. That night, Badii lies in his grave while a thunderstorm begins. After a long blackout, the film ends by breaking the fourth wall with camcorder footage of Kiarostami and the film crew filming Taste of Cherry. Cast * Homayoun Ershadi as Mr. Badii * Abdolrahman Bagheri as Mr. Bagheri, the taxidermist * Afshin Khorshid Bakhtiari as Worker * Safar Ali Moradi as Soldier * Mir Hossein Noori as Seminarian Style The consistent close up of the character Badii (Homayoun Ershadi) in Taste of Cherry is later juxtaposed by a panoramic overhead view as his car moves across the hills The film is minimalist in that it is shot primarily with long takes; the pace is leisurely and there are long periods of ambient (background) sound, which the closing sequence shows the crew recording. Mr. Badii is rarely shown in the same shot as the person he is talking to (this is partly because during the filming, director Kiarostami was sitting in the car's passenger seat). Music The film does not include a background score, except for the ending titles. This features a trumpet piece, Louis Armstrong's 1929 adaptation of \\"St. James Infirmary Blues.\\" The only song featured in the film is \\"Khuda Bowad Yaret\\" (May God be your protector) by Afghan singer Ahmad Zaher, which is played in the background on a radio about 38 minutes into the film Release Taste of Cherry was awarded the prestigious Palme d'Or at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival in the year of its release, tied with Shohei Imamura's The Eel. Reception When the film was released in the United States, however, it met with a split reaction among critics and audiences. Roger Ebert wrote a scathing review in The Chicago Sun-Times, giving the film a mere 1 out of 4 stars. Ebert dismissed the film as \\"excruciatingly boring\\" and added, > \\"I understand intellectually what Kiarostami is doing. I am not impatiently > asking for action or incident. What I do feel, however, is that Kiarostami's > style here is an affectation; the subject matter does not make it necessary, > and is not benefited by it. If we're to feel sympathy for Badhi, wouldn't it > help to know more about him? To know, in fact, anything at all about him? > What purpose does it serve to suggest at first he may be a homosexual? (Not > what purpose for the audience--what purpose for Badhi himself? Surely he > must be aware his intentions are being misinterpreted.) And why must we see > Kiarostami's camera crew--a tiresome distancing strategy to remind us we are > seeing a movie? If there is one thing Taste of Cherry does not need, it is > such a reminder: The film is such a lifeless drone that we experience it > only as a movie.\\" Ebert later went on to add the film to a list of his most hated movies of all time. In his own review of Kiarostami's film, critic Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader awarded it a full four stars. Responding to Ebert's criticisms, Rosenbaum wrote: > \\"A colleague who finds Taste of Cherry \\"excruciatingly boring\\" objects in > particular to the fact that we don‚Äôt know anything about Badii, to what he > sees as the distracting suggestion that Badii might be a homosexual looking > for sex, and to what he sees as the tired \\"distancing strategy\\" of reminding > us at the end that we‚Äôre seeing a movie. From the perspective of the history > of commercial Western cinema, he has a point on all three counts.

In 1802, the linden leaf was used in the seal of the administration of the Canton of Fricktal. Schupfart used argent a linden leaf vert as municipal coat of arms from 1873. Since 1997, the same coat of arms is unofficially used to represent Fricktal.Gerry Thoenen, Der Fricktaler Wappenstreit (2013). The Fricktal (\\"Frick Valley\\") is a region on Northwestern Switzerland, comprising the Laufenburg and Rheinfelden districts of the Swiss canton of Aargau. The region was known as Frickgau in the medieval period, ultimately from a Late Latin , in reference to the iron mine located here in the Roman era, also transferred to the village of Frick as the main settlement.ortsnamen.ch Frickgau was part of Breisgau within Further Austria in the early modern period. It was joined to Switzerland only during the Napoleonic period. It now forms a northwestern extension to the canton of Aargau to the east of Basel, between the High Rhine forming the border with Germany in the north and the Jura Mountains in the south. History In the Early Middle Ages, Fricktal formed part of the Alemannic Augstgau between the Rhine and Aar rivers, from the 10th century onwards of the smaller Frickgau region within Upper Burgundy, owned by the Counts of Homberg-Thierstein in the 11th and 12th centuries. The western Fricktal was held by the Burgundian Lords of Rheinfelden, their last scion Rudolf of Rheinfelden became Duke of Swabia in 1057 and upon his death in 1080 his possessions passed to his son in law Berthold II from the House of Z√§hringen. After the extinction of the line in 1218, the area eventually passed to the Counts of Habsburg, who already held the Vogtei of Laufenburg. After the Habsburg dynasty had lost large parts of its original Swabian possessions south of the Rhine to the Swiss Confederacy at the 1386 Battle of Sempach, the remaining Fricktal was administered from the Oberamt Breisgau of Further Austria (Vorder√∂sterreich) at Freiburg, while the adjacent Unteraargau region to the south was finally conquered by the Swiss at Bern in 1415. In 1469 the indebted Archduke Sigismund of Further Austria sold the Breisgau with Fricktal to the Burgundian Duke Charles the Bold, nevertheless upon Charles' death in 1477 it reverted to Archduke Maximilian I of Habsburg by marriage with the duke's daughter Mary the Rich. In the early 18th century, the citizens of Bern attempted to purchase Fricktal from the Habsburg Emperors without success. Subsequent to the 1797 Treaty of Campo Formio, France occupied Fricktal, and in 1802 it was briefly a canton of the Helvetic Republic, as the Canton of Fricktal. On 9 March 1803, Fricktal was integrated into the Aargau canton of the Swiss Confederation by order of Napoleon. Fricktal, with its mild climate, is an important location for wine and cherry production as well as a base of the chemical and pharmaceutical industries.

Its rank is called the Picard number. It is named after Francesco Severi and Andr√© N√©ron. Definition In the cases of most importance to classical algebraic geometry, for a complete variety V that is non-singular, the connected component of the Picard scheme is an abelian variety written :Pic0(V). The quotient :Pic(V)/Pic0(V) is an abelian group NS(V), called the N√©ron‚ÄìSeveri group of V. This is a finitely- generated abelian group by the N√©ron‚ÄìSeveri theorem, which was proved by Severi over the complex numbers and by N√©ron over more general fields. In other words, the Picard group fits into an exact sequence :1\\\\to \\\\mathrm{Pic}^0(V)\\\\to\\\\mathrm{Pic}(V)\\\\to \\\\mathrm{NS}(V)\\\\to 0 The fact that the rank is finite is Francesco Severi's theorem of the base; the rank is the Picard number of V, often denoted œÅ(V). The elements of finite order are called Severi divisors, and form a finite group which is a birational invariant and whose order is called the Severi number. Geometrically NS(V) describes the algebraic equivalence classes of divisors on V; that is, using a stronger, non-linear equivalence relation in place of linear equivalence of divisors, the classification becomes amenable to discrete invariants. Algebraic equivalence is closely related to numerical equivalence, an essentially topological classification by intersection numbers. First Chern class and integral valued 2-cocycles The exponential sheaf sequence :0\\\\to 2\\\\pi i\\\\mathbb Z \\\\to \\\\mathcal O_V\\\\to\\\\mathcal O_V^*\\\\to 0 gives rise to a long exact sequence featuring :\\\\cdots \\\\to H^1(V, \\\\mathcal O_V^*)\\\\to H^2(V, \\\\mathbb Z)\\\\to H^2(V,\\\\mathcal O_V)\\\\to \\\\cdots. The first arrow is the first Chern class on the Picard group :c_1 : \\\\mathrm {Pic}(V)\\\\to H^2(V, \\\\mathbb Z), and the second :\\\\exp^* : H^2(V, 2i\\\\pi \\\\mathbb Z)\\\\to H^2(V,\\\\mathcal O_V). The Neron- Severi group can be identified with the image of the first Chern class, or equivalently, by exactness, as the kernel of the second arrow exp*. In the complex case, the Neron-Severi group is therefore the group of 2-cocycles whose Poincar√© dual is represented by a complex hypersurface, that is, a Weil divisor. References * *A.

He has been the Member of Parliament (MP) for The Wrekin in Shropshire since the 2005 general election. Early life and Career Pritchard was born on 22 November 1966. He was brought up and educated in Herefordshire. He remarked on BBC Radio 4 that he comes from an \\"unorthodox background\\" for a Conservative MP. For the first five years of his life he was brought up in an orphanage in Hereford, and later grew up in foster care living in a council house. He told his local newspaper that his early years were years of \\"love and warmth\\" and that he did not have \\"a single bad memory\\" of his time in the orphanage. Pritchard was first elected for the Conservative Party as a councillor on Harrow Council in London. Under his former name of Mark Mallon, he was elected as the Conservative Party candidate at a by-election for Pinner West ward in January 1993, but lost his seat at the council elections in May 1994, coming fifth. A supporter of Margaret Thatcher, Pritchard worked as the campaign manager to her successor in the London seat of Finchley, Hartley Booth, who served in Parliament between 1992 and 1997. Pritchard, under his previous name Mallon, co-wrote a book with Booth on the subject of long-term unemployment and homelessness, which they self-published in 1994, shortly after Booth resigned as a parliamentary private secretary following press revelations of a relationship with a House of Commons researcher. After working for Hartley Booth, Pritchard spent a brief period at Conservative Central Office, working as a press officer, in the 1997 General Election campaign. He went on to set up his own business and was elected as a Conservative councillor in Surrey on Woking Borough Council, for the Brookwood ward, in May 2000. He did not defend his seat at the end of his term in 2004. Parliamentary career Pritchard unsuccessfully contested the constituency of Warley in the West Midlands for the Conservative Party in the 2001 general election where he was defeated by John Spellar of the Labour party. Pritchard was first elected to parliament for The Wrekin constituency in 2005, defeating Peter Bradley, the incumbent Labour MP, by just 942 votes although this represented a 5.4% swing from Labour to Conservative. He was one of 130 candidates who received help from 20,000 countryside campaigners from the Countryside Party who \\"poured into marginal seats all over Britain\\" in an attempt to unseat anti-hunting Labour MPs. During the campaign pro-hunt supporters \\"delivered 3.4 million leaflets, addressed 2.1 million envelopes, put up 55,000 posters and provided 170,000 hours of campaigning.\\" Pritchard was also one of 30 Conservative MPs who benefited from large \\"below the radar\\" donations paid to candidates from a secret Conservative Party donors' fund set up by Lord Ashcroft, Lord Steinberg and the Midlands Industrial Council. After retaining his seat at the 2010 general election, he was joint secretary of the 1922 Committee between 2010 and 2012. Pritchard was at the centre of a political story in 2010 when he had a public confrontation with John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, who had told him to stand aside in a corridor. Pritchard then told him, \\"You are not fucking royalty, Mr Speaker!\\" Pritchard was appointed by Prime Minister David Cameron as a member of the Joint Committee on the National Security Strategy 2010‚Äì2015. He was appointed by Foreign Secretary, William Hague to the NATO Parliamentary Assembly 2005‚Äì2010. He was a Member of the House of Commons Joint Committee on Human Rights 2015‚Äì2017. He is a graduate of the Armed Forces Parliamentary Scheme (Army). He has visited Iraq and Afghanistan. Pritchard was appointed to the post of deputy chairman of the Conservative Party's International Office in 2010 but resigned in January 2012 over policy differences on: \\"a lack of national and individual aspiration, immigration, and Europe\\" ‚Äì what some commentators called \\"the Holy Trinity of the Conservative right\\". He is the vice-chairman of the Conservative Parliamentary Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee. He formerly served as 'backbench support' to William Hague and to Dr Liam Fox, the former Defence Secretary, whilst in opposition. In November 2013, Pritchard was subject to a series of articles in The Daily Telegraph regarding revelations from undercover investigations that he had offered to use his political contacts to set up business deals with foreign officials and ministers in return for being paid hundreds of thousands of pounds. Following the revelations Pritchard referred himself to the Standards Commissioner. Kathryn Hudson, the Standards Commissioner, subsequently announced that she would not investigate Pritchard, because there was \\"insufficient evidence\\", although the Daily Telegraph protested that the Commissioner has failed to contact the newspaper for its evidence. Pritchard maintained that he had not broken the Code of Conduct and that his business contacts were unconnected to his parliamentary work. In December 2014, he was arrested and later bailed over an allegation of rape. On 6 January 2015, the police inquiry was dropped on the basis that there was insufficient evidence for a case to proceed. Pritchard urged a review of the law on anonymity for people accused of rape, saying that it was unfair that he was publicly identified whilst his accuser remained anonymous. He was appointed by Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond as a member of the British delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, a 47-nation body ‚Äì separate to the EU ‚Äì which upholds human rights, democracy and the rule of law, from 2014 to 2017. In January 2017, it was reported that an inquiry had been launched into all-party parliamentary groups amid concerns they were being used to bypass lobbying rules. Pritchard was singled out in reports as the parliamentarian who sits on the most APPGs, with membership of 41 separate groups. In December 2017, UK Prime Minister, Theresa May, appointed him to be the Leader of the UK's delegation to the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). Also in 2017, he was appointed as the UK's first Trade Envoy to Georgia and Armenia working with the Department for International Trade. In the House of Commons he sits on the Panel of Chairs. Pritchard has served on several select committees: Transport, Works & Pensions, Wales, and Environmental Audit. He is chairman or vice-chairman of several all-party parliamentary groups, including the ASEAN region, and Africa. Pritchard is also an executive member of the British Parliamentary Group. In 2015, Pritchard succeeded Michael Connarty MP as the joint-chairman of the All Party Parliamentary Jazz Appreciation Group Although a eurosceptic, Pritchard supported the official position of his party and campaigned for the United Kingdom to remain in the European Union before the EU membership referendum on 23 June 2016. Since the result was announced, Pritchard has continued to support the party leadership and now advocates leaving the European Union. He has never rebelled against the Government in the current Parliament. In March 2018, he was one of three MPs accused of using threatening and intimidating behaviour towards parliamentary clerks. An investigation by the BBC claimed Pritchard used foul language in an exchange with a clerk and was known for having a bad temper. He responded that \\"there was no truth in the claims whatsoever\\", saying that he never used foul language and had never had a complaint levelled against him. Pritchard previously employed his wife as his Office Manager on a salary up to ¬£45,000. The practice of MPs employing family members has been criticised by some sections of the media on the lines that it promotes nepotism. He is Director of Mark Pritchard Advisory Ltd, a consultancy, from which he earns an annual income of over ¬£65,000. Additional employment for MPs as consultants has been criticised and his Labour Party opponents have called for the practice to be outlawed, but it is currently legal. Political positions Regarded as right of centre, he believes in tougher sentences for criminals ‚Äì but has also supported the coalition government's efforts to increase the number of treatment and rehabilitation centres. He is on record as saying he would not support the restoration of the death penalty and has served as the Joint Chairman of the All Party Group for the Abolition of the Death Penalty since 2012. His main political contributions focus on defence, foreign affairs, counter-terrorism, home affairs, anti-abortion and animal welfare issues. Same-sex marriage Pritchard is not in favour of gay marriage, having voted against this on several occasions. Animal welfare Pritchard is known for his advocacy of animal welfare issues and introduced three animal welfare related private Ten Minute Rule Bills in the period 2006‚Äì09. These were the Sale of Endangered Animals on the Internet (Prohibition) Bill, 2006; Primates As Pets (Prohibition) Bill, 2007 and the Common Birds (Protection) Bill, 2009. In June 2011 he successfully moved a motion to ban wild animals in circuses. In the House of Commons he stated that he had been placed under pressure by the prime minister to withdraw the motion, first by being offered a job, and then by being threatened. Pritchard has been nominated for numerous animal welfare awards including the Dods Charity Champion Award for Animal Welfare. Europe Pritchard is a Eurosceptic, defining himself as a \\"mainstream Eurosceptic\\". He was one of the \\"Tory Rebels\\" who oversaw the largest post-war defeat of any Conservative government concerning a European Referendum. In 2011, he called for an \\"in/out referendum\\" on the European Union. Central to Pritchard's argument was that \\"The majority of Britons living today have never had a say on Europe\\". Pritchard referred to this group as \\"the great disenfranchised\\". Pritchard supported the motion calling for a \\"real terms cut\\" in the EU's multi-annual budget in 2012. He was joined by fellow Eurosceptic MP, Mark Reckless, to draft the so-called 'Reckless- Pritchard amendment' which saw David Cameron's government defeated over the issue. Reckless later defected to Ukip. Pritchard said that the vote would \\"strengthen David Cameron's hand in Brussels\\". Pritchard has also been outspoken on immigration issues, being one of the co-signatories of an amendment calling for the extension UK border controls for Romanians and Bulgarians beyond 1 January 2014. He also held a debate on the issue in April 2013. On 31 January 2016, Pritchard declared himself a \\"reluctant inner\\", supporting Britain's membership of the EU. In the 2016 referendum on the UK's membership of the EU Pritchard campaigned for a Remain vote. He set out a number of security and foreign policy concerns in an article in The Sunday Times. Pro-Life Pritchard is registered as the vice-chairman of the all- party parliamentary Pro-Life Group. He was the mover of an amendment to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008 in the 2005‚Äì2010 parliament, which sought to reduce the term-limit for abortions from 24 weeks to 16 weeks. Personal life In July 2013, Mark Pritchard announced that he was divorcing his wife of 15 years, Sondra, following their separation in April 2013. Pritchard has several business interests outside of politics, with commitments to some 55 hours of non-parliamentary duties each month.

The Santa Justa Lift, as seen from the Pra√ßa D.Pedro IV Sacramento View of Castelo de S√£o Jorge and Rua de Santa Justa from the observation deck above the lift The hills of Lisbon have always presented a problem for travel between the lower streets of the main Baixa and the higher Largo do Carmo (Carmo Square)., In order to facilitate the movement between the two, the civil and military engineer Roberto Arm√©nio presented a project to the Lisbon municipal council in 1874. A similar project was suggested in 1876, that included rail-lines that would be pulled by animals up an inclined plane. In May 1882 founder and representative of the Companhia dos Ascensores Mec√¢nicos de Lisboa, Raoul Mesnier du Ponsard, petitioned the city council for permission to explore alternative plans for constructing an inclined transport moved by mechanical means. On 1 June 1882, Mesnier, a Porto-born engineer of French parentage, was granted a licence to proceed. In 1896 Mesnier petitioned for the concession of this project, in order to establish the Escadinhas de Santa Justa, a request that was contested by Henry Lusseau. At the same time, the Servi√ßos de Obras da C√¢mara (Municipal Public Services) supported Mesnier's petition, and the concession to authorize the construction and exploration of the Raoul Mesnier du Ponsard Elevator was approved. It took two years to receive a provisional license to construct the structure. In 1899, the Empresa do Elevador do Carmo (Company of the Elevator of Carmo) was founded (constituted by principal partners Raoul Mesnier du Ponsard, medical surgeon Jo√£o Silvestre de Almeida and the Marquess of Praia e Monforte, Ant√≥nio Borges de Medeiros Dias da C√¢mara e Sousa) in order to secure the permanent concession of the elevator project for a period of 99 years. In 1900, the formal contract was signed between the Municipal Council of Lisbon and the Empresa do Elevador do Carmo (extinct in 1939), on which the working group was obligated to present a project for an elevator in a period of six months; planning on the construction had already begun with the Lisbon branch of the metal constructors Cardoso D'Argent & Cia. (founded in 1897), on Rua Da Junqueira. The founder, Manuel Cardoso, had already been placed in charge of the offices of firm Empresa Industrial Portuguesa and was responsible for the workers in the Elevador de Santa Justa project. By the middle of the year, the land that would be the main site was already in movement, establishing the footings and equipment house (2 June of the same year). On 31 August 1901, King Carlos inaugurated the metal bridge and awning, in a ceremony that included members of the royal family, the members of the elevator company, Raoul Mesnier du Ponsard, and various members of the nobility and journalists. Its initial operation was delayed: the operating car was only inaugurated in 1902 in the presence of the managing director of the concessionary company, Dr. Silvestre de Almeida, accompanied by journalists and other invited guests, in a ceremony presided over by the Secretary-General of the Civil Government. The operating concession was given to the company Lisbon Electric Tramway Ltd. in 1905. Originally powered by steam, the lift was converted to electrical operation in 1907 by the British company R. Waygood,https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:R1033594crw_(7955376856).jpg and the respective concessionary company bought the Elevator in 1913, from the Empresa do Elevador do Carmo. Republic In 1943, the Lisbon Electric Tramway Ltd. solicited the city council to authorize the transfer of the elevator to the Companhia da Carris. The process was approved, with the condition that its operation should be integrated into the transport network, with the Companhia da Carris as the principal. By 1973, a contract was signed between the municipal council of Lisbon, the Companhia da Carris and the Lisbon Electric Tramway Ltd., transferring the Elevator definitively into the city's historical tram network. In July 2002, the Santa Justa Elevator celebrated its first centenary; along with the three remaining cable railways of Lavra, Gl√≥ria and Bica, they were all classified as National Monuments in the same year. After remodelling and renovation, the elevator walkway was reopened in February 2006 for the general public and tourists. Architecture The lift as seen from Rua de Santa Justa The terrace and walkway of the lift, with observation deck Santa Justa Lift engines The lift is included on the historical guides of Lisbon, within the down-town Pombaline Baixa area between several older historical buildings in the quarter. It is situated in the Escadinhas de Santa Justa which connects the Baixa to the Rua do Carmo. The Escadinhas are actually part of the north-eastern urban wall of the Baixa and west of the Rua de Santa de Justa. The elevator gives access to many of the important zones of the city. To the north, towards the Rossio (Pra√ßa D. Pedro IV and Avenida da Liberdade); to the south, the (Terreiro do Pa√ßo) Pra√ßa do Com√©rcio and the river zone; while in the upper zone, there is access to the Largo do Carmo, the Trindade, Church of S√£o Roque and the Bairro Alto quarter. In addition, the panoramic views allow glimpses of the Castle of S√£o Jorge, the Tagus River, the lower part of the Baixa, the National Theatre D. Maria II, while the upper entrance permits a view of the ruins of the Monastery of Nossa Senhora do Vencimento do Monte do Carmo. The elevator is a vertical structure, developed along the Rua de Santa Justa, consisting of a metal tower, observation platform, walkway and base. Its base includes four vertical columns, each composed of two pillars. The largest part of the structure runs parallel to the Rua de Santa Justa. With a height of 45 metres, covering seven stories, the tower includes two elevator cabins, decorated in wood, mirrors and windows, and with an initial capacity for 24 passengers in each (updated to 29 people later). The structure includes a dozen transverse beams, forming a double lattice, supported at the top by foundations at the Escadinhas de Santa Justa. On the sides of the elevator, the walkway is articulated by means of bearings, as well as on the pillars, which is articulated at the base. The top floor is a lookout, with panoramic views of the city, while connections to the floors below are made (in addition to the elevator) by two spiral staircases, with different patterns on each storey. The main machinery was installed at the base of the Elevator, while at the exit to the Largo do Carmo there is a veranda to allow circulation. The corridor that passes above the structure, was transformed into a terrace, and exits to Largo do Carmo through an iron gate. The space destined the electrical equipment was located under the Escadinhas, in a space set aside for this purpose, under a vaulted ceiling. The lift is decorated in a Neo- Gothic style in iron. Since iron was a new building material at the time of its construction, it is symbolic of the technical and memorial construction from this period, representing the culture of the 1900s, when the structure and elevators were considered a major innovation and portent of a modern age.

Near the campus of Northwestern University, it is primarily used for American football, and is the home field of the Northwestern Wildcats of the Big Ten Conference. It is the only FBS stadium without permanent lighting. Its current seating capacity is 47,130. Opened in 1926, it was named Dyche Stadium for William Dyche, class of 1882, a former Evanston mayor and overseer of the building project. The stadium was renamed Ryan Field in 1997 in honor of the family of Aon Corporation founder Patrick G. Ryan, who was then the chairman of Northwestern's board of trustees. The renaming was made by the other members of the board in recognition of the Ryan family's leadership and numerous contributions to Northwestern, including the lead gift to the Campaign for Athletic Excellence, Northwestern's fundraising drive for athletic facilities. History At the time it was constructed, Dyche Stadium was considered one of the finest college football stadiums in the country. The stadium originally consisted of two semi circular grandstands on either sideline, with the west (home) sideline having a small, curved upper deck whose 2 ends abut in matching concrete towers. The purpose of the curved grandstands was to maximize the number of fans sitting close to the action. End zone seating was later added in the south, and in 1952 McGaw Memorial Hall was built beyond the north end zone. The stadium had a natural grass surface when it opened. It switched to artificial turf in 1973 and was used until 1996. Prior to the 1997 season, the natural grass surface was restored and the playing surface was lowered approximately to improve sight lines from the lowest rows of the stadium. As of 2017, Ryan Field is the only stadium in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) without permanent lights. The Chicago Bears played their first home game of the 1970 season at Dyche Stadium on September 28 as an experiment; the NFL had required that the Bears move out of Wrigley Field because its seating capacity was under 50,000, which was below the minimum set out by the newly constituted post-merger NFL. Also, the Chicago Cubs were in a September pennant race with the Pittsburgh Pirates and New York Mets in the National League East. If Wrigley Field was needed for postseason baseball games, the temporary grandstand for football along the east sideline (in right and center field) would not be available until late October. After Evanston residents petitioned city officials to block the team from moving there permanently, the Bears ended up moving to Chicago's Soldier Field the following year. The stadium hosted the 1932 Women's (July 16) and 1948 Men's (July 9‚Äì10) US Olympic Trials for track and field. The venue also hosted the NCAA track and field championships in 1943. It also hosted the summer College All-Star Game in 1943 and 1944, which had usually been instead held at Chicago's Soldier Field. Both games were played at night with the use of temporary lights.http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1988-08-31/sports/8801270026_1_northwestern- dyche-stadium-all-star The college all-stars held their practices for the game at Ryan Field in years such as 1934 and 1935.Ryan Field in November 2006 Ryan Field in November 2006 Renaming controversy Northwestern's decision to rename Dyche Stadium to Ryan Field defied the university's own 1926 resolution that forbade such a change. School officials said that a private institution can override previous boards' decisions, and dismissed the earlier resolution as a \\"show of appreciation.\\" But NU did not explain why a mere gesture of appreciation would expressly state that any football stadium at any location would retain the name Dyche, as indeed the 1926 resolution does. The Dyche family wasn't notified of the change; NU claimed that the only descendant they found was a grandniece, despite other family members living in Chicago and being listed in the phone book. After the family protested, NU said it was willing to install an informational plaque at the stadium, noting its former name. Transportation The closest transit stations are Metra commuter railroad's Central Street station and Chicago Transit Authority's Central station on the Purple Line. In popular culture Parts of The Express: The Ernie Davis Story, a 2008 film about Syracuse University Heisman Trophy winner Ernie Davis starring Rob Brown as Davis, and Dennis Quaid as Davis' Syracuse coach, Ben Schwartzwalder, were filmed at Ryan Field. Parts of Four Friends, a 1981 film directed by Arthur Penn, were filmed at Dyche Stadium.

Segrest is best known for her 1994 autobiographical work Memoir of a Race Traitor, which won the Editor's Choice Lambda Literary Award.  Career  In the 1970s, Segrest moved to North Carolina to attend Duke University, where she earned her PhD in English literature in 1979. While studying at Duke, and for several years thereafter, she taught English at nearby Campbell University. Segrest worked at Connecticut College in New London, Connecticut since 2002 and in 2004 was appointed the Fuller-Matthai Professor of Gender and Women's Studies. She retired from teaching in 2014. Social activism Segrest has founded, served on the boards of, and consulted with a wide range of social justice organizations throughout her life and is a recognized speaker and writier on issues of sexism, racism, homophobia, classism, and other forms of oppression. From 1983 to 1990, Segrest worked with North Carolinians Against Racist and Religious Violence (NCARRV), for which she is credited by many for ridding North Carolina of the Ku Klux Klan. From 1992 to 2000 she served as coordinator of the Urban-Rural Mission (USA), part of the URM network of the World Council of Churches. Writing Until it disbanded in 1983, Segrest was a member of the Southern feminist writing collective Feminary, which also produced a journal of the same name. Feminarians, including Segrest, saw writing as a force for political change, and the journal maintained a Southern feminist focus and was anti-sexist, anti-racist, anti-homophobic, and anti- classist.Powell 100‚Äì101 Through the collective and other activist work, Segrest generated material for her first book of essays, My Mama's Dead Squirrel. Her book narrating her experience working against the Klan with North Carolinians Against Racist and Religious Violence (NCARRV) is Memoir of a Race Traitor, published in 1994. It was named an Outstanding Book on Human Rights in North America and was Editor's Choice for the Lambda Literary Awards. Memoir of a Race Traitor has been hailed by Howard Zinn as \\"extraordinary . . . It is a 'political memoir,' but its language is poetic and its tone passionate.\\" South End Press It is considered a key text in white studies and anti-racist studies. In this work, Segrest outlines her definition of \\"queer socialism,\\" which is how she defines her political stance. This version of socialism demands a more caring world where all citizens are taken into consideration when resources are allocated and opportunities are dispensed. She says that while there is no blueprint as yet for this form of socialism, it would be based in feminist theory and practice. It was re-released in 2019 by The New Press. Segrest's book, Born to Belonging: Writings on Spirit and Justice was published in 2002 and recounts her experiences in activism around the world. Segrest co-edited Sing, Whisper, Shout, Pray: Feminist Strategies for a Just World (2003) with Jacqui Alexander, Lisa Albrect and Sharon Day. Segres was awarded a fellowship at the National Humanities Center to support the writing of her Administrations of Lunacy: Racism and the Haunting of American Psychiatry at the Milledgeville Asylum on the history of the Central State Hospital in Milledgeville, Georgia, forthcoming in 2020 by The New Press.

Red Vines Original Red Twists are also sometimes referred to as red licorice despite containing no licorice. The original Red Vines were raspberry-flavored, but in 1952, with a slight formula change, the Red Vines Original Red Twist flavor was introduced.  August 2012 recall  In August 2012 the California Department of Public Health announced a recall of one lot of Red Vines' black licorice candy due to lead contamination. Only the one-pound packages marked \\"Best Before 020413\\" were recalled. Testing found that candy in the contaminated lot had as much as 0.33 parts per million of lead resulting in up to 13.2 micrograms of lead per serving. This was more than double the limit of 6.0 micrograms of lead per day from all dietary sources for children under 6 years old. In popular culture Fox science-fiction drama television series Fringe frequently refers to Red Vines throughout its five season run, as it is the preferred candy of the character Doctor Walter Bishop. In the season 2 premiere, \\"A New Day in the Old Town\\", he is even seen eating Red Vines while conducting an autopsy. After the TV series was renewed for a fourth season on March 24, 2011, co-star Josh Jackson publicly stated his appreciation of Fringe fans for sending Red Vines to Fox in an effort to campaign for a renewal. Red Vines were airdropped into 89th Academy Awards ceremony by host Jimmy Kimmel. Red Vines is mentioned in an SNL Digital Short from 2005. In the music video \\"Lazy Sunday\\", Andy Samberg raps: \\"Mr. Pibb and Red Vines equals crazy delicious.\\" Red Vines is also the name of an Aimee Mann song from her 1999 album \\"Bachelor No. 2.\\" The chorus talks about \\"...Cigarettes and Red Vines,\\" as something to occupy one's time while helplessly watching other events.

It is the home stadium of the University of Iowa Hawkeyes, in the sport of college football. First opened in 1929 to replace Iowa Field, it currently holds up to 69,250 people, making it the 7th largest stadium in the Big Ten, and one of the 20 largest university owned stadiums in the nation. It is named for Nile Kinnick, the 1939 Heisman Trophy winner and the only Heisman winner in university history, who died in service during World War II. It was named Iowa Stadium until 1972, when longtime lobbying by Cedar Rapids Gazette sportswriter Gus Schrader successfully convinced the UI athletic board to change the name. It is currently the only college football stadium named after a Heisman Trophy winner. https://www.thegazette.com/subject/opinion/guest-columnist/its-time-to-rename- kinnick-stadium-20200612 Construction Iowa Stadium was constructed in only seven months between 1928 and 1929. Groundbreaking and construction began on March 6, 1929. Workers worked around the clock using lights by night and horses and mules as the primary heavy-equipment movers. There was a rumor for many years that horses that died during the process were buried under what now is the North end zone.IAGenWeb Project Historians report this is a myth and the animals were disposed of in the nearby Iowa River. The round-the-clock construction came to an end in July. Despite several problems to overcome, including the athletic director's resignation and a slight redesign, the stadium was completed and the first game was played October 5, 1929, against Monmouth College. Iowa won the game 46-0\\\\. The stadium was dedicated two weeks later, when the Hawkeyes tied Illinois 7-7. Features The playing surface is currently the synthetic FieldTurf (installed in 2009), although it was AstroTurf from 1972 until grass was reinstalled for the 1989 season. The installation of artificial turf came at the same time that Iowa Stadium was renamed Kinnick Stadium in honor of the Heisman winner who had perished 29 years earlier. When filled to capacity, Kinnick Stadium would be the sixth largest city in Iowa (after Des Moines, Cedar Rapids, Davenport, Sioux City, and Iowa City). Prior to the 2015 football season, the stadium did not have permanent lights; the school contracted Musco Lighting's portable light trucks for night games in previous years. The school had installed permanent practice lights at the stadium in 2012. By capacity, Kinnick Stadium is the 27th largest college football stadium, the 42nd largest sports stadium in the United States, and the 86th largest sports stadium in the world. On November 14, 2015, Iowa set the national collegiate wrestling dual-meet attendance record at Kinnick with over 42,000 fans in a victory over #1 Oklahoma State. Kinnick Stadium is well known for its pink visitors' locker rooms, a tradition started by emeritus Iowa coach Hayden Fry. Believing that pink would put opponents in a \\"passive mood\\", and because he thought that some believed pink was a \\"sissy color\\", Fry had the visiting locker rooms decorated completely in the color pink. Inside the visitor's pink locker room inside Kinnick Stadium. Former Iowa coach Hayden Fry had the locker room painted pink. The pink locker room tradition has been continued with the newly renovated locker rooms, which include everything from pink urinals to pink lockers. Controversy flared during the 2005 season when a visiting law professor, along with other university faculty and students protested the pink coloration as demeaning to women and homosexuals. Despite these protests and with much student support, however, the locker room remains pink. A more recent feature is the bronze statue of Heisman Trophy winner Nile Kinnick, the statue depicts Kinnick dressed as a scholar, rather than in his football uniform. The bronze statue is placed near the team entrance to the stadium. When the renovation of the stadium was completed, and the statue unveiled, a tradition among the players began: one player, before entering the locker room, reached out and touched the helmet that was placed at Kinnick's feet. From that point on, all Iowa players, before entering the locker room, and after getting off the bus, walk up to the statue and rub the helmet, as a token of respect for Kinnick - the only Iowa player to ever win the Heisman Trophy. The on-field entrances to the stadium all have a picture of Nile Kinnick placed above the tunnel before exiting the tunnel to the field. Renovation The new scoreboard in the south end zone at Kinnick Stadium. After 75 years of operation, the Iowa Board of Regents endorsed a major renovation of Kinnick Stadium on March 10, 2004. The US$86.8 million project was to build a new state of the art press box, a new scoreboard with a new sound system, replace the \\"temporary\\" south endzone bleachers with permanent seating, triple the restroom facilities, and more than double the number of concession stands, as well as smaller changes such as new locker rooms, a bronze statue of Nile Kinnick and the dedication of the Krause Family Plaza to which Kinnick Stadium is now adjacent. Every brick for the renovation came from the Glen-Gery Brickyard in Redfield, which is located near Nile Kinnick's childhood home in Adel. The stadium was rededicated on September 1, 2006. Among other things, the rededication featured a flyover by a F4F Wildcat, the aircraft that Kinnick flew in World War II. The stadium also underwent major renovations in 1956, 1983, and 1990 where capacity was gradually taken from 53,000 to 70,397. The 2004-06 renovations pushed the capacity to 70,585. In the spring of 2009, the natural grass turf and 20-year- old drainage system were replaced with a new state-of-the-art synthetic FieldTurf playing surface. In 2013, the Iowa Board of Regents approved an $8 million upgrade of Kinnick Stadium's video and sound systems. These upgrades include the installation of new HD video displays in both the north and south endzones, as well as a new HD ribbon display above the north endzone. The upgrades were completed by the start of the 2013 football season. In 2016, the Iowa Board of Regents approved an $89.9 million upgrade to Kinnick Stadium's north end zone. The renovation included the addition of box seating, outdoor club seating and a scoreboard larger than the board in the south end zone. These renovations lowered the total capacity of the stadium to 69,250. The project was completed shortly before the beginning of the 2019 season. In 2019, the tunnel connecting the home locker room to the field was upgraded, with the addition of black and gold signage, lighting, and logos.

The Children's Hospital and the Wave The University of Iowa Children's Hospital's new building overlooks the East stands of Kinnick Stadium. The opening of the new hospital in 2017 led to the creation of what ESPN called \\"college football's coolest new tradition.\\" The new facility includes a top-floor lounge area known as the Press Box Cafe that has a view of the entire field, allowing patients and their families to see all Iowa home games live, and also includes big-screen TVs to allow them to watch Hawkeyes road games. A suggestion on a Hawkeyes fan page on Facebook led to \\"The Wave\\"‚Äîat the end of the first quarter of Iowa home games, the crowd faces the hospital and waves at the patients and their families watching in the Press Box. For the Hawkeyes' first night home game of the 2017 season against Penn State, the fan site where the idea of \\"The Wave\\" originated encouraged fans to turn on their cell phone flashlights while they waved to the patients. Ever since the humble beginnings of the ‚ÄúKinnick Wave‚Äù, even players on both teams and the on-field game officials join in this heartwarming tradition now.

He was a significant figure in the contexts of modern Jewish religious thought, Jewish- Christian relations, and Anglo-Jewish socio-politics, and educator. Montefiore was President of the Anglo-Jewish Association and an influential anti-Zionist leader, who co-founded the anti-Zionist League of British Jews in 1917. Family Claude Montefiore was the youngest son of Nathaniel Montefiore and Emma Goldsmid. He had two sisters, Alice Julia and Charlotte Rosalind and one brother, Leonard (1853-1879).The Peerage He was the great-nephew of Sir Moses Montefiore. Montefiore's first wife was Therese Alice Schorstein, who had been a student at Girton College. She died in 1889 and, two years later, he endowed a prize in her memory ‚Äì the Therese Montefiore Memorial Prize. Their son was Leonard G. Montefiore. Montefiore remarried at the West London Synagogue on 24 July 1902. His second wife was Florence Fyfe Brereton Ward, daughter of Richard James Ward, and a Vice-Mistress at Girton, having started there as Librarian. Education Part of Montefiore's childhood was spent at his family's Coldeast estate in Sarisbury Green, Hampshire. He was educated at Balliol College, Oxford, where he obtained a first-class honours degree in the classical final examination, and where he came under the influence of Benjamin Jowett and T. H. Green. Intended originally for the ministry of the West London Synagogue, he studied theology in Berlin, but finding himself unable to sympathise with the arrest of the Reform Movement, he devoted himself instead to scholarly and philanthropic pursuits. He nevertheless continued to be a spiritual teacher and preacher, though in a lay capacity, and published a volume of sermons, in conjunction with Israel Abrahams, entitled \\"Aspects of Judaism\\" (London, 1894). In 1886, he was selected by the Hibbert Trustees to deliver their course of lectures for 1892 (\\"The Origin of Religion as Illustrated by the Ancient Hebrews\\"). In these lectures, Montefiore made a permanent contribution to the science of theology. In 1896, he published the first volume of his \\"Bible for Home Reading,\\" forming a commentary on the Bible with moral reflections from the standpoint of the \\"higher criticism\\"; the second volume appeared in 1899. In 1888 Montefiore founded and edited, in conjunction with Israel Abrahams, the \\"Jewish Quarterly Review\\", a journal that stood on the very highest level of contemporary Jewish scholarship, and in which numerous contributions from his pen have appeared. Teachings and positions Among Jewish religious leaders, Montefiore was unusual for the time and energy he devoted to the study of Christianity. He provoked considerable controversy for what was perceived by many to be an overly sympathetic attitude towards Jesus and Paul of Tarsus. Inter alia, he wrote a two-volume commentary on the Synoptic gospels in the early part of the twentieth century, What A Jew Thinks about Jesus, published in 1935, and Judaism and St. Paul (1914). He assisted Rev. Simeon Singer in preparing the standard Anglo-Jewish prayer book. This was acknowledged in the original preface, but his name was removed from the preface of the second edition. Montefiore was one of the leading authorities on questions of education. Montefiore was mainly instrumental in enabling Jewish pupil teachers at elementary schools to enjoy the advantages of training in classes held for the purpose at the universities. Montefiore showed great sympathy with all liberal tendencies in Jewish religious movements in London and was president of the Jewish Religious Union. He was president of the Jewish Historical Society of England in 1899‚Äì1900. He ranked as one of the leading philanthropists in the Anglo-Jewish community and held office in various important bodies. Group involvement As a revered scholar, philanthropist and spiritual authority, Claude Montefiore belong to that important group of learned laymen who have sought to revolutionise Judaism. He was a founder of British Liberal Judaism at the turn of the 20th Century, considered to be the most original Anglo- Jewish religious thinker of his day, and still remains a highly controversial figure. Montefiore infuriated his enemies and often alienated his supporters with his radical agenda in which he applied the findings of historical and literary analysis to the Jewish scriptures, attempted to radically systemise rabbinic thought, and by his desire to learn from and re-express aspects of Christian theology. The extent to which he incorporated the teachings of Jesus and Paul into his own ethical and theological musings makes him unique among Jewish reformers. In his dealings with Christians and Christian thought, he can also be regarded as a forerunner to those who would later fully partake in Jewish-Christian dialogue. Montefiore is an important figure in Anglo-Jewish history, not least for the way in which his complex identity reflects the difficulty inherent in attempting to make Judaism genuinely relevant to the modern world.

Baring-Gould, A Book of Brittany, Methuen and Co., 1909, p. 103 He had a brilliant privateering and naval career and eventually became \\"Lieutenant-General of the Naval Armies of the King\\" (i.e. Vice admiral) (French:Lieutenant-G√©n√©ral des arm√©es navales du roi), and a Commander in the Order of Saint-Louis. Ten ships of the French Navy were named in his honour.  Early career  His family operated a shipping business in Saint Malo, a port favoured by corsairs. He first went to sea as a volunteer aboard the privateer Trinit√©, under Captain Legoux, on the 16 December 1690. Trinit√© subsequently captured Fran√ßois Samuel and Seven Stars of Scotland. In 1692 his family provided him with command of his own vessel, a 14-gun lugger, Danycan. On 6 June 1692, King Louis XIV appointed Duguay-Truin to command of the forty-gun ship Hercule. He captured five ships at the entrance of the Channel. R√©n√© Duguay-Trouin telling King Louis XIV of his exploits.  Nobility  In 1694 Louis XIV awarded Duguay- Trouin with a sword of honour, and made him a nobleman in 1709, with the motto Dedit haec insignia virtus (\\"Bravery awarded these honours\\"). At the time, he had captured 16 warships and over 300 merchantmen from the English and Dutch. On 12 April 1694, Duguay-Trouin, aboard the ship Diligente, covered the escape of a convoy which he was escorting but was defeated by a six-ship squadron commanded by Admiral David Mitchell. Diligente, barely afloat and having lost most of her men, was forced to strike her colours and surrender and Duguay- Truin was taken as a prisoner to Plymouth. The English admiralty, upon learning that Trouin had fired upon Prince of Orange while flying the English flag, had him locked in an iron room. On 19 June 1694, he made an adventurous escape, by capturing a small boat that he had bought from a friendly Swedish captain whose ship was lying nearby. He was accompanied by Lieutenant Nicolas Thomas, surgeon Lhermite, Pierre Legendre and the quartermaster. After a series of raids on coastal towns in Ireland, Duguay-Truin returned to Saint- Malo. In 1697, the treaty of Ryswick put a halt to the privateers and Duguay- Trouin spent his time in Saint-Malo. He was involved in a duel with a gentleman, Charles Cognetz, who had allegedly cheated in a game of cards. Both were taken to the police officer, M de Vauborel, who explicitly forbade any further violence.  War of the Spanish Succession  Capture of Rio de Janeiro by Duguay-Trouin in 1711. In 1702, as the War of the Spanish Succession broke out, Duguay-Trouin commanded Bellone and then Railleuse. He became an officer in the French Marine Royale. In 1704-1705 he commanded the ship Jason and captured the British ships of the line and . On 21 October 1707, together with Claude de Forbin, he achieved his greatest victory against a British squadron, in the Battle at the Lizard. In 1709 he captured the British ship of the line . On 21 September 1711, in an 11-day battle, he captured Rio de Janeiro, then believed impregnable, with twelve ships and 6,000 men, in spite of the defence consisting of seven ships of the line, five forts, and 12,000 men; he held the governor for ransom. Investors in this venture doubled their money, and Duguay-Trouin earned a promotion to Lieutenant g√©n√©ral de la Marine.  Late career  Statue in St Malo In his late career, he commanded the fleet based in Saint-Malo, then the fleet based in Brest, the fleet for the East and eventually Toulon harbour. He died in 1736, after having written to Fleury to ask Louis XV to support his family. Duguay-Trouin is mentioned in Volume II, \\"Within A Budding Grove\\", of Marcel Proust's In Search of Lost Time (previously published as Remembrance of Things Past). The reference occurs in an interlude section of the work entitled \\"Place Names: the Place\\" juxtaposed with other Impressionistic images. This reference specifically compares the brave image of the warrior's statue with the banal image of ordinary people eating sorbets in a bakery, illustrating that at the time, Duguay-Trouin's influence on French society was still so pervasive that statues of his form were commonplace.

It commemorates Sir William Wallace, a 13th- century Scottish hero. National Wallace Monument and Ochil Hills in autumn. The tower is open to the public for an admission fee. Visitors approach by foot from the base of the crag on which it stands. On entry there are 246 steps to the final observation platform, with three exhibition rooms within the body of the tower. The tower is not accessible to disabled visitors.https://www.nationalwallacemonument.com/the-monument/ Background The tower was constructed following a fundraising campaign, which accompanied a resurgence of Scottish national identity in the 19th century. The campaign was begun in Glasgow in 1851 by Rev Charles Rogers who was joined by William Burns. Burns took sole charge from around 1855 following Rogers' resignation. In addition to public subscription, it was partially funded by contributions from a number of foreign donors, including Italian national leader Giuseppe Garibaldi. The foundation stone was laid in 1861 by the Duke of Atholl in his role as Grand Master Mason of Scotland with a short speech given by Sir Archibald Alison.Logie: A Parish History, Menzies Fergusson, 1905 It was completed in 1869 to the designs of architect John Thomas Rochead at a cost of ¬£18,000, the monument is a sandstone tower, built in the Victorian Gothic style. The tower stands on the Abbey Craig, a volcanic crag above Cambuskenneth Abbey, from which Wallace was said to have watched the gathering of the army of King Edward I of England, just before the Battle of Stirling Bridge in 1297. The monument is open to the general public. Visitors climb the 246-step spiral staircase to the viewing gallery inside the monument's crown, which provides expansive views of the Ochil Hills and the Forth Valley. A number of artifacts believed to have belonged to Wallace are on display inside the monument, including the Wallace Sword, a longsword weighing almost . Inside is also a Hall of Heroes, a series of busts of famous Scots, effectively a small national Hall of Fame. The heroes are Robert the Bruce, George Buchanan, John Knox, Allan Ramsay, Robert Burns, Robert Tannahill, Adam Smith, James Watt, Sir Walter Scott, William Murdoch, Sir David Brewster, Thomas Carlyle, Hugh Miller, Thomas Chalmers, David Livingstone, and W. E. Gladstone. In 2017 it was announced that Mary Slessor and Maggie Keswick Jencks will be the first heroines to be celebrated in the hall. Statue of Wallace The original Victorian statue of Wallace stands on the corner of the monument and is by the Edinburgh sculptor David Watson Stevenson. Braveheart statue Tom Church's statue \\"Freedom\\" In 1996 Tom Church carved a statue of Wallace called \\"Freedom\\", which was inspired by the film Braveheart. It has the face of Mel Gibson, the actor who played William Wallace in the film. Church leased the statue to Stirling Council, who in 1997 installed it in the car park of the visitor centre at the foot of the craig. The statue was deeply unpopular, being described as \\"among the most loathed pieces of public art in Scotland\\" and was regularly vandalised before being placed in a cage to prevent further damage. Plans to expand the visitor centre, including a new restaurant and reception, led to the unpopular statue's removal in 2008. It was returned to Church, who, after an unsuccessful attempt to sell it at auction, reportedly offered it to Donald Trump's Menie estate golf resort. However, it remained in the garden of the sculptor's home, where it was incorporated into a replica of a castle, and with additions to it that included the head of the decapitated governor of York. In April 2016, it was reported in local press that the statue might be moved to Ardrossan's old Barony Church.

Because ajiva has no life, it does not accumulate karma and cannot die. Examples of ajiva include chairs, computers, paper, plastic, etc. According to Jain philosophy, Ajiva can be divided into two kinds, with form and without form. Five categories of Ajiva In Jainism, there are five categories which ajƒ´va can be placed into. Out of these, four categories, Dharma (medium of motion), Adharma (medium of rest), Akasha (space) and Pudgala (matter) are described as the asti-kaya dravya's (substances which possess constituent parts extending in space) while the fifth category Kala is an anasti-kaya dravya (which has no extension in space).Sharma, C. (1997). A Critical Survey of Indian Philosophy, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, , p.62 Dharma-Astikaya Dharmastikaya is formed from the two words: Dharma & Astikaya. Dharma here isn't referring to religion, but instead its referring to the medium of motion. Astikay itself is formed of two words: Asti & Kaya. Asti means space, body or mode and Kaya means collection. So Astikaya means a collection of spaces or regions. Dharmastikaya denotes the medium of motion for things in the universe. In the absence of this medium, living things (i.e. jiva) would not be able to move. Adharma-Astikaya Adharmastikaya is also formed from two words: Adharma & Astikaya. Adharma in this case means the medium of rest. In the absence of this medium, Living things or jiva would continuously move. ƒÄkƒÅ≈õa -Astikaya The infinity of space, called ƒÅkƒÅ≈õa in Sanskrit, is divided by the Jain philosophy into two parts, namely, the lokƒÅkƒÅ≈õa (loka+ƒÅkƒÅ≈õa), that is the space occupied by the universe, and the alokƒÅkƒÅ≈õa (a not, and lokƒÅkƒÅ≈õa), the portion beyond the universe. The lokƒÅkƒÅ≈õa is the portion in which are to be found the remaining five substances, i.e., Jƒ´vas, Matter, Time, Dharma and Adharma; but the alokƒÅkƒÅ≈õa is the region of pure space containing no other substance and lying stretched on all sides beyond bounds of the three worlds (the entire universe). At the summit of the lokƒÅkƒÅ≈õa is the Siddhashila (abode of the liberated souls).Sharma, C. (1997). A Critical Survey of Indian Philosophy, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, , p.64 Pudgala-Astikaya The word Pudgala is made up of two terms: Pud means supplement (integration) and Gala means disintegration (division). In other words, what continuously changes by supplementation and/or division (purayanti galanti cha) is called Pudgala or matter. All matter in the universe is called Pudgala. Pudgala has form and shape. Pudgala can be experienced by touching, tasting, smelling, or seeing.\\"Sparsharasagandhavarnavantah pudgalah\\" - Umasvati, Tattvarthadhigama- sutra, v.23 Like Jiva Pudgala is also mobile. According to Jainism, The karma particles that attach to our souls are also Pudgala. Pudgala can only be divided and subdivided to a certain extent that it is not possible to further subdivide it. This indivisible part of Pudgala, which is separated from the main pudgala, is called Paramanu. A paramanu is much more minute than even an atom. When a Paramanu is attached to the main pudgala, it is called a Pradesha. These subatomic Paramanus are too minute to be detected by normal vision, but they can be combined. Thus when a paramanu is combined with one or more other paramanus, they are called a skandha which are more or less like a molecules. Part of skandha is called desha. Such sknadhas may be large or small. Small skandhas may be invisible to the eye, but they can be seen when the combinations are larger. Kala Kala refers to time that brings forth changes. Past, present, and future are the different modes of time and are measured in terms of years, months, days, hours, minutes or seconds. For practical purposes a second happens to be the finest measurement of time. Jainism however, recognizes a very small measurement of time known as samaya which is an infinitely small part of a second. Kala (time) is infinite, but there are cycles (kalachakras) in it. Each cycle having two eras of equal duration described as the avasarpini and the utsarpini. The former is a descending era in which virtue gradually decreases. The latter is an ascending era in which the reverse takes place. The present era is stated to be the former.Hiriyanna, M. (1993, reprint 2000).

Gallic people of modern Brittany: The Veneti (Gaulish: \\"the kin, the friendly ones\\") were a Gallic tribe who lived in Armorica (Brittany Peninsula, France). A seafaring people, they strongly influenced southwestern Brittonic culture by their trade. After they were defeated by Junius Brutus Albinus in a naval battle in 56 BCE, their maritime commerce eventually declined under the Roman Empire, but a prosperous agricultural life is indicated by archaeological evidence.  Name  They are mentioned as Venetos by Caesar (mid-1st c. BC), Livy (late 1st c. BC) and Pliny (1st c. AD),Caesar. Commentarii de Bello Gallico, 2:34; 3,7:4 Livy. Perioch., 104Pliny. Naturalis Historia, 4:107 as Ou√©netoi (Œü·ΩêŒ≠ŒΩŒµœÑŒøŒπ) by Strabo (early 1st c. AD) and Ptolemy (2nd c. AD),Strabo. Ge≈çgraphik√°, 4:4:1Ptolemy. Ge≈çgraphik·∏ï Hyph·∏ógƒìsis, 2:8:6 as Veneti on the Tabula Peutingeriana (5th c. AD),Tabula Peutingeriana 1:2 and as Benetis in the Notitia Dignitatum (5th c. AD).Notitia Dignitatum. oc. 37:5 The name Veneti stems from Gaulish uenet- ('kin, friendly', perhaps also 'merchants'), itself deriving from Proto-Celtic *wenyƒÅ ('family, kindred'; compare with Old Irish fine), ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *wenh‚ÇÅ- ('desire'; compare with OHG wini 'friend'). The root is attested in other parts of the Celtic linguistic area (Venedoti, Venetus Lacus, etc.), and among Indo-European languages in general (Adriatic Veneti, Vistula Veneti, Eneti). The city of Vannes, attested as civitas Venetum ca. 400 ('civitas of the Veneti'; Venes in 1273) is named after the Gaulish tribe.  Geography  The Veneti built their strongholds on the tips of coastal spits or promontories, where shoals make approaching the headlands by sea dangerous, an unusual position which sheltered them from sea-borne attack. They inhabited southern Armorica, along the Morbihan bay. Their most notable city, and probably their capital, was Darioritum (now known as Gwened in Breton or Vannes in French), mentioned in Ptolemy's Geography. Other ancient Celtic peoples historically attested in Armorica include the Redones, Curiosolitae, Osismii, Esubii and Namnetes.  History = Coming of Caesar  Caesar reports in Bellum Gallicum that he sent in 57 BCE his prot√©g√©, Publius Crassus, to deal with coastal tribes in Armorica (including the Veneti) in the context of a planned Roman invasion of Britain for the following year, which eventually went astray until 55. Although Caesar claims that they were forced to submit to Roman power, there is no evidence of an initial opposition from the Gallic tribes, and the fact that Caesar sent only a single legion to negotiate with the Veneti suggests that no trouble was expected. Caesar's report is probably part of a political narrative that was set up to justify the conquest of Gauls and to hide his aborted plan to invade Britain in 56.' The scholar Michel Rambaud has argued that the Gauls initially thought they were making an alliance with the Romans and not surrendering to them. In 56 BCE, the Veneti captured the commissaries Rome had sent to demand grain supplies in the winter of 57‚Äì56, in order to use them as bargaining chips to secure the release of the hostages they had previously surrendered to Caesar. Hearing of the nascent revolt, all the coastal Gaulish tribes bound themselves by oath to act in concert. This is the cause explicitly given by Caesar for the war.' This version is contradicted by Strabo, who contends that the Veneti aimed to stop Caesar's planned invasion of Britain, which would have threatened their trade relations with the island. Strabo's claim appears to be confirmed by the participation of other Gaulish tribes trading with Britain in the war, and by the involvement of Britons themselves.' Caesar had left for Illyricum at the beginning of the winter of 57‚Äì56. Informed of the events occurring in Armorica by Crassus, he launched the construction of a fleet of galleys, and placed orders for ships from the Pictones, Santones, and other 'pacified tribes'. War preparations were quickly achieved, and he joined the army 'as soon as the season permitted'. In response, the Veneti summoned help for further groups, including the Morini, Menapii and Britons.'''' Battle of Morbihan Given the highly defensible nature of the Veneti strongholds, land attacks were frustrated by the incoming tide, and naval forces were left trapped on the rocks when the tide ebbed. Despite this, Caesar managed to engineer moles and raised siege-works that provided his legions with a base of operations. However, once the Veneti were threatened in one stronghold, they used their fleet to evacuate to another stronghold, obliging the Romans to repeat the same engineering feat elsewhere. Julius Caesar's victories in the Gallic Wars, completed by 51 BCE, extended Rome's territory to the English Channel and the Rhine. Caesar became the first Roman general to cross both bodies of water when he built a bridge across the Rhine and conducted the first invasion of Britain. Battle of Morbihan Since the destruction of the enemy fleet was the only permanent way to end this problem, Caesar directed his men to build ships. However, his galleys were at a serious disadvantage compared to the far thicker Veneti ships. The thickness of their ships meant they were resistant to ramming, whilst their greater height meant they could shower the Roman ships with projectiles, and even command the wooden turrets which Caesar had added to his bulwarks. The Veneti manoeuvred so skilfully under sail that boarding was impossible. These factors, coupled with their intimate knowledge of the coast and tides, put the Romans at a disadvantage. However, Caesar's legate Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus was given command of the Roman fleet, and in a decisive battle, succeeded in destroying the Gaulish fleet in Quiberon Bay, with Caesar watching from the shore. Using long billhooks, the Romans struck at the enemy's halyards as they swept past (these must have been fastened out-board), having the effect of dropping the huge leathern mainsails to the deck, which crippled the vessel whether for sailing or rowing. The Romans were at last able to board, and the whole Veneti fleet fell into their hands. Economy According to Caesar, the Veneti were the most influential tribe of Armorica, since they had the largest fleet, which they used for trade with Britain, and occupied a few harbours on the dangerous coasts of that region. This claim is evidenced by the fact that two officers (rather than one) went sent by the Romans to demand grain from them in the winter of 57‚Äì56 BCE. According to Strabo and Caesar, the Veneti had trading stations in Britain and regularly sailed to the island. Caesar further mentions that they charged customs and port dues on trade ships as they passed through the region, and Strabo suggests that they were also using the terrestrial routes and rivers of Armorica to trade with Britain. Archaeological evidence show a shift in trade with Britain from Armorica to the more north-easterly routes during the second half of the 1rst century BCE, following the Roman decisive victory over Gaulish Armorican tribes in 56 BCE. The Veneti built their ships of oak with large transoms fixed by iron nails of a thumb's thickness. They navigated and powered their ships through the use of leather sails. This made their ships strong, sturdy and structurally sound, capable of withstanding the harsh conditions of the Atlantic. They controlled the tin trade from mining in Cornwall and Devon.

It serves the Northwest Line (Route 201). It is located on the exclusive light rail right of way beside 9A Street NW at 4 Avenue NW, 0.9 km northwest of the 7 Avenue & 9 Street SW interlocking. The station opened on September 7, 1987 as part of the original Northwest line. The station consists of two side- loading platforms with pedestrian crossings at both ends. The station serves the Sunnyside and Hillhurst neighbourhoods of Calgary, as well as the Kensington shopping district, and is a short walk from Riley Park. As part of Calgary Transit's plan to operate four-car trains by the end of 2014, all three-car platforms are being extended. On April 16, 2012 construction started on an extension of the platform to the South as well as redevelopment of the plaza areas immediately adjacent to the east side of the station. As of November 24, 2012, the new platform extension and wheelchair ramps have re- opened however, work continued on the station plaza area on the east side until early January 2013.http://www.calgarycitynews.com/2012/11/ramp-access- at-sunnyside-station-set-to.html History The station, and the section of the line running through it, is the most controversial in the CTrain system. When the Northwest Line was being planned, community residents organized to keep this station from being built as it required the demolition of many homes and the major disruption of 9A Street N.W. (a number of homes and apartment blocks which were not demolished were left with no front street access). The city pushed ahead with its plans by purchasing most of the properties along 9A Street. Eventually, as the area became accustomed to the CTrain, the properties were sold off to private interests.

Derived from the M2 half-track car, the M3 was extensively produced, with about 15,000 standard M3s and more than 38,000 variant units manufactured. The M3 was extensively modified with several dozen variant designs produced for different purposes. During World War II, the M3 and its variants were supplied to the U.S. Army and Marines, as well as British Commonwealth and Soviet Red Army forces, serving on all major fronts throughout the war. The M3 and its variants were produced by many manufacturers including Diamond T, White Motor Company and Autocar and were designed for a wide variety of uses, such as a self-propelled anti-aircraft weapon or self-propelled artillery. Although initially unpopular due to its lack of significant armor or a roof to protect the crew from shrapnel, it was used by most of the Allies during the war. In the Cold War era, the vehicle was used by a variety of state and non-state operators in conflicts in South America, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia, remaining in service until as late as the mid-1990s. In Mexico they are still in use as of 2019.  Specifications  The M3 half-track was long, wide, high and weighed . The wheelbase was long. The suspension consists of a leaf spring for the two front wheels, while the rear treads had vertical volute springs. With a fuel capacity of 60 US gallons (230 l), the M3 could carry its crew (one driver) and a squad of 12 soldiers before refueling, while protecting them from small arms with light armor (6‚Äì12 mm of armor). The vehicle was powered by a White 160AX, 386 in3 (6,330 cc),Bishop (1998), p. 81. 6-cylinder gasoline engine, giving the vehicle a power-to-weight ratio of 15.8 hp/ton.  Design  The design, which used many commercial components to improve reliability and the rate of production, was standardized in 1940 and built by the Autocar Company, Diamond T Motor Company, and the White Motor Company. With a White 160AX engine, the M3 was driven through a manual constant-mesh (non-synchromesh) transmission with four forward and one reverse gear, as well as a two-speed transfer case. The front suspension uses leaf springs, while the tracks use vertical volute springs. Braking was hydraulic assisted while steering was manual. Onboard electronics run on a 12-volt system.Berndt (1993), p. 152. The vehicle uses two tracks made of molded rubber over steel cabling with metal track guides.Mesko (1996), p. 8. Infantry rifles were held in brackets behind the seats while ammunition and rations were generally stored underneath. In 1942, the vehicles were fitted with a small rack for land mines on the outside of the hull, just above the tracks. In combat, many squads found it necessary to stow additional rations, rucksacks and other crew stowage on the outside of the vehicle. Luggage racks were often added in the field, and later vehicles were fitted with rear-mounted racks for this purpose.Zaloga (1994), p. 11 Early vehicles had a pintle mount, just behind the front seats, that mounted a .50-caliber (12.7 mm) M2 Browning machine gun. The later M3A1 adopted a raised, armored pulpit mount for the .50-caliber and additional .30-caliber (7.62 mm) machine guns mounted along the sides of the passenger compartment. Many M3s were later converted to M3A1s. The body was fully armored, with an adjustable armored shutter for the engine radiator and a bulletproof windscreen.Zaloga (1994), pp. 6‚Äì7  Development  On display in Ursel (Northwest of Ghent), Belgium The development of an armored half-track began with ordnance directive OCM 14188 to convert a M3 Scout Car into a half-track. The prototype was built at Rock Island Arsenal with help from White Motor Company and was designated the T7. It had the same chassis and engine as the M3, but had larger front wheels and a shorter front clip. The armor consisted of 1/4 inch of hardened armor plate and it was armed with two M1919 machine guns and one M2 Browning machine gun operated by a crew of eight. Tests at Aberdeen Proving Ground in 1938 demonstrated unsatisfactory performance due to the front-wheel drive. The T7 was converted back into a scout car and returned to the Army.Hunnicutt (2001), p. 25. Throughout 1939 and 1940, the M2 half- track car was prototyped and developed by the Army at Aberdeen Proving Grounds. The M3 was developed as a larger version of the M2 equipped with two M1919 machine guns and an M2 Browning machine gun for combat usage. The M3 also added a rear door and five additional seats in the rear. The M3 was tested at Aberdeen Proving Grounds in the summer of 1941 and was accepted into service soon after.Hunnicutt (2001), p. 33. Service history Rommel in Tunisia speaking with troops riding a captured American built M3 half-track during Battle of Kasserine Pass. In US service, it was intended that the M3 would be issued to armored infantry regiments. It was also quickly put into action with the Provisional Tank Group when the Japanese Army began their invasion of the Philippines. At first, there were multiple complaints due to several mechanical difficulties. These were rectified by the Ordnance Department after receiving field reports from the Philippines. The M3s first use in its intended role was during Operation Torch. Each armored division had 433 M2s or M3s, 200 in the armored regiments and 233 in the armored infantry regiment. The half-tracks were initially unpopular and dubbed \\"Purple Heart boxes\\" (a grim reference to the US Army decoration for combat wounds) by American troops. The chief complaints centered on the complete lack of overhead protection from Air burst artillery shells and that the armor was inadequate against machine gun fire. Omar Bradley quoted in his report about half-tracks that it was \\"a competent and dependable contrivance. Its bad name resulted from the inexperience of our troops who attempted to use it for too many things\\".Zaloga (1994), p. 8. Another major issue with the M3 was its fixed rear idler, which often broke on rough terrain. Commanders in North Africa bought parts to build spring-loaded rear idlers that could handle the rough terrain, which the Ordnance Department then approved as an official fix.Zaloga (1994), p. 11.Hunnicutt (2001), p. 40. In 1943, the M3 served in Sicily and Italy and received positive reports of it in action. It operated in Operation Overlord and served in Europe for the remainder of the war.Zaloga (1994), pp. 15‚Äì16. Total production of the M3 and its variants ran to nearly 54,000 vehicles.Zaloga (1994), p. 42 To supply the Allied nations, International Harvester produced several thousand of a very similar vehicle, the M5 half-track, for Lend-Lease.Zaloga (1994), p. 12.

A total of 962 T48s were produced during the war. Of these, 60 were supplied under lend lease to Britain, and 650 to the USSR who designated it SU-57 (99 rounds). A total of 31 were converted into M3A1s, while one entered service with the U.S. Army.Zaloga (1994), pp. 35‚Äì36Mesko (1996), p. 22.  Anti-aircraft variants  * T1E4/M13 Half-track ‚Äì M3 based Multiple Gun Motor Carriage equipped with the Maxson M33 mount with two M2HB machine guns (5,000 rounds). The T1E4 prototypes had the hull sides removed for ease of working with the mount. These were reintroduced on production M13s. This was a development of previous T1s that had all been based on the M2 half-track car. ** M14 Half-track ‚Äì M13 MGMC variant, based on the M5 chassis. Supplied under lend-lease to Britain (5,000 rounds).Zaloga (1994), p. 38. Korea, 1953 * M16 Half-track ‚Äì M3 based Multiple Gun Motor Carriage equipped with the Maxson M45 Quadmount (specifically the M45D) with four M2HB machine guns (5,000 rounds).Hunnicutt (2001), pp. 123‚Äì126 ** M16A1 MGMC ‚Äì Standard M3 Personnel Carriers converted to Multiple Gun Motor Carriages by removing rear seats and installing a Maxson M45 mount (more specifically the M45F, which featured folding \\"bat wing\\" gun shields on both sides of the mount over the machine guns). These vehicles are easily identified by the lack of the folding armored hull panels found on purpose-built M16s. ** M16A2 MGMC ‚Äì M16s converted to add the improvements of the M16A1 and with the addition of a rear door to the hull compartment. For existing M16s, this essentially meant a replacement of the M45D mount for the M45F mount. ** M17 Half-track ‚Äì M16 MGMC variant with the M5 chassis. Sent under lend-lease to USSR (5,000 rounds). * T58 ‚Äì Similar to the M16/M17, the T58 featured the Maxon quad-mount fitted to a special electric powered turret. Prototype only. * T28E1 CGMC ‚Äì M3 based Combination Gun Motor Carriage equipped with one M1A2 37 mm autocannon (240 rounds) flanked by 2 M2WC machine guns (3,400 rounds). The original T28 was built on the M2 half-track car chassis. Prototype only. (including \\"cover artwork\\") **M15 Half-track ‚Äì T28E1 variant, equipped with an armored superstructure on the turreted mount to provide crew protection, and switched to M2HB machine guns.Berndt (1994), p. 33. ** M15A1 CGMC ‚Äì Reorganization of the weapons, with the M2HB machine guns being fitted under the M1A2 37 mm autocannon instead of above.Hunnicutt (2001), p. 131. * T10E1 ‚Äì Variant to test the feasibility of mounting US made copies of the Hispano-Suiza HS.404 20 mm cannon on modified Maxson mounts. All were later rebuilt as M16s. The original T10 was based on the M2 half-track car chassis.Zaloga (1994), p. 39. =40 mm experiments= Various attempts were made to mate the 40 mm Bofors L/50 gun to the M3 chassis. In most cases the weapon's recoil was too severe or the mounting too heavy, and the attempts were finally stopped with the adoption of the M19 MGMC on the M24 light tank chassis. * T54/E1 ‚Äì Tested in 1942, the gun mount quickly proved to be unstable when fired, and the improved T54E1, which also added a circular armored shield and rear armor to the vehicle, could not fix the inherent problem. Prototype only.Gander (2013), p. 231. * T59 ‚Äì A development of the T54/E1, fitted with outriggers to help stabilize the vehicle during sustained firing. Still proved to be too unstable for anti-aircraft use. Prototype only. ** T59E1 ‚Äì T59 fitted with the T17 fire control system. Prototype only. * T60/E1 ‚Äì Similar to the T54 and the T59, but featured two .50 caliber M2 machine guns flanking the 40 mm cannon (the mounting's designation was T65). The T60E1 featured an armor configuration similar to that of the T54E1. Suffered from the same stability issues as previous attempts. Prototype only. * T68 ‚Äì Perhaps the most radical of the experiments, the T68 featured two 40 mm cannons, one mounted on top of the other, plus a stabilizer on top of the two guns. The recoil force proved to be too much for the mount, and the idea was abandoned. Prototype only.Gander (2013), p. 232. * M15 \\"Special\\" ‚Äì Field conversions by US Army depots in Australia of standard M3s, not M15s, fitted with turreted 40 mm Bofors L/50 guns. These were the only successful mating of this weapon to the M3 chassis, and were used more for direct fire support than for anti-aircraft purposes. * M34 ‚Äì Like the M15 \\"Special\\" above, 102 M15s were converted to M34s in Japan in 1951. The M34 mounted a single 40 mm Bofors gun in place of the M15's combination gun mount. This was due primarily to a shortage of 37 mm ammunition, which was no longer manufactured. M34s served with at least two AAA (automatic weapons) battalions (the 26th and 140th) in the Korean War.Hunnicutt (2001), p. 194.

Israeli Half-tracks were all designated M3, even M2/M9 variants and known as Zachlam ◊ñ◊ó◊ú\\"◊ù in Hebrew. The Mk. An APCs were identified as IHC M5s by the use of RED-450 engines for the most part. While the M49 mount was retained, a variety of machine guns were used.Zaloga (1994), p. 24. * M3 Mk. B ‚Äì M5 converted as a command carrier with extra radios and a front winch bumper. Mk.

The right hand vision port was often replaced with a ball mount for a machine gun. They proved to be very effective fighting anti-tank missile teams; their cannons proved effective in forcing the teams to take cover or suppress them so they could not use their missiles accurately.Zaloga (1994), p. 40.

WyoTech provides training programs that prepare students for careers as technicians in the automotive and diesel industry. In July 2018, WyoTech was purchased from Zenith Education Group by a team of Wyoming locals, including former WyoTech president Jim Mathis. As of November 2018, the Laramie campus is the only location where classes are available. History=Founding WyoTech was founded in 1966 as an automotive-themed school, offering programs in automotive repair. The first class in Laramie had 22 students, and its classes were housed in a 9,000 square foot building. In 1969, WyoTech's Laramie campus became accredited by the Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges, (ACCSC), formerly known as NATTS. Purchase and growth Corinthian Colleges purchased Wyo-tech Acquisition Corporation on July 1, 2002, for $84.4 million in cash, which was 9.5 times EBITDA. At that point, there were two WyoTech campuses: One in Laramie, Wyoming, and a facility being constructed in Blairsville, Pennsylvania. The cohort default rate for WyoTech was 7.2 in 1998 and 5.0% in 1999. By August 2004, WyoTech had seven sites, adding campuses in Boston (August 2003), Fremont, California (August 2003), Sacramento (January 2004), Oakland (March 2004), and Daytona Beach (August 2004). The Daytona campus offered programs to prepare students for jobs as motorcycle, marine, and personal watercraft technicians. WyoTech downsizing and Corinthian Colleges failure In 2007 and 2008, WyoTech divested from its Boston and Oakland campuses, which offered aviation maintenance. The Boston campus was sold in 2008 and the Oakland campus was expected to be sold in 2009. In 2011, WyoTech reported that its schools had some of the highest graduation rates of any two-year schools in the United States. WyoTech Blairsville had a graduation rate of 85.1 percent, and WyoTech Laramie a graduation rate of 80.1 percent. However, WyoTech's student loan default rates had risen to 16.8% at the Blairsville campus and 17.2% at the Laramie campus. A 2011 report by California Watch found that student loan default rates in 2009 were an alarming 27.4% at Long Beach and 24.6% in Fremont. In its 2011 investigation and 2012 report, The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions also highlighted Corinthian Colleges, WyoTech's parent company, as a predatory corporation that misled students about costs and gainful employment. In HELP documents, the committee noted that the Long Beach WyoTech had a student loan default rate of 36.6%. From July 2011 to July 2014, Corinthian Colleges loaned students funds with its high interest in-house Genesis Loans. In 2012, WyoTech divested from its campuses in Sacramento and Daytona Beach. It also reported that its trademarks had been impaired by regulatory uncertainties surrounding gainful employment. In 2013, WyoTech partnered with Mack Trucks and Volvo Trucks to create a curriculum for the new Diesel Advanced Technology Education for Mack Trucks and Volvo Trucks. However, WyoTech schools faced layoffs and site closings as Corinthian Colleges, its parent company, received greater government scrutiny for its questionable business and trading practices. One of the major criticisms of WyoTech and other for-profit colleges was that tuition was typically 300% to 400% more expensive than programs at community colleges, which triggered higher student loan default rates. Due to a lack of acceptable offers to buy the Daytona Beach campus, WyoTech continued operations there. In a 2014 expose, The Center for Investigative Reporting found that three of WyoTechs' California campuses received more than $32 million in GI Bill funds during a 5-year span. WyoTech was labeled as a subprime college because its parent company, Corinthian Colleges, had used false and misleading advertising to recruit students. ECMC purchase In February 2015, Educational Credit Management Corporation (ECMC) bought three WyoTech campuses and the remaining Everest College campuses under the name Zenith Education Group. On April 27, 2015, Zenith Education Group closed its three WyoTech campuses in California, leaving the campuses in Laramie, Blairsville, and Daytona Beach remaining. A report by the US Department of Education found that WyoTech's placement rates in California were 2% to 14% below what WyoTech had claimed. Accreditation WyoTech is nationally accredited but not regionally accredited. Most public and private universities are regionally accredited and do not accept credits or degrees from WyoTech for transfer. Campus locations As of July 2018, the only operating WyoTech campus is located in Laramie, Wyoming. * Laramie, Wyoming Legal proceedings under Corinthian Colleges ownership  In 2008, nine former WyoTech students who took heating and air-conditioning classes in Fremont claimed they had taken out student loans for as much as $40,000 each, but their training did not make them employable. According to the suit, instructors sometimes appeared to be drunk, fell asleep in class and could not answer basic questions, and equipment was outdated. In 2013, WyoTech's parent company at the time, Corinthian Colleges, was sued by the state of California for \\"false and predatory advertising, intentional misrepresentations to students, securities fraud and unlawful use of military seals in advertisements.\\" In July 2014, Corinthian Colleges agreed they would close or sell all their schools in the next few months. The U.S. Department of Education announced former U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald, a well known corruption buster, would monitor the sale and closure of for-profit career colleges owned by the failing Corinthian Colleges. On February 3, 2015, Corinthian sold 53 of its Everest and WyoTech campuses and online programs to the Zenith Education Group, a new subsidiary of the ECMC Group.

Debt cancellation and student debt relief According to the National Center for Education Statistics, approximately 17-24% of WyoTech students have defaulted on their student loans. On June 8, 2015, the US Department of Education announced that it was developing a process that would allow former students of Corinthian schools to apply for debt relief, if they believed they were victims of fraud. While the Department has still not created a formal process, they have provided the outlines of what borrowers should submit if they wish to pursue debt cancellation on the Federal Student Aid website. In addition, the advocacy group the Debt Collective has created its own, unofficial \\"Defense to Repayment App\\" that allows former students of Corinthian and other schools accused of fraud to pursue debt cancellation. The applications generated through the Debt Collective's online form was cited by the Department of Education in a Federal Register notice, which said that \\"a need for a clearer process for potential claimants\\" arose due to the submission of over 1000 defense to repayment claims by \\"a building debt activism movement.\\" ReferencesExternal links *Official website Category:Private universities and colleges in Wyoming Category:Education companies established in 1966 Category:For-profit universities and colleges in the United States Category:Universities and colleges in Alameda County, California Category:Universities and colleges in Los Angeles County, California Category:Universities and colleges in Indiana County, Pennsylvania Category:Educational institutions established in 1966 Category:Education in Albany County, Wyoming Category:1966 establishments in Wyoming Category:Corinthian Colleges Category:Private universities and colleges in California ","title":"WyoTech"},{"id":"1873948","text":"Jo Clayton (February 15, 1939 ‚Äì February 13, 1998) was an American fantasy and science fiction author.

The photo was taken on 25 Dec 2017 Jan D≈Çugosz House, 1460 AD St. Nicolaus Church, 10th century The Hillfort, 9th/10th century Wi≈õlica is a town in Busko County, ≈öwiƒôtokrzyskie Voivodeship, in south-central Poland. It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Wi≈õlica. It lies on the Nida River, approximately south of Busko-Zdr√≥j and south of the regional capital Kielce. In 2016 the town had a population of 503. It was the smallest town in Poland in 2018. History Wi≈õlica is one of the most ancient settlements in Poland, and has played an important role in Polish history. The town was founded more than 1000 years ago, close to the important commercial routes, running from Krak√≥w to Sandomierz. At that time it was probably the capital of the famous tribe Vistulans. The land of Vistulans, after coming under temporary rule of Great Moravian and Bohemia, was incorporated into Poland by Mieszko I in 990. The first guarded settlement was probably founded at the end of the 9th century. The remains that survive today are of the settlement which was erected at the end of the 12th century. The city had regular streets, the well was inlaid with stones, and a water cistern and the remains of 47 wooden houses have been found. The area compromised ten sub-settlements, whose inhabitants worked for the needs of the city. It is very likely that the city was burnt down by Tatars during the famous invasion of 1241 and it was never again inhabited by settlers. In the late 1950s, archaeologists discovered the foundations of the St. Nicholas church, dating back to the 10th or 11th century, which is exposed at the museum pavilion. The church was small: 6.65 m long and 3.40 m. wide, with one aisle, and a semicircular apse. It is one of the oldest churches in market settlements of the Ma≈Çopolska region. The famous gypsum baptismal font located under the foundation of the church became a scientific sensation and the subject of heated discussions after its discovery. Probably it was served as a font for collective baptising in the 9th century. If so, it would be the place of the earliest baptism on Polish grounds. This event is mentioned in Life of st. Methodius as, so-called Pannonian Legend. In the 12th century, Wi≈õlica became an important centre of court, intellectual and political life. It was given the status of the outstanding cultural centre by the wife of the prince Casimir the Just. In the years 1166‚Äì1173 the town was the capital of the duchy of Wi≈õlica. This is probably when the truly royal, unique in Poland, residential complex consisting of two big palaces and the additional round chapels was erected. Also, another church was founded. Its remains are hidden in Basilica vaults among the relicts of third Wi≈õlica's sanctuary. Their discoveries turned out to be a great sensation, especially the floor of the burial crypt of the first Romanesque church built in this place around 1170. It is the priceless work of the art and monument of Romanesque style. Located in the burial crypt of the 12th-century church, so-called Slab of Orants is a gypsum panel with engravings filled with black paste mixed with charcoal. It's showing two fields with plain figures separated and surrounded by decorated strips fringes, showing mythological creatures: griffins, a female centaur and the tree of life. Probably the figures represents prince Henry of Sandomierz and Kazimir the Just with their families. It is also a burial place of Henry of Sandomierz. The church with Slab of Orants was replaced in the 13th century by bigger, three-aisled basilica. Its remains are still visible in the vaults and are represented by decorative ceramic floor. Around half of 14th century, another church was erected by the king Casimir the Great. It is a beautiful example of the Gothic style in architecture while the most precious buildings of its kind in southern Poland. Also, it is the finest example of very rare two-aisled type churches. The Basilica interior is richly decorated by precious and unique wall paintings. They were commissioned around 1400 by the king Vladislau Jagiello in his favourite Ruthenian-Byzantine style. Next to the basilica two buildings founded by Jan D≈Çugosz has been preserved. In 1442 he became a cantor in the Wi≈õlica church and two years later its curator. Around 1460 he founded the belfry and a building for 12 canons and 12 assistant curates, which is today a rare monument of medieval residential architecture. Wi≈õlica was granted charter rights by the king W≈Çadys≈Çaw I the Elbow-high in 1326. Since this time it was a place of frequent political gatherings, as well as the place of reading out of Wi≈õlica Statutes. His son, King Casimir the Great built the towns fortified walls with three gates and the castle which was later pulled down. The town's spacious layout changed in those years. The new center of Wi≈õlica was located on the commercial route, so-called Via Salis. New bridges on the river Nida were constructed. Wi≈õlica was granted important privileges, toll customs on the bridges, the exemption of townspeople custom duties and the right of storing salt. The brewery of Wi≈õlica was known as producing the excellent beer, which was delivered to Krak√≥w for the royal table. From the 14th century Wi≈õlica was the capital of a land, from the 15th century it was a county capital and the seat of starosta. In 1528 king Sigismund I the Old granted Wi≈õlica the right to build municipal waterworks. By the end of the 16th century, the town was destroyed by successive fires, floods and epidemic, began to fall into the oblivion. The towns ultimate destruction took place in 1657 during the Swedish Deluge. Although Wi≈õlica remained the county capital until the end of the 18th century, it never regained its previous splendour. In 1795 it became part of Austria as a result of the Third Partition of Poland. From 1809 it was in the Duchy of Warsaw, then from 1815 in the Congress Poland under Russian rule, and again in independent Poland since 1918. Wi≈õlica lost its city charter in 1870, and it was again destroyed in the course of the First World War, in 1915. In 1939 during the Invasion of Poland heavy fighting occurred near the village. In the course of the German occupation that followed, Wi≈õlica's Jewish community perished in The Holocaust. Unfortunately, today Wi≈õlica is still forgotten and marginalised by bigger intellectual centres, but remains as a charming town which offers monuments of great artistic merit, of long traditions and memories of important historical events. On 1 January 2018 Wi≈õlica regained its city charter, thus becoming the smallest town in Poland. By comparison, the largest village in Poland (Kozy), had 12 529 inhabitants (as for 31.12.2013). Sights * Collegiate Basilica of the Birth of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Wi≈õlica was erected by king Kazimir the Great in 1350. It's the oldest and biggest two-aisled church in Poland.

Solomon (R-NY) sponsored a series of \\"Solomon amendments\\" that conditioned eligibility for federal financial aid for higher education and job training, federal government employment, and other federal benefits on certification by the individual that they either had registered with the Selective Service System or were not required to register.

The Supreme Court reversed that decision in Selective Service System v. Minnesota Public Interest Research Group (1984).James B. Jacobs, Socio-Legal Foundations of Civil-Military Relations (Transaction Publishers, 1986), 104-6, available online, accessed March 13, 2012 The Solomon Amendment relating to ROTC and military recruiting was passed in 1996.¬ß 541(a), Division A, Title V of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996, It denied federal grants from 8 federal agencies, including research grants, to colleges and universities that prohibit or prevent the U.S. armed forces from recruiting on campus in a manner \\"at least equal in quality and scope\\" as other employers or that fail to allow for ROTC programs as part of their academic programs subject to the same standards as other academic programs. It was recodified in 1999.¬ß 549(a)(1), Division A, Title V of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000, The law was amended in 2002 to cover recruiting by the Coast Guard as part of the Department of Homeland Security.¬ß 1704(b)(1) and ¬ß 1704(b)(3), Title XVII of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, It also provides an exception for any institution with \\"a longstanding policy of pacifism based on historical religious affiliation.\\" It was revised in later years, most importantly in 1999, when Rep. Barney Frank (D-MA) sponsored an exemption for financial aid funding (Pub L. 106-79 Sec. 8120), and again in 2001, when the Republican leadership of the House Armed Services Committee included language denying all federal funding to a university if any of its schools blocked access to recruiters. This alteration significantly strengthened the reach of the Solomon Amendment, since recruiters were most often denied access to law schools, which receive little federal money.  Constitutional challenge  Since 1991, the Association of American Law Schools, the principal consortium of United States law schools, required that all of its member institutions establish a policy prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and that member schools require the same policy of any employer to which it grants access for recruiting employees.New York Times: Linda Greenhouse, \\"U.S. Wins Ruling Over Recruiting at Universities,\\" March 7, 2006, accessed March 13, 2012 Many law schools used to oppose military recruitment on campus because the military's \\"don't ask, don't tell\\" policy denying employment in the military to open gays and lesbians contradicted their non-discrimination policies. In 2004, the U.S. Third Circuit Court of Appeals found for the Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights, a group representing law schools, led by Professor Kent Greenfield of Boston College Law School, opposed to the presence of military recruiters on campus.New York Times: Adam Liptak, \\"Colleges Can Bar Army Recruiters,\\" November 30, 2004, accessed March 13, 2012 On appeal, the U.S. Supreme Court in Rumsfeld v. FAIR upheld the Solomon Amendment in a unanimous decision[ Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights] on March 6, 2006. Chief Justice John Roberts, writing for the majority, wrote: \\"As a general matter, the Solomon Amendment regulates conduct, not speech. It affects what law schools must do‚Äîafford equal access to military recruiters‚Äînot what they may or may not say.\\" At least two institutions (Vermont Law School, and William Mitchell College of Law) have declined to allow military recruiting on campus in the past. Both positions were taken as a protest to the military's \\"don't ask, don't tell\\" policy. These schools receive little in way of federal funds compared to large research universities, making it more feasible to forgo the federal funding. With the repeal of \\"don't ask, don't tell\\" in 2011, both schools removed their bans on campus military recruiting.

Clarke, first published in 2001, is a collection of almost all science fiction stories written by Arthur C. Clarke. It includes 114 stories, arranged in order of publication, from \\"Travel by Wire!\\" in 1937 through to \\"Improving the Neighbourhood\\" in 1999. The story \\"Improving The Neighbourhood\\" has the distinction of being the first fiction published in the journal Nature. The titles \\"Venture to the Moon\\" and \\"The Other Side of the Sky\\" are not stories, but the titles of groups of six interconnected stories, each story with its own title. This collection is only missing a very few stories, for example \\"When the Twerms Came\\", which appears in his other collections More Than One Universe and The View from Serendip. This edition contains a foreword by Clarke written in 2000, where he speculates on the science fiction genre in relation to the concept of short stories. Furthermore, many of the stories have a short introduction about their publication history or literary nature. In addition to the printed edition, an audio edition was published by Fantastic Audio in 2001. The audio edition, comprising five volumes, runs nearly fifty hours. An electronic edition of the book was published in four volumes by RosettaBooks in 2012.

The missing ones are a movie outline of The Songs of Distant Earth (from \\"The Sentinel\\"; this is not the short story of the same name) and a short sketch titled \\"When the Twerms Came\\", which originally appeared in Clarke's non-fiction book The View from Serendip (1978) and was later reprinted in the 1987 edition of The Wind from the Sun. For the remaining nine pieces (2, 4, 17, 29, 30, 112, 114‚Äì116) this is either their first appearance in book form at all or first appearance in a book by Arthur C. Clarke. There are, however, two exceptions. \\"The Lion of Comarre\\" (no. 17), although published in magazine form as early as 1949, first appeared in book form in 1968, in an omnibus edition together with Clarke's early novel Against the Fall of the Night (1953). \\"The Steam-powered Word-Processor\\" (no. 112) had previously appeared in Clarke's \\"science-fictional autobiography\\" Astounding Days (1989).

There are three main branches of virotherapy: anti-cancer oncolytic viruses, viral vectors for gene therapy and viral immunotherapy. These branches utilize three different types of treatment methods: gene overexpression, gene knockout, and suicide gene delivery. Gene overexpression adds genetic sequences that compensate for low to zero levels of needed gene expression. Gene knockout utilizes RNA methods to silence or reduce expression of disease-causing genes. Suicide gene delivery introduces genetic sequences that induce an apoptotic response in cells, usually to kill cancerous growths. In a slightly different context, virotherapy can also refer more broadly to the use of viruses to treat certain medical conditions by killing pathogens. One more method; gene confusion, in this method we can introduce specific artificial receptor in by which virus can bind, and resulting severity can be minimised.eg; introduction CD4 receptor against HIV virus, Oncolytic virotherapy Oncolytic virotherapy is not a new idea ‚Äì as early as the mid 1950s doctors were noticing that cancer patients who suffered a non-related viral infection, or who had been vaccinated recently, showed signs of improvement; this has been largely attributed to the production of interferon and tumour necrosis factors in response to viral infection, but oncolytic viruses are being designed that selectively target and lyse only cancerous cells. In the 1940s and 1950s, studies were conducted in animal models to evaluate the use of viruses in the treatment of tumours. In the 1940s‚Äì1950s some of the earliest human clinical trials with oncolytic viruses were started. In 2015 the FDA approved the marketing of talimogene laherparepvec, a genetically engineered herpes virus, to treat melanoma lesions that cannot be operated on; it is injected directly into the lesion. As of 2016 there was no evidence that it extends the life of people with melanoma, or that it prevents metastasis. For label updates see FDA index page for BLA 125518 Two genes were removed from the virus ‚Äì one that shuts down an individual cell's defenses, and another that helps the virus evade the immune system ‚Äì and a gene for human GM-CSF was added. The drug works by replicating in cancer cells, causing them to burst; it was also designed to stimulate an immune response but as of 2016, there was no evidence of this. The drug was created and initially developed by BioVex, Inc. and was continued by Amgen, which acquired BioVex in 2011. It was the first oncolytic virus approved in the West. Viral gene therapy Viral gene therapy uses genetically engineered viral vectors to deliver a gene of interest to target cells. An AAV-based vector is shown in this example. Viral gene therapy uses genetically engineered viral vectors to deliver therapeutic genes to cells with genetic malfunctions. Typically, the virus is administered to patients intravenously or by direct injection into target tissues. The molecular mechanisms of gene delivery and/or integration into cells vary based on the viral vector that is used. There are many targets of viral gene therapy. While some therapies target the missing or mutated genes of inherited genetic disorders, others seek to deliver new genes to cancer cells in order to destroy tumors. Currently, immune responses to viral gene therapies pose a challenge to successful treatment. However, responses to viral vectors at immune privileged sites such as the eye may be reduced compared to other sites of the body. Viral immunotherapy Unlike traditional vaccines, in which attenuated or killed virus/bacteria is used to generate an immune response, viral immunotherapy uses genetically engineered viruses to present a specific antigen to the immune system. That antigen could be from any species of virus/bacteria or even human disease antigens, for example cancer antigens. Vaccines are another method of virotherapy that use attenuated or inactivated viruses to develop immunity to disease. An attenuated virus is a weakened virus that incites a natural immune response in the host that is often undetectable. The host also develops potentially life-long immunity due to the attenuated virus's similarity to the actual virus. Inactivated viruses are killed viruses that present a form of the antigen to the host. However, long- term immune response is limited. There are two general approaches to develop these viruses using applied evolutionary techniques: Jennerian and Pastorian. The Jennerian method involves selecting similar viruses from non-human organisms to protect against a human virus while Pastorian methods use serial passage. This Pastorian method is very similar to directive evolution of oncolytic viruses. Selected viruses that target humans are passed through multiple non-human organisms for multiple generations. Over time the viruses adapt to the foreign environments of their new hosts. These now maladapted viruses have minimal capacity for harming humans and are used as attenuated viruses for clinical use. An important consideration is to not reduce the replicative ability of the virus beyond the point where the immune system response will be compromised. A secondary immune response would therefore be insufficient to provide protection against the live virus should it be reintroduced to the host. Specific projects and products=Oncolytic viruses RIGVIR is a virotherapy drug that was approved by the State Agency of Medicines of the Republic of Latvia in 2004. It is wild type ECHO-7, a member of echovirus family. The potential use of echovirus as an oncolytic virus to treat cancer was discovered by Latvian scientist Aina Muceniece in the 1960s and 1970s. The data used to register the drug in Latvia is not sufficient to obtain approval to use it in the US, Europe, or Japan. As of 2017 there was no good evidence that RIGVIR is an effective cancer treatment. On March 19, 2019, the manufacturer of ECHO-7, SIA LATIMA, announced the drug's removal from sale in Latvia, quoting financial and strategic reasons and insufficient profitability. However, several days later an investigative TV show revealed that State Agency of Medicines had run laboratory tests on the vials, and found that the amount of ECHO-7 virus is of a much smaller amount than claimed by the manufacturer. According to agency's lab director, \\"It's like buying what you think is lemon juice, but finding that what you have is lemon-flavored water\\". In March 2019, the distribution of ECHO-7 in Latvia has been stopped. Viral gene therapy Currently, there are many viral gene therapy products in clinical trial phases. Listed below are the products that are (or were) approved for marketing in the US and/or European Union. * In 2012 the European Commission approved Glybera, an AAV vector-based gene therapy product for the treatment of lipoprotein lipase deficiency in adults. It was the first gene therapy approved in the EU. The drug never received FDA approval in the US, and was discontinued by its manufacturer uniQure in 2017 due to profitability concerns. it is no longer authorized for use in the EU. * In 2017, the FDA approved Spark Therapeutics' Luxturna, an AAV vector-based gene therapy product for the treatment of RPE65 mutation- associated retinal dystrophy in adults. Luxturna is the first gene therapy approved in the US for the treatment of a monogenetic disorder. It has been authorized for use in the EU since 2018. * In 2019, the FDA approved Zolgensma, an AAV vector-based gene therapy product for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy in children under the age of two. As of August 2019, it is the world's most expensive treatment, at a cost of over two million USD. Novartis is still seeking marketing approval for the drug in the EU as of 2019. Protozoal virotherapy Viruses have been explored as a means to treat infections caused by protozoa. One such protozoa that potential virotherapy treatments have explored is Naegleria fowleri which causes primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM). With a mortality rate of 95%, this disease- causing eukaryote has one of the highest pathogenic fatalities known. Chemotherapeutic agents that target this amoeba for treating PAM have difficulty crossing blood-brain barriers. However, the driven evolution of virulent viruses of protozoal pathogens (VVPPs) may be able to develop viral therapies that can more easily access this eukaryotic disease by crossing the blood-brain barrier in a process analogous to bacteriophages. These VVPPs would also be self-replicating and therefore require infrequent administration with lower doses, thus potentially reducing toxicity. While these treatment methods for protozoal disease may show great promise in a manner similar to bacteriophage viral therapy, a notable hazard is the evolutionary consequence of using viruses capable of eukaryotic pathogenicity. VVPPs will have evolved mechanisms of DNA insertion and replication that manipulate eukaryotic surface proteins and DNA editing proteins. VVPP engineering must therefore control for viruses that may be able to mutate and thereby bind to surface proteins and manipulate the DNA of the infected host. History Chester M. Southam, a researcher at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, pioneered the study of viruses as potential agents to treat cancer.

Front and side view of Type 1 Ho-Ha Development and history The Type 1 Ho-Ha was developed in 1941 as a result of a request from the army for a vehicle that could be used to transport a squad of infantry to the battlefield protected from enemy small arms fire. Despite experiences of the Second Sino-Japanese War, armored personnel carriers were viewed as too slow compared to wheeled trucks and there was not much effort for their development in the army.Japanese Armored Vehicles of the Second World War Production began in 1944 with the Type 1 Ho- Ha being an addition to the Type 1 Ho-Ki, an unrelated, yet similarly named armored tracked personnel carrier. The half-tracked Type 1 Ho-Ha was built by Hino Motors in unknown quantities. Design The Type 1 Ho-Ha was based on the German Sd.Kfz. 251/1 (known popularly as Hanomag), the main armoured personnel carrier of the German Army, but did not use the overlapped and interleaved road wheels of the German design's suspension. Further, it had a \\"vertical rear plate with a door\\", akin to the American M3 Half-track; however, the door itself was a copy of the German \\"two-leaf\\" design. The Type 1 Ho-Ha had a pair of road wheels in front, supported by a pair of short caterpillar tracks to the rear. It was equipped with a tow coupling in the front and a towing hitch at the rear to haul artillery or a supply trailer. The maximum armor thickness was 8 mm with sloping armor plates. As with the Type 1 Ho-Ki, the hull was welded construction and it was \\"open-topped\\". The Type 1 Ho-Ha carried three Type 97 light machine guns as standard armament, one on each side, just to the rear of the driver's compartment and a third mounted to the rear as an anti-aircraft weapon. All of these weapons had constricted firing arcs, which made firing directly forward or directly rearward impossible. Combat record and post-war The Type 1 Ho-Ha was initially deployed to China for operations in the ongoing Second Sino-Japanese War, but never in any great numbers. It was later deployed with the Japanese reinforcements in the Battle of the Philippines in 1944. Post-war, some Type 1 Ho-Ha half-tracks were modified by cutting off the rear armored section and replacing it with a flat bed. They were then used for reconstruction work in areas of the country.

Established by act of Congress on July 11, 1798, it is the oldest of the United States military bands and the oldest professional musical organization in the United States. Today, the Marine Band also includes the Marine Chamber Orchestra and Marine Chamber Ensembles. The Marine Band is entirely separate from its sister military band, the United States Marine Drum and Bugle Corps (\\"The Commandant's Own\\") and the 10 active duty Marine Corps field bands. The Marine Band has been uniquely known as \\"The President's Own\\" since 1801 due to the historic connection to the President of the United States. The relationship between the Marine Band and the White House began on New Year's Day 1801, when President John Adams invited the band to perform at the Executive Mansion. Later that year, Thomas Jefferson initiated the tradition of Marine Band performances by requesting that it perform at his inauguration. The Marine Band has played at every United States presidential inauguration since. President Thomas Jefferson gave the title \\"The President's Own\\" in 1801. This terminology emulated a long-established British usage, where various military units were designated as \\"King's Own\\" or \\"Queen's Own\\". Today, the Marine Band performs in approximately 500 events every year including state funerals, state arrival ceremonies, state dinners, parades, concerts, and other social events. The Marine Band also travels across the country each October and November during its fall concert tour, a tradition that began in 1891 under its most famous director, composer John Philip Sousa. Members and organization United States Marine Band uniforms The Marine Band recruits experienced musicians; members are selected through a rigorous audition procedure and must satisfy additional security and physical requirements to be eligible. Selected band members serve under a four-year contract as active duty enlisted Marines and are subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice and physical standards. Members of The President's Own and the United States Coast Guard Band are the only members of the United States Armed Forces not required to undergo recruit training and do not perform combat missions. Also, they are not assigned to any unit other than the Marine Band. Musicians of other Marine bands are required to attend boot camp and Marine Combat Training (MCT). The 'President's Own' band members start at the rank of Staff Sergeant, and wear rank insignia with a lyre replacing the normal crossed rifles. Commissioned officers are often drawn from within the band, although auditions are open to members of all Marine Corps bands. Drum majors are career Marines and are selected from the Marine Corps field bands, as they are responsible for the military development of the band's members. As of 2010, the USMC spends about $10 million annually to support the band.Pincus, Walter, \\"Defense Dept. Uses Thousands of Musicians, Spends Many Millions, To Strike Up The Bands\\", Washington Post, September 7, 2010, p. 13. In 2005, Sara Sheffield became the first female feature vocalist in the band's history. Performances The Marine Band marching down 15th Street during an inaugural parade held in honor of President Bill Clinton on January 20, 1997. Members of the Marine Band escorting the remains of President Ronald Reagan to the Capitol Rotunda during his state funeral held in June 2004.United States Marine Corps' 229th birthday at the Marine Corps War Memorial. The Marine Band's performance schedule is coordinated by the Marine Band Branch of Headquarters Marine Corps Public Affairs, which works with the Director of the Marine Band and the Marine Band Operations Office to schedule performances and ceremonies by the band, chamber orchestra, and chamber ensembles. The Marine Band also has a professional support staff (Library, Recording Lab, Stage Managers, and Stage Crew) as well as the Administration, Public Affairs, and Supply offices, who work to coordinate, promote, and facilitate performances throughout the year. The full band has a complement of about 130 members, although they all play together only rarely. A 42-piece band is used for all Pentagon and formal military arrivals and patriotic openers for large events. Patriotic openers are 15 minutes of patriotic music, including the presentation and retirement of the colors, \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\" (national anthem), and the \\"Marines' Hymn.\\" Patriotic openers are performed throughout the Washington metropolitan area at a variety of events for military organizations, federal agencies, and associations. Events that the Marine Band participates in include: *United States presidential inaugurations. The Marine Band has participated in every presidential inauguration since Thomas Jefferson's in 1801. The Marine Band is positioned at the United States Capitol for the swearing-in ceremony, and a 99-piece band marches in the inaugural parade back to the White House. The band also performs for celebrations following the official ceremony and parade. Celebrations are typically divided by state and held at hotels and in large public spaces throughout Washington D.C. *State funerals. The Military District of Washington Commander of Troops arranges the ceremonial preparations and for the funeral supervises the procession to the Washington National Cathedral in Northwest D.C. The Secretary of Defense conducts the funeral proceedings. A traditional components of the state funerals is a procession composed of National Guard, active-duty, academy, and reserve personnel that represent the five branches of the United States armed forces. A 99-piece band provides traditional music during each phase of the state funeral, often with other military bands. Previous funeral processions in the nation's capital have honored ten presidents. *State Arrival Ceremonies. The Marine Band performs during a State Arrival Ceremony at the White House, an event which welcomes a visiting head of state to the United States and begins a state visit. The United States Marine Band is located on the balcony of the South Portico, just outside the Blue Room. Following the ceremony, the Marine Band performs in the Cross Hall during the receiving line and reception. *Arlington National Cemetery military funerals. The Marine Band participates in every full honors military funeral for a deceased Marine at Arlington National Cemetery. During the funeral ceremony, the Marine Band performs chorales and hymns on every occasion that the deceased is transferred or moved. When the escorts and funeral procession move the deceased from a chapel or transfer site to the final resting place, a drum cadence and funeral marches are performed. \\"Marines' Hymn\\" is performed for the final transfer of the deceased onto the resting site. Following this, the deceased receives final honors and three volleys, and a lone bugler from the Marine Band performs \\"Taps.\\" At the conclusion of the funeral ceremony, an American flag is folded and presented to the family of the deceased, during which the Marine Band performs \\"Eternal Father, Strong to Save,\\" the Navy hymn. *Friday Evening Parades are held at Marine Barracks, Washington, D.C. during Friday evenings in summer (May through August). These 75-minute performances of music and precision marching, features the Marine Band along with the Drum and Bugle Corps, and the Silent Drill Platoon. The ceremony begins at 8:45 pm, with a concert by the Marine Band. *Other events. The Marine Band sometimes performs at additional events, such as state dinners and formal receptions at the White House, as well as performances at the National Sylvan Theater in Washington D.C. during the summer months. Leadership A violinist from the Marine Band performs during a reception at the residence of the Commandant of the Marine Corps on July 19, 2013.Drum Major of the United States Marine Band, Master Sergeant William L. Browne, wearing a bearskin headpiece and holding a ceremonial mace. The early leadership of the Marine Band consisted of both a Drum Major and a Fife Major, who wore identical uniforms. The Drum Major was considered the Leader of the Marine Band, while the Fife Major's responsibility was to train the fifers. The first leader of the United States Marine Band was William Farr, who is listed in historical records as having served as Drum Major from January 21, 1799. After the retirement of Drum Major Raphael Triay in 1855, then-Fife Major Francis Scala became Drum Major. On July 25, 1861, President Abraham Lincoln signed an Act of Congress to reorganize the Marine Band. This act abolished the rank of Fife Major (and in 1881 the fife was removed from Marine Corps instrumentation entirely), created the positions of Leader of the Band/Principal Musician, Drum Major, and authorized 30 musicians. Scala was the first Marine Band musician to receive the title \\"Leader of the Band\\"; John Roach was selected as Drum Major. The earliest recorded Second Leader of the United States Marine Band was Salvador Petrola. Marine Band cornetist Walter F. Smith, who had performed under 17th director, John Philip Sousa, became the first official Second Leader when an Act of Congress established the positions of First Leader and Second Leader of the Marine Band in March 1899. Many changes took place during the Dwight D. Eisenhower administration. The titles First Leader and Second Leader were replaced by Director and Assistant Director. When Albert F. Schoepper was appointed as Director in 1955, a second Assistant Director was added to the Marine Band leadership. Today, the Assistant Director positions are designated in two titles: Senior Assistant Director and Executive Officer, and Assistant Director. It is also during the Eisenhower administration that the first \\"Soloist and Moderator\\" was appointed. William D. Jones, known as the original soloist with the new US Air Force Band and originator and director of the Singing Sergeants, was transferred by an Act of Congress to the USMC Band and given the title \\"Ambassador of Music.\\" The Soloist and Moderator served as the senior enlisted member until 1972, when Schoepper and Jones retired. Today, the Drum Major serves as the senior enlisted member of \\"The President's Own\\" and is responsible for the band's appearance, ceremonial drill, and military decorum. He is charged with directing the band in ceremonies, including the inaugural parade, and regularly leads the band in review for presidents and visiting heads of state and other dignitaries. The Drum Major's uniform is unique; he wears a bearskin headpiece and carries a ceremonial mace used to signal commands to the musicians. The drum major also wears the officer's version of the Eagle, Globe, and Anchor (the Marine Corps emblem). He also wears an ornate baldric, similar to a sash, embroidered with the band's crest and the Marine Corps' battle honors, as well as miniatures of his own medals. Composers Sousa composed several of his finest marches, including Semper Fidelis, while serving as director of the Marine Band. Thomas Powell Knox joined the Marine Band in 1961 as a trumpet player and moved to the arranging staff in 1966. Three years later, Knox was appointed chief arranger and continued to compose and arrange for the Marine Band until his retirement in 1985. Some of his more notable compositions include \\"God of Our Fathers\\" (commissioned for Ronald Reagan's first inauguration) and \\"American Pageant,\\" which was commissioned for Richard Nixon's first inauguration. Knox arranged or composed over 300 pieces, many of which are still played by the Marine Band and other bands across America.

Opened in 1965, it is the home field of the NIU Huskies of the Mid-American Conference (MAC). Location Located on the west end of campus, Huskie Stadium is bordered by Stadium Drive to the south, the Yordon Athletic Center to the north, Mary Bell Field to the east, and Ralph McKinzie Field to the west. The playing field has a conventional north-south alignment at an elevation of above sea level. Stadium history=Early years Before the 1965 season, the Huskies played at Glidden Field, a 5,500-seat facility on the east end of campus. However, after quarterback George Bork lead them to an AP small college national championship in 1963, they began the construction of Huskie Stadium. Marred by construction setbacks that put the opening day two months behind schedule, the stadium played host to its first official NIU football game on November 6, when the Huskies defeated the Illinois State Redbirds, 48‚Äì6. Through 1968, the playing surface was natural grass. In 1969, the home opener against Idaho on September 20 marked the state's first major college gridiron contest played on artificial turf, and the Huskies won the night game, 47‚Äì30. The field was re-carpeted in 1980 and 1990 before the introduction of infilled FieldTurf in 2001. The stadium originally consisted of the main concrete west stands (which used to contain practice facilities for the gymnastics and wrestling teams) and much smaller temporary stands on the east side. The east side was completely redone in 1995, creating a steel structure to mirror the concrete one. The university has maintained and enhanced the institution's all-around athletics facility, updating the scoreboard and video display system in both 2000 and 2001, and creating the South End Zone berm in 2002. In 2003, the field was renamed \\"Brigham Field\\" in honor of Robert J. Brigham, a former NIU player, coach, and athletic director. The stadium was also the site of a few NCAA records. Against Fresno State in 1990, quarterback Stacey Robinson rushed for 287 yards in the first half, and finished with 308 overall, as NIU upset the 24th-ranked Bulldogs 73‚Äì18. In that game on October 6, the Huskies established school records for rushing yards (733), total offense (806), and first downs (36). It was also the first victory over a ranked opponent at the stadium. In 2013, Jordan Lynch rushed for 321 yards on November 26, setting an FBS record for most rushing yards in a game by a quarterback. Recent years The Huskies have experienced large amounts of success in the national spotlight, defeating the Alabama Crimson Tide, the Iowa State Cyclones,Purdue, Northwestern, Nebraska, and the Maryland Terrapins. Because of the Huskies success, NIU averaged the highest attendance per game in the MAC between 2004-2006. In recent years, the football program has generated national headlines for the institution. With seven consecutive winning seasons (best in the MAC), NIU has the 25th best record in the nation since 2000 (53-30)---including triumphs over Bowl Championship Series programs such as Wake Forest, Minnesota, University of Alabama, Kansas, University of Maryland, Purdue University (2009, 2013), Iowa, and Iowa State University among others. The Huskies finished ranked in the Top 30 during the 2003 and 2004 seasons and defeated Troy University, 34-21, in the 2004 Silicon Valley Football Classic. In 2006, NIU faced off against TCU in the Poinsettia Bowl in San Diego, California making it the second time in three years NIU had gone to a postseason bowl game. The Huskies made it four bowls in six years with a trip to the International Bowl in 2010 against the University of South Florida. Later, in 2012, they became the first non-AQ team with one loss to go to a BCS bowl game (Orange Bowl). With the addition of the Yordon Athletic Center, the total capacity for the stadium has decreased to 23,595. In 2013, Huskie Stadium in its current seating format recorded two sellouts in the year. This was the first time since 2003 the Huskies recorded a sellout at the stadium. Planned renovation NIU plans to renovate Huskie Stadium. Following its renovation, the stadium will have a horseshoe shape, with end zone seating added to the south side of the stadium. The capacity will be raised to between 30,000 and 35,000, with the potential to expand it further to 42,000 in the future. The gymnastics and wrestling practice areas housed within the stadium will be moved to make room on the west side for a full concourse, more concessions, and more easily accessible restrooms. The east side will hold new luxury seating sections, including suites, double suites, loge box seating, a club lounge, as well as both indoor and outdoor club seats. Naming rights for the stadium might be sold after its renovation. With a capacity somewhere between 30,000 and 35,000, the renovation will make Huskie Stadium amongst the MAC's largest in capacity. Both InfoCision Stadium (Akron) and Waldo Stadium (Western Michigan) hold 30,000; Rynearson Stadium (Eastern Michigan) holds 30,200; Kelly/Shorts Stadium (Central Michigan) holds 30,255. The only three of the venues mentioned that are in the West Division of the MAC alongside the Huskies are Waldo Stadium, Rynearson Stadium, and Kelly/Shorts Stadium, meaning that post-renovation, Huskie Stadium will quite possibly be the largest stadium in the division, if not the MAC. In the announcement of the planned renovations, athletic director Sean Frazier commented, ‚ÄúWe always want more seats, but we also people to fill those seats\\"...\\"We want something very intimate. We have a great, great facility right now. What we want to do is build off of that. When that thing is full nobody wants to play in Huskie Stadium. It is definitely a difference-maker when you‚Äôre out there.‚Äù The renovations will be part of a $138 million overhaul to NIU's athletic facilities. As part of this overhaul, Ralph McKinzie Field, located just west of Huskie Stadium, will be replaced by a new artificial-turf baseball stadium to be built northeast of the Convocation Center and south of the Outdoor Recreation Sports Complex. A tennis facility featuring four indoor courts and locker rooms will be built to the west of the Chessick Practice Center and house NIU's tennis teams. An 'Olympic sports facility' containing practice areas for golf, gymnastics and wrestling, as well as locker rooms for multiple sports, will be built to the west of the tennis facility. The wrestling and gymnastics practice areas will replace those currently housed within Huskie Stadium. The Convocation Center will have a ring built behind the seating area to connect the lobbies on the north and south sides, allowing fans to walk from one side of the venue to the other using the concourse. Mary M. Bell Field will see an increase from 650 seats to 1,000 seats, and will also be given new restrooms, concessions and locker rooms. Yordon Athletic Center In 2005, it was announced that the NIU Academic and Athletic Performance Center, a new field house and athletic training facility, would be built in the north end zone. At a press conference in conjunction with the annual NIU Spring Football Game, first-year Athletics Director Jim Phillips announced on April 23, 2005, that Huskie Intercollegiate Athletics would embark on the largest capital project in its history. Located at the north end zone, NIU began breaking ground for the new $14-million all-purpose facility in the fall of 2006, with the construction finishing the following summer and opening in August 2007. Inside the Jeffrey and Kimberly Yordon Center Jeffrey and Kimberly Yordon Center is a football locker room with a gathering area, a strength and conditioning center (largest in the MAC), an academic support center, athletic training room with rehab pools, a 150-seat meeting room, video editing room, all ten coaches' offices, football equipment room, coaches' locker room, and computer classrooms for student-athletes. Chessick Practice Center In October 2013, NIU opened their indoor Chessick Practice Center. The practice center features a full-size 120-yard practice field with two end zones and overrun buffer space around the field for safety. The practice room itself is , with in the adjoining Barsema Hall of Champions, and can house practice equipment for the NIU football, baseball, softball, and soccer teams.

It is the home field of the Air Force Falcons of the Mountain West Conference, and also holds the academy's graduation ceremonies each spring. History From 1956 to 1961, Air Force played its home games at various sites along the Front Range in Colorado.cfbdatawarehouse.com, 1956 data cfbdatawarehouse.com, 1960 data Most games were played in Denver at the University of Denver's stadium, but several were played in Colorado Springs, Pueblo, and CU's Folsom Field in Boulder.MacCambridge, Michael, ed. ESPN College Football Encyclopedia. New York: Hyperion, 2005. Pg. 68. Planned in 1955, Falcon Stadium opened in 1962, at a cost of $3.5 million, and has a current seating capacity of 46,692. The first game was on September 22, a 34‚Äì0 victory over Colorado State. It was officially dedicated four weeks later on October 20, with a ceremony which included the Thunderbirds. Construction The U.S. Air Force Academy lies at the base of the Rampart Range of the Rocky Mountains, northwest of adjacent Colorado Springs. Built into a natural bowl about two miles (3 km) southeast and below the cadet area, Falcon Stadium is approximately a mile west of Interstate 25. With an unbalanced design and a traditional north‚Äìsouth alignment, the western sideline has the press box and two large grandstand tiers above the main bowl; the eastern side has a single tier, bordered by seven separate sections of grandstands. Elevation The FieldTurf playing field is at an elevation of above sea level,Topographic map from USGS via Microsoft Research Maps the second highest in FBS college football, exceeded only by conference foe Wyoming's War Memorial Stadium in Laramie, which is higher. The Walkup Skydome at FCS Northern Arizona in Flagstaff is also slightly higher, by . In Division II, the Mountaineer Bowl of Western State Colorado in Gunnison exceeds them all at . The elevation was essential for preparing the 2017 New England Patriot's trip to the 2017 NFL Mexico Game at Estadio Azteca in Mexico City. As the stadium sits at an altitude of 7,200 feet (2195 meters) above sea level, Bill Belichick decided the elevation at Falcon Stadium was best for the Patriots to practice in preparation for the thin air in Mexico City. Same was the case for the 2018 Los Angeles Rams, however, the 2018 game was eventually cancelled because of poor field conditions at Azteca. Improvements Falcon Stadium had a natural grass field for its first 44 years, although the sideline areas where teams stood were artificial turf since the 1980s. Prior to the 2006 season, synthetic FieldTurf was installed at a cost of $750,000. The stadium has been expanded twice, and the 2005 renovation lowered the total seating capacity. Permanent lighting was installed in Falcon Stadium in 2002 at a cost of $500,000, and the video screen at the south end of the field debuted in 2004. A new sound system was also installed for the 2006 season. The scoreboard was removed after the 2015 season, and a new, larger video board measuring tall by wide, with a total surface area of more than . At its installation in 2016, it was the largest in the Mountain West Conference and amongst the service academies. A second video board was also installed behind the northeast stands prior to the 2016 season.

San Onofre includes San Onofre Bluffs and Beach areas; San Onofre Surf Beach, a day-use facility; San Mateo campgrounds and day-use facility; and Trestles, accessible via a nature trail from San Mateo Campgrounds. Alcohol is banned from all beaches within the park. The park includes a marshy area where San Mateo Creek meets the shoreline and Trestles, a surfing site. Whales, dolphins, and sea lions can be seen offshore. The park‚Äôs coastal terrace is chaparral-covered. Surfing After Sunset A surfing and fishing camp had been there since the 1920s, before the U.S. government established Camp Pendleton, a U.S. Marine training camp during World War II. Surfers using redwood boards have visited San Onofre since at least the 1940s, including Lorrin \\"Whitey\\" Harrison, Don Okey, Al Dowden, Tom Wilson, and Bob Simmons.San Onofre Surfing Club: History of the San Onofre Surfing Club (1974). San Onofre has several surf breaks on its of coast: * Trestles, a world-famous surfing area known for its consistent waves * Church, near Camp Pendleton‚Äôs beach resort, provides sunbathing and duck watching * Surf Beach, divided into three breaks spots known as The Point, Old Man‚Äôs, and Dogpatch * Trails, the southernmost surf spot in this region, includes both rock bottom and sandy breaks Panhe Panhe at San Onofre is an Acjachemen village that is over 8,000 years old and a current sacred, ceremonial, cultural, and burial site for the Acjachemen people. Many Acjachemen people trace their lineage back to Panhe. It is the site of the first baptism in California, and in 1769 saw the first close contact between Spanish explorers, Catholic missionaries, and the Acjachemen people. The United Coalition to Protect Panhe and The City Project advocate for the preservation of the site. In keeping with the Padres‚Äô tradition of naming areas after patron saints, this area was named after the obscure Egyptian, St. Onuphrius. Toll road controversy On November 10, 2016, the Transportation Corridor Agency abandoned plans to build a six-lane toll highway through San Onofre State Beach, other nearby sensitive environmental areas, and certain Native American cultural sites. The announcement brings to an end more than 10 years of effort to build through these areas. The abandonment of this route for the toll road was part of an agreement ending several lawsuits filed by the California attorney general and a coalition of environmental groups that sought to block the project.

It is primarily used for football. The stadium opened in 1927 and holds 50,500 people. It is located near the center of campus at the University of North Carolina. History The previous home of the Tar Heels was Emerson Field, which opened in 1916 on the current site of Davis Library. By 1925, it was obvious that that 2,400-seat facility was not adequate for the increasing crowds. Expansion was quickly ruled out since the baseball team also used it. Any new football seats would have also been too far away for baseball. Funding for the stadium was originally supposed to come from alumni donations. William R. Kenan, Jr., a UNC alumnus, scientist, industrialist and dairy farmer from Lockport, New York who would later become a prominent businessman in Miami, got word of the initial plans and donated a large gift to build the stadium and an adjoining field house. Kenan was an 1894 UNC graduate and grandson of one of UNC's original trustees. Kenan persuaded UNC to build the stadium as a memorial to his parents, William R. Kenan and Mary Hargrave Kenan. Local architect TC Atwood designed the stadium; he would later design Georgia's Sanford Stadium along lines similar to Kenan. For instance, Sanford's famous hedges were copied from Kenan. Ground was broken in November 1926. The stadium was completed in August 1927. At the time, it was located on the far southern portion of campus, but expansions over the years have resulted in the stadium now being near the center of campus. The stadium officially opened on November 24, 1927. The Tar Heels defeated Davidson College 27-0, with the first touchdown in the new stadium by Edison Foard. The first game at Kenan Stadium brought in 9,000 spectators. It was officially dedicated to the Kenan family on Thanksgiving Day in 1927 in front of 28,000 fans, after the Tar Heels beat the Virginia Cavaliers 14-13. Kenan Memorial Stadium in 1959 The original stadium‚Äîthe lower level of the current stadium's sideline seats‚Äîseated 24,000 people. However, temporary bleachers were added to the end zones to accommodate overflow crowds, allowing Kenan to accommodate over 40,000 people at times. This happened fairly often over the years, especially during the Choo Choo Justice era of the late 1940s. The largest crowd to see a game at Kenan‚Äîand the largest to see a game on- campus in the state of North Carolina‚Äîwas a standing-room-only throng of 62,000 when the Tar Heels hosted the Florida State Seminoles in 1997. The largest paid crowd was a crowd of 62,000 that saw the Tar Heels face Duke in 2013. The 1991 season opener versus Cincinnati and the Clemson game, which was televised nationally by ESPN, were UNC's first true night home games in school history. The Tar Heels football team sold out every game from 1992 to 1999, and also sold out all but one game of Butch Davis's tenure. Most of the west end zone and three sections of the south stands are reserved for students. The student section of the west end zone is popularly known as the \\"Tar Pit\\"‚Äîa name applied to the entire stadium during the late 1990s. From 2007 to 2010, fireworks were shot from atop Kenan Field House whenever the Tar Heels took the field, as well as after every score and win. They were removed in 2011, but reinstated in 2012 after Larry Fedora's arrival, and for the next three seasons were shot off behind the west end zone. Dedication change William R. Kenan, to whom the stadium was dedicated since its construction in 1927, \\"was the commander of a white supremacist paramilitary force, which massacred scores of black residents in Wilmington, on a single day in 1898.\\" In 2018 the University decided to remove the plaque on the stadium mentioning him, and to designate the stadium as named for his son William R. Kenan Jr. Renovations and expansions The stadium in 1971 The stadium was first expanded in 1963, when Kenan (who died in 1965) donated $1 million to double- deck the sideline seats and add permanent bleachers to the end zones, expanding capacity to 48,000. A seating adjustment in 1979 boosted capacity to 50,000. In 1988, the old press box and chancellor's box were replaced by 2,000 seats between the 40-yard lines, expanding capacity to 52,000. Part of the 1987-88 project were a permanent lighting system, a chancellor's lounge on the north side of the field and a football lettermen's lounge on the south side. The lights are part of a General Electric low-mount system which minimizes the height of the lightpoles. Cost of the entire project was $7 million. It was funded by private gifts and bonds. The stadium's biggest renovation project to date took place from 1995 to 1998. Head coach Mack Brown wanted a better facility to showcase a resurgent football program, which had gone from consecutive 1-10 seasons in 1988 and 1989 to a run of success not approached since the 1940s. The stadium was lacking in many areas. For instance, Kenan was one of the few Division I stadiums not to have permanent seating in at least one end zone; the only end zone seats at the time were the portable bleachers added in 1963. Also, the locker rooms were somewhat cramped by 1990s standards. Several generous gifts resulted in the addition of a new playing field and a brand-new facility for the football team, the Frank H. Kenan Football Center, named for the great-grandson of the stadium's original benefactor. The Kenan Center included a memorabilia section showcasing the football program's history. The most visible addition, however, was 8,000 new seats in the west end zone, which turned the stadium into a horseshoe. Also added was a \\"preferred seating box\\" atop the north stands. Due to state law, only 6,000 of the new end zone seats were available in 1997. Capacity dropped to 48,500 in 1996, but leaped to 57,800 in 1997. The other 2,200 seats were added in 1998, bringing the stadium to a capacity of 60,000, not eclipsed until the 2011 season. In 2003, a modern scoreboard with video capability was added in front of Kenan Field House. The next addition came before the 2007 season, when the old matrix boards on the sidelines were replaced with ribbon boards. The West End Zone addition in 1998 created a horseshoe. In December 2006, the Chapel Hill Town Council approved changes to UNC's development plan that included at least 8,800 additional seats for Kenan Stadium. In October 2007, athletic director Dick Baddour announced plans for extensive renovations to Kenan Stadium. Plans called for a new academic support center in place of Kenan Field House, plus anywhere from 5,000 to 15,000 additional seats. The new seats would be added in the east end zone, turning the stadium into a bowl. Plans would have to be approved by the chancellor and the board of trustees, and would almost certainly require a fundraising effort by the Rams Club. No specific timetable was set, but Baddour said that he hoped to begin construction within 18 months. This \\"masterplan\\" was divided into two phases; phase one covering the west end zone and two covering the east end zone. The first phase consisted of adding a fifth floor (for recruiting and media space) along with remodeling the existing offices and team spaces in the Kenan Football Center. Approved on July 23, 2008, by the Board of Trustees for $50 million, Phase I renovations were completed on August for the 2009 Football Season. A third and final phase of the project was also planned. This includes new club-level seats around the perimeter of the stadium, a new suite level above the club seats, a much larger press box, and a brick facade encircling the outside of the stadium. Construction of this phase has not been scheduled, however, due to budgetary constraints. The Loudermilk Center in the east end zone, which turned the stadium into a bowl. Includes the Blue Zone. On May 27, 2010, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Board of Trustees approved the immediate commencement on construction of the \\"Carolina Student- Athlete Center for Excellence\\", a $70 million expansion that would replace Kenan Field House. The entire project was funded by private donations and the selling of club seats and individual suites. This facility would be a combination of an academic center, \\"Carolina Leadership Academy\\", Olympic sports' strength and conditioning center, and visitor lockers within a span of two floors. However, the most significantly visible portion of the renovation was the addition of 2,980 seats. The additional seats in the end zone, named the Blue Zone, would be \\"1,836 seats in the Concourse Club just a few feet from the field, 824 seats in the Upper Club/Loge on the fourth floor and 320 seats in 20 suites on the fifth floor\\". The individual suites, each of which has 16 seats, will sell for $50,000 per year. Each seat in the club levels range from $750 to $2,500 per season. Furthermore, the construction of a new concourse in front of the Carolina Student-Athlete Center for Excellence would allow fans to move around the entire perimeter of Kenan Stadium for the first time. The exterior of the new section is similar in appearance to the Bell Tower. The 2011 renovation and expansion fully enclosed the stadium for the first time in its history. This facility houses the Loudermilk Center for Student Excellence as well as 3,000 additional premium club, suite seating and lounge areas in the east end zone, bringing total stadium capacity to 63,000. As part of this addition, HD video boards were installed on each end of the stadium. In 2016, new ribbon boards and updated concessions were added. In 2018, the metal bleachers that had been in place for almost half a century were replaced with individual seats, reducing capacity to 50,500.https://goheels.com/news/2018/1/7/football-individual-seats-coming-in- kenan-stadium.aspx The stadium switched the playing surface from natural grass to a RootZone synthetic grass surface manufactured by AstroTurf for the 2019 season.https://goheels.com/news/2019/3/25/football-north-carolina-to-install- synthetic-grass-in-kenan-stadium.aspx See also * List of NCAA Division I FBS football stadiums ReferencesExternal links *Kenan Memorial Stadium Information (from official UNC athletic site) *Satellite photo of Kenan Memorial Stadium Category:American football venues in North Carolina Category:College football venues Category:College lacrosse venues in the United States Category:Lacrosse venues in North Carolina Category:North Carolina Tar Heels football Category:North Carolina Tar Heels sports venues Category:Sports venues completed in 1927 Category:1927 establishments in North Carolina ","title":"Kenan Memorial Stadium"},{"id":"1874050","text":"Coming of Age in Samoa is a book by American anthropologist Margaret Mead based upon her research and study of youth ‚Äì primarily adolescent girls ‚Äì on the island of Ta'u in the Samoan Islands. The book details the sexual life of teenagers in Samoan society in the early 20th century, and theorizes that culture has a leading influence on psychosexual development. First published in 1928, the book launched Mead as a pioneering researcher and as the most famous anthropologist in the world. Since its first publication, Coming of Age in Samoa was the most widely read book in the field of anthropology until Napoleon Chagnon's Yanomam√∂: The Fierce People overtook it. The book has sparked years of ongoing and intense debate and controversy on questions pertaining to society, culture, and science. It is a key text in the nature versus nurture debate, as well as in discussions on issues relating to family, adolescence, gender, social norms, and attitudes. In the 1980s, Derek Freeman contested many of Mead's claims, and argued that she was hoaxed into counterfactually believing that Samoan culture had more relaxed sexual norms than Western culture. However, the anthropology community on the whole has rejected Freeman's claims, concluding that Freeman cherry-picked his data, and misrepresented both Mead's research and the interviews that he conducted.  Content =Foreword In the foreword to Coming of Age in Samoa, Mead's advisor, Franz Boas, writes: > \\"Courtesy, modesty, good manners, conformity to definite ethical standards > are universal, but what constitutes courtesy, modesty, good manners, and > definite ethical standards is not universal. It is instructive to know that > standards differ in the most unexpected ways.\\" Franz Boas (ca 1915, age 57) Boas went on to point out that, at the time of publication, many Americans had begun to discuss the problems faced by young people (particularly women) as they pass through adolescence as \\"unavoidable periods of adjustment\\". Boas felt that a study of the problems faced by adolescents in another culture would be illuminating. Introduction Margaret Mead (ca 1930 to 1950, age 30s or 40s) Mead introduces the book with a general discussion of the problems facing adolescents in modern society and the various approaches to understanding these problems: religion, philosophy, educational theory, and psychology. She discusses various limitations in each approach and then introduces the new field of anthropology as a promising alternative science based on analyzing social structures and dynamics. She contrasts the methodology of the anthropologist with other scientific studies of behavior and the obvious reasons that controlled experiments are so much more difficult for anthropology than other sciences. For this reason her methodology is one of studying societies in their natural environment. Rather than select a culture that is fairly well understood such as Europe or America, she chooses South Sea island people because their culture is radically different from Western culture and likely to yield more useful data as a result. However, in doing so she introduces new complexity in that she must first understand and communicate to her readers the nature of South Sea culture itself rather than delve directly into issues of adolescence as she could in a more familiar culture. Once she has an understanding of Samoan culture she will delve into the specifics of how adolescent education and socialization are carried out in Samoan culture and contrast it with Western culture. Mead described the goal of her research as follows: > \\"I have tried to answer the question which sent me to Samoa: Are the > disturbances which vex our adolescents due to the nature of adolescence > itself or to the civilization? Under different conditions does adolescence > present a different picture?\\" To answer this question, she conducted her study among a small group of Samoans. She found a village of 600 people on the island of Ta'≈´, in which, over a period of between six and nine months, she got to know, lived with, observed, and interviewed (having learnt some Samoan) 68 young women between the ages of 9 and 20. Mead studied daily living, education, social structures and dynamics, rituals, etiquette, etc. Samoan life and education Mead begins with the description of a typical idyllic day in Samoa. She then describes child education, starting with the birth of children, which is celebrated with a lengthy ritual feast. After birth, however, Mead describes how children are mostly ignored, for girl children sometimes explicitly ritually ignored, after birth up to puberty. She describes the various methods of disciplining children. Most involve some sort of corporal punishment, such as hitting with hands, palm fronds, or shells. However, the punishment is mostly ritualistic and not meant to inflict serious harm. Children are expected to contribute meaningful work from a very early age. Initially, young children of both sexes help to care for infants. As the children grow older, however, the education of the boys shifts to fishing, while the girls focus more on child care. However, the concept of age for the Samoans is not the same as in the West. Samoans do not keep track of birth days, and they judge maturity not on actual number of years alive, but rather on the outward physical changes in the child. As a child gets bigger and stronger, he or she gets more work and responsibility. Mead describes some specific skills the children must learn related to weaving and fishing, and then almost casually interjects the first description of Samoan sexuality, saying that in addition to work for adolescent girls: \\"All of her [additional] interest is expended on clandestine sex adventures.\\" This comes directly after a passage where Mead describes how a reputation for laziness can make an adolescent girl a poor candidate for marriage, implying that for Samoans a work ethic is a more important criterion for marriage than virginity. Male adolescents undergo various kinds of both encouragement and punishment to make them competitive and aggressive. Males have many different possible jobs (e.g., \\"a house builder, a fisherman, an orator, a wood carver\\") in the community. Status is also a balance between prowess and achievement and appearing humble. Also, \\"social prestige is increased by his amorous exploits\\". For the adolescent girls, status is primarily a question of whom they will marry. Mead also describes adolescence and the time before marriage as the high point of a Samoan girl's life: > \\"But the seventeen year old girl does not wish to marry ‚Äì not yet. It is > better to live as a girl with no responsibility, and a rich variety of > experience. This is the best period of her life.\\" Samoan household The next section describes the structure of a Samoan village: \\"a Samoan village is made up of some thirty to forty households, each of which is presided over by a head man\\". Each household is an extended family including widows and widowers. The household shares houses communally: each household has several houses but no members have ownership or permanent residence of any specific building. The houses may not all be within the same part of the village. The head man of the household has ultimate authority over the group. Mead describes how the extended family provides security and safety for Samoan children. Children are likely to be near relatives no matter where they are, and any child that is missing will be found quite rapidly. The household also provides freedom for children including girls. According to Mead, if a girl is unhappy with the particular relatives she happens to live with, she can always simply move to a different home within the same household. Mead also describes the various and fairly complex status relations which are a combination of factors such as role in the household, the household's status within the village, the age of the individual, etc. There are also many rules of etiquette for requesting and granting favors. Samoan social structures and rules Samoan female ceremonial dancer (Thomas Andrew, ) Mead describes the many group structures and dynamics within Samoan culture. The forming of groups is an important part of Samoan life from early childhood when young children form groups for play and mischief. There are several different kinds of possible group structures in Samoan culture. Relations flow down from chiefs and heads of households; men designate another man to be their aid and surrogate in courting rituals; men form groups for fishing and other work activities; women form groups based on tasks such as child caring and household relations. Mead describes examples of such groups and describes the complex rules that govern how they are formed and how they function. Her emphasis is on Samoan adolescent girls, but as elsewhere she needs to also describe Samoan social structures for the entire culture to give a complete picture. Mead believes that the complex and mandatory rules that govern these various groups mean that the traditional Western concept of friendship as a bond entered into voluntarily by two people with compatible interests is all but meaningless for Samoan girls: \\"friendship is so patterned as to be meaningless. I once asked a young married woman if a neighbor with whom she was always upon the most uncertain and irritated terms was a friend of hers. 'Why, of course, her mother's father's father, and my father's mother's father were brothers. The ritual requirements (such as being able to remember specifics about family relations and roles) are far greater for men than women. This also translates into significantly more responsibility being put on men than women: \\"a man who commits adultery with a chief's wife was beaten and banished, sometime even drowned by the outraged community, but the woman was only cast out by her husband\\". Mead devotes a whole chapter to Samoan music and the role of dancing and singing in Samoan culture. She views these as significant because they violate the norms of what Samoans define as good behavior in all other activities and provide a unique outlet for Samoans to express their individuality. According to Mead there is normally no greater social failing than demonstrating an excess of pride, or as the Samoans describe it, \\"presuming above one's age\\". However, this is not the case when it comes to singing and dancing. In these activities, individuality and creativity are the most highly praised attributes, and children are free to express themselves to the fullest extent of their capabilities rather than being concerned with appropriate behavior based on age and status:  Personality, sexuality, and old age Mead describes the psychology of the individual Samoan as being simpler, more honest, and less driven by sexual neuroses than the west. She describes Samoans as being much more comfortable with issues such as menstruation and more casual about non-monogamous sexual relations. Part of the reason for this is the extended family structure of Samoan villages. Conflicts that might result in arguments or breaks within a traditional Western family can be defused in Samoan families simply by having one of the parties to the conflict relocate to a different home that is part of the household within the village. Another reason Mead cites is that Samoans do not seem eager to give judgmental answers to questions. Mead describes how one of the things that made her research difficult was that Samoans would often answer just about every question with non-committal answers, the Samoan equivalent to shrugging one's shoulders and saying: \\"Who knows?\\" Portrait of three Samoan girls (Thomas Andrew, ) Mead concludes the section of the book dealing with Samoan life with a description of Samoan old age. Samoan women in old age \\"are usually more of a power within the household than the old men. The men rule partly by the authority conferred by their titles, but their wives and sisters rule by force of personality and knowledge of human nature.\\"  Educational problems: American and Samoan contrasts  Mead concluded that the passage from childhood to adulthood (adolescence) in Samoa was a smooth transition and not marked by the emotional or psychological distress, anxiety, or confusion seen in the United States. Mead concluded that this was due to the Samoan girl's belonging to a stable, monocultural society, surrounded by role models, and where nothing concerning the basic human facts of copulation, birth, bodily functions, or death, was hidden. The Samoan girl was not pressured to choose from among a variety of conflicting values, as was the American girl. Mead commented, somewhat satirically: > ... [an American] girl's father may be a Presbyterian, an imperialist, a > vegetarian, a teetotaller, with a strong literary preference for Edmund > Burke, a believer in the open shop and a high tariff, who believes that > women's place is in the home, that young girls should wear corsets, not roll > their stockings, not smoke, nor go riding with young men in the evening. But > her mother's father may be a Low Episcopalian, a believer in high living, a > strong advocate of States' Rights and the Monroe Doctrine, who reads > Rabelais, likes to go to musical shows and horse races. Her aunt is an > agnostic, an ardent advocate of women's rights, an internationalist who > rests all her hopes on Esperanto, is devoted to Bernard Shaw, and spends her > spare time in campaigns of anti-vivisection. Her elder brother, whom she > admires exceedingly, has just spent two years at Oxford. He is an Anglo- > Catholic, an enthusiast concerning all things medieval, writes mystical > poetry, reads Chesterton, and means to devote his life to seeking for the > lost secret of medieval stained glass. Her mother's younger brother ...  Reception  On publication, the book generated a great deal of coverage both in the academic world and in the popular press. Mead's publisher (William Morrow) had lined up many endorsements from well known academics such as anthropologist Bronislaw Malinowski and psychologist John Watson. Their praise was a major public relations coup for Morrow and drew popular attention to the book. Academic interest was soon followed by sensational headlines such as \\"Samoa is the Place for Women\\" and that Samoa is \\"Where Neuroses Cease\\". Impact on anthropology For most anthropologists before Mead, detailed immersive fieldwork was not a common practice. Although subsequent reviews of her work have revealed faults by the standards of modern anthropology, at the time the book was published the idea of living with native people was fairly ground breaking. The use of cross-cultural comparison to highlight issues within Western society was highly influential and contributed greatly to the heightened awareness of anthropology and ethnographic study in the United States. It established Mead as a substantial figure in American anthropology, a position she would maintain for the next fifty years. Social influences and reactions As Boas and Mead expected, this book upset many Westerners when it first appeared in 1928. Many American readers felt shocked by her observation that young Samoan women deferred marriage for many years while enjoying casual sex before eventually choosing a husband. As a landmark study regarding sexual mores, the book was highly controversial and frequently came under attack on ideological grounds. For example, the National Catholic Register argued that Mead‚Äôs findings were merely a projection of her own sexual beliefs and reflected her desire to eliminate restrictions on her own sexuality. The Intercollegiate Studies Institute listed Coming of Age in Samoa as #1 on its list of the \\"50 Worst Books of the Twentieth Century\\". Critique of Mead's methodology and conclusions Although Coming of Age received significant interest and praise from the academic community, Mead's research methodology also came in for criticism from several reviewers and fellow anthropologists. Mead was criticized for not separating her personal speculation and opinions from her ethnographic description of Samoan life and for making sweeping generalizations based on a relatively short period of study. For example, Nels Anderson wrote about the book: \\"If it is science, the book is somewhat of a disappointment. It lacks a documental base. It is given too much to interpretation instead of description. Dr. Mead forgets too often that that she is an anthropologist and gets her own personality involved with her materials.\\" Shortly after Mead‚Äôs death, Derek Freeman published a book, Margaret Mead and Samoa, that claimed Mead failed to apply the scientific method and that her assertions were unsupported. This criticism is dealt with in detail in the section below.  The Mead‚ÄìFreeman controversy  Derek Freeman Freeman's 1983 book In 1983, five years after Mead had died, Derek Freeman ‚Äì a New Zealand anthropologist who lived in Samoa ‚Äì published Margaret Mead and Samoa: The Making and Unmaking of an Anthropological Myth, in which he challenged all of Mead's major findings. In 1988, he participated in the filming of Margaret Mead and Samoa, directed by Frank Heimans, which claims to document one of Mead's original informants, now an elderly woman, swearing that the information she and her friend provided Mead when they were teenagers was false; one of the girls would say of Mead on videotape years later: Another of Mead's statements on which Freeman focused was her claim that through the use of chicken blood, Samoan girls could and do lie about their status of virginity. Freeman pointed out that virginity of the bride is so crucial to the status of Samoan men that they have a specific ritual in which the bride's hymen is manually ruptured in public, by the groom himself or by the chief, making deception via chicken blood impossible. On this ground, Freeman argued that Mead must have based her account on (false) hearsay from non-Samoan sources. The argument hinged on the place of the taupou system in Samoan society. According to Mead, the taupou system is one of institutionalized virginity for young women of high rank, and it is exclusive to women of high rank. According to Freeman, all Samoan women emulated the taupou system, and Mead's informants denied having engaged in casual sex as young women and claimed that they had lied to Mead. Anthropological reception and reactions After an initial flurry of discussion, many anthropologists concluded that Freeman systematically misrepresented Mead's views on the relationship between nature and nurture, as well as the data on Samoan culture. According to Freeman's colleague Robin Fox, Freeman \\"seemed to have a special place in hell reserved for Margaret Mead, for reasons not at all clear at that time\\". Moreover, many field and comparative studies by anthropologists have since found that adolescence is not experienced in the same way in all societies. Systematic cross-cultural study of adolescence by Schlegel and Barry, for example, concluded that adolescents experience harmonious relations with their families in most non- industrialized societies around the world. They find that, when family members need each other throughout their lives, independence, as expressed in adolescent rebelliousness, is minimal and counterproductive. Adolescents are likely to be rebellious only in industrialized societies practicing neolocal residence patterns (in which young adults must move their residence away from their parents). Neolocal residence patterns result from young adults living in industrial societies who move to take new jobs or in similar geographically mobile populations. Thus, Mead's analysis of adolescent conflict is upheld in the comparative literature on societies worldwide.See Appell (1984), Brady (1991), Feinberg (1988), Leacock (1988), Levy (1984), Marshall (1993), Nardi (1984), Patience and Smith (1986), Paxman (1988), Scheper-Hughes (1984), Shankman (1996), and Young and Juan (1985). First, these critics have speculated that he waited until Mead died before publishing his critique so that she would not be able to respond. However, in 1978, Freeman sent a revised manuscript to Mead, but she was ill and died a few months later without responding. Second, Freeman's critics point out that, by the time he arrived on the scene, Mead's original informants were old women, grandmothers, and had converted to Christianity, so their testimony to him may not have been accurate. They further argue that Samoan culture had changed considerably in the decades following Mead's original research; after intense missionary activity, many Samoans had come to adopt the same sexual standards as the Americans who were once so shocked by Mead's book. They suggested that such women, in this new context, were unlikely to speak frankly about their adolescent behavior. Further, they suggested that these women might not be as forthright and honest about their sexuality when speaking to an elderly man as they would have been speaking to a woman near their own age. Some anthropologists criticized Freeman on methodological and empirical grounds. For example, they stated that Freeman had conflated publicly articulated ideals with behavioral norms ‚Äì that is, while many Samoan women would admit in public that it is ideal to remain a virgin, in practice they engaged in high levels of premarital sex and boasted about their sexual affairs among themselves. Freeman's own data documented the existence of premarital sexual activity in Samoa. In a western Samoan village, he documented that 20% of 15 year-olds, 30% of 16 year-olds, and 40% of 17 year-olds had engaged in premarital sex. In 1983, the American Anthropological Association held a special session to discuss Freeman's book, to which they did not invite him. Their criticism was made formal at the 82nd annual meeting of the American Anthropological Association the next month in Chicago, where a special session, to which Freeman was not invited, was held to discuss his book. They passed a motion declaring Freeman's Margaret Mead and Samoa \\"poorly written, unscientific, irresponsible, and misleading\\". Freeman commented that \\"to seek to dispose of a major scientific issue by a show of hands is a striking demonstration of the way in which belief can come to dominate the thinking of scholars\\". In the years that followed, anthropologists vigorously debated these issues. Two scholars who published on the issue include Appell, who stated \\"I found Freeman's argument to be completely convincing\\"; and Brady, who stated \\"Freeman's book discovers little but tends to reinforce what many anthropologists already suspected\\" regarding the adequacy of Mead's ethnography.Brady (1991) They were supported by several others.Appell (1984), Brady (1991), Feinberg (1988), Leacock (1988), Levy (1984), Marshall (1993), Nardi (1984), Patience and Smith (1986), Paxman (1988), Scheper-Hughes (1984), Shankman (1996), Young and Juan (1985), and Shankman (2009). Much like Mead's work, Freeman's account has been challenged as being ideologically driven to support his own theoretical viewpoint (sociobiology and interactionism), as well as assigning Mead a high degree of gullibility and bias. Freeman's refutation of Samoan sexual mores has been challenged, in turn, as being based on public declarations of sexual morality, virginity, and taupou rather than on actual sexual practices within Samoan society during the period of Mead's research. Lowell Holmes ‚Äì who completed a lesser-publicized re-study ‚Äì commented later: \\"Mead was better able to identify with, and therefore establish rapport with, adolescents and young adults on issues of sexuality than either I (at age 29, married with a wife and child) or Freeman, ten years my senior.\\"Holmes & Holmes (1992) In 1996, Martin Orans published his review of Mead's notes preserved at the Library of Congress, crediting her for leaving all her recorded data as available to the general public. Orans concludes that Freeman's basic criticism (that Mead was duped by ceremonial virgin Fa'apua'a Fa'amu who later swore to Freeman that she had played a joke on Mead) was false for several reasons: first, Mead was well aware of the forms and frequency of Samoan joking; second, she provided a careful account of the sexual restrictions on ceremonial virgins that corresponds to Fa'apua'a Fa'amu's account to Freeman; and third, that Mead's notes make clear that she had reached her conclusions about Samoan sexuality before meeting Fa'apua'a Fa'amu. He therefore concludes, contrary to Freeman, that Mead was never the victim of a hoax. Orans points out that Mead's data supports several different conclusions, and that Mead's conclusions hinge on an interpretive, rather than positivist, approach to culture. Orans concludes that due to Mead's interpretive approach ‚Äì common to most contemporary cultural anthropology ‚Äì her hypotheses and conclusions are essentially unfalsifiable and therefore \\"not even wrong\\". Freeman's 1998 book In 1998, Freeman published another book The Fateful Hoaxing of Margaret Mead. It included new material, in particular interviews that Freeman called of \\"exceptional historical significance\\" and \\"of quite fundamental importance\\" of one of Mead's then- adolescent informants by a Samoan chief from the National University of Samoa (in 1988 and 1993) and of her daughter (in 1995). Correspondence of 1925‚Äì1926 between Franz Boas and Margaret Mead was also newly available to Freeman. He concludes in the introduction to the book that \\"her exciting revelations about sexual behavior were in some cases merely the extrapolations of whispered intimacies, whereas those of greatest consequence were the results of a prankish hoax\\". Freeman argues that Mead collected other evidence that contradicts her own conclusion, such as a tutor who related that as of puberty girls were always escorted by female family members. He also claims that because of a decision to take ethnological trips to Fitiuta, only eight weeks remained for her primary research into adolescent girls, and it was now \\"practically impossible\\" to find time with the sixty-six girls she was to study, because the government school had reopened. With the remaining time, she instead went to Ofu, and the bulk of her research came from speaking with her two Samoan female companions, Fa'apua'a and Fofoa. Freeman claims Mead's letters to Boas reflect that she was influenced by studies of sexuality from Marquesas Islands, and that she was seeking to confirm the same information by questioning Fa'apua'a and Fofoa. She sent her conclusions to Boas on March 14 and with \\"little left to do\\" she cut short her trip. Freeman claimed that \\"no systematic, firsthand investigation of the sexual behavior of her sample of adolescent girls was ever to be undertaken. Instead, Margaret Mead's account of adolescent sexual behavior in Coming of Age in Samoa and elsewhere was based on what she had been told by Fa'apua'a and Fofoa, supplemented by other such inquiries that she had previously made.\\" As Fa'apua'a told Freeman, in her 80s, that she and her friend had been joking, Freeman defends her testimony in the introduction of his second book about Mead: Both that the octagenarian's memory was very good, and that she swore on the Bible, as a Christian, that it was true. In 2009, a detailed review of the controversy was published by Paul Shankman. It supports the contention that Mead's research was essentially correct, and concludes that Freeman cherry-picked his data and misrepresented both Mead and Samoan culture.

County Lock in 1975 with Simonds' Brewery in background. County Lock is a lock on the River Kennet in Reading town centre in the English county of Berkshire. It is now administered by the Canal & River Trust as part of the Kennet and Avon Canal. Downstream from the lock is Brewery Gut, a particularly fast flowing, narrow and dangerous stretch of the river. County Lock has the lowest rise of the locks on the Kennet, as boats only rise or fall about 30 cm (1 foot) in the lock. The main stream of the Kennet flows down the weir on the far side of the lock, while another arm of the Kennet disappears under the Bridge Street Roundabout. The first County Lock was built between 1718 and 1723, during the navigation works undertaken under the supervision of the engineer John Hore of Newbury in order to create the Kennet Navigation between Reading and Newbury. Initially the lock was located on the north side of the river, adjacent to Bear Wharf, but it was relocated to its current location on the south bank as part of the Reading waterworks improvement scheme of 1876. The land on both sides of the river adjacent to County Lock was formerly part of the site of Simonds' Brewery. Brewery Gut takes its name from the brewery. In the days of horse haulage, this stretch of river had no towpath, and a long tow line had to be sent down- river on a specially designed float. To add to the difficulty, at its narrowest the gut is only wide, causing strong currents. Multiple vessels cannot safely pass due to the tortuous and narrow route, and there have been instances in the past of boats colliding and sinking. Today passage through the gut is controlled by traffic lights. Simonds' Brewery closed in the late 1970s, and most of the brewery buildings have been demolished. Around the lock itself they have been replaced by a mixture of apartments and offices, although the brewery's old stable building, which overlooks the lock, has been preserved and was formerly occupied by a Loch Fyne restaurant. The part of the brewery that enveloped Brewery Gut has been replaced by The Oracle shopping centre, and boats can be seen navigating through the middle of the Riverside Level of that complex, lined on both sides by restaurants and pubs.

Kibbie-ASUI Activity Center (commonly known as the Kibbie Dome) is a multi-purpose indoor athletic stadium in the northwest United States, on the campus of the University of Idaho in Moscow, Idaho. It is the home of the Idaho Vandals and is used for intercollegiate competition in five sports: football, basketball, tennis, indoor track and field, and soccer. The Kibbie Dome opened as an outdoor concrete football stadium in October 1971, built on the same site of the demolished wooden Neale Stadium (1937‚Äì68), seen in this early 1950s photo. Following the 1974 football season, a barrel-arched roof and vertical end walls were added in ten months and the stadium re-opened as an enclosed facility in September 1975. With just 16,000 permanent seats, it was the second smallest home stadium for college football in Division I FBS (formerly Division I-A), but Idaho football has rejoined the FCS and is a member of the Big Sky Conference. Since February the Kibbie Dome has been reconfigured for basketball games and is referred to as the Cowan Spectrum, seating 7,000. The elevation of the playing surface is above History=Construction The stadium was built in stages and took several years to complete. Originally, the new football stadium was to be outdoors and seat over 23,000 spectators, with an adjacent 10,000-seat indoor arena for basketball. The Pacific Coast Athletic Association (PCAA), known since 1988 as the Big West Conference, had been launched in 1969 and Idaho was attempting to join, but political wrangling in the state legislature and subsequent budget cuts caused a change in the scope of the stadium project. This ensured that Idaho could not make the move to the PCAA; the Vandals remained in the Big Sky Conference with the other state schools, Idaho State and new member Boise State. Idaho eventually joined the Big West in 1996. The revised plan was for a smaller capacity football stadium, to be enclosed to allow use as a basketball arena (and indoor track and tennis as well). This multi-purpose concept had been recently used at Idaho State in Pocatello, where Holt Arena had opened as the Minidome in 1970. Construction on the concrete grandstands started in February 1971,lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/uibldngs.html#K after a fire destroyed the previously condemned wooden Neale Stadium in November 1969.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/uibldngs.html#N The stadium, which opened in 1937, had been condemned in August 1969 due to soil erosion beneath the grandstands. The Vandal football team played its limited home schedule for the next two seasons at WSU's Rogers Field in Pullman. After a fire significantly damaged Rogers Field's south grandstand in April 1970, WSU moved all of its 1970 and 1971 home games to Joe Albi Stadium in Spokane, but the Vandals remained at Rogers in Pullman for four \\"home\\" games in 1970. The Vandals' game with WSU on September 19 in Spokane was dubbed the A lopsided for the Cougars, it was WSU's only victory in a stretch of 22 games. Back in Moscow, weather-related construction delays in the spring put the new \\"Idaho Stadium\\" a month behind The Vandals played their first two \\"home\\" games in 1971 well away from campus, in Boise for the opener and Spokane two weeks later. Uncompleted, the stadium debuted on October 9 with a victory over Idaho State first football game on campus in nearly The Vandals went in 1971, which included a school-record eight-game winning streak, and won the Big Sky title. For its first four seasons the stadium was outdoors and In the summer of 1972, a Tartan Turf field was installed over a asphalt with a roll-up mechanism behind the west end zone; the one-piece field was the first in the world. In November 1974, approval was finally granted by the board of regents to enclose and vertical end walls were completed in time for the 1975 season's home opener on September 27, a deflating to Idaho State in front The enclosed stadium was renamed that year for William H. Kibbie, a construction executive from Salt Lake City and a primary benefactor of the project; he contributed $300,000 in 1974 to initiate the funding drive. Bill Kibbie (1918‚Äì1988), originally of Bellevue in Blaine County, was a UI student for less than a month in 1936 when he withdrew due to his He entered the construction business, then served as a B-24 pilot in World War II, and eventually founded JELCO in 1957, later EMKO, a major contracting company in Utah. The acronym \\"ASUI\\" is for the \\"Associated Students of the University of Idaho,\\" the student government. When the university announced it would enclose its football stadium, the fledgling Trus-Joist Company of Boise bid on and won the project. While steel and aluminum were the products of the day for domes and large unsupported buildings, Trus-Joist saw the UI stadium as a chance to demonstrate the strength, durability, and economy of their engineered wood products. From the final design to the end of construction, the enclosure project took just ten months and $1 million to complete. In 1976, the Kibbie Dome roof won the \\"Structural Engineering Achievement Award\\" from the American Society of Civil Engineers.idahoptv.org/outdoors/shows/designingidaho/troutneressay.html TJ International, the successor to Trus-Joist, was acquired by Weyerhaeuser Renovations Following the first indoor football season, the asphalt base underneath the field was covered with Tartan polyurethane in January 1976. The first basketball game was played on January 21, and the inaugural Vandal Invitational indoor track meet was held three days later. The Kibbie Dome's roof spans from sideline-to-sideline, and its maximum height is above the hashmarks. (Holt Arena, completed in 1970 on the campus of Idaho State University in Pocatello, has an opposite geometry: its arched roof spans the length of the football field, rather than its width, resulting in a very low roof at the end lines and goal posts.) Soon after completion in 1975, problems arose with the roof's exterior. The outer surface of Hypalon and underlying polyurethane foam were improperly applied and a second attempt to seal the roof with Diathon in the late 1970s did not succeed. Leaks were occurring and wood rot was a potential problem by 1980. An infrared scan of the roof in the spring of 1981 showed that half of it was moist and the insulating foam was in poor condition. Various stopgap measures were taken to stop the leaks in 1981. After an extended period of finger-pointing and threatened legal action, an out-of-court settlement was reached. A new superstructure with a composite roof was built over the original. Completed in the fall of 1982, coinciding with the completion of the East End Addition, the second roof shielded the first and solved the problem. Football The Kibbie Dome officially seats 16,000 for football. By the end of Idaho's tenure in Division I FBS (formerly Division I-A) in the 2017 season, it was the second-smallest FBS venue. A record crowd of 19,878 was recorded for the eighth consecutive rivalry game victory over Boise State in November 1989, during the schools' I-AA Big Sky era. The football field runs an unorthodox east‚Äìwest, but even with the new translucent upper end walls (2009 and 2011), sun location is not a major visibility issue. For two and a half seasons, 1999 to 2001, the Vandals used WSU's Martin Stadium in nearby Pullman as its home field, as Idaho transitioned back to Division I-A from Division I-AA. When Dennis Erickson returned as head coach in 2006, there was talk of adding a second deck to the Kibbie Dome to increase the football seating to 25,000, and building a new basketball arena. In February 2007, the state board of education appropriated funds to study expansion possibilities. On December 6, the board approved funding to begin design work for $52 million in improvements, including an expansion to 20,000 seats, lowering the elevation of the playing field, and other various safety and spectator improvements.idahostatesman.com/vandalsports/story/231555.html However, the capacity was ultimately never expanded beyond its nominal 16,000. When not used for football, the former AstroTurf football field was rolled up in about an hour to reveal of polyurethane tartan surface, used for indoor tennis and track & field. The five-lane track is in length, and 9 tennis courts are lined on its infield. Basketball and volleyball courts are also lined on the tartan infield. The AstroTurf was spooled onto a large field-width reel at the base of the west wall. In 1990, the original synthetic turf (3M Tartan Turf) of 1972 was replaced after 18 seasons, which included three years outdoors. At this time, the goal posts were modified and attached to the walls, eliminating the center support post. In the summer of 2007, the Kibbie Dome's AstroTurf was replaced with RealGrass Pro, a next-generation infilled synthetic turf similar to Field Turf.govandals.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=17100&ATCLID;=1136611 Unlike the carpet-like AstroTurf, the infilled synthetic turf is not easily rolled up in a continuous reel, and must be removed in sections. The turf sections are in width, running from sideline to sideline, attached to each other with velcro. Other stadiums with RealGrass Pro include Texas Stadium (the former home of the Dallas Cowboys), and the Alamodome in San Antonio. Life and safety upgrades to the Kibbie Dome began in the spring of 2009. The west wall was replaced with a non-combustible construction assembly; translucent plastic panels on the upper half and opaque metal siding on the lower. Concurrent with the end-wall replacement, a range of interior life safety work took place: field level exiting in the new west wall, addition of handrails in the seating aisles, provision of the required smoke exhaust systems; and other life safety and code mitigation improvements. The second phase of the project was completed in 2011 with the replacement of the east wall. A premium seating area (Litehouse Center) was established in 2011 in the former press box area above the south grandstand; a new press box was constructed above the north grandstand. Basketball The stadium has also served as the home of the Vandal basketball teams, providing increased seating capacity over the venerable Memorial Gym (built in 1928), a block to the east. The basketball court is positioned at midfield on the south sideline, in front of the press box and the south grandstand, with temporary seating on the north, east, and west. The first basketball game was played against WSU on January 21, 1976, commemorated with an alumni game which included Vandal great The main court was originally smooth tartan rubber, poured directly onto the pavement floor, resulting in a very hard and unforgiving surface, but resulted in a tremendous home court advantage under head coach Don Monson in the early 1980s. After nine seasons, it was replaced with a conventional hardwood floor in the fall of 1984, acquired from the University of Arizona in Tucson. During basketball games, the converted Kibbie Dome is now referred to as the Cowan Spectrum, named for Bob and Jan Cowan, who financed the current configuration. Since February the new basketball layout has been separated from the rest of the stadium by massive black curtains to give the court a more intimate \\"stadium- within-a-stadium\\" feel, with a reduced seating capacity of 7,000. Temporary OES scoreboards are placed over the north and south stands during games. (video) During the early 1980s, with Don Monson as head coach, the Kibbie Dome was considered one of the 20 toughest home courts in college basketball by Sports Illustrated. Additional temporary seating was gradually increased on the north basketball sideline (center of the football field) and attendance exceeded 11,000 for several games during the 1982‚Äì83 season. From January 1980 to February 1983, the Vandals won 43 consecutive home games, and Monson's home record in his final four seasons was 51‚Äì2 (). A Big Sky record attendance of 11,800 witnessed the streak end against Montana. The venue hosted three Big Sky Conference men's basketball tournaments (by winning the regular season title), in 1981, 1982, and 1993. (The Vandals departed the Big Sky for the Big West in 1996, then to the WAC in 2005 before returning its non-football sports to the Big Sky in 2014, and football in 2018.) Idaho is now preparing to build the new Idaho Central Credit Union Arena, north of the Kibbie Dome, to house men's and women's basketball, plus women's volleyball. The 4,200-seat venue is currently scheduled to open in time for volleyball in the fall of 2021. Additions The east side of the Kibbie Dome features the East End Addition (center), the Vandal Athletic Center (right), and SprinTurf practice fields. (2008) Since its enclosure in 1975, the Kibbie Dome has undergone several significant additions. The East End Addition was completed in the fall of 1982, providing the entire athletic department with locker rooms, offices, a weight room, athletic training facility, and equipment room. The formal dedication and open house for the $3.9 million addition was held in late October. Until the addition, the football and basketball teams, both Vandals and visitors, dressed in the Memorial Gym and made the lengthy walk (or run) west to the Kibbie Dome, often in rain or snow. This had been the practice for UI football for over 40 years, since the opening of Neale Stadium in 1937. Bill Kibbie also made a significant donation for this project in 1979. In April 2004, the facilities were again enhanced with the addition of the Vandal Athletic Center, designed by Opsis Architecture, home to the Norm and Becky Iverson Speed and Strength Center; the renovation of the men's and women's basketball, football, and volleyball locker rooms, and the addition of a state-of-the-art hydrotherapy pool (ARC).govandals.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=17100&KEY;=&ATCLID;=1257088 Adjacent practice fields Kibbie Dome from the far west in 2007 August 2005 saw the installation of infilled SprinTurf on the former natural grass practice field east of the Kibbie Dome. The days of \\"off-limits\\" were eliminated, as UI students acquired state-of-the-art playing fields available for year-round use. A field that previously had just 300 usable hours annually as an \\"intercollegiate athletics only\\" field (primarily for natural turf varsity football practice), is now available for up to 2,000 hours per year. The project was funded through the Kibbie Dome turf replacement fund; the $1.2 million SprinTurf project included lighting and fencing. The two fields are adequate for team practice for football (and soccer, lacrosse, rugby, and other sports) as well as for intramural competition, but short enough to have two fields in the space available. Each field is a full half-field (with end zone & goal post) plus an additional beyond the 50-yard line. An unmarked median separates the two fields; the total length, with end zones, is and runs north‚Äìsouth. The former natural turf fields were lined as a regulation football field running north‚Äìsouth, with a half field at the north end running east‚Äìwest. An added benefit of the synthetic surface is an estimated $50,000 annual savings in field maintenance costs. Nearby facilities On the west side of the Kibbie Dome is the Dan O'Brien outdoor track & field stadium, which hosted its first meet in 1972, and was renamed in 1996 for the Olympic gold medalist world champion and former world record holder in the decathlon. A concrete grandstand at the finish area (southeast corner) has a seating capacity of 1,000. The first all-weather surface lasted less than a decade and was replaced in 1980. The facility underwent a major renovation in 2011 to host the 2012 WAC outdoor championships.University of Idaho ‚Äì Facilities Services ‚Äì Dan O'Brien Track Complex Renovation ‚Äì accessed 2011-11-20 South of the Dome is the university's 18-hole golf course, a challenging track due to its rolling Palouse terrain.

During the 18th century, a wire mill was built on the south side of the canal, on an island between the canal navigation and the natural course of the Kennet. This mill was supplied with bar iron from Sowley Forge in Hampshire; both sites were operated by Charles Pocock Sr., Thomas Golden and Charles Pocock Jr. In 1850, a pumping station was built on the north side of the canal. The station was used to pump water to the Bath Road Reservoir in Reading to cater for the town's population expansion and provided the town its first filtered water supply. By 1878, maps showed that the wire mill was disused; the Pocock‚ÄìGolden partnership had been dissolved over half a century earlier. In 1896, the Southcote Water Works (owned by the Reading Corporation) was superseded by the newly upgraded steam-powered station downstream at Fobney; Southcote's water wheels and pumps were mothballed. Three years later, however, the Southcote works were overhauled and new filters and pipes were installed. In 1952, Southcote Lock was deemed unsafe and was subsequently closed. The navigation reopened by the mid-1970s. The pumping station was in use until 1982 when Fobney was upgraded to cope with the town's demand; the main pumping building was converted into a residential dwelling and the wire mill remained derelict.

Woods in \\"Transition Network Grammars for Natural Language Analysis\\" claims that by adding a recursive mechanism to a finite state model, parsing can be achieved much more efficiently. Instead of building an automaton for a particular sentence, a collection of transition graphs are built. A grammatically correct sentence is parsed by reaching a final state in any state graph. Transitions between these graphs are simply subroutine calls from one state to any initial state on any graph in the network. A sentence is determined to be grammatically correct if a final state is reached by the last word in the sentence. This model meets many of the goals set forth by the nature of language in that it captures the regularities of the language. That is, if there is a process that operates in a number of environments, the grammar should encapsulate the process in a single structure. Such encapsulation not only simplifies the grammar, but has the added bonus of efficiency of operation. Another advantage of such a model is the ability to postpone decisions. Many grammars use guessing when an ambiguity comes up. This means that not enough is yet known about the sentence. By the use of recursion, ATNs solve this inefficiency by postponing decisions until more is known about a sentence.

The character primarily appears in the \\"MC2\\" future of the Marvel Universe. He was created by Tom DeFalco and Pat Olliffe and first appeared in Spider-Girl #2. (November 1998) Fictional character biography Reilly Tyne is the son of Ben Reilly (Spider-Man's clone) and Elizabeth Tyne. Before he reached his teens, his inherited powers began to manifest but brought with them clonal degeneration. Kaine, the degenerated first clone of Peter Parker, found him, and placed him within a regeneration tank to slow the process. Kaine's efforts were for two goals: to resurrect Daredevil, who had previously died saving Kaine, and to heal Tyne. Kaine summoned the demon Zarathos, which attempted to possess Tyne, but he was saved by the soul of Daredevil, who drove out Zarathos, although both Daredevil's soul and a piece of the demon remained within Tyne, and he was left with a demonic appearance and certain demonic abilities. Through meditation and concentration, Tyne eventually learned to project a human appearance, but he now looked to be in his twenties, almost twice his actual age. Following in both of Daredevil's paths, he studied law and became an attorney, while taking on a costume bearing a resemblance to Daredevil's and using his demonic abilities to fight crime as Darkdevil. He apparently has access to at least some of Daredevil's memories, since he knows Spider-Man's secret identity.Darkdevil #1-3 Darkdevil has fought alongside Spider-Girl several times, as well as the semi-retired Spider-Man. Neither Spider-Man nor Spider-Girl are aware of his genetic relation to them, but Darkdevil has hinted that he owes his existence to the original Daredevil, Spider-Man, and Kaine.Spider-Girl #17 Mary Jane noticed Reilly at Normie Osborn and Brenda Drago's wedding party and attempted to point out to her husband the boy that resembled him. Peter Parker cluelessly mentions that Reilly resembles Tobey Maguire,Spider-Girl #82 a sly nod by writers to the fact that Maguire played Spider-Man in three films. When Doc Magus, Sorcerer Supreme (successor to Doctor Strange), delved into Darkdevil's mind, he found it had three inhabitants: Reilly himself as a young teen, Daredevil, and Zarathos in the form of Ghost Rider.Last Hero Standing #1-5 Recently he has been seen working alongside Kaine, going as far as to refer to the man as Uncle Kaine, thus confirming that he is fully aware of his relation to both Kaine, Spider-Girl and her father Peter Parker. During a clone debacle which resulted in there being two May Parkers (one being a symbiote hybrid), Darkdevil assists Spider- Girl in her rescue attempt only to be confronted by the Goblin Queen and the clone Spider-Girl.Spectacular Spider-Girl #7 Powers and abilities Darkdevil possesses augmented levels of strength, speed, agility and reflexes, along with the ability to cling to solid surfaces. He also possesses an ability similar to Spider-Man‚Äôs spider-sense which allows him to detect immediate danger to himself. Due to his connection with the demon Zarathos, who is imprisoned in his body, he can also teleport, change his appearance from demon to human, manifest flaming constructs, such as billy clubs, and the ability to turn any part of his body into flame. Darkdevil is also an excellent hand-to-hand combatant and free style fighter, due to his link to the original Daredevil's soul. In his civilian guise as Reily Tyne, he is also a skilled and respected lawyer, much like Daredevil's alter-ego: Matt Murdock.

It is now home to the Schaumburg Boomers of the Frontier League which began play in May 2012 and captured the first-ever professional baseball championship for Schaumburg in 2013. It is primarily used for baseball, and was the home field of the Schaumburg Flyers baseball team from 1999 through 2010 before the Boomers resurrected the facility for pro baseball in 2012. Wintrust Field opened in 1999 and the park holds 7,365 people for a baseball game or over 10,000 for a concert or other non-baseball event. Its field dimensions mimic those of Chicago's Wrigley Field, and the land the stadium is built on was originally purchased in the mid-1980s as a hopeful site for the New Wrigley Field, had the City of Chicago and the Chicago Cubs not come to terms to bring night baseball to the North Side. Some pro lacrosse as well as professional and amateur softball has also been played at Wintrust Field due to the late start (mid-May) of the independent baseball season. The Stadium itself is located west of I-355 off the Elgin-O'Hare Expressway. Now called Wintrust Field, the Alexian Brothers Medical Center in nearby Elk Grove purchased the naming rights to the ballpark in 2000. The Stadium was host to the Schaumburg Flyers from its opening through the end of the 2010 season. At that point, the village and park district which owned the stadium began eviction proceedings against the Flyers for failure to pay $551,800 in back rent. On February 24, 2011, a Cook County court ruled the Flyers could be evicted, ordered the now defunct team to pay the back rent, and the naming rights contract was terminated when there was no professional baseball played in the park in 2011. From 2009 to 2010, the Wheaton College Thunder, a Division III baseball program, played its home games at Wintrust Field, and since 2008 the Dominican University Stars another Division III baseball program has played a majority of it home games at Wintrust Field. In 2011, the Roosevelt Lakers, an NAIA baseball program, played its home games at the stadium as well. Later that year, in September 2011, Chicago attorney Patrick A. Salvi was awarded ownership of a Frontier League franchise that began play in May 2012. Salvi is also the owner of the American Association's Gary SouthShore RailCats. The franchise is known as the Schaumburg Boomers named after the \\"booming dance\\" of the male Greater Prairie Chicken and the team earned a 54‚Äì42 record during its Inaugural Season, falling one win short of a playoff berth. In just the franchise's second season in 2013, the Schaumburg Boomers captured the first-ever pro baseball championship for the Village of Schaumburg in impressive fashion. After capturing the league's best record in the regular season (59-37), the Boomers became the first team in the Frontier League's 14-year history to sweep through the playoffs with a 6‚Äì0 record en route to claiming the 2013 Frontier League Championship. In doing so, the Boomers made good on a promise to win title in the \\"first 100 years or your money back.\\" The guarantee was featured on a billboard announcing the new team in March 2012 before the club's first season got underway. In October 2019, the Village of Schaumburg purchased the portion of the stadium which was owned by Schaumburg Park District for $1 million, becoming sole owner of the stadium. It was the Chicago White Sox's alternate training site in 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic forced the cancellation of the Frontier League campaign and the abbreviation of the Major League Baseball season.Dykstra, Sam. \\"Roundup: Major League alternate training sites,\\" Minor League Baseball, Thursday, July 16, 2020.

Preparation of the firing supports Some of the shapes made in the small-scale slipcasting workshop of the manufacture nationale de S√®vres Slipcasting or slip casting is a ceramic forming technique for pottery and other ceramics, especially for shapes not easily made on a wheel. In slipcasting, a liquid clay body slip (usually mixed in a blunger) is poured into plaster moulds and allowed to form a layer, the cast, on the inside walls of the mould. The process usually takes at least 24 hours per piece. It gives very precise and consistent shapes, and is now the most common technique used for commercial mass-produced pottery, although it began as a technique for fine pottery, especially porcelain. In a solid cast mould, ceramic objects such as handles and plates are surrounded by plaster on all sides with a reservoir for slip, and are removed when the solid piece is held within. For a hollow cast mould, for objects such as vases and cups, once the plaster has absorbed most of the liquid from the outside layer of clay the remaining slip is poured off for later use. After a period for further absorption of water, the cast piece is removed from the mould once it is leather-hard, that is, firm enough to handle without losing its shape. It is then \\"fettled\\" (trimmed neatly) and allowed to dry out further, usually overnight or for several hours. This produces a greenware piece which is then ready to be decorated, glazed and fired in a kiln.Osborne, Harold (ed), The Oxford Companion to the Decorative Arts, p. 746, 1975, OUP, The technique is suited to the production of complex shapes, especially if with relief decoration and thin walls. Much modern fine factory porcelain is made by the technique, very often the entire production. It is also commonly used for sanitaryware, such as toilets and basins, and smaller pieces like figurines and teapots.Osborne, Harold (ed), The Oxford Companion to the Decorative Arts, p. 746, 1975, OUP, The technique can also be used for small-scale production runs or to produce limited edition, one off objects, especially reproductions of antique dolls and modern porcelain doll-making. An additive with deflocculant properties, such as sodium silicate, can be added to the slip to disperse the raw material particles. This allows a higher solid content to be used, or allows a fluid slip to be produced with a minimum of water so that drying shrinkage is minimised, which is important during slipcasting.Industrial Ceramics. F.Singer, S.S.Singer. Chapman & Hall. 1971. Slipcast ware should not be confused with slipware, which is pottery formed by any technique that is decorated using slip. The French for slip is barbotine (\\"Coul√©e en barbotine\\" is slipcasting), and \\"barbotine pottery\\" is sometimes used for 19th century French and American pottery with added slipcast decoration, as well as (confusingly) being the English term for a variety of slipware that is decorated with thick blobs of slip.

She was purchased by the US Army in 1898 for transport duty in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. In 1919, she was briefly transferred to the US Navy, commissioned as the USS Buford (ID 3818), to repatriate troops home after World War I, and then later that year returned to the Army. In December 1919, nicknamed the Soviet Ark (or the Red Ark) by the press of the day, the Buford was used by the U.S. Department of Justice and Department of Labor to deport 249 non-citizens to Russia from the United States because of their alleged anarchist or syndicalist political beliefs. She was sold to private interests in 1923, contracted in mid-1924 to be the set for Buster Keaton's silent film The Navigator, and finally scrapped in 1929.

On December 21, 1919, she was used to deport 249 political radicals and other \\"undesirable\\" aliens, mostly members of the Union of Russian Workers, to the Russian SFSR. Also swept up were the fiery anarchists Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman. This occurred between the first and second Palmer Raids of the first \\"Red Scare\\" period in the U.S. After delivering her charges, the Buford returned to New York on February 22, 1920.New York Times: \\"'Soviet Ark' Returns: Buford Can Be Ready for Another Load of Reds by Wednesday\\" February 23, 1920, p. 8, accessed January 1, 2010 Political context During the First Red Scare in 1919-20 following the Russian Revolution, anti-Bolshevik sentiment quickly replaced the anti-German sentiment of the World War I years. Many politicians and government officials, along with a large part of the press and the public, feared an imminent attempt to overthrow the government of the United States and the creation of a new regime modeled on that of the Soviets. In that atmosphere of public hysteria, radical views as well as moderate dissents were often characterized as un-American or subversive, including the advocacy of labor rights and any less than complementary discussion of American society and its system of government. Close ties between recent European immigrants and radical political ideas and organizations fed those anxieties as well. The Espionage Act of 1917 made it a crime to interfere with the operation or success of the armed forces of the United States. It effectively criminalized any act or speech that discouraged full compliance with the military draft. Convicted under this law, Eugene V. Debs, a five-time presidential candidate, served 3 years of a 10-year sentence before President Warren G. Harding commuted his sentence on Christmas Day, 1921. Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman were likewise convicted under the Espionage Act and eventually deported. The Immigration Act of 1918 denied entry into the U.S. and permitted the deportation of non-citizens \\"who disbelieve in or are opposed to all organized government.\\" Voyage Leading Personages on The Buford's Passenger-List Emma Goldman, Ethel Bernstein, Peter Bianki, Alexander Berkman The Buford steamed out of New York harbor at 6 A. M. on Sunday, December 21, 1919, with 249 \\"undesirables\\" on board. Of those, 199 had been seized in the November 7 Palmer Raids. Some were leftists or anarchists, though perhaps as many as 180 were deported because of their membership in the Union of Russian Workers, an anarchist organization which served social and educational functions for many Russian immigrants, had been the principal target of the raids. Other deportees, including the well-known radical leaders Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman, had been detained earlier. All, by act or speech or membership in an organization, fell within the legal definition of anarchist under the Immigration Act of 1918, which did not distinguish between \\"malignant conspirators and destructive revolutionists\\" on the one hand or \\"apostles of peace, preachers of the principle of non-resistance\\" on the other. All met the law's requirement in that they \\"believed that no government would be better for human society than any kind of government.\\", p.14-16. Goldman had been convicted in 1893 of \\"inciting to riot\\" and in 1917 for interfering with military recruitment. She had been arrested on many other occasions.Post, 12-16 Berkman had served 14 years in prison for the attempted assassination of industrialist Henry Clay Frick after the Homestead Steel Strike in 1892. In 1917 he had been convicted alongside Goldman for the same anti-draft activities.Post, 19-20 The notoriety of Goldman and Berkman as convicted agitators allowed the press and public to imagine that all the deportees had similar backgrounds.

Delayed by storms, the Buford began her return voyage that same day. On January 19, the trek continued to Terijoki.

In 1924, after a voyage to the South Seas, the Buford was chartered for three months by silent film comedian Buster Keaton for use as the principal set of his film The Navigator.Los Angeles Times, \\"Deep Sea Comedy,\\" May 11, 1924, pg. 23 The Buford had been \\"discovered\\" by Keaton's Technical Director Fred Gabourie while scouting for ships for another, outside project, The Sea Hawk. Released on October 13, 1924, The Navigator proved to be Keaton's most financially successful film and one of his personal favorites. After this moment in the limelight, the Buford slipped into dormancy and would occasionally reappear at the center of several financially dubious schemes. On February 25, 1929,Los Angeles Times, \\"Former Transport Buford Reported Sold,\\" February 25, 1929, pg. 6 it was reported that the Buford would be scrapped in Yokohama, Japan by Hasegawa Gentaro. She sailed from Los Angeles on May 11, 1929, flying the American flag under the command of Capt. A. G.

Chilingarian (he uses both Chilingar and Chilingarian as his last name) is an American-Armenian Professor of Civil and Petroleum Engineering at the University of Southern California (USC). He is one of the best-known petroleum geologists in the world and the founder of several prestigious journals in the oil and gas industry. Chilingar has published 72 books and over 500 of articles on geology, petroleum engineering and environmental engineering. He serves as president of the U.S. branch of the Russian Academy of Natural Sciences and 17 of his books have been translated into Russian. In recognition of these contributions, the Russian Academy of Natural Sciences has honored him as a Knight of Arts and Sciences. He received his bachelor's and master's degrees in petroleum engineering and a Ph.D. in geology (with a minor in petroleum engineering), all at USC. His greatest contribution to the petroleum industry may be a means of identifying oil-rich rock by analyzing the ratio of calcium to magnesium in core samples. This method was used in discovering one of Iran's largest oil fields, which was then named after Chilingar. Scientia Iranica has published a special issue in \\"Transactions C: Chemistry and Chemical Engineering\\" dedicated to the lifelong achievements of Chilingar. He also played a key role in the development of Thailand's offshore oil reserves. Chilingar saw natural gas bubbles in the Gulf of Siam and redirected exploratory efforts, thus saving the nascent Thai oil industry. In 2001, King Fahd of Saudi Arabia acknowledged Chilingar's significant contributions to the success of Saudi Aramco as well as the discovery and extraction of oil reserves around the world. The Saudi consul general in Los Angeles, Ambassador Mohammed A. Al- Salloum, presented the award, a globe signifying the worldwide reach and importance of the petroleum industry and Saudi Aramco. He served as senior petroleum engineering adviser to the United Nations from 1967 to 1969, and then again from 1978 to 1987. He was also an energy policy adviser to California Governor Ronald Reagan in 1973.

Statement of the bound The minimum distance of a set C of codewords of length n is defined as :d = \\\\min_{{x,y \\\\in C : x eq y}} d(x,y) where d(x,y) is the Hamming distance between x and y. The expression A_{q}(n,d) represents the maximum number of possible codewords in a q-ary block code of length n and minimum distance d. Then the Singleton bound states that :A_q(n,d) \\\\leq q^{n-d+1}. Proof First observe that the number of q-ary words of length n is q^n, since each letter in such a word may take one of q different values, independently of the remaining letters. Now let C be an arbitrary q-ary block code of minimum distance d. Clearly, all codewords c \\\\in C are distinct. If we puncture the code by deleting the first d-1 letters of each codeword, then all resulting codewords must still be pairwise different, since all of the original codewords in C have Hamming distance at least d from each other. Thus the size of the altered code is the same as the original code. The newly obtained codewords each have length :n-(d-1)=n-d+1, and thus, there can be at most q^{n-d+1} of them. Since C was arbitrary, this bound must hold for the largest possible code with these parameters, thus: :C \\\\le A_q(n,d) \\\\leq q^{n-d+1}. Linear codes If C is a linear code with block length n, dimension k and minimum distance d over the finite field with q elements, then the maximum number of codewords is q^k and the Singleton bound implies: :q^k \\\\leq q^{n-d+1}, so that :k \\\\leq n - d + 1, which is usually written as :d \\\\leq n - k + 1. In the linear code case a different proof of the Singleton bound can be obtained by observing that rank of the parity check matrix is n - k. Another simple proof follows from observing that the rows of any generator matrix in standard form have weight at most n - k + 1. History The usual citation given for this result is , but according to the result can be found in a 1953 paper of Komamiya. MDS codes Linear block codes that achieve equality in the Singleton bound are called MDS (maximum distance separable) codes. Examples of such codes include codes that have only two codewords (the all- zero word and the all-one word, having thus minimum distance n), codes that use the whole of (\\\\mathbb{F}_{q})^{n} (minimum distance 1), codes with a single parity symbol (minimum distance 2) and their dual codes. These are often called trivial MDS codes. In the case of binary alphabets, only trivial MDS codes exist. Examples of non-trivial MDS codes include Reed-Solomon codes and their extended versions. MDS codes are an important class of block codes since, for a fixed n and k, they have the greatest error correcting and detecting capabilities. There are several ways to characterize MDS codes: :Theorem: Let C be a linear [n,k,d] code over \\\\mathbb{F}_q. The following are equivalent: :* C is an MDS code. :* Any k columns of a generator matrix for C are linearly independent. :* Any n-k columns of a parity check matrix for C are linearly independent. :* C^{\\\\perp} is an MDS code. :* If G = (IA) is a generator matrix for C in standard form, then every square submatrix of A is nonsingular. :* Given any d coordinate positions, there is a (minimum weight) codeword whose support is precisely these positions. The last of these characterizations permits, by using the MacWilliams identities, an explicit formula for the complete weight distribution of an MDS code. :Theorem: Let C be a linear [n,k,d] MDS code over \\\\mathbb{F}_q. If A_w denotes the number of codewords in C of weight w, then ::A_w = \\\\binom{n}{w} \\\\sum_{j=0}^{w-d} (-1)^j \\\\binom{w}{j} (q^{w-d+1-j} -1) = \\\\binom{n}{w}(q-1)\\\\sum_{j=0}^{w-d} (-1)^j \\\\binom{w-1}{j}q^{w-d-j}. Arcs in projective geometry The linear independence of the columns of a generator matrix of an MDS code permits a construction of MDS codes from objects in finite projective geometry. Let PG(N,q) be the finite projective space of (geometric) dimension N over the finite field \\\\mathbb{F}_q. Let K = {P_1,P_2,\\\\dots,P_m } be a set of points in this projective space represented with homogeneous coordinates. Form the (N+1) \\\\times m matrix G whose columns are the homogeneous coordinates of these points. Then, :Theorem: K is a (spatial) m-arc if and only if G is the generator matrix of an [m,N+1,m-N] MDS code over \\\\mathbb{F}_q.

Professional wrestling career Kash's father was a boxer and Kash began training by the age of seven years. He went on to become a professional fighter and worked in Japan. Cash met up with Ricky Morton during his travels, and took Cash on the road with him and continued his training. Working as a welder by day, Cash wrestled on the independent circuit. Under the name David Tyler Morton Jericho he formed a short lived tag team with Ricky Morton. Kash started wrestling at age 20 in 1989. Extreme Championship Wrestling (1996‚Äì2001) Cash's first mainstream exposure came in late November 1996 with ECW. Cash, then wrestling as David Tyler Morton Jericho, went to Philadelphia with friend and sometimes tag team partner \\"Heavy Metal\\" Ric Savage. Cash was friends with New Jack of the Gangstas and Rob Van Dam, and it was Rob Van Dam who first introduced Cash to Paul Heyman. Cash shortly left ECW back to the indies and even wrestled house shows for WWF. He also appeared once at TV tapings, using ring name David Jericho, on April 28, 1998 at WWF Shotgun Saturday Night where he was defeated by Taka Michinoku. During a WWF house show against the tag team Too Cool, Cash broke both of his ankles after performing a botched hurricanrana on Scotty 2 Hotty. The injury sidelined Cash for a while but upon his return to the ring he resurfaced in ECW in late 1999 under a new gimmick, Kid Kash. The name change was due to his uncanny resemblance to musician Kid Rock. Under this name, Kash would dress like Kid Rock from his Devil Without a Cause album, and even used the song (and named one of his finishers, The Bawitaba) during this phase in his career. Just months after his return Kash suffered a broken jaw in Atlanta at the hands of The Dupps. He had legitimate heat with the tag team for their supposed stiff and shoot moves on Kash during matches and as payback during a planned run in during Kash's match Bo Dupp did an unplanned frog splash right on Kash's face, breaking both sides of his jaw. At the time Atlanta was going through a flu epidemic and so Kash had to get a private physician to fix his jaw because the hospitals were swamped. Despite the injury Kash continued to wrestle, and never took a night off. He even wrestled on the Guilty as Charged PPV the very next night after driving from Atlanta to Birmingham, AL, less than 24 hours after his jaw was wired shut. This earned him the respect of Paul Heyman and several other ECW wrestlers. Kash recovered from the injury without any problems and went on to wrestle tag matches, cruiserweight-style matches, and even wrestled Mike Awesome for the ECW World Heavyweight Championship at Living Dangerously on March 12, 2000, although he lost after he was superbombed from the top rope through a Table. His tag team partners during the time include the likes of Rob Van Dam, Super Crazy, Nova and The Sandman. Kash won the ECW World Television Championship and defeating Rhino on August 26, 2000. A few weeks later, Rhino would reclaim the title from Kash. On October 1 at Anarchy Rulz, Kash pinned EZ Money in a singles match. At November to Remember, Kash defeat C. W. Anderson. On December 3 at Massacre on 34th Street, he and Super Crazy were defeated by The Unholy Alliance (Yoshihiro Tajiri and Mikey Whipwreck) in a tag team match. At Guilty as Charged, he and Super Crazy and F.B.I. (Little Guido and Tony Mamaluke) were both defeated by The Unholy Alliance in a three way dance tag team match. After Guilty as Charged, the promotion went defunct in 2001. World Championship Wrestling (2001) Two months later after ECW folded Kash was signed with World Championship Wrestling where they billed him as Cash. His only match was on the final episode of Thunder, airing on March 21, where he lost to Jason Jett. That same week, WCW was purchased by the World Wrestling Federation. Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2002‚Äì2005) On August 14, 2002, Kash re-emerged in TNA Wrestling as part of the X Division. Using the gimmick of a cocky, obnoxious heel (while still maintaining a degree of his Kid Rock mannerisms), Kash won the TNA X Division Championship from Sonny Siaki on February 12, 2003 and lost the title to Amazing Red on April 30. Some of the more notable feuds Kid Kash developed in TNA were against James Storm, Dusty Rhodes, Jeff Hardy, A.J. Styles, and even a few intergender matches with Trinity. Also, Kash faced off against legends such as \\"Rowdy\\" Roddy Piper and Larry Zbyszko. He even beat his trainer, Ricky Morton. On March 31, 2004 Kash teamed up with Dallas to win the NWA World Tag Team Championship and the pair picked the titles up a second time on April 21 before losing them to America's Most Wanted in June 2004. On April 20, 2005, TNA announced that Kash was released from his TNA contract, after months of criticizing the company. He signed with WWE after being released from TNA. World Wrestling EntertainmentCruiserweight Champion (2005-2006)= Kash's first appearance on television was as one of many interferers in the main event at ECW One Night Stand. His first official WWE outing, however, was the June 19, 2005 airing of Sunday Night Heat against Tajiri in what was designated a tryout match. On June 23 he said in an interview that \\"You never know what the company is looking for. I might not be what they're looking for. I can only hope\\", indicating that he continued to pursue of the WWE contract. That same month he was reported to have signed a developmental deal with WWE and to have been assigned to Deep South Wrestling, Kash then wrestled a few matches on Velocity, before coming up to Smackdown. Kash showed up after tag team match between MNM and The Mexicools on SmackDown, and viciously attacking Juventud. The following week, he faced off against Mexicool member, Super Crazy. Kash picked up the win, earning himself a title match with Juventud at Armageddon. Kash made his first WWE pay-per-view debut on December 18 at Armageddon, Kash defeated Juventud to win the Cruiserweight Championship. On January 29 at Royal Rumble, Kash lost the Cruiserweight title to Gregory Helms. =The Pitbulls (2006)= After losing the Cruiserweight Championship, Kash began to frequently tag team with Jamie Noble to take on the face members of the cruiserweight division; during May 2006, Kash and Noble used a gimmick previously seen in ECW, where they wore dog collars, often barked at and bit opponents, and wrestled rather aggressively and soon after the team formed Kash has got a new haircut. The pair were soon named The Pit Bulls and entered the hunt for Paul London and Brian Kendrick's WWE Tag Team Championship. On July 23 at The Great American Bash, he and Noble were defeated by London and Kendrick, this was Kash's last WWE pay-per-view appearance. His last WWE appearance on the September 29 episode of SmackDown, Kash and Noble lost to K. C. James and Idol Stevens in a tag team match. On September 27, 2006, WWE announced that Kash was released from his WWE contract. Independent circuit (2006‚Äì2009) independent event in May 2012 Kash made an appearance on Real Quality Wrestling which shows on The Fight Network in the United Kingdom. He spent time working in several European promotions, like One Pro Wrestling, as well as in Tewkesbury for top midlands promotion Pro Championship Wrestling, and also in Waterford, Ireland for Irish Whip Wrestling. Kash wrestled frequently for promotions in Nashville, where he resides. Most notably NWA Southern All-Star Wrestling, where he held their title multiple times. Return to TNA (2010‚Äì2013) Kash returning to TNA On August 8, 2010, Kash returned to TNA to take part in ECW reunion show, Hardcore Justice, Kash, Simon Diamond and Johnny Swinger were defeated by Little Guido, Tony Luke and Tracy Smothers in a six-man tag team match. At the following day's tapings of TNA Impact!, Kash wrestled in a dark match, but losing to Okada. On June 13, 2011, at the tapings of the June 16 edition of Impact Wrestling, Kash made a one night return to TNA, losing to Austin Aries in a three way first round match of a tournament for a TNA contract, which also included Jimmy Rave. On July 12, 2011, Kash announced that he had re- signed with TNA. Kash made his return to TNA on the August 11 edition of Impact Wrestling, appearing in a backstage segment, Eric Bischoff introduced new rules to the X Division. The following week Kash took part in a gauntlet match to determine the number one contender to the X Division Championship. After being eliminated from the match by Jesse Sorensen, Kash gave him a Money Maker and cost him the match. The following week later, Kash defeated Sorensen in a singles match with a rollup, while holding his tights. On the September 1 edition of Impact Wrestling, Sorensen pinned Kash in a tag team match, Kash teamed with Austin Aries and Sorensen with Brian Kendrick. On September 11 at No Surrender, Jesse Sorensen defeated Kash in an X Division number one contender's match. On the October 6 episode of Impact Wrestling, Kash attacked Brian Kendrick for disrespect on him. On November 13 at Turning Point, Kash failed to capture the X Division Championship from Aries in a three way match, which also included Sorensen. The following month at Final Resolution, Kash failed to capture the X Division Championship in a singles match with Aries. On January 8 at Genesis, Kash was eliminated from a four way X Division Championship match, which also included Austin Aries, Jesse Sorensen and Zema Ion. On January 21 at TNA live house show, Kash suffered a broken nose during a three way match against Jesse Sorensen and Shannon Moore, rendering him inactive for two months. Kash returned from injury on the March 22 edition of Impact Wrestling, participating in a four way match for the X Division Championship that ended in a no contest, following interference from Bully Ray. Kash returned to pay-per-view on June 10 at Slammiversary, he was defeated by Hernandez in a singles match. On July 8 at Destination X, Kash entered a tournament to determine the new X Division Champion, but was defeated in his first round match by Mason Andrews. Kash returned to Impact Wrestling on July 26, he along with Gunner, confronted and eventually attacked the debuting Chavo Guerrero Jr., before Guerrero was saved by Hernandez. The following week later, Kash was defeated by Guerrero in Guerrero's TNA debut match. On August 12 at Hardcore Justice, Kash and Gunner were defeated in a tag team match by Guerrero and Hernandez. Kash and Gunner faced Guerrero and Hernandez, now the TNA World Tag Team Champions, in a rematch on the October 18 episode of Impact Wrestling, but were again defeated. On the November 15 episode of Impact Wrestling Kash unsuccessfully challenged Rob Van Dam for the X Division Championship. It was reported in early November 2012 that Kid Kash would begin working for Ohio Valley Wrestling, the developmental territory for TNA. He made his debut on the November 14 tapings as the newest member of the Platoon of Wayne. He made his in-ring debut the same night in a winning effort against Elvis Pridemoore.

It is the home ground of tenants Linfield FC and Northern Ireland national football team, and is also where the Irish Cup final is played. History Named after the district in south Belfast in which it is located, Windsor Park was first opened in 1905, with a match between Linfield and Glentoran. The first major development of the stadium took place in the 1930s, to a design made by the Scottish architect Archibald Leitch. It had one main seated stand - the Grandstand, later known as the South Stand - with \\"reserved\\" terracing in front, and a large open terrace behind the goal to the west called the Spion Kop. To the north, there was a long covered terrace ‚Äì the \\"unreserved\\" terracing ‚Äì and behind the eastern goal at the Railway End another covered terrace. Windsor Park's peak capacity in this format was 60,000. In the early 1960s, the seated Railway Stand was built at the Railway End, and in the early 1970s a social club and viewing lounge was constructed in the corner between the Railway Stand and the Grandstand. In the 1980s, the 'unreserved terrace' was demolished and replaced by a two-tier, 7000-seat North Stand. In the late 1990s, the Kop terrace was demolished and replaced with a 5000-seater Kop Stand. The Kop Stand was known as the Alex Russell Stand from 2004 to 2008 in honour of Linfield's former goalkeeper and coach and one-time Northern Ireland international, but reverted to being named 'The Kop Stand' following this. In the 2016‚Äì17 league season, Linfield FC drew an average home attendance of 2,538, the highest in the league. Their highest home attendance was 7,504 in that league season. Redevelopment Windsor Park prior to redevelopment Owing to the increasingly poor condition of Windsor Park,Report slams Windsor Park safety BBC NewsIFA wants out of Windsor contract BBC Sport various proposals for its replacement were mooted, including the idea of a multi- purpose stadium hosting football, rugby union and Gaelic games on the site of the former Maze prison, or a national stadium built as part of a major leisure development at Sydenham in east Belfast.Plans for ¬£128m Belfast stadium unveiled - The Independent, 25/03/09 The plans for the multi-purpose stadium at the Maze site was strongly protested by essentially all the Northern Ireland match-going supporters. Various petitions in opposition to the suggestion, as well as organised displays of opposition at matches and the presentation counter-proposals, were arranged by Supporters Clubs in a bid to block any move to the Maze. In September 2009, the Irish Football Association (IFA) announced that its preferred option was to remain at a redeveloped Windsor Park.IFA 'backs Windsor as NI stadium' - BBC News, 07/09/09 In 2011, the Northern Ireland Executive allocated ¬£138m for a major programme of stadium redevelopment throughout Northern Ireland, with ¬£28m allocated to the redevelopment of Windsor Park into a 20,000-capacity all-seater stadium.Stadiums fit for our heroes on way at last - Belfast Telegraph, 11/03/11 In 2012, details of the stadium's redevelopment were released. The plan would see Windsor Park become an 18,000 all-seater stadium with a series of phased works originally intended to begin in the summer of 2013. Plans included the demolition of both the Railway and South Stand structures to be replaced by new stands that would partially enclose the stadium, the complete renovation of the existing North and West Stands, and construction of both new conferencing facilities and a new headquarters facility for the IFA.Windsor Park Redevelopment Project - IFA, 25/06/12Windsor Park redevelopment project - NIFootball, 03/04/12 In February 2013, planning permission for the redevelopment was granted, with the estimated cost of the project around ¬£29.2 million, of which ¬£25.2 million would come from government funding. It was planned for the work to begin in September 2013. Two months later however, an application for leave for judicial review of the government funding was lodged by Crusaders, who claimed that it was against European Union competition laws and also a form of state aid to Linfield. In a hearing that took place on 22 May 2013, Crusaders' request was granted, after the judge ruled that they had presented an arguable case that the redevelopment could be classified as state aid towards Linfield. The aspect of the challenge concerning competition law however, was thrown out. In July 2013, Crusaders agreed to a possible settlement brought forward by the judicial review. The details of the settlement were not forthcoming, but Crusaders said that it had the \\"potential to benefit the entirety of the football family\\". In September 2013, sports minister Car√°l N√≠ Chuil√≠n said that she was still committed to making sure the redevelopment went ahead as scheduled, after previously stating that she would not sign off on the funding until the IFA sorted out the \\"governance issues\\" surrounding David Martin's return to the role of deputy president. In December 2013, three months after the work was originally scheduled to begin, the redevelopment was finally given the green light, with the sports minister signing off on ¬£31 million of funding to complete the project. In May 2014, work finally got under way on the stadium redevelopment. In March 2015, following a Euro 2016 qualifying game against Finland, large cracks were found in the West Stand; this part of the stadium was scheduled for renovation rather than replacement as part of the redevelopment project. As a consequence, the area around the stand had to be sealed off, and led to the 2015 Irish Cup Final being moved to The Oval. The preliminary structural report delivered to the IFA recommended that the damaged stand be demolished. Having accepted this report, the IFA confirmed that the West Stand would be demolished in time to ensure the safety of the stadium for Northern Ireland's qualifier against Romania on 10 June, as well as stating that work on the redevelopment project would be accelerated so that the stadium could meet its 10,000 planned capacity for the game. Plans for a new West Stand were approved in November 2015, funded by the insurance on the old facility. The new structure was intended to be ready in time for Northern Ireland's World Cup qualifier against San Marino in October 2016.

Engine displacement ranges between 1.2 and 1.7 liters. The D Series engine is either SOHC or DOHC, and might include VTEC variable valve timing. Power ranges from in the Logo to in the Civic Si. D-series production commenced 1984 and ended 2005. D-series engine technology culminated with production of the D15B 3-stage VTEC (D15Z7) which was available in markets outside of the United States. Earlier versions of this engine also used a single port fuel injection system Honda called PGM- CARB, signifying the carburetor was computer controlled.

He is best known for his appearances with World Championship Wrestling between 1992 and 1994 under the ring name Tex Slazenger and with the World Wrestling Federation between 1996 and 2001 under the ring names Phineas I. Godwinn and Mideon.  Early life  Knight grew up in Clearwater, Florida. He attended Salem College in Salem, West Virginia, where he played American football for the Tigers. After suffering a severe shoulder injury, Knight left Salem College and returned to Florida, where he worked as a bouncer.  Professional wrestling career = Early career (1988‚Äì1992)  While working as a bouncer in Clearwater, Florida, Knight was introduced to Steve Keirn, who trained him as a professional wrestler. He debuted in 1989 under the ring name \\"Tex Slazenger\\", facing his stepfather, Ron Slinker, in his first match. Knight went on to wrestle on the independent circuit in the Carolinas. In 1991, Knight joined the Memphis, Tennessee-based United States Wrestling Association, where he adopted the ring name \\"Leatherface\\" and a gimmick based on the character from the 1974 film The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, complete with \\"bloodstained\\" apron, leather mask and chainsaw (without the chain). He was pushed as a \\"monster\\" in a feud with Jerry Lawler. During one infamous match between the two, Knight was set on fire. After dropping the Leatherface gimmick, Tex teamed up with Mark Canterbury who wrestled as the masked \\"Master Blaster\\". After leaving the USWA, Knight wrestled in Florida, Puerto Rico and Japan before receiving a tryout with World Championship Wrestling in 1992.  World Championship Wrestling (1992‚Äì1994)  In 1992, Knight was hired by World Championship Wrestling, where he was renamed \\"Tex Slazenger\\" and given the character of an \\"ornery Texas outlaw\\". Knight formed a tag team with Shanghai Pierce. Knight and Pierce left WCW in 1994.  United States Wrestling Association (1995‚Äì1996)  When both men left WCW, Canterbury signed with the World Wrestling Federation under the ring name \\"Henry Godwinn\\" while Slazinger returned to the USWA. In the USWA, Slazinger captured the USWA Southern Title on two occasions, defeating Brian Christopher both times.  World Wrestling Federation The Godwinns and Southern Justice (1996‚Äì1998) = In 1996, Knight signed with the WWF and was therefore reunited with Canterbury and renamed \\"Phineas I. Godwinn\\" (abbreviated to P.I.G.). The duo were portrayed as being cousins and were collectively known as The Godwinns. Phineas made his in-ring debut on the January 29 episode of Monday Night Raw in a tag team victory for Godwinns over The Bodydonnas and began a feud with Bodydonnas over their manager Sunny. They soon entered a tournament for the vacant Tag Team Championship and defeated The New Rockers and Owen Hart and British Bulldog to qualify for the finals on the March 31 episode of Free for All, where they lost to Bodydonnas. They failed to win the titles from Bodydonnas in a rematch for the titles at In Your House 7: Good Friends, Better Enemies. On May 19, Godwinns defeated Bodydonnas to win the Tag Team Championship at a live event in Madison Square Garden. As a result, they gained Bodydonnas' valet Sunny as their manager on the May 26 episode of Free for All, where they lost their newly won titles to The Smoking Gunns. In 1997, in a match between The Godwinns and the Legion of Doom, Canterbury suffered a cracked C7 vertebra when the Legion of Doom botched a Doomsday Device. He was advised by doctors to rest for 15 weeks, but returned to the ring in less than eight weeks. In early 1998, the Godwinns dropped their pig farmer gimmicks and became \\"Southern Justice\\", the bodyguards of Tennessee Lee, using their real names. Six months later, Canterbury herniated his C7 vertebra and pinched a spinal nerve, necessitating spinal fusion surgery. This came as a result of him returning to the ring too early after his neck injury. He eventually left the WWF and retired, due to the neck injury suffered in 1997 leaving Knight without a partner. = The Ministry of Darkness (1998‚Äì1999) = In late 1998, Knight returned to the WWF after a brief hiatus, and in a short time, was kidnapped by the Acolytes and brainwashed into joining the Ministry of Darkness, a heel Satanic-themed stable led by The Undertaker, who rechristened him as the deranged soothsayer \\"Midian\\" (spelling later changed to \\"Mideon\\"). Throughout 1999, The Ministry feuded with Stone Cold Steve Austin, with Mideon often teaming up with Viscera. Mideon \\"won\\" the European Championship in this time when he found it in Shane McMahon's bag. When The Undertaker was injured in late 1999, the Ministry disbanded, however, Mideon continued the gimmick and the unit with Viscera, including doing The Undertaker's biddings in matches well after The Ministry had dissolved, although no clear stable was ever established again. = Various storylines (1999‚Äì2001) = In late 1999, Knight appeared briefly as a Mankind imitator and teamed with Ivory in intergender matches on Heat. Knight returned in a limited capacity in 2000 as Naked Mideon, a persona who ran around arenas wearing only a fanny pack, a pair of boots and a thong. At No Mercy 2000 he tried to reclaim the European Championship from William Regal, but was defeated. At Armageddon 2000, Knight briefly interfered in the match between Chris Jericho and Kane. Knight then wrestled in a few dark matches under his previous moniker Tex Slazenger, but was released in January 2001.  Later career and retirement (2001‚Äì2006)  Following his run with the WWF, Knight returned to his home in Tampa, Florida and spent time training students at Steve Keirn's Pro Wrestling school. During this time he also continued to wrestle for several Florida independent promotions such as IPW and the FSPW, as well as touring Europe. From 2003 to 2004, Knight returned for several dark matches for World Wrestling Entertainment under his own name. Knight appeared at the Total Nonstop Action Wrestling event TNA Destination X 2005 on March 13, 2005 during the scheduled match between Monty Brown and Trytan. In the course of the match, the lights went off and Trytan vanished from the ring. When the lights came on, a masked Knight was in his place and was quickly pinned by Brown. TNA never revealed on air who was under the mask and released Knight the following day. Knight retired from professional wrestling in 2006.  Personal life  After retiring from professional wrestling, Knight began working as a chef in Clearwater, Florida. Knight has an eyeball tattooed on the back of his head and a tattoo of Doc Holliday on his left arm.

By using VoiceOver, the user can access their Macintosh or iOS device based on spoken descriptions and, in the case of the Mac, the keyboard. The feature is designed to increase accessibility for blind and low-vision users, as well as for users with dyslexia. macOS VoiceOver was first introduced in Mac OS X 10.4 and the target was users who had difficulty in reading due to vision impairment, particularly the blind. A preview had also been made available for Mac OS X 10.3 Panther, and was titled \\"Spoken Interface Preview.\\" VoiceOver treats the user interface as a hierarchy of elements, which are navigated by various keystrokes. Elements also are \\"interacted\\" with‚Äîfor example, interacting with a text box allows reading its text and, if possible, editing it; interacting with a scroll bar allows it to be moved using the keyboard. VoiceOver also includes support for many Braille displays for those who are both blind and deaf. In addition, VoiceOver includes features for those that cannot use the mouse, such as keyboard-based navigation. For users with MacBooks or Magic Trackpads, a number of special multitouch features are also available. The trackpad will respond to gestures, much like iOS's version of VoiceOver. A specific example is using the trackpad to explore the actual visual layout of elements on the screen - sliding one finger around the trackpad will select elements, tapping twice will activate them. In Mac OS X 10.5, Apple added the \\"Alex\\" voice, which offered improved quality of speech and a more human-like sound. Previously, the voices were directly descended from those used in Apple's \\"Speech Manager,\\" which originated in the early 1990s. Also, Alex voice has natural breathing, unlike all other voices in Apple.https://www.apple.com/accessibility/osx/voiceover/ In Mac OS X 10.7, Apple offered the download of RealSpeak voices from Nuance for use with VoiceOver. Accessibility Inspector Accessibility Inspector is made to verify the accessibility of OS X applications. It displays information about the GUI element that is currently under the cursor. iPod Shuffle After its success on Macs, Apple added VoiceOver to the iPod Shuffle. This assists users of the iPod Shuffle in controlling the playback of songs by having titles read out. With the 2010 revision of iPod Shuffle, the user can also have VoiceOver read out playlists. Unlike VoiceOver on OS X, where VoiceOver is marketed as an accessibility feature, on the iPod Shuffle VoiceOver is intended to be used by everyone, disabled or not. iOS A few months later, with the release of the iPhone 3GS, VoiceOver was added to iOS. When the iPod Touch was upgraded to match the hardware of the iPhone 3GS (in iPod touch's third generation), it also gained VoiceOver capability. The iPad, since its introduction, has also had VoiceOver capability. VoiceOver on iOS interacts with the user by using various \\"gestures,\\" different motions one makes with one or more fingers on the display. Many gestures are location- sensitive‚Äîfor example, sliding one's finger around the screen will reveal the visual contents of the screen as the finger passes over them. This enables blind users to explore the actual on-screen layout of an application. A user can double-tap‚Äîsimilar to double-clicking a mouse‚Äîto activate a selected element, just as if a sighted user had tapped the item. VoiceOver can also turn off the display but leave the touch screen sensitive to touch, saving battery power. Apple calls this feature \\"Screen Curtain\\". It is also available on Mac computers running OS X. VoiceOver for iOS is activated using the \\"Settings\\" application. It can be found in the Accessibility section under the General section. The device can also be configured so that VoiceOver can be toggled by a triple-click of the Home button on the device. iPod nano In September 2009, Apple launched this feature on the iPod nano line. It uses many of the same gestures as the iOS version. References and notesExternal links * Apple's VoiceOver website Category:MacOS Category:MacOS- only software made by Apple Inc.

He is best known for his appearances in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) from 1997 to 2002 under the ring name Tiger Ali Singh. He is the son of professional wrestler Tiger Jeet Singh.  Professional wrestling career = Early career (1992‚Äì1997)  Hans trained to be a professional wrestler by Antonio Inoki in the New Japan Pro-Wrestling Dojo and under Ron Hutchison and Sweet Daddy Siki at Sully's Gym in Toronto. He debuted as a professional wrestler in November 1992 under the ring name \\"Tiger Jeet Singh, Jr.\\", teaming with his father against Atsushi Onita and Tarzan Goto in a tag team match for Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling.  World Wrestling Federation (1997‚Äì2002)  Tiger Bomb on Viscera in 2013. Singh signed with the World Wrestling Federation in January 1997, with the signing announced at a press conference at SkyDome in Toronto. Singh's most notable accomplishment in the company occurred in 1997, when he won the second WWF Kuwait Cup Tournament, held on April 9, 1997 in Kuwait City. He defeated Owen Hart in the finals to become the second and final WWF Kuwait Cup winner. He would also participate and be managed by his father at the WWF's United Kingdom-exclusive pay-per-view event One Night Only on September 20, 1997, facing off against and defeating Leif Cassidy.Martin, Fin. \\"The Complete History of Wrestling On Pay-Per-View\\". Power Slam. Issue 223/March 2013. p. 16/17. He made his official WWF debut on the April 21, 1997 episode of Raw. He would disappear from WWF television until the Attitude Era. His gimmick was that of a rich and arrogant heir to a fortune (similar to Ted DiBiase's character). He came to the ring accompanied by a manservant named Babu, and would pay random people in the audience each week to perform humiliating stunts. On the Sunday night Heat before Survivor Series (1998), Singh lost to Val Venis and at Capital Carnage he defeated Edge. at the Royal Rumble (1999), Singh competed in the royal rumble match where he was eliminated by Mabel. On Sunday Night Heat before St. Valentine's Day Massacre: In Your House Singh faced Billy Gunn which ended in a no contest. on Sunday Night Heat before WrestleMania XV, Singh competed in a Battle Royal to determine #1 contenders to the WWF Tag Team Championship which was won by D'Lo Brown and Test and at No Mercy (UK), Singh defeated Gillberg. Singh was later sent to Puerto Rico to work on his in-ring skills. He returned in late 2000 as the manager of Lo Down (D'Lo Brown and Chaz). Lo Down and Singh were eventually sent to International Wrestling Association in Puerto Rico, removing them from WWF programming as The Invasion of 2001 started. Down in IWA, Singh became a two-time tag team champion. He eventually suffered what he claimed was a career-ending injury and was sent home to Toronto to recover. He was later released from his contract in July 2002.  Retirement (2002‚Äì2008)  The following month, Singh filed a $7 million lawsuit against World Wrestling Entertainment. Among his claims were that his career-ending injury was the result of being forced to wrestle in the rain while in Puerto Rico. He also accused other WWE wrestlers of frequently calling him \\"taxi driver\\", and that he was the victim of a stunt in 1999 where his turban was stuffed with garbage. WWE attorney Jerry McDevitt countered by noting that the company was not responsible for any injuries occurring in a different organization, and that Singh's contract could legally be ended if he suffered an injury.  Independent circuit (2008‚Äìpresent)  In late-2008, Hans, under the new ring name \\"Mick Hans\\", returned to wrestling as a part of the HUSTLE promotion in Japan. He made his return by teaming up with his father in a tag team match against Genichiro Tenryu and Shiro Koshinaka. On June 5, 2010, Singh won a battle royal for MPW Wrestling. On September 24, 2011, Singh and Daivari defeated Kaine and Darkko for SCW Wrestling. On July 1, 2013, at an event called TigerFest, Singh and Harry Smith defeated Big Daddy V, Rhino and Darkko in a handicap match. On July 1, 2014, at another event called TigerFest, Singh and Rhino match ended in a no contest which led to another match where Singh, Davey Boy Smith Jr. and Sonjay Dutt defeated Rhino, Soa Amin and Steve Corino in a best 2 out of 3 falls match, falls count anywhere match.

James Island has an elevation of above sea level at its highest point,http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/esd/distdata/ecosystems/Soils_Reports/bc43-5_report.pdf and has a total land-mass of in size. There are sea-cliffs on the Southern, Western, and Eastern shores of this island. The Southern sea-cliffs are the highest. Toponymy In SENƒÜO≈¶EN, the language of the _W_ S√ÅNEƒÜ nations, the island is named P'AQw∆éƒå.First Nations, Land Rights and Environmentalism in British Columbia, Tsawout Band, 2008 According to WalbranWalbran, John T., British Columbia Coast Names, 1909. the island was \\"Named by the early settlers, circa 1853, after ... James Douglas ...\\". Douglas was a chief factor of the Hudson's Bay Company and was second governor of the Colony of Vancouver Island. Further, Walbran stated \\"Name adopted by Captain Richards, HMS Plumper, 1858.\\" From 1857 to 1862 Richards supervised hydrographic surveys of the southern coast of British Columbia. History The island is within the traditional territories of the Tsawout First Nation. Hereditary chief Louie Pelkey of the Tsawout was born on the island in 1860.http://tsawout.com/files/Newsletters/Newsletter_September2012.pdf Although it is east of the North Saanich Douglas Treaty area and south of the Hul'q'umin'um Treaty area, it is not within a Douglas Treaty area.http://www.hulquminum.bc.ca/pubs/Douglas_treaties_map.pdf Map of Vancouver Island Treaties, Hul'q'umin'um Treaty Group website. In the early 1900s, the island was used as a private hunting ground for Victoria sportsmen including then British Columbia Premier Richard McBride, who served between 1903 and 1915. In 1913 a dynamite plant was established on the island. The plant was owned by a company that merged into Canadian Explosives Ltd, which in turn changed its name to Canadian Industries Limited (CIL) in 1927. From the outset of World War II, the plant was operated by Defence Industries Ltd, a subsidiary of CIL. The plant, and many of its workers' cottages, had been moved to the island from Nanaimo. At its peak, the plant employed 800 people, most of whom lived in a small, traffic-free village on the opposite end of the island. During World War II, the plant produced of TNT per month. The TNT plant closed in 1977, and it and the village were disassembled and removed from the island in 1979. James Island was purchased by Craig McCaw in 1994 for $19 million. Since then there was repeated legal action taken against ICI (formerly CIL) as the new owner was unable to turn over the property to residential use as per his intention due to its industrial history, a status which had been well-documented as of the sale. Recent luxury resort development on the island includes a golf course, yacht moorage, seaplane ramp, and an airstrip. McCaw has reportedly established an environmental regime on James Island where insecticides are not allowed, power lines are underground and electric cars and golf carts are used for transportation. The island was the property with the highest assessed value in the Capital Regional District in 2009, at almost $76 million.{James Island tops list of highest assessments, Times Colonist, Fri Jan 9 2009} In June, 2012, the island was put on the market with an asking price of $75 million.

Kennedy Space Center on Merritt Island in Florida, United States. The site and its collection of facilities were originally built as the Apollo program's \\"Moonport\\" and later modified for the Space Shuttle program. Launch Complex 39 consists of three launch sub-complexes or \\"pads\\"‚Äî39A, 39B, and 39C‚Äîa Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB), a Crawlerway used by crawler-transporters to carry mobile launcher platforms between the VAB and the pads, Orbiter Processing Facility buildings, a Launch Control Center which contains the firing rooms, a news facility famous for the iconic countdown clock seen in television coverage and photos, and various logistical and operational support buildings. SpaceX leases Launch Complex 39A from NASA and has modified the pad to support Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launches. NASA began modifying Launch Complex 39B in 2007 to accommodate the now defunct Constellation program, and is currently preparing it for the Artemis program, whose first launch is scheduled for no earlier than 2021. A pad to be designated 39C, which would have been a copy of pads 39A and 39B, was originally planned for Apollo but never built. A smaller pad, also designated 39C, was constructed from January to June 2015, to accommodate small-lift launch vehicles. NASA launches from pads 39A and 39B have been supervised from the NASA Launch Control Center (LCC), located from the launch pads. LC-39 is one of several launch sites that share the radar and tracking services of the Eastern Test Range. History=Early history Northern Merritt Island was first developed around 1890 when a few wealthy Harvard University graduates purchased and constructed a three-story mahogany clubhouse, very nearly on the site of Pad 39A. During the 1920s, Peter E. Studebaker Jr., son of the automobile magnate, built a small casino at De Soto Beach north of the Canaveral lighthouse.Eriksen, John M. Brevard County, Florida: A Short History to 1955. See Chapter Ten on De Soto Grove, De Soto Beach, and Playa Linda Beach. In 1948, the Navy transferred the former Banana River Naval Air Station, located south of Cape Canaveral, to the Air Force for use in testing captured German V-2 rockets. The site's location on the East Florida coast was ideal for this purpose, in that launches would be over the ocean, away from populated areas. This site became the Joint Long Range Proving Ground in 1949 and was renamed Patrick Air Force Base in 1950. The Air Force annexed part of Cape Canaveral, to the north, in 1951, forming the Air Force Missile Test Center, the future Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS). Missile and rocketry testing and development would take place here through the 1950s. After the creation of NASA in 1958, the CCAFS launch pads were used for NASA's civilian uncrewed and crewed launches, including those of Project Mercury and Project Gemini.  Apollo and Skylab  In 1961, President Kennedy proposed to Congress the goal of landing a man on the Moon by the end of the decade. Congressional approval led to the launch of the Apollo program, which required a massive expansion of NASA operations, including an expansion of launch operations from the Cape to adjacent Merritt Island to the north and west. NASA began acquisition of land in 1962, taking title to by outright purchase and negotiating with the state of Florida for an additional . On July 1, 1962, the site was named the Launch Operations Center. = Initial design = At the time, the highest numbered launch pad at CCAFS was Launch Complex 37. When the lunar launch complex was designed, it was designated as Launch Complex 39. It was designed to handle launches of the Saturn V rocket, the largest, most powerful rocket then designed, which would propel Apollo spacecraft to the Moon. Initial plans envisioned four pads (five were considered) evenly spaced apart to avoid damage in the event of an explosion on a pad. Three were scheduled for construction (A, B, and C, to the southeast), and two (D and E, west and north) would have been built at a later date. The numbering of the pads at the time was from north to south, with the northernmost being 39A, and the southernmost being 39C. Pad 39A was never built, and 39C became 39A in 1963. With today's numbering, 39C would have been north of 39B, and 39D would have been due west of 39C. Pad 39E would have been due north of the midpoint between 39C and 39D, with 39E forming the top of a triangle, and equidistant from 39C and 39D. The Crawlerway was built with the additional pads in mind. This is the reason the Crawlerway turns as it heads to Pad B; continuing straight from that turn would have led to the additional pads. = Integration of space vehicle stack = Months before a launch, the three stages of the Saturn V launch vehicle and the components of the Apollo spacecraft were brought inside the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) and assembled, in one of four bays, into a -tall space vehicle on one of three Mobile Launchers (ML). Each Mobile Launcher consisted of a two-story, launcher platform with four hold-down arms and a Launch Umbilical Tower (LUT) topped by a crane used to lift the spacecraft elements into position for assembly. The ML and unfueled vehicle together weighed . The umbilical tower contained two elevators and nine retractable swing arms that were extended to the space vehicle‚Äîto provide access to each of the three rocket stages and the spacecraft for people, wiring, and plumbing‚Äîwhile the vehicle was on the launch pad and were swung away from the vehicle at launch. Technicians, engineers, and astronauts used the uppermost Spacecraft Access Arm to access the crew cabin. At the end of the arm, the white room provided an environmentally controlled and protected area for astronauts and their equipment before entering the spacecraft. = Transportation to the pad = When the stack integration was completed, the Mobile Launcher was moved atop one of two crawler-transporters, or Missile Crawler Transporter Facilities, to its pad at a speed of . Each crawler weighed and was capable of keeping the space vehicle and its launcher platform level while negotiating the 5 percent grade to the pad. At the pad, the ML was placed on six steel pedestals, plus four additional extensible columns. = Mobile Service Structure = After the ML was set in place, the crawler-transporter rolled a , Mobile Service Structure (MSS) into place to provide further access for technicians to perform a detailed checkout of the vehicle, and to provide necessary umbilical connections to the pad. The MSS contained three elevators, two self-propelled platforms, and three fixed platforms. It was rolled back to a parking position shortly before launch. = Flame deflector = While the ML was sat on its launch pedestals, one of two flame deflectors was slid on rails into place under it. Having two deflectors allowed for one to be used while the other was being refurbished after a previous launch. Each deflector measured high by wide by long, and weighed . During a launch, it deflected the launch vehicle's rocket exhaust flame into a trench measuring deep by wide by long. = Launch control and fueling = The four-story Launch Control Center (LCC) was located away from Pad A, adjacent to the Vehicle Assembly Building, for safety. The third floor had four firing rooms (corresponding to the four bays in the VAB), each with 470 sets of control and monitoring equipment. The second floor contained telemetry, tracking, instrumentation, and data reduction computing equipment. The LCC was connected to the Mobile Launcher Platforms by a high-speed data link; and during launch a system of 62 closed- circuit television cameras transmitted to 100 monitor screens in the LCC. Large cryogenic tanks located near the pads stored the liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen (LOX) for the second and third stages of the Saturn V. The highly explosive nature of these chemicals required numerous safety measures at the launch complex. The pads were located away from each other. Before tanking operations began and during launch, non-essential personnel were excluded from the danger area. = Emergency evacuation system = Each pad had a evacuation tube running from the Mobile Launcher platform to a blast- resistant bunker underground, nicknamed Rubber room, equipped with survival supplies for 20 persons for 24 hours and reachable through a high-speed elevator.Maloney, Kelli. Launch Pad Escape System Design A further Emergency Egress System was installed to allow fast escape of crew or technicians from pad in case of imminent catastrophic failure of the rocket.NASA. Emergency Egress System The system included seven baskets suspended from seven slidewires that extended from the fixed service structure to a landing zone to the west. Each basket could hold up to three people, which slided down the wire reaching up to , eventually reaching a gentle stop by means of a braking system catch net and drag chain which slowed and then halted the baskets. The system was dismantled in 2012, as seen in this video. = Pad Terminal Connection Room = Connections between the Launch Control Center, Mobile Launcher Platform, and space vehicle were made in the Pad Terminal Connection Room (PTCR), which was a two-story series of rooms located beneath the launch pad on the west side of the flame trench. The \\"room\\" was constructed of reinforced concrete and protected by up to of fill dirt. = Apollo and Skylab launches = The first launch from Launch Complex 39 came in 1967 with the first Saturn V launch, which carried the uncrewed Apollo 4 spacecraft. The second uncrewed launch, Apollo 6, also used Pad 39A. With the exception of Apollo 10, which used Pad 39B (due to the \\"all-up\\" testing resulting in a 2-month turnaround period), all crewed Apollo-Saturn V launches, commencing with Apollo 8, used Pad 39A. A total of thirteen Saturn Vs were launched for Apollo, and the uncrewed launch of the Skylab space station in 1973. The mobile launchers were then modified for the shorter Saturn IB rockets, by adding a \\"milk-stool\\" extension platform to the launch pedestal, so that the S-IVB upper stage and Apollo spacecraft swing arms would reach their targets. These were used for three crewed Skylab flights and the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project, since the Saturn IB pads 34 and 37 at Cape Canaveral AFS had been decommissioned. Space Shuttle at Launch Complex 39A The thrust to allow the Space Shuttle to achieve orbit was provided by a combination of the Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs) and the RS-25 engines. The SRBs used solid propellant, hence their name. The RS-25 engines used a combination of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen (LOX) from the external tank (ET), as the orbiter did not have room for internal fuel tanks. The SRBs arrived in segments via rail car from their manufacturing facility in Utah, the external tank arrived from its manufacturing facility in Louisiana by barge, and the orbiter waited in the Orbiter Processing Facility (OPF). The SRBs were first stacked in the VAB, then the External tank was mounted between them, and then, with the help of a massive crane, the orbiter was lowered and connected to the External tank. The payload to be installed at the launch pad was independently transported in a payload transportation canister and then installed vertically at the Payload Changeout Room. Otherwise, payloads would have already been pre-installed at the Orbiter Processing Facility and transported within the orbiter's cargo bay. The original structure of the pads was remodeled for the needs of the Space Shuttle, starting with Pad 39A after the last Saturn V launch, and, in 1977, that of Pad 39B after the Apollo-Soyuz in 1975. The first usage of the pad for the Space Shuttle came in 1979, when Enterprise was used to check the facilities prior to the first operational launch. = Service structures = Each pads contained a two-piece access tower system, the Fixed Service Structure (FSS) and the Rotating Service Structure (RSS). The FSS permitted access to the Shuttle via a retractable arm and a \\"beanie cap\\" to capture vented LOX from the external tank. = Sound Suppression Water System = A Sound Suppression Water System (SSWS) was added to protect the Space Shuttle and its payload from effects of the intense sound wave pressure generated by its engines. An elevated water tank on a tower near each pad stored of water, which was released onto the mobile launcher platform just before engine ignition. The water muffled the intense sound waves produced by the engines. Due to heating of the water, a large quantity of steam and water vapor was produced during launch. = Swing arm modifications = The doors to the White Room, which provided entry to the Shuttle crew compartment, are seen here at the end of the access arm walkway The Gaseous Oxygen Vent Arm positioned a hood, often called the \\"Beanie Cap\\", over the top of the external tank (ET) nose cone during fueling. Heated gaseous nitrogen was used there to remove the extremely cold gaseous oxygen that normally vented out of the external tank. This prevented the formation of ice that could fall and damage the shuttle. The Hydrogen Vent Line Access Arm mated the External Tank's Ground Umbilical Carrier Plate (GUCP) to the launch pad hydrogen vent line. The GUCP provided support for plumbing and cables, called umbilicals, that transferred fluids, gases, and electrical signals between two pieces of equipment. While the External Tank was being fueled, hazardous gas was vented from an internal hydrogen tank, through the GUCP, and out a vent line to a flare stack where it was burned off at a safe distance. Sensors at the GUCP measured gas level. The GUCP was redesigned after leaks created scrubs of STS-127 and were also detected during attempts to launch STS-119 and STS-133. The GUCP released from the ET at launch and fell away with a curtain of water sprayed across it for protection from flames. = Emergency pad evacuation = M113 armored personnel carriers parked near LC-39 In an emergency, the launch complex used a slidewire escape basket system for quick evacuation. Assisted by members of the closeout team, the crew would leave the orbiter and ride an emergency basket to the ground at speeds reaching up to . From there, the crew took shelter in a bunker. A modified M113 Armored Personnel Carrier could carry injured astronauts away from the complex to safety. During the launch of Discovery on STS-124 on May 31, 2008, the pad at LC-39A suffered extensive damage, in particular to the concrete trench used to deflect the SRB's flames. The subsequent investigation found that the damage was the result of carbonation of epoxy and corrosion of steel anchors that held the refractory bricks in the trench in place. The damage had been exacerbated by the fact that hydrochloric acid is an exhaust by-product of the solid rocket boosters. = Space Shuttle launches = After the launch of Skylab in 1973, Pad 39A was reconfigured for the Space Shuttle, with shuttle launches beginning with STS-1 in 1981, flown by the . After Apollo 10, Pad 39B was kept as a backup launch facility in the case of the destruction of 39A, but saw active service during all three Skylab missions, the Apollo-Soyuz test flight, and a contingency Skylab Rescue flight that never became necessary. After the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project, 39B was reconfigured similarly to 39A; but due to additional modifications (mainly to allow the facility to service a modified Centaur-G upper stage), along with budgetary restraints, it was not ready until 1986. The first shuttle flight to use it was STS-51-L, which ended with the Challenger disaster, after which the first return-to-flight mission, STS-26, was launched from 39B. Just as for the first 24 shuttle flights, LC-39A supported the final shuttle flights, starting with STS-117 in June 2007 and ending with the retirement of the Shuttle fleet in July 2011. Prior to the SpaceX lease agreement, the pad remained as it was when Atlantis launched on the final shuttle mission on July 8, 2011, complete with a mobile launcher platform. = After Space Shuttle retirement = With the retirement of the Space Shuttle in 2011,NASA: Lost in Space, Business Week, 2010-10-28, accessed 2010-10-31. and the cancellation of Constellation Program in 2010, the future of the Launch Complex 39 pads was uncertain. By early 2011, NASA began informal discussions on use of the pads and facilities by private companies to fly missions for the commercial space market, culminating in a 20-year lease agreement with SpaceX for Pad 39A. Talks for use of the pad were underway between NASA and Space Florida‚Äîthe State of Florida's economic development agency‚Äîas early as 2011, but no deal materialized by 2012, and NASA then pursued other options for removing the pad from the federal government inventory. Constellation program Ares I-X launches from LC-39B, 15:30 UTC, October 28, 2009 The last Shuttle launch from pad 39B was the nighttime launch of STS-116 on December 9, 2006. To support the final Shuttle mission to the Hubble Space Telescope STS-125 launched from pad 39A in May 2009, Endeavour was placed on 39B if needed to launch the STS-400 rescue mission. After the completion of STS-125, 39B was converted to launch the single test flight of the Constellation Program Ares I-X on October 28, 2009. This program was later canceled.  SpaceX  Bob Cabana announces the signing of the pad 39A lease agreement on April 14, 2014. SpaceX COO Gwynne Shotwell stands nearby. By early 2013, NASA publicly announced that it would allow commercial launch providers to lease LC-39A,\\"NASA not abandoning LC-39A\\" January 17, 2013, accessed February 7, 2013. and followed that, in May 2013, with a formal solicitation for proposals for commercial use of the pad.NASA requests proposals for commercial use of Pad 39A, NewSpace Watch, May 20, 2013, accessed May 21, 2013. There were two competing bids for the commercial use of the launch complex. SpaceX submitted a bid for exclusive use of the launch complex, while Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin submitted a bid for shared non- exclusive use of the complex, so that the launchpad would handle multiple vehicles, and costs could be shared over the long-term. One potential shared user in the Blue Origin plan was United Launch Alliance. Prior to the end of the bid period, and prior to any public announcement by NASA of the results of the process, Blue Origin filed a protest with the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) \\"over what it says is a plan by NASA to award an exclusive commercial lease to SpaceX for use of mothballed space shuttle launch pad 39A.\\" NASA had planned to complete the bid award and have the pad transferred by October 1, 2013, but the protest \\"will delay any decision until the GAO reaches a decision, expected by mid-December.\\" On December 12, 2013, the GAO denied the protest and sided with NASA, which argued that the solicitation contained no preference on the use of the facility as multi-use or single-use. \\"The [solicitation] document merely asks bidders to explain their reasons for selecting one approach instead of the other and how they would manage the facility.\\" On April 14, 2014, the privately owned launch service provider SpaceX signed a 20-year lease for Launch Complex 39A (LC-39A). The pad was modified to support launches of both Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launch vehicles, modifications that included the construction of a large Horizontal Integration Facility (HIF) similar to that used at existing SpaceX-leased facilities at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station and Vandenberg Air Force Base, horizontal integration being markedly difference from the vertical integration process used to assemble NASA's Apollo and Space Shuttle vehicles at the launch complex. Additionally, new instrumentation and control systems were installed, and substantial new plumbing was added for a variety of rocket liquids and gases.https://blogs.nasa.gov/spacex/2017/02/19/first-launch-from- lc-39a-at-kennedy-since-2011/ = Modifications = In 2015, SpaceX built the Horizontal Integration Facility just outside the perimeter of the existing launch pad in order to house both the Falcon 9 and the Falcon Heavy rockets, and their associated hardware and payloads, during preparation for flight. Both types of launch vehicles will be transported from the HIF to the launch pad aboard a Transporter Erector (TE) which will ride on rails up the former crawlerway path. Also in 2015, the launch mount for the Falcon Heavy was constructed on Pad 39A over the existing infrastructure. The work on both the HIF building and the pad was substantially complete by late 2015. A rollout test of the new Transporter Erector was conducted in November 2015. In February 2016, SpaceX indicated that they had \\"completed and activated Launch Complex 39A\\", but still had more work yet to do to support crewed flights. SpaceX originally planned to be ready to accomplish the first launch at pad 39A‚Äîof a Falcon Heavy‚Äîas early as 2015, as they had had architects and engineers working on the new design and modifications since 2013. By late 2014, a preliminary date for a wet dress rehearsal of the Falcon Heavy was set for no earlier than July 1, 2015. Due to a failure in a June 2015 Falcon 9 launch, SpaceX had to delay launching the Falcon Heavy in order to focus on the Falcon 9's failure investigation and its return to flight. In early 2016, considering the busy Falcon 9 launch manifest, it became unclear if the Falcon Heavy would be the first vehicle to launch from Pad 39A, or if one or more Falcon 9 missions would precede a Falcon Heavy launch. In the following months, the Falcon Heavy launch was delayed multiple times and eventually pushed back to February 2018. In 2019, SpaceX began substantial modification to LC 39A in order to begin work on phase 1 of the construction to prepare the facility to launch prototypes of the large -diameter methalox reusable rocket‚ÄîStarship‚Äîfrom a launch stand, which will fly from 39A on suborbital test flight trajectories with six or fewer Raptor engines. A second phase of the construction is planned for 2020 to build a much more capable launch mount capable of launching the entire Starship launch vehicle,https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2019/10/construction- starship-39a-facility-pace/ powered by 43 Raptor engines and producing a total of liftoff thrust when departing 39A. = Launch history = The first SpaceX launch from pad 39A was SpaceX CRS-10 on February 19, 2017, using a Falcon 9 launch vehicle; it was the company's 10th cargo resupply mission to the International Space Station, and the first uncrewed launch from 39A since Skylab. While Cape Canaveral's Space Launch Complex 40 (SLC-40) was undergoing reconstruction after the loss of the AMOS-6 satellite on September 1, 2016, all SpaceX's east coast launches were from Pad 39A until SLC-40 became operational again in December 2017. These included the May 1, 2017, launch of NROL-76, the first SpaceX mission for the National Reconnaissance Office, with a classified payload. On February 6, 2018, Pad 39A hosted the successful liftoff of the Falcon Heavy on its maiden launch, carrying Elon Musk's Tesla Roadster car to space; and the first flight of the human-rated spacecraft Crew Dragon (Dragon 2) took place there on March 2, 2019. The second Falcon Heavy flight, carrying the Arabsat-6A communications satellite for Arabsat of Saudi Arabia, successfully launched on April 11, 2019. The satellite is to provide Ku band and Ka band communication services for the Middle East and northern Africa, as well as for South Africa. The launch was notable as it marked the first time that SpaceX was able to successfully soft-land all three of the reusable booster stages, which will be refurbished for future launches. The SpaceX Demo-2 ‚àí the first crewed test flight of the Crew Dragon \\"Endeavour\\" spacecraft, with astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley on board launched from Complex 39A on May 30, 2020 and docked to Pressurized Mating Adapter 2 on the Harmony module of the ISS on May 31, 2020.  Launch statistics = Pad 39A launches  Pad 39B launches =Current status=Launch Complex 39A SpaceX has launched their launch vehicles from Launch Complex 39A and built a new hangar nearby. SpaceX assembles its launch vehicles horizontally in a hangar near the pad, and transports them horizontally to the pad before erecting the vehicle to vertical for the launch. For military missions from Pad 39A, payloads will be vertically integrated, as that is required per launch contract with the US Air Force. Pad 39A is used to host launches of astronauts on the Crew Dragon capsule in a public‚Äìprivate partnership with NASA. In August 2018, SpaceX's Crew Access Arm (CAA) was installed on a new level, which was built at the necessary height to enter the Crew Dragon spacecraft atop a Falcon 9 rocket. Launch Complex 39B Since the Ares I-X test flight in 2009, Launch Complex 39B is being reconfigured for use by NASA's Space Launch System rocket, a Shuttle-derived launch vehicle which will be used in the Artemis program and subsequent Moon to Mars campaigns. The pad has also been leased for use by NASA to aerospace company Northrup Grumman, for use as a launch site for their Shuttle-derived OmegA launch vehicle, for National Security Space Launch flights and commercial launches. Launch Complex 39C Launch Complex 39C is a new facility for small-lift launch vehicles. It was built in 2015 within the Launch Complex 39B perimeter. It was to serve as a multi-purpose site that allowed companies to test the vehicles and capabilities of the smaller class of rockets, making it more affordable for smaller companies to break into the commercial spaceflight market. However, its primary customer Rocket Lab opted to launch their Electron rocket from Wallops Island, instead. Several small-lift launch-vehicle companies also wanted to launch their rockets from a dedicated site at Cape Canaveral instead of 39C. = Construction = Construction of the pad began in January 2015 and was completed in June 2015. Kennedy Space Center director Robert D. Cabana and representatives from the Ground Systems Development and Operations (GSDO) Program and the Center Planning and Development (CPD) and Engineering directorates marked the completion of the new pad during a ribbon-cutting ceremony on July 17, 2015. \\"As America's premier spaceport, we're always looking for new and innovative ways to meet America's launch needs, and one area that was missing was small class payloads\\", Cabana said. = Capabilities = The concrete pad measures about wide by about long and could support the combined weight of a fueled launch vehicle, payload, and customer- provided launch mount up to about , and an umbilical tower structure, fluid lines, cables, and umbilical arms weighing up to about . There is a universal propellant servicing system to provide liquid oxygen and liquid methane fueling capabilities for a variety of small-class rockets. With the addition of Launch Complex 39C, KSC offered the following processing and launching features for companies working with small-class vehicles (maximum thrust up to ): * Processing facilities ‚Äì i.e. Vehicle Assembly Building * Vehicle/payload transportation (KAMAG, flatbed trucks, tugs, etc.) from integration facility to pad * Launch site * Universal propellant servicing system (LOX, LCH4) * Launch control center/mobile command center options. Future development A map shows the current and proposed elements on KSC. Previous Kennedy Space Center (KSC) Master Plan recommendations‚Äîin 1966, 1972, and 1977‚Äînoted that an expansion of KSC's vertical launch capacity could occur when the market demand existed. The 2007 Site Evaluation Study recommended an additional vertical launch pad, Launch Complex 49 (LC-49), to be sited north of existing LC-39B. As part of the Environmental Impact Study (EIS) process, this proposed launch complex was consolidated from two pads (designated in the 1963 plans as 39C and 39D) to one that would provide greater separation from LC-39B. The area was expanded to accommodate a wider variety of launch azimuths, helping to protect against potential overflight concerns of LC-39B. This LC-49 launch facility could accommodate medium to large launch vehicles. The 2007 Vertical Launch Site Evaluation Study concluded that a vertical launch pad could also be sited to the south of 39A, and to the north of pad 41, to accommodate small to medium launch vehicles. Designated as Launch Complex 48 (LC-48), this area is best suited to accommodate small to medium class launch vehicles, due to its closer proximity to LC-39A and LC-41. Due to the nature of these activities, required quantity-distance arcs, launch hazard impact limit lines, other safety setbacks, and exposure limits will be specified for safe operations. Details of the proposed launch pads were published in the Kennedy Space Center Master Plan in 2012. The Master Plan also notes a proposed New Vertical Launchpad northwest of LC-39B and a Horizontal Launch Area north of the LC-49 and converting the Shuttle Landing Facility (SLF) and it apron areas into a second Horizontal Launch Area. Space Florida has proposed that Launch Complex 48 be developed for use by Boeing's Phantom Express and that three landing pads be built for reusable booster systems, to provide more landing options for SpaceX's Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy, Blue Origin's New Glenn, and other potential reusable vehicles. The pads would be located east of the Horizontal Launch Area and north of LC-39B In August 2019, SpaceX submitted an Environmental Assessment for Starship launch system at Kennedy Space Center. This document included plans for the construction of additional structures at LC-39A to support Starship launches, including a dedicated pad, liquid methane tanks, and a Landing Zone. These are separate from the existing structures that support Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launches.

They live an entirely aquatic lifestyle in the eastern part of North America in lakes, rivers, and ponds. They go through paedomorphosis and retain their external gills. Because skin and lung respiration alone is not sufficient for gas exchange, mudpuppies must rely on external gills as their primary means of gas exchange. They are usually a rusty brown color and can grow to an average length of .Gans, C., and R. A. Nussbaum (1981). \\"The Mudpuppy.\\" Vertebrates, a Laboratory Text. Ed. Norman K. Wessells and Elizabeth M. Center. 2nd ed. Los Altos, Calif.: W. Kaufmann, pp. 108‚Äì41. Mudpuppies are nocturnal creatures, and come out during the day only if the water in which they live is murky. Their diet consists of almost anything they can get in their mouths, including insects, mollusks, and earthworms (as well as other annelids). Once a female mudpuppy reaches sexual maturity at six years of age, she can lay an average of 60 eggs. In the wild, the average lifespan of a mudpuppy is 11 years. Appearance Mudpuppies are small and can be compared to the size of a lizard. Mudpuppies can be a rusty brown color with gray and black and usually have blackish-blue spots, but some albino adults have been reported in Arkansas. In clear, light water, their skin gets darker, likewise in darker water, their skin gets lighter in color. At sexual maturity, mudpuppies can be long and continue to grow to an average length of , though specimens up to have been reported. Their external gills resemble ostrich plumes and their size depends on the oxygen levels present in the water. In stagnant water, mudpuppies have larger gills, whereas in running streams where oxygen is more prevalent, they have smaller gills. The distal portions of the gills are very filamentous and contain many capillaries. Mudpuppies also have small, flattened limbs which can be used for slowly walking on the bottoms of streams or ponds, or they can be flattened against the body during short swimming spurts. They have mucous glands which provide a slimy protective coating  Neoteny  Mudpuppies are one of many species of salamanders that fail to undergo metamorphosis. Most hypotheses surrounding the origin of Necturus's lack of metamorphosis concern the effectiveness of the thyroid gland. The thyroid gland in some salamanders, like the axolotl, produce normal thyroid hormones (THs), but cells in the organism express thyroid hormone receptors (TR) that are mutated, and do not bond correctly with thyroid hormones, leading to some salamanders in a state of perpetual juvenile-hood. In contrast to axolotls, in mudpuppies, these THs are normally expressed. However, it is believed that instead of having TH-insensitive tissues that block the effects of THs, some mudpuppy tissues, such as the external gills, have lost the ability to be regulated by TH over time. This selective insensitivity to THs suggests a normal level of activity in the hypothalamo-pituitary-thyroid axis in developing mudpuppies, unlike other salamander species. The common mudpuppy also does not have a parathyroid gland. The majority of salamanders with parathyroid glands rely on them to help with hypercalcemic regulation; hypercalcemic regulation in mudpuppies is primarily done by the pituitary gland instead. In common mudpuppies, the purpose of the absence of a parathyroid gland is poorly understood. One reason for the absence might be the lack of variability in the climate of mudpuppies, as the parathyroid glands of salamanders vary greatly depending on seasonal changes, or whether the organism hibernates. Distribution N. maculosus specimens live in streams, lakes, and ponds in the eastern part of North America. They appear in the southern section of Canada, as far south as Georgia, and from the Midwest United States to North Carolina. In the more northern sections, they are called mudpuppies, and in the southern portions, they are called waterdogs. The mudpuppy hides under cover such as rocks and logs during the day and becomes more active at night. However, in muddy waters, the mudpuppy may become active during the day. Mudpuppies can even live under the ice when lakes freeze. There is an introduced population in Maine. Diet A) Overall view of common mudpuppy mouth. B) Ventral view of vomerine and premaxillary teeth, located on the upper part of the mudpuppy mouth. C) Lower jaw, or dentary from a common mudpuppy showing the homodont dentary teeth. Specimen from the Pacific Lutheran University Natural History collection Mudpuppies use rows of teeth to eat their prey. Salamanders have three different sets of teeth: dentary, premaxillary, and vomerine teeth, which are named due to their location in the mouth. All the teeth, despite their different locations, are very similar. They are small and conical, meaning mudpuppies are homodonts due to their similar shape. The common mudpuppy never leaves its aquatic environment and therefore does not undergo morphogenesis, however many salamanders do and develop differentiated teeth. Aquatic salamander teeth are used to hinder escape of the prey from the salamander, they do not have a crushing function. This aids the salamander when feeding. When the salamander performs the \\"suck and gape\\" feeding style, the prey is pulled into the mouth, and the teeth function to hold the prey inside the mouth and prevent the prey from escaping. At both sides of their mouths their lips interlock, which allows them to use suction feeding. They are carnivorous creatures and will eat almost anything they can get into their mouths. Typically they prey upon animals such as insects, mollusks, annelids, small fish, amphibians, earthworms, and spiders. The jaw of a mudpuppy also plays a significant role in its diet. The mudpuppy jaw is considered metaautostyly, like most amphibians, meaning the jaw is more stable and that the salamander has a dentary. This affects their diet by limiting the flexibility of the jaw to take in larger prey. The mudpuppy has few predators but may include fish, crayfish, turtles, and water snakes. Fishermen also frequently catch and discard them. Reproduction Mudpuppies take six years to reach sexual maturity. Mating typically takes place in autumn, though eggs are not laid till much later. When males are ready to breed, their cloacae become swollen. Males deposit their spermatophores in the substratum of the environment. The female will then pick them up with her cloaca and store them in a small specialized gland, a spermatheca, until the eggs are fertilized. Females store the sperm until ovulation and internal fertilization take place, usually just prior to deposition in the spring. Before the eggs are deposited, male mudpuppies leave the nest. Once ready, the female deposits the eggs in a safe location, usually on the underside of a rock or log. They can lay from 20‚Äì200 eggs, usually an average of 60.

He founded the Zidichov Hasidic dynasty. He was a disciple of rabbis Moshe Leib of Sassov, Menachem Mendel of Rimanov, the Maggid of Koznitz and the Seer of Lublin. His younger brother was Rabbi Moshe of Sambor. Among Rabbi Tzvi Hirsh's students were Rabbi Yitzchak Isaac of Komarna, Rabbi Tzvi Elimelech of Dinov (the Bnei Yisaschar), Rabbi Yitzchak Isaac of Zidichov, Rabbi Shimon of Yaruslav, and Rabbi Shalom of Kaminka. Rabbi Tzvi Hirsh was very passionate about studying Kabbalah, Zohar, and the Kitvei Ari (\\"writings of Rabbi Yitzchak Luria\\") in particular. He made a tremendous effort in encouraging Jews to study these works. With the assistance of his students, some yeshivot in Galicia added the study of Kabbalah to their curriculum. Rabbi Tzvi Hirsh blended the teachings of the Baal Shem Tov with the kabbalah of the Ari. His book Ateret Tzvi includes his commentary on the Zohar. In his book Sur Mei'ra Ve'asei Tov (lit., \\"refrain from evil and do good\\"),Zevi Hirsch Eichenstein, English translation by Louis Jacobs, Turn Aside from Evil and Do Good: An Introduction and Way to the Tree of Life, 1995, The Littman Library of Jewish Civilization, he shows the path to spiritual growth with the assistance of Zohar study and the Kitvei Ari. Rabbi Yitzchak Isaac of Komarna writes in one of his books that the soul of his teacher Rabbi Tzvi Hirsh is \\"from the root of the soul of Rabbi Chaim Vital, which is close to the soul of Rabbi Akiva\\". Once Rabbi Tzvi Hirsh told his brother Rabbi Moshe of Sambor that in one of his \\"previous lives\\" he was Rabbi Yishmael Kohen Gadol (one of a series of high priests of the Second Temple, famous for his mystical visions recorded both in the Talmud and in the corpus known as Sifrei Heichalot - literature of the heavenly palaces). The righteous Jews of his generation said he had the soul of the famous Yenukah, mentioned in the Zohar portion of Balak. Another one of his students, Rabbi Yitzchak Isaac of Zidichov, said, \\"I heard from the holy mouth of my teacher that he was one of the students of Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai\\".

The station broadcasts at a power of 100 kW, from a transmitter located near Wilton, Iowa. The signal can be received in both the Cedar Rapids and Iowa City areas. KBEA-FM is owned by Townsquare Media, with studios located in Davenport, Iowa (along with the co-located KJOC, WXLP, KIIK-FM and KBOB).  Frequency history = KWPC-FM (1949-late 1960s) and KFMH-FM (late 1960s-1973)  The Muscatine allocation for 99.7 MHz dates to February 1949, when the station signed on as KWPC-FM, a sister station to KWPC (860 AM). The studios for both stations were located on the outskirts of Muscatine. Early in its history, KWPC-FM‚Äîlike most FM stations of the 1950s and 1960s‚Äîplayed beautiful, easy listening music. In the late 1960s, the station's call letters changed to KFMH, but easy listening music continued on the frequency for several more years.  KFMH-FM (1973-1994)  In June 1973, KFMH underwent a major format change as Captain Steve Bridges (who had worked at KSTT in Davenport) came in as program director (he later became a part-owner); the station began playing alternative rock, which had gained widespread popularity on the west coast. KFMH (\\"99 Plus\\" and \\"The Real FM\\" was how it was commonly known) soon gained a devoted, fiercely loyal audience, as the station played lesser-known and local artists in a variety of genres ‚Äî rock, jazz, blues, and other genres. Plus, KFMH's disc jockeys Andy Hammer, Kerry Peace, Lisa Catalona, Beth McBride, Chris Carson, Borderline Bob, and later Sean Tracy, Phil and Tom Maicke, Mary of the Heartland, Bob Just Bob, Dirty Judy, Jim Hunter, Roberto Nache, John Obvious, and Captain Steve played album cuts from popular artists. The station was known for pushing the envelope at times, but it also would change programming at a moment's notice (such as when word spread about the shooting death of John Lennon in 1980). In 1981, John Flambo became the new owner and immediately removed the one-and-a- half-hour farm report morning show and replaced it with Andy Hammer and a format matching the rest of the day. \\"The Plus\\" then made greater efforts to separate themselves from the rest of the radio dial with Kerry Peace hosting ‚ÄúOff the Beat n‚Äô Track‚Äù presenting alternative and punk rock not heard anywhere else. The 1980s ended with many changes to the station; during this time, Kerry Peace left to become a record rep for blues label Alligator. In March 1990, KFMH began transmitting from its current 1,000 foot tower in Wilton, Iowa with 100,000 watts. In 1993, KFMH moved to Davenport, where continued its alternative format for a year. It signed off at 3 p.m. on March 1, 1994 with the song \\"Your Move...I've Seen All Good People\\" by Yes, the song it signed on with on June 4, 1973. On the night it signed off, about 500 showed up outside the station to protest, but the station was locked up. Mercury Broadcasting's WKBF inquired about moving the format to its frequency at 1270 AM, but the proposal never materialized. In 2013, 19 years to the hour KFMH went off the air, \\"99 Plus KFMH\\" returned as an internet only station, with the original deejays Captain Steve, Tom Maicke, Jim Hunter, Roberto, and Mary of the Heartland. New deejays include Tommy Lang, Bill Klutho, and Patrick O'Leary. You can listen once again to Rock, Blues, Jazz, Reggae, and Alternative 24/7. 99pluskfmh.com is available on the TuneIn app, Simple Radio by Streema, and Sonos. KBOB-FM (1994-2000) On March 16, 1994, the 99.7 MHz frequency was sold to New York-based Connoisseur Communications, which changed the call letters to KBOB and its format to country (as a competitor to the Quad Cities-market's WLLR-FM). These changes outraged many loyal KFMH listeners, who feared there would no longer be a radio outlet for \\"alternative\\" music (in lieu of stations programmed by consultants); speculation that the format would move to 1270 AM never materialized. More than a decade after KFMH's demise, some fans still sorely miss the station's eclectic blend of music and programming. Steve Bridges eventually moved to Iowa City where he purchased KCJJ, a 10,000 watt station with a talk-music hybrid that reaches much of eastern Iowa; like KFMH, \\"The Mighty 1630\\" does at times push the envelope. KBOB, meanwhile, debuted to promising ratings. Part of what set the new station apart was inclusion of songs WLLR had since removed from its playlist. However, KBOB ‚Äî which later was sold to Cumulus Media ‚Äî soon languished behind the powerhouse stations in the Quad Cities market, especially WLLR, despite having the advantage of broadcasting at 100 kW; until March 1998, WLLR broadcast on a frequency whose power was 50 kW.  KBEA-FM \\"B100\\" (2000-current)  On April 5, 2000, KBOB moved to 104.9 MHz, usurping that frequency's adult contemporary format. 99.7 MHz then adopted its current Top 40 format and \\"B100\\" branding; Robb Rose was the first program director. The station's first line-up included Rose and Julia Bradley in the morning, Jeff James in middays, Steve Fuller in the afternoon drive-time, Brandon Marshall in the evening and Rachel in overnights. The station quickly gained a following, cutting into the ratings of the Quad-Cities market's dominant Top 40 station, \\"All-Hit 98.9\\" (WHTS-FM). In early 2006, WHTS was sold to the Educational Media Foundation, and along with new call letters, that station's format was changed to contemporary Christian, leaving \\"B100\\" as the only Top 40 station in the Quad Cities for the next six years. However, on February 20, 2012, Clear Channel launched a CHR format on KUUL-FM as \\"101.3 KISS FM.\\" On August 30, 2013, a deal was announced in which Townsquare Media would acquire 53 Cumulus stations, including KBEA-FM, for $238 million. The deal is part of Cumulus' acquisition of Dial Global; Townsquare and Dial Global are both controlled by Oaktree Capital Management. The sale to Townsquare was completed on November 14, 2013.

Sawyer. The book won the 1995 Nebula Award for Best Novel, and was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1996. Sawyer received a writer's reserve grant from the Ontario Arts Council in 1993 in support of his writing the novel. The story was first serialised in Analog magazine in the mid-December 1994 to March 1995 issues, under the name Hobson's Choice, before its first novel publication in May, 1995. A Hobson's choice is an apparently free choice that is really no choice at all. In this book it is a play on the main character's name and describes the choice between immortality and provable life after death.  Plot introduction  Dr. Peter Hobson invents a machine that detects a brain pattern that leaves the body after death, a pattern many believe is a soul. In order to test their theories on immortality and life after death, Hobson and his friend Sarkar Muhammed create three electronic simulations of Hobson's own personality. When people Hobson had a grudge against begin to die, he and Sarkar must try to find out which is responsible. But all three simulations ‚Äì two modified, one a 'control' ‚Äì escape Sarkar's computer, into the Internet and the World Wide Web. Characters * Dr. Peter Hobson - founder of Hobson Monitoring, a biomedical company, and devoted husband to Cathy. * Cathy Churchill Hobson - beautiful, intelligent wife of Peter, she has low self-esteem issues. Her confession to Peter that she had an affair with Hans taints their decades-long happy marriage. * Hans Larsen - coworker to Cathy, he is a promiscuous adulterer and womanizer, and cocky and boastful about it. He is maimed and murdered for having seduced Cathy. * Rod Churchill - uncaring father to Cathy, he is a retired gym teacher. He is also murdered. * Detective Sandra Philo - a detective investigating the deaths of Larsen and Churchill, she knows that the Hobsons are somehow involved. * Sarkar Muhammed - a friend and collaborator of Peter, he is a genius working in artificial intelligence Plot The novel takes place in Toronto, briefly in 1995 and chiefly in 2011. Dr. Peter Hobson, a biomedical engineer, has invented many devices in the field of home automation. He has always been haunted by memories of monitoring an EKG during the dissection of a \\"corpse\\" for organ donation when he was in graduate school; the donor's heart was still beating and the body exhibited signs of anesthesia awareness. Now, Peter devises what he calls a superEEG in order to determine the exact moment when all electrical energy ceases in the brain; he wants to precisely \\"determine that someone is dead before they begin carving out his organs.\\" Peter is hurt and angry when his beloved wife, Cathy, admits that she had sex with Hans Larsen, whom neither of them respects. A psychotherapist helps her to understand that she has low self-esteem because of emotional neglect by her critical father Rod. Peter throws himself into his work. This is the emotional set-up that drives events in the following five months. To his shock, when Peter places his superEEG on the head of a willing terminal patient, he afterwards finds in the readouts a small electrical field leaving the brain after death. He shares this discovery with his friend Sarkar Muhammed, who runs his own startup firm doing expert system design. Sarkar declares it a soul, which Peter, a skeptic, is reluctant to believe. To maintain precise scientific language, they call it a soulwave: \\"The soulwave had a distinctive electrical signature. The frequency was very high, well above that of normal electrochemical brain activity, so, even though the voltage was minuscule, it wasn't washed out in the mass of other signals within the brain.\\" Peter experiments with more terminal patients to verify his finding; he tests pregnant women to discover when the fetus gains a soulwave (at about ten weeks); and he finds that, among animals, at least chimpanzees also have souls. When Peter holds a press conference to announce his breakthrough, human society around the world undergoes a revolution. He is repeatedly asked what life after death is like, though he has no idea. In order to learn about immortality and life after death, Peter and Sarkar create three electronic simulations of Peter's own personality after a comprehensive scan of his mind and memories. From one, they seek \\"which neural nets are activated exclusively by biological concerns, and then zero those out\\" (p. 131), so that it is purely intellect; they call it Spirit. From the second, they edit all fears of aging and death, so that it \\"feels\\" itself to be immortal; they call this one Ambrotos. The third is a control, with Peter's knowledge up to the point of the brain scan. At first, the three \\"sims\\" enjoy exploring all that the Internet has to offer. One sim, however, hires a hit man to kill Hans and then, days later, Cathy's father. Detective Sandra Philo takes the case and, questioning Cathy and her co-workers, realizes at once that Cathy is concealing her relationship with Hans. She also knows Peter is rich enough to afford hiring a professional hit. What she doesn't realize is that the guilty sim is prepared to have her killed, too. Peter and Sarkar race to find a way to \\"pull the plug\\" on the sims before Philo and perhaps others die. Critical reception Besides winning the Nebula Award, The Terminal Experiment won the Prix Aurora Award for Best Long Form in English of 1995. It also earned one of the nine HOMer Awards that Sawyer has won. The novel was a Preliminary Nominee for the Bram Stoker Award, for Superior Achievement in a Novel, and was nominated for the Science Fiction Chronicle Award. Brian Stableford wrote in an overview: \\"Sawyer's work became conspicuously more ambitious in the late 1990s. The Terminal Experiment (1995) has a murder mystery subplot, but foregrounds an enquiry into the roots of ethical philosophy, employing three artificial 'clones' of its protagonist's personality as subjects in an elaborate thought experiment.\\" Steven H Silver wrote, \\"Sawyer is writing a mystery with this book, and, to a certain extent, succeeds. The pace is good, keeping you turning the pages, and the characters are likeable, even the libidinous Hans and the un-enlightened Rod. However, because of the way Sawyer creates his mystery, there is no real chance of figuring out who is responsible.\\" References External links  * * The Terminal Experiment at SFWriter.com * The Terminal Experiment at Worlds Without End Category:1995 science fiction novels Category:1995 Canadian novels Category:Novels by Robert J.

History Between 1968 and 1970, a movement gained strength in Trinidad and Tobago that was greatly influenced by the Civil Rights Movement in the United States. The National Joint Action Committee (NJAC) was formed out of the Guild of Undergraduates at the St. Augustine campus of the University of the West Indies (UWI). Under the leadership of Geddes Granger (later Makandal Daaga), NJAC and the Black Power movement appeared as a serious challenge to the authority of Prime Minister Eric Williams. This was coupled with a growing militancy by the trade union movement, led by George Weekes of the Oilfields Workers' Trade Union, Clive Nunez of the Transport and Industrial Workers Union and Basdeo Panday, then a young trade union lawyer and activist. The Black Power Revolution began with a 1970 Carnival band named Pinetoppers whose presentation entitled \\"The Truth about Africa\\" included portrayals of \\"revolutionary heroes\\" including Fidel Castro, Kwame Ture and Tubal Uriah Butler. This was followed by a series of marches and protests. Williams countered with a broadcast entitled I am for Black Power. He introduced a 5% levy to fund unemployment reduction and later established the first locally owned commercial bank. However, this intervention had little impact on the protests,  Leadership  It was mainly led by NJAC's duo of Makandal Daaga and Khafra Khambon in tandem with other various interests within the trade unions, and other social groups like Afro- Trinidadians and were noted to attract many disaffected members of the then ruling People's National Movement (PNM) under Eric Williams. A large turnout of the disaffected poor of the cities and towns, as well as those black youth of the disaffected communities were attracted to the uprising and were present in the movement, as well as youths and others from the St. Augustine campus of UWI. Escalation On 6 April 1970 a protester, Basil Davis, was killed by the police. This was followed on 13 April by the resignation of A. N. R. Robinson, Member of Parliament for Tobago East. The death of this protester led to the Movement to pick up momentum. On 18 April sugar workers went on strike, and there was talk of a general strike. In response to this, Williams proclaimed a State of Emergency on 21 April and arrested 15 Black Power leaders. Responding in turn, a portion of the Trinidad Defense Force, led by Raffique Shah and Rex Lassalle, mutinied and took hostages at the army barracks at Teteron. Through the action of the Coast Guard, led by Commander David Bloom and negotiations between the Government and the rebels, the mutiny was contained and the mutineers surrendered on 25 April. Williams made three additional speeches in which he sought to identify himself with the aims of the Black Power movement. He re-shuffled his Cabinet and removed three Ministers (including two white members) and three senators. He also introduced the Public Order Act, which reduced civil liberties in an effort to control protest marches. After public opposition, led by A. N. R. Robinson and his newly created \\"Action Committee of Democratic Citizens\\" (which later became the Democratic Action Congress), the bill was withdrawn. Attorney General Karl Hudson-Phillips offered to resign over the failure of the bill, but Williams refused his resignation.

The first chairman of the company was Sir Thomas Dalrymple Hesketh, Bart. He had previously held the same position at the Preston and Wigan Railway. Construction When it was created, the North Union Railway consisted of the line constructed by the Wigan Branch Railway(WBR) but little else. All its locomotives and rolling stock were supplied by the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. Within a month the railway appointed Charles Vignoles as engineer on the railway at a salary of ¬£1,200 (equivalent to ¬£ in ). Work was started on the construction of the Wigan to Preston section of the railway. As Preston stands upon a ridge rising sharply from the north bank of the River Ribble reaching it involved some engineering, the North Union reached its terminus by descending gradients as steep as 1 in 100 to the valley, crossing the river and cutting into the rising ground as far as Fishergate. The river bridge was of five arches, each spanning 120 ft. The line was completed in 1838 and a trial run was held on 22 October with a train running from Wigan to Preston, and the line opened to the public on 31 October 1838. The colliery line known as Springs Branch that had been authorised at the same time as WBR was opened on the same day, 31 October 1838. In 1846, in conjunction with the Ribble Navigation Company, the North Union obtained powers to build a branch to Victoria Quay on the River Ribble. This line was built to convey coal from the Wigan district to the river for shipment. The L&NWR; continued to improve the route and in 1864 installed the Winwick cut-off between Golborne junction and Winwick junction (on the former Warrington and Newton Railway) which provided a route for trains to avoid Lowton, Parkside and Earlestown junctions. Stations The NUR opened the Wigan to Preston section with the following stations: *Wigan Chapel Lane station was closed on the same day as the opening of the Wigan to Preston section of the railway on 31 October 1838. It was replaced by the slightly further north Wigan station. This station became Wigan North Western on 2 June 1924. * which closed on 31 January 1949 (this station was adjacent to the Lancashire Union railway's Boar's Head station). *Standish Lane station which was renamed Standish by 1844 and was closed on 23 May 1949. * which was replaced by a second Coppull station situated 135m West of the original on 2 September 1895, the second station closed on 6 October 1969. *Euxton which closed on 2 September 1895. *Golden Hill which was renamed in 1838 and is still open. * which was renamed Farington in October 1857 and closed on 7 March 1960. *Preston Fishergate which was renamed Preston at an unknown date. The evolution of Preston station and the railways of the area was complicated, further information is available in the Preston railway station article. Bolton to Preston The North Union Railway was concerned to protect its interests and had many disagreements with rival railways and canals. The North Union Railway opposed the proposed Bolton and Preston Railway (B&PR;), whose original Act of 15 July 1837 made for an independent route through to Preston. A further Act of 4 July 1838 was enacted withdrawing the B&PRs; powers to build beyond Chorley and instead authorised an extension to join the North Union Railway's line at Euxton, north of Chorley. The Bolton & Preston Act was passed with the proviso that the line north of Chorley should be delayed for three years so that a compromise could be reached between the two companies about running trains into Preston. There was immediate competition between the two companies for the Manchester to Preston traffic and they tried to undercut each other's fares. The North Union managed to maintain the upper hand in the competition as they were able to extract tolls from its rival for running trains along its Euxton to Preston stretch. The rivalry was short-lived as the Bolton & Preston Railway was acquired by the North Union Railway by an Act of 10 May 1844. Operations In 1834 the Wigan Branch Railway had offered John Hargreaves, an established carrier in the North West, the lease for operating the goods service on their line. Hargreaves, in partnership with his son (also called John Hargreaves) declined the offer and made a counter offer which was accepted by the new North Union Railway, as this was now after the merger of the railways. The son, John Hargreaves junior therefore became the sole lessee over the Wigan section for goods traffic with the exception of those who already had the right to operate their own trains, mainly coal mine owners. The L&MR; continued to provide all the passenger services for the line. When the first section of the Bolton to Preston line opened on 4 Feb 1841 it met the Manchester, Bolton and Bury Railway (MB&BR;) coming up from Salford which had opened on 29 May 1838. This railway was built by the Manchester, Bolton and Bury Canal Navigation and Railway Company who had in 1831 converted from a canal company. Their railway terminated at Bolton Trinity Street station and part of the enabling Act for the Preston to Bolton section made provision for the station to be converted to a through station to allow for traffic to Preston. In the same way as the L&MR; provided operational services to the WBR and NUR over the Parkside to Wigan section, so the MB&BR; provided operational services to the NUR over the Bolton to Preston Section. In 1846 arrangements were being made for the line to be leased jointly to the Grand Junction Railway (GJR) and the Manchester and Leeds Railway (M&LR;) but before this happened the GJR became part of the London and North Western Railway (L&NWR;), the arrangement continued however with the L&NWR; and the M&LR; jointly leasing the NUR. On 9 July 1847 the Manchester & Leeds Railway changed its title to the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (L&Y;) but the leasing arrangement continued. The NUR continued independently under this leasing arrangement with the L&NWR; owning and the L&YR; . This was the situation until 26 July 1889 when it was jointly absorbed by the L&NWR; and L&YR.; The NUR was absorbed by the two larger companies by the simple expedient of the section from Euxton to Bolton (the former B&PR;) being taken by the L&YR; and the section from Parkside to Euxton going to the L&NWR.; Accidents and incidents On 28 June 1847, the boiler of a locomotive exploded, injuring one person. Later years To cope with ever- increasing traffic, the line was quadrupled between 1889 and 1891. The stretch between Euxton Junction and Preston, which included the major part of Preston station, remained in joint ownership up to 1921 when the L&YR; was absorbed by the L&NWR; so from that date the former North Union Railway had only one owner. This section of the West Coast Main Line between London Euston and Carlisle had been the only part not wholly owned by the L&NWR.; Balshaw Lane and Euxton station was opened by the L&NWR; on 2 September 1905, it closed on 6 October 1969. Services restarted from this station now named Euxton Balshaw Lane on 15 December 1997.

Amado Carrillo became known as \\"El Se√±or de Los Cielos\\" (\\"The Lord of the Skies\\"), because of the large fleet of jets he used to transport drugs. He was also known for laundering money via Colombia, to finance this fleet. He died in July 1997, in a Mexican hospital, after undergoing extensive plastic surgery to change his appearance. In his final days, Carrillo was being tracked by Mexican and U.S. authorities.  Early life  Carrillo was born to Walter Vicente Carrillo Vega and Aurora Fuentes in Guamuchilito, Navolato, Sinaloa, Mexico. He had eleven siblings. Carillo was the nephew of Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo, also known as \\"Don Neto\\", the Guadalajara Cartel leader. Amado got his start in the drug business under the tutelage of his uncle Ernesto and later brought in his brothers, and eventually his son Vicente Jos√© Carrillo Leyva. Carrillo's father died in April 1986. Carillo's brother, Cipriano Carrillo Fuentes, died in 1989 under mysterious circumstances.  Career  Initially, Carrillo was part of the Guadalajara Cartel, sent to Ojinaga, Chihuahua to oversee the cocaine shipments of his uncle, Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo (\\"Don Neto\\"), and to learn about border operations from Pablo Acosta Villarreal (\\"El Zorro de Ojinaga\\"; \\"The Ojinaga Fox\\") and Rafael Aguilar Guajardo. Later, Carrillo worked with Pablo Escobar and the Cali Cartel smuggling drugs from Colombia to Mexico and the United States. He also worked with \\"El Chapo\\" (Joaquin Guzman Loera), the Arellano Felix family, and the Beltran Leyva organization.DEA Congressional Testimony, August 8, 1995 During his tenure, Carrillo reportedly built a multibillion-dollar drug empire. It was estimated that he may have made over $25 billion in revenue over the course of his career.  Death  The pressure to capture Carrillo intensified among U.S. and Mexican authorities after people in Morelos state began silent marches against governor Jorge Carrillo Olea and his presumed complacency with drug-related violence. Carrillo Fuentes owned a house three blocks from the governor's official residence and regularly held narco-fiestas in the municipality of Tetecala. Governor Carrillo Olea was forced to resign and was arrested; this type of pressure may have convinced Carrillo Fuentes to undergo facial plastic surgery and abdominal surgery liposuction to change his appearance on July 4, 1997, at Santa M√≥nica Hospital in Mexico City. However, during the operation, he died of complications apparently caused either by a certain medication or a malfunctioning respirator (there is very little paperwork regarding his death). Two of Carrillo Fuentes's bodyguards were in the operating room during the procedure. On November 7, 1997, the two physicians who performed Carrillo's surgery were found dead, encased in concrete inside steel drums, with their bodies showing signs of torture.  Ju√°rez Cartel after Carrillo  On the night of August 3, 1997, at around 9:30 p.m., four drug traffickers walked into a restaurant in Ciudad Ju√°rez, pulled out their guns, and opened fire on five diners, killing them instantly. Police estimated that more than 100 bullet casings were found at the crime scene. According to a report issued by the Los Angeles Times, four men went to the restaurant carrying at least two AK-47 automatic rifles while others stood at the doorstep. On their way out, the gunmen claimed another victim, Armando Olague, a prison official and off-duty law enforcement officer who was gunned down outside the restaurant after he had walked from a nearby bar to investigate the shooting. Reportedly, Olague had run into the restaurant from across the street with a gun in his hand to check out the commotion. It was later determined that Olague was also a known lieutenant of the Juarez Cartel. Mexican authorities declined to comment on the motives behind the killing, stating the shootout was not linked to Carrillo's death. Nonetheless, it was later stated that the perpetrators were gunmen of the Tijuana Cartel. Although confrontations between narcotraficantes were common in Ciudad Ju√°rez, they rarely occurred in public places. What happened in the restaurant threatened to usher in a new era of border crime in the city. In Ciudad Ju√°rez, the PGR seized warehouses that they believed the cartel used to store weapons and cocaine. They also seized over 60 properties all over Mexico belonging to Carrillo and began an investigation into his dealings with police and government officials. Officials also froze bank accounts amounting to $10 billion belonging to Carrillo. In April 2009, Mexican authorities arrested Carillo's son, Vicente Carrillo Leyva.Mexico catches drug baron as U.S. tightens border Reuters, April 2, 2009.  Funeral  Carrillo was given a large and lavish, expensive funeral in Guamuchilito, Sinaloa. In 2006, Governor Eduardo Bours asked the federal government to tear down Carrillo's mansion in Hermosillo, Sonora.

Although David Musser had already developed and advocated some aspects of generic programming by 1971, it was limited to a rather specialized area of software development (computer algebra). Stepanov recognized the full potential for generic programming and persuaded his then-colleagues at General Electric Research and Development (including, primarily, David Musser and Deepak Kapur) that generic programming should be pursued as a comprehensive basis for software development. At the time there was no real support in any programming language for generic programming. The first major language to provide such support was Ada, with its generic units feature. By 1987 Stepanov and Musser had developed and published an Ada library for list processing that embodied the results of much of their research on generic programming. However, Ada had not achieved much acceptance outside the defense industry and C++ seemed more likely to become widely used and provide good support for generic programming even though the language was relatively immature. Another reason for turning to C++, which Stepanov recognized early on, was that the C/C++ model of computation (which allows very flexible access to storage via pointers) is crucial to achieving generality without losing efficiency. It eventually led to the development of the Standard Template Library of C++.

In regards to the labor force, decommodification describes a \\"degree to which individual, or families, can uphold a socially acceptable standard of living independently of market participation.\\" While commodification is the transformation of goods, services, ideas and people into commodities or objects of trade, decommodification would be the \\"extent that workers can leave the labor market through choice.\\"  Contemporary research = Gender inequality  The idea of decommodification as an egalitarian concept as set forth by Esping Andersen sparked contemporary research efforts focusing on perceived inequities. In 2008, a research journal pointed out a feminist critique that \\"the absolute focus on the welfare of individuals who are already working\\" leaves a central bias in the pursuit of decommodification. Rather, the objective of women is often to be commodified in the first place so that they can enter the labor market.  Environmental impact  Decommodification has been identified by ecological economists as a strategy for sustainable consumption that acts one level up on the institutional context of consumption in Western societies as compared to strategies such as eco-efficiency and eco-sufficiency.Boulanger, P.M. (2010) \\"Three strategies for sustainable consumption\\". S.A.P.I.EN.S. 3 (2) Thus, while the eco- efficiency strategy targets the product and the eco-sufficiency strategy targets the person (the consumer as decision-maker), the decommodification strategy targets the institutional context in which consumption takes place. It aims to decrease the influence of commodities and to limit the effect of commercialization.  Social democracy paradox  Esping-Andersen's fundamental study of decommodification sparked contemporary academic research efforts hoping to resolve \\"paradoxes\\" in this application. Exiting the labor market with little or no loss of income clashed with the idea that social democracy has the goal of high labor force participation. Research efforts to resolve this paradox showed that \\"employment impeding policies\\" came out of Christian democracy institutions, not social democracy institutions. This research suggests that decommodification in the social democratic model is viable.  Example  Scandinavian countries are the closest to decommodification according to the scale created by Esping Andersen's research which places Sweden as the most decommodified country in the 1980s. Sweden's level of pensions, sickness entitlements and unemployment insurance are the highest among many other leading industrial countries. Sweden's social welfare programs are mandated by the government which also offers a de facto guarantee to the wages of citizens' rather than taking averages and creating regulations through a means-based test on citizens' wages, level of education and their past history with the law. Criticism Several free market proponents, such as Austrian School philosophers Ludwig Mises and Murray Rothbard argue that markets are the best way to supply all goods or services efficiently. Providing services via the market reduces the effect of Government inefficiency.

He played college football at Fresno State, and was drafted by the New England Patriots in the first round of the 2005 NFL Draft. Mankins also played for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Early years Mankins is from Catheys Valley, California. He attended Mariposa High School in Mariposa, California, where he was an All- League performer and the team MVP. College career After graduating from high school, he attended California State University, Fresno, where he played for the Fresno State Bulldogs football team. He redshirted in his first season in 2000. As a freshman in 2001, he started all 14 games at left tackle, blocking for quarterback David Carr and allowing only two sacks. He was named to the first team Freshman All-American team by the Sporting News. In 2002, he again started all 14 games and was on the Outland Trophy watch list. As a junior in 2003, Mankins tore his ACL in preseason practices after a vicious hit from Juan Carrasquillo and missed the season. In his final season in 2004, Mankins returned to start every game at left tackle and did not allow a sack or pressure on the season. He was a first team All-Western Athletic Conference selection and recorded a school record 82 knockdown blocks on the season. He also was the first offensive lineman in school history to win the team's MVP award. During his high school and college career he was told by Christopher Hayes he was not big enough. He proved him wrong and made the NFL. Professional career=Pre-draft measureablesNew England Patriots2005‚Äì06 seasons= Mankins was drafted with the final pick of the first round, 32nd overall, in the 2005 NFL Draft by the New England Patriots. Despite playing his entire collegiate career as a tackle, Mankins was moved to left guard by the Patriots, where he immediately stepped into the starting lineup in place of Joe Andruzzi, who departed in free agency. Mankins started all 16 games for the Patriots in 2005. In an October 16 loss to the Denver Broncos, Mankins was ejected after striking Broncos defensive lineman Ebenezer Ekuban below the belt after a missed field goal. He would go on to be named to Pro Football Weekly's 2005 All-Rookie team. In 2006, Mankins again started all 16 games for the Patriots. He scored his first NFL touchdown in the AFC Championship Game against the Indianapolis Colts when he recovered a Laurence Maroney fumble in the end zone. (Later in that same game, Colts center Jeff Saturday also recovered a fumble for a touchdown, making that game the first playoff game in NFL history in which two offensive linemen scored touchdowns). =2007‚Äì09 seasons= 2007 saw Mankins start all 16 games, allowing only one sack. Due to his performance, Mankins was named as a starting guard in the 2008 Pro Bowl and a second team All-Pro selection. For the fourth straight season, Mankins started all 16 games at left guard for the Patriots in 2008. After the loss of starting quarterback Tom Brady, Mankins helped the team's running backs to compile a total of 2,278 yards, a team's best since 1985. Mankins was named to the Patriots' 50th anniversary team in August 2009. He continued with his streak of consecutive starts, playing in every game for the Patriots again and protecting Brady to just 16 sacks (a career best). At the end of the 2009 season, Mankins was selected as a starter to his second Pro Bowl and became just the second guard, after John Hannah, in Patriots history to do so. =2010 season= Mankins (70) blocking for quarterback Tom Brady (12) Following the 2009 season, Mankins became a restricted free agent under the terms of the NFL-NFLPA collective bargaining agreement, which entered its final, uncapped year; Mankins otherwise would have been an unrestricted free agent in a normal season. The Patriots tendered at the highest possible level for a restricted free agent, $3.26 million, which have required any team signing Mankins in the restricted free agent signing period, which ended on April 15, 2010, to surrender first- and third- round draft selections to the Patriots. On June 15, with Mankins yet to sign his tender, the Patriots were able to lower Mankins' tender amount to 110% of his prior year salary, or $1.54 million. The Patriots did so, and Mankins, who was looking for a long-term contract, reacted by publicly asking for a trade. He did not attend the Patriots' mandatory June minicamp, which he was not required to attend as he was not under contract at the time. Mankins remained unsigned through the team's training camp, preseason, and the start of the regular season. Mankins reported to the Patriots and signed his tender on November 2, in advance of the team's Week 9 game against the Cleveland Browns. He did not have to report until Week 12 in order to be on the roster for the necessary six games to earn his sixth accrued season of free agency credit. The NFL granted the Patriots a two-game roster exemption for Mankins upon his reporting. However, the Patriots activated Mankins on November 6, before using either game of the exemption. Mankins started the final nine games of the season for the Patriots. For the second straight season, Mankins was elected as a starter to the Pro Bowl. =2011‚Äì2013= Mankins in December 2011 On February 14, 2011, the Patriots assigned Mankins the franchise tag. Late in negotiations to complete a new NFL/NFLPA Collective Bargaining Agreement came reports that Mankins and several other players were demanding $10 million apiece or immediate granting of free agency status before they would sign off on settlement of a lawsuit against the NFL as part of a new CBA. It was not the first time, as in the previous CBA agreement Reggie White was exempt and was able to join free agency as part of the agreement.Pro Football Talk story on Mankins and CBA On July 26, 2011, it was announced that Mankins would sign his franchise tender, worth just over $10 million, for the 2011-2012 season, and report to Patriots training camp on time. He reported on July 27. On August 10, 2011, Mankins signed a 6-year deal, which at the time made him the highest paid guard in the league. During the first Patriots game of the 2011 season, Mankins tore the ACL in his right knee. Despite this he continued the season, starting a total of 15 games in the 2011 season. He is one of the only players known to have played a season with a torn ACL and reportedly kept the injury to himself, not reporting it. He only became aware of how serious the injury was after he tore the MCL in his left knee, during the divisional round playoff game vs the Denver Broncos. Despite both ACL and MCL tears in separate knees Mankins still went on to play in Super Bowl XLVI vs the New York Giants. In 2013, Mankins was fined $10,000 for clipping as he blocked Pittsburgh Steeler nose tackle Steve McLendon. Mankins was penalized on the play which occurred in the first quarter. The play was a run by running back Stevan Ridley, which went for no gain. Tampa Bay Buccaneers Mankins was traded to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on August 26, 2014 for tight end Tim Wright and a 4th round draft pick in the 2015 NFL Draft after refusing to take a pay cut. =2014= The trade was a move by both the new head coach Lovie Smith and new general manager Jason Licht to fill the void left by Pro Bowl Guard Davin Joseph, who was released along with all other members of the offensive line from 2013 season. =2015= After anchoring an offensive line that produced the 5th best offense that season Mankins was voted as a Pro Bowl alternate, his seventh appearance in the game.

The site is in present-day Loreto Municipality of Baja California Sur state. The mission was located at . San Francisco Javier mission was founded by Jesuits of the Roman Catholic church in 1699 and closed in 1817. The missionary's objective was to convert the local Cochim√≠ Native Americans (Indians) to Christianity. A mission church survives and is in use. History The Jesuits established Misi√≥n de Nuestra Se√±ora de Loreto Conch√≥ in 1697 in Loreto, but it quickly became obvious that the Loreto site had too little water to be suitable for agriculture and, thus, could not become self- sustaining. The Jesuits were told by Cochimi visitors to Loreto of potential agricultural land across the nearby Sierra de la Giganta. In May 1699 Francisco Maria Piccolo, along with a dozen Cochim√≠ guides and ten Spanish soldiers, crossed the mountains on horseback and entered the valley the Indians called Biaund√≥, about inland from the Gulf of California. (The other part of the mission's name, Vigg√©, was the Cochim√≠ word for \\"mountain.\\") The inhabitants of a Cochim√≠ rancheria at the site were friendly and Piccolo baptized 30 of their children.Crosby, Harry W. (1994), Antigua California, Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press, pp. 43-49 In October 1699, Piccolo returned with a contingent of Spanish soldiers and Indian converts and began to construct the mission. Piccolo dedicated the mission on December 3, 1699, and San Francisco Javier (also Xavier) became the second most enduring mission established in Baja California.Burckhalter, David, Sedgwick, Mina, and Fonana, Bernard L. (2013), Baja California Missions, Tucson: University of Arizona Press, p. 21The mission was abandoned in 1701 because of a threatened Indian revolt, but reestablished by Juan de Ugarte in 1702. However, efforts to grow crops proved unsuccessful due to lack of water for irrigation and in 1710 the mission was moved a few kilometers south to its present location which had a dependable source of water from a spring. The energetic Ugarte constructed dams, aqueducts, and stone buildings. Between 1744 and 1758, Miguel del Barco was responsible for building what has been called \\"the jewel of the Baja California mission churches.\\"Vernon, Edward W. (2002), Las Misiones Antiguas: The Spanish Missions of Baja California, 1683‚Äì1855. Santa Barbara, California: Viejo Press, p. 26 Native population The Cochim√≠ were nomadic and semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who dwelt in the austere deserts and mountains of the central portion of the Baja California peninsula. The Cochim√≠ were considered by the Jesuits to be less warlike and more accepting of missions and missionaries than their southern neighbors, the Guaycura and Pericues.Crosby, pp. 59, 93 Food given out by the Jesuits initially drew the Cochim√≠ to the mission, but over the longer term, the missionaries attempted to make the Cochim√≠ sedentary farmers and herders of domestic animals.Aschmann, Homer (1959), The Central Desert of Baja California: Demography and Ecology, Berkeley: University of California Press, p. 24 However, the concentration of the population at the mission facilitated the spread of European diseases, such as smallpox and measles. The ravages of disease caused the native population to decline steadily in the 18th century. The mission had a population of 482 in 1768, but the numbers declined to 83 in 1808.Jackson, Robert H.

(pronounced \\"lazy boy\\") is an American furniture manufacturer based in Monroe, Michigan, USA, that makes home furniture, including upholstered recliners, sofas, stationary chairs, lift chairs and sleeper sofas. The company employs more than 11,000 people. La-Z-Boy furniture is sold in thousands of retail residential outlets in the United States and Canada and is manufactured and distributed under license in other countries including the United Kingdom, Australia, Germany, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Turkey and South Africa. La-Z-Boy holds US and international patents on more than 200 different styles and mechanisms. La-Z-Boy Incorporated is divided into three reportable operating segments: the Upholstery Group, the Casegoods Group and the Retail Group. The Upholstery Group primarily manufactures and sells upholstered furniture to furniture retailers and proprietary stores. This includes recliners and motion furniture, sofas, lift chairs, loveseats, chairs, ottomans and sleeper sofas. The Casegoods Group primarily sells manufactured or imported wood furniture to furniture retailers, including tables, chairs, entertainment centers, headboards, dressers, accent pieces and some coordinated upholstered furniture. The Retail Group consists of 70 company-owned stores in the US. The Retail Group sells mainly upholstered furniture to end consumers through the retail network. La- Z-Boy includes various companies and brands including La-Z-Boy Residential, La-Z-Boy Kids, La-Z-Boy Hospitality, Lea Furniture, American Drew, Kincaid Furniture, Bauhaus USA Furniture, Hammary Furniture and England Furniture Incorporated. In July 2018 it was announced that La-Z-Boy was acquiring online furniture company Joybird for an undisclosed amount.Daphne Howland, \\"La-Z-Boy snaps up Joybird,\\" RetailDive.com, July 19, 2018. History=Early history A location at the Savi Ranch Center in Yorba Linda La-Z-Boy Furniture Gallery on Rte. 1 in Saugus, Massachusetts, in 2001 La-Z-Boy in Ontario In 1927, cousins Edward M. Knabusch and Edwin J. Shoemaker partnered and invested in the furniture business in the town of Monroe, Michigan. They set out to design a chair for what they called \\"nature‚Äôs way of relaxing.\\" Using orange crates to mock-up and refine their idea, they invented a wood- slat porch chair with a reclining mechanism. Knabusch and Shoemaker then upholstered their innovation and marketed it as a year-round chair. The chair was a success; they held a contest to name it‚ÄîLa-Z-Boy was the winner. In 1969, after years primarily as a manufacturer of recliners, La-Z-Boy started designing other products including reclining sofas, sleep sofas and modular groups. 1981 sales were $150 million. In 1983, La-Z-Boy introduced its first line of stationary sofas and occasional chairs, later offering a full line of home furnishings. The LADD Furniture deal, decline, and recovery Richard R. Allen, Don A. Hunziker and William O. Fenn borrowed $70 million to buy Lea, American Drew and Daystrom from Sperry & Hutchinson in 1981.

A8. LADD Industries moved from High Point, North Carolina to Grandover in Greensboro, North Carolina in November 1997, becoming the first company to locate its headquarters there. At the time it was the fifth-largest American furniture maker, with $500 million in sales, and the brands American Drew, American of Martinsville, Barclay, Clayton Marcus, Lea, Pennsylvania House and Pilliod.Scott Andron, \\"LADD Celebrates New Headquarters,\\" Greensboro News & Record, December 5, 1997, p. B8. In September 1999, La-Z-Boy, at the time the largest American upholstered furniture manufacturer, bought LADD, the seventh-largest American furniture maker, for $197.8 million in stock and $101.5 million in assumed debt. Saul Cutler of BDO Seidman said the deal \\"sets up La-Z-Boy as an industry behemoth.\\" The deal, approved in January 2000, gave La-Z-Boy $2 billion in sales and made it one of the country's two largest furniture makers, Furniture Brands International being the other. On July 23, 2001, La-Z-Boy announced the LADD name would cease to exist. John J. Case, president of La-Z-Boy Residential, moved to head the new La-Z-Boy upholstery group, which included Bauhaus, Centurion, Clayton Marcus, England, HickoryMark, La-Z-Boy, Sam Moore and La-Z-Boy Contract Furniture. Don L. Mitchell, who headed the LADD casegoods group, would take the same job at the La-Z-Boy casegoods group, including Alexvale, American Drew, Hammary, Kincaid, Lea, Pennsylvania House, Pilliod and American of Martinsville.Fran Daniel, \\"Restructuring of La-Z-Boy Creates Two New Groups,\\" Winston-Salem Journal, August 2, 2001, p. D1. Competition from China hurt many American furniture makers, and particularly La-Z-Boy's strategy of buying LADD to improve its casegoods position. In 2005, La-Z-Boy chairman Pat Norton called the LADD deal \\"the biggest mistake that I have ever made in the furniture industry.\\"Richard Craver, \\"The End of an Era: Furniture Manufacturing in the Triad Has Suffered Thousands of Job Losses in Face of Rising Tide of Imports,\\" Winston-Salem Journal, October 9, 2005, p.

Sixteen of the former LADD plants had been sold or closed. On September 6, 2007, La-Z-Boy announced the sale of Pennsylvania House to Universal Furniture. Later that month came the sale of Clayton Marcus to Sun Capital affiliate Lexington-Rowe, leaving only American Drew and Lea among the LADD divisions. Also sold was the Sam Moore division, in February 2007 to Hooker Furniture. La-Z-Boy was still number three, with $1.5 billion in shipments.Richard Craver, \\"Sun Gets New Deal: La-Z-Boy to Sell Clayton Marcus to Lexington-Rowe,\\" Winston-Salem Journal, September 14, 2007, p.

B2. Late in 2006, La-Z-Boy had 7000 employees, down from 13,000 six years earlier. The company began working on its image, telling consumers the company offered more than recliners. The company reduced its warehouses from twelve to five and announced plans to add 50 New Generation stores to the 334 the company already had; half of those used the new format already.\\"La-Z-Boy Feels Energetic about Future: Company Is Restructuring to Return the Brand to Profitability,\\" Winston-Salem Journal, August 30, 2006, p.

The High Point office would continue operations for American Drew, Hammary, and Kincaid. Licensed manufacturers In 1970, Morgan Furniture of Takapuna, New Zealand, founded by Jack Morgan, commenced manufacture of the La-Z-Boy recliner for Australia and New Zealand. In September 2007 his son Graham Morgan announced that the company was to import the furniture from China and Thailand with the loss of around 200 Auckland manufacturing jobs.

Although little-known today, Cooper was also the highest-ranking Confederate general during the American Civil War. After the conflict, he remained in Virginia as a farmer. Early life and career Samuel Cooper was born in New Hackensack, Dutchess County, New York.Davis, William C. \\"General Samuel Cooper.\\" In Leaders of the Lost Cause: New Perspectives on the Confederate High Command, edited by Gary W.

Cooper's place of birth is often incorrectly given as Hackensack, New Jersey, by Dupuy (p. 189), Eicher (p. 184), Wakelyn (p. 150), and Wright (p. 9); place of birth given as Dutchess County, New York, by Warner (p. 62), or just New York by Snow (p. 305); place of birth given as New Hackensack, New York, by both websites \\"leeslieutenants.com\\" and \\"generalcooper.com\\". He was a son of Samuel Cooper and his wife Mary Horton.Wakelyn, p. 150. In 1813 he entered the United States Military Academy at age 15 and graduated 36th in a class of 40 two years later (the customary length of study in that period.) He was appointed a brevet second lieutenant in the U.S. Light Artillery on December 11, 1815. He was promoted to first lieutenant in 1821 and to captain in 1836.Eicher, p. 185. In 1827, Cooper married Sarah Maria Mason, becoming the brother-in-law of future Confederate diplomat James M. Mason and later the father-in-law of Union General Frank Wheaton. Sarah's sister, Ann Maria Mason, was the mother of Confederate cavalry general Fitzhugh Lee, a nephew of Robert E. Lee, while her brother John Mason, was a son-in-law of Gen. Alexander Macomb. Cooper served as aide-de-camp for Gen. Macomb from 1828 to 1836 and under his supervision authored A Concise System of Instructions and Regulations for the Militia and Volunteers of the United States. Cooper in the U.S. Army Cooper served in numerous artillery units until 1837, when he was appointed chief clerk of the U.S. War Department. In 1838 he received a brevet promotion to major and was appointed assistant adjutant general of the Army. Nine years later, with a brevet as lieutenant colonel, he served in the same capacity. Cooper's service in the Second Seminole War of 1841‚Äì42 was a rare departure for him from Washington, D.C. He was chief of staff for Col. William J. Worth, and after hostilities ended he returned to staff duty in Washington from 1842 to 1845.Dupuy, pp. 189‚Äì90. Cooper received a brevet promotion to colonel on May 30, 1848, for his War Department service in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, and was promoted to the permanent rank of colonel in the regular army and appointed the army's Adjutant General on July 15, 1852. Cooper also served very briefly as acting U.S. Secretary of War in 1857.Eicher, p. 185. He held the position from March 3 to 6, 1857. Cooper was also a slave owner. At the time of the 1850 census, he owned six slaves. Civil War service At the beginning of the Civil War, Cooper's loyalties were with the South. His wife's family was from Virginia, and he had a close friendship with Jefferson Davis, who had also been U.S. Secretary of War.Warner, pp. 62-3. One of his last official acts as Adjutant General of the U.S. Army was to sign an order dismissing Brig. Gen. David E. Twiggs from the army. Twiggs had surrendered his command and supplies in Texas to the Confederacy (and was shortly thereafter made a Confederate major general.) This order was dated March 1, 1861, and Cooper resigned six days later. He traveled to Montgomery, Alabama, at the time the Confederacy's capital, to join the Confederate States Army. On reaching Montgomery, Cooper was immediately given a commission as a brigadier general on March 16, 1861. He served as both Adjutant General and Inspector General of the Confederate Army, a post he held until the end of the war. Cooper provided much-needed organization and knowledge to the fledgling Confederate War Department, drawing on his years performing such duties as Adjutant General of the U.S. Army.Warner, p. 63. On May 16, 1861, Cooper was promoted to full general in the Confederate Army. He was one of five men promoted to the grade at that time, and one of only seven during the war, but with the earliest date of rank. Thus, despite his relative obscurity today, he outranked such luminaries as Albert Sidney Johnston, Robert E. Lee, Joseph E. Johnston, and P. G. T. Beauregard.Eicher, p. 807. Generals (ACSA) Line Command List Cooper reported directly to Confederate President Jefferson Davis. At the war's end in 1865, Cooper surrendered and was paroled on May 3 at Charlotte, North Carolina. While building defenses near Washington, D.C., Union forces demolished his home and used its bricks to build a fort dubbed \\"Traitor's Hill\\" in Cooper's honor. Postbellum life Cooper's last official act in office was to preserve the official records of the Confederate Army and turn them over intact to the United States government, where they form a part of the Official Records, The War of the Rebellion: a Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies, published starting in 1880. Military historians have highly regarded Cooper for this action.Lee's Lieutenants site biography of Cooper: \\"This contribution is said to be Samuel's most lasting contribution to the Confederacy, in overseeing the removal of War Department records from Richmond in April 1865, and protecting them until they could be turned over to Federal authorities...\\" Historian Ezra J. Warner believed that in doing so Cooper was \\"thereby making a priceless contribution to the history of the period.\\" After the war, Cooper was a farmer at his home, Cameron, near Alexandria, Virginia. His house had been taken over by the U.S. government during the war and turned into a fort, but he was able to move into what had been an overseer's house. Due to his age Cooper earned a meager living. On August 4, 1870, Robert E. Lee, on the behalf of other former Confederates, sent Cooper $300. Lee wrote to him saying, \\"To this sum I have only been able to add $100, but I hope it may enable you to supply some immediate want and prevent you from taxing your strength too much.\\" Samuel Cooper died at his home in 1876, and is buried in Alexandria's Christ Church Episcopal Cemetery.

Already before World War I, Oticon increased its sales volume to cover Scandinavia and Saint Petersburg. In the twenties and thirties, a network of agents was established in Europe. During World War II, Oticon started its own production due to the scarcity of goods from other countries. In 1957, William and his wife Ida Emilie donated the Demant family's shares in the company to the Oticon Foundation which is today called The William Demant Foundation. The Foundation's general aim is charity with particular emphasis on helping people with a hearing impairment and today the Oticon Foundation is the main shareholder in William Demant Holding A/S with a holding of app. 61%.  International expansion  During the 1990s the company expanded further, buying the Swiss hearing aid manufacturer Bernafon, Phonic Ear, the headset manufacturer DanaCom and Interacoustics. In 1995 the company was listed at the Copenhagen Stock Exchange. In 1997 it was decided to change the name of the parent company from Oticon Holding A/S to William Demant Holding A/S because it was considered disadvantageous to use the same name, both for the Group, and for one of its businesses.

Saku Koivu, former captain of the Montreal Canadiens. In team sport, captain is a title given to a member of the team. The title is frequently honorary, but in some cases the captain may have significant responsibility for strategy and teamwork while the game is in progress on the field. In either case, it is a position that indicates honor and respect from one's teammates ‚Äì recognition as a leader by one's peers. In association football and cricket, a captain is also known as a skipper. Various sports have differing roles and responsibilities for team captains. Depending on the sport, team captains may be given the responsibility of interacting with game officials regarding application and interpretation of the rules. In many team sports, the captains represent their respective teams when the match official does the coin toss at the beginning of the game. The team captain, in some sports, is selected by the team coach, who may consider factors ranging from playing ability to leadership to serving as a good moral example to the team. Coaches may also choose to change team captains from time to time, or to have a rotation of team captains. Some of the greatest captains in history are the ones with the most subtle of traits that are required for success. From Sam Walker in his book The Captain Class he states that a captain is \\"the most important factor for a team's success\\".  Responsibilities of a captain  The responsibilities of a captain vary from sport to sport, but overall help determine the game. In sports like cricket or volleyball, the decision for the two teams to be on either defence or offence is determined with a coin toss and a decision made by the captains. This decision is crucial for the captain because they will decide the beginning of the game and quite possibly how it all plays out. A captain is also the first one a referee looks too while explaining the results of a play or giving a foul, or flag. Oftentimes a referee will not discuss these matters with any other player than a captain or a coach. This is important because the reaction of the captain may or may not determine how the referee will proceed. A captain must stay calm and cool headed when talking with a referee to ensure the most accurate determinants of the game.

The series aired from 15 January 2003 to 2005 on the BBC2 in the United Kingdom. It was created by Peter Curtis. The ten-minute preschool show features seven friendly tub toys who come to life and tell stories. Hasbro was licensed to produce a toy line for the show.https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/hits-bath-toys-look-to-build-on-bobs- success-258t06kl9rs Overview Seven anthropomorphic, friendly British bath toys called the Rubbadubbers live a peaceful life in the bathroom of a house in the fictional town of Bathsville City. The toys belong to two children who live at the house named Benjie and Sis (however, they are never seen on- screen). Whenever the children or anyone else are not present, the Rubbadubbers come to life and begin a fun activity. But in every episode, one of the toys become dissatisfied with the way the activity or situation goes. He/she then wishes for it to go as planned by beginning the wish with 'if only...' . Suddenly, the Rubbadubber begins dreaming about an alternate reality where the wish comes true. Some of the other Rubbadubbers appear in the dream world as well, where they play different versions of their regular selves in order to either assist or hinder the character that made the wish. It always turns out that the wish goes wrong in the dream world, much to the character's disappointment. The character then complains again with another 'if only...', which automatically stops the dream. From the dream, the character learns to be careful with what they wish for, and then decides that instead of changing the real-world situation to their will, they should simply leave it as it was and find a way to have fun with it. All the Rubbadubbers are then happy again. Each episode ends with Reg the robot, one of the Rubbadubbers, announcing to the others that Benjie and Sis are arriving for their bath. The toys then excitedly prepare themselves for it.  Characters = Rubbadubbers  *Tubb (voiced by John Gordon Sinclair) is a male Scottish rubber frog and the leader of the Rubbadubbers. He is admired by everyone for his cool attitude and enjoys cleaning anything with his cotton bud and floating on a green lily pad. Tubb's catchphrase is 'swimmin'!' *Sploshy (voiced by Maria Darling) is a female English starfish sponge. She speaks in a childish voice, is very energetic (she is often seen cartwheeling) and is known to have a short temper. Sploshy's catchphrase is 'splish, splash, splosh!' *Finbar (voiced by Sean Hughes) is a male Irish wind-up shark. He often calls himself in third-person 'the mighty, scary shark', while often playing games involving pretend hunting and scaring. He also frequently uses the word 'mighty' in place of 'very' to describe things. In the dream worlds, he usually plays roles that rival the character that made the wish (such as robbers, monsters and even his regular self). Finbar's pirate-like catchphrase is 'arr, arr, arr!' (one which he uses countless times). *Terence (voiced by John Gordon Sinclair) is a male English soap bottle who resembles a crocodile. He can blow bubbles out of his nose and heavily dislikes getting splashed, often avoiding water altogether. He has a favourite, red toothbrush for cleaning his one tooth. Terence also has several spots on his back and doesn't have a catchphrase. *Winona (voiced by Maria Darling) is a female purple rubber baby whale. She is mute, thus she cannot speak and make 'if only' wishes, but she can make squeaking sounds in order to communicate with the Rubbadubbers. She can also squirt water from her blowhole and perform tail tricks. *Reg (voiced by John Gordon Sinclair) is a male Australian toy robot and is the supporting leader of the Rubbadubbers. Just like Terence, he avoids water, as simply getting splashed makes him malfunction. He also stutters rather often. He plays with the others but is always on the lookout for Benjie and Sis' presence in order to make the Rubbadubbers prepare themselves for bath time. At the end of every episode, he announces their arrival with his catchphrase: 'Rubbadubbers! Rubbadubbers! Benjie and Sis/the children are coming! Bath time scramble!' *Amelia (voiced by Maria Darling) is a female English aeroplane-submarine hybrid toy. Likely named after Amelia Earhart, she and the Rubbadubbers often call her 'the flying submarine'. She is very energetic (like Sploshy), is usually rather happy and loves to try new things, fly around the bathroom and perform tricks.  Others  *Lawrence (voiced by John Gordon Sinclair) is a male English soap bottle that resembles a crocodile. He only appears in the episode 'Terence's Double Trouble' and plays Terence's almost-fully-identical friend in Terence's dream. But the only differences to him and Terence are that the tie that he wears is blue (Terence has a red one), he doesn't have a toothbrush, he has two teeth (Terence has one) and can do better tie tricks than Terence. *Benjie and Sis are the two owners of the Rubbadubbers that are never seen on-screen. They are two young human siblings that are presumably British. Whenever they need to use the bathroom, Reg the robot alerts the Rubbadubbers to prepare for their arrival.

He was the youngest son of Emperor Manuel I and his third wife, Irene Syrikaina, a Trapezuntine noblewoman. John succeeded to the throne after his full-brother George was betrayed by his archons on the mountain of Taurezion. It was during his reign that the style of the rulers of Trebizond changed; until then, they claimed the traditional title of the Byzantine emperors, \\"Emperor and Autocrat of the Romans\\", but from John II on they changed it to \\"Emperor and Autocrat of all the East, the Iberians, and the Transmarine Provinces\\", although Iberia had been lost in the reign of Andronikos I Gidos.William Miller, Trebizond: The last Greek Empire of the Byzantine Era: 1204‚Äì1461, 1926 (Chicago: Argonaut, 1969), p. 29 John is the first ruler of Trebizond for whom we know more than a few incidents and hints; there is enough information to compose a connected narrative of the first part of his reign. The chronicle of Michael Panaretos, which is often terse and even cryptic, is relatively full for John's reign, and external sources add further details to Panaretos' account. Emperor John II faced many challenges to his rule, which partly explains his marriage to the daughter of the Byzantine emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos. This insecurity may explain the sole instance where two Emperors of Trebizond appear on the coins of this polity: John and his oldest son, Alexios.Otto Retowski, Die Muenzen der Komnenen von Trapezunt, 1911 (Braunschweig: Klinkhardt & Biermann, 1974), pp. 129‚Äì131 By associating himself with his son Alexios on these coins, John may be advertising his choice for his successor. Life John was born ca. 1262/3, the son of Manuel I (reigned 1238‚Äì1263) and his wife, Irene Syrikaina. John's reign was marked from the beginning with instability. He came to the throne in June 1280, following the betrayal and death of his brother George (r. 1266‚Äì1280) by his own officials.Panaretos, Chronicle, ch. 4; translated in A. Bryer, \\"The Fate of George Komnenos, Ruler of Trebizond (1266‚Äì1280),\\" Byzantinische Zeitschrift, 66 (1973), p. 333 His first recorded act as Emperor was in 1281, when he received an embassy from Michael VIII Palaiologos (r. 1259‚Äì1282) consisting of George Acropolites and a prominent churchman by the name of Xiphilinos; the goal of this mission was to convince John to discontinue using the title of \\"Emperor and Autocrat of the Romans\\". Michael had gained the throne of the Empire of Nicaea through a coup against the youthful heir John IV Laskaris some 20 years before, then gained possession of Constantinople itself from the Latin Empire, and based on this achievement Michael believed that only he had the right to this title. This was not the only reason the Byzantine emperor regarded John as a threat: some opponents of Michael's acceptance of union with the Western Church saw John as a viable Orthodox candidate for the imperial throne. Michael considered high- ranking members of the Byzantine aristocracy who refused to embrace the union as threats to his reign, and they were imprisoned, flogged, blinded, or murdered.Donald M. Nicol, The last centuries of Byzantium, 1261‚Äì1453, second edition (Cambridge: University Press, 1993), pp. 75, 78 Michael had repeatedly petitioned John's predecessors to discontinue using the title of the traditional imperial title. When Acropolites and Xiphilinos presented the invitation of his daughter's hand in return for ceding his ancestral title, John refused this offer.George Finlay, The History of Greece and the Empire of Trebizond, (1204‚Äì1461) (Edinburgh: William Blackwood, 1851), p. 400; Miller, Trebizond, pp. 28f. Although both Finlay and William Miller both recount the exchange of embassies, Finlay's account provides more details. John replied that he was following the precedent set by his predecessors and that the nobility of Trebizond would not allow him to renounce the traditional title. Once Akropolites left Trebizond, John was faced with a rebellion led by one Papadopoulos, which according to Finlay gained control of the citadel and made John their prisoner. Finlay states that while it is not \\"possible to establish the complicity of the Byzantine agents in this business\\", he considers that they likely had a hand in the matter. As Finlay points out, regardless of Michael's possible machinations, \\"there cannot be a doubt that it [the revolt] was the cause of producing a great change in the views of the emperor of Trebizond and his court\\".Finlay, History of Greece, p. 401 Following the suppression of Papadopoulos' revolt, a second embassy from Michael arrived at Trebizond, composed of Demetrios Iatropoulos, logothetes ton oikeiakon, and a high ecclesiastic, who offered the bargain once again. This time John agreed to the marriage, but explained it was impossible for him to lay aside the imperial title, which had been borne by his ancestors. \\"The title of Basileus, the purple boots, the robes embroidered with eagles, and the prostrations of the powerful chiefs of the aristocracy, were dear to the pride of the citizens of Trebizond, and attached them to the person of the emperors.\\" After pledges of sincerity from Michael were made, John agreed to the marriage. However, when he reached Constantinople, his hosts induced him, before he entered the city, to lay aside his purple boots and imperial robes out of respect for Michael Palaiologos‚Äîdespite the fact his future father-in-law was absent campaigning against the Turks.Finlay, History of Greece, p. 402; Miller, Trebizond, p. 29 In exchange for this concession, Michael awarded John with the title of Despot. Michael died before the wedding took place. While John was away at Constantinople, David VI Narin, the Georgian King of Imereti, besieged the capital. Though King David failed to take the city, the Georgians occupied several provinces.Miller, Trebizond, p. 30 John left for Trebizond on 25 April 1282 with his new wife, Eudokia Palaiologina. Not long after John arrived home, he was confronted by two new threats to his reign. The first was from his half-brother George, who returned to Trebizond and made an unsuccessful attempt to seize the throne. Next was his half-sister Theodora, daughter of Manuel I by his Georgian wife, Rusudan, who apparently deposed him in 1284 to rule for a short time before making a \\"sudden flight\\" (in Michael Panaretos' words) from Trebizond; Michel Kur≈°anskis suggests he may have taken refuge in Tripolis.Kur≈°anskis, \\"L'usurpation de Th√©odora Grande Comn√®ne\\", Revue des √©tudes byzantines, 33 (1975), p. 203 John was restored to the throne no later than 1285.Panaretos, Chronicle, ch. 5; translated by Bryer, \\"The fate of George Komnenos,\\" p. 333f Panaretos, our primary source for his reign, offers us few details about the remainder of his reign. His account of John's reign‚Äîwhich amounts to three paragraphs‚Äîconcludes with the statement that it was \\"during his reign the Turks seized Chalybia and launched a great invasion, so that all those places became uninhabited.\\" During the 1290s, the √únye fortress on the western border of the country was built by him.Zehiroglu, Ahmet M. ; \\"Trabzon Imparatorlugu\\" 2016 () ; p. 100 John died at Limnia in 1297. John Lazaropoulos, in his Logos, notes that when his son Alexios succeeded him, the western part of his realm was under heavy pressure from \\"the godless Agarenes\\" and only Kerasous, part of Chalybia, Oinaion, and \\"the thirteen towns or forts of Limnia\\" remained to the Empire; John may have been leading his forces against the enemy when he died.John Lazaropoulos, Logos, ll. 256‚Äì265; translated by Jan Olof Rosenqvist, The Hagiographic Dossier of St Eugenios of Trebizond in Codex Athous Dionysiou 154 (Uppsala: University Press, 1996), p. 219 His body was transported to his capital and interred in the Panagia Chrysokephalos Church (\\"Golden-headed\\" Virgin). Portraits of John and his wife Eudokia could be seen in the church of St. Gregory of Nyssa, prior to its reconstruction in 1863. These portraits were notable that his robes were adorned with the single-headed eagle \\"the special emblem of the Comneni of Trebizond\\", while her robes bore the double-headed eagle of Byzantium.Miller, Trebizond, pp. 32f  Foreign policy  It was in the later half of John's reign that his Empire attracted attention from the West. For most of the 13th century, Trebizond had not been on the minds of Western leaders: for example, they had played no part in the Council of Lyons in 1274.Anthony Bryer, \\"Trebizond and Rome\\", Archeion Pontou, 26 (1964), p. 293 That changed in the 1290s. Pope Nicholas IV wrote two letters in 1291 inviting John II to convert to Catholicism, join in a new crusade for the recovery of the Holy Land and be Christianity's envoy to the Mongols. The following year an English embassy to the Mongols passed through Trebizond; Anthony Bryer notes John did little for them except lend them \\"his palace chef to show how the local delicacies of the Empire were cooked.\\"Bryer, \\"Trebizond and Rome\\", p. 295 About this time a Genoese colony was established in Trebizond, perhaps as early as 1290, for the English embassy records meeting a merchant of Genoa, Nicolo d'Oria, in Trebizond; he may have been the Genoese consul.Bryer, \\"Trebizond and Rome\\", p. 297 Also in the first years of this decade there is evidence that the Franciscans established a convent in Trebizond, which not only served as their base for evangelizing Anatolia, but provided friars to minister to the Genoese in that city.Bryer, \\"Trebizond and Rome\\", pp. 293‚Äì7  Family and succession  John II is known to have two sons by Eudokia Palaiologina: # Alexios II, who succeeded as emperor # Michael References External links  *Vougiouklaki Penelope, \\"John II Grand Komnenos\\", Encyclopedia of the Hellenic World: Asia Minor Category:1262 births Category:1297 deaths Category:13th-century emperors of Trebizond Category:Grand Komnenos dynasty Category:Eastern Orthodox monarchs Category:Despots (court title) ","title":"John II of Trebizond"},{"id":"1874469","text":"The Save-On-Foods Memorial Centre (SOFMC) is an indoor arena located in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, and is the largest arena in British Columbia outside of Vancouver.

The highway connects US Highway 2 (US 2) with M-28 west of Newberry. The designation has been used twice in the UP, once in 1941 for a former section of US 2 between Rexton and Epoufette, and the second in 1949 for the current corridor. The second version included a section that ran north of Newberry along what is now M-123, but it was truncated to its current routing in the 1960s. Since 1993, the trunkline has been dedicated to the 117th Quartermaster Battalion, a former National Guard unit from Kingsford. Route description The highway begins at US 2, one mile (1.6 km) south of Engadine and crosses the Canadian National Railway line before entering town. In Engadine, M-117 meets the western terminus of H-40 which runs on Hiawatha Trail. The trunkline passes a small pond in town and some farm fields north of Engadine. The terrain transitions to forest as the highway crosses into Luce County. The route angles slightly to the northeast to avoid Kaks Lake south of M-28 near Newberry. M-117 provides an important connection between two of the main highways in the UP. This connection is listed on the National Highway System, a network of roadways important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. Of the ten state trunklines that connect M-28 and US 2, M-117 is one of three that do not overlap either. The others are US 45 and Interstate 75. As part of the state's maintenance of M-117, the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) tracks the volume of traffic that uses the roadway. These volumes are expressed using a metric called annual average daily traffic, which is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway. MDOT's surveys in 2010 showed that between 1,392 and 1,986 vehicles used the highway per day. History US 2 was rerouted in 1941 between Gould City and Epoufette, with the previous routing between Epoufette and Rexton becoming a new M-117. The route of M-117 was replaced by a realigned M-48 in 1949. The M-117 designation was transferred to a new routing between Engadine and Newberry at that time, and extended east concurrent along M-28 and north through Newberry on Business M-28 (BUS M-28), replacing a section of M-48. North of town, M-117 extended past BUS M-28 to Four Mile Corner along the former M-48. M-117 in Mackinac County was shifted to a new routing along Country Avenue in 1957. The previous routing was transferred to local control at the same time. M-117 was truncated to M-28 west of Newberry in late 1961 or early 1962. The section of highway north of M-28 through Newberry to Four Mile Corner was included in an extension of M-123 between Newberry and Paradise. M-117 was dedicated in 1993 to the deactivated 117th Quartermaster Battalion based out of Kingsford.

Most of the line is in use today as part of the West Coast Main Line railway and has been electrified. None of the L&PJR; stations is still in use. A chaotic situation developed in which the company did not have a legal board of directors and the Carlisle company ran unauthorised trains over the line. The Lancaster Canal Company had a yearly lease of the line and was unwilling to spend money on improvements without security of tenure. No proper system of safe operation was imposed and in 1848 a rear-end collision took place at Bay Horse station exposing the shortcomings. The situation was regularised at the end of 1848 when the Lancaster and Carlisle Railway took control. By then the London and North Western Railway was exercising oversight of the L&CR;, and formal transfer to the LNWR took place in 1859.  Conception and authorisation  The Lancaster and Preston Junction Railway in 1840 As the railway network of Great Britain developed, a line connecting the north-west of England to Scotland was suggested by Joseph Locke in 1835. The North Union Railway was authorised in 1834, taking up unused powers to build a line to Preston from the south. This aroused considerable interest in Lancaster where a railway connection was thought highly desirable. At a public meeting on 12 April 1836 it was agreed to build a line between Lancaster and Preston. The NUR connection from Wigan to Preston did not open until 1838.Brian Reed, Crewe to Carlisle, Ian Allan, London, 1969, , pages 79 and 80Geoffrey Holt and Gordon Biddle, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: volume 10: the North West, David St John Thomas, Nairn, 1986, , page 224Francis Whishaw, The Railways of Great Britain and Ireland Practically Described and Illustrated, John Weale, London, 1842, pages 167-172 Lancaster would not wait for the NUR line to Preston to be ready, and on 5 May 1837 the Lancaster and Preston Junction Railway was authorised by Parliament. Share capital was ¬£250,000.Bob Gregson, The London and North Western Railway around Preston, Atkinson Publications Ltd, Preston, 2012, , page 21Donald J Grant, Directory of the Railway Companies of Great Britain, Matador Publishers, Kibworth Beauchamp, 2017, , page 304 Construction was expected to be straightforward and the return on investment was anticipated to be 10%, revised to 18% before opening. The line was twenty miles (32 km) long and the engineer was Joseph Locke. The Lancaster terminus was to be on South Road, south of the Lancaster Canal adjacent to Railway Street. At this stage any route northwards was uncertain and the canal was an important connection. When completed the station comprised a handsome building. The company made its Preston terminus at Dock Street near the Lancaster Canal, but the site had no other accommodation. The rails were of the parallel form, (that is, not fish-bellied). Larch sleepers were used on embankments and stone block sleepers elsewhere. Opening The L&PJR;'s Lancaster terminus is now part of the city's hospital The line was opened ceremonially on 25 June 1840 and a public service operated from the following day. Five passenger trains ran each way every weekday, of which two had through coaches to and from London; on Sundays, only these \\"mail\\" trains ran. Only one train a day conveyed third class passengers.Reed, page 81Gregson, page 22 Traffic was disappointing: while Lancaster remained a terminus, its trade alone could not sustain a railway particularly because of competition from the Lancaster Canal whose packet boats had operated since 1833. They were more comfortable than railway carriages and heated in winter. The canal company lowered its fares when the railway opened and the canal ran close to Garstang, the only other sizable intermediate settlement. The boats were drawn by two horses at a canter.Reed, page 84Holt and Biddle, page 225M D Greville and G O Holt, Railway Development in Preston -- 1, in Railway Magazine, February 1960 Conflict with the North Union Railway In 1836, before construction of either line, the NUR had offered to extend its line northward from its intended terminus at Butler Street to Dock Street where it would acquire land for a joint station with the Lancaster company. Mutual running powers at Preston were to be included in the arrangement, and the L&PJR; was to reimburse the NUR‚Äôs expenses within a month of the outlays. The L&PJR; delayed agreeing as its own Act was not yet secured, but in March 1837 the NUR started building the extension, tunnelling under Fishergate, and then the L&PJR; committed to paying ¬£1,500 when it was completed.Reed, pages 81 and 82 The NUR completed the extension in December 1839 and ¬£1,500 was duly paid. When the L&PJR; opened seven months later, the NUR said the payment did not get the L&PJR; free use of the line to Butler Street, nor use of the station. This had been on offer, but not taken up, and did not form part of the agreement. Although this appears to have been L&PJR; error, it felt aggrieved and relations between the companies were harmed. As Greville and Holt put it, having paid its share in the making of the connecting line, the L&PJR; was certainly not going to pay tolls for using it. The L&PJR; had failed to agree an engine working policy until the last moment. The NUR offered to manage the locomotive fleet but the L&PJR; had to acquire its share of locomotives. At the last minute the L&PJR; agreed to the arrangement but failed to get the complement of locomotives ready in time. The NUR discovered that the L&PJR; track was of poor quality and considered that its locomotives were being damaged in running over it; there was evidently friction in day-to-day operation too. The NUR gave six months‚Äô notice in June 1841 to terminate the locomotive arrangement.Gregson, page 24 John Hargreaves who was working freight traffic on the L&PJR; line under contract, acquired the L&PJR; locomotive fleet and took over the locomotive working. Collaboration with the Bolton and Preston Railway The Bolton and Preston Railway built a line from Bolton to Chorley and Hargreaves was working the line. The NUR considered the B&PR; a hostile competitor and collaboration between the B&PR; and the L&PJR; exacerbated bad feeling from the NUR.Reed, page 83 The Bolton and Preston Railway had intended to build throughout to Preston which would have duplicated much of the NUR route and given it a shorter route from Preston to Manchester. In a change of plan, it now intended to make a junction with the NUR Euxton and reach Preston over the NUR. Its original intention to have a station at Preston remained, and in a further heightening of tension, the B&PR; agreed to build the station there for the use of the L&PJR.; The L&PJR; used its basic Dock Street station and some trains continued to Butler Street, the NUR Preston station. Passengers travelling through were charged a supplement of 6d, but some left the train at Dock Street and walked to Butler Street to rejoin the same train. The L&PJR; terminus at Dock Street was little more than a siding with buffer stops and a short, low timber platform. Access to Fishergate was by way of a cinder path and a flight of steps. The B&PR; station was ready early in 1842. It was adjacent to Maxwell House and sometimes known by that name. It was a terminus, accessed from the north, and could not be used for through trains. The NUR feared that B&PR; plans to duplicate the route from Euxton to Preston station might be revived. When the B&PR; made its connection at Euxton, it relied on running over the NUR to get to Preston, and the NUR exploited the opportunity to charge high tolls. The B&PR; was seriously weakened and was amalgamated with the NUR in 1843. Transfer to the Lancaster Canal Barton & Broughton Station in 1962 The L&PJR; was also weakened by the friction and its dependency on the hostile NUR. In 1842 it sought a purchaser, either the B&PR; which was in financial difficulties or the NUR, which declined. On 14 July 1842 the Lancaster Canal company agreed to take a 21-year lease of the L&PJR;, effective from 1 September 1842 which was ratified by Parliament on 3 April 1843. The lease charge was ¬£30,000 per annum.Reed, page 84Gregson, page 25 The detached B&PR; station at Maxwell House continued to be used by the Lancaster trains, but when the B&PR; was absorbed by the NUR in 1844, the station passed to the NUR who refused to use the station. The canal company had to negotiate a rent to use Butler Street station which was agreed from 13 February 1844. Lancaster and Carlisle Railway The Lancaster and Carlisle Railway was authorised on 6 June 1844,Grant, page 303 and the west coast main line was being created. The L&CR; directors had an interest in the proper management of the L&PJR.; In March 1844 a committee of the L&CR; recommended leasing the Canal Company, and through that the L&PJR;, but ambiguities in the lease of the L&PJR; were discovered frustrating the plan. Further attempts to regularise matters were also unsuccessful. From 22 September 1846 the L&CR; opened its line from Kendal to Lancaster, and its trains ran on to Preston without formal authorisation. The Lancaster station was a through station and the line by- passed the L&PJR; terminus. By this time the London and North Western Railway, formed by amalgamating several networks including the North Union Railway, had come into being and was friendly to the L&CR;, condoning the use of the Preston station. Meanwhile L&PJR; trains operated independently from the original Lancaster station to Preston Dock Street.Reed, pages 84 to 86 Management failings The management of the line was extremely sub-divided and ineffective, summarised by Captain Laffan of the Board of Trade: > In July, 1842, an agreement was made between the Directors of the L&PJR; and > the Lancaster Canal Company, by which the latter Company were to become > lessees of the Railway for 21 years. It was agreed that the whole of the > line, works, working stock, &c.;, were given up to the Canal Company on the > 1st September, 1842. Since that time the Canal Company have remained in > possession, and have continued to maintain and to work the line. As the > Railway Company, however, had no power in 1842 to grant a lease of their > line for a longer period than three years, and as the Canal Company had then > no power to take a lease of any Railway, one of the conditions of the > agreement was, that the two Companies should jointly apply for an Act to > confirm the agreement, and to give them what powers were necessary to enable > them to execute a formal lease. An Act was obtained in the following session > (July, 1843); but upon the formal lease being drawn up, in accordance with > the conditions of the agreement, the Railway Company refused to ratify it > unless certain additional conditions were introduced to which the Canal > Company refused to accede. > The Canal Company have retained possession of the line, and regularly > fulfilled the condition of their agreement, paying every year the stipulated > rent.

The > Canal Company, on the other hand, not content to remain in that position, > have applied to the Court of Chancery for an injunction to compel the > Railway Company to fulfil their original agreement, and grant a formal lease > in accordance with it.

The express had arrived at Preston late, and was sent forward after a stopping train. The time interval system of train controlIn the early days of railways, the time interval system was used to prevent rear end collisions. A second train was not allowed to leave a station until a certain period of time had elapsed since the previous train left. If the first train was delayed by engine failure or otherwise, the guard would go back down the track and exhibit a hand danger signal to any following train. The time interval was intended to give the guard time to do so. The system was very uncertain in operation and was (much later) superseded by the block system, in which a train may not enter a specified section of line (a \\"block\\") until it was known that the preceding train had left it. This required telegraphic communication between the stations. was in operation. The stopping train was carrying out station duties, when the express train approached at 40 mph. The sole means of warning the driver of the obstruction in the station was a red flag hoisted on a pole, but the flag was indistinct and not seen. The speed of the express was reduced when the driver saw the stopping train ahead, but a collision at 8 mph took place; one person was killed and several injured.Captain Laffan report Captain Laffan made a site inspection during the Board of Trade inquiry. He reported that he > found that the signals at the stations were of the rudest description, and > that though they might have sufficed for the traffic when this Railway was > only a small local line, they are utterly insufficient to provide for the > public safety now that it forms part of one of the great chains of railway > communication with the North. There is but one signal at each station, so > that it is impossible to tell to which line of rails it applies, and that > one signal consists simply of a small red flag hoisted to a staff. At some > of the stations an attempt is made to keep the flag square with the line by > fixing to it small cross sticks, but at others, and particularly at the Bay > Horse station, where the present collision occurred, there is simply a small > stick at top, and the flag not being held down in any way, blows about > freely, and can scarcely be perceived when the wind blows up or down the > line. On Monday, when I was at the Bay Horse station, it was a remarkably > fine bright day, and having directed the signal to be hoisted.

Had > another express train been coming round the neighbouring curve just then, > and another local train been standing in the station, it is probable that a > second disaster would have occurred. > The insufficiency of these signals was [previously] pointed out to the > Company by Captain Coddington, but his suggestions were not attended to. Acquisition by the Lancaster and Carlisle Railway The grievous scandal motivated a change of management, and yet progress was slow. At last, on 13 November 1848, agreement was reached for the L&CR; to take over the management of the Lancaster Canal including the L&PJR;, confirmed by Act of 1 August 1849.Reed, page 91 The outstanding toll payments for the L&CR; trains having run over the Lancaster-Preston line from 22 September 1846 to 31 July 1849, which had been retained but not handed over, amounted to ¬£83,616.Reed, page 93 The end of the L&PJR; as a legal entity came when an amalgamation act (with the L&CR;) was passed on 13 August 1859. L&PJR; shareholders received nearly ¬£102 of L&CR; ordinary stock for each ¬£100 of L&PJR.; With effect from 1 August 1859 the LNWR took a 900-year lease of the L&CR;, guaranteeing a minimum dividend of 8%; thus the L&PJR; system passed to the LNWR. Electrification The Preston to Carlisle section of the West Coast Main line was electrified on the 25kV overhead system; it was energised on 25 March 1974. A full electrically operated train service started on 6 May 1974. On 7 May HM the Queen travelled the route and 'drove' the train from Preston to Lancaster.J C Gillham, The Age of the Electric Train, Ian Allan Limited, Shepperton, 1988, , pages 169 and 170  Today  Today the line is the part of the West Coast Main Line. The North Union station at Preston is now Preston railway station. The L&PJR; Lancaster station has closed and none of the L&PJR; stations have survived.

Portman Jr.. Opened in 1985, it is located on Times Square at 1535 Broadway at the corner of 45th Street. History The hotel's construction was first disclosed on November 3, 1972, as a $75-million, 2,000-room project to be developed by Western International Hotels and architect/developer John Portman. The project was officially announced on July 11, 1973 by Mayor John Lindsay and Portman. Construction was set to begin in 1974, with the hotel set to open in 1977. The project was postponed after a fiscal crisis in 1975, before it was restarted under Mayor Ed Koch. Five historic theaters‚Äîthe original Helen Hayes, Morosco, Bijou, and the remnants of the Astor and Gaiety‚Äîneeded to be demolished to clear the site. Protesters, including actor Christopher Reeve and impresario Joseph Papp, tried to stop the destruction, even forcing a Supreme Court challenge. By the time construction began, years later, original operators Westin had dropped out due to the delay and Marriott built the hotel in a joint partnership with Portman's development company. The hotel opened on September 3, 1985. As a partial replacement for the demolished theaters, the Marquis Theatre was built as part of the approval for the building of the hotel. It is located within the hotel on the third floor. The Marriott was the first major project in the Times Square revitalization, and has been credited as the starting point for the regeneration of Times Square. The hotel is famous for its atrium lobby, rising 48 stories to \\"The View\\", New York's only rooftop revolving restaurant and lounge. The View is one of the highest restaurant in New York City behind others such as Manhatta on the 60th floor of 28 Liberty Street and the Rainbow Room on the 65th floor of 30 Rockefeller Plaza. With 1,966 rooms and over of meeting space, it is the second largest hotel in the city, surpassed only by the New York Hilton Midtown. The Marriott Marquis high-tech elevator system, supplied by Schindler, is famous in its own right for being one of the earliest installations of destination dispatch, which reduces travel time and improves efficiency by assigning passengers to elevator cars according to their destination floors.

He also designed the storage facilities in Constan»õa seaport, one of the earliest examples of reinforced concrete architecture in Europe. Biography Statue of Anghel Saligny made by Oscar Han, overlooking the port of Constan≈£a Saligny was born in »òerbƒÉne»ôti, Tecuci County (nowadays, Gala»õi County).About Anghel Saligny His father, Alfred Saligny, an educator of French descent, was an immigrant to Moldavia, coming from Prussia. He started his studies at the boarding school founded by his father in Foc»ôani, then went on to high school, initially also in Foc»ôani and then in Potsdam, Germany. He pursued engineering studies at the Royal Technical Higher School in Charlottenburg, and then contributed to the construction of railways in Saxony (Cottbus-Frankfurt an der Oder). He was a founding member of the Bucharest Polytechnic Society (the precursor of today's Politehnica University of Bucharest) and was even appointed Minister of Public Works. In 1892, he was elected a member of the Romanian Academy, and he served as its president between 1907 and 1910. Anghel Saligny's brother Alfons Oscar Saligny was a chemist and educator who was also elected a member of the Romanian Academy. Works Constan≈£a silos In all of his works (bridges, roads, silos, ports etc.), new elements are to be found. Some of them were considered great technological advances at the time. Saligny drew the plans for the Adjud‚ÄìT√¢rgu Ocna railway, which included the first mixed-use (railway and highway) bridges in Romania (1881‚Äì1882). He was also involved in the construction of numerous other metallic bridges, such as the one at Cosme»ôti over the Siret river, which measured 430 m in length. Between 1884 and 1889, Saligny planned and built the first silos in the world made of reinforced concrete, which are preserved today in Constan≈£a, BrƒÉila, and Gala»õi. In the port of Constan»õa, he designed a special pool to allow oil export and two silos for grain export. King Carol I bridge at its inauguration Saligny's most important work was the King Carol I Bridge over the Danube at CernavodƒÉ. Although a public offer had been held by the Romanian government for the erection of a bridge in that location, all projects were found to be subpar and subsequently rejected. Taking Saligny's previous experience into account, the Romanian government hired him and gave him the daunting (at the time) task to draw up the plans for the new structure. Construction work for the bridge started 26 November 1890, in the presence of King Carol I of Romania. The bridge has five openings, with four being 140 m wide, and the central one spanning 190 m. To allow ships to pass under the bridge, it was raised 30 m above the water. The endurance test was performed on the official opening day, when a convoy of locomotives drove on it at 85 km/h. The bridge at CernavodƒÉ measures 4,037 m in length, with 1,662 m over the Danube, and 920 m over the Borcea Arm. At the time, it was the longest bridge in Europe, and the second longest bridge in the world. The structure was famous for its era, competing with Gustave Eiffel's engineering works in France ‚Äî the Garabit viaduct and the Eiffel Tower in Paris.

The son of jazz drummer Roy Haynes,[ Allmusic] Graham is known for his work in nu jazz, fusing jazz with elements of hip hop and electronic music. Career With aspirations to push jazz beyond its traditional boundaries, Graham Haynes' first foray into electronic music came in 1979 upon meeting alto saxophonist Steve Coleman. Together, they formed a band called Five Elements, which launched an influential group of improvisers called M-Base Collective. After the formation of his own ensemble ‚Äì Graham Haynes and No Image ‚Äì and the subsequent release of an album (What Time It Be?), Haynes would spend the balance of the 1980s studying a wide range of African, Arabic and South Asian Music. After a move to France in 1990, Haynes incorporated these far-off influences into his next two releases ‚Äì Nocturne Parisian and Griot's Footsteps. Haynes returned to New York City in 1993 to take advantage of the flourishing Hip-Hop scene; and the resulting album was the sample heavy Transition. After the release of yet another hybridized album ‚Äì 1996's Tones For The 21st Century ‚Äì Haynes discovered drum 'n' bass and began working with some of the genres finest DJs and producers in London and the U.S. This manifested in the release of 2000s BPM, a fusion of drum n' bass beats with the classical music of Richard Wagner. Over the years, Haynes has kept busy with several critically acclaimed multimedia projects, composed the score for films Flag Wars and The Promise, and lectured at New York University, while receiving two nominations for the prestigious Alpert Award For The Arts. He has collaborated with artists such as Roy Haynes, Cassandra Wilson, Vernon Reid, Meshell Ndegeocello, The Roots, David Murray, George Adams, Ed Blackwell, Bill Laswell, Steve Williamson, and Bill Dixon.

It was founded in 1964 by Stuart Hall and Richard Hoggart, its first director. From 1964 to 2002, the Centre played a \\"critical\\" role in developing the field of cultural studies.  History  The Centre was the focus for what became known as the Birmingham School of Cultural Studies, or, more generally, 'British cultural studies'. After its first director, Richard Hoggart departed in 1968, the Centre was led by Stuart Hall (19691979). He was succeeded by Richard Johnson (19801987). The Birmingham CCCS approach to culture and politics evolved from a complex moment within British post-war history: the rise of the anti-Stalinist New Left; the promotion of adult education in Britain after World War II; the \\"Americanization\\" of British popular culture and the growth of mass communication in the decades after 1945; the growing multiculturalism of British society; and, the eventual influence within British academia of new critical methods like semiotics and structuralism. Drawing on a variety of influences (feminism, structuralism, Marxism especially the work of Louis Althusser and Antonio Gramsci, sociology, critical race theory, and post- structuralism), over the course of several decades the Centre pioneered a variety of approaches to the study of culture, including: ideological analysis; studies of working-class cultures and subcultures; the role of media audiences; feminist cultural research; hegemonic struggles in state politics; and the place of race in social and cultural processes. Notable Centre books include Off-Centre: Feminism and Cultural Studies, Resistance through Rituals, The Empire Strikes Back, Border Patrols: Policing the Boundaries of Heterosexuality. The history of this development can be found in the series of stencilled occasional papers the Centre published between 1973 and 1988. To mark the 50th anniversary of the CCCS's founding, the University of Birmingham‚Äîin collaboration with former members of staff at the Centre, including Richard Johnson, Stuart Hall and Michael Green‚Äîcreated an archive of CCCS-related material at the Cadbury Research Library at Birmingham.\\"The Birmingham Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies project\\", University of Birmingham.  Noted staff members  The Centre produced many key studies and developed the careers of prominent researchers and academics. Stuart Hall, who became the centre's director in 1968, developed his seminal Encoding/Decoding model of communication here. Of special importance is the collective research that led to Policing the Crisis (1978), a study of law and order campaigns that focused on \\"mugging\\" (a code for street violence). This anticipated many of the law and order themes of Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government in the 1980s. David Morley and Charlotte Brunsdon pioneered the Centre's approach to empirical research in The Nationwide Project . Richard Johnson was later director and encouraged research in social and cultural history. The centre staff included Maureen McNeil, noted theorist of culture and science, Michael Green who focused on media, cultural policy and regional cultures in the midlands, and Ann Gray, culture and media. Graduates and associates of the Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies and the Department of Cultural Studies include: * Paul Gilroy * Angela McRobbie * Dick Hebdige * Richard Dyer * Michael Denning * Lawrence Grossberg * Iain Chambers * Gregor McLennan * Lucy Bland * Frank Webster * Jorge Larra√≠n * Sadie Plant * Bill Schwarz * Dorothy Hobson * Hazel Carby * Paul Willis * Rosalind Brunt * Tony Jefferson  Closure in 2002  The new Department of Cultural Studies and Sociology was unexpectedly and abruptly closed in 2002, a move the university's senior management described as \\"restructuring\\". The immediate reason given for disestablishment of the new department was an unexpectedly low result in the UK's Research Assessment Exercise of 2001, though a dean from the university described the decision as a consequence of \\"inexperienced 'macho management'\\". Students and staff unsuccessfully campaigned to save the school, which gained considerable attention in the national press and sparked numerous letters of support from former alumni all over the world. Four of the department's 14 members of staff were to be \\"retained\\" and its hundreds of students (nearly 250 undergraduates and postgraduates at that time, many from abroad) to be transferred to other departments. In the ensuing dispute most department staff left.

It is used when a piper performs at high- profile or State occasions where the pipe banner will be tied to the bass drone of her or his bagpipes. It is a rather expensive handmade item embroidered with bullion threads. Although pipe banners are widely used by pipe bands of civilian, military and para-military origins around the world, they are most commonly used by bagpipe players in the United Kingdom and Commonwealth countries. For a civilian pipe band, its pipe banners would normally feature the crest or coat of arms of a Scottish clan to which the band is affiliated. For military or para-military pipe bands, their banners usually feature different combinations of the following: * The crest of the regiment or police force to which the band belongs * For bands in the British Army, a small Union flag at the corner of the pipe banner * Crests of predecessor regiments that form the present regiment to which the band now belongs * Battle honour crests, for instance, the crest of an elephant denotes a regiment's service at the Battle of Assaye in 1803 * The coat of arms of the town and/or city in which the regiment takes residence * Coats of Arms of cities and towns that have granted the regiment the Freedom of the City. That is, the regiment has the right to march in those cities with arms and bayonets fixed. Lieutenant Colobel Bud Walsh Presents Pipe banner to Pipe-Major Alan Clark of The Pipes and Drums of The Cameron Highlanders of Ottawa, October 2007. In addition, pipe bands of Scottish regiments in the British Army usually have designated pipers for each individual company in the regiments. In such case, there will also be company pipe banners that feature each infantry company's badge and these banners are only carried by the companies' pipers. Furthermore, a battalion's Commanding Officer may have his own piper as well, and in this case, there might also be a special pipe banner for this piper. In some regiments, it is customary for officers to donate pipe banners to their regiment's pipers at the time of their retirement. Pipe banners may also be presented to a pipe band at a special occasion.http://www.cuillinn.com/badges.html For instance, it is not uncommon that a sponsor or dignitary would present a special pipe banner to a regiment or police force on its centenary celebration. While pipe banners are not revered in the military as regimental or King's or Queen's colours, they are, however, considered to be important due to their historical values and their associations with authoritative establishments. Some regiments would even keep their pipe banners in their officers messes alongside their colours when the banners are not in use.

Overview Cut slopes are rarely created greater than a slope of two to one (horizontal to vertical dimensions). Cut sections of roadway or rail are characterized by the roadway being lower in elevation than the surrounding terrain. From an operational standpoint there are unique environmental effects associated with cut sections of roadway. For example, air pollutants can concentrate in the ‚Äò'valleys'‚Äò created by the cut section. Conversely, noise pollution is mitigated by cut sections since an effective blockage of line of sight sound propagation is created by the depressed roadway design.C.Michael Hogan, Analysis of highway noise, Journal of Water, Air, & Soil Pollution, Volume 2, Number 3, Biomedical and Life Sciences and Earth and Environmental Science Issue, Pages 387-392, September, 1973, Springer Verlag, Netherlands Fill section Fill sections manifest as elevated sections of a roadway or trackbed. Environmental effects of fill sections are typically favorable with respect to air pollution dispersal, but in respect to sound propagation, exposure of nearby residents is generally increased, since sound walls and other forms of sound path blockage are less effective in this geometry. There are a variety of reasons for creating fills, among them reduction of grade along a route or elevation of the route above water, swampy ground, or areas where snow drifts frequently collect. Fills can also be used to cover tree stumps, rocks, or unstable soil, in which case material with a higher bearing capacity is placed on top of the obstacle in order to carry the weight of the roadway or railway and reduce differential settlement.Herbert L. Nichols, Jr., and David A. Day, P.E., Moving the Earth: The Workbook of Excavation, 5th ed. (New York: McGraw-Hill, 2005), pp. 8.16 et seq. History The practice of cut-and-fill was widely utilized to construct tracks along rolling terrain across the British Isles. It was later performed for the construction of new dwellings for returning veterans in Ireland at the end of World War II. This application was developed by Irish railway engineer Lachlan J. Boland, who saw the benefits of introducing railway practices to residential construction.  Software  A number of software products are available for calculating cut and fill. A simple approach involves defining different earthworks features in a software program and then adjusting elevations manually to calculate the optimal cut and fill. More sophisticated software is able to automatically balance cut and fill and take account of materials. Software that can do this falls under the broad category of earthworks estimation software.

Later, in the United States, he was jailed together with his wife Myra on espionage charges. He was born in Vilkaviskis, Lithuania as Abromas Sobolevicius and sometimes used the name Abraham Sobolevicius or Adolph Senin. Biography=Early life Soble was born in 1903 as Abromas Sobolevicius, in then-Russian controlled Lithuania to a wealthy Jewish family. Soble travelled to Leipzig, Germany in 1921, to attend college, and where he joined the German Communist Party. In 1927, travelled to the Soviet Union, where he married and then returned to Germany. Soble studied briefly at the University of Berlin where he became a Trotskyist which led to his expulsion from the Communist Party and the university. Decades later, Soble would claim that he was coerced by Soviet agents to become a spy in 1931 after his wife returned to the USSR to visit her sick mother and threats to her safety were made if he did not cooperate. These claims are considered suspect as there is evidence that Soble had earlier contact with Stalin's agents. Soble, who now adopted the name Abraham Senin, became publicly known as a prominent member of the German Trotskyist circle, visiting Leon Trotsky himself on at least two occasions. However, suspicions were aroused about his activities and Trotsky booted Senin and his brother from the party. Soble returned to the USSR and began work for Profintern. In 1940, Soviet spymaster Lavrenty Beria dispatched the entire Soble family to the United States, by way of Japan and Canada. Soble later testified that Beria had told him that if he undertook the mission to spy on the United States, Beria would allow Soble's entire family to leave the Soviet Union. Soble arrived in 1941, and took over supervision of an NKVD spy ring known as the \\"Mocase\\", replacing Vasily Zarubin who under the pseudonym \\"Vasili Zubilin\\" became the head of the NKVD in the United States. Arrest The seeds of Soble's downfall came in 1947, when founding member of the ring, Boris Morros confessed to FBI agents that he had been working as a Soviet spy. Morros agreed to operate as a double agent, betraying Soble and the other members of the ring. Both Soble and his wife, Myra, were arrested in 1957. Morros also named Jane Foster Zlatovski, her husband George Zlatovski, Alfred Stern, Robert Soblen, and Jacob Albam as members of the espionage ring. After their arrest, the Sobles were interviewed numerous times, Jack at the Federal Correction Facility in Danbury, Connecticut and Myra at the Women's House of Detention, in New York City, where they provided some information. They were questioned about members of the Rosenberg spy ring, but they both denied knowing many of the members. The Sobles revealed that they had traveled to Russia, Lithuania, Germany, France, Switzerland, Austria, Japan, Canada, and the United States on behalf of Soviet intelligence. On a mission to gather intelligence on Stalin opponent Leon Trotsky, Soble visited Trotsky in Turkey in 1931 and in Copenhagen, Denmark, a year later. While awaiting trial, Soble attempted to commit suicide and government attorneys described him as a \\"psychopathic personality.\\" After a trial, both Soble and Myra Sobre, along with their associate Jacob Albam, were convicted on espionage charges and sentenced to prison. Myra Soble received a five-and-a-half year prison sentence for her role in the espionage ring. On October 8, 1957, Federal Judge Richard H. Levet, United States District Court, Southern District of New York, reduced her sentence to four years. Soble himself was sentenced to a seven- year sentence, which he began serving at Lewisburg Prison. In 1958, Soble intentionally swallowed more than a pound of nuts and bolts, in what was characterized as a suicide attempt but which Soble later claimed was a protest against prison conditions. In 1961, Soble testified against his brother, despite attempts by Robert's attorney to have Soble declared mentally incompetent. Robert Soblen committed suicide in 1962, and shortly thereafter, Soble was released early for good behavior. Following his release, Soble continued to testify for the government in other espionage trials.

He appeared in black-and-white vignettes with his \\"mother\\", the voluptuous Mrs. Cleavage, and the two would exchange sexual innuendos (e.g. Mrs. Cleavage would offer Beaver some of \\"Mother's milk\\" when he complained that his cereal was dry). The gimmick was quickly scrapped (via a 'worked shoot' promo in which Warrington supposedly gave up on the character), and retailored. On June 28, Warrington, now calling himself Chaz, ridiculed the Beaver Cleavage gimmick and identified Mrs. Cleavage as his girlfriend, Marianna Komlos, in a shoot- style interview. Warrington and Komlos feuded with Meat and his female entourage, then with Prince Albert. Warrington left Komlos on the September 9 episode of SmackDown!, and she begged him to take her back throughout the night. On the September 13 episode of Raw is War, Komlos came to ringside with a black eye, and it was implied that Warrington had beaten her. Over the following weeks, Warrington would be on the receiving end of beatdowns from various wrestlers as well as being screwed out of matches by officials, all of whom were angry at Warrington for allegedly beating Komlos. Komlos attempted to have police arrest Warrington, but he was saved by the intervention of Thrasher, who showed film that demonstrated that Komlos was lying. Komlos was arrested, and the Headbangers were reformed. =Headbangers reunion and Lo Down (1999‚Äì2001)= The Headbangers then took on a gimmick where they would dress as the opponents that they feuded with, such as the Dudley Boyz and the Mean Street Posse. They later turned heel, and began to dress in drag, most notably wearing breast cones. In June 2000, Warrington, once again known as Chaz, formed a new tag team with D'Lo Brown known as Lo Down. They enjoyed minor success, but were paired with Tiger Ali Singh and given the gimmicks of two bitter ethnic wrestlers who felt that they were being held down. They were given new ring attire, incorporating turbans and sashes, began using Tiger's entrance music, and were even given Arabic sounding names on one episode of Sunday Night Heat. The popularity of the team rapidly dwindled; at the 2001 Royal Rumble they were both denied a spot in the Rumble match, as their spot had been given to comedian Drew Carey. The team was eventually taken off TV, and Singh and Warrington were released. Chaz had his final WWF match on the July 30, 2001 edition of Raw is War in a dark match defeating the Inferno Kid. Independent circuit (2001‚Äìpresent) Mosh and Thrasher appeared on the Ring of Honor pay-per-view Best in the World on June 24, 2012 as the masked tag team Guardians of Truth, managed by Truth Martini. They lost to the Briscoe Brothers. Later on, the two would unmask themselves and go on to compete as the Head Bangers. Warrington now wrestles occasionally on the independent circuit in Florida. Warrington also plays outfield for the nationally ranked Fort Lauderdale professional kickball team \\"The Meatballs\\". In 2013, he joined Ring Warriors under the nickname That Simply Tremendous Dude. On October 14, 2013, he presented his Simply Tremendous Delegate Adam Barisano. The next week, Warrington turned heel, defeating Shooter Storm. Return to WWE (2016) On August 26, 2016, it was reported that Mosh and Thrasher would return to WWE, as part of the SmackDown brand.http://www.wrestlingnewsworld.com/headbangers-returning-wwe-dana-white- vince-mcmahon-working-together-wwe-star-kicked-off-airplane-big-ufc-star- bellator/ They lost their return match to Heath Slater and Rhyno on the August 30 episode of SmackDown. They also fought The Usos for a chance to compete at Survivor Series, but ended up losing. The Headbangers appeared on the November 15, 2016 900th episode edition of SmackDown Live teaming-up with other villainous teams.

It is the home of the Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball and women's basketball teams. It opened in 1971, replacing the current Gladstein Fieldhouse. The court is named after Branch McCracken, the men's basketball coach who led the school to its first two NCAA National Championships in 1940 and 1953. Basketball sportscaster Gus Johnson calls the Assembly Hall \\"the Carnegie Hall of college basketball.\\" History=Construction Indiana officials spent decades planning and four years of construction before The Assembly Hall was finally opened in 1971 at a cost of $26.6 million. The new \\"Assembly Hall\\" was named in honor of the school's first basketball arena of the same name. The facility was intended to be aesthetically pleasing and hold a large capacity while offering modern conveniences. The opening of the arena coincided with the debut of coach Bob Knight, who guided the Hoosiers for 29 seasons before his dismissal by then-IU president Myles Brand in September 2000. School officials were intent on having the majority of the seats on the sides in order to improve the viewing experience, with only a small number (20 rows of bleachers) behind the baskets. Thus, in order to fit over 17,000 seats in the arena the sides needed to be very steep. The facility also features two balconies, but they are so high up that sitting in them can feel quite far away from the court. The Assembly Hall has been criticized by some fans for its unique design. Because the facility was designed without consideration for the video replay board added in 2005 that currently hangs above center-court, some of the top rows of the lower level are obstructed from the replay board by the overhanging balcony. The entire court itself, however, is still viewable. In December 2013, 24 monitors were added to the areas that had previously been obstructed. Work was completed by Strauser Construction and Cassady Electric. In the fall of 2018, J.C. Ripberger Construction Corp completed the new Roberts Family Team Center which includes, the new Andy Mohr Locker Room, the Oladipo Zeller Legacy Lounge, the Tim Garl Athletic Training Room and the Basketball Coaches annex. Project was completed just prior to 2018 Hoosier Hysteria. Upgrades and improvements Assembly Hall score/replay board, added in 2005Indiana installed a new playing surface during the summer of 1995. New bleacher seats were also added, along with a media row and end seating platforms on Lobby Level. Upon his dismissal from Indiana, head coach Bob Knight predicted that with his departure advertisements would soon find their way into The Assembly Hall. Knight said, \\"You'll see a new Assembly Hall this year I'm sure. There will probably be ads in it for everything from dog biscuits to Pepsi Cola, I would imagine. We've always tried to keep it really free from commercialism. It's kind of a sacred place where students come to play and students come to cheer.\\" In 2005 the school completed construction of a state-of-the-art, $1.9 million scoreboard-video board. As with Knight, some Hoosier purists criticized the new scoreboard and advertisements, which had never before been in The Assembly Hall. In the spring of 2010 a new practice facility called Cook Hall was added adjacent to The Assembly Hall. The two facilities are connected to each other by a tunnel. Cook Hall is and features coaches' offices, locker rooms, player lounges, meeting/video rooms, new practice courts, training rooms, a strength development area, and a Legacy Court. 2015 renovation and renaming Assembly Hall in December 2015. On December 19, 2013, Indiana University announced that a $40 million donation from Cynthia \\"Cindy\\" Simon Skjodt, daughter of late shopping mall magnate and Indiana Pacers owner Mel Simon, would be used to renovate Assembly Hall. Indiana University renamed Assembly Hall the Simon Skjodt Assembly Hall upon the completion of the renovations and improvements, which were completed in October 2016. The south lobby was restructured with a new entryway and dramatic atrium. Escalators replaced ramps in the south lobby. Throughout the arena, new branding and graphics were updated to celebrate the tradition and success of IU basketball. Existing bathrooms and concession stands were remodeled and new bathrooms added. A large state-of-the-art video scoreboard replaced the current bifurcated scoreboard, improving fan experience for all fans in Assembly Hall, especially those sitting in the balcony. Box seat-style seating was added above the south baseline bleachers and will generate revenue to pay for this seating and to help fund ongoing upkeep of Assembly Hall. Behind the scenes, Assembly Hall's HVAC and other infrastructure systems were updated and a state-of-the-art broadcast technology center was added to enhance IU Athletics video production and game day broadcasts. Safety issue On February 18, 2014, an long beam over a foot wide fell and damaged the seats at Assembly Hall.https://vine.co/v/MZJAjqL76En The scheduled game for that day against the University of Iowa was postponed due to safety concerns. Atmosphere and success The Assembly Hall is well known as being one of the loudest venues in college basketball, aided both by passionate fans and its unique design of steep sides. A 2012 poll of four ESPN pundits ranked it third in terms of best home-court advantages in the country. Since opening for the 1971-72 season, over six million fans have attended men's basketball games at the venue. The men's team has been historically successful there, posting home winning streaks of 50 and 35 games. The Assembly Hall has been home to three national championships, 32 straight winning teams, and 12 conference champions. During the 2015-2016 basketball season, both the men's and women's teams went undefeated at Assembly Hall, posting a combined 33-0 record at home. Proposed replacement On June 22, 2007, Indiana University trustees approved the demolition of the Assembly Hall and the construction of a new basketball arena \\"when appropriate\\". Populous was hired to assess the benefits of renovating or replacing the Assembly Hall. The trustees decided against renovating the stadium for $115 million because construction of a new arena would cost $130 million. This idea was scrapped due to the University changing course and opting to renovate Assembly Hall.

It is the cost an advertiser pays for one thousand views or clicks of an advertisement. Radio, television, newspaper, magazine, out-of- home advertising, and online advertising can be purchased on the basis of exposing the ad to one thousand viewers or listeners. It is used in marketing as a benchmarking metric to calculate the relative cost of an advertising campaign or an ad message in a given medium.American Marketing Association Dictionary. . Retrieved 2012-11-28. The Marketing Accountability Standards Board (MASB) endorses this definition as part of its ongoing Common Language: Marketing Activities and Metrics Project .http://www.sempo.org. Glossary of Terms. Retrieved 2012-11-28. The \\"cost per thousand advertising impressions\\" metric (CPM) is calculated by dividing the cost of an advertising placement by the number of impressions (expressed in thousands) that it generates. CPM is useful for comparing the relative efficiency of various advertising opportunities or media and in evaluating the overall costs of advertising campaigns.Farris, Paul W.; Neil T. Bendle; Phillip E. Pfeifer; David J. Reibstein (2010). Marketing Metrics: The Definitive Guide to Measuring Marketing Performance. Upper Saddle River, New Jersey: Pearson Education, Inc. . The Marketing Accountability Standards Board (MASB) endorses the definitions, purposes, and constructs of classes of measures that appear in Marketing Metrics as part of its ongoing Common Language: Marketing Activities and Metrics Project . For media without countable views, CPM reflects the cost per 1000 estimated views of the ad. This traditional form of measuring advertising cost can also be used in tandem with performance based models such as percentage of sale, or cost per acquisition (CPA). Purpose The purpose of the CPM metric is to compare the costs of advertising campaigns within and across different media. A typical advertising campaign might try to reach potential consumers in multiple locations and through various media. The cost per thousand impressions (CPM) metric enables marketers to make cost comparisons between these media, both at the planning stage and during reviews of past campaigns. Marketers calculate CPM by dividing advertising campaign costs by the number of impressions (or opportunities-to-see) that are delivered by each part of the campaign. Thus, CPM is the cost of a media campaign, relative to its success in generating impressions to see. As the impression counts are generally sizeable, marketers customarily work with the CPM impressions. Dividing by 1,000 is an industry-standard. Similarly, revenue can be expressed in terms of Revenue per mille (RPM). Construction To calculate CPM, marketers first state the results of a media campaign (gross impressions). Second, they divide that result into the relevant media cost: :Advertising Cost ($) / Impressions Generated For example: #Total cost for running the ad is $15,000. #The total amount of impressions generated is 2,400,000. # ($15,000/2,400,000) = $0.00625 # CPM is calculated as: $0.00625 x 1000 (meaning per thousand impressions) = $6.25 Note: Notice how the CPM is $6.25 and not $0.00625, this is because we are looking at cost per thousand. * In online advertising, if a website sells banner ads for a $20 CPM, that means it costs $20 to show the banner on 1000 page views. * While the Super Bowl has the highest per-spot ad cost in the United States, it also has the most television viewers annually. Consequently, its CPM may be comparable to a less expensive spot aired during standard programming. Related metrics and concepts=Effective cost per mille The Search Engine Marketing Professionals Organization (SEMPO) defines eCPM as: :A hybrid Cost-per-Click (CPC) auction calculated by multiplying the CPC times the click-through rate (CTR), and multiplying that by one thousand. (Represented by: (CPC x CTR) x 1000 = eCPM.) This monetization model is used by Google to rank site-targeted CPM ads (in the Google content network) against keyword-targeted CPC ads (Google AdWords PPC) in their hybrid auction. In internet marketing, effective cost per mille is used to measure the effectiveness of a publisher's inventory being sold (by the publisher) via a CPA, CPC, or Cost per time basis. In other words, the eCPM tells the publisher what they would have received if they sold the advertising inventory on a CPM basis (instead of a CPA, CPC, or Cost per time). This information can be used to compare revenue across channels that may have widely varying traffic‚Äîby figuring the earnings per thousand impressions. Example * There are two banners: \\"Super Apps\\" and \\"Fantastic Apps\\". * The publishers earn $1 per click. * Both banners were published for the duration of one week. * \\"Super Apps\\" was viewed by 2000 visitors from which 10 clicked on it. * \\"Fantastic Apps\\" was viewed by 2000 visitors from which 50 clicked on it. This shows that: # \\"Super Apps\\" has an eCPM of $5 (= ($1 * 10/2000) * 1000) # \\"Fantastic Apps\\" has an eCPM of $25 (= ($1 * 50/2000) * 1000) Cost per point (CPP) or cost per rating point (CPR or CPRP) CPP is the cost of an advertising campaign, relative to the rating points delivered. In a manner similar to CPM, cost per point measures the cost per rating point for an advertising campaign by dividing the cost of the advertising by the rating points delivered. The American Marketing Association defines cost-per-rating point (CPR or CPRP) as: :A method of comparing the cost effectiveness of two or more alternative media vehicles in radio or television. CPRP is computed by dividing the cost of the time unit or commercial by the rating of the media vehicle during that time period.

The arena opened in 1989, and is named for Jack Breslin, MSU alumnus, former athlete and administrator, who first began pushing for the arena in 1969. It is home to the Michigan State Spartans men's and women's basketball teams. Although it nominally contains 16,280 seats, the arena typically holds around 10,000 for most events depending on the floor or stage setup. The Breslin Center superseded Jenison Fieldhouse, which stands approximately to the northeast, which had served since 1939. The arena's previous basketball court was the same floor where the Spartans won the 2000 NCAA Men's Tournament, which was at the RCA Dome in Indianapolis. The school purchased the floor from the NCAA and Final Four floor installer Horner Flooring (based in Dollar Bay) after the title game, and had a plaque installed on the baseline near the Michigan State tunnel to commemorate the floor's purpose in the school's history. They updated their court before the 2016-2017 season that has a two- toned finish inside the arcs and a large Spartan Head in the middle. The building not only serves as the home to MSU sports teams, but as the main large performance arena for the Lansing area. The Michigan State Bar Examination, large concerts, commencements, monster truck rallies, and circuses that travel to Mid Michigan are often held at the Breslin Center. With a large arena, it is Lansing's WWE venue. Many events for Michigan State are held here, including a plethora of career fairs and many Greek Life events. The arena underwent a $50 million renovation starting in January 2016 that went until October 2017. This renovation changed many things about the Breslin, but the most notable was the addition of the Tom Izzo Basketball Hall of History. This addition includes both men's and women's basketball trophies throughout the years, along with tributes to notable former players, previous jerseys, and even a wax figure of Tom Izzo. Another notable addition, donated by Draymond Green, was a new weight room for the players. Other things included in the renovation were a locker room for former players, a players' lounge, and a recruiting room. The concourse was also widened, and improvements were made to the restrooms and concession stands for the benefit of the fans. Quicken Loans founder, Dan Gilbert, donated $15 million to both the addition and a scholarship fund. They named the outside of the Hall of History the Gilbert Pavilion in his honor. Upgrades *1997 - A color replay board above center court was added, dubbed SpartanVision. *2001 - An expansion added two, auxiliary gyms and office space. *2005 - A large black drop curtain to close off the upper deck in efforts to make smaller events \\"less empty\\" was added. *2006 - The scrolling advertisements were replaced at the score's table with TV screens. *2007 - The home team locker rooms were renovated and the ceilings raised, as players on both the men's and women's teams were approaching 7'. *2010 - The basketball floor was repainted to adopt the new shade of green and the new appearance of MSU Athletics. *2011 - A larger, HD overhead scoreboard and LED rings around the lower concourse were added. *2012 - The basketball floor was repainted again with a larger logo at center court, replacement of MSU logos with a Big Ten logo at the free throw lines, and removal of brighter wood inside the three-point line. *2016 - The basketball floor was repainted again, keeping the large Spartan logo in the center of the court and adding a two-tone design with darker colored wood for the area inside the three-point line and a single random stripe outside the visitors' 3 point line on the right. *2017 - A $50 million renovation added the Tom Izzo Hall of History, a new weight room, a former players' locker room, a players' lounge, and a recruiting room; widened the concourse; and updated the restrooms and concession stands.

History Arena during a 2008 game versus Penn State Prior to playing in Carver-Hawkeye Arena, Iowa teams played in Close Hall (1902-1905) and then the first Iowa Armory (1905-1922). The first Armory was at the site of the current UI Communications Center building currently sits, across from the Library on the East Side of the Iowa River. Iowa teams moved to the second Iowa Armory (1922-1926), and then to the adjoining Iowa Field House (1926-1982), built directly beside the second Iowa Armory, which was incorporated into the new Field House facility.Hawkeye Legends, Lists, & Lore By Mike Finn, Chad Leistikow, http://www.iowalum.com/hardwood/ Iowa Basketball History In 1927, the Iowa Field House was opened during Paul Belding's tenure as athletic director. Considered as a \\"magnificent structure for its day\\", the Field House was home to Iowa's basketball and wrestling teams and included an indoor track and swimming pool. The Field House, however, was known for its steel balconies and sub-par acoustics, along with columns that obstructed views. When demand was high for Hawkeye basketball, bleachers were placed behind the baskets, allowing some 15,000 to attend games. Season ticket sales increased during the highly successful tenures of head coaches Ralph Miller and Lute Olson, and support for a new arena gradually increased. Following approval from Iowa Board of Regents, construction of Carver-Hawkeye Arena began. Entirely funded by private contributions, the arena was expected to be open for the 1982‚Äì83 school year, but weather slowed construction to the point where the first event was held on January 3, 1983. Iowa's wrestling team defeated Oklahoma and two days later, the men's basketball team played their first game ‚Äì a loss to Michigan State ‚Äì in the new arena. An NCAA attendance record for women's basketball was set on February 3, 1985. 22,157 were in attendance at Carver- Hawkeye arena as Iowa lost to rival Ohio State.https://www.upi.com/Archives/1985/02/03/An-NCAA-attendance-record-for- womens-basketball-was-set/1928476254800/ A logo commemorates the 25-year anniversary of Carver-Hawkeye Arena. Notable athletic events in the arena include the Big Ten and NCAA wrestling championships, the National Duals, the U.S. Olympic wrestling trials in 1984 and 2012, the UWW World Cup in 2018, and the NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Tournament. The arena also serves as the site of commencement exercises for several of the university's colleges, and has hosted concerts by artists such as U2, Whitney Houston, Stevie Nicks, *NSYNC, Metallica, Guns N' Roses, Old Dominion, and Red Hot Chili Peppers, and speeches by Former Presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton as well as Desmond Tutu and Jane Goodall. Carver-Hawkeye also hosted many events in place of Hancher Auditorium and Cedar Rapids' U.S. Cellular Center while both venues underwent renovations after the Iowa flood of 2008. On December 6, 2008, Iowa set the national collegiate wrestling dual meet attendance record as 15,955 fans packed the arena for Iowa-Iowa State match. The previous record of 15,646 was set Feb. 1, 2002, when Minnesota hosted Iowa at the Target Center in Minneapolis. Tom Brands, Brent Metcalf, and Tony Ramos are the only Hawkeye wrestlers to never lose a match during their college career in Carver-Hawkeye Arena. In 2016, a new scoreboard was added to the arena. It measures at high by wide. https://www.daktronics.com/news/Pages/University-of-Iowa-Turns-to- Daktronics.aspx On the 7th-8th April 2018 Carver‚ÄìHawkeye Arena took senior freestyle wrestling international tournament World Cup 2018.

Smith Student Activities Center (commonly known as the Dean Smith Center, Smith Center, or the Dean Dome) is a multi-purpose arena in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, used primarily as the home for the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Tar Heels men's basketball team. The university began to inquire about building a standalone arena for the men's basketball team beginning in the mid-1970s, but due to an ongoing university wide investigation, the fundraiser halted until its conclusion. On June 1980, the fundraising began with a goal of at least $30 million and a target completion date for the building of December 1984. It was initially planned to be called the Student Activities Center; however, after its announcement it began to be referred to as The Dean Dome and it was speculated it would be named for then coach Dean Smith. The fundraising concluded in August 1984 with over $33 million raised, but construction would not finished until 1986. The day before the opening game on January 18, 1986, against the Duke Blue Devils, the building was officially announced to be named the Dean E. Smith Student Activities Center, while a formal dedication happen later in September. In 2018, the hardwood floor of the Smith Center was named for then coach Roy Williams. Land was cleared in a wooded ravine on the southern part of campus and necessitated of rock to be dynamited out. The building is and build on and contains three levels. There are two levels for seating, an upper and lower level, from which the furthest viewing distance is . The Dean Dome has been renovated several times since its opening which has included the likes of new video boards, video ribbon along the upper level edge, seats, lighting, and sound. In addition, the locker rooms and office space have all been upgraded. Throughout the years the capacity has been adjusted through the removal of box seating for traditional seating and the addition of a standing student section behind one of the goals. The future of the arena is questioned due to a variety of issues stemming from a narrow concourse, limited storage, and a desire to have premium seating to earn more revenue. The issue is further complicated by the fact the Smith Center was privately funded and the seats paid for by the initial donors carry two full generations, which limits any possible renovation, but could be circumvented by building a new arena. Through the 2018‚Äì19 season, the Tar Heels have played 33 seasons in the Dean Smith Center and have earned over 400 victories and under 100 losses. Despite their home success, the crowd has often been criticized for being dull and un‚Äìinvolved, which has been credited to the seating arrangement created by the above‚Äìmentioned donors which has limited the ability of the students to use the lower level and create noise. In addition to basketball, the venue has been used to host several concerts, graduations, sporting events, and a speech by Barack Obama when campaigning for the Democratic Presidential nomination. Background and history alt=The inside of an arena. After the Tar Heels won the national championship in 1957, there were thoughts of building a big venue for the Tar Heels to play basketball in. However, Carmichael Auditorium was built onto Woollen Gymnasium and the Tar Heels began to play there in 1965-66 season. During the mid-1970s, the university began to investigate building a self-standing arena. However, the university was in the middle of a fundraising campaign called the Carolina Challenge and Chancellor Ferebee Taylor and the board of trustees did not want a campaign to build a venue to compete with the school campaign. When the Carolina Challenge ended in 1979, work on the new arena began again when a 25-member committee was created to head the project. The building was designed to be used for the men's basketball team, graduations, concerts, and exhibits. Smith stated publicly \\"We all know that we can use that money better to help the University,\\" while later in his memoir he also noted that \\"when you can‚Äôt get a ticket, that‚Äôs the best situation for a program.\\" Smith later agreed for the new building as it would allow more students to attend. According to architect Glenn Corley, assistant coach Bill Guthridge hoped the new arena would be \\"big enough so that everyone who wanted to go to a game could get in, and there wouldn't be one guy outside waiting.\\" Future ACC Commissioner John Swofford, Hargove \\"Skipper\\" Bowles, and executive Rams Club director Ernie Williamson anchored the fundraising efforts which officially started in May 1980 for a goal of at least $30 million. Bowles convinced Smith to assist the fundraising, as there were fears it would not succeed without his participation. They hosted many Rams Club and alumni meetings around the state, where they presented a model of the building while Smith and Bowles spoke to the attendees. Swofford stated during the campaign: \\"The key factor, of course, was the job that Dean has done with basketball here and the respect people hold for his program.\\" A proposition was made to the student body for a fee increase to be applied to help cover building costs and that increase would maintain the seating arrangements as they were in Carmichael, but it was voted down. Following the Tar Heels' victory in the 1982 NCAA championship game, donations increased, which Rams Club vice president Neal Harrell stated \\"couldn‚Äôt have come at a better time...\\" On April 17, 1982, after half the desired amount had been raised, ground was broken for the venue, with a target finish date of December 1984. On the first day of construction, contractors were banned from wearing Duke or N.C. State apparel on the job site for the duration of the build. Donations again increased significantly in 1984 when exact seating was being determined. Harrell stated that any donations over $5,000 secured the life- long right to purchase seats at the venue, while a gift over $10,000 would grant tickets for two generations. Lifetime tickets for two generations meant guaranteed tickets for the lifetime of the donor and their oldest child's. As donations increased the quality and quantity of seats improved and parking spots would be included. The effort spanned six years and included 2,362 donors. Donations ranged from $1 to $1 million. Each donor's name is located on a brass and granite plaque in 3/8-inch letters near the venue's north, main entrance. The campaign ended on August 1, 1984 and the total amount donated was over $33 million. The completion date was pushed back further to March 1985 and again until the season opener in 1985 against UCLA. Upon completion of the campaign, this became the first privately funded on-campus venue for basketball. Prior to the first game, the Student Activities center began to be referred to as the \\"Dean Dome,\\" which is a play on Coach Smith and the fiber- glass dome on the arena. Regarding the venue's nickname, Smith one time remarked that \\"It makes me sound bald.\\" A black-tie dinner was held in the building on January 17, 1986 to honor the University's Arts and Sciences Foundation. At the dinner, Chancellor Christopher C. Fordham III announced the building was to be named the Dean E. Smith Student Activities Center because \\"We are a better university and a better state because he is one of us.\\" The opening game on January 18, 1986 featured the No. 1 North Carolina Tar Heels against rival and No. 3 overall Duke Blue Devils on national television. Before the game, there was a ceremonial jump ball between the two teams to open the building. The first basket was scored by Duke's Mark Alarie, while the first Tar Heel who scored was Warren Martin off a dunk. During the a timeout in the game, a banner was unfurled that read ‚ÄúDean‚Äôs Dome ‚Äì The Tradition Continues.‚Äù The Tar Heels won the game 95‚Äì92. A formal dedication of the arena for Coach Smith happened on September 6, 1986 when a pro-alumni game was held which featured the likes of Lennie Rosenbluth, Michael Jordan, James Worthy, and many more alumni of the basketball program. Due to renovations going on at their home venue, Carmichael, the women's basketball team played their home games for the 2008‚Äì09 and 2009‚Äì10 seasons at the Dean Smith Center. The hardwood floor of the Dean Smith Center was named for head coach Roy Williams on August 24, 2018, thus becoming the Roy Williams Court. Williams on the honor stated \\"It's very hard to believe; it's just so flattering,\\" and wanted to thank his former and current players \\"because they made the plays.\\" The dedication happened during a reunion of the basketball team. North Carolina hosts Florida State in an ACC Men's Basketball conference game on February 23, 2019. Architecture and renovations The land for the Smith Center is located on south campus in a wooded ravine near US 15-501 and Mason Farm Road. To make room for the structure, more than of rock needed to be dynamited out, along with of dirt. However, this was not completed due to the excessive blasting required for the west side, leading to a semi-circular shape of the ground floor. This led to storage and production issues almost immediately. The entire arena is 380' long by 340' wide and 140' high, with three levels. In total, the arena is spread across of land. The roof is and is skylighted. The farthest view from seat to court is . The court itself is maplewood and seven inches thick. The venue included 20 boxes near the top of the lower level for the larger donors; however, the large donors to the stadium wished for court-side seating. Due to poor views from the boxes, these areas were converted into normal seating years later. The venue's 68 rows all feed into the 1,200' long and 22' wide concourse that features several concession stands and vendors. Hanging over the court is a grid that allows for sound and lighting equipment to be hung. The architects for the project were Chapel Hill's Joe Hakan and Glenn Corley from Hakan/Corley & Associates, Finch-Heery of Atlanta, and New York City's Geiger Berger. Since the arena's opening, it has been renovated and updated several times. In 2005, the Dean Dome received four 17.8' x 23.6' high-resolution video boards, along with video ribbon boards along the edge of the upper level and along the scorer's table. Advertising was first allowed starting in later 2005 when the university reached an eight deal with Wachovia Bank. The signage would be placed with the large video boards in arena's corners, along with other sports venues that the campus had. Then athletic director Dick Baddour commented that the sponsorship was allowed in order to help finance upgrades and repairs to the Smith Center. Over the next three years all the seats and the hardwood floor were replaced. Since then the lights, sound system, and the ribbon have been further replaced. In addition, the locker rooms and \\"behind the scenes\\" area were renovated prior to the 2016‚Äì17 season. The university announced in February 2018 the arena would receive four new video boards, replacing ones that were in place since 2005, for a cost of roughly $6 million which also included new ribbon video board along the upper level. Athletic director Bubba Cunningham commented that the four separate video boards were chosen rather than a central, hanging video board, in part, because it would ruin the \\"open feel\\" as well as obscure the view of the rafter's banners that display retired and honored jerseys, national championships, and other accomplishments. The new boards were installed in October 2018 and measure 19' x 100'. The initial capacity for the Dean Smith Center was 21,444, which made it the third largest on-campus arena for the 1985-86 college basketball season. It is presently the third-largest arena in both the nation and in the ACC (behind only Syracuse's Carrier Dome and Louisville's KFC Yum! Center, and the second-largest designed primarily for basketball (the Carrier Dome was built to host football and basketball). In the 1990s, the seating was expanded to increase capacity to 21,572. Before the start of the Tar Heels' 2000‚Äì01 season, a standing room only section for students was added behind the basket the visiting team opposes in the first half. This increased the capacity of the arena to 21,750. The largest crowd to attend a game in the facility was 23,713 when the Smith Center hosted the 1987 U.S. Olympic Festival basketball game. The largest crowd to see a Carolina game in the Dean Dome was on March 6, 2005, when 22,125 fans saw the North Carolina Tar Heels beat the Duke Blue Devils 75-73 following a nine-point comeback in the final three minutes of regulation. Future The arena was considered state-of-the-art in 1986; however, despite frequent renovations and updates, there are many issues with the building regarding its large number of seats, limited storage due to the lack of rock dynamited out in the west end, and its narrow concourse. In November 2015, Cunningham told the media that the school had been looking at renovating the Smith Center to add premium level seating and reducing the overall capacity by potentially 4,000 seats or building a replacement structure. This project would also be privately financed through donations and athletic department revenue, but not with state taxes. If the school were to renovate the Smith Center, it would continue the lifetime season ticket obligations for patrons or the second generation of the patrons that donated to the Smith Center's initial funding. A potential replacement arena would have to be built on a new site and would require a lot more money; however, it would allow for luxury seating to increase revenue and would eliminate the lifetime seating rights. Should those holding the lifetime season tickets wish to keep their rights, they would then be required to make a significant donation, rather than a minimal donation as they do currently to maintain the tickets. A new arena would greatly increase revenue through yearly seat licensing, and therefore help all athletic programs through the increase in revenue that would then increase the total athletic budget. Basketball atmosphere The Dean Dome's crowd has been criticized for being lackluster in the past. As early as 1987, a writer for The Daily Tar Heel stated the Smith Center and the university's on-campus football stadium, Kenan Memorial Stadium \\"usually [resembled] tombs more than athletic arenas.\\" A year later, another Daily Tar Heel writer attended a high school basketball game in the Smith Center and noted that with only 80% of the lower level filled, the fans in attendance made more noise than the Carolina fans made in their home game against NC State that season. Following a victory by Florida State, Seminole Sam Cassell was quoted as calling the fans in attendance \\"like a cheese and wine crowd.\\" Years following the game, Cassell elaborated on his comments stating that the older alumni‚Äìwho primarily sat close to the court‚Äìweren't loud and stated that the students then sitting in the upper levels were making noise, but their effect was limited as they were higher up. Since Cassell made the comments, the words have commonly been incorrectly remembered and people tend to refer to the Smith Center crowd as a \\"wine and cheese\\" crowd. In contrast, Carmichael Auditorium was known for its noise level; before one game, the Virginia Cavaliers couldn't hear their names announced during player introductions because of the din. Carolina fans walking to the Smith Center along Skipper Bowles Drive in January 2012. Typically the issue with crowd noise and involvement stems from the seating above mentioned seating arrangement issues where the lower level seats are predominately taken up by alumni that donated to help build the arena. The student sections in the lower level often vary depending on the year, but are mainly located in the upper level, far from the court. Following the introduction of the student risers behind one basket in 2000, the crowd was louder, but due to the lack of students behind the other basket, the effect is limiting. In 2004, after the then top-ranked Connecticut Huskies were defeated by Carolina at the Dean Dome, then Huskies coach Jim Calhoun said, \\"I hear about the wine and cheese crowd and I don't know where the hell they are but they were not here today.\\" After the Tar Heels defeated then top-ranked Ohio State in 2006, Buckeyes coach Thad Matta stated, \\"I think I've never been in a building that was as loud as that building was at times.\\" However, the crowd still is known to be quiet and following a road loss to the Indiana Hoosiers in 2016, then coach Williams stated \\"Gosh. I‚Äôd like to play in front of a crowd like that in the Smith Center every night other than the frickin‚Äô Duke game.\\" Tar Heels hosted the Pittsburgh Panthers in the Smith Center's first \\"Stripe Out\\". The Tar Heels won the game 75‚Äì71.alt=A stadium filled with people. Home‚Äìcourt advantage The Dean Dome has become known for the home‚Äìcourt advantage the Tar Heels possess. Through the 2018‚Äì19 season's completion, Carolina teams have played 33 seasons in the arena. Across those seasons, the Tar Heels have played 476 games where they amassed 405 wins against 71 losses, for a win percentage of 85.1%. In 5 of the 33 seasons, the team has gone undefeated in all contests at the Smith Center. While the team has only lost more than three games in a single season at the Smith Center 6 times. Their only season with a losing record was 2001‚Äì02 when the Tar Heels went 6‚Äì9. Other uses The first concert to be hosted in the Smith Center was Kenny Rogers on April 12, 1986. Performance Magazine named the Dean E. Smith Center as the \\"Venue-of- the-year\\" in 1987. In addition, Pollstar Readers named it the \\"Best New Major Concert Venue.\\" The Smith Center hosted many concerts between its opening and 1995, hosting the likes of Pink Floyd, Garth Brooks, Bon Jovi, Guns & Roses, INXS, R.E.M., Bruce Springsteen, Grateful Dead, and more. Concerts dwindled following 1995, after which they were mainly Sesame Street Live. One of the reasons the Smith Center stopped hosting concerts was due to the inability to keep up with the musician's production demands like Metallica wanted to perform in the Dean Dome but due to fears of their hydraulic lift ruining the floor. The Smith Center's last concert was in 2008, when Boys II Men performed. The facility is used each year for various local high schools' graduations, as well as the December commencement and various May Commencement exercises. Throughout the year blood drives and career fairs are held in the building. The 1988 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament used the Smith Center as the host for the East region's opening two rounds. The Smith Center and adjacent Koury Natatorium served as the host for various 1999 Special Olympics World Summer Games events. On April 28, 2008, Senator and Democratic presidential candidate hopeful Barack Obama held a rally in the arena before the North Carolina primary on May 6. Obama spoke in front of 18,000 wearing a Carolina blue tie while encouraging those to vote early and addressed topics like affordable college and the war in Darfur.

It was published the same year as the Redwall book (his more known fantasy series) Rakkety Tam. There are six tales in this book, all of them like the tales in Seven Strange and Ghostly Tales, by the same author. The titles are: \\"The Ribbajack\\", \\"A Smile and a Wave\\", \\"The All Ireland Champion Versus the Nye Add\\", \\"The Mystery of Huma D'Este\\", \\"Miggy Mags and the Malabar Sailor\\", and \\"Rosie's Pet.\\" The \\"Ribba Jack\\" is also an ancient term for a physical appearance of ones worst fear. The Ribbajack (in the story) is a grotesque animal that is summoned by a person's anger to kill another. Individual story plotlines=The Ribbajack Archibald Smifft, who lives at a boarding school, torments anyone he can find with insults and the like. The matron and headmaster discover his practices of dark magic, and decide that something must be done. One day, when an old army veteran comes to lecture him about his horrible behavior, he is extremely displeased and searches for something to take revenge. Just then, the two boys that share his dormitory come in and one accidentally lets slip that he possesses a letter containing information on the Ribbajack. Archibald snatches the letter at once and attempts to conjure his own Ribbajack to destroy the man who lectured him - and succeeds. Fortunately for the monster's intended victim, the medal that he is wearing at the time, gifted to him by an Indian fakir, is enchanted to drive away Ribbajacks and turn them on their creators - thus, Archibald Smifft is gone from the boarding school forever. A Smile and a Wave Maggie would like to go to the ice-skating rink, but she must bring her coat with her if she is to go. The only problem is that she deliberately left the coat at school because of her dislike of it. Her mother orders her to go back to the school to retrieve the coat, despite Maggie's protests that the school is locked at night. Reluctantly, Maggie revisits the school and finds her coat but comes upon a ghost of a girl holding a rose. The girl's face frightens Maggie enough to put on her coat and flee the school. Later, a school official finds some information in a book concerning the name of the school, the Leah Edwina Tranter School. Leah was a lonely girl with wealthy parents who did not spend much time with her. When she was fourteen years old, she disappeared and later turned up dead concealed behind a bookcase and holding a rose in one hand. Her father was devastated and sank into depression. His wife left him. Much later, he wrote in his will that a school was to be built on the site of his home, and that it was to be named the Leah Edwina Tranter School. The All Ireland Champion Versus the Nye Add Roddy Mooney is extremely good at fishing; thus, he is the All Ireland Champion Fisherman, but he is lazy and does not help his mother to take care of the house and themselves (he lives with his mother). One day, he crosses paths with young Mickey Hennessy, who declares that he intends to catch a Nye Add. Roddy finds out about Nye Adds from Mickey; they are mermaids. Roddy pretends that he does not believe Mickey, but goes home to get his fishing supplies and catch the Nye Add that Mickey claims he saw earlier (although Roddy believes it is a huge fish because he and Mickey saw the Nye Add's tail). Roddy hooks something large and attempts to reel it in, but the thing on the other end of the line pulls back and Roddy falls into the water - it's a Nye Add! Soon after, the Nye Add's mother shoves Roddy back up to the surface and scolds her daughter severely. Roddy is never the same again after his encounter with the Nye Add. The narrator reveals that Mickey goes down to the riverbank every midsummer night and that the Nye Add returns to the surface at the same time to look for Roddy. Mickey has learned her language and that she is a Kelpie, not a Nye Add. Finally, it's revealed that the story is being narrated by Mickey himself. The Mystery of Huma D'Este Jason Hunter is an extremely handsome boy, a great sprinter...and a bully. When he finds out about a new student coming to the school, he attempts to make her his next target but he cannot do it, for some reason. Later, he finds out her name is Huma D'Este and attempts to use it to make fun of her, but she retaliates by making fun of his name and drawing a rude picture on the blackboard. Much later, one morning Jason is drawn by a mysterious voice to a Greek temple where Huma D'Este is waiting for him. She shows him eleven marble statues and he deduces that one is missing. After trying to get him to tell her who was the captain of the Argo in Greek mythology, she tells him that he was called Jason and that he was the final piece of her collection. Jason finds out that \\"Huma D'Este\\" is an anagram of \\"The Medusa\\"! She turns him to marble. Myriad years later, two of Jason's classmates, Carlene and Mal Blake, have married and have children and grandchildren. The two go on a cruise and Carlene tours an exhibit of marble statues. She notices that one of the statues looks suspiciously like her classmate Jason Hunter.  Reception  Kirkus Reviews praised the book for its \\"sly humor and suspenseful plotting\\".

It is home to four Northwestern Wildcats athletic teams: men's basketball, women's basketball, women's volleyball, and wrestling. It is located inside McGaw Memorial Hall, to the north of Ryan Field. The building opened in 1952 as a replacement for Patten Gymnasium, and was the site of the Final Four for the 1956 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament. It was extensively renovated in 1983, at which time the main arena was renamed Welsh‚ÄìRyan Arena. At the conclusion of the 2016‚Äì17 basketball season, the arena was renovated and upgraded as part of a $110 million project completed in late 2018. The renovation displaced the athletic programs that use the arena for the 2017‚Äì18 season. For years, Welsh‚ÄìRyan Arena was the smallest arena in the Big Ten Conference and the only conference facility that did not seat at least 10,000. With Rutgers University joining the conference in 2014, Welsh‚ÄìRyan became the second-smallest arena after the Louis Brown Athletic Center at Rutgers, which has a listed capacity of 8,000. Welsh‚ÄìRyan once again became the smallest arena in the Big Ten Conference in 2018, with the listed capacity decreasing to 7,039 after renovations. History McGaw Memorial Hall was built through the generosity of Northwestern University trustee and donor Foster G. McGaw, founder of the American Hospital Supply Corporation. The building, named in memory of McGaw's father, Presbyterian minister and missionary Francis A. McGaw, to house sporting events and large-scale meetings. With a seating capacity of about 13,000, McGaw Memorial Hall was one of the three largest auditoriums in the Chicago area at the time of its construction. Designed by the architectural firm of Holabird & Root & Burgee and built of reinforced concrete, McGaw Memorial Hall contained of interior space. The lighting system, consisting of 180 mercury vapor lights, was said to simulate \\"pure daylight.\\" Partitions, portable bleachers, and a removable basketball floor made the building suitable for a wide variety of uses. While the intent was to provide a space large enough to hold the entire student body of Northwestern University at once during convocations and other such campus occasions, the auditorium was also used by the North Shore Music Festival and, soon after its opening, by the Second Assembly of the World Council of Churches. This event, held August 15‚Äì30, 1954, featured a convocation address by U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower. In 1983 Northwestern completed extensive renovations on the interior of the McGaw Hall. The main arena was renamed Welsh‚ÄìRyan Arena in honor of the project's principal donor, insurance magnate Patrick G. Ryan, president of the Board of Trustees, and of his wife's parents, Mr. and Mrs. Robert J. Welsh, Sr. The lobby was renamed Ronald J. Chinnock Lobby after real estate tycoon Ronald Chinnock. The McGaw Fieldhouse is a practice facility within the building, which in 1997 was renovated to allow practice space for basketball and volleyball. In 2007, the Brown Family Basketball Center was constructed within the McGaw Fieldhouse to include new locker rooms and team lounges for the men's and women's basketball teams, as well as offices for their respective coaching staffs. In 2016, Northwestern announced plans for a $110 million arena renovation, shuttering the facility for the 2017‚Äì18 season. During that time, the Wildcat men's basketball and wrestling teams played at Allstate Arena in Rosemont, with the women's basketball team playing out of Evanston Township High School's Beardsley Gym that season. Capacity was reduced to 7,039 by replacing the bleachers with chairback seats. The renovated facility also has wider concourses, balconies behind the baskets, and suites. Before then, one of the few significant changes since the 1983 renovation had been the replacement of the arena's 1980s-vintage scoreboards with a modern video board.

In computer graphics, back-face culling determines whether a polygon of a graphical object is visible. It is a step in the graphical pipeline that tests whether the points in the polygon appear in clockwise or counter-clockwise order when projected onto the screen. If the user has specified that front-facing polygons have a clockwise winding, but the polygon projected on the screen has a counter-clockwise winding then it has been rotated to face away from the camera and will not be drawn. The process makes rendering objects quicker and more efficient by reducing the number of polygons for the program to draw. For example, in a city street scene, there is generally no need to draw the polygons on the sides of the buildings facing away from the camera; they are completely occluded by the sides facing the camera. In general back-face culling can be assumed to produce no visible artifact in a rendered scene if it contains only closed and opaque geometry. In scenes containing transparent polygons, rear facing polygons may become visible through the process of alpha composition. In wire-frame rendering, back-face culling can be used to partially address problem of hidden line removal, but only for closed convex geometry. A related technique is clipping, which determines whether polygons are within the camera's field of view at all. Another similar technique is Z-culling, also known as occlusion culling, which attempts to skip the drawing of polygons which are covered from the viewpoint by other visible polygons.  Implementation  One method of implementing back-face culling is by discarding all triangles where the dot product of their surface normal and the camera-to-triangle vector is greater than or equal to zero : \\\\left( V_{0} - P\\\\right) \\\\cdot N \\\\ge 0 where is the view point, is the first vertex of a triangle and is its normal, defined as a cross product of two vectors representing sides of the triangle adjacent to : N = \\\\left( V_{1} - V_{0}\\\\right) \\\\times \\\\left( V_{2} - V_{0}\\\\right) Since cross product is non-commutative, defining the normal in terms of cross product allows to specify normal direction relative to triangle surface using vertex order(winding): :\\\\left( V_{1} - V_{0}\\\\right) \\\\times \\\\left( V_{2} - V_{0}\\\\right) = - \\\\left( V_{2} - V_{0}\\\\right) \\\\times \\\\left( V_{1} - V_{0}\\\\right) If points are already in view space, can be assumed to be , the origin. : -V_{0} \\\\cdot N \\\\ge 0 It is also possible to use this method in projection space by representing above inequality as determinant of a matrix and applying projection matrix to it.David H. Eberly (2006). 3D Game Engine Design: A Practical Approach to Real-Time Computer Graphics, p. 69. Morgan Kaufmann Publishers, United States. . Another method exists based on reflection parity, which is more appropriate for two dimensions where surface normal cannot be computed (also known as CCW check). Let a unit triangle in two dimensions (homogeneous coordinates) be defined as :U_{0} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\end{bmatrix}, U_{1} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\end{bmatrix}, U_{2} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\end{bmatrix} Then for some other triangle, also in two dimensions, :V_{0} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} x_{0} \\\\ y_{0} \\\\ 1 \\\\end{bmatrix}, V_{1} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} x_{1} \\\\ y_{1} \\\\ 1 \\\\end{bmatrix}, V_{2} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} x_{2} \\\\ y_{2} \\\\ 1 \\\\end{bmatrix} define a matrix that transforms the unit triangle into it :M = \\\\begin{bmatrix} x_{ 1 }-x_{ 0 } & x_{ 2 }-x_{ 0 } & x_{ 0 } \\\\ y_{ 1 }-y_{ 0 } & y_{ 2 }-y_{ 0 } & y_{ 0 } \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\end{bmatrix} so that :MU_{0}=V_{0} :MU_{1}=V_{1} :MU_{2}=V_{2} Discard the triangle if matrix contained odd number of reflections (facing the opposite way of unit triangle) :\\\\left M \\\\right < 0 Unit triangle is used as a reference and transformation is used as a trace to tell if vertex order is different between two triangles. The only way vertex order can change in two dimensions is by reflection. Reflection is an example of involutory function (with respect to vertex order), even number of reflections will leave triangle facing the same side, as if no reflections were applied at all. An odd number of reflections will leave triangle facing the other side, as if exactly after one reflection. Transformations containing an odd number of reflections always have negative scaling factor, likewise scaling factor is positive if there are no reflections or even number of them. Scaling factor of a transformation is computed by determinant of its matrix.

The nonsense rat was first described in 1902 by Miller, who placed it in the genus Mus. Today it is classified in the genus Rattus. The origin of the name \\"nonsense rat\\" is uncertain, as Miller did not provide a common name in his original description, but more recent sources, such as the IUCN, include it. Habitat and distribution The nonsense rat is endemic to the Nicobar Islands, where it is confined to isolated populations on the islands of Great Nicobar, Little Nicobar and Trinket. It inhabits tropical evergreen and semi- evergreen forests. Conservation The species is currently classified as endangered by the IUCN. While little is known of its current abundance and distribution on the islands, it is likely that it suffers from habitat loss through conversion of forests to palm plantations, and general expansion of human settlements. The December 2004 tsunami is considered to have had a strong negative impact on populations.

He served as the Chair of the Department of Biochemistry at McGill University from 1928‚Äì1941 and Dean of Medicine at the University of Western Ontario from 1947‚Äì1961, where he was a charter member of The Kappa Alpha Society. Education Collip as a graduate student, ca. 1914. The Discovery and Early Development of Insulin Digital Collection, Toronto Born in Belleville, Ontario, he enrolled at Trinity College at the University of Toronto at the age of 15, and studied physiology and biochemistry. He obtained a Ph.D. in Biochemistry from the same university in 1916. Career In 1915, at the age of 22, Collip accepted a lecturing position in Edmonton in the Department of Physiology at the University of Alberta Faculty of Medicine, shortly before completing his doctorate. He fulfilled the role for 7 years, eventually rising to the position of Professor and Head of the Department of Biochemistry in 1922. His research at the time was mainly focused on blood chemistry of vertebrates and invertebrates. He took a sabbatical leave beginning in April 1921, and travelled to Toronto on a Rockefeller Travelling Scholarship for a six-month position with Professor J. J. R. MacLeod of the University of Toronto's Department of Physiology. There his research program (on the effect of pH on the concentration of sugar in the blood) would take him to marine biological stations in Woods Hole, Massachusetts and St. Andrews, New Brunswick before he returned to Toronto late in the year. MacLeod was overseeing the work of Frederick Banting and Charles Best in their search for a treatment for diabetes which they had begun in May 1921. In December, when Banting and Best were having difficulties in refining the pancreatic extract, MacLeod freed Collip from his other research to enable him to join the research team. Collip's task was to prepare insulin in a more pure, usable form than Banting and Best had been able to achieve to date. Success of insulin In January 1922, after 14-year-old Leonard Thompson suffered a severe allergic reaction to an injection of insulin, Collip achieved the goal of preparing a pancreatic extract pure enough for him to recover and to use in clinical trials. Successful trials were soon completed and the future of insulin was assured. Banting, Best and Collip subsequently shared the patent for insulin, which they sold to the University of Toronto for one dollar. Regrettably, due to disagreements between Banting and MacLeod, there was ill- will generated within the team. The Nobel Prize for Medicine was awarded to Banting and MacLeod in 1923. Feeling that Best had been overlooked in the award, Banting shared his portion with Best. In response, MacLeod shared his portion with Collip. Nonetheless, Collip (and Best) have been largely forgotten as co-discoverers of insulin. Following this early success, Collip returned to Edmonton to take up a position as Head of the new Department of Biochemistry, and to pursue his own studies on hormone research. In 1928 he was recruited to McGill University in Montreal by his former graduate advisor, Archibald Macallum. Collip served as Chair of McGill's Department of Biochemistry from 1928 to 1941. From 1947-1961, Collip was appointed Dean of Medicine at the University of Western Ontario. He is regarded as a pioneer of endocrine research. He did pioneering work with the hormone Parathyroid hormone (PTH). He died on June 19, 1965 at the age of 72.

Most of it is still in use, carrying scrap either inbound or outbound to the Schnitzer scrap yard on the Everett waterfrontAtlantic Northeast Rails & Ports 14 No.12B, January 10, 2015. or freight to the Chelsea Produce Market, and non-revenue transfers of Amtrak and MBTA passenger equipment between the lines terminating at North Station and South Station. The line is also notable for its railroad bridge over the Charles River that passes under the Boston University Bridge between Boston and Cambridge, Massachusetts. History An Amtrak Genesis locomotive crosses Main Street in Cambridge. The railroad (full name Grand Junction Railroad and Depot Company) was chartered April 24, 1847, to connect the railroads entering Boston from the north and west with its wharves in East Boston. This was a rechartering of the Chelsea Branch Railroad, incorporated April 10, 1846. The first section to open was from East Boston to the Boston and Maine Railroad in Somerville, opened in 1849. It began at a huge waterfront yard complex on Boston Harbor, occupying the space east of the Eastern Railroad terminal and west of the Boston, Revere Beach and Lynn Railroad terminal. The line headed north with two tracks (minimum) just east of the Eastern Railroad's line, crossing at- grade and splitting to the west just south of Curtis Street, with a crossover track between the two lines south of the crossing (allowing Eastern Railroad trains from their terminal to use the Grand Junction). In 1905, the Grand Junction Railroad in East Boston was rebuilt into a below-grade two-track line, and the Eastern Railroad line was truncated to just north of the split. Next the Grand Junction crossed Chelsea Creek into Chelsea. It passed north of downtown Chelsea and through outlying areas of Everett before crossing the Mystic River into Somerville and running along the east side of the Boston and Maine Railroad's main line towards Boston. It soon crossed the border into Charlestown, part of Boston. Just south of Cambridge Street, the Grand Junction junctioned with and crossed the B&M.; After crossing the B&M;, the extension immediately crossed the Mystic River Branch of the Boston and Lowell Railroad, just before crossing back into Somerville. In Cambridge it crossed under the old B&L; mainline (with track connections) and merged with the Fitchburg Railroad. The Grand Junction Railroad Bridge crosses the Charles River underneath the Boston University Bridge. In March 1852 the line was leased to the Eastern Railroad between the B&M; in Somerville and Salem Turnpike (now called Broadway) in Chelsea. The Eastern Railroad, then ending in East Boston, used the line for downtown Boston access, building a cutoff in 1854 from their main line to the Grand Junction in Chelsea, and building a new line splitting from the Grand Junction just west of the B&M; and B&L; Mystic River Branch crossing and running just west of the B&M; into downtown. The Saugus Branch Railroad, bought by the Eastern April 30, 1852, was realigned in 1855 at its south end to feed into the Grand Junction rather than the B&M.; The rest of the line was built in 1856, connecting to the Boston and Worcester Railroad in Allston, now part of Boston. Instead of merging with the Fitchburg Railroad, it continued west along its north side for a bit (passing under the Boston and Lowell Railroad's new alignment) before turning south, crossing the Fitchburg Railroad at-grade onto its own alignment through Cambridge. A track connection was provided with the Fitchburg Railroad, connecting the East Boston-bound Grand Junction to the Fitchburg-bound Fitchburg. After running through Cambridge along what was once the shore of the Charles River and is now a rough border between the main campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the rest of Cambridge, the line crossed the river diagonally on a bridge under the Essex Street Bridge (now the Boston University Bridge) and joined with the Boston and Worcester Railroad (after 1867, the Boston and Albany Railroad). The line was reorganized as the East Boston Freight Railroad in 1862, and the Boston and Albany bought the property in 1869. It passed with the B&A; into larger companies - the New York Central Railroad, Penn Central and Conrail. On February 28, 1955, the counterweight fell off the Chelsea Creek drawbridge, taking the bridge permanently out of service; subsequently B&A; trains reached East Boston from Chelsea using B&M; trackage rights via Revere. B&A; service to East Boston ended around 1972. A small footnote is the Union Railroad, which was incorporated May 10, 1848, for the same purpose, and was authorized to merge with the Grand Junction February 25, 1854. Current status=West segment Circus Train on the Grand Junction in 2007 The section of the Grand Junction between the now vacated Beacon Park Yard and the Fitchburg Line is used by the MBTA to transfer southside commuter rail equipment to and from the MBTA Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility, and by Amtrak to transfer Downeaster equipment to and from Southampton Street Yard. CSX Transportation operates one daily freight to the New England Produce Center and scrap yards in Everett. The Barnum and Bailey Circus train often parked on the Grand Junction while the circus was in Boston. The track loading gauge is the minimal Plate B. The section of line is owned by MassDOT, although MIT owns the land of two segments with an easement for rail use. On October 2, 2008, the state government announced an agreement with CSX Transportation for the purchase and upgrade of several of CSX's freight lines in the state, including the western section of the Grand Junction. The agreement was signed on September 23, 2009. A first closing on June 11, 2010, transferred dispatching control of the line from CSX to the MBTA's commuter rail operator. The second closing on October 4, 2012, transferred ownership of the Grand Junction and several other important lines to the state, completing the $100 million deal. On November 16, 2012, Amtrak and MBTA equipment moves were limited to over the Grand Junction Railroad Bridge, and freight traffic was not allowed to use the bridges. On November 21, the bridge was closed to all rail traffic due to its poor condition. While emergency repairs were under way, trains moving between the north and south sides of Boston had to be routed via Pan Am Railways trackage between Ayer and Worcester, a lengthy detour. The bridge reopened in early January 2013, but was closed again from March to June for additional structural repairs. East segment Construction of the Silver Line Gateway busway on the Grand Junction right of way in Chelsea in 2015 From the Fitchburg Line to the Haverhill Line (shared at that point by the Newburyport/Rockport Line), the former Grand Junction is occupied by tracks which allow freight trains to move between the four northside main lines. The Newburyport/Rockport Line parallels the Grand Junction right-of-way from there to Broadway in Chelsea. In Everett, freight yard tracks occupy the Grand Junction right of way; in Chelsea, the Silver Line Gateway busway has been constructed from Everett Avenue to Eastern Avenue. CSX filed to abandon the section from 2nd Street in Everett to Saratoga Street in East Boston in 2002; the abandonment process was still under way when that segment was included in the 2009 agreement. By the 2010 and 2012 closings, an additional segment to the west in Everett was included in the sale to MassDOT. The East Boston Greenway in 2014 The section in East Boston, which largely shared a right of way with the Eastern Railroad's East Boston Branch, has fragmented ownership and uses. The section from Curtis Street to Lovell Street was transferred to Massport ownership and converted into the Martin A. Coughlin Bypass Road, a two-lane route for commercial traffic to and from Logan Airport that opened on November 26, 2012. Conrail abandoned the line between Lovell Street and the East Boston docks in the 1970s. The former rail yards north of Route 1A were used as a private \\"Park'N'Fly\\" lot for Logan Airport. In 1989, the Massachusetts Highway Department began proceedings to acquire the land by eminent domain as part of the Big Dig project. Since the Third Harbor Tunnel would bring additional traffic to Logan Airport, the site was to be converted to a public park, in partial restitution for the 1969 destruction of Wood Island Park for airport expansion. After a lengthy scandal over the proposed land taking (and later land swap) that sent Speaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives Charles Flaherty to jail and implicated others including U.S. Representative Bud Shuster, Massport purchased the land outright in 2001. In 2007, Bremen Street Park opened on the site. The remaining section to the south lay unused. Residents tried to clean up the tracks for use as a greenbelt in 1978, although local business leaders desired to reuse it as a haul road. Conrail donated that section to The Trust for Public Land in 1997. In 2007, after eight years of construction, the East Boston Greenway was opened on the corridor. Silver Line to Chelsea The Grand Junction railroad bridge over Chelsea Creek has been removed and part of the easternmost right-of-way has been converted into the Martin A. Coughlin Bypass Road, a two-lane route for commercial traffic to and from Logan Airport that opened November 26, 2012.Massport Opens Road for Commercial Traffic, 2012 In October 2013, after several months of planning, MassDOT announced funding to convert the section from Eastern Avenue to Sixth Street into a Silver Line busway and a parallel $3 million multi-use greenway. Rail-with-trail in Cambridge The City of Cambridge has done a feasibility study concerning adding a \\"rail with trail\\" multi-use path to be known as the Grand Junction Community Path from the Charles River Bike Paths at the Boston University Bridge, through MIT, paralleling Cardinal Medeiros Way northeast of Kendall Square, and connecting to the proposed extension of the Somerville Community Path near Twin City Plaza. Abandoned proposals for more western service Structural repairs to the railroad bridge over the Charles River near completion in April 2013. The \\"locally preferred alternative\\" for the Urban Ring project as of June 2008 calls for routing bus rapid transit along the Grand Junction right-of-way, from George Washington Park in Cambridgeport, over the Charles River. The existing railroad bridge would be widened to add lanes for buses and the path. In 2010, Lieutenant Governor Tim Murray publicly discussed branching the Framingham/Worcester Line over the Grand Junction to provide MBTA Commuter Rail service from Worcester to North Station. In December 2011, the Massachusetts Department of Transportation announced that \\"is not pursuing the use of the Grand Junction for increased MBTA Commuter Rail service at this point,\\" opting instead to expand South Station, which would allow more service from Worcester without the need for a North Station route. It further stated: \\"However, expanding Boston South Station is an enormously complex and expensive project without a specific timeframe. Should the need for increased Commuter Rail capacity become overwhelming in the period prior to the expansion of South Station, MassDOT might reopen the Grand Junction discussion. The use of Grand Junction for Commuter Rail service could meet some of the needs to be provided by an expanded South Station, at much lower cost and with much less time and complexity.\\"MBTA Dec 8, 2011 Meeting SummaryMBTA Dec 8, 2011 Meeting Presentation The Grand Junction would have been used to carry ethanol by rail to a tank farm in Revere as one of three route options considered in a proposal that underwent state safety and environmental review in 2013. Unit trains consisting of perhaps 60 tank cars would have run at night to deliver the gasoline additive.Study of the Safety Impacts of Ethanol Transportation by Rail through Boston, Cambridge, Chelsea, Everett, Somerville, and Revere, MassDOT 2013 In the face of community opposition and pressure from the state legislature, the company withdrew its proposal on July 2, 2013, days before the Lac-M√©gantic rail disaster. In 2014, the western part of the line was included in a proposal to connect a proposed West Station with North Station, with the creation of an additional infill station on the line in Cambridge.

Mineo's organization would eventually become the present-day Gambino crime family. Biography=Background In the early part of the 20th century, New York had five Sicilian crime families. With the imprisonment of powerful Sicilian Mafia boss Giuseppe Morello in 1910, Salvatore D'Aquila, one of Morello's chief captains, immediately emerged as the new chief Mafia power in New York City, mostly in East Harlem and Little Italy (in southern Manhattan), but he also led a faction in Brooklyn that was headed locally by Mineo. D'Aquila had assumed the title from Morello of Capo di tutti capi or Boss of Bosses. D'Aquila's family, with Mineo's Brooklyn faction included, reigned supreme through the 1910s. However, upon the advent of prohibition other Mafia crime families and also non-mafia operations began to gain power and influence and cemented their positions around the city. One of these crime families was the former Morello crime family, which had been taken over by Joseph \\"Joe the Boss\\" Masseria around 1920. Former boss Giuseppe Morello was released from prison approximately the same time and quickly aligned himself with Joe Masseria against boss Toto D'Aquila and his underbosses, including Mineo. D'Aquila family Manfredi Mineo would continue his rise within the New York Mafia and eventually become D'Aquila's second in command or underboss of all his operations while still leading his own family in Brooklyn as a D'Aquila faction. As rivalries and animosity grew between the D'Aquila and Masseria families, Mineo would eventually find himself in a precarious position. D'Aquila had previously sentenced Morello to death upon his release from prison, along with his ally Umberto Valenti, but through the intervention of Pittsburgh Mafia leader, Nicola Gentile, the death sentence on Morello and Valenti was revoked. With Valenti now in his debt, D'Aquila used this opportunity to recruit the feared Mafia leader in order to oppose the new Masseria-Morello alliance. Al Mineo faced the chance of losing power and influence within the D'Aquila crime family to Valenti, but in 1922 Valenti was murdered by Masseria-Morello forces. By the mid-1920s Mineo and his top lieutenant Steve Ferrigno began to assess their position within the D'Aquila organization, and understood at this time that the new power in New York was Joe Masseria, so Mineo secretly began to align himself with Masseria. Family takeover On October 10, 1928, while standing next to his car, D'Aquila was murdered by gunmen. Mineo, who had recently aligned himself with boss Joe Masseria, more than likely played a direct role in planning the murder of his boss. After declaring his allegiance to Masseria and showing his distorted loyalty by betraying his former boss, Mineo's place atop the D'Aquila crime family leadership was cemented. He had secured his Brooklyn interests and would now command one of the larger Manhattan-based Mafia groups in New York. With Ferrigno as his second in command based in the Bronx, the Mineo crime family would control a number of rackets: bootlegging, gambling, numbers and extortion. Castellammarese War Strong rivalries continued between various New York Mafia crime families and factions, the most heated rivalry being the one between Mineo's Manhattan-based allies in the Masseria crime family and those in the Brooklyn-based Castellammarese clan, a group of mafiosi from the Sicilian seaside town of Castellammare del Golfo, who rose to prominence during Prohibition and would become extremely independent and eventually oppose the dominance of boss Joe Masseria and his supporters such as Mineo. The rivalries and animosities between the two groups would eventually come to a head and a war within the Italian underworld would erupt and drag every Mafia crime family and faction in New York into the conflict. What became known as the Castellammarese War began in early 1930 and dragged on for the better part of two years, as New York Mafia leaders Joe Masseria and Salvatore Maranzano fought for dominance over the New York rackets. Mineo felt secure being aligned with Joe Masseria, who led the most powerful New York Mafia crime family and was recognized as the most influential crime boss in the city. The Masseria-Mineo alliance quickly gained the upper hand in the war as their forces began to move on Castellammarese-controlled territories and rackets members, eliminating rivals at every opportunity, but on August 15, 1930, the tide began to change when Masseria's top advisor and war chief, Giuseppe Morello, was killed. Mineo was named Masseria's new war chief and strategist and quickly surmised that the Castellammarese were gaining more support and more ground as the war dragged on. Mineo felt the only solution was to find and kill Maranzano before he could kill Masseria, this being the only sensible solution to ending the war and re-establishing dominance over the New York Mafia. Death On November 5, 1930, Mineo and his lieutenant Steve Ferrigno were murdered in the courtyard of an apartment building on Pelham Parkway in the Bronx. Earlier in the week, several Maranzano gunmen had rented a first floor apartment in the building. Their actual target was Masseria, who had been observed entering the building earlier in the week. However, when the gunmen saw Mineo and Ferrigno in the garden, they seized the opportunity and shot both of them from the apartment window. After Mineo's death, Francesco \\"Frank\\" Scalice became crime family boss. He immediately switched allegiance from Masseria to Maranzano, who was emerging as the winner in the gang war. It has been theorized that Scalise had arranged a secret deal with Maranzano to kill Mineo and become the organization boss, but Maranzano forces were able to eliminate Mineo without Scalise's help. On April 15, 1931, Joe Masseria was shot and killed in a Coney Island restaurant and the Castellammarese War was over. No person was ever charged in the Mineo murder. In 1963, government witness Joseph Valachi claimed that Girolamo Santuccio was one of the gunmen.

As the home of the university's Wildcats basketball team of the Pac-12 Conference, it is primarily used for basketball, but also has physical training and therapy facilities. Its construction is marked with a large copper cap that has oxidized brown. The arena opened in February 1973 and has an official capacity of 14,644 spectators. The elevation at street level is approximately above sea level. The McKale Center was named in honor of J.F. \\"Pop\\" McKale, a major athletic figure at U of A from 1914 to 1957. At one time, he was head coach of all of the school's athletic teams. He was head basketball coach from 1914 to 1921, where he achieved a record. He led the football team from 1914 to 1930, with an record. It was McKale's first team that resulted in Arizona's teams being nicknamed \\"Wildcats.\\" In 1914, Arizona's name meant very little in the college football world. Although they lost to Occidental College in Los Angeles a reporter for the Los Angeles Times was so impressed with Arizona's effort that he wrote, \\"The Arizona men showed the fight of wild cats ...\\" Soon afterward, Arizona's student-athletes were nicknamed the Wildcats.David Leighton, \\"Street Smarts: Before arena, road named for \\"Pop\\" McKale\\", Arizona Daily Star, June 17, 2014 Following a win over rival Arizona State on February 26, 2000, the university athletic department honored longtime head coach Lute Olson with a ceremony to name the McKale Center playing surface \\"Lute Olson Court.\\" Less than a year later, during a memorial service in January 2001 for Olson's late wife, Bobbi, it was renamed, \\"Lute and Bobbi Olson Court\\" in recognition of the couple's impact on the university and the city of Tucson. In 2002, the Eddie Lynch Athletics Pavilion, a state-of-the-art medical and strength/conditioning facility for Wildcat student athletes, was completed and opened. The pavilion (which cost $14 million) was a addition to the north end of McKale Center. The upper level has a museum-like display area, open to the public, showcasing the history of Arizona Wildcat athletics. In terms of capacity, McKale Center is the second-largest arena in the Pac-12 conference; Utah's Huntsman Center in Salt Lake City is first, but Arizona averages greater attendance. Arizona has the current longest streak of leading its conference in attendance in conference history, going on 34 seasons & second in the country currently behind Kentucky at 40. The University's spring and winter commencement ceremonies were held at McKale Center from 1973 until 2012; the 2013 ceremonies returned to Arizona Stadium after an absence of thirty years. Proposed renovation In December 2012, the university athletic department was given approval by the Arizona Board of Regents to select an architect to renovate the arena. \\"The hope is to get it to be where it's one concourse enclosed that you can walk around and have the restrooms and concessions and everything tied to it,\\" said athletic director Greg Byrne. The renovation would also include a club area, luxury seating, and more room for the athletics offices that occupy the McKale Center. The Arizona Athletic Department ultimately decided on AECOM to plan and design the renovation. The project will be completed in several phases from 2014‚Äì2017 at a cost of $80 million. McKale Center will remain open during the construction process, with a majority of the work done outside of basketball season. The first phase of the renovation includes a brand new HD video scoreboard which was completed at the end of December 2013. Other parts of the first phase also included new seating, a new floor, an improved locker room area and expanded restrooms and concessions. The first phase was completed in November 2014.

It is the fourth-largest community in Muleg√© Municipality. It had a population of 3,821 according to the Mexican federal census of 2010.  History  Photo taken from the Muleg√© Mission Indigenous peoples had lived in this area for thousands of years due to the abundance of water in the river valley. Extensive ancient cave paintings can be found in the nearby Sierra de Guadalupe mountains. In 1702, Jesuit Father Juan Maria de Salvatierra identified the valley of today's Muleg√© as a place for a mission to the Indians. It was not until 1754 that Father Francisco Escalante started the construction of the mission, called Misi√≥n Santa Rosal√≠a de Muleg√©. Years later, many other Jesuit fathers came into today's area of Muleg√© to bring the Catholic faith and convert the natives to Catholicism. The official name of the town is \\"Heroica Muleg√©.\\" This title is based on incidents during the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848. The Americans tried to occupy long stretches of the Pacific coast such as California, Baja California, and New Mexico all of which were then part of Mexico. The people of Muleg√© and surrounding settlements along the Pacific coastline defeated the Americans. As a result, Muleg√© was not occupied and was rewarded the official title \\"Heroica Muleg√©\\" by the national legislature. In the 21st century, official letters of the Government of Baja California Sur retain use of the title, \\"Heroica Muleg√©.\\"  Economy  Muleg√© is internationally famous for its rich fishing grounds in the Gulf of California. A warm current from the southern and a cold current from the northern Pacific come together in the Muleg√© area of the Gulf of California and encourage a great variety of different fish species. The Gulf is sometimes known as the \\"Sea of Cortez\\", after the Spanish explorer, Hern√°n Cort√©s, who sailed into the area. In the past, Muleg√©'s economy was largely based on fishing and farming. Today, tourism is a major income source for Muleg√©. Some come for the area's deep sea fishing. Kayaking; cave tours; bird watching; and fishing, with or without charters to catch a big game fish; are popular attractions. Today's tourism industry in Muleg√© is based on the fact that in 1976 the Highway MX 1 a paved road was constructed and Muleg√© became easily accessible by land. A trip from the US border to Muleg√© takes no more than 12 hours today. Before the highway was constructed, such a trip could take four days. The area has suffered damage from Hurricane John in 2006, Tropical Storm Julio in 2008, Hurricane Jimena in 2009, Hurricane Paul in 2012, and Hurricane Odile in 2014. All five hurricanes created major precipitation followed by high floods. All over the Muleg√© area, from the Pacific to the Gulf of California, rainfall and floods were devastating. Muleg√© was flooded by over 20 feet of water at the highway bridge and by 6 feet in the upper regions of town. Many homes located in the river valley were washed into the Gulf of California. Clean-up was still being done in January, 2015.  Climate and agriculture  The entire peninsula of Baja California is an area with one of the lowest precipitation rates in the world. Rain is rare but usually occurs between December and March, and hurricanes are occasionally a major threat to the Muleg√© area. There is a saying in Baja California: \\"It never rains in Baja, but if it rains, it pours.\\" Due to fertile soil and a rich water supply in the Muleg√© river valley, irrigation has supported agriculture in this area as a strong part of the economy, unlike other areas of Baja California. Tropical fruits are cultivated, including oranges, bananas, limes, and mangoes.  Transportation  By land, Muleg√© is accessible by Federal Highway 1, which runs from Tijuana at the US-MX border to Cabo San Lucas. Muleg√© is served by three airstrips in the area, which are used for private air travel: El Gallito Airstrip, Muleg√© Airstrip, and Punta San Pedro Airstrip. Regional flights are available at the Palo Verde Airport (to the north of town), and international flights are available at the Loreto Airport (123 km to the south).  Historic buildings  The Misi√≥n Santa Rosal√≠a de Muleg√© is located above the river, overlooking the river valley. A special feature of the town is the old prison. It has no bars. The prisoners could freely walk around town and establish or maintain families here. They just had to return to the prison in the evening. Escapes were rare because of the remoteness of Muleg√©. Until Mex 1 was paved, the area was surrounded by harsh desert for many miles. All prisoners had to agree to assist in tracking escapees and assist in their capture. Today, the old prison is operated as a museum, with a suggested nominal entry fee.

It is located in the Jura mountains near the border with Switzerland.  History  The area around Glay was part of Burgundy as early as 888, and came under the control of the Holy Roman Empire in 1034. The village is first historically reported in the 12th century as a centre for glass making, and the name Glay comes from the French word for glass. Control of the area changed hands many times in the following centuries as the many small feudal regions constantly competed with each other for land, taxes and prominence. During the period 1200-1700 Glay was alternately ruled by cities and states that are now part of modern France (Montb√©liard), Germany (W√ºrttemberg) and Switzerland (Neuch√¢tel). In 1259 Marguerite of Montbeliard, daughter of Thierry III of Montb√©liard (1205‚Äì1283) married the Grand Duke of Neuch√¢tel. Included as part of her dowry were the seigniories of Blamont (including Glay), Ch√¢telot, Belmont and Cuisance. Blamont was placed by the Lords of Neuch√¢tel under the protection of the counts and dukes of Burgundy to protect it from being taken back by Montb√©liard once control had passed to later generations. In his will Thierry III passed control of Montb√©liard itself to the Countess Guillemette, his great-granddaughter. Since she had married a lord of Burgundy, the entirety of Montb√©liard now came under the control of Burgundy, which outraged the other descendants of Thierry III, who had hoped to rule the area themselves. In order to avoid a war of succession, Renaud of Burgundy made some concessions. In the spring of 1283 he ceded to Thi√©baud IV, Lord of Neuch√¢tel, the seigniories of Blamont (including Glay) and Ch√¢telot, and guaranteed their status as being held by Neuch√¢tel. At least twice in the century that followed Glay sought to free itself from the control of Neuch√¢tel by force of arms. Each effort was defeated. In 1340 Thi√©baud VI of Neuch√¢tel received the villages of Glay, H√©rimoncourt, Pierrefontaine, Seloncourt and Villars-l√®s- Blamont as part of the dowry brought by his wife upon their marriage. In 1383 Glay was part of the dowry (with many other local towns) of the wife of Thi√©baud VIII of Neuch√¢tel. In the centuries that followed it was part of the ever-changing alliances, rivalries and wars between Montb√©liard, the Duke of Burgundy, the Kingdom of France, the Swiss Confederation and Basel. In 1439 mercenaries who were not paid after the Treaty of Arras (1435) ended the war between King Charles VII of France and Philip, Duke of Burgundy plundered the area. In August 1474 during the Burgundian Wars, following the devastation of Alsace by Charles the Bold, the area was again heavily damaged in the fighting. After Charles' death at the hands of the Swiss in the Battle of Nancy in 1477, the area around Glay came under the control of the Bishop of Basel, Jean de Venningen. The church returned the area to Neuch√¢tel in 1478. By the early 16th century the power of the Lords of Neuch√¢tel was on the decline after Thi√©baud IX failed to produce a male heir. After a struggle over succession marked by wars and lawsuits, on May 4, 1506 Ulrich, Duke of W√ºrttemberg, who had also taken control of Montb√©liard and held the title of Count of Montb√©liard, bought all of Blamont, including Glay. Because the German Dukes of W√ºrttemberg were Lutheran, the area around Glay has since this time been Lutheran, despite the fact that France overall is predominantly Catholic. During the Thirty Years War the area around Glay suffered tremendously. In 1635 alone the region was invaded by troops from both warring alliances and suffered from the plague and famine. After a period under the control of Spain, the region around Glay was occupied by the French in 1668 but handed back under the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle. France again conquered the area in 1674, and it was finally ceded to France at the Treaty of Nijmegen in 1678. Control from the King in Paris brought heavy taxation that devastated the local economy. In 1790, after the French revolution, the Department of Doubs was created, which includes the area around Glay. When Napoleon was defeated at Waterloo in 1815, border skirmishes broke out between French troops and those from various subdivisions of Switzerland as the latter tried to take advantage of the chaos in Paris. Although Glay remained within the areas controlled by France adjacent to the Swiss border, the area suffered still further damage. In World War II Glay was liberated by French forces in September, 1944, although some fighting continued in the region through November.  Centre de Glay  In recent years the town had benefitted from the presence of the Centre de Glay, which was most recently a convention centre with a 120-room hotel designed to draw more visitors to the area. The facility was founded in 1823 by the Swiss minister Father Jacquet to provide vocational training to disadvantaged Protestant children from the area. It later sheltered a private college, and was converted to a conference centre in 1953. The Centre closed in September, 2004 for budgetary reasons, and because the older buildings did not meet current European Union building codes. The closing was lamented as a loss to the Lutheran communities of the area.  PopulationNearby towns The following diagram shows the towns nearby within a radius.

The channels concentrate on news and information and first started broadcasting 1 April 1992. They are broadcast on satellite and produced in Berlin. DW English broadcast service is aimed at the overseas market. Previous logo, used from mid-2000s until 5 February 2012 History DW (TV) began as RIAS-TV, a television station launched by the West Berlin broadcaster RIAS (Radio in the American Sector / Rundfunk im Amerikanischen Sektor) in August 1988. The fall of the Berlin Wall the following year and German reunification in 1990 meant that RIAS-TV was to be closed down. On 1 April 1992, Deutsche Welle inherited the RIAS-TV broadcast facilities, using them to start a German- and English- language television channel broadcast via satellite, DW (TV), adding a short Spanish broadcast segment the following year. In 1995, it began 24-hour operation (12 hours German, 10 hours English, two hours Spanish). At that time, DW (TV) introduced a new news studio and a new logo. In 2001, Deutsche Welle (in conjunction with ARD and ZDF) founded the German TV subscription TV channel for North American viewers. The project was shut down after four years due to low subscriber numbers. It has since been replaced by the DW-TV channel (also a subscription service). Unlike most other international broadcasters, DW-TV doesn't charge terrestrial stations for use of its programming, and as a result its News Journal and other programmes are rebroadcast on numerous public broadcasting stations in several countries, including the United States, Australia, and New Zealand. In the Philippines, selected Anglophone programmes are shown nationwide on Net 25. In the U.S., some of its programs were distributed via the World Channel as well as MHz Worldview, although after the closure of MHz Worldview in 2020, a few stations has since offer a full carriage of DW-TV in select areas. In March 2009, DW-TV expanded its television services in Asia with two new channels: DW-TV Asia and DW-TV Asia+. DW-TV Asia (DW-TV Asien in German) contains 16 hours of German programming and 8 hours in English while DW-TV Asia+ contains 18 hours of English programmes plus 6 hours of German programmes.Two New Dedicated Channels Provide Gateway to Europe: Two DW-TV channel launched in Asia Deutsche Welle. In August 2009, DW-TV's carriage in the United Kingdom on Sky channel 794 ceased, although the channel continues to be available via other European satellites receivable in the UK. Deutsche Welle relaunched their television channels on 6 February 2012, using the abbreviation DW for all its services. Deutsche Welle also revamped the television schedules. Deutsche Welle changed its schedules again on 22 June 2015, with DW in Asia and Oceania and DW (Europe) merged to become a 24-hour English news channel, discontinued English programmes in DW (Arabia) and DW (Espa√±ol). Broadcasting DW-TV is broadcast via the satellites AsiaSat 7, GSAT-15, Nilesat 102, Atlantic Bird 3, Hot Bird 13B, AMC-1 and Intelsat 9. DW-TV is also available on the Internet and on Digital terrestrial television in small handful of cities in the United States.

On 7 January 1926 the company opened a long-wave transmitter (which soon became known as the Deutschlandsender, since its broadcasts could be heard all over Germany) at K√∂nigs Wusterhausen near Berlin. A large part of the station's output consisted of the retransmission of material from the nine regional broadcasting companies which had been established in the previous three years; within this framework Deutsche Welle attempted to emphasize educational programming for a nationwide audience. The far reach of the Deutschlandsender's long-wave transmitter meant that Deutsche Welle's programming could be heard well beyond Germany's borders. In September 1926, the Munich regional station -- the Deutsche Stunde in Bayern -- received feedback from listeners in Amsterdam when its programmes first began to be relayed by the Deutschlandsender. On 1 January 1933, Deutsche Welle GmbH was officially renamed Deutschlandsender GmbH and given the specific remit of relaying representative programme material from the regional companies to a national audience. The appointment only a few weeks later, of Adolf Hitler as Chancellor of Germany was, however, soon to alter the character of all German radio stations radically.

It is the first of the monster specific books published by Wizards of the Coast to be made for the 3.5 edition of the game. It cites sources from Dragon magazine, Manual of the Planes, the Planes of Law Campaign Expansion, and the first edition of Fiend Folio. The book is notable for being published for use with the two main endorsed campaign settings of Forgotten Realms and Eberron with many creatures containing sections explaining where they might be found in the campaign setting.

It is notable for its descriptions of where the monsters might be found in the Eberron and Forgotten Realms campaign settings. Chris Perkins explained: \\"Almost all of the monsters in the Monster Manual III are new. We didn't want to give gamers a bunch of beasties they'd already seen, and we found several interesting monster niches to fill. That said, we felt it was important to update some of the yugoloths (canoloth, mezzoloth, nycaloth, and ultraloth) to v.3.5, and we also updated the 1st edition flind, kenku, and susurrus.

Reception The reviewer from Pyramid commented: \\"The Monster Manual III suffers from exactly the same problems that any added-on creature collection always suffer from. Many of the monsters are derivative or simply variations on pre-existing creatures. Additionally, there is the problem of springing these monsters into campaigns that have existed for months or years without them. Many creatures have a back story already added for them, allowing for as seamless of an addition to an ongoing campaign as possible, and virtually every creature lists where it frequently occurs in the Wizard's campaign settings of Faerun and Eberron, nice additions for players in those worlds. As is normal with Wizards of the Coast books, the art is routinely excellent, and the pages are well laid out and easy to follow.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Official Monster Manual III page at Wizards of the Coast Category:Dungeons & Dragons sourcebooks ","title":"Monster Manual III"},{"id":"1874744","text":"Delrina was a Canadian software company founded in 1988 and subsequently acquired by the American software firm Symantec in 1995. The company sold electronic form products, including PerForm and FormFlow, but was best known for its WinFax software package, which enabled computers equipped with fax modems to transmit copies of documents to standalone fax machines or other similarly equipped computers. Delrina also produced a set of screensavers, including one that resulted in a well-publicized lawsuit for copyright and trademark infringement (Berkeley Systems Inc. v. Delrina). The case set a precedent in American law whereby satiric commercial software products are not subject to the same First Amendment exemptions as parodic cartoons or literature. It also sold online communications software with its WinComm product and produced a Web browser called Cyberjack. The firm was sold to Symantec in 1995. After the company was acquired by Symantec, various divisions were sold off and several of Delrina's former executives went on to found venture capital firms.  Corporate history  Delrina was founded in Toronto in 1988 by Zimbabwean expatriate Bert Amato, South African expatriates Mark Skapinker and Dennis Bennie and American Lou Ryan. Delrina was Bennie's third major entrepreneurial start up after co-founding Mission Electronics, a high-end home entertainment equipment producer, and Aviva Software, which became Ingram Micro Canada. Delrina's business strategy was to \\"establish technical and market leadership in niche markets\\", which it accomplished with its electronic form and PC-based fax software. A year before the firm was incorporated, Amato and Skapinker had quit their jobs to start work on an electronic forms product which would eventually become PerForm. Both would later meet with Bennie, who was then the co-founder and CEO of Ingram Micro Canada before becoming CEO of Carolian Systems International, a firm that made business software for Hewlett-Packard. Bennie facilitated an initial seed investment of $1.5 million CAD to finance a new start-up company, \\"Delrina\\", to develop this idea. In return, Carolian received 51% of Delrina's shares, Dennis Bennie would become Chairman and CEO, Mark Skapinker President, and Bert Amato CTO of newly formed Delrina Technology Inc. Delrina's initial corporate headquarters was located in a small office on Mount Pleasant Rd. in Toronto. A sales office was set up in San Jose, California which became its worldwide sales center run by co-founder Lou Ryan. From its Toronto headquarters, the company expanded by establishing branch offices in Kirkland, Washington; Washington, DC; and Lexington, Massachusetts. Other offices were later established in the United Kingdom, France, and Germany.  Origins of PerForm  Delrina's initial product offering was an electronic forms application called PerForm. Amato and Skapinker came up with the idea for the product while working as consultants that what their clients wanted was a way to fill in forms electronically, rather than an easier way to create paper- based forms from a computer. There was significant and long-term uptake of electronic forms products within governmental agencies both in Canada and the United States, the latter spurred on in particular by the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act to reduce the total amount of paperwork handled by the United States government. One of the firm's early major software deals included a multi-year agreement to sell PerForm to the U.S. Navy in 1990. Soon after the software was installed on Compaq laptops that accompanied U.S. troops during the First Gulf War, where it was used to requisition \\"everything from Coca-Cola to privies\\". Other significant volume sales went to 3M and Rockwell International. What helped set apart Delrina's electronic forms from its competitors in product reviews included its easy-to-use interface, its extensive development tools, and its comparatively low price. It also scored highly when it came to workflow and routing functions as well as security features. In early 1991 InfoWorld selected PerForm Pro as its \\"Product of the Year\\" in the electronic forms category, and PC World Magazine gave the product it's \\"Best Buy\\" designation. PerForm proved to be successful in its niche, effectively capturing the retail market by 1993. In the early 1990s Delrina made deals with value-added resellers like NCR and GE Information Services who had the staff to customize the product to the needs of corporate customers looking to move away from paper-based forms. The forms products sold well and the annual revenues for the firm grew steadily; 1989 annual revenues (in Canadian dollars) were $5,630,393, in 1990 they were $8,759,623, and by 1991 they were $11,894,474.  Struggle for profitability  Despite the growing revenues, the company struggled to make a profit. Heavy expenditures‚Äîprimarily marketing along with research and development costs‚Äîdrove the firm's losses from $500,000 from 1989 to $1.5 million by the end of the following fiscal year. For fiscal 1991 it posted a net loss of $1.7 million. Needing an infusion of funds, in April 1991 Bennie managed to raise $7.7 million in a private placement. The firm subsequently sought to find ways to more widely distribute its electronic form software, with Bennie saying in May 1992 that \\"we've barely scratched the surface of our market\\". In early 1992 word leaked to the press on a possible merger between WordStar International Inc., and soon after both firms made public the fact that they had signed a letter of intent on a merger deal. However, just over a month later word came out that the merger talks had fallen through, at the time cited to differences over \\"complex legal, accounting and management issues\\". WordStar, whose share of the word processing market had by that time fallen to 5% (from a high of 80%) was seeking Delrina's advanced technologies while Delrina was hoping to utilize the other firm's established global sales network. Despite the failure of the merger talks, Bennie said soon after that \\"we're still convinced that a larger sales force would give us the kind of marketing clout we need. I still believe that it's possible for us to become a global operation\\". Not long after WordStar merged with Spinnaker Software Corporation and SoftKey Software Products Inc. to form SoftKey International. Delrina subsequently signed deals with Wallace Computer Services, UARCO and NCR Corporation in an effort to gain greater sales distribution of its products.  Development of WinFax  In a deliberate attempt to diversify the business, The Company chose to move into the fax software market with its WinFax product. Software developer Tony Davis (another South African expatriate who had moved to Canada) was initially hired as a consultant to work on the forms line of products in the late 1980s, soon afterwards becoming part of that team. In his spare time he developed a prototype of what would become the first WinFax product, with the agreement that Delrina would be its publisher. In 1990 Delrina devoted a relatively small space to this new product at that year's COMDEX (a computer trade show), under a sign that said simply: \\"Send a Fax from Your PC\\". It garnered the most attention of any Delrina product being demonstrated at that show. This interest convinced the founding partners of the commercial viability of the product. Tony Davis went on to sell his product idea to Delrina, and stayed on as its lead software architect and designer. The initial version of WinFax only worked on fax modems containing a specific chipset, and was only capable of sending faxes; it could not receive them. This was remedied with the launch of the WinFax PRO 2.0 product during the summer of 1991. One of the key factors that differentiated this version of WinFax from other fax software packages of the time was the deliberate attempt to make the program compatible with all fax/modems. Prior to the introduction of WinFax PRO 2.0, competitors concentrated primarily on building software that would only work with a single brand of fax/modem hardware. At the same time that it launched its WinFax PRO 2.0 product, Delrina also announced an OEM version of the same product designed to be bundled with new fax/modems. Within a few months, eight modem manufacturers had agreed to bundle this OEM version (called \\"WinFax LITE\\") of the program along with their own product. By the summer of the following year this number had grown to 50 OEM partnerships with various fax-modem and computer system manufacturers to bundle the \\"LITE\\" version of Delrina's WinFax software with their own products. By February 1993 this number had grown to over 100 OEM partnerships. Bundling the LITE version of WinFax proved to be lucrative for Delrina. Whenever a person used the program for the first time and submitted their registration information by fax to the company, Delrina would subsequently mail the user an upgrade offer for the PRO version. This sales technique proved to be very effective, and the firm ended up making most of its sales from these upgrades. In order to reach Apple computer users in this marketplace Delrina acquired Solutions Inc. and their BackFax software for the Macintosh platform in December 1991, which would become \\"Delrina Fax Pro\\". A version of the program was also designed for use in DOS (\\"DosFax PRO\\") which was launched in June 1992. Initially looking for ways to further improve its electronic forms software, in November 1991 Delrina had attempted to buy two associated firms that produced Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software, with the intention of incorporating OCR functionality into its forms products. The acquisition deal fell through, though by Fall 1992 Delrina had made a deal with Caere Corporation to include its AnyFax OCR software within its products. This functionality was incorporated into WinFax PRO 3.0 in late 1992, and subsequently in FormFlow Despite the agreement with Caere, the subsequent version of WinFax used Xerox's TextBridge OCR engine instead. Based on strong sales of WinFax, by October 1992 Delrina posted its first profitable quarter in three years. At the same time, the firm also announced its intention to acquire other software firms that sold into the consumer software market.  Acquisition of Amaze Inc.  In October 1992 Delrina acquired Amaze Inc., based out of Kirkland, Washington. The firm created daily planner software, providing time management features while providing some humour by featuring licensed cartoon strips like Cathy, Bloom County, B.C. and The Far Side. The firm became a wholly owned subsidiary of Delrina in a deal which also paid down Amaze's $3 million (U.S.) debt and placed two of the firm's directors on Delrina's board. These two individuals were Rowland Hanson, former VP Corporate Communications for Microsoft and George Clut. = Berkeley Systems Inc. v. Delrina = A scene from the revamped \\"Censored Toaster Module\\" issued after the court case One of Delrina's screensaver products was based on the licensed Bloom County characters Opus the Penguin and Bill the Cat. The initial Opus 'n Bill screensaver, launched in 1993, landed the company in court as its Death Toasters module depicted Opus taking shots at a number of flying toasters, a well-known emblem in Berkeley System's Flying Toasters module from their After Dark screensaver. Berkeley Systems sued for copyright and trademark infringement. The following court case of Berkeley Systems Inc. v. Delrina was fought by Delrina on the basis that a software-based parody should fall under the same First Amendment protection offered to the press. A preliminary injunction was filed against Delrina in September 1993 which halted the sale of the product, and subsequently forced a recall of it through the court. The case drew political satirist Mark Russell to speak in defense of Delrina, who argued in favour of the screensaver as a valid parody, while the estate of composer Irving Berlin sided with Berkeley.Lesk. Michael Understanding Digital Libraries. p.300 Morgan Kaufmann. 1-55860-924-5 Commenting on the case involving his characters, cartoonist Berkeley Breathed said: \\"If David Letterman can depict the NBC peacock wearing men's boxer shorts, then Delrina should be able to plug a flying toaster with hot lead\\". Judge Eugene Lynch found in favour of Berkeley, citing that a commercial software product was not subject to the same exemptions as parodist literature, and that the toasters were too similar in design. The total cost of the court case and the recalled product was roughly $150,000 U.S. In the court case, it was also cited that the design for winged toasters was not original and that the Berkeley Systems' design was itself derived from the Jefferson Airplane album Thirty Seconds Over Winterland, which also used flying toasters adorned with wings. Berkeley argued that the firm was unaware of the previous artwork until 1991, and that the album cover's toasters had clocks in addition to their wings. Jefferson Airplane later sued Berkeley Systems in turn for the use of the same flying toaster emblem. The rock group lost the case as they did not trademark the album cover at the time of publication. The court decision was interpreted by the writer L. Ray Patterson as an erosion of First Amendment rights over the increasing protection provided to copyright holders. While Delrina lost the court case, the publicity it generated was substantial, with coverage in over a thousand newspapers across North America, resulting in consumers turning out in droves to buy the offending program before it could be recalled. Delrina subsequently removed the wings from the toasters and replaced them with propellers in order to avoid trademark infringement. The module was also renamed from \\"Death Toasters\\" to \\"Censored Toaster Module\\". Thanks to the publicity from the court case, sales of this new version ended up being triple what had been expected. Updated modules for this particular screensaver were sold for the next couple of years. Josef Zankowicz, who managed the firm's publicity during this period, later commented: \\"We had the feeling that we might get sued‚Äîactually, we prayed to get sued. Because by suing us, the number one player in the marketplace opened up the door. Anyone can create an interesting product, spend $10 million and create awareness of it. But it's another thing to create a product and spend one-tenth that amount and create twice as much awareness.\\" This division of the firm at its height only represented less than 15% of the company's total revenues.  WinFax  The increasing sales of the WinFax product lead to significant growth in revenues for the firm; by 1992 its sales had climbed to $19,208,420, and more than doubling the next year to $48,583,932. The product soon overtook that of the initial forms product in terms of revenues, and within a few years of its launch, WinFax would account for 80% of the company's revenues. By 1994 the firm had sold more than 3 million copies of WinFax, and it regularly featured in the \\"Top 10\\" lists of software applications sold during this period. The rapid growth in sales of this product was unexpected, with Bennie quoted in an interview from late 1993 as saying \\"the success of WinFax really caught us by surprise\\". With the success of the WinFax product, the company grew rapidly. By early 1993 the number of employees had grown to 250, and by the end of the year to 350. The increasing success of the WinFax product consequently led to significant strains on the firm to handle the increasing volume of calls to its Technical Support department, as each of the over 300 modems on the market at the time had their own nuances in how they implemented the fax data standard. Delrina spent roughly $800,000 in an improved telephone infrastructure in an attempt to get wait times to under five minutes. In December 1993 Delrina hired 40 additional people to help alleviate the growing number of calls to the firm for technical support. By the end of 1994 the situation had improved to the point where noted industry commentator Robert X. Cringely put Delrina in his shortlist of firms providing \\"exceptional\\" product support. In order to further enhance the appeal of its new flagship product, in 1993 the firm established a Communication Services division, designed to tap into the commercial market. The firm started making deals with major telecommunication companies, such as BellSouth and MCI Inc. in preparation for the services the firm was about to offer. In November of that year the division launched its Fax Broadcast service. The Fax Broadcast service allowed subscribers to upload a single fax and a recipient list to Delrina. Systems at Delrina would then send out the fax to the recipients on that list, to a maximum of 500 fax numbers. A subsequent Fax Mailbox feature‚Äîwhich enabled subscribers to remotely access both fax and voice messages from a single phone number‚Äîwas initially held up following a dispute with AlphaNet Telecom for the rights to the technology. This dispute was resolved by June 1994, though with both sides publicly disputing the story of the other, and with AlphaNet receiving an undisclosed sum in compensation. By late 1994 the firm was considered one of the fastest-growing software companies in North America, and employed over 500 people, most located at its offices in Toronto. The firm's financial situation improved greatly, and by February 1995 Delrina was reported to have captured almost three-quarters of the fax software market, was debt-free and had $40 million in the bank. The firm was shipping 200,000 units of WinFax a month, and had an installed base of four million users. The cost of doing business had also improved, as the firm's cost of sales was now 25% of net sales, down from 30% the previous fiscal year, improving the firm's gross profits.  The impact of Windows 95  In November 1992 Skapinker met Bill Gates at a Microsoft-sponsored dinner where he asked whether there were any plans to include any fax functionality in their forthcoming operating system (which could become Windows 95). Gates replied that there were plans to include \\"base-level fax capability\\" in the next version of Windows, and suggested that Skapinker get in touch with his development staff in order to produce a value- added product for it. The firm decided to work on a suite of applications designed to be an enhancement on what was to be available in Windows 95. In response to a question about Windows 95, Bennie responded by saying: \\"We are quite convinced that on top of Windows 95, we can build four different applications and will encompass fax, data, telephony or digital voice, and Internet access\\". This would later become the CommSuite 95 product. In 1994 the firm acquired AudioFile, a company that specialized in computer-based voice technology. The company created a product called TalkWorks, which enabled users to use certain fax/modems as a voice mail client. Seeing a growing business in online communications utilities, Delrina licensed Hilgraeve's HyperACCESS terminal emulator system in 1993, and used it as the basis for the initial version of its WinComm online communications software. The initial version of the product was originally bundled with WinFax as part of the Delrina Communications Suite, but in March 1994 was issued as a standalone product. It was a relative latecomer to the market, which was then dominated at the time by Datastorm's Procomm series of communications software. Delrina tried to expand aggressively into this market space, first by acquiring the Canadian online bulletin board service CRS Online, and then using it as a distribution channel for free versions of its WinComm LITE and DOS-based FreeComm products in March 1995. When the Internet was opened to commercial interests in the mid-1990s, Delrina started to expand in this nascent market space with their Cyberjack 7.0 product, launched in December 1995. Created by a development team based in South Africa, it included a Web browser, Usenet news reader, ftp client, IRC and integration with the Microsoft Exchange email program. The program used an interesting variant of the now-common bookmark, using a \\"Guidebook\\" to store information for various Internet addresses. CommSuite 95 shipped later that same month, bundling WinFax PRO 7.0 along with WinComm PRO 7.0, TalkWorks and the Cyberjack suite of Internet components. With the release of Windows 95 in August 1995, Delrina was now competing directly against Microsoft in the fax/electronic communications marketplace, as Windows 95 included a basic faxing application as an accessory, along with a licensed version of Hilgraeve's HyperTerminal communication package, (which was also used as the basis for Delrina's own WinComm program). While these applications offered only rudimentary fax and online communication services in comparison to the mature Delrina products, Microsoft was perceived as a potentially serious future competitor in the communications market space. The release of the initial version of Microsoft's Internet Explorer in late 1995 as a free product effectively killed off the early emerging market for non-free browsers, creating a market where Delrina's Cyberjack browser could not hope to compete.  Acquisition by Symantec and aftermath  In late Spring of 1995, Delrina Chairman Dennis Bennie met with Symantec CEO Gordon Eubanks to discuss the possibility of merging the two firms. In September 1995 Delrina's founders‚Äîwho owned a controlling interest in the firm‚Äîsold the firm to Symantec in a stock deal worth $415 million US. The deal was first announced on July 6 of that year, with shareholders from both firms approving the merger on November 20. The merger was completed on November 22, 1995 and Delrina officially became part of Symantec. The deal made the merged company the fifth largest American software firm at the time. The firm became the \\"Delrina Group\\" within Symantec, which brought under its control other communication software products that belonged to the parent firm, such as pcAnywhere. Bennie joined the Board of Symantec and was also appointed an Executive Vice President. At its height the company employed more than 700 people worldwide, the majority based in Canada. Symantec was following a general trend of large American firms buying smaller Canadian software companies. Other contemporaneous examples include Softimage and Zoom- it being bought by Microsoft, and Alias being bought by Silicon Graphics. Parts of the company were subsequently sold off, such as the sale of Delrina's Electronic Forms Division to JetForm in September 1996. JetForm, which later changed its name to Accelio, was in turn bought by Adobe Systems. Adobe officially discontinued the electronic forms products in 2004. Creative Wonders bought the rights to the Echo Lake multimedia product, which was re- shaped as an introductory program on multimedia and re-released as Family Album Creator. Though the market for fax software would shrink significantly as the use of email became more pervasive, WinFax brought in significant revenue for Symantec; a year after the merger sales of fax software accounted for 10% of Symantec's revenues.  Post-Delrina  Delrina was a catalyst for entrepreneurial talent and greatness, as many of the principals and employees of Delrina went on to find new successful ventures. With investments from Skapinker and Amato, and Bennie as lead Director, Davis went on to form Lanacom, which developed an early Internet \\"push content\\" product. This firm and its technology were sold just over a year after its inception to Backweb, a NASDAQ listed software company; Davis remained president and Bennie was brought on as Director. Skapinker and Davis then went on to found Brightspark, a software venture capital firm. Brightspark Ventures raised a number of VC Funds from Canadian Financial institutions raising $60m in 1999 and $55m in 2004. Brightspark employed a number of ex-Delrina employees including Allen Lau, Eva Lau, Sandy Pearlman, Marg Vaillancourt. Brightspark Ventures has twice won the Canadian Venture Capital Association \\"Deal of the Year Award\\", for the sale of ThinkDynamics to IBM and for the sale of Radian6 to Salesforce.com. Bennie would move on to found XDL Capital, a company which manages venture capital funds. XDL Capital‚Äîappropriately named after \\"Ex Delrina\\"‚Äîraised money for two funds: XDL Ventures (XDL), raising $25 million in 1997, and XDL Intervest (XDLI), raising $155 million in 1999. David Latner, former legal counsel for Delrina, was a partner in both funds, and Amato (former partner, Delrina) was an advisor and major investor to XDL Capital. He also participated in several investee companies as a Director and/or Advisor. XDL Intervest focuses primarily on internet-specific entrepreneurial companies and Bennie brought in two new principals: Tony Van Marken, former CEO of Architel Systems Corp. (ASYC), and Michael Bregman, former CEO of Second Cup Ltd. (T.SKL). XDL has assembled an established board and advisory team, which includes Canadian billionaire Robert Young, a native of Hamilton, Ontario, who co-founded Red Hat Inc (RHAT) and remains its chairman. Several of XDL's venture investments were in companies started or run by ex-Delrina employees who founded successful businesses, fostered by the innovative and entrepreneurial environment of Delrina. A few of the successes today are listed below: Delano Founded by Bahman Koohestani, another early developer at Delrina, was a company which developed e-business solutions for corporations. XDL Capital provided seed capital prior to Delano listing publicly. Bennie was the Chairman. Delano was listed on NASDAQ (DTEC) was subsequently sold to divine in 2003. Pinpoint Software Corporation a supplier of software solutions for managing networked PCs, was founded in 1992 by Lou Ryan. Ryan was CEO & President with Bennie acting as director. Pinpoint was partially funded by XDL Capital. Pinpoint changed its name to ClickNet Software in 1998. Uniting the company name with the successful ClickNet product family name strengthens the product and corporate identity. The company was eventually renamed Entercept Security Technologies Inc. In 2004, Entercept was sold to Network Associates for $120M where they incorporated Entercept's technology into its McAfee line of antivirus protection and other security products. Prot√©g√© Software was formed in 1996 and was founded by Larry Levy, Delrina's European Managing Director. Levy acted as President and CEO with Bennie as the principal investor. The company raised a $120M round of finance with XDL Intervest participating in 2003. Prot√©g√© has successfully launched 20 U.S. companies in Europe, nine of which are among Red Herring Top 50 Private Companies. In addition, five of these companies have gone public during Prot√©g√©'s tenure with them. The company was ultimately sold to various buyers including Warburg Pincus after the internet bubble burst. Netect Ltd., an XDL financed venture developing network security software, was purchased by Bindview Development Corporation (NASDAQ:BVEW) in 2001. Marc Camm (Ex Delrina GM Desktop Communications Business Unit) was brought on by Bennie to manage Netect. After the Company was purchased, Camm joined Bindview as the E.V.P. of Marketing. Prior to joining Netect, Marc was the general manager of Symantec and systems group product manager for Microsoft Canada. Within a few years all of Delrina's major market focuses‚Äîfax and form software‚Äîwould be overtaken or superseded by email, e-commerce and the Internet. Daily planning software remains a niche market, and the immersive 3D environment used for creating multimedia presentations has (so far) fallen by the wayside in favour of more traditional user interfaces. Symantec ended support for its final WinFax PRO product in June 2006. Delrina is best remembered by its former employees as an incubator for ideas and for providing industry experience to the many people who would go on to work at subsequent software and hardware companies, many in the Toronto region. A forum exists on Yahoo called \\"xdelrina\\", where many former employees of the firm continue to keep in contact with each other.  Delrina software and services = Forms products  Sample form created in Delrina PerForm Designer, circa 1994 The company's first product was PerForm, an electronic forms software package. PerForm and its sibling product, FormFlow, (which was aimed at workgroup and enterprise-level electronic forms processing and delivery) became one of the best selling products in its market. Delrina competed against WordPerfect's Informs package, Microsoft's Electronic Forms Designer, Novell's Informs, Lotus Software's Forms and JetForm's JetForm Workflow software. PerForm and FormFlow were designed to allow users to create self-contained form applications which could be passed back and forth across a network. Both PerForm and FormFlow consisted of two distinct parts: \\"Designer\\", which created the form application, and \\"Filler\\", so users could submit the forms either by fax or, later, e-mail. The program could ease repetitive fill tasks, include mandatory fields, and use an input mask to accept only data entered in a valid format. The information could be saved and restored in a dBase file that used a Public-key cryptography system to encrypt the data running from client to server. The initial version of PerForm was designed for the Graphics Environment Manager (better known as \\"GEM\\"), a DOS-based windowing system. Later versions of this program, known as PerForm PRO, were designed to work under Windows 3.1 and subsequent Windows operating systems. PerForm PRO 3.0 included integration with Delrina's own WinFax software, and included a range of automation tools. As PerForm captured the retail market, it became apparent that there was a need for electronics forms delivery and processing at the workgroup and enterprise levels. In 1994 Delrina FormFlow was released, which was designed to meet this need. One of the key features of FormFlow 1.1 was forms integration with email, and its Filler module was available for DOS, Windows and Unix.  WinFax  The \\"About\\" screen for WinFax 3.0 from 1992, depicting several of its principal programmers. WinFax enabled computers equipped with fax-modems to send faxes directly to stand-alone fax machines or other similarly equipped computers. Several versions of the WinFax product were released over the next few years, initially for Windows 3.x and then a Windows 95-based version. WinFax PRO 2.0 for Windows was released in July 1991. The Windows versions were also localized to major European and Asian languages. The company made further in- roads by establishing tie-ins with modem manufacturers such as U.S. Robotics and Supra that bundled simple versions of the product (called \\"WinFax LITE\\") that offered basic functionality. Those wanting more robust features were encouraged to upgrade to the \\"PRO\\" version, and were offered significant discounts over the standalone retail version. All of this rapidly established WinFax as the de facto fax software. By 1994 almost one hundred companies were bundling versions of WinFax in with their own product, including IBM, Compaq, AST Research, Gateway 2000, Intel and Hewlett-Packard. WinFax PRO 3.0 was launched in late 1992 for Windows 3.x machines.Bertolucci, Jeff. \\"WinFax Pro 3.0: Sophisticated Fax Software\\" PC World p.86 January 1993 This was followed by a version for Macintosh systems. The \\"Lite\\" version of WinFax 3.0 was bundled as OEM software by a number of fax-modem manufacturers, which was later be superseded by WinFax Lite 4.0 a couple of years later. The release of WinFax PRO 4.0 in March 1994 brought together a number of key features and technologies. It introduced an improved OCR engine, introduced improvements aimed specifically at mobile fax users, better on-screen fax viewing capabilities and a focus on consistency and usability of the interface. It also included for the first time the ability to integrate directly with popular new email products such as cc:Mail and Microsoft Mail. It was preceded by a Workgroup version of the same product, which allowed a number of users to share a single fax modem on a networked system. The stand-alone version of the product was also later bundled with a grayscale scanner, and sold as WinFax Scanner. The final Delrina-branded version of WinFax was WinFax PRO 7.0, which shipped in late 1995, the subsequent version 8.0 being a Symantec product. There was no intervening version 5.0 or 6.0, and the jump to version 7.0 was purely a marketing decision, based on keeping up with the suite of products in Microsoft Office which were then at the same number. It also reflected the development effort required to develop the first full 32-bit application version, designed to work with the Windows 95 operating system, which set it apart from its competition at the time. By the time WinFax PRO 7.0 was being sold from retail shelves, Delrina had been acquired by Symantec.  Multimedia products  The product box cover for the \\"Opus 'n Bill BrainSaver\\" screensaver product Screensavers were designed to ensure that there would be no phosphor burn-in of images left on a CRT-based screen. Delrina added sound and basic interactivity with its series of screensaver products, arguably qualifying it as an early form of multimedia. Under Delrina several of the already-licensed cartoons brought over from their acquisition of Amaze Inc. were further developed into screensaver applications. The \\"Opus 'n Bill Brain Saver\\", which would land the company in court for copyright violations, was launched in 1993. Subsequent screensavers include a licensed version based on the first Flintstone live-action movie, and \\"The Scott Adams Dilbert Screen Saver Collection\\" which came out in September 1994. = Echo Lake = The rustic virtual desktop environment for the \\"multimedia family album\\" software Echo Lake A notable multimedia software program produced by Delrina was Echo Lake, an early form of scrapbook software that came out in June 1995. During development it was touted internally as a \\"cross [of] Quark Xpress and Myst\\". It featured an immersive 3D environment where a user could manipulate objects within a virtual desktop in a virtual office and assemble video and audio clips along with images, and then send them as either a virtual book other users of the program could then access, or its content could be printed. It was an innovative product for its time, and ultimately was hampered by the inability of many users to easily input or playback their own multimedia content into a computer from that period.

It is one of the most important cities on the island, with a very active port and many ecotourism attractions. The city is also a centre of sugar production and industry. History Since the 18th century, the region was occupied by fishermen and people who came here to cut trees. When Toussaint L'Ouverture took the eastern part of the Hispaniola island in the name of France, he gave the order to create the town of Barahona in 1802 as part of the Ozama Department. After the Independence in 1844, Barahona was a military post of the Azua Province. In 1858, Barahona was elevated to the category of municipality. When the province was created in 1881, Barahona was made its head municipality.  Climate  Under the K√∂ppen climate classification, Barahona has a tropical savanna climate. Temperatures tend to remains steady throughout the year, with mean temperatures ranging from a low of in January to a high of in July. In terms of dry and wet seasons, Barahona has two distinctive wet seasons with a peak in precipitation from May to June followed by drought-like conditions in July and August (due to the Azores high being located in the central Atlantic, inhibiting the formation of clouds and rain) and another peak in precipitation from September to October. This precipitation pattern is due to the movement and the position of the Azores high throughout the year. The dry season mainly runs through December to April. Even in the drier months, precipitation can still occur with February receiving just under . Sunshine is abundant throughout the year, averaging over 3200 hours. Economy The German cargo Ship MS Vogelsberg loading of sugar - Santa Cruz de Barahona, 1959 The main economic activity of the province is agriculture; the main product in the municipality is a very good coffee (\\"Barahona Type Coffee\\"), grown in the mountains of Eastern Bahoruco. There are also some important industries, mainly to produce textiles to send to other countries, and sugar in the Ingenio Barahona (\\"Barahona Sugar Factory\\"). Transport Although Barahona does not have a highly developed transportation system, the city has a sea port, which receives many ferries from different points in the Caribbean, and an airport, which has been reactivated with many flights a week to Punta Cana via Santo Domingo. Authorities provided the airport with a fuel station park, allowing facilities to the airliners that could operate in the airport in the future. The airport is the well known Maria Montez International Airport located about 10 minutes from the city center. The port is located about 5 minutes away from the city center.

It is roughly 10 km x 3 km in dimension, with an area of 17.68 km¬≤, and, as of 2012, had a population of between 210 and 220 people. Legend says that the island was named by a 2nd-century king of Munster, Mogh Nuadat, in honour of his wife, Beara, the daughter of Heber M√≥r, King of Castile. History Early traces of human occupation include megalithic tombs and standing stones. The island was the property of the O'Sullivan Bere clan and remained so until the power of the Gaelic chieftains was finally broken in 1602. This period also saw the first military interest in the island when Sir George Carew ordered a road to be built across the island to transport the pro-English forces to the Siege of Dunboy. In December 1796, a French fleet entered Bantry Bay and Berehaven Harbour, led by General Hoche under the direction of Wolfe Tone, the leader of the United Irishmen. The French longboat which landed in Bere Island is now in the National Museum of Ireland. Adverse winds prevented the main force landing and eventually caused the fleet to disperse and return home. In August 1798, there was a further invasion attempt, at Killala in County Mayo, following the Irish Rebellion of that year. The result of these events was that the British authorities reviewed their defensive plans and in 1803, with the country once again at war with France, Lieutenant-Colonel William Twiss was sent to Ireland to draw up a plan of defence for the country. As part of this review he was directed to examine what security could be given to Bantry Bay. Rear-Admiral Sir Robert Calder, who commanded the naval squadron based in Castletownbere Port wrote to the Rt. Hon. William Wickham on 22 December 1803 to request protection for his victualers and store ships, which were to be based at the Berehaven anchorage to supply his squadron. Wickham agreed that protection for the ships was necessary and instructed William Cathcart, 1st Earl Cathcart to order his engineers to carry out works to build Martello Towers on the island. The Bere Island towers were reported as ready on 2 February 1805 and were therefore probably among the earliest Martello Towers to be completed in Ireland. The four, all circular in shape and built of rubble masonry, were sited to defend the anchorage between the mainland and the small harbour of Lawrence Cove on Bere Island. In addition to the Martello Towers, a signal tower, a barracks for 2 officers and 150 men, a quay and storehouses were also constructed. After the end of the Napoleonic Wars there followed a period of military stagnation. This ended in 1898 when the British military raised a compulsory purchase order on large areas of the island in order to construct additional fortifications in order to protect the British Fleet at anchor in Berehaven Harbour. During the Anglo-Irish War some Irish republicans were interned on Bere Island, including Canon William Kennedy, head (from 1919-1932) of St Flannan's College, Ennis. In 1922, under the terms of the Anglo-Irish Treaty that followed the Irish War of Independence, the British withdrew from most of Ireland but three deep water Treaty Ports, at Berehaven, Queenstown (renamed Cobh), and Lough Swilly, were retained as sovereign bases until 1938. View across Bere Island, with standing stone and Martello tower in the distance Archaeological and historic sites Evidence of more ancient settlement on the island include the remains of a circular enclosure (at Greenane), a hut site (Ardaragh West), a promontory fort, a ringfort (at Cloonaghlin West, Greenane), a collapsed wedge tomb (Ardaragh West), and standing stone (at Greenane). Ruins and remains relating to the island's military history include the remains of an artillery battery (Ardaragh West, Cloonaghlin West), Martello tower (Ardaragh West, Cloonaghlin West), a telegraph station, and a signal tower (at Derrycreeveen). Shipwrecks The wreckage of the Bardini Reefer lies just north of the island. It sank on the 12th of December 1982 after burning for several daysWrecksite.eu - Bardini Reefer Geography=Location Rerrin is the main village centre on the island The island is located between Berehaven Harbour and Bantry Bay in the western part of County Cork, about 1.5 km off the port of Castletownbere. It belongs to the civil parish of Killaconenagh (Cill Eacha Naoineach) in the barony of Bear. The highest point on the island is Knockanallig, at a height of 270 metres. The main harbour is Lawrence Cove, near the main village of Rerrin (Raerainn), toward the eastern end of the island. The church and its graveyard are located in Ballinakilla. Subdivisions  Ten of the 75 townlands of the civil parish of Killaconenagh are located on the island. These include Ardra West, Ardra East, Ballinakilla (with St Michael's Roman Catholic church and graveyard and nearby pub), Cloonaghlin West, Cloonaghlin Upper, Cloonaghlin Lower, Derrycreeveen, Greenane, Ardagh and Rerrin. Infrastructure=Transport Bere Island ferry The island is served by two ferries both of which can carry light vehicles. One sails between Castletownbere and the west of the Island while the other serves Pontoon (a pier about 2km east of Castletownbere along the R572) and Rerrin village During the COVID-19 pandemic in Ireland, in conjunction with other \\"isolation\\" efforts,https://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/ireland/bere-island-self- isolates-as-residents-ask-for-no-visitors-988523.html the island's ferry services were curtailed, with only residents permitted to board in order to prevent the virus from reaching the island. Energy Work started on providing mains electricity to the island via submarine cable in July 1957 and was completed in April 1958 Local radio A local radio stationIrish Examiner - Local radio keeping everyone connected on Beara peninsula broadcasts for a few hours on Sundays from a small transmitter on the island on 100.1MHz FM Demographics As of 2012, the population was approximately 200, but the past population was significantly higher. At the time of the 1841 census the population was 2,122. However, by the 1851 census the population had decreased to 1,454 due to the Great Famine. The population decline continued in line with the national trend for emigration throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. Unlike many of the other islands off the Irish coast, the inhabitants of Bere Island are native speakers of English. Irish was reported as being spoken by certain islanders in the 1911 census.http://www.census.nationalarchives.ie/reels/nai001826892/ See also * List of Irish military installations * List of townlands of the barony of Bear ReferencesExternal links * Bere Island information Category:Islands of County Cork Category:Beara peninsula ","title":"Bere Island"},{"id":"1874781","text":"This is an index of the characters of the novels, short stories and anime adaptations for Crest of the Stars, Banner of the Stars and Seikai no Dansh≈ç. In each entry, the first version of the name is from Tokyopop's licensed English translations of the manga and novels. In Bandai's licensed English version of the anime, the names are similar to Tokyopop's versions but not identical.  Main protagonists  ; : : Lafiel is a strong-willed Abh princess. She is from the Clyuve Royal Family, in itself a member of the Abriel Imperial Family. As a granddaughter of the current Abh Empress Ramaj, she is in the line of succession to the throne. Despite being a princess, she rarely acts like one and hates being treated as one. One of the reasons Lafiel befriends Jinto is because Jinto neither recognizes her as a princess nor treats her as one when they first meet. Their relationship is so close that she freely allows him to use her real name of Lafiel when addressing her, something that is very uncommon when addressing those of nobility or royalty. She acts much older than her age (at her introduction in Crest of the Stars, she is 16 years old) and can, in most cases, logically think her way out of a situation. However, her headstrong nature sometimes clouds her judgment and can lead her to become impulsive. She is a very good shot and although she sometimes doubts herself, she proves to be a worthy ship captain (deca- commander) in Banner of the Stars. She shows little emotion throughout Crest of the Stars, but as time goes by became a very close friend with Jinto through Banner of the Stars. This is especially true in later installments, where she more frequently questions how their friendship will last due to the relative shortness of Jinto's lifespan. ; : : Born Jinto Lin on planet Martine of the Hyde Star System, he is the son of Rock Lin, a politician who became president of the Hyde Star System. His mother was a mining engineer, who died in a mine accident soon after his birth. Because his father was busy with political activities, Jinto was brought up by his father's secretary, Teal Clint. When the Abh Empire invaded Hyde stellar system, his father surrendered the system in exchange for several concessions including selecting the territorial lord from amongst the people of Martine. As a result, Jinto rose to the ranks of Abh nobility along with his father. Growing up in a planet where he was considered the son of a traitor has not been easy for him. Even as he grew older, he would flinch at unfamiliar gestures. Jinto is eventually sent to the Planet Delktou to learn Baronh and Abh culture from Imperial citizens. Approximately seven years later, he leaves Delktou for a military college in Lakfakalle, the capital of the Abh Empire, to continue his education. It is in the spaceport of Delktou that he meets Lafiel who served as his escort and shuttle pilot from the spaceport to the patrolship Gosroth. The novels, and the anime, are a chronicle of the evolving personalities of the two, and their changing relationship with each other. He signs his name \\"Jint Linn\\".  Abh  ; Rock Lin : Jinto's father. His formal name in Baronh was Linn ssynec Rocr Dreuc Ha√Øder Roch. He was the head of government of the Hyde stellar system (Ha√Ødec in Baronh) during the invasion of the Abh Empire. Believing his own ideas more valuable than the rights of the people of Martine, Rock Lin decides to surrender the stellar system but stipulated that the territorial lord of Hyde should be chosen from amongst the people of Martine. The leader of the invading forces agreed to this however this meant that an election could not be held making Rock, as the current leader of Martine, the natural choice to become its territorial lord. Because of the size of his domain, he is accepted into the Abh aristocracy as a great lord and conferred with the princely rank of Dreuc, equivalent to Count. His actions were interpreted by the people of Martine as treason. After the Four Nations Alliance took the planet from the Abh Empire, he was executed by the Hyde parliament despite the best efforts of his old friend Teal Clint, the new President. ; Abriel Nei Lamsar Larth Balkei Dusanyu : The current Dusanyu, or Crown Prince, of the Abh Empire of Mankind, the Baronh name of which is Frybar Gloer Gor Bari (Frybarec Gloer Gor Bari), Also the Commander-in-Chief of the Abh Armed Forces, who personally led the invasion of the Hyde star system. ; Lexshue Wef-Robell Plakia : The captain of the Gosroth, she is every bit as smart, beautiful, dedicated and stubborn as Lafiel, but older and wiser. Judging from her name, Lexshue's rank in the Abh social hierarchy is that of a reucec (knight or dame). She is allegedly Lafiel's mother, according to Lafiel herself. ; Abriel Nei Debrusc Larth Kryb Debeus : Lafiel's father, the King of Kryv and a son of the current reigning empress. He is somewhat impulsive and curious and is not above practical jokes. He once pranked his daughter into believing that half of her genes came from their pet cat. ; Abriel Nei Debrusc Duhiel : Lafiel's younger brother, who is fifteen and in his first year at the Kenle. He was raised in the capital by his father and shown to feel inferior to his sister, who was already a Bene Rodail (officer-in-training) at his age. ; Atosryua Syun-Atos Lyuf Febdash Klowal : The third Baron of Febdash, an obscure star system where Jinto and Lafiel made a stopover en route to Safugnoff (Sfagnaumh). He had an inferiority complex due to his clan's origins and brief history, causing him to confine and isolate his own father. He tried to abduct Lafiel and imprison Jinto, which brought dire consequences onto himself. ; Atosryua Syun-Atos Lyuf Raika Febdash Srguf : The second Baron of Febdash and father of Klowal and Lo√Øc. Srguf's mother was the first Baroness, who gained distinction by rising through the Imperial Star Force, or Labule (Laburec). Due to his being a genetic \\"grounder,\\" his own son despised him resulting in confinement and isolation. He eventually befriended Jinto and aided Lafiel in \\"punishing\\" Klowal. His daughter, Lo√Øc eventually became the Baroness of Febdash and a commanding officer to Lafiel and Jinto. ; Atosryac Syun-Atos Lyuf Febdash Klowal Lo√Øc : The fourth Baron of Febdash, Lo√Øc served the Star Forces and attained the rank of Hecto-Commander, in command of a squadron of assault ships that included Lafiel's. Unlike her brother Klowal she had no desire to be in character of their family's territory and was unhappy to receive the duty. She got along well with her father and held no ill-will towards grounders unlike her brother, nor did she hold a grudge to Jinto and Lafiel for their role in what happened to Klowal, recognizing the events as a result of his actions. Lo√Øc got along well and was respected by her subordinates, though she had some hesitance in contacting Lafiel on non- military matters due to her high noble rank, preferring to go through Jinto instead, and was a highly able commander. ; Abriel Nei Debrusc Spunej Ramaj : The current reigning empress of the Abh Empire, she is also Lafiel's grandmother. She also holds the title \\"Dreuc Abl√Øarser\\" (Countess of Abl√Øarsec; Abl√Øarsec is also the name of the stellar system where Lakfakalle (Lacmhacarh), the imperial capital, is located). All interstellar ships belong to the crown which are then leased out to the merchants of the empire. ; Trife Boli Yuvdale Remsale : Despite verging on excessive caution, he is nonetheless one of the most able tacticians in the Labule. He puts every aspect and factor under consideration, frequently asking his subordinates' opinions and assessments before starting an operation. He is also one of the least loved officers. ; Spoor Aron Sekpadao Letopanyu Peneju : This red-eyed officer from the Spoor clan is one of the most eccentric in the Labule, which does not change the fact that she is one of its most able admirals. Though complaining of boredom most of the time, she suddenly springs into action when needed. One of her favorite pastimes is mercilessly teasing Kaselia, her chief of staff. The Spoor family prides itself of being a close kin to the Abriel Imperial Family and the Spoor family consists of over five hundred titled members. As the Grand Duchess, she is heir to the Spoor legacy. ; Kufadis : Spoor's lieutenant, who tries to restrain some of the more whimsical actions of his commanding officer. He is generally seen secretly moaning and groaning over his lot as Spoor's subordinate. ; Aicryac √ú√©mh Tlyzr Naurh : Basrogrh (Basroil) pilot who shows an interest in Jinto. ; : Basrogrh first navigator ;Samsonn Borgh Tiruser Tirusec : Basrogrh mechanic, a non-genetic Abh like Jinto who eventually becomes his first vassal.  \\"Terrestrials\\"/Four Nations Alliance  ; Teal Clint : Rock Linn's best friend and clerk before the Abh invasion of the Hyde star system. He also became Jinto's foster father after Jinto's mother died and Rock Linn became too busy in politics to raise his own son. After Rock Linn's act of \\"high treason,\\" Teal Clint became head of the anti-Abh resistance. When the Four Nations Alliance of the United Mankind and its allies helped the Hyde star system free itself from the Abh Empire, Teal Clint became the new President and reluctantly executed Rock Linn. ; Dorin Ku : One of Jinto's friends during his early education on the planet Delktou. He was a fan of the game \\"minchiu\\" (minteau), a cross between soccer and roller derby, and played on the same local team as Jinto. He was the only person who came to say goodbye at the spaceport when Jinto was departing for the military academy at Lakfakalle. ; Seelnay : A vassal of the Barony of Febdash who helped Jinto and Lafiel to escape from the clutches of Klowal. She later started her own ship-repair business with other former Febdash vassals. ; Inspector Entryua : Chief of the Police Department of Lune Biga, a city on Planet Clasbul in the Sufugnoff star system. He was forced to cooperate with the invading forces of the United Mankind to search for Jinto and Lafiel. ; Lt. Kyte : An Alliance military police officer from the United Mankind who led the search for Jinto and Lafiel in Sufugnoff. He belonged to the Silejia people who practiced genetic anti-aging manipulation before their annexation by the United Mankind; despite looking like a young man in his twenties, he is in reality around fifty years old. Because the United Mankind bans genetic manipulation, he is therefore much despised by most citizens of the United Mankind and is prevented from rising amongst the ranks of the military. This is one of the causes of his bitter hatred against the Abhs. He forced Entryua to accompany him and use local police resources in seeking for the Abh pair. ; Marca : The head of an underground anti-empirialist (though not necessarily \\"anti-Abh\\") group of Clasbul seeking independence to run their own shipping, transportation, and trade. She acts as a hotel chambermaid and tries to kidnap Jinto and Lafiel to attain her group's goals. Eventually she helps the pair to flee Sufugnoff and escape the clutches of the United Mankind. For her assistance, as well as the legal requirement for ship owners to be ranking Abh nobles, she is raised to the rank of an Abh dame/equestrian (reucec). ; Min Kulsup : A member of Marca's anti-imperialist group. He is also a previous member of the Independence Party which he left three years prior to the occupation of United Mankind. He is skillful in the production of arms a lot of which were alleged to have been found in his villa. Because of his history and line of work, he is suspected of possibly aiding the empire. Like Marca, he too became an Abh knight/equestrian at the end of Seikai no Monsh≈ç with the rest of Marca's group. ; \\"The Undertaker\\" : The owner of the Clasbul funeral facility which was used to send Jinto and Lafiel back to space. His favorite story is about a guy who jumped unto thorn bushes. He too became an Abh knight/equestrian as a reward for aiding their escape. ; Daswani : A big and silent man who is a member of Marca's anti-empirialist group. He too became an Abh knight/equestrian at the end of Seikai no Monsh≈ç with the rest of Marca's group. ; Bill : Nicknamed \\"the Speeder,\\" he is another member of Marcas's anti-empirialist group. He too became an Abh knight/equestrian at the end of Seikai no Monsh≈ç with the rest of Marca's group.

A remake of the game, retitled Cosmic Spacehead, was released in 1993 for Amiga, MS-DOS, Sega Game Gear, Master System, and Genesis. The game features adventure elements, with locations connected by platform sections. The game is the sequel to Linus Spacehead, which was released exclusively as part of the compilation Quattro Adventure.  Plot  Linus is an alien from the planet Linoleum who crashed into the legendary planet Earth. After returning home and expecting a hero's welcome, Linus soon found his fellow Linomen were skeptical of the existence of the so-called \\"planet Earth\\" and decides to return to it, this time with a camera. However, he has no money (Linoleum currency is the Linobuck), and must adventure around the planet to acquire a vehicle and a camera. In his adventures, Linus leaves Linoleum (using a fake ID for Larry Flynt to compete in a bumper car contest), quashes a robot revolution in Detroitica and gets gas from an abandoned space station.  Gameplay  The game is similar to prior titles such as Maniac Mansion (1987) and later titles such as Day of the Tentacle (1993), being an adventure game in which items must be collected and later used in specific locations in order to progress. The player's character is directed during much of the game with the use of a cursor and written commands. It also includes numerous short platforming sections, as well as other mini-games and puzzles. Each major location of Planet Linoleum has a teleporting device, which can be activated using a card. However, they often leave Linus with a side-effect, required to complete a puzzle. To travel between adventure sections, Linus goes through arcade sections, where he has to reach the other side of the level, avoiding free falls, enemies and collecting Cosmic candy at the same time (after collecting 10, an extra life is added). Linus dies upon contact with enemies, so instead of speed-running (which can be done, since the levels are small), it may be more advisable to learn his foes' movement patterns and wait for a safe opening. This is particularly true in NES Linus Spacehead's Cosmic Crusade, where Linus cannot change direction in mid-jump. Passwords are scattered at key locations.  Licensing  Like other Codemasters games, the NES versions were not licensed by Nintendo. Linus Spacehead's Cosmic Crusade was released both as a stand-alone cartridge and as one of seven games for the Aladdin Deck Enhancer. At least in Europe, a later/updated version of the game was released as Cosmic Spacehead. There are several differences between that and the earlier version. Cosmic Spacehead includes the Pie Slap mode, and Linus can jump higher and change direction in mid-jump, which makes the platform arcade sections easier. The Mega Drive version was also included in a Codemasters \\"2-in-1\\" cartridge with Fantastic Dizzy. All but Linus Spacehead's Cosmic Crusade include a two player mode named Pie Slap, reminiscent of Armor Ambush for the Atari 2600. While the Master System version is similar in graphics to the NES version, the gameplay is closer to the remaining versions. In the Amiga, Mega Drive and MS-DOS versions, the art style is different from the NES version. Reception GamePro described the Game Gear version as \\"a great point-and-click text adventure\\", additionally praising the cartoonish charm of the graphics.

Over each cycle a volume is created in contact with the chamber where pressure is to be lowered. By random motion, molecules from the vacuum chamber pass into the volume created by the pump. This volume is then cut off from the chamber and compressed in contact with a one way valve. If the volume is compressed enough some of the molecules will pass through the valve. Performance The maximum efficiency of a rotary compression pump is the ratio between the volume in contact with the vacuum and the smallest contracted volume in contact with the valve. If the ratio is 1:1000 and the pump is exhausting to atmospheric pressure, the highest achievable vacuum is 1/1000 of atmospheric pressure. This corresponds to 0.76 Torr or 101.3 Pa. This limitation makes rotary compression pumps very hard to construct if lower pressures than about 1 Torr is to be achieved.

He is generally considered to be one of the top flankers of the professional era (post-1995) of rugby union.  Career  Born in Kumba, Cameroon, of partial Bamileke heritage, Betsen moved to France with his mother and six siblings when he was nine, settling in the Clichy suburb of Paris. He played his first competitive rugby for the local Clichy based Club Sportif before joining the southern giants Biarritz when he was just 17. Betsen made his first appearance for France aged 23 in 1997, as a replacement against , but did not receive his second call-up until the 2000 Six Nations Championship. Thereafter he became a regular starter in the national team. Nicknamed la Faucheuse (the Grim Reaper), Betsen was regarded as one of the fiercest tacklers in the game, and was also renowned for his high work-rate on the field. Betsen's finest moment came during the 2002 Six Nations Championship, in the match against , when his relentless man-marking of Jonny Wilkinson eventually resulted in the fly-half's replacement and paved the way for a 20‚Äì15 victory. Later, England's coach, Clive Woodward, said of Betsen: \\"‚ÄúHe is the only player that I can say was the single-handed reason we lost a match.\\" France went on to win the Grand Slam and Betsen was named France's International Player of the Year. He was an automatic selection for the 2003 Rugby World Cup and scored France's only try in the semi-final loss to England. In 2005 he was cited following an incident during Biarritz's Heineken Cup match against London Wasps in which Wasps centre Stuart Abbott suffered a broken leg; the complaint was dismissed after a disciplinary hearing found that \\"the trip, while intentional, was not premeditated\\" and had happened \\"in the heat of the moment\\". Betsen was renowned as a fearless tackler, but with increasing age he started to pick up more frequent injuries and he missed the 2005 Autumn internationals after fracturing his cheekbone in a match against Toulouse. Despite this, he continued to be a formidable tackler: in the 2007 Six Nations Championship, which France won, he completed 56 tackles, 12 more than any other player in the tournament. Toward the end of the 2005 season, Betsen held talks with English club Leicester Tigers about a possible move from France, but in the end he decided to stay at Biarritz and signed a new three-year contract. On 16 January 2008 Betsen announced that he was retiring from international rugby with immediate effect. On 11 May 2008, it was revealed he was signing for London Wasps. Betsen made a good start with Wasps performing well and earning respect from the Wasps supporters, for the A side whilst recovering from injury, before moving into the first XV. During the 2009 6 Nations championship he was made Wasps captain in the absence of the senior England players and friend Rafa Ibanez (though retirement caused by injury). The club announced that he would share the captaincy for the remainder of the 2008/09 season with Phil Vickery, and he put in excellent performances as captain, being awarded two man of the match awards in quick succession. Betsen left London Wasps in June 2011 and announced his retirement from rugby at his \\"Jubilee\\" game in Biarritz on 6 June 2012. Betsen signed with London Scottish as defence coach for the 2012‚Äì2013 season. Betsen is a member of the 'Champions for Peace' club, a group of more than 90 famous elite created by Peace and Sport, a Monaco-based international organization placed under the High Patronage of H.S.H Prince Albert II. This group of top level champions, wish to make sport a tool for dialogue and social cohesion.http://www.peace-sport.org/our-champions-of-peace/ He also created the Serge Betsen Academy in 2004. This charity aims to help underprivileged children in Cameroon, his native country. On top of introducing this children to Rugby, the charity supports the children's education and access to basic healthcare. In 2013, he created another charity, the French Legends, which reunites former rugby internationals and professionals in order to participate in charity matches and events to support other charities. In 2008, he started Serge Betsen Consulting and in 2015, he created Serge Betsen Rugby, a multisport coaching programme for the French schools of London.

First introduced in the 1950s, it is primarily effective for tremors such as those associated with Parkinson's disease, where a selected portion of the thalamus is surgically destroyed (ablated). Neurosurgeons use specialized equipment to precisely locate an area of the thalamus, usually choosing to work on only one side (the side opposite that of the worst tremors). Bilateral procedures are poorly tolerated because of increased complications and risk, including vision and speech problems. The positive effects on tremors are immediate. Other less destructive procedures are sometimes preferred, such as subthalamic deep brain stimulation, since this procedure can also improve tremors and other symptoms of PD. Indications Thalamotomy is a complex procedure performed by specialists of brain or neurosurgeons. It is mostly indicated in cases of stroke, damage to third ventricle of brain, brain hemorrhage, accidents leading to head injury, oedema around thalamus, subdural hemorrhage, and cerebrovascular accident. There is also some evidence in thalamocortical dysrhythmia. Subthalamotomy Subthalamotomy is a type of brain surgery in which the subthalamic nucleus is destroyed in attempt to help alleviate movement disorders often associated with Parkinson‚Äôs disease (PD).Sub- thalamotomy. National Parkinson Foundation. Retrieved from This surgery has been most widely researched at Cuba‚Äôs International Center for Neurological Restoration located in Havana. This center has assumed a leading role in developing a surgical procedure that provides significant relief for patients experiencing the slowness of movement, tremor, and muscle rigidity in middle to late stages of PD. Similar to the thalamotomy, this procedure can be repeated on both sides of the brain bilaterally, but is not recommended due to a large increase in the risk of speech and cognitive problems after surgery.Stix, Gary. (2003). Sustainable Surgery. Scientific American. Retrieved from http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=sustainable- surgery The aim of subthalamotomies is to reduce symptoms of PD and the uncontrolled movements that can occur in patients taking the drug levodopa for a long time.Subthalamotomy. BootsWebMD. Retrieved from http://www.webmd.boots.com/a-to-z-guides/parkinsons-disease-subthalamotomy Surgical procedures Frame for stereotactic thalamotomy on display at the Glenside Museum Thalamotomy can be performed in an invasive or noninvasive manner. If performed invasively, then prior to the operation, a neurosurgeon uses stereotactic technology to identify the exact part of the brain that needs treatment by putting in place a frame on the patient‚Äôs head with four pins to keep it still. The doctor then takes a detailed brain scan using computed tomography (CT scan) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to identify the precise location for operation, as well as a path through the brain to get to that specific spot. During the surgery, the patient is awake, but the area on the scalp where the surgical tools are inserted is numbed with an anesthetic. The surgeon makes a scalp incision (about 2 inches long), then inserts a hollow probe through a small hole drilled in the skull to the specific location. Different methods can be used to kill the brain cells, including circulating liquid nitrogen inside the probe, destroying the targeted brain tissue, or by inserting an electrode heated to near to denature the cells. Although the surgery usually requires only about a two-day hospital stay, full recovery generally takes about six weeks. Thalamotomy can be performed without incisions using ultrasound waves. The ultrasound waves are focused to the thalamus, thus cause thalamotomy through an intact skull. This procedure uses MRI guidance to localize the thalamus. The ultrasound waves cause gradual warming of the tissue until ablation occurs, seen clinically as resolution of tremor. During the procedure, the patient is awake. Thus, if any adverse effects are noted, the area of the thalamus that is treated can be adjusted before ablation. Favorable responses have so far been reported in PD patients and essential tremor patients. Complications Some of the patients in Cuban studies developed complications from the surgery, including severe involuntary movements, but the symptoms abated (to the point where patients could tolerate them) after three to six months. Most common complications include a risk of stroke, confusion, and speech and/or visual problems. Although risks exist with unilateral subthalamotomy, they are greatly increased with bilateral subthalamotomy. Studies One study followed 89 patients with PD who were treated with unilateral subthalamotomy. Sixty-eight patients were available for evaluations after 12 months, 36 after 24 months, and 25 after 36 months. The Unified Parkinson‚Äôs Disease Rating Scale motor scores improved significantly and levodopa daily doses were significantly reduced by 45, 36, and 28% at 12, 24 and 36 months after surgery. Unilateral subthalamotomy was associated with significant motor benefit contralateral to the lesion. Further work is needed to ascertain what factors led to severe, persistent chorea-ballism in a subset of patients. In an earlier study, 18 advanced PD patients received staged or simultaneous bilateral one or more subthalamotomy. One patient subsequently developed multiple system atrophy signs and was excluded from further analysis. Motor improvements compared to baseline were 58% in the off state and 63% in the on state. Daily levodopa dose was reduced by a mean of 72%, with five patients receiving none. Three patients developed severe chorea postoperatively, which improved spontaneously at 3‚Äì6 months. In a third study, microelectrode mapping (guided stereotactic surgery on the subthalamic nucleus) was performed in eight patients with PD, and the findings indicated that subthalamotomy can ameliorate the cardinal symptoms of PD, reduce the dosage of levodopa, diminish complications of the drug therapy, and improve the quality of life. Havana‚Äôs International Center for Neurological Restoration reported at the American Neurological Association meeting in October 2002 that two years after undergoing a bilateral dorsal subthalamotomy, 17 Cuban patients improved by an average of 50% on movement tests, and they could dramatically reduce their daily ingestion of levodopa. Subthalamotomy could be a preferred option for people with PD who have trouble affording either the medication or deep-brain stimulation needed to moderate symptoms.

The official naming by Intel is ¬µFCPGA and ¬µPGA479M. There exist multiple electrically incompatible, but mechanically compatible processor families that are available in PGA packages using this socket or variants thereof: * Socket 478 for Pentium 4 and Celeron series desktop CPUs; * Socket 479 for Pentium III-M (released in 2001); * Socket 479 for Pentium M and Celeron M 3xx (this was the most common version of the socket, and was released in 2003); * Socket M for Intel Core, Core 2 and Celeron M 4xx and 5xx processors; and * Socket P for Core 2 processors. Even the Intel's CPU specifications seem to be not clear enough on the distinction and instead use the package/socket designations PGA478 or PPGA478 for more than 1 of the above sockets. Perhaps adding yet more confusion, some of the PGA-based CPUs above are also available in a BGA (or more precisely, ¬µBGA or even ¬µFCBGA) package which has all of the 479 contacts (balls) populated. For these CPU variants, the Intel's CPU specifications use the designations BGA479, PBGA479 or H-PBGA479. It should be however pointed out that these designations denote rather the CPU package itself and not the socket, which the BGA variants do not use at all (they are intended to be directly soldered to the mainboard, e.g. in an embedded system). The non-BGA counterparts of these CPUs use any one of the above mentioned sockets, not only the Socket 479. Technical specifications An Asus CT-479 adapter CT-479 installed on ASUS P4GPL-X motherboard Socket 479 has 479 pin holes. Pentium M processors in PGA package have 479 pins that plug into this zero insertion force socket. Only 478 pins are electrically connected (B2 is reserved and \\"depopulated on the Micro-FCPGA package\\"). Although electrically and mechanically similar, Socket 478 has one pin less, making it impossible to use a Pentium M processor in a 478 board. For this reason manufacturers like Asus have made drop-in boards (e.g. CT-479) which allow use of Socket 479 processors. Chipsets which employ this socket for the Pentium M are the Intel 855GM/GME/PM, the Intel 915GM/GMS/PM and the VIA family of chipsets such as the VN800. While the Intel 855GME chipset supports all Pentium M CPU's, the Intel 855GM chipset does not officially support 90 nm 2MB L2 cache (Dothan core) models (even though it works, it only works at 400FSB, some 3rd party/user was able to overclock the FSB on 855GM/GME/PM to support 533FSB Dothan Core). The other difference is the 855GM chipset graphics core runs at 200 MHz while the 855GME runs at 250 MHz. In 2006, Intel released the successor to Socket 479 with a revised pinout for its Core processor, called Socket M. This socket has the placement of one pin changed from the Pentium M version of Socket 479; Socket M processors will physically fit into a Socket 479, but are electrically incompatible with most versions of the socket479(except using ATI north bridge RC415MD) . Socket M supports a 667 MT/s FSB with the Intel 945PM/945GM chipsets.

A member of The Fabulous Freebirds, Garvin is best known for his appearances with promotions including the American Wrestling Association, World Class Championship Wrestling, and World Championship Wrestling. Early life Williams grew up in Tampa, Florida, where he was an amateur wrestler. Professional wrestling career=Early career (1968-1983) Garvin began his wrestling career in November 1968 at the age of 16 as \\"Beau James\\". He soon took the name \\"Gorgeous\\" Jimmy Garvin and was given two \\"brothers\\", Terry and Ron Garvin, whom he briefly managed. He toured the Mid-South and Florida territories from 1978 until 1983. In 1982, Garvin (while holding the NWA Florida Global Tag Team Championship with Big John Studd) won the NWA Southern Heavyweight Championship from Sweet Brown Sugar. As a reward, Garvin's manager, J.J. Dillon, presented him with a valet named Precious.Top 100 Women Of Wrestling - \\"Precious I\\" entry, Pro Wrestling Illustrated Women of Wrestling special, 2002, p16 The original Precious was not the same woman as Garvin's wife, Patti Williams, who would later assume the name Sunshine II then \\"Precious\\". During his title defenses, Garvin often became distracted by Precious and flaunted his good looks to impress her. This would cause his opponents to recover and attack him. Due to her quiet-but-distracting nature, Garvin quickly lost the NWA Southern Heavyweight Championship to Dusty Rhodes, while he and Studd lost the NWA Florida Global Tag Team Championship to Ron Bass and Barry Windham. Garvin then replaced the original Precious (whom he later claimed in a shoot interview with Wrestling Perspective had been causing problems outside the ring with his marriage to Patti) with his cousin, Sunshine, and joined World Class Championship Wrestling in 1983. World Class Championship Wrestling (1983-1984) Along with his valet Sunshine, Garvin competed in WCCW as a heel, refusing to wrestle on live TV before he started a feud with beloved David Von Erich, which he lost and ended up spending a day with Sunshine on David's ranch, doing ranch type duties such as washing the five dogs owned by David (as he relaxed and shot skeet right over Jimmy and Sunshine's heads) and relocating several bales of hay without the use of a truck. However, towards the end of the day, Garvin drew the line at cleaning out the old horse barn and the two went at it. He next moved on to feud with Chris Adams. Around this time, he introduced his wife, Patti, as \\"Sunshine II\\", who was supposed to work as an assistant to the original Sunshine. After the interference of Sunshine II cost Garvin to lose the WCCW Television Championship to Johnny Mantell in October 1983, Sunshine II blamed the original Sunshine for the botch. Garvin then fired the original Sunshine and renamed Sunshine II as \\"Precious\\" (not to be confused with his original valet of the same name). Precious and Sunshine (now aligned with Chris Adams) feuded while Garvin traded the NWA American Heavyweight Championship with Adams. During this time, the couples competed in mixed tag-team matches. Sunshine temporarily left WCCW in 1984 (with the storyline excuse that she had been injured by Garvin and Precious) and was replaced in the feud with her \\"truck driving aunt\\", Stella Mae French (Tanya West). Adams and Stella Mae continued to compete in mixed tag team matches against Garvin and Precious until they defeated them in a \\"Loser Leaves Town\\" cage match in July 1984. Garvin and Precious then left World Class for the American Wrestling Association. Garvin and Adams would revive their feud ten years later in the Global Wrestling Federation, but the promotion went out of business before that angle got off the ground. American Wrestling Association (1984-1986) In the AWA, he formed a tag team with \\"Mr. Electricity\\" Steve Regal (not to be confused with WWE wrestler William Regal, who performed in WCW as \\"Lord\\" Steven Regal and previously as Steve Regal, having seen the name in American wrestling magazines) and they won the World Tag Team Titles from The Road Warriors with the help of the Fabulous Freebirds.  Jim Crockett Promotions/World Championship Wrestling (1986‚Äì1992) Feuds with Wahoo McDaniel, Brad Armstrong and Magnum T.A. (1986-1987) = After losing the titles to Scott Hall and Curt Hennig in 1986 in Albuquerque, New Mexico, he went to the NWA's Jim Crockett Promotions. He debuted as a heel often taunting Wahoo McDaniel, calling him \\"Yahoo.\\" Garvin and McDaniel would feud throughout the summer and fall of 1986 in a series of \\"Indian Strap\\" matches. He also feuded with Brad Armstrong and was in the middle of a feud with Magnum T.A. when Magnum had the car wreck that would end his career. = Feuds with The Midnight Express, Ric Flair, and Kevin Sullivan (1987-1988) = In 1987, Jimmy's \\"brother\\" Ron (Jimmy's real-life stepfather), was in a feud with Jim Cornette and his stable. During a match with Cornette's Midnight Express, Cornette threw fire in Ron's face. Several faces came out to help and then Jimmy ran out and helped take him to the back. Jimmy flew into a rage and stormed into the heel dressing room and brutally attacked Cornette and it took several wrestlers, heel and face, to pull him off of him. Jimmy and Ron's friend and partner Barry Windham then took Ron to the hospital. Jimmy (and, by association, Precious) turned face and helped Ron feud with the Midnight Express. One of the bigger matches during that feud was when the two teams were matched against each other during the 1987 Jim Crockett Memorial Cup tag team tournament. The Midnight Express won by countout to advance. Later that year, Jimmy had one of the most memorable feuds in his career with Ric Flair, who was eyeing Precious. He sent her gifts and this provided a dramatic buildup for a big cage match between Flair and Jimmy during the 1987 Great American Bash stop in Greensboro, North Carolina for Flair's NWA World Title. The stipulation was added that if Flair won the match, he would get a date with Precious. During the match, Jimmy attempted a leap frog at one point but landed on one knee instead of his feet. Pain in the knee was \\"sold\\" by him during the rest of the match. This match got so heated that a fan actually attempted to climb into the cage to help Garvin. The fan was stopped by David Crockett, who was calling the match along with Tony Schiavone, right before the fan was about to get in. Flair ended up winning the match when he put Jimmy in the figure four leglock, Jimmy blacked out from the pain in his knee and his shoulders hit the mat for a count of three. Ron Garvin then entered the cage when the match was over and attacked Flair in order to defend Jimmy from further damage to his knee. When the date with Precious that Flair won occurred, Flair and James J. Dillon ended up being punched out by Ron Garvin, who was dressed in his \\"Miss Atlanta Lively\\" outfit. Just two months later, Ron successfully unseated Flair as NWA World Champion, holding on to the title until Starrcade '87 when Flair regained the belt. In 1988, Garvin had a feud with Kevin Sullivan and his Varsity Club. This one was over Precious too but it was never made clear why Sullivan wanted her. He made references to her calling her \\"Patti\\" instead of Precious, possibly referring to the past somehow. Sullivan would stalk her and taunt her with papers in his robe, but they never revealed anything. Jimmy had some memorable matches during this feud including challenging Varsity Club member Mike Rotunda for the NWA World TV Title at Clash of the Champions I event during March of that year. Rotunda pinned Jimmy to retain the title. During the 1988 Great American Bash in Baltimore, Maryland held in July, Jimmy and Sullivan each captained 5 men teams opposing each other in the first ever \\"Tower of Doom\\" match. This match was actually a copied idea from World Class Championship Wrestling based out of Dallas, Texas who held a similar match a short while before this. It involved three cages stacked up on top of each other. A member of each team would start out climbing a ladder and facing off in the top cage. Every few minutes, new members from each team would enter the top cage in a similar fashion. Every so often, the doors between the cages would open for ten seconds allowing wrestlers to slip through to the next level. Jimmy's teammates consisted of Ron Garvin, Steve Williams, and the Road Warriors. They were victorious over Sullivan's team but the feud between Jimmy and Sullivan was not quite yet over. In September 1988, Garvin left to sell a broken leg that he had gotten from Sullivan and Mike Rotunda. On the September 3 edition of NWA World Championship Wrestling from the TBS studios, Sullivan broke cement blocks over Jimmy's leg. Jim Ross commentating at the time yelled out \\"He's breaking blocks all over his leg! Jesus!\\" = The Fabulous Freebirds (1989-1992, 1994) = Garvin returned to Jim Crockett Promotions, now known as World Championship Wrestling, in June 1989 minus Precious and became the newest member of the Fabulous Freebirds (he had been associated with the Freebirds since 1983) by winning the World Tag Team Titles with Michael Hayes at Clash of the Champions VII. The titles were won as part of a tournament for them that had been ongoing. That night, Hayes and Garvin scored victories over the Dynamic Dudes in the semifinals and the Midnight Express (Bobby Eaton & Stan Lane) in the finals. They feuded with the Midnight Express some more following that, as well as Rick & Scott Steiner. Garvin had worked in the past with Hayes, Buddy Roberts and Terry Gordy during the height of the Freebird- Von Erichs feud in World Class, and was always considered \\"The fourth Freebird\\". In the fall of 1990, they also had a manager of sorts, \\"Little Richard Marley\\" (wrestler Rocky King), who lasted until Starrcade. In February 1991, they added two managers, Big Daddy Dink & Diamond Dallas Page. In May 1991, they added a masked Freebird, Badstreet, and they feuded with The Young Pistols (Steve Armstrong & Tracy Smothers). By the summer of 1991, Badstreet and their managers were gone and the Freebirds had no direction. They briefly added Precious as their manager but she only made one appearance at WrestleWar '92. During this period, Hayes and Garvin won 2 World Tag Team titles, 1 World Six-Man Tag Team title (with Badstreet), and 2 United States Tag Team titles. Following the arrival of Bill Watts as Executive Vice President of WCW the Freebirds were targeted for what would become a wave of budget cuts. Following a loss of the United States tag-team titles to Dick Slater and The Barbarian, Garvin was split from Hayes. He wrestled The Barbarian in singles matches in August 1992 and also began teaming with Tom Zenk. His final match with the company came on the October 10th episode of The Power Hour when he partnered with Zenk to face Butch Reed and The Barbarian. World Wrestling Federation (1992) After leaving WCW in September 1992, Garvin received a tryout with the World Wrestling Federation. Garvin conducted an unaired interview segment at a television taping on October 26, 1992 in Springfield, Illinois where he insulted The Ultimate Maniacs (a team composed of The Ultimate Warrior and \\"Macho Man\\" Randy Savage) and predicted that all of the heels would win at the 1992 Survivor Series. Garvin did not sign with the company, and afterwards took a hiatus from pro wrestling, learning to become a commercial airline pilot. World Championship Wrestling (1994) In February 1994, Garvin made one final appearance in WCW at SuperBrawl IV in place of the \\"injured\\" Michael Hayes in a losing effort to Hayes' scheduled opponent Johnny B. Badd. Global Wrestling Federation (1994) After SuperBrawl IV, Garvin went to the Global Wrestling Federation (GWF), where he reformed the Freebirds with Terry Gordy and Hayes. He won the Tag Team Titles with Gordy in 1994. They were the last champions before the promotion folded in September 1994 and he retired shortly thereafter. Before the promotion folded, Garvin was scheduled to feud with Chris Adams over the GWF North American Heavyweight Championship. Retirement Garvin is prominently featured in The Triumph and Tragedy of World Class Championship Wrestling DVD released by World Wrestling Entertainment in late 2007. The DVD was composed of interviews with former WCCW stars as well as footage and matches from various WCCW broadcasts. Garvin also appeared on an installment of \\"Legends\\" on WWE Classics on Demand discussing managers. Garvin spoke on a number of subjects, including the often contentious relationship between Sunshine, Precious and Missy Hyatt, as well as his own experiences as a manager. On April 2, 2016, Garvin was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame as part of The Fabulous Freebirds. Personal life Married in 1972, Williams and his wife Patti (born January 1, 1955), better known as Precious, have two daughters and they are involved in a ministry for the poor and homeless. Garvin's stepfather is professional wrestler Ron Garvin. Since his retirement from professional wrestling, Garvin has become an Airline Transport Pilot.

The Power are a Class-A affiliate of the Seattle Mariners. It also has been used by the baseball programs of West Virginia University, Marshall University, and the University of Charleston. The stadium, which opened in April 2005, is located in the East End of Charleston, West Virginia. It seats 4,500 fans and cost $25 million to build. The dimensions of the field are as follows: left field - 330 feet, center field - 400 feet, right field - 320 feet. History Additionally, the park hosts the West Virginia state high school baseball championships. From 2006-2018, it was the home field for Marshall's Conference USA games, as Marshall did not have an adequate baseball facility on its campus located 50 miles (80 km) away in Huntington. For the 2019 season, temporary upgrades allowed the school to play most games at home, excepting games versus West Virginia and Virginia Tech, which generally draw a larger crowd than the Huntington facility can accommodate. The school is fundraising for a baseball facility on campus. When West Virginia University moved from the Big East Conference to the Big 12 Conference, its on campus baseball field likewise did not meet league standards, and WVU played its conference games in Charleston until a new taxpayer funded stadium was built on campus. The stadium has also hosted concerts, boxing matches, charity events and shown television coverage of college football games on its scoreboard. The naming rights were purchased by Appalachian Power, the West Virginia and southwest Virginia operating unit of American Electric Power. In the ballpark's inaugural season, a Charleston baseball record 10,400 fans showed up on \\"Buck Night\\", which is a promotional night held on Thursdays where hot dogs, fountain drinks, and beer is $1. In 2008, parts of The World's Strongest Man competition were held at the stadium. In 2009, the South Atlantic League's 50th All-Star game was held at the stadium along with a home run derby, won by Calvin Anderson, and a fan fest. In 2012, Stadium Journey Magazine named Appalachian Power Park among the ten best minor league baseball parks in the nation, and number 58 in its list of 100 best athletic venues worldwide. TNA Wrestling held BaseBrawl Wrestling events at the stadium on September 8, 2012. Stadium features The ballpark features an authentic locomotive horn donated by Norfolk Southern Corporation, whose tracks run adjacent to the park, coincidentally continuing the atmosphere of predecessor Watt Powell Park. The horn was refurbished in 2005 by employees of Norfolk Southern's Juniata Locomotive Shop in Juniata, Pennsylvania at the request of Assistant Division Superintendent Joe Maynard of Williamson. One unique feature of the park is an electrical outlet located in the backstop behind home plate. This was added to accommodate local politician Rod Blackstone, nicknamed the \\"Toast Man,\\" who has become one of the most famous fans in minor league baseball. Blackstone brings numerous signs to urge the team on, and regularly leads the crowd in family-friendly cheers. He is most famous for bringing bread and a toaster to games, which he had done for years for the Power's predecessors. When a Power pitcher strikes out a batter, he yells \\"You are toast!\\" and then tosses slices of fresh (and not-so-fresh) toast into the seats around him, following it up with a chant of \\"Don't eat the toast. You don't know where it's been.\\" The section behind the opposing team dugout is known as \\"Rowdy Alley\\" where Billy Bob and the Rowdys deliver family-friendly, good-natured heckles to the opposing team players and coaches as well to the umpires when they make bad calls. Billy Bob and Rowdy Alley are carryovers from Watt Powell Park and they have been razzing the opposing team since the early Charleston Alley Cats days. A night doesn't go by without hearing what can only be described as a Billy Bob Cackle when an opposing player strikes out. Choruses of \\"DIRT BALL!\\" and \\"BORING!\\" (sometimes in both English AND Spanish) pepper the opposing pitchers, and opposing coaches who dare venture onto the field are met with \\"LEFT-RIGHT-LEFT-RIGHT\\" all the way to the mound and back. The Rowdys are also known for their use of props to amuse the fans: duck-shaped umbrellas pop-up with loud calls of \\"DUCK!\\" when foul balls ricochet overhead, costume accessories, and noise-makers are abundant. The stadium previously housed a seasonal and special events restaurant called the \\"Power Alley Bar and Grill\\" that featured food, indoor and outside seating, a full size bar, and pictures and memorabilia from Watt Powell Park and famous former players. In 2013, the restaurant was closed and reopened by a private vendor. The current restaurant is not sports-themed and does not have direct ties to the stadium. In 2007, a party deck was built near the right field foul pole that can accommodate 250 people. An upgrade to a normal game ticket can be purchased for $25, allowing access to the Party Deck, which features all-you- can-eat hot dogs, nachos and other \\"baseball food,\\" as well as unlimited drinks. Naming rights for the party deck were recently acquired by Anheuser- Busch. In the 2008 and 2009 seasons, this area was known as the \\"Landshark Lagoon\\" but has since been renamed the \\"Budweiser Party Deck.\\" Also in 2007, the Charleston Baseball Wall of Fame made its debut, located behind the home plate press box. \\"Wheeler\\" Bob (longtime Wheelers/Alley Cats/Power program & souvenir merchant), Rod \\"Toast Man\\" Blackstone, and Dave Parker are just three of the few who've had the honor of being inducted onto the Wall.

It is noted as a twin neighborhood of West Lawn. It has a population which includes a mix of dwindling Polish-American residents and increasing Mexican-American residents who currently constitute a clear majority. It has its own association, \\"West Elsdon Civic Association,\\" which privately organizes the neighborhood. St. Turibius grade school, a Roman Catholic elementary school, located at 57th and Karlov, closed in 2013 and is currently inactive though the building remains and is adjacent to St. Turibius Roman Catholic church. The former Lourdes Roman Catholic girls' high school located from 55th to 56th street from Komensky to Karlov Avenue is now a Chicago Public Schools magnet high school, John Hancock High School. History Before the early 20th century, the area now designated West Elsdon was a marshy remnant of an ancient lake. The early settlers were German-Americans and Irish-Americans. During the 1930s, housing was built and Polish-Americans and other Central Europeans settled the area. The land remained rural until World War II, when growth resumed and brick houses were built. After World War II, West Elsdon was the site of the Airport Homes race riots, the worst episode of racial inspired violence that the city faced in some thirty years. The West Elsdon Civic Association became one of the first vocal political enemies of the CHA and its first executive secretary, Elizabeth Wood. Opposition to public housing remained strong in the area. In the early 1970s the West Elsdon Civic Association was an active participant in the \\"No-CHA\\" citywide coalition opposing scattered-site public housing in predominantly middle-class white neighborhoods. Later, Mexican- Americans settled in the eastern part of the community. Soon public schools were registering more Hispanic-Americans, and the CTA Orange Line was built to connect Midway Airport to Downtown. Politics The West Elsdon community has supported the Democratic Party in the past two presidential elections by large margins. In the 2016 presidential election, West Elsdon cast 3,910 votes for Hillary Clinton and cast 685 votes for Donald Trump (82.18% to 14.40%). In the 2012 presidential election, West Elsdon cast 3,015 votes for Barack Obama and cast 736 votes for Mitt Romney (79.45% to 19.39%). Notable people * Anne M.

It won the inaugural International Dublin Literary Award and was shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize and the Miles Franklin Award. The novel covers themes of isolation, language, relationships (particularly those between men), community and living on the edge (of society, consciousness, culture). Its themes evolve into a greater narrative of an English boy, Gemmy Fairley, who is marooned on a foreign land and is raised by a group of aborigines, natives to the land in Queensland. When white settlers reach the area, he attempts to move back in the world of Europeans. As Gemmy wrestles with his own identity, the community of settlers struggle to deal with their fear of the unknown. Style and themes Malouf's narrative voice is at once scattered and singular, skipping between perspectives on the same events, and forcing the reader to pay close attention to each character's rendering in order to arrive at the wholest truth possible. The magical realism theme is cultivated in the exaggerated response of all the characters to mundane items: Gemmy surrenders to what he knows is a stick instead of a gun, because he attributes Lachlan's aiming it at him as a signal of the wariness of the other settlers. The men of the community are in an uproar over a stone that visiting aborigines (supposedly) pass off to Gemmy for no logical reason‚Äîonly because they fear whatever knowledge the aborigines have garnered of the land. These settlers are the first whites to live on that soil, and view anything that is not white with an extreme wariness, not only of the physical land but the spiritual sense of the place. Key quotations Gemmy is first shown at the fence between the European settlement, and the aborigine lands, about to fall onto the white side while three European children watched. > \\"The creature or spirit in him had spoken up, having all along had the words > in there that would betray him and which, when they came hooting out of his > mouth, so astonished him: Do not shoot. I am a B-b-British object.\\"(p.33) Gemmy contemplating Janet: > \\"She was a puzzle to him. He could never be sure what she was thinking. He > knew the boy's thoughts because he wanted them known. His power lay in your > recognizing that he possessed it. It was a power that belonged to him > because he was a boy; because one day, the authority he had claimed in > raising the stick to his shoulder would be real. The girl's power was > entirely her own. She needed no witness to it.\\"(p. 36) > \\"He was a parody of a white man.\\"(p.39) The settlers: > \\"For at any moment--and this was the fact of the matter--they might be > overwhelmed.\\"(p.42) > \\"What you fix your gaze on is the little hard-backed flies that are crawling > about in the corner of its bloodshot eyes and hopping down at intervals to > drink the sweat of its lip. And the horror it carries to you is not just the > smell, in your own sweat, of a half-forgotten swamp-world going back deep in > both of you, but that for him, as you meet here face to face in the sun, you > and all you stand for have not yet appeared over the horizon of the world, > so that after a moment all the wealth of it goes dim in you, then is > canceled altogether, and you meet at last in a terrifying equality that > strips the last rags from your soul and leaves you so far out on the edge of > yourself that your fear now is that you may never go back. It was the > mixture of monstrous strangeness and unwelcome likeness that made Gemmy > Fairley so disturbing to them, since at any moment he could show either one > face or the other; as if he were always standing there at one of those > meetings, but in his case willingly and the encounter was an embrace.\\"(p.43) Andy McKillop talking about Gemmy and the Aboriginals: ‚ÄòHe may be harmless, but they aren‚Äôt, they aren‚Äôt fucken harmless.‚Äô pp. 90 Gemmy's influence on the McIvor spouses. > Was he changed?

When he looked closer it was hundreds of wee > bright insects, each the size of his little fingernail, metallic, > iridescent, and the discovery of them, the new light they brought to the > scene, was a lightness in him - that was what surprised him - like a form of > knowledge he had broken through to. It was unnameable, which disturbed him, > but was also exhilarating; for a moment he was entirely happy. But he > wondered at himself. A grown man of forty with work to do, standing dreamily > stilled, extending his hand, palm downwards, over the backs of insects, all > suspended in their tiny lives in a jewel-like glittering. Another time, by > the creek, he looked up, casually he thought, and saw a bird. It was > balanced on a rounded stone dipping its beak into the lightly running water, > its grey squat body as undistinguished and dusty looking as a sparrow's (but > there were no sparrows here), its head grey, with a few untidy feathers. He > was sitting, himself, on a larger stone, also rounded, eating the last of a > sandwich, his boots in mud. But what his stilled blood saw was the bird's > beak drawing long silver threads out of the heart of the water, which was > all a tangle of threads, bunched or running; and his boots had no weight, > neither did his hand with the half-bitten lump of bread in it, nor his > heart, and he was filled with the most intense and easy pleasure: in the way > the air stirred the leaves overhead and each leaf had attached itself to a > twig, and whirled yet kept hold; and in the layered feathers that made up > the grey of the bird's head; and at how long the threads of water must be to > run so easily from where they had come from to wherever it was, imaginably > out of sight, that they were going - tangling, untangling, running free. And > this time too the intense pleasure he felt had a disturbing side.

He became a successful and wealthy pastoralist, and a member of the Western Australian Legislative Council. The Hamersley family became one of the most prominent families in the colony. Biography=Early life Edward Hamersley was born in Sandgate, Kent on 25 March 1810. He was educated at Pembroke College, Cambridge, graduating BA in 1833. He then spent a number of years touring throughout Europe, during which time he married Anne Louise Cornelis in Paris.Some sources write Corneille Their first son, Edward, was born in Paris in 1836. Adult life Around 1836, he decided to emigrate to Western Australia, largely on the basis of optimistic letters received from his sister Frances, who had moved to the colony with her husband William Locke Brockman in 1830. He sailed with his wife and son, arriving at Fremantle in February 1837. Upon arriving in Western Australia, he found many of the original settlers to be financially struggling, and he was able to obtain a number of large grants of land extremely cheaply. He then leased the land out, ensuring himself an income and allowing him to live in relative comfort in Perth. Economic conditions improved in the late 1830s, and his large land holdings brought him substantial wealth. In 1839, he became a partner in a horse breeding business with Samuel Pole Phillips, who had recently arrived in the colony, and in 1841 he became a director of the Western Australian Bank. However, late in 1842, the bottom dropped out of the wool market, and many settlers were ruined. His own losses were minor, but the colony overall was struggling, and he preferred not to remain there. He appointed an agent to manage his affairs in the colony, and in January 1843, the Hamersley family set sail for France. They would live there for the next six years. In January 1850, he returned to Western Australia to secure the titles to some of his land. Upon arriving in the colony, he learned that his agent had died a few months before, leaving his affairs in a confused state. Thus, Hamersley spent some time sorting out his estate, then launched into a new horse breeding venture. He became a leading horse-breeder and was a foundation member of the Western Australian Turf Club when it formed in 1852. In 1851, he partnered with Phillips, Lockier Burges and Bart Vigors to form an enterprise known as \\"The Cattle Company\\". Each man applied for leases on the Irwin River in the newly opened Champion Bay district, thus securing for the company a virtual monopoly of land in the area. The company was well managed by Phillips, and big profits were made in the first few years. Hamersley continued investing his profits in various town and farm properties, with a view to securing the future of his many children. This diversification protected him somewhat when profits from The Cattle Company fell away in the early 1860s. Phillips, who had not diversified, suffered great financial losses during this time, and a rift developed between the two men when Hamersley refused to increase Phillips book-keeping allowance. In June 1857, Hamersley and Phillips were both nominated to the Legislative Council. Initially they sided together, successfully fighting a proposal that Western Australia accept female convicts. Later, they opposed one another over the issue of representative government which Hamersley favoured, and this added to the ill feeling between the two. When the governor rejected a petition calling for elections, Hamersley resigned from the Council in protest. The Cattle Company was dissolved at the end of 1867, primarily because of the rift between Hamersley and Phillips. In 1870, he retired in Perth. Death Hamersley died in Perth on 26 November 1874. He was buried in East Perth Cemetery with his wife.

Some of the instruments used include the segaba and setinkane. The segaba is more like a violin, in the design, but uses only one string hooked to a tin. The setinkane is made with varying forks, and played more like a keyboard. During the colonial era, Tswana folk music was discouraged because it was considered a hindrance in the proper development of the region and people. Since independence for Botswana, folk music has been revived, though still the most popular music is from elsewhere in Africa (especially South Africa), United States and Europe.Stanley SadieThe New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, Volume 3. Macmillan Publishers, 1980. Page 90-92.

Bophuthatswana at Independence: 6 December 1977 Benbo, 1977 - Bophuthatswana (South Africa) page 27 Classification of music Tswana people classify their vocal music as 'dipina' (songs) according to their function within various social institutions for instance, music produced during initiation ceremonies is known as 'moamo'. The performance of much of the Tswana traditional music is related to the agricultural season of the year. The seasons are as follows: *Lethafula (Autumn):meaning 'to renew life', a time of hoeing songs and work-party songs; *Mariga (Winter): meaning 'shade', a time for children's fireside story songs; *Dikgakologo (Spring): meaning 'to melt away', a time when women and children chase crops by singing in the fields; *Selemo (Summer): meaning 'to salvage fallen crops from loose soil', a time for beer-brewing, beer-songs and beer-dances.Thomos F, Johnston.

Traditional Tswana songs are either 'mainmane a segologolo' which is a 'folklore of great import' or the songs are contemporary, where they originate from a known composer 'motlahami'. The songs may be sung in unison (pina e e kodunngwe) or in two or more parts. Multipart songs are usually in a 'call and response' form where the 'call' is known as 'segalodimo' and the response 'segalo tlase'.Thomos F, Johnston. Aspects of Tswana Music. Anthropos Institute.

The 'lengope' is mouth resonated, fingered with the left hand and plucked with the right forefinger. Sengwana- This bow is calabash-resonated, stick-struck, and has its cord divided unequally so as to produce a 2 tones, a minor third apart. The effect of variations in tone quality is made by the performer raising and lowering the calabash opening against their chest. This bow a much larger than the 'lengope' Setinkane - The 'setinkane' is similar to the 'sengwana' but it does not have a resonater. Nokukwane- This bow was obtained by the Korana people and the Tswana people are the only Bantu people who use it. The bow is simple however, its arc is more pronounced that the other bows.David Akombo. The Unity of Music and Dance in World Cultures. McFarland, 26 Jan 2016.

Professional wrestling career Sawyer started wrestling in 1978 in the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) affiliate Jim Crockett Promotions. He stayed there with some stints in Georgia Championship Wrestling until 1984. He mainly teamed with his brother, Brett Sawyer. He had a feud with The Road Warriors after he left their manager Paul Ellering's Legion of Doom. Buzz also had an epic feud with Tommy Rich that led to many bloody matches, the greatest of which was billed as the \\"Last Battle of Atlanta\\" and for the first time featured a completely enclosed cage. It also saw manager Paul Ellering suspended 20 feet above the ring in a smaller cage. This is the match that Shawn Michaels credits for inspiring the Hell in the Cell concept used by WWE. The stipulation for this match was that Sawyer and Rich would never wrestle one another again. Tommy Rich lost a match to Ted Dibiase and the stipulation was a loser leaves town match. Rich appeared the next week on TV under a mask and calling himself the mysterious Mr.R. WWE released the entire match on the WWE Network on September 5, 2016. Sawyer had a short World Wrestling Federation (WWF) run in 1984. He was called \\"Bulldog\\" Buzz Sawyer because Mad Dog was being used by Maurice Vachon. During Sawyer's few TV appearances, he was managed by Captain Lou Albano. Sawyer's gimmicks included a dog chain, a lot of barking and a new bulldog finisher. After his WWF stint he surfaced in the NWA territory CWF in Florida, under the mind control of Kevin Sullivan. He feuded with Mike Graham, Dusty Rhodes, and Adrian Street. In 1985, Buzz went to Mid-South Wrestling (which became the Universal Wrestling Federation in 1986) and became a prot√©g√© of Dick Slater's. After Slater won the North American title, he gave the Mid-South TV title to Sawyer to defend for him. The promotion tricked Slater into letting Sawyer defend the North American title (which he promptly lost), and Sawyer then refused to give the TV belt back to Slater. In 1986, Sawyer left the UWF for World Class Championship Wrestling. He formed a team with Matt Borne and they won the WCWA Tag Team Championship. He also won the WCWA Television Championship and the WCWA Texas Heavyweight Championship and feuded with Brian Adias while there. He got into a feud with Dingo Warrior and he lost his tag team titles, with Master Gee substituting for him, to Warrior and Lance Von Erich before reportedly being fired after failing a drug test. He returned to WCW in 1989 as part of Gary Hart's J-Tex Corporation that was feuding with the Four Horsemen, and he had several matches against Arn Anderson. He then joined Kevin Sullivan's \\"Slaughterhouse\\" stable in 1990.Foley, Mick.

It shows a mix of programming from RTP's domestic channels, together with special Contacto programmes aimed at Portuguese migrant communities in Europe, Africa, South America and North America, as well as Macao and East Timor. History It first started broadcasting via satellite in Europe on 10 June 1992 (Portugal Day). It soon expanded into Africa, where it reached audiences in Portuguese-speaking countries, as well as Canada, United States, Brazil and into Asia. It is also available on the Internet, via a subscription to the service JumpTV or with Octoshape . On 7 January 1998, RTPi ceased terrestrial broadcasting to Portuguese-speaking countries in Africa, and was replaced by a new separate service, called RTP √Åfrica, which was available as a terrestrial TV service in some countries, as well as being available via satellite, but RTPi continues to broadcast in Angola and Mozambique. RTPi is carried by satellite television services across Africa in various countries such as South Africa, Namibia or Zimbabwe. RTPi programming is also retransmitted by Teledifus√£o de Macau (TdM) in Macao, and by Televis√£o Timor Leste (TVTL) in East Timor, together with local broadcasts. In March 2005 it began 'time- shifting' its programming, with three separate schedules for the Americas, Europe, and Asia, so that viewers in different time zones could watch programmes at more convenient times. The former RTP International logo. In 2017, the TV and radio service ‚Äì RTP Internacional and RDP, respectively ‚Äì of RTP, as well as the Portuguese news agency Lusa, were suspended from operating in Guinea-Bissau. The measure was announced by Bissau-Guinean minister for the media, V√≠tor Pereira. He justified the decision with end of the contracts with RTP and Lusa. The Portuguese government considered the decision to be \\"unacceptable\\" and an \\"attack on freedom of expression, while Reporters Without Borders condemned that same decision. Lusa was eventually allowed to operate in the country, but RTP Internacional and RDP were not. Distribution RTP Internacional is available across all of North America for free via Galaxy 19 and Intelsat 805 . It is also available as a pay service via Dish Network in the United States and Rogers Cable and NexTV (IPTV Platform) in Canada. For years, the channel was carried in Australia and New Zealand via UBI World TV. In 2013, RTP Internacional returned to these countries via Luso Vision, which focuses on Portuguese, Brazilian and Chilean programming.
