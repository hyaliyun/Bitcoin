It also appeared on a number of live and compilation albums. It was intended for release as a single, but was prevented by its \\"scatological\\" lyrics. It was inspired by the same woman who inspired the band's #1 single \\"My Sharona.\\" It was praised by critics for its hooks and style, but criticized for its nastiness and sexism. Lyrics and music The music of \\"(She's So) Selfish\\" is based on a Bo Diddley-like riff. According to Averre, Fieger wrote most of \\"(She's So) Selfish\\" and Averre wrote the \\"release\\" section with its \\"dirty words\\": :When she takes you by the short hairs :It's the only thing she'll leave you down there :No fuck-a me fuck-a me today :No fuck-a me fuck-a me today The song was inspired by Fieger's as-yet-unrequited passion for Sharona Alperin, girlfriend of Doug Fieger, who also inspired other Knack songs such as \\"My Sharona,\\" and Averre has called it a \\"teasing, playful look\\" at her. Alperin concurs that she was the inspiration. According to Ed Stephens, Jr. of Saipan Tribune, the song is about a \\"manipulative tease.\\" Taking a line from the song, Ira Robbins and Michael Sandlin of Trouser Press describe the girl in the song as \\"rich bitch.\\" Ultimate Classic Rock writer Dave Swanson included it as one of the Knack's \\"top shelf, hook- laden rockers\\" but acknowledged that it is \\"full of words that wouldn't fly past radio censors.\\" Critic Robert Hilburn of the Los Angeles Times describes that the Knack uses crude, locker room language to portray a teenager's view of frustration. Robert Wilonsky of the Dallas Observer described it as a \\"teen-beat [anthem] about doin' it to your girlfriend while Mom and Dad were out of the house\\" Reception The Associated Press, TV Guide and others identified \\"(She's So) Selfish\\" as one of the Knack's radio hits. Terry Atkinson of the Los Angeles Times calls it \\"one of the Knack's better songs.\\" Mike Daily of The Age claims that it deserves equal credit with \\"My Sharona\\" for the success of Get the Knack. Audio magazine called it a \\"basher\\" with \\"plenty of style\\". Tina Maples of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel praised its \\"hooky effervescence\\". Charla Wasel of The Evening Independent described it as a song \\"with which we can all relate.\\" Billboard Magazine says that it is \\"delivered in a smart, sophisticated post-punk style that oozes Southern Californian snootiness.\\" It also uses the song as an example of the Knack being \\"mad about the way things are\\" with lyrics that \\"are as innocent as the chief of police in a Latin American dictatorship,\\" citing such lines as \\"she got a smile in her ass\\" and \\"she says she'll make your motor run but she won't give you none\\" as setting the tone. Author John Borack described \\"(She's So) Selfish\\" as a \\"mean pop tune\\" in which Fieger comes off \\"like a leering, sexist twit with hormones a-raging.\\" J. J. Syrja of The Seguin Gazette said that with this song the Knack \\"[struck] pure teenage delirium.\\" Paul Wagner of Santa Cruz Sentinel claimed that \\"it had the same sparkle\\" as \\"My Sharona.\\" Cue New York criticized the \\"sexist get-a-girl lyrics.\\" Jim Sullivan of The Boston Globe calls it \\"a tiresome, sexist rant.\\" The 3rd edition of The Rolling Stone Album Guide, music critic Robert Christgau and other critics commented on the song's nastiness, with authors Michael Uslan and Bruce Solomon calling it \\"by far the nastiest and most up-front cut on the album.\\" Eric Siegel of The Sun claims that lines such as \\"It's just me me me me/She's so (dramatic pause) selfish\\" make apparent the group's \\"lack of lyrical ability,\\" comparing the lyrics unfavorably to Carly Simon's similarly themed \\"You're So Vain.\\" Producer Mike Chapman considers \\"(She's So) Selfish\\" his favorite song from Get the Knack besides \\"My Sharona.\\" Actor/musician Robbie Rist considers it part of the \\"lethal opening salvo\\" that opens Get the Knack, which Rist feels few if any albums can match. Censored version Capitol Records wanted to release \\"(She's So) Selfish\\" as a follow-up single from Get the Knack to \\"My Sharona\\" and \\"Good Girls Don't\\" in time for Christmas 1979. However, they could not do so unless some of the more \\"scatological\\" references were edited out. The band, having already edited out some lyrics for the single release of \\"Good Girls Don't,\\" refused to do it again, preventing the single release. According to Knack bassist Prescott Niles, Fieger felt that altering the lyrics to \\"(She's So) Selfish\\" would be \\"selling out.\\" Averre didn't see anything problematic about including the profane lyrics, since that is how teenagers spoke and they heard such language all the time. Despite the band's concerns, an edited version of the song was released in Canada, removing lines such as \\"fuck-a me today\\" and \\"she don't give a shit about anybody else but herself.\\" This version was accidentally included on the initial compact disc release of Get the Knack in the United States, despite the fact that according to Fieger the tape with the altered lyrics was in a box with big red letters stating \\"NOT MASTER! NOT TO BE USED! ONLY CANADIAN RADIO!.\\" Other releases \\"(She's So) Selfish\\" was a staple of the Knack's live shows and was included in several of the band's live albums, generally towards the end of the set right before \\"My Sharona.\\" It was included on the 2012 live album Havin' a Rave-Up! Live in Los Angeles, 1978, which was based on two concerts the band performed in Los Angeles, California in 1978, before signing their record deal that would lead to Get the Knack. The Knack performed it at the 1979 concert at Carnegie Hall which was used for the 1982 video disc The Knack Live at Carnegie Hall. It was later included on the 2002 CD of Live From the Rock 'N' Roll Funhouse and on the 2007 DVD On Stage at World Cafe Live. \\"(She's So) Selfish\\" appeared on the Knack's 1992 compilation albums The Retrospective: The Best of the Knack and My Sharona.

Horse races were initially organised for the British cavalry at Akra before they were moved to the Maidan. The RCTC became the foremost horse-racing organization in India during the British Raj. At one time it was the governing body for nearly all racecourses in the subcontinent, defining and applying the rules governing the sport. During its heyday, RCTC-organised races were among the most important social events of the calendar and were opened by the Viceroy of India. Still a private club, the RCTC operates Kolkata Race Course in the Maidan. The club also held polo matches during the late 19th century, and hosted English-style gambling; the Calcutta Derby Sweeps, organised by the RCTC, was the world's largest sweepstake in the 1930s. After the closure of the Tollygunge racecourse, a new racecourse was opened by the club in Barrackpore during the 1920s; it was unsuccessful, however, due to poor attendance. Grandstands were built at the Maidan racecourse; Kolkata Race Course had three in 2020, including a three-tier main grandstand. Origins Governor Richard Wellesley disapproved of organised racing, and banned it in 1798. Calcutta was the first base of British power in India. With its cavalry-based army, sports such as hunting, polo and racing were popular. Organised horse races were first held in India on 16 January 1769 at Akra (near Calcutta), where they continued for the next 40 years. The first races were on a rough, temporary course wide enough for only four horses. Reformist governor Lord Wellesley disapproved of organised racing, and banned horse racing in 1798; five years later, however, the Bengal Jockey Club was formed to resume racing at Akra. The races moved to the Calcutta Maidan in 1809, where they have remained. The club laid out a new course in the southwest part of the Maidan in 1812, at approximately present racecourse location. A grandstand was built in 1820, which was later extensively modified. Races, held in the relative coolness of the morning (just after sunrise), usually consisted of five heats. If a race was not decided in the morning, the heats resumed after sunset. The British press regularly published Calcutta race results. In 1825, the Calcutta Welter (India's main horse-racing event) was moved to the new course. The Calcutta Derby Stakes, in which maiden Arabians ran for valuable prizes, began in 1842. Foundation and growth The Calcutta Turf Club was founded on 20 February 1847 to regulate all aspects of horse racing in the city. Club members were elected by ballot. It was governed by a five-person committee, and five stewards supervised the races. In 1856, the Calcutta Derby was replaced by the Viceroy's Cup. For this race, spectators were admitted by invitation only. Lord Ulrich Browne entered the Calcutta racing scene (which he would dominate) in 1860. Browne redrafted the racing rules and revised the weight-for-age scale. In 1879, the first Monsoon Meeting was held on a specially-constructed course inside the main course. Public interest in racing increased when races were conducted in the afternoon, and new stands were built in 1880. The club came to have the same authority as the Jockey Club in England (the arbiter on horse racing in that country), and a notice of a January 1863 race meeting in Muzaffarpur said that it would be held under Calcutta Turf Club rules. In 1883 the British House of Lords discussed an accusation against a Surgeon-Major Thornburn by the Lucknow Race Course of gambling irregularities which was upheld by the Calcutta Turf Club. A court of inquiry looked into the accusation, and the Commander-in-Chief of India upheld the club's ruling. Thorburn, who was refused a court-martial, was forced to return to England and retire. The Calcutta Turf Club was the governing body by 1899 of all of British India and Burma's 52 racecourses except for Bombay (now Mumbai), Poona (now Pune), Karachi and Khelapur (now Kolhapur), which were under the jurisdiction of Bombay's Western India Turf Club. Viceroy's Cup Day, c. 1910 During the 1880s the Calcutta Turf Club held polo matches which were open to Indians and Europeans. From 1886 to 1897, Sir William McPherson headed the club. McPherson upgraded the racing rules, and reached an agreement with the Bombay Turf Club that any racecourse in India which held races under the rules was subject to the authority of Calcutta or Bombay. He introduced other changes: jockeys could not bet, and professional handicappers were introduced. Steeplechasing was brought under the club's jurisdiction in 1888. The first Grand National in India was run in 1895 at the course at Tollygunge, and steeplechasing was one of the racing season's main events. Lord William Beresford, a member of the viceroy's staff, won the Viceroy's Cup in 1881 with his black gelding Camballo and won the cup three more times with Myall King. Apcar Alexander Apcar, a wealthy merchant whose family owned the Apcar Line of steamships, owned a stud of Australian racehorses and was president of the Calcutta Turf Club. Apcar was a rival of Beresford, who believed in the merits of English Thoroughbreds. His Great Scott won the Viceroy's Cup three times, as did his horse Mayfowl. At the opening of the Christmas race week (an important social event), the viceroy of India and his wife would drive in state past the grandstand. The Prince of Wales, the future King George V, attended the races in 1905. The Maharaja of Burdwan, Bijay Chand Mahtab, was the first Indian to be elected a full member of the club in 1908. Apcar played a significant role in the construction of a new grandstand, which was modelled on the stands at Longchamp Racecourse. The grandstand, built between 1905 and 1907, was open to the public. The monsoon track, designed to drain quickly, was added in 1910. The club added \\"Royal\\" to its name in 1912, after King George V attended the races for the second time. During the 20th century, the Calcutta Turf Club held races on 28 days per year. At one time, the club had jurisdiction over 73 racecourses across the Indian subcontinent. Later years Grandstand of the former Barrackpore racecourse, north of Kolkata The Barrackpore racecourse in 2012 In 1915, the Tollygunge course closed and its steeplechases were moved to the Maidan course. During the early 1920s, the RCTC became concerned about the lease of the Maidan course and looked for an alternative. Expanding the Tollygunge course was an obvious choice, but the price of adjacent land increased steeply when the plan became known. A site on the north in Barrackpore, which included a racecourse, became available \\"at a very reasonable price\\" in 1922. The RCTC decided to build a modern facility with new stands, stables and two courses: a round course and a straightaway. The large grandstand would be partitioned at first between members and the public; if the course was successful, a members-only grandstand would be built. The railway agreed to provide a spur line to the course for horses and spectators, and the facility was inaugurated on 27 January 1928. Grand Nationals continued at the Maidan course until 1929, when the race was moved to Lahore. Before World War II, the club looked to Australia rather than England for guidance. The Australian Harvey Roulston was hired as an administrator; the Australian Gray gate was used instead of the English starting flag; Australian jockeys (such as Edgar Britt) moved to Calcutta to ride for the Baroda State maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III, and Australian horses were imported. Methods of detecting drugs, such as benzedrine, from urine or blood samples became available during the 1930s. The club rules were updated to require drug tests years before they were introduced by the Jockey Club. Although the Barrackpore course was generally technically superior to the Maidan course, it did not attract the public and consistently lost money. Races were held until 1941, when it was requisitioned by the army. After the war, the course was rehabilitated and races were run in 1947 and 1948. It was sold to the government in 1954 in an arrangement which included renewing the lease on the Maidan course. Sir Uday Chand Mahtab became a steward in 1947. He was elected senior steward in 1955, a position he held for 27 years. During the early 1950s, the South India Turf Club split off from the RCTC to oversee racing in Bangalore, Madras (Chennai), Hyderabad, Mysore and Ooty. The SITC divided into separate authorities based in Madras, Bangalore and Hyderabad. During the 1970s, these clubs and the original Calcutta and Bombay clubs became a loose association of Indian turf authorities. In February 1961, Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip visited the course and presented the winning trophy. The races were an important social event during the decade, and women dressed glamorously. In 1971, Geoffrey Moorhouse ranked the RCTC on a par with the Bengal Club, the Tollygunge Club and the Calcutta Club. Gambling 1934 10-rupee Calcutta Derby Sweepstake ticket The Calcutta Turf Club imported the English practice of gambling on races, and named their Derby and St Leger after the English races. The club was organized, in 1847, partly to regulate such gambling. A mildly-disapproving 1866 account called the betting practices \\"lotteries\\". In early Indian horse racing, betting combined a lottery and an auction. One hundred ten-rupee tickets were typically sold, and the money placed in a pot. A ticket was drawn for each horse in the race. These tickets were auctioned, with the ticket holder getting half the winning bid and the other half going into the pot; after the race, the pot was divided among those with tickets for the winning horses. Parimutuel betting began in 1872. The Calcutta Turf Club Derby draw was started as a private sweepstake in 1887 by Lord William Beresford. Shortly after World War I, the sweepstakes awarded prizes of ¬£75,000, ¬£35,000 and ¬£15,000 for the top three horses in the club's Derby. The Calcutta Derby Sweepstake was well-known worldwide, with the pool reaching almost ¬£1 million in 1929 and 1930. Forty percent of the pool went to the first-prize winner, twenty percent to the second and ten percent to the third. Tickets for unplaced horses also received a share, and the club kept 10 percent. The sweepstake was open only to members of the RCTC, or to friends who could ask members to place a wager. Although methods were developed to make it easier for gamblers in other countries to place bets, the Calcutta Derby Sweepstake could not compete with the Irish Hospitals' Sweepstake (introduced in the 1930s) even though the expected payout was higher. Present day The Victoria Memorial, separated from the racecourse by Hospital Road The club was housed in the former home of the Apcar family: a two-story, well-maintained Palladian building dating to the early 19th century. The building has a portico on the north side, and a veranda on the south. The ground-level floors are marble, and the doors are made of teak. The two-story vestibule has a carved wooden staircase leading to the upper floor, where the family had their private rooms. The building was at 11 Russell Street; with comfortable leather sofas and armchairs, it was described as an oasis of calm. The present racecourse has three grandstands. The main pavilion has three tiers, with elaborate turrets and wrought-iron railings. Across the grounds from the grandstand (east of the racecourse) is the Victoria Memorial, a marble monument to Queen Victoria. The grandstands, except for the Members Stand, are now open to the public; Admission to the races is by ticket. Races are primarily held on Saturdays, and sometimes on weekdays. The Monsoon Meet (from July to October) is followed by the Cold Weather Meet, from November to April. The club continues to hold polo matches on the infield of the racecourse.  Pollution case  In March 2017, environmental activist Subhas Datta submitted an application to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) concerning untreated manure released from the club's stables. The application also noted that liquid waste was stressing Kolkata's sewer system and flowing into Adi Ganga, polluting the Hooghly River. In October of that year, the NGT asked Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) to inspect the area; the report said that an open drainage network in the club had outlets to the city's sewer network and Adi Ganga. To minimise pollution and health risks to the people living around the racecourse, the stables in Hastings and the veterinary hospital, the tribunal (following reports by KMC and the West Bengal Pollution Control Board ) directed the club to develop a solid-waste management plan and install a sewage treatment plant in three months; failure to do so would cost the club per day. KMC also suggested diverting the outlets to its effluent-treatment plants. The club was asked to post a bond with the state pollution-control board. On 28 January 2019, the NGT increased the bond by ; the club was cited as a wilful defaulter, since it missed the deadline to complete the project. A month later, the Supreme Court allowed the RCTC to return to the NGT to review the forfeited bond. The tribunal reduced the original amount by 90 percent, and asked the state pollution-control board to refund the remaining ; the bond increase was also waived.

Biographical Sketch of Leland Park, NCLA Leadership Institute Mentor Retrieved February 2, 2014.  History = 1920s  The idea for a southern library association was conceived in 1920 by a group of librarians, namely Tommie Dora Barker, Mary Utopia Rothrock, and Charlotte Templeton, on their way to an American Library Association meeting in Colorado Springs. Their idle conversation about the possibility of a regional library association evolved into a serious discussion about the advantages a regional library association might offer. After a meeting in early June the ALA sent out letters to leading southern librarians describing the proposed meeting and asking for criticism, suggestions, and support. Once the responses to the preliminary letters were received, invitations to the first meeting were dispatched. The first regional meeting took place in Signal Mountain, Tennessee on November 12 and 13, 1920 with an attendance of approximately one hundred librarians from seven states. This meeting was originally called the Southeastern Library Conference; its purpose was to address the general, professional issues concerning information professionals at the time rather than topics on administration and technique. The success of the first meeting prompted conference leaders to schedule another meeting for November 1922.\\"A Signal of Accomplishment- The 1920s\\", \\"SELA\\", 7 November 2013 Library Journal, edited by Melvil Dewey, reported that the association was officially founded at the November 1922 meeting, and the journal published the association's proposed constitution.Conference of Southeastern Librarians, Library Journal, Volume 47, p. 1082. Retrieved February 2, 2014. During the 1922 meetings attendees addressed several key issues, such as, the provision of library services, the establishment of training facilities for African Americans, and the adoption of a new constitution that provided an informal organization based upon state membership (automatically making members of state library organizations SELA members). In addition, librarians Mary Utopia Rothrock, of the Lawson McGhee Library in Knoxville, and Charlotte Templeton, of the Greenville Public Library, were elected the first president and secretary-treasurer of the association. During the 1924 Asheville Conference, nine states- Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia- ratified the constitution. The April 1926 Signal Mountain Conference established goals to improve library services over a ten-year period, including the negotiation with the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools regarding standards for school libraries and institutions offering courses on school librarianship. On the final conference of the decade, the 1928 conference in Biloxi, substantial progress was made in providing services to minorities, establishing standards, and setting up state library agencies; and in 1929 the Policy Committee prepared a special report citing critical needs for the Southeast to be submitted to their national foundations at their January 1930 meetings.  1930s  The goals that were identified in 1929, by the Policy Committee, were achieved with the financial support from three educational foundations: (1) The Julius Rosenwald Fund provided support to numerous school and college libraries for African Americans, sponsored demonstration programs of public library service, and laid the foundation for library extension work in the South through grants to several southern states. (2) The General Education Board, which made funds available to establish the position of school library supervisor in eight of the nine southeastern states whose role to support research programs and to sponsor cooperative enterprises in university libraries in the southern U.S. region. (3) The Carnegie Corporation which funded a survey of library training facilities in the South and provided direct assistance in updating collections in many college and university libraries in the region. The 1930 Tampa conference included reports on the completed survey of library training programs, the need for librarian certification, continued support for county library development, and better library legislation. In 1934 the first joint conference of the Southeastern and Southwestern Library Association was held in Memphis; the purpose of the joint conference was to address the evolving relationship between libraries and social development and the need for governmental support. Attendees were challenged to plan constructively in all developmental areas from elementary school to the largest research library by Dr. Louis Round Wilson, Dean of the Graduate Library School at the University of Chicago. Two years later, during the 1936 Asheville conference, cooperative measures to strengthen research facilities were discussed. During the 1938 Atlanta conference discussions were held on federal and state aid; librarians began to recognize the importance of obtaining government funding for library development and they were willing to seek it.  1940s  Federal aid continued to be at the forefront at the 1940 Savannah conference. The association was also in need of reorganization and for necessary committees to be established however, because of World War II, all conferences had to be suspended, but some programs were continued and a survey on the size and effectiveness of southern libraries, jointly sponsored by SELA and the TVA Library Council was undertaken. Conferences started up again in 1946 in Asheville and reorganization was once again the main priority of the meeting agenda; two committees were set up: The Publications Committee to investigate the publishing studies affecting regional librarianship and the feasibility of establishing a quarterly journal, and the Activities Committee to revise the constitution. The reports of these two committees were approved during the 1948 Louisville conference, and they also provided for annual meetings, a headquarters office, a full-time executive secretary, and a quarterly journal.  1950s  On March 13, 1950, although Tennessee was essentially the birthplace of the SELA, Georgia became the state where the SELA became a legal corporation to enter into legal contracts. The headquarters office was established at Georgia Tech (where it remained for the next twenty years) and Dorothy M. Corsland, librarian at the Georgia Institute of Technology, became the first acting Executive Secretary. In Atlanta, October 1950, a new constitution was prepared; it was finalized by November 4, 1950. The first issue of the Southeastern Librarian came out in 1951; first issued semi- annually, it has been issued quarterly since 1953. In 1952, then president Louis Shores appointed the first Southern Books Competition Committee, which; to this day, remains to be a major project for SELA. Cataloging practices in small libraries were also surveyed during that year at the Atlanta Conference; and, in fact, the meeting concluded the first biennium as an incorporated organization. In 1956 President Nancy Jane Day persuaded the Southern States Work Conference to take school libraries as one of its study projects, which significantly enhanced the visibility of school libraries. During the Roanoke Conference of that same year the Trustees and Friends of the Library, formed in 1946, officially met as a section of the Southeastern Library Association, and, upon recommendation from the SELA Activities Committee, a workshop for new committee chairs and officers was called for February 1958, which became a customary practice for SELA. During the 1958 Louisville Conference, with Regionalism being the main objective, the association discussed ways to strengthen the relationship between the nine affiliated state associations and the association itself.  1960s  This was a decade where SELA made significant advancements, attributable to the major federal legislation advancements made at the time. The Asheville SELA conference of 1960 was preceded by two workshops on facilities: The Public Library Building Institute and the College Library Buildings Institute. Before the 1962 conference, three more workshops were held: Recruiting for Librarianship in the Southeast, Library Education, and Library Service to Business and Industry. At the 1962 conference The Reference Services Section reported on a survey of the inter- library loan services in libraries of all types. During the 1964 conference in Norfolk the Sections of the association were, for the first time, responsible for planning the general sessions and, following the passage of the Higher Education Act (HEA), the officers representing SELA attended many workshops concerning Title II (HEA) programs and its allocations. In 1967 a workshop on Interlibrary Loan Cooperation was held to assist in the implementation of Title III of the Library Services and Construction Act. The first workshop on Library Automation was held in Gatlinburg in 1968. By the next conference, which took place in Miami, membership reached 3,085, the largest number on record.  1970s  In 1970, two new sections of the SELA were approved during the Atlanta conference: Special Libraries and Library Education. In addition, the constitution was revised to include an elected secretary and a paid executive secretary. By 1971 a comprehensive survey of libraries in the Southern region was initiated; the information compiled within the survey was meant to supplement and update the information collected in the original survey which was done twenty-five years ago. In 1974, during a conference in Richmond, West Virginia became the tenth state affiliate of the SELA. Between 1975 and 1976 the results from the survey were published in the University of Alabama Press, Libraries and Library Services in the Southeast. In addition; January 2, 1975 marked the first SOLINET terminal at Emory University.Wedgeworth, Robert (1993). World Encyclopedia of Library and Information Services, p. 120. Retrieved February 2, 2014. To implement the recommendations from the survey Dr. Mary Edna Anders, of the Industrial Development Division at Georgia Tech, was appointed part-time interim Executive Director of SELA, and during her six-month tenure detailed planning for the headquarters, including funding, was accomplished. In August, 1976 TVA granted $100,000 to assist in the support of the headquarters office as a demonstration in regional development during the next four years. The SELA's first permanent award was established in January 1976 at the bequest of the estate of Mary Utopia Rothrock (one of the early founders of SELA) to provide a biennial award to a southeastern librarian for exceptional library development within the region. On January 3, 1977 former librarian of Austin Peay University, Johnnie Givens, became the first full-time Executive Director, and during that time two grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Oak Ridge National Laboratory for a Solar Technology Transfer Program were secured. That same year, two publications were simultaneously prepared by two different SELA committees: The Southeastern Bibliographic Directory: Academic Libraries and Special Collections in Libraries of the Southeast; by 1978 the association had the publications distributed. 1978 was also the year two of the association's prestigious awards were given out: the first activity award went to the Greenville County Public Library in South Carolina in recognition for the outstanding children's program and Pulitzer Prize winner, Eudora Welty, received the first Outstanding Author Award. In addition, John Gribben and Kenneth E. Toombs, founders of SOLINET, received the Rothrock Award. In fall of 1978 the Junior Members Round Table was established. In 1979, after discontinuing the Executive Director's position, the Executive Board, in the best fiscal interest of the association, decided to staff the headquarters office once again with a part-time executive secretary and a full-time office manager. In June of that year, The Southeastern Librarian received special ALA recognition when it was awarded the H.W. Wilson Award for the most outstanding library periodical of the preceding year. Also, in observance of the twenty-fifth anniversary of SELA's Southern Books Competition, the association published a list of award winners from 1952 to 1977. In 1979, after several transfers, headquarters was finally moved from Georgia Tech to an office complex in Tucker, Georgia.  1980s  During the Birmingham Conference of 1980, members observed the association's sixtieth anniversary with the publication of The Southeastern Library Association, Its History and Its Honorary Members, 1920-1980. In 1980, the association honored Virginia Lacy Jones, one of the first African-Americans to earn their PhD in Library Science, with the Mary Rothrock award.Wedgeworth, Robert (1993). World Encyclopedia of Library and Information Services, p. 417. Retrieved February 2, 2014. The 1980-82 biennium saw the creation of three new roundtables: Library Instruction, Online Search Librarians, and Government Documents. The biennium also conducted several workshops, such as, \\"Library Marketing\\" sponsored by the Public Relations Committee, \\"From Tape to Product: Some Practical Considerations\\" sponsored by the Resources and Technical Services Section, and \\"Crisis in the Southeast\\" (focusing on children's services) sponsored by the School and Children's Librarians Section. At the 1982 conference in Louisville, Kentucky, an expanded, revised version of the SELA Handbook was distributed to members, and Louisiana became the eleventh constituent member of the association. In Spring of 1987, upon examination of the association's organizational structure, then SELA president Charles Beard recommended that the Legislative/Library Cooperation Committee be split into two separate committees, because of the need of increased emphasis on these two areas. President Beard also requested for a special interest group on Library Services to the Aging to be established; this special interest group became a sub-committee to the Reference and Adult Services Section. During the 1986 biennial conference in Atlanta, the SELA introduced a resolution to support the Division of Library and Information Management at Emory University preventing the closing of one of the leading library and information management programs in the nation.  1990s  The 1990s was an important period for the Southeastern Library Association; it was an opportunity for members and committee leaders to embrace new challenges and focus on the needs and opportunities of the coming years. SELA associates were focusing on preparations for the 1991 White House Conference on Library and Information Science; the second national gathering of librarians and advocates. Local and national meetings were held to gather opinions and to determine directions for this national gathering of librarians and advocates,U.S. National Commission on Libraries and Information Science. Davenport, Nancy and Russell, Judith Coffey, eds. (March 2008). Meeting the information needs of the American people: Past actions and future initiatives p. 37. Government Printing Office. Retrieved February 2, 2014. and an ad hoc task force; which met August 16‚Äì18, 1990; was created as a preliminary consensus building step. The association has been struggling to maintain its program within their existing revenue, and in light of the changing roles of librarianship the association needed to show that it can embrace pragmatism. In the Spring of 1996, then SELA president Joe Forsee appointed a committee to study the future directions of the Southeastern Library Association. The newly created Future Directions Committee began its work by reviewing the traditional roles of SELA and whether those roles existed or needed to be played within the Southeast, plus new roles that SELA might take up that are needed by its members and those who are associated with the library and information services field. Throughout the 1990s, members worked on a variety of projects for the betterment of the association and the library profession, for example, a new SELA membership directory was created and the traveling SELA exhibit was refreshed.  2000s  After the September 11th, 2001 attacks libraries faced new intellectual freedom challenges caused by the U.S. Patriot Act and other restrictive legislation. In addition, the explosion of the Internet and the introduction of Library 2.0 profoundly changed how libraries function. As a result, SELA was forced to adapt, for instance, much of the committee work; which was performed through conference calls and correspondence; was transferred to electronic discussions, and emphasis was placed on the expansion of the SELA website, in fact, the site was hosted by a variety of organizations and institutions, such as, the Southeast Florida Library Information Network (SEFLIN), The University of Central Florida, and Austin Peay University. The association's publication, The Southeastern Librarian, also made great strides with the introduction of the peer-review process. Issues also became available electronically on the association's website, and H.W. Wilson contracted with the association to offer online access to the journal. The Southeastern Librarian also transitioned to a twice yearly e-newsletter and a bi-annual traditional journal. In 2006 SELA archives were transferred from Emory University to the Valdosta State University Archives and Special Collections department. In 2002 the Ginny Frankenthaler Memorial Scholarship was created to provide financial assistance toward completion of a graduate degree in library science. During this decade, due to reduced participation of state organizations and the decline in revenue, SELA members had to think of strategies to ensure the future of the Southeastern Library Association; in fact, in January 2007, a new committee structure was introduced including the new Membership and Mentoring Committee. In 2008 the SELA President's Award was renamed the Charles E.

A great sports man himself, Niesen encouraged his students to participate in sports. He formed leagues in all sports and there were tournaments organised throughout the school year that culminated in Annual Sports Day. By 1954, Godavari St. Xavier's was well established and another school at Jawalakhel had been opened for the primary students. Niesen moved to Nepal to take up the work of principal of Godavari High School and superior of the Jesuits in Nepal. He also continued the task of teaching mathematics in all the senior classes. Later, Fr. Niesen moved to Jawalakhel to take over the junior school and built the \\"new\\" building at Jawalakhel, one of the first structures in Nepal using the then novel reinforced concrete pillars and slabs. Fr. Niesen suffered from asthma, and later emphysema. By 1968 Fr.

The notion of universality is familiar in the study and application of statistical mechanics to various physical systems since its introduction in a very precise fashion by Leo Kadanoff. Although not quite the same, it is closely related to universality as applied to quantum systems. This concept links to the essence of renormalization and scaling in many problems. Renormalization is based on the notion that a measurement device of wavelength \\\\lambda is insensitive to details of structure at distances much smaller than \\\\lambda. An important consequence of universality is that one can mimic the real short-structure distance of the measurement device and the system to be measured by simple short-distance structure. Even though it is seen that scaling, universality and renormalization are closely related, they are not to be used interchangeably. Universal characteristics of shapes of potential steps For low energy particles, the exact detail of the potential step is irrelevant. This means that the intermediate change in the potential between 0 and V_0 is irrelevant for particles with extremely low energies. An important consequence of this is that theoretical calculations made for a Heaviside step function potential work perfectly well for potentials that have a finite spatial rate of change in potential: finite ‚àÜV over ‚àÜx, which is the case with physical situations, for e.g. - quantum confinement systems of nano dots, etc. For a general potential barrier: :V(x) = \\\\begin{cases} 0 & x < -a\\\\ V(x) & -a < x < a\\\\ V_0 & a < x \\\\end{cases}, The time-dependent Schr√∂dinger's equation in one-dimension is: :i\\\\hbar\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t} \\\\Psi(x,t) = \\\\left [ \\\\frac{-\\\\hbar^2}{2m} abla^2 + V(x,t)\\\\right ] \\\\Psi(x,t) It is instructive to analyse this equation after expanding \\\\Psi(x,t) in the plane wave basis \\\\exp[i(px-Et)/\\\\hbar]. p, then, is real for E>V. For when E < V, the relevant length scale in this problem is the range of the wavefunction under the barrier which is given by: r = \\\\frac{\\\\hbar}{\\\\sqrt{2m(V_0-E)}} \\\\simeq \\\\frac{\\\\hbar}{\\\\sqrt{2mV_0}} for low energy particles, i.e. - E\\\\rightarrow 0. When r\\\\ll a , the wave cannot resolve the detailed shape of the potential and one must have R = 1. The wavelength of a particle in the region of zero potential (essentially, a free particle) with energy E is given as: \\\\lambda = \\\\frac{\\\\hbar}{\\\\sqrt{2mE}}. For low-energy waves incident on this potential from the left: \\\\lambda \\\\gg a. Essentially, for low energy, or large wavelength, particles, the exact detail of the potential barrier is irrelevant. This is a feature that is universal to different V(x) for a well behaved function V(x). Universal characteristics of potential barriers Potentials display universality in their structural aspects and their resonance phenomena. For scattering at a finite potential barrier of height V_0, the time-independent Schr√∂dinger equation for the wave function \\\\psi(x) reads: :H\\\\psi(x)=\\\\left[-\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2m}\\\\frac{d^2}{dx^2}+V(x)\\\\right]\\\\psi(x)=E\\\\psi(x) where H is the Hamiltonian, \\\\hbar is the (reduced) Planck constant, m is the mass, E the energy of the particle and :V(x)=V_0[\\\\Theta(a-x)-\\\\Theta(a+x)] is the barrier potential with height V_0>0 and width 2a. \\\\Theta(x)=0,\\\\; x<0;\\\\; \\\\Theta(x)=1,\\\\; x>0 is the Heaviside step function. In terms of dimensionless parameters y = x/a, z = E/V_0, \\\\rho = \\\\frac{a\\\\sqrt{2mE}}{\\\\hbar} and \\\\rho ' = \\\\rho \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{z - 1}{z}} :\\\\psi_I(x) = A_I e^{i \\\\rho y} + A_{II} e^{-i\\\\rho y}\\\\quad y<-1 :\\\\psi_{II}(x) = B_I e^{i \\\\rho ' y} + B_{II} e^{-i\\\\rho ' y}\\\\quad y<1 :\\\\psi_{III}(x) = C_I e^{i \\\\rho y} + C_{II} e^{-i \\\\rho y}\\\\quad y>1 With the subscripts I, II and III to \\\\psi given by the regions of y mentioned alongside their expressions. For a wave that is incident from the left, we have C_{II} = 0 and one finds the reflection coefficient to be: : R = \\\\frac{(\\\\rho^2 - \\\\rho '^2)^2\\\\sin^2 (2\\\\rho)}{4\\\\rho^2\\\\rho '^2 + (\\\\rho^2 - \\\\rho '^2)^2\\\\sin^2 (2\\\\rho)} The wavelength of the incident wave is an exact multiple of the barrier width whenever 2\\\\rho = 2n\\\\pi. For such energies, one finds that R = 0 and T = 1. In terms of the dimensionless variables, these resonances in scattering from potentials occur at energies, E_n^* = \\\\frac{n^2\\\\pi^2\\\\hbar^2}{2ma^2}. The quantity r^2 defined as: :r^2 := \\\\rho^2 - \\\\rho '^2 = \\\\frac{2mV_0a^2}{\\\\hbar^2} is a shape property of the potential, and is independent of the energy. Two different potentials (for V_0 and a) with the same r have the same physics. This can be heuristically understood as a relation to the relevant length scales in the problem: a is the length of the potential and this identifies a momentum scale for this problem as, setting \\\\hbar = 1, 1/a. In mass weighted scales, we identify an energy scale as 1/a^2 and form a dimensionless quantity using the height of the potential and the energy scale 1/a^2 as V_0a^2. Reintroducing \\\\hbar and m, we discover: 2mV_0a^2/\\\\hbar^2, which is precisely our shape parameter r. Using r, the reflection coefficient becomes: : R = \\\\frac{r^4\\\\sin^2(2\\\\rho)}{4\\\\rho^2\\\\rho '^2 + r^4\\\\sin^2(2\\\\rho)} For 2\\\\rho = 2n\\\\pi + \\\\delta, one finds R ‚âÖ \\\\frac{r^4\\\\delta^2}{16n^4\\\\pi^4} ‚àù \\\\delta^2. The power of \\\\delta is \\"universal\\" in the sense that it is independent of n. However, the constant of proportionality depends on n.Gupta, S. - Lectures on Quantum Mechanics (2013): http://theory.tifr.res.in/~sgupta/courses/qm2013/hand7.pdf A very simple proof of above for one dimensional system is given by observing that once the shape of potential is determined, reflectivity becomes a function of energy only. Further from its definition it is clear that its maximum and minimum value are 1 and 0 respectively. At the resonance energy E_0 the reflectivity is 0. Making a Taylor expansion of R(E) = R(E_0)+R'(E_0) (E-E_0)+ \\\\frac{R(E_0)}{2!} (E-E_0)^2+ \\\\cdots. As at resonance energy E_0, the reflectivity is minimum, and therefore we have R'(E_0)=0 . Also at E_0, R(E_0)=0. So near resonance energy, R(E) \\\\propto (E-E_0)^2 . In terms of \\\\delta, up to first order, (E-E_0) \\\\propto \\\\delta. So near resonance energy we have, R(E)\\\\propto\\\\delta^2. Other systems A complex current source \\\\mathbf{J}(\\\\mathbf{r},t) of size d that generates radiation with wavelengths \\\\lambda >> d is accurately mimicked by a sum of point-like multipole currents. The multipole expansion is a simple example of a renormalization analysis. In thinking about the long-wavelength radiation it is generally much easier to treat the source as a sum of multipoles than to deal with the true current directly. This is particularly true since usually only one or two multipoles are needed for sufficient accuracy. In a quantum field theory, a quantum fluctuation probes arbitrarily short distances. This is evident when one computes radiative corrections in perturbation theory which seem infinitely sensitive to short-distance behavior. Universality tells us that to look at the low momentum physics, or the large wavelength limit, we do not need to know what happens at large momenta. As in the multipole expansion, we can replicate the highly non- trivial high-energy by a generic set of effective point-like interactions.

The fen \\"Hazenputten\\" in the Vresselse Bossen in Nijnsel It is a young forest that planted in a drift-sand ridge. At the beginning of the 20th century, there was scarcely a tree in the area. The area consisted mainly of dunes and heathland. At the edges of the area lived farmers who were severely affected by the shifting sands. To protect the fields was therefore decided to reforest the drift-sand. At that time, almost exclusively pine was used for the reforesting. In the twenties of the 20th century, it had become a production forest consisting of Scots pine for the Limburgian mines. Within the area, there are two main fen systems: The Hazenputten and the Oude Putten. Rare vegetation is found around the fens: among others White beak-sedge and bog asphodel can be found here. The contemporary management by Staatsbosbeheer focuses on getting a more varied forest composition, including native oak, linden and beech. To prevent the Hazenputten from drying, competing for vegetation is removed around the pools. The area around the marshes has been grazed by Highland cattle and Exmoor horses in the past. The area has a rich bird population. Breeding birds are: yellowhammer, kingfisher, black woodpecker, northern goshawk, little grebe, European green woodpecker, common buzzard, great egret, long-eared owl, coal tit, little owl, barn owl and crested tit. Also many species of mammals can be encountered: These include: roe deer, European badger, Eurasian harvest mouse, European polecat, European water vole, European hedgehog, Eurasian red squirrel, common pipistrelle, European hare, brown long-eared bat, stoat, serotine bat, European mole, Natterer's bat, least weasel, red fox, Daubenton's bat, beech marten and several species of shrew, dormice, apodemus and arvicolinae.

He qualified and practised as a solicitor in Scotland and was a lecturer in public law at the University of Aberdeen before joining the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) in 1988. Between posts at the FCO he served at the embassy in Dublin and was the consul-general at Boston.

He was appointed Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in the 2016 New Year Honours. In February 2018, Rankin signed into law the Domestic Partnerships Act 2018, which effectively reversed the right of gay couples to marry. This made Bermuda the first jurisdiction to legalise and then repeal same-sex marriage rights. The law relating to same-sex marriage in Bermuda could change again, as the Supreme Court stated in June 2018 that repealing same-sex marriage rights was discriminatory and thus contrary to section 12 of the Bermuda Constitution. On September 16 2020 it was announced that Rankin would be replacing Gus Jaspert as Governor of the British Virgin Islands in 2021.

The Geelders are part of the larger area Het Groene Woud. The varied landscape of the Geelders consists of coppice hedges, with deciduous forests with drover's roads, poplars, heathland, grassland and farmland. Already in the 17th century was the area used for the production of oak coppice. The bark of trees was used in the tannery. In order to exploit the forest as well as possible there were wide drover's roads constructed. For an extensive system of drainage there were ditches and trenches constructed. On the available new land there were rabatten made, which are the higher ground ridges between the trenches which were used for silviculture. Cavities in old and often declining trees are grateful breeding and hiding places for tawny owls and beech martens. In spring the forest soils are covered with millions of wood anemones, which are pleasing to the eye. The clay layer keeps the area quite wet and as result there can be found rare plants like true lover's knot, Dactylorhiza maculata, royal fern and primrose. Also native specimens of wild medlar, Guelder rose, dog rose and hawthorn can be found in the area. For more than 100 years an important part of the property is owned by the family Marggraff from Vught. Since the Second World War, the main management by this family consisted out of doing nothing. As a result of the lack of human interference, the Geelders is in a high natural state and is now one of the most valuable wetlands in the Netherlands.

During the larval stage, Cape lappets feed on a wide variety of African plants and can often be found aggregating in gardens. The caterpillars are brightly coloured and conspicuously hairy, while the bulky adult moths are mostly brown and much less striking in appearance. Distribution and habitat There is little agreement regarding the extent of the Cape lappet moth's range in southern Africa. While all sources agree that its primary geographical home is South Africa, varied sources also state Malawi, Mozambique, and Tanzania. Being able to feed on a wide variety of plants, the caterpillars are common in domestic gardens and also in more remote and wild areas. Morphology Head of Cape lappet caterpillar The adults are large and stocky, with an average wingspan of about . Both hind wings and fore wings are reddish brown. The fore wings are flecked with yellow and bear three wavy white stripes. Females are typically paler in colour and larger than males. Adult moths lack developed mouthparts and therefore do not feed. The antennae of females are deeply pectinate and are the length of the thorax. The larvae are distinctly hairy with rows of orange tufts of long hair along the sides of the body. Arranged at the head are three large coppery tufts and two smaller purple tufts. Along the dorsal side of the caterpillars is a row of black triangles flanked either side by white. Behaviour and life cycle Gregarious as larvae, the caterpillars clump together in numbers. The reason for this behaviour is not well understood, with several proposed theories. For E. capensis at least, aggregating behaviour appears to be of no benefit to the caterpillars in terms of either water or energy conservation, according to a 2013 study. The larvae feed on Acacia cyclops, A. mearnsii, A. saligna, A. karroo, Bauhinia, Celtis africana, Chrysanthemoides monilifera, C. incana, Cupressus macrocarpa, Combretum molle, Eucalyptus macarthurii, E. paniculata, Euclea racemosa, Mangifera indica, Pinus patula, P. radiata, P. elliottii, P. montezumae, Populus, Prunus armeniaca, P. persica, Rhus lancea, Searsia lucida, Rhus crenata, Schinus molle, S. terebinthifolius, Rosa banksiae and Taxodium distichum. The emergence of the adults occurs in early summer. When disturbed, adults are non-aggressive. Taxonomy The Cape lappet moth was first described in 1767 by Carl Linnaeus in the first volume of his 12th edition of Systema Naturae. As with the majority of moths that Linnaeus described, he placed E. capensis in the now obsolete genus Phalaena. The specific epithet he chose, capensis, presumably refers to the moth's distribution in the Western Cape of South Africa.

It is registered as a nature reserve - number 335 055 - under the name of Karlstalschlucht (\\"Karlstal Gorge\\").  Location  The Karlstal lies about 10 kilometres south of the German city of Kaiserslautern near the climatic spa of Trippstadt. There is a footpath running through the Karlstal Gorge, a ravine which is roughly 3 kilometres long.  History  Friedrich Ludwig von Sckell, who laid out the first landscape garden in Germany, was involved in the conversion and extension of the gardens of Trippstadt House in the 1780s. Whilst there, he got to know the nearby Karlstal and described it thus: Subsequently Sckell undertook alterations over the central part of the gorge, a good kilometre long, and dovetailed a trail with little wooden bridges and a wooden pavilion into the valley, so that its near-natural impression was even more heightened. An iron table at the entrance to the valley refers to a royal visit: Ex-king Ludwig I of Bavaria, Grand Duke Louis III of Hesse-Darmstadt and Archduchess Hildegard of Austria, together with their retinue, visited the valley on 9 August 1862.  Landscape  The Karlstal The rocky gorge, through which the Moosalb flows and which is largely natural, contains a large amount of rock debris from the red bunter sandstone of the region, as well as numerous little waterfalls and old deciduous and conifer stands. As a result it is one of those destinations in the Palatine Forest that is promoted by those responsible for tourism. On the left-hand side of the Karlstal valley, is a formerly occupied rock cave which is only accessible on an almost unmetalled path. Above it, on level ground is the Amseldell, an old park-like area from the 19th century that has since been left to decay, but which originally had a maze, a firing range and a hut.Wolfgang Dammbr√ºck (s. Literatur) Other sights in the surrounding area are described in the article on the Moosalb.  Transport  At its western end along the Bieberm√ºhl Railway, there was once a halt called Karlsthal, which through lack of profitability was closed. Since its closure the nearest station has been Schopp.  References  Literature  *  External links  * Palatine Forest Tourism, Climatic spa of Trippstadt in the Palatine Forest: Das Karlstal Category:Nature reserves in Rhineland-Palatinate Category:Landscapes of Rhineland-Palatinate Category:Palatinate Forest Category:Valleys of Rhineland-Palatinate ","title":"Karlstal"},{"id":"40955439","title":"2002 Asian Athletics Championships ‚Äì Men's high jump"},{"id":"40955444","text":"Luigi Pasqualigo (1536‚Äì1576) was a Venetian soldier and man of letters who wrote the play Il Fedele that was adapted by the English playwright Anthony Munday under the title, Fidele and Fortunio (1584).

Around 1623 he left Amsterdam to settle in London, where he found employment with his brother-in-law, the English architect Nicholas Stone, who had married Willem's sister Maria. Stone had been charged with the construction of a number of buildings in classical style designed by Inigo Jones for King Charles I of England. During his stay in England, De Keyser married Walburga Parker. He remained in England until 1640, when the turbulent English political situation forced him to return to Amsterdam.P.C.

He assisted Jacob van Campen in designing and building Amsterdam's grand new town hall (now the Royal Palace) as well as the spire of the adjacent Nieuwe Kerk church. On 20 February 1653 he was dismissed from his post as city mason on charges of fraud. De Keyser was alleged to have altered invoices and paid salaries to persons who were not actually employed.A.W.

Early years Konstantin Manojloviƒá was born in Krnjevo near the town of Velika Plana on December 4, 1890. After completing elementary school, he continued his education at \\"Saint Sava\\" seminary where he graduated in 1910. He then attended the Serbian Music School (now known as the Mokranjac Music School) where he was a student of Stevan Stojanoviƒá Mokranjac. From 1910 to 1912 he worked as a teacher, first in ƒÜuprija then in Belgrade. In 1912, he received a scholarship for his further education in Moscow and Munich. His studies were interrupted twice because of the Balkan Wars. During the First World War, he participated in the Serbian army's retreat through Albania and belonged to the group of Serbian soldiers stationed at Corfu. There, he established a military choir in 1916. In 1917 Manojloviƒá studied at Oxford University, where he gained an appreciation for old vocal polyphony, graduating in 1919 with his work On the Rivers of Babylon. Career Manojloviƒá started composing his Liturgija za mu≈°ki hor (\\"Liturgy for Male Choir\\") in Kragujevac after the start of the First World War, completing it in 1916 during his convalescence at a military hospital in the Albanian town of Fier. During the period 1919‚Äì31, he was choir-master of the Belgrade Choral Society and in the period 1931‚Äì39, at the Mokranjac Society. Manojloviƒá was familiar with all published works on the history of ecclesiastical singing. He was particularly fond of papers written by passionate researchers of Serbian antiquity, Archpriests Lazar Bogdanoviƒá and Dimitrije Ruvarac. He also quoted papers on the state of contemporary singing practice, as well as prefaces in anthologies of ecclesiastical chanting by Tihomir Ostojiƒá, Gavrilo Boljariƒá and Nikola Taj≈°anoviƒá. A conductor of the First Belgrade Singing Society, he also served as the executive secretary of the Belgrade Philharmonic Orchestra (1923‚Äì40) and of the Yugoslav Choral Union (1926‚Äì32). He was involved in the establishment of the Society of Yugoslav Music Authors () Manojloviƒá was also instrumental in the establishment of the Belgrade Music Academy, serving as its first rector in 1937‚Äì39 and working as a teacher there until 1946. For political reasons, he was forced into retirement from the organization. Manojloviƒá and others, such as Mokranjac, Kornelije Stankoviƒá, Petar Konjoviƒá, Miloje Milojeviƒá, and Stevan Hristiƒá, were some of the first composers of Serbia's harmonized religious music. Of his contemporaries, Manojloviƒá was characterized as a traditionalist, along with Svetolik Pascan, Milenko Paunoviƒá, and Sava Seleskoviƒá, while Josip Slavenski was considered a modernist. Some of his Albanian vocal arrangements were for urban songs. Manojloviƒá's 1933 collection of six choral songs based on folk songs from Albania was titled The Songs from the Land of Skenderbeg ().

In 1819, Rostom, aged 20, joined his cousins, David and Vakhtang, in a revolt against the Russian Empire, which had absorbed Imereti in 1810. The revolt spread to Guria and Mingrelia, but was squashed by the Russian troops under General Velyaminov by July 1820. The remaining rebels retreated to the mountains of Racha, where they were finally defeated. Prince David died on the battlefield and Vakhtang fled to the Ottoman Empire. Rostom was captured and, together with his family, sent in exile to Russia proper, where he was enlisted as a private in the Sumsky Hussar Regiment.

According to the Metropolitan Museum of Art catalog by Lewis I. Sharp, the statue was widely acclaimed as one of the finest public monuments in the country. There was criticism from Beecher's family and friends regarding the accuracy of the subject's likeness. Description The monument features a bronze figural group by John Quincy Adams Ward and Barre granite base designed by architect Richard Morris Hunt. The statues depict Beecher, in subordinate positions are a Black female figure, to the left of the base, and, rightward, two Caucasian children (a boy and girl). The monument was cast on May 10, 1890, and dedicated on June 24, 1891. It was conserved via the Adopt-a-Monument Program in 1987.

It is named after the legacy of Dr. Vidya Sagar, M.D[M.R.C. Psych.] 1910-1978, also known as the 'Father of Indian Psychiatry'. Acing his work in the field of mental health, Dr. Vidya Sagar Dewan was the first psychiatrist in India who propagated de- institutionalisation of patients diagnosed with mental illnesses. The foundation and principles laid by him are the basis of mental health services at VIMHANS. The facility provides comprehensive care in the fields of Mental Health Illnesses, Physical Rehabilitation along with Academics, Research and Training. The focus areas at Vimhans are: * Mental Health- Psychiatry, Psychology, Creative Therapies * Neurosciences- Neurosurgery, Neurology, Interventional Neuro Radiology * Rehabilitation: The hospital runs Mental Health and Neuro Rehabilitation Units for Children and Adults. * Mind Body Services in Specialties like: Hypnotherapy, Yoga, NLP, Dietitics and Nutrition * Allied Specialties- Orthopedics, Int Medicine, General & Minimal Invasive Surgery, etc. * Special emphasis on the care of the elderly: Ranging from Acute to Chronic and Home Care as well. * Training : The training programmes at Vimhans include : ::Psychology: Internship programmes for undergraduates and post graduates, and exposure in Creative Therapy ::Psychiatry: DNB Programme (Two Seats) since 2004. ::Train the Trainer Programmes: Regular workshops with School Counselors since 2000. ::Internship and Exposure in Dietitics and Nutrition VIMHANS is the only non- government institution in North India that runs an in-patient facility for persons with mental illness. The services are complemented with infrastructure, facilities, backup support system and medical equipment. Vimhans, as part of its social responsibility runs a rural health care centre in village Saidul Ajaib, Mehrauli, in Delhi. This centre was established in the year 1998. The hospital conducts free medical camps in various disciplines almost every month at the centre and in various slums and villages in the district. Being a tertiary care multi- specialty centre the hospital receives patients from all parts of India and Asian/ Middle Eastern Countries on regular basis for various neurological, rehabilitation and other problems. Controversy and Criticism=North India‚Äôs first multiple sclerosis treatment centre at Vimhans New Delhi's first specialised multiple sclerosis (MS) treatment centre was inaugurated by the Delhi CM Sheila Dikshit at Vimhans in the presence of the patients, caregivers and doctors. The MS center at Vimhans would reportedly be North India's first dedicated MS-care centre where patients will get comprehensive management by a team of experts, including neurologists, psychologists, psychiatrists, physical and occupational therapists, urologists, and radiologists, all under the same roof. http://healthcare.financialexpress.com/latest-updates/1402-north-india-s- first-multiple-sclerosis-treatment-centre-at-vimhans Absence of Free Treatment for Poor Patients In 2001, Times of India reported that Vimhans was in violation with an agreement by the Delhi Government. The agreement stipulated that the hospital has to provide free treatment to 70 percent of its admitted patients. Vimhans ignored this stipulation, and then stated it would provide free treatment to 40 percent of its admitted patients. The latter promise was neither followed through by the trust operating the hospital.http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2001-09-17/delhi/27219918_1_free- treatment-free-patients-hospital Medical Negligence of Female Patient In 2005, Vimhans treated a 43-year-old female patient. The patient suffered a partial paralysis and was admitted to the hospital. During the treatment, the hospital staff mistakenly administered a high dose of steroids into the right arm of the patient. The arm immediately began swelling, the doctors advised that it wasn't dangerous. Eventually, the arm had to be amputated.

Around 83% of Madagascar's vascular plants are found only on the island. These endemics include five plant families, 85% of the over 900 orchid species, around 200 species of palms, and such emblematic species as the traveller's tree, six species of baobab and the Madagascar periwinkle. The high degree of endemism is due to Madagascar's long isolation following its separation from the African and Indian landmasses in the Mesozoic, 150‚Äì160 and 84‚Äì91 million years ago, respectively. However, few plant lineages remain from the ancient Gondwanan flora; most extant plant groups immigrated via across-ocean dispersal well after continental break-up. After its continental separation, Madagascar probably experienced a dry period, and tropical rainforest expanded only later in the Oligocene to Miocene when rainfall increased. Today, humid forests, including the lowland forests, are mainly found on the eastern plateau where abundant rainfall from the Indian Ocean is captured by an escarpment. A large part of the central highlands, in the sub-humid forests ecoregion, is today dominated by grasslands. They are widely seen as result of human landscape transformation but some may be more ancient. Grassland occurs in a mosaic with woodland and bushland, including tapia forest, and hard-leaved thickets on the high mountains. Dry forest and succulent woodland are found in the drier western part and grade into the unique spiny thicket in the southwest, where rainfall is lowest and the wet season shortest. Mangroves occur on the west coast, and a variety of wetland habitats with an adapted flora are found across the island. The first human presence in Madagascar dates only 2000‚Äì4000 years back, and settlement in the interior occurred centuries later. The Malagasy people have used the native flora for various purposes, including food, construction, and medicine. Exotic plants were introduced by early settlers, later traders and French colonialists, and many have become important to agriculture. Among them are rice, the staple dish of Malagasy cuisine grown in terraced fields in the highlands, and greater yam, taro, cowpea, and plantain. Plantation crops include litchi, cloves, coffee, and vanilla, the latter one of the country's main export produce today. More than 1,300 introduced plants are known, of which around 600 have become naturalised, and some invasive. Human population growth and economic activity have put pressure on natural vegetation in the region, especially through massive deforestation. Madagascar's high endemism and species richness coupled with a sharp decrease in primary vegetation make the island a global biodiversity hotspot. To preserve natural habitats, around 10% of the land surface is protected, including the World Heritage sites Tsingy de Bemaraha and the Rainforests of the Atsinanana. While historically mainly European naturalists described Madagascar's flora scientifically, today a number of national and international herbaria, botanical gardens and universities document plant diversity and engage in its conservation. Diversity and endemism Madagascar has been described as \\"one of the most floristically unique places in the world\\". , 343 families of vascular plants and bryophytes, with roughly 12,000 species, were known according to the Catalogue of the plants of Madagascar. Many plant groups are still insufficiently known. Madagascar is the island with the second-highest number of vascular plants, behind New Guinea. Of the vascular plants, 83% are endemic: they are found only in Madagascar. These endemics include five entire plant families: Asteropeiaceae, Barbeuiaceae, Physenaceae, Sarcolaenaceae and Sphaerosepalaceae. As many as 96% of Madagascan trees and shrubs are estimated to be endemic. Vascular plants Angraecum sesquipedale (Darwin's orchid), one of over 900 orchids in Madagascar Among the non-flowering plants, ferns, lycophytes and allies count roughly 570 described species in Madagascar. About half of these are endemic; in the scaly tree fern family Cyatheaceae, native to the humid forests, all but three of 47 species are endemic. Six conifers in genus Podocarpusall endemicand one cycad (Cycas thouarsii), are native to the island. In the flowering plants, basal groups and magnoliids account for some 320 Madagascan species, around 94% of which are endemic. The families most rich in species are Annonaceae, Lauraceae, Monimiaceae, and Myristicaceae, containing mainly trees, shrubs, and lianas, and the predominantly herbaceous pepper family (Piperaceae). Monocots are highly diversified. They include Madagascar's most species-rich plant family, the orchids (Orchidaceae), with over 900 species of which 85% are endemic. Palms (Arecaceae) have around 200 species in Madagascar (most in the large genus Dypsis), more than three times as many as in continental Africa; all but five are endemic. Other large monocot families include the Pandanaceae with 88 endemic pandan (Pandanus) species, mainly found in humid to wet habitats, and the Asphodelaceae, with most species and over 130 endemics in the succulent genus Aloe. Grasses (Poaceae, around 550 species) and sedges (Cyperaceae, around 300) are species- rich, but have lower levels of endemism (40% and 37%, respectively). The endemic traveller's tree (Ravenala madagascariensis), a national emblem and widely planted, is the sole Madagascan species in the family Strelitziaceae. Euphorbia iharanae, an endemic succulent from the north of Madagascar The eudicots account for most of Madagascar's plant diversity. Their most species- rich families on the island are: * Fabaceae (legumes, 662 species ‚Äì 77% endemic), accounting for many trees in humid and dry forests, including rosewood; * Rubiaceae (coffee family, 632 ‚Äì 92%), with notably over 100 endemic Psychotria and 60 endemic Coffea species; * Asteraceae (composite family, 535 ‚Äì 81%), with over 100 endemic species in Helichrysum; * Acanthaceae (acanthus family, 500 ‚Äì 94%), with 90 endemic species in Hypoestes; * Euphorbiaceae (spurge family, 459 ‚Äì 94%), notably the large genera Croton and Euphorbia; * Malvaceae (mallows, 486 ‚Äì 87%), including the large genus Dombeya (17797%) and seven out of nine baobabs (Adansonia), of which six are endemic; * Apocynaceae (dogbane family, 363 ‚Äì 93%), including the Madagascar periwinkle (Catharanthus roseus); * Melastomataceae (melastomes, 341 ‚Äì 98%), mainly trees and shrubs. Non-vascular plants A checklist from 2012 records 751 moss species and infraspecific taxa, 390 liverworts, and three hornworts. About 34% of the mosses and 19% of the liverworts are endemic. It is unknown how many of these species may have gone extinct since their discovery, and a number likely remain to be described. Fungi Many undescribed species of fungi are suspected in Madagascar. A number of edible mushrooms are consumed in the country, especially from the genera Auricularia, Lepiota, Cantharellus (the chanterelles), and Russula (the brittlegills). Most of the ectomycorrhizal species are found in plantations of introduced eucalyptus and pine, but also in native tapia (Uapaca bojeri) woodlands. The chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, responsible for chytridiomycosis, an infectious disease threatening amphibian populations worldwide, was long considered absent from Madagascar. In 2010 it was recorded, however, and has been confirmed since in various areas and in numerous frog families, alerting scientists to a new threat to the island's already endangered frog fauna. Over 500 species of lichens of Madagascar have been documented, but the true number was estimated to be at least twice as high. Wet tropical areas of siliceous bedrock make up approximately two-thirds of the country, and are where most of the lichens have been found. Dry tropical areas of granitic and limestone bedrock make up the other one-third of the country with just over 20 species documented in these habitats. Algae Algae, a diverse group of non-plant photosynthetic organisms, are in general poorly known in Madagascar. A review of freshwater diatoms listed 134 species; most of them have been described from fossil deposits and it is unknown if they have become extinct. It is assumed that Madagascar harbours a rich endemic diatom flora. Diatom deposits from lake sediments have been used to reconstruct paleoclimatic variations on the island. Vegetation types Two maps of Madagascar, showing land cover on the left and topography on the right Madagascar features contrasting and unique vegetation types, determined mainly by topography, climate, and geology. A steep eastern escarpment captures most of the rainfall brought by trade winds from the Indian Ocean. Consequently, the eastern belt harbours most of the humid forests, while the west has a drier vegetation. The rain shadow region in the southwest has a sub-arid climate. The central highlands, above , feature some high mountains, though the Tsaratanana Massif in the north has the highest elevation, namely . Temperatures are highest on the west coast, with annual means of up to , while the high massifs have a cool climate with a annual mean. The geology of Madagascar features mainly igneous and metamorphic basement rocks, with some lava and quartzite in the central and eastern plateaus, while the western part has belts of sandstone, limestone (including the tsingy formations), and unconsolidated sand. The marked east‚Äìcentral‚Äìwest distinction among Madagascan flora was already described by the English naturalist Richard Baron in 1889. Twentieth-century authors, including Henri Perrier de la B√¢thie and Henri Humbert, built upon this concept and proposed several similar classification systems, based on floristic and structural criteria. A classification from 2007, the Atlas of the vegetation of Madagascar, distinguishes 15 vegetation types (including two degraded types and cultivation) based on satellite imagery and ground surveys; they are defined mainly based on vegetation structure and differ in species composition in different parts of the island. They partly correspond to the seven terrestrial ecoregions defined by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) in Madagascar. Humid forests Tropical rainforest covers around 8% of the island, but used to encompass more than twice as much. It ranges from sea level to elevation and is mainly found on the eastern plateaus, on basement rocks with lateritic soils. In the north, humid forest extends west to the Sambirano river basin and islands including Nosy Be. Annual rainfall is up to in areas such as Masoala Peninsulaand the dry season is short or absent. The predominantly evergreen forest, up to , is composed of tree and understory species from various families such as Burseraceae, Ebenaceae, Fabaceae, and Myristicaceae; bamboos and lianas are frequent. Cyclones hit the east coast of Madagascar in some years and can destroy habitats. The WWF classifies the eastern belt of humid forest, below elevation, in the \\"lowland forests\\" ecoregion and the montane forests of the highlands in the \\"sub-humid forests\\" ecoregion. Degraded humid forest (savoka in Malagasy) covers about ten percent of the island. It spans various states of degradation and is composed of forest remnants and planted or otherwise introduced species. It is primarily the result of slash-and-burn cultivation in primary forest. Some forest fragments still harbour a considerable amount of biodiversity. Littoral forest, found in several isolated areas along the eastern coast, covers less than 1% of the land area, on mainly sandy sediments. Climate is humid, with annual rainfall. Littoral forest covers sandy soil forest, marsh forest, and grasslands. Its flora includes various tree families, lianas, and epiphytic orchids and ferns; in the marsh forests, pandans (Pandanus) and the traveller's tree (Ravenala madagascariensis) are common. It is part of the WWF's \\"lowland forests\\" ecoregion. An isolated area of humid forest in the south west, on the eastern slope of the Analavelona massif, is classified as \\"Western humid forest\\" by the Atlas. It occurs on lavas and sand, at elevation. The forest is maintained through condensating moisture from ascending air. It is unprotected but the local population considers it sacred. The WWF includes it in the \\"sub-humid forests\\" ecoregion. Dry forests and thicket Dry forest, accounting for roughly 5% of the surface, is found in the west, from the northern tip of the island to the Mangoky river in the south. It ranges from sea level to in elevation. Climate is sub-humid to dry, with annual rainfall and a dry season of around six months. Geology is varied and can include limestone forming the eroded tsingy outcrops. Vegetation is diverse; it ranges from forest to bushland and includes trees of the Burseraceae, Fabaceae, Euphorbiaceae, and baobab species. The WWF classifies the northern part of this vegetation as \\"dry deciduous forest\\" ecoregion and the southern part, including the northernmost range of Didiereaceae, as \\"succulent woodlands\\" ecoregion. \\"Western sub-humid forest\\" occurs inland in the southwest and covers less than 1% of the surface, mainly on sandstone, at elevation. Climate is sub-humid to sub-arid, with annual rainfall. The vegetation, up to with a closed canopy, includes diverse trees with many endemics such as baobabs (Adansonia), Givotia madagascariensis, and the palm Ravenea madagascariensis. Cutting, clearing and invasive species such as opuntias and agaves threaten this vegetation type. It is part of the WWF's \\"sub-humid forests\\" ecoregion. The driest part of Madagascar in the southwest features the unique \\"spiny forests\\" ecoregion (WWF). They cover ca. 4% of its area, at an elevation below , on limestone and sandstone bedrocks. Mean annual rainfall is very low and concentrated in one month or less. It is a dense thicket composed of plants adapted to dry conditions, notably through succulent stems or leaves transformed into spines. The characteristic plants are the endemic subfamily Didiereoideae, baobabs, and Euphorbia species. A more open coastal bushland within the region is classified separately by the Atlas. Degraded spiny forest accounts for of the surface and is the result of cutting, clearing, and encroachment. Introduced species such as agaves and opuntias are found with remnants of the native flora. Grassland, woodland, and bushland Grasslands dominate a large part of Madagascar, more than 75% according to some authors. Mainly found on the central and western plateaus, they are dominated by C4 grasses such as the common Aristida rufescens and Loudetia simplex and burn regularly. While many authors interpret them as the result of human degradation through tree- felling, cattle raising and intentional burning, it has been suggested that at least some of the grasslands may be primary vegetation. Grassland is often found in a mixture with trees or shrubs, including exotic pine, eucalypt, and cypress. The Atlas distinguishes a \\"wooded grassland‚Äìbushland mosaic\\" covering 23% of the surface and a \\"plateau grassland‚Äìwooded grassland mosaic\\" covering 42%. Both occur on various substrates and account for most of the WWF's \\"sub- humid forests\\" ecoregion. At higher altitudes on thin soil, they grade into an indigenous, hard-leaved vegetation that includes Asteraceae, Ericaceae, Lauraceae, and Podocarpaceae shrubs, among others, and is singled out by the WWF as \\"ericoid thickets\\" ecoregion. An evergreen open forest or woodland type, tapia forest, is found on the western and central plateaus, at altitudes of . It is dominated by the eponymous tapia tree (Uapaca bojeri) and covers less than 1% of the surface. The broad regional climate is sub-humid to sub- arid, but tapia forest is mainly found in drier microclimates. Trees other than tapia include the endemic Asteropeiaceae and Sarcolaenaceae, with a herbaceous understory. Tapia forest is subject to human pressure, but relatively well adapted to fire. It falls in the WWF's \\"sub-humid forests\\" ecoregion. Wetlands Marshes, swamp forests and lakes are found in all regions, along with rivers and streams. Typical species of wet habitats include several endemic Cyperus sedges, ferns, pandans (Pandanus), and the traveller's tree. Two species of water lilies (Nymphaea lotus and N. nouchali) are found in the west and east, respectively. Lagoons are mainly found on the east coast, but also occur in the west; they have a specialised halophyte flora. Peat bogs are restricted to highlands above elevation; their distinct vegetation includes, among others, Sphagnum moss and sundew species (Drosera). Many wetlands have been converted into rice paddies and are otherwise threatened by destruction and pollution. Mangroves occur on the western, Mozambique channel coast, from the very north to just south of the Mangoky river delta. Eleven mangrove tree species are known from Madagascar, of which the most frequent belong to the families Acanthaceae, Lecythidaceae, Lythraceae, Combretaceae, and Rhizophoraceae. Mangrove forests are threatened by encroachment and cutting. The WWF lists the mangroves of Madagascar as separate ecoregion. Origins and evolution=Paleogeography Madagascar's high species richness and endemicity are attributed to its long isolation as a continental island since the Mesozoic era. Once part of the Gondwana supercontinent, Madagascar separated from continental Africa and from the Indian subcontinent around 150‚Äì160 and 84‚Äì91 million years ago, respectively. The Madagascan flora was therefore long seen predominantly as a relict of an old Gondwanan vegetation, separated by vicariance through the continental break-up. Molecular clock analyses however suggest that most plant and other organismal lineages immigrated via across-ocean dispersal, given that they are estimated to have diverged from continental groups well after Gondwana broke up. The only endemic plant lineage on Madagascar old enough to be a possible Gondwana relict appears to be Takhtajania perrieri (Winteraceae). Most extant plant groups have African affinities, consistent with the relatively small distance to the continent, and there are also strong similarities with the Indian Ocean islands of the Comoros, Mascarenes, and Seychelles. There are however also links to other, more distant floras, such as those of India and Malesia. After their separation from Africa, Madagascar and India moved northwards, to a position south of 30¬∞ latitude. During the Paleocene and Eocene, now separated from India, Madagasar moved northwards again and crossed the subtropical ridge. This passage likely induced a dry, desert-like climate across the island, which later contracted to what is today the sub-arid spiny thicket in the southwest. Humid forests probably established since the Oligocene, when India had cleared the eastern seaway, allowing trade winds to bring in rainfall, and Madagascar had moved north of the subtropical ridge. The intensification of the Indian Ocean monsoon system after around eight million years ago is believed to have further favoured the expansion of humid and sub-humid forests in the Late Miocene, especially in the northern Sambirano region. Some of the grasslands may also date to the Late Miocene, when there was a global grassland expansion. Species evolution Several hypotheses exist as to how plants and other organisms have diversified into so many species in Madagascar. They mainly assume either that species diverged in parapatry by gradually adapting to different environmental conditions on the island, for example dry versus humid, or lowland versus montane habitats, or that barriers such as large rivers, mountain ranges, or open land between forest fragments, favoured allopatric speciation. A Madagascan lineage of Euphorbia occurs across the island, but some species evolved succulent leaves, stems and tubers in adaptation to arid conditions. In contrast, endemic tree ferns (Cyathea) all evolved under very similar conditions in Madagascan humid forests, through three recent radiations in the Pliocene. Madagascar's fauna is thought to have coevolved to a certain extent with its flora: The famous plant‚Äìpollinator mutualism predicted by Charles Darwin, between the orchid Angraecum sesquipedale and the moth Xanthopan morganii, is found on the island. Highly unstable rainfall in Madagascar was suggested to have created unpredictable patterns of flowering and fruiting in plants; this in turn would have narrowed opportunities for flower- and fruit-feeding animals and could explain their relatively low numbers in Madagascar. Among these, lemurs are the most important, but the historic extinctions of giant lemurs probably deprived some large-seeded plants of their seed dispersers. The extinct Madagascan megafauna also included grazers such as two giant tortoises (Aldabrachelys) and the Malagasy hippopotamuses, but it is unclear to what extent their habitats resembled today's widespread grasslands. Exploration and documentation=Early naturalists Histoire de la grande isle Madagascar by √âtienne de Flacourt (1658) was the first detailed written account on Madagascar. Madagascar and its natural history remained relatively unknown outside the island before the 17th century. Its only overseas connections were occasional Arab, Portuguese, Dutch, and English sailors, who brought home anecdotes and tales about the fabulous nature of Madagascar. With the growing influence of the French in the Indian Ocean, it was mainly French naturalists that documented Madagascar's flora in the following centuries. √âtienne de Flacourt, envoy of France at the military post of Fort Dauphin (Tolagnaro) in the south of Madagascar from 1648 to 1655, wrote the first detailed account of the island, Histoire de la grande isle Madagascar (1658), with a chapter dedicated to the flora. He was the first to mention the endemic pitcher plant Nepenthes madagascariensis and the Madagascar periwinkle. About one century later, in 1770, French naturalists and voyagers Philibert Commerson and Pierre Sonnerat visited the island from the Isle de France (now Mauritius). They collected and described a number of plant species, and many of Commerson's specimens were described later by Jean- Baptiste de Lamarck and Jean Louis Marie Poiret in France. Sonnerat described, among others, the emblematic traveller's tree. Another contemporary, Louis- Marie Aubert du Petit-Thouars, also visited Madagascar from the Isle de France; he collected on the island for six months and wrote, among others, Histoire des v√©g√©taux recueillis dans les √Æles australes d'Afrique and a work on orchids of Madagascar and the Mascarenes. 19th to 20th century French naturalist Alfred Grandidier was a preeminent 19th-century authority on Malagasy wildlife. His first visit in 1865 was followed by several other expeditions. He produced an atlas of the island and, in 1885, published L'Histoire physique, naturelle et politique de Madagascar, which would comprise 39 volumes. Although his main contributions were in zoology, he was also a prolific plant collector; several plants were named after him, including Grandidier's baobab (Adansonia grandidieri) and the endemic succulent genus Didierea. The British missionary and naturalist Richard Baron, Grandidier's contemporary, lived in Madagascar from 1872 to 1907 where he also collected plants and discovered up to 1,000 new species; many of his specimens were described by Kew botanist John Gilbert Baker. Baron was the first to catalogue Madagascar's vascular flora in his Compendium des plantes malgaches, including over 4,700 species and varieties known at that time. Sartidia perrieri, a now-extinct grass species collected only once, by Henri Perrier de la B√¢thie in 1914, and described by Aim√©e Camus During the French colonial period (1897 to 1958), Henri Perrier de la B√¢thie was a major botanist in Madagascar. Beginning study in 1896, he compiled a large herbarium which he later donated to the National Museum of Natural History in Paris. Among his publications were notably the first classification of the island's vegetation, La v√©g√©tation malgache (1921), and Biog√©ographie des plantes de Madagascar (1936), and he directed the publication of the Catalogue des plantes de Madagascar in 29 volumes. His contemporary and collaborator Henri Humbert, a professor in Algiers and later in Paris, made ten expeditions to Madagascar and, in 1936, initiated and edited the monograph series Flore de Madagascar et des Comores. A number of other important botanists, working in the colonial era through to Madagascar's independence, described more than 200 species each: Aim√©e Camus lived in France and specialised in grasses; Ren√© Capuron was a major contributor to the woody plant flora; and Jean Bosser, director of the French ORSTOM institute in Antananarivo, worked with grasses, sedges, and orchids. Roger Heim was one of the major mycologists working in Madagascar. Research in the 21st century Today, national and international research institutions are documenting the flora of Madagascar. The Botanical and Zoological Garden of Tsimbazaza hosts a botanical garden and the country's largest herbarium with over 80,000 specimens. The FO.FI.FA (Center for Research on Rural Development) herbarium has some 60,000 specimens of primarily woody plants; a number of them and those of the Tsimbazaza herbarium have been digitised and are available online through JSTOR and Tropicos. The University of Antananarivo has a department for plant biology and ecology. Outside the country, Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, is one of the leading institutions in the revision of Madagascar's plant families; it also maintains the Kew Madagascar Conservation Centre and cooperates with the Silo National des Graines Foresti√®res to build a seed bank of Madagascan plants in the Millennium Seed Bank project. The National Museum of Natural History in Paris has traditionally been one of the centres of research on the flora of Madagascar. It holds a herbarium with roughly 700,000 Malagasy plant specimens and a seed bank and living collection, and continues to edit the Flore de Madagascar et des Comores series begun by Humbert in 1936. The Missouri Botanical Garden maintains the Catalogue of the plants of Madagascar, a major online resource, and also has a permanent base in Madagascar. Human impact Madagascar was colonised rather recently compared to other landmasses, with first evidence for humansarrived from either Africa or Asiadating to 2,300 or perhaps 4,000 years before present. It is assumed that humans first stayed near the coast and penetrated into the interior only several centuries later. The settlers had a profound impact on the long-isolated environment of Madagascar through land clearing and fire, introduction of zebu cattle, and probably hunting to extinction the native megafauna including, among others, elephant birds, giant lemurs and giant tortoises. The first Europeans arrived in the 16th century, starting an age of overseas exchange. Population growth and transformation of the landscape was particularly rapid since the mid-20th century. Uses of native species The Malagasy valiha zither is made from bamboo. The native flora of Madagascar has been and still is used for a variety of purposes by the Malagasy people. More than a hundred plants used locally and commercially were described at the end of the 19th century by the English naturalist Richard Baron. These included many timber trees such as native ebony (Diospyros) and rosewood (Dalbergia) species, the raffia palm Raphia farinifera used for fibre, dyeing plants, as well as medicinal and edible plants. The traveller's tree has various uses in the east of Madagascar, chiefly as building material. Madagascar's national instrument valiha is made from bamboo and lent its name to the endemic genus Valiha. Yams (Dioscorea) in Madagascar include introduced, widely cultivated species as well as some 30 endemics, all edible. Edible mushrooms, including endemic species, are collected and sold locally (see above, Diversity and endemism: Non-vascular plants and fungi). Many native plant species are used as herbal remedies for a variety of afflictions. An ethnobotanical study in the southwestern littoral forest, for instance, found 152 native plants used locally as medicine, and countrywide, over 230 plant species have been used as traditional malaria treatments. The diverse flora of Madagascar holds potential for natural product research and drug production on an industrial scale; the Madagascar periwinkle (Cataranthus roseus), a source of alkaloids used in the treatment of different cancers, is a famous example. Agriculture One of the characteristic features of agriculture in Madagascar is the widespread cultivation of rice. The cereal is a staple of Malagasy cuisine and has been an important export crop since pre-colonial times. It was likely introduced with early Austronesian settlers, and archaeobotanical remains evidence its presence in Madagascar at least by the 11th century. Both the indica and japonica varieties were introduced early on. Rice was first cultivated in mud flats and marshes near the coast, reaching the highlands much later. Its widespread cultivation in terraced fields was promoted with the expansion of the Imerina kingdom in the 19th century. Land conversion for rice cultivation has been an important cause of wetlands loss. Other major crops, such as greater yam, coconut, taro and turmeric are also believed to have been brought in by early settlers from Asia. Other crops have a likely African origin, such as cowpea, bambara groundnut, oil palm, and tamarind. Some crops like teff, sorghum, common millet and plantain may have been present before colonisation, but it is possible that humans brought new cultivars. Arab traders presumably brought fruits such as mango, pomegranate, and grapes. Later European traders and colonists introduced crops like litchi and avocado and promoted the cultivation of exports like cloves, coconut, coffee and vanilla in plantations. Today Madagascar is the primary vanilla- producing country worldwide. Forestry in Madagascar involves many exotic species such as eucalypts, pines and acacias. The traditional slash-and-burn agriculture (tavy), practised for centuries, today accelerates the loss of primary forests as populations grow (see below, Threats and conservation). Introduced plants More than 1,300 exotic plants have been reported in Madagascar, with the legumes (Fabaceae) the most frequent family. This represents around 10% relative to the native flora, a ratio lower than in many islands and closer to what is known for continental floras. Many exotic plant species have been introduced for agriculture or other uses. Around 600 species have naturalised and some are considered invasive. A notorious example is the South American water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes), which spread widely through subtropical and tropical regions and is considered a serious plant pest in wetlands. In general, invasive plants spread mostly in already disturbed, secondary vegetation, and the remaining primary forests of the east appear little affected. A prickly pear cactus, Opuntia monacantha, was introduced to southwest Madagascar in the late 18th century by French colonialists, who used it as natural fence to protect military forts and gardens. The cactus quickly spread and found use as cattle feed by Antandroy pastoralists. In the early 20th century, cochineals were introduced as a biological control for the plant, which had become a nuisance; they rapidly eradicated most of the cacti. This probably led to famine among the Antandroy people, although some authors challenge the causal link between famine and cactus eradication. Today, several Opuntia species are again present mainly in the south, spreading into native vegetation in some areas. The prickly pear illustrates the dilemma of plant introductions: while many authors see exotic plants as a threat to the native flora, others argue that they have not yet been linked directly to the extinction of a native species, and that some may actually provide economic or ecological benefits. A number of plants native to Madagascar have become invasive in other regions, such as the traveller's tree in R√©union and the flamboyant tree (Delonix regia) in various tropical countries. Threats and conservation Illegal logging of rosewood in the north of Madagascar Madagascar, together with its neighbouring islands, is considered a biodiversity hotspot because of its high species richness and endemism coupled with a dramatic decrease of primary vegetation. Six of the seven WWF ecoregions in Madagascar (see Vegetation types) are considered \\"critical/endangered\\". Data on the distribution and status of many native plants in Madagascar are still lacking, but a 2011 Red List assessed 1,676 endemic vascular plant species and found over 1,000 of them to be endangered or critically endangered. Rapid human population increase and economic activity entail habitat loss and fragmentation, in particular massive deforestation. Forest cover decreased by around 40% from the 1950s to 2000, and the remaining forests are highly fragmented. Slash-and-burn cultivation has a long tradition but with an ever-denser population, forest is cut faster than it regrows, especially in the humid east. In addition, illegal logging of luxury timber species such as rosewood and ebony increased especially with the 2009 Malagasy political crisis. Rare plants, such as endemic succulents and baobabs, are threatened by harvest and trade for horticulture, food, or cosmetics. Global warming is expected to reduce or shift climatically suitable areas for plant species and threatens coastal habitats, such as littoral forests, through rising sea levels. Conservation of natural habitats in Madagascar is concentrated in over about ten percent of the total land surfaceof national parks and other nature reserves, an area that has tripled from 2003 to 2013. These protected areas include the World Heritage sites Tsingy de Bemaraha and the Rainforests of the Atsinanana. Some critically endangered plant species have been grown ex situ in nursery programmes, and seeds have been collected and stored in the Millennium Seed Bank project. Madagascar is the country with the highest proportion of its flora listed in the CITES convention, which aims to control trade in endangered species. To reduce unsustainable deforestation by local communities, better land-use planning, crop intensification and diversification, promotion of non-timber forest products, economic empowerment through land tenure security and access to credit, and family planning have been proposed. The restoration of wildlife corridors between fragmented habitats to support species migration has been proposed for climate change adaptation. To reduce species loss along coastal areas targeted for titanium extraction, agreements with the QMM mining company include the setting aside of conservation areas and habitat restoration.

In the genocide during the Bangladesh Liberation War, he was killed by the Pakistan Army.  Early life and career  Das was born in Uttar Paraldi village of greater Barisal district, now in Gaurnadi Upazila of Barisal District. Early in his career Das was a renowned wrestler and weightlifter. He also knew a little bit of magic. He used to perform tricks in schools and college without any payment. A maternal uncle enrolled Das in Lion Circus. At the Lion Circus, Das performed rare feats like cutting iron rods using teeth, bending iron rods using neck, weightlifting, throwing javelins and dagger boards. In 1948, Das formed his own circus known as the Royal Pakistan Circus.  Death  In 1971, during the Bangladesh Liberation War the Pakistan Army set up a military camp at Gaurnadi College, adjacent to the house of Das. The collaborators alleged that Das had been training rebels under the guise of circus. Fearing a military raid, Das fled with his family to Kodaldhowa in present-day Agailjhara Upazila in Barisal District, leaving behind the circus equipment and the trained animals including elephants, tigers, bears and deer. The Pakistan Army looted the equipment and killed all the animals, including the elephant named Madhubala the star performer of Royal Pakistan Circus. The Das family began to stay in a boat in the Ketnar Bil near Kodaldhowa village. In June, the Pakistan Army raided Kodaldhowa. When the soldiers went after the Das family in a boat, they jumped into the water in order to escape. While the two sons of Das swam to safety, Das and his wife were shot dead by the soldiers. The soldiers looted the gold and jewelry.  Legacy  After the liberation of Bangladesh, Laxman Das' son Arun and Biren came together to form the circus again. The circus was named Laxman Das Circus in the memory of their father.

The term at first was used only by members of the Schutzstaffel, but later was used by the Reich police, justice system, and state bureaucracy.  Folkish community  With the F√ºhrerprinzip (leadership principle) of Hitler and the Nazi party supremacy over Germany, the fundamental political life of Nazism was primarily focused on the Aryan race, but also the pan-German nationalism that was to make sure the Germans belonged to the Volksgemeinschaft (national community). The term \\"foreign\\" was not used in reference to migrants but rather racially defined as those who were German citizens but not of German or related blood. In 1935, after the Third Reich introduced the Nuremberg race laws, the foreign races who were defined as Jews, Gypsies, and blacks were banned from the civil service, from having sexual relations with Aryans, and were given \\"non-Aryan\\" status. These laws affected not only non-Aryans, but also opponents of the Nazis, who were similarly banned from the civil service.  People of Central Europe and Eastern Europe  The Nazi policy of Lebensraum (living space) in the East called for Germans to settle there and the whole area to undergo a process of Germanization for the creation of a Greater Germanic Reich. The people of these areas were targeted as \\"foreign Nationalists\\", not \\"foreign races\\", since Slavs were not a distinct race, even according to Nazi racial science (Hans F. K. G√ºnther - called - race-G√ºnther - 1930). Thus, the notion of foreign was used not only for people who were classified as racially different but also people who were not part of the German community. In Mein Kampf, Hitler criticized previous Germanization towards ethnic Poles, whom he regarded as belonging to a non-Germanic \\"foreign race\\". In his 1928 unpublished book Zweites Buch, Hitler stated that the Nazis would never Germanize any foreign elements such as the Poles or Czechs as it would lead to a racial weakening of the German people. According to Nazi ideology, Slavic people were uncultured and inferior. The Nazis feared the fertility of the Slavs and called for a depopulation policy towards them. A secret plan called the General Plan East implemented the enslavement, expulsion, and possible extermination of most people of both Central and Eastern Europe.http://gplanost.x-berg.de/gplanost.html Foreign workers were given the status of Ost-Arbeiter, with estimates putting their numbers between 3 and 5.5 million.http://magazines.russ.ru/zvezda/2005/6/po8.html The possibility of naturalization came at different levels, however, applied only to annexed eastern territories. Naturalized - but with possibility of withdrawal - were so-called German people...foreign-born Germans living in occupied and annexed areas, as well as in Poland, these Germans were related through marriage, language, and culture. This served to attract so-called racially valuable children, according to Nazi racial theorists, who were to undergo Germanization and be taken to the Reich and raised as Germans. The aim was to give the kingdom German citizenship since the 1935 race laws introduced these people after a period of probation and changed their foreign national status. (This possibility of naturalization, however, did not apply to the \\"General\\".)http://gplanost.x-berg.de/wprim.html  History of the term  Already in the interwar period of the Weimar Republic the term \\"fremdv√∂lkisch\\" appeared in 1926 as part of legal literature regarding the \\"legal status of minorities\\". According to some theorists, Danes and Lithuanians were considered \\"fremdv√∂lkisch\\", in contrast to Mazury, Friesen, and the Ruhr Poles.  The term after World War II  After the end of the war, many young men who were of Polish ancestry in the context of dealing with the term \\"foreign nationalists\\" in the \\"Annexed Eastern Territories\\" of the Third Reich were recruited into the German Wehrmacht, after they received German citizenship revoked. It must however be mentioned that many children and grandchildren of those effected, they do not fall prey to general proscription in the present Poland.

Schooling of girls in Malta indicates: ‚Äú...evidence of remarkable commitment to the full development of girls in a global society.‚Äù  Politics and suffrage  Fifteen general elections have been contested since the granting of universal suffrage in Malta in 1947. Only 73 women have contested in these elections. The number of men, on the other hand, has exceeded 1000. The number of women contesting general elections has, however, increased over the years. In fact, the 1998 elections saw 24 women candidates participating, the highest number to date, with six of these getting elected, registering a 25 percent success rate. The smallest number of female candidates was in 1947, numbering only two. However, the result showed a 50 percent success rate, since Agatha Barbara was elected. The election of 1955 saw the lowest percentage of women candidates being elected with a 14.3 percent success rate, when only one candidate out of seven was elected. Following this, the success rate rose slowly until, in the 1976 election, there was a 42.3 percent success rate for women candidates. At that time, three out of seven contestants were returned. These were two Labour candidates Agatha Barbara and Evelyn Bonaci, while Anne Agius Ferrante from the PN obtained a seat following a by-election. However, the success rates of the first and third elections won by female candidates have never been matched up till now (in 1947 it reached 50 percent while in 1951 it was 57.1 percent). The rate slowly rose to 42.9 percent in 1976, but this momentum was lost and success fell to 20 percent in 1981. It rose to just 28.6 percent in 2003.

As a two-year-old in 2013, he won all three of his races, including the Group 1 Racing Post Trophy. In 2014 he finished eighth in the 2000 Guineas and was then runner-up to Australia in the Derby before going on to win the Classic St. Leger Stakes. He was owned by Paul Smith and trained during his racing career by Roger Varian. Background Kingston Hill is a grey colt bred by Ridgecourt Stud and foaled on 15 January 2011. He was one of the first crop of foals of Mastercraftsman, which also included graded winners The Grey Gatsby, Amazing Maria and Craftsman. As a two-year-old Mastercraftsman won the Group 1 Phoenix Stakes and National Stakes and was crowned Cartier Champion Two-year-old Colt in 2008. As a three-year-old he went on to record victories in the Irish 2,000 Guineas and St James's Palace Stakes before being retired to stud. Kingston Hill's dam is Audacieuse, a daughter of Rainbow Quest. Audacieuse was trained by √âlie Lellouche to win the Group 3 Prix de Flore in 2000. Kingston Hill was purchased by Charles Gordon-Watson for 70,000 guineas at Tattersalls October Yearlings Sale. He is owned by Paul Smith and trained by Roger Varian. Racing career=2013: two-year-old season Kingston Hill made his racecourse debut on 21 September 2013 in a seven-furlong maiden race at Newbury. He appeared to show his inexperience in the race, but readily beat odds-on favourite Exchequer by one and a half lengths. Three weeks later Kingston Hill was sent off at the odds of 15/2 in the Autumn Stakes at Newmarket. He was held up near the rear of the field in the early stages of the race, but progress through the pack to take the lead inside the final furlong, going on to win by two lengths from pre-race favourite Oklahoma City. On 26 October, Kingston Hill was one of eleven horses to contest the Racing Post Trophy at Doncaster, after being supplemented for the race at a cost of ¬£17,500. He was ridden by regular jockey Andrea Atzeni and started as the 7/2 favourite. Unlike in his previous race, Kingston Hill was positioned just behind the leaders after the start. He took the lead with over one furlong still to run and pulled clear to win by four and a half lengths from the Aidan O'Brien-trained colt Johann Strauss. After the race his odds were cut for the Derby and 2000 Guineas in 2014. Commenting on Kingston Hill's targets for the 2014 season, Varian said after the race \\"We'll have to see how he winters and what he's like in the spring. People have said is he a 10-furlong, mile-and-a- half horse, but he has the pace for a mile and travels so well... He has good acceleration and will be in everything. You've got to have an open book with him. We'll have a good eye on the Guineas. Whether he runs before or goes straight there or bypasses the Guineas we'll have to wait and see.\\" 2014: three-year-old season On his first appearance as a three-year-old, Kingston Hill started at odds of 10/1 for the 2000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile course at Newmarket on 3 May. He was held up in the early stages and, despite making some progress in the final quarter mile, never threatened the leaders, finishing eighth behind Night of Thunder. On 7 June, Kington Hill started the 15/2 second favourite for the 235th running of the Derby over one and a half miles at Epsom Downs Racecourse. Atzeni positioned the colt just behind the leaders and turned into the straight in third place behind Our Channel and Kingfisher. He took the lead two furlongs from the finish but was overtaken by Australia a furlong out and finished second, beaten one and a quarter lengths, with Romsdal three and a quarter lengths back in third. Kingston Hill was scheduled to renew his rivalry with Australia in the Irish Derby at the Curragh Racecourse three weeks later, but was withdrawn by Varian who felt that the ground at the Irish course was too firm.Racing Post On 5 July, Kington Hill was matched against older horses for the first time in the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown Park Racecourse. Ridden by Frankie Dettori he was restrained in the early stages before making progress in the straight, but was unable to catch the leaders and finished fourth behind Mukhadram, beaten four lengths by the winner. It was expected that the colt would run next in the Great Voltigeur Stakes at York Racecourse, but as in Ireland, he was withdrawn on account of the firm ground. On 13 September, Kingston Hill started 9/4 favourite for the St Leger at Doncaster, despite doubts about his ability to cope with the firm ground. His twelve opponents included Romsdal, Snow Sky (Gordon Stakes) and Hartnell (Queen's Vase). Atzeni restrained the colt towards the rear of the field before moving up on the outside to make his challenge in the straight. He made rapid progress to take the lead in the closing stages and won from Romsdal and Snow Sky. Kingston Hill hung left towards the rail as he made his challenge and appeared to impede the run of Snow Sky, but after a stewards' inquiry the result remained unaltered. Atzeni said \\"I rode him like the best horse in the race. He travelled brilliant and he is so laid back he just goes to sleep. When I pulled him out he was always going to get there.\\"Racing Post Varian, who, like Atzeni, was winning his first classic, indicated that the colt could now be aimed at the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe.https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/sep/13/kingston-hill-st- leger-roger-varian-grey-gatsby-irish-champion-stakes On 5 October, Kingston Hill attempted to become the first St Leger winner to follow up in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. He started at odds of 30/1, having been given an unfavourable draw on the far outside of the twenty runner field. The colt broke quickly and Atzeni tracked across to the inside to settle in second place behind the pacemaker Montviron. He remained among the leaders throughout the race and kept on well in the closing stages to finish fourth of the twenty runners behind Treve, Flintshire and Taghrooda. 2015: four-year-old season In March 2015 it was announced that Kingston Hill had sustained an injury to his left foreleg and would miss the first half of the season. In July Varian revealed that the colt had suffered a fresh injury to the same leg and was unlikely to race in 2015. On 18 September it was announced that the colt would not race again and would be retired to stand as a breeding stallion at the Coolmore Stud. Assessment and awards At the end of the season Kingston Hill was voted Cartier Champion Two-year-old Colt. In the official ratings published in January 2014, Kingston Hill was rated the second-best European two-year-old of 2013, two pounds behind Toormore.

Some particular topics out of many include; operations defined on matrices (such as matrix addition, matrix multiplication and operations derived from these), functions of matrices (such as matrix exponentiation and matrix logarithm, and even sines and cosines etc. of matrices), and the eigenvalues of matrices (eigendecomposition of a matrix, eigenvalue perturbation theory). Matrix spaces The set of all m√ón matrices over a field F denoted in this article Mmn(F) form a vector space. Examples of F include the set of rational numbers ‚Ñö, the real numbers ‚Ñù, and set of complex numbers ‚ÑÇ. The spaces Mmn(F) and Mpq(F) are different spaces if m and p are unequal, and if n and q are unequal; for instance M32(F) ‚â† M23(F). Two m√ón matrices A and B in Mmn(F) can be added together to form another matrix in the space Mmn(F): :\\\\mathbf{A},\\\\mathbf{B} \\\\in M_{mn}(F)\\\\,,\\\\quad \\\\mathbf{A} + \\\\mathbf{B} \\\\in M_{mn}(F) and multiplied by a Œ± in F, to obtain another matrix in Mmn(F): :\\\\alpha \\\\in F \\\\,,\\\\quad \\\\alpha \\\\mathbf{A} \\\\in M_{mn}(F) Combining these two properties, a linear combination of matrices A and B are in Mmn(F) is another matrix in Mmn(F): :\\\\alpha \\\\mathbf{A} + \\\\beta\\\\mathbf{B} \\\\in M_{mn}(F) where Œ± and Œ≤ are numbers in F. Any matrix can be expressed as a linear combination of basis matrices, which play the role of the basis vectors for the matrix space. For example, for the set of 2√ó2 matrices over the field of real numbers, M22(‚Ñù), one legitimate basis set of matrices is: :\\\\begin{pmatrix}1&0\\\\0&0\\\\end{pmatrix}\\\\,,\\\\quad \\\\begin{pmatrix}0&1\\\\0&0\\\\end{pmatrix}\\\\,,\\\\quad \\\\begin{pmatrix}0&0\\\\1&0\\\\end{pmatrix}\\\\,,\\\\quad \\\\begin{pmatrix}0&0\\\\0&1\\\\end{pmatrix}\\\\,, because any 2√ó2 matrix can be expressed as: :\\\\begin{pmatrix}a&b;\\\\c&d;\\\\end{pmatrix}=a \\\\begin{pmatrix}1&0\\\\0&0\\\\end{pmatrix} +b\\\\begin{pmatrix}0&1\\\\0&0\\\\end{pmatrix} +c\\\\begin{pmatrix}0&0\\\\1&0\\\\end{pmatrix} +d\\\\begin{pmatrix}0&0\\\\0&1\\\\end{pmatrix}\\\\,, where a, b, c,d are all real numbers. This idea applies to other fields and matrices of higher dimensions. Determinants The determinant of a square matrix is an important property. The determinant indicates if a matrix is invertible (i.e. the inverse of a matrix exists when the determinant is nonzero). Determinants are used for finding eigenvalues of matrices (see below), and for solving a system of linear equations (see Cramer's rule). Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrices=Definitions An n√ón matrix A has eigenvectors x and eigenvalues Œª defined by the relation: :\\\\mathbf{A}\\\\mathbf{x} = \\\\lambda \\\\mathbf{x} In words, the matrix multiplication of A followed by an eigenvector x (here an n-dimensional column matrix), is the same as multiplying the eigenvector by the eigenvalue. For an n√ón matrix, there are n eigenvalues. The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial: :p_\\\\mathbf{A}(\\\\lambda) = \\\\det(\\\\mathbf{A} - \\\\lambda \\\\mathbf{I}) = 0 where I is the n√ón identity matrix. Roots of polynomials, in this context the eigenvalues, can all be different, or some may be equal (in which case eigenvalue has multiplicity, the number of times an eigenvalue occurs). After solving for the eigenvalues, the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalues can be found by the defining equation. Perturbations of eigenvalues=Matrix similarity Two n√ón matrices A and B are similar if they are related by a similarity transformation: :\\\\mathbf{B} = \\\\mathbf{P}\\\\mathbf{A}\\\\mathbf{P}^{-1} The matrix P is called a similarity matrix, and is necessarily invertible. Unitary similarity=Canonical forms=Row echelon formJordan normal formWeyr canonical formFrobenius normal form=Triangular factorization=LU decomposition LU decomposition splits a matrix into a matrix product of an upper triangular matrix and a lower triangle matrix. Matrix norms Since matrices form vector spaces, one can form axioms (analogous to those of vectors) to define a \\"size\\" of a particular matrix. The norm of a matrix is a positive real number. Definition and axioms For all matrices A and B in Mmn(F), and all numbers Œ± in F, a matrix norm, delimited by double vertical bars  ... , fulfills:Some authors, e.g. Horn and Johnson, use triple vertical bars instead of double: A. *Nonnegative: ::\\\\ \\\\mathbf{A} \\\\ \\\\ge 0 :with equality only for A = 0, the zero matrix. *Scalar multiplication: ::alpha \\\\mathbf{A}\\\\=\\\\alpha mathbf{A}\\\\ *The triangular inequality: ::mathbf{A}+\\\\mathbf{B}\\\\ \\\\leq mathbf{A}\\\\+mathbf{B}\\\\ Frobenius norm The Frobenius norm is analogous to the dot product of Euclidean vectors; multiply matrix elements entry-wise, add up the results, then take the positive square root: :mathbf{A}\\\\ = \\\\sqrt{\\\\mathbf{A}:\\\\mathbf{A}} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\sum_{i=1}^m \\\\sum_{j=1}^n (A_{ij})^2} It is defined for matrices of any dimension (i.e. no restriction to square matrices). Positive definite and semidefinite matricesFunctions Matrix elements are not restricted to constant numbers, they can be mathematical variables. Functions of matrices A functions of a matrix takes in a matrix, and return something else (a number, vector, matrix, etc...). Matrix-valued functions A matrix valued function takes in something (a number, vector, matrix, etc...) and returns a matrix.

All four known species of Neofavolus are known from temperate regions and unknown from the tropics. Neofavolus alveolaris, the type species, is widely distributed in the temperate areas of the Northern Hemisphere, while N. cremeoalbidus and N. mikawai are known only from limited areas of eastern Asia. The most recent addition to the genus (transferred from Lentinus), N. suavissimus, is found in North America, Europe, and Japan. Description The fruit bodies of Neofavolus species are annual, and have a cylindrical stipe that is usually laterally situated. Their caps are kidney-shaped to semicircular, circular in centrally stipitate specimens. The cap surface is either covered with flatted scales or is smooth, azonate, white to cream or brownish. The context, which is up to 1 cm thick, ranges from fleshy-tough to leathery when fresh, to brittle or corky to leathery in dried specimens. Pores on the underside of the cap vary in size, but are typically diamond shaped and may be elongated radially. N. suavissimus is the single Neofavolus fungus with a hymenium featuring gills rather than pores. N. suavissimus Neofavolus has a dimitic hyphal system, with both generative and the more predominant skeletal- binding hyphae. The generative hyphae have clamp connections. Skeletal-binding hyphae are arboriform, and hyaline. The cap cuticle comprises a cutis made of hyaline to brown agglutinated and parallel generative hyphae. These are distinct from the contextual hyphae, which largely comprise non-agglutinated skeletal-binding hyphae. The basidia are club-shaped, with four sterigmata. Spores of Neofavolus fungi are cylindrical, thin-walled, smooth, hyaline, and non-amyloid. Species *Neofavolus alveolaris (DC.) Sotome & T.Hatt. (2016) *Neofavolus cremeoalbidus Sotome & T.Hatt.

Right: the Haardt (highlit) and above that (north) the Leininger Sporn View from the Felsenberg-Berntal Nature Reserve The Leininger Sporn is a highly prominent ridge in the northeast of the Palatinate Forest in western Germany, mainly composed of the rock formations of the Middle and Upper Bunter. It forms the western edge of Upper Rhine Plain between Gr√ºnstadt in the north and Leistadt, a village in the county of Bad Durkheim, in the southeast.Landscape information system of the Rhineland- Palatine Nature Conservation Administration:Leininger Sporn landscape fact file. Retrieved 10 November 2012 In the natural region system of the German Central Uplands it is considered one of the four sub-units of the Middle Palatinate Forest.  Geography = Location  The Leininger Sporn lies between the valleys of the river Isenach in the south and the Eckbach stream in the north, and has an area of around 44.8 km¬≤.Landesamt f√ºr Umwelt, Wasserwirtschaft und Gewerbeaufsicht Rheinland-Pfalz (pub.): Naturr√§umliche Gliederung von Rheinland-Pfalz . Retrieved 12 November 2012 From north to south it is about 10 kilometres long, and from east to west it is about 4 to 5, and at its northern tip, only about 2 to 3 kilometres wide. The outer boundary of this hill ridge runs from the Kleinkarlbach in the northeast, southwards along the edge of the Rhine Graben, before swinging southwest at Leistadt. Here it follows the Lambrecht Fault, a fracture line that crosses the Isenach valley at Hausen between Peterskopf and Teufelsstein, and separates the mountain range of the Haardt from the Leininger Sporn and the Limburg-Durkheim Forest that lies to the southwest. At the Alten Schmelz it turns north and reaches the valley of the H√∂ninger Bach and village of H√∂ningen after crossing the Rahnfels hill (517 m AMSL (NHN)). Here the natural region transitions smoothly in the west into the foothills of the Inner Palatine Forest and, in the northwest, into the Stumpfwald and the forest clearances of the Eisenberg Basin. From Altleiningen the boundary follows the valley of the Eckbach as far as Kleinkarlbach in a northeasterly direction.Landesamt f√ºr Vermessung und Geobasisinformation Rheinland-Pfalz (Hrsg): Topographic map 1:25,000 Bad D√ºrkheim and Area. Self-pub. by the state office, 6th edn., Koblenz, 2003  Name  The name \\"Leininger Sporn\\" was coined by the geographer, Adalbert Pem√∂ller,Adalbert Pem√∂ller: Die naturr√§umlichen Einheiten auf Blatt 160 Landau i. d. Pfalz. Geographische Landesaufnahme 1 : 200,000 Naturr√§umliche Gliederung Deutschlands. pp. 7‚Äì8 who in the 1960s developed a detailed internal subdivision of the Palatine Forest for the Handbook of Natural Region Divisions of Germany. In doing so, Pem√∂ller gave the historic name, Leiningerland, for this natural sub-region, which in turn was derived from the formerly important noble family of the House of Leiningen. From a geographic perspective, the Leiningerland, and the low mountain country of the Leininger Sporn are also part of the wine route region and the zone of low, rolling hills on the edge of the mountain region and the Upper Rhine Plain.  Landscape character  The relief of the natural environment is characterized by a distinctive ridge with steep hillsides, extending from the Pickelhaube (360.7 m above sea level (NHN)) in the north to the Rahnfels and the Heidenfels (496.0 m) in the south, and which drops steeply to the Eckbach valley, the Upper Rhine Plain and, especially, into the Isenach valley by 250 to 300 metres in altitude. Rivers both large and small have cut deeply into the sandstone beds, so that the landscape has a varied topography with V-shaped valleys, rock formations and cliffs. Larger valleys include the Langental to the northwest of the spur and the Krumbach valley beginning at the Ungeheuersee and running in a northeasterly direction as far as the Kleinkarlbach stream. In the south, on the other hand, the hill range is only drained by a few smaller streams that flow in narrow V-shaped valleys into the Isenach. View from the Felsenberg-Berntal Nature Reserve looking southwest over Leistadt to the Peterskopf The landscape of the Leininger Sporn is mainly characterized by dense forest which, in the east, is mainly dominated by conifers, especially pine monocultures or mixed stands of pine and mixed beech whose ground flora is often composed of heather, simple grasses and blueberry bushes. These pine forests were created in the 19th and 20th centuries through targeted reforestation of land that had been used for intensive farming over long periods of time - for example for the production of wooden poles for viticulture and had become over-exploited wasteland.Michael Geiger et al. (eds): Der Pf√§lzerwald im geographischen √úberblick. In: Der Pf√§lzerwald, ein Portr√§t einer Landschaft. Verlag Pf√§lzische Landeskunde, Landau/Pf., 1987, p. 19. In addition to these typical Haardt forests, chestnuts are also found in warmer sites at the eastern foot of the hills, often occurring in large stands.Klaus Meyer: Die W√§lder der Haardt: gestern ‚Äì heute ‚Äì morgen. S. 250‚Äì251 Wine and fruit growing also demonstrate the favourable climate of Weinstra√üe region and create a varied landscape alternating with foothills of the Haardt Forest. . The forest areas in the west of this natural region, by contrast, are of somewhat different composition. Here, inter alia in the area of the Rahnfels and Heidenfels, there are larger mixed stands with a higher proportion of Hardwood and a more balanced age range, so that these areas in terms of forest cover and composition are similar to the remaining natural areas of the Central Palatinate Forest.Edmund Mainberger: Der Wald. In: Michael Geiger u. a. (Hrsg.): Der Pf√§lzerwald, Portr√§t einer Landschaft. Verlag Pf√§lzische Landeskunde, Landau/Pf., 1987, pp. 101‚Äì126. Human settlement activity is restricted to the peripheral regions of the Leininger Sporn; the hill country itself is not settled. One area that stands out is an isolated clearing at the northeastern edge of the spur in the municipality of Battenberg, which includes Battenberg Castle, at a height of about 300 metres above sea level (NHN). This open area is mainly used for agriculture, since the dominating loam-clay soils, a weathering product of the erosion of Upper Bunter sandstone are rich in nutrients and so, unlike other regions of the Middle Palatinate Forest, allow higher yields. In contrast, the formerly widespread vineyards are in decline, something that is apparent from the old vineyard terraces in the north of the municipal territory. In addition, orchards and waste land can be found on hillsides in the parish of Battenberg. A geological feature and classified as natural monument, are the Blitzr√∂hren below Battenberg Castle. These are tubular iron bands of rock, embedded in an ochre-coloured sandstone rock face several metres high caused and by precipitation and the sintered formation of iron solutions.  Historic iron region  To the west, settlements are concentrated in the valleys of the Eckbach, with the village and castle of Altleiningen, and the H√∂ninger Bach with the village of H√∂ningen and ruins of a former monastery, encouraged by the former ironworks. In places, there are recoverable iron ore deposits geologically dependent on faults along the edge of the Leininger Sporn. The Eckbach valley was part of the historic iron processing of the region, e.g. there was a big ironworks below Altleiningen (Maihof-Drahtzug). The stream was impounded to create reservoirs for the ironworks and also drove several sawmills. Upstream, it has the character of a meadow valley.

It forms the central part of the Palatine Forest in the Palatinate region.  Geography  Location of the Frankenweide (orange) within the Palatine Forest The Frankenweide is a single forest that, today, covers an area of a good 200 km¬≤. Much of it is a plateau at an elevation of about 380‚Äì, which climbs steadily from north to south. Individual hill summits rise prominently from the plateau, which is framed by deeply incised valleys. In the south the Frankenweide is bounded by the valley of the Queich, in the east by the Wellbach stream and its northern projection. There it is adjoined by the imperial forest (Reichswald) of Kaiserslautern. In the northwest the Moosalb stream forms the border, and in the southwest, it is bounded by Gr√§fenstein Land. From north to south the region is divided into Lower Frankenweide (Untere Frankenweide) with its municipality of Waldleiningen, Middle Frankenweide (Mittlere Frankenweide) and Eschkopf, and Upper Frankenweide (Obere Frankenweide) around the hamlet of Hermersbergerhof which is part of the municipality of Wilgartswiesen. The highest points of the area lie in the Middle and Upper Frankenweide, along which the watershed between the Upper Rhine and the Middle Rhine/Moselle runs. These high points are the Eschkopf and the Mosisberg (each 609 m), the Hortenkopf (606 m) and the Wei√üenberg (610 m). In a high hollow southeast of the Mosisberg summit there was once a raised bog, the Mosisbruch, which was fed by a two-kilometre-long stream that emptied into the upper Wellbach shortly thereafter. At the Hortenkopf the watershed turns towards the southwest, heading in the direction of Gr√§fenstein Castle, hence the Wei√üenberg is no longer on the watershed.  History  The ruins of the Falkenburg The name Frankenweide (\\"Frankish pasture\\") emerged, as it suggests, in the Frankish period, at the latest in the 6th century. At that time the woods were completely unsettled and were partly used for the grazing of animals, mainly domestic pigs and goats. When the presumably Frankish counts of Leiningen were first mentioned in the 12th century, they were responsible for the management of the Frankenweide. In the 13th century, the knight, John of Wilenstein, after whom the hamlet of Johanniskreuz is named, was the instigator of several feuds. Although the House of Wittelsbach from Palatinate-Zweibr√ºcken also had estates and titles in the Frankenweide for a time, the Leiningen head office (Oberamt) at the castle of Falkenburg near Wilgartswiesen remained administratively responsible until France conquered the Electoral Palatine territories west of the Rhine after the French Revolution in the 1790s and annexed them in 1801. Shortly beforehand, in 1785, the Frankenweide as a whole had transferred formally to the County of Leiningen. During its history, the Frankenweide repeatedly lost land, in total about 100 km¬≤. In the east in the 12th century the Elmstein Forest around the upper Speyerbach valley was partitioned off. In 1304 King Albert of Habsburg granted the large area in the southeast - which lay between the valleys of the Wellbach and Eu√üerbach from the forester's lodge, Forsthaus Taubensuhl, in the north to the Queich valley in the south - to the imperial city of Annweiler; today the area is called the Annweiler Municipal Forest (Annweiler B√ºrgerwald). In 1602 the Esthal Forest in the northeast was given to the fief of Erfenstein. The present region of Frankenweide belongs mainly to the counties of Kaiserslautern und S√ºdwestpfalz.  Economy and Infrastructure = Settlement  The Upper Frankenweide: view from the Luitpold Tower of the Wei√üenberg to the north When, in the 9th century, the Palatine, which still belonged to Middle Francia, opened more and more monasteries, the edge of the Palatinate Forest gradually became increasingly settled. This did not affect the Frankenweide, however, which lay in the heart of the mountains. For a long time the only outpost of civilization was Hermersbergerhof founded by Hornbach Abbey and mentioned as early as 828 A.D. Over the centuries, foresters' lodges and charcoal burners' cottages were built here and there, and the foresters' base of Hofst√§tten was built by the Leiningen authorities and mentioned first in 1379. Excavations at Mosisbruch near the Wellbach valley showed that a settlement must have existed here too from the 11th to the 14th century. But the authorities in Wilgartswiesen, whose territory today include large parts of the Frankenweide, was too far away to be able to successfully plan and development the area. As a result of the Thirty Years' War even the few populated places were abandoned in the first half of the 17th century and it was not until around 1785 that the foresters' village of Waldleiningen was laid out at the instigation of Prince Carl Frederick William of Leiningen- Hardenburg, which remained the only independent municipality in the Frankenweide. Today less than a thousand people live in this remote region.  Transport  With its central communication hub at Johanniskreuz, Frankenweide was a transit route between the Upper Rhine Valley and what is now Lorraine from the earliest times. At that time, when roads followed the ridges wherever possible, ways branched off the main route towards the monasteries of Wissembourg Abbey and Hornbach as well as the Imperial Palace at Kaiserslautern. The northern route of the Palatine Way of St. James crossed the northern part of the Frankenweide. Today footpaths and roads often follow the courses of the old ways. However, the Frankenweide is no longer mainly approached in an east-west direction, but on the winding B 48, which climbs up from the B 10 federal highway to the south through the Wellbach valley to Johanniskreuz, the only settlement on the whole route, and then runs on to join the B 37 near Hochspeyer to the north.  Leisure and tourism  House of Sustainability The plateau with its extensive forests is a destination for hikers. All Palatinate Forest Club long distance paths marked with a cross and that radiate across the entire Palatinate, meet at Johanniskreuz in the heart of the Frankenweide. There are viewing towers on the Wei√üenberg and the Eschkopf. For mountain bikers there are courses at the Palatine Forest Mountain Bike Park and in the neighbouring region of Holzland. \\"Palatine World Axis\\" on the Ro√ür√ºck near Waldleiningen Johanniskreuz, with its House of Sustainability and a few other houses, mainly hotels and restaurants, is the touristic centre of the Frankenweide. The Palatine Catholics Day and woodland services take place here and, on Sundays, especially in good weather, hundreds of bikers meet here. On the Hermersbergerhof, whose six-kilometre-long approach road between Wilgartswiesen and Hauenstein branches off the B 10 abzweigt and then continues as a narrow lane for ten kilometres to the Landstra√üe from Leimen to Johanniskreuz, is used for winter sports in good snow conditions; but due to the increasingly mild winters the skilift was dismantled in the 1990s. A toboggan run still exists, however. One tourist attraction is the landmark built in the 1860s on the 459-metre-high Ro√ür√ºck near Waldleiningen by the Kingdom of Bavaria which became known locally as the Palatine World Axis (P√§lzer Weltachs). It became the subject of local poet, Paul M√ºnch, in his well-known Palatine poem. In 1964 a passage from his poem was inscribed on a nearby rock.

It runs Torbay Hospital. The area is seen as pioneering in the English NHS because of the work done with Torbay and Southern Devon Health and Care NHS Trust to integrate health and social care. In November 2013 it was selected as one of 14 Pioneer site for integrated care development. The former South Devon Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust took over Torbay and Southern Devon Health and Care NHS Trust forming a new organisation in October 2015. It is the first organisation in England which provides both acute and community healthcare and adult social care services. Management The trust's Chief Executive, Dr Paula Vasco-Knight, was suspended in February 2014 after allegations that she improperly gave her daughter's boyfriend a job as equality and diversity manager in July 2012 were upheld by an Employment tribunal. This followed the resignation of the trust Chair Peter Hildrew, and his acting replacement Topsy Murray. Following the tribunal Dr Vasco-Knight resigned from her position as NHS England‚Äôs national lead for equality and diversity. She resigned from the trust in June 2014. Her doctorate was not fact not in medicine (she had at one time been a nurse) but was purely honorary. In the UK, it has always been considered \\"infra-dig\\" to use the title \\"Dr.\\" if not a medical doctor (or bachelor of medicine) or an academic (in any field). In March 2017, the 53-year old Vasco-Knight was given a 16-month prison sentence, suspended for two years and ordered to do 250 hours unpaid work for an offence of fraud. Her husband was also sentenced on a similar count after both pleaded guilty at Exeter Crown Court. Mairead McAlinden, former Chief Executive of the Southern Health and Social Care Health Trust was appointed Chief Executive in January 2015. It set up a joint venture with Health Innovation Partners, owned by Arcadis and Morgan Sindall Group, in August 2018. The plan is to build new health and wellbeing centres in Dartmouth and Teignmouth, and to redevelop emergency department at Torbay Hospital. Performance Four-hour target in the emergency department quarterly figures from NHS England Data from https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/ae-waiting-times- and-activity/ The trust did well in the 2014 cancer patient experience survey and has agreed to pair up with North Middlesex University Hospital NHS Trust, which did badly, in a scheme intended to \\"spread and accelerate innovative practice via peer to peer support and learning\\". The trust was one of 26 responsible for half of the national growth in patients waiting more than four hours in accident and emergency over the 2014/5 winter. The trust asked for ¬£14million capital funding to refurbish some of its ten operating theatres in July 2018. Subsequently the air handling system in two of them failed, so they had to be closed and the waiting list for surgery grew, as did the trust's deficit.

Found in the western United States, the mushroom is characterized by its stout fruit body including blue-tinted cap margin and stipe, blue-grey to bluish green gills, and odor of rancid meal. Taxonomy The species was first described by Orson K. Miller in 1984 from collections he made in Payette National Forest, in the Rocky Mountains of central Idaho in the early 1980s. Description Fruit bodies of Hygrophorus caeruleus have broadly convex caps that are in diameter. They are cream in color, with a blue tint, especially around the margin. The cap surface is felt-like and moist, and covered with a coarse network of cracks and small crevices. The gills, colored bluish-green to gray, have a close to somewhat distant spacing and an adnate to slightly decurrent attachment to the stipe. There are two tiers of lamellulae (short gills) interspersed between the gills. Like most Hygrophorus species, crushed gills have a waxy feel. The stipe measures long by thick and tapers abruptly at the base. Usually somewhat twisted, its surface comprises longitudinally arranged flattened fibrils. Its color is bluish-green to cream at the base. Near the top, it is somewhat pruinose (as in covered with a dusting of fine white powder), while at the base, it is attached to fine white rhizomorphs. The dingy cream flesh bruises a fading bluish-gray to blue-green when injured, and smells strongly of rancid meal. The spore print is white, while spores are elliptical, thin-walled, hyaline, and measure 2.5‚Äì5 ¬µm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored and measure 35‚Äì45 by 7‚Äì8 ¬µm. Habitat and distribution The fruit bodies of Hygrophorus caeruleus grow in scattered groups under Douglas fir, Grand Fir, and Engelmann spruce, typically partially buried in the forest floor.

It arises because the temperature of a gas changes as pressure changes. The experiment directly yields the heat capacity ratio or adiabatic index of the gas, which is the ratio of the heat capacity at constant pressure to heat capacity at constant volume. The results are sometimes also known as the isentropic expansion factor. Background If a gas is compressed adiabatically, i.e. without outflow of heat from the system, the temperature rises (due to the pressure increase) at a higher rate with respect to isothermal compression, where the performed work is dissipated as heat. The exponent, \\\\kappa, with which the expansion of the gas can be calculated by the application of heat is called the isentropic - or adiabatic coefficient. Its value is determined by the R√ºchardt experiment. An adiabatic and reversible running state change is isentropic (entropy S remains the same as temperature T changes). The technique is usually an adiabatic change of state. For example, a steam turbine is not isentropic, as friction, choke and shock processes produce entropy. Experiment R√ºchardt experiment, Glass vessel with piston and Logger Pro P,V,T sensors A typical experiment, consists of a glass tube of volume V, and of cross-section A, which is open on one of its end. A ball (or sometimes a piston) of mass m with the same cross-section, creating an air- tight seal, is allowed to fall under gravity g. The entrapped gas is first compressed by the weight of the piston, which leads to an increase in temperature. In the course of the piston falling, a gas cushion is created, and the piston bounces. Harmonic oscillation occurs, which slowly damps. The result is a rapid sequence of expansion and compression of the gas. The picture shows a revised version of the original R√ºchardt setup: the sphere oscillating inside the tube is here replaced by a \\"breast-pump\\" which acts as an oscillating glass-piston; in this new setup three sensors allow to measure in real-time the piston oscillations as well as the pressure and temperature oscillations of the air inside the bottle (more details may be found in ) Conceptual diagram of the experiment. According to Figure 1, the piston inside the tube is in equilibrium if the pressure P inside the glass bottle is equal to the sum of the atmospheric pressure P0 and the pressure increase due to the piston weight : When the piston moves beyond the equilibrium by a distance dx, the pressure changes by dp. A force F will be exerted on the piston, equal to According to Newton's second law of motion, this force will create an acceleration a equal to As this process is adiabatic, the equation for ideal gas (Poisson's equation) is: It follows using differentiation from the equation above that: If the piston moves by a distance d x in the glass tube, the corresponding change in volume will be By substituting equation into equation , we can rewrite as follows: Solving this equation and rearranging terms yields the differential equation of a harmonic oscillation from which the angular frequency œâ can be deduced: }} From this, the period T of harmonic oscillation performed by the ball is: Measuring the period of oscillation T and the relative pressure P in the tube yields the equation for the adiabatic exponent: List of various versions of the R√ºchardt experiment In 1929, Rinkel proposed a different method to calculate \\\\gamma while using the R√ºchardt apparatus: he noted that it may be shown that the vertical distance L which the sphere falls before it begin to rise is: L=\\\\frac {2mgV}{PA^2\\\\gamma}, so \\\\gamma may be calculated from measured values of L, m, V, P and A. In 1951, Koehler and later, in 1972 Flammersfeld introduced a trick in the original R√ºchardt setup, to increase the number of oscillations that are limited by the unavoidable friction-damping and gas leak (through the piston-tube seal): they made a thin hole on the tube (at half-height) and provided a gas-feeding pump to keep the pressure inside the vessel constant. By properly trimming the gas inlet flux (through a throttling valve) they obtained the following result: during the oscillations the piston is pushed-up by the gas overpressure until it crosses the hole position; then the gas leakage through the hole reduces the pressure, and the piston falls back. The force acting onto the piston varies at a rate that is regulated by the piston oscillation frequency leading to forced oscillation; fine adjustment of the throttle valve allows to achieve maximum amplitude at resonance. In 1958, Christy and Rieser used only a gas-feeding pump to stabilize the gas pressure. A slightly different solution was found in 1964 by Hafner who used a tapered tube (conical: slightly larger at the top). In 1959, Taylor used a column of mercury oscillating inside a U-shaped tube instead of the R√ºchardt sphere. In 1964, Donnally and Jensen used a variable load attached to the R√ºchardt sphere in order to allows frequency measurements with different oscillating mass. In 1967, Lerner suggested a modified version of the Taylor method (with mercury replaced by water). In 1979, Smith reported a simplified version of the complex R√ºchardt-resonance method, originally invented by Clark and Katz, in which an oscillating magnetic piston is driven into resonance by an external coil. In 1988, Connolly suggested the use of a photogate to measure more precisely the frequency of the R√ºchardt sphere. In 2001, Severn and Steffensen used a pressure transducer to monitor the pressure oscillations in the original R√ºchardt setup. In 2001, Torzo, Delfitto, Pecori and Scatturin implemented the version of R√ºchardt apparatus (shown in the top picture) using three sensors: a sonar that monitors the breast-pump oscillations, and pressure and temperature sensors that monitor the changes in pressure and temperature inside the glass vessel.

NCGS is included in the spectrum of gluten-related disorders. The definition and diagnostic criteria of non-celiac gluten sensitivity were debated and established by three consensus conferences. The pathogenesis of NCGS is not yet well understood, but the activation of the innate immune system, the direct cytotoxic effects of gluten and probably other wheat components, are implicated. There is evidence that not only gliadin (the main cytotoxic antigen of gluten), but also other proteins named ATIs which are present in gluten-containing cereals (wheat, rye, barley, and their derivatives) may have a role in the development of symptoms. ATIs are potent activators of the innate immune system. FODMAPs, especially fructans, are present in small amounts in gluten-containing grains and have been identified as a possible cause of some gastrointestinal symptoms in NCGS patients. As of 2019, reviews have concluded that although FODMAPs may play a role in NCGS, they explain only certain gastrointestinal symptoms, such as bloating, but not the extra-digestive symptoms that people with NCGS may develop, such as neurological disorders, fibromyalgia, psychological disturbances, and dermatitis. For these reasons, NCGS is a controversial clinical condition and some authors still question it. It has been suggested that \\"non-celiac wheat sensitivity\\" is a more appropriate term, without forgetting that other gluten- containing cereals are implicated in the development of symptoms. NCGS is the most common syndrome of gluten-related disorders with prevalence rates between 0.5%‚Äì13% in the general population. As no biomarker for diagnosing this condition is available, its diagnosis is made by exclusion of other gluten- related disorders, namely by excluding celiac disease and wheat allergy. Many people have not been diagnosed following strict criteria and there is a \\"fad component\\" to the recent rise in popularity of the gluten-free diet, which leads to debate surrounding the evidence for this condition, its relationship to celiac disease and to irritable bowel syndrome. People with non-celiac gluten sensitivity remain habitually in a \\"no man's land\\", without being recognized by the specialists and lacking the adequate medical care and treatment. Most of these people have a long history of health complaints and unsuccessful consultations with numerous physicians, and this is the reason why many of them end up resorting to a gluten-free diet and a self-diagnosis of gluten sensitivity.  Signs and symptoms  Reported symptoms of NCGS are similar to those of celiac disease, with most patients reporting both gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal symptoms. In the \\"classical\\" presentation of NCGS, gastrointestinal symptoms are similar to those of irritable bowel syndrome, and are also not distinguishable from those of wheat allergy, but there is a different interval between exposure to wheat and onset of symptoms. Wheat allergy has a fast onset (from minutes to hours) after the consumption of food containing wheat and can be anaphylaxic.  Gastrointestinal  Gastrointestinal symptoms may include any of the following: abdominal pain, bloating, bowel habit abnormalities (either diarrhea or constipation), nausea, aerophagia, flatulence, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and aphthous stomatitis.  Extraintestinal  NCGS can cause a wide range of extraintestinal symptoms, which can be the only manifestation of NCGS in absence of gastrointestinal symptoms. These include any of the following: headache, migraine, \\"foggy mind\\", fatigue, fibromyalgia, joint and muscle pain, leg or arm numbness, tingling of the extremities, dermatitis (eczema or skin rash), atopic disorders such as asthma, rhinitis, other allergies, depression, anxiety, iron-deficiency anemia, folate deficiency, or autoimmune diseases. A man with gluten ataxia: previous situation and evolution after three months of gluten-free diet NCGS is also linked to a wide spectrum of neurological and psychiatric disorders, including ataxia, schizophrenia, epilepsy, peripheral neuropathy, encephalopathy, vascular dementia, eating disorders, autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), hallucinations (so-called \\"gluten psychosis\\"), and various movement disorders (restless legs syndrome, chorea, parkinsonism, Tourette syndrome, palatal tremor, myoclonus, dystonia, opsoclonus myoclonus syndrome, paroxysms, dyskinesia, myorhythmia, myokymia). Above 20% of people with NCGS have IgE-mediated allergy to one or more inhalants, foods, or metals, among which most common are mites, graminaceae, parietaria, cat or dog hair, shellfish, and nickel. Approximately 35% of patients suffer other food intolerances, mainly lactose intolerance.  Causes  The pathogenesis of NCGS is not yet well understood, but the activation of the innate immune system, the direct cytotoxic effects of gluten, and probably the cytotoxicity of other wheat molecules are implicated. Besides gluten, other components in wheat, rye, barley, and their derivatives, including amylasetrypsin inhibitors (ATIs) and FODMAPs, may cause symptoms.  Gluten  It was hypothesized that gluten, as occurs in celiac disease, is the cause of NCGS. In addition to its ability to elicit abnormal responses of the immune system, in vitro studies on cell cultures showed that gluten is cytotoxic and causes direct intestinal damage. Gluten and gliadin promote cell apoptosis (a form of programmed cell death) and reduce the synthesis of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and proteins, leading to a reduction in the viability of cells. Gluten alters cellular morphology and motility, cytoskeleton organization, oxidative balance and intercellular contact (tight junction proteins).  Other proteins  Some people may have a reaction to other proteins (Œ±-amylase/trypsin inhibitors [ATIs]) present in gluten-containing cereals that are able to inhibit amylase and trypsin. They have been identified as the possible activator of the innate immune system in celiac disease and NCGS. ATIs are part of the plant's natural defence against insects and may cause toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-mediated intestinal inflammation in humans. These TLR4-stimulating activities of ATIs are limited to gluten-containing cereals (wheat, rye, barley, and derivatives) and may induce innate immunity in people with celiac disease or NCGS. ATIs resist proteolytic digestion. ATIs are about 2%‚Äì4% of the total protein in modern wheat and are present in commercial gluten. A 2017 study in mice demonstrated that ATIs exacerbate preexisting inflammation and may also worsen it at extraintestinal sites. This may explain why there is an increase of inflammation in people with preexisting diseases upon ingestion of ATI-containing grains. Modern wheat cultivation, by breeding for high ATI content, may play a role in the onset and course of disorders such as celiac disease and gluten sensitivity. However, it has been questioned whether there is sufficient empirical evidence to support this claim, because as of 2018 we lack studies that directly compare modern wheat versus ancient cultivars with low ATI content (such as einkorn wheat) in people with NCGS. Wheat germ agglutinin is also considered to be a possible trigger of NCGS-like symptoms.  FODMAPs  FODMAPs (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols) that are present in gluten- containing grains (mainly fructans) have been identified as a possible cause of gastrointestinal symptoms in people with NCGS, in place of, or in addition to, gluten. The amount of fructans in gluten-containing cereals is relatively small and their role has been controversial. In rye they account for 3.6%‚Äì6.6% of dry matter, 0.7%‚Äì2.9% in wheat, and barley contains only trace amounts. They are only minor sources of FODMAPs when eaten in the usual standard amounts in the daily diet. Wheat and rye may comprise a major source of fructans when consumed in large amounts. They may cause mild wheat intolerance at most, limited to certain gastrointestinal symptoms, such as bloating, but do not justify the NCGS extradigestive symptoms. A 2018 review concluded that although fructan intolerance may play a role in NCGS, it only explains some gastrointestinal symptoms, but not the extradigestive symptoms that people with NCGS may develop, such as neurological disorders, fibromyalgia, psychological disturbances, and dermatitis. FODMAPs cause digestive symptoms when the person is hypersensitive to luminal distension. A 2019 review concluded that wheat fructans can cause certain IBS-like symptoms, such as bloating, but are unlikely to cause immune activation or extra-digestive symptoms. Many people with NCGS report resolution of their symptoms after removing gluten-containing cereals while continue to eat fruits and vegetables with high FODMAPs content.  Diagnosis  Absence of reliable biomarkers and the fact that some people do not have digestive symptoms make the recognition and diagnosis of non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) difficult. Diagnosis is generally performed only by exclusion criteria. NCGS diagnostic recommendations have been established by several consensus conferences. Exclusion of celiac disease and wheat allergy is important because these two conditions also appear in people who experience symptoms similar to those of NCGS, which improve with a gluten withdrawal and worsen after gluten consumption. The onset of NCGS symptoms may be delayed hours to a few days after gluten ingestion, whereas in celiac disease it can take days to weeks. Wheat allergy has a fast onset (from minutes to hours) after the consumption of food containing wheat and can lead to anaphylaxis. The presence of related extraintestinal manifestations has been suggested to be a feature of NCGS. When symptoms are limited to gastrointestinal effects, there may be an overlap with wheat allergy, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and (less likely) intolerance to FODMAPs. Proposed criteria for a diagnosis of NCGS suggest an improvement of gastrointestinal symptoms and extra-intestinal manifestations higher than 30% with a gluten-free diet (GFD), assessed through a rating scale, is needed to make a clinical diagnosis of NCGS. To exclude a placebo effect, a double-blind placebo-controlled gluten challenge is a useful tool, although it is expensive and complicated for routine clinical use, and so is usually performed in research studies. These suggestions were incorporated in the Salerno expert consensus on diagnostic criteria for NCGS. These recommend assessment of the response to a 6-week trial of a gluten-free diet using a defined rating scale (Step 1), followed by a double-blind, placebo-controlled challenge of gluten (or placebo) for a week of each (Step 2). A variation of greater than 30% in the main symptoms when challenged by gluten or placebo is needed for a positive result. Further research on possible biomarkers was also identified.  Differential diagnosis  Examinations evaluating celiac disease and wheat allergy must be performed before patients remove gluten from their diet. It is critical to make a clear distinction between celiac disease and NCGS. = Celiac disease = The main goal in diagnosing NCGS is to exclude celiac disease. NCGS and celiac disease cannot be separated in diagnosis because many gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal symptoms are similar in both diseases, and there are people with celiac disease having negative serology (absence of specific celiac disease antibodies in serum) or without villus atrophy. There is no test capable of eliminating a diagnosis of a celiac disease, but such a diagnosis is unlikely without confirming HLA-DQ2 and/or HLA-DQ8 haplotypes. The prevalence of undiagnosed celiac disease increased 4-fold during the past half century with most cases remaining unrecognized, undiagnosed and untreated, leaving celiac people with the risk of long-term complications. Some people with NCGS may indeed have celiac disease. A 2015 systematic review found that 20% of people with NCGS presenting with HLA-DQ2 and/or HLA-DQ8 haplotypes, negative serology, and normal histology or duodenal lymphocytosis had celiac disease. The presence of autoimmune symptoms in people with NCGS suggests the possibility of undiagnosed celiac disease. Autoimmune diseases typically associated with celiac disease are diabetes mellitus type 1, thyroiditis, gluten ataxia, psoriasis, vitiligo, autoimmune hepatitis, dermatitis herpetiformis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, and others. To evaluate the possible presence of celiac disease, specific serology and duodenal biopsies are required while the person is still on a diet that includes gluten.  Serological markers  Serological CD markers (IgA tissue transglutaminase , IgA endomysial [EmA] and IgG deamidated gliadin peptide [DGP] antibodies) are always negative in those with NCGS; in addition to specific IgA autoantibody levels, it is necessary to determine total IgA levels. IgG antibodies should be checked in selective IgA deficiency, which can be associated with celiac disease and occurs in up to 1 in 40 celiac patients. Nevertheless, the absence of serological markers does not certainly exclude celiac disease. In those with celiac disease before diagnosis (on a gluten-containing diet), celiac disease serological markers are not always present. As the age of diagnosis increases, these antibody titers decrease, and may be low or even negative in older children and adults. The absence of celiac disease-specific antibodies is more common in patients without villous atrophy who only have duodenal lymphocytosis (Marsh 1 lesions) and who responds to a gluten-free diet with histological and symptomatic improvement.  Duodenal biopsies  According to the diagnostic criteria established by the consensus conferences (2011 and 2013), it is necessary to perform duodenal biopsies to exclude celiac disease in symptomatic people with negative specific celiac disease antibodies. Due to the patchiness of the celiac disease lesions, four or more biopsies are taken from the second and third parts of the duodenum, and at least one from the duodenal bulb. Even in the same biopsy fragments, different degrees of pathology may exist. Duodenal biopsies in people with NCGS are always almost normal - an essential parameter for diagnosis of NCGS, although is generally accepted that a subgroup of people with NGCS may have an increased number of duodenal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) ( ‚â•25/100 enterocytes), which represent Marsh I lesions. Nevertheless, Marsh I is considered compatible with celiac disease and the most frequent cause of these findings, especially in people positive for HLA DQ2 and/or DQ8 haplotypes, is celiac disease, with a prevalence of 16-43%. In people with duodenal lymphocytosis - following guidelines from the European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) - a high count of celiac disease cells (or CD/CD3 ratio) in immunohistochemical assessment of biopsies, or the presence of IgA anti-TG2 and/or anti-endomysial intestinal deposits, might be specific markers for celiac disease. Catassi and Fasano proposed in 2010 that in patients without celiac disease antibodies, either lymphocytic infiltration associated with IgA subepithelial deposits or a histological response to a gluten-free diet, could support a diagnosis of celiac disease. = Wheat allergy = The clinical presentation may be sufficient in most cases to distinguish a wheat allergy from other entities. It is excluded when there are normal levels of serum IgE antibodies to gluten proteins and wheat fractions, and no skin reaction to prick tests for wheat allergy. Nevertheless, these tests are not always completely reliable. If an allergic reaction can not be clearly identified, the diagnosis should be confirmed by food provocation tests, ideally performed in a double-blinded and placebo- controlled manner. Delayed allergic reactions may occur with these type of tests, which have to be negative over time, but there are no international consensus statements on diagnosing delayed wheat/food-related symptoms. Usually, reactions that appear between two hours and five days after the oral challenge are considered delayed. Mucosal challenge followed by confocal endomicroscopy is a complementary diagnostic technique, but this technology is not yet generally available and remains experimental.  Other tests  Evaluating the presence of antigliadin antibodies (AGA) can be a useful complementary diagnostic test. Up to 50% NCGS patients may have elevated AGA IgG antibodies, but rarely AGA IgA antibodies (only 7% of the cases). In these patients, unlike in those with celiac disease, the IgG AGA became undetectable within 6 months of using a gluten-free diet.  People already on a gluten- free diet  Many people remove gluten from the diet after a long history of health complaints and unsuccessful consultations with numerous physicians, who simply consider them to be suffering from irritable bowel syndrome, or even before seeking medical attention. This fact can diminish the CD serological markers titers and may attenuate the inflammatory changes found in the duodenal biopsies. In these cases, patients should be tested for the presence of HLA-DQ2/DQ8 genetic markers because a negative HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 result has a high negative predictive value for celiac disease. If these markers are positive, it is advisable to undertake a gluten challenge under medical supervision, followed by serology and duodenal biopsies. However, gluten challenge protocols have significant limitations, because a symptomatic relapse generally precedes the onset of a serological and histological relapse, and therefore becomes unacceptable for many patients. Gluten challenge is also discouraged before the age of 5 years and during pubertal growth. It remains unclear what daily intake of gluten is adequate and how long the gluten challenge should last. Some protocols recommend eating a maximum of 10 g of gluten per day for 6 weeks. Nevertheless, recent studies have shown that a 2-week challenge of 3 g of gluten per day may induce histological and serological abnormalities in most adults with proven celiac disease. This new proposed protocol has shown higher tolerability and compliance. It has been calculated that its application in secondary-care gastrointestinal practice would identify celiac disease in 7% of patients referred for suspected NCGS, while the remaining 93% would be confirmed as NCGS; this is not yet universally adopted. For people on a gluten-free diet who are unable to perform an oral gluten challenge, an alternative to identify possible celiac disease is an in vitro gliadin challenge of small bowel biopsies; this test is only available at selected specialized tertiary-care centers.  Treatment  After exclusion of celiac disease and wheat allergy, the subsequent step for diagnosis and treatment of NCGS is to start a strict gluten-free diet (GFD) to assess if symptoms improve or resolve completely. This may occur within days to weeks of starting a GFD, but improvement may also be due to a non-specific, placebo response. The recovery of the nervous system is slow and sometimes incomplete. Recommendations may resemble those for celiac disease, for the diet to be strict and maintained, with no transgression. The degree of gluten cross contamination tolerated by people with NCGS is not clear but there is some evidence that they can present with symptoms even after consumption of small amounts. Sporadic accidental contaminations with gluten can reactivate movement disorders. A part of people with gluten-related neuropathy or ataxia appears not to be able to tolerate even the traces of gluten allowed in most foods labeled as \\"gluten-free\\". Whereas celiac disease requires adherence to a strict lifelong gluten-free diet, it is not yet known whether NCGS is a permanent or a transient condition. The results of a 2017 study suggest that NCGS may be a chronic disorder, as is the case with celiac disease. A trial of gluten reintroduction to observe any reaction after 1‚Äì2 years of strict gluten-free diet might be performed. A strict gluten-free diet is effective in most of the neurological disorders associated with NCGS, ameliorating or even resolving the symptoms. It should be started as soon as possible to improve the prognosis. The death of neurons in the cerebellum in ataxia is the result of gluten exposure and is irreversible. Early treatment with a strict gluten-free diet can improve ataxia symptoms and prevent its progression. When dementia has progressed to an advanced degree, the diet has no beneficial effect. Cortical myoclonus appears to be treatment-resistant on both gluten-free diet and immunosuppression.  Persistent symptoms  Approximately one third of presumed NCGS patients continue to have symptoms, despite gluten withdrawal. Apart from a possible diagnostic error, there are multiple possible explanations. One reason is poor compliance with gluten withdrawal, whether voluntary and/or involuntary. There may be ingestion of gluten, in the form of cross contamination or food containing hidden sources. In some cases, the amelioration of gastrointestinal symptoms with a gluten-free diet is only partial, and these patients could significantly improve with the addition of a low-FODMAP diet. A subgroup may not improve when eating commercially available gluten-free products, as these can be rich in preservatives and additives such as sulfites, glutamates, nitrates and benzoates, which can also have a role in triggering functional gastrointestinal symptoms. Furthermore, people with NCGS may often present with IgE-mediated allergies to one or more foods. It has been estimated that around 35% suffer other food intolerances, mainly lactose intolerance.  History  The subject of \\"food intolerance\\", including gluten sensitivity and elimination diets, was discussed in 1976.Richard Mackarness (January, 1976), Not All in the Mind, Macmillan, Patients with symptoms including abdominal pain and diarrhea, which improved on gluten withdrawal, and who did not have celiac disease were initially described in 1976 and 1978 with the first series in 1980. Debate regarding the existence of a specific condition has continued since then, but the three consensus conferences held since 2010 produced consistent definitions of NCGS and its diagnostic criteria.  Society and culture  NCGS has been a topic of popular interest. Gluten has been named \\"the new diet villain\\". The gluten-free diet has become popular in the United States and other countries. Clinicians worldwide have been challenged by an increasing number of people who do not have celiac disease nor wheat allergy, with digestive or extra-digestive symptoms which improved after removing wheat / gluten from the diet. Many of these persons began a gluten-free diet on their own, without having been previously evaluated. Another reason that contributed to this trend was the publication of several books that demonize gluten and point to it as a cause of type 2 diabetes, weight gain and obesity, and a broad list of diseases ranging from depression and anxiety to arthritis and autism. The book that has had the most impact is Grain Brain: The Surprising Truth about Wheat, Carbs, and Sugar ‚Äì Your Brain's Silent Killers, by the American neurologist David Perlmutter, published on September 2013. Another book that has had great impact is Wheat Belly: Lose the Wheat, Lose the Weight, and Find Your Path Back to Health, by cardiologist William Davis. The gluten-free diet has been advocated and followed by many celebrities to lose weight, such as Miley Cyrus and Gwyneth Paltrow, and some elite athletes to improve performance. Estimates suggest that in 2014, 30% of people in the US and Australia were consuming gluten-free foods, with estimates that by 2016 approximately 100 million Americans would consume gluten-free products. Data from a 2015 Nielsen survey of 30,000 adults in 60 countries around the world showed that 21% of people prefer to buy gluten-free foods, with interest highest among younger generations. Another school of thought suggests that many people may be unnecessarily avoiding gluten when they do not need to. Debate around NCGS as a genuine clinical condition can be heightened because often patients are self diagnosed, or a diagnosis is made by alternative health practitioners. Many people who are making a gluten-free diet did not previously exclude celiac disease or, when they are fully evaluated, other alternative diagnoses can be found such as fructose intolerance or small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, or a better response to a low-FODMAP diet obtained.  Research  There are many open questions on gluten sensitivity, emphasized in one review that \\"it is still to be clarified whether this disorder is permanent or transient and whether it is linked to autoimmunity\\". It has not yet been established whether innate or adaptive immune responses are involved in NCGS, nor whether the condition relates specifically to gluten or rather relates to other components of grains. Studies indicate that AGA IgG is high in slightly more than half of NCGS patients and that, unlike for celiac disease patients, the IgG AGA decreases strongly over 6 months of gluten-free diet; AGA IgA is usually low or absent in NCGS patients. The need for developing biomarkers for NCGS is frequently emphasized; for example, one review indicated: \\"There is a desperate need for reliable biomarkers ... that include clinical, biochemical and histopathological findings which support the diagnosis of NCGS.\\" Research has also attempted to discern, by double-blind placebo-controlled trials, between a \\"fad component\\" to the recent popularity of the gluten-free diet and an actual sensitivity to gluten or other components of wheat. In a 2013 double-blind, placebo-controlled challenge (DBPC) by Biesiekierski et al. in a few people with IBS, the authors found no difference between gluten or placebo groups and the concept of NCGS as a syndrome was questioned. Nevertheless, this study had design errors and an incorrect selection of participants, and probably the reintroduction of both gluten and whey protein had a nocebo effect similar in all people, and this could have masked the true effect of gluten/wheat reintroduction. In a 2015 double-blind placebo cross-over trial, small amounts of purified wheat gluten triggered gastrointestinal symptoms (such as abdominal bloating and pain) and extra-intestinal manifestations (such as foggy mind, depression and aphthous stomatitis) in self-reported NCGS. Nevertheless, it remains elusive whether these findings specifically implicate gluten or proteins present in gluten-containing cereals. In a 2018 double-blind, crossover research study on 59 persons on a gluten-free diet with challenges of gluten, fructans or placebo, intestinal symptoms (specifically bloating) were borderline significantly higher after challenge with fructans, in comparison with gluten proteins (). Although the differences between the three interventions was very small, the authors concluded that fructans (the specific type of FODMAP found in wheat) are more likely to be the cause of NCGS gastrointestinal symptoms, rather than gluten. In addition, fructans used in the study were extracted from chicory root, so it remains to be seen whether the wheat fructans produce the same effect.

He was the brother of Baptist Levinz and William Levinz, and nephew of the Royalist Robert Levinz. Early career He took a sizarship in 1648 at Trinity College, Cambridge, but did not graduate, and in November 1655 entered Gray's Inn, where he was called to the bar in November 1661, was elected a bencher in 1678, and treasurer in 1679. He was knighted at Whitehall on 2 Oct. 1678, and made a King's Counsel about the same time. He represented the crown in the trials of Ireland, Pickering, Grove, Langhorn, Whitebread, and other supposed Popish Plotters in 1678‚Äì9. In October 1679 he was made Attorney-General. In December the celebrated proclamation against \\"tumultuous petitioning\\" was under discussion in the council, and Levinz was required to draft it. He refused at first, but eventually consented on condition that Chief-Justice North would dictate the substance of it. Levinz was thus able, when examined by the House of Commons of England as to his part in the affair (24 Nov. 1680), to shift the entire responsibility on to North's shoulders. Lord Russell's trial and removal from office On 12 Feb. 1680 Levinz was called to the degree of Serjeant-at-Law and raised to the bench of the common pleas. He went the Oxford circuit, and was a member of the commission which tried Stephen College at the Oxford assizes in August 1681. He was also a member of the special commission which sat at the Old Bailey in July 1683 to try Lord Russell for his supposed participation in the Rye House plot. Lord Russell having challenged one of the jury for not having a freehold estate within the city, the point was elaborately argued. All the judges, however, decided against the challenge. Levinz's judgment is reported at some length in Cobbett's State Trials. In 1684‚Äì85 Levinz was consulted by the king on the question whether a contract by the late king letting out part of the excise to farm was determined by his death, and gave the more sound than courtly advice that it was so. His \\"quietus\\" was expected to follow as a matter of course. It was deferred, however, for a time, and he was one of Jeffreys' colleagues in the Bloody Assizes, and also helped to try some of the rebels in London. His supersedeas came on 10 Feb. 1685‚Äì86. No ground of dismissal was assigned, but probably Levinz was thought to be unsafe on the question of the dispensing power. Late cases, death and legacy He at once returned to the bar, and was soon busily engaged in pleading. He was one of the counsel for the Seven Bishops in 1688, defended Major John Bernardi (an alleged conspirator in the Jacobite Assassination Plot), securing the dismissal of the bill of indictment by the grand jury and, in the great habeas corpus case of Rex v. Kendall and Roe, before Lord Chief Justice Holt in 1695, he argued successfully against the legality of a committal to prison under a general warrant by a secretary of state. He died at Serjeants' Inn on 29 Jan. 1700‚Äì1, and was buried in Evenley parish church. Part of his monument there survives: a more than life- size marble statue of Levinz wearing his judge's robes and wig. He was succeeded by his son William who was a Nottinghamshire MP. Writings From manuscripts left by Levinz was published in 1702 a folio volume of reports in French (with an English translation chiefly by Salkeld); it reappeared under the title, The Reports of Sir Creswell Levinz, Knight, London, 1722, 2 vols. fol. A third edition in English only, revised by Thomas Vickers, was published at Dublin in 1793‚Äì7, 3 vols. 8vo. Levinz also compiled A Collection of Select and Modern Entries of Declarations, Pleadings, Issues, Verdicts, Judgments, &c.;, referring to the Cases in Sir Creswell Levinz's Reports, the judgment of the Court being added to each President (sic), which was published in London in 1702, fol. There has been some division of opinion among English judges as to Levinz's merits as a reporter.

Battle  On 21 October 2013, the town, which is strategically located between the city of Homs city and the capital Damascus, was reportedly overrun by Islamist militants belonging to the al-Nusra Front. The assault started when two al- Nusra suicide bombers detonated near a gas well, outside the town capturing it as well. At the time of the attack, no government military or militia forces were in the town, except local police. Saadad fell without a fight with the police station surrendering. After capturing Sadad, the militants set up loudspeakers in the main square, calling for residents to return to their houses. At least nine people were killed after being found in the streets. Opposition activists claimed the attack was not religiously motivated but rather it was conducted for military reason. However, following the battle, the bodies of almost 50 civilians were discovered in Saadad, including those of seven people, three of them children, in a well. Medical supplies within the town's hospital and the presence of a military depot nearby were also seen as possible reasons for the raid. At the start of the rebel offensive, there were instances of rebels evicting civilians from their homes and turning them into military positions. Rebels also reportedly used civilians as human shields during the battle. By the morning of 22 October, the rebels seemingly abandoned the town and Syrian Army forces were sent in to retake it. It soon became apparent that the militants went into hiding in the orchards and fields and ambushed the Army as it approached. On 23 October, rebels pressed their advance and seized control of Army positions near the weapons depots, by the village of Mahin. As they advanced, the Syrian Air Force launched air-strikes. On 25 October, AP reported that hundreds of civilians were trapped in Saadad, with Archbishop Silwanos Al-Nemeh saying that the situation was dire and that they were in fear of a massacre. Also, opposition fighters entered the Mar Theodore Church damaging it and stealing Church items. On 26 October, a rebel battalion commander was killed in the clashes in Mahin and Sadad. Fighting was also taking place in the Hawarin and al-Hadath areas. Some Saadad residents were able to flee the neighbourhoods controlled by Jabhat al-Nusra, which were being bombarded by Army artillery. By 28 October, the Army had taken back control of Sadad with the militants retreating from the town. The bodies of 46 civilians, including 15 women, were discovered in Sadad after the rebels pulled back. The opposition activist group the SOHR called it a massacre. 30 of the dead were reportedly found in two mass graves. Another 10 civilians remained missing. More than 100 government soldiers and 100 rebels, including 80 jihadists from ISIS and al-Nusra, were killed in the fighting. Foreign rebel fighters were also among the dead. The rebels retreated to the surrounding farmland, with the military in pursuit, and the government news agency reported that the militants had vandalized Sadad's Saint Theodor Church and much of its infrastructure.  After the battle  One week after the Army recaptured Saadad, on 4 November, the military also captured the al-Hazm al- Wastani area, which is by Mahin and Sadad. A day after the capture, the head of the Syrian Social Nationalist Party from Sadad was killed during fighting with rebels in the surrounding countryside. On 5 November, rebels launched a large attack on the weapons depot at Mahin during which 50 rebels and 20 soldiers were killed. The next day, the SOHR reported that opposition forces managed to capture several buildings in the 30-building complex and seize a large quantity of weapons. A government source denied both the capture and the seizure and stated fighting was still ongoing. On 15 November, government forces recaptured the weapons depot, as well as the nearby town of al-Hadath and the village of Howarin. A rebel commander was killed during the last day of fighting in the area.

The inventors include famed beautician Max Factor Sr. A 2013 Wired article described the device as \\"a Clockwork Orange style device\\" that combines \\"phrenology, cosmetics and a withering pseudo-scientific analysis\\". A photograph of Factor, using the device on actress Marjorie Reynolds featured in a 1935 article in science magazine Modern Mechanix and, when republished by The Guardian in 2013, the caption described it as being \\"a contraption that looks like an instrument of torture\\". Placed on and around the head and face, the beauty micrometer uses flexible metal strips which align with a person's facial features. The screws holding the strips in place allow for 325 adjustments, enabling the operator to make fine measurements with a precision of one thousandth of an inch. The inventors stated that there are two key measurements that they looked for: the heights of the nose and forehead should be the same, and the eyes should be separated by the width of one eye. When an imperfection is identified, corrective make-up can be applied to enhance or subdue the feature. The company Max Factor claims that the device helped Max Factor, Sr. to better understand the female face. The beauty micrometer was completed in 1932 and was primarily intended for use in the movie industry. When an actor's face is shown in a very large scale their \\"flaws\\" are magnified and can become \\"glaring distortions\\", according to the Modern Mechanix article. This device was intended to remedy the perceived problem, and the inventors also envisioned it being used in beauty shops. However, it did not become popular and did not gain widespread usage. Only one beauty micrometer is believed to exist. It is featured in a display at the Hollywood Entertainment Museum and came up for auction in 2009, falling significantly short of the $10,000‚Äì$20,000 estimate.

Temporal Raster Plots are also sometimes referred to as carpet plots. Each occurrence is registered in a Cartesian coordinate system, in which both axes show time, have different time resolutions: one axis shows slices of data, the other some sensible interval. A common example would be that one axis shows hours in a day, the other days in a year. In a 2D plot, the value to be plotted is coded with an intensity or a color. In the 3D variant of the plot, it is often coded as a height. When visualized, particularly the color-coded variant of the plot may easily show a carpet-like pattern. Temporal Raster Plots make it easy to show time-based relations within a large sets of time-interval data and often make it easy to recognize local maxima and minima. Assuming the chosen time division is related to the events, it is also easy to recognize global and local patterns, such as recurrent events. In the following example, the data is one year's worth of measurements of the outdoor temperatures in Augsburg, with four samples taken per hour. In the according carpet diagram, each column represents a day in the year and contains the values for that day (from 0:00 until 23:45). Despite the high number of measure points (about 35000) it is easy to distinguish local and global patterns.

Although Garry no longer teaches full-time, she continues to work with graduate students. Education and career Garry received her bachelor's degree from Monmouth College in 1965, graduating magna cum laude. She went on to receive a master's degree from the University of Chicago in 1966, and a Ph.D in Philosophy with a dissertation focused on visualizing from the University of Maryland in 1970. Garry accepted a position as Assistant Professor of Philosophy at CSULA in 1969, before being promoted to Associate Professor in 1977, and full Professor in 1983 She is now Professor Emerita. While a professor at CSULA, Garry served the department in a variety of roles, including acting as department chair for several terms across multiple decades. Besides her permanent academic appointments, Garry has served as a Visiting Assistant Professor of Philosophy at UCLA in the Spring semester of 1977, and served as a Visiting Associate Professor of Philosophy at the University of Southern California in the fall of 1978, and 1979 (where she would later serve as a visiting full Professor of Philosophy in 1988.) Garry has also served eight terms as a visiting full Professor of Philosophy at UCLA. Besides for her academic appointments, Garry has contributed to her field in a variety of important ways, including being one of the founders of Hypatia: A Journal of Feminist Philosophy, and a founder of the Society for Women in Philosophy, Pacific Division. She also serves as editor for topics related to feminist philosophy for both the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy and PhilPapers. Research areas Garry began her graduate studies during the heyday of anglophone analytic philosophy, and many of her original research interests reflect that. Her original focuses included epistemology, analytic metaphysics, philosophy of language, etc. As the New Left and the women's movement began to impact academia, Garry's research interests focused on feminism, and at re-examining traditional philosophy through a feminist point of view. Her current interests focus on intersectionality, the way in which various systems of oppression and privilege are fundamentally intertwined and shape each other. Garry was an early entrant in to the field of feminist philosophy, and was responsible for a significant amount of foundational work in the field, including the development of early courses in feminist philosophy, and at early attempts at integrating feminist philosophy into other philosophical areas. Garry was also one of the first philosophers to question whether pornography was a significant cause of gender-based violence. Publications Garry has edited one anthology, Women, Knowledge, and Reality: Explorations in Feminist Philosophy, which is a collection of 25 essays intended to highlight the ways in which feminist philosophy (and feminist philosophers) engage, critique, and challenge traditional fields of philosophy across the board. The anthology has multiple editions, including a Russian translation. Garry collaborated with fellow philosophers Serene Khader and Alison Stone on a volume titled Routledge Companion to Feminist Philosophy, published in 2017. Garry has also published a large number of refereed book chapters, journal articles, and reviews, primarily dealing with topics related to feminism, intersectionality, philosophical and feminist methods, and sex and gender.

According to law enforcement sources investigating the suicide, Caspersen left a note stating that he \\"was tired, diminished and in constant pain, and that he did not want to be a burden to his loving family\\". Caspersen had been battling kidney cancer before his death, and reportedly pursued regular chemotherapy treatment. Several sources described his health as deteriorating and the cancer severe. Others indicated that his medical condition led to depression, describing an uncertainty that left him \\"sort of horrified about his medical outcome\\". Bernard Davidoff, an internist from New Jersey apparently familiar with Caspersen's medical care, advised police that Caspersen \\"suffered from severe depression and was taking antidepressant meds, heart meds, liver meds, kidney meds and diabetes meds\\".

Caspersen had begun to step back from various philanthropic efforts and institutional boards at Harvard, Peddie, and the Hodson Trust. Eight days after his death in 2009, a New York Times article cited an anonymous source, to report that Caspersen was being investigated by the Internal Revenue Service and was suspected of owing as much as $100 million in back taxes and fines, and facing possible imprisonment. The New York Times article reported that Caspersen was caught up in a broader federal investigation into tax havens and offshore bank accounts used by wealthy Americans to avoid paying taxes in Switzerland and Liechtenstein. It was reported that his name was turned over to federal investigators by Swiss banking giant UBS earlier in the year, and in connection to Liechtenstein Global Trust (LGT), a private bank controlled by Liechtenstein's royal family. In 2015 an attorney for Caspersen's estate stated Caspersen's tax returns for 2005-2008 had been audited, in an investigation that did not conclude until 2013. The attorney, Denis Conlon, said the net result of the four-year audit was a $7,000 refund from the government for overpayment in one year, $14,000 of additional tax due for another year (in which Caspersen had over $2.7 million of income), no refunds or additional taxes dues for the other two years, and no fines or penalties imposed for alleged offshore accounts or other conduct.

Life cycle  Lutzomyia arthophora are holometabolous insects. They begin their life cycle as a dark elliptical egg. These eggs are generally laid in habitats such as rock crevices and trees. The eggs will hatch within twenty four hours and all eggs will hatch within the same time frame. The eggs then become larvae. These larvae will then feed on organic matter. The larvae will then progress through four larval instars before pupating. The Arthophora will pupate in dry climates. The males will generally mature faster than the females. Twenty four hours after eclosion, the male is able to fertilize a female while the female is able to copulate a couple hours after eclosion. Courtship involves rapid beating of the wings and release of the hormone. Copulation is not dependent on the nutrition of the fly and it lasts between two to five minutes. The female will then take a blood meal and lay her eggs.  Nutrition  Lutzomyia arthrophora feed on both carbohydrates and blood. Females that feed on carbohydrates fare better reproductively than those that do not. After feeding on these sugar solutions L. arthrophora will wait twenty four hours before feeding again. Females will then feed on blood two to four days post eclosion. The main hosts for blood meals are small mammals such as wood-rats, white footed mice, rabbits, squirrel, and opossum. They also will feed on chickens if available. They tend to feed on the hairless regions of the ears.  Morphology  Lutzomyia anthophora is identified by a few morphological characteristics. The most obvious is that the thorax is divided into three sections, the prothorax, the mesothorax, and the metathorax. Also, there are distinctive spines on their hind femoras. The posterior end of their cibarium contains two horizontal teeth and they have episternal setae. They also have one subterminal and one basal setae. The male and female are then differentiated by their own morphological characteristics. Males have parmere's with short strongly clubbed dorsal arms. The females have individual sperm ducts at least as long as the spermetheca. For more information follow the link to the diachotomous key.  Habitat  Lutzomyia anthophora are found in Mexico and in the U.S. They tend to feed on small mammals and therefore can be found in these mammals nests (this is also the where it might be easiest to collect these flies). Also, they tend to develop faster at higher temperatures.  Importance  Lutzomyia anthophora bites are painful and can cause an allergic reaction. This also allows for the possibility of a secondary infection. Some studies have suggested they may be a vector of the bacteria Bartonella baciliformis. They are a known vector of Leishmania mexicana, which causes both cutaneous and diffuse cutansous leishmaniasis  References   * Category:Psychodidae Category:Diptera of North America Category:Insects of Mexico Category:Insects of the United States Category:Insect vectors of human pathogens ","title":"Lutzomyia anthophora"},{"id":"40957082","title":"2002 Asian Athletics Championships ‚Äì Women's triple jump"},{"id":"40957101","text":"Tephrosia apollinea is a legume species, native to southwest Asia (the Levant, Arabia, Socotra, Iran, Pakistan, northwestern India) and northeast Africa (Egypt, Sudan, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Djibouti, Somalia). The leaflets of the plant are obovate-oblong and equal-sided, and of a silky texture. The fruits (legumes) are typically one to two inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) long and contain six or seven brownish seeds. The species typically grows in areas where the soils are relatively deep, especially in semi-arid and wadi areas, and on terraces and slight inclines and hills. Tephrosia apollinea is known to be toxic to goats. Although it has been used in Oman to treat bronchitis, cough, earache, nasal congestion and wounds and bone fractures, as of 1993 its wider impact on humans had not been assessed. It can be used to make indigo dyes, and the leaves and those of other plants are used to make hot drinks by the Bedouin in parts of Sinai and the Negev. Description The leaflets of Tephrosia apollinea The leaflets of the plant are obovate-oblong, somewhat wedge-shaped, equal-sided, and of a silky texture. The mid-rib is usually folded longitudinally, and they are characterized by parallel transverse veins. The fruits (legumes) are typically one to two inches long (2.5 to 5.1 cm) and contain six or seven brownish seeds. The plant displays purple flowers during season; they are described as their most attractive in the month of January. It typically grows to 45 ‚Äì 50 cm in height, and can grow on mountains with an altitude of over 3000 ft. (914 m). Note: some page numbers in the biodiversitylibrary.org scan are misordered. Both diploid (22 chromosomes) and tetraploid (44 chromosomes) cytotypes have been reported. The roots of Tephrosia apollinea are deep, penetrating soils to a depth of 3 metres or more, aiding the absorption of moisture from the soil. Moisture is stored in the cortex of the roots, which is protected by a thin periderm. Water storage in the cortex enables growth and reproduction during times of drought, which allow it to thrive in both arid and semi-arid conditions and to survive during winter and summer months at times of low rainfall. The roots grow at a faster rate than the shoots themselves, and even at the early stage of the plant displaying a shoot the length of a cm, the roots may already be 30 cm or more in length. A proposed 1993 treatment of T. apollinea as a subspecies of Tephrosia purpurea noted some regional variations, with plants in the Eastern Desert of Egypt possibly producing smaller pods, leaves, and leaflets, and plants from oases having densely pubescent spreading hairs. Among the features they described as differentiating the apollinea subspecies from the nominate purpurea subspecies were that apollinea has somewhat longer pods (3.5-5 or sometimes 5.5 cm, rather than 3-4 cm), a wider range in the quantity of seeds per pod (generally 7-9, as low as 3, rather than generally 5-6, or sometimes 7), the pods being curved upwards rather than downwards, and leaflets having 9 rather than 7 lateral veins. Taxonomy and names The plant was initially named Galega apollinea by Alire Raffeneau Delile in 1813, and moved to the genus Tephrosia by Johann Heinrich Friedrich Link in 1822. Its treatment as a subspecies of Tephrosia purpurea, called Tephrosia purpurea subsp. apollinea, was proposed by Hasnaa A. Hosni and Zeinab A. R. El-Karemy in 1993. This treatment has not been accepted by the databases The Plant List, International Legume Database & Information Service, or Tropicos. Hosni and El-Karemy treated T. apollinea and T. purpurea as a single species after finding that their previous descriptions \\"agree in most of their characters and the distinction between typical forms is rather difficult...\\" The full name with authorities under their revised classification is Tephrosia purpurea (L.) Pers. subsp. apollinea (Delile) Hosni & El-Karemy. In parts of southern Arabia the species carries the vernacular name of hailara, See page 132. and it is also known as dhafra, dhawasi, omayye or nafal to Arabs, and written as ÿ±ÔÆ≠Ôªîÿ∑ in the Arabic language. In the Sinai area of Egypt it is referred to by the Bedouin as sanna or senna. It is also known as amioka in parts of Sudan. See page 6. Due to its traditional use in making indigo dyes, Tephrosia apollinea has also been referred to as \\"Egyptian indigo\\". Distribution and ecology Flowers, leaves, and fruit (legume pods) The species is recorded in the northeast African nations of Djibouti, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia, and Sudan, the Western Asian nations of Iran, Israel, Jordan, Oman, Saudi Arabia, South Yemen, the United Arab Emirates, and Yemen (including the Yemeni island of Socotra), and the South Asian nations of India and Pakistan. Within India, it is documented in the western states of Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Rajasthan. The species, cited as a \\"leguminous desert forb\\", typically grows in areas where the soils are relatively deep, especially in semi-arid and wadi areas, and on terraces and slight inclines and hills. See page 329. In Saudi Arabia it has been found scattered among species such as Zilla spinosa, Rhanterium epapposum, Astragalus spinosus, Gymnocarpos decandrum, Achillea fragrantissima and Halothamnus bottae on the edges of the slopes of desiccated lakes. It has been well documented in sources in Egypt and Sudan. In 1866 the Pharmaceutical Journal stated that it was found as a contaminant in Alexandrian senna, being found in cultivated fields in the valleys to the east and south of Assouan, in the Elephantine Islands, opposite Assouan, along the Nile, and Edfou and Hermonthis. In Israel it grows in the Judean desert, the Dead Sea Valley, the Negev hills and Eilat. In wadi areas of the Yemen it tends to grow on desert alluvial shrubland, and coexist with Fagonia indica, Cymbopogon schoenanthus and Boerhavia elegans. An example of Tephrosia apollinea was found by Harry St John Bridger Philby in 1936 at Raiyan, about northeast of Sana'a. In Socotra, an island off the coast of Yemen, it is typically found in the Croton shrubland of lowland plains at altitudes of between sea level and 100 metres on overgrazed soils, along with Cassia holsericea. In a 2000s analysis of vegetation in the woodlands of northern Socotra, the species was found to coexist with Achyranthus aspera, Ageratum conyzoides, Bidens chinensis, Forsskaolea viridis, Hibiscus vitifolius, Indigofera coerulea, Leucas urticifolia, Setaria adhaerens and Solanum incanum. Tephrosia apollinea is also found in the United Arab Emirates and in Oman, where it inhabits the Jiddat al-Harasis desert and dominates the beds of wadis in mountains such as Jebel Shams. Toxicity Tephrosia apollinea is cited as \\"unpalatable\\", although the seeds of the plant are reportedly a favourite of sandgrouse inhabiting the scrub-desert of northern Sudan, See page 71. and the butterfly Colias croceus is known to feed on it. This has allowed it to colonize the landscape in parts of the Middle East which have been overgrazed, especially at lower altitudes. The species is known to be toxic to goats; a study published in the early 1980s revealed that 11 out of 12 goats died after 1 to 40 days of daily oral dosing of Tephrosia apollinea shoots (fresh or dried), and that they displayed adverse reactions to ingesting it such as dyspnoea, weakness of the limbs and joints causing instability in movement, changes in fat composition, catarrhal enteritis, and hemorrhage in the heart, lungs, and intestinal mucosa. Rotenoids extracted from the seeds of the plant also caused complete mortality in Aphis craccivora, when applied at a concentration of 0.1% for 48 hours. Uses Tephrosia apollinea blooming Tephrosia apollinea can be used to make indigo dyes. The species was noted to be commonly cultivated for this purpose in Nubia in the 1800s. The plant is known for its medicinal properties and has significant anti-bacterial properties; the leaves and the root have been used to treat bronchitis, cough, earache, wounds and bone fractures by herbalists in countries like Oman. The ground leaves of Tephrosia apollinea are also inhaled to reduce nasal congestion, or boiled with water to make eardrops. Powdered bark can be mixed with water and poured into the ears of camels to alleviate ticks, and powdered leaves can be used as a paste in the treating of wounds. It can also be rubbed on limbs in conjunction with Fagonia indica and Ocomim basilicum to treat people affected with polio. Although unpalatable when consumed raw, when boiled the leaves of Tephrosia apollinea and numerous other plants are used to make hot drinks by the Bedouin in parts of Sinai and the Negev. See pages 151, 161. But herbal doctors in Oman warn that Tephrosia apollinea can be potentially harmful to humans, and as of 1993 it had not been fully analyzed chemically to assess the wider impact it could have on health. Phytochemistry When dried, the leaves of Tephrosia apollinea were found to contain 4.4% moisture, 21.1% of crude protein, 19.8% of crude fiber, and 10.9% of ash. A chemical analysis found that it contains rotenoids, isolflavones, flavanones, chalcones, and flavones, The chloroform extract of the aerial part of Tephrosia apollinea also revealed seven new 8-prenylated flavonoids, including tephroapollin A-G (1-7). In 2006, researchers of Oman's Sultan Qaboos University published their findings from a chemical investigation into the leaves in which they found it contained semiglabrin, semigalbrinol, and a new flavanone named apollineanin. One 2014 study revealed that pseudosemiglabrin extracted from the aerial parts of Tephrosia apollinea had an antiproliferative effect on cancer cell lines.

It was designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1977 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. History Van Buren County was originally platted in 1829, and in 1837, the Board of Supervisors chose Paw Paw as the county seat. Construction began on this site in 1842, and the building was occupied in 1845. In 1900, it was decided to construct a new courthouse for the county, and a bond issue of $35,000 was approved by voters for the purpose. The older courthouse was moved to accommodate a new structure; the original Van Buren County Courthouse now serves as the Paw Paw City Hall. The county hired Jackson architect Claire Allen to design the building, and contractor George Rickman & Sons to construct it. The cornerstone was laid on September 2, 1901, and the total cost, including courthouse, jail, and furnishings, was $120,000. Construction took a year and a half, and the building was dedicated on February 23, 1903. In 1974, an annex was added to the courthouse to open up more office space. A memorial clock, designated the Sheldon and Oradell Rupert Memorial Clock, was installed in the tower in 1986. Description The Van Buren County Courthouse is a three-story rectangular Classical Revival structure constructed of yellow sandstone with a red tile hip roof. An Italian Renaissance clock tower topped with a cupola is placed in the center of the building. The cupola and the main cornice are both constructed of copper. The interior of the courthouse is substantially original. The courtroom has high curved ceilings and dark woodwork, as well as electric chandeliers built to look like the original gas fixtures. Four large murals are also in the courthouse.

(November 5, 1623 in Lisbon - December 8, 1695 in Beja) was a nun of the Carmelite Order of the Ancient Observance who, having been born in Lisbon, Portugal, and lived and professed her religious vows at the Carmelite Convent of Our Lady of Hope in Beja, Portugal, died with the odor of sanctity. During her life, she reported several apparitions of the Child Jesus and left many autobiographical writings with ascetic interest. In the 19th century, Bishop Dom Ant√≥nio Xavier de Sousa Monteiro made the exhumation of Mother Mariana's, previously analyzed and confirmed as incorrupt by an inspection of Fray Manuel of the Cenacle, and relocated it to the Church of Salvador, in Beja, which is still in the side chapel of the main altar.

It is a part of the subgenus Monoculicoides and has many subspecies. Found in North America, C. variipennis transmits Bluetongue virus, African horse sickness virus, akabane virus, and epizootic hemorrhagic disease. Anatomy The C. variipennis is less than long, which makes it difficult to keep from livestock. The wings of C. variipennis are spotted and narrow with few veins; the wings fold over the abdomen while the C. variipennis is at rest. The max flight range for male C. variipennis is and for females , while the mean flight range is . Flight activity is dependent on the light intensity and temperature; most flight, and thus most bites, occur around dawn and dusk. A distinction between male and female C. variipennis is that females have different mouthparts that allow them to blood feed. Life cycle The life cycle of the C. variipennis is from half a year to three years. The larva, found typically near sewage tank outlets or stock tanks where manure is trampled into the soil, are slender, transparent to orange colored worm-like and lasts 15‚Äì23 days of larval stage. The aquatic/sub aquatic larvae feed on dying organisms or other organic material. Subspecies=Locations The C. variipennis and the five subspecies, C. v. variipennis, C. v. sonorensis, C. v. occidentalis, C. v. australis, and C. v. albertensis, are found in various locations of the United States. The C. v. variipennis is found in the north east United States, but is not a vector for Bluetongue virus in this area because of low susceptibility; the C. v. sonorensis is found from Florida to California, north to Virginia and Ohio, and in the west from Washington to British Columbia, but they leave Colorado in the winter; the C. v. occidentalis is found in Arizona to California and from Washington to British Columbia. Characteristic Distinctions The C. v. australis and C. v. albertensis have difficulty in defining the subspecies relationship and together make up the C. variipennis complex. There are more outbreaks for Bluetongue virus in California than New York, as the bite rate of C. v. sonorensis is twice as much as the C. v. variipennis. Female C. variipennis show slender to slightly swollen third palpal segments with sensory pits that are shallow round and small as opposed to males Distinction against the subspecies C. v. sonorensis and C. v. occidentalis show that the females are identical morphologically with the enlarged third palpal segment with their sensory pit being a rounded, medium to large size For the male difference of C. v. variipennis, C. v. occidentalis and C. v. sonorensis, on the ventral surface of aedeagus, C. v. variipennis and C. v. occidentalis lack spicules, while male C. v. sonorensis have many prominent spicules on the aedeagus C. variipennis as a vector=Bluetongue Virus The C. variipennis attacks in swarms with the Bluetongue virus; this can be devastating to livestock and is the most economically important arthropod borne animal diseases in the United States. C. variipennis transmits the Bluetongue virus, found in North America from latitude 40¬∞ N to 35¬∞ S. However, the virus is absent from northeast United States because the cold weather does not allow for the vector of the Bluetongue disease. On average, the virus costs $125 million due to the restriction of movement on livestock to countries that are free of the virus. The C. variipennis can transmit diseases if the population density is greater than one per 3.57 km2; however, this can be reduced if the area is treated with insecticide. When the C. variipennis infects sheep, the sheep experience swelling of the tongue and erosions in the mouth and throat, often leading to the death of sheep, abortion, and deformed lambs. When infected with Bluetongue virus, cattle experience similar symptoms such as abortion and stillborn calves, but it is often less severe compared to sheep. The gut barrier in C. variipennis allows for some prevention of infection of Bluetongue virus via blood meals. Both poor nutrition as a larva and more quantity in blood meal means a higher likelihood of being infected. When naturally infected with Bluetongue virus, the C. variipennis contains the Bluetongue Virus in the thorax, and then is secreted by the fly‚Äôs saliva while blood feeding for the next 7‚Äì10 days, but is only first detected within 4 days. When the C. variipennis is persistently infected, especially in lab, with Bluetongue virus, the anterior and posterior midgut, in addition to the foregut/midgut junction show the most signs of infection. There are also affected cells in the gut cells that then affect the haemocoel and then are detected in a few fat body cells. There is also small detection in low-level range of secondary organs‚Äô fat body cells, but high concentration in the tissues of the organs. While the C. variipennis is orally infected with the Bluetongue virus, the anterior and posterior midgut and the foregut/midgut junction cells show infection. There is no evidence for the Bluetongue virus to be transmitted transovarial from infected females to progeny. Heleidomermis magnapapula (nematode) The nematode Heleidomermis magnapapula is a parasite of C. variipennis. The second stage juvenile H. magnapapula enters in the larval C. variipennis, develops, molts into an adult, and exits the host, killing the host as it exits. This parasitism of H. magnapapula and C. variipennis is commonly found in the Chino Basin in California Riverside County and the Allegheny, Thompson and Cayuga areas of New York.

The mountain has a north summit (613.2 m) and a south summit (606.0 m); on the latter is the Ludwig observation tower.  Geography = Location  The Bl√§ttersberg lies in the Haardt, the eastern mountain chain of the Palatine Forest, in the eponymous nature park. Its summit rises 3 kilometres west- northwest of Rhodt unter Rietburg, within whose territory most of the mountain lies, 4.5 km west-southwest of Edenkoben, between the Edenkoben valley in the north and the Modenbach valley in the south, and 1.6 km (all as the crow flies) northwest of the village of Weyher in der Pfalz. The mountain can be clearly made out from the Rhine Plain. On its east-northeastern flank, to the west and above the stately home of Villa Ludwigsh√∂he that is visible for miles, is the castle of Rietburg (Rhodt), which is also a landmark. At the southern foot of the mountain, by the upper reaches of the Modenbach stream, lies the historic estate of the Buschm√ºhle mill.  Elevation  The elevation of the Bl√§ttersberg is given on some topographic maps as 613.2 m, but on others as 618 m. About 60 metres south-southeast of the summit is another high point, 611.8 m.  Ludwig Tower  On the southern summit of the Bl√§tterberg stands an observation tower, built in 1883, called the Ludwig Tower (Ludwigsturm). From the viewing platform of the 15 metre-high tower the view to the east into the Rhine Plain is blocked by the trees, but elsewhere one can see as far as the Badener H√∂he and Hornisgrinde in the Black Forest to the south-southeast, nearby Trifels Castle to the southwest, the Frankenweide forest with its hills, the Wei√üenberg (Luitpold Tower) and Hortenkopf (transmission mast) to the west, the nearby Kesselberg mountain to the northwest and the highest point in the Palatine Forest, the Kalmit, to the north-northeast.

Life Born in Norfolk about 1590, Cademan was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, and proceeded B.A. 1606, M.A. 1609. He then studied abroad, and took the degree of M.D. at the University of Padua in March 1620. In May and June 1623 he passed his examination with the College of Physicians of London, and was ordered to become incorporated at one of the English universities. In 1626 Cademan was returned to the parliamentary commission by the College as a Catholic. He was then residing in Fetter Lane. Two years later he was noted as a recusant, residing in Westminster. He afterwards is mentioned as living at St. Martin's-in-the-Fields. It is supposed that his religious views delayed his admission to the college. He apparently was never incorporated at Oxford or Cambridge. It was not till 3 December 1630 that he became licentiate of the College; on 22 December he was admitted a fellow. By 16 December 1626, Cademan was appointed physician in ordinary to Queen Henrietta Maria. Business interests Cademan and Sir William Brouncker had a patent for stilling and brewing in a house at the back of St. James's Park, and this patent, they note in 1633, they had already exercised for many years. On 4 August 1638, on consideration of a petition to government presented in March previous, Sir Theodore de Mayerne, Cademan, and others distillers of spirits and makers of vinegar in London, were incorporated as \\"Distillers of London\\". Cademan and Mayerne were asked to set up rules of the corporation. The Company of Apothecaries petitioned against it in September as infringing their monopoly. To this petition Mayerne, Brouncker, and Cademan replied, and the undertaking was allowed to proceed, and in 1638 was published The Distiller of London, compiled and set forth by the special Licence and Command of the King's most Excellent Majesty for the sole use of the Company of Distillers of London, and by them to bee duly observed and practiced. It is explained in the preface as book of rules and directions concerning distillation of strong waters and making vinegars. The name of Thomas Cademan as first master of the company is appended. Another edition of the Distiller was published in 1652. In 1649 Cademan was chosen anatomy lecturer to the College of Physicians, but was lax in the post. He became an elect 25 June 1650, and died 2 May 1651. Works Cademan was physician to Francis Russell, 4th Earl of Bedford, of whose death he wrote an account in a pamphlet of six pages, The Earle of Bedford's passage to the Highest Court of Parliament, 9 May 1641, about tenne a clock in the morning (1641). Family Cademan treated William Davenant in 1630; and Davenant later married his widow Anne. Cademan had an adult son in 1641. He has been identified with John Cademan, M.D., recommended on 22 June 1640 by the College of Physicians for appointment to the office of physician to the army.

It was followed by the 1977 election. The vast majority of the councillors elected had been members of one of the three previous county authorities which were merged to create Dyfed, namely Cardiganshire, Carmarthenshire, and Pembrokeshire. Overview=Cardiganshire There were fifteen wards in Cardiganshire. Eight of these were won by Liberal candidates even though the parliamentary constituency was held by Labour since 1966. Carmarthenshire The first elections, in line with the traditional pattern of local government in west Wales, resulted in an Independent majority. These Independents were, by and large, genuinely unattached to any political grouping. Of the political parties, Labour comfortably had the largest number of seats but were to be consistently outvoted by the Independents. In the urban part of Carmarthenshire the contests were, in the main, between Labour candidates and one other opponent. In the rural areas, however, several Independent members of the former Carmarthenshire County Council, including aldermen, fought each other. In several cases, once these initial contests had taken place, the Independent councillor was returned unopposed. The most significant contest, which attracted press coverage, was at Llangadog (Llandeilo No. 6 Ward) where the President of Plaid Cymru, Gwynfor Evans, a member of Carmarthenshire Council since 1949 was defeated by an Independent. The results for Plaid Cymu were disappointing and their one success in Carmarthen Rural No. 7 (the Whitland area) was partly caused by the non-Plaid vote being split between two Independent candidates.

It challenges previously widespread belief that only a priori knowledge can be necessary. It draws on a number of philosophical concepts such as necessity, the causal theory of reference, rigidity, and the a priori a posteriori distinction. It was first introduced by philosopher Saul Kripke in his 1970 series of lectures at Princeton University. The transcript of these lectures was then compiled and assembled into his seminal book, Naming and Necessity.  Main argument for a posteriori necessity  Here is an overview of the argument: :(P1) 'Hesperus' is a proper name that refers to the evening star. 'Phosphorus' is also a proper name and it refers to the morning star. But the evening star and the morning star are the same planetary body (Venus). So both names designate Venus :(P2) If both names designate rigidly, they designate the same object (Venus) in every possible world. Therefore (by the definition of 'necessary') 'Hesperus = Phosphorus' is necessarily true. If it is the case that in all possible worlds the identity claim ‚ÄúHesperus is Phosphorus‚Äù is true, the statement is necessary :(P3) The fact that Hesperus is Phosphorus was discovered by empirical observation. So it is a posteriori knowledge. Knowing that Hesperus is Phosphorus cannot have been discovered a priori. Using scientific instruments and empirical research, it was concluded that both Hesperus and Phosphorus are the same object. This is a posteriori knowledge. :(C) Therefore, it is possible for knowledge obtained a posteriori to be necessary. That Hesperus is Phosphorus has been shown to be both necessary, because the names pick out the same thing in all possible worlds, and a posteriori, because this claim was discovered by empirical research. Other instances of a posteriori necessary truths include: \\"H2O is water\\".  Significance  Naming and necessity is among the most important philosophical works of the 20th century. The prospect of a posteriori necessity also makes the distinction between a prioricity, analyticity, and necessity harder to discern because they were previously thought to be largely separated from the a posteriori, the synthetic, and the contingent. With the example ‚ÄúHesperus is Phosphorus‚Äù, Kripke seems to have provided a successful counter-example to the Kantian claims: (a) P is a priori iff P is necessary. (b) P is a posteriori iff P is contingent. Hilary Putnam comments on the significance of Kripke‚Äôs counter- examples, \\"Since Kant there has been a big split between philosophers who thought that all necessary truths were analytic and philosophers who thought that some necessary truths were synthetic a priori. But none of these philosophers thought that a (metaphysically) necessary truth could fail to be a priori.‚Äù  See also  *Necessity of identity *Descriptivist theory of names *Causal theory of reference *Rigid designator *Modality *Necessity  References  Category:Epistemology ","title":"A posteriori necessity"},{"id":"40957549","text":"Byron Douglas Thweatt (born March 21, 1978) is an American football coach and former player.

Looney Tunes cartoon directed by Chuck Jones. The short was released on January 6, 1945, and was the first appearance of the romantic skunk Pep√© Le Pew. The scriptwriter was Tedd Pierce. Jones, a co-creator of the character, also credited Michael Maltese with contributing to the character concept. Plot After so much abuse (being thrown out of a store, shooed from a house, and attacked by dogs), an orange cat decides he has gotta do something about it. Thinking that it would make things easier, the cat disguises himself as a skunk using paint and smelly substances. Although he is successful in keeping his tormentors at bay, he accidentally attracts the unwanted attention of a real skunk, \\"Henri.\\" The cat runs from him and hides in a tree, where the skunk then appears out of nowhere. The cat runs into town, grabs a skunk fur, then runs to a silo, from which he threatens to jump if the skunk gets any closer. The cat throws the skunk fur from the top of the silo, hoping to decoy the skunk. But as the cat sneaks down the steps, Henri realizes that the fur is just a fur and resumes pursuing the cat. Continuing to run, the cat accidentally brings a dog into the mix, then tries a Bugs Bunny costume to fool Henri. But the disguise does not work, as the skunk pulls the rabbit head off to reveal the cat. Once the cat is tired and worn out, Henri cuddles with him until someone interrupts; it turns out to be the skunk's wife and two kids. Standing in disbelief, Henri claims he was only \\"wiping a cinder from a lady's eye,\\" but she, still thinking that he is cheating on her with someone else beguins to repeatedly beat him on the head with his wife's umbrella as the cat crawls away to escape and removes all of the paint and smell. He realizes that he would rather endure the abuse than be with a smelly skunk. Analysis The film is not part of the typical formula for the Pep√© Le Pew series of cartoons, since the character is \\"unknowingly\\" attracted to a male cat. Most of the films in the series are \\"Picaresque stories of seduction and sexual conquest or its failure\\". Part of the film's twist ending is that Pep√© is revealed as an American skunk who fakes his French accent.

It is one of the largest providers of such services in England.  History  The trust was formed on 1 April 2011 following the merger of Hampshire Community Healthcare NHS Trust and Hampshire Partnership NHS Foundation Trust. Operations The trust runs Eastrop House and Parklands Hospital in Basingstoke, Hollybank and Elmleigh in Havant, Postern House in Marlborough, Melbury Lodge and Leigh House in Winchester, Crowlin House and Forest Lodge, Woodhaven, Western Community Hospital, Antelope House and Moorgreen Hospital in Southampton, Fareham Community Hospital and Ravenswood House in Fareham, Jacobs Lodge in Hounsdown, as well as Chase Community Hospital, Alton Community Hospital, Fordingbridge Hospital, Romsey Hospital, Petersfield Hospital and Gosport War Memorial Hospital. The Trust is one of eight in a partnership of NHS mental health trusts to provide acute mental health inpatient services for military personnel. The Trust retained the contract to provide mental health beds for military personnel in the South of England. In July 2016 it was announced that the trust would transfer community learning disability services in Oxfordshire to Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust as part of a plan to reduce the area served and the disparate services provided. It took over five General practices in Gosport in 2016. The practices merged to form The Willow Group, which holds a general medical services contract jointly with the Trust. Performance The Trust's Going Viral programme won the Leadership Innovation category at the first Guardian Healthcare Innovation Awards in November 2013. In November 2013 the Care Quality Commission issued an enforcement notice to the trust after inspection of the Headington site found it to be in breach of six essential standards. Slade House was found to be unsafe for patients. The trust was named by the Health Service Journal as one of the top hundred NHS trusts to work for in 2015. At that time it had 6662 full time equivalent staff and a sickness absence rate of 4.95%. 64% of staff recommend it as a place for treatment and 53% recommended it as a place to work. Oxfordshire County Council‚Äôs adult social care director and local Clinical commissioning groups decided that the trust‚Äôs contract to run specialist inpatient services and community teams in Oxfordshire should not be renewed when it expired on 31 December 2015 after regulators and commissioners had raised \\"quality and performance concerns\\" about inpatient services. The Care Quality Commission rated the trust‚Äôs learning disability inpatient services as ‚Äòrequiring improvement‚Äô in March 2015 though community learning disability services were rated as ‚Äògood‚Äô. It is one of the Multispecialty community providers established under the Five Year Forward View and is setting up a contract with a GP practice whereby 10 practice employees - the non-clinical staff, the salaried GPs and two out of the four partners - will become trust employees. The two remaining doctors will continue to own the practice, which will be the joint owner, with the trust, of a company which will hold the General Medical Services Contract. It achieved an operating surplus of ¬£0.2 million for 2017/18 but a deficit of ¬£8.8 million after non-operating costs (financing costs and gain on asset sales) were taken in to account. A report by Mazars for NHS England looked at all 10,306 deaths at the trust between April 2011 and March 2015. According to a draft version of the report leaked to the BBC, 1,454 of these deaths were unexpected, and only 195 were treated as a serious incident requiring investigation. The reports were criticised for being late and of poor quality. Very few deaths of people with learning disability or dementia were investigated and there was little family involvement. Southern Health accepts that its investigations needed to improve, but disputes the report's interpretation of the data. The trust maintains that it is not an outlier in respect of any mortality indicators and that it investigated the deaths which were its responsibility. 143 deaths were suicide or suspected suicide - comparable with other similar trusts. The vast majority of deaths were of patients for whose care the trust was not primarily responsible. Trust chairman Mike Petter and Mark Aspinall one of the public governors resigned in April 2016 shortly before the trust was condemned by the Care Quality Commission for \\"continuing to put patients at risk\\" and failing to put in place \\"robust governance\\" to investigate incidents, including deaths, and to respond to concerns raised by patients, their carers and staff. Aspinall said the Council of Governors ought to regard itself, as part of the leadership of the Trust, equally culpable. John Green another public governor resigned in July 2016 citing the board's \\"farcical\\" response to last year's Mazars report The Trust has been subject over the last year to a number of Enforcement Undertakings required by Monitor, the latest being issued on 30 June 2016. The learning disability services in Oxfordshire were transferred to Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust. Some specialist learning disability services are to be transferred to Hertfordshire Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust. Katrina Percy, the chief executive, resigned in 2016. In March 2017 all four non-executive directors resigned.

This Concordat is a remnant of the Napoleonic Concordat of 1801. The 1801 Concordat was abrogated in the rest of France by the law of 1905 on the separation of church and state. However, at the time, Alsace-Moselle had been annexed by Germany, so the Concordat remained in force in these areas. The Concordat recognises four religious traditions in Alsace-Moselle: three branches of Christianity (Catholic, Lutheran and Reformed) plus the Jewish religion. Therefore, the French concept of la√Øcit√©, a rigid separation of church and state, does not apply in this region. Several French governments have considered repealing the Concordat, but none have done so. On 21 February 2013, the Constitutional Council of France upheld the Concordat, reaffirming its validity, in response to an appeal from a secularist group which claimed that the Concordat in Alsace-Moselle contradicted the secular nature of the French Republic. Religious education Under the Concordat, religious education is compulsory in public schools, at both primary and secondary level, although parents can now opt for a secular equivalent by a written request. These religious education lessons are given by members of the faiths concerned and under the control of the respective churches. Ministers Religious ministers in Alsace-Moselle (pastors, priests and rabbis of the four recognised faiths) receive a salary from the Interior Ministry, which, by virtue of the 1993 Lang-Cloupet agreement, is linked to civil service salary scales. In 2012, this was said to be costing the French state 54 million euros per year. They also qualify for unemployment benefits. The Bishops of Metz and Strasbourg are appointed by decree of the President of the Republic, after agreement with the Holy See. This makes France the only country in the world where some Catholic bishops are still appointed by the head of state. The actual involvement of the French state is however nowadays considered purely nominal (although a recent appointment to the see of Metz was blocked at an early stage). Chief rabbis and presidents of the Jewish and Protestant consistories are appointed by the Prime Minister. Ministers of the three Christian churches are appointed by the Interior Minister. Theology faculties The University of Strasbourg includes two faculties of theology, one Protestant, the other Catholic. These are the only theology faculties in France, although the University of Lorraine in Metz also has a theology department. Both faculties are responsible for training ministers for their respective religious traditions. The Catholic faculty comes directly under the authority of the Holy See, and the diplomas that it awards are recognised by the Holy See as canonical. Other religions and religious traditions There have been a number of attempts to extend the coverage of the Concordat to recognise other religions, notably Islam, as well as other branches of Christianity.

Scharinska villan was designed by the architect Ragnar √ñstberg and it was erected in 1904-1905 for Egil Unander- Scharin and his family. In the 1950s the building also housed the family business AB Scharins S√∂ner.  The building  Scharinska villan's door with a relief drawn by Ragnar √ñstberg. The exterior of the building is somewhat Victorian. There is a gable crest over the windows, with prominent arched windows on the ground floor. The small Rococo inspired balconies are wrought iron. The house is three stories high, with a volume offset to one side which is contrasting with the otherwise consistent symmetry. The refurbish facade is slightly reddish with a frieze under the third floor's row of windows. Also the interior is lavish with wood-paneled walls, except in the so-called Spanish Hall, whose renovated walls are covered in mosaics from Spain. The front door at the main entrance has a scene in relief that is designed by Ragnar √ñstberg. The subject is an abundant foliage with the faces of seven kids with a stork in the middle. The seven faces symbolize the seven children in the Scharin family.Andr√©n, pages 26 and 27 Scharinska villan is considered one of √ñstberg's best works during his youth. A hedge runs around the property towards the streets Storgatan and D√∂belnsgatan. South of the gardener's house there is a paved garden (with brick colored concrete tiles), surrounded by arched metal trellis to the south and west and a metal rail towards the east. To the north of the building there is a paved parking lot. The parking lot also serves as an entrance to the municipal real estate concern Bostaden's headquarters.  The gardener's house  The gardener's house, from the south. An outbuilding, also known as the annexe or gardener's house, belongs to the villa. The outbuilding is located west of the main building and it has a style that connects to the villa. The outhouse is one floor with a furnished loft in the western part, and is one and a half floor in the eastern part. The outhouse originally was the home for the gardener of the villa, and stables with accommodation for a coachman. The greenhouse that for a long time was located at its southern side was demolished in the 1980s. The outhouse, whose interior is not classified as a protected building, has in modern times been redone into four garages with brown glazed hinged doors made of wood.  History  Scharinska villan during construction in 1905. When planning for a new house the superintendent Egil Unander-Scharin contacted several architects, including Gustav Hermansson who had designed many houses in Sundsvall (after the devastating fire that burnt down the city in 1888) and Ernst Stenhammar who was the architect for Svenska Handelsbanken's bank building in Ume√•, built in 1894. Unander-Scharin was not happy with their suggestions and instead gave the assignment to architect √ñstberg.Andr√©n, p. 13. On July 4, 1904 Unander-Scharin was granted building permits for plot 2 and 3 in block H√§rmod (plot 1 was already developed) and already the day after the excavation for the house foundation started. On July 14, Unander-Scharin paid 7,894.85 to Ume√• city for the two plots.Andr√©n, pp. 15-16. The placement of these plots was the result of the city plan from 1889, where all plots within the area affected by the city fire in 1888 were redrawn. Unander- Scharin two plots had been vacant since the fire.Eriksson, p. 145, 146 and 149. The final cost for the villa was estimated to be 94,000, of which 12,000 was for furnishing and 4,000 kronor for √ñstberg's architectural drawings.Andr√©n, p. 29.  In modern times  In 1959 the Scharin family sold the building to Ume√• municipality who restored the villa and made several changes as the municipality was planning to use the villa for student union activities.Olofsson, p. 97. Since then, the municipality has deeded the building to activities for association and Students' unions. The same year that Scharinska villan became a listed building in 1981, it was agreed between Ume√• municipality and Ume√• Student Union and Universum how the building should be used. Following a call for tenders in 1996 Ume√• Student Union of Science and Technology moved into the house, but they withdrew from the contract at the turn of 2003/2004. The operation, which has hitherto been in nonprofit auspices, was taken over by Ekonomiska F√∂reningen f√∂r Alternativ Kultur i Ume√• (EFAK) (Economic Association of Alternative Culture in Ume√•), who re- inaugurate the villa in the autumn of 2004. During the years 2006-2013 the activity in the villa was privately run as a rock club called Scharinska, with a banquet room, cellar pub, a tavern and a stage for live music. At the turn of 2013/2014 the business was moved to the new Guitars ‚Äì the museum at Vasaskolan. In the autumn of 2013 a major exterior renovation of the building began, and on January 31, 2014 and interior renovation began that is expected to take one year. In the meantime, the tenants leave.

It is unusual among Cherubini's overtures in that his other, better known overtures (such as those to Anacreon, M√©d√©e, Les deux journ√©es and Ali Baba), were intended to introduce stage works. Although born in Italy Cherubini had been living in France since 1784, and had earned world fame through a series of operas composed for the Paris stage. In the first decade of the nineteenth century the vogue for his dramatic works began to wane, and he turned increasingly to sacred music. Description Cherubini composed the Overture in G major on commission from the Royal Philharmonic Society in London, which had engaged him to conduct a series of concerts in the spring of 1815 and asked him to provide three new works for the programs: an overture, a symphony and a cantata. Cherubini began the composition of the overture in Paris in February and finished the score in London the following month. He conducted the premiere on April 3, and the work enjoyed a warm reception. By contrast, Cherubini‚Äôs new Symphony in D major, unveiled some weeks later, proved a decisive failure. The irony is that today the Symphony is heard with some frequency (several recordings have long been available) while the overture remains formidably obscure. The Overture in G major has, however, a full measure of the dramatic atmosphere that characterizes his opera overtures. Indeed, after the stately opening gestures of its Larghetto introduction, an undercurrent of unease becomes apparent, conveyed by chromatic twists in the bass, and by an early turn from G into E-flat, which mixes G-minor vocabulary into the major-mode context. Strings are muted throughout the introduction. As foreshadowed, a fiery G minor Allegro spiritoso soon appears, bristling with energy, although the main theme is somewhat formulaic. The formidable quality of Cherubini‚Äôs mind, however, may be savored in an elegant contrapuntal woodwind interplay that prepares the theme‚Äôs counterstatement: 500px Following a dramatic climax, a transition passage promises a second subject in B-flat major. But Cherubini sidesteps with a chorale-like string theme in warm, distant D-flat major: 400px A flowing B-flat major theme follows, and after a triumphant exposition close, the development begins with a passage that transforms the chorale into new theme (see example), delivered by antiphonal horns against pattering bassoons. The development section is pithy and brief. In the reprise, Cherubini discards the exposition's sidestepping modulation as a twice-told tale, and, moreover, replaces the initial second-subject theme with the quoted development variant. A presto coda begins with what is in effect an aristocratic forebear of a Rossini-crescendo, building from pianissimo to fortissimo, and bold reminders of G minor punctuate before the overture ends in triumph.

It has adopted the Small Learning Community model. History=Founding In the 1940s the Knoxville City School System served the city's high school students in three schools - Knoxville High School, Rule High School, and Stair Technical High School. The majority of these students attended Knoxville High, a facility that was greatly in need of renovation if it was to continue housing 2,000 plus students. In lieu of this expenditure, the school board and the city council voted to build a new high school in each geographical area of the city. Thomas N. Johnston, principal of Stair Tech, was to become the principal of the new school in the north area. After the blueprints were drawn Mr. Johnston carried them in the trunk of his car as he toured the North Knoxville neighborhood looking for the perfect building site. He finally chose land at the corner of Broadway and Woodland Avenue in the Scott Park community which the city of Knoxville then purchased from three families who jointly owned it. On March 5, 1949 the site was the scene of the groundbreaking ceremony that launched the building of Knoxville's first comprehensive high school - a school with both an academic and vocational curriculum. The school was to be named Fulton High School in recognition of Weston Miller Fulton, a noted inventor and industrialist. Several of Mr. Fulton's original blueprints are on display at the school, as well as his oil portrait which was given to the school by the Fulton family. Construction was begun on Fulton High School in the Spring of 1949 by Foster & Creighton Contractors, and was to be completed for the opening of school in 1951 at a cost of $1.5 million. The first students attended the new school in September 1951, most of them having previously attended Christenberry Junior High School. Symbols Thomas N. Johnston served as principal from 1951 to 1955, with a faculty of 49 members. The faculty also served as advisors to the first senior class as it selected the school mascot \\"The Falcons\\", proposed by Rose Butler Sanders, reasoning that falcons are birds that are \\"strong fliers that soar high into the sky\\". The school colors chosen were maroon and white. The school newspaper was named The Falcon Quill, and the first yearbook named The Falcon. In a slogan contest in the late 1960s, the winning entry was ‚ÄúEnter to learn; go forth to serve‚Äù, and this has been adopted as the motto of Fulton High School. Restructuring 2007 During the early 2000s, it was evident that standards and rigor in education were quickly changing and the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act of 2001 was implemented. Due to faltering graduation rates at Fulton, as well as other deficiencies with regard to NCLB standards, educators were forced to make drastic changes. In 2007 and under the tutelage of Dr. Jon Rysweck, Fulton High School was divided into the current structure of five \\"small learning communities\\" (SLCs). Structure Each of the five SLCs has its own principal, guidance counselor and student advocate. Students also wear different colored shirts, which are exclusive to their SLC population. The three upper-house SLCs are occupied by juniors and seniors. Students choose an SLC based on interests as they relate to furthering their education or career: the options are School of Communications (FulCom), The School of Health Science, and The School of Skilled Professions. The two lower-house SLCs, for freshman and sophomores, are named for two species of falcons: The Merlin Wing and The Peregrine Wing. Notable alumni * D.D.

He was a cavalry officer, and commanded the 3rd Dragoon Guards and the Heavy Brigade in the Peninsular War. He was MP for Wareham in the years 1807‚Äì1808. Early life He was the younger son of John Calcraft of Rempston Hall in the Isle of Purbeck, and brother of John Calcraft the younger (1765‚Äì1831). Like his brother, he was illegitimate, the son of the actress Elizabeth Bride.History of Parliament Online, Calcraft, Sir Granby Thomas (?1767‚Äì1820). Calcraft entered the army as a cornet in the 15th Light Dragoons in March 1788, and was promoted lieutenant in 1793; in that year his regiment was ordered to join the force under the Duke of York and Albany in Flanders. With it he served at the Battle of Famars, the siege of Valenciennes, and the Battle of Villers-en-Cauchies, where a small force of the 15th Light Dragoons and Austrian hussars defeated a French corps. All the eight officers of the 15th present there were knighted, and received the Order of Maria Theresa from Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor. In the same month, April 1794, Calcraft was promoted captain, and his regiment was frequently engaged throughout the disastrous retreat of the following winter. In 1799 Calcraft accompanied Henry William Paget, who commanded the cavalry brigade in the Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland, as aide-de-camp; he was wounded at the Battle of Alkmaar on 1 October, and was for his services promoted major into the 25th Light Dragoons in December 1799. In the following year he exchanged into the 3rd Dragoon Guards, of which he became lieutenant-colonel on 25 December 1800, and he commanded the regiment until his promotion to the rank of major-general in 1813. Peninsular War In 1807 Calcraft was elected Member of Parliament for Wareham, but resigned his seat at the close of 1808 on his regiment being ordered for service in the Iberian Peninsula. The 3rd Dragoon Guards were brigaded with the 4th Dragoons under the command of Henry Fane, as the Heavy Brigade, which was engaged in the Battle of Talavera. General Fane fell ill, and Calcraft assumed the command of the Brigade, which he held until the arrival of George de Grey in May 1810. The Brigade was frequently engaged during the retreat to Torres Vedras, and again in the pursuit of General Andr√© Mass√©na in March 1811. After the combat of Foz d'Aronce, the Heavy Brigade served on the left bank of the Tagus under Marshal Beresford. Calcraft, who had been promoted colonel for his services on 25 July 1810, was engaged at the head of his regiment at the Battle of Campo Maior, at the Battle of Albuera, and in William Lumley's charge at Los Santos on 16 April 1811. In January 1812 the Heavy Brigade, which was again temporarily under the command of Calcraft, assisted in covering the siege of Ciudad Rodrigo, and when Wellington formed the Siege of Badajoz, it was left with General Graham's division to watch Auguste Marmont. After the Battle of Salamanca the cavalry division was in the action at Llera on 11 June 1812, when General Charles Lallemand's cavalry was cut to pieces, and Calcraft was mentioned in General Slade's report. The Brigade was then engaged in covering Rowland Hill's retreat from Madrid, and in December 1812 Calcraft was made a knight of the Portuguese Order of the Tower and Sword for his services. On 4 June 1813 he was promoted major- general, and left the Peninsula theatre. Later life The ministry disliked Calcraft's opinions, and his brother attacked it for \\"jobbery\\". In 1813 he was appointed to the command of a brigade in England, and in 1814 received a gold medal for the battle of Talavera. In 1814 he gave up his staff appointment, and lived in retirement, until his death on 20 August 1820.

He always recalls crash B-daman as his best friend, and believe in the spirit of B-ders. :Tamago always play his game fairly, and he usually has his own unique style of playing, without logic. He respects the other B-ders the same way he respects everything about B-daman, and he'll never let a single one humiliate the B-da spirit of all B-ders. :Tamago has a total of eight B-damans in the history of Super B-daman series, including his first ever B-daman, White B-daman. All of his B-damans are Power-Type. These are Tamago's B-daman, listed order of B-daman he received. :* White B-daman (Owned at the beginning of the story, supposedly from his father) :* Fighting Phoenix (The first upgraded version of OS B-daman, received after White B-daman is destroyed by Ijuin's drive shot) :* Battle Phoenix (Power-Type PI B-daman, received after Fighting Phoenix is destroyed by Ijuin's Kong Cerberus in the final round of JBA tournament) :* Combat Phoenix (Power-Type PI-EX B-daman, received at the second round of second JBA tournament) :* Guardian Phoenix (Power-Type RE B-daman, received at the final round of second JBA tournament) :* Speed Phoenix (Power-Type R-Unit B-Daman) :* Vanguard Phoenix(Power-Type E-Unit B-daman, received at the final round of final battle in JBA ) :* Smash Phoenix (???) :Although, Tamago can by clumsy and too innocent at time being, while sighting the world at the bright side. He's not the smartest one after all, but his instinct and power is beyond normal. ;Nishibe Gunma / Sniper Gunma of the West :Tamago's best friend, and also his long-time rival. Gunma is the most famous B-ders from Kanzai, who is commonly known as \\"Sniper Gunma\\" or \\"Sniper from the West\\", from his unique accuracy and rapid fire skills. :Gunma is a very strategic and intelligent person. His plan always work as effectively as he planned, and he may even think of some craziest ever tactics to overcome the enemies. He's the main man of Team Guts, and supposedly, the leader of the team. :Although, unlike Tamago, Gunma is more mature and reasoning. He look at both side of the world, to observe the good and bad of the situation. However, after being friend with Tamago, Gunma's mind sometimes becomes out-of-reason, resulting himself trying out many mission-impossible tactics when Tamago is around. Gunma believes that Tamago's spirit and power are beyond normal, and he admitted that when Tamago is around, anything can be possible. :In the history of Super B-daman series, Gunma supposedly has a total of 6 main b-daman (excluding his collections of other B-daman for researching and developing new tactics).

Gunma also hates to be humiliated by some B-ders, for being in an infamous unknown team like Team Guts, and for being weak without power. Gunma's only weak point is that he's scared of ghosts. ;Sarah / Magician Sarah :* Golden B-daman :* Stagg Sphinx :* Stagg Cerberus :* Power Sphinx =New members= The two new members are as follow: ;Kazama Yoshinori / Billy the Wild Wind of the East :* 2 Bomber System B-daman :* Blast Eagle and Blast Lion >>> Blast Griffon :* Phantom Eagle and Phantom Lion >>> Phantom Griffon :* Mirage Eagle and Mirage Lion >>> Mirage Griffon ;Negota Nekomaru :* Bomber System B-daman :* Hunting Lynx =Team assistance= The assistance of this team is Dr. Tamano, who is one of the JBA staff that create and research about B-Daman.

In 1928, he cofounded Shanghai Manhua, one of the earliest and most influential manhua magazines, and created Mr. Wang, one of China's most famous comic strips. Ye was also a master of traditional Chinese painting and served as the head of the Department of Chinese Painting of the China Central Academy of Fine Arts. During the Cultural Revolution he was persecuted and imprisoned for seven years. Ye was married three times. His first two marriages, to Luo Caiyun and dancer Dai Ailian, ended in divorce. His third marriage, to movie star Wang Renmei, lasted more than 30 years until Wang's death. Early life Ye Qianyu was born Ye Lunqi () in Tonglu county, Zhejiang province in 1907. Although he loved to paint since childhood, he had neither the money nor the opportunity to seek professional training, forcing him to teach himself how to paint. Career in Shanghai Ye's Unfortunate Love, cover for Shanghai Manhua, 16 June 1928 At age 18 Ye moved to Shanghai, where he found work at a small, short-lived journal Sanri Huabao (Three Day Pictorial). The journal shut down when Chiang Kai-shek's Northern Expedition army reached Shanghai in April 1927. Out of work, Ye Qianyu, then 20 years old, together with fellow cartoonists Huang Wennong and Lu Shaofei released a publication dedicated to manhua, called Shanghai Manhua (or Shanghai Sketch). The first effort looked like a propaganda poster and was a failure. Undeterred, the original three, joined by eight more artists including Zhang Guangyu, Ding Song, and Wang Dunqing, formed the Shanghai Sketch Society (also translated as Shanghai Cartoon Association) in the autumn of 1927. It was China's first association dedicated to manhua, and its debut was a major event in the history of Chinese comics. Under the leadership of Zhang Guangyu, who recruited the wealthy poet Shao Xunmei as a sponsor, the association successfully relaunched the Shanghai Manhua on 21 April 1928. Ye drew several covers for the magazine and the back page of the publication carried his comic strip, Mr. Wang. Inspired by the American strip Bringing Up Father and portraying the daily life of the middle and lower classes of Shanghai, Mr. Wang became one of China's most famous cartoons, eventually being made into 11 films in the 1930s and 40s. In June 1930 Shanghai Manhua was merged into Modern Miscelleny (or Modern Pictorial, Êó∂‰ª£ÁîªÊä•), of which Ye became an editor while continuing his Mr. Wang series. In September 1936, Ye Qianyu, Lu Shaofei, and Zhang Guangyu organized the First National Cartoon Exhibition in Shanghai. It displayed over 600 cartoons from all over the country. After the overwhelming success of the exhibition, the artists formed the National Association of Chinese Cartoonists in the spring of 1937. The blossoming movement, however, was brought to a halt by the Japanese invasion a few months later. Second Sino-Japanese War \\"Abandon the Civilian Life, Join the Army\\": Ye's 1939 Mr. Wang cartoon reflects the artist's own life during the Japanese invasion. When Japan invaded China and occupied Shanghai in 1937, Ye Qianyu, together with a group of fellow Shanghai cartoonists, formed the \\"National Salvation Cartoon Propaganda Corps\\", which included well-known artists Zhang Leping, Lu Zhixiang, Te Wei, and Hu Kao. Ye's lover, Liang Baibo, was the only female member. Funded by the Kuomintang government, the corps left Shanghai for the interior to spread anti-Japanese propaganda. They first went to Wuhan, but were forced to leave when that city fell at the end of 1938. They then travelled to Changsha, Guilin, and eventually to the wartime capital Chongqing. They published 15 issues of Resistance Cartoons before the government discontinued funding. Ye went to Hong Kong prior to its fall to the Japanese in December 1941, and traveled through Guizhou, Guangxi, and Vietnam. In 1943 he temporarily worked for the US General Joseph Stilwell as a war correspondent in India. Throughout his travels he drew many sketches of wartime scenes, including a series entitled Escape from Hong Kong. After World War II After the surrender of Japan in 1945, Ye Qianyu went to the United States, where he held a series of exhibitions to show and sell his artworks. In 1947, Ye became a professor at the Beiping (Beijing) Art Academy. After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, he remained at the academy, which was transformed into the China Central Academy of Fine Arts. He was also elected vice-chairman of the China Artists Association. In 1954, he was appointed head of the Chinese Painting Department of the academy. He painted prolifically in the 1950s, including such representative works as Indian Dancing, Autumn of the Summer River, and The Liberation of Beiping. When the Cultural Revolution began in 1966, Ye Qianyu was accused of being a Kuomintang (KMT) agent for having drawn propaganda paintings and cartoons for the KMT government during the Japanese invasion. The Red Guards labeled him as a KMT \\"Major General\\" because he was better paid than a real general. He was imprisoned for seven years. After his release in 1975, he was allowed to return to work at the Central Academy of Fine Arts, as a janitor. He nearly died of a heart attack the following year, and underwent a major operation in 1978. His wife Wang Renmei supported the family during this period. Ye Qianyu was politically rehabilitated in 1979. In 1981 he was appointed Vice President of the Research Institute of Chinese painting, and re-elected vice-chairman of the China Artists Association and member of the National Committee of the CPPCC. He died in 1995 in Beijing, aged 88. Personal life Ye Qianyu with his first wife Luo Caiyun Ye Qianyu with his second wife Dai Ailian and daughter Ye Mingming Ye Qianyu was married three times. At age 23, he married Luo Caiyun (), who was from a prominent family in his hometown Tonglu. The marriage was arranged by their parents. She gave birth to a son Ye Shen () and a daughter Ye Mingming (). In 1935, while he was an editor with the Modern Sketch magazine, Ye fell in love with Liang Baibo, one of the first female Chinese cartoonists and creator of the comic strip Miss Bee. Luo Caiyun rejected Ye's request for divorce, but they agreed to become legally separated. At the start of the Sino-Japanese War, Liang Baibo joined Ye's Salvation Cartoon Propaganda Corps and went to Wuhan with him. However, Liang met and fell in love with an air force pilot in Wuhan, eventually following him to Taiwan. She suffered from mental illness in her later years and committed suicide circa 1970. In 1940 Ye Qianyu met the dancer Dai Ailian in Hong Kong. An overseas Chinese born in Trinidad, Dai had come to Hong Kong to support the war effort. Although Dai could not speak Chinese and Ye spoke little English, they fell in love and got married within a few weeks. Soong Ching-ling, the widow of President Sun Yat-sen, presided over their wedding. Because of a botched surgery in Hong Kong, Dai was unable to have children. According to Ye Qianyu's daughter Mingming, who lived with her father and was initially hostile to her stepmother, Dai treated her as if she had been her own child. In 1950 Ye spent more than half a year in Xinjiang. When he returned to Beijing, Dai Ailian unexpectedly asked for divorce, because she had fallen in love with her dance partner. Ye was devastated; the divorce was finalized in 1951. Dai Ailian lived until 2006, and is now known as the \\"Mother of Chinese ballet\\". Ye's last wife was Wang Renmei, a famous actress who had been previously married to the \\"Film Emperor\\" Jin Yan. Introduced by mutual friends, they got married in 1955. The marriage was stormy from the beginning, but it lasted more than 30 years, through the turmoil of the Cultural Revolution, until Wang's death in 1987. Luo Caiyun, Ye Qianyu's first wife, lived with their son Ye Shen in Wuxi, Jiangsu. When Ye Qianyu was accused of being a KMT agent and thrown into prison during the Cultural Revolution, Luo was persecuted for being his ex-wife. She committed suicide in 1970.

Geography Farmland at Osgodby Coppice, in the West of the parish The highest land at the east and west is a small plateau of a Kellaways Sandstone laid down approximately 161 to 165 million years ago in the Jurassic Period. These lie some 80m above sea level. The East Glen valleys cut through this to a slightly older Blisworth Clay Mudstone layer, exposing thin layers on Kellaways clay and Cornbrash limestone on the way. The whole is overlaid with Quaternary glacial till from the recent Pleistocene. The lowest point in the parish is probably about 45m at the Ford in Osgodby, across the east Glen.

He was also businessman, lawyer, World War II veteran, and public servant. Silvino Barsana Agudo Origin: Agudo family name The Agudo last name is traced back to ‚ÄúTuvid du Matarem‚Äù of Ivana, Batanes in 1751. When the Spanish missionaries observed that people had no formal name upon arrival to Batanes, the missionaries assigned names. Through the help of an interpreter, the Spanish asked, ‚ÄúWho is the leader of this village?‚Äù The leader of the Ivana village was ‚ÄúTuvid du Matarem.‚Äù In Ivatan, ‚ÄúTuvid‚Äù means one who knows all things ‚Äì like when it is the right time to fish, when to plant camote and other crops, and assist in giving birth. This is why ‚ÄúTuvid‚Äù was leader of his village. They called him ‚Äúdu Matarem‚Äù because he lived at the foot of the mountain called Mt. Matarem. The mountain was called ‚ÄúMatarem‚Äù because it means sharp in Ivatan and the mountain looks like the sharp edge of a bolo. It was because ‚ÄúTuvid‚Äù knew everything and seemed to be sharp and because he lived at the edge of a sharp mountain the Spaniards rightfully gave the family name ‚ÄúAgudo,‚Äù which was thought to mean sharp and bright in Spanish. The Spaniards then told ‚ÄúTuvid‚Äù the story of Jesus. ‚ÄúTuvid‚Äù was pleased with the story and advised all the villagers to hear the story as well. The village followed their leader, ‚ÄúTuvid,‚Äù and found the Spaniards warm and interesting and agreed to be baptized in 1773. ‚ÄúTuvid‚Äù was given the first name Eugenio, so thus his name was Eugenio Agudo. Eugenio had one son. The Spanish chose to give his son the name Jose after St. Joseph, the patron saint of Ivana, because the Spanish were so pleased with Eugenio‚Äôs assistance and compliance. This is how the Agudo name was born (the story of Tuvid provided by former Batanes Governor Silvino Barsana Agudo).  Silvino's early years Silvino Barsana Agudo was peacefully born on September 12, 1917, in the northern mainland provincial city of Tuguegarao, Cagayan, Philippines. Silvino was the second of six children of Pablo Agudo, a farmer turned tailor who was the youngest 9th of 10 children, and Consolacion Castillejos Barsana, was one of the first pre-school / elementary teachers in Ivana, both natives of Ivana, Batanes. Siblings: 1\\\\. VICENTE HOMOBONO AGUDO (born November 14, 1907; married Benjamina Pango of Ivana, they had 1 son, Vicente Jr.) 2\\\\. AURORA ELISA AGUDO (born April 22, 1915; died single and childless in 1949) 3\\\\. SILVINO ARTENIO AGUDO (born September 12, 1917; married Honorata P. Arcilla, they had 7 children) 4\\\\. ROBUSTIANO \\"ROBUST\\" FEDERICO AGUDO (born October 12, 1920; married Teodora \\"Dory\\" Villapando, they had 8 children) 5\\\\. RAMON AGUDO (born September 2, 1922; died single and childless in 1954) 6\\\\. DAZ AGUDO (born 1923 and died at the age of 5 due to the flu, trancaso) 7\\\\. SOCCORRO \\"CORRING\\" Agudo (born in 1925, married to Attorney and later Judge Deogracias Aggabao; they had three children. She died in 1960) Silvino's parents were natives of Ivana but later moved to mainland Luzon because \\"farming (in Batanes) could not support the local population.\\" Silvino's father, Pablo, fished for Arayu tuna and flying fish; he also grew \\"fertile but small crops\\" on Mount Matarem including tobacco, corn, and rice, and exported dried fish and dried garlic to Manila. Consequently, Silvino's father, Pablo, moved to Cagayan province and established a tailor shop in Tuguegarao, Cagayan, the capital of the province. His father's prospering business provided the opportunity for short vacations back to Ivana, Batanes. Silvino Barsana Agudo's mother, Consolacion Castillejos Barsana, was born December 27, 1882, in Ivana, Batanes. Silvino and his siblings called their mother Nana and father Tata as children until adulthood. Consolacion was one of the first to be taught English when the Americans came and consequently became a pre-school kindergarten teacher by profession. Her father, Luciano Barsana, served as Governor of Batanes. As a young boy, Silvino would often travel to Batanes for vacations with his father and brothers Robustiano and Ramon. They would go fishing for dibang flying fish and arayu tuna with their father and were there in Batanes during the Japanese construction of the national road including the construction of the landmark 'Payhaysan' found on the road connecting Basco to Mahatao to Ivana. Consolacion, Silvino's mother was very industrious; besides taking care of six children, she helped her husband's tailoring business and cooked lunch and dinner for the tailor shop staff. Silvino in his memoirs expressed he \\"never took for granted his mother' difficulties,\\" acknowledging that \\"giving birth in those years was an unbearable human sacrifice.\\" Silvino cared for his mother who suffered from tuberculosis due to \\"little rest and sleep.\\" Silvino was a constant companion, going from doctor to doctor, faith healer to faith healer. However, Silvino's mother died on May 7, 1930, in Tuguegarao, Cagayan, when Silvino Barsana Agudo was 13. Silvino wrote \\"the many years did not fade my memory of Nana's sacrifice.\\" Education Silvino Barsana Agudo graduated from Cagayan National High School in Tuguegarao, Cagayan in March 1935. Immediately, after high school graduation Silvino's father made arrangements for him to go to Manila to pursue further studies. Before boarding the 5 seater public use (PU) car Silvino's father said, \\"Binong, this is a day I will never forget; before your Nana left us, she made me promise that all of you children should study as high as you can. Now, you are going to Manila to study. To follow Bono (Silvino's older brother) who is now a lawyer in Manila.\\" That was the last time Silvino saw his father; barely six months later, Bono came to Silvino's boarding house on Andalucia Street near back of the University of Santo Tomas to show a telegram from Batanes with news of his father's passing sent from Ruring (1935). When Silvino mentioned the death of his father to his boss, Fr. Agustin Rihuete OP, he shook Silvino's hand in condolences and gave him PHP 100 which he gave to Bono to use for funeral expenses. For nine days Silvino left work early in the afternoon to pray for Tata in the UST Chapel and then left for school in the Main Building of the University. Bono brought the rest of his siblings, Ruring, Corring, Robust, and Ramon to Manila in 1935 after their father's death. Silvino Agudo graduated with a bachelor's degree in Commerce (which is now Business) with a major in Accounting from the University of Santo Tomas School. Silvino passed the Certified Public Accountant Exam (CPA) the following year. Silvino also graduated from University of Santo Tomas University Civil Law in 1941 and passed the Bar of the Philippines in December 2, 1941, at 27 years of age. Entry of Japanese into the Philippines and Batanes Early on December 8, 1941, Atty. Silvino Barsana Agudo was in the municipality of Santa Cruz, Laguna for a court hearing regarding a boundary dispute. While waiting for the judge at 8:00 am for trial proceeding, Atty. Silvino Barsana Agudo was informed that the judge was not coming anymore to the proceeding because the Japanese had bombarded Clark Field and Pearl Harbor. After 9:00 am, as Atty. Silvino Barsana Agudo left court and was on his way back to Manila, he noticed that every corner of Santa Cruz had posts to recruit for volunteers to join the Philippine Armed Forces to stop the Japanese forces who were coming in from the northern city of Ligayen, Pangasinan and Tayabas, Quezon in the southern Luzon. However, Atty. Silvino Barsana Agudo did not focus on that and proceeded to Manila, a trip that took one whole day. When Atty. Silvino Barsana Agudo arrived at his house in P. Campa Street along Espa√±a Boulevard, he found his house was filled with Ivatans. This was because when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor many dormitories closed in Manila and Ivatan students remembered the Agudo family. Atty. Silvino Barsana Agudo generously welcomed the Ivatans and assigned the girls to the upper floor and the boys on the lower floor and the Agudo sister, Aurora, prepared food for everyone. More Ivatans from Batangas and Cavite sought refuge at the Agudo family house. Atty. Silvino Barsana Agudo suggested for the new Ivatans who sought refuge to go to the house of Congressman Vicente Agan, Representative of Batanes; however, there was likewise no space. A messenger from Congressman Agan sent a note to the Agudo household regarding a Japanese sponsored boat that would take Ivatans back to Batanes with free passage. Military service During World War II, Atty. Silvino Barsana Agudo was drafted into the 7th Military Police Command. Silvino Barsana Agudo received military police training in Cavite, Rizal, and Nueva Ecija and was told his unit was to do service in Tokyo upon the surrender of the Japanese Imperial Army. However, the trip to was rescheduled by General Douglas McAurthur because of the unconditional surrender of Japan on September 3, 1945. In the Basco Program of the Veterans Federation of the Philippines two veterans received decoration for their service. Atty. Eliseo Reyes, who at the outbreak of the war in the Pacific was a constabulary soldier in Cebu, and Atty. Silvino Barsana Agudo. Commador Geronimo Cabal and Capt. Teofilo Vatoner, the highest officers of the Batanes Veteran's Association pinned the three medals and three ribbons on Atty. Eliseo Reyes and Atty. Silvino Barsana Agudo. Marriage and family life Silvino Barsana Agudo married Honorata Arcilla civilly in May 1949 and formally through the Catholic Church on December 10, 1949. Silvino and Honorata had 6 children namely: As a lawyer Agudo also presided as a defense lawyer in various criminal cases that made appeals in the Supreme Court of the Philippines on behalf of defendants with limited resources prosecuted for murder and rape. Silvino Agudo's law office, Agudo, Reyes, Estrella and Associates, was located in rooms 205 - 208 0f the Puzon Building in Quezon City (1974). Silvino Agudo hired and trained a young Diosdado Peralta, now Chief Justice of Supreme Court under President Rodrigo Duterte, to work in his law firm. Agudo took Diosdado Peralta, a recent University of Santo Tomas law school graduate, and assigned him to junior projects related to Cosmos Bottling company, which Silvino helped establish.  Nominations for Governor of Batanes  As the 1967 mid-election approached President Ferdinand Marcos moved to ensure that his Nacionalista Party would be victorius by electing most of the Senators, Governors, and Mayors of the country. President Ferdinand Marcos asked Chairman Manuel \\"Maning\\" Agudo to choose Silvino Barsana Agudo as candidate for Governor who will most likely win in Batanes. Manuel Agudo's reputation was critically important to Silvino Barsana Agudo's endorsement to run for Governor of Batanes because of his Chairmanship of the Civil Service Board of Appeals, tenure as Congressman of Batanes (1958‚Äì1961), and service as administrative officer in the Office of the President in Malaca√±ang Palace during the tenure of six Presidents of the Philippines, namely: Jos√© P. Laurel, Sergio Osme√±a, Manuel Roxas, Elpidio Quirino, Ramon Magsaysay, and Carlos P. Garcia. During this time Silvino Barsana Agudo was a successful law practitioner with many clients in the Filipino, American, Spanish, and Chinese communities. Precisely because of his success in law practice Silvino Barasana Agudo was induced to run for Governor of Batanes. Silvino Barsana Agudo agreed to participate in the Provincial Convention in Batanes and then boarded a Philippine Navy boat to Basco in the month of August 1967. Silvino Barsana Agudo's trip was delayed by a typhoon but when he arrived in Basco, the town was as he described it a \\"gog.\\" Manuel and Renee Agudo rented a house to stay and Silvino Barsana Agudo stayed in the house of his Uncle, Jose Barona, and Auntie Bilay (Severa) Barsana Barona, sister of Silvino's mother. On the night of his arrival the Batanes Veteran Association, a Chapter of the Veterans Association of the Philippines, had a program in the High School auditorium in which Silvino Barsana Agudo was recognized as a Veteran of World War II by the highest-ranking officers of the Batanes Veteran's Association. Two days after Atty. Silvino Barsana Agudo arrived in Basco, the Nacionalista Party Convention was held on top Tukon Hill. There was a band to render music while waiting for the delegates from each town: Basco, Itbayat, Mahatao, Uyugan, and Sabtang. When all the delegates arrived, nominations were made and three were nominated for Governor: Jose Aceron of Ivana, Tobias Abad of Basco, and Atty. Silvino Barsana Agudo of Ivana. After the nominations, Jose Martinez, Atty. Silvino Barsana Agudo's campaign manager, talked to delegates in each town without consulting Atty. Silvino Barsana Agudo. After the short campaigning, voting was done by secret ballot. At the end of the day, Mrs. Renee Agudo, Chairwoman of the Batanes Nacionalista Party announced the winning party candidates: Governor: Atty. Silvino B. Agudo; Vice Governor: Tobais Abad; Board Members (2): Emmanuel Aguasha of Mahatao and Francisco Bidayan of Basco After the convention all the official candidates took the same Philippine Navy Boat back to Manila. Mrs. Renee Agudo reported to President Ferdinand Marcos and Senator Gil Puyat the official candidates for the Nacionalista Party in Batanes. Within one month President Ferdinand Marcos invited all the candidates for governor and city mayor to Malaca√±ang Palace for individual conversations with the President. To everyone's surprise, President Marcos knew all candidates' names by heart. All candidates were also brought into a room filled with 6-foot piles of legal- sized brown envelopes. The President's aid gave one envelope to each candidate. However, Atty. Silvino Barsana Agudo was pulled aside and given a second envelope which was to be for the six candidates for mayor in the Province. Atty. Silvino Barsana Agudo took a taxi home and examined the contents of the brown envelopes ‚Äì each containing US$10,000 in $10 bills or $20,000 in all. In remembrance of President, Atty, Silvino Barsana Agudo bought a new refrigerator to change the old fridge. The rest of the money was distributed and spent for provisions to the Batanes campaign.  As Governor of Batanes  During his term (1968‚Äì1971), Governor Silvino Barsana Agudo supported the preservation and promotion of Batanes culture through various initiatives including research of archaic Itbayaten numeral writing systems.  Suzuki Boys  Governor Silvino Barsana Agudo presided over Batanes during one of the province's most tumultuous times and played an instrumental role in preventing election fraud in Batanes and protecting Ivatan people from armed thugs known as Suzuki Boys for the branded motorcycles used a vehicles of suppression. To this day in Batanes, political elections for the most part are different than many other provinces in Philippines - peaceful, festive, and a time of friendly encounters of opposing candidates and camps. However, this section is of particular importance as it will help document one of the darkest and unique events in Batanes' history. The takeover of the Batanes by the Suzuki thugs is a classic example of a swift coup of isolating an island group from the rest of the country. The Batanes Islands were cut off from airline flights and from telephone and telegraph communications. There were five candidates for the lone congressional seat of the province in 1969. The important candidates were: \\\\- Mrs. Renee Agudo (NP) \\\\- former Congressmen Jorge Abad (father of Department of Budget and Management Secretary Florencio Abad) \\\\- Rufino Antonio Jr. (Independent-NP; Businessman from Metro Manila who opened a Suzuki brand motorcycle dealership ) Weeks before the November 11, 1969 Elections, about 100 strange faces (non-Ivatans) landed in Basco and scattered in the six towns of the province. Crates also landed in Basco. In late October, as an effort to maintain security of the island, Governor Silvino Agudo instructed Provincial Commander (PC), Captain Fulgencio Albano, to collect licensed firearms from the residents \\"for verification.\\" Furthermore, Governor Silvino Barsana Agudo advised Provincial Command soldiers to meet Philippine Airline (PAL) Flights on October 26, 28 and November 2,4,and 6 to Basco to search landing passengers and their luggage for firearms. On November 9, PAL suspended flights to Basco because of man-caused obstructions in the runway. A number of privately owned planes, including light aircraft including a helicopter and Douglas DC-3 blocked Basco's runway. The PAL plane that carried Ivatan voters from Manila had to turn back. On November 10, a day before the elections, telegraph communications from Basco through the Bureau of Telecommunications and Station and Radio Communications of the Philippines Incorporated (RCPI) subsequently went dead. Armed goons had allegedly destroyed all private and government wireless facilities and drove away operators of the telcom and RCPI stations; an operator of the weather bureau was reportedly tear gassed. The equipment was destroyed, however, some operators who fled to the mountains used a transmitter to report \\"goon activities\\" and request the Provincial Commander Fulgencio Albano and President Ferdinand Marcos for aid. Later during the night of November 10, the Bureau of Public Highways compound was raided and vehicles were destroyed. Even before this, on October 24, Ivatans in Manila held a meeting at D & E Restaurant in Quezon City and decided to ask Provincial Command and Comelec to relieve Captain Fulgencio Albano of Batanes Provincial Command. On November 2, Major Benjamin Amante became the new Batanes PC Commander. On November 7, Major Amante and Representative Roque Ablan (Ilocos Norte) flew to Basco in Ablan's plane. Major Amante stayed only a few days then left Basco before elections. The PC Officer in charge was Captain Velasco. On election day November 11, 1969, the roads leading to the six towns of Batanes were barricaded by checkpoints manned by armed thugs. Governor Agudo and his party making tours of the towns were turned back at one of the checkpoints and warned if they proceeded they might be ambushed. An American Peace Corps Volunteer, Larry Jones, was given six hours to surrender photographs of goons terrorizing voters at precincts. Three days after the elections, Batanes was one of the few provinces from which results of the congressional elections were not heard. In the past elections, which were peaceful, results were known by the next day, there being only less than 5,000 votes to count. In Manila, Governor Silvino Agudo's wife, Honorata Agudo, asked Executive Secretary Ernesto Maceda to assign security men to her house near Quezon City because suspicious looking men were loitering near their home. In less than a week after the November 11, 1969 Congressional Elections, Ivatans, the residents of Batanes, were up in arms against the takeover of their islands by gangster- rule during the elections. Reports of the terror that gripped Batanes province have filtered to Manila only several days after the elections, and there was nothing they could do to change the results. All they could do was call public attention to the \\"rape of the ballot\\" in their province. Their grievances were not the sour grapes of defeated politicians. They come from plain citizens talking not as NPs or LPs but, as outraged citizens who were robbed of their right to vote at gunpoint. This excerpt also takes into account inputs from Bill Barsana and Celerina Navarro. Batanes Bicentennial Commission Gov. Silvino Barsana Agudo remained active in provincial affairs into his retired days as President of the Batanes Bicentennial Commission in 1983. In May 1983, on the initiative of the Dominican Fathers in Santo Domingo Church in Quezon City, a Bicentennial Commission was created to plan the celebration of the 200th Anniversary of the Christianization of Batanes and establishment of a centralized civil government therein. (In 1773, two missionaries from the Dominican Order from Tuguegarao, Cagayan landed in Ivana, Batanes and stayed to put up their church. Ten years later in June 1783, the Civil Government was established in Basco, Batanes) The Bicentennial Commission was composed of Ivatans from Manila environs invited by the Santo Domingo Fathers. The Fathers consulted Engineer Anastacio Agan, former Congressmen from Batanes and at that time incumbent Quezon City Engineer. Congressmen Agan was also the structural engineer who built the Santo Domingo Church on Quezon Avenue in Quezon City. He was assisted in the job of construction of the Santo Domingo Church by Engineer Ruperto Agudo. The assembly of Ivatans who were invited to form the Commission elected the following officers: President, Ex-Governor Silvino B. Agudo; Vice President and Chairman of the Committee on Public Information, Dr. Florentino H. Hornedo; Secretary, Fr. Alfonso Loreto, O.P.; Treasurer, Rev. Fr. Rey Adadlid, O.P.; Committee of Ways and Means: Chairman-Dr. Francisco Roman; Co-Chairman Mrs. Josefina Castro-Valera. Members were Mrs. Rucela Barsana Acacio, Mrs. Ana G. Agagan; Atty.

Ermito De Sagun, O.P., and Mrs. Eutropia Hornedo-Silvestre. The Bicentennial Anniversary was celebrated in two places, one in the Aquinas School at Sanctuario de Sto. Cristo at Blumentritt Road, San Juan Del Monte, Metro Manila and the other was held in Basco, Batanes under the joint auspices of the Provincial Government and the Bishop of Batanes Msgr. Mario Baltazar O.P. Silvino Agudo, as President of the Commission lead both occasions.

The road is located in Pecos County and connects the James Lynaugh Unit of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ) to Interstate 10 (I-10) and U.S. Highway 67 (US 67) west of the city of Fort Stockton while passing through the town of Belding. A portion of the route follows a former alignment of US 67 between Fort Stockton and Alpine. The route's numerical designation was previously assigned to a Farm to Market Road in Brazos County. Route description The road begins at the Lynaugh prison unit and proceeds to the east to Old Alpine Road. FM 2037 then follows Old Alpine Road to the northeast parallel with the South Orient Railroad passing through Belding. The road then turns north passing through orchards and cropland to I-10. FM 2037 ends along the south service road of I-10 to the west of the overpass at I-10 Exit 253 approximately west of Fort Stockton. FM 2037 has a rural major collector functional class as rated by TxDOT which has approved a speed limit of up to along the route. The section of the road from the prison to where the road diverges from Old Alpine Rd. north of Belding had an average annual daily traffic (AADT) count of 350 vehicles in 2010 including 3.2 percent peak hour truck usage, while the remaining section approaching I-10 had an AADT count of 240 with 3.7 percent peak hour truck usage. Future AADT in 2030 for the two road segments is projected to be 600 and 410 respectively. History FM 2037 was originally designated on December 17, 1952 as a route in northeastern Brazos County beginning along the concurrent routes of US 190 / SH 21 near the Navasota River proceeding to the northwest to the town of Edge. On November 21, 1956, that route was extended an additional to the southwest to FM 2038\\\\. The Brazos County designation was canceled on October 13, 1961 when the route was added as an extension to FM 974. On May 2, 1962, the current route was designated over a stretch from the Old Alpine Rd. to US 290, the route that preceded I-10. The route was extended to the prison site on October 29, 1992. The Old Alpine Rd. portion of the route has a much longer history with the state highway network. US 67 designation was extended westward from Dallas to Presidio in 1932. The portion of US 67 between Alpine and Fort Stockton was constructed as an unpaved earth road sometime between 1933 and 1936 and was also designated as State Highway 99 (SH 99) (later State Highway 10 (SH 99). The SH 10 designation did not survive the 1939 redescription of the state highway system, and US 67 was realigned off of the Old Alpine Rd. when its more westward current roadway was constructed in 1947.

He played a significant role in enhancing the growth of the Roman Catholic Church there and also in Nigeria. Early life The son of a Presbyterian minister, James Marshall, and his wife Catherine Mary Richmond, daughter of Legh Richmond, he was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, on 19 December 1829. He lost his right arm as the result of an accident at the age of 16. Anglican ministry and conversion to Catholicism After taking a degree at Exeter College, Oxford, he became a High Church Anglican minister in 1852 and was appointed curate in Trysull, near Wolverhampton. In 1854, he became curate at St. Bartholomew's Church, Moor Lane, in the parish of St. Giles, Cripplegate, London. Marshall was received into the Roman Catholic Church in 1857 but never became a Catholic priest. In 1863 he was appointed classical master at Birmingham Oratory School, where he became a friend of Cardinal Newman. Legal practice and judicial service Marshall studied law and was called to the Bar at the Middle Temple in 1868. He practised law in Manchester where he helped to found The Catholic Times. In 1873 he accepted an appointment in the British Colonial Service as Chief Magistrate and Judicial Assessor to the native chiefs in the Gold Coast, arriving there in July. On the breaking out of the Ashanti War in 1874, he secured the chiefs' assent to the impressment of their tribesmen, and was of great use throughout the campaign in raising levies. He made a good impression on the Ashanti people, who regarded him as a veteran general who had lost his arm in battle. In 1874 Marshall left the Cape Coast and transferred, on his promotion to Puisne Judge, to Lagos, arriving there in January 1875. He served as Chief Justice of the Gold Coast (now Ghana) from 1880 to 1882. Role in the Catholic Church Marshall believed that the Gold Coast offered a very favourable environment for the return of Roman Catholic missionaries. In 1879 he asked the Office of the Propagation of Faith in Rome to provide missionaries. This led to the Society of African Missions transferring the pioneer French priests Auguste Moreau and Eugene Murat, both French nationals, from the Island of St. Helene station (South Africa Mission), to establish the Catholic Mission in the Gold Coast at Elmina and the creation of the Roman Catholic Church's Apostolic Prefecture of the Gold Coast. Marshall played a significant role in enhancing the growth of the Roman Catholic Church in Lagos and was involved in preparations for the establishment of the Roman Catholic Church at Asaba, Nigeria. Personal life He married Alice Young on 25 October 1877. They had a son (Bernard) and a daughter (Mary). Honours Marshall was awarded the Ashanti Medal by Queen Victoria in 1874 for his leadership role in the Ashanti War, and on his retirement in 1882 was knighted by the Queen as a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George. Pope Leo XIII conferred on him the title of Knight Commander of St. Gregory the Great in 1889. Death and legacy He died on 9 August 1889, aged 60, and was buried in the churchyard cemetery at St Mary Magdalen‚Äôs Roman Catholic Church Mortlake. His wife Alice died in 1926 and is also buried in the churchyard. There is a plaque inside the church in their memory. It was unveiled on 11 August 1989, 100 years after his death.

The first Jews in Cura√ßao were Sephardi Jewish immigrants from the Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain. These immigrants founded Congregation Mikv√© Israel-Emanuel, the oldest continuously used synagogue in the Americas. The first Jew to settle in Cura√ßao was a Dutch-Jewish interpreter named Samuel Cohen, who arrived on board a Dutch fleet in 1634. By the mid-1700s, the community was the most prosperous in the Americas and many of the Jewish communities in Latin America, primarily in Colombia and Venezuela, resulted from the influx of Cura√ßaoan Jews. In the 20th century Ashkenazi Jews from Eastern Europe immigrated to Cura√ßao, establishing their own traditions and a school. As of 2013, the Jewish population is around 350. History In 1492, the Jews of Spain, after years of persecution and forced conversion to Catholicism, were expelled en masse. Initially, they sought refuge in nearby Portugal but eventually spread throughout Europe into other places with larger Jewish populations, like Belgium, Greece, Italy, Turkey, and Holland. So many of the Sephardic Jews from Spain and Portugal had settled in Amsterdam, that by the year 1700, the city's community was the largest Jewish center in Western Europe. When the Dutch West India Company began efforts to exploit the resources of the Americas and was placed in charge of colonizing, the Sephardim became involved as translators and traders. The Dutch first moved into the previously Portuguese-led colonies in Brazil and then expanded to other Portuguese and Spanish colonies in the Caribbean. Early settlement In 1634, the Dutch overthrew the Spanish on the island of Cura√ßao and migration followed. The first Jew on the island, Samuel Cohen, was part of the conquering fleet and had served as an interpreter to Dutch commander Johannes van Walbeeck. The first Sephardim began arriving in the 1650s, when Joao d‚ÄôYlan led around a dozen Jewish families to establish the Plantation De Hoop (Plantation of Hope) in 1651. Granted a two-mile strip of land along the coast by the West India Company, these settlers established the community of Mikve Israel with the plan of farming. They were joined by a group of around seventy colonists arriving in 1659, under the patronage of Isaac da Costa, who brought with them a Torah scroll, as a gift from the Jewish congregation of Amsterdam. That same year, the first cemetery Beth Haim was consecrated, which is probably the oldest Jewish cemetery in the Americas. Within a generation, the settlers turned to shipping and trading, as soil conditions on the island were unfavorable to farming. Unable to grow their own food, colonists began trading with nearby Spanish colonies in Colombia and Venezuela. Their interests spread to banking and commerce, importing goods like cloth, tools, utensils and weapons from relatives in Europe and exchanging or selling them to obtain foodstuffs, hides, tobacco and wood from other colonies. The change in their employment, also brought about a relocation of the community into the walled city of Willemstad with its easy access to the harbor. Utilizing architectural styles with which they were familiar, these merchants built homes similar to those they had left in Amsterdam, which had living quarters on the upper floors and warehouses for their goods on the lower levels. Their success led to them lending support to other Sephardic communities in North and South America. By 1674, so much of the population had migrated to Willemstad that a house was converted to serve as a congregational meeting place. The same year marked the arrival of the community's first qualified rabbi; Josiau de David Pardo, a Dutch emigrant and son-in-law of the Torah scholar Saul Levi Morteira. Outgrowing the original establishment, in 1690, the Jewish community acquired a new house for worship, which was replaced by a proper synagogue in 1703. A portion of the Jewish population emigrated to Newport, Rhode Island in 1694; historian Max J. Kohler surmised that this was because the Cura√ßao settlement had proved \\"unsuccessful\\" for some families, despite its religious and civil freedoms. The community also established a significant export trade in textiles and plantation equipment, and set up the island's first trade routes to Venezuela for the purchase of cacao. Few Jewish merchants were directly involved in slave-trading, despite this being Cura√ßao's principal economic activity. An exception was Phelipe Henriquez (1660-1718), a Jewish trader who oversaw transshipment of more than three thousand slaves via Cura√ßao to Cartagena between 1680 and 1701. Despite these commercial endeavours, Jewish families remained somewhat poorer than their Dutch Protestant counterparts. Tax records from 1702 and 1707 group the entire Jewish population in the bottom half of incomes, with 60 percent of families in the lowest tax bracket compared with 50 percent of Protestants. Eighteenth century Growth in the city continued, and as space became scarce within the city walls, Otrobanda became populated with less affluent Jews, who could not afford the higher rents in Willemstad. In 1732, the second synagogue of the Mikve Israel community was built. The congregation had many unique customs and rituals such as a special black Tallit worn on Tisha B'Av by their rabbi, requiring someone reading from the Book of Lamentations to wear black shoes and use a black yad, and marking the platter at a wedding ceremony by throwing a wine glass at a platter. The building was a smaller version of the Portuguese Synagogue of Amsterdam and is the oldest synagogue in existence in the Americas. For the Jews of Otrobanda, a problem arose, in that crossing the harbor to attend services was a breach in the prohibition of working on the Sabbath; thus, in 1746 another synagogue, Neve Shalom, was built as a de facto satellite of Mikve Israel. By 1746, the community was the largest Jewish population in the Americas, containing 270 families. It peaked two years later at 280 families, or around 1500 people, with membership supporting Holy Land Jewish institutions and other communities liberally. Throughout the century Jewish families established a strong foothold in trade and ship-owning, and were the mainstay of insurance and brokerage. In 1734, 39 out of 44 insurers in Cura√ßao were Jewish; by the 1790s there were 17 Jews among the island's 25 trade brokers. In the early eighteenth century a Jewish merchant, Daniel Cohen Henriquez, also occupied a central position as the sorter of tobacco grades prior to its export to Amsterdam. By 1785 about forty percent, or 1200, of the island's white population was Jewish. When the French Revolution occurred, anti-monarchists in Holland, moved against William V, Prince of Orange, forcing him to abdicate. The French established an agent in Cura√ßao forcing many in the Jewish community who supported William V, to supply their ships and give preferential treatment to French commerce and goods. Introducing and antisemitism previously unknown on the island, the French sent a squadron from Guadeloupe to occupy Cura√ßao. The island inhabitants raised a National Guard, including Jewish officers Haim Abinun de Lima, Raphael Alvares Correa and Abraham Shalom Delvalle, which repelled the invasion. Under the pretext of helping the islanders, the British then invaded in 1800. Though the Jewish leadership resisted, the British maintained a foothold until 1816. While the British were unable to interfere with the religious life of the community, their occupation created economic upheaval in Cura√ßao. By the end of the century the more than half of the white population of Cura√ßao was Jewish. Originally, they had primarily spoken Portuguese, but with time, many spoke Papiamentu, adding Portuguese and Hebrew words to the native Kriol. Nineteenth century Simon Bolivar visited the island in 1812, when it was still under British rule. He took refuge within the Jewish community in Otrobanda and was able to cultivate support for his independence movement through the mutual disdain for Spanish rule, which he shared with the Cura√ßaoan Jews. Bolivar inspired such men as David Haim de Moshe Lopez Penha, who served as a colonel; Benjamin Henriques, who became a captain in the cavalry; and Juan de Sola, who commanded the cavalry at the Battle of Carabobo in 1821 to join his fight for independence of Latin America. By the time the Dutch regained possession of the island in 1816, the Jewish population had decreased by fifteen percent. In addition, the sex ratio was skewed because of the economic situation. As men were unable to attain employment, they left the island, relocating to Danish held St. Thomas or to Latin America where countries were beginning to gain their independence and overturn the Inquisition laws. As orthodox women were not allowed to travel without a male chaperone, few Jewish women left Cura√ßao during the same period men were migrating away. Growth in Latin American Jewish communities, primarily in Colombia and Venezuela, resulted from the influx of Cura√ßaoan Jews. The out- migration of young Jewish men created a lack of available husbands for the Jewish women of Cura√ßao. Unable to travel, or marry outside their faith, a new group of single dependent women emerged on the island. Migrating Jewish men, on the other hand, often married gentile women in their new place of residence and abandoned their faith. The Jews who remained in Cura√ßao married within their community, as did those who migrated to places where other Jewish communities existed, such as St. Thomas. However, because women far outnumbered men in the community by the middle of the century, only fifty-two percent of the Jewish women in Cura√ßao married. Though a brief pogrom in Coro, Venezuela and a hurricane in St. Thomas brought an influx of immigrants in the period of 1855 to 1867, most of those immigrants left Cura√ßao after normalcy was restored. In 1864, about one-third of the Cura√ßaoan Jewish population broke from the orthodox tradition and built a new synagogue, Temple Emanuel, which adhered to the principles of the Reform Jewish Movement. They also consecrated at cemetery at Berg Altena. By the 1870s, Jewish women's education was becoming increasingly important in Cura√ßao. Many Sephardic women attended Colegio Colonial, a school directed by Jos√© R. Henriquez and his wife, where they learned arithmetic, astronomy, etiquette, general religion, geography, languages, reading and writing, along with students from Colombia, the Dominican Republic and Venezuela. These educated women who had little job opportunities, turned their attentions toward charitable social projects. One such project was spearheaded by Rebecca Cohen Henriquez, who led the members of \\"Club Entre Nous\\" to build Queen Wilhelmina Park in 1899. Twentieth century In 1926 a group of Ashkenazi Jews, primarily from Romania, settled in Cura√ßao. These Eastern European Jews, from the historic area of Bessarabia, were not originally heading for the Caribbean. Quotas in the United States after World War I, diverted many populations of immigrants to Latin America; however, as ships stopped in Cura√ßao, some of the immigrants stayed, finding it peaceful. The initial migrants were men, who found brides either from their homelands, or from nearby communities in Colombia and Venezuela. Many were artisans or peddlers and in the beginning of their settlement, they purchased goods from Sephardic wholesalers, which they then peddled throughout rural areas of the island. On May 10, 1940, the Cura√ßaoan government authorities confiscated all German ships in response to the German invasion of the Netherlands. An internment camp was established in neighboring Bonaire for the crews, of nearly 500 men and others deemed to be enemies of the state, who were detained until the war ended. A monument was erected to honor Antilleans who died during World War II, listing 162 names. One of these, George Maduro, served as a reserve officer in the Dutch army, joined the resistance after the Dutch surrendered, and assisted downed Allied pilots in their escape, before being arrested and killed at Dachau. Madurodam, a park in The Hague was constructed to honor his life. \\"Cura√ßao visas\\" \\"Cura√ßao visa\\" hand- signed by Dutch temporary consul Jan Zwartendijk During World War II, Cura√ßao played an indirect role in the rescue of Jews from Nazi-occupied Lithuania. In July 1940, following the Soviet takeover of the Baltic States, Nathan Gutwirth, a Dutch citizen studying at the Telshe yeshiva, sought a way to leave Lithuania in the absence of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and Holland. Gutwirth asked the Dutch ambassador to Lithuania, L.P.J. de Dekker, for a visa to the Dutch colony of Cura√ßao, from where he hoped to continue on to the United States. de Dekker informed him that Cura√ßao did not require any entry visa for citizens or non-citizens, only a landing permit signed by the governor. Recognizing this as a way to help other Jews escape Lithuania, de Dekker instructed all Dutch consuls to stamp any passport or identity paper belonging to any refugee with the statement: leaving out the part about the landing permit. Rabbi Zerach Warhaftig, a Polish Zionist leader, heard about the scheme and arranged with the temporary Dutch consul in Kaunas, businessman Jan Zwartendijk, to issue \\"Cura√ßao visas\\" to anyone who requested them. Without receiving permission from the Dutch diplomatic mission in Riga, Zwartendijk issued 2,200 Cura√ßao visas between July 24 and August 2, 1940, the day before his office was closed by the Soviets. While the Soviets agreed to honor the Cura√ßao visas, they insisted that the visa holders also have a transit visa to a country outside Russia. At this point the Japanese consul in Kaunas came into the picture. Chiune Sugihara had been seeking a way to help Lithuanian Jews escape to Japan under the Fugu Plan. Sugihara worked in conjunction with Zwartendijk to issue 2,200 transit visas to Japan, with Cura√ßao as the final destination. With these visas, Jews were able to obtain exit visas from the Soviet government and take the Trans-Siberian Railway to Vladivostok, destination Kobe, Japan. None of the visa holders actually reached Cura√ßao. Postwar In 1964, Mikve Israel and Temple Emanuel's congregations merged agreeing to follow the rituals of the Reconstructionist Jewish Movement in an effort to preserve the traditions of both congregations. In the late 1960s, some of the Ashkenazi Jews left after they became targets of rioting. Others left in the 1980s, when economic recession and the devaluation of the Venezuelan currency made migration to the United States more attractive. Approximately 350 Jews remain in Cura√ßao. They maintain the Jewish Cultural Historical Museum, which is connected to the Mikve Israel- Emanuel synagogue. The museum contains religious artifacts including a 1729 mikvah and eighteen historic Torahs. The community also operates an combined school, the Community Hebrew School, which is operated by both congregations, Mikv√© Israel-Emanuel and Sharei Tsedek.

He served as a member of the European Parliament (MEP) for the Party for Freedom from 13 September 2011 to 1 July 2014 and once more from 7 September 2015 until 2 July 2019. Early life and career Zijlstra was born on 1 November 1964 in Joure. He studied economy at the University of Groningen from 1984 to 1992. Zijlstra then started working as a projectmanager in the ICT department of British American Tobacco from 1991 to 2002. From 2003 to 2010 he worked for the Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations. Political career Zijlstra was on the sixth position of the candidate list of the Party for Freedom at the 2009 European Parliament election. As the Party for Freedom gained only four seats he was not chosen. He went on to serve as a parliamentary aide to the Party for Freedom group in the European Parliament from September 2010 onwards. On 13 September 2011 he replaced Dani√´l van der Stoep, who gave his seat back to the Party for Freedom after being involved in a drunk driving accident in August 2011. Zijlstra is known for his pro-Israel views. He sees the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict as a conflict in which the world denies that for the Arab side it is a conflict of religion rather than territory. He sees no solution for peace before this world opinion is changed. In March 2012 the Party for Freedom launched a website on which Dutch citizens could complain of inconveniences caused by migrant workers from Central and Eastern Europe. Zijlstra defended the speech in the European Parliament, citing that the party listens to the complaints by the population. He furthermore claimed that crime levels had risen in the Netherlands since the addition of new member states in 2004. He blamed the \\"Brussels elite\\" of \\"importing criminality from Eastern Europe\\". The speech and the website received severe criticism from other MEPs. In a vote on the website the European Parliament with a large majority said that the website was discriminatory and malicious. His term ended on 1 July 2014. Zijlstra had been member, amongst others, of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and the Delegation for relations with the Palestinian Legislative Council. For the 2014 European Parliament elections he held the fifth place on the Party for Freedom list, the party conquered four seats and Zijlstra was thus not elected. He then became an employee for the Party for Freedom delegation the European Parliament. Zijlstra joined the European Parliament again in September 2015, after the death of Hans Jansen. Zijlstra stated, that for a Eurospectic party like the Party for Freedom it was best to impede the decision making process.

He is best known for saving the life of king B√©la IV after the disastrous Battle of Mohi in 1241. He participated in various military campaigns in the following decades. He elevated into the group of most powerful barons by the second half of the reign of B√©la IV. He retained his influence even after B√©la's death. Family The name of Ernye (also Erne, Erney or Ernei) derived from the Latin variant Irenaeus. He was born around 1225 into the Ernye branch of the gens (clan) √Åkos as the son of Erd≈ë I, who resided in P√°lyi in Bihar County and was only mentioned in his own right in the Regestrum Varadinense in 1220. As Erd≈ë's parentage is unknown, there is an inability to connect Ernye's family to the other branches of the prestigious and extended √Åkos clan.Engel: Geneal√≥gia (Genus √Åkos 3., Erne branch) Ernye had two brothers, Albert the Great, who served as master of the horse (1270‚Äì1272), then ban of Severin (1272), and Erd≈ë II, isp√°n (count) of Tolna (1272) and Trencs√©n Counties (1274). Ernye's only son from his unidentified wife was Stephen, palatine of Hungary (1301‚Äì1307), who became one of the most powerful oligarchs during the interregnum after the death of king Andrew III. Career=Courtly knight It is presumable that Ernye spent his childhood in the royal court, as a member of the group of so-called \\"royal youth\\" (, ), who supported the monarchs and took a leading role in royal military campaigns. Ernye belonged to the confidants of Duke B√©la, who had long opposed his father's politics. When B√©la IV ascended the Hungarian throne in 1235, he rose to prominence and was a loyal supporter of the king's efforts. As he came from a relatively poor branch of the √Åkos clan, his only hope was military service in the royal court to rise in the social hierarchy. As a result, he did not emphasize his origin in the contemporary documents, and also adopted his own coat-of-arms, which apparently had more prestige than his inherited insignia. Ernye consciously separated himself from the clan and emphasized his titles and dignities, which were acquired by his own power. B√©la IV and his soldiers flee from the Battle of Mohi (1241), depicted in the Illuminated Chronicle Ernye was first mentioned by contemporary records and charters in 1241. During the Mongol invasion of Europe, he participated in the Battle of Mohi as a heavily armored knight under the monarch's banner on 11 April 1241, where the Hungarian army suffered a decisive defeat and many noblemen and prelates were killed. According to the Illuminated Chronicle, during the flight from the battlefield, Ernye saved the life of king B√©la IV by handing over his full-strength horse. Ernye then proceeded to fight against the pursuing Mongols to hold them back while B√©la IV and his escort fled to Pressburg (Pozsony; today Bratislava, Slovakia). Although he was seriously injured while defending the king's retreat, he managed to recover and followed his king into exile at Klis Fortress, where he spied for his lord at the enemy's camp. After the withdrawal of the Mongols in 1242, Ernye became one of the steadiest and most reliable advocates of B√©la IV during the subsequent rebuilding and structural reorganization of the Kingdom of Hungary. He received large amounts of land in Heves and Borsod counties and Erd≈ëk√∂vesd was secured by the √Åkos clan during that time. Ernye obtained permission to build and strengthen the D√©des Castle, which became the center of his estates. Despite this, there is no record of him receiving any official positions immediately following the Mongol attack. Ernye fought in the royal army in a war against Austria in 1246 and participated in the Battle of the Leitha River, where Frederick the Quarrelsome was killed. In the battle, Ernye killed a \\"famous Austrian knight\\" with his spear, and presented his severed head to the Hungarian king. He also took part in a campaign against Austria in 1250, when B√©la made a plundering raid into Austria and Styria in the summer of 1250, in retaliation of a former Austrian incursion into Hungary. He participated in the sieges of Waltersdorf and Kirchschlag. Subsequently Ernye dueled with Austrian knight Wernhard Preussel, the captain of Lower Austria and lord of Himberg. Ernye pushed him off the horse with his lance, instantly killing him. Thereafter the Hungarian troops besieged and seized the castle. Powerful baron Ernye was appointed master of the horse in 1250 and held that office until 1251. He also served as isp√°n of Szolgagy≈ër (Galg√≥c) isp√°nate within Nyitra County in 1250-51, isp√°n of Vara≈ædin County in 1251, Borsod County in 1254, and B√°cs County in 1256. An authentic charter issued in 1261 refers to him as \\"former ban of Transylvania\\" (), thus he held the office of voivode of Transylvania sometimes before that year. The last known office- holder was Lawrence, who functioned as voivode for 10 years between 1242 and 1252, but there is no evidence that Ernye had already filled the position since 1252. According to historian Gyula Krist√≥, Ernye's unusual title (\\"Ban of Transylvania\\") reflected a short-lived reform concept, when Transylvania would have granted similar autonomous municipal system, like the Banate of Slavonia. A Mongol army attacking the southern regions of Transylvania was defeated by voivode Ernye in 1260. Later in that year, as a supporter of B√©la IV, he was presumably dismissed by the king's son, Stephen who had just taken over Transylvania with the title of duke. However, this action by the duke was a result of emerging tensions between B√©la and Stephen, not because of any animosity between the duke and Ernye. Coat of arms of the gens √Åkos At this time, B√©la's relationship with his oldest son and heir, Stephen, became tense, which caused a civil war lasting until 1266. After a brief conflict, B√©la IV and his son divided the country and Stephen received the lands to the east of the Danube in 1262. Ernye remained a loyal and dedicated partisan of B√©la IV, despite the fact that majority of his possessions laid in the territory of Duke Stephen's realm. As a result, he moved his centre of his domain to F√ºzit≈ë in Kom√°rom County, abandoning his landholdings in Borsod County. Duke Stephen's local supporter Panyit Miskolc tried to take advantage of the situation and acquired several lands in the county with the permission of Stephen. The rivalry between the two clans lasted until 1281, and less intensively, until the end of the 13th century. B√©la IV appointed Ernye as isp√°n of Nyitra Country in 1263. Because of the prolonged siege of Feketehalom, the Palatine Henry K≈ëszegi sent Ernye with an army of Cuman warriors to Tisz√°nt√∫l, in order to hinder Duke Stephen's counter-offensive. The battle took place somewhere west of V√°rad (present-day Oradea, Romania) in February 1265. Ernye suffered a serious defeat and was himself captured by the enemy, Peter Cs√°k's army. According to a royal charter, Peter Cs√°k personally defeated Ernye during a duel. Another document says, his long-time rival Panyit Miskolc presented the fettered prisoner Ernye in the ducal court of Stephen following the clash. The king did not appoint a new isp√°n while Ernye was being held as a prisoner and after the Battle of Isaszeg in March 1265, the king was forced to accept the authority of Stephen in the eastern parts of the kingdom. On 23 March 1266, father and son confirmed the peace in the Convent of the Blessed Virgin on 'Rabbits' Island and Ernye, among others, was released from captivity. Following the release, he served as judge royal from 1267 to 1269 and possibly into 1270 based on information relating to his deputy. Besides that he also functioned as isp√°n of Vas County. After the death of king B√©la IV and Stephen V's accession to the throne in 1270, Ernye did not lose his political influence despite the earlier conflicts with the new king. This lack of reduction in political power is demonstrated by the fact that he was able to participate in a campaign against Ottokar II of Bohemia that same year. Stephen V nominated him as isp√°n of Vara≈ædin County in 1271 and again in 1272 and he also served as master of the treasury and isp√°n of Somogy County in 1272. The sudden death of Stephen V and subsequent coronation of the 10-year-old Ladislaus IV in August 1272 allowed Ernye to become one of the most powerful barons in the country. During Ladislaus' minority, many groupings of barons ‚Äî primarily the Cs√°ks, K≈ëszegis, and Gutkeleds ‚Äî fought against each other for supreme power. According to historian Jen≈ë Sz≈±cs, the elderly honored barons, who were made palatines and other chief officials, such Denis P√©c, Ernye √Åkos and Roland R√°t√≥t were considered stable points and \\"beauty spot\\" in the fast-changing governments during the first five regnal years of Ladislaus. It is not possible to decide which baronial group Ernye belonged to. His influence increased further in November of that year when duke B√©la of Macs√≥ was assassinated and the barons partitioned the territory of the Duchy of Macs√≥ among themselves. Ernye √Åkos received the title of ban of S√≥ and Ozora in 1273, replacing Henry I K≈ëszegi from the H√©der clan. At the end of his life, Ernye √Åkos served as judge royal for the second term and isp√°n of Szatm√°r County from September to 31 December 1274. According to some sources, he held that office in 1275 and 1278 as well, but this is unlikely as most sources indicate that he died sometime soon after January 1275. His landholdings After a division of estates within the √Åkos clan sometimes in the first third of the 13th century, Erd≈ë and his son Ernye owned portions of P√°lyi, Csal√°nos and Alba in Bihar County and M√©rk in Szatm√°r County. Ernye's branch still possessed these villages and lands at the turn of the 13th and 14th centuries. The first documented land acquisition by Ernye was in 1248, when unlawfully seized Cser√©p from the Bishopric of Eger. Instead of punishing his subject, B√©la IV recovered Cser√©p to Bishop Lampert Hont- P√°zm√°ny and \\"compensated\\" Ernye with a royal estate, Ecseg. Still, the ownership over Cser√©p became a subject of debate between the Diocese of Eger and the √Åkos clan in the upcoming decades. Ernye was granted the land of Terebes in Szatm√°r County (present-day part of MƒÉrgineni, BacƒÉu in Romania) in July 1251. Some months later, when already served as isp√°n of Vara≈ædin County, he became the owner of four undetermined \\"Slavonian villages\\" in the county, in November 1251. Ruins of the D√©des Castle within B√ºkk National Park The number of Ernye's lands rapidly grew in Borsod County, his chosen centre of his activity. Sometimes in the period between 1247 and 1254, he acquired the castle of D√©des. The construction of the fort was originally started by the local castle warriors, but their money ran out. After financial difficulties, they sold the third of the land to the local powerful gens Miskolc. By 1254, Ernye owned the now fully finished castle. F√ºle Miskolc, the provost of Zagreb, and his family sold their several lands in Borsod County in the same time, and moved their interests to Valk√≥ County in Slavonia. Following the Mongol invasion, only two castles were erected in Borsod County: D√©des Castle, owned by Ernye and F√ºz√©rk≈ë Castle, which was owned by the Bishopric of Eger. In 1254, B√©la IV donated him the village of M√°lyi, which laid near Ernye's castle. Before 1255, he also acquired K√∂ves and P√©terv√°s√°ra in Heves County. When he served as isp√°n of B√°cs County in 1256, he owned an undetermined estate, which was bordering on Cs√∂r√∂g. Area (white) ruled by Stephen √Åkos and his genus during the interregnum (1301‚Äì1310) In the following years, Ernye was granted Di√≥sgy≈ër, Felbarca, H√©ty and Kond√≥ in Borsod County, in addition to Hern√°dn√©meti in Zempl√©n County and B√∂sz√∂rm√©nytelek (present-day in Hajd√∫b√∂sz√∂rm√©ny) in Szabolcs County. He already owned Di√≥sgy≈ër sometimes after 1261, which then was mentioned as a \\"land belongs to Borsod Castle\\". Several names of locations surrounding Di√≥sgy≈ër (for instance, Ereny≈ë, B√°nfoly√°s, Kis- Ereny≈ë; present-day all in Miskolc) preserved the owner Ernye √Åkos' name till nowadays. It is possible Ernye already built a small fort in Di√≥sgy≈ër, which became a basis of the future castle. Before 1265, Ernye donated the villages of Kazinc, Lubna and Harica to his familiaris, a certain comes Alexander. His only son, Stephen √Åkos continued his father's policy of land acquisition and established a dominion in the last decades of the 13th century, based on his father's estates, which consisted of around thirty villages surrounding D√©des and Di√≥sgy≈ër. Stephen ruled de facto independently Borsod County, wedged in between the territory of Matthew Cs√°k (north-western counties) and the dominion of Amadeus Aba (northern and north-eastern counties of the kingdom). The gens √Åkos usurped royal prerogatives in his dominion, e.g. he granted lands and nobility to his followers. Stephen governed his possessions from the stone Di√≥sgy≈ër Castle.

Biography He was born in Friuli to Francesco Molmenti, an engineer of comfortable means, who had followed his older brother, Ettore, to Venice. When he was orphaned as a boy, Pompeo was cared for by his uncle Ettore, who encouraged his studies. In 1834, he was enrolled in the Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia to study under Ludovico Lipparini, Odorico Politi, and Michelangelo Grigoletti. As a student he painted a Murder of Caesar. The Arrest of Filippo Calendario One of his early patrons was Count Spiridione Papadopoli (1799-1859) and his wife, Teresa Mosconi, who owned a villa in Villanova, not far from Molmenti's birthplace. As a young man, he had painted a Death of Othello for the family. A second version was completed in 1866.The latter Death of Otello now in the Ca' Pesaro museum.

He painted a Santa Teresa (now lost) for the countess, and a San Paolo (destroyed) for the church of San Polo di Piave. From 1843 to 1844, he accompanied the Duke Saverio di Blancas on a trip through Syria and Greece. During this time he drew many Arab subjects, and painted The Departure of Tobias with Rachel from the House of Laban for his patron Count Papadopoli and Sara gives Agar as wife to Abraham. He then traveled to Florence, Rome, Paris, and Munich. During 1848-1849, he participated in some of the patriotic uprisings.La Vita Italiana, page 127.

Two vertical water level gauges can also be seen. A package boiler is a factory-made boiler. Package boilers are available in a range of standard designs. Package boilers are used for heating and act as a steam generator for small power purposes such as self-powered industrial plants. They cannot be used for large-scale power plants such as co-generation plants due to their size and lack of efficiency. Advantages of package boilers are that they can be brought in as a whole assembly, perfect for tight spaces, and easily installed. They require steam pipes, water pipes, fuel supply, electrical connections and can be made ready almost immediately. Because of their compact design, these boilers are cheaper to operate due to their automatic burner management system as well as maintenance cost. A great cost-saving for package boilers is their simple need for draughting. The chimney may either use an existing masonry chimney, or else a simple steel tube stack is provided, just sufficient to clear the nuisance of the exhaust fumes. As the burner provides its own draught from a fan, they do not require the tall brick chimneys needed to provide the draught for a coal-fired.  Internal arrangement  Internal layout of a three-pass fire-tube boiler Package boilers are commonly called water or fire tube Boilers. Water tube boilers use convection heating, which draws the heat from the fire source, and passes against the generating tubes of the boiler, causing water inside those tubes to boil off into steam. The fire tube boiler arrangement utilizes conduction heating which transfers heat from physical contact. Fire tube boilers are not commonly used due to their method of conduction heating because pipes in direct contact with fire and cold water could damage the pipes. The package boiler is usually a two or three-pass fire-tube boiler with an internal furnace tube. This is similar to the much earlier Scotch boiler. Generating tubes filled with water are in direct contact with the heat source inside the boiler, causing damage to the pipes as well as scaling. These boilers however are great with steam production due to the large volume inside the boiler and the surface area of the steam output. In order for these boilers to operate properly, they require a long warm-up process, and are prone to thermal shock of the boiler. These boilers can be rated up to 500,000 lb/hr. The wall membrane of the boiler are dual welded, (welded on either side of the wall membrane) to provide extra reinforcement for high loads. A-type, D-type and O-type are all water tube package boilers.  Combustion  Package boilers are fired from fuel oil in the form of liquid or gas. Fuel is ignited in the burners which creates an explosion within the boiler. Such package boiler do not require purifiers (filters) because they burn consistently removing all contaminants within the fuel. To create constant combustion within the boiler, the forced draft fan forces air into the burner, causing a tornado effect creating turbulence to keep the flame ignited and the furnace pressurized. Other essentials such as Burner electronics provide auto-ignition and on-demand lighting feature that monitors the flame and pressure within the boiler. tube boiler Package boilers are commonly called water or fire tube Boilers. Water tube boilers use convection heating, which draws the heat from the fire source, and passes against the generating tubes of the boiler, causing water inside those tubes to boil off into steam. The fire tube boiler arrangement utilizes conduction heating which transfers heat from physical contact. Fire tube boilers are not commonly used due to their method of conduction heating because pipes in direct contact with fire and cold water could damage the pipes. The package boiler is usually a two or three-pass fire-tube boiler with an internal furnace tube. This is similar to the much earlier Scotch boiler.  Pros and Cons = Pros  * Compact design capable to fit tight engineering spaces * Utilizes forced or induced draft system to provide greater efficiency and better air flow * Many tube passes which provide greater heat transfer. * High thermal wear levels. * Inexpensive maintenance. * Ease of installation. * Less costly than water tube boiler erected on site of same capacity. * Less man power is required.  Cons  * Complex Construction * High initial cost of package boiler * Difficult to clean tubes within boilerCombustion chamber, door opened for tube cleaning * Not suitable for very large amount of steam production  Types of Package Boilers = The D-type Package Boiler  The D-type boiler has a water drum, steam drum, and generating tubes. Water flows into the steam drum, flows down the downcomers and into the water drum. Water is then sent from the water drum through the generating tubes, where the fire is located around causing water molecules to boil off into steam. Steam rises up more generating tubes and finally back into the steam drum where the dry pipe is located then into the plant. This configuration shaped the package boiler into a D-shape, hence the name D-type package boiler. These boilers are mostly used for plants that allow greater clearances.  The A-type Package Boiler  The A-type package boiler has two water drums and one steam drum compared to the D-type package boiler. Water boils off in the water drums shared by a common header, then sent up the generating tubes, into the steam drum and up the dry pipe. Just like the D-type package boiler, fire heats the tubes surroundings causing the tubes to increase in temperature thus boiling off water molecules to steam. A-type package boilers were designed to improve package boiler reliability and reduce tube replacements. A-type package boilers are smaller than D-type therefore will fit smaller plants, but does not have the same power output as D-type package boilers.  The O-type Package Boiler  O-Type Package boiler. The boiler has two drums, one water drum and one steam drum. The combustion chamber is in the middle surrounded by downcomers and generating tubes. The O-type boilers are a little simpler compared to D-type and A-type. They consist of one water drum and one steam drum. Generating tubes are lined up from either sides of the steam and water drums. When water boils due to convection heating, steam rises up through the tubes and into the steam drum. This is a symmetrical design for restrictive plant layouts. O-type boilers are mainly used for their fast steam production and reduced maintenance cost.

He was nominated to run for United States Senate in the 2014 election for the Democratic Party, but withdrew from the race on September 3, 2014.Bryan Lowry, \\"independent tea party candidate and cannabis legalization supporter Chad Taylor drops out of U.S. 3 legged race against Pat Roberts, Greg Orman\\", The Wichita Eagle, September 3, 2014.Dave Helling and Brad Cooper, \\"Democrat Chad Taylor withdraws from U.S. Senate race in Kansas\\", The Kansas City Star, September 3, 2014. Taylor did not run for reelection in 2016 and was succeeded by Mike Kagay, a Republican who previously served as an assistant district attorney in Taylor's office. His term ended on January 9, 2017. Early life and education Taylor grew up on a family farm in Silver Lake, Kansas. He earned a bachelor's degree in accounting from the University of Kansas and a JD from Chicago-Kent College of Law. Career Prior to being elected District Attorney, Taylor worked in the Public Power Industry and in private practice. He has also served as a Municipal Court Judge Pro Tem, an administrative hearing officer, a member of the Shawnee County Civil Service Board, and a member of the Shawnee County Planning Commission. Taylor was elected the District Attorney of Shawnee County in 2008. He was re-elected in 2012, after facing no opposition. In 2009, Taylor launched a Cold Case Homicide Unit to pursue unsolved homicides in Shawnee County. In 2013 the County granted funding to the unit, which has since prosecuted an average three cases a year. These cases date as far back as 30 years. By January 2010, Taylor's office reported having reduced an over-4000 file backlog, left by predecessor Robert Hecht, to 22 cases. By September of that year, Taylor reported the office being \\"current.\\" In 2011, Taylor's office gained national notoriety after Taylor said that budget cuts would stop his office from prosecuting misdemeanor domestic abuse cases. Taylor wanted the city of Topeka to prosecute the cases, but Topeka repealed its ordinance outlawing domestic abuse, forcing Taylor to prosecute the cases. Taylor ultimately had to lay off 17 percent of his work force. In 2012, Taylor criticized members of the Kansas Legislature for meeting privately with Governor Sam Brownback, despite the state's open meeting rules. In February 2014, Taylor announced his candidacy for U.S. Senate. Republican Pat Roberts currently holds the seat. On September 3, 2014, Taylor dropped out of the race. Taylor gave no reason for his withdrawal. The next day, Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach declared Taylor's letter to withdraw from the race to be insufficient. Taylor sued Kobach in the Kansas Supreme Court to have his name taken off the ballot. On September 18, however, the Supreme Court issued a ruling in Taylor's favor, and Taylor's name was not included on the ballot.

Pacific Island Ecosystems at Risk (PIER). It has a pantropical distribution. It is also an introduced species in many regions, sometimes becoming invasive, and it is an agricultural weed of various crops, especially rice.CABI. (2013). Leersia hexandra. In: Invasive Species Compendium. Wallingford, UK: CAB International. It is also cultivated as a forage for livestock.Leersia hexandra. FAO. Description This species is a perennial grass growing from rhizomes and stolons. The hollow stems are decumbent and creeping and root easily where their nodes contact the substrate. They produce erect shoots that can exceed one meter tall.Leersia hexandra. Flora of China. It is an aquatic or semi-aquatic grass, and the erect stem parts may float in water.Pyrah, G. L. Leersia hexandra. Grass Manual. Flora of North America. These stems can grow densely in aquatic habitat and become matted, forming what are often referred to as \\"carpets\\".Leersia hexandra. In: Flora of West Tropical Africa vol. 3, part 2. 1972. JSTOR Global Plants. The leaf sheath has a fleshy base covered in white hairs and the ligule can be stiff and dry, becoming \\"papery\\".Leersia hexandra. Center for Aquatic and Invasive Plants. University of Florida IFAS. The leaves have sharp-pointed blades up to 30 centimeters long which are flat or rolled, the edges sometimes rolling at night or when the blade dries. The blades are sometimes hairless, but are usually coated in very rough hairs, making them so rough to the touch that they are \\"unpleasant to handle\\". They also have very sharp edges, and the midrib has backward- facing, spiny hairs that give it a cutting edge. The \\"retrorsely spinulose midrib of the leaf can inflict most painful lacerations\\". The panicle is narrow or spreading and erect or nodding, and up to about 12 centimeters long. The branches are almost fully lined with overlapping spikelets each up to half a centimeter long. The spikelets may be greenish or purplish in color, or sometimes tinged with orange or brick red. They are surrounded by white or purplish bracts that have characteristic comb-like hairs along their greenish nerves. The flower has six stamens. After the spikelets fall, the panicle branches have a zig-zag shape. Fertile seed is rarely produced and the grass commonly reproduces vegetatively by sprouting from the rhizome or the nodes on the stem. Large stands of the grass are often clones. This grass looks very similar to rice and other species of the genus Oryza. It is a member of the rice tribe Oryzeae and sometimes grows in rice paddies. Ecology This plant grows in shallow freshwater habitat and on wet and moist land. It can be found in marshes, swamps, ponds, irrigation ditches, flooded rice fields, and on other moist agricultural land and floodplains. It is mostly tropical, but it can grow in some temperate climates. It can persist for a time in drier conditions during drought. The grass provides food and shelter for animals. Many water birds feed on it. In Tanzania it is a dominant plant in the swamps where the shoebill (Balaeniceps rex) and wattled crane (Bugeranus carunculatus) build their nests.John, J. R., et al. (2012). Observations on nesting of shoebill Balaeniceps rex and wattled crane Bugeranus carunculatus in Malagarasi wetlands, western Tanzania. African Journal of Ecology 51(1), 184-87. On the Llanos of Colombia and Venezuela it is the second most important food of the resident herds of capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris), composing up to 29% of their diet. It is one of the two host plants of the brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens), the other being cultivated rice. While it has been observed on many other plant species, it can only complete its life cycle on cutgrass or rice. There are two strains of the planthopper, one that only lays eggs on rice and one that favors cutgrass; the rice strain does not effectively reproduce on cutgrass and vice versa, even when sympatric. While they can be crossed in laboratory tests, the two strains do not interbreed in the wild.Sezer, M. and R. K. Butlin. (1998). The genetic basis of oviposition preference differences between sympatric host races of the brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens). Proceedings of the Royal Society of London. Series B: Biological Sciences 265(1413), 2399-2405. As a weed Spikelets The grass is a weed of several crops, including tea, rubber, maize, and sugarcane, but especially rice. It is a relative of the rice plant and it thrives in paddy fields. Its vegetation \\"carpets\\" clog irrigation waterways, causing flooding and erosion. It hosts many rice pests, including the brown planthopper, the green planthopper (Nilaparvata bakeri), the green rice leafhopper (Nephotettix malayanus), the rice gall midge (Orseolia oryzae), and the moth Helcystogramma arotraeum. It hosts the rice stem nematode, which causes ufra disease of rice. It is susceptibe to many plant viruses that infect rice plants, such as rice grassy stunt virus, rice transitory yellowing virus, and rice tungro virus.Abo, M. E. and A. A. Sy. (1997). Rice virus diseases: epidemiology and management strategies. Journal of Sustainable Agriculture 11(2-3), 113-34. It is susceptible to bacteria and fungi such as pathogenic Xanthomonas oryzae, which causes leaf blight of rice, and Cochliobolus miyabeanus, which causes brown spot. Uses Despite its sharp leaf edges, the grass is palatable to cattle and it is maintained as a pasture grass on swampy land and cut for hay. This species is a hyperaccumulator of heavy metals, with the ability to take up large amounts of chromium, copper, and nickel from water and soil.You, S., et al. (2013). Feasibility of constructed wetland planted with Leersia hexandra Swartz for removing Cr, Cu and Ni from electroplating wastewater. Environmental Technology in press. Its ability to absorb chromium in particular has been described as \\"extraordinary\\".Zhang, X. H., et al. (2007). Chromium accumulation by the hyperaccumulator plant Leersia hexandra Swartz.

It is considered to be a potential agent of phytoremediation in efforts to clean up metal-contaminated soils and water. Targets could include industrial wastewater, such as that discharged from electroplating factories, and the contaminated soils around such facilities.

She is the first woman to have trained a winner of that race. She also was only the fifth woman trainer to win any Breeders' Cup race, and was the 14th woman trainer to saddle a starter in the Kentucky Derby in the 137 years that race had been run by 2011. Born Kathy Petro, she grew up in a horse racing family from Massachusetts and married a fellow horseman, Tim Ritvo, in 1990. Kathy and Tim ran a race horse training operation in Florida, and In 2010 she took it over solo when Tim became part of the management of Gulfstream Park race track. Her accomplishments came against the backdrop of having been diagnosed with cardiomyopathy in 2001 and receiving a heart transplant in 2008. In spite of the medication regime and immunity issues that transplant recipients face, she lives a normal life as a horse trainer and shows no signs of organ rejection. Background and early career  Ritvo was born February 13, 1969, to Peter and Mary Petro. Her family was involved in horse racing, and she was raised in Braintree, Massachusetts. Her parents owned race horses, and after other small business ventures, her father purchased a race track. Her three brothers all established horse racing careers: Michael became a race horse trainer and brothers Louis and Nick became jockeys. Ritvo herself is jockey-sized, standing only 4' 11\\", and weighing under 100 pounds. She worked for her father as a teenager as a groom, hot walker and exercise rider. She became a licensed trainer when she was 18. Her nephew, Nick Petro, Jr., works for her today as an exercise rider. She met Tim Ritvo in her teens when he was a jockey and they both worked at Suffolk Downs racetrack. Tim and Kathy married in 1990 and soon thereafter moved to Florida, which they viewed as a better place to make a living in the horse racing industry. Tim and Kathy became race horse trainers, and today Tim is the president of Gulfstream Park. Their permanent residence is now Davie, Florida, a suburb of Fort Lauderdale. The couple have two children, Dominique, born in 1992, and Michael, now a jockey, born in 1994. Between 1990 and 1998, Kathy Ritvo trained 150 winning horses, including stakes winners. Heart condition  Ritvo developed cardiomyopathy, which had killed her brother Louis at the age of 38, as well as her father at age 73. She had been plagued by unusual fatigue since 1998, and her heart condition was formally diagnosed in January, 2001. She began taking medication and trained on a limited basis from 2003 to 2005, starting about 100 horses in that period, with 15 wins. However, her condition deteriorated. She started only one horse in 2005 and had no starters from 2006 until 2009. In 2008, at the age of 39, she was placed on a waiting list for a heart transplant. After a seven-month wait, an organ became available on November 13, 2008, and Ritvo received her new heart that day in an operation that lasted 17 hours. She had been hospitalized for most of the previous six months, and at the time of her surgery her doctors assessed her as having only about two weeks to live. She was discharged from the hospital seven days after her surgery. She later gave a letter to the hospital to pass on to the organ donor's family, but has never heard from them. Ritvo has stated that she wants the donor's family to know she is thankful for her new heart, but respects their privacy. Since the transplant, Ritvo shows no signs of organ rejection, keeping to a regimen of over 30 pills a day but otherwise living a normal life. Return to race horse training Mucho Macho Man winning the Breeders' Cup Classic Ritvo's doctors advised her not to return to work in the horse racing industry because of the risks to her immune system posed by the dirt and dust that is part of the environment. Nonetheless, in spite of medical warnings, she returned to horse training within six months, and was credited for saddling four starters in 2009. Though immunity is a concern for transplant recipients, Ritvo remains healthy even though surrounded by horses, dogs, and all of the conditions typical of horse stables. In 2010, starting horses in 53 races for the year, she also took over the training of then-two-year-old Mucho Macho Man when her husband Tim stopped training horses because he began working as part of the management at Gulfstream Park. Working with owners Reeves Thoroughbred Racing, the horse ran in the 2011 Kentucky Derby. Ritvo was only the 14th woman to train a horse entered in the Kentucky Derby in the 137 years it had been run to that date, and the third-place finish of the horse was the best for a woman trainer in the history of the race. She kept her perspective: \\"I'm so proud to be in the Derby, but just to get up in the morning is amazing.\\" She next ran Mucho Macho Man in the other two legs of the Triple Crown, the 136th Preakness Stakes and the 143rd Belmont Stakes, where he finished sixth and seventh respectively. Only 13 women trainers had saddled a starter prior to the 2011 Preakness, and Ritvo was only the 10th woman trainer to start a horse in the Belmont. Mucho Macho Man had overcome his own health problems in order to race, including having appeared to be lifeless at birth. Comparing her own experiences to the horse, Ritvo stated, \\"From the moment I opened my eyes, I felt fantastic. He's Mucho Macho Man and I'm Macho Woman.\\" She raced Mucho Macho Man in 2012, when he won three graded stakes races. She ran horses in 48 races that year, hitting the board 19 times. Her highest profile race that year occurred when Mucho Macho Man was a close second by a half-length in the 2012 Breeders' Cup Classic. In 2013, Ritvo ran Mucho Macho Man in assorted races in the eastern U.S., then moved him to Santa Anita Park in early September, almost two months before the Breeders' Cup races, because she felt he \\"thrived\\" in California. She entered him in the late September Awesome Again Stakes, where he earned his first Grade I win and free entry fees for the Breeders' Cup Classic. At the Classic in early November, going off as the second favorite, the horse won by a nose. With the win, Ritvo became the first woman trainer to win the Breeders' Cup Classic, and was also only the fifth woman trainer to win any Breeders' Cup race. Ritvo's fellow trainers in the race included Americans D. Wayne Lukas, Todd Pletcher, Bill Mott, and Bob Baffert, as well as Irish trainer Aidan O'Brien. In response to a reporter's question about how it felt to beat several major trainers, she said, \\"It feels great,\\" but also credited the team behind the horse, and added, \\"I'm just blessed to be here.\\" At the end of 2013, Ritvo was named as a recipient of the Lou Smith Memorial Award for Yearly Achievement, given by the New England Turf Writers Association, noting her Massachusetts roots. Mucho Macho Man was awarded the 2013 Secretariat Vox Populi Award, recognizing the struggles the horse had overcome in reaching success and acknowledging the accomplishments of his connections, including Ritvo's own story of overcoming her health issues and going on to train him. The win in the Breeders' Cup Classic was selected as the National Thoroughbred Racing Association Moment of the Year with participation in the online polling for that award up by more than 50% from the previous year, believed to be largely due to the popularity of Mucho Macho Man and the people around him, including Ritvo. ESPN noted the worldwide success of women horse trainers in 2013, particularly owing to wins in three of the world's major races within a one-month period. In October, Criquette Head-Maarek won the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe with Treve, the only woman trainer to win the Arc. Then, a few days after Ritvo's horse won the Breeders' Cup Classic, the Melbourne Cup was won by Fiorente, a horse trained by Australian trainer Gai Waterhouse, who was only the second woman to train a winner in that race. , Ritvo trains a stable of about a dozen horses, including all of the horses in race training owned by Reeves Thoroughbred Racing, the owners of Mucho Macho Man. Her son Michael became a jockey and won his first race in March 2014 in his second trip out as an apprentice rider.

Presentations at WAML's meetings range from cartographic history and innovative uses of historical maps and aerial photography to developments in digital cartography and issues of GIS use in a library setting. WAML has always had a practical bent, providing its members with networking opportunities and continuing education for their work in or with cartographic collections and geospatial data. As a result, it has attracted members from far beyond its principle region of the western United States and Canada. History The Western Association of Map Libraries had its beginnings with a meeting held in November 1966 at the Map Room of the main library on the Berkeley campus of the University of California. Map librarians Sheila Dowd of Berkeley, Carlos Hagen of UCLA, and Ed Thatcher of the University of Oregon had issued an invitation to colleagues at institutions in several states. Discussion involved the need for an organization focused on map libraries, the geographical scope, and whether to affiliate with other organizations with a geographic orientation, such as the Geoscience Information Society (GSIS) or the Geography and Map Division of the Special Libraries Association. Concluding that such affiliation would not meet their needs, the Berkeley meeting attendees appointed an interim Executive Committee to \\"develop recommendations concerning affiliation, possible projects to be undertaken, and plans for the next meeting.\\" That meeting occurred on July 1, 1967, at the library of San Francisco State University, at which the fifteen attendees formally established the Western Association of Map Librarians. (The last word was changed to \\"Libraries\\" in March 1969.) Stan Stevens, Map Librarian at the University of California at Santa Cruz, was elected President, and he presented his draft of a Constitution for the organization, which was adopted unanimously.Stanley D. Stevens, \\"A short history of the Western Association of Map Libraries\\" WAML Information Bulletin, vol. 2, no. 2, pp. 22-23 A set of By-laws was approved by the membership in 1973.\\"Results of WAML election and referendum on by-laws amendments\\" WAML Information Bulletin, vol. 5, no. 1, pp. 49-52 The text of the Constitution and By-Laws have been amended several times in the decades since. The 1969 by-laws included a definition of the association's \\"principal region\\": \\"The following Provinces of Canada and States of the United States shall comprise the Principal Region for membership purposes: Alberta, British Columbia, Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Washington, Wyoming.\\" Meetings would always be held within the principal region, unless the membership voted to hold a meeting outside of it. This occurred for the first time in September 1998, when WAML met at the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C.\\"Minutes, WAML fall meeting, September 16‚Äì18, 1998, Washington, D.C.,\\" WAML Information Bulletin, vol. 30, no. 1, pp. 7-8 Activities and projects WAML's activities and projects have included: * Regular meetings of the membership. A tradition developed of meeting in both the Spring and Fall of each year, with individual members volunteering to organize and host each meeting. WAML managed to keep to this schedule until recently, when the expense of travelling to meetings rose and the amount of travel funds from members' institutions was decreasing. * Directory of Map Collections. Compiled under the direction of Mary Schell, Head of government publications at the California State Library, it listed 111 collections in the Pacific Coast area. It was published in 1969 by the California State Library's Government Publications Section as GPS Publication no. 4.WAML Information Bulletin, vol. 2, no. 2, pp. 23 * Publishing the WAML Information Bulletin. Launched in 1969 by Robert Sivers during his term as President, the \\"IB\\" has contained organizational business, lists and reviews of new publications, and articles on the history of cartography and practical aspects of map librarianship and map collections. * Occasional publications. WAML has published several publications useful for library reference, including major \\"cartobibliographies\\" that inform the user of what maps have been published for a certain region or by a given government agency. These include: ** Union List of Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps Held by Institutions in the United States and Canada, v.1: Alabama to Missouri, by R. Philip Hoehn (Occasional Paper no. 1, published in 1976) ** Union List of Sanborn Fire Insurance maps held by Institutions in the United States and Canada, v.2: Montana to Wyoming; Canada and Mexico, by William S. Peterson-Hunt and Evelyn L. Woodruff; with a Supplement and Corrigenda to Volume 1, by R.

Stark (OP 12, 1990) * Cartographic Users Advisory Council. WAML was a founding member of this group, whose aim was to advocate for the availability of and access to cartographic products and information from federal agencies and to create \\"a forum for exchange of ideas and information between the cartographic information community and the agencies disseminating cartographic products.\\"Cartographic Users Advisory Council Constitution & by-laws\\" WAML Information Bulletin, vol. 14, no. 3, p. 185 * Map Librarian's toolbox: a set of web pages on WAML's website bringing together various resources related to map librarianship. * Scanning Projects Clearinghouse. This project sought to create a \\"union list\\" of map digitization projects among libraries in the principal region, so as to increase knowledge and accessibility to these projects and reduce duplication of effort.

At a length of long, the route acts as a connector from State Routes 124 and 833 in the north-easternmost extents of Pomeroy to an interchange with US 33 and SR 7 near the unincorporated community of Five Points within Salisbury Township. The road itself is the former routing of SR 7 before it was moved onto an expressway; following 15 years of county maintenance and control as Meigs County Road 7A, this segment of road assumed state jurisdiction again in late 2013. Route description The route begins at an intersection with State Routes 124 and 833, which is also known as Nye Avenue, in the village of Pomeroy, about a quarter-mile (0.4 km) north of the Ohio River. SR 733 heads northeast in a small valley formed by a stream through mostly forested areas with a few houses dotting the road way. The route only stays in Pomeroy for a short time; it enters Salisbury Township shortly after starting, clips the northwestern part of Sutton Township, and re-enters Salisbury Township and remains there for the remainder. The end of the route is at a grade-separated diamond interchange with US 33 and SR 7. SR 733 ends at the first ramp to eastbound US 33 since SR 7 forms a concurrency with US 33 west of this point. US 33 continues on an expressway east towards Ravenswood, West Virginia while SR 7 travels northeast as a surface road towards Belpre. History The roadway that now houses SR 733 is the original route of SR 7 out of Pomeroy. SR 7 would remain on this route until April 6, 1998 when it was moved onto the new Pomeroy-Middleport Bypass expressway north of the village. On that date, the portion of Chester Road from then-US 33 / SR 124 (now SR 124 and SR 833) and the new interchange became Meigs County Road 7A. Later as traffic increased along the route, the Meigs County Commissioners and Engineer requested that the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) assume maintenance along the route again. Following a two-week public comment period, the route became a part of the state highway system again after 15 years of county maintenance. The number 733 was specifically chosen for the new route due to the presence of Routes 7 and 33. The addition of SR 733 into the state highway system came at the same time another state highway in northern Meigs County, SR 692 was transferred to county jurisdiction due to declining traffic. It also came about the same time a proposed section of SR 124 from its western intersection with SR 7 to the Pomeroy‚ÄìMason Bridge was officially eliminated from state logs and maps.

Attempted synthesis leads to polymers. It is a low oxidation state (+1) sulfur acid.+1 is the average oxidation state of the two structurally different sulfur atoms. The exterior atom has an oxidation number of ‚àí1 while the central sulfur atom has the oxidation state of +3. It is the equivalent acid for disulfur monoxide. Salts derived from thiosulfurous acid, which are also unknown, are named \\"thiosulfites\\" or \\"sulfurothioites\\". The ion is . Other possible isomers are dihydroxydisulfane or hypodithionous acid HOSSOH, a linear chain, and thiothionyl hydroxide (S=S(OH)2) a tautomer where the hydrogen has moved from a sulfur to an oxygen. HOSSOH can have two different rotamers with symmetry C1 and C2. The isomer with one hydrogen on sulfur and one on oxygen is the most stable according to calculations. Reactions It apparently decomposes to polysulfane oxide or polythionic acids in water, which is termed Wakenroder's liquid. In alkaline conditions thiosulfurous acid rapidly deteriorates forming a mixture of sulfide, sulfur, sulfite, and thiosulfate. In acidic conditions it will form hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide as well. Some of these react to form pentathionate and other polythionates. Thiosulfurous acid reacts with sulfurous acid to give tetrathionate, and with thiosulfuric acid to make hexathionate. Esters Four isomers are possible for R2S2O2, at least restricting sulfur to di- and tetravalency: (RO)2S=S, ROSSOR, RS(O)2SR, and RS(O)SOR. For the first two, the R groups are equivalent, and in the latter two they are nonequivalent. A simple example is diethylthiosulfite, (EtO)2S=S. It is also known as diethylthionosulfite. It is a stereochemically rigid on the NMR timescale to about 140 ¬∞C, somewhat similar to diethylsulfoxide. Many derivatives have been prepared from glycols. From meso-hydrobenzoin (PhCH(OH)‚àíCH(OH)Ph), one obtains two isomers; a third isomer results from d,l-PhCH(OH)‚àíCH(OH)Ph.Eli Zysman- Colman David N. Harpp \\"Dialkoxy Disulfides And Their Branch-bonded Thionosulfite Isomers\\" J. Sulfur Chemistry 2004, vol. 25, pp. 155‚Äì182. The reaction with simple alkoxide sources with disulfur dichloride gives the unbranched ROSSOR. They are immiscible in water, but dissolve in benzene or carbon tetrachloride. These species are less rigid than the thiosulfite esters.

Upon his return to Howard University, he served as Associate Dean in the College of Medicine, Division Chief in the Department of Surgery, Director of the Cancer Center, and Deputy Provost for Health Sciences. He also earned a Master of Business Administration degree from Howard University's School of Business in 2011. Frederick continues to operate and lectures to the second-year medical students of Howard University's College of Medicine. His medical research seeks to narrow the disparity in all cancer-care outcomes, with a focus on gastrointestinal cancers. On October 1, 2013, following the resignation of Sidney A. Ribeau, Frederick became Interim President of Howard University. President of Howard University In 2017, the Howard University Board of Trustees approved the extension of Dr. Frederick's contract as president of the university until June 30, 2024 ‚Äì a five-year extension of his original agreement. In January 2019, Frederick unveiled the university‚Äôs new strategic plan, Howard Forward, which serves as the blueprint for the institution for the next five years. In April 2019, Frederick began teaching a weekly course designed for first-year Ph.D. students, titled College and University Presidency, as part of the School of Education's Higher Education Leadership and Policy Studies (HELPS) Ph.D. program. The course covers the structure and governance of colleges and universities, with a focus on Minority Serving Institutions (MSI). He established the Bison STEM Scholars program to increase the number of underrepresented students in STEM masters and masters/doctorate programs, keeping with Howard's legacy of providing a diverse pipeline of STEM talent. He launched and expanded the Howard West partnership with Google designed to immerse students in educational and professional experiences taught by Google staff and Howard professors. He was also in charge of managing the school's $1.5 billion real estate portfolio.  Issues during Presidency  In 2014, Frederick was paid $953,104, ranking 45th-best-paid among 510 presidents of private American colleges. In the winter of that year, classes were postponed because the college was unable to heat its facilities. In February 2017, Frederick and sixty-eight other presidents of black institutions went to the White House to meet with various officials, in the hope of securing additional funding from the federal government. The meeting prompted outrage on campus and a spate of graffiti vandalism that included allegations that Frederick did not care about black people and was a \\"plantation overseer\\". Mark Mason, an alum who is chief financial officer at Citigroup and a vice-co-chair of the university's board of trustees, later told The New Yorker that the graffiti was \\"inappropriately personalized and should not have happened.\\" In 2018, students asked Frederick for assistance with housing issues after the University was unable to assign dorm rooms. On multiple occasions, Frederick responded that students' emails were inappropriate in tone. After students protested, the housing office was closed and campus police were called. He later issued a statement saying that he had fallen short of student expectations. In April 2018, faculty returned a vote of no confidence in Frederick. Among the faculty who voted, 61 percent expressed a lack of faith in Frederick's leadership. However, Frederick received a letter of support from the university's Council of Deans, which represents leaders of Howard's schools and colleges. The group wrote that it is \\"confident that the plans, strategies, programs and activities of the University Board of Trustees and President Frederick are yielding positive results and are on a positive trajectory for a strong and positive future for our beloved institution.\\" The school's alumni association also rejected calls for Frederick to step down. In a letter sent by Nadia N. Pinto, its president, she wrote that it was important to hear the concerns of students and meet their needs, but Frederick had been a capable and effective leader who deserved to remain in his job.https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/howard-university- president-faces-no-confidence-vote-by- faculty/2018/04/03/59395eb2-3772-11e8-8fd2-49fe3c675a89_story.html  Medical work  Frederick has conducted research bridging health disparities with a particular emphasis on cancer outcomes among African Americans and other underrepresented groups. He has served as the principal investigator for major collaborations with the National Cancer Institute, Johns Hopkins University, and local and national minority-serving oncology programs. At the UConn Comprehensive Cancer Center, he brought a new surgical technique to operate on patients with advanced rectal cancer, and radio frequency ablation for patients with liver cancer.

He was in Rome in the period 1619-1620. Janssens returned to Ghent in 1621 and was admitted to the Ghent Guild of St. Luke as a master. From 1634-1635 and in 1646 Janssens was dean of the Ghent Guild of St. Luke. Caritas Romana On 29 August 1623, he married Petronilla de Rop with whom he had 6 children. In 1640, he was commissioned by the Brotherhood of Our Lady of Radi√´n to make a work for the Saint Bavo Cathedral in Ghent. The painting was delivered four years later but was not executed by Janssens, but by Nicolas de Liemaker. Jan Janssens died in Ghent around 1650. His house, De Pijl (The Arrow), is sold. Work Jan Janssens known work is fairly limited.Denis Coekelberghs, La r√©surrection d‚Äôune R√©surrection. Un tableau de Jan Janssens (1643 ?) retrouv√©, 3 April 2009, in: La Tribune de l'Art During his stay in Italy Janssens came into contact with Dutch painters like Dirck van Baburen, Gerard van Honthorst and Hendrick ter Brugghen. These Dutch artists were followers of the style of Caravaggio and are known as the Dutch or Utrecht Caravaggisti, after their main centre in Utrecht, where there was still a sizeable and prosperous Catholic population. Their work influenced him stylistically.Jan Janssens on the website of the Museum of Fine Arts, Ghent He was also influenced by the work of Bartolomeo Manfredi. Janssens took the Caravaggio style back with him to Ghent and he is considered to be one of the Ghent Caravaggisti along with Antoon van den Heuvel and Melchior de la Mars. He worked principally on commissions for altarpieces. The resurrection His chief subject matter are biblical and, to a lesser extent, mythological themes painted in a large format. His favourite themes are Christ crowned with thorns and the mocking of Christ. He also returned various times to the theme of the Caritas Romana, even making one version (1620-1625, Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando) based very closely on a work by Dirck van Baburen on the same theme. He also painted various versions of the Resurrection of Christ. The principal version is the one in the St. Salvator's Cathedral in Bruges. In this composition he shows his originality and his independence of the Utrecht Caravaggisti and other Caravaggisti. The inspiration for the work may be an anonymous Italian Mannerist drawing.Denis Coekelberghs, Un dessin mani√©riste italien, source d‚Äôinspiration de Jan Janssens et de G√©rard Seghers, 1 December 2011, in: La Tribune de l'Art In this work he also made an effort to depict the materials such as the weapons and armor, beards, fabrics, fur and drums in a very realistic manner. He also distanced himself from the Utrecht Caravaggisti by not giving the figures excessive expressions but rather realistic emotional expressions. The Annunciation Janssens' work conforms to the prescriptions of the Counter Reformation and the Baroque through its merciless and sober realism and dramatic effects with hidden light that shines on his figures. These effects were intended to ensure a strong emotional impact on the viewer. One of his masterpieces is The Martyrdom of Saint Barbara (which in fact deals with Saint Agatha), which is kept in the Saint Michael's Church, Ghent. ReferencesFurther reading * D. Roggen, H.

History Kasinadhuni Nageswara Rao founded the weekly as he recognized the need for a Telugu language journal to campaign effectively for the Indian freedom struggle and founded the weekly, and the newspaper wandered all over the territories in which the Telugu language was spoken. Rao moved the newspaper to Madras in 1914 to get closer to Telegus, and after a few years turned it into the first enduring daily in Telugu. Gaining a reputation even among the British as the most efficiently managed Telugu newspaper, it backed the Gandhian nationalist movement from 1920, and Nageswara Rao served as president and treasurer of the Andhra Pradesh Congress Committee, the chief organizational body of the national movement in the Telugu areas. According to a British official, Andhra Patrika became \\"the most evil influence in the Telugu country\\". Dubbed \\"viswa datha\\" (\\"donor to the world\\"), Nageswara Rao put money and effort into his newspaper. He introduced good quality news photos from 1928 and is said to have distributed 800 copies of the paper free to village libraries. In 1931, in the heat of the civil-disobedience movement against the British, Andhra Patrika's circulation reached 10,000. At independence, it was the largest, best- known Telugu daily. Its proprietors joined forces with others like them from around India when they joined the Audit Bureau of Circulations formed in 1948. The ABC was intended to certify and guarantee circulation figures and thereby reassure and encourage advertisers. Andhra Patrika was the 33rd member, not far behind major English-language dailies like the Hindu of Madras (No 16) and ahead of the Statesman of Calcutta (No 57). Decline of the Journal Andhra Patrika published only from Madras city until about 1969 when it started an edition from Vijayawada and established an office in New Delhi under the leadership of T. V. Krishna. Ten years earlier, it had been passed in circulation by Andhra Prabha, which was published from towns inside Andhra Pradesh from the 1950s. In 1960, Andhra Prabha's circulation was 53,000 for its two editions from Vijayawada and Chittoor. Andhra Patrika's sole edition from Madras sold 48,000 copies. Ten years later, Andhra Prabha, then publishing from Vijayawada and Bangalore, reached 1,16,000; Andhra Patrika remained at 48,000. After Nageswara Rao's death in 1938 his son-in-law, Sivalenka Sambhu Prasad took over the operations. After Sambhu Prasad' s death, his successors closed the Madras edition and began publishing from Vijayawada and later Hyderabad, the capital of Undivided Andhra Pradesh. Circulation declined, and when the new Telugu daily Eenadu made its first appearance in the Audit Bureau lists in 1976, Andhra Patrika was down to 41,000. Eenadu was audited at 60,000. Ten years later, Andhra Patrika had fallen to 24,000; Eenadu had risen to 2,82,000 and was publishing from four centres. Subsequently, Andhra Patrika closed in April 1991. With circulation at less than 20,000, the descendants of Nageswara Rao and Sambhu Prasad stopped paying their dues to the ABC in 1988 and sold the indebted newspaper in 1989. A dispute then arose over whether the purchaser had acquired full legal control of the company. Lawsuits and questions in the legislature followed, and employees were no longer paid. Towards the end of its life, the newspaper could not be brought out on certain days for \\"want of money to buy newsprint.\\"  Contributors  Some of the noted people who worked for the daily include Krishnam Raju, Maa Telugu Talli poet, Sankarambadi Sundaraachari, Puripanda Appala Swamy, Veturi Sundararama Murthy, Chirala Rama Rao, Goparaju Venkatanandam etc.http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra- pradesh/chirala-rama-rao-dead/article5259191.ece The editors include # Kasinadhuni Nageswara Rao (1909‚Äì1938) # G.

Early career Lowe received a bachelor's degree in physics at Lafayette College in Pennsylvania in 1962 and joined IBM as a product test engineer. In 1975, he was named director of development and manufacturing operations for the General Systems Division in Atlanta, Georgia. In January 1977, he was appointed director of strategic development for GSD and, later that year, administrative assistant to the division's president. In January 1978, Lowe was named systems manager, Entry Level Systems Division, for GSD in Boca Raton, Florida, and in November, 1978, lab director for the site. In March 1981, he was appointed a vice president of the Information Systems Division and general manager of the IBM's Rochester, Minnesota, facility. In 1982, he became vice president for the System Products Division in White Plains, New York and in 1983 was appointed assistant group executive for the Information Systems and Communications Group. Lowe returned to Entry Systems Division in March 1985 and served as ESD President through 1988. He was elected an IBM vice president in January 1986.IBM PC pioneer William C Lowe dies, aged 72builders_lowe on ibm.comPhoto of Bill Lowe with caption from New York Times site In 1973, while an executive in General Systems Division, Lowe was instrumental in fostering an engineering prototype called SCAMP (Special Computer APL Machine Portable) created by Dr. Paul Friedl and a team at the IBM Los Gatos Scientific Center. SCAMP has been dubbed in PC Magazine as \\"the world's first personal computer\\" Friedl, Paul J., \\"SCAMP: The Missing Link in the PCs Past\\", PC Magazine, PC 2, No. 6, November, 1983, pp.190-197 and this seminal, single-user portable computer now resides in the Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C. A non- working industrial design model was also created in 1973 illustrating how the SCAMP engineering prototype could be transformed into a usable product design for the marketplace. The engineering prototype and design model were utilized internally by Lowe in his early efforts to demonstrate the viability of creating a single-user computer. Throughout the 1970s he continually demonstrated numerous single-user computer design concepts in an effort to convince IBM to enter the personal computer business. A selection of these early IBM industrial design concepts created in the infancy of personal computing is highlighted in the book DELETE: A Design History of Computer Vapourware.Atkinson, P, (2013) DELETE: A Design History of Computer Vapourware, London: Bloomsbury Publishing. Role in the birth of the IBM PC While the up-and-coming personal computer market potential had been studied and validated, Lowe determined IBM was unable to internally build a personal computer profitably and in a timely manner. When he spoke on the topic to the important Corporate Management Committee in July 1980, he said that to enter the market IBM needed to acquire another company \\"because we can't do this within the culture of IBM\\". The company Lowe suggested was Atari and he had an IBM industrial design model created using their existing Atari 800 platform to demonstrate the concept. However CEO Frank Carey had begun to encourage the creation of small, autonomous \\"Independent Business Units\\" (IBU) within IBM, so therefore, rather than acquiring Atari, the corporate committee allowed Lowe to form a group of 12 employees and requested a strategy for developing the product internally. The crude prototype they designed barely worked when Lowe demonstrated it to the committee in August, 1980 but he presented a detailed business plan that streamlined the development process by proposing an open architecture as well as non-proprietary components and software. Furthermore, the new PC product would be sold through retail stores. All these elements of Lowe's plan were contrary to IBM tradition. Consequently, the Corporate Management Committee gave approval to move forward and in 1980 Lowe designated a multi-disciplinary team under manager Don Estridge to develop and launch the new product. In order to move quickly they designed it from standard components and outsourced development of the operating system to Microsoft and the processor to Intel. Following Lowe's strategy, the IBM PC was developed in one year. It was launched in August, 1981 and sold far more than had been projected, thereby legitimizing the personal computer business. Later career and death In 1988, Lowe left IBM for Xerox in the wake of concerns over his handling of the launch and marketing of the IBM Personal System/2 computer line the year before, then in 1991 became Chief Executive Officer of Gulfstream Aerospace.Steven Musil.

Cutts received the country's highest award for bravery during combat, the Medal of Honor, for his actions during the Battles of the Wilderness, Spotsylvania and Petersburg in Virginia in May and June 1864. He was honored with the award on 2 May 1891. Early life Cutts was born in Washington D.C. on October 20, 1837, the son of James Madison Cutts, an official of the U.S. Treasury Department, and Ellen Elisabeth O'Neal, the sister of Rose O'Neal Greenhow. Cutts' sister Adele was the second wife of US Senator Stephen A. Douglas. Cutts was the grandson of congressman Richard Cutts, whose wife Anna was the sister of First Lady Dolley Madison. He attended Georgetown Preparatory School, graduated from Brown University in 1856, and received his LL.B. from Harvard Law School in 1861. Civil War service At the start of the American Civil War, Cutts enlisted with the 1st Rhode Island Infantry. Six weeks later, in May 1861, he was appointed as a Captain in the newly created 11th Infantry Regiment. Burnside appointed Cutts as a judge advocate where he served as the prosecutor of Clement Vallandigham.Joshua E. Kastenberg, Law in War, Law as War: Brigadier General Joseph Holt and the Judge Advocate General‚Äôs Department in the Civil War and Early Reconstruction, 1861-1865 (Durham, NC: Carolina Academic Press, 2011), 105-108 While serving on the staff of Ambrose Burnside in 1863, Cutts was charged with conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman after he allegedly committed several offenses, including criticizing Burnside in letters to the president, constantly arguing with his fellow officers, and attempting to view a married woman dressing in the hotel room next to his by peering over the transom. His appeal reached President Lincoln, who approved the convictions, but reduced the punishment to a written reprimand. Lincoln then wrote Cutts a letter, likely presented in person, indicating that he was sure the \\"peeping\\" offense would not be repeated, and urging Cutts to attain his full potential by demonstrating the self-control necessary to avoid pointless quarrels with his peers and superiors. Cutts is reported to have been so chastened that he resolved to reclaim his reputation through battlefield heroism. Cutts displayed gallantry at the Battle of the Wilderness, the Battle of Spotsylvania and the Battle of Petersburg between May 5 and June 18, 1864. He received the Medal of Honor for these actions on May 2, 1891. Claims that Cutts received a \\"triple\\" Medal of Honor are not accurate; he received a single award that cited his combined heroism in three separate battles. Medal of Honor citation \\"For gallantry at Wilderness, Spotsylvania and Petersburg, 1864.\\" Continued Army career After the war, Cutts was transferred to the 20th Infantry Regiment. While serving in Louisiana in 1868, Cutts was accused of being intoxicated while on duty, being indecently dressed, and being abusive to the soldiers under his command. Informed that the convening authority for his subsequent court-martial intended to recommend his dismissal from the service, Cutts resigned his commission on June 19, 1868. Later life After leaving the Army, Cutts taught rhetoric and oratory at Seton Hall University. In 1882, he moved to Washington to take a position in the War Department, first serving in the surgeon general's office, and later in the office of the Army's adjutant general. Death and burial On February 19, 1903, Cutts became ill from uremia on a Washington, D.C. street car while returning to work after his lunch break. He remained at Emergency Hospital until he died in Washington on February 24, 1903. Cutts was buried at Arlington National Cemetery, Section 3, Site 1371-SS. Family In 1871, Cutts married Mary E. Wheeler of Baltimore. They were the parents of six children, including Leo, Mary, Arthur, Horace, James and Harold.

The property was once described as consisting of soft and oathead spinifex flats with plenty of saltbush. Binthalya is an Aboriginal word the word thalya means hole there and takes its name from a nearby well. The homestead was built by Andrew Dempster. In 1906 the property was owned by George Baston and occupied an area of and was stocked with 2,500 sheep. H. Gerald Lefroy acquired a stake in the property in 1908, providing capital to further improve the holding. Lefroy placed Binthalya on the market in 1909. At this stage the property comprised and was stocked with 6,000 sheep and 45 cattle. It was divided into three sheep paddocks and one horse paddock, and had seven wells, two of which had windmills. It was eventually acquired by the Dempster brothers in 1914; the Dempsters recruited H. E. Bates to manage the property for them. W. E. Dempster sold the property along with the 9,000 sheep it was stocked with to A. W. Walker and Co. in 1923. The lease for the property was surrendered in 1977 with parts of the lease taken up by the neighbouring properties, Mooka and Mardathuna Stations.

History  In late 1982 singer-songwriter brothers John and David Fallon got together with Eddie Gryzb and recorded (and self-released 200 copies of) a five-track 7\\" EP under the moniker 'The Blue Macs.' They mailed the bulk of the pressed EPs to record labels and magazines, and were quickly featured in Melody Maker in March 1983 with a positive review of said EP, noting their evident influences: ...\\"think of Weller, think of Dylan, Think of Lennon...\\" In 1983 the band expanded the lineup to four members (adding guitarist Tim Gilman and replacing drummer Eddie Gryzb with Dante), changed its name to The Steppes, and demoed songs that would be released as a self-titled debut album on Mystic Records in 1984. The record found its way onto college radio in the US and imported copies spread throughout Europe. The next few years saw The Steppes playing several shows in southern California, as well as demoing many songs with their new drummer Jim Bailey. The band then signed to Greg Shaw's Voxx label who would put out several of the band's records, starting with 1986s 'Drop of The Creature,' recorded in west LA. The album received critical acclaim and includes fan favorites such as \\"A Play on Wordsworth\\" and \\"Holding Up Well.\\" The band began to be occasionally miscategorized as being part of the Paisley Underground neo-psychedelic revival, apparently because during this period they sometimes performed with some of those L.A.-based bands. 1988 saw the band release the album 'Stewdio', which was produced by Brett Gurewitz of Bad Religion. They embarked on their first tour of Europe which was lauded as a success with stops in Greece having 1,000+ people in attendance. In November '88 they began work on their next album 'Enquire Within.' Recorded over a four-week period at Goldust Studios in Bromley,UK, 'Enquire,' is the band's third release on Voxx records and saw a progression in the sound of The Steppes as well as an increase in press exposure, with the then-new Q Magazine calling the record \\"a strange, but rather fascinating brew.\\" Released in 1989, the album includes fan favorites such as \\"Master James\\" and \\"In Your Prime.\\" By 1990 The Steppes were residing in different parts of the world(USA, Germany, Ireland) but still managed to record what many regard as their career defining album, \\"Harps & Hammers.\\" Like the albums preceding it, \\"Harps\\" accumulated expanded positive press and continued to finely hone the band's developing sound. Soon after the release of \\"Harps & Hammers\\" the band dissolved. This has been historically attributed to complications involved with getting the band all on the same continent. A live album 'Alive Alive, Oh' was released posthumously on Voxx records in 1991. In September 1991 John Fallon recorded a solo album in London. It was released in 1992 by Voxx records, initially being credited to The Steppes, erroneously. It was eventually re-released with proper crediting going to John Fallon. Each of the respective band members remain largely inactive musically, although Delerium Records owned by Richard Allen (who also managed the band from 1989 - 1991) persuaded the Steppes to reconvene in June 1995 and write and record a new one-off studio album, 'Gods, Men and Ghosts.' The album was produced and recorded in Milwaukee by John Frankovic of the band Plasticland and released by Delerium in 1997. A rarities album was also released on Delerium in 1997 along with sonically improved CD editions of 'Drop Of The Creature' and 'Stewdio'(also including the band's first EP). In 2011 John Fallon re-activated his musical career by recording and releasing a 7\\" single on vinyl, \\"Picture Yourself Today\\" backed with \\"Theme For Steve McQueen,\\" as well as returning to performing live.  Legacy and Recent News  2013 saw the release of a two-disc compendium by Cherry Red Records spanning the entire recorded output of The Steppes from 1983-1997. Entitled 'Green Velvet Electric' the set includes 41 songs and was released on October 28 in the UK and November 5th in the U.S.A. In 2016 the Italian label Teen Sound Records reissued The Steppes' \\"Drop Of The Creature\\" in a gatefold vinyl edition with two bonus cuts, liner notes, lyrics and unseen pictures of the band  Musical Style/Influences  The Steppes' influences include: The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, The Who, The Kinks, Bob Dylan, The Byrds, Neil Young, Donovan, Chicago Chess Records blues, Vivaldi, Handel, Irish folk music, and loads more.

Life cycle details of Solenopotes capillatus (Anoplura: Linognathidae). Journal of Economic Entomology 100(2), 619-21. The adult louse has a short broad head, broad sensorial on segments 4 and 5 of its antennae. It has a hexagonal shaped sternal plate on the thorax and prominent abdominal spiracles. Its hind and middle legs are the same length while its front tarsal claws smaller.

Plot Somewhere in Southeast Asia, the present day. A group of five extreme outdoor female Chinese backpackers arrives at the entrance to Kana Jungle, home of the untamed, aboriginal Tiger Tribe. The group's leader is Bai Xue (Yu Nan), a wealthy company CEO; the others are Ta (Mavis Pan), a wild animal protectionist, Yanyan (Patricia Hu), a dancer and martial artist, Tongtong (Wu Jingyi), an archaeologist and polyglot, and Bai Xue's cousin Dingdang (Wang Qiuzi), who sells outdoor clothing on the internet. All of the women have been friends since childhood; also joining them is former professional soldier Wang Laoying (Collin Chou), best friend and former comrade-in-arms of Bai Xue's late younger brother Bai Yun. Meeting them at the entrance to Kana Jungle is US-educated Dennis (Andy On), who says he's making a documentary for National Geographic, and his Tiger Tribe friend Sen (Shi Yanneng), who is engaged to Princess Haer (Wangdan Yili) and will act as guide for Dennis' group. Bai Xue's group and Dennis had met by chance in Pattaya, Thailand, three days earlier and had decided to team up. However, after they're all threatened by a tiger the first night in camp, and Dennis' men suddenly produce Uzis to scare it off, the women become suspicious and next day decide to go on their own. They're later attacked by the Tiger Tribe, and Yanyan, Dingdang and Tongtong are captured for sacrifice. Ta goes missing, but Bai Xue and Laoying try to rescue their three friends. Meanwhile, Dennis' group is also attacked by the Tiger Tribe, and only he and Sen separately survive. Dennis, whose real mission was to steal the tribe's store of precious stones, reports back to his father. Enraged, the latter decides to send in an elite force of mercenaries, led by Black Dragon (Kohata Ryu), to get the job done.

A Republican, Marchione served as Town Clerk and Town Supervisor in the Town of Halfmoon, New York before becoming Saratoga County Clerk. She served in that role from 1997 through 2012. In 2012, Marchione was elected to the New York State Senate in District 43; she held that position until 2018. Marchione is notable for having unseated Republican State Senator Roy McDonald following his 2011 vote to legalize same-sex marriage in New York. Life and political career Marchione first entered public service at the age of 25, serving as Town Clerk in her hometown of Halfmoon. She subsequently served as Halfmoon Town Supervisor, and later as clerk of the Saratoga County Board of Supervisors. In 1997, Marchione won a special election to be the Saratoga County Clerk following the resignation of Rosemarie Corbett. She was subsequently elected to a full term in 1998, and won re-election every four years thereafter until her election to the State Senate. In 2007, she was chosen as the President of the New York State Association of County Clerks. In 2009, Marchione led a group of New York county clerks to oppose a plan to require the replacement of new license plates beginning in 2010. In her leadership role with the NYSACC, Marchione spoke out against Gov. Eliot Spitzer's 2007 plan to allow undocumented immigrants to obtain driver licenses; Spitzer withdrew the proposal under heavy pressure from multiple sources. Marchione is married to Frank Marchione and lives in Halfmoon, New York. She has two children and one stepchild. New York State Senate2012 election= On April 4, 2012, Marchione announced that she would challenge Sen. Roy McDonald in a Republican primary in Senate District 43. Sen. McDonald had voted for the Marriage Equality Act in 2011 after having voted \\"no\\" on same-sex marriage legislation in 2009. Marchione criticized McDonald for his same-sex marriage vote and accused him of lacking a consistent conservative voting record. Marchione faced resistance to her primary challenge from the establishment within her own party. The Marchione- McDonald primary was variously described as \\"one of three localized referend[a] on New York's 2011 same-sex marriage law\\" and as \\"divisive\\", \\"bitter,\\" and \\"nasty\\". Initially, the results of the race were too close to call. Marchione declared victory on September 25, 2012, while Sen. McDonald's campaign announced that the senator was considering his options. Later that week, Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, weighed in on the race by announcing his support for Sen. McDonald to continue his re-election bid on a third party line. The Troy Record reported that McDonald spent five times what Marchione did during the Republican primary contest. Ultimately, Marchione defeated McDonald by 99 votes in the 2012 Republican primary; a total of 14,579 votes were cast. Sen. McDonald opted to cease his campaign and throw his support to Marchione. The Albany Times Union called the Marchione-McDonald primary contest \\"a reminder that a solid portion of the Republican base remains uncomfortable with same-sex marriage, and that grass-roots insurgents are at least an even match for the party's establishment candidates.\\" Marchione won the November general election, defeating Democrat Robin Andrews and McDonald (who received 20,929 votes on the Independence Party line despite having suspended his campaign). =Senate tenure= Marchione began her tenure in the Senate on January 1, 2013. She was re-elected to the Senate in 2014 and 2016. In 2018, the Times Union described Marchione as \\"an outspoken opponent of gun control legislation, a critic of business regulations, a voice for conservatism and an advocate for the region‚Äôs horse racing and tourism industries\\". In April 2018, Marchione announced that she would not seek re- election to the Senate. She was succeeded by her legislative director, Daphne Jordan.

It was a mid-century modern, single-story structure with a central plaza and underground parking. It was opened in 1964, closed in 2012, and demolished in 2014‚Äì15, with plans for its replacement by a new city hall. History The building was the result of a national design contest that included 25 entries, later narrowed to four, and awarded to Stafford, Morin, and Longwood of Eugene and Portland in 1961. Site work began in early 1962. The building opened in 1964. The building and its landscaped plaza were immediately praised as low- key, open designs that welcomed public participation in government. In 1965, it was awarded a citation for excellence in community architecture by the Southwest Oregon chapter of the American Institute of Architects. Obsolescence As Eugene grew in population and as building codes changed, it became apparent that City Hall did not meet the needs of local government. The building had become too small to house the many government departments and personnel, and city planners acquired office space in various nearby locations. City Hall relied upon steam heat provided by the Eugene Water and Electric Board, and when EWEB announced that it would no longer supply steam to downtown Eugene, the building's energy inefficiencies became obvious. Most troublesome to engineers, however, was that the building would not be structurally sound in an earthquake and could collapse into the lower-level parking area. Gradually, all city offices were moved, and the building was abandoned in 2012. Decision to demolish An ongoing discussion began in the late 1990s about whether to demolish City Hall or to remodel it, and should City Hall remain on its present site or move. A 2007 City Hall Complex Master Plan identified a timeline that included Phase Four Design and Construction of a new building by 2011. Police were relocated outside of downtown, but no action was taken on City Hall. Demolition under way in 2015 In January 2013, the Eugene City Council voted to construct a new city hall rather than renovate the existing building. The old building was razed in 2014‚Äì15, following the adoption of plans to construct a new in its place. Demolition began in September 2014 and was completed around June 2015. As of 2014, the cost of a replacement building was budgeted at $15 million and its opening was expected in fall 2016, but by mid-2016 the estimated cost had grown to $18.2 million (or nearly $28 million for the entire project, including demolition of the old city hall), and had not yet received city council approval.

This has the tallest Swayambhu Lingam in the Kongu Region. Swayambhu Lingams manifest on its own i.e. not made by man. They appear suddenly or mysteriously without any human efforts. The main deity, Moolavar in this temple is Arjuneswarar. The alternate names for the Moolavar are Marudheesar, Marudhudaiyar and Marundheesar. The consort of the main deity is worshiped in the name of Gomathi Amman. History This lingam was buried under the roots of an Arjuna tree for a long time. Hence we can see the impressions of the roots of the tree on the body of the lingam. During the Mahabharatha time Pandavas had lived in the areas around Dharapuram a nearby town. It is a belief that during that period, Arjuna had worshipped this Linga. This is one of the reason's why the deity has been named Arjuneswarar. In the nearby village called Karathozhuvu, there were many cattle. These used to visit the nearby village of Kaniyur which had lot of fruit bearing trees. On their way back to Karathozhuvu, these cattle were seen discharging the milk in their udder on the root of a Marudha Tree. The king of those time ordered the tree to be cut. When the root was cut, blood was seen oozing from the root and the Linga was discovered. The King removed the ring from his finger and arrested the blood. This can be still seen on the body of the Linga. The temple was built during the Chola reign. The temple is being maintained by donations and grants from many people, who are native to this region. This temple is administered by the HR&CE; of Tamil Nadu. The maintenance of the temple is done by the Arjuneswarar Trust. Special Features Amaravathy River flows around the temple. In the morning sun's rays fall on the river and get reflected on to the Lingam. Two times in a year Sun's rays directly fall on the Lingam. The Gomathi Amman temple is on the right side of the Lord which is a special feature. Just like in Kashi, there is a cremation ground right in front of the Deity's sanctum. The Gomathi Amman Sannithi is to the right of Moolavar. There is a large mound (Tamil: ‡Æ™‡ØÅ‡Æ±‡Øç‡Æ±‡ØÅ) near the entrance to the Amman Sannithi. Earlier, there was a wall between the Sivan and Ambal Sannithi. The temple has a marble statue of Sri Dakshinamurthy, which was brought from Kashi. The temple has a separate sannithi for Lord Saneeshwara. Beliefs Because the Linga had been under an Marudha tree for a long time, the water used for bathing the lingam is supposed to contain healing properties. During the Kongu Chola Vikrama Cholan III's (1302 A.D) rule Vikrama Cholan Tirubhuvana Singhan had diabetes. He worshipped Arjuneswarar and donated lands to the temple. He got cured and hence there is a belief that praying to Arjuneswarar cures one of diabetes.

Background Sakonji was born in Yonezawa, Yamagata Prefecture, where his father had been a samurai in the service of the Yonezawa Domain. However, soon after his birth, the family relocated to Kanazawa, Ishikawa, and then to Osaka, where Sakonji was adopted by his uncle, who was a lawyer. After attending military preparatory schools, he entered the 28th class of the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy and graduated 8th of the 105 cadets in his class in December 1900. He served his midshipman assignment on the cruiser , which made along-distance navigational training voyage to Manila, Batavia, Singapore, Bangkok, Hong Kong, Incheon, Busan and Vladivostok in 1901. As an ensign, he was assigned to the cruiser as chief navigator. He served in combat in the Russo-Japanese War on torpedo boats, becoming a torpedo warfare specialist after the war. Promoted to commander in 1915, he led the training squadron on a long distance navigational training cruise to the South Pacific, Australia and New Zealand in 1916. During World War I, he was sent to the Netherlands and the United Kingdom as a military attach√© to observe modern western warfare firsthand. He was promoted to captain in 1919, and served on the Japanese delegation to the Treaty of Versailles. On his return to Japan, he was assigned to the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff. He later returned to sea in December 1923 as captain of the battleship and was promoted to rear admiral in 1924 and vice admiral in 1928.Japanese Biographical Encyclopedia 2009 Kodansha (in Japanese) In 1929, he was an influential member of the Japanese delegation at the London Naval Treaty negotiations. On his return to Japan in 1930, he became commander of the Training Fleet, and personally led a training voyage in 1931, going from Keelung to Hong Kong, Singapore, Colombo, Aden, Port Said, Naples, Toulon, Marseilles, Malta, Alexandria, Djibouti, Colombo, Batavia, Manila, Palau and Sasebo. In 1931, he became Vice-Minister of the Navy. In 1932, Sakonji became commander in chief of the IJN 3rd Fleet, and of the Sasebo Naval District. Sakonji had made a very favorable impression on the Commander in Chief of the Combined Fleet Suzuki Kantar≈ç due to his strong negotiating position during the London Naval Treaty negotiations and subsequent support for the Treaty Faction within the Imperial Japanese Navy.Asada. From Mahan to Pearl Harbor, page 144 Nevertheless, Sakonji earned the enmity of influential Fleet Faction leader, Prince Fushimi Hiroyasu, and Sakonji was effectively forced into the reserves in March 1934. Subsequently, Sakonji served as president of the North Sakhalin Oil Company from July 1935 to July 1941. Sakonji was selected by Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe to become Minister of Commerce and Industry in 1941. He was also granted a seat in the House of Peers in the Diet of Japan from January 1943. Under Prime Minister Suzuki Kantar≈ç in April 1945, he was again appointed to the Cabinet as a Minister of State, where he worked to bring about an end to the war by urging acceptance of the Potsdam Declaration. After the surrender of Japan, most members of the wartime Japanese cabinets were arrested for suspected war crimes by the Allied occupation authorities. However, Sakonji was not prosecuted due to his efforts for peace at the end of the war. Following the occupation of Japan, in 1951 Sakonji was asked to serve on the committee towards the establishment of the modern Japan Maritime Self- Defense Force. NotesReferences *Asada, Sadao.
