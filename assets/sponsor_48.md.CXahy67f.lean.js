Retrieved 2015-08-13. The series was a new starring vehicle for Valerie Harper, which went into development not long after she and husband Tony Cacciotti won their lawsuit against Lorimar-Telepictures over her dismissal from her NBC sitcom Valerie (which eventually continued without her as The Hogan Family). City was created by Paul Haggis, and like Harper's previous series, was also executive produced by Cacciotti. Synopsis Harper portrayed Liz Gianni, the city manager of an unnamed American city. In her line of work came dealings with the all-too-realistic but sometimes lighthearted issues of the modern-day city, from budget cuts to bureaucratic and political corruption, and the socioeconomic travails of inner-city life. Despite the turmoil that often ensued because of these problems, Liz focused on them with much exuberance, with a little kookiness thrown in, which ultimately made this a return to the type of character that first brought Harper fame on The Mary Tyler Moore Show and Rhoda in the early 1970s. Liz's breezy, Amazonian mentality played more to her advantage at home, where she had to constantly keep up with‚Äî-and fret over‚Äî-her rapidly maturing 19-year- old daughter Penny (LuAnne Ponce). Liz and Penny's frantic repertoire and sweet \\"mother-daughter\\" moments, filled with witty dialogue, was the other central base of the show. At work, Liz oversaw a multi-ethnic staff of crazies and eccentrics. Roger Barnett (Todd Susman) was the assistant city manager who spends most of his time betting on sports and trying to sell a worn-out racehorse he owns. Anna-Maria Batista (Liz Torres) is the tough Cuban purchasing agent whose most obvious character trait was pronouncing \\"yep\\" as \\"jep\\". Wanda Jenkins (Tyra Ferrell) was the sarcastic black secretary, who often discussed how she didn't want her young son to turn out like his father, a composer of classical music who actually made very little money. Also seen around City Hall were Gloria Elgis (Mary Jo Keenen), the city social coordinator, a stereotypically beautiful airhead spoiled by her wealthy family; Lance Armstrong (Sam Lloyd), the creepy statistician; and Victor Sloboda (James Lorinz), a dumb security guard, who in one episode thought a bandit had stolen the entire supply of White-Out for use in processing records for illegal immigrants. His solution to the problem: painting his entire body in correction fluid in order to \\"keep his eyes\\" on the supply! Liz and the gang all answered to Ken Resnick (Stephen Lee), the totally powerless, monumentally rotten Deputy Mayor. Running the newsstand/lunch counter at City Hall was Sean (Shay Duffin), an acerbic Irishman. Chuck (Rodney Ueno), an aggressive Asian mail clerk, was also part of the cast, but his character was dropped after the pilot.

The show kept up this performance through February sweeps, but the early success did not last long. Audiences diminished over the next few months, and although the series was still pulling respectable numbers at the end of its inaugural season that April, CBS passed on giving City a second season. From January until April, the show aired in the plum time slot of Mondays at 8:30/7:30c, between freshman hit Major Dad and sophomore hit Murphy Brown. CBS then pulled the show for May sweeps, during which time the series was cancelled. City reappeared on Fridays at 8:30/7:30c in June, where it aired three remaining original episodes before leaving the air for good. Coincidences between City and The Hogan Family City had more than one coincidental occurrence with Harper's former series, now known as The Hogan Family. Ms. Harper's husband, Tony Cacciotti, had served as co-producer on both series. However, the connection became stronger when LuAnne Ponce was cast as Penny Gianni in City‚Äîshe was the sister of Hogan Family star Danny Ponce (thus giving the Ponce siblings the distinction of having both been TV children of Valerie Harper). Harper's characters on both series had husbands named Michael. As if that weren't enough, CBS just happened to schedule City on Monday nights directly opposite The Hogan Family. Both shows even had a number of episodes directed by Howard Storm. City even used the same Cooper Black credit font that The Hogan Family had been using during all seasons in which Harper's replacement on that series, Sandy Duncan, had starred. Unauthorized use Despite its short run, the pilot episode of the series has continued to be seen by many, through their participation in product and consumer research. Research Systems Corporation, which runs public invitation-only conventions known as The New Television Preview, had acquired selected copies of City episodes from CBS for showings at their public events, which were falsely passed off, along with actual unaired network pilots, as a test preview for a new series being considered for nationwide broadcast.

The NMSDF is an all-volunteer, reserve military force which works in parallel to the state's National Guard. It is authorized by Title 32, Section 109, United States Code, NGB Reg. 10-4, Chapter 20, NMSA, 1978 Comp., the U.S. Constitution, and the New Mexico State Constitution. It is one of three military divisions of the Department of Military Affairs of the State of New Mexico (\\"DMA\\"). The other two military divisions are the New Mexico Army National Guard and the New Mexico Air National Guard. The Department is headed by the Adjutant General of the State of New Mexico, who holds the rank of Major General, a Deputy Adjutant General, and three Assistant Adjutants General. The NMSDF falls under the direct supervision of the assistant adjutant general of New Mexico for state guard affairs, who holds the rank of Brigadier General. The Governor of the State of New Mexico is the Commander- In-Chief of the NMSDF. The State Defense Force is organized as an internal security and emergency services reserve force. In September 2014, Brigadier General David Torres, commander of the New Mexico State Defense Force, announced a restructuring and modernization plan, which would be followed by an intensified recruiting campaign. History The New Mexico State Defense Force traces its lineage to the American Civil War, when Colonel Canby of the Union Army recruited troops for the First through the Fifth New Mexico Volunteers to fight alongside the Regular Army. During the Civil War, the units gained notoriety at the Battle of Valverde.Taylor, John. During World War II, the state of New Mexico created the New Mexico State Guard to replace the National Guard units sent overseas. New Mexico had State Guardsmen on continuous duty by December 1941, and by June 1944, the New Mexico State Guard counted over 600 members. Training Procedures and training for the New Mexico State Defense Force follow U.S. Army regulations and field manuals. While most of the soldiers in the NMSDF are former members of the Armed Forces of the United States, state guardsmen are not required to have prior federal military experience. The NMSDF now offers its own training in basic military discipline and demeanor, officer knowledge and skills, NCO knowledge and skills, and various operational aspects of assisting the National Guard and emergency management agencies with their state duties. Unit training includes emergency field medicine, desert and mountain search and rescue, and securing and operating a ‚ÄúReceive, Stage, and Store‚Äù warehouse for the Strategic National Stockpile during large-scale emergencies. The NMSDF requires that all of its personnel become qualified in the National Incident Management System (NIMS), and trains its members to become Military Emergency Management Specialists. Duties Brig. Gen. Raphael Warren (NMSDF) assumes command from Brig. Gen. (NMSDF) David Torres at a change of command ceremony in 2019. The New Mexico State Defense Force presently has the mission areas of radio communications, emergency field medicine, shelter operations, provision of honor guard duties, chaplaincy, heavy vehicle driving and maintenance, and public affairs. In all of these areas, the State Defense Force has the support of the New Mexico National Guard. While the State Defense Force functions as a reserve unit to the National Guard, it also has its own missions to assist and support community groups and law enforcement agencies in local communities. Despite some degree of autonomy, all present NMSDF missions must be approved by the Adjutant General before becoming operational. State guardsmen are required to attend mandatory military drill at least one weekend per month, and, can be activated and/or deployed by orders of the Adjutant General of the State of New Mexico, acting on behalf of and in the name of the Commander-In- Chief (the governor of New Mexico). Many members of the NMSDF are prior- military, and many are mid-career professionals like attorneys, physicians, engineers, professors, medical technicians, truck drivers, and graphic artists. The New Mexico State Defense Force maintains a medical unit, the 47th Medical Troop (CAV), which is simultaneously recognized as a unit of the Medical Reserve Corps (MRC) through the US Health and Human Services Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response. The 47th contains both medical and non-medical personnel, who are trained to aid in recovery from natural or man-made disasters by providing medical aid and sheltering. The 47th has the additional responsibility of supporting and securing the US Strategic National Stockpile and support search and rescue operations. In September 2013, specific personnel from the HHD, the 47th Medical Troop (MRC), and the Chaplains Corps were activated to several locations to set up and assist in shelter operations and community resource management and provide medical support in a recovery operations deployment following severe flooding. Legal protection =Employment protection= No employer in New Mexico is allowed to refuse to hire, to penalize, or to fire any employee because of his or her membership in the NMSDF, or because of that employee's absence from work due to a deployment. To do so is a misdemeanor. In addition to the employment discrimination protection provided to NMSDF members, all state, county, municipal, school district and other public employees who are members of the state defense force are entitled to fifteen days of paid leave per year for drills or deployments, separate from any vacation time or other leave time they may be given. =Pay= Members of the NMSDF do not receive pay for weekend drills. New Mexico law, however, authorizes state guardsmen to be eligible for worker's compensation if they are injured in the line of duty.

Most of them came from the east of the Socialist Republic of Macedonia and they settled mainly in the town of Kranj and the capital Ljubljana. Macedonian communities can be also found in larger towns such as Jesenice, Nova Gorica, Maribor and Celje. Around 450 Macedonians reside in the Celje region.  Culture  There are three larger cultural associations in Slovenia. The biggest ones are KUD Makedonija from Ljubljana,MKD-Makedonija-http://www.mkdmakedonija.si/ KUD Kiril i Metodij from Kranj MKD Kranj-http://www.mkd-kim.si// and Kud Biljana from Maribor.MKD Biljana-http://www.mkd- biljana.si/index.php?option=com_content&task;=view&id;=2&Itemid;=6 They were founded in the 1990s after Slovenia become an independent republic. Cultural Associations were founded to encourage learning of the Macedonian language, heritage and customs for those living in Slovenia. They mainly gather Macedonians for major holidays like Easter, Ilinden and Christmas. Each association has its own center for gatherings and folklore acts. There is also a Macedonian language school in Kranj which is targeted at younger Macedonians.  Religion  Macedonians in Slovenia are predominantly of Orthodox religion. Due to the lack of priests there is only one Macedonian Orthodox Church in Slovenia, which opens only on some occasions; for weekly mass adhererants of the church use the Serbian Orthodox Church.

It was founded in 1993 as the InterAcademy Panel (IAP). In 2000, the IAP founded the InterAcademy Council (IAC) and the InterAcademy Medical Panel (IAMP). The partnership was established in 2016 when it merged the three inter-related networks into IAP for Health (formerly IAMP),About: The InterAcademy Partnership IAP for Science (formerly IAP), and IAP for Policy (formerly IAC). The mission of IAP is for the world's merit-based academies to play a vital role in ensuring that science serves society inclusively and equitably and underpins global sustainable development by advising the public on the scientific aspects of critical global issues. It has released official statements on socially important topics, including the 2015 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, food and nutrition security, science education, biosecurity, water, science communication, women in science, human population growth, global warming, human reproductive cloning, and evolution. IAP has also advanced science diplomacy by bringing regional networks together to address global problems.  Governance  The highest decisive body of IAP is the General Assembly, which meets every third year, and where each member organization has one vote on organizational decisions. At these meetings, member academies elect new leadership, approve new members, report on organizational activities over the last triennial period, and approve a strategic plan for the next three years. In between the meetings, the work is directed by three executive committees, one for each pillar of the Partnership (or in the case of IAP Policy, a board), supported by a secretariat from a host academy. Each executive committee/board convenes annually, with two co- chairs presiding. One of the co-chairs shall be nominated by an academy in a low or middle income country (LMIC); the other shall be nominated by a high income country (HIC). Similar rules of diversity in economic development hold for the executive committee member academies in order to represent a global view. The number of member academies composing the executive committee varies: 11 member academies in IAP for Science, 9 member academies in IAP for Health, and 15 member academies in IAP for Policy. A Steering Committee composed of the six executive committee/board co-chairs guides the InterAcademy Partnership. From these six Steering Committee members, two are selected to act as co-Presidents. The current co-Presidents are Volker ter Meulen (Germany) and Depei Liu (China). A Board includes the Steering Committee along with one representative from each of four regional networks of academies: in Africa, the Americas, the Asia/Pacific region, and Europe, for a total of ten representatives.

IAP-Science, until 2003  IAP reports  IAP publishes reports and recommendations that utilize the expertise of member academies to address issues of interest to the global scientific and policy communities. IAP reports are not endorsed by academy members, but instead must have the consensus of an expert committee and undergo a rigorous peer review process. Examples of IAP reports include: # Harnessing science, engineering, and medicine (SEM) to address Africa's challenges: The role of African national academies, 2019 # Improving scientific input to global policymaking with a focus on the UN Sustainable Development Goals, 2019 # Opportunities for future research and innovation on food and nutrition security and agriculture: The InterAcademy Partnership's global perspective, 2018 # Enhancing the capacity of African science academies, 2015 # Responsible conduct in the global research enterprise, 2012 # Lighting the way: Toward a sustainable energy future, 2007 # Realizing the promise and potential of African agriculture, 2004  IAP statements  IAP also promotes its goals through \\"statements on issues of fundamental importance to humanity.\\" Statements present the combined consensus of the world's academies to provide independent, evidence-based advice and recommendations to policymakers in governments, international organizations, or academies themselves. Often an IAP statement can be used to globalise an issue on which a national academy or regional network of academies has already done a significant amount of work. An IAP statement is developed following a specific procedure and released only when the majority of IAP member academies have endorsed its contents. , p. 4\\\\. Thus, the statements are intended to represent the consensus of the scientific community rather than statements of IAP as an organisation in itself. As of 2020, IAP has issued twenty-one statements, as listed below. #IAP call for action to declare trauma as a disease, 2019. Signed by 46 of IAP for Health's 78 member academies. #IAP call for action to tackle the growing burden of dementia, 2018. Signed by 53 of IAP for Health's 78 member academies. #IAP statement on climate change and education, 2017. Signed by the majority of IAP for Science's 113 member academies. #IAP statement on science and technology for disaster risk reduction, 2017. Signed by the majority of IAP for Science's 113 member academies. #IAP call for action to improve the reproducibility of biomedical research, 2016. Signed by 46 members. #IAMP call for action to strengthen health research capacity, 2013. Signed by 42 members. #IAP statement on population and consumption, 2012. Signed by 105 members. #IAMP statement on the health co-benefits of policies to tackle climate change, 2010. Signed by 43 members. #IAP statement on tropical forests and climate change, 2009. Signed by 54 members. #IAP statement on ocean acidification, 2009. Signed by 70 members. The academies state that ocean water acidity has risen due to increased carbon dioxide (CO2) caused by human activities, and that it probably will rise further with severe effects on marine ecosystems if the emission of CO2 does not decrease considerably. They urge the issue be recognized among the problems addressed by the United Nations Climate Change Conference 2009 in Copenhagen. #IAP statement on the teaching of evolution, 2006. Signed by 70 members. #IAP statement on biosecurity, 2005, signed by 71 members. #IAP statement on access to scientific information, 2003, signed by 68 members. #IAP statement on science and the media, 2003, signed by 68 members. #IAP statement on scientific capacity building, 2003, signed by 68 members. #IAP statement on science education of children, 2003, signed by 68 members. #IAP statement on health of mother and child in developing countries, 2003, signed by 67 members. #IAP statement on human cloning, 2003, signed by 67 members. The academies support \\"a worldwide ban on the reproductive cloning of human beings\\", but at the same time call for \\"cloning to obtain embryonic stem cells for both research and therapeutic purposes to be excluded from this ban\\". #IAP statement on transition to sustainability, 2000, signed by 63 members. #IAP statement on science and technology and the future of cities, 1996, signed by 71 members. The academies note that there is an ongoing rapid worldwide urbanization. They state that this in itself is not necessarily a bad development, but that it may have rather negative effects, if appropriate measures are not taken in order to ensure the new city dwellers e.g. access to water and adequate housing. Therefore, active city planning is necessary, and so is further research on urbanization. #IAP statement on population growth, proposed 1993, ratified 1994, signed by 58 members. The academies state that \\"the world is undergoing an unprecedented population expansion\\", and that it is necessary to stop it. They noted that the amount of food produced (both on land and sea) per person was decreasing, and stated that many environmental problems were aggravated by the population expansion. The academies state that we must reach \\"zero population growth within the lifetime of our children\\". They enumerate means which should be taken to achieve this, and also to counteract the effects of the population growth on environment and food production, inter alia. This includes furthering equal opportunities for women, easy access to cheap and safe contraceptives, broad primary health care, governmental policies recognizing longer-term environmental responsibilities, and increased research on cultural, religious, and other factors, which \\"affect reproductive behavior\\". = Role in reviewing the IPCC process = In 2010, the council board recommended changes in the IPCC, such as having an executive committee with \\"individuals from outside the IPCC or even outside the climate science community.\\"InterAcademy Council Report Recommends Fundamental Reform of IPCC Management Structure Major changes from then within the IPCC approach include a stronger focus on the treatment of uncertainty (since the IAC 2010 IPCC review) and the involvement of risk management deliberations (based on fundamental conclusions in the AR4 Synthesis Report).

In 1842, his father purchased the larger building to the right, and made it the family home. Muir's birthplace is now a museum dedicated to his life and work John Muir's Birthplace, in Dunbar, East Lothian, Scotland, is a museum run by East Lothian Council Museums Service as a centre for study and interpretation of the work of the Scottish-American conservationist John Muir. History John Muir, the naturalist and preservationist, was born in the house at 126 High Street on 21 April 1838, the third child of Daniel Muir and his second wife Ann Gilrye Muir. The house is described as a \\"three storey stone building\\" in \\"the best business district of the town.\\" His father operated a successful grain and food store in the building as well, a business which he had inherited when his first wife died. The family emigrated to the United States in 1849, and Muir revisited Dunbar only once thereafter (in 1893), but kept in contact with relatives until his death in 1914. His connections with Dunbar were forgotten until the 1960s, when American enthusiasts began to turn up in Dunbar seeking information about their hero's roots. A small museum was created in the upper flat of the redeveloped and restored building under a private/public partnership in 1980, opening the following year. The museum has come under the ambit of a number of organisations. It was originally proposed to operate with a team of volunteer attendants, but operational matters were shortly assumed by East Lothian Tourist Board and continued until 1996. It then became the responsibility of East Lothian Council Museums Service, who now operate it for the present owner, the John Muir Birthplace Trust. The trust is a Scottish charity, formed in 1998 as a collaboration between East Lothian Council, the John Muir Trust, Dunbar's John Muir Association (relaunched in 2008 as the Friends of John Muir's Birthplace), and Dunbar Community Council, to preserve John Muir's birthplace and to turn it into a centre for study and interpretation of his work. The project started in 2002, and the centre opened to the public in August 2003. On 8 February 2012, the arrival of the 100,000th visitor was marked by a special presentation. Education The Birthplace centre has developed a number of downloadable factsheets, e.g. \\"John Muir for young people\\", \\"John Muir's Childhood Home\\", John Muir's Schooldays\\" and many more. Remembering John Muir The John Muir Trust is a charity which aims to protect wild land and wildlife and administers the John Muir Award scheme. The John Muir Way is a long distance footpath from Helensburgh to Dunbar. There is an older known footpath named John Muir Way from Musselburgh to Dunglass through East Lothian The John Muir Country Park is situated in the Dunbar area. In Martinez, California, United States is the John Muir National Historic Site, consisting mainly of John Muir's home, plus a portion of his orchards. There is also the John Muir Memorial site not far from the Historic Site that is composed of a statue of John Muir on a rock surrounded by trees. John Muir Day is celebrated every year on April 21 in California. John Muir College at University of California - San Diego.

Neil Simpson, excerpt from Lorraine Kelly: The Biography: The True Story of Lorraine Kelly, TV's Best Loved Presenter, May 31, 2007, Accessed May 12, 2008 Though the tradition originated in the military, it has entered Scottish lore as a rite, an expression of light-hearted curiosity about the custom, and even as a subversive gesture. However, in 2010, the Director of the Scottish Tartans Authority, Brian Wilton, described the tradition of not wearing undergarments as \\"childish and unhygienic\\". In response, racing driver David Coulthard and some kilt manufacturers spoke in favour of the tradition, while MSP Jamie McGrigor and Wimbledon champion Andy Murray admitted to wearing underpants under their kilts. History The earliest forms of the kilt, called a plaid or \\"great kilt\\", were worn over the existing garments of the time, such as trews or breeches with hose or leg wraps. From the late 1600s onward, historical paintings start to show some kilts worn with high socks, with no covering on the visible part of the upper legs. It is unknown exactly why the practice of wearing no undergarments under the kilt began, but many sources indicate it originated with the Scottish military uniform in the 18th century, leading to the invention of such expressions as \\"go regimental\\" or \\"military practice\\" for wearing no underwear. The earliest known reference to the practice is a series of satirical French illustrations in 1815 when Paris was occupied after the Battle of Waterloo. Even so, it is unknown if the practice was a dress code requirement, was left to individual soldier's preference, or merely a false rumor that later evolved into an actual practice. The kilt continued to be part of some regimental combat uniforms on the Western Front during the First World War: Every day the regiment would be inspected by a senior officer who would have a mirror to look under kilts. Anyone found wearing underpants would be sent back to take them off. However, in 1940 the kilt was retired from combat because of the vulnerability of bare skin to chemical agents, although it was retained as the formal dress uniform of the regiments. This practice led to an incident in 1997, when windy conditions during a military ceremony in Hong Kong caused a Black Watch soldier to be exposed in front of the press. 21st century , Highland dancers and athletes have been bound by the nature of their competitions to appropriately and modestly clothe themselves. In Highland Dance competitions and exhibitions, the regulations of the Scottish Official Board of Highland Dancing (SOBHD) have stated regarding underwear: \\"Dark or toning with the kilt should be worn, but not white.\\" In 2015, the Scottish barmen of Hootananny pub in Inverness abandoned kilts because female customers don't stop lifting them. Ian Howie, the pub‚Äôs assistant manager, said: \\"You get large groups of drinking women circling around when you are collecting glasses and asking whether you are true Scotsman ‚Äì and they find out for themselves. Mainly hen nights.\\" The traditional Scottish garment was initially chosen to give the venue a more authentic feel. Now Tartan shorts will be worn instead. In popular culture *Non-Scots and those unfamiliar with kilts seeking to determine the truth of the true Scotsman tradition can leave themselves open to innuendo and double entendre, as innocent queries can be turned on the questioner; as with the question \\"Is there anything worn under the kilt?\\" being answered with examples such as \\"No, nothing is worn, everything is in perfect working order!\\" or \\"Yes, socks, shoes, and talcum powder,\\" and \\"Yes, socks, shoes, and two shades of lipstick.\\" Humorous \\"Kilt Inspector\\" and \\"Official Kilt Inspector\\" T-shirts can be purchased in Scottish tourist shops and online. *In the film On Her Majesty's Secret Service, James Bond removes his kilt to seduce Ruby Bartlett. As it falls to the floor, she laughs and cries out, \\"It's true!\\" *In the 1995 film Braveheart, during the Battle of Sterling scene, the Scottish soldiers lift their kilts to flash the English archers, taunting them after an attack.https://www.thejournal.ie/mel-gisbon- braveheart-extras-1654169-Sep2014/ *The plot of the sixteenth Carry On... film, Carry On Up the Khyber, revolves around the mishaps of a fictional Scottish regiment following the discovery that one of them, Private Widdle, is not a true Scotsman. *In the Monty Python's Flying Circus sketch, \\"Ideal Loon Exhibition\\",Monty Python's Flying Circus, episode 37, series 3 one of the more popular attractions at the exhibition is the \\"Scotsman With Nae Trews Exhibit, Sponsored by Natural Gas\\".

Eddie then points a gun at him and tells him that was his last warning.

The symbol of the hotel is a salamander. Location , at 3/6, b.1, Rozhdestvenka, Moscow, 109012, Russia. History The Savoy Hotel opened in 1913. At that time, the original five- storey building had the most up-to-date equipment of the time, such as elevators, telephones in the rooms, and safes. Among the famous hotel guests were Sergey Yesenin, Isadora Duncan, and Antoine de Saint Exup√©ry. Moscow literati en masse honored the hotel with their presence, reading their new poems there. After the Russian Revolution and World War II the Savoy remained a main attraction for the children of the Communist elite. In 1959, in honor of the 10th anniversary of the German Democratic Republic, the hotel was renamed Berlin and started specializing on guests from Germany and Austria. Only in 1989 did the hotel return to its historical name. In recent years, Montserrat Caball√©, Luciano Pavarotti, Jos√© Carreras, Maradona, Richard Gere, Patricia Kaas, Cindy Crawford and other celebrities stayed at the hotel. In December 2005, the Savoy Hotel had a second birth. The total volume of investments in its reconstruction was over US$20,000,000. It finished with certification in the \\"5 stars\\" category and became the first Russian representative of the prestigious league of ¬´Small Luxury Hotels of the World¬ª. The redesign was made by Leonardo Tognoni, who had previously restored Palazzo Barberini and Borghese Gallery in Rome, as well as the Uffizi Gallery in Florence. The retro style of the hotel's past collaborates with the fashions of today. An important trend was the use of natural materials such as wood, marble, and wool. The fusion and grandeur of the hotel allows positioning it as a boutique hotel. Current ownership The hotel is owned by OAO Infa-Otel, whose stock is shared between Musgrave Holdings (84%), a member of the Guta Group, and the government of Moscow (16%).

The A40 in London passes through seven London Boroughs: the City of London, Camden, Westminster, Kensington & Chelsea, Hammersmith & Fulham, Ealing and Hillingdon, to meet the M40 motorway junction 1 at Denham, Buckinghamshire. The road has been re-routed several times in the last 100 yearspart of the route of the London section of the A40 was laid out in the 1920s and 1930s when Western Avenue was builtnow most of it is grade-separated, dual carriageway (divided highway). In the 1960s Westway was constructed, easing traffic access to and from the centre of the city. The A40 links the City of London and the West End to the M40 motorway and M25 motorway. The route is called The London to Fishguard Trunk Road (A40) in legal documents and acts. City of LondonCity of Westminster The A40 officially starts where St. Martin's Le Grand meets Cheapside. Here it shares a terminus with the A1, the main north London radial. First forming Newgate Street and then through Holborn to Holborn Viaduct. This viaduct carries the A40 over the A201 (leading to Blackfriars Bridge) and on to Holborn Circus where the A40 crosses the terminus of the A4. The A40 here is named High Holborn. One of the four Inns of Court, Gray's Inn, is on the north side of the road. Another, Lincoln's Inn, is on the south side. The road is now in the Borough of Camden. Leaving Holborn, the A40 crosses into the City of Westminster, forming New Oxford Street. The British Museum is close at this point. After crossing the southern end of Tottenham Court Road (the A400) at St Giles Circus, the A40 becomes Oxford Street. Oxford Circusas it was in March 2006looking down Regent Street which crosses Oxford Street. Under Oxford Circus is one of the busiest of London's underground stations. The Central, Bakerloo and Victoria lines all meet here. The Circus was constructed in the beginning of the 19th century, and was designed by John Nash Oxford Street is Europe's busiest shopping street. Many chain stores have their flagship store on the street, including John Lewis, Debenhams, Marks and Spencers, House of Fraser and Selfridges. There are several tube stations along the road: the Central line runs under Oxford Street and is London Underground's second busiest line with 180 million passengers a year. The busiest stations are Tottenham Court Road, Oxford Circus, and Bond Street, which provide access to five tube lines. The road forms the northern boundary of Soho; the main theatres and cinemas are located to the south near Leicester Square. The area contains a large number of clubs, bars and music venues; Wigmore Hall on Wigmore Street is a notable example. Centre Point was one of London's first skyscrapers. The A40 continues as Oxford Street to Marble Arch at the north-east corner of Hyde Park. Nearby is Speakers' Corner, where people are generally allowed considerable freedom of speech, although the police occasionally intervene. Nearby is the site of Tyburn gallows, where public executions took place from 1388 to 1793. At Marble Arch is a major road junction of Oxford Street, Park Lane (A4202), Bayswater Road (A402) and Edgware Road (A5). The A40 has taken three courses from here over the last thirty years. The last change was in 2000, when Westway lost its motorway status (A40(M)) and became the A40. Now that Westway is part of the A40, the road no longer follows its western route from the Marble Arch roundabout. To continue on the A40 from Oxford Street, turn northwards into Portman Street (A41)which continues as Gloucester Placeto join the London Inner Ring Road to the west of Baker Street Underground station. Turning left onto the A501 (Marylebone Road) links with the Marylebone Flyover and the start of Westway. Westway Westway is a long, elevated dual carriageway section of the A40 in west London. It runs from Paddington to North Kensington. It was constructed between 1964 and 1970 to relieve congestion at Shepherd's Bush, with traffic from Western Avenue struggling to enter central London along too narrow roads. Opening in July 1970, Westway was designated A40(M). Retaining its hard shoulders and including both four-lane and six-lane sections, it still resembles a motorway. In 2000, when responsibility for trunk roads in Greater London was transferred from the Highways Agency to the Greater London Authority, Westway lost its motorway status. The construction of Westway caused major disruption, with the demolition of houses and roads. When opened it was the largest continuous concrete structure in Britain. =Route= Westway starts from the Marylebone Flyover. Here the Marylebone Road (A501)part of the northern section of the London Inner Ring Road crosses the Edgware Road (A5) and continues as the A40 It runs close to the Great Western Main Line out of Paddington to join Western Avenue. Between the Marylebone Flyover and Westway, a 100-metre section of surface-level road allows westbound traffic from the Marylebone Flyover to exit towards the Harrow Road (A404) and eastbound traffic from the Harrow Road to access the Flyover. Eastbound traffic from the Westway cannot exit here to reach the Edgware Road and must continue ahead to the Marylebone Flyover. After passing Paddington Basin and Paddington station and crossing the Paddington branch of the Grand Union Canal, Westway follows the Hammersmith & City line through North Kensington and Westbourne Green passing three London Underground stations (Royal Oak, Westbourne Park and Ladbroke Grove) before flowing into Western Avenue. Background Leaving Marble Arch, the A40 continued along Bayswater Road and Holland Park Avenue (now the A402) running through Notting Hill Gate to Shepherd's Bush. Before Western Avenue was proposed and completed, the A40 continued along the Uxbridge Road (the present A4020) passing through Ealing, Southall, Uxbridge and Denham, Buckinghamshire. Still busy, the Uxbridge Road was redesignated the A4020, when Western Avenue was changed from being the A403, and the A40 route changed accordingly, From Shepherd's Bush, the A40 moved northbound along Wood Lanenear the BBC Television Centre to join Western Avenue adjacent to a roundabout with the M41, now the A3220, also referred to as the West Cross Route. The M41 and the A40(M) were downgraded to the A3220 and A40 at the same time in 2000. Western Avenue Starting at the junction with Old Oak Common Lane and Old Oak Road, East Acton, Western Avenue is approximately long. This junction is traffic light controlled, but its name 'Savoy Circus' recalls the roundabout which once formed the junction. From this point the A40 swings in a north- westerly direction towards North Acton, crosses the Great Western Main Line, and the final traffic light controlled junction known as 'Gypsy Corner' (A4000), to arrive at the Hanger Lane Gyratory System to connect with the A406 and A4005. The A40 passes under the gyratory system in a tunnel. Denham Roundabout The Denham Roundabout is where Western AvenueA40flows into the M40 motorway. The roundabout below provides a connection with the westbound continuation of the A40, together with the intersection of the road from Uxbridge (A4020) and the road from Slough to Watford (A412). When the M40 from Denham to High Wycombe was built, Western Avenue was extended at high level to make an end-on join with the motorway, and a larger roundabout was built below the bridges carrying the motorway. When first laid out, the roundabout had the traffic going round it clockwise in the usual way, but as traffic volumes built up the layout was alteredso that the traffic moved round the roundabout in both directionsmaking it almost a ring road with mini-roundabouts at the points where other roads join the main roundabout.

Designed to manage and control the flow of traffic within the capital, the road would have run from Battersea to Harlesden and would have paralleled the National Rail West London Line as an elevated road. Opening in 1970, together with Westway, it runs north-south between the northern elevated roundabout junction with the western end of the Westway (A40) and the southern Holland Park Roundabout. In 2000 its status was downgraded to an A-roada short, dual carriageway section of the A3220. =Westfield= A grade-separated junction was built approximately halfway along this section of the A3220 in 2008 to connect to the Westfield London shopping development. This shopping precinct in White City (London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham) is on a site bounded by the West Cross Route, Westway and Wood Lane (A219), and opened on 30 October 2008.

History Canadian Fairbanks Company (later Canadian Fairbanks-Morse Company) built the structure in 1911 as a warehouse for its large machinery and mill supply business. It was designed by David Brown and Hugh Vallance of Montreal, who also designed many of the original buildings on the University of Saskatchewan campus. It was built with reinforced concrete, uncommon at that time. From 1948 until 1985 the Fairbanks-Morse Warehouse served as the home to the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation and as a union hall. The building had CPR spur line until the mid-1960s, when much of the downtown was redeveloped. It changed hands several times, serving as a warehouse, offices, photography studio and art gallery. Some tenants of note include AKA Gallery, The Photographers Gallery and Video V√©rit√© (of which the latter two would merge to become PAVED Arts). The building was declared a heritage site by the city on December 9, 1995. In 2005-2006, Olstar Developments converted the building into 12 condominium loft spaces.

More formally, a partial word is a partial function u: \\\\\\\\{ 0, \\\\ldots, n-1 \\\\\\\\} \\\\rightarrow A where A is some finite alphabet. If u(k) is not defined for some k \\\\in \\\\\\\\{ 0, \\\\ldots, n-1 \\\\\\\\} then the unknown element at place k in the string is called a \\"hole\\". In regular expressions (following the POSIX standard) a hole is represented by the metacharacter \\".\\". For example, aab.ab.b is a partial word of length 8 over the alphabet A ={a,b} in which the fourth and seventh characters are holes. Algorithms Several algorithms have been developed for the problem of \\"string matching with don't cares\\", in which the input is a long text and a shorter partial word and the goal is to find all strings in the text that match the given partial word. Applications A compatibility graph of partial words Two partial words are said to be compatible when they have the same length and when every position that is a non-wildcard in both of them has the same character in both. If one forms an undirected graph with a vertex for each partial word in a collection of partial words, and an edge for each compatible pair, then the cliques of this graph come from sets of partial words that all match at least one common string. This graph-theoretical interpretation of compatibility of partial words plays a key role in the proof of hardness of approximation of the clique problem, in which a collection of partial words representing successful runs of a probabilistically checkable proof verifier has a large clique if and only if there exists a valid proof of an underlying NP-complete problem. The faces (subcubes) of an n-dimensional hypercube can be described by partial words of length n over a binary alphabet, whose symbols are the Cartesian coordinates of the hypercube vertices (e.g., 0 or 1 for a unit cube). The dimension of a subcube, in this representation, equals the number of don't-care symbols it contains. The same representation may also be used to describe the implicants of Boolean functions. Related concepts Partial words may be generalized to parameter words, in which some of the \\"do not know\\" symbols are marked as being equal to each other. A partial word is a special case of a parameter word in which each do not know symbol may be substituted by a character independently of all of the other ones.

Early years Hansen, born 1871 in Rungsted, Denmark, as the daughter of a blacksmith. showed promising stage talent at an early age. Daniel Krum, the Ballet Director of the Royal Danish Theatre asked her (aged 10) to join the company; however, her father refused to allow it. She made her stage debut at the age of 11 in the role of a child general in the fantasy play Tommeliden at the Casino Theater in Copenhagen. She also began singing in the Saint Stefan's Church choir at the age of 13. Hansen matured physically at an early age as well, and she received her confirmation one year earlier than usual. Her mature physical appearance allowed her to join a theater revue at 14 years of age. Her performances won critical praise in the press for her enjoyable singing voice, charming presence, and well-developed figure. However, when a newspaper interview revealed her age, it caused a scandal, and Hansen moved to Sweden for a year to escape the attention. Career In 1890 Hansen worked at the Morskabstheater and in the National Theaters revue. She sang a repertoire specially written for her (including pieces such as Aah, Dagmar and Linger Longer Loo) and performed in small revealing costumes which she sewed herself. The national newspapers praised her erotic performances, and in 1895 the song Oh Dagmar, written by Olfert Jespersen, became a sensation. Hansen became Denmark's first \\"pin-up girl\\" when she posed for a series of racy postcards and the photographic albums, Dagmar-Album i 31 Billeder, 1899, and Dagmar-Album i 49 Billeder, 1910. She also posed as a nude model for several Danish artists' masterworks, including Julius Paulsen's 1887 painting, Adam og Eva, and Vilhelm Bissen's sculpture from 1890, En J√¶gerinde. Hansen's performances as an erotic singer brought her into conflict with the public sense of morality. In 1899, she was forbidden from performing in the capital city of Copenhagen. In 1900, when she began to build a villa in the Copenhagen suburb of Hellerup, the neighbors circulated petitions to prevent it. However, she obtained the support of Frederick VIII, King of Denmark, who allowed her to give performances in a revue in Charlottenlund just outside the city. Her success continued, and the transportation to Charlottenlund soon gained the nickname \\"The Dagmar Train\\". Hansen also traveled and gave guest performances in Hamburg, Berlin, St. Petersburg, Holland, Hungary and Sweden. Marriage and later life In London in 1906, Hansen married a German businessman 14 years her junior, 21-year-old Max Moritz Fritz Heinemann. They lived in Hamburg until the outbreak of World War I, when the German Army drafted Heinemann and sent him to the Western Front. Hansen returned to Denmark and continued her career as an operetta singer. After the war, her husband, ill from mustard gas, moved to Denmark with her. Hansen's sister died in 1925. Hansen, who never had children of her own, took guardianship of her sister's children and raised them. In 1928 Hansen retired from the stage. Her husband died in 1954 and she moved to a home for the aged in her hometown of Rungsted, where she died in April 1959 at the age of 87. She is buried at The Assistens Cemetery in Copenhagen.

The flight crew consisted of two captains. The pilot in command had never previously landed at Funchal and was being trained to operate from the notoriously difficult airport by the other, more experienced captain, who was acting as co-pilot. The training was intended to take place during daytime, but due to a delay the aircraft reached its destination after dark. The non-scheduled flight departed from Zurich, making its first stop at Geneva Cointrin International Airport at 14:30 UTC. While at Geneva, the aircraft's departure to Funchal was delayed due to a hydraulic pump failure, and it finally took off at 16:26. At 19:38, the crew contacted Madeira control tower when they were at the ROSE reporting point at , and were cleared to descend to . At 19:55, the crew reported overflying Porto Santo island at and were instructed to continue their descent to 5000 ft and then to contact Funchal approach control. At 19:57, Funchal cleared the crew to descend to and informed them that the QNH was 1014.0 mb. Apparently, during the landing checklist, the crew forgot to set the altimeter to that value, and proceeded to the final 180¬∞ turn to the downwind leg well below the correct altitude, losing sight of the runway lights. Relying only on instruments, the pilot descended below the required during circling and reached the base leg below , impacting the sea soon after that. At the time of impact, the altimeter was reading . The aircraft had its landing gear down and the flaps were extended at 20 degrees. Thirty-five passengers and one hostess lost their lives, many becoming trapped inside the sinking fuselage. The remaining passengers and crew, including both pilots, were rescued by local fisherman and rescue teams, or swam to the nearby shore. The cause of the accident was attributed to pilot error, due to lack of coordination between the pilots, and to sensorial illusion. It was the second fatal air crash in a month at Funchal.

None of the designs was accepted by the USAAF and no cargo gliders were built by Schweizer during the war.Schweizer, Paul A: Wings Like Eagles, The Story of Soaring in the United States, pages 82-87. Smithsonian Institution Press, 1988. The four designs proposed are of note due to having been assigned Schweizer model numbers. Due to the lack of production of these designs, Schweizer concentrated on designing and building the TG-2 and TG-3 training gliders instead. When the training glider contracts were completed Schweizer turned to subcontract work for other aircraft manufacturers. This trend continued after the war when Schweizer would increasingly turn to subcontract work to supplement the small amount of revenue realized from designing and building gliders. Background The German use of glider-borne attack on the Belgian fortress of Eben-Emael and their use in the Battle of Crete convinced the US military that they would need glider-borne forces of their own.Schweizer, Paul A: Wings Like Eagles, The Story of Soaring in the United States, pages 78. Smithsonian Institution Press, 1988. The US Army had no glider pilot training program. Neither did they have any training or assault gliders when the war began. The USAAF, the US Navy and Marines all embarked on ambitious glider programs, starting in April 1941, some nine months prior to the Attack on Pearl Harbor and US entry into the war. Once the services had commenced procurement of training gliders, such as the Frankfort TG-1 and Schweizer TG-2 and schools were being set up, military attention turned to development of operational gliders for air assault use. Cargo glider specification The USAAF developed a specification for two types of combat cargo gliders. The specifications required manufacturers to submit proposals for: * Cargo glider, nine seat, landing speed of no more than 38 mph (62 km/h) with no flaps * Cargo glider, fifteen seat, landing speed of no more than 38 mph (62 km/h) with no flaps The low landing speed was intended to ensure that even if the gliders impacted trees or other hard obstacles on combat landings that troop survival would be likely. The specification required that the glider designs not include flaps to make the gliders cheap and simple to build and also to simplify pilot training. Company response Schweizer submitted one design each in response to the specification. The Schweizer brothers considered the specification flawed, as an aircraft that would land at 38 mph without flaps would require very low wing loading. To design an aircraft with a very low wing loading, but able to carry nine or fifteen troops, would require a very large wing, rendering the resulting aircraft cumbersome on the ground, especially on windy days. The designs that were submitted complied with the USAAF specification, but were considered by the company to be impractical. In the long run, the Schweizer's concerns with the specification were taken seriously and the requirements were later changed to allow higher landing speeds and the use of flaps, making the resulting gliders smaller and more useful. Schweizer also developed designs for six-place and single-place cargo gliders for military use. Like the earlier designs, none were put into production. Schweizer aircraft did not submit revised designs for the new specification, but instead concentrated on production of the army TG-2 and the navy and marine LNS-1 along with the new wooden structure TG-3. The TG-3 was designed to avoid the use of strategic materials, such as aluminum and took a large measure of company resources to design and produce in numbers. The company also moved into subcontract work for other companies, producing assemblies and components. After the war the specialization in subcontract work led Schweizer Aircraft to produce whole aircraft under sub-contract, such as the Grumman Ag Cat agricultural aircraft and the Hughes 300 helicopter, for which it later purchased the rights, renaming it the Schweizer 300. Models ;SGC 9-10 :In keeping with Schweizer's normal glider model nomenclature the troop glider designed to the nine-place specification was the SGC 9-10, or Schweizer Glider, Cargo, 9 seat, model 10. Some sources call it the SGC 8-10, indicating eight seats. ;SGC 15-11 :The Schweizer Glider, Cargo, 15 seat, model 11 was submitted in response to the USAAF specification for a fifteen seat cargo glider. ;SGC 6-14 :The Schweizer Glider, Cargo, 6 seat, model 14 was a design for a six seat cargo glider. ;SGC 1-15 :The Schweizer Glider, Cargo, 1 seat, model 15 was a design for a single seat cargo glider. Contract Results The winning contender for the original contract for the nine-seat glider was the Waco Aircraft Company. Their design became the Waco CG-3. Due to the limitations of the specification, the aircraft was not a success and the initial order of 300 was reduced to 100, with the intention to use them as trainers for the follow-on fifteen seat assault glider. WACO's fifteen seat design was also chosen as the winner in the competition for the modified specification. This aircraft served with great success as the Waco CG-4. Almost 14,000 were built and it played a role in the July 1943 Allied invasion of Sicily, the American airborne landings in Normandy on 6 June 1944 and in other important airborne assaults in Europe and in the China-Burma-India Theater.

Most of the Bhagavata Purana consists of Shuka reciting the story to the dying king Parikshit. Shuka is depicted as a sannyasi, renouncing the world in pursuit of moksha (liberation), which most narratives assert that he achieved. According to the Mahabharata, after one hundred years of austerity by Vyasa, Shuka was churned out of a stick of fire, born with ascetic power and with the Vedas dwelling inside him, just like his father. A slight different story is told in other scriptures. One day goddess Parvati asks Lord Shiva about the garland of skulls he always wears, asking whose skulls was it, and Lord Shiva replies that it is all the previous births of Parvati and he wears her skulls after she dies, as a memento of her. Surprised, Parvati asks why only she dies and not the lord with her? Lord Shiva says that he knows the secret of Amaratwa (immortality). Parvati requests the lord to tell her the secret of immortality. Lord Shiva shakes his damru so that every living being in the area leaves the place, so that the secret does not slip out to them. The lord says that he would close his eyes and recite the secret in a story form and she should make ‚Äúhmm‚Äù sound so that he knows that she is listening. Nearby, there was an egg of a parrot on the verge of cracking, and when the parrot comes out, he too becomes the listener of the story, but no one knows that he was there. The story is started and Parvati makes the sound, but mid-way falls asleep. The parrot, however, continues to make the ‚Äúhmm‚Äù sound and so the lord does not stop. Once the story is over, he finds that Parvati is asleep and that someone else eavesdropped and heard the secret. He notices the parrot and chases to kill him. The tiny parrot flies into a nearby forest and enters into the womb of Vyasa‚Äôs wife through her mouth, when she was yawning. The lord arrives and demand that the parrot comes out, but Vyasa persuades to leave the parrot as if he truly knew the secret, it was no use killing it as it will be still alive just like Rahu. Then Vyasa asks the parrot to come out, but it refuses, stating that if he comes out, he will be termed as Vyasa‚Äôs son and he does not want any attachment, and only want moksha. This continues for 12 years and it makes Vyasa‚Äôs wife bear the pain, as the parrot is growing in her womb as a child for all those years. Vyasa prays to Lord Vishnu to help his wife. Lord Vishnu, who was present on the earth as Krishna, arrives. Krishna assures the parrot that no one would kill him and he would be incapable of attachment and eligible for moksha. The parrot then comes out in a human form and is named ‚ÄúShuka‚Äù (Sanskrit for ‚Äúparrot‚Äù). The Mahabharata also recounts how Shuka was sent by Vyasa for training to King Janaka, who was considered to be a Jivanmukta or one who is liberated while still in a body. Shuka studied under Brihaspati and his own father, Vyasa. Shuka asked Janaka about the way to liberation, with Janaka recommending the traditional progression of the four ashramas, which included the householder stage. After expressing contempt for the householder life, Shuka questioned Janaka about the real need for following the householder path. Seeing Shuka's advanced state of realization, Janaka told him that there was no need in his case. Stories recount how Shuka surpassed his father in spiritual attainment. Once, when following his son, Vyasa encountered a group of celestial nymphs who were bathing. Shuka's purity was such that the nymphs did not consider him to be a distraction, even though he was naked, but covered themselves when faced with his father. Shuka is sometimes portrayed as wandering about naked, due to his complete lack of self-consciousness. A completely different version of the later life of Shuka is given in the Devi-Bhagavata Purana, considered a secondary Purana (upapurana) by many, but an important work in the Shakta tradition. In this account, Shuka is convinced by Janaka to follow the ashrama tradition and returns home to marry and follow the path of yoga. He has five children with his wife Pivari‚Äîfour sons and a daughter. The story concludes in the same vein as the common tradition, with Shuka achieving moksha. A place called Shukachari is believed to be the cave of Shuka, where he disappeared in cave stones as per local traditions. Shuka in Sanskrit means parrot and thus the name is derived from the large number of parrots found around the Shukachari hills. Shukachari literally means abode of parrots in the Sanskrit language.

Starting with Uttara Khand of Padma Purana has been a tradition. Here, Sri Shukacharya has been described as having the dominant attribute of dispassion to materialistic things including his body. Sri Madhvacharya has concluded Sri Shukachary as an incarnation of Rudra. Sri Shukacharya always appears as sixteen years old.

Following this unexpected loss Rodriguez remained unbeaten for another three years, winning ten fights and earning one draw. By March 1975 Rodriguez was sporting a record of 14-1-1. His career after this point is difficult to characterize; he remained competitive, mixing wins and losses to the end of his career, but compiling a distinctly mediocre record of 14-20-1 before retiring in 1983 following a loss to Gary Holmgren in a fight for the Minnesota junior middleweight title.

Its construction was undertaken by Junkers under the designation J 8 as proof of Hugo Junkers' belief in the monoplane, after his firm had been required by the Idflieg to submit a biplane (the J 4) as its entry in a competition to select a ground-attack aircraft. The J 8 design took the J 7 fighter as its starting point, but had a longer fuselage to accommodate a tail gunner, and larger wings. The prototype flew in late 1917 and was followed over the next few months by three more development aircraft. The Idflieg was sufficiently impressed to want to order the type, but had misgivings about Junkers' ability to manufacture the aircraft in quantity and considered asking Linke-Hoffmann to produce the type under licence. Finally, however, Junkers was allowed to undertake the manufacture as part of a joint venture with Fokker, producing a slightly modified version of the J 8 design as the J 10. Like the other Junkers designs of the period, the aircraft featured a metal framework that was skinned with corrugated duralumin sheets. 47 examples were delivered before the Armistice, including three built as floatplanes under the designation CLS.I (factory designation J 11).

He received his primary education at Vipulanantha Vidyalaya, Pethalai, after which he attended Hindu College, Valachchenai from Grade 6 until his G.C.E. Ordinary Level examinations (Grade 11). While at school, he was noted as a good cricketer, swimmer and volleyball player. Militant life Chandrakanthan was recruited to the Tamil Tigers as a child soldier on 4 April 1990 at the age of 16 by Vinayagamoorthi Muralitharan. As is conventional in the Tamil Tigers, he gave up his birth name and adopted the nom de guerre \\"Pillayan\\". It was then that he first worked under Vinayagamoorthi Muralitharan, alias Colonel Karuna Amman, who at the time was a District Leader of the Tamil Tigers and their commander of the Batticaloa and Ampara districts. In 2004, Karuna Amman fell out with the leader of the Tamil Tigers, Velupillai Prabhakaran, and defected from the organization on 3 March. He took around 1000 cadres with him and formed what was then referred to as the \\"Karuna Faction\\". Chandrakanthan joined Karuna and in his rebellion, and was named deputy leader of the party. However a number of cadres remained loyal to Prabhakaran, and they defeated Karuna's faction in a decisive battle near on the banks of the Verugal Aru in April 2004. The Karuna Faction then took a lower profile, maintaining a number of small camps in the southern end of the Eastern Province. Given covert backing by the Sri Lankan military, they carried out regular attacks against the Tamil Tigers throughout the east of the island. As the ceasefire in place since 2002 between the government and the Tamil Tigers broke down in mid-2006, the Sri Lankan Government launched a military offensive to drive the Tamil Tigers out of the Eastern Province. The Sri Lankan military fully achieved this objective in July 2007, with the aid of the TMVP, which overran a number of Tamil Tiger camps in the process. Political career =Embracing of democratic process= As the fighting was ongoing in the east, Karuna Amman made efforts to eventually give up arms and embrace the democratic process. He formed a political party called the Tamil Makkal Viduthalai Pulikal (TMVP) in 2004, making Chandrakanthan its deputy leader. The TMVP initially opened up two political offices in Batticaloa and Colombo. In April 2007 an internal rift erupted within the party, and after some confrontation Chandrakanthan displaced Karuna as party leader. Karuna subsequently left the country for the United Kingdom, where he was later arrested for violating immigration procedures and sentenced to jail in January 2008. This left Chandrakanthan as the undisputed leader of the TMVP. =Eastern elections= Following the clearing of the eastern province of the LTTE, elections were held on 10 March 2008 to elect members to nine local authorities in the eastern Batticaloa District. Chandrakanthan led the TMVP to wins in all nine bodies in contested in, some of which had not had elections for 14 years. At the elections, Chandrakanthan's father Arumugam Sivaneshathurai was elected as a member of the Koralepattu Pradeshiya Sabha. Following the successful conduction of the elections in Batticaloa, the Government announced it would hold elections to elect members to the Eastern Provincial Council on 10 May. After discussions, the TMVP and the ruling United People's Freedom Alliance (UPFA), the party of President Mahinda Rajapakse announced on 30 March that they would jointly contest the polls under the UPFA banner.The Lanka Sun, TMVP to contest east polls under UPFA‚Äôs ‚Äòbetel‚Äô symbol The opposition United National Party and Sri Lanka Muslim Congress, the largest Muslim Party in the country, also formed a coalition to contest the elections, providing the main challenger to the UPFA. Chandrakanthan explained the policies of the TMVP to the international media prior to the EPC elections, stating that the TMVP needed to do better things for Tamil people through political process, rather than involving in an armed struggle to appeal for an independent state for them. While admitting the TMVP still had armed cadres, he stated they were for their protection from the Tamil Tigers, who were yet to be disarmed, and who Chandrakanthan said were \\"waiting for the opportune time to strike at us and physically liquidate us from the face of this earth.\\" The UPFA went on to win the elections, securing 52% of the popular vote and 20 of the 37 seats in the Provincial Council. Chandrakanthan also won the most number of preferential votes in the Batticaloa District. =Chief Ministership= After the election, there was a tussle between Chandrakanthan and M.L.A.M. Hizbullah, who was the leading Muslim candidate in the UPFA as to who should be appointed Chief Minister. On 16 May, after intense discussions, President Mahinda Rajapakse appointed Chandrakanthan as the first ever Chief Minister of the Eastern Province, and he took oaths as Chief Minister in front of the President soon after. Following his appointment as Chief Minister, Chandrakanthan, a Hindu, visited Kandy on 18 May to get the blessings of Sri Lanka's most venerable Buddhist Monks, the Mahanayake Thera's of the Asgiriya and Malwatte chapters. The Theras commended Chandrakanthan for joining the democratic process and leaving arms behind, and urged him to work for national unity. Chandrakanthan also visited Sri Lanka's most sacred Buddhist site, the Temple of the Tooth, which the Tamil Tigers bombed in 1998, and apologized for the harm that was done in the attack. The tension increased between Tamil and Muslim ethnic communities in Kaanththaankudi area of eastern Batticaloa district after killing of 2 TMVP members on 22 May 2008. Chandrakanthan and Minister M.L.A.M. Hizbullah visited the area and resolved the matter by urging the people to live in peacefully. Also Chandrakanthan handed over TMVP members to the Police, who were responsible for abduction of 2 Muslim youths in Eravur on 25 May 2008. Many Sri Lankan Tamils feel that Chandrakanthan's political career had come to an end, after he lost his Chief Ministership of the Eastern Province.

A national push for expansion and progress toward the latter part of the 19th century stimulated interest in draining the Everglades for agricultural use. According to historians, \\"From the middle of the nineteenth century to the middle of the twentieth century, the United States went through a period in which wetland removal was not questioned. Indeed, it was considered the proper thing to do.\\"Meindl, Christopher, et al. (December, 2002). \\"On the Importance of Claims-Making: The Role of James O. Wright in Promoting the Drainage of Florida's Everglades in the Early Twentieth Century\\", Annals of the Association of American Geographers, 92 (4), p. 682‚Äì701. A pattern of political and financial motivation, and a lack of understanding of the geography and ecology of the Everglades have plagued the history of drainage projects. The Everglades are a part of a massive watershed that originates near Orlando and drains into Lake Okeechobee, a vast and shallow lake. As the lake exceeds its capacity in the wet season, the water forms a flat and very wide river, about long and wide. As the land from Lake Okeechobee slopes gradually to Florida Bay, water flows at a rate of half a mile (0.8 km) a day. Before human activity in the Everglades, the system comprised the lower third of the Florida peninsula. The first attempt to drain the region was made by real estate developer Hamilton Disston in 1881. Disston's sponsored canals were unsuccessful, but the land he purchased for them stimulated economic and population growth that attracted railway developer Henry Flagler. Flagler built a railroad along the east coast of Florida and eventually to Key West; towns grew and farmland was cultivated along the rail line. During his 1904 campaign to be elected governor, Napoleon Bonaparte Broward promised to drain the Everglades, and his later projects were more effective than Disston's. Broward's promises sparked a land boom facilitated by blatant errors in an engineer's report, pressure from real estate developers, and the burgeoning tourist industry throughout south Florida. The increased population brought hunters who went unchecked and had a devastating impact on the numbers of wading birds (hunted for their plumes), alligators, and other Everglades animals. Severe hurricanes in 1926 and 1928 caused catastrophic damage and flooding from Lake Okeechobee that prompted the Army Corps of Engineers to build a dike around the lake. Further floods in 1947 prompted an unprecedented construction of canals throughout southern Florida. Following another population boom after World War II, and the creation of the Central and Southern Florida Flood Control Project, the Everglades was divided into sections separated by canals and water control devices that delivered water to agricultural and newly developed urban areas. However, in the late 1960s, following a proposal to construct a massive airport next to Everglades National Park, national attention turned from developing the land to restoring the Everglades. Exploration Marines search for Seminoles among the mangroves during the Second Seminole War American involvement in the Everglades began during the Second Seminole War (1836‚Äì42), a costly and very unpopular conflict. The United States spent between $30 million and $40 million and lost between 1,500 and 3,000 lives. The U.S. military drove the Seminoles into the Everglades and were charged with the task of finding them, defeating them, and moving them to Oklahoma Indian territory. Almost 4,000 Seminoles were killed in the war or were removed.Douglas, p. 245.Dovell, J. E. (July 1947). \\"The Everglades Before Reclamation\\", The Florida Historical Quarterly, 26 (1), p. 1‚Äì44. The U.S. military was completely unprepared for the conditions they found in the Everglades. They tore their clothes on sawgrass, ruined their boots on the uneven limestone floor, and were plagued by mosquitoes. Soldiers' legs, feet, and arms were cut open on the sawgrass and gangrene infection set in, taking many lives and limbs. Many died of mosquito-borne illness. After slogging through mud, one private died in his tracks of exhaustion in 1842. General Thomas Jesup admitted the military was overwhelmed by the terrain when he wrote to the Secretary of War in 1838, trying to dissuade him from prolonging the war. Opinion about the value of Florida to the Union was mixed: some thought it a useless land of swamps and horrible animals, while others thought it a gift from God for national prosperity.Grunwald, p. 31‚Äì32. In 1838 comments in The Army and Navy Chronicle supported future development of southern Florida: > [The] climate [is] most delightful; but, from want of actual observation, > [it] could not speak so confidently of the soil, although, from the > appearance of the surrounding vegetation, a portion of it, at least, must be > rich. Whenever the aborigines shall be forced from their fastnesses, as > eventually they must be, the enterprising spirit of our countrymen will very > soon discover the sections best adapted to cultivation, and the now barren > or unproductive everglades will be made to blossom like a garden. It is the > general impression that these everglades are uninhabitable during the summer > months, by reason of their being overflowed by the abundant rains of the > season; but if it should prove that these inundations are caused or > increased by obstructions to the natural courses of the rivers, as outlets > to the numerous lakes, American industry will remove these > obstructions.White, Frank (October 1959). \\"The Journals of Lieutenant John > Pickell, 1836‚Äì1837\\", The Florida Historical Quarterly, 38 (2), p. 143‚Äì172. Map of the Everglades by the U.S. War Department in 1856: Military action during the Seminole Wars improved understanding of the features of the Everglades. The military penetration of southern Florida offered the opportunity to map a poorly understood part of the country. As late as 1823, official reports doubted the existence of a large inland lake, until the military met the Seminoles at the Battle of Lake Okeechobee in 1837.Lodge, p. 110 To avenge repeated surprise attacks on himself and ammunition stores, Colonel William Harney led an expedition into the Everglades in 1840, to hunt for a chief named Chekika. With Harney were 90 soldiers in 16 canoes. One soldier's account of the trip in the St. Augustine News was the first printed description of the Everglades available to the general public. The anonymous writer described the hunt for Chekika and the terrain they were crossing: \\"No country that I have ever heard of bears any resemblance to it; it seems like a vast sea filled with grass and green trees, and expressly intended as a retreat for the rascally Indian, from which the white man would never seek to drive them\\".Tebeau, p. 66‚Äì67. The final blame for the military stalemate was determined to lie not in military preparation, supplies, leadership, or superior tactics by the Seminoles, but in Florida's impenetrable terrain. An army surgeon wrote: \\"It is in fact a most hideous region to live in, a perfect paradise for Indians, alligators, serpents, frogs, and every other kind of loathsome reptile.\\"Grunwald, p. 42. The land seemed to inspire extreme reactions of wonder or hatred. In 1870, an author described the mangrove forests as a \\"waste of nature's grandest exhibition to have these carnivals of splendid vegetation occurring in isolated places where it is but seldom they are seen.\\"Tebeau, p. 71. A band of hunters, naturalists, and collectors ventured through in 1885, taking along with them the 17-year-old grandson of an early resident of Miami. The landscape unnerved the young man shortly after he entered the Shark River: \\"The place looked wild and lonely. About three o'clock it seemed to get on Henry's nerves and we saw him crying, he would not tell us why, he was just plain scared.\\"Tebeau, p. 75‚Äì76. In 1897, an explorer named Hugh Willoughby spent eight days canoeing with a party from the mouth of the Harney River to the Miami River. He wrote about his observations and sent them back to the New Orleans Times-Democrat. Willoughby described the water as healthy and wholesome, with numerous springs, and 10,000 alligators \\"more or less\\" in Lake Okeechobee. The party encountered thousands of birds near the Shark River, \\"killing hundreds, but they continued to return\\".McCally, p. 65‚Äì69. Willoughby pointed out that much of the rest of the country had been mapped and explored except for this part of Florida, writing, \\"(w)e have a tract of land one hundred and thirty miles long and seventy miles wide that is as much unknown to the white man as the heart of Africa.\\"Stephan, L. Lamar (December 1942). \\"Geographic Role of the Everglades in the Early History of Florida\\", The Scientific Monthly, 55, (6) p. 515‚Äì526. Drainage As early as 1837, a visitor to the Everglades suggested the value of the land without the water: > Could it be drained by deepening the natural outlets? Would it not open to > cultivation immense tracts of rich vegetable soil? Could the waterpower, > obtained by draining, be improved to any useful purpose? Would such draining > render the country unhealthy? ... Many queries like these passed through our > minds. They can only be solved by a thorough examination of the whole > country. Could the waters be lowered ten feet, it would probably drain six > hundred thousand acres; should this prove to be a rich soil, as would seem > probable, what a field it would open for tropical productions! What > facilities for commerce! Territorial representative David Levy proposed a resolution that was passed in Congress in 1842: \\"that the Secretary of War be directed to place before this House such information as can be obtained in relation to the practicability and probable expense of draining the everglades of Florida.\\" From this directive Secretary of the Treasury Robert J. Walker requested Thomas Buckingham Smith from St. Augustine to consult those with experience in the Everglades on the feasibility of draining them, saying that he had been told two or three canals to the Gulf of Mexico would be sufficient. Smith asked officers who had served in the Seminole Wars to respond, and many favored the idea, promoting the land as a future agricultural asset to the South. A few disagreed, such as Captain John Sprague, who wrote he \\"never supposed the country would excite an inquiry, other than as a hiding place for Indians, and had it occurred to me that so great an undertaking, one so utterly impracticable, as draining the Ever Glades was to be discussed, I should not have destroyed the scratch of pen upon a subject so fruitful, and which cannot be understood but by those who have waded the water belly deep and examined carefully the western coast by land and by water.\\" Nevertheless, Smith returned a report to the Secretary of the Treasury asking for $500,000 to do the job.Douglas, p. 253. The report is the first published study on the topic of the Everglades, and concluded with the statement: > The Ever Glades are now suitable only for the haunt of noxious vermin or the > resort of pestilent reptiles. The statesman whose exertions shall cause the > millions of acres they contain, now worse than worthless, to teem with the > products of agricultural industry; that man who thus adds to the resources > of his country ... will merit a high place in public favor, not only with > his own generation, but with posterity. He will have created a State! Smith suggested cutting through the rim of the Everglades (known today as the Atlantic Coastal Ridge), connecting the heads of rivers to the coastline so that of water would be drained from the area. The result, Smith hoped, would yield farmland suitable for corn, sugar, rice, cotton, and tobacco.Dovell, Junius (July 1948). \\"The Everglades: A Florida Frontier\\", Agricultural History, 22 (3), p. 187‚Äì197. In 1850 Congress passed a law that gave several states wetlands within their state boundaries. The Swamp and Overflowed Lands Act ensured that the state would be responsible for funding the attempts at developing wetlands into farmlands. Florida quickly formed a committee to consolidate grants to pay for such attempts, though attention and funds were diverted owing to the Civil War and Reconstruction. Not until after 1877 did attention return to the Everglades. =Hamilton Disston's canals= Hamilton Disston's land sale notice After the Civil War, an agency named the Internal Improvement Fund (IIF), charged with using grant money to improve Florida's infrastructure through canals, rail lines, and roads, was eager to be rid of the debt incurred by the Civil War. IIF trustees found a Pennsylvania real estate developer named Hamilton Disston who was interested in implementing plans to drain the land for agriculture. Disston was persuaded to buy of land for $1 million in 1881.Davis, T. Frederick (January 1939). \\"The Disston Land Purchase \\", The Florida Historical Quarterly, 17 (3), p. 201‚Äì211. The New York Times declared it the largest purchase of land ever by any individual.Barnett, p. 17. Disston began building canals near St. Cloud to lower the basin of the Caloosahatchee and Kissimmee Rivers. His workers and engineers faced conditions similar to those of the soldiers during the Seminole Wars; it was harrowing, backbreaking labor in dangerous conditions. The canals seemed at first to work in lowering the water levels in the wetlands surrounding the rivers. Another dredged waterway between the Gulf of Mexico and Lake Okeechobee was built, opening the region to steamboat traffic.Grunwald, p. 92‚Äì93. Disston's engineers focused on Lake Okeechobee as well. As one colleague put it, \\"Okeechobee is the point to attack\\"; the canals were to be \\"equal or greater than the inflow from the Kissimmee valley, which is the source of all the evil.\\"Grunwald, p. 90. Disston sponsored the digging of a canal long from Lake Okeechobee towards Miami, but it was abandoned when the rock proved denser than the engineers had expected. Though the canals lowered the groundwater, their capacity was inadequate for the wet season. A report that evaluated the failure of the project concluded: \\"The reduction of the waters is simply a question of sufficient capacity in the canals which may be dug for their relief\\".Douglas, p. 286. Though Disston's canals did not drain, his purchase primed the economy of Florida. It made news and attracted tourists and land buyers alike. Within four years property values doubled, and the population increased significantly. One newcomer was the inventor Thomas Edison, who bought a home in Fort Myers.Douglas, p. 284. Disston opened real estate offices throughout the United States and Europe, and sold tracts of land for $5 an acre, establishing towns on the west coast and in central Florida. English tourists in particular were targeted and responded in large numbers.Patterson, Gordon (Summer 1997). \\"Ditches and Dreams: Nelson Fell and the Rise of Fellsmere\\", The Florida Historical Quarterly, 76 (1), p. 1‚Äì20. Florida passed its first water laws to \\"build drains, ditches, or water courses upon petition of two or more landowners\\" in 1893.Barnett, p. 18. =Henry Flagler's railroads= Due to Disston's purchase, the IIF was able to sponsor railroad projects, and the opportunity presented itself when oil tycoon Henry Flagler became enchanted with St. Augustine during a vacation. He built the opulent Ponce de Leon Hotel in St. Augustine in 1888, and began buying land and building rail lines along the east coast of Florida, first from Jacksonville to Daytona, then as far south as Palm Beach in 1893. Flagler's establishment of \\"the Styx\\", a settlement for hotel and rail line workers across the river from the barrier island containing Palm Beach, became West Palm Beach.\\"Henry Flagler.\\" Encyclopedia of World Biography Supplement, Vol. 21. Gale Group, 2001. Along the way he built resort hotels, transforming territorial outposts into tourist destinations and the land bordering the rail lines into citrus farms.\\"Henry Morrison Flagler.\\" Dictionary of American Biography Base Set. American Council of Learned Societies, 1928‚Äì1936. The winter of 1894‚Äì1895 produced a bitter frost that killed citrus trees as far south as Palm Beach. Miami resident Julia Tuttle sent Flagler a pristine orange blossom and an invitation to visit Miami, to persuade him to build the railroad farther south. Although he had earlier turned her down several times, Flagler finally agreed, and by 1896 the rail line had been extended to Biscayne Bay.Bramson, Seth (1998). \\"A Tale of Three Henrys\\", The Journal of Decorative and Propaganda Arts, 23, Florida Theme Issue, p. 113‚Äì143. Three months after the first train arrived, the residents of Miami, 512 in all, voted to incorporate the town. Flagler publicized Miami as a \\"Magic City\\" throughout the United States and it became a prime destination for the extremely wealthy after the Royal Palm Hotel was opened.Bush, Gregory (May, 1999). \\"Playground of the USA\\", The Pacific Historical Review, 62 (2), p. 153‚Äì172. =Broward's \\"Empire of the Everglades\\"= A canal lock in the Everglades Drainage District around 1915 Despite the sale of to Disston and the skyrocketing price of land, by the turn of the 20th century the IIF was bankrupt due to mismanagement.Douglas, p. 309. Legal battles ensued between the State of Florida and the railroad owners about who owned the rights to sell reclaimed land in the Everglades. In 1904 gubernatorial campaigning, the strongest candidate, Napoleon Bonaparte Broward, made draining the Everglades a major plank. He called the future of south Florida the \\"Empire of the Everglades\\" and compared its potential to that of Holland and Egypt: \\"It would indeed be a commentary on the intelligence and energy of the State of Florida to confess that so simple an engineering feat as the drainage of a body of land above the sea was above their power\\", he wrote to voters.Douglas, p. 312. Soon after his election, he fulfilled his promise to \\"drain that abominable pestilence-ridden swamp\\"Carter, p. 78. and pushed the Florida legislature to form a group of commissioners to oversee reclamation of flooded lands. They began by taxing counties that would be affected by the drainage attempts, at 5 cents an acre, and formed the Everglades Drainage District in 1907. Broward asked James O. Wright‚Äîan engineer on loan to the State of Florida from the USDA's Bureau of Drainage Investigations‚Äîto draw up plans for drainage in 1906. Two dredges were built by 1908, but had cut only of canals. The project quickly ran out of money, so Broward sold real estate developer Richard \\"Dicky\\" J. Bolles a million dollars worth of land in the Everglades, , before the engineer's report had been submitted.McCally, p. 93‚Äì94. Abstracts from Wright's report were given to the IIF stating that eight canals would be enough to drain at a cost of a dollar an acre.McCally, p. 96. The abstracts were released to real estate developers who used them in their advertisements, and Wright and the USDA were pressed by the real estate industry to publicize the report as quickly as possible. Wright's supervisor noted errors in the report, as well as undue enthusiasm for draining, and delayed its release in 1910. Different unofficial versions of the report circulated‚Äîsome that had been altered by real estate interests‚Äîand a version hastily put together by Senator Duncan U. Fletcher called U.S. Senate Document 89 included early unrevised statements, causing a frenzy of speculation. Blueprint for drainage canals in the Everglades in 1921 Wright's initial report concluded that drainage would not be difficult. Building canals would be more cost effective than constructing a dike around Lake Okeechobee. The soil would be fertile after drainage, the climate would not be adversely affected, and the enormous lake would be able to irrigate farmland in the dry season. Wright based his conclusions on 15 years of weather data since the recording of precipitation began in the 1890s. His calculations concentrated on the towns of Jupiter and Kissimmee. Since weather data had not been recorded for any area within the Everglades, none was included in the report. Furthermore, the heaviest year of rain on record, Wright assumed, was atypical, and he urged that canals should not be constructed to bear that amount of water due to the expense. Wright's calculations for what canals should be able to hold were off by 55 percent.McCally, p. 101. His most fundamental mistake, however, was designing the canals for a maximum rainfall of of water a day, based on flawed data for July and August rainfall, despite available data that indicated torrential downpours of and had occurred in 24-hour periods. Though a few voices expressed skepticism of the report's conclusions‚Äînotably Frank Stoneman, the editor of the Miami News-Record (the forerunner of The Miami Herald)‚Äîthe report was hailed as impeccable, coming from a branch of the U.S. government.Grunwald, p. 144. In 1912 Florida appointed Wright to oversee the drainage, and the real estate industry energetically misrepresented this mid- level engineer as the world's foremost authority on wetlands drainage, in charge of the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation. However, the U.S. House of Representatives investigated Wright since no report had officially been published despite the money paid for it. Wright eventually retired when it was discovered that his colleagues disagreed with his conclusions and refused to approve the report's publication. One testified at the hearings: \\"I regard Mr. Wright as absolutely and completely incompetent for any engineering work\\".McCally, p. 101‚Äì12. Governor Broward ran for the U.S. Senate in 1908 but lost. Broward and his predecessor, William Jennings, were paid by Richard Bolles to tour the state to promote drainage. Broward was elected to the Senate in 1910, but died before he could take office. He was eulogized across Florida for his leadership and progressive inspiration. Rapidly growing Fort Lauderdale paid him tribute by naming Broward County after him (the town's original plan had been to name it Everglades County). Land in the Everglades was being sold for $15 an acre a month after Broward died.Grunwald, p. 148‚Äì149. Meanwhile, Henry Flagler continued to build railway stations at towns as soon as the populations warranted them. News of the Panama Canal inspired him to connect his rail line to the closest deep water port. Biscayne Bay was too shallow, so Flagler sent railway scouts to explore the possibility of building the line through to the tip of mainland Florida. The scouts reported that not enough land was present to build through the Everglades, so Flagler instead changed the plan to build to Key West in 1912. Boom and plume harvesting Hialeah in 1921 Real estate companies continued to advertise and sell land along newly dug canals. In April 1912‚Äîthe end of the dry season‚Äîreporters from all over the U.S. were given a tour of what had recently been drained, and they returned to their papers and raved about the progress.Grunwald, p. 153. Land developers sold 20,000 lots in a few months. But as news about the Wright report continued to be negative, land values plummeted, and sales decreased. Developers were sued and arrested for mail fraud when people who had spent their life savings to buy land arrived in south Florida expecting to find a dry parcel of land to build upon and instead found it completely underwater.McCally, p. 107‚Äì108. Advertisements promised land that would yield crops in eight weeks, but for many it took at least as long just to clear. Some burned off the sawgrass or other vegetation only to discover that the underlying peat continued to burn. Animals and tractors used for plowing got mired in the muck and were useless. When the muck dried, it turned to a fine black powder and created dust storms.McCally, p. 124‚Äì126. Settlers encountered rodents, skinks, and biting insects, and faced dangers from mosquitoes, poisonous snakes and alligators. Though at first crops sprouted quickly and lushly, they just as quickly wilted and died, seemingly without reason.Douglas, p. 318. It was discovered later that the peat and muck lacked copper and other trace elements. The USDA released a pamphlet in 1915 that declared land along the New River Canal would be too costly to keep drained and fertilized; people in Ft. Lauderdale responded by collecting all of the pamphlets and burning them.Douglas, p. 325. With the increasing population in towns near the Everglades came hunting opportunities. Even decades earlier, Harriet Beecher Stowe had been horrified at the hunting by visitors, and she wrote the first conservation publication for Florida in 1877: \\"[t]he decks of boats are crowded with men, whose only feeling amid our magnificent forests, seems to be a wild desire to shoot something and who fire at every living thing on shore.\\"Grunwald, p. 119‚Äì120. Otters and raccoons were the most widely hunted for their skins. Otter pelts could fetch between $8 and $15 each. Raccoons, more plentiful, only warranted 75 cents each in 1915. Hunting often went unchecked; on one trip, a Lake Okeechobee hunter killed 250 alligators and 172 otters.McCally, p. 117. A 1904 magazine cutout showing the plumes for women's hats that were harvested from wading birds in the Everglades Wading birds were a particular target. Their feathers were used in women's hats from the late 19th century until the 1920s. In 1886, five million birds were estimated to have been killed for their feathers.Grunwald, p. 120. They were usually shot in the spring, when their feathers were colored for mating and nesting. Aigrettes, as the plumes were called in the millinery business, sold in 1915 for $32 an ounce, also the price of gold. Millinery was a $17-million-a-year industryDouglas, p. 310. that motivated plume harvesters to lie in wait at the nests of egrets and other large birds during the nesting season, shoot the parents with small-bore rifles, and leave the chicks to starve. Many hunters refused to participate after watching the gruesome results of a plume hunt.Grunwald, p. 126. Still, plumes from Everglades wading birds could be found in Havana, New York City, London, and Paris. A dealer in New York paid at least 60 hunters to provide him with \\"almost anything that wore feathers, but particularly the Herons, Spoonbills, and showy birds\\". Hunters could collect plumes from a hundred birds on a good day.McCally, p.117‚Äì118. Plume harvesting became a dangerous business. The Audubon Society became concerned with the amount of hunting being done in rookeries in the mangrove forests. In 1902, they hired a warden, Guy Bradley, to watch the rookeries around Cuthbert Lake. Bradley had lived in Flamingo within the Everglades, and was murdered in 1905 by one of his neighbors after he tried to prevent him from hunting.Douglas, p. 310‚Äì311. Protection of birds was the reason for establishing the first wildlife refuge when President Theodore Roosevelt set Pelican Island as a sanctuary in 1903. In the 1920s, after birds were protected and alligators hunted nearly to extinction, Prohibition created a living for those willing to smuggle alcohol into the U.S. from Cuba. Rum- runners used the vast Everglades as a hiding spot: there were never enough law enforcement officers to patrol it.Douglas, p. 330. The advent of the fishing industry, the arrival of the railroad, and the discovery of the benefits of adding copper to Okeechobee muck soon created unprecedented numbers of residents in new towns like Moore Haven, Clewiston, and Belle Glade. By 1921, 2,000 people lived in 16 new towns around Lake Okeechobee. Sugarcane became the primary crop grown in south Florida and it began to be mass-produced. Miami experienced a second real estate boom that earned a developer in Coral Gables $150 million and saw undeveloped land north of Miami sell for $30,600 an acre.Douglas, p. 334. Miami became cosmopolitan and experienced a renaissance of architecture and culture. Hollywood movie stars vacationed in the area and industrialists built lavish homes. Miami's population multiplied fivefold, and Ft. Lauderdale and Palm Beach grew many times over as well. In 1925, Miami newspapers published editions weighing over , most of it real estate advertising.Grunwald, p. 179. Waterfront property was the most highly valued. Mangrove trees were cut down and replaced with palm trees to improve the view. Acres of south Florida slash pine were taken down, some for lumber, but the wood was found to be dense and it split apart when nails were driven into it. It was also termite-resistant, but homes were needed quickly. Most of the pine forests in Dade County were cleared for development.U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service. \\"South Florida Multi-Species Recovery Plan: Pine rockland\\", Retrieved May 3, 2008. Hurricanes The canals proposed by Wright were unsuccessful in making the lands south of Lake Okeechobee fulfill the promises made by real estate developers to local farmers. The winter of 1922 was unseasonably wet and the region was underwater. The town of Moore Haven received of rain in six weeks in 1924.Grunwald, p. 183. Engineers were pressured to regulate the water flow, not only for farmers but also for commercial fishers, who often requested conflicting water levels in the lake. Fred Elliot, who was in charge of building the canals after James Wright retired, commented: \\"A man on one side of the canal wants it raised for his particular use and a man on the other side wants it lowered for his particular use\\".Grunwald, p. 186. =1926 Miami Hurricane= Remains of a bridge damaged during the 1926 Miami Hurricane. The 1920s brought several favorable conditions that helped the land and population boom, one of which was an absence of any severe storms. The last severe hurricane, in 1906, had struck the Florida Keys. Many homes were constructed hastily and poorly as a result of this lull in storms.Steinberg, Theodore (October 1997). \\"Do-It-Yourself Deathscape: The Unnatural History of Natural Disaster in South Florida\\", Environmental History, 2 (4), p. 414‚Äì438. However, on September 18, 1926, a storm that became known as the 1926 Miami Hurricane struck with winds over , and caused massive devastation. The storm surge was as high as in some places. Henry Flagler's opulent Royal Palm Hotel was destroyed along with many other hotels and buildings. Most people who died did so when they ran out into the street in disbelief while the eye of the hurricane passed over, not knowing the wind was coming in from the other direction. \\"The lull lasted 35 minutes, and during that time the streets of the city became crowded with people\\", wrote Richard Gray, the local weather chief. \\"As a result, many lives were lost during the second phase of the storm.\\"Melzer, Martin (September 17, 2006). \\"On the 80th Anniversary of Disastrous 1926 Hurricane, Forecasters Sound the Alarm: It Will Happen Again\\", The Miami Herald. In Miami alone, 115 people were counted dead‚Äîalthough the true figure may have been as high as 175, because death totals were racially segregated. More than 25,000 people were homeless in the city. The town of Moore Haven, bordering Lake Okeechobee, was hardest hit. A levee built of muck collapsed, drowning almost 400 of the town's entire 1,200 residents.Grunwald, p. 188. The tops of Lake Okeechobee levees were only above the lake itself and the engineers were aware of the danger. Two days before the hurricane, an engineer predicted, \\"[i]f we have a blow, even a gale, Moore Haven is going under water\\". The engineer lost his wife and daughter in the flood.McCally, p. 134. Okeechobee in 1928 The City of Miami responded to the hurricane by downplaying its effects and turning down aid. The Miami Herald declared two weeks after the storm that almost everything in the city had returned to normal. The governor supported the efforts to minimize the appearance of the destruction by refusing to call a special legislative session to appropriate emergency funds for relief. As a result, the American Red Cross was able to collect only $3 million of $5 million needed. The 1926 hurricane effectively ended the land boom in Miami, despite the attempts at hiding the effects. It also forced drainage commissioners to re-evaluate the effectiveness of the canals. A $20 million plan to build a dike around Lake Okeechobee, to be paid by property taxes, was turned down after a skeptical constituency sued to stop it;McCally, p. 140. more than $14 million had been spent on canals and they were ineffective in taking away excess water or delivering it when needed.Douglas, p. 342. =1928 Okeechobee Hurricane= The weather was unremarkable for two years. In 1928, construction was completed on the Tamiami Trail, named because it was the only road spanning between Tampa and Miami. The builders attempted to construct the road several times before they blasted the muck down to the limestone, filled it with rock and paved over it.Douglas, p. 344. Hard rains in the summer caused Lake Okeechobee to rise several feet; this was noticed by a local newspaper editor who demanded it be lowered. However, on September 16, 1928 came a massive storm, now known as the 1928 Okeechobee Hurricane. Thousands drowned when Lake Okeechobee breached its levees; the range of estimates of the dead spanned from 1,770 (according to the Red Cross) to 3,000 or more. Many were swept away and never recovered.Douglas, p. 346. The majority of the dead were black migrant workers who had recently settled in or near Belle Glade. The catastrophe made national news, and although the governor again refused aid, after he toured the area and counted 126 bodies still unburied or uncollected a week after the storm, he activated the National Guard to assist in the cleanup, and declared in a telegram: \\"Without exaggeration, the situation in the storm area beggars description\\".Grunwald, p. 194. =Herbert Hoover Dike= A sign advertising the completion of the Herbert Hoover Dike The focus of government agencies quickly shifted to the control of floods rather than drainage. The Okeechobee Flood Control District, financed by both state and federal funds, was created in 1929. President Herbert Hoover toured the towns affected by the 1928 Okeechobee Hurricane and, an engineer himself, ordered the Army Corps of Engineers to assist the communities surrounding the lake.Grunwald, p. 198‚Äì199. Between 1930 and 1937, a dike long was built around the southern edge of the lake, and a shorter one around the northern edge. It was tall and thick on the lake side, thick on the top, and thick toward land. Control of the Hoover Dike and the waters of Lake Okeechobee were delegated to federal powers: the United States declared legal limits of the lake to be and . A massive canal wide and deep was also dug through the Caloosahatchee River; when the lake rose too high, the excess water left through the canal to the Gulf of Mexico. Exotic trees were planted along the north shore levee: Australian pines, Australian oaks, willows, and bamboo. More than $20 million was spent on the entire project. Sugarcane production soared after the dike and canal were built. The populations of the small towns surrounding the lake jumped from 3,000 to 9,000 after World War II.Grunwald, p. 199‚Äì200. Drought The effects of the Hoover Dike were seen immediately. An extended drought occurred in the 1930s, and with the wall preventing water leaving Lake Okeechobee and canals and ditches removing other water, the Everglades became parched. Peat turned to dust, and salty ocean water entered Miami's wells. When the city brought in an expert to investigate, he discovered that the water in the Everglades was the area's groundwater‚Äîhere, it appeared on the surface. Draining the Everglades removed this groundwater, which was replaced by ocean water seeping into the area's wells.McCally, p. 9. In 1939, of Everglades burned, and the black clouds of peat and sawgrass fires hung over Miami. Underground peat fires burned roots of trees and plants without burning the plants in some places.McCally, p. 142. Scientists who took soil samples before draining had not taken into account that the organic composition of peat and muck in the Everglades was mixed with bacteria that added little to the process of decomposition underwater because they were not mixed with oxygen. As soon as the water was drained and oxygen mixed with the soil, the bacteria began to break down the soil. In some places, homes had to be moved on to stilts and of topsoil was lost.Lodge, p. 38. =Conservation attempts= President Harry Truman dedicating Everglades National Park on December 6, 1947 Conservationists concerned about the Everglades have been a vocal minority ever since Miami was a young city. South Florida's first and perhaps most enthusiastic naturalist was Charles Torrey Simpson, who retired from the Smithsonian Institution to Miami in 1905 when he was 53. Nicknamed \\"the Sage of Biscayne Bay\\", Simpson wrote several books about tropical plant life around Miami. His backyard contained a tropical hardwood hammock, which he estimated he showed to about 50,000 people. Though he tended to avoid controversy regarding development, in Ornamental Gardening in Florida he wrote, \\"Mankind everywhere has an insane desire to waste and destroy the good and beautiful things this nature has lavished upon him\\".La Plante, Leah (1995), \\"The Sage of Biscayne Bay: Charles Torrey Simpson's Love Affair with South Florida\\", Tequesta, no. 55, p. 61‚Äì82. Although the idea of protecting a portion of the Everglades arose in 1905, a crystallized effort was formed in 1928 when Miami landscape designer Ernest F. Coe established the Everglades Tropical National Park Association. It had enough support to be declared a national park by Congress in 1934, but there was not enough money during the Great Depression to buy the proposed for the park. It took another 13 years for it to be dedicated on December 6, 1947. One month before the dedication of the park, the former editor of The Miami Herald and freelance writer Marjory Stoneman Douglas published her first book, The Everglades: River of Grass. After researching the region for five years, she described the history and ecology of the south of Florida in great detail, characterizing the Everglades as a river instead of a stagnant swamp.Davis, Jack (Summer 2001). \\"Green awakening: Social Activism and the Evolution of Marjory Stoneman Douglas's Environmental Consciousness\\", The Florida Historical Quarterly, 80 (1), p. 43‚Äì77. Douglas later wrote, \\"My colleague Art Marshall said that with [the words \\"River of Grass\\"] I changed everybody's knowledge and educated the world as to what the Everglades meant\\".Douglas (1987), p. 191. The last chapter was titled \\"The Eleventh Hour\\" and warned that the Everglades were approaching death, although the course could be reversed.Douglas, p. 349. Its first printing sold out a month after its release.Davis, Jack (January 2003). \\"'Conservation Is Now a Dead Word': Marjory Stoneman Douglas and the Transformation of American Environmentalism.\\" Environmental History 8 (1) p. 53‚Äì76. Flood control Coinciding with the dedication of Everglades National Park, 1947 in south Florida saw two hurricanes and a wet season responsible for of rain, ending the decade-long drought. Although there were no human casualties, cattle and deer were drowned and standing water was left in suburban areas for months. Agricultural interests lost about $59 million. The embattled head of the Everglades Drainage District carried a gun for protection after being threatened.Grunwald, p. 219. =Central and Southern Florida Flood Control Project= In 1948 Congress approved the Central and Southern Florida Project for Flood Control and Other Purposes (C&SF;) and consolidated the Everglades Drainage District and the Okeechobee Flood Control District under this.Light, Stephen, J. Walter Dineen, \\"Water Control in the Everglades: A Historical Perspective\\" in Everglades: The Ecosystem and its Restoration, Steven Davis and John Ogden, eds. (1994), Delray Beach, Fla.: St. Lucie Press. The C&SF; used four methods in flood management: levees, water storage areas, canal improvements, and large pumps to assist gravity. Between 1952 and 1954 in cooperation with the state of Florida it built a levee long between the eastern Everglades and suburbs from Palm Beach to Homestead, and blocked the flow of water into populated areas.\\"Florida Builds a 100 Mile Wall.\\" Popular Mechanics (Hearst Magazines), January 1953, pp. 160-163/274. Between 1954 and 1963 it divided the Everglades into basins. In the northern Everglades were Water Conservation Areas (WCAs), and the Everglades Agricultural Area (EAA) bordering to the south of Lake Okeechobee. In the southern Everglades was Everglades National Park. Levees and pumping stations bordered each WCA, which released water in drier times and removed it and pumped it to the ocean or Gulf of Mexico in times of flood. The WCAs took up about 37 percent of the original Everglades.Lodge, p. 224. During the 1950s and 1960s the South Florida metropolitan area grew four times as fast as the rest of the nation. Between 1940 and 1965, 6 million people moved to south Florida: 1,000 people moved to Miami every week.Grunwald, p. 229. Urban development between the mid-1950s and the late 1960s quadrupled. Much of the water reclaimed from the Everglades was sent to newly developed areas.Caulfield, p. 55. With metropolitan growth came urban problems associated with rapid expansion: traffic jams; school overcrowding; crime; overloaded sewage treatment plants; and, for the first time in south Florida's urban history, water shortages in times of drought.Carter, Luther (June 4, 1976). \\"Dade County: The Politics of Managing Urban Growth\\", Science, 192 (4243), p. 982‚Äì985. The C&SF; constructed over of canals, and hundreds of pumping stations and levees within three decades. It produced a film, Waters of Destiny, characterized by author Michael Grunwald as propaganda, that likened nature to a villainous, shrieking force of rage and declared the C&SF;'s mission was to tame nature and make the Everglades useful.Grunwald, p. 220‚Äì221. Everglades National Park management and Marjory Stoneman Douglas initially supported the C&SF;, as it promised to maintain the Everglades and manage the water responsibly. However, an early report by the project reflected local attitudes about the Everglades as a priority to people in nearby developed areas: \\"The aesthetic appeal of the Park can never be as strong as the demands of home and livelihood. The manatee and the orchid mean something to people in an abstract way, but the former cannot line their purse, nor the latter fill their empty bellies.\\"Grunwald, p. 226. Establishment of the C&SF; made Everglades National Park completely dependent upon another political entity for its survival.Gimour, Robert, et al. (Winter 1975‚Äì1976). \\"Environmental Preservation and Politics: The Significance of 'Everglades Jetport'\\", Political Science Quarterly, 90 (4), p. 719‚Äì738. One of the C&SF;'s projects was Levee 29, laid along the Tamiami Trail on the northern border of the park. Levee 29 featured four flood control gates that controlled all the water entering Everglades National Park; before construction, water flowed in through open drain pipes. The period from 1962 to 1965 was one of drought for the Everglades, and Levee 29 remained closed to allow the Biscayne Aquifer‚Äîthe fresh water source for South Florida‚Äîto stay filled.Caulfield, p. 53‚Äì54. Animals began to cross Tamiami Trail for the water held in WCA 3, and many were killed by cars. Biologists estimate the population of alligators in Everglades National Park was halved; otters nearly became extinct. The populations of wading birds had been reduced by 90 percent from the 1940s.Sklar, Fred, et al. (April, 2005). \\"The Ecological-Societal Underpinnings of Everglades Restoration\\", Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment, 3 (2), p. 161‚Äì169. When park management and the U.S. Department of the Interior asked the C&SF; for assistance, the C&SF; offered to build a levee along the southern border of Everglades National Park to retain waters that historically flowed through the mangroves and into Florida Bay. Though the C&SF; refused to send the park more water, they constructed Canal 67, bordering the east side of the park and carrying excess water from Lake Okeechobee to the Atlantic. =Everglades Agricultural Area= A 2003 U.S. Geological Survey photo showing the border between Water Conservation Area 3 (bottom) with water, and Everglades National Park, dry (top) The C&SF; established for the Everglades Agricultural Area‚Äî27 percent of the Everglades before development.Lodge, p. 223. In the late 1920s, agricultural experiments indicated that adding large amounts of manganese sulfate to Everglades muck produced profitable vegetable harvests. Adding of the compound was more cost effective than adding of manure.McCally, p. 159‚Äì160. The primary cash crop in the EAA is sugarcane, though sod, beans, lettuce, celery, and rice are also grown. Sugarcane became more consolidated an industry than did any other crop; in 1940 the coalition of farms was renamed U.S. Sugar and this produced 86 percent of Everglades sugar.McCally, p. 161. During the 1930s the sugarcane farmers' coalition came under investigation for labor practices that bordered on slavery. Potential employees‚Äîprimarily young black men‚Äîwere lured from all over the U.S. by the promise of jobs, but they were held financially responsible for training, transportation, room and board and other costs. Quitting while debts were owed was punishable with jail time. By 1942, U.S. Sugar was indicted for peonage in federal court, though the charges were eventually dismissed on a technicality. U.S. Sugar benefited significantly from the U.S. embargo on Cuban goods beginning in the early 1960s.Carter, p. 161. In 1958, before the Castro regime, of sugarcane were harvested in Florida; by the 1964‚Äì1965 season, were harvested. From 1959 to 1962 the region went from two sugar mills to six, one of which in Belle Glade set several world records for sugar production.Snyder G.H., J. Davidson, \\"Everglades Agriculture: Past, Present and Future\\" in Everglades: The Ecosystem and its Restoration, Steven Davis and John Ogden, eds. (1994), Delray Beach, Fla.: St. Lucie Press. Fields in the EAA are typically , on two sides bordered by canals that are connected to larger ones by which water is pumped in or out depending on the needs of the crops. The water level for sugarcane is ideally maintained at below the surface soil, and after the cane is harvested, the stalks are burned.Lodge, p. 225‚Äì226. Vegetables require more fertilizer than sugarcane, though the fields may resemble the historic hydrology of the Everglades by being flooded in the wet season. Sugarcane, however, requires water in the dry season. The fertilizers used on vegetables, along with high concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus that are the by-product of decayed soil necessary for sugarcane production, were pumped into WCAs south of the EAA, predominantly to Everglades National Park. The introduction of large amounts of these let exotic plants take hold in the Everglades.McCally, p. 172‚Äì173. One of the defining characteristics of natural Everglades ecology is its ability to support itself in a nutrient-poor environment, and the introduction of fertilizers began to change this ecology.Grunwald, p. 283‚Äì284. Turning point A turning point for development in the Everglades came in 1969 when a replacement airport was proposed as Miami International Airport outgrew its capacities. Developers began acquiring land, paying $180 an acre in 1968, and the Dade County Port Authority (DCPA) bought in the Big Cypress Swamp without consulting the C&SF;, management of Everglades National Park or the Department of the Interior. Park management learned of the official purchase and agreement to build the jetport from The Miami Herald the day it was announced. The DCPA bulldozed the land it had bought, and laid a single runway it declared was for training pilots. The new jetport was planned to be larger than O'Hare, Dulles, JFK, and LAX airports combined; the location chosen was north of the Everglades National Park, within WCA 3. The deputy director of the DCPA declared: \\"This is going to be one of the great population centers of America. We will do our best to meet our responsibilities and the responsibilities of all men to exercise dominion over the land, sea, and air above us as the higher order of man intends.\\"Caulfield, p. 61. The C&SF; brought the jetport proposal to national attention by mailing letters about it to 100 conservation groups in the U.S. Initial local press reaction condemned conservation groups who immediately opposed the project. Business Week reported real estate prices jumped from $200 to $800 an acre surrounding the planned location, and Life wrote of the expectations of the commercial interests in the area. The U.S. Geological Survey's study of the environmental impact of the jetport started, \\"Development of the proposed jetport and its attendant facilities ... will inexorably destroy the south Florida ecosystem and thus the Everglades National Park\\".Grunwald, p.257. The jetport was intended to support a community of a million people and employ 60,000. The DCPA director was reported in Time saying, \\"I'm more interested in people than alligators. This is the ideal place as far as aviation is concerned.\\" When studies indicated the proposed jetport would create of raw sewage a day and of jet engine pollutants a year, the national media snapped to attention. Science magazine wrote, in a series on environmental protection highlighting the jetport project, \\"Environmental scientists have become increasingly aware that, without careful planning, development of a region and the conservation of its natural resources do not go hand in hand\\".Mueller, Marti (October 10, 1969). \\"Everglades Jetport: Academy Prepares a Model\\", Science, New Series, 166 (3902), p. 202‚Äì203. The New York Times called it a \\"blueprint for disaster\\", and Wisconsin senator Gaylord Nelson wrote to President Richard Nixon voicing his opposition: \\"It is a test of whether or not we are really committed in this country to protecting our environment.\\" Governor Claude Kirk withdrew his support for the project, and the 78-year-old Marjory Stoneman Douglas was persuaded to go on tour to give hundreds of speeches against it. She established Friends of the Everglades and encouraged more than 3,000 members to join. Initially the U.S. Department of Transportation pledged funds to support the jetport, but after pressure, Nixon overruled the department. He instead established Big Cypress National Preserve, announcing it in the Special Message to the Congress Outlining the 1972 Environmental Program. Following the jetport proposition, restoration of the Everglades became not only a statewide priority, but an international one as well. In the 1970s the Everglades were declared an International Biosphere Reserve and a World Heritage Site by UNESCO, and a Wetland of International Importance by the Ramsar Convention, making it one of only three locations on earth that have appeared on all three lists.Maltby, E., P.J.

Whilst speaking English in its human incarnations, the Skriker‚Äôs own language consists of broken and fragmented word play. Blending naturalism, horror and magical realism, it is a story of love, loss and revenge. As with Churchill's A Mouthful of Birds (1986), the play explores the themes of post-natal psychosis and possession.  Performances  1996 American Debut at New York's Public Theater starring Jayne Atkinson, Caroline Seymour, Angie Phillips with Philip Seymour Hoffman and an ensemble cast.

In February 2012 the play was performed at Purchase College, SUNY directed by Genee Coreno. The play was staged in October, 2012, at the Erickson Theater in Seattle, WA. Produced and directed by Janice Findley, co-produced by Curtis Taylor, and choreographed by Pat Graney. The play was staged in July 2015 at The Royal Exchange in Manchester, England starring Maxine Peake.https://www.royalexchange.co.uk/whats-on-and-tickets/the-skriker Commissioned and produced by Manchester International Festival and the Royal Exchange Theatre, the production included Laura Elsworthy as Josie, Juma Sharkah as Lily. In December 2015 the Silver Spring, Maryland production company Welcome Homesick staged The Skriker in The Silver Spring Black Box Theater. The production was self-directed and starred Meg Lebow as Josie, Sophie Cameron as Lily, and Aziza Afzal, Emma Bergman, and Clare Lefebure as the Skriker.  Language  One of the play's most unusual features is its eponymous protagonist's language, Graham Wolfe has drawn connections with Lacan's lalangue, which Mladen Dolar defines as ‚Äúthe concept of what in language makes puns possible‚Äù:Dolar, Mladen. A Voice and Nothing More. Cambridge: MIT, 2006. \\"For all the Skriker‚Äôs monstrous malevolence, such an admirer of homonyms ('sham pain', 'morning becomes electric') could hardly scoff at Lacan, whose later seminars bear such titles as Les non-dupes errent (les nommes du p√®re) and Encore (en-corps, en coeur), confronting us with creatures named parl√™tre (par la lettre) and sinthome (symptom, synthetic homme, saint Thomas). Not even the Skriker‚Äôs wildest homonymic explosions ‚Äî 'no mistake no mister no missed her no mist no miss no me no' (9) ‚Äî are a match for some of Lacan‚Äôs most famous riffs: jouissance, j‚Äôou√Øs-sens, jouis- sens, jouis-sans . . .\\" (Wolfe 89).Wolfe, Graham. \\"Shapeshifting in Caryl Churchill's The Skriker\\". Journal of the Fantastic in the Arts 22.2 (2011): 234‚Äì256  Reception  When The Skriker opened at the National's Cottesloe Theatre, reviews were mixed. Jeremy Gerard of Variety lauded the play as \\"a major achievement and unlike anything else seen onstage this season [...] a truly original work\\". Gerard wrote that \\"Churchill gives the Skriker a kind of sing-song doggerel that is quite deceptive: Try to parse it and you‚Äôre lost; let it wash over you however, and you will be drawn inexorably into a world that turns every notion of home, safety and comfort inside out.\\" Ben Brantley of The New York Times argued that the playwright \\"intelligently keeps the line between victim and predator cloudy. The Skriker is a natural force corrupted by a denaturized world.\\" While describing the play as unwieldy, Brantley wrote that \\"like the best fairy tales, it directly addresses the darker passages of the unconscious.\\" Ralf Erik Remshardt of Theatre Journal wrote that the titular character's language contains \\"some of Churchill's most powerful and poetic writing\\". Marissa Oberlander of Chicago Reader agreed with 2012 director Eric Hoff that in the play \\"you find yourself facing your demons while they stare back at you. The skriker's Joycean babble is sometimes more rhythmic than coherent, but, paired with Myah Shein's sinister choreography, it certainly loosened my grasp on reality.\\" David Chadderton wrote that \\"for me the obscurity was a bit much to take in for a piece that ran a good quarter hour over the 1 hour 40 advertised time with no interval. While technically impressive, if you come out understanding more than half of the play, you've probably done better than me. And possibly than the playwright, if Wing-Davey is to be believed.\\" Jon Kaplan, who saw a 2014 production by Daniel Pagett, argued in Now that Churchill embeds a \\"bubbling pot of themes in language that's challenging, impressionistic and occasionally dense, using wit and associative wordplay to move the ideas forward.\\" While noting that the play is considered very difficult to stage, Kaplan wrote that Pagett \\"proves that in the right hands, it's one of her most theatrically exciting scripts.\\" Lisa Brock wrote in Star Tribune that the playwright creates a \\"richly textured language for the Skriker [...] a giddy piece of sinister nonsense.\\" In Ithaca Times, Ross Haarstad described the text as \\"threaded with deliciously impossible stage directions [...] that open up vistas of stage possibilities\\". Matt Roberts of Cherwell wrote, \\"I have known plays lapse into surrealism [...] and perhaps even sheer illogicalness, however it is rare for a play to do this as smartly, bitingly or frisson-inducing-ly as The Skriker\\". However, Roberts also argued that \\"the depiction of the reality within which this monster operated felt somewhat empty [...]. There was no effective change in the environment in which the action took place, and thus the play lacked the sense of a narrative thread ‚Äì it darted from emotion to emotion with great efficacy, but when it came to pushing home the actual changes in the lives of Allen and Redfern, I felt disconnected from their suffering and from their reality.\\" Susannah Clapp of The Guardian awarded Sarah Frankcom's 2015 production four out of five stars, praising the play as prescient and calling the titular character \\"one of the primary figures of modern theatre.\\" Clapp stated that the work feels like the godmother \\"of theatrical dystopias. Of dark fragmentary dramas, which dip in and out of underworlds\\", such as Simon Stephens' Carmen Disruption or Alistair McDowall's Pomona. Stephen Dalton of The Hollywood Reporter lauded the titular character as \\"a terrific creation [...] this densely layered staccato wordplay is a signature of Churchill's canon and always adheres to a loose narrative logic.\\" The critic also wrote, \\"Two decades on, The Skriker remains evasive and unwieldy as conventional drama, but still casts a powerful spell as a nightmarish fairy tale.\\" Natasha Tripney of The Stage awarded it four out of five stars in 2015, and the work was described as an \\"early classic\\" in Churchill's output by Time Out.

Following the reorganization of German football under the Third Reich in 1933, they became part of the Gauliga Schlesien, one of sixteen top flight regional divisions. In 1939 and from 1941 to 1945 the club appeared in the Gauliga Oberschlesien.Gr√ºne, Hardy (1996). Vom Kronprinzen bis zur Bundesliga. Kassel: AGON Sportverlag Over a dozen seasons VR fielded successful sides that captured divisional titles in 1935, 1936, 1938, 1939, and 1940 while finishing in second place in 1937 and 1941. That earned the club appearances in the national playoff rounds where they were each time put out in the early going with the exception of an advance to the semi-finals in 1936 where they dropped a 1:3 decision to Fortuna D√ºsseldorf. They lost the subsequent third place match 1:8 to Schalke 04 to finish fourth nationally. VR also took part in qualification round play for the Tschammerpokal, predecessor to today's DFB Pokal (German Cup) in each year from 1935 to 1941 with the exception of 1937. The team delivered a series of indifferent performances after a second-place finish in 1941. Part way through the 1944‚Äì45 season the Gauliga Oberschlesien collapsed as Soviet forces advanced into the area in as World War II was being fought to its conclusion. VR disappeared with the end of the war.

Gavreau was born in Russia. His interest in infrasonic waves first came about in his lab during the 1960s, when he and his lab assistants experienced pain in the ear drums and shaking lab equipment, but no audible sound was picked up on his microphones. He concluded that it was infrasound and got to work preparing tests in the labs. One of Gavreau's experiments involved an infrasonic whistle that some say has led to a line of research that has military applications. William S. Burroughs described the possibly fictional device as follows: :\\"In developing a military weapon, scientists intend to revert to a policeman's whistle form, perhaps as big as eighteen feet across, mount it on a truck and blow it with a fan turned by a small airplane engine. This weapon, they say, will give forth an all-destroying 10,000 acoustic watts. It could kill a man five miles away. There is one snag: at present, the machine is as dangerous to its operators as to the enemy. The team is working on a way to focus it. Various systems of baffles have been tried, but the most promising method appears to be propagation of a different and complementary sound a wave length backward from the machine. This changes the frequency of airwave length moving in that direction, thus protecting anyone to the rear. There is, of course, a much simpler means of protection: turn the machine on from a safe distance. This summary of Professor Vladimir Gavreau's experiments with infrasound is based on the Sunday Times article.Burroughs cites his source as Frank Dorsey, \\"Joshua Knew a Thing or Two,\\" Sunday Times, April 16, 1967. A much more comprehensive article has appeared in an American periodical, The National Enquirer, Vol.42, No. 27, March 10, 1968.

It features the work and lives of √©migr√© artists in London, and describes itself as \\"The Art Museum for Everyone\\". History The Ben Uri Art Society was founded in the East End of London in 1915 by the Russian emigre artist Lazar Berson to provide an art venue for Jewish immigrant craftsmen and artists then unable to gain access to mainstream artistic societies, due to traditional obstacles faced by all migrant minorities. Ben Uri was founded along the lines of the Bezalel School, created nine years earlier in 1906 in Jerusalem. It was named after Bezalel Ben Uri, the craftsman who designed and built the Ark of the Covenant. Between 1926 and 1933, the president of the Ben Uri Art Society was the Polish painter Leopold Pilichowski (1869‚Äì1934). Permanent collection In its permanent collection, Ben Uri has about 1,300 artworks, and is seeking a site in Central London to house and display them, but its present location is only large enough for temporary exhibitions including the series on the Whitechapel Boys; Cross Purposes, tracing the use of the Crucifixion motif during the 20th century and recent contemporary art; in June 2012 Dodo, re-discovering an artist from Berlin in the Weimar 1920s and 30s; followed in October by a survey of 40 years work by the American artist Judy Chicago. Recent exhibitions In response to the rapidly changing world, Ben Uri re-assessed its exhibition programme and committed to a series of exhibitions surveying the contribution and impact of refugees and immigrants to 20th and 21st-century British art. Firstly, the gallery assessed the impact of German refugees and immigrants. Refugees ‚Äì The Lives of Others, two exhibitions exploring the contribution of German refugee artists to 20th Century British Art, was the first part of the series. The exhibition included artworks from Ben Uri's collection partnered with works from the exhibition \\"Thirty Six Pounds and Ninety Five Pence\\" art produced during art therapy sessions at the New Art Studio by current refugees and asylum seekers through our Picturing Memories programme. The exhibition was dedicated to Eva Frankfurther. On 28 June 2017, Ben Uri Gallery opened the second exhibition in the series: Art Out of the Bloodlands: A Century of Polish Artists in Britain.

Common names  This flower has several common names, including but not limited to: Pipers buckwheat, Pipers golden buckwheat, Yellow umbrella plant,Neil L. Jennings and Pipers Wild Buckwheat.Flora of North America Editorial Committee (Editors) The species epithet flavum is Latin for yellow and indicates its flower colour.Sia Morhardt and Emil Morhardt  Description  Eriogonum flavum is a perennial herb from taproot and woody caudex that forms dense mats in small areas, with leafless stems approximately 5‚Äì20 cm high. The dark green, 2.5‚Äì7 cm long leaves are spatulate-oblanceolate with long petioles. The plant is greenish above, while heavily whitish-tomentose below. This perennial herb re- emerges from taproot and woody caudex, and is likely long lived. Flowers late May to mid July. The inflorescence is a dense umbel (umbrella shaped clusters,) with leaf like bracts at its base. There is one heavily villous involucre, roughly 5‚Äì6 mm high per ray of the umbel. The perianth is 4‚Äì6 mm long, very hairy, and typically pale yellow. it produces an aroma, that is unpleasant to humans but attracts pollinating bees. Roughly half of the viable population produce flowers in a given season, and seed are uncommon, further supporting longevity. Downhill transport of seeds is primary way of dispersal, but wind probably aids in dispersal uphill. However, downhill growth of caudex branches aids in vegetative dispersal. Fruit are 3‚Äì5 mm long three angled achenes that are sparsely pubescent at tip. \\"Inflorescences subcapitate or umbellate, 0.5-3(-5) √ó 0.3-2.5(-3) dm; branches tomentose to floccose; bracts 4-6, leaflike to semileaflike at proximal node, 0.5-2 √ó 0.2-0.5 cm, sometimes absent immediately below involucre. Involucres 1 per node, turbinate to campanulate, 3-9 √ó 2-5 mm, tomentose to floccose; teeth 5-8, erect, 0.2-1 mm. Flowers 3-7 mm, including 0.2-1.5 mm stipelike base; perianth pale to bright yellow, densely pubescent abaxially; tepals monomorphic, oblong; stamens exserted, 3-6 mm; filaments pilose proximally. Achenes light brown to brown, 3-5 mm, glabrous except for sparsely pubescent beak.\\"  Human and wildlife uses  The plant has been observed as browse for many species of animal, including deer, elk, horses, bighorn sheep and mountain goats which browse the umbels. Blue grouse consume the leaves, as well as insects. Plains tribes of Native Americans used the mashed roots of this plant as ear plugs, and the flowers as an additive for the tanning of buffalo hides. The roots were eaten by children as a sweet snack  Subspecies and varieties  There are three subspecies of this species, with subspecies piperi containing two varieties: # Subspecies flavum: A much grayer version of the species, with grayish leaves above and whitish leaves below. Typically found east of the Rocky Mountains. # Subspecies piperi var. linguifolium: Leaves greenish above, but involucres are less than 5mm long and with more bell shaped bases. The teeth are also longer, usually more than 0.5mm. Found west of the Rocky Mountains # Subspecies piperi var. piperi: Also green above, but the involucres are greater than 6mm, and the involucre teeth are generally shorter than 0.5mm. Also found west of the Rocky Mountains. # Subspecies aquilinum: The most northern representative of the species at large. 5-7mm long involucres, densely tomentose (especially on lower surfaces).  Habitat  This plant is generally found at moderate to high elevation, and grows on rocky open soils to ridges, or grasslands. Grows at 1,000 m in the Yukon, and as low as 170 m in Alaska, although the average throughout the southern portion of its range is around 2133.6 m. Associated with rock, scree, gravel, silt and loamy substrates. Usually associated with southern facing 20o to 50o slopes.  Distribution  This species of plant has a very extensive range, including most of the Pacific Northwest. It is found north to British Columbia, south to the Blue Mountains of Oregon and California, east to south central Idaho, Colorado, and southwestern Alberta. Subspecies aquilinum is found north to the eastern portions of Alaska and throughout British Columbia and the Yukon.

Companies are interested in understanding what their customers think about their shopping or purchase experience, because finding new customers is generally more costly and difficult than servicing existing or repeat customers. Types of research =Descriptive or documentary research= Many customer satisfaction studies are intentionally or unintentionally only descriptive in nature because they give a snapshot in time of customer attitudes. If the study instrument is administered to groups of customers periodically, then a descriptive picture of customer satisfaction through time can be developed (\\"tracking\\" or cohort study).http://www.jatit.org/volumes/Vol74No3/2Vol74No3.pdf =Inferential or models-based research= Beyond documentary types of work are studies that attempt to provide an understanding of why customers have the perceptions they do and what may be done to change those perceptions. While models-based studies also provide snapshots of customer attitudes, the results of these studies are more powerful because they present the firm with recommendations on how to improve customer satisfaction. Frequently, these studies also provide firms with a prioritization of the various recommended actions. Inferential studies can also be conducted as tracking studies. When this is done, the firm can gain insight into how the drivers of customer satisfaction are changing in addition to documenting the levels and areas of customer satisfaction. Methods Both quantitative studies and qualitative studies are critical to understanding customer satisfaction. =Quantitative research studies= Quantitative studies allow a firm to develop an understanding of the \\"big picture\\" of their customers' experiences based upon a relatively small number of interviews. This sample of the firm's customers must be carefully designed and drawn if the results of the study are to be considered representative of the customer population as a whole. In most cases, the results of quantitative studies are based upon the responses of a relatively large number of interviews. Depending upon the size of the population and the amount of segmentation desired, \\"large\\" can be as few as 50 responses or range from several hundred to thousands of interviews. Mail-based, telephone-based, and (more recently) Internet-based surveys and related customer data collection. =Qualitative research studies= Qualitative studies are used by firms to provide a more detailed and/or unconstrained understanding of customer experiences. In most cases, the results of qualitative studies are based upon dozens of interviews. Qualitative studies are not designed to provide insights that are projectable to the customer population: qualitative studies are used for initial exploration of experiences and topics or to probe more deeply the reasons behind customer perceptions. Focus groups (group depth interviews) and \\"one-on-ones\\" (individual depth interviews) are the common examples of qualitative studies.

The long unsigned highway serves Malott, a community in Okanogan County. Extending from (US 97) over the Okanogan River via a bridge to First Avenue in Malott, the roadway is semi-complete, as state law designates that the road should extend to southwest of Okanogan. First appearing in a map in 1954, SR 213 originated as a branch of (PSH 16) in 1959 and later SR 20 Spur in 1964. SR 20 Spur became SR 213 in 1973 because was recently established in Anacortes. Route description Looking northbound at the southern end of SR 213, where it begins at US 97 SR 213 originates at an intersection with (US 97) south of Malott. Traveling northwest and turning northeast, the unsigned roadway crosses the Cascade and Columbia River Railroad and the Okanogan River near the confluence of the Okanogan River and Loup Loup Creek. After crossing the Okanogan River, the highway enters Malott and terminates at First Avenue, although state law dictates that eventually the road will be extended to southwest of Okanogan.

In 1959, the Washington State Legislature passed a law that created a branch of (PSH 16) that extended from PSH 16 near Okanogan to US 97 in Malott to take effect on July 1, 1961. By 1963, US 97 was realigned south of the Okanogan River and the PSH 16 branch was extended across the river. During a highway renumbering in 1964, PSH 16 became and the branch of PSH 16 became SR 20 Spur. In 1973, SR 20 Spur became SR 213, while was established in Anacortes.

This gambit proved controversial, driving an attrition of 6 Music's long time listeners, provoking rival petitioning websites: and . Similarly, national media reviews were polarised. Radio veteran Paul Gambaccini said Lamb's interview with Ray Davies of The Kinks was \\"worst interview in the history of broadcasting\\". In May 2008 Lamb was reprimanded for pledging his support on air for Boris Johnson in the London mayoral race. In 2014, he criticised the BBC, claiming \\"You can't have opinions at the Beeb\\".

Analytical skill consists of categories that include logical reasoning, critical thinking, communication, research, data analysis and creativity. Analytical skill is taught in contemporary education with the intention of fostering the appropriate practises for future professions. The professions that adopt analytical skill include educational institutions, public institutions, community organisations and industry. Richard J. Heuer Jr. explained that 'Thinking analytically is a skill like carpentry or driving a car. It can be taught, it can be learned, and it can improve with practice. But like many other skills, such as riding a bike, it is not learned by sitting in a classroom and being told how to do it. Analysts learn by doing.'.‚ÄúPsychology of Intelligence Analysis‚Äù, Richard J. Heuer Jr, published by \\"Center for the Study of Intelligence\\", 1999, In the article by Freed, the need for programs within the educational system to help students develop these skills is demonstrated. According to scholars, workers 'will need more than elementary basic skills to maintain the standard of living of their parents. They will have to think for a living, analyse problems and solutions, and work cooperatively in teams'.  Logical Reasoning  Logical reasoning is a process consisting of inferences, where premises and hypotheses are formulated to arrive at a probable conclusion. It is a broad term covering three sub-classifications in deductive reasoning, inductive reasoning and abductive reasoning. = Deductive Reasoning = ‚ÄòDeductive reasoning is a basic form of valid reasoning, commencing with a general statement or hypothesis, then examines the possibilities to reach a specific, logical conclusion‚Äô. This scientific method utilises deductions, to test hypotheses and theories, to predict if possible observations were correct. A logical deductive reasoning sequence can be executed by establishing: an assumption, followed by another assumption and finally, conducting an inference. For example, ‚ÄòAll men are mortal. Harold is a man. Therefore, Harold is mortal.‚Äô For deductive reasoning to be upheld, the hypothesis must be correct, therefore, reinforcing the notion that the conclusion is logical and true. It is possible for deductive reasoning conclusions to be inaccurate or incorrect entirely, but the reasoning and premise is logical. For example, ‚ÄòAll bald men are grandfathers. Harold is bald. Therefore, Harold is a grandfather.‚Äô is a valid and logical conclusion but it is not true as the original assumption is incorrect. Deductive reasoning is an analytical skill used in many professions such as management, as the management team delegates tasks for day-to-day business operations. = Inductive Reasoning = Inductive reasoning compiles information and data to establish a general assumption that is suitable to the situation. Inductive reasoning commences with an assumption based on faithful data, leading to a generalised conclusion. For example, ‚ÄòAll the swans I have seen are white. (Premise) Therefore all swans are white. (Conclusion)‚Äô. It is clear that the conclusion is incorrect, therefore, it is a weak argument. To strengthen the conclusion, it is made more probable, for example, ‚ÄòAll the swans I have seen are white. (Premise) Therefore most swans are probably white (Conclusion)‚Äô. Inductive reasoning is an analytical skill common in many professions such as the corporate environment, where statistics and data are constantly analysed. Doctor using abductive reasoning to diagnose a man with diabetes  The 6 types of inductive reasoning  # Generalised: This manner utilises a premise on a sample set to extract a conclusion about a population. # Statistical: This is a method that utilises statistics based on a large and viable random sample set that is quantifiable to strengthen conclusions and observations. # Bayesian: This form adapts statistical reasoning to account for additional or new data. # Analogical: This is a method that records on the foundations of shared properties between two groups, leading to a conclusion that they are also likely to share further properties. # Predictive: This form of reasoning extrapolates a conclusion about the future based on a current or past sample. # Causal inference: This method of reasoning is formed around a causal link between the premise and the conclusion. = Abductive reasoning = Abductive reasoning commences with layered hypotheses, which may be insufficient with evidence, leading to a conclusion that is most likely explanatory for the problem. It is a form of reasoning where the conductor chooses a hypothesis that would best suit the given data. For example, when a patient is ill, the doctor gathers a hypothesis from the patient's symptoms, or other evidence, that they deem factual and appropriate. The doctor will then go through a list of possible illnesses and will attempt to assign the appropriate illness. Abductive reasoning is characterised by its lack of completeness, in evidence, explanation or both. This form of reasoning can be creative, intuitive and revolutionary due to its instinctive design.  Critical Thinking  Critical thinking is an analytical skill that involves clear, purposeful, and goal-directed thinking. It is used to interpret and explain the data given. It is the ability to think cautiously and rationally to resolve problems. This goal-directed thinking is achieved by supporting conclusions without biases, having reliable evidence and reasoning, and using appropriate data and information.https://secure.byui.edu/cas/login?service=https%3A%2F%2Fsecure.byui.edu%2Fcas%2Fidp%2Fprofile%2FSAML2%2FCallback%3FentityId%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fbyui.idm.oclc.org%252FShibboleth%26SAMLRequest%3DPD94bWwgdmVyc2lvbj0iMS4wIiBlbmNvZGluZz0iVVRGLTgiPz48c2FtbHA6QXV0aG5SZXF1ZXN0IHhtbG5zOnNhbWxwPSJ1cm46b2FzaXM6bmFtZXM6dGM6U0FNTDoyLjA6cHJvdG9jb2wiIERlc3RpbmF0aW9uPSJodHRwczovL3NlY3VyZS5ieXVpLmVkdS9jYXMvaWRwL3Byb2ZpbGUvU0FNTDIvUmVkaXJlY3QvU1NPIiBJRD0iXzE1ODU4NDAwNDEzMzg0NjMiIElzc3VlSW5zdGFudD0iMjAyMC0wNC0wMlQxNTowNzoyMVoiIFZlcnNpb249IjIuMCI%252BPHNhbWw6SXNzdWVyIHhtbG5zOnNhbWw9InVybjpvYXNpczpuYW1lczp0YzpTQU1MOjIuMDphc3NlcnRpb24iPmh0dHBzOi8vYnl1aS5pZG0ub2NsYy5vcmcvU2hpYmJvbGV0aDwvc2FtbDpJc3N1ZXI%252BPHNhbWxwOk5hbWVJRFBvbGljeSBBbGxvd0NyZWF0ZT0iMSIvPjwvc2FtbHA6QXV0aG5SZXF1ZXN0Pg%253D%253D%26RelayState%3Dezp.2aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rLmdhbGUuY29tL2FwcHMvZG9jL0NYNzQyMzUwMDE4NC9HVlJMP3U9Ynl1aWRhaG8mc2lkPUdWUkwmeGlkPWY1OWU1MWNh Critical thinking is an imperative analytical skill as it underpins contemporary living in areas such as education and professional careers, but it is not restricted to a specific area. Critical thinking is used to solve problems, calculate the likelihood, make decisions, and formulate inferences. Critical thinking requires examining information, reflective thinking, using appropriate skills, and confidence in the quality of the information given to come to a conclusion or plan. Critical thinking includes being willing to change if better information becomes available. As a critical thinker individuals do not accept assumptions without further questioning the reliability of it with further research and analysing the results found. = Developing Critical Thinking = Critical thinking can be developed through establishing personal beliefs and values. It is critical that individuals are able to query authoritative bodies: teachers, specialists, textbooks, books, newspapers, television etc. Querying these authorities allow critical thinking ability to be developed as the individual gains their own freedom and wisdom to think about reality and contemporary society, revering from autonomy. = Developing Critical Thinking through Probability Models = Critical thinking can be developed through probability models, where individuals adhere to a logical, conceptual understanding of mathematics and emphasise investigation, problem-solving, mathematical literacy and the use of mathematical discourse. The student actively constructs their knowledge and understanding, while teaching models function as a mediator by actively testing the student through querying, challenging and assigning investigation tasks, ultimately, allowing the student to think in deeper ways about various concepts, ideas and mathematical contexts.  Communication  Communication is a process where individuals transfer information from one another. It is a complex system consisting of a listener interpreting the information, understanding it and then transferring it. Communication as an analytical skill includes communicating with confidence, clarity, and sticking with the point you are trying to communicate. It consists of verbal and non-verbal communication. Communication is an imperative component of analytical skill as it allows the individual to develop relationships, contribute to group decisions, organisational communication, and influence media and culture. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. providing a speech to 250,000 people during the Civil Rights March in Washington D.C. exemplifies verbal communication = Verbal Communication = Verbal communication is interaction through words in linguistic form. Verbal communication consists of oral communication, written communication and sign language. It is an effective form of communication as the individuals sending and receiving the information are physically present, allowing immediate responses. In this form of communication, the sender uses words, spoken or written, to express the message to the individuals receiving the information. Verbal communication is an essential analytical skill as it allows for the development of positive relationships among individuals. This positive relationship is attributed to the notion that verbal communication between individuals fosters a depth of understanding, empathy and versatility among them, providing each other with more attention. Verbal communication is a skill that is commonly used in professions such as the health sector, where healthcare workers are desired to possess strong interpersonal skills. Verbal communication has been linked to patient satisfaction. An effective strategy to improve verbal communication ability is through debating as is it fosters communication and critical thinking. = Non-verbal Communication = Non- verbal communication is commonly known as unspoken dialogue between individuals. It is a significant analytical skill as it allows individuals to distinguish true feelings, opinions and behaviours, as individuals are more likely to believe nonverbal cues as opposed to verbal expressions. Non-verbal communication is able to transcend communicational barriers such as race, ethnicity and sexual orientation. This is a significant factor for international industries that require global communication or communication between other regions such as trade between China and The United States of America. Dancing is a common expressionist form of human non-verbal communication Statistical measures showcase that the true meaning behind all messages is 93% non-verbal and 7% verbal. Non-verbal communication is a critical analytical skill as it allows individuals to delve deeper into the meaning of messages. It allows individuals to analyse another person's perceptions, expressions and social beliefs. Individuals who excel in communicating and understanding non-verbal communication are able to analyse the interconnectedness of mutualism, social beliefs and expectations. = Communication Theories = A communication theory is an abstract understanding of how information is transferred from individuals. Many communication theories have been developed to foster and build upon the ongoing dynamic nature of how people communicate. Early models of communication were simple, such as Aristotle's model of communication, consisting of a speaker communicating a speech to an audience, leading to an effect. This is a basic form of communication that addresses communication as a linear concept where information is not being relayed back. Modern theories for communication include Schramm's model where there are multiple individuals, each individual is encoding, interpreting and decoding the message, and messages are being transferred between one another. Schramm has included another factor in his model in experience i.e. expressing that each individual's experience influences their ability to interpret a message. Communication theories are constantly being developed to acclimatise to certain organisations or individuals. It is imperative for an individual to adopt a suitable communication theory for organisations to ensure that the organisation is able to function as desired. For example, traditional corporate hierarchy are commonly known to adopt a linear communicational model i.e. Aristotle's model of communication.  Research  Research is the construct of utilising tools and techniques to deconstruct and solve problems. While researching, it is important to distinguish what information is relevant to the data and avoiding excess, irrelevant data. Research involves the collection and analysis of information and data with the intention of founding new knowledge and/or deciphering a new understanding of existing data. Research ability is an analytical skill as it allows individuals to comprehend social implications. Research ability is valuable as it fosters transferable employment related skills. Research is primarily employed in academia and higher education, it is a profession pursued by many graduates, individuals intending to supervise or teach research students or those in pursuit of a PhD. = Research in Academia = In higher education, new research provides the most desired quality of evidence, if this is not available, then existing forms of evidence should be used. It is accepted that research provides the greatest form of knowledge, in the form of quantitative or qualitative data. Research students are highly desired by various industries due to their dynamic mental capacity. Research students are commonly sought after due to their analysis and problem-solving ability, interpersonal and leadership skills, project management and organisation, research and information management and written and oral communication.  Data Analysis  Data analysis is a systematic method of cleaning, transforming and modelling statistical or logical techniques to describe and evaluate data. Using data analysis as an analytical skill means being able to examine large volumes of data and then identifying trends within the data. It is critical to be able to look at the data and determine what information is important and should be kept and what information is irrelevant and can be discarded. Data analysis includes finding different patterns within the information which allows you to narrow your research and come to a better conclusion. It is a tool to discover and decipher useful information for business decision-making. It is imperative in inferring information from data and adhering to a conclusion or decision from that data. Data analysis can stem from past or future data. Data analysis is an analytical skill, commonly adopted in business, as it allows organisations to be come more efficient, internally and externally, solve complex problems and innovate. = Text Analysis = Text analysis is the discovery and understanding of valuable information in unstructured or large data. It is a method to transform raw data into business information, allowing for strategic business decisions by offering a method to extract and examine data, derive patterns and finally interpret the data. = Statistical Analysis = Statistical analysis involves the collection, analyses and presentation of data to decipher trends and patterns. It is common in research, industry and government to enhance the scientific aspects of the decision that needs to be made. It consists of descriptive analysis and inferential analysis.  Descriptive Analysis  Descriptive analysis provides information about a sample set that reflects the population by summarising relevant aspects of the dataset i.e. uncovering patterns. It displays the measures of central tendency and measures of spread, such as mean, deviation, proportion, frequency etc.  Inferential Analysis  Inferential analysis analyses a sample from complete data to compare the difference between treatment groups. Multiple conclusions are constructed by selecting different samples. Inferential analysis can provide evidence that, with a certain percentage of confidence, there is a relationship between two variables. It is adopted that the sample will be different to the population, thus, we further accept a degree of uncertainty. Example of sales forecasting, a form of predictive analysis = Diagnostic Analysis = Diagnostic analysis showcases the origin of the problem by finding the cause from the insight found in statistical analysis. This form of analysis is useful to identify behavioural patterns of data. = Predictive Analysis = Predictive analysis is an advanced form of analytics that forecasts future activity, behaviour, trends and patterns from new and historical data. Its accuracy is based on how much faithful data is present and the degree of inference that can be exploited from it. = Prescriptive Analysis = Prescriptive analytics provide firms with optimal recommendations to solve complex decisions. It is used in many industries, such as aviation to optimise schedule selection for airline crew.  Creativity  Areas of the brain that stimulated during actions of creativity Creativity is important when it comes to solving different problems when presented. Creative thinking works best for problems that can have multiple solutions to solve the problem. It is also used when there seems to be no correct answer that applies to every situation, and is instead based from situation to situation. It includes being able to put the pieces of a problem together, as well as figure out pieces that may be missing. Then it includes brainstorming with all the pieces and deciding what pieces are important and what pieces can be discarded. The next step would be now analysing the pieces found to be of worth and importance and using those to come to a logical conclusion on how to best solve the problem. There can be multiple answers you come across to solve this problem. Many times creative thinking is referred to as right brain thinking. Creativity is an analytical skill as it allows individuals to utilise innovative methods to solve problems. Individuals that adopt this analytical skill are able to perceive problems from varying perspectives. This analytical skill is highly transferable among professions.

World Publishing) \\"The Man Who Was Almost a Man\\", also known as \\"Almos' a Man\\", is a short story by Richard Wright. It was published in 1961 as part of Wright's compilation Eight Men. The story centers on Dave, a young African- American farm worker who is struggling to declare his identity in the atmosphere of the rural South. The story was adapted into a 1976 film starring LeVar Burton. Plot summary The story begins with the protagonist Dave Sanders walking home from work, irritated with the way he has been treated. Dave works for a farmer on a cattle farm and as he walks across the fields he begins thinking of ways that will prove to the other workers that he is a grown up. He decides that the perfect way to prove that he is a grown up is to purchase a gun. Instead of going home, he goes over to a local store to have a look at the guns in a Sears Roebuck catalog. When he enters into the store, Dave encounters the owner Fat Joe. Dave requests the catalog, leading Joe to ask him if he is planning on buying something. Dave responds with a ‚Äúyessuh,‚Äù so Joe then inquires whether or not Dave's ma is letting him have his own money now, to which Dave responds with a ‚Äú[s]hucks. Mistah Joe, Ahm gittin t' be a man like anybody else,‚Äù! Joe asks what exactly it is Dave is planning on buying; a question Dave is reluctant to answer unless Joe promises not to say anything. Joe promises and Dave tells him he's looking to purchase a cannon ball; Joe states that Dave ‚Äúain‚Äôt nothing but a boy,‚Äù and that he does not need a gun, but if he's going to buy one he might as well buy it from him and not from some catalog. Joe offers to sell Dave a left-hand Wheeler, fully loaded and in working order for only two dollars if he can get the money from his ma. With his excitement and interest aroused, Dave leaves the store vowing to come back for the gun later. When he gets home his mother awaits him, irritated because he has kept supper waiting. Dave sits down at the table with the borrowed catalog until his mother takes it from him, threatening to make it outhouse material if he does not get up and wash. After explaining that it was not his she gives it back to him only to have him fumble through it all throughout dinner. Dave was so infatuated with the catalog that he did not even notice his food was in front of him, or that his father had spoken to him. He determines that if he was going to get the pistol that he had better ask his mother for the money and not his father because his father would instantaneously say no, whereas his mother might be a little easier to persuade. Upon the completion of supper, Dave finally builds up enough tenacity to approach his mother with his inquiry. He starts the conversation by asking if his boss, Mr. Hawkins, had paid her for the work he had accomplished on the plantation. His mother responds that she has received the money but that it was to be saved in order to buy clothes for the winter. Dave presents to her his proposition and she responds by saying, ‚Äú[g]it outta here! Don yuh talk t' me bout no gun! Yuh a fool!\\" Dave persuades her by stating that the family needs a gun, and that if he bought it he would surrender it to his father. Despite her better judgment, Mrs. Sanders agrees to give Dave the two dollars he needs as long as he promises that as soon as the pistol is in his possession he will bring it straight home and turn it over to her. Dave runs out the door with the money and purchases the pistol from Joe. On his way home he stops in the fields to play with the gun, only he is unsure of how to use it so he just points and pretends to be shooting imaginary objects. When he arrives at his house he breaks his promise and does not surrender the gun, instead he hides it under his pillow, and when his mother comes to retrieve it he claims to have hidden it outside. Dave wakes and with the gun in his hands thinks to himself that he now has the power to ‚Äúkill anybody, black or white.‚Äù He ties the pistol to his leg with a piece of flannel and leaves the house early so he can go unnoticed and not have to give up the gun. Dave arrives at work early so Mr. Hawkins tells him to hook up Jenny, the mule, and go plow the fields located near the woods. Dave is delighted with the request because it meant he would be so far away from everyone else that he could practice his shooting and no one would hear. When he gets out to the woods, Dave plows two rows then takes his gun out to show Jenny, he waves the gun around then closes his eyes and take his first shot. The gun flies back in Dave's hand and scares away the mule. When he catches up to her he realizes that Jenny has been shot and he tries repeatedly to plug the hole with handfuls of ‚Äúdamp black earth.‚Äù Jenny eventually dies. By sunset Jenny's body is found and Dave is questioned by both his parents and Mr. Hawkins about what happened. Dave lies about the incident stating that something was wrong with Jenny causing her to fall on the point of the plow. His mother knows this is a lie and insist Dave tell the truth. In tears, Dave confesses, but lies yet again when asked what he has done with the gun. Mr. Hawkins tells Dave that although it was an accident he will pay two dollars a month until he has paid fifty dollars to replace the mule. That night Dave feels annoyed at having to pay back Mr. Hawkins for the next two years, and even more annoyed with the fact that people view him as a child more now than ever before. He decides to leave his house and retrieve the gun in which he had buried, not thrown in a river like he claimed. He forces himself to fire the gun with his eyes open until he empties it. In the distance, Dave hears a train, which he approaches and hops in the hopes that this will at last prove he is indeed a man. Characters *Dave Saunders (protagonist): Dave Saunders, a young African American male, works the duration of his summer vacation plowing fields on a plantation. Trapped in the years of adolescence, Dave has a hard time convincing those around him that they should view and treat him as a man instead of a boy. In order to clear up any confusion as to what age group he belongs, Dave comes to the conclusion that purchasing a gun will solve all of his problems and at last allow him to be treated in the manner in which he desires. However, Dave's plan backfires on him inflicting self humiliation and exposing his immaturity all while blowing any possibility of gaining respect from his elders. *Mr. Saunders (Pa): Mr. Saunders for the most part is a ‚Äúphantom figure\\", but when actually present in the story serves as the stern disciplinary of the family. He does not tolerate any nonsense and cares only that Dave gets along with his boss and earns his keep. When he discovers that his son has gone behind his back and purchased a gun that caused havoc at work, he deals with the situation by first smoothing things over with Dave's boss, and then addresses his Dave with a threat showing that his son does not take priority over business. *Mrs. Saunders (Ma): Mrs. Saunders, unlike her husband, lies at the opposite end of the disciplinary spectrum in that she is an understanding, less demanding woman. Dave approaches her with the proposition of owning a gun because he knows she will be more likely to consider it than his father and is easier to persuade. Mrs. Saunders hesitates to agree to Dave's proposition because she feels the money could be put to better use, but eventually gives in to him causing her to go against what she knows is right for the sake of her sons happiness. *Fat Joe: Fat Joe owns the local store in which Dave goes to for the Sears Roebuck catalog. He allows Dave to borrow the catalog for the night but states that he feels Dave is ‚Äúnothing but a boy,‚Äù and therefore does not need a gun. Despite his statement that Dave does not need a gun due to his age, Joe suggests that if Dave was going to purchase a gun that he should purchase one from him. He presents Dave with a loaded left-hand Wheeler, selling it to him for just two dollars. *Jim Hawkins: Jim employs Dave and owns the plantation that he works on. When Dave wreaks havoc in the fields Mr. Hawkins does not take his job from him or threaten him in any way, but instead comes up with a fair payment plan for Dave to follow in order to undo the damage he had done, showing that he is a rather reasonable man. However, despite his kindness towards him Dave still resents Mr. Hawkins and the supremacy he possesses. *Jenny: Jenny the mule, owned by Jim Hawkins, works alongside Dave in the fields of the plantation. One day while on the outskirts of the woods with Dave, Jenny suffers an accidental injury and eventually dies a slow crimson death due to a gunshot wound inflicted by none other than Dave himself. Analysis While the story appears to be simply about a young boy's desire to have a gun, Wright's work includes underlying themes of racism and the struggles of an individual. This piece is filled with metaphors for life and the journey from boyhood to manhood. The story is set in a farming area. Wright never gets into much detail about the surrounding area other than to mention that the main character, Dave, is working or walking through a field. This desolate sort of background that sets the stage for the story can be viewed as a way to get readers to focus more on the imagery of the gun. Wright's contemporary, James Baldwin said that his \\"unrelenting bleak landscape\\" was a picture of \\"the world, [and] of the human heart\\". Wright intentionally used his setting to mirror the emptiness and the search for meaning in the life of his characters, and in this particular story, the life of Dave. The issue of racism plays an important role in this story as well. Dave is a young African American boy working for Jim Hawkins, a white farm owner. After Dave shoots \\"Jenny\\" the mule, Wright makes a point to say that \\"There were white and black standing in the crowd\\" and Dave \\"cried, seeing blurred white and black faces\\". So, not only does the issue of the dead animal become a concern, but the colors of the people around Dave become important as well. The gun becomes an equalizer in Dave's eyes when he says \\"Could kill a man with a gun like this. Kill anybody, black or white. And if he were holding his gun in his hand, nobody could run over him; they would have to respect him.\\" The gun blurs the color line and all Dave can see is the prospect of having others respect him. When it comes down to it, Dave is bound to his debt and has no choice but to pay Jim Hawkins. The mention of skin color makes this about more than just that debt, but about the ideas of bondage. Symbolism The Gun: The gun symbolizes several things in the eyes of Dave from the achievement of power or control, to independence, and the desire of masculinity, while in reality it symbolizes his struggle and failure to achieve such aspirations. ‚ÄúDave felt he wasn‚Äôt a man without a gun,‚Äù on his way home from work he struggles with finding a way to prove to everyone that he was no longer a boy, feeling that the buying of a gun was the only way to get his point across to those who have been doubting him. In purchasing the gun Dave feels he has acquired masculinity, giving him a newfound sense of independence. With the gun Dave feels invincible, like no one can pass judgment upon him, tell him what to do, or harm him in any way. In the scene in which Dave kills Jenny, Dave exposes his immaturity and lack of control by misusing the weapon. Usually a boy kills an animal on an early morning hunting trip as a right of passage; Dave's kill however, was a result of him ‚Äúsneaking his gun along with him into the field he is supposed to plow for his boss,‚Äù much like a child would do. His misuse of the gun and the killing of the mule demonstrated to those around him that he was in fact still an irresponsible boy. The gun was supposed to have made him an independent masculine individual but in reality it simply symbolized his struggle to achieve such goals. Notes References *Baym, Nina, ed..

The highway would begin at a junction with concurrent highways Interstate 90 (I-90) and U.S. Route 395 (US 395) in Ritzville and travel east to an intersection with SR 23 in Ewan. Plans for the first highway first emerged in 1945, to be studied after the conclusion of World War II, however no action has been taken on construction of the highway. Route description The highway is legislated to begin in Ritzville at a junction with concurrent highways I-90 and US 395 and travel east through a mixture of farm and desert landscapes, crossing over the Adams‚ÄìWhitman county line in the process. A junction with SR 23 near Ewan is to be the eastern terminus of the highway. Currently travelers wishing to travel between the two communities take the freeway to Sprague, then head southeast along SR 23. History The highway was first proposed in 1945, with the support of the Ritzville Chamber of Commerce and senator Elmer C. Huntley of Colfax. An earmark of just over $1.5 million (equivalent to $ in ) was set aside for the project to be used after the war. The proposed highway's designation was changed to the current designator, SR 230, after the 1964 state highway renumbering. The legal definition of SR 23, the highway's proposed eastern terminus, was changed during the 1987 legislative session to remove a reference of a junction with SR 230.

The synagogue is the oldest synagogue building in Australia and is a rare example of the Egyptian Revival style of synagogue architecture. The Egyptian Revival building was constructed in 1845. The trapezoidal shape of the windows and the columns with lotus capitals are characteristic of the Egyptian Revival style. Currently the Hobart Synagogue has regular services by both Orthodox and Progressive groups. The land on which the synagogue stands was originally part of the garden of former convict Judah Solomon. It has a seating capacity of 150 and features hard benches at the back of the building for the Jewish convicts who in the early days were marched in under armed guard.Hobart - high on the list Down Under The synagogue is listed on the Tasmanian Heritage Register. History The inside of the synagogue from the women's gallery The building of a synagogue was raised as the Hobart Jewish community began to emerge in the 1830s. The Hobart Hebrew Congregation Synagogue was consecrated on 4 July 1845. The building was designed by Hobart Town architect James Thomson, who was a Scottish convict who was pardoned in 1829. By the 1840s, there were sufficient numbers and prospered sufficiently to enable the building of synagogues in Hobart Town (1845) and Launceston (1846). The first Jewish minister was appointed in 1846, and religious practices were established. The 1848 census recorded 435 Jews in Tasmania, the highest number of Jews recorded for Tasmania. Numbers declined as some settlers returned to England, and others left for mainland colonies and New Zealand. The Launceston Synagogue closed in 1871. The Hobart Hebrew Congregation continued its communal life. Though there was no minister in the periods 1873‚Äì1911 and 1922‚Äì1942, Sabbath services were conducted by members. European refugees arriving from 1938 rejuvenated the Jewish community in Tasmania. Ministers were appointed from 1943, but from 1956 members were again required to conduct services. Although several synagogues and churches were built in the Egyptian Revival style in the early nineteenth century, only a few are known to survive, they include the Downtown Presbyterian Church, Nashville, the First Presbyterian Church, New York, the Old Synagogue at Canterbury, England and the Launceston Synagogue.  Current usage  The synagogue is the focal point of Jewish culture in Hobart, and is the only structure owned by the community. The community was Orthodox for many years, and despite efforts from the Council of Orthodox Synagogues of Victoria to ensure that the community remained Orthodox, the community divided the use of the synagogue between the Orthodox and Progressive members of the community. The Tasmanian community reached a low point in the early 1970s when the census recorded fewer than 100 Jews in Hobart, but since then it has rebounded to be 180 in 2001.

While the origins of the club were once linked to the Stock Exchange, membership is open to all and the current membership is drawn from all walks of life. The majority either tend to live or work near central London and the \\"square mile\\". The club was one of the first formed in the United Kingdom in the aftermath of the Boer War to meet the need to recruit soldiers who could already shoot. It is a Registered Charity.Registered charity#Definition of charitable organization The City range of the club is located under London Bridge, and all City-based shooting is done there. The club is also active in long range target rifle shooting and is based for this purpose at the National Shooting Centre, Bisley (some 40 minutes drive from SW London). The Stock Exchange Rifle Club is affiliated to the well-known London and Middlesex Rifle Association - which boasts some of the best facilities and services in the Bisley complex.  History  The Stock Exchange Rifle Club was founded in 1901 by Colonel (later, Sir) Robert Inglis, who responded to Lord Roberts' call to establish small-arms shooting clubs across the land. Lord Roberts, as commander-in-chief of the expeditionary force sent out to put down the Boer rebellion, had discovered that the shooting skills of his soldiers left much to be desired. After handing over to Kitchener, he returned to Britain determined to do something about it. He wanted British soldiers to be as practiced with the rifle as their famous forebears had been with the longbow. Inglis wrote to members of the \\"House\\", that is, the Stock Exchange, of which body his firm was a member, on 18 November 1901, and by 19 December, capital had been raised, and arrangements put in place to permit practice by \\"at least all those Members who have had no previous knowledge of rifle shooting\\", every Monday and Friday, at a range in the Haymarket, SW1. A similarly-named club had been formed in New York before 1878. The first annual prize meeting was held at Bisley on 5 July 1902. Membership already stood at 338: 178 Members of the Stock Exchange and 160 clerks. Inglis was in his first year as Chairman of the Stock Exchange itself, and was knighted in 1910. With all his many interests, his dedication to the establishment of the Stock Exchange Rifle Club was unstinted, and by 1903 a lease had been signed for 2 Borers Passage, just off Devonshire Square, north of Houndsditch and mere yards from the Stock Exchange itself. These premises were to provide 24 rifle positions at 100 feet, and 8 pistol ranges of 75 feet. Despite some setbacks, the new ranges were open and in use by the end of 1904, and the club's foundations were secure. The Museum of London displays an old shooting jacket, \\"donated by a member of the Stock Exchange Rifle Club\\" View down the main (small bore) 6-lane range at the London Bridge premises of the Stock Exchange Rifle Club/Marylebone Rifle and Pistol Club Facilities The club has a full range of all the equipment and firearms necessary to shoot to top standards in all the current shooting disciplines. Members are regularly selected to compete for their counties and countries. =Smallbore= The City facilities are shared with the Marylebone Rifle and Pistol Club, and provide a 6-lane 25m .22 prone and gallery range and a 10m air pistol gallery. These dedicated facilities opened for shooting in April 2013 beneath London Bridge on an initial 25-year lease from the City of London Corporation, owners of the Bridge.

Life She was born in the District of HƒÅna on the island of Maui in the mid to late 18th century. Her mother was High Chiefess Kaloiokalani of the royal family of Kahikinui and Honuaula (southern Maui). Her father was Kalokuokamaile, older half-brother of Kamehameha I who later unified the Hawaiian Islands in to found the Kingdom of Hawaii; both were sons of Ke≈çua Kalanikupuapaikalaninui. Her father was the High Chief of HƒÅna, Kipahulu and Kaupo. Her parents named her Ka ª≈çhelelani, and she was their only child. She was verging into maidenhood when her father died. His people showed their affection for him by making his grave on the highest peak of their country, Kauwiki. Upon news of his death reaching his brother Kamehameha, he immediately assembled a retinue of followers and retainers to accompany his brother Kealiimaikai to bear his request to Kaloiokalani to permit her daughter Ka ª≈çhelelani to take up her residence at his court, and to have his brother take charge of the vast patrimonial estate until Ka ª≈çhelelani should reach her majority. As Ka ª≈çhelelani approached maturity Kamehameha was looking for a matrimonial alliance for his niece. As the Waimea people, under the rule of their high chief Hinai, had shown reluctance to submit to him, Kamehameha united the ruling families through an offer of the hand of his niece to Nuhi, the eldest son of Hinau. This offer was accepted and soon Kaohele was transported to her new home in Waimea. Kamehameha was sorely disappointed in his expectations. Ka ª≈çhelelani became attached to her new home and family, but the anticipated peace between the two families was not realized. Possibly she felt resentment toward Kamehameha, since after he conquered Maui king Kalanikupule, he gave her former land to the chiefs who aided him.

It is native to western North America from Alaska to New Mexico, where it grows in wet mountain habitats in alpine and subalpine regions. There are two general wild types of this species, one native to the interior and one that grows along the Pacific coast and coastal mountains, but these are not always treated separately.Flora of North America Description Caltha leptosepala subsp. howellii This is a perennial herb growing a mostly naked stem with leaves located basally. The leaves are up to 13 or 15 centimeters long and may have smooth, wrinkled, or toothed edges. The inflorescence bears one or more flowers. Each flower is 1 to 4 centimeters wide and lacks petals, having instead petallike sepals which are usually white or sometimes yellow. In the center are many long, flat stamens and fewer pistils. Taxonomy  Caltha leptosepala used to be assigned to the Populago (now Caltha) section with all other Northern Hemisphere species. Genetic analysis however suggests that C. leptosepala is the sister of all Southern Hemisphere species and should be moved into the Psychrophila section. Caltha leptosepala itself is a complex species that has two distinct subspecies in the southwest and southeast of its range, but in the north of its range the distinguishing sets of characters can be found in any combination, and such plants cannot be assigned to either subspecies. * ssp. howellii has one or two flowers with oblong-ovate white sepals. The kidney-shaped leaves of up to 15 cm long have an obtuse tip and basal lobes touching or overlapping. Pollen is pantoporate or sometimes pantocolpate (microscope). It grows in open, marshy vegetation in the Sierra Nevada and the Cascade Range in California, western Nevada, Oregon, western Washington, and on Vancouver Island. * ssp. leptosepala var. leptosepala has one, exceptionally two flowers with white, linear-oblong sepals. The leaves are ovate heart-shaped, up to 7 cm long, have an obtuse to acuminate tip and basal lobes that do not touch. The pollen is tricolpate. It can be found in open marshy alpine and subalpine places in the Rocky Mountains of northeastern Arizona, Colorado, southeastern Idaho, southern Montana, northeastern Nevada, Utah and Wyoming. * ssp. leptosepala var. sulphurea is identical to the nominate variety but has yellow sepals. It occurs in wet alpine and subalpine meadows in the Rocky Mountains of Montana and Idaho.

History Elsmore (also known as Ellmore and originally Glenmore) station of about was settled by John Campbell in 1838. The first official licensees of this run were Campbell & Muir in 1839. In 1843 the owners were Brown & Alcorn. The recorded stock numbers in 1850 were: 66 horses, 1,300 cattle and no sheep. Alexander Campbell of Inverell Station owned Elsmore in 1852. Around 1870 Joseph Wills, a shepherd, is believed to have been the first to find tin in the New England district. These heavy black grains that he found near Elsmore aroused his curiosity. Shortly after selling these to a traveller from Sydney a rush began to search the tin fields around here, Inverell and other nearby areas.Starr, Joan and Mike Nicholas, Pioneering New England, Rigby, Adelaide, 1978 The Elsmore mine was the first commercial tin mine in Australia and has produced tin from various alluvial deposits intermittently since 1871.

A leading venue for music and cultural events in Porto, together with Batalha Cinema, the Coliseu is an example of Portuguese Streamline Moderne and Art Deco styles in the city of Porto. History The front facade and tower of the Coliseum Detail of the municipal seal identifying it as managed by the Municipal Council of Porto On 17 March 1908, the Garden-hall Passos Manuel was inaugurated. Architect M√°rio de Abreu designed the interior and made alterations to the principal hall, staircase and the tower facade, which was covered in windows, and removed the original neon green, red and white that accompanied the original structure at the time of its opening. The Garden-hall Passos Manuel was the first local public hall in the city and \\"was the point of encounter for Portuense society, an elegant local, with sophisticated decorations, with ample gardens and luminous fountains that proportioned all types of entertainment. It had the capacity for 700 people (Coliseu do Porto, 60 anos)\\". In 1911, the hall was renovated, which included a garden and esplanade, party hall, pavilion restaurant, hall and small theatre. By 1937, though, there were already rumblings that demand exceeded the capacity of the structure; the first plans to construct a grand, modern events hall were developed by architect Jos√© Porto. In 1938, the Garden-hall Passos Manuel was deactivated and demolished. The following year, Cassiano Branco assumed the position of principal architect for a new project, with the assistance of J√∫lio de Brito. The construction of the coliseum was a troubled process, that risked the careers of various architects, such as Jos√© Porto (who abandoned the project), such as Dutch architect, Yan Wills (who made designs for the theatre) and J√∫lio de Brito (whose projects were rejected by the Porto Comiss√£o de Est√°tica). But, since he was connect to the Companhia de Seguros Garantia, proprietor of the Garden-hall Passos Manuel (later the Coliseu), Brito continued to be connected with the project. Charles Ciclis, who authored various projects in Parisian theatres, was invited by Cassiano Branco to work on the Coliseum project. Of his interior designs, apparently only the candelabras and doors, were included in the designs, although the designer was never remunerated. The new building opened on 19 December 1941. With changing tastes and advent of popular cinema, the old concert hall was transformed into a cinema/studio in 1971. By 1981, there was a proposal to classify the building, during the 2nd Congress of the Association of Portuguese Architects. But, the first initiatives were open on 11 December 1987, by the IPPC, supported by the 18 December dispatch by the Vice- President. In 1995, the Empresa Art√≠stica, SA/Grupo Alian√ßa-UAP, sold the coliseum to IURD, the Brazilian Universal Church of the Kingdom of God (on 5 October). This news boosted an unprecedented movement of indignation and revolt on the part of the Portuenses. Various artist and institutions such as the municipal council, civil governor and public, reacted unanimously against the announced end of the coliseum. This move resulted in the establishment of the Associa√ß√£o \\"Amigos do Coliseu do Porto\\", who helped stop its sale and protect the building. On 28 September 1996, a public deed for the purchase of the coliseum by the municipal council, which included the cinema Passos Manuel, the Garden-hall, attic hall and a lithography for 680,000 contos. During an event, a fire started in the coliseum that completely destroyed the stage, principal hall and dressing rooms. The recuperated building was reopened on 17 December 1996. On 10 September 1998, the Vice-President of IPPAR at the time, re-confirmed the IPPAR's 1987 intent to classify the building. This process had advanced little in the intermittent years, so that by 12 September 2005, there was a proposal by the DRPorto to classify the building as an Im√≥vel de Interesse P√∫blico (Property of Public Interest). This was later included in the far larger special protection zone that included the buildings of the public works department, Chapel of Almas, Caf√© Majestic, Church of Saint Ildefonso and Cinema Batalha, which was later approved by the consultive council of IGESPAR (12 November), and supported on 29 September 2010, by the National Council of Culture. The Secretary of State for Culture ratified its classification as a Property of Public Interest. In September 2015, a professional ballet troop became the resident company at the Coliseu, the Balleteatro. Between 1997 and 2001, there systematic changes to the buildings interiors, that included the substitution of the electrical systems, the construction of new washrooms on all floors, the substitution of water supply, security and fire protection systems, the repair of the roof, recuperation of the dressing rooms on five floors and the elaboration of a new aesthetic with the building. Moving and scenic lighting equipment were upgraded, the heating network was recovered and improved, an electronic subtitling system (with simultaneous translation in two languages) and an electronic ticket office were installed. The auditorium was completely rebuilt to improve the acoustics and the visibility of the spectators, while a warehouse was built under the auditorium. A second orchestra pit and a new circus track were installed on a hydraulic lifting plate. Architecture A view of the chandalier in the main auditorium The stage and general seating in the auditorium Located in the city of Porto, it is flanked by other buildings, implanted on land with an accentuated slope from east to west; it is addorsed to the Ol√≠mpia Cinema (in the west) and various four-storey residential/commercial buildings in the west.

Smith Foundation (and later, the Otis Smith Kids Foundation) was a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that partnered with targeted Jacksonville, Florida elementary schools to provide programs and services to disadvantaged children in the areas of education, personal development and recreation.Query Cat.com Answers your questions It was one of the first \\"celebrity\\" charitable foundations in the First Coast region that supported initiatives to help at-risk youth and was active for almost two decades. The beginning Otis Smith was born and raised in Jacksonville, Florida and played sports at the local Boy's Club while growing up. Since his college days at Jacksonville University, he was involved with Volunteers for Youth, Big Brothers Big Sisters, Boys and Girls Clubs of America and conducted informal basketball clinics during summers. When Smith returned to Florida in 1989 to play professional basketball for the Orlando Magic, he founded the Otis F. Smith Foundation which began hosting summer basketball clinics for kids. Mission The mission of the Otis Smith Kids Foundation (OSKF) was to improve the quality of life and outlook for the future for Northeast Florida children between the ages of 6 and 12 by providing quality programs and services in the areas of education, recreation, personal growth and development.Volunteer Match.org: Organization detail-Otis Smith Kids Foundation Programs The foundation's activities were expanded into neighborhoods and elementary schools considered economically and academically challenged. Their programs included free summer day camps, after-school tutoring and enrichment programs during the school year such as holiday parties and field trips to sporting events, cultural institutions & local attractions. Health screenings were one of the last services provided. Throughout the 1990s the organization expanded and programs flourished. The charity, with an annual budget of about $400,000 and four full-time employees, never received government funds. A good measure of a charity's effectiveness is the percentage of donations actually spent of programs. A well run organization should keep that percentage above 75%. In a review of local foundations connected to professional athletes, the Otis Smith Kids Foundation rated highly, with 78.6% for 2005. Fundraising The annual Jaspers Celebrity Golf Classic in the spring, and in later years, the Florida Sports Awards show, were responsible for generating about 70 percent of the foundation's funding during the first ten years of operation. = Golf Classic= The golf function was the first cash cow for the foundation and was a good money-maker throughout the 1990s. That success encouraged other groups to emulate the activity, and the increased competition from literally dozens of charity golf tournaments resulted in lower participation and fewer sponsorships, to the point where in 2005, the tournament was just breaking even. In 2005, at least 15 sports star charities operated in the Jacksonville area and most, if not all of them, held a charity golf tournament. =Awards show= Since its first appearance on live television in 1996 as the event that benefited the Otis F. Smith Foundation charity, the Florida Sports Awards had grown to the point of being recognized as a local version of the ESPYs. Over the years, the profitability of the Florida Sports Awards show was reduced as production costs increased. Andy Jacobs, president of First Coast Sports Awards, Inc. and driving force behind the event retired from the Florida Sports Awards in September 2002. =New name= Competition for charity dollars since the terrorist attacks of 9/11 became more intense. Corporations reduced their support because business conditions became more difficult. In November 2002, the Otis F. Smith Foundation was renamed the Otis Smith Kids Foundation in an attempt to emphasize that kids were the focus. Two of the most visible projects in recent years involved life-sized statues. Otis Smith at Sea Cow Auction =Sea Cows for Kids= Just like Cincinnati's Big Pig Gig and Chicago's Cows on Parade, these fiberglass manatees were part of a 2004-2005 fund-raising effort for the foundation. A total of 43 colorfully decorated, lifelike fiberglass manatees took up residence throughout the city, beginning in September 2004‚Äîin time for Super Bowl XXXIX‚Äîand remained until the end of February 2005. They were cleaned up and prepared for the Great Sea Cow Roundup and Auction, held April 2 at the Jacksonville Fairgrounds.St. Augustine Record: Feb 19, 2005-Smith foundation dedicated to children, community After the Roundup & Auction concluded, the winning bidders loaded them up and moved their new artwork to back yards and business locations. =Big Cats for Kids= Big Cats prior to auction Using the same formula as the successful Sea Cows for Kids program, Big Cats for Kids was kicked off in 2006. A total of 53 entities paid $5000 each to sponsor the Cat of their choice. The theme-decorated Big Cats were displayed in locations all over Jacksonville for almost a year before being sold. More than 400 people attended Jammies & Jeans: The Cats Pajamas Party on July 10, 2007 where 41 of the 53 big cats were auctioned off to their FURever homes (the other 12 cats were adopted by their SPOTsors prior to the auction). Vincent Van Jaguar sold at the auction for $12,000, but the average price was $2,900. The project was a FURnomenal success, raising more than $220,000. The foundation's demise After 18 years, and with the reliable financial support activities gone, the Otis Smith Kids Foundation closed its doors at the end of 2007. Smith announced its demise in a news release on August 29, 2007.

He was executed by hanging at Hameln Prison in 1945.  Early life  H√∂√üler was born in 1906 in the town of Oberdorf, today Marktoberdorf, in the Schwabenland of the German Empire. The son of a foreman, he quit school early to become a photographer. Later employed as a warehouse worker, he was unemployed during the Great Depression of the 1930s.Jens- Christian Wagner (ed.): Konzentrationslager Mittelbau-Dora 1943-1945, G√∂ttingen 2007, p. 136 He joined the Nazi Party in early November 1932 (member no. 1,374,713) and the SS (member no. 41,940).Aleksander Lasik: \\"Die Organisationsstruktur des KL Auschwitz\\" in: Aleksander Lasik, Franciszek Piper, Piotr Setkiewicz, Irena Strzelecka (eds): Auschwitz 1940-1945.

O≈õwiƒôcim 1998, p.232Short biography of H√∂√üler at ARC Mainpage  Auschwitz  In June 1940, H√∂√üler was transferred to the newly opened Auschwitz I concentration camp as it received the first mass transports. He managed the camp kitchens and was occasionally used as a subcamp supervisor (). He then became a Work Service Leader () at the camp in early 1941. On 28 July 1941, H√∂√üler accompanied a shipment of 575 selected Auschwitz I inmates to the euthanasia center at Sonnenstein Castle, where they were murdered as part of the Action 14f13 program.Karin Orth: Das System der nationalsozialistischen Konzentrationslager, Hamburg 2002, p. 138 In June 1942, H√∂√üler, together with Otto Moll and Hans Aumeier, participated in killing 168 survivors of a failed uprising in the punishment section of Auschwitz I. For a few months during 1942 he was also responsible for the construction of a holiday resort for the SS in ≈ªywiec, the so-called \\"Solah√ºtte\\". After Auschwitz-Birkenau was formally expanded into an extermination camp in 1942, H√∂√üler took on various commands there. From September to November 1942, a brigade composed of prisoners called Sonderkommando H√∂√üler exhumed 107,000 corpses from mass graves around Auschwitz I in order to burn them in the new Auschwitz II crematoria. The prisoners of the Sonderkommando were then almost invariably murdered after the action. To conduct this disposal, H√∂√üler, along with Rudolf H√∂√ü and Walter Dejaco, had previously visited the Chelmno extermination camp on 16 September 1942 to observe tests conducted by Paul Blobel.Testimony of Rudolf H√∂√ü in: State Museum Auschwitz-Birkenau (eds.): Auschwitz in den Augen der SS, O≈õwiƒôcim 1998, p. 79f At the same time H√∂√üler worked as before in the old crematorium at the main camp Auschwitz I, including gassings in the bunkers. Johann Kremer, SS camp doctor from 30 August to 17 November 1942, recorded a transport of 1,703 Dutch Jews to the main camp managed by Ho√üler. The incident was described in his diary: By the middle of 1943, H√∂√üler became involved in recruiting so-called \\"Aryan\\" prison women, with the prospect of better food and care, for a newly opened camp brothel at the Auschwitz I main camp.Hermann Langbein: Menschen in Auschwitz, Frankfurt am Main, 1980, p. 455 He was then promoted to the senior role of Schutzhaftlagerf√ºhrer at the Auschwitz-Birkenau women's camp in August 1943, which he directed together with Oberaufseherin Maria Mandel. In this role he participated in selections and gassings. He succeeded Paul Heinrich Theodor M√ºller in this capacity. Filip M√ºller, one of the very few Sonderkommando members who survived Auschwitz, paraphrased H√∂√üler's speech given to trick a group of Greek Jews in the undressing room at the portals of the gas chambers: For a short time between 15 March to 15 May 1944, H√∂√üler was also camp commander () of the Neckarelz concentration camp in Mosbach, Germany, a subcamp of the larger Natzweiler-Struthof camp complex in occupied France. Following the Allied invasion of France in June 1944, he returned to the Auschwitz main camp where he was Protective Custody Camp Leader until its final evacuation in January 1945.  Dora-Mittelbau  In January 1945, as the Red Army overran German positions on the Eastern Front, the SS personnel at Auschwitz evacuated to the Mittelbau-Dora concentration camp. Auschwitz commander Richard Baer took over the Dora portion of the complex and H√∂√üler was again made a Protective Custody Camp Leader.Jens- Christian Wagner, Produktion des Todes: Das KZ Mittelbau-Dora (G√∂ttingen, 2001) p. 670 On 5 April 1945, as American 3rd Armored Division closed in on Mittelbau-Dora, H√∂√üler led a forced evacuation of prisoners to the railhead for transfer to the still-functioning Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. The prisoners were then led on a death march for the last stage of their journey.  Bergen-Belsen  Franz H√∂ssler at Bergen-Belsen On 8 April 1945, H√∂√üler arrived with his transport at Bergen-Belsen and became deputy camp commander under Josef Kramer.Jens-Christian Wagner: \\"Inferno und Befreiung - Auschwitz im Harz, in: Die Zeit, Nr.4, 2005 There he directly shot prisoners until the liberation of the camp, crimes for which he would be eventually arrested and tried. On 15 April 1945, H√∂√üler was found hiding among the prisoners in camouflaged clothing and was detained with the remaining SS staff by a unit of the British Army. The SS detainees were then forced to bury thousands of corpses lying around on the camp grounds in mass graves.Karin Orth: Die Konzentrationslager-SS, M√ºnchen 2004, p. 266f.  Conviction and execution  H√∂√üler and 44 other camp staff were tried in the Belsen Trial by a British military court at L√ºneburg. The trial lasted several weeks from September to November 1945. During the trial Anita Lasker testified that he took part in selections for the gas chamber. On 17 November 1945 H√∂√üler was sentenced to death by hanging. The sentence was carried out by British hangman Albert Pierrepoint on 13 December 1945 at Hameln prison.

It was an auxiliary route of SR 17. It started at SR 17 in Mesa, then headed west to Ringold, where it ended. Route description From 1964 until 1970, SR 170 began at Ringold Road near the Columbia River southwest of Basin City. From Ringold Road, the roadway traveled northeast into Basin City and then left east to end at SR 17 north of its southern terminus at (US 395) in Mesa; the current road is named Road 170. History The former route of SR 170 first appeared on a map in 1926, when Rand McNally published a road map of Washington, including a road extending from Hanford to Mesa. That road would later become a section of (SSH 11A) in 1937, which ran from Yakima to Connell. In 1953, SSH 11A was relocated due to the development of the Hanford Site and the Hanford‚ÄìMesa route became the Ringold branch. Although the roadway was on a map by 1926, the road wasn't finished until after 1963; one year later in 1964, the highway became SR 170, which was later moved to another route near Warden in 1970.

The report developed under the leadership of Ottmar Edenhofer evaluates the global potential for using renewable energy to mitigate climate change. This IPCC special report provides broader coverage of renewable energy than was included in the IPCC's 2007 climate change assessment report, as well as stronger renewable energy policy coverage. In the present time, there is an obvious trend to have more renewable energy sources and therefore to overcome life crisis that can go when oil and gas expire. Renewable energy can contribute to \\"social and economic development, energy access, secure energy supply, climate change mitigation, and the reduction of negative environmental and health impacts\\". Under favourable circumstances, cost savings in comparison to non-renewable energy use exist.  History  Previously the IPCC examined both renewable energy and energy efficiency in its fourth assessment report, published in 2007, but members decided that renewable energy commercialization merits additional in-depth coverage because of its importance in reducing carbon emissions. Scoping Paper: IPCC Special Report The outline of the IPCC WG III's Special Report on Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation (SRREN) was approved at the IPCC Plenary in Budapest in April, 2008. The final report was approved at the 11th session of the IPCC Working Group III, May 2011, in Abu Dhabi. The SRREN addresses the information needs of policy makers, private sector and civil society in a comprehensive way and will provide valuable information for further IPCC publications, including the upcoming IPCC 5th Assessment Report. The SRREN was released for publication on May 9, 2011.Special Report on Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation The Special Report \\"aims to provide a better understanding and broader information on the mitigation potential of renewable energy sources: technological feasibility, economic potential and market status, economic and environmental costs&benefits;, impacts on energy security, co-benefits in achieving sustainable development, opportunities and synergies, options and constraints for integration into the energy supply systems and in the societies\\".IPCC Activities Main findings Renewable energy can contribute to \\"social and economic development, energy access, secure energy supply, climate change mitigation, and the reduction of negative environmental and health impacts\\". In the report, the IPCC said \\"as infrastructure and energy systems develop, in spite of the complexities, there are few, if any, fundamental technological limits to integrating a portfolio of renewable energy technologies to meet a majority share of total energy demand in locations where suitable renewable resources exist or can be supplied\\". Under favourable circumstances, cost savings in comparison to non-renewable energy use exist. IPCC scenarios \\"generally indicate that growth in renewable energy will be widespread around the world\\". The IPCC said that if governments were supportive, and the full range of renewable technologies were deployed, renewable energy could account for almost 80% of the world's energy supply within four decades. Rajendra Pachauri, chairman of the IPCC, said the necessary investment in renewables would cost only about 1% of global GDP annually. This approach could keep greenhouse gas concentrations to less than 450 parts per million, the safe level beyond which climate change becomes catastrophic and irreversible.

Early life and education  Born in Washington, Pennsylvania, Cindrich earned an Artium Baccalaureus degree from Wittenberg University in 1965 and earned a Juris Doctor magna cum laude from the University of Pittsburgh School of Law in 1968. After law school, Cindrich clerked for United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit Judge Ruggero Aldisert from 1968 until 1969.  Professional career prior to becoming a judge  After a stint as a United States Army Reserve specialist from 1968 until 1971, Cindrich worked for Allegheny County, Pennsylvania as an assistant public defender from 1969 until 1970 and as an assistant district attorney from 1970 until 1972. Cindrich shifted to private legal practice from 1972 until 1978. Cindrich served as the United States Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania from 1978 until 1981, when he again returned to private legal practice until being appointed to the federal bench. While Cindrich was in private practice, he hired future Third Circuit Judge Thomas Hardiman as an associate at his firm.  Federal judicial service  On August 12, 1994, President Clinton nominated Cindrich to become a judge for the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. The United States Senate unanimously confirmed Cindrich in a voice vote on October 6, 1994.  Nomination to the Third Circuit  On February 9, 2000, President Clinton nominated Cindrich for a seat on the Third Circuit, to replace Timothy K.

Of these weapon systems, the latest variant is the Kung Feng VI, which commenced development in 1975, and was formally revealed to the public during the Taiwan National Day Parade in 1981. Characteristics The Kung Feng IV features two compartments of 20 launchers, adding to a total of 40 launchers altogether, and is able to fire all rockets within 16 seconds. Its 126mm rockets weigh 24.4 kilograms, are 0.91 metres long, and have a range of 10,500 metres. The Kung Feng VI resembles the Soviet BM-21 Grad, albeit with a smaller diameter size and greater number of launcher tubes. Each of the 45 117mm launcher tubes houses an A-type rocket, and the tubes are capable of firing all rockets within 22.5 seconds, with a destructive area of 800 by 600 metres. The A-type rockets are 2.166 metres long, weigh 42.64 kilograms, have a maximum range of 15,000 metres, and can be fitted with either high explosive or white phosphorus payloads. History The Kung Feng IV began development in 1960 and was completed in 1975, and were placed atop M113 armored vehicles. Towed and self- propelled variants of the Kung Feng IV entered service in 1972 and 1976 respectively; the towed variants were initially attached to the chemical weapons artillery division. Because the Kung Feng IV launchers were comparatively small, they were modified to be placed atop various different vehicles, such as the M151 jeep and LVTP5-RL. By the year 2000, only the LVTP5-RL variants of the marine corps were in service. During the 1970s, the earlier developmental models of the Kung Feng VI rocket launchers only had a range of 10 kilometres, which made them less effective than the older Kung Feng IV launchers. Unsatisfied with the range of the launchers being inferior to that of those from other countries, chief of staff of the artillery forces Hau Pei-tsun requested that the Academia Sinica research and development division increase the range of the rockets to 22 kilometres, and develop designs that allow for the implementation of cluster bombs and airburst fuses. This development led to the B-type rockets which were completed but never entered service. As other countries further continued to improve their rocket systems, with post-Cold War 122mm rocket models pushing beyond ranges of 20 kilometres, the weapons development of the ROC armed forces gradually fell behind. Within the development process, the Kung Feng VI was initially planned to be placed on top of an M42 Duster chassis, however due to difficulties in procurement the M113 chassis was used instead, which was unable to properly bear the weight of the rocket system. Henceforth, the ROC army gave up on the prospects of implementing the Kung Feng VI on caterpillar tracks, and began working on placing them on M809 five tonne wheeled trucks, in addition to implementing the FAC-202R fire control apparatus in order to improve precision. The ROC armed forces quickly retired its Kung Feng IV launchers and replaced them with the newer VI model as it entered service, however at the same time the launchers were incapable of fast reloading and had no dedicated transport trailer. Upon firing, it took soldiers 15 minutes to manually load the next rockets before the Kung Feng VI could fire again. Because the Kung Feng VI had logistical requirements greater than that of non-traditional artillery units, not many units were manufactured.

At the beginning we see him and his girlfriend on the bed, just staring at each other (seemingly just after having sex). Quickly he pulls her out of the bed, gives her a sheet to cover herself and pushes her out the door. She stands there as he walks to the bathroom, and he has memories of them having sex. He walks passed the bath tub but no one is in there, but he looks in the mirror and sees the bath tub in reflection and his girlfriend is in there bathing. He leaves the bathroom and walks down the hall still having the memories, but suddenly his girlfriend thrusts him onto the wall and lifts his shirt and licks his stomach and chest. She puts his hand in his pants but he quickly walks away. Then on the stairs he sees a red bra and high heeled shoes. He walks into his bedroom where he sees his girlfriend. Suddenly she pushes him onto the bed and they begin having sex. Then suddenly they stop. We then see the same events in the beginning of the video, as he pushes her out the door (showing he is addicted to her). As an ending scene, his girlfriend comes and takes his hand, and leans in to kiss him. In this version his girlfriend is played by Elizabeth Hendrickson best known as Chloe Mitchell on The Young and the Restless and Maggie Stone on All My Children. TNA wrestlers Jay Lethal and SoCal Val star in another version of the video.

Capote: A Biography (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1988), page 85. \\"Miriam\\" was one of Capote's first published short stories, and in 1946 it earned an O.

Plot summary \\"Miriam\\" is about a 61-year-old widow named Mrs. H. T. Miller who wants to spend the remaining years of her life alone in her apartment near the East River after the death of her husband, H. T. Miller. She is very lonely, has no friends to speak of and does not keep in touch with any of her relatives. One day, going into a movie theater, she meets a young, intelligent girl named Miriam. Mrs. Miller is intrigued that the girl's first name is also Miriam. Miriam asks Mrs. Miller to buy her a movie ticket because the usher will not let her in. She gives Mrs. Miller 25 cents (two dimes and a nickel) to buy her a ticket. They part as Mrs. Miller goes in search of a seat. When the movie ends, Mrs. Miller returns home. The following week, there is a knock on Mrs. Miller's door. When she answers it, she finds out it is Miriam, the girl she met at the movie theater. Mrs. Miller asks Miriam to go home, but Miriam refuses and asks Mrs. Miller to make her a jelly sandwich. After Miriam agrees to leave if given the sandwich, she goes into Mrs. Miller's bedroom and finds a cameo brooch that was given to Mrs. Miller by her deceased husband. She asks Mrs. Miller if she can keep it, and Mrs. Miller, despite her desire to stop her from taking it, relents in helplessness. Miriam then goes back to the couch and finishes her sandwich. Before leaving, Miriam asks Mrs. Miller for a kiss goodnight, but Mrs. Miller refuses. Miriam walks over to a nearby vase and smashes it on the floor, tramples the bouquet, then leaves. The next morning, Mrs. Miller leaves her apartment to spend the day shopping at various stores around New York City. Upon arriving home, Miriam returns, insistently ringing the doorbell while Mrs. Miller refuses to open the door. After the doorbell ringing ends, Mrs. Miller goes to her door to see if Miriam has left. Miriam has not, and rushes inside the house before Mrs. Miller can close the door. Miriam perches upon the couch and tells Mrs. Miller to bring in the large box she brought with her. Out of curiosity, she does. While commenting on the cherries, almond cakes, and white flowers that Mrs. Miller bought while she was shopping, Miriam tells Mrs. Miller to open the box. All she finds are clothes and a second doll similar to the one Miriam was holding. Miriam then tells Mrs. Miller that she is going to live with her. A frightened Mrs. Miller goes to the apartment downstairs where a young couple lives. Mrs. Miller tells them that a young girl keeps on appearing and will not leave her alone. She convinces the man living there to check upstairs while his wife comforts Mrs. Miller. The man returns downstairs and says that there is no girl upstairs. Mrs. Miller asks if there was a large box, and the man says that there wasn't. Mrs. Miller goes back upstairs to find no one is there. Scared more than ever at the startling emptiness of the house, she slumps onto the couch, drained. She closes her eyes and calms down, reminding herself that she is Mrs. H. T. Miller, the woman who lives alone and does everything for herself. She then becomes aware of another sound, the sound of a silk dress ruffling. She stiffens and fearfully opens her eyes to see Miriam staring at her. The last line of the story \\" 'Hello,' said Miriam\\" is ambiguous, in that it is unclear which Miriam is speaking. Publication history \\"Miriam\\" was reprinted as early as 1949 in Capote's short story collection A Tree of Night and Other Stories. It was published in independent hardback form in September 1981, under the title Miriam: A Classic Story of Loneliness. Most recently it was included in The Complete Stories of Truman Capote, published in 2004. Reception and critical analysis \\"Miriam\\" is noted for having a \\"dreamlike, psychological quality\\" and a theme exploring double personality disorder.Stanton, Robert J. Truman Capote: A Primary and Secondary Bibliography (1980) G K Hall & Company. p. 43 Reynolds Price observes that two of Capote's early short stories, \\"Miriam,\\" along with \\"A Jug of Silver\\" reflect his familiarity with fellow contemporary southern writing, specifically that of Carson McCullers. He also notes \\"Miriam\\" is imbued with a \\"perhaps too-easy eeriness.\\".Price, Reynolds, introduction to The Complete Stories of Truman Capote (New York: Random House, 2005), pages xi&xii.; Readers have noted symbolism in the story, in particular the use of colors in clothing. Blue, Mrs. Miller‚Äôs favorite color, is seen as a symbol of sadness. Plum is viewed as a symbol of wealth and white a symbol for being clean, good, and healthful. Notably Miriam often wears white, and many times during the story it is snowing, and snow is also white. The Hebrew origin of the name \\"Miriam\\" may translate as \\"wished-for child,\\" which could explain a great deal about what Mrs. Miller wants and sees in her young visitor. Miriam may be viewed as a symbol for the angel of death. Capote also comments on the themes of identity that lie within the story:\\"... For the only thing she had lost to Miriam was her identity, but now she knew she had found again the person who lived in this room, who cooked her own meals, who owned a canary, who was someone she could trust and believe in: Mrs. H.

It is located in the south central portion of the U.S. state of Washington, bounded on the west by Interstate 82, on the south by the city of Yakima, on the north by the city of Ellensburg and Interstate 90, and on the east by the Columbia River. It is a part of Joint Base Lewis-McChord. It comprises 327,000 acres (132,332 hectares) of land, most of which consists of shrub-steppe, making it one of the largest areas of shrub-steppe habitat remaining in Washington state. The terrain is undulating and dominated by three east-west parallel ridges, the Saddle Mountains, Manastash Ridge, and Umtanum Ridge anticlines, which are part of the Yakima Fold Belt near the western edge of the Columbia River Plateau. Vegetation consists of sagebrush, bitterbrush, and bunch grass.\\"Yakima Training Center\\", globalsecurity.org Vagabond Army Airfield and Selah Airstrip are located on the Yakima Training Center. The training center is also used by the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force for exercises. Japan Self- Defense Force History From 1942 to 1946 the U.S. Army leased of land in the area for the Yakima Anti-Aircraft Artillery Range. Then in 1951 the Army purchased for the Yakima Firing Center, which would become the modern Yakima Training Center.Yakima Training Center: Little-known, really big operation, Seattle Times The United States Army identified a need for a large maneuver area in the Pacific Northwest and appointed a board of officers to negotiate with local landowners to lease 160,000 acres in the Yakima area. In 1941, just prior to World War II, military units in the Pacific Northwest began using the Yakima Anti-Aircraft Artillery Range for range firing and small unit tests; and in 1942 the first temporary buildings were constructed on Umptanum Ridge about eight miles northeast of the current cantonment area. During the latter part of 1942 and 1943, another camp was built in the location of the present cantonment area and was named the Yakima Firing Center. The 9th Service Command assumed control of the Yakima Firing Center and supported training for numerous Army Reserve and National Guard infantry, artillery, and engineer units through the remainder of World War II. The Army decided to enlarge the Yakima Firing Center because of increasing training requirements and its future potential. In 1951, the Army bought 261,198 acres at a cost of $3.3 million. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, Yakima Firing Center supported training activities and exercises for Fort Lewis units and the Washington Army National Guard. These exercises ranged up to division level and included major exercises named HILLTOP, APPLEJACK, and COOLY CREST. In 1965 the United States Marine Corps conducted Operation YAKIMA ATTACK, which was a joint air/ground exercise of the type that illustrates the true value of Yakima Firing Center as a maneuver training area. During the Vietnam War era, Yakima Firing Center was used almost exclusively for U.S. Army Reserve and Army National Guard training; Fort Lewis had become a training center and no longer housed a division. However, in 1971 the 9th Infantry Division was activated at Fort Lewis, and in 1974 their first divisional exercise, BOLD FIRE, marked the return of the active Army to Yakima Firing Center. Users of the Yakima Firing Center continued to grow over the next several years. The single largest exercise ever conducted at Yakima Firing Center occurred in 1976, when 6,000 active, reserve, and National Guard, and sister services converged on the installation for Joint Training Exercise BRAVE SHIELD. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the 9th Division and the Washington Army National Guard trained extensively on the installation. They conducted tank gunner, extensive maneuver exercises and tests. New equipment was frequently tested at Yakima Firing Center because of its rugged, austere conditions. The new equipment provided greater mobility and the new weapons had greater range, so the Army determined that more area was required. In 1987, actions began that resulted in the acquisition of more than 63,000 acres at a cost of $18 million following congressional approval in 1992. During this period, other major changes occurred for Yakima Firing Center. The 9th Infantry Division deactivated at Fort Lewis, and a brigade from the 7th Infantry Division moved in; construction of the Multi-Purpose Range Complex was completed in 1988 and it opened for business in July 1989, and the Yakima Firing Center was renamed the YAKIMA TRAINING CENTER in 1990. The new name more accurately described the mission and capability of the installation. The force structure at Fort Lewis continued to change, and the stationing of three Stryker brigades from the 2nd Infantry Division, 1 Artillery and ADA Brigade and a Battlefield Surveillance Brigade once again increased training levels at Yakima Training Center. Major improvements to the installation increased its capability to support training. Another major range project, the Multi-Purpose Training Range, was completed; 250 miles of high quality road were constructed; a state-of-the-art Wash Rack facility, a new fuel facility, and an expanded Ammunition Supply Point enhanced the expanded maneuver area. Yakima Training Center provides training support for transient units and organizations by sustaining training lands, range complexes, and support facilities in order to enhance readiness. The installation's customers include not only the Joint Base Lewis-McChord and Army National Guard units, but also U.S. Special Operations Command, Marine Corps, Air Force, Navy, and Coast Guard units, plus local and federal law enforcement agencies and allied forces from Canada and Japan. National Security Agency Yakima is marked in this German map of Echelon, published by the German State Authority for the Protection of the Constitution in a 1998 report. In addition to its role as a training facility, the Yakima facility has been asserted to play a major role in ECHELON, the global surveillance network operated by Five Eyes. The SIGINT portion of the facility is referred to as Yakima Research Station. The small Yakima intercept station remains an important means of intercepting COMINT passing through the plethora of INTELSAT and other international communications satellites orbiting geosynchronously above the earth. In April 2013, the Yakima Herald reported that the Yakima Research Station was going to be shut down at some unspecified time in the future with its function moving to a facility in Colorado. The office of Congressman Doc Hastings, in whose district the facility is located, was notified by the NSA in summer 2012 that the facility was going to be shut down. This was subsequently confirmed, with the Navy posting an OPNAV notice of closure. The functions of the facilities will be moved to the Aerospace Data Facility at Buckley Air Force Base in Colorado and result in the loss of 100 or more jobs from the Yakima area. According to James Bamford, the facility's focus on satellite communications led to its closure. \\"That's history now\\", said Bamford in 2013. \\"Cyberspace and [supercomputers] are the frontier.\\" References Category:Installations of the United States Army in Washington (state) Category:Buildings and structures in Kittitas County, Washington Category:Buildings and structures in Yakima County, Washington Category:National Security Agency facilities ","title":"Yakima Training Center"},{"id":"17376912","text":"Queen City Development Bank, also known as Queenbank, is a Philippines private development bank based in Iloilo City.http://www.philstar.com/business/95724/queenbank-declares-cash-dividend Founded in 1981, it has branches operating in key cities all over the country, offering financial services to both companies and individual investors. Its services include deposit in investment banking, corporate and retail financing, dollar deposits and other basic banking products. It is owned by Rogelio Florete. It is one of the few banks with headquarters outside Metro Manila that is a member of an interbank ATM network, in this case, MegaLink (now BancNet). History Founded in July 18, 1981, Queen City Development Bank is a private thrift bank with head office in Iloilo City. To date (2012), it has fifteen (15) branches all over the Philippines. It offers corporate and private financial services such as investment banking deposits, corporate and retail financing, peso and dollar deposits apart from the basic banking services. Queenbank started out as an 11-personnel, single-branch financial institution with Php 11-million paid-up capital. The year after its foundation, it became an accredited foreign exchange dealer. Gradually, the bank obtained additional facilities and built a name for itself amidst a throng of emerging and more established banking institutions. Through the years, the bank has been supporting small and medium enterprises (SMEs) with their financial and banking needs. The 90s saw a surge in the bank‚Äôs expansion of offered services. In 1993, it was granted the authority to participate in institutions such as the Philippine Clearing House Corporation (PCHC) and accept and create demand deposits. Participating in the PCHC gave the bank authority to offer checking account services to its clients. The following year, the bank invested in Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) and offered the service to its clients, yielding to an increase in clients and deposit volume. With its core operations located in Iloilo City, the bank has established branches in other key cities around the country.

The effect is facilitated by radiant energy such as UV or artificial light. This process is the most significant factor in weathering of polymers. Photo-oxidation is a chemical change that reduces the polymer's molecular weight. As a consequence of this change the material becomes more brittle, with a reduction in its tensile, impact and elongation strength. Discoloration and loss of surface smoothness accompany photo-oxidation. High temperature and localized stress concentrations are factors that significantly increase the effect of photo- oxidation. Chemical mechanism Aldehydes, ketones and carboxylic acids along or at the end of polymer chains are generated by oxygenated species in photolysis of photo-oxidation. The initiation of photo-oxidation reactions is due to the existence of chromophoric groups in the macromolecules. Photo- oxidation can occur simultaneously with thermal degradation and each of these effects can accelerate the other. The photo-oxidation reactions include chain scission, cross linking and secondary oxidative reactions. The following process steps can be considered:Rabek, JF 1990, Photostabilization of Polymers:Principles and Application, ELSEVIER SCIENCE PUBLISHER LTD, England initial step, chain propagation step, chain branching and termination step. In the initial step, free radicals are formed by photon absorption. In the chain propagation step, a free radical reacts with oxygen to produce a polymer peroxy radical (POO‚Ä¢). This reacts with a polymer molecule to generate polymer hydroperoxide (POOH) and a new polymer alkyl radical (P‚Ä¢). With chain branching, polymer oxy radicals (PO‚Ä¢) and hydroxy radicals (HO‚Ä¢) are formed by photolysis. The termination step is cross linking which is a result of the reaction of different free radicals with each other. :Initial step :: Polymer -> P\\\\bullet +\\\\ P\\\\bullet :Chain propagation ::P\\\\bullet +\\\\ O2 -> POO\\\\bullet ::POO\\\\bullet +\\\\ PH -> {POOH} +\\\\ P\\\\bullet :Chain branching ::POOH -> PO\\\\bullet +\\\\ OH\\\\bullet ::{PH} + OH\\\\bullet -> P\\\\bullet +\\\\ H2O ::PO\\\\bullet -> Chain\\\\ scission\\\\ reactions :Termination ::POO\\\\bullet +\\\\ POO\\\\bullet -> cross\\\\ linking\\\\ reaction\\\\ to\\\\ non-radical\\\\ product ::POO\\\\bullet +\\\\ P\\\\bullet -> cross\\\\ linking\\\\ reaction\\\\ to\\\\ non-radical\\\\ product :: P\\\\bullet +\\\\ P\\\\bullet -> cross\\\\ linking\\\\ reaction\\\\ to\\\\ non-radical\\\\ product where PH = Polymer P‚Ä¢ = Polymer alkyl radical PO‚Ä¢ = Polymer oxy radical (Polymer alkoxy radical) POO‚Ä¢ = Polymer peroxy radical (Polymer alkylperoxy radical) POOH = Polymer hydroperoxide OH‚Ä¢ = hydroxy radical =Effects of dyes/pigments= Adding pigment light absorbers and photostabilizers (UV absorbers) is one way to minimise photo- oxidation in polymers. Antioxidants are used to inhibit the formation of hydroperoxides in the photo-oxidation process. Dyes and pigments are used in polymer materials to provide color changing properties. These additives can reduce the rate of polymer degradation. Cu-phthalocyanine dye can help stabilize against degradation, but in other situations such as photochemical aging can actually accelerate degradation. The excited Cu-phthalocyanine may abstract hydrogen atoms from methyl groups in the PC, which increase the formation of free radicals. This acts as the starting points for the sequential photo-oxidation reactions leading to the degradation of the PC. Electron transfer sensitization is a mechanism where the excited Cu- phthalocyanine abstracts electrons from PC to form Cu-Ph radical anion and PC radical cations. These species in the presence of oxygen can cause oxidation of the aromatic ring.Clodoaldo Saron, Fabio Zulli, Marco Giordano, Maria Isabel Felisberti, Influence of copper-phthalocyanine on the photodegradation of polycarbonate, Polymer Degradation and Stability, Volume 91, Issue 12, December 2006, Pages 3301-3311 Photo-oxidation protection Poly(ethylene- naphthalate) (PEN) can be protected by applying a zinc oxide coating, which acts as protective film reducing the diffusion of oxygen.L.

Photo- catalytic oxidation of polymers Single-use plastic products after their service life often end up in urban areas and in the environment. Most likely, plastic incorrectly disposed of finds its way to lakes, rivers and finally oceans, consisting of danger for marine and terrestrial flora and fauna. The tendency of the plastic to be subjected to photo-oxidation can be positively used and enhanced thanks to the addition of a catalyst. In fact, the plastic with the addition of a catalyst is subject to a fast and aggressive photo- oxidation that degrades the macro and microparticles in fewer harmful sub- products such as low molecular weight compounds (hydroperoxides, peroxides, and carbonyl saturated and unsaturated group).

Some student managed investment funds such as the University of Texas at Austin manage funds for private clients, who are accredited investors under U.S. securities laws. Another source is the loan that supplies the funds at Cameron University. Some student managed investment funds are organized by function (accounting, public relations, etc.), while others such as the Lemma Senbet Fund are organized by economic sectors (Consumer Products, Energy Industry, Information technology, etc.). The business students managing the fund typically take a for-credit course in conjunction with their management duties. Many of these programs belong to the Association of Student Managed Investment Programs. In addition to managing a portfolio, these classes provide related experiences relevant to being a professional fund manager.

The screenplay was written by John Taintor Foote, uses the actual racehorse names, but changed the names of people involved. Though shot in Technicolor, the film incorporates actual black-and-white footage of Seabiscuit in races, including the 1940 Santa Anita Handicap and the 1938 match race against rival War Admiral, which is still considered by many to be the greatest horse race of all time. Summary The film is a fictionalized account of the career of the 1930s racehorse Seabiscuit (1933-1947), with a subplot involving the romance between the niece (Temple) of a horse trainer (Fitzgerald) and a jockey (Lon McCallister). Cast * Shirley Temple as Margaret O'Hara * Barry Fitzgerald as trainer Sean O'Hara * co-starring Lon McCallister as jockey Ted Knowles * with Rosemary DeCamp as Mrs. Charles S. Howard * Donald MacBride as George Carson * Pierre Watkin as Charles S. Howard * William Forrest as Thomas Milford Production notes In July 1940 David Butler was taking technicolor footage of Seabiscuit for a film called Blood Will Tell for RKO. This included footage of Seabiscuit's win at Santa Anita against Kayak after Seabiscuit had recovered from a ruptured suspensory ligament. The cast was to include Lucille Ball, Edna May Oliver and Leon Errol. Dick Powell was going to play the lead then John Wayne; the title was changed to True to Form. Wayne fell out and Randolph Scott and James Craig were considered for the film. Eventually it was not made. Butler was friends with Charles Howard. A common friend, Phil Hall, told Butler that Howard was ill and would love to see a film made out of Seabiscuit. Butler approached Jack Warner, who was a horse owner, and pitched the project, saying Barry Fitzgerald would be ideal for the role of Tom Smith the trainer.Butler pp. 234‚Äì235 In August 1947 Warner Bros announced they had done a deal with C. S. Howard, owner of the horse, to make The Story of Seabiscuit. Butler would direct in color from a scenario which included material from Howard. Butler got John Traintor Foote, who wrote the horse riding film Kentucky, to write the script. In November the studio said Foote had written a script and that Barry Fitzgerald would play the lead alongside Geraldine Brooks, with William Jacobs to produce and filming to begin in December. However filming was delayed and Brooks dropped out. In March 1949, Shirley Temple and Lon McAllister were signed to co star alongside Fitzgerald, and the title was Always Sweethearts. The same month Warners completed a deal with RKO worth a reported $25,000 for the 10,000 feet of color footage of Seabiscuit shot in 1940. Filming started in April 1949. Temple was coached in an Irish accent by Arthur Shields. The role of Seabiscuit was played by two of his children, Sea Sovereign and Sea Gamble. The bulk of the film was shot at Northridge Farms, a development established by Barbara Stanwyck and her then agent Zeppo Marx, then sold to a syndicate. According to one report the Farm is \\"used pretty generally when Hollywood is trying to look like the blue grass country of Kentucky.\\" It was also shot at Santa Anita, Burns Park and Burns Ranch in Woodland Hills.Butler p. 235 The part of the film where Seabiscuit races War Admiral was shown in black and white because Butler could only source black and white news footage of that race.Butler p. 237 Butler says a copy of the finished film was sent to Howard in Hawaii. \\"He was very sick there, but he got a big kick out of it\\", said Butler. \\"That was one of the nicest things that ever happened to him.\\"Butler p. 235 Reception =Box office= According to Butler \\"the picture caught on. In Europe it did the best business of any Warner picture that year. We had all the things in it that happened in Seabiscuit's life. The picture runs on television all the time. It didn't cost much to make ‚Äì about $700,000 ‚Äì and it made a fortune.\\"Butler p. 235 =Critical= The New York Times reviewer panned the film, stating, \\"the odds are that Seabiscuit's screen saga will prove an also-ran\\" and characterizing the subplot as \\"one of the season's dullest romances\\". AMC critic Christopher Null agreed, writing, \\"The only actual reason to watch this film ... is the black and white footage of Seabiscuit's actual races\\".

The development of Mariology over the centuries has been influenced by a number of factors, among which papal directives have often represented key milestones. Examples of papal influences include new Marian feast days, prayers, acceptance of new Marian congregations, indulgences, support for Marian apparitions (e.g. Lourdes and Fatima) and declaration of Marian dogmas. \\"The century preceding the Second Vatican Council was arguably the most fertile era for Catholic Marian studies.\\" A number of popes have made Marian themes a key part of their papacy, e.g. Leo XIII issued a record eleven encyclicals on the rosary, Pius XII invoked the case of ex cathedra papal infallibility to establish a Marian dogma and John Paul II built his personal coat of arms around the Marian Cross. Popes have also highlighted the key Catholic Mariological theme of the link between the study of Mary and the development of a full Christology, e.g. as in Pius XII's Mystici corporis Christi and John Paul II's Redemptoris Mater. Papal influences on Mariology Popes were highly important for the development of doctrine and the veneration of the Blessed Virgin.McLoughlin, William M. and Pinnock, Jill. Mary for Time and Eternity, 2007 pp. 65-67 They made decisions not only in the area of Marian beliefs (Mariology) but also Marian practices and devotions. Popes promulgated Marian veneration and beliefs by authorizing: new Marian feast days, Marian prayers and initiatives, acceptance and support of Marian congregations, indulgences and special privileges, and support for Marian devotions. The formal recognition of Marian apparitions (such as at Lourdes and Fatima) has also been influential. Popes have promoted Marian devotion through encyclicals, Apostolic Letters and with two dogmas (Immaculate Conception and Assumption), the promulgation of Marian years (Pius XII, John Paul II), visits to Marian shrines (Benedict XVI in 2007) and in 2018 Pope Francis decreed that the Memorial of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of the Church be inserted into the Roman Calendar on the Monday after Pentecost (also known as Whit Monday). Popular views like the Immaculate Conception and Assumption developed into papal teaching over time. Popes have also limited and cautioned against some devotional practices. In 1674 Pope Clement X (1670‚Äì1676) indexed books on Marian piety. After the Council of Trent, Marian fraternities were founded, fostering Marian piety, not all of which were approved. Not all Popes took the same view on Marian beliefs and devotions. Pope Francis warned that it could not please Mary if we honor her in a way that diminishes the honor given to her divine Son. 13th to the 17th centuries =Clement IV= Pope Clement IV (1265‚Äì1268) created a poem on the seven joys of Mary, which in its form is considered an early version of the Franciscan rosary. =Pius V= On September 17, 1569, Pope Pius V issued the papal bull Consueverunt Romani Pontifices which popularized the rosary. Before the Battle of Lepanto in 1571 Pope Pius V requested to the people of Europe to pray the rosary. After the victory of the Holy League, he declared a commemorative feast that later became the Feast of Our Lady of the Rosary.Butler, Alban, Butler's Lives Of The Saints, (April) (1999) page 222 Pius V included in the catechism he promulgated the second part of the Hail Mary that had just been added in the Council of Trent: \\"Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners.\\"The catechism of the Council of Trent by Theodore Alois Buckley 2010 . \\"PART IV: THE LORD'S PRAYER: PRAYER: Importance Of Instruction On Prayer\\". = Clement VIII = Pope Clement VIII (1592‚Äì1605) considered Marian piety the basis for Church reforms and issued the bull Dominici gregis (February 3, 1603) to condemn negations of the virginity of Mary. He promulgated Marian congregations and supported the rosary culture with 19 Papal bulls. =Clement X= Pope Clement X (1670‚Äì1676) furthered Marian piety with additional indulgences and privileges to religious orders and cities to celebrate special Marian feasts. He opposed the Marian piety of Louis de Montfort (canonized by Pope Pius XII) with a bull published on December 15, 1673 and outlawed some manifestations of Marian devotions. Several bulls supported the frequent citing of the rosary. 18th century =Clement XI= Pope Clement XI (1700‚Äì1721) prepared the groundwork for the dogma of the Immaculate Conception. He permitted the title ‚ÄúImmaculate Conception‚Äù and instructed the Holy Office in 1712 not to persecute anyone invoking Mary using this title. The Feast of the Immaculate Conception, which existed only regionally, was prescribed for the whole Church. The Pope recommended the teachings and piety of Louis de Montfort and named him ‚ÄúApostolic Missionary of France‚Äù On October 3, 1716, Clement XI extended the feast of Our Lady of the Rosary to the Universal Church. =Benedict XIII= Pope Benedict XIII (1724‚Äì1730) issued several indulgences in support of the rosary prayer, rosary processions and for praying the rosary on 15 ‚ÄúMarian Tuesdays‚Äù. He outlawed the Serafine rosary in 1727 and extended the feasts of Our Lady of Seven Sorrows and Our Lady of Mount Carmel to the whole Church. =Clement XII= Pope Clement XII (1758‚Äì1769) banned all Marian litanies except the Litany of Loreto. In 1770 he permitted Spain to have the Immaculata as the main patron of the country, and in 1767 he granted Spain the privilege of adding Mater Immaculata to the litany. =Benedict XIV= Pope Benedict XIV wrote books about the feast days of Christ and Mary ‚Äì De festis Christi at BMV.Opera Omnia Roma, 1747, 51 He supported the Marian congregations for the Sodality of Our Lady with the bull Gloriosae Dominae, issued on September 27, 1748, and increased indulgences for all who pray the rosary. =Clement XIV= Pope Clement XIV (1769‚Äì1775) had to deal with popular unrest in Southern Italy regarding celebrations and processions of the Immaculate Conception. He granted a privilege to the Franciscans in Palermo that only they may celebrate the feast of the Immaculate Conception. Later he extended the privilege to other orders for private Masses only. He outlawed the brotherhood of the Immaculate Conception but confirmed a knightly order with the same name. Allegedly, he had promised the King of Spain to dogmatize the Immaculate Conception.F Masson, Le Cardinal de Bernis depuis son minister Paris, 1884, 156, 164 19th century =Pius IX= Pius IX dogmatized the Immaculate Conception in 1854. (Murillo, The Immaculate Conception of El Escorial, 1660-1665) The Mariology of Pope Pius IX (1846‚Äì1878) represents a significant development of Roman Catholic theology, since it led to the promulgation of the dogma of the Immaculate Conception. Catholic theology in the 19th century was dominated by the issue of the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin Mary. During his pontificate petitions increased requesting the dogmatization of the Immaculate Conception. In 1848 Pius appointed a theological commission to analyze the possibility for a Marian dogma. In 1848 the Pope had to flee Rome, when a revolutionary movement took over the Papal States and city government. From his exile in Gaeta he issued the encyclical Ubi primum, seeking the opinions of the bishops on the Immaculate Conception. Over 90 per cent of the bishops requested the dogmatization. Pius IX moved cautiously, on May 10, 1852, appointing a commission of twenty theologians to prepare a possible text of the dogma. Upon their completion, on December 2, 1852, he asked a commission of cardinals to finalize the text. This influenced the eventual promulgation of the dogma of the Assumption. Pius IX's approach of seeking collegial consensus was quoted by Pope Pius XII, when in Deiparae Virginis Mariae he inquired of the bishops about a possible dogma of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary. 1854 proclamation of the Immaculation Conception It was not until 1854 that Pius IX, with the support of the overwhelming majority of Roman Catholic Bishops, proclaimed the Immaculate Conception.The Holy Spirit Assists the Roman Pontiff Eight years earlier, in 1846, the Pope had granted the unanimous wish of the bishops from the United States, and declared the Immaculata the patron of the USA. During the First Vatican Council, some 108 council fathers requested to add the words \\"Immaculate Virgin\\" to the Hail Mary.and to add the Immaculata to the Litany of Loreto. Some fathers requested the dogma of the Immaculate Conception to be included in the Creed of the Church, which was opposed by Pius IX. Rejection of a dogma of the Assumption During the First Vatican Council, nine Mariological petitions favored a possible assumption dogma, but this was strongly opposed by some council fathers, especially from Germany. On 8 May the fathers rejected a dogmatization at that time, a rejection shared by Pius IX. Council fathers highlighted the divine motherhood of Mary and called her the mother of all graces. Pius IX believed in the Assumption of Mary, and recognized the close relation between the Immaculate Conception of Mary and her being taken up into heaven. He resisted attempts, however, to issue a second Marian dogma within two decades. He attributed to Mary his narrow escape from Rome to Gaeta in 1848. =Leo XIII= In his encyclical on the fiftieth anniversary of the Dogma of the Immaculate Conception, Pope Leo XIII stresses Mary's role in the redemption of humanity. His mariology was greatly influenced by Thomas Aquinas, especially his view of Mary's role in the Annunciation. Leo's emphasis on the path through Mary to Christ has been a key direction in Roman Catholic Mariology, with Mariology viewed as inherent in Christology, and the rosary paving that path.Pius XII Mystici corporis Christi; John Henry Newman: Mariology is always christocentric, in Michael Testa, Mary: The Virgin Mary in the Life and Writings of John Henry Newman 2001; Mariology Is Christology in Vittorio Messori, \\"The Mary Hypothesis\\" Rome, 2005 Pope Leo XIII Pope Leo XIII (1878‚Äì1903) issued a record number of encyclicals on the rosary, instituted the Catholic custom of daily rosary prayer during the month of October, and created in 1883 the Feast of Queen of the Holy Rosary. Leo XIII promulgated Marian devotions via twelve encyclicals on the rosary. A century after his death, Leo XIII is often quoted, most recently by Pope Benedict XVI and John Paul II. He applied the Marian analysis of Louis de Montfort to the analysis of the Church as a whole.K√∂ster 54 Leo actively employed his papal authority to support the veneration of Mary in places of her apparitions. Upon the blessing and opening of the Church of our Lady in Lourdes, he issued the apostolic writing Parte humanae generi supporting pilgrimages to Lourdes and other Marian shrines. Leo XIII declared the Virgin of Montserrat to be the patron of Catalonia, and instituted the Feast of the Miraculous Medal in 1894. He condemned heresies about the Immaculate ConceptionRosmini and discussed the relation of Saint Joseph to Mary in the encyclical Quamquam pluries (August 15, 1889).Epistola Encyclica De patrocinio Sancti Josephi una cum Virginis Deiparae pro temporum difficultate implorando in Lettres apostoliques de s.s. L√©on XIII : encycliques, brefs etc, p. 250-261 Leo XIII explained the importance of the rosary as the one road to God, from the father to the Son, to his Mother, and from her to the human race. The rosary is a vital means to participate in the life of Mary and to find the way to Christ.Encyclical Jucunda Semper 8.9.1894 quoted in Marienlexikon,Eos St. Ottilien, 1988 42 Mediatrix Leo XIII was devoted to Our Lady of Good Counsel, and included her invocation in the Litany of Loreto. This image is by Pasquale Sarullo, the original being in Genazzano, near Rome. Pius XII also placed his pontificate under the maternal care of Our Lady of Good Counsel and composed a prayer to her.Univ of Dayton This Saint's for You by Thomas J. Craughwell 2007 page 172 Leo XIII was the first Pope to fully embrace the concept of Mary as mediatrix. In his rosary encyclicals, he described the Virgin Mary as mediating all graces. In 1883 he wrote that nothing is as salvific and powerful as asking for the support of the Virgin, the mediator of peace with God and of heavenly graces. In his rosary encyclical Octobri Mense, he stated that Mary is administrator of graces on earth, part of a new salvation order. In Dei Matris he noted that Mary is mediator because Christ the Lord is also our brother And in Jucunda Semper he stated that the deepest reason why Roman Catholics look for the protection of Mary through prayer is most certainly her office as mediator of divine grace. In Augustissimae Virginis Mariae, he wrote that calling on Mary is the best way to be heard by God, and to find God's grace. From Thomas Aquinas Leo borrows the notion that Mary, in the hour of Annunciation, assumed the role of a helper in the mystery of redemption. Thus all Christians are born through Mary. With Jesus, Mary carried all in her womb. Therefore, all Christians are her children. Scapulars More than any other pope, Leo XIII, who was himself a member of the Pious Union of Our Lady of Good Counsel, was deeply attached to Our Lady of Good Counsel.Ann Ball, 2003 Encyclopedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices page 515 The small Scapular of Our Lady of Good Counsel (the White Scapular) was presented by the Hermits of St. Augustine to Leo XIII who, in December 1893, approved it and endowed it with indulgences. On April 22, 1903, Leo XIII included the invocation \\"Mater boni consilii\\" in the Litany of Loreto. During predecessor Pius's reign, the Scapular of Our Lady of Ransom was previously approved in 1868. 20th century =Pius X= Pope Pius X (1903‚Äì1914) promoted daily communion. In his 1904 encyclical Ad diem illum, he views Mary in the context of \\"restoring everything in Christ\\". Spiritually we all are her children and she is our mother. Therefore, she must be venerated like a mother. Christ is the Word made Flesh and the Savior of mankind. He had a physical body like every other man: and as Savior of the human family, he had a spiritual and mystical body, the Church. This, the Pope argues, has consequences for our view of the Blessed Virgin. She \\"did not conceive the Eternal Son of God merely in order that He might be made man taking His human nature from her, but also by giving him her human nature, that He might be the Redeemer of men. Mary, carrying the Savior within her, also carried all those whose life was contained in the life of the Savior. Therefore, all the faithful united to Christ are members of His body, of His flesh, and of His bones from the womb of Mary like a body united to its head. In a spiritual and mystical fashion, all are children of Mary, and she is their Mother. Mother, spiritually, but truly Mother of the members of Christ\\"Ad diem illum laetissimum, 10 =Benedict XV= Pope Benedict XV (1914‚Äì1922) was an ardent mariologist, devoted to Marian veneration and open to new theological perspectives. He personally addressed in numerous letters the pilgrims at Marian sanctuaries. He named Mary the Patron of Bavaria. To underline his support for the mediatrix theology, he authorized the Feast of Mary Mediator of all Graces.AAS 1921, 345 He condemned the misuse of Marian statues and pictures dressed in priestly robes, which he outlawed April 4, 1916.AAS 1916, 146 During World War I, Benedict placed the world under the protection of the Blessed Virgin Mary and added the invocation Mary Queen of Peace to the Litany of Loreto. He promoted Marian veneration throughout the world by elevating twenty well-known Marian shrines such as Ettal Abbey in Bavaria into Basilica Minor's. He also promoted Marian devotions in the month of May in the spirit of Grignon de Montfort.Schmidlin 179-339 The dogmatic constitution on the Church issued by the Second Vatican Council quotes the Marian theology of Benedict XV.C VII, ¬ß50 In his encyclical on Ephraim the Syrian he depicts Ephraim as a model of Marian devotion to our mother who uniquely was predestined by God. Pope Benedict did not issue a Marian encyclical but addressed the issue of Co- Redemptrix in his Apostolic Letter, Inter Soldalica, issued March 22, 1918.AAS, 1918, 181 > As the blessed Virgin Mary does not seem to participate in the public life > of Jesus Christ, and then, suddenly appears at the stations of his cross, > she is not there without divine intention. She suffers with her suffering > and dying son, almost as if she would have died herself. For the salvation > of mankind, she gave up her rights as the mother of her son and sacrificed > him for the reconciliation of divine justice, as far as she was permitted to > do. Therefore, one can say, she redeemed with Christ the human race. =Pius XI= Pope Pius XI ruled the Church from 1922 to 1939. During his pontificate, a possible dogma of the assumption was being discussed. He granted France the patron \\"Our lady assumed into heaven patron\\".on March 22. 1922 In 1930, he sent a papal delegate to the celebration of the house of Mary in Loreto, and in 1931, 1500 years after the Council of Ephesus, he issued a call to the separated Orthodox Church to venerate Mary together and to overcome the schism. In several apostolic writings he supported praying the rosary. In 1931 he instituted the feast of motherhood of Mary. Pope Pius XI liked to quote Bernard of Clairvaux: \\"We have everything through Mary\\". =Pius XII= Pope Pius XII Eugenio Pacelli was devoted to the Virgin Mary and. as a young boy, two images in Rome received particular veneration: the Madonna Della Strada and Salus Populi Romani.Smit, Jan Olav. Angelic shepherd: the life of Pope Pius XII, 1950 Dodd, Mead Publishers, p. 12The Church at Prayer by Dalmais, Ir√©n√©e Henri; Martimort, Aim√© Georges; and Jounel, Pierre. 1985 page 135 Pope Pius XII was called the most Marian pope in Church history. He placed his pontificate under the protection of the Virgin. In the 1943 encyclical Mystici corporis, Pius XII speaks to the 1854 dogma of the Immaculate Conception promulgated by Pius IX. Mary, whose sinless soul was filled with the divine spirit of Jesus Christ above all other created souls, \\"in the name of the whole human race\\" gave her consent \\"for a spiritual marriage between the Son of God and human nature\\", thus elevating human nature beyond the realm of the purely material. Through her powerful prayers, she obtained that the spirit of our diviner redeemer should be bestowed on the newly founded Church at Pentecost. She is Most Holy Mother of all the members of Christ, and reigns in heaven with her Son, her body and soul refulgent with heavenly glory.Pius XII, Enc. Mystici corporis Christi, 110 Many of the saints canonized by Pius XII were deeply devoted to Mary, such as Peter Chanel, Jeanne de Lestonnac, Pope Pius X, Catherine Labour√©, and Anthony Mary Claret. Fatima Pacelli was consecrated archbishop in the Sistine Chapel by Pope Benedict XV on May 13, 1917, the same day as the first purported apparition of Our Lady of Fatima. His Secretary of State, Cardinal Luigi Maglione would later say that the Pope had been deeply moved by the parallel of his episcopal consecration and the apparition in Fatima.Barthas, L. Il etait trios petit enfantes, Paris, 1945, Freiburg, 1945 Referring to his episcopal consecration Pope Pius said: > At the same hour when the Lord placed the concern of the whole Church on our > shoulders, at the mountain of Fatima appeared for the first time the White > Queen of the Holy Rosary, as if the Mother of Mercy wanted to indicate, that > in the stormy times of our pontificate, in the midst of the great crisis of > human history, we will always have the motherly and vigilant assistance of > the great conqueress, who would protect and guide us.Johannes M H√∂cht, Papst > Pius XII und Fatima, Wien 1956, 58 Cardinal Tedeschini, who was present at the consecration in 1917, added his view to the coincidence: \\"The pontificate of Pius XII is focused on Fatima, May 13. It was our Lady of Fatima, who connected with the person and future of Eugenio Pacelli, having him consecrated through the hands of Pope Benedict XV to the fullness of priesthood at the very day and hour in which the Most Blessed Virgin with her messages first descended to Fatima. May 13 is engraved in all our hearts, how much more in the heart of this Pope.H√∂cht 317 On May 13, 1942, the 25th anniversary of the first apparition, and silver jubilee of the Episcopal consecration of Pope Pius XII, the Vatican published the Message and Secret of Fatima. In May 1946, he authorized his personal representative, Cardinal Masalla to preside over a canonical coronation of the image of Our Lady of Fatima, in Fatima, Portugal. \\"The faithful virgin never disappointed the trust, put on her. She will transform into a fountain of graces, physical and spiritual graces, over all of Portugal, and from there, breaking all frontiers, over the whole Church and the entire world.\\"AAS 1946 246. On May 18, 1950, the Pope sent a message to the people of Portugal: \\"May Portugal never forget the heavenly message of Fatima, which, before anybody else she was blessed to hear. To keep Fatima in your heart and to translate Fatima into deeds, is the best guarantee for ever more graces‚ÄùAAS 1951, 780 Marian year With the September 8, 1953, encyclical Fulgens corona, Pius XII became the first Pope to call for a Marian year, a practice continued by John Paul II in 1987. Set for 1954, Marian year included initiatives in the areas of mariology, cultural events, charity and social gatherings Lourdes On April 1, 1899, Eugenio Pacelli said his first Mass at the Salus Populi Romani. Fifty years later, he crowned this picture for the Marian year 1954 as shown here. The encyclical Le p√®lerinage de Lourdes was issued on July 2, 1957. The encyclical represents the strongest pronouncement of the papal magisterium on Marian apparitions in the history of the Catholic Church. In it Pius recalls pleasant memories of the pilgrimage to Lourdes which he undertook while Papal delegate at the Eucharistic and Marian Celebrations in 1937. The Pope reminds the faithful of France that every Christian land is a Marian land and that ‚Äùthere is not one nation redeemed in the blood of Christ which does not glory in proclaiming Mary its Mother and Patroness.‚ÄùPope Pius XII, Le p√®lerinage de Lourdes, ¬ß5 He then recalls the history of Marian veneration, the history of Lourdes and the contributions of the Popes to her veneration in Lourdes. Christian families must remain faithful to their vital mission in society, and, consecrate themselves in this jubilee year to the Immaculate Heart of Mary. For married couples this consecration will be a valuable aid in their conjugal duties of chastity and faithfulness and keep pure the atmosphere in which children grow up.'' \\"Professional and civic affairs offer a vast field of Marian action. Gathered at the Virgin's feet, and open to her teachings, self-searching will uproot any false judgments and selfish impulses. ...The quest for social and political peace among men is, above all, a moral problem, because no reform can bear fruit, no agreement lasting without a conversion and cleansing of heart. In this jubilee year the Virgin of Lourdes reminds all men of this truth.\\" Pius XII teaches that Mary looks upon some of her children with a special affection, the lowly, the poor, and the afflicted whom Jesus loved so much. > Go to her, you who are crushed by material misery, defenseless against the > hardships of life and the indifference of men. Go to her, you who are > assailed by sorrows and moral trials. Go to her, beloved invalids and > infirm, you who are sincerely welcomed and honored at Lourdes as the > suffering members of our Lord. Go to her and receive peace of heart, > strength for your daily duties, joy for the sacrifice you offer. The Pontiff states that the Immaculate Virgin knows the secret ways by which grace operates in souls. She also knows the great price which God attaches to sufferings, united to those of the Savior. The encyclical closes with a quote of Bernard of Clairvaux: \\"Amid dangers, difficulties, and doubts, think of Mary, invoke Mary's aid. ...If you follow her, you will not stray; if you entreat her, you will not lose hope; if you reflect upon her, you will not err; if she supports you, you will not fall; if she protects you, you will not fear; if she leads you, you will not grow weary; if she is propitious, you will reach your goal.\\"Second Homily on the Missus est: PL CLXXXIIILe p√®lerinage de Lourdes, 70-71  Consecration to the Immaculate Heart  On October 31, 1942, Pius XII consecrated the human race and later Russia to the Immaculate Heart of Mary. The same day in a radio address he informed the people of Portugal about the apparitions of Fatima, consecrating the human race to the Immaculate Heart of the Virgin with specific mention of Russia.AAS, 1942, 313 On December 8, 1942, the Pontiff officially and solemnly declared this consecration in a ceremony in Saint Peter Basilica in Rome. The Consecration to the Immaculate Heart of Mary took place on October 31, 1942, just before major turning points in World War Two. Pius XII consecrated to Mary not only the Church but the whole human race, as \\"Father of Christianity\\", as representative of Christ, to whom \\"All power is given [...] in heaven and in earth\\" (atthew 28:18 ).At that time, German troops under General Rommel had conquered strategic parts of North Africa and were advancing towards the Suez Canal. In the Pacific, following Pearl Harbor, the Imperial Japanese forces occupied ever increasing territories, and Russia experienced an ever expanding German invasion. In this situation, Pope Pius XII, like his predecessors, put his trust in prayer. On October 31, 1942, he called for a prayer crusade to the Queen of Peace, and dedicated the whole human race and especially Russia to the Immaculate Heart of Mary. In 1944, Pope Pius XII prescribed the Feast of the Immaculate Heart of Mary for the whole Church and placed his pontificate under the special patronage of the Virgin,Munificentissimus Deus 42 In his Apostolic Letter of 7 July 1952, Sacro Vergente, Pius consecrated Russia to the Most Blessed Virgin Mary. On May 1, 1948, in Auspicia quaedam, Pope Pius requested the consecration to the Immaculate Heart of every Catholic family, parish and dioceses. ‚ÄúIt is our wish, consequently, that wherever the opportunity suggests itself, this consecration be made in the various dioceses as well as in each of the parishes and families.\\"Auspicia quaedam, 21AAS 148, 171 Mariology of Pius XII The 1854 dogma of the Immaculate Conception by Pius IX defined the Virgin conceived without sin, as the mother of God and our mother. Pope Pius XII built on this in Mystici corporis, which summarizes his mariology: Maria, whose sinless soul was filled with the divine spirit of Jesus Christ above all other created souls, \\"in the name of the whole human race\\" gave her consent \\"for a spiritual marriage between the Son of God and human nature\\",Office for Holy Week thus elevating human nature beyond the realm of the purely material. She who, according to the flesh, was the mother of our Head, became mother of all His members. Through her powerful prayers, she obtained that the spirit of our Divine Redeemer should be bestowed on the newly founded Church at Pentecost. She is Most Holy Mother of all the members of Christ, and reigns in heaven with her Son, her body and soul refulgent with heavenly glory. Adoption of the dogma of the Assumption In 1950 Pius XII defined the Assumption of Mary as an article of faith for Roman Catholic, the dogma of the assumption: :By the authority of our Lord Jesus Christ, of the Blessed Apostles Peter and Paul, and by our own authority, we pronounce, declare, and define it to be a divinely revealed dogma: that the Immaculate Mother of God, the ever Virgin Mary, having completed the course of her earthly life, was assumed body and soul into heavenly glory.AAS 1950, 753 The dogma of the bodily assumption of the Virgin Mary is the crowning of the theology of Pope Pius XII. It was preceded by the 1946 encyclical Deiparae Virginis Mariae, which requested all Catholic bishops to express their opinion on a possible dogmatization. In this dogmatic statement, the phrase \\"having completed the course of her earthly life\\" leaves open the question of whether the Virgin Mary died before her Assumption, or, whether she was assumed before death; both possibilities are allowed. Mary's Assumption was a divine gift to Mary as Mother of God, and so also testimony to the divine nature of her Son. New Marian feasts Pope Pius XII instituted the feast of the Immaculate Heart of Mary in 1944 to be celebrated on 22 August,Calendarium Romanum (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 1969), p. 94 coinciding with the traditional octave day of the Assumption. (In 1969, Pope Paul VI moved the celebration of the Immaculate Heart of Mary to the Saturday immediately after the Solemnity of the Sacred Heart of Jesus.) Coronation of the Salus Populi Romani icon in Rome by Pope Pius XII in 1954, in association with his announcement of new Marian feast for the Queenship of Mary. In the October 11, 1954, encyclical Ad Caeli Reginam, he introduced a new Marian feast, the Queenship of Mary. Assumed into heaven, so Pope Pius, \\"Mary is with Jesus Christ, her divine son. Mary should be called Queen, not only because of her Divine Motherhood of Jesus Christ, [her only son,] but also because God has willed her to have an exceptional role in the work of our eternal salvation.\\" The encyclical argues, that Christ, because He redeemed us, is our Lord and king by a special title, so the Blessed Virgin also (is our queen), on account of the unique manner in which she assisted in our redemption, by giving of her own substance, by freely offering Him for us, by her singular desire and petition for, and active interest in, our salvation.\\"Ad caeli reginam, 37 At the same time as he closely associated the celebrations of the Immaculate Heart of Mary and the Sacred Heart of Jesus, Pope Paul VI moved the celebration of the Queenship of Mary from 31 May to 22 August, bringing it into association with the feast of her Assumption. Mariological writings In several encyclicals and apostolic letters to the people of Poland and other countries behind the Iron curtain, he expressed certainty that the Blessed Virgin Mary would triumph over her enemies. On September 8, 1953, the encyclical Fulgens corona announced a Marian year for 1954, the centennial of the Dogma of the Immaculate Conception.AAS 1953, 577 Pope Pius XII left open the Mediatrix question, the role of the Virgin in the salvation acts of her son Jesus Christ. In the encyclical Ad caeli reginam he promulgated the feast, Queenship of Mary.AAS 1954, 625 Pius XII, having been consecrated on May 13, 1917, the very day Our Lady of Fatima is believed to have first appeared, consecrated the world to the Immaculate Heart of Mary in 1942, in accordance with the second \\"secret\\" of Our Lady of Fatima. (His remains were to be buried in the crypt of Saint Peter Basilica on the feast day of Our Lady of Fatima, October 13, 1958.) In 1950 and in 1958 he authorized institutions for increased academic research into the veneration of the Blessed Virgin Mary (see below). In 1953, Pope Pius ordered a Marian year for 1954, the first in Church history. The year was filled with Marian initiatives, in the areas of mariology, cultural events, charity and social gatherings. In his encyclicals Fulgens corona and Ad Caeli Reginam he presented a synthesis of the mariology of the Church and warned against excesses and timid under-representation of the Catholic faith. Mariological research Pius strongly supported Marian research with the foundation or enlargement of a number of research centers in Rome. In 1950 and in 1958 he authorized institutions for increased academic research into the veneration of Mary. He supported or rewarded Mariological research of scholars like Gabriel Roschini, Raimondo Spiazzi, Otto Faller and Sebastian Tromp. Roschini was named head of the Marianum, Spiazzi and Tromp were asked to help write his encyclicals, Faller received a papal medal for his work. The research centers were: * Academia Mariana Salesiana: he granted the foundation of the Academia Mariana Salesiana which is a part of a papal university. The Academy supports Salesian studies with the aim of furthering the veneration of the Blessed Virgin in the tradition of John Bosco. * Centro Mariano Montfortano: in 1950, the Centro Mariano Montfortano was moved from Bergamo to Rome. The Centro promulgates the teachings of Louis de Montfort, who was earlier canonized by Pius XII. It publishes the monthly Madre e Regina which promulgates the Marian orientation of Montfort. * Marianum was created in 1950 and entrusted to the Order of Servites. It is authorized to grant all academic degrees including a doctorate in theology. Since 1976, every two years the Marianum organizes international conferences to find modern formulations which approximate the mystery of Mary. * Collegamento Mariano Nazionale (1958) was the last Marian initiative of Pope Pius XII. It coordinates activities of Marian centres in Italy and organizes Marian pilgrimages and Marian study weeks for priests. In addition it started Marian youth gatherings and publishes the Journal Madonna. Of these organizations, the Marianum is the most active marilogical centre in Rome.at Viale 30 Aprile- 6, 00153, Rome This pontifical Catholic institute was founded by Father Gabriel Roschini (who then directed it for several years) under the direction of Pope Pius XII in 1950. At the Marianum, one can get a master's degree in Mariology (2-year academic program) and also a doctorate in Mariology. This Mariological facility has a library with more than 85,000 volumes on Mariology and a number of magazines and journals of theological and Mariological concern. Marianum is also the name of the prestigious journal of Marian theology, previously founded by Father Roschini in 1939. =John XXIII= On November 30, 1934, Angelo Roncalli was appointed Apostolic Delegate to Turkey. Archbishop Roncalli had the words Ad Jesum per Mariam inscribed above his chapel in the Apostolic Delegation in Istanbul as he believed that Mariology was the key to unity with the Orthodox; the Theotokos being the essential part of a common heritage. When asked, in the spring of 1954, for his opinion regarding the proposed new feast of the Queenship of Mary, Cardinal Roncalli responded that he felt it unnecessary, and from an ecumenical perspective counter-productive.Alberigo, A. and G.: GiovanniXXIII, profezia nellafidelt& (Brescia, 1978), p. 489 For the same reasons, later as Pope, he declined a request for a dogmatic definition of the \\"spiritual maternity of Mary\\".Lettere 1958-63, Capovilla, Loris (ed): (Rome, 1978), p. 520 Suffering from stomach cancer at the end of his life, Pope John's meditation on the Assumption was deeply Christological. \\"The mystery of the Assumption brings home the thought of death, of our death, and it diffuses within us a mood of peaceful abandonment; it familiarizes us with and reconciles us to the idea that the Lord will be present in our death agony, to gather up into his hands our immortal soul.\\"Il rosario con papa Giovanni, Capovilla, Loris (ed): (Rome, 1979), p 56 =Paul VI= Pope Paul VI (1963‚Äì1978) attempted to present the Marian teachings of the Church in view of her new ecumenical orientation. In his inaugural encyclical Ecclesiam Suam (section below), the Pope called Mary the ideal of Christian perfection. He regards ‚Äúdevotion to the Mother of God as of paramount importance in living the life of the Gospel.‚ÄùEcclesiam Suam 58 During his speech upon the closing of the third session of the Second Vatican Council on November 21, 1964, Paul VI proclaimed \\"Mary the Most Holy Mother of the Church, that is, the Mother of the whole People of God, both the faithful and the pastors.\\"Leo Cardinal Scheffczyk, Vaticanum II, in Remigius B√§umer, Leo Scheffczyk (Hrsg.) Marienlexikon Gesamtausgabe, Institutum Marianum Regensburg, 1994, p. 568 Ren√© Laurentin said that the Theological Commission had considered and rejected the title \\"Mother of the Church\\" not because they thought it was wrong, but because it was fatally prone to misunderstanding, and open to the suggestion that it appeared to place Mary outside the Church.Laurentin, R., Bilan du concile (Paris, 1966), p 160 The encyclical Mense maio from April 29, 1965, focused on the Virgin Mary, to whom traditionally the month of May is dedicated as the Mother of God. Paul VI writes that Mary is rightly to be regarded as the way by which people are led to Christ. Therefore, the person who encounters Mary cannot help but encounter Christ.Mense maio, 1 He writes that the Queen of Heaven is entrusted by God, as administrator of his compassion.Mense maio, 2 In his 1966 encyclical Christi Matri, he recommends the rosary in light of the Vietnam War and the dangers of atomic conflicts.Vietnam War era: people and perspectives by Mitchell K. Hall 2009 p. 106 The Queen of Peace and Mother of the Church should be invoked: \\"Nothing seems more appropriate and valuable than to have the prayers of the whole Christian family rise to the Mother of God, who is invoked as the Queen of Peace, begging her to pour forth abundant gifts of her maternal goodness in the midst of so many great trials and hardships. We want constant and devout prayers to be offered to her whom We declared Mother of the Church, its spiritual parent, during the celebration of the Second Vatican Council.\\"Christi Matri 8 Paul VI taught that the rosary is a summary of gospel teaching. His new Missal includes all new Marian prayers. And in his 1974 exhortation Marialis Cultus, he again promotes Marian devotions, highlighting the Angelus and Rosary prayers. Mary deserves the devotions because she is the mother of graces and because of her unique role in redemption. On the fiftieth anniversary of the apparition in Fatima, Paul VI made a pilgrimage there, the first ever by a Pope. There, he linked the veneration of Mary to her role in the salvation of the human race. =John Paul II= John Paul II coat of arms with a Marian Cross Pope John Paul II The direction of the Catholic Church during the last part of the 20th century was dominated by the views of Pope John Paul II, whose perspective had a very strong Marian emphasis.Mary's pope: John Paul II, Mary, and the church since Vatican II by Antoine Nachef 2000 page 2The Vision of John Paul II: Assessing His Thought and Influence by Gerard Mannion 2008 pages 1 and 62 And he deliberately reflected his Marian views within the design of his coat of arms by using a Marian Cross. According to the L‚ÄôOsservatore Romano, the use of the Marian Cross on his coat of arms was a departure from traditional heraldry models and was intended to emphasize the presence of the Virgin Mary under the Cross in Calvary and her special participation in the process of redemption. As a young man, Karol Wojty≈Ça was deeply influenced by the writings of the French priest Louis-Marie Grignion de Montfort; especially Montfort's True Devotion to Mary. Peter Hebblethwaite says that John Paul's Marian devotion is a combination of seventeenth-century French spirituality and Polish nationalism, where being Catholic is part of Polish identity and Mary is revered as the \\"Queen of Poland\\". Hebblethwaits suggests that this approach might resonate less outside of the unique Polish national experience. Pope John Paul II attributed his survival of an assassination attempt on May 13, 1981, (the Feast of Our Lady of Fatima) to the protection of Mary. A year later, he made a pilgrimage to Portugal in thanksgiving.Hebblethwaite, Peter. \\"The Mariology of Three Popes\\", Mary in Christian Tradition, p. 55 In the 1987 encyclical Redemptoris Mater and at a general audience on September 17, 1997, Pope John Paul II reiterated the title Mary, Mother of the Church.Blessed Virgin Is Mother Of The Church The encyclical is a summary of modern Mariology, making some novel points. According to John Paul, the Mother of the Redeemer has a precise place in the plan of salvation. : > If the greeting and the name \\"full of grace\\" say all this, in the context of > the angel's announcement they refer first of all to the election of Mary as > Mother of the Son of God. But at the same time the \\"fullness of grace\\" > indicates all the supernatural munificence from which Mary benefits by being > chosen and destined to be the Mother of Christ. If this election is > fundamental for the accomplishment of God's salvific designs for humanity, > and if the eternal choice in Christ and the vocation to the dignity of > adopted children is the destiny of everyone, then the election of Mary is > wholly exceptional and unique. Hence also the singularity and uniqueness of > her place in the mystery of Christ.Redemptoris Mater 9 The 2002 apostolic letter Rosarium Virginis Mariae of Pope John Paul II on the Rosary further communicated his Marian focus as he explained how his personal motto Totus Tuus was inspired by St. Louis de Montfort's doctrine on the excellence of Marian devotion and total consecration. In Rosarium Virginis Mariae, Pope John Paul II quoted Louis de Montfort, and said: > Our entire perfection consists in being conformed, united and consecrated to > Jesus Christ. Hence the most perfect of all devotions is undoubtedly that > which conforms, unites and consecrates us most perfectly to Jesus Christ. > Now, since Mary is of all creatures the one most conformed to Jesus Christ, > it follows that among all devotions that which most consecrates and conforms > a soul to our Lord is devotion to Mary, his Holy Mother, and that the more a > soul is consecrated to her the more will it be consecrated to Jesus > Christ.Pope John Paul II, Apostolic Letter Rosarium Virginis Mariae =Benedict XVI= Pope Benedict XVI continued the program of Pope John Paul II for a redirection of the whole Church to ensure an authentic approach to Christology via a return to the \\"whole truth about Mary\\".Burke, Raymond L.; et al. (2008). Mariology: A Guide for Priests, Deacons, Seminarians, and Consecrated Persons page xxi As Cardinal Ratzinger, he wrote: > It is necessary to go back to Mary if we want to return to that \\"truth about > Jesus Christ,\\" \\"truth about the Church\\" and \\"truth about man\\". =Pope Francis= In a homily, Francis compared Mary at the foot of the Cross with the mothers of prisoners he had met in Buenos Aires. But as regards adding more titles to Mary, Francis observed that \\"she never wanted for herself something that was of her son. [...] She never introduced herself as co-redemptrix\\". Francis called the invention of new titles and dogmas \\"nonsense\\".

The span of the record includes the creation of the Apostolic Camera and the effects of the Gregorian Reform.Levillain, 2002, p. 940. The work constitutes the \\"latest and most authoritative of a series of attempts, starting in the eleventh century, to keep an accurate record of the financial claims of the Roman church\\". According to historian J. Rousset de Pina, the book was \\"the most effective instrument and [...] the most significant document of ecclesiastical centralization\\" in the central Middle Ages. Michael Ott considers the Liber Censuum \\"perhaps the most valuable source for the history of papal economics during the Middle Ages\\". History The document has its roots in the Polyptych of Pope Gelasius I, created at the end of the 5th century and continued for the next four centuries. The Liber Censuum proper was assembled in 1192 by Cencius Camerarius (future Pope Honorius III), papal chamberlain to Pope Clement III and Pope Celestine III, and his assistant, William Rofio, the clerk of the papal camera. The document compiled information contained in the Collectio canonum of Cardinal Deusdedit (1087), the Liber politicus of the Canon of St. Peter Benedict (c. 1140), dossiers of the former chamberlain Boson (1149‚Äì1178), and the Gesta pauperis scolaris of Cardinal Albinus (1188). Albinus' Gesta was the \\"most ambitious\\" of the Liber Censuum predecessor records, containing‚Äîaccording to Albinus‚Äî\\"whatever I knew or found in books of antiquities or what I myself heard and saw concerning the rights of St. Peter\\". The Liber Censuum also incorporates information from a contemporary general census and rent table of church properties organized by diocese, the Ordo romanus (a description of religious ceremonies), as it pertains to the distribution of payments to the curia during such ceremonies, and works of pontifical history such as the Liber pontificalis.Levillain, 2002, p. 940-941. The earliest documentary evidence for the use of such a document of papal property rights goes back even earlier to an 1163/1164 letter from Pope Alexander III to the abbot of Lagny-sur-Marne requesting an annual payment of one ounce of gold, owed according to \\"a certain work among the books of the apostolic see\\". Although this specific claim dated to the time of Pope Urban II, the abbot rejected it and there is no evidence Alexander III pursued it further. Such incidences are likely what Cencius refers to in the preface of the Liber Censuum as the \\"no little damage and loss\\" incurred by the church as a result of earlier records being \\"incomplete and neither written nor arranged authentically\\". Furthermore, the Liber Censuum was compiled at a time when the papal patrimony was threatened by the Staufen emperor and individual payments from sources throughout the continent were being reduced by the evasiveness of payers and the inefficiency of the apostolic camera. Contents The eighteen volumes of the Liber Censuum are divided between: census and rent tables (vol. 1-7), lists of bishoprics and monasteries directly administered by the Holy See (vol. 8), the Mirabilia, a mythical description of the city of Rome (vol. 9), a version of the Ordo romanus (vol. 10-11), pontifical chronicles (vol. 12-13), and a chartulary (vol. 14-18).Levillain, 2002, p. 941. The dating of the Liber Censuum to 1192 comports with the date given in the work's prologue, although this date may only be accurate for the record of taxes owed to the Holy See.Bolton and Duggan, 2003, p. 55. For example, the Vita Gregorii IX was inserted into the codex of the Liber Censuum between 1254 and 1265, likely during the tenure of Pope Gregory IX's nephew Niccol√≤ as camerarius between 1255 and 1261.Andrews et al., 2004, p. 154. The original version of the Liber Censuum by Cardinal Cencius begins: :Incipit liber censuum Rom. Eccl. a Centio Camerario compositus, secundum antiquorum patrum Regesta et memorialia diversa. A. incarn. dni MCXCII. Pont. Celestini Pp. III. A. II. The Liber Censuum described itself as an authoritative list of \\"those monasteries, hospitals [...] cities, castles, manors [...] or those kings and princes belonging to the jurisdiction and property of St. Peter and the holy Roman church and owing census and how much they ought to pay\\".Robinson, 1990, p. 261. The value of the rights recorded in the Liber Censuum is difficult to quantify exactly, and in any case, unlikely to have been paid in full.Morris, 1991, p. 215. V. Pfaff, estimating historical exchange rates, assessed the value of the revenue cited in the Liber Censuum as 1,214 gold ounces, a sum that would comprise less than 5% of Richard I of England's annual income. The Liber Censuum, however, does not include several sources of papal revenue, in particular those collected in-kind and the revenues of the Basilicas of Rome. Later editions and legacy Papal historians regard the Liber Censuum as well-organized compared to the works which preceded it, and it includes empty spaces for anticipated updating. The intent was to allow future camerarii to add future entries \\"until the end of the world\\". The original version of the Liber Censuum was identified by Paul Fabre in the Vatican Library (ms Vat. Lat. 8486), with its blank spaces having been exhausted during the pontificate of Cencius (who was elected Pope Honorius III) and five new volumes having been added to the beginning and end of the document. A new version of the Liber Censuum was compiled by Cardinal Nicholas Roselli (d. 1362) in the 14th century.Reynolds et al., 2004, p. 291. A 1228 version of the Liber censuum in the library of Florence (ms Riccard. 228) was updated through the Avignon Papacy. By the end of the 13th century the addition of the dossiers of the cities of the Papal States and other papal biographies swelled the document to thirty-three volumes. A copy of the Liber censuum, along with a tiara, was given by Antipope Clement VIII to the legate of Pope Martin V in 1429 as a sign of submission. Modern, edited versions of the Liber Censuum, reconstructed as their editors though the original codex of Cencius would have appeared, have been produced by Fabre and Louis Duchesne (1910).Robinson, 1990, p. 262. Fabre's identification of other portions of the Liber Censuum, for example the alleged acquiescence of King Harthacanute to ecclesiastical taxation, are more controversial.

Established on March 12, 1919 as Colegio de la Se√±ora de la Consolacion by three Augustinian sisters - Sor Tomasa de la Sagrada Familia, Sor Maria Teresa de Jesus and Sor Alfonsa de la Santisima Trinidad, the college is the oldest institution of higher education in the province. LCCB offers preschool, elementary, junior & senior high school, short-term, undergraduate and post-graduate courses. The school has three patrons - Our Lady of Consolation, St. Augustine of Hippo and St. Monica. History Upon the request of Jaro Bishop, Dennis Dougherty, the three sisters began apostolate work in Negros due to the significant Aglipayan presence in the province. On July 15, 1919, Colegio de la Se√±ora de la Consolacion accepted its first 86 students, 36 of whom were interns who lived in the school dormitory. It started as an all-girls school back then. The school is named in honor of the Virgin Mary, Consoler of the Afflicted. Organization and Administration School administration and organization is divided into two - The Integrated School and the Schools of the College Department. Academics =Integrated School= K-12 Education based on the 2011 Basic Education Curriculum is followed in the Day School System, a system called Unique by Design is applied by teachers. Special classes in Math and Science are offered, Advanced Math and Science to students part of the Cr√®me Section starting from the Freshmen Batch of 2011‚Äì2012. Religious education is also implemented in the education system along with bookkeeping, animation and film making applied. A strict academic rule is followed that if students who get grades of 78 and below, but not below 76 in their report card are required to take remedial classes, and students who receive a general average grade of below 78 at the end of the year, are required to take remedial classes in the summer. By the school year 2012‚Äì2013, a policy was pushed by the administration to utilize personal computers and the Internet in the curriculum. This policy led to the adoption of the DIWA learning system - GENYO e-learning System, which prompted the change of the classroom setting in the core subjects. Furthermore, plasma TVs and audio-visual materials used in teaching students were encouraged after the Galo wing renovation of the Integrated School Building was done. Changes in time schedules were also made - from the traditional 7:30am until 5:00pm (the most 5:30pm) class schedules, the new 8:00am‚Äì4:00pm class schedules was adopted. Wifi hot spots and public computers were installed in the College campus for students to use in their academic needs. =Night High School= Four (4) Year High School Education based on the 2011 Basic Education Curriculum is also followed in the Night High School Program. The students who are enrolled in this program are financially challenged but deserving ones. The method of teaching applied is not limited to tutorials given by teachers but students are expected to learn on their own as there is limitation to tutorials and lectures given by the teachers. Teachers who teach in this program are volunteers from the education departments of the institution. Classes usually start after the class hours of the Integrated School. =College= The College Department is composed of four tertiary level schools: School of Business and Information Technology; School of Architecture, Fine Arts and Interior Design; School of Liberal Arts and Education and School of Hospitality and Tourism Management. The college also offers various programs under the LCCB Graduate School. *School of Architecture, Fine Arts and Interior Design (SARFAID) - BS Architecture, BS Interior Design and BFA in Advertising/Industrial Design/Painting/Digital Media Arts *School of Hospitality and Tourism Management (SHTM) - BS Tourism, BS Hospitality Management *School of Business and Information Technology (SBIT) - BS Accounting Technology, BS Human Resource Management, BS Marketing Management, BS Information Technology, BS Computer Science http://www.lcc.edu.ph/SBIT/ *School of Sciences, Liberal Arts and Teacher Education (SLATE) - AB English, Bachelor of Library & Information Science, BS Psychology, BS Biology, BS Technical Teacher Education, BS Elementary Education, BS Secondary Education http://slae.webs.com/ *School of Graduate Studies and Continuing Education - MBA, Master of Arts in Educational Management, Master of Arts in Religious Studies, Master of Arts in Education, Doctor in Business Administration, Master of Science in Architecture, Master of Science in Hospitality Management, Master of Arts in Guidance and Counseling. Campus LCCB Main Campus The Main Campus for both the Integrated School and College is located in Downtown Bacolod along the streets of Rizal (College) and Galo-Gatuslao (Integrated School). The buildings that compose the campus are the Basic Education Department Building divided into two wings, the Mother Consuelo Barcelo Activities Center, the main college building, the Sta. Monica Building and the quadrangle. *The Integrated School Building - Formerly called Basic Education Department Building, divided into two wings, the Gatuslao Wing which faces the Gatuslao St. and is occupied by the Elementary classes of Grades 1-10 this is where the Chapel and the Elementary Faculty is located, this is probably the oldest structure that exists in the campus. The Galo Wing which faces Galo St. is occupied by the High School Department from Grades 7 and 8, the Pre-school and Kindergarten Department, High School faculty, the Center for Augustinian Formation, President's Office, Grade School and High School Computer Laboratories are all located here. In the meeting point of these two wings - the administration, principal and the guidance offices are located. In the evening the Night High School and the college students occupy the rooms in both wings. Renovation has been completed by the A.Y. 2012-2013, WiFi hotspots are found in the Gatuslao Wing. The renovation has prompted Administration to order installation of air conditioning systems in the classrooms. LED Lights are installed in the renovated wing to cut energy costs. It is where the Main Gate and Facade is located. The facade was designed by Japanese Engineer Paul Ishiwata in 1938. The facade's model is based on the White House of the United States, and followed Old English and early American Colonial designs. *Main College Building - Consists of laboratories both utilized by the college and the integrated school department, it composes of an internet center, audio-visual room, speech laboratory, Luisa Medel Little theatre, the Auditorium, finance office, the Clinic, administration offices of the college department and respective classrooms. *The Mother Consuelo Barcelo Activities Center - Consists the canteen, print center, college and high school library, respective classrooms of the college and the audio-visual center.

Description Subularia monticola forms cushions or mats in moist areas in upland rainforests and moorland, such as the edges of ponds and bogs, or muddy footpaths, though it may grow underwater in some cases. It can form mats in permanently wet areas. It is a short-lived plant that lacks leaves in its early development, instead having just a stem and taproot. It grows to 5 to 16 centimeters (2 to 6 inches). It produces tiny white flowers. Distribution Subularia monticola is an African high-altitude plant, growing at altitudes of around 2,750 to 4,750 meters (9,000 to 15,600 feet) above sea-level. Some examples will serve to demonstrate the range of environments in which it thrives: On Mount Kilimanjaro, which is mostly arid, Subularia monticola grows in oases made by rain or melted snow collecting in depressions, where it forms continuous carpets of vegetation alongside Eriocaulon volkensii, Cyperaceae and Bulliarda elatinoides. On Mount Kenya, cracks formed by daily freezing and thawing of ice provide a refuge for Subularia monticola seedlings. It also forms short, dense mats on the occasionally flooded mudflats around Lake Kimilili, a lake 4150 meters above sea-level on the Kenya-Uganda border.

She had previously competed in Survivor: Cook Islands in which she placed sixth, and later was the runner-up in Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains. In 2020, she competed on the show's 40th season, Survivor: Winners at War, where she placed 16th. She is widely considered by fans and critics to be one of the most skilled contestants ever to participate. From July 7, 2011 to October 14, 2011, Shallow starred in CBS's Around the World for Free. From 2013 to 2014, she was the host of Survivor Live on CBS.com, a weekly web-exclusive series where she interviews the voted off castaways from Survivor and chats with other special guests such as former players. Biography Shallow was born September 21, 1982 in Vero Beach, Florida, and lived there until the age of 11, when her family moved to Atlanta. She attended the University of Georgia, and received a Bachelor of Arts degree in journalism. Shallow began competing in boxing in 2004. She and some fellow boxers created a non-profit organization titled \\"Knockouts for Girls\\", a charity that provides scholarships and boxing lessons for underprivileged girls. In 2009, Shallow and fellow Survivor contestant Amanda Kimmel appeared in the movie Into the Blue 2 (as herself). In 2010, Shallow hosted a Survivor preview show for the 21st season, Survivor: Nicaragua. Shallow was the latest host of the webseries Around the World For Free, which began airing on July 5, 2011. Shallow is a certified teacher of Hatha Yoga. Survivor Shallow originally auditioned for The Amazing Race along with her friend. They did not make the final cut. CBS producers, however, remembered her from her auditions and then approached her to take part in Survivor, which she gladly accepted. =Cook Islands= Shallow originally appeared as part of the Rarotonga (Raro) tribe, which represented Caucasians, along with Adam Gentry, Jonathan Penner, Jessica \\"Flicka\\" Smith, and Candice Woodcock. Her tribe did not face any danger for the first six days as they had won immunity. At the end of the second immunity challenge, Billy Garcia of the Aitutaki (Aitu) tribe told Shallow and Woodcock that he was next to go. Woodcock replied, \\"We love you,\\" and Garcia believed that Woodcock had fallen in love with him. Shallow was particularly allied with Gentry and Woodcock, who truly were romantically involved. When the four tribes were merged into two, Shallow and Gentry remained in Raro while their other tribe mates were sent to Aitu. Despite being stronger in number, the new Raro continually lost in challenges. Shallow pressed for the elimination of J.P. Calderon, whom she thought as arrogant, and he became the fourth person voted out despite his physical strength. Shallow survived her tribe's next three Tribal Councils as Calderon, Stephannie Favor, and Cristina Coria were each voted off. When the contestants were down to 12, a \\"Mutiny\\" twist was presented where anybody could change tribe affiliations, and for the first time it was accepted. Shallow's former tribe mates Penner and Woodcock decided to jump back to Raro, thus putting all remaining Caucasian contestants on the same tribe again. Raro lost the next two Immunity challenges, but Shallow remained loyal to her original Raro tribemates by eliminating Brad Virata, Rebecca Borman, and Jenny Guzon-Bae. At the merge, despite coming with a 5‚Äì4 member advantage over Aitu, Shallow found herself in the minority as Penner betrayed his former tribe mates and joined the Aitu Four in voting out Nate Gonzalez. She became angry with Penner, and a day after his betrayal, when she cut her thumb with a machete while cutting a coconut, she said that she was imagining the coconut was Penner's head. After alliance member Woodcock was eliminated, Shallow and Gentry found themselves fighting for survival. Despite being on the outside, Shallow was able to retain her strength and win two reward challenges, one being the \\"loved one\\" challenge. This worried the Aitu Four, who were dissatisfied with how Gentry and Shallow lay around camp sleeping, while they worked and got their food. In an attempt to stay in the game, Gentry and Shallow talked to Yul Kwon about voting out Penner first in exchange for their jury votes, a plan which succeeded. On day 36, Shallow was finally voted out in a 4‚Äì2 vote when the Aitu Four saw her craftiness as more of a threat than Gentry's physical strength. As a juror, she cast her vote for eventual runner-up Ozzy Lusth. Shallow was noted for being a flirt throughout the season. She flirted with Gonzalez to ensure his loyalty, had 'cuddle sessions' with Gentry, and sat naked in a hot tub with Kwon and Lusth during a challenge reward. =Micronesia= Shallow returned as a \\"Favorite\\" and part of the Malakal tribe. She formed a close bond with James Clement and the two formed an alliance with another couple consisting of Amanda Kimmel and Ozzy Lusth. After their tribe lost the first Immunity Challenge, they tried swinging Jonny Fairplay over to their side to gain a majority over the alliance of Yau-Man Chan, Ami Cusack, Eliza Orlins, and Jonathan Penner. However, Fairplay was voted out instead as per his wishes, since he was aching to return home to his pregnant girlfriend. Shallow then made a pact with Cirie Fields to go all the way to the Final Three with Kimmel. After losing the third Immunity Challenge, Shallow was targeted by the opposing alliance, but her own alliance (now with Fields) succeeded in voting off strategic threat Chan. At the tribal switch, Shallow and Clement were separated from their alliance as they moved to Airai. However, she remained safe as her tribe won the remaining tribal Immunity Challenges. On day 20, she made a deal with Natalie Bolton for an alliance with Clement and Alexis Jones, plus a Final Four deal with Jones and Kimmel; Bolton accepted both deals. At the merge, Shallow found herself in a good position as she was allied with six (Jones, Kimmel, Fields, Bolton, Lusth, Clement) of the nine people left. During the tenth Immunity Challenge, Shallow convinced Jason Siska to step down from the challenge so that she could win Immunity, which worked (under the condition that the tribe would not vote off Siska). However, her \\"Couples Alliance\\" decided to go back on their word and they targeted Siska. However, Fields saw this as an opportunity to blindside physical threat Lusth instead, and she needed Shallow's help for it to work. Shallow agreed to this and recruited her Airai female allies Bolton and Jones to the plan, and Lusth was voted off 5‚Äì4. Afterward, Shallow found herself in a failed attempt to patch things up with Clement and Kimmel (who kept her distrust to herself). The five remaining women then formed an alliance to vote off the men, starting with Siska. However, when Clement was evacuated and Erik Reichenbach won Immunity, they were forced to vote off one of their own. Kimmel was the intended target, a plan of which Shallow did not want any part. So she helped Kimmel find the Hidden Immunity Idol (which was buried under the tribal flag) and together, they voted off possible jury threat Jones. Shallow made it all the way to the Final Three with Fields and Kimmel (as promised). However, she was heartbroken to learn that only two of them would face the jury. She was eliminated first at the Final Immunity Challenge but was chosen to be in the Final Two by Kimmel as Kimmel felt that Fields would be extremely tough to beat at the Final Tribal Council. At the Final Tribal Council, Shallow convinced the jury to vote for her because of her aggressive game play compared to her previous season. Despite being accused of being a mean person by Orlins and a backstabber by Lusth, the jury decided to award Shallow the title of Sole Survivor with a close vote of 5‚Äì3, getting votes from Orlins, Siska, Jones, Bolton, and Fields. =Heroes vs. Villains= Shallow returned to play Survivor for a third time as a part of the Villains tribe. She quickly accepted an alliance with Russell Hantz and Danielle DiLorenzo. On day 18, the Villains lost immunity, and the alliance of Shallow, Hantz, and DiLorenzo were still struggling to gain control of the game. They finally gained control when they persuaded Jerri Manthey to switch sides and vote out Hantz's rival, Rob Mariano. Because the Villains had yet to vote out a female member at that point in the game, the Heroes assumed that the Villains tribe was being run by an all-women alliance, led by Shallow. When the Villains lost immunity again on day 21, they decided to further confirm the Heroes' belief of that, by voting out Benjamin \\"Coach\\" Wade. Shallow and DiLorenzo both found the hidden immunity idol together and decided not to tell Hantz. On day 24, the Villains lost immunity again and James \\"J. T.\\" Thomas Jr. gave his idol to Hantz, in hopes that he would use it to vote out Shallow. Hantz, however, showed it to Shallow, along with DiLorenzo and Manthey. On day 25, the Heroes and Villains merged into Yin Yang and went to live at the old Heroes camp. Shallow and Hantz came up with this story that they both played their idol, negating all votes, and that in the re-vote, they eliminated Courtney Yates. The new tribe quickly alienated Shallow, making her swear to get revenge on all of the Heroes. For the immunity challenge on day 27, she and DiLorenzo were the last two remaining. Shallow decided to concede immunity, because she already had one idol. Before Tribal Council, Hantz gave her his idol, as well. She then went and talked to Kimmel, who warned that Shallow should play the idol for herself. But at Tribal Council, Shallow, not trusting Kimmel's warning, played both idols on Sandra Diaz-Twine and Manthey, sending Thomas home in a 5‚Äì0 vote. On day 33, Hantz won immunity, and decided to turn on his alliance. He tried to pit Shallow and DiLorenzo against each other, but failed. He then aligned with the Heroes to vote DiLorenzo out, and with some help from Manthey, DiLorenzo was voted out in a 4‚Äì3 vote. He then aligned with the Heroes again and decided to target Shallow. However, his plan was ruined when she won immunity on day 36. Shallow then won her third challenge on day 37, and they voted the last Hero, Colby Donaldson, out of the game in a 4‚Äì1 vote. After Shallow failed to win the final immunity challenge, it seemed that she would be voted out, since everyone wanted her gone. She, on the other hand, wanted to get rid of Diaz-Twine, thinking she would get a lot of votes in the end. However, the four remaining players voted out Manthey in a 3‚Äì1 vote; Hantz had believed he would get her vote to win Sole Survivor. In the end, Shallow came in second, gaining the jury votes of fellow Villains Wade, DiLorenzo, and Manthey. She beat out Hantz, who received zero votes, but was defeated by Diaz-Twine, who got the votes of all the Heroes, plus Yates, who was in an alliance with Diaz-Twine while still in the game and Diaz-Twine‚Äôs heroic gameplay. By the end of Heroes vs. Villains, Shallow had played a total of 114 days on Survivor, the most at that time. =Winners at War= Shallow once again returned to compete on the show's 40th season, Survivor: Winners at War. She was a member of the Sele tribe and aligned with fellow old schoolers Boston Rob Mariano, Ethan Zohn, and Danni Boatwright. However, when Sele lost immunity on day 6, Boatright felt betrayed by Shallow and told Mariano to target Shallow instead of one of the new school players. Mariano told Shallow this plan, and Boatright was voted out unanimously. Shallow was able to survive a few more votes until the tribe swap. After the swap, she remained on Sele along with former Sele member Michele Fitzgerald and three former Dakal members‚ÄîYul Kwon, Nick Wilson, and Wendell Holland. After losing the second immunity challenge as new tribes, Shallow found herself in the minority along with Fitzgerald. She was unsuccessful in convincing Wilson to flip and was voted out in episode 6 in a 3-2 vote, becoming the seventh person sent to the Edge of Extinction. She bequeathed her fire tokens to Fitzgerald. Shallow's journey for this season came to an end on day 35 after failing to win the chance to re-enter the game in the second and final Edge of Extinction challenge. As a juror, she cast her vote for eventual runner-up Natalie Anderson. With 149 days played over four seasons, Shallow had played the second-longest Survivor career, only behind Mariano's 152, both of which surpassed the previous record set by Ozzy Lusth after his participation in Survivor: Game Changers in 2017, at 128. =Reception= Shallow was one of the first five inductees into the \\"Survivor Hall of Fame\\" in the year 2010, alongside Hantz, Mariano, Diaz-Twine, and Richard Hatch. She is also one of only eight players to make it to Final Tribal Council more than once, along with Hantz, Mariano, Diaz-Twine, Kimmel, Fitzgerald, Anderson, and Tony Vlachos. Reality TV podcaster and former Survivor contestant Rob Cesternino twice conducted online polls (in 2011 and 2014) for the greatest contestant in the show's history; Shallow won both times the poll was held. She has also performed well in the awards ceremony known as the \\"Ozcars,\\" from prominent Survivor fan site \\"Survivor Oz;\\" ever since the first awards in 2012, Shallow has always won the award for \\"Sexiest Female of All Time,\\" and in 2013, she also won the two biggest awards of \\"Greatest Player of All Time\\" and \\"Best Winner.\\" In the official issue of CBS Watch commemorating the 15th anniversary of Survivor, Shallow was voted by viewers as the fourth greatest contestant in the history of the series (only behind Cesternino, Hantz, and Mariano), and was the highest-ranking female contestant. Also, she was the only three-time contestant in the top ten to have all three of her seasons also be ranked by viewers as among the top ten greatest seasons of all time‚ÄîCook Islands was ranked tenth, Micronesia was ranked third, and Heroes vs. Villains was ranked first. In addition, she came in second in the same magazine's poll for the most attractive female contestant, only behind Brenda Lowe of Survivor: Nicaragua and Survivor: Caramoan. Accordingly, Shallow was the only female contestant to appear in both polls, and one of only two contestants overall to appear in the \\"greatest players\\" poll and one of the \\"most attractive\\" polls, the other being Lusth, her fellow Cook Islands and Micronesia player. In 2015, host Jeff Probst named Shallow one of his top ten favorite Survivor winners, and one of his top four favorite female winners. Personal life In 2014, Shallow began dating fellow Survivor alum John Fincher, who had appeared on Survivor: Samoa. They announced their engagement in January 2017 and married on July 16, 2017. They had a daughter in July 2018.

TT8 was one of the greatest archaeological discoveries of ancient Egypt, one of few tombs of nobility to survive intact. It was discovered by Arthur Weigall and Ernesto Schiaparelli in 1906 on behalf of the Italian Archaeological Mission. Its discoverers used 250 workers to dig in pursuit of the tomb for several weeks. The pyramid-chapel of Kha and Merit was already well-known for many years; scenes from the chapel had already been copied in the 19th century by several Egyptologists, including John Gardiner Wilkinson and Karl Lepsius.\\"Deir El Medina: The Painted Tombs\\" in Christine Hobson, Exploring the World of the Pharaohs: A complete guide to Ancient Egypt, Thames & Hudson, 1993 paperback, p.118 Egyptologists also knew that Kha was an important foreman at Deir El-Medina, where he was responsible for projects constructed during the reigns of Amenhotep II, Thutmose IV and Amenhotep III.Hobson, p.118 The pyramidion of the chapel had been removed by an earlier visitor and was in the Louvre Museum.Hobson, p.119 Schiaparelli was surprised to discover the tomb in the isolated cliffs surrounding the village and not in the immediate proximity of the chapel itself, as was conventionally the case for other burials of Egyptian nobility. Tomb The items found in the tomb show that Kha and Merit were quite wealthy during their lifetime. Unlike the more chaotic burial of Tutankhamun, the burials of Kha and Merit were carefully planned out. Important items were covered by dust sheets and the floor was swept by the last person to leave the tomb. The coffins of Kha and Merit were buried in two nested coffins; Kha's mummy was tightly wrapped and several items of jewelry were included within the wrappings. The two anthropoid coffins of Kha are excellent examples of the wealth and technically brilliant workmanship of the arts during the reign of Amenhotep III. Kha's outer coffin \\"was covered with black bitumen, with the face, hands, alternate stripes of the wig, bands of inscriptions and figures of funerary gods [all] in gilded gesso.\\"Ernesto Schiaparelli, La tomba intatta dell'architeto Cha.

Her mummy was loosely wrapped with funerary jewellery. A tomb of this magnitude would have taken years to prepare, a process that Kha certainly oversaw during his lifetime. Unexpectedly predeceased by Merit, Kha donated his own coffin to his wife. Since it was too big for Merit‚Äôs mummy, Kha was forced to pack linens, monogrammed for him, around her mummy. Merit's single coffin combines features of Kha's inner and outer coffins; \\"the lid is entirely gilded, but the box is covered with black bitumen, with only the figures and inscriptions gilded.\\" Both Kha's and Merit's anthropoid coffins were contained within Middle Kingdom style \\"rectangular outer coffins covered with black bitumen and having vaulted, gable-ended lids.\\" Kha's coffin was mounted on sledge runners, notes Ernesto Schiaparelli in his 1927 publication report of the discovery.Schiaparelli, pp.17-20 & 28, figures 18 & 27 The tomb was furnished with all the objects necessary in the afterlife. Ointments and kohl were regarded as a necessary part of hygiene and these precious materials were held in a variety of lidded alabaster, glass and faience vessels.

Other objects in the tomb include sandals, jar vessels and more than 100 garments.John H.

Taxonomy The sportive lemurs (Lepilemuridae) constitute a family with only a single genus, Lepilemur. Relationships within this genus are not yet completely resolved, and genetic analyses continue to suggest reclassifications of current species. L. sahamalazensis was split from L. dorsalis in 2006 after the latter taxon was found to be paraphyletic.  Description  The Sahamalaza sportive lemur is nocturnal and therefore has large orange eyes are adapted for seeing in the dark. Individuals weigh , with females being up to heavier than males. Head- to-body length is approximately , and the tail is equally long. The color of the fur has elements of grey and red-brown, but this is variable depending on light conditions and possibly age of individuals. The lemur has lighter belly fur, which ranges from grey to creamy colored. It has a pronounced sense of smell, and the tip of its nose is moist and very sensitive. Distribution and habitat The Sahamalaza sportive lemur is endemic to the Sahamalaza Peninsula in northwestern Madagascar. The peninsula is part of a transition zone between the Sambirano region and the deciduous forest region . The peninsula has been subject to extensive anthropogenic deforestation, and no intact forests remain. The remaining forest consists of five forest fragments. Of these, the most frequently studied is the Ankarafa forest (extent 13¬∞52‚Ä≤S / 45¬∞38‚Ä≤E to 14¬∞27‚Ä≤S / 47¬∞46‚Ä≤E). The Ankarafa forest lies on the transition zone, harboring semi humid forest with tree heights up to . Sahamalaza sportive lemurs like areas with high tree density and canopy cover with many sleeping places. The climate here is seasonal; May-October is cool and dry, while November-April is hot and rainy.  Ecology  =Diet= The majority of the sportive lemurs‚Äô diet consists of leaves, but it will also take fruit, flowers, sap, bark and small invertebrates. Leaf-eating primates are rarely nocturnal, presumably because leaves are relatively low in sugars at night, since photosynthesis occurs at a lower rate or not at all. The metabolic rates of Lepilemur species are amongst the lowest recorded in mammalian folivores, and they are highly adapted for surviving on this diet. It has been suggested that Lepilemur species can only fulfil their dietary requirements with the aid of coprophagy (consuming their own feces). = Behaviour = The Sahamalaza sportive lemur is predominantly arboreal, moving between trees with long jumps powered by its strong hind legs. On the ground, it hops like a kangaroo. It is active and quite vocal at night. By day it hides among leaves or in holes in tree trunks. When resting in tree holes, they like to lay closer to the entrance to feel/be in the sunlight. During its nocturnal activities, the species was found to spend 47% of the time resting and 18% of the time feeding. It is solitary and defends its territory vehemently against same-sex intruders. Territories of males and females can overlap. Sportive lemurs have been found to be inactive for around 50% of their waking time, to rest without much motion for up to 2 hours at a time and to travel on average only per night. Prolonged rates of inactivity presumably allow the digestion and detoxification of low quality food and reduction of overall energy expenditure. The Sahamalaza sportive lemur attends other species‚Äô alarm calls for predator alerts, a habit confirmed by experiments: when the call of a harrier hawk (a predator to Sahamalaza lemurs) was played near them, they became more alert and scanned the sky.  Threats  The Sahamalaza sportive lemur is preyed on by the Malagasy tree boa while sleeping during the day, as well as by birds of prey when in the open. The main anthropogenic threats to the species are habitat loss from deforestation (mostly logging) and subsistence hunting. The Sahamalaza - Iles Radama Nation Park was created in an effort to help increase the population and recoup habitat losses . Wildfires (May to October) are also believed to have an impact. Conservation A 2007 survey estimated a total population size of about 3000 individuals across multiple species within the Lepilemur complex, not all of which can be ascribed to this species. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) currently classifies the species as critically endangered, largely on the basis of this survey.. It is believed that populations have increased as a result of protection. Networks such as the Association Europ√©enne pour I'Etude et la Conservation des L√©muriens (AEECL) have worked continuously since 2001 to reserve space for the Sahamalaza - Iles Radama National Park; in September of 2001 the Sahamalaza Peninsula has been declared a UNESCO biosphere reserve.

Tutela had particular applications in Roman law. Legal tutela Under Roman law, there were several forms of tutela (\\"guardianship\\" or \\"tutelage\\"), mainly for people such as minors and women who ordinarily in Roman society would be under the legal protection and control of a paterfamilias, but who for whatever reasons were sui iuris, legally emancipated. The guardian who oversaw their interests was a tutor. Latin legal terminology distinguishes among several types of tutela,Adolf Berger, Encyclopedic Dictionary of Roman Law (American Philosophical Society, 1991 reprint), pp. 747‚Äì749. including: * tutela fiduciaria, fiduciary guardianship.Berger, Encyclopedic Dictionary of Roman Law, p. 747. * tutela impuberum, guardianship for minors who were emancipated from the legal control (potestas) of a paterfamilias or head of household.Berger, Encyclopedic Dictionary of Roman Law, p. 747. * tutela mulierum, guardianship of emanicipated women, generally those whose fathers had died. In the \\"core period\\" of Roman history (2nd century BC to 2nd century AD), a married woman did not enter into the potestas of her husband, and remained legally a part of her birth family. The appointment of a tutor was meant to ensure that her interests and those of her family were protected, particularly in matters of property rights, since the ownership of property by married people remained separate. On occasion, a woman who wanted her husband to manage her property might have him appointed tutor.Jane Gardner, Family and Familia in Roman Law and Life (Oxford University Press, 1998), p. 52ff. et passim. Tutelae The tutela or tutelary deity was fundamental to archaic Roman religion. The capacity for offering protection or guardianship was a basic function of deity, expressed by formulations such as Tutela Iovis, \\"the tutelage of Jove\\".Harold Lucius Axtell, The Deification of Abstract Ideas in Roman Literature and Inscriptions (University of Chicago, 1907), p. 40. Major deities such as Jupiter, Minerva, and Mars were conceived of as tutelaries.on Mars, Vincent J. Rosivach, \\"Mars, the Lustral God,\\" Latomus 42.3 (1983), pp. 519‚Äì521. The phrase in tutela expressed the sphere of influence exercised by a deity. For instance, trees of ill omen (arbores infelices) were in the tutela of the gods below (di inferi).Rabun Taylor, \\"Roman Oscilla: An Assessment,\\" RES: Anthropology and Aesthetics 48 (2005), p. 86. The initiatory grades of the Mithraic mysteries seem to have each had a tutelary deity.Howard M. Jackson, \\"The Meaning and Function of the Leontocephaline in Roman Mithraism,\\" Numen 32.1 (1985), p. 33. The cities of ancient Italy characteristically had a tutela, who in many places was Juno. The true name of the deity was theoretically kept secret, to prevent an enemy from enacting a ritual \\"calling out\\" (evocatio) the tutelary and rendering the city vulnerable.J√∂rg R√ºpke, The Religion of the Romans (Polity Press, 2007, originally published 2001 in German), p. 132. If the identity of a deity whose protection was desired was unknown, an altar might be inscribed with an open-ended invocation such as \\"to the tutelary god\\".Axtel, The Deification of Abstract Ideas, p. 40. The individual goddess Tutela may have evolved from this abstraction. She appears often in inscriptions, particularly in Gaul, but only rarely in literature.Axtel, The Deification of Abstract Ideas, pp. 42‚Äì43. She is often linked invoked with the Genius to assure a full range of protection, and became a regular part of household cult along with the Lares and Penates.Axtel, The Deification of Abstract Ideas, pp. 40‚Äì41; J. Rufus Fears, \\"The Cult of Virtues and Roman Imperial Ideology,\\" Aufstieg und Niedergang der r√∂mischen Welt II.17.2 (1981, pp. 900‚Äì901. She might also be paired with Fortuna.Axtel, The Deification of Abstract Ideas, p. 42. Tutor or tutator might be masculine epithets for gods in a specifically tutelary function: Iuppiter tutor or Hercules tutator.Axtel, The Deification of Abstract Ideas, p. 42. Tutela and Imperial cult The early Roman emperors drew on traditional sources of authority to consolidate their position, among them the potestas or power of the Roman head of household. Tutela or guardianship was another available form of authority, advertised as Tutela Augusti, the tutelage of Augustus.Fears, \\"The Cult of Virtues,\\" pp. 900‚Äì901. In the Imperial period the goddess Tutela received her own distinct cultus in the form of rituals and temples.Fear, \\"The Cult of Virtues,\\" p. 900. The Flavian dynasty in particular cultivated Tutela.Michael Grant, Roman Anniversary Issues (Cambridge University Press, 1950), p. 89.

The term became globally used since then. The choice of authors was done entirely by Breton and according to his taste which he explains in the Foreword (called The Lightning Rod, a term suggested by Lichtenberg), a work of great depth (Breton was the main theoretician of the Surrealist movement) that starts with contemplating Rimbaud¬¥s words \\"Emanations, explosions.\\" from Rimbaud's last poem The barrack-room of night : Dream.Mag4.net Arthur Rimbaud - Derniers Vers : La Chambr√©e de Nuit The authors, each introduced by a preface by Breton and represented by a few pages from their writings, are sorted chronologically.

His areas of specialization in the field of anthropology include Eastern United States Prehistory, Mesoamerican Prehistory, Cultural Resource Management, Settlement Pattern Studies, Archaeology of Households, Environmental Anthropology, Ceramic Analysis, and GIS Applications for Anthropology.  Biography  Pluckhahn was born in St. Paul, Minnesota in 1966. In 1984 he received an alumni scholarship to the University of Georgia, from which he graduated in 1988 with an A.B., cum laude with honors in Anthropology. =Field work= From 1989 until 1992 he worked as an archaeological field technician for various firms in the eastern United States and Europe. From 1993 until 1994 Pluckhahn worked as a Project Archaeologist for Brockington and Associates in Norcross, Georgia. He then became a consulting archaeologist for Southern Research at Fort Stewart Military Reservation in Georgia, as well as a senior archaeologist for Southern Archaeological Services, Athens, Georgia. He served in the latter position until 2003. After two years Pluckhahn returned to his alma mater in 1996 to become a graduate teaching assistant in the Department of Anthropology at the University of Georgia.(Pluckhahn CV) =Academic work= While working as a teaching assistant Pluckhahn did some fieldwork at the Shoulderbone Tract located in Hancock County. While the work was not long, only lasting from January sixth until the end of the month it would provide the basis for his first fully published book. Written in 1997 \\"An archeological Survey of the Shoulderbone Tract, Hancock County, Georgia\\" describes the work that was done in the Shoulderbone Tract of Hancock County which was made up a mound complex located on a terrace north of Whitten Creek. While Pluckhahn described the work as ‚Äúminimal, and focusing on defining and demarcating the limits of the site so that it may be fenced.‚Äù(Pluckhahn 25) he does go on to admit that ‚ÄúMost of the fieldwork, however was devoted to an extensive archeological survey of the property.‚Äù(Pluckhahn iii) =Kolomoki= In the following year of 1998, Pluckhahn became an instructor at Georgia. In 1999 Pluckhahn became the field supervisor at the Mixteca Alta Settlement Pattern Survey in Oaxaca, Mexico. In the same year he traveled back east to become the field director of the Kolomoki: Learning about a Woodland Ceremonial Center located in Georgia. During this time he helped excavate the famed mound site of Kolomoki in the lower Chattahoochee River Valley of southwest Georgia. From 1999 until 2001 he served as a field director at Kolomoki in a study founded by the National Geographic Society. During his time at Kolomoki, Pluckhahn worked with others to excavate the site of Kolomoki examining everything from pottery to the mounds themselves. This excavation was intended to discover how Native Americans lived during Kolomoki's days as an important cultural center. After extensive studies on the evidence uncovered during the excavation, an important discovery was made involving the dating that had previously been applied. Before the excavation, previous archaeologists had placed the date of the Kolomoki mounds in the Mississippian Period (c. 1000-1500 AD), but Dr. Pluckhahn however, discovered that the main date of occupation was closer to the Woodland Period (c. 350-750 AD). =Ph.D= In 2002, Thomas earned his Ph.D. from the University of Georgia, writing his dissertation on his experiences and findings at Kolomoki. After working as an instructor for Georgia, Pluckhahn became the visiting assistant professor of the Department of Anthropology at the University of Oklahoma in 2003. He served in this position until 2004, when he became the assistant professor in the Department of Anthropology. =Kolomoki book= While at Oklahoma Pluckhahn released \\"Kolomoki: Settlement, Ceremony, and Status in the Deep South, A.D. 350 to 750\\". He applied his fieldwork from the Kolomoki site, as well as his discoveries of the new timeline of the Kolomoki mounds. The analysis in the book supports the evidence of Kolomki's actual occupation, while also answering questions about middle range societies, their use of ceremony and its effect on status.(Kolomoki Pluckhahn) =Light on the Path, book= Pluckhahn served as the visiting assistant professor of the Department of Anthropology until 2004, when he became the assistant professor in the Department of Anthropology at the University of Oklahoma. He served in this position for two more years. In 2006 he released the book \\"Light on the Path: The Anthropology and History of the Southeastern Indians\\". In this book Pluckhahn, along with Robbie Ethridge, provide new ideas for viewing the history of Native Americans in the Southeast. A major component of the book deals with the recent ability to connect the periods of the sixteenth-century Late Mississippian period to the eighteenth-century colonial period. Pluckhahn and Ethridge claim in the book to be able to bridge the two centuries together, while filling in the previously mysterious seventeenth-century. This linkage has provided a crucial new way to view the ancestry of the southeastern United States that is invaluable to not only archaeologist and anthropologist, but historians as well.

There was a great deal of friction on the set of this movie as Morgan and Temple repeatedly tried to steal scenes from one another. Morgan would place his stovepipe hat on a table blocking Temple's face and forcing her to move her marks and out of the camera lights. He would also keep moving his hands near her eye level by tinkering with a handkerchief or placing on gloves. Temple for her part would either yawn or scratch her face. In the scene where Morgan's character gets ripped off by con men, Temple jiggled the fishing pole she was holding in the background in an attempt to draw attention away from Morgan. She also worked with Robinson to devise ways of creating rhythmic pauses and gestures in her dance movements to prevent scene stealing from Morgan. Producer Nunally Johnson, commenting on the scene stealing, remarked that \\"When this picture is over, either Shirley will have acquired a taste for Scotch whiskey or Frank will come out with curls.\\"Shirley Temple Black, \\"Child Star: An Autobiography\\" (New York: McGraw-Hill Publishing Company, 1988), 141-144. Music The film's songs ‚Äì \\"Hey, What Did the Blue Jay Say\\", \\"He Was a Dandy\\", \\"Picture Me Without You\\", \\"Get On Board\\", \\"Dixie- anna\\", and \\"Wings of the Morning\\" ‚Äì were written by Jimmy McHugh and lyricist Ted Koehler. The dances were choreographed by Bill Robinson who appeared with Temple in four films and partnered her for the famous staircase tap dance in The Little Colonel. Sony Computer Entertainment later used the song Get On Board for a PlayStation 2 advertisement entitled \\"Mountain\\". Release =Critical reception= Frank Nugent wrote in The New York Times that the film was \\"not the best Temple, nor the worst‚Äù and thought her performance as Little Eva in Allen's play \\"sheer bathos\\". Louella Parsons wrote, ‚ÄúThe Golden Temple baby is growing up‚Äîboth taller and broader‚Äîbut her million-dollar personality remains the same fortunately and she needs it for Dimples (Edwards 101). Temple scholar Robert Windeler notes that Temple was upstaged for the first time in one of her pictures. Frank Morgan played Temple‚Äôs ‚ÄúMicawberesque grandfather with such energy and fun as to render Shirley [...] faltering and hollow (Windeler 175). =Home media= The film was released on DVD on March 12, 2002. In 2009, a videocassette was available in the original black and white and in computer-colorized versions of the original. Some editions included theatrical trailers and other special features.

From him descends the House of Laanui.  Early life  Pele ªioholani La ªanui was probably born at the District of Waimea on the island of Hawai ªi in 1797. His mother was Chiefess Kaohelelani, formerly heir to Hana, Kipahulu and Kaupo, and daughter of High Chief Kalokuokamaile and High Chiefess Kaloiokalani. His father was the High Chief Nuhi, ruler of Waimea and son of Chief Hinai of Waimea, by his wife, Kupapa-a-I. Nuhi had survived the 1792 battle at Pu ªukoholƒÅ Heiau where Kamehameha I unified the island of Hawai ªi. His only sibling was his sister Kekaikuihala. When La ªanui was a boy, Kamehameha was still trying to control the District of Waimea; if not in battle, through a matrimonial alliance. His failure to accomplish this through his niece Kaohelelani was a sting to the old warrior's pride, and now he chose a new agent by inviting La ªanui to his court. The invitation was accepted, and the visit lasted for months. Kamehameha and Queen Ka ªahumanu arranged a marriage between Piia and La ªanui.  Marriage to Namahana  Namahana Kekuwai-Pi ªia was the youngest sister of Queen Ka ªahumanu and formerly one of the queens of Kamehameha I. Pi ªia is described as being a person heavily built and not prepossessing in appearance like her sisters Ka ªahumanu and Kaheiheimalie. At last, the proposition was put to La ªanui, that it was the united wish of the king and queen that the marriage should take place. To wed a woman very many years his senior was not his desire. Yet realizing that it might be perilous to defy the powerful monarch, La ªanui quietly consented \\"to take the bitter pill.\\" The couple lived at Waialua, one of the divisions of land that Piia had received from her father Keeaumoku Papaiahiahi's large estate. Soon after Kamehameha I's death in 1819, Ka ªahumanu became Kuhina Nui and Kamehameha II became king. After this, the first party of missionaries arrived. He and Piia, together with Queen Ka ªahumanu and several other chiefs, were among the first converts to Christianity. They were the first couples to be married by Hiram Bingham I in a Christian ceremony. Their favorite dwelling was Waialua, Oahu. They visited Honolulu only when necessary. Unfortunately, Piia's corpulence did not inure to healthfulness and before long, she sickened and died. On her deathbed, she said to her husband: > \\"La ªanui, I wish to divulge a secret in my heart to you. It was not my work > that you gave up your patrimonial inheritance to me. It was at the > instigation of Kamehameha that I played coyly toward you in order to gratify > his selfish motives. For your cheerful sacrifice of what was so dear to your > hear I feel it is my duty to repay you. Therefore, in return for great > kindness I leave this dear Waialua to you, as well as all the other lands, > which I own, for my token of love for you. I cannot die happy without making > this reparation while the breath is in my body. Forgive me for the part I > took in the wrongful measure.\\" La ªanui, in the presence of friends, relatives and retainers, pronounced forgiveness. A few days later Piia died.  Marriages to Owana and Puohu  After Piia's death, he married High Chiefess Theresa Owana KaheiheimƒÅlie Rives. She was one of the twin daughters of Jean Baptiste Rives, the French secretary of Kamehameha II, whose Hawaiian name was Luahine (\\"Old Woman\\"). Owana's mother was Chiefess Holau II, descendant of Kaihikapumahana, the only daughter of Lonoikamakahiki Kapuokalani and his wife Kaikilanialliwahine o Puna and sister of Keawehanauikawalu, ancestor of Kekuanaoa, father of the last line of the Kamehamehas. His wife and her sister Virginia Kahoa were hƒÅnai (adopted) daughters of the Queen Ka ªahumanu and were spoken by Mrs. Gerrit P. Judd as becomingly pretty. La ªanui was almost twice the age of his young wife. They lived at Waialua in the La ªanui Estate, by the Anahulu River. Their town residence became owned by the James Campbell estate. In time a daughter was born. Friends from Honolulu brought offerings to mingle with those of Waialua and were entertained by La ªanui and Owana. They named their child Elizabeth Kekaaniauokalani. \\"Elizabeth\\" after the baptismal name of Queen Ka ªahumanu, the child's foster grandmother and step-aunt, and the Hawaiian name after one of La ªanui's sister, the firstborn of Kaohelelani and Nuhi, who died at the age of five years. For five years, they hoped for a male heir. They named their son Gideon Laanui II after his father and Kailipalaki o Keheananui (after the high alii Kinau II). Gideon later married to his third wife Amelia Puohu (1824‚Äì1896) on July 9, 1842. She later remarried and became Mrs. George Carsley.; ;  Death  Waialua, the residence of Gideon Peleioholani Laanui. On September 12, 1849, La ªanui died at his favourite home at Waialua. Elizabeth Kekaaniau was still a minor and attending school as the time. His two children still had some living members of their mother's family: Owana's twin sister and two brothers, who took them to their home. Before this could be arranged notice had to be given to the king and chiefs that, owing to failing health, Amos Starr Cooke with his family was going to close the Royal School. Eventually a guardian was appointed: John Papa  ªƒ™ ªƒ´ who was also administrator of La ªanui's estate. Upon arriving at maturity, Elizabeth was advised to claim her portion of her father's estates. When she called on  ªƒ™ ªƒ´ for this purpose, he astounded her with the information, \\"There is not much property that I know of which belonged to your father.\\" Being young and unsuspicious she turned toward home little suspecting the wrongs inflicted on her and her brother. How they had been wronged remained a mystery until several years afterward, when a very confidential retainer of La ªanui's took sick and fearing that death might overtake him at any moment, dispatched a boy to Elizabeth urging her to come to his bedside, as he wished to see her once more before the end came. The next morning, in company with her uncle, she went to the old gentleman awaiting their arrival in great anxiety. After they had partaken of some food the household was summoned to evening prayers as usual, by the sick man's couch, and after delivering the blessing of God, he turned and addressed his guest thus: > \\"My dear you Ali ªi, I have been a traitor to you and your cause. I have been > false to my haku, your beloved father, who brought us to this new residence > aside from our own loved land of Waimea, the birthplace of your dear father > and his ancestors before him. He placed in my hands a book, which you will > find in your room, containing a list of lands to be presented to the Land > Office just newly created to secure the legal award of title as ordained by > law. I did not follow your father's command, but listened to the tempter. > All the lands that I possess as presents from your father it is my wish that > they be returned to you after the death of my wife.\\" The old gentleman died a few hours later and Elizabeth and her brother received their father's inheritance excluding those already lost to La ªanui's other former retainers and the lands of Hana, Kipahulu, Kaupo, and Waimea lost to Kamehameha, each one being robbed from first to the last. Eventually the La ªanui Estate at Waialua, Oahu was lost and torn down to build the Haleiwa Hotel.

In this model, the goal is to find the intended word given a word where the letters have been scrambled in some manner.  Definition  Given an alphabet \\\\Sigma, let \\\\Sigma^* be the set of all finite strings over \\\\Sigma. Let the dictionary D of valid words be some subset of \\\\Sigma^*, i.e., D\\\\subseteq\\\\Sigma^*. The noisy channel is the matrix :\\\\Gamma_{ws} = \\\\Pr(sw), where w\\\\in D is the intended word and s\\\\in\\\\Sigma^* is the scrambled word that was actually received.  Example  Consider the English alphabet \\\\Sigma = \\\\\\\\{a, b, c, ..., y, z, A, B, ..., Z, ...\\\\\\\\}. Some subset D\\\\subseteq\\\\Sigma^* makes up the dictionary of valid English words. There are several mistakes that may occur while typing, including: # Missing letters, e.g., ' instead of letter # Accidental letter additions, e.g., ' instead of mistake # Swapping letters, e.g., ' instead of received # Replacing letters, e.g., ' instead of finite To construct the noisy channel matrix \\\\Gamma, we must consider the probability of each mistake, given the intended word (\\\\Pr(sw) for all w\\\\in D and s\\\\in\\\\Sigma^*). These probabilities may be gathered, for example, by considering the Levenshtein distance between s and w or by comparing the draft of an essay with one that has been manually edited for spelling.  Error-correction  The goal of the noisy channel model is to find the intended word given the scrambled word that was received. The decision function \\\\sigma : \\\\Sigma^* \\\\to D is a function that, given a scrambled word, returns the intended word. Methods of constructing a decision function include the maximum likelihood rule, the maximum a posteriori rule, and the minimum distance rule. In some cases, it may be better to accept the scrambled word as the intended word rather than attempt to find an intended word in the dictionary. For example, the word sch√∂nfinkeling may not be in the dictionary, but might in fact be the intended word.

Her family reported her missing on July 1, 1992 and her body was discovered off of Echo Lake Road in Goshen, New York on August 4. =Laurette Huggins Reviere= Laurette Huggins Reviere, 34 of Middletown, was killed July 10 and found in her home in Middletown by the police. She was a mother of three children and a close friend of White's girlfriend. Her children even slept over at White and Garrison's house a few weeks before her murder. She was in the midst of packing to go back to her home country of St. Vincent and the Grenadines with her family when she was murdered. . =Angelina Hopkins and Brenda L. Whiteside= Cousins Angelina Hopkins and Brenda Whiteside met White at the Blue Note Tavern in Poughkeepsie, New York on July 20, 1992. They were last seen leaving the bar with him in his pickup truck. Their bodies were found off of Harriman Drive in an abandoned farmhouse in Goshen on August 4. Cause of death in both cases was determined to be severe blunt trauma to the face and head. =Adriane M. Hunter= Adriane Hunter of Middletown, was stabbed to death in the early morning July 30, 1992. Her body was discovered in Goshen later that day, in the charred remains of the Hillcrest Manor Restaurant. She was 27. Investigation The bodies of Hopkins and Whiteside were discovered in this house on Harriman Drive in Goshen on August 4. The body of Adriane Hunter had been found nearby a few days earlier. The house along with barn are no longer standing. Angelina Hopkins's sister, Cecilia, witnessed Hopkins and Whiteside leaving the Blue Note Tavern with four men on the night of their disappearance. Poughkeepsie police did not act on the missing person report as they did not have enough information about the men, so Cecilia and her mother continued investigating on their own. The New York State Police began investigating on July 30, after the body of Adriane Hunter was found and authorities began to suspect it was related to the earlier disappearances and murders. On August 2, White returned to the Blue Note where Hopkins identified him and he was arrested. White confessed and led police to his dumping ground in Goshen on August 4. White was indicted by a grand jury on August 7 for the murder of Christine Klebbe. On September 9, the other five murders were added to the indictment. White was charged with six counts of second degree murder and pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. White was convicted on all counts on April 14, 1993 and sentenced by Judge Jeffrey Berry to 150 years to life. He is currently held at Elmira Correctional Facility. White's case was cited by New York governor George Pataki in defense of his push to reinstate the death penalty. = Television = * White's crimes were profiled in a 1999 episode of A&E;'s program Investigative Reports titled \\"Copycat Crimes\\". * The Investigation Discovery channel has broadcast an episode called 'I Invited Him In‚Äô featuring the Nathaniel White case for the Evil Lives Here series. * The Reelz channel broadcast S2 E5 of the series CopyCat Killers titled 'Robocop' tying Nathaniel White's killings to the RoboCop (franchise).

It is the first relic that the audience sees the protagonist Indiana Jones acquire, establishing him as a treasure hunter. The idol's likeness has become iconic in popular culture. In the film In the film Raiders of the Lost Ark, the idol is portrayed as resting in an ancient, abandoned temple in South America. The specific location is not given in the film, other than a subtitle that reads \\"South America, 1936\\". Fictional history Based on the film and Indiana Jones comic books, the idol was erroneously attributed to the Chachapoyan tribe in Peru, South America, although the specimen from which it was modeled is carved of greenstone, attributed to the Aztec culture, and is currently on exhibit at the Dumbarton Oaks collections in Washington, D.C. It was sought in 1936, in the Peruvian Amazon jungle, by archaeologist/treasure hunter Indiana Jones. Jones had heard of the idol when a score of golden purportedly Chachapoyan figurines began to appear on the antiquities market. Jones and Marcus Brody, curator of the National Museum, believed that hitherto undiscovered Chachapoyan temples had been located and were being plundered. Evidence pointed to one of Jones's competitors, a Princeton archaeologist named Forrestal (another fictional character), who had embarked on an expedition to Peru a year earlier and never returned. With help from the journal of a 19th-century explorer and contacts in South America, Jones follows in Forrestal's footsteps, determined to acquire the real prize: a golden representation of the Chachapoyan goddess of fertility and childbirth, said to be secreted in the heart of the Temple of Warriors. While penetrating the Temple of Warriors, Jones finds Forrestal's remains impaled on the wooden spikes of a booby trap. The original Aztec birthing figure from Dumbarton Oaks. Recent microscopic analysis of the incisions and drill holes has determined that they were most probably made by modern tools. The golden idol was placed upon an ancient Chachapoyan altar. It was the exact weight to hold an ancient self-destruct mechanism in place. Jones knows of the booby trap and attempts to replace the idol with a bag of sand. His attempt fails when he incorrectly estimates the weight of the idol. After escaping the many traps set by the Chachapoyans including a giant boulder, he finds rival archaeologist Rene Belloq waiting outside with a group of Hovitos, the local natives. Surrounded and outnumbered, Jones is forced to give up the artifact to Belloq. Jones escapes from Belloq and the Hovitos after a jungle pursuit, flying away on a waiting seaplane. As related in the Indiana Jones comics, years later, Indy regains the idol from a black market antiquities dealer located in Marrakesh, Morocco (where Jones, in Raiders of the Lost Ark, deduces that Belloq sold it). However, also on the trail for the idol is Xomec, a descendant of the Chachapoyans, and Ilsa Toht, sister of Gestapo agent Arnold Toht. The two want to use the idol to unite Amazonian tribes and disrupt wartime rubber production in South America, as well as lure Jones to his death. Historical basis The movie prop idol was based on the actual Dumbarton Oaks birthing figure in the pre-Columbian collection at Dumbarton Oaks. The artifact is presumed to depict the Aztec goddess Tlazolteotl. Scientific analysis by the Smithsonian, though, shows the Dumbarton figure to be a probable fake from the late nineteenth century. Other scholars are less certain, but express similar doubts. The Chachapoya culture was a genuine subject of interest for scientists under the Nazi government, particularly Jacques de Mahieu, who like the fictional Belloq was a French collaborator. Based on quotations from Spanish colonists (many of them fabricated), and on his interpretations of since-refuted archaeological digs, he argued that descendants of Vikings had once ruled Peru.Ibarra Grasso, Dick Edgar (1997) Los Hombres Barbados en la Am√©rica Precolombina p. 66Llanos, Oscar Olmedo (2006) Paranoia Aimara p. 182 Chachapoya Sarcophagi of Carajia. In reality the Chachapoya did not build the elaborate trap systems portrayed in the film. However, they were accomplished builders of fortified cities, as sites like the Ku√©lap settlement show. These structures were characteristically built on high slopes, unlike the temple hidden in heavily jungled lowlands in the film. Their sculptural style was far different from that of the Golden Idol, as shown by the sarcophagi at Caraj√≠a. Inspiration The prologue of Raiders is an homage to Carl Barks' Scrooge McDuck adventure ‚Ä≥The Seven Cities of Cibola,‚Ä≥ published in Uncle Scrooge #7 from September 1954.\\"Uncle Scrooge McDuck: His Life and Times\\" Celestial Arts Press, Millbrae, California, 1981.

Ella Kate Ewing (March 9, 1872 - January 10, 1913) was a Missouri woman considered the world's tallest female of her era. She would use her great height to earn a living as a sideshow attraction, popularly known as \\"The Missouri Giantess.\\" Early life and growth Ella Ewing, more commonly known as \\"The Missouri Giantess\\". Ella Ewing was born in La Grange, Missouri, the only child of Benjamin F. and Anna Eliza (Herring) Ewing.\\"Missouri's Tall Daughter\\" by Bobby Poston. Published in The Chariton Collector magazine. Spring, 1982. Pg.19-21 While a toddler, Ella's family moved to the small Scotland County community of Rainbow, southeast of Gorin, Missouri. She was of normal size while a baby and young child, with the first signs of any abnormality appearing shortly after her seventh birthday. At age fourteen she towered over not only other children, but her parents and other adults, measuring 6 feet 10 inches. The people of the Rainbow and Gorin area were used to her fast growth and met it with compassion; however, in 1885 Ewing learned that would not always be the case in the world at large. Asked to read the Declaration of Independence at a July 4 celebration in Wyaconda, Missouri, Ewing was met with shocked gasps, snickers and laughter when she stood to read. Led away in tears, the incident would have a profound effect on her life. Ewing's maximum height is a matter of dispute, but in several accounts she was claimed to be over eight feet tall. Her mother's journal indicated that Ella's growth finally stopped when she was age twenty-two, at 8 feet, 4 inches tall.\\"Ella K. Ewing, Missouri Giantess: 1872-1913\\" by Barbara Chasteen. 1977. However, this is not well documented, and as such she is not mentioned in Guinness World Records. The Guinness Book of Records has stated she measured 7 feet 4 and a half inches tall, and may have reached 8 feet 3/4 inches by the time she died. As typical of many people afflicted with pituitary gigantism Ella's arms were very long, with her hands and feet exceptionally big. She wore a custom-made size 24 US shoe and often wore multiple rings on her fingers to mask their unusual length. Professional life Circus poster promoting Ella Ewing. The custom built home of Ella Ewing featuring extra tall doorways, ceilings, and windows to better accommodate her height. Ewing initially disliked being gawked at, but decided that as it was unavoidable she might as well make some advantage to it, so agreed to make appearances and tours. Her Baptist faith, however, meant she would not make appearances on Sundays. For a time Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus introduced her as the Earth's tallest woman. Her professional career began at age twenty when Lewis Epstein, a museum owner and impresario from Chicago offered $1,000 for twenty-seven day appearance at his establishment. As part of her contract Ella's parents were allowed to accompany her and the family considered it something of a paid vacation, touring the sights of the Windy City when she was not on display at Epstein's museum. Not long after returning home to Gorin Lewis Epstein made an even bigger offer, a five-month engagement for the then-astounding sum of $5,000. Convincing her hesitant father that was more money than he could earn in five years of hardscrabble farming, Ella accepted and thus embarked permanently on a career as a museum and circus sideshow attraction. She died of tuberculosis and is buried at Harmony Grove Church near her hometown of Gorin. In Scotland County, Missouri there is an \\"Ella Ewing Reservoir\\" for fishing and an arts festival in Memphis, Missouri was also named for her.

Columbus is a bronze cast of a sterling silver statue which was created by Rhode Island's Gorham Manufacturing Company for the 1892 Columbian Exposition in Chicago. The original silver statue was not meant for permanent exhibition, but rather as a demonstration of the skills of the Gorham Company, and was later melted down. The bronze cast was dedicated November 8, 1893 as a gift from the Elmwood Association to the City of Providence. The statue was created in 1893 by Fr√©d√©ric Auguste Bartholdi and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2001. It was removed from Columbus Square in 2020 by the City of Providence.  History  =Columbian Exposition= Cast in 1893, the statue of Columbus that once stood on Elmwood Avenue was produced by the Gorham Manufacturing Company who commissioned master sculptor, Auguste Bartholdi. The bronze statue is a cast of the original made of sterling silver, which was commissioned for the 1892 Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois. For the upcoming exposition, Gorham wanted a demonstration piece to show the skill of its foundry and commissioned Bartholdi to create a statue of Columbus. The completed model was shipped across the Atlantic Ocean to be cast from 30,000 ounces of silver at Providence, Rhode Island. The casting was a ceremonial affair, where guests \\"were feted as they watched the process\\". Gorham officials accompanied and shipped the statue to Chicago via rail. It served as a demonstration piece at the exposition, showcasing the skill of its foundry in the technically difficult task of casting a work in sterling silver. After the exposition, the statue was returned to Providence where it was melted down: a silver statue was impractical as a permanent outdoor sculpture and the piece had already served its celebratory and advertisement purpose. =Bronze replica= In 1893, a bronze replica of Columbus was cast by the Gorham company and gifted to the City of Providence by the Elmwood Association, a civic group from a neighborhood near Gorham. It is known that Bartholdi visited Newport, Rhode Island in 1893, but it is unknown if he was involved in the production of the bronze cast. The statue was dedicated on November 8, 1893 at 2:30 p.m. Professor Alonzo Williams was the presenter of the statue to the city and Mayor Potter acted as \\"response on behalf the city\\". Music was provided by the Reeves American Band and the song \\"Columbus\\" was performed. The oration was given by Reverend H. W. Rugg and a chorus of children lead the crowd in singing \\"My Country, 'Tis of Thee\\". The site of the statue was originally deeded to the Town of Cranston by Joseph Cooke on May 24, 1824. The Town of Cranston deeded it to Providence in 1868 and renamed it Columbus Park in 1893. The statue was sometimes a focal point for Columbus Day ceremonies and speeches. One such event in 1939 was attended by the mayor, alderman, and council members. =Controversy= In 2010, the statue was defaced on Columbus Day with red paint and a sign reading \\"murderer\\" hanging from its waist. The statue was again vandalized with paint in 2015 and 2017, raising questions in the media as to the appropriateness of honoring Columbus with a public statue. In October 2019, the statue was splashed with red paint, and a sign reading \\"stop celebrating genocide\\" was leaned against the pedestal, again prompting local controversy. Providence councilwoman Katherine Kerwin of Ward 12 defended the actions on a local radio program hosted by RI WJAR anchor Gene Valicenti, prompting backlash and national news media attention. Mayor Jorge Elorza stated that he would consider moving the statue, though did not commit to where. Some of Rhode Island's Italian American community were pushing for a move from Elmwood to the Federal Hill neighborhood, which has historically been the center of Providence's Italian American community. =Removal= Columbus Square after statue removal, June 28, 2020. In June 2020, on the order of mayor Jorge Elorza, the Columbus statue was removed from Columbus Square. The order was given as a response to statue removals across the United States in the wake of George Floyd protests. During the removal, dozens of people from the neighborhood gathered to cheer. The city has not disclosed where the statue would be stored, nor what would be its fate.  Design  The bronze cast depicts a high by wide and deep, \\"larger-than-life size\\" standing figure of Christopher Columbus atop a by plain square base of grey Westerly, Rhode Island granite. The National Historic Register of Places nomination describes the statue: \\"The explorer is caught in mid-stride, his left foot stepping off the base. In his left hand he holds a globe; his right arm is raised, his index finger pointing, as if giving an order or sighting land. Columbus wears a short tunic; a wide belt wraps the waist; a second belt across the hip holds a sword. A short full cloak billows out around the figure, and he wears a brimmed hat. There is a coil of line at his feet.\\" The square base is inscribed with \\"Columbus\\" on the front, \\"1492\\" on the right side and \\"1893\\" on the left side. The statue is in good overall condition, but has some very small cracks in the figure and the tail ends of the bronze swag are missing. The base is also in good condition with only some chipping on the lower edge of the base being noted in the nomination.  Importance  The National Register of Historic Places nomination lists the Columbus statue under both criteria A and C. Criterion A requires that the property must make a contribution to the major pattern of American history, and criterion C concerns the distinctive characteristics of its architecture and construction, including having great artistic value or being the work of a master. The basis for meeting criterion A is that the work is an example of the Gorham Manufacturing Company's large statue. Columbus was listed under criterion C as an example of the work of Auguste Bartholdi's work. The statue has not been moved from its original location, but the \\"significance of the work is not dependent upon its setting but is encompassed within the object itself.\\" Columbus was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 19, 2001. Though it is a bronze cast copy of the original silver work, the sculpture itself was declared a masterpiece because \\"[l]ife and vigor are implied in every line and feature, and the general effect is one of great beauty.\\" In relation to the original silver cast, James Wilson Pierce declared it as an exemplary work of art that surpasses all other Christopher Columbus sculptures in the United States.

It lives in reefs of the tropical Indo- Pacific, and hunts small fish. Although all cone snails hunt and kill prey using venom, the venom of this species is potent enough to kill humans.WoRMS (2010). Conus geographus Linnaeus, 1758. Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species at http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=215499 on 2011-07-24 Specimens should be handled with extreme caution. The variety Conus geographus var. rosea G. B. Sowerby I, 1833 is a synonym of Conus eldredi Morrison, 1955. This species is the type species of : * Gastridium Modeer, 1793 * Rollus Montfort, 1810 * Utriculus Schumacher, 1817 Shell description C. geographus has a broad, thin shell, cylindrically inflated. Geography cones grow to about to in length. The size of an adult shell varies between 43 mm and 166 mm. The ground color of the shell is pink or violaceous white, occasionally reddish. It has a mottled appearance, clouded and coarsely reticulated with chestnut or chocolate, usually forming two very irregular bands. This intricately brown-and-white pattern is highly prized by shell collectors. The geography cone has a wide, violaceous white or pink aperture and numerous shoulder ridges or spines. The shell is covered with thread-like revolving striae, usually nearly obsolete except at the base. The flattened spire is striated and coronated.George Washington Tryon, Manual of Conchology, vol. VI p. 88; 1879 In comparison with other species, the shell has a noticeably wider and convex mid-body, with a flattened spire. Its walls are also noticeably thinner and lighter compared to other cone shells of similar length and size. File:Cone g√©ographique.pngApertural view File:Conusgeographus2.jpgAbapertural view File:Cone g√©ographiqueFace.pngApical view Distribution Geography cones are common. They occur in the Red Sea, in the Indian Ocean off Chagos, R√©union, Madagascar, Mauritius, Mozambique and Tanzania. They are indigenous to the reefs of the Indo-Pacific region, except for Hawaii, and off Australia (the Northern Territory, Queensland, Western Australia).  Ecology  C. geographus is a piscivore that dwells in sediment of shallow reefs, preying on small fish. It releases a venomous cocktail into the water in order to stun its prey. Like the other cone snails, it fires a harpoon-like, venom-tipped modified tooth into its prey; the harpoon is attached to the body by a proboscis, and the prey is pulled inside for ingestion.  Venom  The geography cone snail is highly dangerous; live specimens should be handled with extreme caution. C. geographus has the most toxic sting known among Conus species and is responsible for more than thirty human fatalities. The venom has an LD50 toxicity in of 0.012-0.030 mg/kg.http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/aconite/geographus.htmlConus geographus Linnaeus, 1758 - Record: CONUS BIODIVERSITY WEBSITE CATALOGUE The venom of Geography Cone Snail is a complex mix of hundreds of different toxins that is delivered through toxoglossan radula, a harpoon-like tooth propelled from an extendable proboscis. There is no antivenom for a cone snail sting, and treatment consists of keeping victims alive until the toxins wear off. The geography cone is also known colloquially as the \\"cigarette snail\\", a gallows humor exaggeration implying that, when stung by this creature, the victim will have only enough time to smoke a cigarette before dying.NIGMS - Findings, September 2002: Secrets of the Killer SnailsGeographic Cone Snail, Geographic Cone Snail Profile, Facts, Information, Photos, Pictures, Sounds, Habitats, Reports, News - National Geographic In reality, even the most venomous cone snails take about one to five hours to kill a healthy human, though medical care must still be prompt. Among the compounds found in cone snail venom are proteins which, when isolated, have great potential as pain-killing drugs. Research shows that certain component proteins of the venom target specific human pain receptors and can be up to 10,000 times more potent than morphine without morphine's addictive properties and side-effects. Conantokin-G is a toxin derived from the venom of C. geographus. Only 15-20 of the venom's 100-200 toxic peptides are used for feeding. It is believed that the other compounds are defensive, and that the venom is mainly used for defense. =Insulin= Recent research has revealed that C. geographus uses a form of insulin as a means of stunning its prey. This insulin is distinct from its own (with shorter chains) and appears to be a stripped down version of those insulins found in fish. Once this venom passes through a fish's gills, the fish experiences hypoglycaemic shock, essentially stunning it and allowing for ingestion by the snail. This poison mixture has been referred to as nirvana cabal. Along with the tulip cone snail C. tulipa, no other species is known to have used insulin as a weapon.

V., & Tichy, G. (2010). Maorichelys wiffeni n. gen. n. sp., una nueva tortuga marina del Eoceno de Nueva Zelanda (Testudines: Dermochelyidae). This genus contains two known species, D. lowii and D. padillai. D. lowii was first discovered in 1895, followed by D. padillai in 2015. Having been estimated at over 120 million years old, D. padillai is currently the oldest known species of sea turtle. Desmatochelys lived during the Cretaceous, and had a wide geographic range, primarily along the Western Interior Seaway.  Discovery  The first specimen of Desmatochelys was described by Samuel Wendell Williston in the Kansas University Quarterly in 1895. In his article he describes its discovery by a railroad worker near Fairbury, Nebraska. Williston was granted access to the specimen by his colleague M. A. Low, giving rise to the name ‚Äòlowii‚Äô. This specimen was from the Late Cretaceous Benton Formation and included a nearly complete skull and lower jaw as well as pieces of the limbs, carapace, and plastron. Since first being discovered, at least five new specimens of D. lowii have been described, found in South Dakota, Kansas, Arizona, Canada, and Mexico. D. padillai was first described in 2015 by paleontologists from the Senckenerg Research Institute and California State University. It was discovered in Colombia with the Lower Cretaceous Paja Formation. This placed its age around 120 million years, making it the oldest known sea turtle, a title which was previously held by Santanachelys gaffneyi.  Description  Desmatochelys was a large sea turtle, with some specimens reaching up to 2 meters long. Members of the genus are characterized by the extended skull roof, large nasal bones, and a paddle-like humerus, as well as a distinct body shell or carapace and reduced plastron like other protostegids. Desmatochelys padillai Specimens of Desmatochelys have been found in Nebraska, South Dakota, Kansas, Arizona, Canada, Colombia, and Mexico. They are known to have existed along the Western Interior Seaway during the Late Cretaceous, and their range may have extended to the Pacific coast. Desmatochelys, like modern sea turtles, had a wide geographic distribution within the oceans. As for its stratigraphic distribution, it is generally accepted that Desmatochelys was restricted to the Cretaceous, with occurrences ranging from the Barremian to the Campanian. Nothing is known of this turtle's reproductive strategy, with the exception of their egg development. Desmatochelys is hypothesized to have laid rigid eggs instead of the soft-shelled eggs typical of extant marine turtles, as a closely related protostegid has been shown to do.  Taxonomy  The genus contains the following species: * Desmatochelys lowi * Desmatochelys padillai Initially, Desmatochelys formed its own family, Desmatochelydae. Later it was reassigned into the family Protostegidae. There is some debate among the paleontological community over the placement of Protostegidae (and therefore Desmatochelys) within turtle phylogeny. According to Elizabeth L. Nicholls, the genus should also be expanded to include closely related members that currently belong to Notochelone and Rhinochelys. As of 2019, Desmatochelys contains the two previously stated species, is within the family Protostegidae, and is placed along the stem of Chelonioidea - in other words, it is considered a basal turtle genus.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975, and is completely contained within the Downtown Providence Historic District, listed in 1984. The district is centered on the United States Customshouse, a three-story granite structure built in 1857 to a design by Ammi B. Young; it was listed on the National Register in 1972. Seven buildings in its immediate vicinity were built between about 1850 and 1920, which housed businesses critical for the functioning of Rhode Island's growing industrial economy. Notable among these is the 1855 Bank of North America Building, a narrow four-story brownstone designed by locally prominent architect Thomas Tefft. The oldest building in the district, now known as the Westminster Arcade, was designed by Russell Warren and built in 1828. Notable for its Greek temple front, it was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1976, and was the nation's first enclosed shopping mall.

'Art' Lehman (September 24, 1917 ‚Äì June 19, 2009) was a widely recorded American Euphonium virtuoso and soloist. He was noted for having radically changed the way the instrument was technically performed, and was a major influence on Euphonium soloists who followed him. Lehman retired as Euphonium soloist and section leader of the \\"President's Own\\" United States Marine Band in 1971 after twenty-four years of service. During his time with the Marine Band, he performed many solos that set the highest standards for Euphoniumists who followed. Arthur Lehman was instrumental in changing the Euphonium section of the Marine Band from playing the small-bore C.G. Conn Double-bell euphoniums of the Sousa Band era to the large-bore Boosey and Hawkes self-compensating Euphoniums, which he demonstrated to be more functional and adaptable to modern performance practices. Early years Art Lehman was born in Doylestown, Pennsylvania, and attended Penn State University, where he was awarded a B.A. in Electrical Engineering in 1940. Drafted into the United States Army upon graduation, although initially assigned to an aircraft factory based on his engineering background, Lehman wound up playing Euphonium with an Army band from 1944 to 1946. Having studied with Simone Mantia, soloist of the Sousa Band,Lehman, Arthur,Simone Mantia's Artistry, Edited and Published by Keith Barton, July 2008, retrieved 4/1/2011 in the summer of 1946, Lehman began studying Euphonium with Harold Brasch, the noted Euphonium soloist of the United States Navy Band. Lehman played with the Penn State Varsity Band and the Philco Band of Philadelphia during his studies. Arthur Lehman was accepted into the United States Marine Band in 1947. Retiring with rank of Master Gunnery Sergeant, Lehman also served as the Band's personnel manager from 1956 to 1964. Lehman's Euphonium teacher, Harold Brasch had started using a bigger-bore Boosey and Hawkes Euphonium during World War II, but the bigger-sounding British-made Euphoniums didn't catch on with other American players until the middle 1950s with Lehman's solo performances during Marine Band radio concerts. In the late 1940s, Lehman worked closely with the British Boosey and Hawkes musical instrument company to produce a set of five custom-made silver-plated \\"Imperial\\" model Euphoniums which were used in the Marine Band for over half a century. One of these unique Euphoniums is owned today by one of Lehman's former students, Glenn Call. Always looking for a darker, more powerful sound, Arthur Lehman also developed the deep, large-bore parabolic-cup mouthpieces generally known today as the \\"Lehman Special,\\" a radical change from the shallower cup-shaped mouthpieces of earlier Euphonium soloists. With his performances on the Boosey and Hawkes Euphoniums and his \\"Lehman Special\\" mouthpieces, Lehman is widely credited for transforming the typical American Euphonium sound from the lighter continental sound of the John Philip Sousa days to the rich, dark and resonant sound common today.Unattributed, Arthur W. Lehman, Tutorvista bio entry from http://www.tutorvista.com/bow/w-section-properties, retrieved 4/1/2011 Later years In 1969, Glenn Call, then Euphoniumist with the Continental Army Band at Fort Monroe, Virginia, began studies with Arthur Lehman. It was at this time that Lehman began to meticulously formulate his Euphonium playing techniques and put them down in a document that came to be called \\"The ART of the Euphonium.\\" These notes developed into a book published in the early 1970s by Robert Hoe, and later by the Tuba Press.Lehman, Arthur and Hoe, Robert, The Art of Euphonium, assorted publishers, 1977 - 1993 Students Call continued his lessons with Arthur Lehman through the 1970s after Call was accepted in the Marine Band. During this time, Lee Dummer, of the U.S. Army Band (\\"Pershing's Own\\") also studied with Lehman. Other enthusiastic Lehman Euphonium students included Michael Ressler, Frank Noonan, Robert Palmer, Maureen Hickey and Tony Ciarlante. Arthur Lehman's final student - and official biographer - was retired FBI Agent Keith Barton, whom Arthur gave his personal Boosey and Hawkes Euphonium. A member of the International Tuba Euphonium Association (ITEA), Arthur Lehman was a writer on Euphonium technique and repertoire during the 1980s, through the early 2000s, appearing in professional journals and the internet. Following his years in the Marine Band, Arthur Lehman continued playing as a member of the National Concert Band of America. He retired from playing the instrument in April 2002 at age 84¬Ω.

He is most notable for investigations and excavations in or near New Mexico, including: the prehistoric site at Bat Cave in Catron County, New Mexico, the Mogollon Su site in western New Mexico and Pueblo Bonito located in Chaco Culture National Historical Park. Biography Wills grew up in Virginia on his father's farm which contained many prehistoric and historic sites. He attributes growing up around old things as a probable stimulus for a desire to work in archeology. The first site he ever worked was in a salt marsh in Lewes, Delaware, at the age of 12 and he has been poking around in sites ever since. Wills began teaching at the University of New Mexico in 1986, and his fieldwork has continued within the state of New Mexico. Contributions Chaco Canyon is the center of Wills' work. For his dissertation, Dr. Wills wrote an article that was later published in the journal of field archaeology entitled The Preceramic to Ceramic Traditions in the Mongollon Highlands of Western New Mexico that focused on his excavation of a pit house on the SU site. Excavations at Pueblo Bonito, Chaco Canyon's most famous site, is what sets him apart from most American anthropologists. Dated roughly from 919-1067 C.E., this vast structure consists of over 800 rooms that took 150 years to construct. The rooms served as living areas, religious centers and even storage units. =Economic theory= An essential part of Wills' economic theory separates a site's storage capacity and intensification. Wills' ecological interests focused on sophisticated analyses of prehistoric subsistence, agriculture, and storage practices. In his work with the Pit house Agriculture he stated ‚ÄúLarge crop yields or high levels of domesticate consumption might be the product of intensification, but not necessarily‚Äù. =Women‚Äôs Economic intensification= Wills' work on the ‚ÄúArchaeology of Gender in the American Southwest‚Äù focused on both time allocation and economic intensification. His contributions to economic intensification were key to identifying some of the origins of southwestern ceramic containers. Future projects Wills has been actively involved in the Chaco Stratigraphy project from 2006 to the present. The Chaco Stratigraphy Project is an interdisciplinary research program at the University of New Mexico involving field investigations in Chaco Canyon, New Mexico. Chaco was the center of an unprecedented cultural development between ca. AD 800 and 1200 known as the \\"Chaco Phenomenon.\\" Wills is hoping that the Chaco Stratigraphy Project will contribute to a greater understanding of the human experience in Chaco through detailed studies of socioeconomic change, with an emphasis on agricultural production and technology during the Bonito phase (ca. AD 850 ‚Äì 1140). Publishing As a scholar, Wills has written and co-authored many articles and books dealing with Southwestern Archaeology. The first book co-written by Wills was entitled ‚ÄúThe Archaeological Correlates of Hunter-Gatherer Societies: Studies From the Ethnographic Record‚Äù in 1980. Wills has also written extensive articles that have been published by the journal of field archaeology. In 2006, Wills wrote ‚ÄúThe Late Archaic Across the Borderlands: From Foraging to Farming‚Äù which described the transition of foraging for food to the use of agriculture for food development.

Based on the 1980 novel The Girl in a Swing by Richard Adams, the film is about an English antique dealer who travels to Copenhagen where he meets and falls in love with a mysterious German-born secretary, whom he marries. Knowing nothing about her family or background, he soon discovers a darker side to his new bride. Plot Alan Desland (Rupert Frazer) is an English antique dealer who specializes in ceramics. A solitary man, he is a bachelor with no romantic ties. On a business trip to Copenhagen, he hires a German-born secretary, Karin Foster (Meg Tilly), to do some clerical work‚Äîshe is fluent in English, Danish, and German. Alan's attraction to Karin is immediate, and over the coming days, he falls deeply in love with her. Karin is an attractive, sensuous, and mysterious woman who reveals little about herself. Her actions reflect both a quiet sensitivity (crying during a classical concert) and a dispassionate coldness (breaking the neck of an injured seagull). During a conversation about Karin's unmarried friend Inge and her child, Alan makes an offhand comment that he would have trouble marrying a woman with a child‚Äîthe remark clearly upsets her. Before leaving Copenhagen, Karin expresses her love for Alan, who responds by proposing marriage, and Karin accepts. Alan returns to England and meets with his mother, who expresses concern that they know very little about Karin's family or background. When Karin arrives, Alan begins to notice her strange behavior‚Äîfrightened by the sound of children and fearful of the dark. As they prepare for their wedding, Karin states she cannot be married in a church. Karin's playful sensuality, however, overwhelms and enchants Alan. Alan and Karin soon travel to the United States on holiday and get married in a civil ceremony in Florida, where they spend their honeymoon. While swimming in a lake, Karin sees a body beneath the water, but Alan confirms it's only an old log. When Alan and Karin return to England, she continues to captivate him and their entire social circle, engaging in discussions of philosophy and religion. At one dinner party, she asks Alan's best friend and vicar, \\"Can anything be forgiven?\\" He tells her yes, if a person truly wants to be forgiven. Alan suspects there is something deep and troubling in her‚Äîsome dark secret or hidden guilt. One day at an auction, Karin bids on an odd lot that contains a rare statuette of a girl in a swing. Overjoyed at the find, Alan authenticates the piece at Sotherby's which estimates its value at over ¬£200,000. He becomes even happier when the initial impotence of his wedding night gives way to an unbridled sexuality between the two. In conversations with Alan and the vicar, Karin explores the connection between spiritual love and physical love‚Äîa notion she believes is absent in Christianity but embraced by pagan cults. Soon after, Karin tells Alan she is pregnant. Alan's initial joy is offset by strange events and apparitions. He sees a green tortoise toy appear and then disappear, and he hears a child's voice on the phone‚Äîsomething Karin also hears. Karin tells Alan she wants to receive Holy Communion. At Mass she is disturbed by the vicar's sermon on the commandment against killing, and then at the communion railing, she takes the eucharist in her hand, but does not receive it, and soon collapses. At home Alan tries to reassure her that whatever's past is past, but she says, \\"Nothing is past.\\" Karin continues to hear a child crying in the garden. When Mrs. Taswell comes to deliver letters, Alan also hears the child crying in the garden. They go to investigate and find a doll faced down in the water fountain. Alan returns to find Karin hysterical. Realizing she knows what is causing these strange events, Alan shuts all the doors and windows, and closes the drapes, but the cries continue in the garden during a violent storm. Alan sees the green tortoise toy again in the bedroom. The next day, Karin asks Alan to take her away. Before leaving, he discovers the receipt for the green tortoise toy and realizes to his horror that she bought it for her daughter just before killing her, out of fear that Alan would reject her with a child. Realizing the damage caused by his \\"careless words\\" in Copenhagen, Alan cries out, \\"May God have mercy.\\" They drive to the beach, where she walks into the surf. She pours water over her head in a gesture of baptism, and he tells her he knows what she did. She takes her clothes off, hands him her wedding ring, and they make love on the beach. As the waves roll over them, she faints in his arms. At the hospital, Alan watches over her, hearing her last words in German, \\"I had no pity.\\" The next day he is told she died during the night. The doctor confirms she had an ectopic pregnancy, and that she had previously given birth. At an inquest hearing, while giving testimony, Alan sees an apparition of Karin in a hooded cloak at the back of the courtroom. When he realizes it is just an apparition, he breaks down in tears. Haunted by his careless words, Alan understands that his \\"need for a tidy life\\" resulted in the tragedy. When he returns home, he hears Karin crying in the garden.

MM was founded in 1994 to create an alternative to Alcoholics Anonymous and similar addiction recovery groups for non-dependent problem drinkers who do not necessarily want to stop drinking, but moderate their amount of alcohol consumed to reduce its detrimental consequences. Methodology Moderation Management allows members to set their own drinking goals as they feel appropriate. MM encourages members to follow particular drinking guidelines, limits, goal setting techniques, and a nine-step cognitive-behavioral change program. The MM limits and guidelines were derived from the work of Dr. Martha Sanchez-Craig. MM members are encouraged, but do not need to follow, the suggested guidelines, limits and steps. MM does not view non-dependent problem drinkers as alcoholics, but rather people with a bad, but controllable, habit. MM does not state that surrender or spirituality is needed to end or control the habit. MM literature makes a similar distinction to Alcoholics Anonymous literature that there are problem drinkers who can return to controlled drinking and alcoholics who can not. MM groups are intended to give members a chance to identify with other problem drinkers and learn from the successes and failures of each other. Face-to-face meetings last about an hour, whereas online meetings are ongoing. \\"Crosstalk,\\" members interrupting each other to provide feedback during meetings, is allowed. Mental health professionals are allowed to help start MM meetings, but ultimate control must be left to the participants. A content analysis of online MM meetings found the most common types of communication by members were self-disclosure, provision of information and advice, and provision of emotional support. Similar studies of depression and eating disorder support groups have found the same patterns. Membership In a 2001 survey of Moderation Management, most MM members are white (96%), employed (81%), educated (72% have at least a college education) and on average are more secular than the rest of the population (32% identify as atheists or agnostics, only 16% regularly attend religious services). MM attracts an equal number of men and women (49% are female); depending on the kinds of meetings attended, between 11.9% and 33.8% of members were under 35 years of age. MM members mostly describe themselves as being non-dependent problem drinkers. In general, MM members report having a mild history of substance-abuse problems before joining, with 40% having consumed four or fewer drinks per drinking day and less than 10% experienced serious withdrawal symptoms or comorbid drug abuse. =Alcohol consumption of members= The 2001 survey saw that 87.1% of online-only members (members whose participation in Moderation Management was online only) and 61.7% of face-to-face members (people who went only to real- world face-to-face meetings) drank four or more days a week. 70.6% of online- only and 49.1% of face-to-face-only members had five or more drinks on days they drank. Among members who went to both face-to-face and online meetings, 85.4% drank four or more days a week, and 53.8% had five or more drinks on drinking days. Effectiveness A 2009 study saw that subjects using just Moderation Management to reduce their drinking went from having only about one day a week abstinent from alcohol to having 1.5 days a week abstinent (e.g. they would drink six days one week and five days another week). The study reported that using MM along with an online drink tracker increased the number of days abstinent from alcohol to three or four days a week A 2012 paper argues that, while there is little scientific analysis of MM's efficacy, mutual support groups such as Moderation Management could be effective. History Moderation Management was founded by Audrey Kishline, a problem drinker, who did not identify with the disease theory of alcoholism finding that it eroded her self-confidence. Kishline found that she could moderate her drinking with the help of cognitive behavioral therapy principles and in 1994 created Moderation Management as an organization for non-dependent problem drinkers to help maintain moderate alcohol use. MM maintains, however, that it is not for all problem drinkers; that there are some drinkers for whom abstinence will be the only solution. Kishline had asked many professionals for advice while she was establishing the fellowship, including psychologist Jeffrey Schaler, who wrote the foreword for the first edition of the book, Moderate Drinking, used in the organization and served on the original board of trustees for MM. Schaler split ways with MM over two issues. The first being failure of MM's leadership to condemn member Larry Froistad after he confessed to murdering his daughter on an MM support group email list. The second being a disagreement with MM as to whether there was a medical distinction between problem drinkers and alcoholics. Schaler's foreword was replaced with one by historian Ernest Kurtz in subsequent editions. In January 2000 Kishline posted a message to an official MM email list stating that she had concluded her best drinking goal was abstinence and that she would begin attending Alcoholics Anonymous, SMART Recovery and Women for Sobriety meetings while continuing to support MM for others. In March 2000, while drunk, she drove her truck the wrong way down a highway, and hit another vehicle head-on killing its two passengers (a father and his twelve-year-old daughter). MM continued to grow during Kishline's time in prison. She was released in August 2003 after serving 3¬Ω years of her 4¬Ω year sentence. Kishline continued to drink once released from prison. Soon after she divorced from her husband and struggled to find work in part due to her felony conviction. She developed a friendship with the wife and mother of the victims of her drunk driving accident, and together they authored a book together on their relationship. She died at the age of 59 on December 19th, 2014. Her death was said to have been a suicide by two mental health professionals, but this was not confirmed by her family.

The railroad left the wharf fronting Dock Street and continued southward through a steep chasm to a sawmill located near South 38th Street. The railroad, the wharf, and the sawmill were owned and operated by brothers John F. and George E. Hart. The brothers owned and operated a wide variety of companies including (what Dilgard considers) the first legitimate opera house in Everett, Washington. The little narrow gauge road brought dimensional lumber materials from the Harts' sawmill to their wharf, largely for export to the lumber-hungry markets of San Francisco. Gauge conversion The early operations of the railroad appear to have been successful, but the Hart Brothers must have been concerned about their limited ability to expand their market base and move their product due to the fact they were unable to interchange cars with the Northern Pacific Railroad. A reconstruction program was initiated to convert the railroad from narrow to standard gauge. The two- mile road was apparently completed by May 1890 and the line became known officially as the Tacoma Eastern Railroad for the first time. Expansion Once incorporated, the Hart brothers set out to tap vast stands of virgin forests in the foothills of Mount Rainier by building southward through the gulch that now bears the name of that railroad. The Puyallup Indians used this route prior to pioneer settlement and referred to the gulch at the head of Commencement Bay as Wad Shum Shum, which means ‚Äúthe trail to high ground.‚Äù During this important building phase the Hart brothers managed to extend the railroad through the steep gulch, terminating about seven miles south of Tacoma near South 97th Street in a grove of virgin timber that is now the Midland neighborhood. Economic problems In 1892, the brothers fought valiantly to ward off the deleterious effects of a massive fire that destroyed their Tacoma sawmill. They attempted to salvage their commercial assets by leveraging their real estate holdings with ill-conceived bank notes. Although considered an accepted practice, the timing could not have been worse as the Economic Panic of 1893 spelled the eventual doom of the Hart Brothers and their far-flung enterprises. During this period of decline and decay, the Tacoma Eastern Railroad languished until the economy rebounded with the free- spending days of the Yukon Gold Rush of 1899.  Independent corporate control  Under the direction of the court-appointed bankruptcy receivers Ladd and Tilton Bank of Portland, Oregon, new life was breathed into the railroad. To facilitate the rehabilitation of the railroad, the bank turned to Michigan entrepreneur John Bagley. Bagley had owned and operated logging companies, sawmills, railroads, and a hotel. In 1899, the year that Mount Rainier National Park was established, Bagley was made president of the Tacoma Eastern and ambitiously set out to push the railroad another 60 miles to Ashford, Washington, the western gateway to the park. With construction financing covertly provided by the Chicago, Milwaukee, and St. Paul Railway, construction activities began in earnest. Unlike the stories of transcontinental railroad construction in America, the Tacoma Eastern Railroad was built with common labor provided mostly by Japanese, not Chinese immigrants. The last spike on the passenger line was driven at Ashford in the fall of 1904. However, the main freight line diverged away to the south and would not be completed until it pushed into Morton, Washington in 1910, another 15 miles away. Despite the fact the Northern Pacific Railroad had lobbied Congress and conducted a land swap with the Secretary of the Interior to expedite the formation of Mount Rainier National Park, the Tacoma Eastern Railroad managed to provide the best access for park visitors. Though it arrived too late in the 1904 season to have much impact upon Mount Rainier National Park, the Tacoma Eastern Railroad enjoyed virtually exclusive rail access to the scenic wonders of the mountain. With the railroad's arrival, Mount Rainier National Park would be profoundly changed. This was evident in the summer of 1905 when three of the nation's largest mountaineering clubs in America combined for a massive push to summit Mount Rainier. Until this point, access to the mountain was only achieved by horseback. The average tourist stay at the park was about a month. With rail passenger service from Tacoma taking about three hours, the scenic wonders of Mount Rainier National Park were now opened to a larger market of visitors including those who were inclined to stay only a week, or merely a day. As the automobile encroached upon the American landscape, the railroad stepped up efforts to ensure that it held on to its stake in the tourist transportation market by offering rides in open-topped motorized hacks. These machines were the precursor to comfortable auto stages and the price of riding these contraptions was eventually included in the train fare. For many visitors to the area, this was their first thrilling opportunity to ride in an automobile; even if it was slow, prone to mechanical failure, and offered no protection from the elements. Systematically, the auto-stages (and eventually the automobile) pushed aside the railroad as the primary means of passenger traffic. However, what the Tacoma Eastern Railroad became famous for was not moving passengers, but moving timber‚Äîbig timber and lots of it too. Ninety percent of all freight hauled by the railroad was extricated from the forests beneath Mount Rainier. Forty- and fifty-car trains were loaded with logs, lumber, cedar bolts, shingles, cordwood, wood pulp and delicately crafted wood trim. Of these materials, the logs were the most prevalent and many of these train cars were loaded with one enormous log that measured eight feet or more in diameter at the butt and could tip the scales at 40 tons. These massive logs were euphemistically referred to as ‚ÄúTacoma Toothpicks‚Äù. As the Tacoma Eastern Railroad's secret benefactor, the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway, was building their Pacific extension to Tacoma, the Tacoma Eastern was tasked with developing a new rail line between the communities of Frederickson and McKenna. Ultimately, through mergers and acquisitions, this line would become a vital link between Seattle and Portland. Eventually this line would serve an important role in shipping explosives, bombs and military equipment to and from Fort Lewis, Washington. First-person accounts of life on the Tacoma Eastern Railroad in those early days can be found in the riveting tales of the life of Harry French in a biography called Railroadman. Written by his son Chauncey Del French, Harry French was a two-fisted, hard-drinking, railroad boomer who by the age of 40 had accumulated over 25 years of service with various railroads. French's account of his father's life reads like pulp- fiction and indeed Chauncey Del French made many pulp-fiction contributions to detective magazines under an assumed name. However, the accounts found in Railroadman have been researched and verified for accuracy.  Subsidiary control  By July 1909, the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul had changed its name to the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific to better reflect the accomplishment of creating the shortest transcontinental route of any railroad between the Pacific coast and the Great Lakes. Upon arriving in Tacoma the veil of secrecy was lifted and the benefactor openly assumed control of the local railroad. Even though the Tacoma Eastern now had its headquarters in Chicago, it operated as an independent subsidiary of the parent road for nearly ten years. The only President to have ridden the rails of the Tacoma Eastern was William Howard Taft. In 1911, President Taft came to Tacoma specifically to visit Mount Rainier National Park. Taft arrived in early October but an early snow storm had preceded his arrival by a few days, making the Presidential trip rather arduous. The train trip took two and half hours from Tacoma to Ashford. Upon his arrival, he was whisked away in a motor carriage followed by a rather long entourage of escorting dignitaries and one car loaded with mechanics to ensure that the cantankerous carriages kept running. Accompanying the President was a team of horses used to effect an extraction of the Presidential motor coach when it became stuck in the rutted and frozen muck. Wanting to see as much as possible, President Taft insisted that his driver take him from Longmire Springs, where warm accommodations awaited, up to Paradise. Before arriving at Paradise, the Presidential car was so hopelessly stuck that it was thought that the President may have to spend the night on the mountain. Taft took the discomfort in stride and managed to make his way to Paradise, if only for a moment, before having to turn back for his train. By now, the Presidential entourage was spread across the mountainside for miles. Taft arrived back at the train over an hour late but told the train crew to delay the departure for at least a half-hour more to give his entourage an opportunity to catch the last train back to Tacoma. Stragglers faced the daunting prospect of riding back to Tacoma in the freezing cold or spending the night at one of the hotels on the mountain until the train returned in the morning. At the dawn of the First World War, most all American railroads were federalized the day after Christmas 1917. President Woodrow Wilson felt he had no alternative but to seize control of the railroads despite heroic efforts on the part of railroad tycoons to standardize schedules and supply much needed freight cars for the war effort in Europe. Walker Hines was appointed the Director-General of the US Railroad Administration. Under his direction the USRA set construction standards, lifted bothersome tariffs, and consolidated passenger services, all for the purposes of moving soldiers and machinery as efficiently as possible. Once the war was over and the USRA disbanded, federal control of the Tacoma Eastern Railroad was returned the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific. Immediately thereafter, on December 31, 1918, the Tacoma Eastern Railroad's assets were consolidated and its identity absorbed by the parent railroad.  Recent history  The Tacoma Eastern became known as the National Park branch of the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad. Between 1919 and 1980, the National Park branch would consistently be ranked the second most economically viable branch in the entire 1700-mile Milwaukee Road system. However, on March 15, 1980, the Milwaukee Road became the single largest railroad failure in American history. The former Tacoma Eastern portion of the railroad was conveyed to the Weyerhaeuser Corporation who used the line to move logs from Thurston and Lewis counties to a trans-loading facility at the Port of Tacoma for international export. =Mount Rainier Scenic Railroad= Weyerhaeuser Corporation operated the line almost exclusively for twelve years. The only other railroad activity the Weyerhaeuser Corporation tolerated was the development of the Mount Rainier Scenic Railroad. The Mount Rainier Scenic Railroad was the brainchild of L. T. ‚ÄúTom‚Äù Murray Jr., President of the Murray Pacific Corporation. The Mount Rainier Scenic was, and is today, an excursion road that shuttles passengers about seven miles on former Tacoma Eastern tracks through the foothills of Mount Rainier using antique train equipment. The primary emphasis of the Mount Rainier Scenic Railroad's historic collection is logging railroad equipment. The Mount Rainier Scenic Railroad has grown since 1980 from being a one-locomotive railroad to the world's only rail heritage group with one of each type of logging locomotive in working order. ;Geared locomotives Geared locomotives were built for power, not for speed, and were popular with logging companies who had to move heavy trains up and down grades safely. Four types of logging locomotives were utilized in the early twentieth century: the common rod engine, the Shay, the Heisler, and the Climax locomotives. The rod configuration has steam pistons which actuate rods attached to the wheels which, in turn, provide locomotion. The Shay configured geared-locomotive had two or more pistons that are mounted perpendicular to the boiler. Instead of actuating rods for locomotion, the pistons turned a crankshaft which ran the length of the engine on one side and engaged each of the wheels with a crown gear. The Heisler configured geared- locomotive always had two pistons cradling the boiler and is mounted to a central axle. This central axle was attached to the locomotive wheels much like a modern truck. The rarest of the logging locomotives is the Climax configured geared-locomotive. Climax locomotives have pistons that flank the boiler at a 45-degree angle. These pistons turn a flywheel which is connected to a central axle, thus providing locomotion. All of these geared locomotives are rare but there are only three Climax engines that can be seen today in working order. =The Boeing Train= Eventually economic development led to the need for further rail activity on the sparsely used Tacoma Eastern. The Boeing Company, with plants all along Puget Sound, finally submitted to political pressure at the Federal, State and local levels to site a production facility in Pierce County. Frederickson, a station on the old Tacoma Eastern line, was chosen as the preferred location. Here the Boeing Company constructed a massive aircraft wing assembly plant. The Weyerhaeuser Corporation had no interest in restructuring its railroad for common carrier service, but did allow a subcontractor to operate on 12 miles of track from Tacoma Junction to Frederickson. Until 1998, rail operations by the contractor were commonly referred to as simply \\"the Boeing Train\\". Weyerhaeuser ceased all rail operations in the south Puget Sound basin by 1992 and began selling off segments of the former Tacoma Eastern Railroad to the City of Tacoma. =Tacoma Rail= In November 1998, with the purchase of the railroad complete, contracts with the private rail operators were cancelled. Now the responsibility for operating and marketing the line fell to the City of Tacoma's railroad: the Tacoma Municipal Belt Line Railway. With the addition of the former Tacoma Eastern right-of-way, the City of Tacoma re-organized its railroad corporation and shortened its name to simply ‚ÄúTacoma Rail‚Äù. Since 1998, many miles of track have been rehabilitated and the number of rail customers has increased. In corporate literature, such as press releases and timetables, the former Tacoma Eastern is referred to as ‚ÄúThe Mountain Division‚Äù. Today, Tacoma Rail trains traverse the steep slopes of the Tacoma Eastern gulch bound for Fredrickson with carloads of lumber, aluminum, steel pipe, heavy machinery and grain. On alternate days, the train returns with aluminum briquettes, cedar fencing and siding. Plans In an effort to reduce the carbon footprint and alleviate traffic and parking congestion, plans are in the works to re-introduce passenger excursion service from Tacoma to Mount Rainier National Park.

He was elected leader of the provisional revolutionary government and following the Outer Mongolian Revolution of 1921 became the country's first Prime Minister from July 1921 to January 1922. A power struggle led to his resignation on January 7, 1922. He was subsequently charged with treason for conspiring to overthrow the government, and was executed on August 31, 1922. Early life The Russian Consulate in Niislel H√ºree where Bodoo taught and headed the Consular Hill group Bodoo was born in 1885 in Mandshir Hutagt in present-day T√∂v Province. He obtained his elementary education at the Manjusri Monastery and then studied at the Mongolian Language and Literature School in Kh√ºree (present-day Ulan Bator). He later became a scribe at the Shaviyn Yaam (religious affairs office) and then a Mongolian Language teacher at the Russian-Mongolian School for Translators.

On January 7, 1922 Bodoo resigned from all of his positions within the government, ostensibly for health reasons.Baabar 1999, p. 231 Death Danzan nevertheless pursued charges against Bodoo until he was convicted of conspiring with reactionary enemies to destroy the government. Bodoo and several other former ministers, including his predecessor Dambyn Chagdarjav, were arrested and interrogated by a Russian agent. Bodoo, along with 14 other \\"dissenters\\", was executed by shooting on August 31, 1922.Sanders 1996, p. 27 To blunt criticism of Bodoo's execution by powerful religious groups (Bodoo was a lama), party leaders including S√ºhkbaatar invited the Hutagt, or saint incarnate, Jalkhanz Khutagt Sodnomyn Damdinbazar to become the next prime minister.Sanders 1996, p, 49 Following his death, Bodoo was stigmatized by official historians as a traitor and counter-revolutionary, especially during Choibalsan's rule. His contributions to the revolution were, for the most part ignored and forgotten. Bodoo was rehabilitated in 1962.

Herman surrendered his medical license in 1991 when prosecutors agreed they would, in return, drop civil charges of gross negligence, incompetence, dishonesty and other offenses.

In the search for a remedy for her cancer, he met with Dr. Stephen Herman, who claimed that Viroxan could boost the immune system and could get rid of many diseases, including cancer. Donald Nixon gave his wife Trixolan and claimed that it cured his wife's cancer and her arthritis. Nixon asked the Federal Government for $300 million to test the drug.

At high doses, it exhibits analgesic activity which is not fully reversed by opioid antagonists, suggesting that the drug has both opioid and non-opioid mechanisms of action. Side effects of fentanyl analogs are similar to those of fentanyl itself, which include itching, nausea and potentially serious respiratory depression, which can be life-threatening.

The building The church building was designed by architect Richard Upjohn and built in 1845‚Äì46, when the area had a much more residential character. It is a relatively simple expression of Gothic Revival architecture, and is notable as the first building in which Upjohn used asymmetry in a church's massing. The building was remodeled in 1912 by Cram, Goodhue & Ferguson with a parish house addition. The parish house connects with the church through several narrow, twisting stairwells and passages. History 1886 engraving 2007 view By 1829, the population of Providence was spreading from the east side of the Providence River to the west. 25 parishioners of the St. John's Episcopal Church on Providence's East Side built a small church on the site of the old Providence Theater on the west side. By 1835 the congregation grew to 260, and by 1844, the building was becoming too small and unsafe. Richard Upjohn, the foremost architect of his time, was hired to design a new building on the same site. The new (current) building was completed in 1846. Grace Church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. By the early 21st Century, the church was badly in need of repair, suffering from crumbling stonework and leaky stained glass windows. The closing of the Cathedral of St. John in 2012 put added pressure on Grace Church. In 2015, a multimillion- dollar restoration project was undertaken to expand and preserve Grace Church. In addition to repairs, the old parish hall will be extended with an accessible glass-enclosed single-story structure, which will allow the church to host suppers and events. Parishioners When Grace Church was established, the neighborhood around Westminster Street was more residential and the church was associated with Providence's Protestant elite. The church cemetery is located at Elmwood Avenue and Broad Street, about a mile from the church. * Rhode Island Governor Elisha Dyer and his family were members of Grace Church. * Rhode Island Governor Nehemiah R. Knight and Senator Albert C. Greene are buried in the church cemetery. * Soprano Matilda Sissieretta Joyner Jones is buried in the church cemetery. After a long period of declining residential character, the Providence downtown is once again growing in population.

The baron was an Italian patriot exiled from Naples, living in Florence. Laura Bellelli's countenance is dignified and austere, her gesture connected with those of her daughters. Her husband, by contrast, appears to be separated from his family. His association with business and the outside world is implied by his position at his desk. Giulia holds a livelier pose than that of her sister Giovanna, whose restraint appears to underscore the familial tensions. Background Oil sketch of Giulia. In 1856 Degas left his home in Paris to study art and visit family relations in Italy, arriving in Naples on 17 July. In 1857 he traveled between Naples, where he stayed with his grandfather, Hilaire Degas, and Rome. At the end of July 1858 Laura Bellelli wrote to Degas from Naples, inviting him to stay with her in Florence; it was there that Gennaro Bellelli, who had been a political journalist supporting the fight for Italy's independence, took refuge from Austrian persecution after defeat of the Revolution of 1848. Degas arrived in Florence by 4 August, living with his uncle Gennaro and making studies in the Uffizi.Boggs; et al. 1988, p. 51. By September he had become bored, did not get along well with Gennaro,Boggs; et al. 1988, p. 80. and remained only to see Laura, Giovanna, and Giulia, who had prolonged their stay in Naples following the death of Degas' grandfather Hilaire on 31 August. That there were strains within the Bellelli household at the time was almost certainly noticed by Degas, and confirmed by another uncle: \\"The domestic life of the family in Florence is a source of unhappiness for us. As I predicted, one of them is very much at fault and our sister a little, too.\\"Reff. 1976, p. 95 Laura subsequently confided to Degas that, living in exile, she missed her Neapolitan family, and further, that her husband was \\"immensely disagreeable and dishonest... Living with Gennaro, whose detestable nature you know and who has no serious occupation, shall soon lead me to the grave.\\" Laura Bellelli was pregnant at the time, and it has been suggested that this circumstance, and the subsequent death of the child in infancy, may have contributed to her unhappiness and to domestic tensions in general.Sutton. 1986, p. 43. These conflicts would provide both background and content for the painting. Process After his aunt and cousins returned in early November 1858, Degas undertook a series of works that would eventually culminate in The Bellelli Family. It appears that he initially planned to paint a vertical composition depicting his aunt and her two daughters in a pyramidical grouping.Baumann; Karabelnik; et al. 1994, p. 21. He painted his cousins in their black dresses and white pinafores, while his father wrote letters from Paris, offering advice on how best to proceed with the project, and impatiently awaited his return. Degas wrote of Giulia and Giovanna: > \\"The elder one was in fact a little beauty. The younger one, on the other > hand, was smart as can be and kind as an angel. I am painting them in > mourning dress and small white aprons, which suit them very well‚Ä¶I would > like to express a certain natural grace together with a nobility that I > don't know how to define....\\" At year's end, Degas stopped work on the double portrait of his young cousins in order to begin a larger painting; it is unclear whether he was undertaking The Bellelli Family itself, or making preparatory sketches. The preparatory works include portrait studies and compositional details in pencil, pastel, and oil. One drawing indicates Degas' initial intention to have Gennaro Bellelli seated at the end of the table,Sutton. 1986, pp. 39-40. and an oil sketch placed him standing behind his daughters; finally, Degas painted him in the armchair. Study of Hands, an oil sketch of Laura Bellelli's hands. Mus√©e d'Orsay. For Jean Sutherland Boggs, \\"the hands of the Bellellis play like the hands of mimes to give an indication of the relative composure of each family member.\\"Boggs; et al. 1988, p. 23. In late March 1859, Degas left Florence to return to Paris. Other than the conclusion that Degas worked on the picture \\"for several years\\",Boggs; et al. 1988, p. 79. there is no documentation to confirm the actual time or place at which the picture was painted; a likely scenario is that Degas brought to France numerous sketches and studies and painted the picture in a studio procured for this purpose in Paris. Supporting this conclusion is the observation that the Bellelli's apartment was too small to host such a large work, and there were no studio facilities. In March 1860, Degas returned to Italy, in part to conduct family business, and in April he again visited the Bellellis and made several drawings of his uncle; at some point he also executed a pastel which, but for some differences in details and a greater elaboration of the interior in the final painting, is close to the ultimate composition.Sutton. 1986, p. 40. There is a family account, once accepted but more recently deemed unlikely, that offers a different version: a Neapolitan lawyer who married one of Degas' grandnieces claimed that the painting was completed in Italy, and brought back to France only some forty to fifty years later, but this is contradicted by evidence that the painting was exhibited in the Paris Salon of 1867. Composition and content The work of many artists provided inspiration: at this time Degas included in his correspondence mention of Anthony van Dyck, Giorgione, and Botticelli, among others. Other prototypes whose influence have been cited, particularly in terms of composition, include 17th-century Dutch genre and portrait painting,Reff. 1976, pp. 26-27. the portrait studies of Ingres,Reff. 1976, p. 48. Vel√°zquez's Las Meninas,Reff. 1976, p. 95 the portraits of Hans Holbein, the Family of Charles IV by Francisco Goya, Gustave Courbet's After Dinner at Ornans, and a lithograph by Honor√© Daumier entitled A Man of Property.Boggs; et al. 1988, p. 82. As in Las Meninas, a picture, mirror, and doorway are used to expand the space of the interior.Reff. 1976, p. 95 Any and all historical models were synthesized into a composition that was \\"unique in the painter's oeuvre and unique among the works of his contemporaries.\\" Taking Degas' family and their living environment as its subject, the painting represented Degas' first attempt \\"to characterize a room in relation to the personalities and interests of the individuals who inhabit it.\\"Reff. 1976, p. 143. Las Meninas. Diego Vel√°zquez, 1656. Oil on canvas. Las Meninas may have inspired Degas to extend the space of the apartment by employing some of the same elements: here, too, a picture, a doorway, and a reflected image are prominent.Reff. 1976, p. 95 Viewed alongside the work of Degas' contemporaries, the painting's uniqueness was due in large part to the composition, which presents a family portrait painted on the grand scale of a historical drama, and whose content has been interpreted as psychologically penetrating, with the placement of the figures suggestive of the parents' alienation from one another, and of the divided loyalties of their children.Reff. 1976, p. 27. Laura Bellelli stands as if for an official portrait, her expression indicative of her unhappiness, one hand resting protectively on Giovanna's shoulder, the other balancing her pregnant body; Giulia, in the center of the painting and seated in a small chair, displays youthful restlessness as she faces, arms akimbo, in the direction of her father, and is the compositional link between her estranged parents. Gennaro appears indifferent, turned toward but seated apart from his family, his face mostly in shadow. The commanding figure of Laura is placed against a flat wall and a crisp picture frame, while Gennaro's more recessive figure is framed by a mantelpiece, bric-a-brac, and a reflective mirror. The clarity of the former's surroundings and the ambiguity of the latter's have been interpreted as expressive of their emotional distance.Reff. 1976, p. 95-96 Telling, also, is the physical distance between them, as well as the difference in their postures. Their opposition has been seen as a \\"breaking of the frame\\": \\"it is as if [Gennaro] were morosely watching his family as they pose for his painter nephew\\".Baumann; Karabelnik; et al. 1994, p. 193. The family dog glimpsed at the lower right corner is, according to Arthur Danto, sensibly \\"sneaking out of the picture before all hell breaks loose\\".Danto 1988, p. 658. One is reminded of Laura Bellelli's note to Degas after he had returned to Paris: \\"You must be very happy to be with your family again, instead of being in the presence of a sad face like mine and a disagreeable one like my husband's.\\"Reff. 1976, p. 97. Interior Scene (The Rape), 1868-1869. As in The Bellelli Family, Degas used physical distance to express emotional disconnection between a male and female figure.Reff. 1976, p. 216. The drawing hung on the wall behind them is a portrait of the recently deceased Hilaire Degas, and was presumably a study for the portraits Degas made of his grandfather, drawn in the style of the Clouets.Reff. 1976, pp. 96-97. By placing it directly behind his aunt's head, Degas was connecting the generations of his family, and following a convention of portraiture used since the Renaissance, that of including ancestral effigies.Reff. 1976, pp. 96-97. By its very placement Degas was implicitly affirming his own presence and identifying with Laura, with whom, as their correspondence attests, he was unusually close.Reff. 1976, p. 97. The unease of The Bellelli Family was not an anomaly, nor were such tensions revealed solely through the study of portraiture; in fact, alienation between the sexes was a recurring condition in Degas' work of the 1860s. Sulking and Interior Scene (The Rape) are both works of ambiguous content set in contemporary Paris, and The Young Spartan Girls Provoking the Boys and The Misfortunes of the City of Orleans occur in the ancient and medieval eras, yet in each \\"the element of hostility between the sexes is apparent\\",Reff. 1976, p. 216. and in the latter the hostility has turned deadly. The Bellelli Family is notable for introducing psychological conflict in a painting that documents his own family. Given his usual discretion, it is reasonable to assume that such expressions were the product of Degas' unconscious mind.Reff. 1976, pp. 216-217.Sutton. 1986, p. 44. Exhibition history and provenance The painting was almost certainly conceived as an exhibition piece, for it is doubtful that Degas would have painted something so ambitious in scale for purely private satisfaction. In April 1859 Degas wrote his father asking him to look for a studio in Paris so that he could work on an unspecified project; probably The Bellelli Family was the work he had in mind, and it is believed that the painting was eventually exhibited in the Salon of 1867. Although reviews made no mention of the picture, that this is the painting which Degas exhibited under the title of Family Portrait is supported by several pieces of evidence: a critic who later visited Degas in his studio referred to \\"the admirable Family Portrait of 1867\\"; in 1881 the painter Jean-Jacques Henner discussed Degas' withdrawal from the Salons because his work was badly hung and ignored as a result, adding \\"The portrait of his brother-in-law (I believe) and his family is a great work\\"; and the fact that Degas requested permission at the last minute to retouch his submissions to the 1867 Salon, and that the hasty reworking would account for the picture's later crackling and blackish streaks.Boggs; et al. 1988, pp. 79-80. The Bellelli Family remained with Degas until his last move in 1913, at which time he left it with his dealer, Paul Durand- Ruel.Boggs; et al. 1988, p. 77. The painting was not seen again publicly until after Degas's death, when it was put up for sale in 1918 as part of the painter's estate.Boggs; et al. 1988, pp. 80, 82. Its unexpected appearance created a sensation, and The Bellelli Family was immediately purchased by the Mus√©e du Luxembourg for 400,000 francs. In 1947 the painting was exhibited in the Mus√©e d'Impressionisme (Jeu-de-Paumes), and subsequently moved to the Mus√©e d'Orsay. Condition At the time of its sale in 1918, the painting was in poor condition. In addition to the black streaks and crackling, it had tears and was dust-covered, and may have been kept by Degas for many years rolled-up in the corner of his successive studios. At some point, possibly in the 1890s, Degas restored the painting, sewing up tears, applying gesso to them, repainting Laura Bellelli's face, and retouching those of his uncle and cousins. However, prior to the painting's sale a restorer apparently misinterpreted these repairs and scraped them off, re-injuring the portraits of Gennaro and Giulia. The painting was subsequently restored in the 1980s. Assessment When exhibited at the sale of Degas' atelier in 1918, the picture elicited some confusion from critics; one called it \\"as dull as a Flemish interior, although the dry technique is distinctive.\\" Most of the reviews were positive, and with the country at war, The Bellelli Family was seen as possessing a distinctly French character, a \\"modern primitive\\" that bore comparison to the Avignon Pieta. Since then, biographers of Degas have acknowledged it as the masterpiece of his youth.Sutton, 1986, p. 44. References Sources * Baumann, Felix; Karabelnik, Marianne, et al. Degas Portraits.

The receipt lists a \\"downtown office\\" address in the Howard Building at 171 Westminster Street. Building at 93 Cranston Street The main building was a long two-story brick structure with modest Georgian Colonial Revival styling built in 1906, with an office block at one end, added in 1925. Its frontispiece featured a \\"projecting pedimented entrance.\\" Louttit moved to the 93 Cranston Street location in 1918, where the What Cheer Laundry (purchased by Loutitt) had operated since 1901. Loutitt operated from a 1906 building built by the What Cheer proprietors, and expanded in 1925 with the construction of this larger facility. At that time, Louttit was the largest laundry facility in Rhode Island, with over 150 employees and 16 locations. The building complex was sold in 1985 for 1.2 million dollars, and it closed two years later. A fire in 2001 destroyed most of the original 1906 building, leaving only the 1925 building standing. Vacant lot at 93 Cranston Street, after demolition of Louttit Laundry The ground under the lot was contaminated over the years with cleaning chemicals and heating oil, requiring an extensive cleanup before the land could be used again. In 2005, the city received a $200,000 grant from the Environmental Protection Agency for a cleanup. The building sat vacant from 1897 to 2008 and appeared on preservationist lists several times. The city foreclosed on the property in 1999. Unfortunately, the soil contamination was judged so bad that the only way to clean up the site would be to take down the building. Even efforts to keep Cranston Street Fa√ßade intact were decided in the end to be impractical. The city's Historic District Commission gave permission for demolition in October 2007, and in December 2008 the entire structure was demolished by the J.R. Vinagro Corp. As of 2012, the site has not been developed, and remains a vacant lot. Preservation efforts In an effort to attract attention to the site, the Providence Preservation Society listed the site on their Most Endangered List seven times, as well as listing it on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004.

A side-project of the band, formed in 1970 was Daddy Cool, which played 1950s doo-wop music plus some originals. Daddy Cool were to eclipse their parent band when their debut single \\"Eagle Rock\\" reached No. 1 on the Australian National charts. NOTE: Used for Australian Singles and Albums charting from 1970 until ARIA created their own charts in mid-1988. History =Background= Sons of the Vegetal Mother brought together the four musicians who subsequently became Daddy Cool, Ross Wilson and Ross Hannaford (both ex The Pink Finks, The Party Machine) and singer-drummer Gary Young and bassist Wayne Duncan, who had both been members of veteran Melbourne band The Rondells, who are best known as the backing group for pioneering beat duo Bobby & Laurie. In early 1969, Wilson had been invited to go to the UK and join \\"progressive pop\\" band Procession. That band (which had evolved from Normie Rowe's backing group The Playboys) had relocated to Britain in 1968 but their career had stalled and they were trying to revitalise the group and find a new direction, to which end they invited Wilson to come to London to join the band. Having just received an insurance payout for a road accident he had suffered in his teens, Wilson broke up his band of the time, The Party Machine, and flew to London to join Procession. > \\"I received a phone call from Brian Peacock in the UK. They were having a > line up change and felt a front man might be a good idea. I had to pay my > own way there but had just scored an insurance payoff from a traffic injury > and was eager to escape Melbourne and see the world.\\" Wilson arrived in London in April 1969 and the revamped Procession gigged sporadically over the next three months. During this period, they got the opportunity to record some new material at Olympic Studios in Barnes. and three tracks were cut at these sessions‚ÄîMick Rogers' \\"Surrey\\" and Wilson's \\"Papa's in the Vice Squad\\" and \\"I Wanna Be Loved\\", all of which were consigned to the vaults and are yet to see the light of day. By this time, Procession's music had taken on a new direction, with Wilson adding a more theatrical feel thanks to his interest in Frank Zappa. One of the new songs incorporated into the set (but never recorded by the band) was \\"Make Your Stash\\". > \\"[It] was later recorded by both Spectrum and Daddy Cool and the source for > inspiration for Manfred Mann's Earth Band album that used Gustav Holst's > Planets Suite. \\"Make Your Stash\\" used one of the themes from that suite with > my lyrics and bridge which Mick appropriated for Manfred Mann using new > lyrics.\\" It is worth noting that Zappa also 'borrowed' a small section of Gustav Holst's The Planets - Jupiter movement on the track Invocation & Ritual Dance Of The Young Pumpkin on the Absolutely Free Album of 1967. By June 1969 Procession was on its last legs, but manager David Joseph secured an unusual final booking for the band‚Äîa transatlantic student cruise from London to New York and back, set for the second week in August 1969, which was the trip was supposed to help pay off the band's outstanding debts. > \\"It was the best thing we did,\\" says Wilson. \\"[It was] a lot of fun and we > got to play every night and join in some cool arty student performance stuff > during the day.\\" When they returned to London in August, Procession had effectively run its course: > \\"[We] ran out of money and industry interest,\\" adds Wilson. \\"By then > manager, David Joseph was more interested in the New Seekers, plus I think > the new line up [with me and Chris] had meant the group lost whatever focus > it had.\\" =Formation= Wilson returned to Melbourne in late 1969, armed with a swag of new material, intent on creating an \\"esoteric special-occasion progressive band\\" with a floating line-up of semi-regular members and guest players, which would allow him to explore the progressive/theatrical interests that his passion for Zappa had awakened. The Vegetals performed intermittently at multimedia and art events, 'happenings' and concerts at Melbourne galleries and venues like the TF Much Ballroom. Band 'members' at these events included Wilson and Hannaford's former Party Machine cohort Mike Rudd (later in Spectrum) and bassist Tim Partidge (Company Caine) and it was planned that other performers would join in, such as Wilson's friends Keith Glass and Gulliver Smith. The Vegetals made few recordings‚Äîtheir only known release is Garden Party, a custom-pressed EP played at and given away to audiences at an event/exhibition called 'The Garden Party'. The EP was never commercially released. One track from the EP, \\"Make It Begin\\", was anthologised on Golden Miles, Raven's 2CD compilation of Australian progressive rock, and more recently \\"Love is the Law\\" and \\"Make It Begin\\" were included on Ross Wilson' career retrospective Now Listen!. Snippets of footage of the Vegetals in performance can be seen Chris Lofven's experimental short film 806 which is now included as a special feature in the DVD edition of Lofven's 1976 feature film OZ. Wilson, Hannaford, Young and Duncan also created a 'subset' of the Vegetals, dubbed Daddy Cool, which was devised to provide 'light relief', playing short, enjoyable sets of 1950s-style doo-wop and rock & roll between the Vegetals' lengthy, exploratory sets, playing Wilson's Zappa-influenced progressive pieces, but over time it became obvious that Daddy Cool was getting more popular than the \\"main act\\" Sons of the Vegetal Mother were part of the line-up at one of Australia's first outdoor rock festivals at Myponga in South Australia at the end of January 1971, and this proved to be a watershed in the group's short career. The enthusiastic reception given to Daddy Cool's set eclipsed the Vegetals' performance, making it clear that Daddy Cool was taking on a life of its own, and Sons of the Vegetal Mother was soon phased out altogether. It was during the Myponga performance that Lofven filmed the footage that was later used in his promotional film-clip for \\"Eagle Rock\\". A few months after Myponga, Daddy Cool was spotted by former teen guitar prodigy turned producer Robie Porter they signed to the Sparmac label, and in May 1971 they released their debut single \\"Eagle Rock\\". The single quickly reached No. 1 and stayed there for a (then) record ten weeks. Wilson and Hannaford used the Sons of the Vegetal Mother band name when playing at the Station Hotel, Prahran in the short period between Daddy Cool and the launch of Mighty Kong in 1973.

Just for the event, traffic authorities close off two lanes of one of Singapore's busiest streets for the duration of the race that is usually held in the morning from 7am onwards. The flag-off for the mile begins near the Dhoby Ghaut MRT station and ends near Orchard MRT station where participants run past famous landmarks such as the Istana, the President's place of residence. History The Anlene Orchard Mile was first launched in Singapore in 2007 and was sponsored by Anlene, a dairy nutrition corporation. The aim is to highlight the risk of osteoporosis and raise bone health awareness about building strong bones from within through a sufficient calcium intake of milk everyday coupled with weight bearing exercises as well as to foster the growth and recognition of women in sports in Singapore. The inaugural event in 2007 saw over 2,000 female participants taking part with local TV and radio celebrities lending their name to the cause. Although Anlene Orchard Mile is a running event, participants can walk the race according to their own fitness level. For 2007 and 2008, the official beneficiary of the Anlene Orchard Mile has been the Osteoporosis Society of Singapore (the local chapter of the International Osteoporosis Foundation), where a portion of the proceeds goes to the society. The Anlene Orchard Mile is modelled against successful mile events around the world including the prestigious Fifth Avenue Mile in New York and the Sport Relief Mile which attracts over 10,000 runners and walkers to 15 events across England. Entrants The Anlene Orchard Mile comprises three categories ‚Äì the Elite Mile, the Women's Mile and the Corporate Mile. The Elite Mile is an invitational category with a cash prize that is open to competitive runners where past race records are compulsory for verification before an invitation is extended for participation by the organisers. The Anlene Orchard Mile 2007 Elite category winner was Suzy Walsham, a two-time winner of the U.S. Empire State Building Run-up, who walked away with a cash prize of SGD10,500. The Women's Mile is a category open to women of all ages and fitness levels. The Corporate Mile is targeted at corporations where female employees are encouraged to participate in groups of four or more.

The building was constructed in 1775 and designed by a prominent local architect Joseph Brown and Declaration of Independence signer Stephen Hopkins. The bottom floor of the house was used as a market and the upper level was used for holding meetings. Similar buildings existed in other American cities, such as Faneuil Hall in Boston and the Old Brick Market in Newport. The building housed the Providence City Council in the decades before the completion of City Hall. Architecture The primary architect was for the Market House was Joseph Brown. Brown was Providence's top architect at the time. His previous commissions included University Hall at Brown University and the First Baptist Meeting House. He was assisted in the design by Stephen Hopkins. The building was originally two stories in height, topped by a low gable roof. In 1797, a third floor was added to the house, which housed the first Masonic Lodge in Rhode Island. Except for the eastern end, the first floor is surrounded on all sides by an arcade of large round arches. The east gable features a large bull's-eye window; the west gable features a clock. In 1833, architect James C. Bucklin designed a two-story addition on the east end of the building. This addition provided an entrance to the third story Masonic hall. History In August 1771, a petition signed by a number of townspeople was presented to the General Assembly, asking for a market house. The General Assembly raised funds through a lottery to erect a building in a location proposed by David Bucklin. Excavations on Market House began on May 25, 1773 and was completed in 1775. Almost immediately, Market House became the center of civic life in Providence, due to its central location at the east end of the Weybosset Bridge. On March 2, 1775 residents gathered here to show their resistance to British taxation by burning British tea. During the American Revolution, the buildings were used as a barracks for French soldiers encamped in Providence. The building's third floor housed the first Masonic Lodge in Rhode Island. Thomas Smith Webb was a member of the lodge, and in 1802 Webb organized St. John's Encampment Number One, which was the first Knights Templar organization in America. Market Square in 1844. Market House in center. In 1832, Providence Mayor Samuel W. Bridgham moved Providence City Council to meet in Market House. At first, the City Council, Mayor's Office, and Board of Aldermen were located on the second floor. As the city grew, the city government purchased the third floor from the Masons, and eventually occupied the entire building, which was then renamed the \\"City Building.\\" By 1845 the city government outgrew the building and drew up plans to build a new City Hall. By 1878 the new City Hall was completed and the city vacated Market House. In the years after the city left the building, tenants included the Providence Board of Trade (later known as the Chamber of Commerce), the Henry Lippitt Company, several manufacturing companies, a barber, the Rhode Island Poultry Association, and the Rhode Island Electric Light Company. Market Square and Westminster Street were the first parts of Providence to receive electric street lights. The building underwent some restoration work in the 1930s, and by 1940 the building was restored to its 1833 appearance. In 1948, Mayor Dennis J. Roberts signed a deed to give the building to the Rhode Island School of Design, with the provision that the exterior of the building be maintained. Architect John Hutchins Cady was hired to remodel the interior with classrooms and studios. A pair of plaques on the exterior wall marks the highest water levels reached during the Great Storm of 1815 and the Hurricane of 1938. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.

Founded by 1139, it was dissolved in 1536 as part of Henry VIII's dissolution of the monasteries. History The large settlement of Hatfield was well established by the time of the Norman Conquest, and the Domesday Book lists the presence of a Saxon church. At one time a royal manor of Harold I, it fell into the possession of William I at the Norman Conquest. Popular for hunting in the neighbouring forest, the royal estate came to be known as Hatfield Regis (Latin for the king's Hatfield).\\"The Monastery of Hatfield Regis\\", Rev. Alan Jones. Displayed in Hatfield Broad Oak church The Benedictine monastery itself was founded in or before 1139, one of the five religious communities of that order to be founded in Essex. The priory was a daughter house of the Breton monastery of St. Melanius in Rennes, and was dedicated to \\"God, St Mary, and St. Melanius Redonensis\\". It was thus considered an \\"alien priory\\" as it was subordinate to a monastery outside England.Frederic J. Longrais, \\"Les moines de l'abbaye Saint Melaine en Angleterre. Les chartes du prieur√© d'Hatfield R√©gis,\\" Recueil de travaux offert √† M. Clovis Brunel, v. 2, (Paris, 1955). In around 1230 a fire destroyed part of the priory church, for whose repairs Henry III granted ten oaks each from the forests of Hatfield and Wristle. John Lydgate, the poet, was elected prior in 1423 but resigned the office a few years later to concentrate on his travels and writing. =Disputes= A dispute over tithes from the royal manor of Hatfield granted to the Augustinian canons of St. Botolph, Colchester, by King Henry I continued for decades. A compromise was established by two clerical commissioners appointed by the pope in 1194, but the issue was not entirely resolved for several more years. Another dispute arose over the appointment of the prior. The de Vere earls of Oxford and the abbot of St. Melanie both claimed the right, resulting in a series of unpleasant episodes in 1235. The matter was appealed to Rome, and in 1236 Pope Gregory IX ordered commissioners to hear the matter. A final settlement was reached eighteen years later. On the death of the prior, the Hatfield monks were to ask permission of the earl of Oxford to hold an election. The new prior would be presented to the earl, who would request his confirmation by the bishop of London. The prior was to notify the abbot and convent of Rennes of the death of his predecessor and of his own election and confirmation.Historical Manuscripts Commission Report, viii, 632. This is an example of an assertion of practical independence by an English cell of a foreign monastery. The priory reached its peak in the first half of the fourteenth century with its great church, 230 feet in length, dominating the local countryside. =Dissolution= The priory was dissolved in 1536 by Henry VIII's Dissolution of the Monasteries. At the time only the prior and four monks lived there, though had thirty servants to attend to their needs. The tithes and patronage were initially granted to Barking Abbey but after Barking was dissolved they were given to Trinity College, Cambridge, by Henry VIII in 1546. The tomb effigy of Robert de Vere, 3rd Earl of Oxford was reportedly moved from the priory chapel to the parish church at Hatfield. Some parts of the priory church remain as part of St Mary's parish church. The remaining buildings were dismantled and no trace remains of them above ground where they stood in the field to the north of the church.

Almuric is a science fiction novel by American writer Robert E. Howard. It was originally serialized in three parts in the magazine Weird Tales beginning in May 1939. The novel was first published in book form in 1964 by Ace Books. The novel features a muscular hero known on earth as Esau Cairn, a complete misfit in modern America who \\"belongs in a simpler age\\". Exploited by a corrupt political boss whom he finally kills with his bare hands, Cairn must flee. A sympathetic scientist helps him get through space to a world known as Almuric, by unspecified scientific methods. There he finds a life to which he is more fitted, encountering both frightening monsters as well as beautiful women. Cairn becomes known as Iron Hand due to his powerful punches and boxing skills. The novel shares similar elements with the John Carter of Mars series by Edgar Rice Burroughs Plot The novel is a planetary romance which stars Esau Cairn, an Earth-man of great physical strength and prowess. The novel begins narrated by scientist Professor Hildebrand, who describes Cairn's life on Earth prior to traveling to Almuric. Cairn is described as an honorable man who was \\"born out of his time\\" in terms of his temperament and physical abilities. He attempted brief careers in college football and boxing, but had to abandon both due to severely injuring opponents due to his incredible strength. From then, he became a wanderer, seeking his place in the world but unable to find one. After an altercation with a corrupt political official that left the official dead, Cairn became a wanted fugitive of the law. In an effort to hide Cairn from a confrontation with the law, Professor Hildebrand used an experimental teleporter to send Cairn to the planet Almuric. Upon arriving on Almuric, Cairn battles a Gura, ape-like humanoids that inhabit the planet. Despite the Gura possessing greater physical strength, Cairn was able to defeat him using his boxing skills. After taking the Gura's sword, he then lives off the land for a long period of time, taking his already incredible physical abilities to new heights and learning to hunt and fend off the wild beasts of Almuric. After attempting to save another Gura from an attack by a \\"sabretooth leopard\\", Cairn decides he needs human companionship and decides to seek civilization. He comes to the city of Koth and is taken prisoner by the inhabitants. There, he learns that despite the males being very hairy and ape-like, the women have hairless bodies and are beautiful by human standards. The explanation for this is that the male Guras endure all hardships and evolved to be powerful and animalistic, while female Guras are shielded from hardship and evolved to be soft and beautiful. While in captivity, Cairn notices he has captured the interest of Altha, a beautiful Gura female, and becomes infatuated with her. Cairn learns that the Gura who he defeated upon entering Almuric was Logar of Thurga, who is from a rival tribe and considered to be one of the finest warriors on Almuric. This claim leads to the Koths offering Cairn the opportunity to join their tribe if he can defeat their finest warrior, Ghor the Bear, in a wrestling match. Cairn succeeds in defeating Ghor and is welcomed to the tribe. Cairn enjoys life with the Koth and feels he has finally found a world in which he belongs. While on a hunt, he discovers that Altha has left the city of Koth and seeks another life. He decides to escort her back to Koth but on their return, they are overtaken by a pack of Yagas. The Yagas are described as athletic winged men, with hawk- like faces and shiny black skin. Despite Cairn's efforts, Altha is kidnapped by the Yagas. Cairn captures a Yaga and forces him to carry him in pursuit of the Yaga pack. Upon arriving at the Yaga camp, he sees that they have been eviscerated by beasts described as having bodies \\"like those of deformed apes, covered with sparse dirty white fur. Their heads were doglike, with small close-set ears. But their eyes were those of serpents--the same venomous steady lidless stare.\\" The beasts have captured Altha, who Cairn rescues after defeating them and a large spider-like creature. Attempting to journey back to Koth, Cairn and Altha are captured by warriors of Thugra led by Logar, who seeks vengeance for his earlier defeat by Cairn. Cairn is chained and imprisoned in a Thugra prison, while Altha escapes and stays hidden, aided by sympathetic women in the city. Thugra is attacked by a massive army of Yagas, who raid the city to capture female slaves. The city is destroyed and in the carnage, Altha attempts to aid Cairn in an escape. Logar enters the cell and is killed by Cairn, who is still chained. Cairn and hundreds of women are captured by the Yagas; some are butchered and eaten by the Yagas while others are flown to Ugg, the Yaga capital city. Cairn is kept a prisoner in Ugg, where he learns that the female slaves are treated with inhuman cruelty, often tortured, killed, or eaten at the whims of the Yaga people, who possess little to no compassion or sympathy for other races. The Yaga women are wingless, having their wings clipped at an early age so that they remain dependent and subservient of the males. Only one Yaga female is allowed to keep her wings, the queen Yasmeena. He also learns that other humanoid races exist on Almuric; he sees slave women of other races and the Yagas are served by a less intelligent species of blue humanoid called Akkas, who live at the base of the cliff which holds their city and worship the Yagas as gods. The Yaga queen Yasmeena takes an interest in Cairn due to his unusual physical appearance (unusual by Almuric standards‚Äîhairless with white skin and blue eyes). During a meeting in her chamber, Cairn feigns drunken unconsciousness and Yasmeena leaves to attend other matters. He discovers a tunnel in the floor which leads to a temple in which the Akkas worship the Yaga. He escapes the city and heads to Koth, to assemble an army to return to Ugg and rescue the women. On his journey home, he chances to meet the Koth army, who are on their way to battle the Khor, a rival tribe. He convinces both to put aside their differences temporarily to attack the Yaga capital city. As many have had wives and female relatives kidnapped by the winged men, they agree to join forces. Cairn leads this combined army of 9,000 Gura warriors to the city of Ugg, where they enter through the Akka temple. They attack the Akka and Yaga people, rescuing as many female slaves as they can. In city walls, the confined areas give the Gura fighting men the advantage, as the Yaga cannot take to the air and use their traditional fighting tactics. Seeing her people defeated, Yasmeena unleashes what she describes as \\"the ultimate horror\\", a large creature described as resembling a gigantic slug with a fringe of tentacles all about its body that emit sparks and flashes of blue flame. Cairn defeats this creature and loses consciousness from wounds accrued in the battle. He wakes to learn that they have lost approximately 4,000 men in the battle but have saved 50,000 female slaves. All women are escorted back to their home cities by the Guras warriors. Cairn and Altha are now in a committed relationship and the cities of Koth and Khor are allies for the first time in history. Comic In 1980, Marvel Comic's magazine Epic Illustrated also published a comic book version of the story, a limited series in four parts written by Roy Thomas and drawn by Tim Conrad over issues #2-5. It was later reprinted in graphic album form by Dark Horse Comics in 1991, and a 4 issue sequel was done by Dark Horse Comics: Ironhand of Almuric. Authorship There is some question as to whether Robert E. Howard is the true author of Almuric. It was not published until after his death and some speculate that it was written by his editor, Otis Adelbert Kline, and published as Howard's.

Pak made her literary debut in 1955, with Gyesan (Í≥ÑÏÇ∞, Calculations). She is, however, most well known for her 16-volume story Toji (ÌÜ†ÏßÄ, The Land), an epic saga set on the turbulent history of Korea during 19th and 20th century.

Her birth name was Pak Geum-i (Î∞ïÍ∏àÏù¥). Her parents married when her mother was eighteen and her father, Pak Su-yeong (Î∞ïÏàòÏòÅ), fourteen. The relationship between her parents did not go well, which deeply affected her life. Her problems started when her father left her mother immediately after her birth. Later, she said that she had both sympathy and contempt toward her mother, but hatred against her father. Her response was to isolate herself in an imaginary world centered around her books. in 1946, one year after her graduation from (ÏßÑÏ£ºÍ≥†Îì±Ïó¨ÌïôÍµê), she married Kim Haeng-do (ÍπÄÌñâÎèÑ), a clerk of the Office of Monopoly (Ï†ÑÎß§Î∂Ä, now the Korea Tobacco & Ginseng Corporation). However, her problems did not end with her marriage. Her husband was accused of being a communist, then went missing during the Korean War and eventually died in Seodaemun Prison. She lost her 3 year-old baby son in the same year. As a widow, she provided the sole financial support for her daughter and mother. She began her career as a professional writer in 1955 after a recommendation by the novelist and poet, Kim Tong-ni (ÍπÄÎèôÎ¶¨). She underwent surgery for breast cancer in the 1960s and had to raise her grandson, Wonbo, after her son-in-law and poet, Kim Chi-ha (ÍπÄÏßÄÌïò) was arrested for allegedly being a communist in the 1970s. She later suffered from lung cancer. Work When she debuted, she said \\"If I had been happy, I would have not begun writing.\\" She also said later, \\"I live with my mother and daughter and had to support them financially by myself. I began writing since I had hope to get away from my adversity.\\" Her difficult personal life surely influenced her works, where she emphasized human dignity. She started her career as a writer with the novel, Calculations (Í≥ÑÏÇ∞, Gyesan) and her early work was heavily influenced by her personal circumstances. The narrators in her novels like Time of Distrust (Î∂àÏã†ÏãúÎåÄ, Bulsin Sidae) and Time of Darkness (ÏïîÌùëÏãúÎåÄ, Amheuk Sidae) are often women living with their mothers who lost a husband and son, reflecting her own life. In her later work, The Daughters of Pharmacist Kim (ÍπÄÏïΩÍµ≠Ïùò Îî∏Îì§, Kimyakgukui Ttaldeul), she emphasizes characters who overcome their difficulties. Later, her point of view became more objective in that her fictional setting moved from the Korean war period to everyday life; employing more varied styles and topics. Toji (The Land) Toji (The Land) is the most famous of her novels. This epic novel was started as a serial publication in the September 1969 issue of ' (ÌòÑÎåÄÎ¨∏Ìïô, Hyundae Munhak).Chung Ah- young: Life, Literature of Pak Kyongni - The Korea Times (05-05-2008) (Retrieved on July 10, 2008) It took her 25 years to write.Korea Times 05.07.2008 Its theme is the turbulence at the turn of the 20th century when the Korean people were struggling against Japanese imperialism and has hundreds of characters from across the Korean peninsula; following them from the late 19th century to the early 20th century through Japan‚Äôs colonial rule to the division of the peninsula. \\"Kim Gil-sang\\" (ÍπÄÍ∏∏ÏÉÅ) and \\"Choi Seo-hee\\" (ÏµúÏÑúÌù¨), the main protagonists of the novel, like those in her other novels, struggle to save their own dignity in the most turbulent period of Korean history.

There is a possibility that Tertulla would be related to the paternal side of Vespasian's family. Vespasian's paternal grandmother bore the cognomen Tertulla. Very little is known of Tertulla's family and her life. In 62, Tertulla married the future Emperor Titus, who was Vespasian's first son. This marriage could have been arranged by the fathers of Tertulla and Titus, to promote Titus‚Äô political and military career - and to provide financial relief from the debt incurred by Vespasian's proconsulship.

Blue has been called the last native speaker of the Catawba language. Personal life Samuel Blue was the son of Anglo-American Samuel Blue and his Catawba wife Margaret George Brown. His mother was one of the last native speakers of Catawba.Thomas J. Blummer, Catawba Indian Nation: Treasures in History (The History Press, 2007), p. 101 In July 1887 Blue married Minnie Hester George. She died in late 1896 or early 1897. After this Blue married Louisa Hester Jean Canty. Blue had three children by his first wife. Blue and his second wife Louisa had somewhere between nine and 20 children. Some have alleged that as many as 11 of these children were stillborn. Tribal Politics Blue first entered politics in 1905 when he was made a member of the interim governing council of the tribe along with Lewis Gordon and Ben T. Harris. They then supported the successful election of David Adam Harris as chief of the Catawba. In 1909 Blue was among those who signed the Catawba plea for United States citizenship. He also was a signer of the 1937 request for United States citizenship. Blummer points out this was at some level unneeded because Native American were granted citizenship by the United States in 1924. However, since South Carolina did not recognize their citizenship until 1944, people like Blue were functionally treated as non-citizens in the 1930s and reasonably could think to request citizenship. Blue was first elected chief of the Catawba in 1928. Blue made regular trips to Columbia, South Carolina where he would speak to the state legislature on behalf of the interests of the Catawba.Blummer, The Catawba Indian Nation, p. 101 In 1929 Blue began the process of trying to settle Catawba land claims, a process not completed until 1993. Blue was also a key figure in the process of the Catawba gaining federal recognition which was completed in 1941. He also was one of the main advocates of the Catawba accepting termination of federal wardship in at the time of his death.Blummer, The Catawba Nation, p. 102 He ended his service as chief in 1939 but remained a respected figure in the Tribe. He was again elected chief in 1956. Religious Beliefs On May 7, 1897, Blue had been baptized into The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in South Carolina.Deseret Morning News. 2008 Church Almanac of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. p266 Blue also served as branch president of the branch of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on the Catawba Reservation. In the early 20th century he would often help missionaries escape mobs.Tate, Lucille C., LeGrande Richards: Beloved Apostle (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1982) p. 169 In 1950 Blue traveled to Salt Lake City and gave a talk at General Conference on April 9.Encyclopedia of Latter-day Saint History, p. 1165 Also during this trip Blue and his wife Louisa were sealed in the Salt Lake Temple.\\"Catawba Indians Carry On Despite Loss of Chief Blue\\", Deseret News, Aug. 22, 1959 In 1952 Blue was a speaker at the dedication of the Catawba Branch Meetinghouse, a dedication performed by David O. McKay. Blue served as Branch President until his death in 1959, serving a total of 40 years as branch president. At the time of his death he had 119 grand children. Two of his great- grandchildren, Roger Trimmnal and Gloria Trimmnal, were then students at Brigham Young University. Cultural Promotion Blue was a major advocate of the continuation of Catawba culture. He was influenced by Tom Steven's promotion of stomp dances among the Catawba and worked hard to the Beat Dance and the Wild Goose Dance.Blummer, The Catawba Nation, p. 102 He also worked with Frank G. Speck to preserve a knowledge of the Catawba language. He was also a strong opponent of alcohol consumption by Catawba.Blummer, The Catawba Nation, p. 103 Shortly after his death the play Kah-who Catawba telling the story of the Catawba was produced with the narrator of the play cast as Blue.Blummer, The Catawba nation, p. 103 Notes Sources *Catawba Genealogy Category:Last known speakers of a language Category:1870s births Category:1959 deaths Category:Latter Day Saints from South Carolina Category:Catawba Category:Catawba people Category:Converts to Mormonism Category:Native American leaders Category:Year of birth uncertain ","title":"Samuel Taylor Blue"},{"id":"17379182","text":"The Pekin Street Historic District is a residential historic district bounded by Pekin and Candace Streets, Douglas and Chalkstone Avenues in Providence, Rhode Island.

Since the reunification of Germany in October 1990, all German citizens have been issued German passports.  Overview  According to a Washington Post report in 1989, only 25% of East Germans were passport holders. According to an East German passport law in 1957, East German citizens needed a visa to travel abroad, including West Germany and West Berlin. The penalty for making an unauthorized journey outside East Germany was imprisonment. Once they returned from their travels, the passports needed to be turned in.  Types of passports  There were at least four types of passports: alien, service, standard, and diplomatic. While standard passports were blue in color, alien and service passports were in different shades of green. Diplomatic passports were in red. Languages East German passports contained text in German, French, English, and Russian. English, however, was omitted from the passport after a revision in or around 1988. Passport note East German passports contained a note to the effect that: ::The Ministry of Foreign Affairs asks all authorities both inland and abroad to let the bearer of this passport travel freely and to grant him any protection and assistance that he might require. Versions issued in late 1989 forward to the country's demise in October 1990 omit the note.  Following reunification  Following reunification in October 1990, the Unification Treaty provided that East German passports would remain in force until, at the latest, 31 December 1995.

Background Griffin was born in Connersville, Indiana, and grew up with his family in Daytona Beach, Florida. He graduated from the University of Florida and later went to the University of Chicago. In 1946, he became the first archaeologist to be employed by the State of Florida. Five years later, he collaborated with Mark Boyd and Hale Smith to write Here They Once Stood, which is his best known work. From 1958 to 1971, Griffin was the Director of the St. Augustine Historical Society as well as the regional archaeologist for the National Park Service. He formed his own archaeological and historical consulting firm, Southeastern Frontiers Inc. in 1977. John Griffin died September 3, 1993, at the age of 73 from cancer.\\"John\\" Education Griffin attended Seabreeze High School in Daytona Beach, Florida. There, in his history class, his group was assigned a project on the French and Spanish conflict at the time of the first settlement in Florida. This topic would become a lifelong interest of Griffin's.Griffin 1996:15 He later went on to graduate from the University of Florida with an undergraduate degree in archaeology (at the time, no anthropology courses were offered at the school). Griffin spent a summer at the University of Denver, where he focused on southwestern archaeology and the direct historical approach.Griffin 1996: 15 He arrived at the University of Chicago in 1939 to pursue his master's degree. His master's thesis, finished in 1946, was entitled \\"The Upper Mississippi Occupation at the Fisher Site, Will County, Illinois.\\" First projects for Florida Park Services After being hired as state archaeologist by the Florida Park Service, Griffin recruited his friend from the University of Chicago, Hale Smith, to assist him in conducting a statewide survey of prehistoric and historical sites. On a Spanish map of 1605 the point of land that is now Tomoka State Park was clearly drawn and the location of the Timucuan Village of Nocoroco had been labeled. Together they tried to identify what the Timucuan material culture was as of 1605 using the direct historic method. Next, there was the excavation of Goodnow Mound which occurred in 1946. The main purpose of this dig was to gather information on a ‚Äúcontact period burial mound‚Äù because burial mound construction was thought to have apparently largely ceased in the eastern United States by the time of contact.Griffin 1996: 17 The excavations conducted by Hale Smith on the Scott Miller site provided Griffin with the first ‚Äúempirical information‚Äù about a Spanish mission site in Florida.Griffin 1996:19 A year later, Griffin worked on a test excavation at San Luis de Talimali, which was the seat of the deputy governor of the Province of Apalachee. In the summer of 1949, Griffin took a class entitled, \\"The Preservation and Interpretation of Historic Sites and Buildings\\" at American University. During this time, Congress instated the National Trust for Historic Preservation, which greatly motivated him to start planning a new system to understand the history of the state. Griffin also surveyed sites including the Bulow Sugar Mill, the Addison Blockhouse, the McHardy House and Mill, and Amelia Island. Work sites for National Park Services From 1958 to 1971, during his stay with the National Park Service, Griffin worked on many famous, historical sites such as: ‚Äúthe fence line at Appomattox, a ground-level study at Manassas, an outbuilding at Yorktown, the boyhood cabin site of Booker T. Washington, and the Cubo defense line at Castillo de San Marcos in St. Augustine‚Äù.Griffin 1996: 25 He also discovered Osceola's skeleton at Ft. Moultrie, South Carolina. But his largest field work projects were: Russell Cave, Alabama, Everglades National Park, and the ‚ÄúBig Dig‚Äù at Ocmulgee National Monument. Legacy Griffin is ‚Äúbest known for having made important contributions to the foundations and development of historical archaeology‚Äù.Oyuela-Caycedo 1998:1 In 1958, the American Anthropological Association held a symposium to look at the role of archaeology in historical research. Griffin's paper, ‚ÄúEnd Products of Historic Sites Archaeology‚Äù, made the argument that ‚Äúarchaeology was merely a body of methods and techniques for the recovery of information, and that the archaeologist often served as a technician in projects designed by persons from other disciplines‚Äù.Griffin 1996:24 This ‚Äúopen-minded and broadly anthropological perspective on the past shaped the nature of archaeological research in Florida‚Äù.Griffin 1996:xiii What he established in Florida when he was hired as the first professional archaeologist is still seen today in Florida archaeology. Also, there is The John W. Griffin Student Grant, which provides financial assistance to graduate students conducting research in Florida. This grant is offered annually by the Florida Archaeological Council.http://www.flarchcouncil.org/ Honors and awards In May 1992, Griffin received an honorary degree from the University of Florida ‚Äúfor sustained achievements of lasting significance and value‚Äù.Frey, Screen 1 In 1993 he received a posthumous Award of Merit from the Society for Historical Archaeology. Major works In 1951, he wrote Here They Once Stood with Mark Boyd and Hale Smith. The book is about the end of the Apalachee Missions in the early 18th Century and also includes their research. The Archaeology of Everglades National Park: A Synthesis was published by the State of Florida in 1989. Right before his death in 1993, Griffin was approached with the idea of compiling his works and putting them in a book. It is made up of sixteen papers and the first chapter is an essay on how he became a historical archaeologist. Fifty Years of Southern Archaeology: Selected Works of John W. Griffin was published in 1996, three years after his death. Patricia Griffin, wife of John, was the editor. John Griffin also wrote over 125 articles.

In this system, these large organizations are expected not only to seek profit but also to \\"advance the interests of the nation\\"; the government sets policies which favor these organizations. The policy is practiced by many governments, in some sectors more than others (such as defense), but by giving an unfair advantage against market competition, the policy promotes economic nationalism domestically and global pre-eminence abroad contrary to the free market. The policy also deters or prevents venture capitalism. As the policy is the collective form of inequality of opportunity, it is irreconcilable with the paradigm of the liberal economy advocated by 18th century economist Adam Smith. It was a key plank of the Dirigiste policy of 1945-1975 France. Definition Under a national champion policy, governments expect one domestic corporation or an oligopoly of such corporations, typically in strategic sectors (whether private or state-sponsored) to seek profit and to \\"advance the interests of the nation\\". The policy is practised or acquiesced to by every country in certain sectors (typically national defence and security and the printing of banknotes and often in the philanthropic, performing or subsidizing research and development of new technologies and through those National Institutes which produce marketable innovations). By allowing corporations a real or perceived monopoly due to the amalgamation of enterprises and the active or supportive suppression of domestic and foreign- based market competition, the policy over time operates as a form of economic nationalism as it is contrary to the free market and enhanced innovation. Academics often cite post-World War II Gaullist dirigisme in France as the pinnacle of the national champion policy. Other examples include the creation of the British Steel Corporation by the United Kingdom which acquired the country's largest 14 domestic steel companies in 1967. The prototypical British example was the establishment of Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) in 1926, formed from the merger of four companies with the support of the British government: in the 1960s this policy was pursued further in the UK, in order to concentrate capital and create firms which could make the large capital investments and establish the large scale production required to exploit economies of scale and scope, with other examples including the General Electric Company (GEC) and British Leyland. The policy was abandoned by the government of Margaret Thatcher at the end of the 1970s, shifting instead to a more laissez-faire strategy aimed at maximising foreign investment. By 2005 all of Britain's \\"national champions\\" had come under foreign ownership, with the exceptions of the aerospace (BAE Systems and Rolls-Royce Holdings) and pharmaceutical (GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca) sectors. The risk involved with such policies is exemplified by the unsuccessful challenges to IBM's period of dominance of the innovative computer market by UK's ICL, France's Bull, and Italy's Olivetti during the 1970s. Successful and rewarding challenges however are shown to be possible in recent years, as exemplified by European aircraft champion Airbus, and Chinese train champion CRRC. As the policy is a form of enforced inequality of opportunity, it is irreconcilable with the paradigm of the liberal economy advocated by 18th century economist Adam Smith, considered to be the intellectual father of modern capitalism.Eric Aaron, What's Right? (Dural, Australia: Rosenberg Publishing, 2003), 75. Russian renewal The policy is evident variously in the 21st century: Russia is its maximal exponent among the world's G-20. Other examples are the merger of E.ON with Ruhrgas backed by the German government in 2000 or the merger of GDF with Suez backed by the French government in 2008. Russian President Vladimir Putin has made \\"national champions\\" a central axis of his policy. The concept was introduced by Putin in his 1997 dissertation \\"Strategic Planning of the Reproduction of the Resource Bases\\". Putin, in turn, may have gotten the idea from a textbook by University of Pittsburgh analysts William King and David Cleland. Putin later expanded on the subject in an article published in 1999 in the Journal of the St. Petersburg Mining Institute. Charles de Gaulle had also advocated similar ideas when he was the president of France in the 1950s. =Vertical integration= In his dissertation, Putin wrote: \\"The process of restructuring the national economy must have the goal of creating the most effective and competitive companies on both the domestic and world markets.\\" Putin's 1999 article proposes that the state should closely regulate and develop the natural resources sector through creating companies with close links to the power vertical, making the firms big enough to compete with multinationals. These companies would become \\"national champions\\", representing the state's interest in international commerce. Most national champions are likely to be 50% or more owned by the Russian government, but there is no reason why predominantly private companies could not also serve as national champions, given the right guidance and pressure. =Advancing national interests= Instead of allowing the country's oligarch-controlled corporations to focus exclusively on making profit, Putin proposed that they should be used instead to advance the country's national interests, suggesting that Russia should reclaim some of the assets that were privatized during Yeltsin, and integrate them vertically into industrial conglomerates so they could compete better with Western multinational corporations. One example of the concept is that energy corporations such as Gazprom should keep the prices inside Russia low, as a form of subsidy for the public, and only strive for maximal profit in foreign countries.

Special effects designer Greg Cannom created the aliens for the low-budget film. The film released on September 26, 1980 and was released on home video for the first time on August 5, 2014 through Shout! Factory's Scream Factory label in a Blu- ray/DVD combo pack. The film is credited with being an inspiration for the 1987 film Predator, both of which star Kevin Peter Hall as a costumed hunter of alien origin. Plot A father and son go hunting in the mountains. Before they can begin hunting, which the son does not want to do anyway, they are killed by flying jellyfish-like creatures, which penetrate their skin with needle-tipped tentacles. Some time later, four teenagers, Tom, Greg, Beth and Sandy, hike in the same area, ignoring the warnings of local truck stop owner Joe Taylor (Jack Palance). A group of Cub Scouts is also in the area; their leader (Larry Storch) is also killed by the alien creatures, while his troop runs into an unidentified humanoid and flee. The teenagers set up camp at a lake, but after a few hours, Tom and Beth disappear. Sandy and Greg go looking for them and discover their bodies in an abandoned shack. They drive away in their van, while being attacked by one of the jellyfish which tries to get through the car's windshield. After they get rid of it, they arrive at the truck stop. Greg tries to get help from the locals, but they do not believe him, except for Fred 'Sarge' Dobbs (Martin Landau), who is a mentally ill veteran. Meanwhile, Sandy encounters the humanoid and flees into the woods, where Joe Taylor finds and returns her to Greg. While they discuss the situation, the sheriff arrives, but Sarge shoots him and begins to become more paranoid. Greg and Sandy leave with Taylor, who reveals he has been attacked by the humanoid before and secretly keeps the flying jellyfish as trophies. They search for the shack and once there, Taylor goes inside to only find the bodies of Tom, Beth and the cub scout leader. They discuss waiting for the creature when Taylor is attacked by another \\"jellyfish\\". The young people run once again, leaving him behind as ordered. They stop a police car and get into the back seat, but find Sarge driving. He abducts them, believing them to be aliens. Greg plays along, telling the deranged man that an invasion force is on the way, thus distracting him enough to toss him aside, run away with Sandy and jump from a bridge. They make it to a house where they find new clothing and try to relax. In the night, Sandy wakes up and goes looking for Greg, only to discover that he has been killed by the alien, who is still in the room. She flees to the basement and the creature is about to get her when Taylor arrives and saves her. On the way to the shack, he tells her about the creature: it is a tall extraterrestrial (Kevin Peter Hall) who hunts humans for sport to keep as trophies, using the living creatures as living weapons against its prey. They wait at the shack to ambush the hunter with dynamite when Sarge shows up, almost spoiling their plan. He and Taylor fight, and Sandy is about to hit Sarge from behind when the alien arrives and kills Sarge. Taylor then shoots the creature, with little to no effect. Realizing the last chance of success, he lures it to the shack, which is then blown up by Sandy. She alone survives the horrible night.  Cast  * Tarah Nutter as Sandy * Christopher S.

(On the same trip Jack L. Warner also bought the rights to The Amazing Dr Clitterhouse and George and Margaret.) =Development= In December 1937 Warners announced they would make Blondie White as Footsteps in the Dark. Frank Cavett was assigned to write the script and Joan Blondell and Claude Rains were mentioned as possible stars. John Huston and John Wexley were then reported as working on the script. In late 1938 Edward G. Robinson was announced as star and Anatole Litvak director. Lya Lys was to be the female star and in May 1939 it was announced the film would still go ahead. But it did not happen and by November Norman Reilly Raine was still working on the script. In July 1940 Lester Cole had taken over as writer and Robinson had to drop out due to a commitment to make The Sea Wolf. Cole says he was hired to rewrite Wexley's script, calling Wexley \\"a fine playwright and screenwriter\\" but the story \\"was hardly his style\\". Errol Flynn had just done seven period films in a row and was pestering Warner's for a change of pace so he was cast instead of Robinson. Once Flynn came on board, Olivia de Havilland was announced as his co star. She was replaced by Brenda Marshall. William Keighley was the original director announced. Louella Parsons wrote the film would be \\"a humorosly treated mystery yarn of The Thin Man variety\\". =Shooting= Filming started in October 1940. Ralph Bellamy said Flynn was \\"a darling. Couldn't or wouldn't take himself seriously. And he drank like there was no tomorrow. Had a bum ticker from the malaria he'd picked up in Australia. Also a spot of TB. Tried to enlist but flunked his medical, so he drank some more. Knew he wouldn't live into old age. He really had a ball in Footsteps in the Dark. He was so glad to be out of swashbucklers.\\" Reception =Box office= The film was one of Flynn's less successful movies at the box office around this time.Glancy, H. Mark. \\"Warner Bros film grosses, 1921‚Äì51.\\" Historical Journal of Film, Radio and Television. March 1995 =Critical= Bosley Crowther of The New York Times wrote: \\"A few spots are faintly amusing, thanks to Allen Jenkins as a chauffeur-valet and William Frawley as a thick-headed cop. But most of it is painfully dull and obvious, the pace is incredibly slow and Mr. Flynn, playing the detective, acts like a puzzled schoolboy.\\" Variety wrote that Flynn did \\"well enough\\" but called the script \\"routine, going in for too much dialog and too many absurdities.\\" Los Angeles Times wrote that \\"Errol Flynn becomes a modern for a change in a whodunit film and the excursion proves eminently worth-while... an exceptionally clever and amusing exhibit ‚Äì a little lagging now and then in the action but nothing to bother about in that regard\\". Film Daily reported: \\"Basis for a first-rate mystery meller with plenty of laughs is contained in the plot for this yarn, but the development of the script falls short of the story possibilities. The screenplay lacks any real punch drama and it does not have any hilariously amusing comedy, and it is also slightly incredible at times. On the whole, this picture is moderately entertaining screenfare for the average audience.\\" Harrison's Reports called the film \\"fairly good\\", though the killer's identity was \\"pretty obvious.\\" The Wall Street Journal called it \\"an amusing if not too subtle mystery.\\" John Mosher of The New Yorker wrote that while the burlesque performer added a \\"bright note\\", the film was otherwise a \\"commonplace mystery picture.\\" Filmink magazine argued Flynn was \\"not entirely comfortable as a comic actor but it's a very endearing performance, and he has that charisma and charm to compensate for his lack of technique. Unfortunately, the film doesn‚Äôt do its star justice.\\" =Proposed sequel= John Wexley and Lester Cole were reported as working on a sequel, Ghosts Don't Leave Footprints. This was to reteam Marshall and Flynn and revolve around spiritualists. However no sequel resulted. =Other versions= The BBC made a TV adaptation of Blondie White called The Strange Case of Blondie White in 1947.

In massive multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs), cooperation between players to accomplish difficult tasks is often an integral mechanic of gameplay, and organized groups of players, often called guilds, clans, or factions, emerge. Sometimes the relationships players from within the game spill over into friendships or romantic relationships in the material world. In other instances, romantic partners and groups of material world friends find that playing together strengthens their bonds. Avatars and communication MMORPG players take on an avatar, a humanoid graphical representation of themselves, in the game. Players usually have great latitude in designing the physical appearance, gender, and race of their avatar. Players also select their role, profession or class, each of which comes with its own set of strengths and weaknesses. Games scholar Nick Yee classifies avatars into two categories, a projection or idealization of one‚Äôs identity or an experiment with a new identity. The avatar, as a representation of the self, creates the first impression and is the first means of communicating with other players. Communication between players typically takes the form of typed chat and the animated gestures and expressions of the avatar. Collaboration and social networking A study by Nicholas Yee, titled The Psychology of Massively Multi-User Online Role-Playing Games: Motivations, Emotional Investment, Relationships and Problematic Usage, found that combat- oriented collaborations can become very complex. Typical battle scenarios involve groups of four to eight users facing sophisticated artificial intelligence. Strategies decided upon via communication via typed conversations, and individual actions, based upon their individual personalities, may risk others in the group. Unlike many real world situations, MMORPG users can choose team members and find like-minded others. While some individuals may be outcasts in the real world, they can become whomever they want in these virtual worlds, and can find other players with similar interests and personalities. In one survey, 39.4% of males and 53.3% of females felt that their MMORPG companions were comparable to or even better than their real world friends. PBS Frontline's documentary, Growing Up Online, found that humans seek not only mental and emotional connections, but also physical presence. For some, MMORPGs can provide valuable lessons that then can be applied to the outside world. However, reliance on the internet, or possible internet addiction may also lead to \\"physical\\" social isolation. Virtual relationships in MMORPGs In a study performed by Nick Yee, 39.4% of male respondents and 53.3% of female respondents rated their MMORPG friends as comparable or better than their material world friends. There are a number of theories about why strong relationships form in virtual worlds. The players in these environments are likely to already have much in common. For example, in one study 36% of respondents work in the IT industry and 68% of respondents have experience with table-top role-playing games. In addition to sharing professional and entertainment interests, players are also likely to share common personality traits associated with these fields. The high-stress crisis scenarios that groups encounter in combat-oriented play, paired with player‚Äôs emotional investment in the environment, may build trust among the players. MMORPG‚Äôs also rely on fantastic metaphors and cultural myths, including ideas of chivalric romance, that encourage idealization of persons and relationships. The restricted nature of the communication between players may allow a sender to carefully craft their self-presentation and the receiver may inflate the relatively few pieces of communication into an idealized picture of the sender. Because avatars are capable of only a subset of human gestures and expressions miscommunication or slippages in coordination (i.e. communication that is overlapping, missed, or late) do occur. Although perceptions of these virtual interactions are often inaccurate, the lack of cues and increased control over how a player presents themselves sometimes facilitate romantic relationships. In-game marriage ceremonies are one way that players express affection for one another. An in-game marriage may also represent a strategic alliance or other storytelling mechanism. However, some relationships initiated in the game environment carry over to the material world. According to Nicholas Yee, 15.7% of male MMORPG players and 5.1% of female MMORPG players physically dated someone they met in an MMORPG. Anonymity In MMORPGs, players can choose what type of character they want to play and design their appearance. One potential positive side effect of that is difficulty in stereotyping, as all players have equal ability to design themselves, regardless of their initial appearance. There is also the potential for \\"identity tourism\\". The choice to enact oneself as a light- skinned male elf, say, could allow a black female player to appropriately role-play her character in the desired fashion without being rejected by the community. Anonymity may encourage deviance from the game's objectives and the group's decisions, as most MMORPG players feel safe from repercussions in the material world. Many players of both genders find themselves gender-switching while creating an online avatar. This allows for more freedom of expression in ways that real life cannot incorporate. Despite the gender of the player, studies show that players tend to adhere to the gender roles of their avatar's gender and even purposefully choose to be that gender because of how it changes the way they are treated. Some players express that they gender-switch because they get to experiment with looks and behaviors they would not get to in real life. Gender-switching on the internet is not a new phenomenon and has been occurring since the early days of online interaction. Even still, players often claim that gender-switching, despite imposed or purposeful gender-role- fulfillment, has helped to change their outlook on gameplay.  Dangers  MMORPGs function as communication platforms not unlike established social media like Facebook. As such, the CIA expressed great worries about the use of MMORPGs as a secret communications channel for terrorists. On February 15, 2008, the office of the Director of National Intelligence provided Congress with the Data Mining Report. In this report the existence of the so-called Reynard Project was disclosed. The aim of the Reynard Project is described as follows: > \\"Reynard is a seedling effort to study the emerging phenomenon of social > (particular terrorist) dynamics in virtual worlds and large-scale online > games and their implications for the Intelligence Community. The cultural > and behavioral norms of virtual worlds and gaming are generally unstudied. > Therefore, Reynard will seek to identify the emerging social, behavioral and > cultural norms in virtual worlds and gaming environments. The project would > then apply the lessons learned to determine the feasibility of automatically > detecting suspicious behavior and actions in the virtual World. If it shows > early promise, this small seedling effort may increase its scope to a full > project.\\"  See also  *Identity tourism References and notes Bibliography * *The Daedalus Gateway ‚Äì The Psychology of MMORPGs: Player Demographics.

A prominent landmark in the Providence downtown, it occupies an entire city block, and housed Shepard's, one of New England's largest department stores, for many decades. History The building grew in stages, starting as a modest three- story Italianate structure at the corner of Clemence and Washington in 1880. Beginning in 1896 the company embarked on a rapid expansion, designed by Martin & Hall, which was largely completed by 1903. By 1909, the store boasted of having a restaurant which could serve 4100, a laundry, a refrigerating and ice-making plant, a fur storage room, and a complete printing plant. The building was struck by fire in March 1923, causing over one million dollars worth of damage, but rebuilt under Hall's supervision. The department store was hurt by the development of suburbs and shopping malls in the 1960s. In 1973 the store went bankrupt and was purchased by the Eastern Dry Goods Company. A spokesperson for Eastern Dry Goods told The New York Times in September 1973 that the store \\"will probably have to be liquidated because of their many problems.\\" The store closed for good in 1974. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. During the next few years the building was leased to various tenants, and was vacant in the early 1990s. In 1993, it was announced that the landmark building was purchased by the Rhode Island Port Authority for \\"nearly $2.3 million.\\" The announced plan was to open a history museum on the first two floors, to be operated by the Rhode Island Heritage Center. The remainder of the building would be used as office space for up to 500 state workers, including the state Environmental Management Department, the Council on the Arts, and the Library Services department.

He supported the democratic wing of the krajowcy movement. Wr√≥blewski sponsored a large library in Vilnius (the Biblioteka Wr√≥blewskich).  Biography  Tadeusz Wr√≥blewski was born to a family of a famous homeopathic doctor. His uncle Walery Antoni Wr√≥blewski was one of the January Uprising leaders in Lithuania and later General of Paris Commune. After graduating from a Gymnasium in Vilnius, Wr√≥blewski did not have a chance to get a doctor's diploma because he was expelled from Saint Petersburg surgical-medical academy and later from Warsaw University for participation in revolutionary organizations. In 1884 he was exiled to Siberia for such revolutionary activities. Few years after he was released from exile in Tobolsk Governorate, Wr√≥blewski took equivalence examination and graduated from St. Petersburg University with a master's in law. For some time he was working as an assistant to a lawyer in Saint Petersburg. After his father's death in 1891 he came back to Vilnius. His father left him a library, which Wr√≥blewski further expanded using most of his inherited wealth and a great part of his income as a lawyer. His main interest was Lithuanian history and especially Vilnius history. The library had a large collection of valuable manuscripts, maps, documents, plans, photographs, postcards, linotypes and various museum artifacts. In 1907 he acquired Plater family collection, including a large art collection. Wr√≥blewski succeeded in acquiring an extensive collection of Lithuanian Free masons lodge. Major portions of this collection were acquired from Henryk Tartura from Minsk, Russian writer Ivan Yelagin (1725‚Äì1794), and Emilja Federowicz, widow of Wac≈Çaw Fedorowicz. The collection also included items from collections of Micha≈Ç Dulski, Dominyk Moniuszko, Vilnius University professor Johan Wolfgang Bartolomius Bieniowski. The collection had a complete set of all Grand Duchy of Lithuania masonry loges signs (including all of the 7 level GDL signs), seals, medals, and the \\"Gorliwy Litwin\\" (Diligent Lithuanian) loge regulations project manuscript and ritual cup. In 1899 Wr√≥blewski founded and led \\"Neoszubrawcy\\" para-masonic organization (discontinued in 1914). Wr√≥blewski was known as a lawyer who would take unpopular cases. He defended 1905‚Äì1907 revolution activists. During the trials he was defending about 400 people, including his best-known case of Pyotr Schmidt, that gained him Empire-wide recognition. He was consistent in his belief, that no ethnic group is superior over others, and demanded autonomy for minorities. Being consistent in his democratic beliefs Wr√≥blewski was a strong supporter of Lithuanian, Belarusian, Ukrainian and Polish territories sovereignty in the first and the third Russian Duma. After Vilnius Region became part of Poland after World War I, Wr√≥blewski defended Lithuanian activists without charge, the most-known case being Mykolas Bir≈æi≈°ka. In 1922 Wr√≥blewski unanimously was elected as an honorary member of the Lithuanian Science Society, and held lectures in the society organized events about the Vilnius and Lithuania history. Tadeusz Wr√≥blewski was buried at Rasos cemetery.  Library  Library of the Lithuanian Academy of Sciences Since 1912 Wr√≥blewski pursued a goal to establish a public library in Vilnius. To that end he established Eustachy and Emilia Wr√≥blewska library society, later transformed into Wroblewski's scientific aid society. In 1925, just before his death, Wr√≥blewski donated his collection to the city under strict conditions that the collection should be never split and under no circumstances would leave the city. Wr√≥blewski died before formal donation procedures were finished. In 1926 the library, then under the custody of the Polish government, was renamed to the National Library of Eustachy and Emilia Wr√≥blewska in Wilno (Pa≈Ñstwowa Biblioteka im. Eustachego i Emilii Wr√≥blewskich w Wilnie). By 1939 the library was expanded with a scientific institute and a museum, and had about 200,000 items, including paintings, icons, maps and coins. Following the Soviet invasion of Poland the most valuable part of the collection was robbed in September 1939, and together with most of Vilnius city archives was transferred to Minsk. Among the most valuable lost items was a full collection of Lithuanian Free masonry loge signs and manuscripts collection (86 volumes), Grand Duchy of Lithuania collection (678 volumes), Lithunistics volumes regarding Vilnius region (435 volumes) and Lithuanian state (72 volumes), and other valuable books (72 volumes). The library was taken over by the Lithuanians in October 1939. Nowadays the remaining part of Wr√≥blewski's collection is preserved as a valuable part of Lithuanian Academy of Sciences library (Lietuvos moksl≈≥ akademijos biblioteka), residing in Vilnius. The library made the Wr√≥blewski family its patron in 2010.

Notable Swedish communities exist in the United States, Argentina, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom as well as others. History The New Sweden Company established a colony on the Delaware River in 1638, naming it New Sweden. The colony was lost to the Dutch in 1655. Between 1846 and 1930, roughly 1.3 million people, about 20% of the Swedish population, left the country. In the United States members of the diaspora had access to Swedish films starting in 1922 with The Treasure of Arne which was shown in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Some films were made just for the Swedish American diaspora community such as The Film About Sweden and The Old Land of Dreams. The first recognition by Sweden of the 19th century emigration to the United States occurred in 1923 with a visit by Nathan S√∂derblom and the 1926 visit by the crown prince, who would later rule as Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden. He would visit again in 1938.

The characteristic of this minority is debated: while some see it as an ethnic group of its own\\"...Finland has a Swedish- speaking minority that meets the four major criteria of ethnicity, i.e. self- identification of ethnicity, language, social structure and ancestry (Allardt and Starck, 1981; Bhopal, 1997). some view it purely as a linguistic minority....As language is actually the basic or even the only criterion that distinguishes these two groups from each other, it is more correct to speak of Finnish-speakers and Swedish-speakers in Finland instead of Finns and Finland Swedes. Nowadays the most common English term denoting the latter group is 'the Swedish-speaking Finns'. The group includes about 265,000 people, comprising 5.10% of the population of mainland Finland, or 5.50% if the 26,000 inhabitants of √Öland are included (there are also about 60,000 Swedish- speaking Finns currently resident in Sweden). It has been presented that the ethnic group can also be perceived as a distinct Swedish-speaking nationality in Finland.The identity of the Swedish[-speaking] minority [in Finland] is however clearly Finnish (Allardt 1997:110). But their identity is twofold: They are both Finland Swedes and Finns (Ivars 1987). (Die Identit√§t der schwedischen Minderheit ist jedoch eindeutig finnisch (Allardt 1997:110).

For instance, the Swedes of Finland, with their distinctive language and culture form a nationality which under the Finnish constitution shall enjoy equal rights with the Finnish nationality\\". \\"In Finland this question (Swedish nationality) has been subjected to much discussion. The Finnish majority tries to deny the existence of a Swedish nationality. An example of this is the fact that the statutes always use the concept \\"'Swedish-speaking' instead of 'Swedish'\\". Tore Modeen, The cultural rights of the Swedish ethnic group in Finland (Europa Ethnica, 3-4 1999, jg.56) =Estonia= The presence of Swedish-speaking permanent residents in what is now Estonia (Estonian Swedes) was first documented in the 14th century, and possibly dates back to the Viking Age. There were an estimated 12,000 Swedes resident in Estonia in 1563, mainly distributed along the coastal regions and islands. Estonia was under Swedish rule 1558‚Äì1710, after which the territory was ceded to Russia in the 1721 Treaty of Nystad. In 1781, 1,300 Estonian Swedes of the island of Hiiumaa (Dag√∂) were forced to move to New Russia (today Ukraine) by Catherine II of Russia, where they formed Gammalsvenskby (Old Swedish Village). According to the 1934 census, there were 7,641 Estonian Swedes (Swedish speaking, 0.7% of the population in Estonia), making Swedes the third largest national minority in Estonia, after Russians and Germans. During World War II, almost the entire community of Estonian Swedes fled to Sweden. Today there are, at most, a few hundred Estonian Swedes living in Estonia and a few hundred in Russia and Ukraine, with the estimates varying widely depending on who identifies, or can be identified, as a Swede. Many of them are living in northwestern mainland Estonia and on adjacent islands and on the island of Ruhnu (Run√∂) in the Gulf of Riga. In a nationalist context, the ethnic Swedes living outside Sweden are sometimes called 'East-Swedes' (in Swedish: √∂stsvenskar), to distinguish them from the ethnic Swedes living in Sweden proper, called rikssvenskar. =France= Many Swedes spend their holidays in France especially in the South of France, small towns and villages. altogether totaling 20,000 to 25,000 Swedes in the Gallic country. =North America= There are numerous Swedish descendants in places like the United States and Canada (i.e. Swedish Americans and Swedish Canadians), including some who still speak Swedish. The majority of the early Swedish immigrants to Canada came via the United States. It wasn't until after 1880 that significant numbers of Swedes immigrated to Canada. From WWI onwards, almost all of the Swedish immigrants entered Canada coming directly from Sweden. In addition to Swedish immigrants from south- central part of Sweden, a relatively large number of Swedish immigrants came from Stockholm and northern Sweden. The newcomers played an important role in the development of the Canadian prairies. Swedish Canadians can be found in all parts of the country. Many Swedish social, cultural, political, business and welfare organizations, both religious and secular, can be found in all major Canadian cities and some of the smaller towns and rural communities. Some of the Swedish traditions, such as Midsummer, Walpurgis, and St Lucia are still celebrated by the community today. =Latin America= Swedes settled mainly in Argentina,http://www.nordicway.com/argentina.htm Brazil, Costa Rica and Chile. Numerous communities can be found in these countries, especially in Misiones Province and Buenos Aires, in Argentina, in the South and Southeast of Brazil, and there are some Swedish communities in southern Chile. =Oceania= Many Swedes settled in Australia and New Zealand. Organized immigration from Sweden occurred during the 19th century when Queensland and Tasmania invited immigrants to take up farming leases. Many people of Swedish descent can be found in these countries. =Russia= Swedish soldiers taken prisoner during the Great Northern War were sent in considerable numbers to Siberia. They numbered perhaps 25% of the population of Tobolsk, the capital of Siberia, and some settled permanently. There are also Swedes located in St Petersburg, in Ural and in Siberia. =United Kingdom= Scandinavian migration to Britain is a phenomenon that has occurred at different periods over the past 1,200 years. =Norway= Swedes in Norway are Norwegian citizens of Swedish descent or Swedish immigrants are the fourth largest immigrant group in Norway. As of 1 January 2019, there were 38,770 Swedish- born persons who were registered in Norway as well as Norwegian citizens of Swedish ancestry. Unlike many other immigration to Norway, such as immigration from Poland, for example, there is also a large emigration to Sweden from Norway (both of Swedish-born people who move back again, and of Norwegian-born people who have ancestors Sweden), so that the migration flow can fluctuate. favor of both countries. Migration between Norway and Sweden is very sensitive to the economic cycle and depends on the labor market in both countries. There are relatively few Swedish immigrants to Norway who take Norwegian citizenship. This may be due to the fact that many Swedes in Norway imagine that the stay will last quite a short time, for example during temporary seasonal migration. But it may also be due to the fact that Nordic citizens have such great rights in Norway that the need for citizenship change is not present. Many of the Swedish immigrants are young, and stay in Norway for a relatively short time. Few of the Swedish immigrants are second-generation immigrants; this may be due to the fact that Swedish immigrants in most cases are married to and have children with Norwegians, so that these children are not considered immigrants; or that they move to a much greater extent back to Sweden when they establish themselves. Most Swedes in Norway live in √òstfold, Akershus (in Viken), Oslo and Vestfold (in Vestfold and Telemark). This is probably due to the fact that the border areas always have the largest neighboring immigration, and that this is the most densely populated part of the border areas. Historically, most Swedes have worked in agriculture, forestry and industry. Today, there is a large proportion of young Swedes in service industries, but also many in the construction industry. It can be documented that Swedes from the 18th century to the early 20th century came to Norway both in seasonal work and as more permanent settlers. The Swedes have worked as trench diggers (especially in √òstfold), as construction workers (rallars) and as other types of specialists. The Swedes stand out among other migrant groups in that throughout most of Norway's history they have been so numerous that it has been possible to find them in all walks of life and professions. In 1865, immigrants from Sweden were by far the largest group of foreign-born in Norway, with 15,784 people out of a total of 21,247 (74%).

History The arsenal was designed in 1839 by Russell WarrenProvidence Journal (March 15, 1839) and built by Tallman & Bucklin, all of Providence. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1970. In the 19th century the arsenal was used as the armory of the Providence Marine Corps of Artillery (PMCA) and associated artillery units in the Rhode Island Militia and was used as the mobilization site for 10 batteries of light artillery which were raised in Rhode Island during the American Civil War. In addition to the PMCA the arsenal was used by a number of organizations including the Grand Army of the Republic, Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War and United Spanish War Veterans. In April 1920, the Rhode Island General Assembly earmarked $3,800 for the purpose of repairing the arsenal. On May 17, 1924, the Ku Klux Klan held an illegal meeting at the arsenal which attracted about 200 men. Governor William S. Flynn denounced the KKK and forbade the group from meeting on state property. In the 1980s the arsenal was in use by the Rhode Island National Guard's Education, Historical and Equal Opportunity offices. As of 2008 the arsenal was in use as the location for the annual presentation of the Order of St. Barbara to soldiers of the 103d Field Artillery Regiment of the Rhode Island National Guard. It also serves as the headquarters of the PMCA (the de facto 103d Field Artillery veterans association) and houses a diverse collection of military artifacts.

Cariboo Helicopter Skiing Ltd. (1993), 74 B.C.L.R. (2d) 224, at page 225  Biography  Scurfield was a Canadian businessman who founded one of North America‚Äôs largest home building companies, Nu-West Group Limited.Susan Goldenberg, Men Of Property: The Canadian Developers Who Are Buying America (Toronto: Personal Publishers, 1981) Chapter 4. In 1957, Scurfield took control of Nu-West Homes, a small, privately owned, house- building company operating in Calgary, Alberta. In 1969, Nu-West Homes Ltd. became a publicly traded company and was listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange. By 1981 Nu-West Group Ltd. had become the largest house-building company in Canada, with diversified asset holdings of $1.9 billion, and over 3,700 employees. He was also one of the founding ownersMonica Zurowski, The Fire Inside: Celebrating 25 Years of Calgary Flames Spirit And Hockey (CanWest Books, 2006), page 44. of the National Hockey League's Calgary Flames. Scurfield was actively involved in the establishment of the Faculty of Management at the University of Calgary. The faculty‚Äôs building, Scurfield Hall, is named in his honour. Scurfield's family also owned Sunshine Village ski resort located in Banff National Park, and a share of the Calgary Flames Hockey Club.  Early years  Scurfield was born in Broadview, Saskatchewan, on January 7, 1928, the son of Ralph and Ann Scurfield (n√©e Parsons).Calgary Herald, February 21, 1985, Obituary, page D8 His family soon moved to the small farming community of Ninga, Manitoba where his father was the station master on the Canadian Pacific Railway line. Ralph was active in sports and enjoyed playing hockey and soccer as a child. Few who knew him from his rural childhood days could have imagined that the bright boy with reddish hair, who walked to the one-room school house with his pet crow on his shoulder, would grow up to become one of the most successful and influential Canadian businessmen of his generation. Scurfield attended the University of Manitoba, working his way through school by taking summer carpentry jobs in the northern town of Churchill, Manitoba. After receiving his Bachelor of Science degree in 1948, Scurfield became an elementary school teacher. He taught in Manitoba for only two years, before leaving a promising teaching career to pursue his chosen trade of carpentry. In 1951, lured by the booming Alberta economy, he moved to Edmonton, where he quickly found employment with McConnell Homes as a crew foreman. Scurfield was soon settled in Alberta, and in July 1954 he married Sonia Onishenko, the youngest child of Ukrainian‚ÄìRussian immigrant parents. Scurfield‚Äôs employer, Ches McConnell, impressed with Scurfield‚Äôs work ethic and university degree, asked him to move 160 miles south to Calgary to manage the small, financially struggling, house building company called Nu- West Homes. Scurfield agreed, but only on the condition that he be allowed to buy in as a 1/3 partner. Career success After mortgaging his house to finance his partnership, in 1957, at the age of 29, Scurfield became president of Nu-West Homes, a Calgary-based company building approximately 40 homes a year. When he moved to Calgary in May 1957, he found that Nu-West was in worse financial shape than he had been led to believe. With only a secretary and a bobcat driver as employees, Scurfield went to work salvaging the reputation of the near bankrupt Nu-West Homes by fixing previously built houses free of charge. By putting in long hours he was able to establish Nu-West Homes as a company of strong customer service. Nu-West quickly became known for quality housing and after-sales service. Under Scurfield‚Äôs direction, Nu-West Homes flourished, and Scurfield‚Äôs personal stature grew. In 1969 Nu-West went public, raising 2.9 million in its initial share offering. The money raised was used to purchase land in and around the City of Edmonton enabling Nu-West to enter the Edmonton house building market. The Alberta cities of Edmonton and Calgary were both growing very fast due to the continuing oil boom. Now positioned as the province‚Äôs largest house builder, Nu-West provided the homes demanded by the quickly growing population. Nu-West continued to expand and was soon building homes and buildings across Canada and in parts of the United States. As a result of Nu-West's success, Scurfield became very wealthy and respected. His advice was sought out by city planners, business, and political leaders. He sat as a director with numerous corporations including Carma Ltd., The Mortgage Insurance Company of Canada, MICC Investments Ltd., and Sunshine Village Corporation. He was a part owner of the Calgary Flames Hockey Club, a member of the Faculty of Management Advisory Board of the University of Calgary, a member of the Board of Governors of the Banff Centre for Continuing Education, and he served a term as President of the Housing and Urban Development Association of Canada. He travelled extensively, for both business and pleasure, and was an avid sportsman who enjoyed ice hockey, football, skiing, fishing and golf. In 1969, three years before President Richard Nixon's historic visit, Scurfield (then President of the National House Builder‚Äôs Association), was invited to visit the People's Republic of China as part of an official business delegation. In 1981, as a personal guest of former U.S. President Gerald Ford, Ralph and his wife were in attendance to witness the first launching of the NASA Space Shuttle. Scurfield Hall at the University of Calgary Scurfield was one of the founding members of Carma Ltd., a cooperative of independent builders who banded together to form a land development company to provide serviced lots to Calgary homebuilders. In 1963 he became President of the Calgary House Builder's Association, and in 1969 became the President of the National House Builder's Association of Canada. Using his influence, Scurfield established national house building standards, and introduced the \\"New Home Builder's Warranty Program\\" which continues to this day. He convinced his contemporary house building competitors that long term quality of life was more important than short-term profit. Always defying the stereotype, Scurfield demonstrated that a land developer could also be an environmentalist. The lands which are now Nose Hill Park were once privately owned and zoned for residential development. The largest landowners were Nu- West and Carma. Recognizing that the natural beauty of the undisturbed Nose Hill added a distinctive and desirable quality of life to Calgary, in the mid-1970s, Ralph orchestrated a land swap between Nu-West, Carma Developers and the City of Calgary, such that the City gained ownership of the future Park Lands. Over the next decade, the City acquired the remaining parcels of private holdings, and the resulting protected lands are now Nose Hill Park, the largest city-owned natural park in North America, and part of Ralph‚Äôs lasting legacy to the City of Calgary and its citizens. By the end of the 1970s, Nu-West had become a diversified company, and so did Scurfield‚Äôs personal holdings. In 1980 the Scurfield Family bought Sunshine Village, a ski resort located in the Banff National Park. In 1981, Ralph Scurfield made a $4 million private donation to the University of Calgary, with a matching donation by Nu-West Group Ltd., to begin construction of a new faculty of management building. The building, named Scurfield Hall, opened on January 1, 1986. Ralph T. Scurfield was also one of six Calgary businessmen who purchased the NHL's Atlanta Flames, which were then moved to Calgary for the 1980‚Äì81 season. The other original investors are Harley Hotchkiss, Daryl Seaman, Byron Seaman, Norman Green, and Normie Kwong. When the Calgary Flames won the NHL Championship in 1989, Ralph's widow, Sonia Scurfield, became only the second woman (the first Canadian woman) to have her name engraved on the Stanley Cup. Things began to get tough in the early 1980s when the federal government brought in the National Energy Program, which didn't allow Albertans to sell oil to other Canadians at world prices. People left Alberta in droves and almost no one bought homes, with existing owners walking away from mortgages. Real estate prices plummeted and the industry collapsed.http://www.carma.ca/us/NewsEvents/Roller%20coaster.aspx Nu-West, which was heavily leveraged with debt, lost its place of dominance in the house building industry. Death On February 18, 1985, Scurfield and another person died in an avalanche while heli-skiing in the Monashee Mountains near Blue River, British Columbia. The resulting court decision, (Scurfield v. Cariboo Helicopter Skiing Ltd. (1993), 74 B.C.L.R. (2d) 224) on the doctrine of contributory negligence in Canadian law, resulted in a finding that Scurfield was 75% responsible for the incident. An appeal relieved the guide of all legal responsibility.  Honours  The Ralph T.

It is bounded on the east by Summit Avenue, the south by Rochambeau Avenue, the west by Camp Street, and the north by Memorial Road and Creston Way. It contains 155 houses, most of which were built between 1918 and 1938. The area was annexed by Providence in 1874 and platted out of farmland in 1916, and represents a typical suburban development of the period. Most of these houses are set on lots between 4,500 and 5,500 square feet in size, although there are some double lots. Single family homes predominate, with a number of two- and three-family houses present.

Sanky≈´ built a single train line which serviced the cities of Sakurai, Nabari, Matsusaka, and Ujiyamada, and the company acquired a second major line as well as a small local line from Ise Electric Railway (Iseden).

History The congregation was founded in 1849 when an Orthodox group known as the \\"Sons of Israel\\" gathered for daily services in Providence. In 1877, the congregation affiliated itself with the Union of American Hebrew Congregations (later named the Union for Reform Judaism), the national Reform Judaism denomination. While Newport, Rhode Island had a well-established Sephardi Jewish community since the 17th century, few Sephardi Jews lived in Providence. The Jews of Providence who founded Temple Beth-El were predominantly Ashkenazi Jews from German-speaking areas. The majority of the early congregants at Temple Beth-El were immigrants from Germany, the Netherlands, Hungary, and Poland.http://www.temple-beth-el.org/about-us/our- history The building was built in 1910-1911 and was the home of Sons of Israel until 1954. After 1954, the building served the Shaare Zedek congregation. In 2006, Shaare Zedek merged with Beth Shalom, and the Broad Street building was left vacant. Due in part to the housing crash of 2008, Beth Shalom was unable to sell the building, and it became neglected and vandalized. In 2014, a developer purchased the building and the nonprofit Friends of Broad Street Synagogue was organized to turn the building into a community center. The Building The current building, a Classical Revival brick structure, was designed by Banning & Thornton and built in 1910‚Äì11. Architect Ira Rakatansky designed renovations to the building in 1955. An iron fence was added to separate the synagogue from Broad Street in 1984.

The novel, addressing issues of a mixed heritage child, was considered \\"before its time\\" and went out of print until Harryette Mullen rediscovered the novel and brought it out of obscurity.Harryette Mullen, l \\"Apple Pie with Oreo Crust\\", JSTOR, 2002 The book has since acquired cult classic status.Paul Beatty, \\"Black Humor\\", The New York Times, 22 January 2006. Plot summary Born into a taboo relationship that neither of her grandparents supported, having a Jewish father and black mother who divorce before she is two, Oreo grows up in Philadelphia with her maternal grandparents while her mother tours with a theatrical troupe. Soon after puberty, Oreo heads for New York with a pack on her back to search for her father; but in the big city she discovers that there are dozens of Sam Schwartzes (her father's name) in the phone book, and Oreo's mission turns into a wickedly humorous picaresque quest. The ambitious and playful narrative challenges accepted notions of race, ethnicity, culture, and even the novelistic form itself; its quest theme is inspired by that of the Greek tale of Theseus. Ross uses the structure of the Theseus myth to both trap Oreo and allow her to reinvent it. Oreo's white father, who abandoned her, forces her to live out this inherently white, male narrative. However, the trope of lost patriarchy is essential in black cultures so Oreo can reappropriate the myth and make it entirely non-foreign. Furthermore, Oreo reinvents the archaic myth by living a black narrative through it, suggesting that blacks can reappropriate themes from the white culture they are forced to live in. The search for paternity within the Theseus myth is essentially futile since Oreo gains nothing from finding her father, which undermines the importance placed on the search for paternity. In the end, Oreo witnesses her own father's death as he falls from a window. She confronts another girl on the street in front of her father's dead body, presumably another one of his daughters. Genre Oreo is a picaresque novel, that revolves around our picaroon, Oreo. It is a fictional tale about the adventures and conflicts she faces on her search for her father. It falls under the category of Post Soul Aesthetic, modern works that expands upon the possibilities of the Black experience, and arguably New Black Aesthetic, works that describes the black experience from the perspective of the culturally-hybrid, second generation middle class. The comedic style of the novel helps to subvert the trope of the \\"tragic mulatto\\" and position Oreo as a \\"thriving hybrid.\\" Structure The novel is told from the perspective of an omniscient, third-person. The novel strays from traditional narrative form. The novel exemplifies the essence of postmodernism, fragmentation through its structure.The chapters are broken into subsections. The novel uses diagram, equations, menus, tests, ads, letters, other sources to break and supplement the narrative. Ross employs different narrative structures throughout the course of the novel. Mainly, the episodic nature of the book is similar to the picaresque story structure. The charisma and wits of Christine, especially in contrast to the foolishness of characters like Parnell or even her father, exemplify the use of this narrative. Elements of the bildungsroman are also present, such as the contrast of the cultures of Christine's upbringing in Philadelphia compared to that of New York. Most notably, Oreo draws heavily upon the Theseus myth, so much so that a quick reading guide at the end of the book summarizes the story's events in terms of the myth. The names of the novel's chapters are also references to the Greek myth. =Point of View= While the novel is told from a third person omniscient point-of-view, there was a strong and deliberate choice to have the reader still be limited in fully understanding what goes through Christine's mind. While her journey is fun and adventurous, Christine runs into certain situations in the novel that can be viewed as traumatic. For example, her near-rape at the hands of Parnell and her viewing of her father's accident are both very extreme events that elicit immediate and raw emotion, yet the reader does not get that from Christine. The reader never gets to go deeper into Christine's mind and is never let in to her true feelings about the journey that she takes to find her father. Themes =Identity= Identity, and its flexibility, proves to be a strong thematic presence in the novel. We see Oreo take on many different characters throughout the novel to fit any given situation, and all of these seem to become absorbed into her already complex identity. Oreo surrounds herself with family members on community members who have created a self-imposed identity, which always seems unfaltering and give the characters a certain inertia (or, in James' case, a very literal inertia), and takes on all of their identities, encouraging and allowing for her journey. She uses her malleable identity to her advantage in finding her father. Oreo's biracial familial history seems to give her the ability to meander about with different masks, becoming whatever will best fit her situation. She becomes a vessel through which her family history can be shone. This shifting identity brings into question, however, who Oreo is at her core. The origins and application of the name Oreo in itself provides insight into what Ross urges readers to understand about the main protagonist's identity. Oreo, named Christine at birth, receives her nickname from a dream her grandmother Louise had. In keeping with Ross' humor, it is the name ‚ÄúOriole‚Äù that Louise hears in her dream, but due to her thick Southern accent, all of their family and friends interpret it as ‚ÄúOreo.‚Äù Moreover, Oreo's ‚Äúrich brown color and wide smile full of sugar white baby teeth‚Äù provides the imagery that justifies naming Christine after the cookie (39). The fact that this nickname functions within the context of the novel as one of endearment adds more dimensions to the use of ‚ÄúOreo‚Äù more traditionally as a derogatory term to describe black people who engage in activities and/or behaviors that are not commonly considered ‚Äúblack‚Äù (\\"black on the outside, white on the inside\\" is the most common definition). In this way, the name \\"Oreo\\" with respect to the main character's identity falls within the boundaries of Trey Ellis' New Black Aesthetic and specifically speaks to the values of the cultural mulatto. According to Ellis, the cultural mulatto does not adhere to the rules of performative blackness or whiteness, but instead seeks to claim ownership to an identity that is all their own while easily navigating both black and white communities and issues-. Through Oreo's experiences and how they are characterized by non-traditional ideas of what it means to be \\"Black,\\" Ross successfully employs the NBA by expressing the diversity of Blackness through new forms. Oreo's search of self throughout the novel also speak to inner ideals of Blackness and how, despite not aligning with traditional Blackness, these ideals still exist in the diaspora. By satirizing the word in a way that it was at first misheard and then applied in loving admiration of Christine's looks, it becomes empowering instead of limiting, and Oreo's fearless personality reflects the symbolism of her nickname. =Representation= Ross brings to the forefront new figures that are usually not represented in talks of Black identity. In Oreo she presents the characters of Jimmie C., the feeble-hearted, fainting nerd, Jimmie's best friend, Fonzelle Scarsdale, a hyper-sexualized F-student with a choreographed heavy walk, the flamboyantly dressed pimp, Parnell, and Kirk the sexual beast with an oversized phallus. Additionally, Ross writes all of her female characters as complex and multifaceted. Oreo herself, the heroine of the story, is quick-witted and interesting, two qualities rarely found in female characters, especially at the time this novel was written. Oreo's mother is incredibly proficient in mathematics, even going so far as to think in mathematical equations in everyday situations. Louise, Oreo's grandmother, is a skilled chef and fluent in a language of her own invention, ‚ÄúLouise-ese.‚Äù Even the minor female characters are portrayed as complex and multifaceted. For example, when Oreo sees Parnell's prostitutes, she contemplates how they are feeling and what they may be thinking in the situation. The prostitutes are not just depicted as simplistic, but rather Ross shows that they can be multifaceted, through the way Oreo thinks about them. Ross's portrayal of women of color in the novel could even be called revolutionary, as they defy any and all stereotypes assigned to not just women, but specifically to women of color. The characters exist outside of both race- and gender-based expectations, and in doing so reflect the postmodern sentiments of Ross's novel. =Language= The novels uses a broad spectrum of languages, including African American vernacular, Yiddish, superstandard language, louise-ese, math, rhyme, singing. Christine's skillful navigation among this broad array of languages points to her cultural hybridity. She is capable of code- switching and interchanging, and communicating with all these languages and their users. Language is very much associated with social standing, intelligence, geographical climates, socioeconomic status, and race. Ross uses an array of different languages and styles of languages; causing the reader to step outside of what is deemed as normative. Knowledge of multiple languages is usually associated with the word \\"cultured,\\" meaning that one has had both the resources and the intellectual capacity to experience different international environments and learn the language of those environments. Louise's character is interesting in this way, because though her speech indicates a black, ill-educated southerner - her cooking does not. Her food also causes others to have responses of pleasure and delight, in a way that her verbal communication would not. Her complexity is duped by the idea that on the exterior, no one can understand her. Ross causes the reader to be confused and confounded by language when the audience might easily judge others for their various levels proficiency (or lack thereof) in language. Oreo represents this massive motherboard of languages (ranging from the scholarly English taught by her professor, to her brother's incoherent phrases. Oreo knows how to mix and meld languages, change \\"accents\\" and dialects, and use vocabulary in a way that cannot be done by the reader. The displacement of the reader in this context gives the effect of the foreignness experienced by the characters in the novel; particularly by a bi-racial child. The contradictions with language in the novel also serve to highlight the absurdity of labels that society places on people. Jimmie C speaks superstandard English, but also invents his own language ‚Äúcha-key-key,‚Äù which he intermingles with superstandard English. Other contradictions with language are also apparent: Louise has white skin because she is albino, but she speaks using ebonics. James Clark professes to hate Jews, yet makes his living from the Jewish market, and has incorporated Yiddish words into his own speech. These situations all seem to be paradoxical, and that is part of Ross's satire. What she is poking fun at, and why she is poking fun at, is a little unclear at this point in the novel. Perhaps Ross is using the contradictions in language to say that assigning certain languages or dialects to certain races is nonsensical and a social construct, rather than indicative of an essential truth about black people and white people. Language is an important and necessary tool in society. Language can determine cultural bonds, relationships, and academic/economic positions. Whether it is displayed vocally or physically, language is not only used for communication and social interaction, but also serves as a foundation of social identity. Fran Ross emphasizes the importance of language in the literacy piece, Oreo, by mixing the different languages, Yiddish, formal English, and Ebonics or slang to allow readers to understand the significance of identity and environment adaption. Ross draws light to the common experience many black people share known as code-switching. In today's society there is one formal accepted type of professional language no matter where a person is from or cultural identity aligns, that individual is expected to use that form of language in certain environments. Understanding why Ross's character, Oreo chooses to speak formal around her teachers vs. slang talk around friends is a key element to the perception that language gives to a person's identity. People are born with identities that cannot be changed, but black people often have a unique experience of choosing which identities they want shown most or value most in society. In Ross, Oreo is shown to be in touch with her black identity, yet struggles to fully understand her Jewish identity due to being biracial with an absent father. Oreo seeks to connect with her father in a sense to find and accept a piece of her valued identity outside of her blackness. She uses language as a way to keep multiple elements of her identity intact, so that she is not only expected to identify with her black roots, but is known more as a multi-dimensional person with a variety of identities that make her who she is. =Sexuality= Christine is the heroine of the tale is on a search for her father. This search is symbolic of her search for identity and history. Christine has few masculine figures in her life. Christine is abandoned by her father, who goes off to start a new family and commits suicide when she finds him. Her grandfather, one of the few present male figures in her life, is immobilized by a stroke. So Christine becomes the masculine figure. The heroine is an embodiment of masculinity. She is the brave, strong, rugged, and powerful protector. She also embodies femininity. The narrator predicts that soon Christine ‚Äúwould be the ideal beauty of legend and folklore-name the nationality, specify the ethnic group. Whatever your legends and folklore bring to mind for beauty of face and form, she would be it.‚Äù She is beautiful, caring, and gentle, towards those she chooses of course. In Christine, we achieve this tender balance of empathy for both sexes, a woman who could not just ‚Äúbreak your balls‚Äù but ‚Äútwist your tits‚Äù . Christine disbands many male characters of their masculinity through WIT, her offensive self-defense system. . Christine devises this system in response to her mother's biased lessons of femininity. Specifically in response to her mother's theory that ‚Äúmen can knock the shit out of woman‚Äù and in her resolve she declares the motto ‚ÄúNemo me impune lacessit-‚ÄòNo one attacks me with impunity‚Äô‚Äù. The WIT system is her mode of protection throughout her journey and the manner by which she exerts masculinity on other male figures as she progresses through her journey. The character Christine is striking in the respect that she refuses to abide by the patriarchal social system and she claims power in society. Ross complicates Black masculinity through the character of Christine and redefines what Black femininity can entail. =Humor= One of the most important aspects of the novel is Ross‚Äô use of humor. As one critic comments, ‚Äúher throwaway lines have more zing than most comic writers‚Äô studied arias.\\" Her use of language is incredibly playful and acerbic, both prosaic and poetic. And the humor is not limited to sentences; the very form of the book is funny bouncing between character descriptions to menus, mathematical equations, and other surprising deviations from the traditional novel format. In her foreword to the novel, author Danzy Senna calls Ross a comic mulatto, stating that her verbal precocity turns the word on its head. Part of why Oreo is so different from the stereotypical narratives of the black experience is because of Ross‚Äô boundary-breaking sense of humor. In placing such an emphasis on humor, Ross calls attention to the cultural importance of comedy and the right to laugh, regardless of race or gender. =Greek Mythology= Through the mythical framework of the story of Theseus, Oreo's picaresque narrative reinvents themes from the white culture she is forced to live in, claiming ownership of an identity that is ‚Äúborrowed‚Äù across racial and class cultures and ultimately embodying Elis's ‚Äúcultural mulatto.‚Äù Ross‚Äô reinterpretations serve to point out the inherently racial and patriarchal nature of Western origin stories. The majority of the chapter titles make some reference to the events and characters of the myth, such as Cercyon, Periphetes, and Sinis. Also, the plot generally follows the same arc. Like Theseus, Oreo embarks on a journey to search for her missing father with the help of few clues. Ross even provides a succinct and extremely satirical commentary in the last chapter to highlight the parallel between the two stories. However, Ross does not replicate myth so much as satirize it. Traditional aspects of the myth ‚Äì such as the shoes and sandals Theseus is given before embarking on his quest ‚Äì are reworked to seem unnecessary and slightly ridiculous. For example, the fearsome Minotaur is cast as bulldog puppy with a studded collar [. Ross‚Äô reinterpretations serve to point out the inherently racial and patriarchal nature of Western origin stories. By introducing such a well-known Greek myth to racial world of Oreo, Ross comments on how the sense of American culture is derived from a specific racial context that tends to exclude the black experience. Introducing Oreo as Theseus is a way of reclaiming a typically white Western mythology. Oreo, an unapologetically complex, biracial woman, being portrayed as Theseus is a way of reclaiming a typically white Western mythology, through a post soul lens, proving there are no genre limitations for contemporary black art. By virtue of her black skin and her Jewish cultural knowledge, Oreo is able to blend into both black and Jewish social spheres. Oreo's ammunition through her journey to self discovery is very much her wit. She knows how to mix and mold languages, alter accents and dialects, and use vocabulary in a way that in many ways can lead the reader lost. The displacement of the reader in this context gives the effect of the foreignness experienced by the characters in the novel; particularly for a biracial child. In certain Greek myths, solving a riddle is a test of the hero's ingenuity, suggesting that life itself is a game of wits. Though, Oreo's journey is not merely an entertaining adventure, but a meaningful quest for self knowledge. If Theseus‚Äô entry into the Labyrinth suggests the masculine hero's search for wholeness followed by the rebirth of a new self through the feminine power of his guide, Ariadne, Oreo's quest to meet her deadbeat father suggests a feminist daughter's claim to self knowledge as well as her determination to challenge and contest the patriarchy (seeing as though meeting her father played no significant role in her journey). ‚ÄúOreo put her package down at the intersection, resting one sandaled foot lightly on top of it as she waited for the light to change. She idly twirled her walking stick, smiled her cookie smile, and whispered slowly and contentedly to herself, \\"Nemo me impune lacessit‚Äù (Ross, 207). Oreo ends her journey capturing and understanding the complexity of her black identity not through her father but through her interactions along the way. Analysis In Oreo, the main character Christine and her entire maternal family is cultured in both Jewish and Black cultures. She is a thriving hybrid, capable of switching from the languages of Yiddish, Standard English, and African American Vernacular English and transforming herself depending on the situation at hand. She is capable of fitting within the Black world because of her skin color and due to the cultural knowledge she possesses of the Jewish cultural background of her maternal family, she is able to blend in within Jewish social spheres. Although Oreo is an example the New Black Aesthetics‚Äô concept of a cultural mulatto,Oreo is more thematic of Post-Soul Aesthetic since it introduces a very unusual Black-Jewish cultural mulatto that conflicts the practice of erasure,the practice of removing other races from the discussion of race and focusing on the White-Black binary. Though Oreo is able to switch between languages (which is another way she is capable of Style- Shifting throughout the novel to show solidarity with the different aspects that make up her genetic and social make-up) of Yiddish and English, almost being able to adapt to any situation, according to Trey Ellis' \\"New Black Aesthetic\\" she exists in the world as a \\"neutered mutation.\\" A \\"Neutered mutation\\" is one that conforms to mainstream society by ridding themselves of their \\"blackness.\\" Oreo would be deemed a \\"neutered mutation\\" because she is in search of her \\"whiteness\\" and not her \\"blackness.\\" Oreo does subtle things to stray away from what she believes is authentic \\"blackness.\\" In doing these things she is trying to avoid her \\"blackness\\" as if she is not really apart of the Black community but because she has been immersed in it since she was a child then she cannot get away from it, she's forced into it. Oreo believes by searching for her Jewish father her identity will take shape and she will finally be whole when in actuality her identity has already taken shaped because of her constant interaction with the Black community. Oreo is in search of something that she believes will almost rid herself of this feeling of emptiness. Her longing for her ‚Äúwhiteness‚Äù can be interpreted as her longing to get away from her ‚Äúblackness.‚Äù Oreo can also be viewed as searching for her identity, since she feels that neither \\"Jewish\\" nor \\"Black\\" fully define her experience. Oreo is in multiple spaces where others assume her identity and treat her according to their assumptions. Oreo never had the opportunity to immerse herself into both of her racial designations, and she believed that finding her father would give her the missing piece of her identity. She was trying to transcend race and find her individual identity.Trey Ellis, \\"New Black Aesthetic\\" =Minor Characters = = Parnell = Parnell is the pimp Oreo encounters outside of Mr. Soundman, Inc. who she named after the British politician and adulterer, Charles Stewart Parnell. Oreo observes Parnell demanding each of his women shine his shoes, then one by one kicking them from behind. Oreo plays a trick on Parnell by walking past him, dropping several dollars on the ground, and waiting for him to bend over before she clubs him to ground with her walking stick. Parnell tumbles to the gutter and Oreo takes off. Before long, Parnell finds Oreo and takes her back to the brothel where he unleashes his beast Kirk, a full grown, primitive man \\"virtually on all fours, caparisoned in a black loincloth\\" (156). Oreo is forced to fight Kirk. Thanks to a \\"protective device,\\" when Kirk attempted to rape Oreo, he recoiled in severe pain. She beat Parnell using one of her sandals, giving him a \\"to-blo\\" to the lower jaw and an \\"el-bo-krac\\" to the ear. Each prostitute took their vengeance on Parnell by stepping on his boots. Parnell serves as an antagonist for Oreo to be tested against. Her fight with Parnell correlates to the slaying of bandits that Theseus accomplishes during his journey from Troezen to Athens. =Miss Hap= Towards the end of the novel, Ross introduces the relatively minor character, Miss Hap (196), who plays the role of the hired cook/caretaker of Oreo's father's family. While Miss Hap is only present for a few chapters, her role in the grander scheme and themes presented within the novel is potentially significant. In light of the novel's relation to the Post-Soul Aesthetic, Miss Hap is the only character that fully exhibits the one-dimensional and stereotypical qualities of the literary Mammy figure. This is especially evident in her speech, small mannerisms (197, 198), and dialogue directed towards a relatively antiquated, southern slave narrative. She is positioned in direct opposition to the rest of the characters Oreo encounters within the warped world of the novel, who all, in some way or another, muddy the waters of black and white dichotomies. She serves, in a way, as a dialogue between the new and the old, and while she is viewed as a slightly comical character, especially in her literal naming, it is she who serves as a final tool and solution for the end of Oreo's quest (203). Critical response Upon its republication by Northeastern University Press in 2000, the then nearly thirty-year-old novel was praised for being ahead of its time. Oreo has been hailed as \\"one of the masterpieces of 20th century American comic writing.\\"J's Theater, May 2007. Furthermore, one critic elaborated that Oreo was \\"a true twenty-first century novel.\\" The novel's \\"wit is global, hybrid and uproarious ... simultaneously irreverent, appropriative and serious. It is post-everything: post-modern, post-identity politics, post- politically correct.\\"Women's Review of Books Novelist Paul Beatty also included an excerpt of Oreo in his 2006 anthology of African-American humor Hokum. In June 2007, Cultural critic Jalylah Burrell listed the book on VIBE.com as the number one work in African-American literature that should be adapted into a major motion picture, writing, \\"Quirky comedy with surrealist elements, i.e., Wes Anderson meets Kaufman/Gondry.\\"VIBE.com, June 2007. Mat Johnson chose Oreo for his 2011 appearance on the NPR program You Must Read This, describing it as \\"one of the funniest books I've ever read, but I've never quoted it. To do so, I would have to put quotations before the first page and then again at the last.\\" He too stated that as a \\"feminist odyssey\\", published eight years before Alice Walker's The Colour Purple, the book had simply been ahead of its time: \\"A truly original view of our world is what we yearn for in fiction, but sometimes when something is so original, so many years ahead of its time, it takes time for the audience to catch up to it. It's a statement of how far we've come that for this quirky, hilarious, odd, little biracial black book, that time is now.\\"Johnson, Mat (9 March 2011). 'Oreo': A Satire Of Racial Identity, Inside And Out, You Must Read This, NPR. Retrieved 10 March 2011 =Relationship to Roots= Oreo came out around the same time as Alex Haley‚Äôs seminal novel Roots: The Saga of an American Family. Both boundary-breaking books for their time in terms of shedding light on the contemporary black experience, Roots went on to be wildly successful, occupying the number one spot on the New York Times best-seller list for twenty two weeks. It was then adapted into an extremely popular television miniseries, one that defined the cultural iconography of the American black experience for many generations. [1] [2] Oreo, in contrast, fell into obscurity soon after publication. It fell out of print for years, until 2000 when the efforts of black poets and writers, in particular Harryette Mullen and Danzy Senna, brought it back into publication and to a certain cult-status There are many reasons for Oreo‚Äôs initial obscurity. Perhaps the most notable is that Haley‚Äôs work presented a more unified picture of the black experience, one that was easier for viewers to latch onto during the tumultuous years of the Civil Rights era. Oreo, a story about a biracial black girl, is a far more complicated look at racial identity than Haley‚Äôs exploration of heritage. Published eight years before Alice Walker‚Äôs The Color Purple, it was also ahead of its time in the way it addressed feminist themes and the intersection between black and Jewish identity. One critic pointed out that being published in 1974, ‚Äúduring the height of the Black Power movement with its focus on African-based identity and black male power‚Äù Oreo almost had no chance at success because the public audience was not ready to take in such a complicated work. Film adaptation The novel was adapted by Adam Davenport into a screenplay intended as a starring vehicle for Keke Palmer. The project is yet to be produced.

The Syariah Courts have jurisdiction only over Muslim in the matters of family law and religious observances, and can generally only pass sentences of not more than three years' imprisonment, a fine of up to RM5,000, and/or up to six strokes of the cane.Jeong Chun Hai @Ibrahim, & Nor Fadzlina Nawi. (2007). Principles of Public Administration: An Introduction. Kuala Lumpur: Karisma Publications. Article 145 of the constitution says the Attorney General of Malaysia has no power over matters related to the Sharia courts. There are three levels of the courts: Appeal, High and Subordinate.https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world- factbook/geos/my.html Unlike the civil courts in Malaysia, which is a federalised court system, the Syariah Court is primarily established out of state law. Similarly syariah or Islamic law is a matter of state law, with the exception of the Federal Territories of Malaysia, as provided in Article 3 of the Constitution. Thus syariah law in one state might differ to that of another state. There are 13 state syariah law departments and one syariah law department for the Federal Territories.

T·ªãnh X√° Trung T√¢m is a Buddhist temple in Ho Chi Minh City, the largest city in Vietnam. It was founded in 1965 and is the spiritual birthplace of the kh·∫•t sƒ© tradition of Vietnamese Buddhism that attempts to recreate the original tradition of the Buddhist sangha by walking barefoot and begging for alms. The temple is located at 7 Nguy·ªÖn Trung Tr·ª±c Street, in B√¨nh Th·∫°nh District. It is known for its weekly B√°t Quan Trai Gi·ªõi (Eight Precept Ritual) retreat, which is staged more frequently than at other institutions in the city, and has a reputation among its followers for rigour and discipline. The attendees of the temple are typically over 40 years of age and are overwhelmingly female. The temple is set on a plot of , and construction took ten years. Initially, the complex comprised two halls, two compounds for the sangha other buildings. The temple was the headquarters of the Vietnamese kh·∫•t sƒ© Sangha Association until 1980. In 1998, an octagonal nine-story tower, named the Buddha Gem Tower, was built. The tower is lit at night and is visible throughout the surrounding area. The bottom four floors form the library as well as the repository for some relics of Gautama Buddha. Many of the inner walls of the halls of the temple are adorned with relief carvings and paintings depicting important events in the life of Buddha. In the courtyard stands a statue of Avalokiteshvara bodhisattva.  History  The founding patriarch of the kh·∫•t sƒ© tradition was Th√≠ch Minh ƒêƒÉng Quang, who was born Nguy·ªÖn Th√†nh ƒê·∫°t in 1923 to a peasant family from the village of Ph√∫ H·∫≠u, B√¨nh Ph√∫ prefecture, Tam B√¨nh District in Vƒ©nh Long Province in the Mekong Delta. He founded the tradition in 1944 with the vow \\"N·ªëi truy·ªÅn Th√≠ch-ca ch√°nh ph√°p ƒê·∫°o Ph·∫≠t Kh·∫•t sƒ© Vi·ªát Nam\\" (Transmitting the correct dharma of Sakyamuni, Kh·∫•t sƒ© Buddhism of Vietnam), which came to be the motto of the kh·∫•t sƒ© tradition. Although he disappeared in 1954, his followers continued to expand and went on to open Tinh Xa Trung Tam.McLeod, pp. 70-75. Buildings and development Statue of Avalokiteshvara The temple is set on a plot of ; construction of the building began in April 1965 and took ten years. The plot of land was donated by a Buddhist layperson named Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Ch√†. Initially, the complex comprised a main ceremonial hall, a patriarch hall, two compounds for the sangha and a set of huts for solitary religious practice. The temple was the headquarters of the kh·∫•t sƒ© Sangha Association from 1966 until 1980. In November 1980, the abbot Th√≠ch Gi√°c To√†n along with Th√≠ch Gi√°c Ph√∫c organised an expansion that involved the erection of a two-storied compound that included the main ceremonial hall. The compound was built in an octagonal shape, as planned by the architect Nguy·ªÖn H·ªØu Thi·ªán. The tower part of the compound is tall, with octagonal sides of length . At the top of the temple are 13 miniature levels, which represent the 13 realms of existence. The tower was constructed from wood, with lotuses depicted on the exterior walls. There are 12 paintings that depict various events in the life of Gautama Buddha, including the birth at Lumbini, the enlightenment at Bodh Gaya, the first dharma talk at Deer Park in Varanasi and the entering of nirvana at Kushinagar. Further parts of the wall display quotes from the Dhammapada written in Vietnamese. The entire artwork on and within the tower was the work of Thi·ªán Ng·ªô and his group of artists from the Art School of Long An. The artwork was created between 1982 and 1984. The main lecture hall on the ground floor has wooden benches and can house several hundred people. A large statue of the patriarch Thich Minh Dang Quang stands at the front of the hall, in front of the wall paintings and a table on a platform where the speaking monk sit while giving a dharma talk.McLeod, p. 80. The centrepiece of the main ceremonial hall on the second level is a statue of Gautama Buddha in the Buddha Hall. It is carved from wood, is tall, and is enclosed in a glass case. Also on this level is a ceramic statue depicting the birth of Prince Siddhartha. It depicts the traditional account of the prince taking seven steps, which resulted in seven lotuses blooming spontaneously, followed by Siddhartha pointing to the sky with his index finger and declaring that this life would be his last in samsara. On the internal wall of the temple are eight murals of the life of Gautama Buddha by Minh Dung and Hai Long. They are high and carved into the wall.McLeod, p. 81. There are two other chambers on the second floor. Behind the Buddha Hall is the patriarch's alcove. The founder of any Vietnamese monastery is typically commemorated there, but in this case, Th√≠ch Minh ƒêƒÉng Quang left no remains, so only his begging bowl and robe are present, protected by a glass enclosure. The bowl is smaller than usual and the robe is of a saffron-dark orange colour. Buddhists often prostrate before the two objects, although as the glass enclosure and the Buddha statues in the main hall lie on the central symmetry axis of the building, they do so at an angle so that their posteriors are not pointing towards the statue of the Buddha. Behind the patriarch's alcove is another chamber, the centre of which is a statue of the bodhisattva Ksitigarbha. Instead of being depicted with the typical staff with six rings around it --representing the six realms of existence--Ksitigarbha is shown with a \\"wish- granting gem\\". To either side of Ksitigarbha are photos of deceased monks and nuns. To the extreme left and right are photographs and names of deceased lay Buddhists, and their ashes are stored in urns below the altar.McLeod, p. 82. In the front courtyard of the temple is a statue Avalokiteshvara bodhisattva, which stands , on a lotus seat high. This is unusually high for an Avalokiteshvara statue in an outdoor courtyard. Before 1975, the kh·∫•t sƒ© Sangha Association had around 300 temples in southern Vietnam, and the temple was the headquarters of the organization. The Buddha Gem Tower In 1998, an octagonal nine-story tower, named the Buddha Gem Tower, was built next to the Bodhi tree. It is high and has a symbolic Torch of Wisdom at the top, which is lit at night and is visible throughout the surrounding area.McLeod, pp. 78-79. The bottom four floors form the library as well as the repository for some of the Buddha's relics. The top five levels are used to enshrine the ashes of monks and nuns.McLeod, p. 79. To the left of the gate is the bookstore, which is run by the lay disciples of the temple. Unlike many other Buddhist institutions, the publications are generally not free. The outlet offers journals published by the government-run Buddhist media, as well as material written by Vietnamese monks, translations of canonical texts, works by internationally renowned Buddhist scholars, and audiovisual recordings of dharma talks by Vietnamese monks. It also sells images and statues of Gautama and Amitabha Buddha, and Avalokiteshvara. Next to the bookstore is the medical clinic, Tue Tinh Duong (Tue Tinh Hall), named after a Tr·∫ßn Dynasty monk and herbal medicine practitioner who was famed for attending to the impoverished and compiling the first known book on Vietnamese herbal medicine. As is the case with medical clinics named in Tue Tinh's honour, the services dispensed are complimentary. The outlet at Tinh Xa Trung Tam is the mendicant sect's most active medical facility.McLeod, p. 77. The Triple Gate (Tam Quan) is accessible by both pedestrians and vehicles. Two-wheeled vehicles and pedestrians use the left and right wings respectively, and cars, buses, and trucks can use the central wing. The three gates represent emptiness, impermanence and middle-view. It is decorated with sculptures and engravings of lotuses, lanterns and swastikas, all prominent symbols in Buddhism.McLeod, p. 78. On the left hand side of the grounds, there is a Bodhi tree, a symbol of the enlightenment of the Buddha. The tree is located in a concrete lotus, and around it are eight samsara-wheel-shaped signs that represent the Noble Eightfold Path. Signs with text explain each of the eight paths. Aside from the two tower complexes, there is a reception office, administrative block, monastic quarters, meditation halls and a kitchen complex where lay supporters prepare meals for the monks and visitors. The monastic quarters and meditation hall are not open to laypeople and can provide accommodation for hundreds of monks. This large capacity is often utilised during the Rains Retreat. This retreat commemorates events during the life of the Buddha, when the rainy season came between the full moons of the fourth and seventh lunar months. As a result, monks of the time stayed in one place to practice rather than travel from place to place.  Intrusions  The Triple Gate of Tinh Xa Trung Tam As with other Buddhist temples in Ho Chi Minh City, rapid urban sprawl in the city has enveloped Tinh Xa Trung Tam and disturbed the serenity that existed when it was first constructed. The area surrounding Tinh Xa Trung Tam is now a noisy neighborhood, and most prominent among the sources of disturbances is a karaoke bar located on an alley leading to the temple. Due to overcrowding in the neighbourhood, joggers often use the monastery grounds, so a sign has been erected indicating \\"Ladies and gentlemen exercisers please follow this route\\" so that they circle the Dharma Tower in a clockwise direction, a path usually taken by Buddhists around stupas as an act of devotion.McLeod, p. 83. In response to the growing noise, a sign has been placed at the gate to remind visitors--Buddhists and non-Buddhists--about etiquette. It says that bicycles and motorcycles should be pushed into the yard with engines turned off. A policy of locking the halls when they are not in use has also been enacted to prevent homeless people from camping there. Some stray dogs have adopted T·ªãnh X√° Trung T√¢m as their home and traipse about during rituals; they are fed vegetarian food. Although begging is not allowed inside the monastery grounds, it is allowed on the footpath outside the camp, and several handicapped people have made themselves a regular presence there.McLeod, p. 84.  Social outreach  The monastery runs a fundraising program for cataract operations in the city, and receives wide support due to public suspicion of charities affiliated with the ruling Communist Party government, due to the communists' strong reputation for rampant corruption.McLeod, pp. 84-85. Following the fall of Saigon and the communist takeover, religious bodies were required to be registered with and loyal to the party. The khat si complied and became one of the nine schools within the state-sanctioned Vietnamese Buddhist Congregation. However, the temple does not fly the national flag, and the only government material or symbols on display within T·ªãnh X√° Trung T√¢m are letters of congratulations for charity initiatives.  Demographics and activities  A dharma talk at T·ªãnh X√° Trung T√¢m The lay attendees at Tinh Xa Trung Tam are predominantly female by a ratio of around 5 to 1, and most of the temple-goers are over 40. Most of the younger lay disciples are relatives of regular, older attendees. In addition to local residents, who make up the bulk of the disciples, some are from other parts of Vietnam, as well as overseas Vietnamese who are temporarily in the country. According to the American professor of Vietnamese history and religion Mark W. McLeod, who did fieldwork at T·ªãnh X√° Trung T√¢m, he did not survey the laypeople about their income, for fear of embarrassing them, but conjectured that most had an above average income as they were able to devote a considerable amount of time to organized religious activity instead of working longer hours.McLeod, p. 92. A regular occurrence at the temple is the weekly B√°t Quan Trai Gi·ªõi (Eight Precepts Ritual). As part of this, the participants take on three additional vows apart from the Five Precepts and stay at the temple for a 24-hour period. These vows prohibit adornments such as makeup and jewellery, the use of comfortable beds and chairs, and eating impurely.McLeod, p. 90. During the retreat day, meals are taken in silence and talking is avoided, apart from during dharma talks, sutra chanting and religious debate. Meditation is also a part of the routine.McLeod, pp. 90-92. Tinh Xa Trung Tam holds the Eight Precepts Ritual more often than any other institution in the city; the next most frequent temple holds the retreat once every two weeks. Dharma talks are held weekly by the resident monks and nuns, which is generally more frequent than at other places in the city. The disciples and monks at the temple told McLeod that they chose Tinh Xa Trung Tam because of what they regarded as a higher level of discipline, rigor and scholarship at the institution.McLeod, p. 76. The monks are transported by their disciples as they are forbidden to drive.McLeod, p. 85. The founder of kh·∫•t sƒ© had been a supporter of freeing birds as an act of compassion, and this has been continued by some monks and lay people as it is believed to be meritorious, but others have spoken out against on the grounds that the demand for birds used for such ceremonies merely prompt more people to capture them in the first place. According to the scholar Mark McLeod, the temple incorporated aspects of both Mahayana and Theravada traditions in its style of practice and architecture. He felt that the modest and uncomplicated wooden statue of the Buddha is more reminiscent of Theravada architecture, while the Ksitigarbha and Avalokiteshvara statues are distinctly Mahayana, as these figures are absent from Theravada teachings. One monk interviewed by McLeod said that his temple's interpretation of Buddhism and its inclusiveness of Mahayana and Theravada aspects is \\"like a tree, which needs roots, a trunk, branches, and leaves; it cannot survive if any is missing.\\" He added that the appropriateness of a teaching, practice, symbol, is independent of its origin, but is determined by \\"whether or not it accords with the Buddha's Teachings.\\" Notes References * External links Category:Religious buildings and structures completed in 1975 Category:Buddhist temples in Vietnam Category:Buddhist temples in Ho Chi Minh City ","title":"T·ªãnh X√° Trung T√¢m"},{"id":"17379723","text":"The Wanskuck Library‚ÄîProvidence Community Library is an historic branch library building at 233 Veazie Street in Providence, Rhode Island.

She has been called a leader in understanding and treating perimenopause and menopause. She is an American who moved to Canada in 1976, and has taken citizenship there. Biography Jerilynn Prior grew up in small Indigenous fishing village in Alaska, USA. Ever since Prior was a young child she knew she was destined to work in health care. Prior was inspired to work in medicine after a public nurse visited her school to administer vaccinations. Prior was granted a scholarship from the National Science Foundation for her to study English literature at Linfield College, Oregon. Prior then proceeded to study at the University of Oregon School of Medicine. However, continuing into her third year of studies, Prior transferred to Boston University School of Medicine. Prior graduated with honors, completing her master's degree in medicine in 1969.. Prior received her first training placement at Internal Medicine in Boston. Prior became a physician and worked in various states across the USA. Prior moved to Canada in 1976 because she believed in the universal healthcare system. Prior says that her research would have been very limited had she stayed in America. Prior became a Canadian citizen in 1984 and currently lives in Vancouver, British Columbia. Prior has been retired from clinical practice since 2009, after spending 40 years helping patients. Prior still partakes in consultations with health care practitioners in Canada and has been a professor at the University of British Columbia since 1994. Prior still works full time by doing research, writing and teaching. Starting in 1967, Prior engaged in tax resistance to protest government spending on war, and she continued this protest after her move to Canada, refusing to pay a portion of her federal income tax equivalent to the war-related portion of the federal budget. When the government pursued the withheld money, Prior contested this in court. The Tax Court rejected her case, which she then appealed on freedom of conscience / freedom of religion grounds to the Federal Court of Appeal, which turned her down in 1988. The Supreme Court declined to hear her appeal in 1990, and a further appeal to the UN Human Rights Committee also met with no success.; Friends Journal July & October, 1987; She wrote a book about her struggle: I Feel the Winds of God Today.Friends Journal June, 1993  Scientific Work  Dr. Prior has proved to be a leader in the scientific community, especially regarding the use of progesterone; in fact, unlike many of her colleagues, Prior has been prescribing progesterone for postmenopausal women and perimenopausal women to treat hot flashes, night sweats, heavy flow, and sore breasts since 1995. In a 2014 study conducted by Dr. Prior and colleagues, it was proven that progesterone is an effective treatment for menopausal hot flashes and night sweats. These findings debunk the beliefs that progesterone causes serious health concerns, including cardiovascular disease, and shows how the negative effects of progesterone have been \\"overblown\\". Within the international scientific community, Dr. Prior is especially known for her studies that prove progesterone causes women's increased bone formation. Dr. Prior has also conducted extensive research regarding combined hormonal contraceptive, more commonly known as 'the pill'. Specifically, Dr. Prior has found evidence suggesting that using the pill early on can impact reproductive health. In her review of the long-term effects for younger patients using the pill, Dr. Prior found that women who had been on the pill had lower ovarian reserve and also took longer to conceive a first child. By focusing her research on adolescents, Dr. Prior is contributing to a field of research that has been mostly focused on older women. Additionally, Dr. Prior has often and openly voiced hesitation for dispensing birth control for reasons \\"it was never designed for\\". According to Dr. Prior, most young women taking the pill are not given a prescription for birth control, but for an array of other reasons including cramping, acne, heavy periods, and irregular cycles. However, Dr. Prior argues that it takes years for a regular ovulation to take place, that \\"our bodies need time to find their natural cycle\\" and that other prescriptions or medicine are better suited. For example, taking ibuprofen for alleviate the pain of cramps is a much better solution, given that it also lessens heavy flow. For adolescents, Dr. Prior recommends either a progestin-releasing IUD or a \\"combination of diaphragm and spermicidal gel\\", which are safer alternatives to the pill and more effective given that teens are not as diligent as older women when taking the pill. Academic/Career Accomplishments  Prior is Professor of Endocrinology and Metabolism at the University of British Columbia, founder and scientific director of the Centre for Menstrual Cycle and Ovulation Research (CeMCOR), director of the BC Center of the Canadian Multicenter Osteoporosis Study (CaMOS), and a past president of the Society for Menstrual Cycle Research. Prior is the author of three books, has over 200 publications, and holds 6 patents. She was awarded the University of British Columbia Faculty of Medicine Distinguished Medical Research Lecturer Award in 2002. Her research-based novel Estrogen's Storm Season was a finalist in the 2006 Independent Publishers Book Awards for Health. She co-wrote the perimenopause chapter for the 40th anniversary edition of Our Bodies, Ourselves. Susan Love has called Prior a \\"champion for women's health\\", and she has been credited as one of the first researchers to propose that psychological and sociocultural factors must be considered in medical research on women's health. Prior has been critical of the \\"medicalization of all things female\\" and has been recognized for pioneering research into women's ranges of normal experiences and physiology.  Contributions to Feminism  When Prior first began her career in medicine, she was amongst one of the very few women in the field. Through all of Prior's scientific contributions and her valued reputation, she has created an environment where people are \\"less quick to judge someone negatively just because she is a woman.\\". Prior has opened up new doors to research which will further benefit and educate women all around the world Prior has achieved remarkable advancements as a feminist, specifically when it comes to the advancement of research on endocrinological health. Feminist approaches have seldomly included women reaching the menopausal stages in life. Prior has extended the common feminist notion and pushed for inclusion of aging and senior women in movements and research. Prior has highlighted that women were originally seen as being biologically inferior. Through Prior's scientific work, she has argued that women should be deemed equal in value to men, without cultural prejudice. Prior's main premise through her research is \\"women should have safe, appropriate treatments and the means to understand their own bodies\\" the same way men do. Prior has taken a stance in defence of discrimination when it comes to scientific research. Women have been left out of scientific studies as a result of physiological variabilities in terms of menstruation. Prior responded to the notion by saying that in science comparing men to women is like \\"comparing apples to oranges.\\" In other words, men cannot adequately replace women in research because of physiological differences. As a result of scientific exclusion, women currently do not have accurate information about specific interventions. Prior says that women are more likely to have an adverse reaction to medicine, which makes it very significant for women to be heavily involved in research. By advocating for the inclusion of women in scientific research, Prior is contributing to feminism.

Its principal visible component is a concrete block structure, finished in stucco and topped by a hip roof, which is about . This building stands atop a large cast-in-place concrete well, in which pumps and gate valves are housed. The facility was built in 1911 to pump raw sewage from the low-lying Washington Park area to the Field's Point wastewater treatment facility, which lies about to the north. The pump station is located well back from the street, behind a low brick distribution facility. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. History The Washington Park Sewage Pumping Station was designed under the supervision of Otis F. Clapp, the then-current Office of City Engineer for Providence. The construction was also overseen by Frederick O. Clapp, Assistant Engineer. Photo, 2017 The pump serves an area of roughly with the intention to serve up to six thousand residents and storm drainage needs. The sewer system for the Washington Park district was ordered on July 31, 1912, and completed by October 16, 1913. By the end of 1913, the sewer system leading to the pump system comprised about of regular sewers and of storm drain sewers with another of sewer between the pump and the Field's Point plant. In 1915, it was estimated that of sewage was pumped by the pumping station. About 225 houses were connected to the sewer system that lead to the pumping station, but it was reported that due to the sewer system that it furthered the demand for \\"higher quality homes\\" in the area. Significance The Washington Park Sewage Pumping Station is historically significant as part of Providence's community planning and development in regards to the processing and treatment of sewage for the growing city. Re- annexed by Providence in 1868, the Washington Park area remained largely undeveloped until public transportation made the area accessible. Continuous residential growth from the late 1890s into the 1930s required the extension of the sewage system. It is a representative example of city planning for sewage treatment with a longstanding functionality with its structural integrity. The facility was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989.

It is the most well-known temple in the town and is a Khmer temple; the town is close to the border with Cambodia and has a large ethnic Khmer population. Description The temple is situated on a 3.5 hectare block of land that is marked by a large number of high and shady trees. The temple was first built in 1533, when the area was under the control of the Khmer Empire, before the area was taken over by Vietnamese settlers in the 17th and 18th centuries. It initially consisted of a wooden building with a thatched roof, before being replaced with a tiled roof. There are four entrances for the temple, in the northern, southern, eastern and western directions. The temple has been renovated many times in the five centuries since its construction but has not been renovated in the last 80 years. From the first abbot Th√≠ch Th·∫°ch S√≥c to the current abbot, there have been 21 abbots. The main ceremonial hall occupies an area of 416 m; it is 20 m wide and 20.80 m long. It stands on an elevated platform around a metre above ground level. The roof is held up by 12 wide pillars built in the Corinthian style of Greece. It is painted in shiny black coating, with gold coloured paintings of dragons and fish wrapping themselves around the pillar. A placard stands in front of the main altar and lengthens to the ceiling of the main hall, with inscriptions in gold paint. At the centre of the main hall is the statue of Gautama Buddha, which stands 6.80 m high and 2.70 m wide. A plaque with a Khmer inscription denotes that the 17th abbot of the temple organised the erection of the statue in 1916, funded by the family of Lum Sum. The temple is ornamented with various objects in the Khmer tradition. Krud Krud or Garuda is a representation of god with a bird's head and wings and a human body. The bird's beak holds a piece of jade. This type of bird is depicted as the eternal enemy of the snake. The Krud is depicted biting the tail of a snake on the ornaments of the temple roof. Yeak In Khmer folklore, Yeak is the representation of evil, and is usually depicting causing trouble to living beings. It is often depicted by a human with a fiery face, large mouth, long canine teeth, bulging eyes, wearing a suit of armour, sherp- pointed helmet and a long pike. Two statues of Yeak are placed at either side of the temple to represent the defeat of evil by the Buddha and the conversion of Yeak into a protector of Buddhism. Two statues of Reach Cha Sei stand on either side of the entrance. This is a creature on which a female god and Yeak stood when they engaged in combat. A statue of Teahu, depicted as an angry, vicious person, who has the sun and moon is hand, in preparation for swallowing. It also stands at the entrance. The temple grounds contain six stupas, in which the cremated remains of various monks and laypeople are enshrined. The temple was declared a historic heritage site by the Culture Ministry on April 27, 1990.

This area, which was in the 19th century part of the Moses Brown farm, was platted for development in 1891, with most of the construction taking place in the early decades of the 20th century. Most of the residential properties in the district are single-family houses, typically built in revival styles popular at the time. They are set on similarly-sized lots with fairly uniform setbacks, and were typically built without garages (which were often added later). There are a number of two-family houses, and a small number of apartment buildings, most of which are found on the arterial roads of the area. There are several religious buildings, including several churches; the most architecturally distinctive religious building is the Jewish Temple Beth El, built 1951‚Äì54.

The ones that were built were done so by the Italians from the 1920s as part of their colonial administration. Today there are no functioning railway stations active in the country, but new ones are planned, as part of a new railroad system. Libya railways project History Between 1920 and 1936 the Italians built some five small railways in Italian Libya. Served by a host of small stations. Indeed, the Kingdom of Italy built in Libya nearly 400 km of railways with gauge. Nearly 40 small and big railways stations were built in Libya by the Italians, when they ruled Libya. The biggest and most important was the one of Italian Tripoli. In 1965 were closed the last remaining stations in Benghazi and Soluch. Actually no one is active, but there it is a huge project of building new ones with modern railways, contracted by Chinese and Russians under former dictator Kaddafi. Fiat train \\"Littorina\\" at Tripoli Station Benghazi Railway Station in 1930 By the 1960s there were only two small railways in Libya, departing from Benghazi and serving classical Littorine: Benghazi-Barce and Benghazi-Soluch. In 1965 last remaining stations in Benghazi and Soluch closed. Today no active railway exists in Libya. =Tripoli Station= Tripoli station in the capital Tripoli, was the main terminal for western Libya, not far away from the port and the \\"Fiera internazionale di Tripoli\\". The station was connected to the stations of Zuara, Tagiura and Garian by small but very active railways. =Benghazi Station= Benghazi station was the second in importance, located in downtown Benghazi. It closed in 1963, when the last small railway of former Italian Libya the Benghazi-Solluch line was closed and dismantled. Barce Railway station in 1930 =Secondary Stations= Other important railways stations were those in: * Barce * Zuara * Garian * Soluch * Tagiura  New railway stations  Plans for a new rail network, complete with stations have been under development for some time since the end of the 20th century. In the first years of the 21st century an ambitious railway plan was drawn up, with the support of former dictator Gaddafi. With backing from Russian Railways and China work started in September 2008 with earthworks begun between Sirte and Ras Ajdir, Tunisia border, in 2001-5, and in 2008 and 2009 various contracts were placed and construction work started on a standard gauge railway parallel to the coast from the Tunisian border at Ras Ajdir to Tripoli, and on to Misrata, Sirte, Benghazi and Bayda. Another railway line will run inland from Misrata to Sabha at the centre of a mineral-rich area. However, due to the ongoing conflict as a result of the Libyan Civil War, no new work on the rail network has been carried out since 2012.

The farmhouse was built in 1742 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. Location When it was constructed in 1742, the property was located on the northwest limit of the Providence city line, in a region commonly referred to as Elmhurst. At the time, the area was sparsely populated and \\"primarily agricultural and had little in common with commercial Providence.\\" As a result, in 1765, the northwestern Mt. Pleasant and Elmhurst areas of the city became part of North Providence. It is now located just west of the Providence College campus. Architectural styles and context The original portion of the house, constructed in 1742, is built in the Cape Cod style, which was prominent at the time. Cape Cod style homes were made popular by English colonists who came to America in the 17th century. The style resembled half-timbered houses of England, but the colonists adapted the style to account for inclement New England weather. The building is typical of traditional colonial era Cape Cod Houses in that it is one and a half stories tall, features a steeped roof with side gables, a large central chimney, and a symmetrical facade with a door in the center. The house's 1815 addition reflects the Georgian Colonial architectural style. It is square and symmetrical in shape, and features a medium pitched roof with a minimal overhang, and a decorative crown over the central door. This section of the house is often mistakenly cited to be of the Federal Style. However, Georgian homes are more square and angular, and Federal style buildings are more likely to have curved, decorative flourishes. Typically, American Federal houses have low-pitched or flat roofs, and feature a semicircular fanlight window, or roof over front door. These features are not present on the addition. Originally developed in England, the Georgian Style was very popular in New England, and the Eastern Seaboard of the United States, between 1700 and 1785. As architectural historian Leland Roth explains, colonists' \\"increasing wealth resulted in more frequent travel to England, and an increased awareness among wealthy colonials of what their English counterparts were doing.\\" As a result, wealthy builders hired skilled craftsmen to come over from England, and numerous architectural treatises and pattern books became popular during the time. All these factors increased the popularity of the Georgian style. The property includes, in addition to the main house, a carriage house, corn crib, well house, schoolhouse and workshop.

The \\"Balfour\\" Stradivarius \\"Balfour & Co. by 1901 had already set themselves up as violin experts but in fact were shipping, passenger, and commission agents with little knowledge of the violin world. They claim to have discovered a ‚ÄúStradivari of 1692, the finest in the world for sale at ¬£1,000.‚Äù The violin was originally sold by William Voller to Balfour for ¬£45 with no attempt to defraud or mislabel and thus takes its name from the company that subsequently offered it for sale. Balfours‚Äô exploited this ‚Äòfind‚Äô in a remarkable way; certificates given with enthusiasm and florid descriptions were gathered from Silvestre-Maucotel, Gustav Bernardel, Nestor Audinot, C.A. Chanot, F.W. Chanot and the wholesale firm of Beare & Sons - George Hart, J & A Beare and W.E. Hill & Sons were conspicuous by their absence. These certificates with translations surround Balfour & Co.‚Äôs general guarantee document.\\" \\"After an unsuccessful attempt to sell it at Puttnick's (where it was bought in) it was sold privately for ¬£2,500. This prompted an anonymous letter stating: \\"You know it is only a clever 'fake' and signed 'One who knows who made it.' Once the new owner of the 'Balfour' violin realized his mistake, civil court proceedings were instigated that resulted in an out-of-court settlement.\\" The construction of the \\"Balfour\\" Stradivarius was an attempt of good effort but not entirely convincing: \\"The purfling is ebony, an obvious sign rhat the violin could not be a genuine Stradivari. Another error which they petpetrared on this and most of their instruments is the short scarfed joint in the purfling on, or just beside, the centre joint at both ends of the back. Cremonese instruments generally have a longer overlapping mitre placed well away from the centre line. The typical Cremonese-style pins are present however, at each end of the back, half covered by the puifling itself. The only slight stylistic weaknesses in the violin in general are the same as are found in other Vollet work. The scroll, although a beautiful piece of carving, just misses the lightness and accuracy of a Sttadivari head of this period, and the edges are perhaps a little too evenly rounded off with sandpaper The soundholes, too, are relatively weak, with very small nicks and slightly jagged knife-cut circles where Strad would have used a cylindrical cutter.\\"John Dilworth, Andrew Fairfax & John Milnes.

After heavy fighting against the Soviet Army in Prussia, Pomerania, Silesia, and Saxony, the Corps surrendered to Soviet troops on May 8, 1945. History The Fallschirm-Panzerkorps Hermann G√∂ring was activated in early October 1944, and the Fallschirm-Panzergrenadier Division 2 Hermann G√∂ring, along with its sister Panzer division, Hermann G√∂ring Panzer Division, was transferred to the command of the corps. The Panzerkorps was then transferred to the East Prussia‚ÄìKurland region to halt the Soviet offensive which had already achieved the isolation of Army Group North in the Kurland Pocket and was now aimed at the capture of East Prussia. The Panzerkorps was involved in heavy defensive fighting near Gumbinnen, and when the Soviet assault petered out in late November, the Panzerkorps set up static defensive lines. The massive Soviet Vistula-Oder Offensive trapped the Hermann G√∂ring Panzerkorps in the Heiligenbeil Pocket along with the rest of the 4th Army. In February, the Heer's √©lite Gro√üdeutschland Panzergrenadier Division was attached to the corps. Despite several breakout attempts, the Panzerkorps had to be evacuated by sea to Swinem√ºnde in Pomerania. Upon landing, it was thrown back into combat, defending the Oder-Neisse line against Soviet attacks through mid-March. To bolster the corps' strength, the elite Brandenburg Panzergrenadier Division was attached to the unit. In April, the remnants of the Hermann G√∂ring Panzerkorps was sent to Silesia, and in heavy fighting was slowly pushed back into Saxony. On April 22, the Fallschirm-Panzer-Division 1. Hermann G√∂ring was one of two divisions that broke through the inter-army boundary of the Polish 2nd Army (Polish People's Army or LWP) and the Soviet 52nd Army, in an action near Bautzen, destroying parts of their communications and logistics trains and severely damaging the Polish (LWP) 5th Infantry Division and 16th Tank Brigade before being stopped two days later.Erickson, John: \\"The Road to Berlin\\", page 591.

Losses for the Polish 2nd Army (LWP) in the area of Bautzen and Dresden are noted as approximately 5,000 KIA, 2,800 missing or taken prisoner, and 10,500 WIA.

Among these losses were 170 tanks, 56 self-propelled guns, 124 mortars, 232 guns of all calibers, 330 vehicles, and 1,373 horses. By early May, the Panzerkorps was positioned near the Saxon capitol of Dresden. The remains of the corps began breakout attempts to the west, in order to surrender to the Americans who were currently halted on the Elbe. Despite breakout attempts, the corps was encircled, and although several small groups successfully made it through to the west, the majority of the corps surrendered to the Soviets on 8 May 1945.

History The church congregation was founded in 1706 as St. Paul's Church and was established by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts (SPG). The original congregation consisted of 17 landholder families. The Rev. Samuel Fayerweather closed the church in 1774 due to the American Revolutionary War, and in 1780 the SPG withdrew its support for Fayerweather because of his support for the American cause. The church re-formed by the Rev. William Smith in 1787 after a thirteen-year hiatus. In 1799 the congregants voted to move the church to its present location in Wickford. On April 11, 1756, the infant \\"son of Gilbert Stewart ye Snuff Grinder\\" was baptized in the church. The child later changed his name to Gilbert Stuart and grew up to be known as one of America's foremost portraitists. Building The church had a steeple from 1811 to 1846. The church building was constructed in 1707, about five miles southwest of Wickford, on what is now Pendar Road. At the time, this road was expected to become the main route between Boston and New York, but this never came to pass. After some time the neighborhood became scarcely populated, and in 1800 the church was disassembled and moved to its current location. The church contains box pews, a balcony, and an organ built in 1680 by Bernard Smith, which is among the oldest organs still used in services in the United States. The church had a steeple attached to its western end from 1811 to 1846, but the steeple was not strong enough to hold the swinging bell, and it collapsed. The Episcopal Diocese of Rhode Island currently owns the building, and it is administered by a trust which has representatives of the modern Saint Paul's Church in Wickford. A more modern church building, known as St. Paul's Church, was built nearby in 1847. Currently the congregation of St. Paul's meets in the Old Narragansett Church during the summer months. The church was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973 and has a small churchyard cemetery.

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. History Theatre By The Sea (TBTS) has had many incarnations over the years. Between 1928 and 1933, Mrs. Alice Jaynes Tyler ran a camp for girls on the property of her summer home. With the Great Depression quickly limiting the market for summer camps, she decided to instead create jobs by turning the old shingled barn into a theatre. She teamed up with Russian defector and actor Leo Bulgakoff, the cockney producer, Leslie Spiller and famed lighting designer Abe Feder ‚Äì and on August 7, 1933, Mrs. Jaynes‚Äô 300-seat barn theatre came to life. The theater was founded in 1933. The next thirty five years brought numerous changes. On September 21, 1938, the New England Hurricane of 1938 caused extensive damage which led to the first major alterations. After carefully cutting the theatre in half with a hand saw, the box office was literally pulled forward by a dump truck, and a new section of theatre and a balcony were added. By 1941, with the war raging, the theatre went mainly dark. During this time, it did however became a target spot for military planes to practice their diving maneuvers during the war and sporadically played as a movie house. By 1947, during the Golden Era of Summer Stock, TBTS was again in full swing and entered into a long and fruitful stretch that lasted for almost 10 years. Famous \\"golden era\\" stars that played TBTS include Marlon Brando, Carol Channing, Groucho Marx, Tallulah Bankhead, Mae West, Judy Holiday, Shelley Winters, and many others. The passing of Mrs. Tyler in 1951, Hurricane Carol in 1954 and a ‚Äúdark‚Äù summer in 1959, threatened the theatre's life when it shut again in 1963. In 1967, upon hearing that the theatre was to be destroyed, Tommy Brent, former Press Agent and Producer saved the theater from demolition by mere hours. Mr. Brent was able to run the theatre for 22 years. However, the property itself was in serious need of repair and renovation. The multi-faceted entertainment company, FourQuest took over the theatre in 1988 and became the third owners of the property. Following extensive renovations that fall and winter, FourQuest re-opened the theater in the spring of 1989 and continued until the fall of 2003. The theatre closed again until a Massachusetts businessman and movie theatre owner, Mr. William Hanney, purchased the property, hoping to continue the tradition of theatre at this historic Rhode Island landmark. From 2007-2012 shows at Theatre by the Sea were produced by the not-for-profit organization Ocean State Theatre Company. In 2013 Mr. Hanney and Production company Matunuck Live Theatre assumed production responsibilities.

Wenchuan earthquake On May 12, 2008, an earthquake with moment magnitude 7.9 hit the Sichuan Province, with epicentre located in the town of Yingxiu, in Wenchuan county. The county was therefore one of the areas most severely affected by the earthquake. In Chinese, the earthquake is named after the county (the Wenchuan earthquake, Ê±∂Â∑ùÂú∞Èúá), which made its name resonate across the nation. In the county, 15,941 people died, 34,583 were injured, and 7,474 were still missing as of June 6, 2008. The seismic intensity was the highest, reaching level XI in the China Seismic Intensity Scale. After the earthquake, the central government enforced stricter requirements for seismic design in this area. The earthquake also caused many landslides, some of which remained active for years and generated destructive debris flows during the summer rainstorms, which increased the death toll and slowed reconstruction and recovery of the communities in the county.

The player takes on control of a futuristic plane to defeat many extraterrestrial ships and tripods. The plane's main weapons are lasers and rockets. The game includes two discs. The first disc takes place on earth where the player must liberate the planet from the alien invaders, which is called Invasion Earth. The second disc takes place on Mars, which is called Operation Jumpgate. Shock Wave was a pack-in game for the Goldstar 3DO. Plot The year is 2019 and the alien invasion is here. In a surprise attack, the aliens decimate Earth's military forces. Mankind's only hope is the surviving orbital space carrier Omaha and its squadron of F-177 pilots. As the young and inexperienced member of the squadron, it is the protagonist's job to drive the aliens from the planet. Gameplay Most of Shockwave Assault takes place in the cockpit of a F-177 fighter. The fighter is armed with a rapid fire laser which consumes energy and a limited number of homing missiles. The ship automatically levels off when it stops turning. The thrusters consume fuel, but give the ship a useful burst of speed. The shield is depleted as the ship runs into things or is hit by enemy fire. Each of these resources can be replenished by flying under the refueling drones that are located at fixed locations in each mission. The ship automatically hovers over the terrain, making it impossible to crash. The player must fight through 15 missions (10 in the 3DO version), each with a boss at the end. The levels take place at various places around the Earth, and the terrain is modeled appropriately (Egypt has desert terrain, Peru has jungles, etc.). At the start of each mission the player is briefed on what to expect, and throughout the level, the onboard computer gives additional information that changes depending on the player's performance. Expansion The game received an expansion, Shock Wave: Operation JumpGate, on the 3DO. Playing it requires a save file from the original Shock Wave to be in the 3DO's memory. Ports All later versions of the game (Windows, Mac OS, Apple Pippin, PlayStation, and Saturn) include the original content and the expansion pack in the same release. The Apple Pippin version was released only in North America. The Windows version was the first Electronic Arts game specifically designed to utilize the enhancements of the Windows 95 operating system. Project director Phillippe Tarbouriech explained, \\"Many of the 3D effects in Shockwave Assault would not have been possible under MS-DOS or Windows 3.1. In addition, Win 95 allows the PC to play streaming video for the first time.\\" In June 1995, Atari Corporation realized a deal with EA to bring select titles to the Atari Jaguar CD, with Shock Wave being among them, but this port was never released due to the commercial and critical failure of the Atari Jaguar platform. Reception The original 3DO release received mixed reviews. The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly criticized the over- sensitive controls but praised the texture-mapped graphics and off-rails gameplay. They made particular note of the game's use of full motion video, saying that in sharp contrast to previous FMV-heavy games, the quality was sharp, the acting was good, and the overall use of FMV was \\"more of an addition to the game instead of the whole emphasis.\\" GamePro was more critical, stating that FMVs would preempt the HUD display even in situations where the radar is needed, and the inability to alter altitude makes it feel \\"like you're flying in a box.\\" However, the reviewer agreed that the texture- mapped graphics and FMV cutscenes are impressive, and concluded, \\"Shock Wave's tough adversaries and first-rate graphics make it a decent 3DO shooter.\\" Next Generation reviewed the 3DO version of the game, and stated that \\"If you own a 3DO unit and you've been just dying for a no-frills shooting game, then it's OK. But anyone with greater expectations will be disappointed.\\" GamePro praised the game's length and the PlayStation version's new and improved animations, summarizing it as \\"one very cool shooter\\". A Next Generation critic said that while it runs noticeably smoother than the 3DO original and has the added bonus of the Operation Jumpgate expansion, \\"it's still pretty boring, at least right up until the point where it becomes utterly too difficult to get any farther.\\" He elaborated that despite the 15 levels using different textures and theoretically being based on aerial photographs, they all look and play much the same. He did, however, praise the way the game runs full motion video alongside real time gameplay. A review of the Macintosh version in the same issue made the same criticisms about the sameness of the levels and none of the same praises, summarizing the game as \\"the perfect title for those who don't mind brainless action patterns over and over.\\" Despite this, it was given a higher score than the PlayStation version. Unlike the earlier releases, the Saturn version received resoundingly negative reviews. The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly praised the storyline, full motion video, and lengthy content, but said the gameplay is repetitive and frustrating, since the limited controls make it unfairly difficult to avoid taking hits. Sega Saturn Magazines Rob Bright agreed that though each level has different objectives, the gameplay nonetheless boils down to repetitive wandering and simplistic firefights. He also argued that the storyline is simplistic, and the full motion video sequences which deliver it are \\"hugely naff\\". A reviewer for Next Generation deemed it \\"antiquated and repetitious\\" in a brief review. Next Generation reviewed Shock Wave: Operation JumpGate, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \\"The follow-up isn't as complete as the original, but is twice as challenging. It's sure to be more than satisfying to fans of the game.\\" Sequel The game received a 3DO-exclusive sequel, Shock Wave 2: Beyond the Gate, published by Electronic Arts. Publishing rights for the sequel were later sold to Aztech New Media Corp. and a Macintosh port made in 1996 but not released due to low sales for the 3DO version was released in 1998 as part of their Mac Pack Blitz compilation.

He served as Leader of the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) from 1975 to 1980 and led its successor political party, the ZANU ‚Äì Patriotic Front (ZANU‚ÄìPF), from 1980 to 2017. Ideologically an African nationalist, during the 1970s and 1980s he identified as a Marxist‚ÄìLeninist, and as a socialist after the 1990s. Mugabe was born to a poor Shona family in Kutama, Southern Rhodesia. Educated at Kutama College and the University of Fort Hare, he worked as a schoolteacher in Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia, and Ghana. Angered by white minority rule of his homeland within the British Empire, Mugabe embraced Marxism and joined African nationalists calling for an independent state controlled by the black majority. After making anti-government comments, he was convicted of sedition and imprisoned between 1964 and 1974. On release, he fled to Mozambique, established his leadership of ZANU, and oversaw its role in the Rhodesian Bush War, fighting Ian Smith's predominately white government. He reluctantly participated in peace talks in the United Kingdom that resulted in the Lancaster House Agreement, putting an end to the war. In the 1980 general election, Mugabe led ZANU-PF to victory. As Prime Minister of the newly renamed Zimbabwe, Mugabe's administration expanded healthcare and education and‚Äîdespite his professed desire for a socialist society‚Äîadhered largely to mainstream, conservative economic policies. Mugabe's calls for racial reconciliation failed to stem growing white emigration, while relations with Joshua Nkomo's Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU) also deteriorated. In the Gukurahundi of 1982‚Äì1987, Mugabe's Fifth Brigade crushed ZAPU-linked opposition in Matabeleland in a campaign that killed at least 10,000 people, mostly Ndebele civilians. Internationally he sent troops into the Second Congo War and chaired the Non-Aligned Movement (1986‚Äì89), the Organisation of African Unity (1997‚Äì98), and the African Union (2015‚Äì16). Pursuing decolonisation, Mugabe emphasised the redistribution of land controlled by white farmers to landless blacks, initially on a \\"willing seller‚Äìwilling buyer\\" basis. Frustrated at the slow rate of redistribution, from 2000 he encouraged black Zimbabweans to violently seize white-owned farms. Food production was severely impacted, leading to famine, economic decline, and Western sanctions. Opposition to Mugabe grew, but he was re-elected in 2002, 2008, and 2013 through campaigns dominated by violence, electoral fraud, and nationalistic appeals to his rural Shona voter base. In 2017, members of his own party ousted him in a coup, replacing him with former vice president Emmerson Mnangagwa. Having dominated Zimbabwe's politics for nearly four decades, Mugabe was a controversial figure. He was praised as a revolutionary hero of the African liberation struggle who helped free Zimbabwe from British colonialism, imperialism, and white minority rule. Critics accused Mugabe of being a dictator responsible for economic mismanagement, widespread corruption in Zimbabwe, anti-white racism, human rights abuses, and crimes against humanity. Early life =Childhood: 1924‚Äì1945= Robert Gabriel Mugabe was born on 21 February 1924 at the Kutama Mission village in Southern Rhodesia's Zvimba District. His father, Gabriel Matibiri, was a carpenter while his mother Bona was a Christian catechist for the village children. They had been trained in their professions by the Jesuits, the Roman Catholic religious order which had established the mission. Bona and Gabriel had six children: Miteri (Michael), Raphael, Robert, Dhonandhe (Donald), Sabina, and Bridgette. They belonged to the Zezuru clan, one of the smallest branches of the Shona tribe. Mugabe's paternal grandfather was Chief Constantine Karigamombe, alias \\"Matibiri\\", a powerful figure who served King Lobengula in the 19th century. Through his father, he claimed membership of the chieftaincy family that has provided the hereditary rulers of Zvimba for generations. The Jesuits were strict disciplinarians and under their influence Mugabe developed an intense self-discipline, while also becoming a devout Catholic. Mugabe excelled at school, where he was a secretive and solitary child, preferring to read, rather than playing sports or socialising with other children. He was taunted by many of the other children, who regarded him as a coward and a mother's boy. In about 1930 Gabriel had an argument with one of the Jesuits, and as a result the Mugabe family was expelled from the mission village by its French leader, Father Jean-Baptiste Loubi√®re. The family settled in a village about away; the children were permitted to remain at the mission primary school, living with relatives in Kutama during term-time and returning to their parental home on weekends. Around the same time, Robert's older brother Raphael died, likely of diarrhoea. In early 1934, Robert's other older brother, Michael, also died, after consuming poisoned maize. Later that year, Gabriel left his family in search of employment in Bulawayo. He subsequently abandoned Bona and their six children and established a relationship with another woman, with whom he had three further offspring. Loubi√®re died shortly after and was replaced by an Irishman, Father Jerome O'Hea, who welcomed the return of the Mugabe family to Kutama. In contrast to the racism that permeated Southern Rhodesian society, under O'Hea's leadership the Kutama Mission preached an ethos of racial equality. O'Hea nurtured the young Mugabe; shortly before his death in 1970 he described the latter as having \\"an exceptional mind and an exceptional heart\\". As well as helping provide Mugabe with a Christian education, O'Hea taught him about the Irish War of Independence, in which Irish revolutionaries had overthrown the British imperial regime. After completing six years of elementary education, in 1941 Mugabe was offered a place on a teacher training course at Kutama College. Mugabe's mother could not afford the tuition fees, which were paid in part by his grandfather and in part by O'Hea. As part of this education, Mugabe began teaching at his old school, earning ¬£2 per month, which he used to support his family. In 1944, Gabriel returned to Kutama with his three new children, but died shortly after, leaving Robert to take financial responsibility for both his three siblings and three half-siblings. Having attained a teaching diploma, Mugabe left Kutama in 1945. = University education and teaching career: 1945‚Äì1960= During the following years, Mugabe taught at various schools around Southern Rhodesia, among them the Dadaya Mission school in Shabani. There is no evidence that Mugabe was involved in political activity at the time, and he did not participate in the country's 1948 general strike. In 1949 he won a scholarship to study at the University of Fort Hare in South Africa's Eastern Cape. There he joined the African National Congress youth league (ANCYL) and attended African nationalist meetings, where he met a number of Jewish South African communists who introduced him to Marxist ideas. He later related that despite this exposure to Marxism, his biggest influence at the time were the actions of Mahatma Gandhi during the Indian independence movement. In 1952, he left the university with a Bachelor of Arts degree in history and English literature. In later years he described his time at Fort Hare as the \\"turning point\\" in his life. Mugabe was inspired by the example set by Ghana's Kwame Nkrumah. Mugabe returned to Southern Rhodesia in 1952, by which time‚Äîhe later related‚Äî he was \\"completely hostile to the [colonialist] system\\". Here, his first job was as a teacher at the Driefontein Roman Catholic Mission School near Umvuma. In 1953 he relocated to the Highfield Government School in Salisbury's Harari township and in 1954 to the Mambo Township Government School in Gwelo. Meanwhile, he gained a Bachelor of Education degree by correspondence from the University of South Africa, and ordered a number of Marxist tracts‚Äîamong them Karl Marx's Capital and Friedrich Engels' The Condition of the Working Class in England‚Äîfrom a London mail-order company. Despite his growing interest in politics, he was not active in any political movement. He joined a number of inter-racial groups, such as the Capricorn Africa Society, through which he mixed with both black and white Rhodesians. Guy Clutton-Brock, who knew Mugabe through this group, later noted that he was \\"an extraordinary young man\\" who could be \\"a bit of a cold fish at times\\" but \\"could talk about Elvis Presley or Bing Crosby as easily as politics\\". From 1955 to 1958, Mugabe lived in neighbouring Northern Rhodesia, where he worked at Chalimbana Teacher Training College in Lusaka. There he continued his education by working on a second degree by correspondence, this time a Bachelor of Administration from the University of London International Programmes through distance and learning. In Northern Rhodesia, he was taken in for a time by the family of Emmerson Mnangagwa, whom Mugabe inspired to join the liberation movement and who would later go on to be President of Zimbabwe. In 1958, Mugabe moved to Ghana to work at St Mary's Teacher Training College in Takoradi. He taught at Apowa Secondary School, also at Takoradi, after obtaining his local certification at Achimota College (1958‚Äì1960), where he met his first wife, Sally Hayfron. According to Mugabe, \\"I went [to Ghana] as an adventurist. I wanted to see what it would be like in an independent African state\\". Ghana had been the first African state to gain independence from European colonial powers and under the leadership of Kwame Nkrumah underwent a range of African nationalist reforms; Mugabe revelled in this environment. In tandem with his teaching, Mugabe attended the Kwame Nkrumah Ideological Institute in Winneba. Mugabe later claimed that it was in Ghana that he finally embraced Marxism. He also began a relationship there with Hayfron who worked at the college and shared his political interests. Revolutionary activity =Early political career: 1960‚Äì1963= While Mugabe was teaching abroad, an anti-colonialist African nationalist movement was established in Southern Rhodesia. It was first led by Joshua Nkomo's Southern Rhodesia African National Congress, founded in September 1957 and then banned by the colonial government in February 1959. SRANC was replaced by the more radically oriented National Democratic Party (NDP), founded in January 1960. In May 1960, Mugabe returned to Southern Rhodesia, bringing Hayfron with him. The pair had planned for their visit to be short, however Mugabe's friend, the African nationalist Leopold Takawira, urged them to stay. Nkomo became one of the leading figures of resistance to white minority rule in Southern Rhodesia. In July 1960, Takawira and two other NDP officials were arrested; in protest, Mugabe joined a demonstration of 7,000 people who planned to march from Highfield to the Prime Minister's office in Salisbury. The demonstration was stopped by riot police outside Stoddart Hall in Harare township. By midday the next day, the crowd had grown to 40,000 and a makeshift platform had been erected for speakers. Having become a much- respected figure through his profession, his possession of three degrees, and his travels abroad, Mugabe was among those invited to speak to the crowd. Following this event, Mugabe decided to devote himself full-time to activism, resigning his teaching post in Ghana (after having served two years of the four-year teaching contract). He chaired the first NDP congress, held in October 1960, assisted by Chitepo on the procedural aspects. Mugabe was elected the party's publicity secretary. Mugabe consciously injected emotionalism into the NDP's African nationalism, hoping to broaden its support among the wider population by appealing to traditional cultural values. He helped to form the NDP Youth Wing and encouraged the incorporation of ancestral prayers, traditional costume, and female ululation into its meetings. In February 1961 he married Hayfron in a Roman Catholic ceremony conducted in Salisbury; she had converted to Catholicism to make this possible. The British government held a Salisbury conference in 1961 to determine Southern Rhodesia's future. Nkomo led an NDP delegation, which hoped that the British would support the creation of an independent state governed by the black majority. Representatives of the country's white minority‚Äîwho then controlled Southern Rhodesia's government‚Äîwere opposed to this, promoting continued white minority rule. Following negotiations, Nkomo agreed to a proposal which would allow the black population representation through 15 of the 65 seats in the country's parliament. Mugabe and others in the NDP were furious at Nkomo's compromise. Following the conference, Southern Rhodesia's African nationalist movement fell into disarray. Mugabe spoke at a number of NDP rallies before the party was banned by the government in December 1961. Many of its members re-grouped as the Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU) several days later, with Mugabe appointed as ZAPU's publicity secretary and general secretary. Racial violence was growing in the country, with aggrieved black Africans targeting the white community. Mugabe deemed such conflict a necessary tactic in the overthrow of British colonial dominance and white minority rule. This contrasted with Nkomo's view that African nationalists should focus on international diplomacy to encourage the British government to grant their demands. Nine months after it had been founded, ZAPU was also banned by the government, and in September 1962 Mugabe and other senior party officials were arrested and restricted to their home districts for three months. Both Mugabe and his wife were in trouble with the law; he had been charged with making subversive statements in a public speech and awarded bail before his trial. Hayfron had been sentenced to two years imprisonment‚Äîsuspended for 15 months‚Äîfor a speech in which she declared that the British Queen Elizabeth II \\"can go to hell\\". The rise of African nationalism generated a white backlash in Southern Rhodesia, with the right- wing Rhodesian Front winning the December 1962 general election. The new government sought to preserve white minority rule by tightening security and establishing full independence from the United Kingdom. Mugabe met with colleagues at his house in Salisbury's Highbury district, where he argued that as political demonstrations were simply being banned, it was time to move towards armed resistance. Both he and others rejected Nkomo's proposal that they establish a government-in-exile in Dar es Salaam. He and Hayfron skipped bail to attend a ZAPU meeting in the Tanganyikan city. There, the party leadership met Tanganyika's President, Julius Nyerere, who also dismissed the idea of a government-in-exile and urged ZAPU to organise their resistance to white minority rule within Southern Rhodesia itself. In August, Hayfron gave birth to Mugabe's son, whom they named Nhamodzenyika, a Shona term meaning \\"suffering country\\". Mugabe insisted that she take their son back to Ghana, while he decided to return to Southern Rhodesia. There, African nationalists opposed to Nkomo's leadership had established a new party, the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU), in August; Ndabaningi Sithole became the group's president, while appointing Mugabe to be the group's secretary-general in absentia. Nkomo responded by forming his own group, the People's Caretaker Council, which was widely referred to as \\"ZAPU\\" after its predecessor. ZAPU and ZANU violently opposed one another and soon gang warfare broke out between their rival memberships. =Imprisonment: 1963‚Äì1975= Mugabe was arrested on his return to Southern Rhodesia in December 1963. His trial lasted from January to March 1964, during which he refused to retract the subversive statements that he had publicly made. In March 1964 he was sentenced to 21 months imprisonment. Mugabe was first imprisoned at Salisbury Maximum Security Prison, before being moved to the Wha Wha detention centre and then the Sikombela detention centre in Que Que. At the latter, he organised study classes for the inmates, teaching them basic literacy, maths, and English. Sympathetic black warders smuggled messages from Mugabe and other members of the ZANU executive committee to activists outside the prison. At the executive's bidding, ZANU activist Herbert Chitepo had organised a small guerrilla force in Lusaka. In April 1966 the group carried out a failed attempt to destroy power pylons at Sinoia, and shortly after attacked a white- owned farm near Hartley, killing its inhabitants. The government responded by returning the members of the ZANU executive, including Mugabe, to Salisbury Prison in 1966. There, forty prisoners were divided among four communal cells, with many sleeping on the concrete floor due to overcrowding; Mugabe shared his cell with Sithole, Enos Nkala, and Edgar Tekere. He remained there for eight years, devoting his time to reading and studying. During this period he gained several further degrees from the University of London: a masters in economics, a bachelor of administration, and two law degrees. alt= While imprisoned, Mugabe learned that his son had died of encephalitis at the age of three. Mugabe was grief-stricken and requested a leave of absence to visit his wife in Ghana. He never forgave the prison authorities for refusing this request. Claims have also circulated among those who knew him at the time that Mugabe was subjected to both physical and mental torture during his imprisonment. According to Father Emmanuel Ribeiro, who was Mugabe's priest during his imprisonment, Mugabe got through the experience \\"partly through the strength of his spirituality\\" but also because his \\"real strength was study and helping others to learn\\". While Mugabe was imprisoned, in August 1964, the Rhodesian Front government‚Äînow under the leadership of Ian Smith‚Äîbanned ZANU and ZAPU and arrested all remaining leaders of the country's African nationalist movement. Smith's government made a unilateral declaration of independence from the United Kingdom in November 1965, renaming Southern Rhodesia as Rhodesia; the UK refused to recognise the legitimacy of this and imposed economic sanctions on the country. In 1972, the African nationalists launched a guerrilla war against Smith's government. Among the revolutionaries, it was known as the \\"Second Chimurenga\\". Paramilitary groups based themselves in neighbouring Tanzania and Zambia; many of their fighters were inadequately armed and trained. ZANU's military wing, the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA), consisted largely of Shona. It was based in neighbouring Mozambique and gained funds from the People's Republic of China. ZAPU's military wing, the Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA), was instead funded by the Soviet Union, was based in Zambia, and consisted largely of Ndebele. Mugabe and other senior ZANU members had growing doubts about Sithole's leadership, deeming him increasingly irritable and irrational. In October 1968 Sithole had tried to smuggle a message out of the prison commanding ZANU activists to assassinate Smith. His plan was discovered and he was put on trial in January 1969; desperate to avoid a death sentence, he declared that he renounced violence and his previous ideological commitments. Mugabe denounced Sithole's \\"treachery\\" in rejecting ZANU's cause, and the executive removed him as ZANU President in a vote of no confidence, selecting Mugabe as his successor. In November 1974, the ZANU executive voted to suspend Sithole's membership of the organisation. Fearing that the guerrilla war would spread south, the South African government pressured Rhodesia to advance the process of d√©tente with the politically moderate black governments of Zambia and Tanzania. As part of these negotiations, Smith's government agreed to release a number of black revolutionaries who had been indefinitely detained. After almost eleven years of imprisonment, Mugabe was released in November 1974. He moved in with his sister Sabina at her home in Highfield township. He was intent on joining the ZANU forces and taking part in the guerrilla war, recognising that to secure dominance of ZANU he would have to take command of ZANLA. This was complicated by internal violence within the paramilitary group, predominately between members of the Manyika and Karange groups of Shona. =Guerrilla war: 1975‚Äì1979= The flag of the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) In March 1975, Mugabe resolved to leave Rhodesia for Mozambique, ambitious to take control of ZANU's guerrilla campaign. After his friend Maurice Nyagumbo was arrested, he feared the same fate but was hidden from the authorities by Ribeiro. Ribeiro and a sympathetic nun then assisted him and Edgar Tekere in smuggling themselves into Mozambique. Mugabe remained in exile there for two years. Mozambique's Marxist President Samora Machel was sceptical of Mugabe's leadership abilities and was unsure whether to recognise him as ZANU's legitimate leader. Machel gave him a house in Quelimane and kept him under partial house arrest, with Mugabe requiring permission to travel. It would be almost a year before Machel accepted Mugabe's leadership of ZANU. Mugabe travelled to various ZANLA camps in Mozambique to build support among its officers. By mid-1976, he had secured the allegiance of ZANLA's military commanders and established himself as the most prominent guerrilla leader battling Smith's regime. In August 1977, he was officially declared ZANU President at a meeting of the party's central committee held in Chimoio. During the war, Mugabe remained suspicious of many of ZANLA's commanders and had a number of them imprisoned. In 1977 he imprisoned his former second-in-command, Wilfred Mhanda, for suspected disloyalty. After Josiah Tongogara was killed in a car accident in 1979, there were suggestions made that Mugabe may have had some involvement in it; these rumours were never substantiated. Mugabe remained aloof from the day-to-day military operations of ZANLA, which he entrusted to Tongogara. In January 1976, ZANLA launched its first major infiltration from Mozambique, with nearly 1000 guerrillas crossing the border to attack white-owned farms and stores. In response, Smith's government enlisted all men under the age of 35, expanding the Rhodesian army by 50%. ZANLA's attacks forced large numbers of white landowners to abandon their farms; their now-unemployed black workers joined ZANLA by the thousands. By 1979, ZANLA were in a position to attack a number of Rhodesian cities. Over the course of the war, at least 30,000 people were killed. As a proportion of their wider population, the whites had higher number of fatalities, and by the latter part of the decade the guerrillas were winning. Mugabe in a meeting with Romanian communist leader Nicolae Ceau»ôescu in 1979 Mugabe focused on the propaganda war, making regular speeches and radio broadcasts. In these, he presented himself as a Marxist-Leninist, speaking warmly of Marxist-Leninist revolutionaries like Vladimir Lenin, Joseph Stalin, and Fidel Castro. Despite his Marxist views, Mugabe's meetings with Soviet representatives were unproductive, for they insisted on Nkomo's leadership of the revolutionary struggle. His relationship with the People's Republic of China was far warmer, as the Chinese Marxist government supplied ZANLA with armaments without any conditions. He also sought support from Western nations, visiting Western embassies in Mozambique, and travelled to both Western states like Italy and Switzerland and Marxist-governed states like the Soviet Union, China, North Korea, Vietnam, and Cuba. Mugabe called for the overthrow of Rhodesia's predominately white government, the execution of Smith and his \\"criminal gang\\", the expropriation of white-owned land, and the transformation of Rhodesia into a one-party Marxist state. He repeatedly called for violence against the country's white minority, referring to white Rhodesians as \\"blood-sucking exploiters\\", \\"sadistic killers\\", and \\"hard-core racists\\". In one typical example, taken from a 1978 radio address, Mugabe declared: \\"Let us hammer [the white man] to defeat. Let us blow up his citadel. Let us give him no time to rest. Let us chase him in every corner. Let us rid our home of this settler vermin\\". For Mugabe, armed struggle was an essential part of the establishment of a new state. In contrast to other black nationalist leaders like Nkomo, Mugabe opposed a negotiated settlement with Smith's government. In October 1976 ZANU nevertheless established a joint- platform with ZAPU known as the Patriotic Front. In September 1978 Mugabe met with Nkomo in Lusaka. He was angry with the latter's secret attempts to negotiate with Smith. = Lancaster House Agreement: 1979 = Under pressure from South African Prime Minister B. J. Vorster, Smith accepted in principle that white minority rule could not be prolonged indefinitely. He oversaw the 1979 general election which resulted in Abel Muzorewa, a politically moderate black bishop, being elected Prime Minister of the reconstituted Zimbabwe Rhodesia. Both ZANU and ZAPU had boycotted the election, which did not receive international recognition. At the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 1979, held in Lusaka, the British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher surprised delegates by announcing that the UK would officially recognise the country's independence if it transitioned to democratic majority rule. Lancaster House in London's St James's district The negotiations took place at Lancaster House in London and were led by the Conservative Party politician Peter Carington. Mugabe refused to attend these London peace talks, opposing the idea of a negotiated rather than military solution to the Rhodesian War. Machel insisted that he must, threatening to end Mozambican support for the ZANU-PF if he did not. Mugabe arrived in London in September 1979. There, he and Nkomo presented themselves as part of the \\"Patriotic Front\\" but established separate headquarters in the city. At the conference the pair were divided in their attitude; Nkomo wanted to present himself as a moderate while Mugabe played up to his image as a Marxist revolutionary, with Carington exploiting this division. Throughout the negotiations, Mugabe did not trust the British and believed that they were manipulating events to their own advantage. The ensuing Lancaster House Agreement called for all participants in the Rhodesian Bush War to agree to a ceasefire, with a British governor, Christopher Soames, arriving in Rhodesia to oversee an election in which the various factions could compete as political parties. It outlined a plan for a transition to formal independence as a sovereign republic under black-majority rule, also maintaining that Rhodesia would be renamed Zimbabwe, a name adopted from the Iron Age archaeological site of Great Zimbabwe. The agreement also ensured that the country's white minority retained many of its economic and political privileges, with 20 seats to be reserved for whites in the new Parliament. By insisting on the need for a democratic black majority government, Carington was able to convince Mugabe to compromise on the other main issue of the conference, that of land ownership. Mugabe agreed to the protection of the white community's privately owned property on the condition that the UK and U.S governments provide financial assistance allowing the Zimbabwean government to purchase much land for redistribution among blacks. Mugabe was opposed to the idea of a ceasefire, but under pressure from Machel he agreed to it. Mugabe signed the agreement, but felt cheated, remaining disappointed that he had never achieved a military victory over the Rhodesian forces. =Electoral campaign: 1980= Returning to Salisbury in January 1980, Mugabe was greeted by a supportive crowd. He settled into a house in Mount Pleasant, a wealthy white-dominated suburb. Machel had cautioned Mugabe not to alienate Rhodesia's white minority, warning him that any white flight after the election would cause economic damage as it had in Mozambique. Accordingly, during his electoral campaign, Mugabe avoided the use of Marxist and revolutionary rhetoric. Mugabe insisted that in the election, ZANU would stand as a separate party to ZAPU, and refused Nkomo's request for a meeting. He formed ZANU into a political party, known as Zimbabwe African National Union ‚Äì Patriotic Front (ZANU‚ÄìPF). Predictions were made that ZANU‚ÄìPF would win the election on the basis of the country's ethnic divisions; Mugabe was Shona, a community that made up around 70% of the country's population, while Nkomo was Ndebele, a tribal group who made up only around 20%. For many in the white community and in the British government, this outcome was a terrifying prospect due to Mugabe's avowed Marxist beliefs and the inflammatory comments that he had made about whites during the guerrilla war. Mugabe on a visit to the Netherlands in 1979 During the campaign, Mugabe survived two assassination attempts. In the first, which took place on 6 February, a grenade was thrown at his Mount Pleasant home, where it exploded against a garden wall. In the second, on 10 February, a roadside bomb exploded near his motorcade as he left a Fort Victoria rally. Mugabe himself was unharmed. Mugabe accused the Rhodesian security forces of being responsible for these attacks. In an attempt to quell the possibility that Rhodesia's security forces would launch a coup to prevent the election, Mugabe met with Peter Walls, the commander of Rhodesia's armed forces, and asked him to remain in his position in the event of a ZANU‚ÄìPF victory. At the time Walls refused. The electoral campaign was marred by widespread voter intimidation, perpetrated by Nkomo's ZAPU, Abel Muzorewa's United African National Council (UANC), and Mugabe's ZANU‚ÄìPF. Commenting on ZANU‚ÄìPF's activities in eastern Rhodesia, Nkomo complained that \\"the word intimidation is mild. People are being terrorised. It is terror.\\" Reacting to ZANU‚ÄìPF's acts of voter intimidation, Mugabe was called before Soames at Government House. Mugabe regarded the meeting as a British attempt to thwart his electoral campaign. Under the terms of the negotiation, Soames had the power to disqualify any political party guilty of voter intimidation. Rhodesia's security services, Nkomo, Muzorewa, and some of his own advisers all called on Soames to disqualify ZANU‚ÄìPF. After deliberation, Soames disagreed, believing that ZANU‚ÄìPF were sure to win the election and that disqualifying them would wreck any chance of an orderly transition of power. In the February election, ZANU‚ÄìPF secured 63% of the national vote, gaining 57 of the 80 parliamentary seats allocated for black parties and providing them with an absolute majority. ZAPU had gained 20 seats, and UANC had three. Mugabe was elected MP for the Salisbury constituency of Highfield. Attempting to calm panic and prevent white flight, Mugabe appeared on television and called for national unity, stability, and law and order, insisting that the pensions of white civil servants would be guaranteed and that private property would be protected.  Prime Minister of Zimbabwe: 1980‚Äì1987  Statues atop the tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Heroes' Acre; the monument was designed by North Korean architects who reported directly to Mugabe Mugabe took his oath of office shortly after midnight on 18 April 1980. He gave a speech at Salisbury's Rufaro Stadium announcing that Rhodesia would be renamed \\"Zimbabwe\\" and pledged racial reconciliation. Soames aided Mugabe in bringing about an orderly transition of power; for this Mugabe remained grateful, describing Soames as a good friend. Mugabe unsuccessfully urged Soames to remain in Zimbabwe for several more years, and also failed to convince the UK to assume a two-year \\"guiding role\\" for his government because most ZANU‚ÄìPF members lacked experience in governing. ZANU‚ÄìPF's absolute parliamentary majority allowed them to rule alone, but Mugabe created a government of national unity by inviting members of rival parties to join his cabinet. Mugabe moved into the Premier's residence in Salisbury, which he left furnished in the same style as Smith had left it. Across the country, statues of Cecil Rhodes were removed and squares and roads named after prominent colonial figures were renamed after black nationalists. In 1982 Salisbury was renamed Harare. Mugabe employed North Korean architects to design Heroes' Acre, a monument and complex in western Harare to commemorate the struggle against minority rule. Zimbabwe also received much aid from Western countries, whose governments hoped that a stable and prosperous Zimbabwe would aid the transition of South Africa away from apartheid and minority rule. The United States provided Zimbabwe with a $25 million three-year aid package. The UK financed a land reform program, and provided military advisers to aid the integration of the guerrilla armies and old Rhodesian security forces into a new Zimbabwean military. Members of both ZANLA and ZIPRA were integrated into the army; though, there remained a strong rivalry between the two groups. As Prime Minister, Mugabe retained Walls as the head of the armed forces. Mugabe's government continued to make regular pronouncements about converting Zimbabwe into a socialist society, but did not take concrete steps in that direction. In contrast to Mugabe's talk of socialism, his government's budgetary policies were conservative, operating within a capitalist framework and emphasising the need for foreign investment. In office, Mugabe sought a gradual transformation away from capitalism and tried to build upon existing state institutions. From 1980 to 1990, the country's economy grew by an average of 2.7% a year, but this was outstripped by population growth and real income declined. The unemployment rate rose, reaching 26% in 1990. The government ran a budget deficit year-on-year that averaged at 10% of the country's gross domestic product. Under Mugabe's leadership, there was a massive expansion in education and health spending. In 1980, Zimbabwe had just 177 secondary schools, by 2000 this number had risen to 1,548. During that period, the adult literacy rate rose from 62% to 82%, one of the best records in Africa. Levels of child immunisation were raised from 25% of the population to 92%. A new leadership elite were formed, who often expressed their newfound status through purchasing large houses and expensive cars, sending their children to private schools, and obtaining farms and businesses. To contain their excesses, in 1984 Mugabe drew up a \\"leadership code\\" which prohibited any senior figures from obtaining more than one salary or owning over 50-acres of agricultural land. There were exceptions, with Mugabe giving permission to General Solomon Mujuru to expand his business empire, resulting in him becoming one of the Zimbabwe's wealthiest people. Growing corruption among the socio-economic elite generated resentment among the wider population, much of which was living in poverty. Andrews Air Force Base after a state visit to the United States in 1983 ZANU‚ÄìPF also began establishing its own business empire, founding the M&S; Syndicate in 1980 and the Zidoo Holdings in 1981. By 1992, the party had fixed assets and businesses worth an estimated Z$500 million (US$75 million). In 1980, ZANU‚ÄìPF used Nigerian funds to set up the Mass Media Trust, through which they bought out a South African company that owned most of Zimbabwe's newspapers. The white editors of these newspapers were sacked and replaced by government appointees. These media outlets subsequently became a source of the party's propaganda. At independence, 39% of Zimbabwe's land was under the ownership of around 6000 white large-scale commercial farmers, while 4% was owned by black small-scale commercial farmers, and 41% was 'communal land' where 4 million people lived, often in overcrowded conditions. The Lancaster House agreement ensured that until 1990, the sale of land could only take place on a \\"willing seller-willing buyer\\" basis. The only permitted exceptions were if the land was \\"underutilised\\" or needed for a public purpose, in which case the government could compulsorily purchase it while fully compensating the owner. This meant that Mugabe's government was largely restricted to purchasing land which was of poor quality. Its target was to resettle 18,000 black families on 2.5 million acres of white-owned land over three years. This would cost ¬£30 million (US$60 million), half of which was to be provided by the UK government as per the Lancaster House Agreement. In 1986, Mugabe became chair of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), a position that he retained until 1989. As the leader of one of the Front Line States, the countries bordering apartheid South Africa, he gained credibility within the anti-apartheid movement. =Race relations= Mugabe initially emphasised racial reconciliation and he was keen to build a good relationship with white Zimbabweans. He hoped to avoid a white exodus and tried to allay fears that he would nationalise white-owned property. He appointed two white ministers‚ÄîDavid Smith and Denis Norman‚Äîto his government, met with white leaders in agriculture, industry, mining, and commerce, and impressed senior figures in the outgoing administration like Smith and Ken Flower with his apparent sincerity. With the end of the war, petrol rationing, and economic sanctions, life for white Zimbabweans improved during the early years of Mugabe's rule. In the economic boom that followed, the white minority‚Äîwhich controlled considerable property and dominated commerce, industry, and banking‚Äîwere the country's main beneficiaries. Nevertheless, many white Zimbabweans complained that they were the victims of racial discrimination. Many whites remained uneasy about living under the government of a black Marxist and they also feared that their children would be unable to secure jobs. There was a growing exodus to South Africa, and in 1980, 17,000 whites‚Äîapproximately a tenth of the white Zimbabwean population‚Äîemigrated. Mugabe's government had pledged support for the African National Congress and other anti-apartheid forces within South Africa, but did not allow them to use Zimbabwe as a base for their military operations. To protest apartheid and white minority rule in South Africa, Mugabe's government banned Zimbabwe from engaging South Africa in any sporting competitions. In turn, South Africa tried to destabilise Zimbabwe by blocking trade routes into the country and supporting anti-Mugabe militants among the country's white minority. Mugabe in the Netherlands, 1982 In December 1981, a bomb struck ZANU‚ÄìPF headquarters, killing seven and injuring 124. Mugabe blamed South African-backed white militants. He criticised \\"reactionary and counter-revolutionary elements\\" in the white community, stating that despite the fact that they had faced no punishment for their past actions, they rejected racial reconciliation and \\"are acting in collusion with South Africa to harm our racial relations, to destroy our unity, to sabotage our economy, and to overthrow the popularly elected government I lead\\". Increasingly he criticised not only the militants but the entire white community for holding a monopoly on \\"Zimbabwe's economic power\\". This was a view echoed by many government ministers and the government-controlled media. One of these ministers, Tekere, was involved in an incident in which he and seven armed men stormed a white-owned farmhouse, killing an elderly farmer; they alleged that in doing so they were foiling a coup attempt. Tekere was acquitted of murder; however, Mugabe dropped him from his cabinet. Racial mistrust and suspicion continued to grow. In December 1981, the elderly white MP Wally Stuttaford was accused of being a South African agent, arrested, and tortured, generating anger among whites. In July 1982, South African-backed white militants destroyed 13 aircraft at Thornhill. A number of white military officers were accused of complicity, arrested, and tortured. They were put on trial but cleared by judges, after which they were immediately re-arrested. Their case generated an international outcry, which Mugabe criticised, stating that the case only gained such attention because the accused were white. His defence of torture and contempt for legal procedures damaged his international standing. White flight continued to grow, and within three years of Mugabe's premiership half of all white Zimbabweans had emigrated. In the 1985 election, Smith's Conservative Alliance of Zimbabwe won 15 of the 20 seats allocated for white Zimbabweans. Mugabe was outraged by this result, lambasting white Zimbabweans for not repenting \\"in any way\\" by continuing to support Smith and other white politicians who had committed \\"horrors against the people of Zimbabwe\\". =Relations with ZAPU and the Gukurahundi = The flag of ZAPU, which was largely eliminated by ZANU-PF in the Gukurahundi Under the new constitution, Zimbabwe's Presidency was a ceremonial role with no governmental power; the first President was Canaan Banana. Mugabe had previously offered the position to Nkomo, who had turned it down in favour of becoming Minister of Home Affairs. While working together, there remained an aura of resentment and suspicion between Mugabe and Nkomo. Mugabe gave ZAPU four cabinet seats, but Nkomo demanded more. In contrast, some ZANU‚ÄìPF figures argued that ZAPU should not have any seats in government, suggesting that Zimbabwe be converted into a one-party state. Tekere and Enos Nkala were particularly adamant that there should be a crackdown on ZAPU. After Nkala called for ZAPU to be violently crushed during a rally in Entumbane, street clashes between the two parties broke out in the city. In January 1981, Mugabe demoted Nkomo in a cabinet reshuffle; the latter warned that this would anger ZAPU supporters. In February, violence between ZAPU and ZANU‚ÄìPF supporters broke out among the battalion stationed at Ntabazinduna, soon spreading to other army bases, resulting in 300 deaths. An arms cache featuring land mines and anti-aircraft missiles were then discovered at Ascot Farm, which was part-owned by Nkomo. Mugabe cited this as evidence that ZAPU were plotting a coup, an allegation that Nkomo denied. Likening Nkomo to \\"a cobra in the house\\", Mugabe sacked him from the government, and ZAPU-owned businesses, farms, and properties were seized. Members of both ZANLA and ZIPRA had deserted their positions and engaged in banditry. In Matabeleland, ZIPRA deserters who came to be known as \\"dissenters\\" engaged in robbery, holding up buses, and attacking farm houses, creating an environment of growing lawlessness. These dissidents received support from South Africa through its Operation Mute, by which it hoped to further destabilise Zimbabwe. The government often conflated ZIPRA with the dissenters, although Nkomo denounced the dissidents and their South African supporters. Mugabe authorised the police and army to crack down on the Matabeleland dissenters, declaring that state officers would be granted legal immunity for any \\"extra-legal\\" actions they may perform while doing so. During 1982 he had established the Fifth Brigade, an elite armed force trained by the North Koreans; membership was drawn largely from Shona-speaking ZANLA soldiers and were answerable directly to Mugabe. In January 1983, the Fifth Brigade were deployed in the region, overseeing a campaign of beatings, arson, public executions, and massacres of those accused of being sympathetic to the dissidents. The scale of the violence was greater than that witnessed in the Rhodesian War. Interrogation centres were established where people were tortured. Mugabe acknowledged that civilians would be persecuted in the violence, claiming that \\"we can't tell who is a dissident and who is not\\". The ensuing events became known as the \\"Gukurahundi\\", a Shona word meaning \\"wind that sweeps away the chaff before the rains\\". The Gukurahundi took place in Zimbabwe's western provinces of Matabeleland (pictured) In 1984 the Gukurahundi spread to Matabeleland South, an area then in its third year of drought. The Fifth Brigade closed all stores, halted all deliveries, and imposed a curfew, exacerbating starvation for a period of two months. The Bishop of Bulawayo accused Mugabe of overseeing a project of systematic starvation. When a Roman Catholic delegation provided Mugabe with a dossier listing atrocities committed by the Fifth Brigade, Mugabe refuted all its allegations and accused the clergy of being disloyal to Zimbabwe. He had the Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace in Zimbabwe's suppressed. In 1985, an Amnesty International report on the Gukurahundi was dismissed by Mugabe as \\"a heap of lies\\". Over the course of four years, approximately 10,000 civilians had been killed, and many others had been beaten and tortured. Genocide Watch later estimated that approximately 20,000 had been killed and classified the events as genocide. Margaret Thatcher's UK government was aware of the killings but remained silent on the matter, cautious not to anger Mugabe and threaten the safety of white Zimbabweans. The United States also did not raise strong objections, with President Ronald Reagan welcoming Mugabe to the White House in September 1983. In October 1983, Mugabe attended the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in New Delhi, where no participating states mentioned the Gukurahundi. In 2000, Mugabe acknowledged that the mass killings had happened, stating that it was \\"an act of madness ... it was wrong and both sides were to blame\\". His biographer Martin Meredith argued that Mugabe and his ZANU‚ÄìPF were solely to blame for the massacres. Various Mugabe biographers have seen the Gukurahundi as a deliberate attempt to eliminate ZAPU and its support base to advance his desire for a ZANU‚ÄìPF one-party state. There was further violence in the build- up to the 1985 election, with ZAPU supporters facing harassment from ZANU‚ÄìPF Youth League brigades. Despite this intimidation, ZAPU won all 15 of the parliamentary seats in Matabeleland. Mugabe then appointed Enos Nkala as the new police minister. Nkala subsequently detained over 100 ZAPU officials, including five of its MPs and the Mayor of Bulawayo, banned the party from holding rallies or meetings, closed all of their offices, and dissolved all of the district councils that they controlled. To avoid further violence, in December 1987 Nkomo signed a Unity Accord in which ZAPU was officially disbanded and its leadership merged into ZANU‚ÄìPF. The merger between the two parties left ZANU‚ÄìPF with 99 of the 100 seats in parliament, and established Zimbabwe as a de facto one-party state. President of Zimbabwe =Constitutional and economic reform: 1987‚Äì1995= Prime Minister Mugabe in 1982 In late 1987, Zimbabwe's parliament amended the constitution. On 30 December it declared Mugabe to be executive President, a new position that combined the roles of head of state, head of government, and commander-in- chief of the armed forces. This position gave him the power to dissolve parliament, declare martial law, and run for an unlimited number of terms. According to Meredith, Mugabe now had \\"a virtual stranglehold on government machinery and unlimited opportunities to exercise patronage\\". The constitutional amendments also abolished the twenty parliamentary seats reserved for white representatives, and left parliament less relevant and independent. In the build-up to the 1990 election, parliamentary reforms increased the number of seats to 120; of these, twenty were to be appointed by the President and ten by the Council of Chiefs. This measure made it more difficult for any opposition to Mugabe to gain a parliamentary majority. The main opposition party in that election were the Zimbabwe Unity Movement (ZUM), launched in April 1989 by Tekere; although a longstanding friend of Mugabe, Tekere accused him of betraying the revolution and establishing a dictatorship. ZANU‚ÄìPF propaganda made threats against those considering voting ZUM in the election; one television advert featured images of a car crash with the statement \\"This is one way to die. Another is to vote ZUM. Don't commit suicide, vote ZANU-PF and live.\\" In the election, Mugabe was re-elected President with nearly 80% of the vote, while ZANU‚ÄìPF secured 116 of the 119 available parliamentary seats. Mugabe had long hoped to convert Zimbabwe into a one-party state, but in 1990 he officially \\"postponed\\" these plans as both Mozambique and many Eastern Bloc states transitioned from one-party states to multi-party republics. Following the collapse of the Marxist-Leninist regimes in the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc, in 1991 ZANU‚ÄìPF removed references to \\"Marxism-Leninism\\" and \\"scientific socialism\\" in its material; Mugabe maintained that \\"socialism remains our sworn ideology\\". That year, Mugabe pledged himself to free market economics and accepted a structural adjustment programme provided by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). This economic reform package called for Zimbabwe to privatise state assets and reduce import tariffs; Mugabe's government implemented some but not all of its recommendations. The reforms encouraged employers to cut their wages, generating growing opposition from the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions. Mugabe was in attendance at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Conference in New Delhi, 1983. By 1990, 52,000 black families had been settled on 6.5 million acres. This was insufficient to deal with the country's overcrowding problem, which was being exacerbated by the growth in the black population. That year, Zimbabwe's parliament passed an amendment allowing the government to expropriate land at a fixed price while denying land-owners the right of appeal to the courts. The government hoped that by doing so it could settle 110,000 black families on 13 million acres, which would require the expropriation of approximately half of all white-owned land. Zimbabwe's Commercial Farmers Union argued that the proposed measures would wreck the country's economy, urging the government to instead settle landless blacks on the half-a-million acres of land that was either unproductive or state-owned. Concerns about the proposed measure‚Äîparticularly its denial of the right to appeal‚Äîwere voiced by the UK, US, and Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace. The US, UK, International Monetary Fund, and World Bank threatened that if Zimbabwe implemented the law, it would forfeit foreign aid packages. Responding to the criticisms, the government removed the ban on court appeals from the bill, which was then passed as law. Over the following few years, hundreds of thousands of acres of largely white-owned land were expropriated. In April 1994, a newspaper investigation found that not all of this was redistributed to landless blacks; much of the expropriated land was being leased to ministers and senior officials such as Witness Mangwede, who was leased a 3000-acre farm in Hwedza. Responding to this scandal, in 1994 the UK government‚Äîwhich had supplied ¬£44 million for land redistribution‚Äîhalted its payments. In January 1992, Mugabe's wife died. In April 1995, Horizon magazine revealed that Mugabe had secretly been having an affair with his secretary Grace Marufu since 1987 and that she had borne him a son and a daughter. His secret revealed, Mugabe decided to hold a much-publicised wedding. 12,000 people were invited to the August 1996 ceremony, which took place in Kutama and was orchestrated by the head of the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Harare, Patrick Chakaipa. The ceremony was controversial among the Catholic community because of the adulterous nature of Mugabe and Marufu's relationship. To house his family, Mugabe then built a new mansion at Borrowdale. In the 1995 parliamentary election‚Äîwhich saw a low turnout of 31.7%‚ÄîZANU‚ÄìPF gained 147 out of 150 seats. Following the election, Mugabe expanded his cabinet from 29 to 42 ministers while the government adopted a 133% pay rise for MPs. =Economic decline: 1995‚Äì2000= Over the course of the 1990s, Zimbabwe's economy steadily deteriorated. By 2000, living standards had declined from 1980; life expectancy was reduced, average wages were lower, and unemployment had trebled. By 1998, unemployment was almost at 50%. As of 2009, three to four million Zimbabweans‚Äîthe greater part of the nation's skilled workforce‚Äîhad left the country. In 1997 there were growing demands for pensions from those who had fought for the guerrilla armies in the revolutionary war, and in August 1997 Mugabe put together a pension package that would cost the county Z$4.2 billion. To finance this pension scheme, Mugabe's government proposed new taxes, but a general strike was called in protest in December 1997; amid protest from ZANU‚ÄìPF itself, Mugabe's government abandoned the taxes. In January 1998, riots about lack of access to food broke out in Harare; the army was deployed to restore order, with at least ten killed and hundreds injured. Mugabe increasingly blamed the country's economic problems on Western nations and the white Zimbabwean minority, who still controlled most of its commercial agriculture, mines, and manufacturing industry. He called on supporters \\"to strike fear in the hearts of the white man, our real enemy\\", and accused his black opponents of being dupes of the whites. Amid growing internal opposition to his government, he remained determined to stay in power. He revived the regular use of revolutionary rhetoric and sought to reassert his credentials as an important revolutionary leader. Mugabe also developed a growing preoccupation with homosexuality, lambasting it as an \\"un-African\\" import from Europe. He described gay people as being \\"guilty of sub-human behaviour\\", and of being \\"worse than dogs and pigs\\". This attitude may have stemmed in part from his strong conservative values, but it was strengthened by the fact that several ministers in the British government were gay. Mugabe began to believe that there was a \\"gay mafia\\" and that all of his critics were homosexuals. Critics also accused Mugabe of using homophobia to distract attention from the country's problems. In August 1995, he was due to open a human rights-themed Zimbabwe International Book Fair in Harare but refused to do so until a stall run by the group Gays and Lesbians of Zimbabwe was evicted. In 1996, Mugabe was appointed chair of the defence arm of the Southern African Development Community (SADC). Without consulting parliament, in August 1998 he ordered Zimbabwean troops into the Democratic Republic of the Congo to side with President Laurent Kabila in the Second Congo War. He initially committed 3000 troops to the operation; this gradually rose to 11,000. He also persuaded Angola and Namibia to commit troops to the conflict. Involvement in the war cost Zimbabwe an approximate US$1 million a day, contributing to its economic problems. Opinion polls demonstrated that it was unpopular among Zimbabwe's population. However, several Zimbabwean businesses profited, having been given mining and timber concessions and preferential trade terms in minerals from Kabila's government. British Prime Minister Tony Blair, with whom Mugabe had a particularly antagonistic relationship In January 1999, 23 military officers were arrested for plotting a coup against Mugabe. The government sought to hide this, but it was reported by journalists from The Standard. The military subsequently illegally arrested the journalists and tortured them. This brought international condemnation, with the EU and seven donor nations issuing protest notes. Lawyers and human rights activists protested outside parliament until they were dispersed by riot police, and the country's Supreme Court judges issued a letter condemning the military's actions. In response, Mugabe publicly defended the use of extra-legal arrest and torture. In 1997, Tony Blair was elected Prime Minister of the UK after 18 years of Conservative rule. His Labour government expressed reticence toward restarting the land resettlement payments promised by the Lancaster House Agreement, with minister Clare Short rejecting the idea that the UK had any moral obligation to fund land redistribution. This attitude fuelled anti-imperialist sentiment across Africa. In October 1999, Mugabe visited Britain and in London, the human rights activist Peter Tatchell attempted to place him under citizen's arrest. Mugabe believed that the British government had deliberately engineered the incident to embarrass him. It further damaged Anglo-Zimbabwean relations, with Mugabe expressing scorn for what he called \\"Blair and company\\". In May 2000, the UK froze all development aid to Zimbabwe. In December 1999, the IMF terminated financial support for Zimbabwe, citing economic mismanagement and widespread corruption as impediments to reform. To meet growing demand for constitutional reform, in April 1999 Mugabe's government appointed a 400-member Constitutional Commission to draft a new constitution which could be put to a referendum. The National Constitutional Assembly‚Äîa pro-reform pressure group established in 1997‚Äîexpressed concern that this commission was not independent of the government, noting that Mugabe had the power to amend or reject the draft. The NCA called for the draft constitution to be rejected, and in a February 2000 referendum it was, with 53% against to 44% in favour; turnout was under 25%. It was ZANU‚ÄìPF's first major electoral defeat in twenty years. Mugabe was furious, and blamed the white minority for orchestrating his defeat, referring to them as \\"enemies of Zimbabwe\\". =Land seizures and growing condemnation: 2000‚Äì2008= Morgan Tsvangirai led the MDC to growing success in opposing Mugabe's regime in the 2000 parliamentary election. The June 2000 parliamentary elections were Zimbabwe's most important since 1980. Sixteen parties took part, and the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC)‚Äîled by trade unionist Morgan Tsvangirai‚Äîwas particularly successful. During the election campaign, MDC activists were regularly harassed and in some cases killed. The Zimbabwe Human Rights Forum documented 27 murders, 27 rapes, 2466 assaults, and 617 abductions, with 10,000 people displaced by violence; the majority, but not all, of these actions were carried out by ZANU‚ÄìPF supporters. Observers from the European Union (EU) ruled that the election was neither free nor fair. The vote produced 48% and 62 parliamentary seats for ZANU-PF and 47% and 57 parliamentary seats for the MDC. For the first time, ZANU‚ÄìPF were denied the two-thirds parliamentary majority required to push through constitutional change. ZANU‚ÄìPF had relied heavily on their support base in rural Shona-speaking areas, and retained only one urban constituency. In February 2000, land invasions began as armed gangs attacked and occupied white-owned farms. The government referred to the attackers as \\"war veterans\\" but the majority were unemployed youth too young to have fought in the Rhodesian War. Mugabe claimed that the attacks were a spontaneous uprising against white land owners, although the government had paid Z$20 million to Chenjerai Hunzvi's War Veterans Association to lead the land invasion campaign and ZANU‚ÄìPF officials, police, and military figures were all involved in facilitating it. Some of Mugabe's colleagues described the invasions as retribution for the white community's alleged involvement in securing the success of the 'no' vote in the recent referendum. Mugabe justified the seizures by the fact that this land had been seized by white settlers from the indigenous African population in the 1890s. He portrayed the invasions as a struggle against colonialism and alleged that the UK was trying to overthrow his government. In May 2000, he issued a decree under the Presidential Powers (Temporary Measures) Act which empowered the government to seize farms without providing compensation, insisting that it was the British government that should make these payments. In March 2000, Zimbabwe's High Court ruled that the land invasions were illegal; they nevertheless continued, and Mugabe began vilifying Zimbabwe's judiciary. After the Supreme Court also backed this decision, the government called on its judges to resign, successfully pressuring Chief Justice Anthony Gubbay to do so. ZANU‚ÄìPF member Godfrey Chidyausiku was appointed to replace him, while the number of Supreme Court judges was expanded from five to eight; the three additional seats went to pro-Mugabe figures. The first act of the new Supreme Court was to reverse the previous declaration that the land seizures were illegal. In November 2001, Mugabe issued a presidential decree permitting the expropriation of virtually all white-owned farms in Zimbabwe without compensation. The farm seizures were often violent; by 2006 a reported sixty white farmers had been killed, with many of their employees experiencing intimidation and torture. A large number of the seized farms remained empty, while many of those redistributed to black peasant-farmers were unable to engage in production for the market because of their lack of access to fertiliser. The farm invasions severely impacted agricultural development. Zimbabwe had produced over two million tons of maize in 2000; by 2008 this had declined to approximately 450,000. By October 2003, Human Rights Watch reported that half of the country's population were food insecure, lacking enough food to meet basic needs. By 2009, 75% of Zimbabwe's population were relying on food aid, the highest proportion of any country at that time. Zimbabwe faced continuing economic decline. In 2000, the country's GDP was US$7.4 billion; by 2005 this had declined to US$3.4 billion. Hyperinflation resulted in economic crisis. By 2007, Zimbabwe had the highest inflation rate in the world, at 7600%. By 2008, inflation exceeded 100,000% and a loaf of bread cost a third of the average daily wage. Increasing numbers of Zimbabweans relied on remittances from relatives abroad. Other sectors of society were negatively affected too. By 2005, an estimated 80% of Zimbabwe's population were unemployed, and by 2008 only 20% of children were in schooling. The breakdown of water supplies and sewage systems resulted in a cholera outbreak in late 2008, with over 98,000 cholera cases in Zimbabwe between August 2008 and mid-July 2009. The ruined economy also impacted the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the country; by 2008 the HIV/AIDS rate for individuals aged between 15 and 49 was 15.3%. In 2007, the World Health Organization declared the average life expectancy in Zimbabwe to be 34 for women and 36 for men, down from 63 and 54 respectively in 1997. The country's lucrative tourist industry was decimated, and there was a rise in poaching, including of endangered species. Mugabe directly exacerbated this problem when he ordered the killing of 100 elephants to provide meat for an April 2007 feast. In October 2000, the MDC's MPs attempted to impeach Mugabe, but were thwarted by the Speaker of the House, Mugabe loyalist Emmerson Mnangagwa. ZANU‚ÄìPF increasingly equated itself with Zimbabwean patriotism, with MDC supporters being portrayed as traitors and enemies of Zimbabwe. The party presented itself as being on the progressive side of history, with the MDC representing a counter-revolutionary force that seeks to undermine the achievements of the ZANU‚ÄìPF revolution and of decolonisation itself. Mugabe claimed that the build-up to the 2002 presidential election represented \\"the third Chimurenga\\" and that it would set Zimbabwe free from its colonial heritage. In the build- up to the election, the government changed the electoral rules and regulations to improve Mugabe's chances of victory. New security legislation was introduced making it illegal to criticise the President. The defence force commander, General Vitalis Zvinavashe, stated that the military would not recognise any election result other than a Mugabe victory. The EU withdrew its observers from the country, stating that the vote was neither free nor fair. The election resulted in Mugabe securing 56% of the vote to Tsvangirai's 42%. In the aftermath of the election Mugabe declared that the state-owned Grain Marketing Board had the sole right to import and distribute grain, with the state distributors giving food to ZANU‚ÄìPF supporters while withholding it from those suspected of backing the MDC. In 2005, Mugabe instituted Operation Murambatsvina (\\"Operation Drive Out the Rubbish\\"), a project of forced slum clearance; a UN report estimated that 700,000 were left homeless. Since the inhabitants of the shantytowns overwhelmingly voted MDC, many alleged that the bulldozing was politically motivated. Mugabe in 2008 Mugabe's actions brought strong criticism. The Zimbabwe Council of Churches accused him of plunging the country into \\"a de facto state of warfare\\" to stay in power. Several Southern African states remonstrated with him at a summit in Harare in September 2001. In 2002, the Commonwealth expelled Zimbabwe from among its ranks; Mugabe blamed this on anti-black racism, a view echoed by South Africa's President Thabo Mbeki. Mbeki favoured a policy of \\"quiet diplomacy\\" in dealing with Mugabe, and prevented the African Union (AU) from introducing sanctions against him. The Africa-Europe Summit, scheduled to take place in Lisbon in April 2003, was deferred repeatedly because African leaders refused to attend while Mugabe was banned; it eventually took place in 2007 with Mugabe in attendance. In 2004, the EU imposed a travel ban and asset freeze on Mugabe. It extended these sanctions in 2008, with the US government introducing further sanctions this same year. The US and UK introduced a resolution at the UN Security Council calling for an arms embargo of Zimbabwe alongside an asset freeze and travel ban of Mugabe and other government figures; it was vetoed by Russia and China. In 2009, the SADC demanded that Western states lift their targeted sanctions against Mugabe and his government. ZANU‚ÄìPF presented the sanctions as a form of Western neo-colonialism and blamed the West for Zimbabwe's economic problems. British prime minister Tony Blair allegedly planned regime change in Zimbabwe in the early 2000s as pressure intensified for Mugabe to step down. British General Charles Guthrie, the Chief of the Defence Staff, revealed in 2007 that he and Blair had discussed the invasion of Zimbabwe. However, Guthrie advised against military action: \\"Hold hard, you'll make it worse.\\" In 2013, South African President Thabo Mbeki said that Blair had also pressured South Africa to join in a \\"regime change scheme, even to the point of using military force\\" in Zimbabwe. Mbeki refused because he felt that \\"Mugabe is part of the solution to this problem.\\" However, a spokesman for Blair said that \\"he never asked anyone to plan or take part in any such military intervention.\\" =Power-sharing with the opposition MDC: 2008‚Äì2013= In March 2008, the parliamentary and presidential elections were held. In the former, ZANU‚ÄìPF secured 97 seats to the MDC's 99 and the rival MDC ‚Äì Ncube's 9. In May, the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission announced the presidential vote results, confirming that Tsvangirai secured 47.9%, to Mugabe's 43.2%. As neither candidate secured 50%, a run-off vote was scheduled. Mugabe saw his defeat as an unacceptable personal humiliation. He deemed it a victory for his Western, and in particular British, detractors, whom he believed were working with Tsvangirai to end his political career. ZANU‚ÄìPF claimed that the MDC had rigged the election. Mugabe in 2011 After the election, Mugabe's government deployed its \\"war veterans\\" in a violent campaign against Tsvangirai supporters. Between March and June 2008, at least 153 MDC supporters were killed. There were reports of women affiliated with the MDC being subjected to gang rape by Mugabe supporters. Tens of thousands of Zimbabweans were internally displaced by the violence. These actions brought international condemnation of Mugabe's government. UN Secretary- General Ban Ki-Moon expressed concern about the violence, which was also unanimously condemned by the UN Security Council, which declared that a free and fair election was \\"impossible\\". 40 senior African leaders‚Äîamong them Desmond Tutu, Kofi Annan, and Jerry Rawlings‚Äîsigned an open letter calling for an end to the violence. In response to the violence, Tsangirai pulled out of the run-off. In the second round, Mugabe was pronounced victor with 85.5% of the vote, and immediately re-inaugurated as President. The SADC oversaw the establishment of a power-sharing agreement; brokered by Mbeke, it was signed in September 2008. Under the agreement, Mugabe remained President while Tsvangirai became Prime Minister and the MDC's Arthur Mutambara became Vice Prime Minister. The cabinet was equally divided among MDC and ZANU‚ÄìPF members. ZANU‚ÄìPF nevertheless displayed unwillingness to share power, and were anxious to prevent any sweeping political changes. Under the power-sharing agreement, a number of limited reforms were passed. In early 2009, Mugabe's government declared that‚Äîto combat rampant inflation‚Äîit would recognise U.S. dollars as legal tender and would pay government employees in this currency. This helped to stabilise prices. ZANU‚ÄìPF blocked many of the proposed reforms and a new constitution was passed in March 2013. = Later years: 2013‚Äì2017= Mugabe and his wife in 2013 Declaring that he would \\"fight like a wounded animal\\" for re-election, Mugabe approached the 2013 elections believing that it would be his last. He hoped that a decisive electoral victory would secure his legacy, signal his triumph over his Western critics, and irreparably damage Tsvangirai's credibility. The opposition parties believed that this election was their best chance for ousting Mugabe. They portrayed him as a feeble old man who was being told what to do by the military; at least one academic observer argued that this was untrue. In contrast to 2008, there was no organised dissent against Mugabe within ZANU‚ÄìPF. The party elite decided to avoid the violence that had marred the 2008 election so as not to undermine its credibility, particularly in the eyes of the SADC, thus allowing Zimbabwe's government to consolidate its rule without interference. Mugabe called upon supporters to avoid violence, and attended far fewer rallies than in past elections, in part because of his advanced age and in part to ensure that those rallies he did attend were larger. The ZANU‚ÄìPF offered gifts, including food and clothing, to many members of the electorate to encourage them to vote for the party. ZANU‚ÄìPF won a landslide victory, with 61% of the presidential vote and over two-thirds of parliamentary seats. The elections were not considered free and fair; there were widespread stories of vote rigging and many voters may have been fearful of the violence that had surrounded the 2008 election. During the campaign, many MDC supporters had remained quiet about their views out of fear of reprisals. The MDC was also negatively impacted by its time in the coalition government, with perceptions that it had been just as corrupt as ZANU‚ÄìPF. ZANU‚ÄìPF had also capitalised on its appeals to African race, land, and liberation, while the MDC was often associated with white farmers, Western nations, and perceived Western values such as LGBT rights. Mugabe meeting Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in 2016 In February 2014, Mugabe underwent a cataract operation in Singapore; on return he celebrated his ninetieth birthday at a Marondera football stadium. In December 2014, Mugabe fired his Vice-President, Joice Mujuru, accusing her of plotting his overthrow. In January 2015, Mugabe was elected as the Chairperson of the African Union (AU). In November 2015, he announced his intention to run for re-election as Zimbabwe's President in 2018, at the age of 94, and was accepted as the ZANU‚ÄìPF candidate. In February 2016, Mugabe said he had no plans for retirement and would remain in power \\"until God says 'come'\\". In February 2017, right after his 93rd birthday, Mugabe stated he would not retire nor pick a successor, even though he said he would let his party choose a successor if it saw fit. In May 2017, Mugabe took a weeklong trip to Canc√∫n, Mexico, ostensibly to attend a three-day conference on disaster risk reduction, eliciting criticism of wasteful spending from opposition figures. He made three medical trips to Singapore in 2017, and Grace Mugabe called on him to name a successor. In October 2017, the World Health Organization (WHO) appointed Mugabe as a goodwill ambassador; this attracted criticism from both the Zimbabwean opposition and various foreign governments given the poor state of the Zimbabwean health system. Responding to the outcry, WHO revoked Mugabe's appointment a day later. In response, foreign minister Walter Mzembi said the United Nations system should be reformed. =Coup d'√©tat and resignation: 2017= On 6 November 2017, Mugabe sacked his first vice-president, Emmerson Mnangagwa. This fueled speculation that he intended to name Grace his successor. Grace was very unpopular with the ZANU‚ÄìPF old guard. On 15 November 2017, the Zimbabwe National Army placed Mugabe under house arrest as part of what it described as an action against \\"criminals\\" in Mugabe's circle. On 19 November, he was sacked as leader of ZANU‚ÄìPF, and Mnangagwa was appointed in his place. The party also gave Mugabe an ultimatum: resign by noon the following day, or it would introduce an impeachment resolution against him. In a nationally televised speech that night, Mugabe refused to say that he would resign. In response, ZANU‚ÄìPF deputies introduced an impeachment resolution on 21 November 2017, which was seconded by the MDC‚ÄìT. The constitution stipulated that removing a president from office required a two-thirds majority of both the House of Assembly and Senate in a joint sitting. However, with both major parties supporting the motion, Mugabe's impeachment and removal appeared all but certain. As per the constitution, both chambers met in joint session to debate the resolution. Hours after the debate began, the Speaker of the House of Assembly read a letter from Mugabe announcing that he had resigned, effective immediately. Mugabe and his wife negotiated a deal before his resignation, under which he and his kin were exempted from prosecution, his business interests would remain untouched, and he would receive a payment of at least $10 million. In July 2018, the Zimbabwe Supreme Court ruled that Mugabe had resigned voluntarily, despite some of the ex-president's subsequent comments. Post- presidency Late in December 2017, according to a government gazette, Mugabe was given full diplomatic status and, out of public funds, a five-bedroom house, up to 23 staff members, and personal vehicles. He further was permitted to keep the business interests and other wealth which he had amassed while in power, and he received an additional payment of about ten million dollars. On 15 March 2018, in his first interview since removal from the presidency, Mugabe insisted that he had been ousted in a \\"coup d'√©tat\\" which must be undone. He stated that he would not work with Mnangagwa and termed Mnangagwa's presidency \\"illegal\\" and \\"unconstitutional\\". In a lawsuit brought by two political parties, the Liberal Democrats and the Revolutionary Freedom Fighters, and others, the court found that the resignation was legal, and that Mnangagwa, as vice-president, duly took over the presidency. The state media reported that Mugabe had backed the National Political Front, which was formed by Ambrose Mutinhiri, a former high-ranking ZANU-PF politician who resigned in protest against Mugabe's removal from the presidency. The NPF posted a picture of Mutinhiri posing with Mugabe and issued a press release in which it said that the former president had praised the decision. On the eve of the first general election without him in almost thirty years, on 29 July 2018, Mugabe held a surprise press conference, in which he stated that he would not vote for President Mnangagwa and ZANU‚ÄìPF, the party he founded. Instead, he intended to vote for Nelson Chamisa, the candidate for his long-time rivals, the MDC. =Illness, death and funeral: 2019= Mugabe was unable to walk, according to President Mnangagwa in November 2018, and had been receiving treatment in Singapore for the previous two months. He was hospitalised in Singapore in April 2019, making the last of several trips to the country for medical treatment, as he had done late in his presidency and following his resignation. He died at Gleneagles Hospital in Singapore on 6 September 2019 at about 10:40 a.m. (Singapore Standard Time), according to a senior Zimbabwean diplomat. Although the cause of death was not officially disclosed, his successor Emmerson Mnangagwa told ZANU‚ÄìPF supporters in New York City that Mugabe had advanced cancer and his chemotherapy treatment had ceased to be effective. On 11 September 2019, his body was flown back to the Harare airport in Zimbabwe, where 1,000 had gathered to wait for the body and listen to a speech from president Emmerson Mnangagwa. Mugabe's body was then driven to the family residence in Borrowdale for a private wake attended by his friends and family, but not president Mnangagwa. The Associated Press reported that no supporters had gathered along the procession route, but 500 mourners gathered in his birthplace of Zvimba. On 13 September 2019, it was announced that the Mugabe family had accepted the Mnangagwa government's request to have Mugabe buried at Heroes Acre Cemetery and to have his burial be delayed for 30 days. The Mugabe family had initially rejected the government's burial plan and intended for him to be buried in Zvimba on either 16 or 17 September, a day later than the government's proposal. On 14 September 2019, Mugabe's funeral, which was also open to public attendance, was held at the National Sports Stadium, with an aerial photo showing the 60,000 capacity stadium to be about a quarter full. The funeral was attended by leaders of various African countries, including Mnangagwa, Dr. Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia, Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria, Hifikepunye Pohamba and Hage Geingob both of Namibia, Joseph Kabila of DR Congo, Uhuru Kenyatta of Kenya and Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa and many others. On 26 September 2019, Nick Mangwana stated that Mugabe would be buried in his home town of Kutama \\"to respect the wishes of families of deceased heroes\\". The burial took place on 28 September in a courtyard of his family home. Ideology Mugabe embraced African nationalism and anti-colonialism during the 1960s. Sabelo J. Ndlovu-Gatsheni characterised \\"Mugabeism\\" as a populist movement that was \\"marked by ideological simplicity, emptiness, vagueness, imprecision, and multi-class character\\", further noting that it was \\"a broad church\\". He also characterised it as a form of \\"left- nationalism\\", which consistently railed against imperialism and colonialism. He also argued that it was a form of nativism, which was permeated by a strong \\"cult of victimisation\\" in which a binary view was propagated where Africa was a \\"victim\\" and the West was its \\"tormentor\\". He suggested that it had been influenced by a wide range of ideologies, among them forms of Marxism like Stalinism and Maoism, as well as African nationalist ideologies like Nkrumaism, Ujamaa, Garveyism, N√©gritude, Pan-Africanism, and African neo- traditionalism. Mugabeism sought to deal with the problem of white settler racism by engaging in a project of anti-white racism that sought to deny white Zimbabweans citizenship by constantly referring to them as \\"amabhunu/Boers\\", thus enabling their removal from their land. ZANU‚ÄìPF claimed that it was influenced by Marxism‚ÄìLeninism; Onslow and Redding stated that in contrast to the Marxist emphasis on the urban proletariat as the main force of socio- economic change, Mugabe's party accorded that role to the rural peasantry. As a result of this pro-rural view, they argued, Mugabe and the ZANU‚ÄìPF demonstrated an anti-urban bias. The English academic Claire Palley met Mugabe in 1962, later noting that \\"he struck me as not so much a doctrinaire Marxist but an old-fashioned African nationalist\\", while Tekere claimed that for Mugabe, Marxism-Leninism was \\"just rhetoric\\" with \\"no genuine vision or belief behind it\\". Carington noted that while Mugabe used Marxist rhetoric during the Lancaster House negotiations, \\"of course he didn't actually practise what he preached, did he? Once in office he became a capitalist\\". Mugabe has stated that \\"socialism has to be much more Christian than capitalism\\". The Zimbabwean scholar George Shire described Mugabe's policies as being \\"broadly-speaking\\" social-democratic. During the 1980s, Mugabe indicated his desire to transform Zimbabwe from a multi-party state into a one-party state. In 1984 he stated that \\"the one-party state is more in keeping with African tradition. It makes for greater unity for the people. It puts all opinions under one umbrella, whether these opinions are radical or reactionary\\". The political scientist Sue Onslow and historian Sean Redding stated that Zimbabwe's situation was \\"more complex than pure venial dictatorship\\", but that it was an \\"ideo- dictatorship\\". Ndlovu-Gatsheni argued that since the mid-1990s, Mugabe's rhetoric and speeches came to be dominated by three main themes: an obsession with a perceived British threat to re-colonise Zimbabwe, to transfer the land controlled by white farmers to the black population, and issues of belonging and patriotism. References to the Rhodesian Bush War featured prominently in his speeches. The scholar of African studies Abiodun Alao noted that Mugabe was determined to \\"take advantage of the past in order to secure a firm grip on national security\\". David Blair stated that \\"Mugabe's collected writings amount to nothing more than crude Marxism, couched in the ponderous English of the mission school\\", remarking that they were heavily informed by Karl Marx, Mao Zedong, and Frantz Fanon, and displayed little originality. Blair noted that Mugabe's writings called for \\"command economics in a peasant society, mixed with anti-colonial nationalism\\", and that in this he held \\"the same opinions as almost every other African guerrilla leader\\" of that period. Mugabe argued that following the overthrow of European colonial regimes, Western countries continued to keep African countries in a state of subservience because they desired the continent's natural resources while preventing it from industrialising. Personal life Mugabe meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2015 Mugabe measured a little over , and exhibited what his biographer David Blair described as \\"curious, effeminate mannerisms\\". Mugabe took great care with his appearance, typically wearing a three-piece suit, and insisted that members of his cabinet dressed in a similar Anglophile fashion. On taking power in 1980, Mugabe's hallmark was his wide-rimmed glasses, and he was also known for his tiny moustache. Unlike a number of other African leaders, Mugabe did not seek to mythologise his childhood. He avoided smoking and drinking, and‚Äîaccording to his first biographers, David Smith and Colin Simpson‚Äîhad \\"enormous affection for children\\". During his early life he had an operation on his genitals which generated rumours that he had only one testicle or half a penis; such rumours were used by opponents to ridicule him and by supporters to bolster the claim that he was willing to make severe sacrifices for the revolutionary cause. Mugabe spoke English fluently with an adopted English accent when pronouncing certain words. He was also a fan of the English game of cricket, stating that \\"cricket civilizes people and creates good gentlemen\\". David Blair noted that this cultivation of British traits suggested that Mugabe respected and perhaps admired Britain while at the same time resenting and loathing the country. Holland suggested that these Anglophile traits arose in early life, as Mugabe‚Äîwho had long experienced the anti-black racism of Rhodesian society‚Äî\\"grasped Englishness as an antidote\\" to the \\"self-loathing\\" induced by societal racism. The academic Blessing-Miles Tendi stated that Mugabe was \\"an extremely complex figure, not easily captured by conventional categories\\". Similarly, David Blair described him as an \\"exceptionally complex personality\\". Smith and Simpson noted that the Zimbabwean leader had been \\"a serious young man, something of a loner, diligent, hard-working, a voracious reader who used every minute of his time, not much given to laughter: but above all, single-minded\\". Blair commented that Mugabe's \\"self-discipline, intelligence and appetite for hard work were remarkable\\", adding that his \\"prime characteristics\\" were \\"ruthlessness and resilience\\". Blair argued that Mugabe shared many character traits with Ian Smith, stating that they were both \\"proud, brave, stubborn, charismatic, deluded fantasists\\". Meredith described Mugabe as having a \\"soft-spoken demeanour, ... broad intellect, and ... articulate manner\\", all of which disguised his \\"hardened and single-minded ambition\\". Ndlovu-Gatsheni characterised him as \\"one of the most charismatic African leaders\\", highlighting that he was \\"very eloquent\\" and was able to make \\"fine speeches\\". Jonathan Moyo, who briefly served as Mugabe's information minister before falling out with him, stated that the President could \\"express himself well, that is his great strength\\". Tendi stated that Mugabe had a natural wittiness, but often hid this behind \\"an outwardly pensive and austere manner and his penchant for ceremony and tradition\\". Heidi Holland suggested that due to his \\"dysfunctional\\" upbringing, Mugabe had a \\"fragile self-image\\", describing him as \\"a man cut off from his feelings, devoid of ordinary warmth and humanity\\". According to her, Mugabe had a \\"marked emotional immaturity\\", and was homophobic, as well as racist and xenophobic. According to Meredith, Mugabe presented himself as \\"articulate, thoughtful, and conciliatory\\" after his 1980 election victory. Blair noted that at this period of his career, Mugabe displayed \\"genuine magnanimity and moral courage\\" despite his \\"intense personal reasons for feeling bitterness and hatred\\" toward the members of the former regime. Following his dealing with Mugabe during the 1979 negotiations, Michael Pallister, head of the British Foreign Office, described Mugabe as having \\"a very sharp, sometimes rather aggressive, and unpleasant manner\\". The British diplomat Peter Longworth stated that in private, Mugabe was \\"very charming and very articulate and he's not devoid of humour. It's very difficult to relate the man you meet with the man ranting on television\\". Norman stated that \\"I always found him personable and honourable in his dealings. He also had a warm side to him which I saw quite clearly sometimes\\". Colin Legum, a journalist with The Observer, argued that Mugabe had a \\"paranoidal personality\\", in that while he did not suffer from clinical paranoia, he did behave in a paranoid fashion when placed under severe and sustained pressure. Mugabe biographer Andrew Norman suggested that the leader may have suffered from antisocial personality disorder. Several Mugabe biographers have observed that he had an obsession with accruing power. According to Meredith, \\"power for Mugabe was not a means to an end, but the end itself.\\" Conversely, Onslow and Redding suggested that Mugabe's craving for power stemmed from \\"ideological and personal reasons\\" and his belief in the illegitimacy of his political opposition. Denis Norman, a white politician who served in Mugabe's cabinet for many years, commented that \\"Mugabe isn't a flashy man driven by wealth but he does enjoy power. That's always been his motivation\\". =Marriages and children= First Lady Sally Hayfron, in 1983 According to Holland, Mugabe's first wife, Sally Hayfron, was Mugabe's \\"confidante and only real friend\\", being \\"one of the few people who could challenge Mugabe's ideas without offending him\\". Their only son, Michael Nhamodzenyika Mugabe, born 27 September 1963, died on 26 December 1966 from cerebral malaria in Ghana where Sally was working while Mugabe was in prison. Sally Mugabe was a trained teacher who asserted her position as an independent political activist and campaigner. Mugabe called on Zimbabwe's media to refer to his wife as \\"Amai\\" (\\"Mother of the Nation\\"), although many Zimbabweans resented the fact that she was a foreigner. She was appointed as the head of ZANU‚ÄìPF's women's league, and was involved in a number of charitable operations, and was widely regarded as corrupt in these dealings. During Mugabe's premiership she suffered from renal failure, and initially had to travel to Britain for dialysis until Soames arranged for a dialysis machine to be sent to Zimbabwe. While married to Hayfron, in 1987 Mugabe began an extra- marital affair with his secretary, Grace Marufu; she was 41 years his junior and at the time was married to Stanley Goreraza. In 1988 she bore Mugabe a daughter, Bona, and in 1990 a son, Robert. The relationship was kept secret from the Zimbabwean public; Hayfron was aware of it. According to her niece Patricia Bekele, with whom she was particularly close, Hayfron was not happy that Mugabe had an affair with Marufu but \\"she did what she used to tell me to do: 'Talk to your pillow if you have problems in your marriage. Never, ever, humiliate your husband.' Her motto was to carry on in gracious style\\". Hayfron died in 1992 from a chronic kidney ailment. Following Hayfron's death in 1992, Mugabe and Marufu were married in a large Catholic ceremony in August 1996. As First Lady of Zimbabwe, Grace gained a reputation for indulging her love of luxury, with a particular interest in shopping, clothes, and jewellery. These lavish shopping sprees led to her receiving the nickname \\"Gucci Grace\\". She too developed a reputation for corruption. In 1997, Grace Mugabe gave birth to the couple's third child, Chatunga Bellarmine. Robert Mugabe Jr. and his younger brother, Chatunga, are known for posting their lavish lifestyle on social media, which has drawn accusations from opposition politician Tendai Biti that they are wasting Zimbabwean taxpayers' money. Public image and legacy By the twenty-first century, Mugabe was regarded as one of the world's most controversial political leaders. According to The Black Scholar journal, \\"depending on who you listen to...Mugabe is either one of the world's great tyrants or a fearless nationalist who has incurred the wrath of the West.\\" He has been widely described as a \\"dictator\\", a \\"tyrant\\", and a \\"threat\\", and has been referred to as one of Africa's \\"most brutal\\" leaders. At the same time he continued to be regarded as a hero in many Third World countries and received a warm reception when travelling throughout Africa. For many in Southern Africa, he remained one of the \\"grand old men\\" of the African liberation movement. According to Ndlovu-Gatsheni, within ZANU‚ÄìPF, Mugabe was regarded as a \\"demi-god\\" who was feared and rarely challenged. Within the ZANU movement, a cult of personality began to be developed around Mugabe during the Bush War and was consolidated after 1980. Mugabe had a considerable following within Zimbabwe, with David Blair noting that \\"it would be wrong to imply that he lacked genuine popularity\\" in the country. Holland believed that the \\"great majority\\" of Zimbabwe's population supported him \\"enthusiastically\\" during the first twenty years of his regime. His strongholds of support were Zimbabwe's Shona-dominated regions of Mashonaland, Manicaland, and Masvingo, while he remained far less popular in the non-Shona areas of Matabeleland and Bulawayo, and among the Zimbabwean diaspora living abroad. At the time of his 1980 election victory, Mugabe was internationally acclaimed as a revolutionary hero who was embracing racial reconciliation, and for the first decade of his governance he was widely regarded as \\"one of post-colonial Africa's most progressive leaders\\". David Blair argued that while Mugabe did exhibit a \\"conciliatory phase\\" between March 1980 and February 1982, his rule was otherwise \\"dominated by a ruthless quest to crush his opponents and remain in office at whatever cost\\". In 2011, the scholar Blessing-Miles Tendi stated that \\"Mugabe is often presented in the international media as the epitome of the popular leader gone awry: the independence struggle hero who seemed initially a Guccwasressive egalitarian, but has gradually been corrupted through his attachment to power during a long and increasingly repressive spell in office.\\" Tendi argued that this was a misleading assessment, because Mugabe had displayed repressive tendencies from his early years in office, namely through the repression of ZAPU in Matabeleland. Abiodun Alao concurred, suggesting that Mugabe's approach had not changed over the course of his leadership, but merely that international attention had intensified in the twenty-first century. For many Africans, Mugabe exposed the double standards of Western countries; the latter had turned a blind eye to the massacre of over 20,000 black Ndebele civilians in the Gukarakundi but strongly censured the Zimbabwean government when a small number of white farmers were killed during the land seizures. Example of foreign criticism: a demonstration against Mugabe's regime next to the Zimbabwe embassy in London (mid-2006). During the guerrilla war, Ian Smith referred to Mugabe as \\"the apostle of Satan\\". George Shire expressed the view that there was \\"a strong racist animus\\" against Mugabe within Zimbabwe, and that this had typically been overlooked by Western media representations of the country. Mugabe himself was accused of racism; John Sentamu, the Uganda-born Archbishop of York in the United Kingdom, called Mugabe \\"the worst kind of racist dictator\\", for having \\"targeted the whites for their apparent riches\\".Sentamu, John, Saving Zimbabwe is not colonialism, it's Britain's duty , The Observer 16 September 2007. Retrieved 24 June 2008. Desmond Tutu stated that Mugabe became \\"increasingly insecure, he's hitting out. One just wants to weep. It's very sad.\\" South African President Nelson Mandela was also critical of Mugabe, referring to him as a politician who \\"despise[s] the very people who put [him] in power and think[s] it's a privilege to be there for eternity\\". Writing for the Human Rights Quarterly, Rhoda E. Howard-Hassmann claimed that there was \\"clear evidence that Mugabe was guilty of crimes against humanity\\". In 2009, Gregory Stanton, then President of the International Association of Genocide Scholars, and Helen Fein, then Executive Director of the Institute for the Study of Genocide, published a letter in The New York Times stating that there was sufficient evidence of crimes against humanity to bring Mugabe to trial in front of the International Criminal Court. Australia and New Zealand had previously called for this in 2005, and a number of Zimbabwean NGOs did so in 2006. A 2005 article from the New American titled \\"Democide in Zimbabwe\\" says that Mugabe reduced the population of Zimbabwe by millions in just a few years. In 1994, Mugabe received an honorary knighthood from the British state; this was stripped from him at the advice of the UK government in 2008. Mugabe held several honorary degrees and doctorates from international universities, awarded to him in the 1980s; at least three of these have since been revoked. In June 2007, he became the first international figure ever to be stripped of an honorary degree by a British university, when the University of Edinburgh withdrew the degree awarded to him in 1984. See also: See also: On 12 June 2008, the University of Massachusetts Amherst Board of Trustees voted to revoke the law degree awarded to Mugabe in 1986, the first time one of its honorary degrees has been revoked. In the month after being deposed, but before he passed away, many of the public references to Mugabe ‚Äì street names, for example ‚Äì had been removed from public places.

The temple is located at 716 Nguy·ªÖn Ki·ªám Street on the road between Go Vap and Phu Nhuan districts. It is the location of the main Buddhist training centre for sangha in Vietnam, and is also the office of the Vietnamese Buddhist Research Institute. Before the fall of Saigon in 1975, the site of the temple was the campus of the school of applied science of V·∫°n H·∫°nh Buddhist University, under the leadership of Th√≠ch Minh Ch√¢u. In 1976, with the reunification of Vietnam. It was converted into a Zen meditation temple and Buddhist research centre. The temple is located on a block of land of one hectare in size. It comprises a main ceremonial hall, a patriarch hall, living and dining quarters for the sangha and separate facilities for various educational institutions. These include the office of the Vietnamese Buddhist Research Institute, the office of the Society for the Translation of the Mahayana sutras and the main Buddhist training centre in Vietnam, which trains Buddhist sangha. The temple fate was built in 1990 along the architectural model of the Buddhist temples in the central city of Hu·∫ø, under the administration of Th√≠ch T√¢m ƒêoan and Th√≠ch T·ªãnh Quang. The main hall is two- storied. The ground storey is the main ceremonial hall, with a white statue of Gautama Buddha seated on a lotus in the centre of the hall. One either side of the main hall are reading rooms of the temple's library, which stocks a large range of religious documents. The upper storey contains the guest room and the office of the abbot. The patriarch hall of the temple is also two-storied. The upper storey is for paying homage to the Buddha and to the patriarchs. On the altar of the patriarch altar is Th√≠ch T·ªãnh Khi·∫øt, the first head of the United Buddhist Congregation of Vietnam. The ground floor serves as the dharma hall, where dharma talks are held. V·∫°n H·∫°nh Zen Temple is the working office of the Buddhist Research Institute of Vietnam, where a team of Buddhist scholars works under Th√≠ch Minh Ch√¢u, who holds a doctorate in Buddhism and psychology. The institute is divided into departments, one for Vietnamese Buddhism, world Buddhism and one for printing and distribution. Another team is devoted towards translating Mahayana scriptures from Chinese into Vietnamese, in addition to the translation of the Pali Canon. The temple is also a major contributor in the training of Vietnamese Buddhist monks in the south of the country. It is the host of an institute of higher education in Buddhism, at an equivalent level to a university degree. Monks and nuns are accepted through an examination process to start a four-year course. Since 1984, the school has run three courses, training more than 400 members of the sangha.

She was important figure in the development of Buddhism in the United States. As Ruth Fuller Everett (during her first marriage), she met and studied with Daisetz Teitaro Suzuki in Japan in 1930. In 1938, she became a principal supporter of the Buddhist Society of America (later known as the First Zen Institute of America), in New York. She married Sokei-an, the Zen priest in residence there, in 1944, but he died within a year. In 1949, she went to Kyoto to find another roshi to live and teach in New York, to complete translations of key Zen texts, and to pursue her own Zen training,Fields 1992, pg. 197 receiving sanzen from Got≈ç Zuigan. She stayed in Kyoto for most of the rest of her life, becoming in 1958 the first foreigner to be a priest of a Rinzai Zen temple, and the only westerner, and the only woman, yet to be a priest of a Daitoku-ji temple. She was careful to record, however, that she did not perform the usual duties of a priest, \\"because I was a foreigner, a woman, untrained in temple procedures, and because I needed the years left me to carry on the work of spreading Zen to the west.\\" Sasaki was instrumental in the translations into English of many Zen texts. One of the most important was Zen dust; the history of the koan and koan study in Rinzai (Lin-chi) Zen, published in 1966 by her own First Zen Institute. In 2006, Gary Snyder wrote, \\"Her writings from the sixties were ahead of their time and remain accurate and relevant.\\" Early life and developing interest in Eastern religions Ruth Fuller was born and grew up in Chicago, and enjoyed wealth and privilege. She took piano lessons in Switzerland for several months in 1913, and also studied French and German with private tutors in Europe for a year and a half. In 1917, she married Edward Warren Everett, a trial attorney twenty years older than herself. At the end of 1918, a daughter was born, Eleanor. From 1938 to 1948, Eleanor was married to writer and Zen philosopher Alan Watts. In 1923-24, Ruth and Eleanor went to the Clarkstown Country Club in Nyack, New York, for rest and healing. This resort was led by Pierre Bernard, and offered adult education in yoga and Eastern philosophy and religions. Then from 1927 to 1929, she studied Sanskrit and Indian philosophy at the University of Chicago. First trips to Asia On a 1930 family sojourn to East Asia, Ruth met D. T. Suzuki, who gave her basic instruction for meditation, and told her that the best way to learn about Zen would be to return to Japan for an extended stay. Back in the US, she kept up a meditation practice and a correspondence with Suzuki. In 1932, she returned to Japan, arriving April 1. Suzuki introduced her to Nanshinken Roshi (Kono Mukai) of the Rinzai Zen monastery in Kyoto at Nanzen-ji, and she became his student. At first, she sat in the roshi's small private temple, because she was not allowed in the zendo. Six days a week, she rose at 5am, did zazen until 7am, had breakfast, went to Nanzen-ji, did zazen there all day, returned home for supper and a bath, and did more zazen at home until midnight. Nanshinken gave her a koan, and Suzuki acted as interpreter between roshi and student. After a month, she began to sit in the zendo, where the monks, originally resistant, soon welcomed her presence. She was back in the US in the summer. Decades later, she referred to those months at Nanzen-ji as \\"the most completely satisfactory time I have ever had in my life.\\" Kyoto research team She gathered together and employed a small team to study and do translation work under her leadership, and under the banner of the First Zen Institute of America in Japan (or Nichibei Daiichi Zen Kyokai, founded in 1957.). Her headquarters was Ryosen-an, a subtemple within Daitoku-ji. Most of the team had other, full-time jobs, and did work in this team part-time. One of the main projects of the team was to produce a translation of the Record of Rinzai (or Rinzai-roku, or Record of Linji, or Lin-chi Lu), a classic text of sayings of the founder of Rinzai. Sasaki originally planned to use translations made by her deceased husband, Sokei-an, and recorded by his students in New York, but the researchers found these translations inadequate. The director of the team was Iriya Yoshitaka (1910‚Äì1999), who was considered the world's foremost authority on colloquial Chinese of the Tang and Song Dynasties. He taught at Kyoto University, and eventually became Head of the Department of Chinese Literature at Nagoya University. English professor Kanaseki Hisao (1918‚Äì1996) was on the team, as well as Yokoi (later Yanagida) Seizan (1922-), who taught at Kyoto University and later was president of Hanazono University. Yampolsky wrote in 1991 that Yanagida \\"is recognized as the foremost scholar of Zen Buddhism in both China and Japan.\\" Three Americans were on the team: Burton Watson, Philip Yampolsky, and Gary Snyder. (Sasaki sponsored Snyder's first trip to Japan.) They were also joined by Walter Nowick, a pianist and member of the First Zen Institute, to work on the Record of Rinzai. Between 1959 and 1963, the Institute published several small pamphlets, including Zen: A Religion, Zen: A Method for Religious Awakening, Rinzai Zen Study for Foreigners in Japan, The First Zen Institute of America in Japan, Ryosen-an Zendo Practice, and The Wooden Fish: Basic Sutras and Gathas of Rinzai Zen. This group was dealt a blow in August 1961, when she dismissed Yampolsky (whom she accused of stealing the team's translation of the Rinzai-roku to publish it as his own), and Watson and Snyder resigned in protest. This may be considered the culmination of a long-standing tension between Sasaki's authority as an employer with an autocratic style, and the scholarly authority of members of the team. The three Japanese scholars continued to work on Zen Dust for her. Zen Dust was finally published, first in Japan in 1966, then in the US the following year. It was preceded by Zen Koan, a four hundred page shorter edition in 1965. The Record of Rinzai was published after Sasaki's death, in 1975, as The Record of Lin-chi, but without Iriya's notes or Yanagida's introduction. Ryosen-an zendo At Ryosen-an, a subtemple just inside the northern boundary of Daitoku-ji, Fuller Sasaki maintained a small but beautiful zendo (a hall where people could practice zazen, or sitting meditation) named Zuiun-ken, which had room for about 15 people. Only Westerners (no Japanese) practiced zazen here. Each person sat on a padded cushion on a raised platform for about 25 minutes. Then there was a bell. Everyone stood up, walked slowly (kinhin) around the outside of the hall, then returned to sit 25 more minutes. After four sittings (two hours), there was a brief period of chanting, before the sitters returned home. The zendo was full for most of each summer. Many Westerners first learned how to practice zazen in this zendo.Journal of William Shurtleff, 1967 Final years Sasaki continued to do her utmost to complete as many of her long- standing projects as possible, amidst deteriorating health in her last years. She collapsed from exhaustion while in Europe to deal with European publishers. She was at Ryosen-an when she died of a heart attack on October 24, 1967. Bibliography * Miura, Isshu.

The elevator and two surrounding outbuildings were listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1997. History The grain elevator, known as Armour's Warehouse, was constructed in 1861-62 on the north bank of the Illinois-Michigan Canal in Seneca, Illinois. It was built by John Armour and remained in the Armour family for a short time before passing through different owners. Though not the first grain elevator in Seneca, it is the only historic grain elevator still standing in the village.Henning, Barbara J. \\"Armour's Warehouse\\", (PDF), National Register of Historic Places Registration Form, September 15, 1997, Illinois Historic Preservation Agency, accessed May 12, 2008. Design The Seneca Grain Elevator consists of a grain elevator or \\"elevating warehouse\\" which rises four stories above its basement. The by structure dominates the site and overlooks downtown Seneca. Between 1924-39 corrugated metal siding was added to the building as a fire prevention measure. Outbuildings The 1892 office and scale house, a contributing property. In total there are five separate buildings, including the grain elevator, on the site of Armour's Warehouse. An 1883 spur of railroad track remains on the north side of the elevator; the tracks lead to a dump shed connected to a c. 1940 corn crib. Also on the property are an office with an attached scale house dating from 1892, and two seed warehouses. One seed warehouse dates from after 1947 while the other dates from the earlier 1940s. Historic significance The Seneca Grain Elevator is the oldest remaining grain elevator along the banks of the Illinois-Michigan Canal, a U.S. National Historic Landmark District. It is historically significant in a local context commercially and in attracting the railroad to Seneca. On a broader level, it illustrates the economic importance of the Illinois-Michigan Canal for transporting grain products. Armour's Warehouse was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on November 7, 1997. Included in the listing as contributing properties were the 1892 office building and attached scale house, and the older of the two seed warehouses.

He held the office of Palatine (n√°dor) several times (1288‚Äì1289, 1290‚Äì1291, 1291‚Äì1293, 1295‚Äì1296, 1297‚Äì1298, 1299‚Äì1300, 1302‚Äì1310), and he was also judge royal (orsz√°gb√≠r√≥) twice (1283‚Äì1285, 1289). He was assassinated at the south gate in the city of Kassa by Saxon burghers. Family and early career He was born as the son of David I, a member of the genus (clan) Aba, who was mentioned as \\"isp√°n\\" (comes) in contemporary sources and ancestor of the Berth√≥ty family. Amadeus had three siblings, Palatine Finta, who had rebelled against the King in 1281, Royal Judge Peter, who was a close ally of Amadeus and a daughter who married Simon from the Kacsics genus. Amadeus had at least six sons and a daughter from his unidentified wife, who had survived him. The eldest son was John, who served as Master of the horse according to his own charter. His other two sons, Nicholas III and David II were killed in the Battle of Rozgony. Amadeus' only daughter Catherine married Blessed Maurice Cs√°k in 1301, who later became a Dominican friar. Catherine also joined the nuns at Margaret Island. This act angered Amadeus, who imprisoned Maurice in Buda for a short time, but later released him. Amadeus fought in the Battle of Marchfeld in the troops King Ladislaus IV of Hungary sent to King Rudolph I of Germany against King Ottokar II of Bohemia (26 August 1278). In 1280, Aba became the head of Hermannstadt (today Sibiu in Romania), i.e., the royal officer appointed to administer the Transylvanian Saxons. Following the dismissal of Finta as Palatine, he rebelled against Ladislaus in 1281. As Peter Aba was appointed Master of the treasury and there is no mention of Amadeus Aba, it is likely to be declared that only Finta rebelled against the king and not the whole Aba clan. King Ladislaus IV appointed Amadeus to the office of judge royal in 1283. In February 1285, he fought successfully against the Mongols who were pillaging the north-eastern parts of the kingdom. He received land and special privileges in Poland from Wladyslaw Lokietek King of Poland, and was referred to as Amadej in Polish. The powerful magnate Area ruled by Amadeus Aba After 9 August 1288, Amadeus Aba became Palatine and he held the office for the first time until 1289 when he received the office of judge royal again. Later, he rebelled against the king whose troops occupied one of his castles, Tokaj (before 27 May 1290). Following the king's death (10 July 1290), Aba became the loyal supporter of King Andrew III of Hungary who appointed him Palatine. Although the king appointed a new Palatine already in 1291, he still continued to use the title until his death, and later he was confirmed in the office several times by the kings. After 1297, Aba was among the most powerful supporters of King Andrew III and he even made a formal alliance with the king and his other followers in the second half of 1298. When King Andrew III died (14 January 1301), some of the powerful aristocrats became the supporters of Wenceslaus, the crown prince of Bohemia, while others, including Aba, supported the claim of Charles, a member of the Angevin dynasty. Charles laid siege to Buda, the capital of the kingdom, in September 1302, but Ivan K≈ëszegi relieved the town. Charles's charters show that he primarily stayed in the southern parts of the kingdom during the next years, although he also visited Amadeus Aba in the fortress of G√∂nc. In 1304, Scepusian Saxons and the citizens of Kassa supported by Wenceslaus unsuccessfully besieged Amadeus' centre, G√∂nc. Later, Wenceslaus left the kingdom (August 1304), and shortly afterwards, Aba concluded an agreement with Charles and Duke Rudolph III of Austria against Wenceslaus' father, King Wenceslaus II of Bohemia. In 1304 and 1305, he gave military assistance to Duke W≈Çadys≈Çaw of Cuiavia against King Wenceslaus II who had occupied Lesser Poland. W≈Çadys≈Çaw also resided in G√∂nc for several years. This case proves that Amadeus followed an independent foreign policy, similarly to the other oligarchs of the realm. As the Illuminated Chronicle notes, he considered Charles as his King \\"only with words but not with deeds\\". Amadeus Aba was present at the Assembly of R√°kos (10 October 1307) where the participants confirmed Charles' claim for the throne. Charles was proclaimed king at the Assembly in Pest (27 November 1308), in the presence of Aba. In 1308, he became the head (isp√°n) of Szepes. He was present when King Charles was crowned in Buda (15 June 1309). Afterwards, he mediated between the king and Ladislaus K√°n, the powerful Voivode of Transylvania who made a promise that he would transfer the Holy Crown of Hungary to the king. King Charles stripped him of his titles around May 1310, as Amadeus was mentioned as \\"former palatine\\" in a royal charter. In the course of the year, Amadeus occupied several castles. He wanted to expand his influence over Kassa, but the citizens rebelled against him and they killed Amadeus in a skirmish on 5 September 1311. Two of his sons, Amadeus II and Dominic were captured and held hostage alongside other 45 family members and vassals. Dominion Aba Boldogk≈ë Castle, owned by Amadeus Aba since c. 1300 Amadeus and his brother, Finta inherited Nevicke (today Nyevickoje, Ukraine) from their father, where Amadeus had a castle built. They may also have inherited Szokoly (today Sokol' in Slovakia). His dominion developed gradually in the course of the last decades of the 13th century. In 1288, King Ladislaus IV granted him the County Ung, thus he could hold the former royal possessions in the county until his death. Around 1300, he acquired Boldogk≈ë Castle and G√∂nc, later he also held Reg√©c. In 1310, he occupied Lubl√≥ (today Star√° ƒΩubov≈àa in Slovakia) and Munk√°cs (today Mukachevo in Ukraine). By 1311, Amadeus ruled Aba√∫j (from his castle in Aba√∫jv√°r and G√∂nc), Zempl√©n, Ung, Bereg and Szepes County, but in addition, he also had influence in some parts of Borsod, G√∂m√∂r and Szabolcs County. He usurped royal prerogatives in his dominion, e.g., he granted lands and nobility to his followers. He governed his possessions from his North- Eastern Hungarian castle in G√∂nc. He also expropriated the judicial function in his territory as he had an own court of justice in Vizsoly. Amadeus arbitrarily imposed duties and built castles and appointed castellans among his familiars without the permission of the king. Amadeus had own provincial court, where he elected chancellors, notaries, judges and even a Judge royal, imitating the functions of royal court. Beside duties, the trade and the business of traders were also under his influence. He continuously harassed and oppressed the town markets and traders, especially Kassa. The local nobles were forced to swear allegiance to the Aba kindred. According to a diploma issued in 1302, his troops seized the possessions of a local noble in Aba√∫j County and the owner himself was imprisoned and threatened with death to persuade him to pass on the family's deed of gift. Historian Attila Zsoldos draws a distinction between the \\"oligarchs\\" (e.g. Matthew Cs√°k) and \\"provincial lords\\" (e.g. Ugrin Cs√°k) regarding the role of the royal power in the provincial administration. Amadeus Aba exercised sovereign rights in his domain but remained loyal to the kings (he rebelled against the central power only once in 1288, when the unpopular Ladislaus IV lost all domestic and foreign support), thus Zsoldos refers to him as a \\"loyal oligarch\\", alongside Stephen √Åkos. Following his death, Charles's envoys arbitrated an agreement on 3 October 1311 between Amadeus' widow, sons and the town, which also prescribed that the Abas should withdraw from two counties and allow the noblemen inhabiting their domains to freely join Charles. This marked end of the Aba province in North-East Hungary. However, the Abas soon entered into an alliance with Matthew Cs√°k, the most powerful oligarch in the realm, against the king. Nonetheless, his sons could not maintain his power, and after their defeat at the Battle of Rozgony (today Rozhanovce in Slovakia) his dominion disintegrated. Taking advantage of their downfall, Peter, son of Petenye built up a dominant power in Zempl√©n County, while some of Amadeus' former castles and possessions were obtained by members of the Drugeth family in the 1320s‚Äì1340s.

The temple was initially built on a prominent hill, but in 1861 it was destroyed in fighting as the French colonial army underwent the process of colonising southern Vietnam. The temple was rebuilt by Th√≠ch Ch√°nh ƒê·∫Øc at the foot of the hill, around 100 m south of the original site. The temple currently is located at 35 Yersin Street, in Ph√∫ C∆∞·ªùng ward, in the town of Th·ªß ƒê·∫ßu M·ªôt, north of Ho Chi Minh City.  Geography  The temple is located only 150 m away from the road. Beyond the triple gates inscribed with depictions of dragons and phoenixes, the temple lies on a quiet plot of land, with many trees, in particular, four eucalyptus trees more than a century old that were planted shortly after the temple was rebuilt. The temple has been refurbished and expanded many times, but retains its old-fashioned architecture. The preaching hall and the eastern sanctuary were rebuilt in 1917, and the western sanctuary was rebuilt in 1984. The main ceremonial hall was rebuilt in 1990-1991\\\\. On February 29, 1992, the Board of the Buddhist Association of Song Be Province organised the restoration of the historical statues of the temple. The total built-up area occupied by the main hall, preaching hall, western and eastern sanctuary of the temple is 700 square metres. In the main hall are statues of Gautama Buddha, Ksitigarbha and other bodhisattvas, all made of wood with a golden paint exterior. There are statues of 18 arahants around the main hall. The wooden statues were carved in the late 19th century by local craftsmen from Th·ªß ƒê·∫ßu M·ªôt. Over the more than 250 years of its existence, ten abbots have presided over the temple. The cremated remains of the nine past abbots have been enshrined in stupas on the temple grounds. These are Th√≠ch ƒê·∫°i Ng·∫°n, Th√≠ch Ch√¢n K√≠nh, Th√≠ch Ch√°nh ƒê·∫Øc, Th√≠ch Tr√≠ T·∫≠p, Th√≠ch Thi·ªán Qu·ªõi, Th√≠ch T·ª´ VƒÉn, Th√≠ch ·∫§n B·ª≠u - Thi·ªán Qu·ªõi, Th√≠ch Thi·ªán H∆∞∆°ng and Th√≠ch Qu·∫£ng Vi√™n. The current abbot is Th√≠ch Hu·ªá Th√¥ng, who is also the current Secretary-General of the provincial Buddhist association. H·ªôi Kh√°nh temple has long been a centre of Buddhist scholarship in the region. Many of the monks trained at the temple have gone on to open and preside over other temples in the area.  Notable monks  One notable monk to have come from H·ªôi Kh√°nh was Th√≠ch T·ª´ VƒÉn who was regarded as the leading monk of his time from southern Vietnam. In 1920, he was invited to Marseilles, France to give talks on the dharma. His efforts were instrumental in the setting up of Hoi Khanh Temple in Marseille. From 1923 to 1926, a group of anti-colonial activists who advocated Vietnamese independence from France, met at the temple. One of the activists was Nguy·ªÖn Sinh S·∫Øc, the father of Ho Chi Minh. The temple is currently the headquarters of the provincial Buddhist association and has been listed by the Vietnamese government as having heritage value on the grounds of being significant in national culture.

In 1640 Fones, with her then- husband Robert Feake, were founders of Greenwich, Connecticut.Wolfe (2012) She married her third husband while her mentally ill second husband, from whom she was separated and whom she could not divorce, was still living; this was considered adultery and it scandalized the Puritan colony.Winthrop (1891), pp. 2‚Äì4, 10. Early life Elizabeth Fones was born at Groton Manor, Suffolk, England on 21 January 1610 to Thomas Fones, a London apothecary, and his wife, Anne Winthrop, sister of John Winthrop, a staunch Puritan and the eventual Governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony.Whitmore (1864)Winthrop (1891), p. 2.Buckland (2000), p. 1. As a young girl, Fones worked at her father's shop in London. To the dismay of her family, she entered a whirlwind courtship with her first cousin Henry Winthrop, a son of Governor John Winthrop; they were married on 25 April 1629, at the Church of St. Sepulchre at New Gate, London.Mayo (1948), p. 60.Anderson (1995), p. 1030.Bremer (2005), pp. 130‚Äì131.Raymer (1963), p. 51. A year later, her husband sailed alone for the Massachusetts Bay Colony on the ship Talbot, leaving his young bride behind in England on account of her pregnancy.Miller (1907), pp. 28‚Äì29. The baby, a daughter named Martha Johanna Winthrop, was born on 9 May 1630 at Groton Manor.Mayo (1948), pp. 60‚Äì61.Winthrop (1891), p. 4. Shortly after his arrival in Massachusetts, Henry was killed in a drowning accident on 2 July 1630Bremer (2005), p. 187. when he went swimming in the North River after visiting an Indian village near Salem.Mayo (1948), pp. 59‚Äì61.Buckland (2000), pp. 1‚Äì3. Massachusetts Bay Colony Fones sailed to the Massachusetts Bay Colony with her infant daughter Martha aboard the Lyon, arriving on 2 November 1631.Mayo (1948), p. 61. Her father-in-law, uncle and guardian, John Winthrop, served as Governor of the Colony.Mayo (1948), pp. 1‚Äì5.Bremer (2005) In 1632 Fones married her second husband, a wealthy landowner named Lt. Robert Feake (born 1602 in London, England)Winthrop (1891), p. 3.Anderson (1995), p. 2040.Miller (1907), p. 28. He owned land in both Massachusetts and Connecticut. The marriage was arranged by her uncle (and former father-in-law), Gov. John Winthrop. In 1640, the Feakes acquired more land in what is now Greenwich, Connecticut.Latting (1880) Indeed, she is considered one of the founders of Greenwich;Mead (1911), pp. 4‚Äì9. what is now called 'Greenwich Point' was known for much of its early history as 'Elizabeth's Neck' in recognition of Elizabeth Fones and their 1640 purchase of the Point and much of what is today called Old Greenwich. The fact that she, as a woman, had property in her own name was viewed with dismay in the more rigid society of the day.Winthrop (1891), pp. 2‚Äì4. They had five children: Elizabeth (born 1633), Hannah (born 1637), John (born 1639), Robert (born 1642) and Sarah (born before 1647). In 1647, due to financial, domestic, and personal problems, Lt. Feake went insane and abandoned his wife and children.Buckland (2000), p. 9. Fones and Feake were separated or divorced by Dutch law in 1647. Scandal Following her husband's desertion, Fones deeply scandalized the rigid Puritan society in which she lived by marrying William Hallett (born 1616)Wolfe (2012), p. 133 without evidence that she and Lt. Feake were divorced. Hallett may have been her husband's business manager,Winthrop (1891), pp. 3, 10. but modern evaluation finds no support for this.Winthrop (1891), pp. 132, 228 Fones had two sons with Hallett: William (born c. 1648) and Samuel (born c. 1650). Their marriage took place in August 1649, and was officiated by her former brother- in-law John Winthrop, Jr.. Only her close blood relationship to the Governor saved her from prosecution for adultery, for which she could have been hanged. Nevertheless, Fones and her new husband and family were forced to leave Connecticut and Massachusetts for the more tolerant Dutch colony of New Netherlands / New York,Mead (1911), pp. 8‚Äì9. where they were eventually recognized as husband and wife, possibly due to the friendship Fones formed with Judith Stuyvesant, wife of Director-General Peter Stuyvesant. The Halletts settled in an area which was later called Hallett's Cove and is now known as Astoria, Queens, near Hell Gate.Winthrop (1891), p. 13. In September 1655, Fones and her family survived an attack by the Hackensack tribe of Indians; however, the Indians set fire to their house and farm, burning both to the ground. She purchased land in Flushing and Newtown, Queens County on 1 October from Edward Griffin. The following year, William Hallett was made \\"Schout\\" or chief-official of Flushing.Gehring, Charles T. (editor). New Netherlands Council Minutes, 1655-1656. Syracure Press, 1995, p. 278 Upon the marriage of her daughter Hannah Feake to John Bowne, Fones and William Hallet became Quakers.Wolfe (2012), pp. 178‚Äì182. Fones' date of death is uncertain and is disputed among historians. Her death likely occurred in Newtown, Queens County, New York. She was alive in 1668 and her widower remarried in 1674, so it is likely that her death took place in the early 1670s.Wolfe (2012), pp. 189, 191 Descendants Fones has numerous descendants in the United States, including those descending from the marriage of her only child by Henry Winthrop, Martha Johanna, to Thomas Lyon of Byram Neck, Greenwich, Connecticut,Winthrop (1891), pp. 4, 9‚Äì10, 14‚Äì16. whose home, the Thomas Lyon House, is on the National Register of Historic Places. Fones' daughter Hannah Feake married John Bowne who was a North American pioneer for religious freedom with the Flushing Remonstrance.

Marcos declared nationwide martial law in September 1972. Former workers of the Philippines Herald, which was closed at that time, established the Philippine Journalists Inc. (PJI) under the management of the late Benjamin Romualdez, former First Lady Imelda Marcos' younger brother. PJI was allowed by the government to operate on October 21, 1972 with its flagship paper, Times Journal. Their headquarters was then located at the building now owned by The Philippine Star at Port Area, Manila. They later moved to the old Manila Chronicle building until their return in the Port Area (Times Journal Bldg., now Journal Bldg.) in 1977 with the acquisition of a new printing press. Inspired by New York Post, it was on 1978 when People‚Äôs Journal was first launched as a broadsheet then, with Villanueva assigned as editor-in-chief and with the help of Vergel Santos, assigned as managing editor, and Friginal. Although with legitimacy, however, they were stopped by the Print Media Council due to lack of permit to print. Only with acquisition of permit, they were able to relaunch the paper a week later. In the early 1980s, it increased its popularity with the feature of the comics of Carlo Caparas. After the end of administration of Pres. Marcos, in 1986, all PJI's shares were sequestered by the Presidential Commission on Good Government for the suspicions of ownership and being part of the ill-gotten wealth. This resulted to decrease of its sales and circulation since it focuses on government-related events. Majority of these were ordered by the Supreme Court to be released in 1991.
