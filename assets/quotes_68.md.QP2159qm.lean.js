Geography East of Pas-de-Calais (B√©thune, Lens, H√©nin- Beaumont) An ex-coalmining commune, now a light industrial and farming town, situated some northeast of Lens, completely encircled by the N17 and D919 ring road. History Major excavations have recently revealed occupation going back to Neolithic times. This settlement is linked to the existence of the vast wet depression around the now-disappeared castle of Epinoy. In the early 12th century, the hamlet of √âpinoy, now the east part of the commune, was the home of the hermit Saint Druon of Sebourg. The history of this market town, located on the road between Arras, Lille and Tournai, was then marked by coalmining, starting in the mid-nineteenth century and ending in 1975. One of the smaller mining companies had its headquarters in Carvin. At nationalization, the pits and mining facilities were consolidated within the Oignies group. During World War I, from October 1914 to October 1918, Carvin was occupied by the Germans. Located at the rear of the front as a garrison town for both German military and civilians. The bodies of over 6,000 soldiers are laid to rest in one of the largest German cemeteries in the Nord-Pas-de- Calais region. Carvin was awarded the Croix de Guerre on September 28, 1920. In May 1940, during the German invasion of France, Carvin‚Äôs town centre was the scene of a major battle that allowed the bulk of British and French troops to get to Dunkirk and freedom. Once the allies had gone, the troops of the Wehrmacht delivered fierce reprisals on the population of the towns of mining pit 4: Carvin, Courri√®res and Oignies. Following the miners' strike in May and June 1941 which spread throughout the Nord-Pas-de-Calais, many miners (mostly communists) were arrested and executed at Arras. In 1947, Carvin lost nearly a third of its territory with the separation of the commune of Libercourt, which claimed its independence. The town lost much of its industry during the years 1970 to 1990. Mining, construction and engineering were all reduced in size. Much of the railway network was dismantled in the early 1990s. Today it is mostly a services and residential commune for the regional capital, Lille.

Earth Station 5 (ES5) was a peer-to-peer network active between 2003 and 2005, operated by a company of the same name. The user client application also shared this name. Earth Station 5 was notable for its strong, if overstated, emphasis on user anonymity, and for its bold advocacy of piracy and copyright infringement. ES5's highly antagonistic position toward copyright advocacy and enforcement organizations garnered the group significant attention and peaked with an ES5 press release announcing a \\"declaration of war\\" against the Motion Picture Association of America. ES5 claimed to operate out of the Jenin in the Palestinian Authority-controlled West Bank, a region where they argued that copyright laws were unenforceable. Investigative journalism cast serious doubts on the company's Palestinian origin as well as many of its other claims. To this day, much about the company and its leadership remains uncertain or unknown.  Peer-to-peer services  Screenshot of the EarthStation 5 website at the time of launch. Earth Station 5 was based around a peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing service and a standalone Earth Station 5 file-sharing client. Initial versions of the software could only share or download files by using the ES5 network. ES5's P2P network and client were announced on June 9, 2003. People associated with ES5 claimed in media reports that the network had more than 16,000,000 participants at its peak, but these numbers were unsupported and viewed very skeptically. The actual number of participants was probably several orders of magnitude smaller. Largely due to the low availability of files on the small ES5 network, later versions of the ES5 client included the free software/open source giFT daemon which provided ES5 users access to the larger Gnutella and FastTrack networks. While Gnutella and FastTrack offered access to many more files, the functionality that let users access these networks did not take advantage of any of ES5's anonymity features, which decreased the advantages of ES5 over other P2P clients ‚Äî in particular other FastTrack or Gnutella clients. = ES5 software = Screenshot showcasing other services they offered. The first version of the ES5 client used a space and spaceship motif and provided many options. In addition to several filesharing options, it provided links to chat, news, forums, dating functionality and news. The client interface was derided by reviewers as \\"clunky\\" and \\"a busy affair\\" for its plethora of features. The second version of the client, released a year later, garnered better reviews. However, users still felt overwhelmed by the \\"bundled\\" features that included a dating service and audio-visual chat. ES5 claimed it planned to capitalize on these features in order to become profitable. = Claims to anonymity = ES5 became well known for its strong claims that file-sharing on its network was entirely anonymous ‚Äî a feature it billed as its most important and revolutionary ‚Äî and that its users could share files while remaining undetectable and thus invulnerable to lawsuits by the RIAA's member companies, which had recently begun suing P2P users. ES5 president Ras Kabir claimed that on ES5, \\"users no longer have to be concerned about what they are sharing, or with whom they are sharing because there is complete anonymity.\\" Many groups countered ES5's claims about its users' anonymity. RIAA vice president Matt Oppenheim described it as \\"marketing hype of the worst kind. It is playing on the fears of others, encouraging them to engage in behavior that will get them into a boatload of trouble.\\" Even many participating in or sympathetic to the file-sharing community were skeptical, believing that anonymous communication on P2P networks was technically impossible without critically compromising quality of service, and as a result they considered ES5's claims to be snake oil. ES5's claims to anonymity were based on its use of several security technologies. The first version of the software used Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption, encrypted searches over UDP, and integration with PGPDisk. However, none of these layers of security prevented RIAA member companies from detecting and gathering information about ES5 users' file trading activities. In later versions of its client, ES5 added the ability to use a network of proxies to obscure the source of requests or shared files. ES5 staffers maintained a frequently-updated list of proxy servers. List updates were posted regularly to the ES5 forums and then updated into the clients by hand. ES5 also added the ability to \\"spoof\\" IP addresses in a way that ES5 claimed made it more difficult to track down file sharers. While ES5's claim to anonymity continued to be viewed skeptically by both P2P advocates and RIAA representatives, no ES5 users were ever sued by the RIAA. = Copyright infringement by ES5 = After the ruling in A&M; Records, Inc. v. Napster, Inc., which held Napster liable for contributory infringement by its users,A & M Records, Inc. v. Napster, Inc., 114 F. Supp. 2d 896 (N.D. Cal. 2000), aff'd in part, rev'd in part, 239 F.3d 1004 (9th Cir. 2001) Most P2P networks were careful to adopt a strategy of \\"turning a blind eye\\" to copyright infringement on their network in order to escape or minimize liability. ES5 distinguished itself by openly supporting its users' copyright infringement over its network and by actively participating in sharing movies with its users. Some within the file-sharing community speculated that ES5 shared media in order to \\"seed\\" the network with media ‚Äî a step necessary because ES5's user base was very small compared to other networks and it did not require quotas. ES5 shared media by downloading content from other networks (e.g., Kazaa and Gnutella), vetting these for quality, and then connecting a version of their client to their network from one of their servers. This step was important in assuring that ES5's network could offer a sufficient amount of content to users. In the early stages of the network, ES5 tried to attract users by streaming movies in addition to in-network sharing. To do this, ES5 created a website at es5.org which provided links to dozens of Hollywood films immediately available for streaming.  Antagonistic relationship to media industry  While few P2P networks enjoy friendly relationships with the media and content industries, ES5 displayed a famously antagonistic relationship to them--most notably the US-based Motion Picture Association of America and Recording Industry Association of America. This position culminated in a famous press release where ES5 formally declared war on the MPAA: :In response to the email received today from the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) to Earthstation 5 for copyright violations for streaming FIRST RUN movies over the internet for FREE, this is our official response! :Earthstation 5 is at war with the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) and the Record Association of America (RIAA), and to make our point very clear that their governing laws and policys [sic] have absolutely no meaning to us here in Palestine, we will continue to add even more movies for FREE. In the same release, ES5 claimed that, \\"unlike Kazaa and other P2P programs who subsequently deny building their P2P program for illegal file-sharing, ES5 is the only P2P application and portal to actually join its users in doing P2P.\\" Because of its antagonistic relationship to media companies, its highly outspoken stance, and its claims to be based in a refugee camp in the West Bank, ES5 became the center of a large amount of media attention. Investigative articles ultimately served to expose much of the lies and misinformation behind the site and its operators.  People and leadership  ES5 intentionally obscured the details of its company leadership. While ES5 claimed that it had over one thousand employees (most based in the West Bank), the facts seem to indicate that there were never more than a handful. Publicly, ES5 was run by President Ras Kabir, Lead Programmer \\"File Hoover\\", and Forums Administrator and Programmer \\"SharePro\\". Faced with evidence that the company had a relationship with Stephen M. Cohen, then a fugitive because of his involvement in the sex.com scandal, the company announced its retention of Cohen's services as an executive consultant. = Ras Kabir = Most ES5 press releases quoted company president Ras Kabir who, like most of the company, was nominally based in Jenin in the West Bank. = Stephen M. Cohen = While his involvement in the project was publicly hidden early on, Stephen Michael Cohen was closely involved in all stages of ES5 and, in most opinions, was the founder, primary architect, and primary participant in most of its actions. Cohen is best known as the person involved in fraudulently obtaining control of the sex.com domain name. ES5's business registrations papers, filed with the Palestinian Authority, listed Cohen as the \\"sole director\\" of ES5. Both in the forum and through their spokesperson, ES5 officials claimed that Cohen played the role of a consultant. Kabir claimed that, \\"We offered Mr. Cohen an executive job with our company. He initially turned us down, however after several telephone calls, he finally gave in and agreed to help us in the capacity of a consultant.\\" Fueling speculation about Cohen's close involvement, ES5's unanticipated closing coincided closely with Cohen's arrest for activity related to sex.com.  Downfall  ES5 suffered a precipitous downfall that ultimately ended with the closing of the network in 2005. Analysts have seen several factors as contributing to its downfall and ultimate closing. = Accusations of Malicious code = In September 2003, Shaun \\"Random Nut\\" Garriok posted an email message to the Full Disclosure email list claiming to have uncovered \\"malicious code\\" in the ES5 client. By sending a specially-formed request, a remote user could use a facility of the ES5 client in order to delete arbitrary files on the computer of anybody running the ES5 client. Garriok concluded that \\"the people behind ES5 have intentionally added malicious code to ES5\\" and speculated that: :They could be working for the RIAA, MPAA, or a similar organization. Once they have enough users on their ES5 network, they would start deleting all copyrighted files they own which their users are sharing. The users wouldn't know what hit them. ES5 representatives replied and suggested that this ability was an unintended side effect of the program's automatic upgrade functionality and patched it through a software update soon after Garriok's revelation. While there no public evidence of collusion between ES5 and the MPAA or RIAA, speculation about it dogged ES5, sowing seeds of distrust. = Untrue claims exposed = The anonymous authors claimed they were based in a refugee camp in Jenin, though some investigative attempts to locate their headquarters in Jenin were fruitless. Many of the claims behind ES5 were unsubstantiated and untrue. With increased media analysis, especially from the Washington Post, it became clear that ES5 was not what it claimed to be. ES5 was not based in Jenin or even elsewhere in Palestine. Most of the people claimed to be behind ES5 were found to be fabricated, and many of ES5's technical claims were debunked; also, ES5 was not nearly as large as it claimed at several points. ES5 had claimed that the encryption around its system made identifying and blocking traffic from the site impossible. A P2P Watch Dog post demonstrated a method by which packets from ES5 could be identified and blocked. This was quickly put into action in several anti-P2P systems on the market at the time. = Other contributing factors = There were several other reasons that many in the P2P and file-sharing community distrusted ES5. Many speculated that the project was engaging in practices such as seeding and streaming of films from ES5 servers and proxying that would not scale. But as the apparently secretive and untruthful acts of ES5 came to light, the core fan base began to rebel in the main ES5 forum, leading to many users being banned and topics being deleted. Eventually, the forum collapsed and a new forum was started by the admin \\"SharePro.\\" The new forum never gained the popularity that the old one had. = Closing = In February 2005, ES5 quietly closed its doors. On January 24, 2005, Stephen Cohen posted a strange message on the ES5 forums asking users to work with him to reinvent the platform: Within a month, ES5 was completely shut down and dismantled. The ES5 website and forums were taken offline permanently and are today only accessible through the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine.

The operation involved elements of the U.S. 4th Infantry Division (the 'Ivy' Division) and began before dawn, lasting to about mid- morning. The raids during the operation resulted in many arrests of believed guerrilla fighters and suspected terrorists. Operation details The 4th Infantry Division and Task Force Ironhorse initiated Operation Ivy Blizzard, a joint operation with Iraqi security forces within Samarra at the request of local leadership, according to U.S. Central Command officials. The operation is a combined effort to target, isolate and eliminate former regime elements and other anti-Coalition cells that continue to try to destabilize Iraq and intimidate innocent Iraqi citizens who choose freedom over tyranny. Saddam Hussein‚Äôs capture is one of the most significant events in Iraq‚Äôs progress as the country continues to advance towards realizing its potential. However, there are still those who would deny Iraq this opportunity. Operation Ivy Blizzard will target those former regime elements that held power for decades at the expense of Iraq‚Äôs future. Another goal of the operation is for Task Force Ironhorse to engage the Samarran community leadership, identify infrastructure repair priorities, and fund projects to improve quality of life, stimulate economic growth and further strengthen and empower the local government. Operation Ivy Blizzard is a comprehensive, coordinated and offensive regiment of isolation of insurgents and extremists. The purpose of this objective is to deny anti-Coalition elements freedom of movement, communication and organization while providing innocent citizens a stable environment free from reprisals and indiscriminate violence of former regime loyalists. Swift, decisive action will be taken against those who flagrantly disregard the rule of law and commit crimes against the Coalition and their fellow Iraqis. Additional phases of the operation include recruiting and training Iraqi Civil Defense Corps soldiers and local police, and empowering Iraqi governmental leadership in their efforts to successfully transition to a free and democratic society. Ivy Blizzard was launched just days after Operation Red Dawn, which resulted in the capture of Saddam Hussein, which has led some to believe that information that led to Operation Ivy Blizzard may have been obtained from Saddam.

In its most basic form, it simply means a social visit. In contemporary usage, it usually involves dancing and playing Gaelic folk music, either at a house party or a larger concert at a social hall or other community gathering place. C√®ilidhean (plural of c√®ilidh) and c√©ilithe (plural of c√©il√≠) originated in the Gaelic areas of Scotland and Ireland and are consequently common in the Scottish and Irish diasporas. They are similar to the Troyl traditions in Cornwall and Twmpath and Noson Lawen events in Wales, as well as English country dances throughout England which have in some areas undergone a fusion with c√©ilithe. Etymology The term is derived from the Old Irish c√©le (singular) meaning \\"companion\\". It later became c√©ilidhe and c√©ilidh, which means \\"visit\\" in Gaelic. In Scottish Gaelic reformed spelling it is spelled c√®ilidh (plural c√®ilidhean) and in Irish reformed spelling as c√©il√≠ (plural c√©ilithe). History Originally, a ceilidh was a social gathering of any sort, and did not necessarily involve dancing. In more recent decades, the dancing portion of the event has usurped the older meanings of the term, though the tradition of guests performing music, song, story telling and poetry still persists in some areas. Ceilidhs were originally hosted by a fear-an-tigh, meaning \\"man of the house\\". This is still the form in Ireland, though otherwise in modern ceilidhs the host is usually referred to more simply as \\"Host\\" or \\"Master of Ceremonies\\". Modern c√®ilidhs The Northern Constabulary Pipe Band Fundraising C√®ilidh at North Kessock, Scotland C√®ilidhs facilitated courting and prospects of marriage for young people and, although discos and nightclubs have displaced c√®ilidhs to a considerable extent, they are still an important and popular social outlet in rural parts of Ireland and Scotland, especially in the Gaelic-speaking regions. C√®ilidhs are sometimes held on a smaller scale in private or public houses, for example in remote rural areas and during busy festivals. It is common for some clubs and institutions such as sports clubs, schools and universities and even employers to arrange c√®ilidhs on a regular or at least annual basis. The formality of these can vary. Some mix modern pop music with a Scottish country dancing band and dress codes range from compulsory highland dress to informal. Knowledge and use of the basic dance steps is not always strictly necessary, and dances often alternate with songs, poetry recitals, story telling and other types of \\"party pieces\\". C√®ilidh music may be provided by an assortment of instruments including fiddle, flute, tin whistle, accordion, bodhr√°n, hammered dulcimer and in more recent times also drums, guitar, mandolin, bouzouki and electric bass guitar. The music is cheerful and lively, consisting in Ireland mainly of jigs, reels, hornpipes, polkas, slip-jigs and waltzes, with Scotland adding strathspeys, and England adding regional forms such as the northeastern rant. The basic steps can be learned easily; a short instructional session is often provided for new dancers before the start of the dance itself. In Ireland the first c√®ilidh band was put together in 1926 by S√©amus Clandillon, Radio √âireann's director of Music, to have dance music for his studio-based programmes. Dancing at c√®ilidhs is usually in the form of c√®ilidh dances, set dances or couple dances. A \\"set\\" consists of four to eight couples, with each pair of couples facing another in a square or rectangular formation. Each couple exchanges position with the facing couple, and also facing couples exchange partners, while all the time keeping in step with the beat of the music. However, about half of the dances in the modern Scots c√®ilidh are couples' dances performed in a ring. These can be performed by fixed couples or in the more sociable \\"progressive\\" manner, with the lady moving to the next gentleman in the ring at or near the end of each repetition of the steps. In Ireland, the similar style of dance is called c√®ili dance or f√≠or (true) c√®ili dance. Some of the dances are named after famous regiments, historical battles and events, others after items of daily rural life. The \\"Gay Gordons\\", \\"Siege of Ennis\\", \\"The Walls of Limerick\\" and \\"The Stack of Barley\\" are popular dances in this genre. Step dancing is another form of dancing often performed at c√®ilidhs, the form that was popularised in the 1990s by the world-famous Riverdance ensemble. Whereas set dancing involves all present, whatever their skill, step dancing is usually reserved for show, being performed only by the most talented of dancers. The c√®ilidh has been internationalised by the Scottish and Irish diasporas in Canada, the United States, Australia and New Zealand, where local c√®ilidhs and traditional music competitions are held. In recent years, c√®ilidh and traditional music competitions have been frequently won by descendants of emigrants. It bears mention that c√®ilidhs are common throughout Nova Scotia. The tradition and the spirit of these gatherings are carried on in most small communities of these maritime provinces. =In Scotland= Scottish c√®ilidh dancing at the 2003 Smithsonian Folklife Festival (Washington, DC) Privately organised c√®ilidhs are now extremely common in both rural and urban Scotland, where bands are hired, usually for evening entertainment for a wedding, birthday party, celebratory or fundraising event. These may be more or less formal, and very often omit all other traditional Gaelic activity beyond the actual music and dancing. Novices are usually among the participants, so a \\"dance caller\\" may teach the steps before music begins for each dance. The more versatile bands will demonstrate the dances too. Scottish primary schools frequently teach some \\"country dancing\\", often around Christmas time. Bands vary in size but are commonly made up of between 2 and 6 players. The appeal of the Scottish c√®ilidh is by no means limited to the younger generation, and dances vary in speed and complexity to accommodate most age groups and levels of ability. Most private schools in Scotland will also hold c√®ilidhs on a fairly regular basis. Public c√®ilidhs are also held, attracting paying participants. Universities in Scotland hold regular c√®ilidhs, with the University of Edinburgh providing a number for students throughout each term, especially the long-running Highland Annual, the oldest c√®ilidh in Edinburgh and the largest in Scotland, organised by the Highland Society ('An Comann Ceilteach'). Glasgow University Union's annual debating competition, Glasgow Ancients, traditionally ends the night with a c√®ilidh. The Union's Christmas event, Daft Friday also involves a c√®ilidh. C√®ilidhs are common fundraising and social events for many societies at the University of Glasgow. Some c√®ilidh bands intersperse c√®ilidh dancing with a DJ playing disco music to broaden the appeal of the evening's entertainment. =In Northern Ireland= The resurgence in the popularity of the c√©ili (spelled this way in Ireland) over the last 20 years or so in Northern Ireland has been assisted in no small way by the interest in c√©ilis amongst the younger generation. Similar gatherings in England Ceilidh in England has evolved a little differently from its counterparts elsewhere in Britain and Ireland. English ceilidh, sometimes abbreviated to eCeilidh, can be considered part of English Country Dance (and related to Contra). English ceilidh has many things in common with the Scottish and Irish social dance traditions. The dance figures are similar using couples dances, square sets, long sets and circle dances. However, the English style requires a slower tempo of tune accentuating the on-beat, the central instrument often being the English melodeon, a diatonic accordion in the keys of D and G. Dancers often use a skip, a stephop or rant step depending on region. This contrasts with the smoother style and more fluid motion seen in Ireland, Scotland, or (the walking) in Contra. Many ceilidh dances involve a couple, but this does not limit the number of partners any one dancer has during the ceilidh. Often dancers will change partners every dance to meet new people. An important part of English ceilidhs is the \\"caller\\" who instructs the dancer in the next dance. An experienced ceilidh caller will have a good understanding of the mechanics of the tunes and a deep knowledge of regional dances from the UK and beyond. They will confer with the band about what type of tune to play for the dance. This aids the selection of the right dance for the right audience. This skill is so sought after in the south of England that there are callers who are famous in their own right. However, many bands have their own caller, often also an instrumentalist; some have two. During an English ceilidh there is often an interval involving the talents of local Morris or rapper side; this also serves to give bands with older members a rest. It is possible to see many diverse and regionally distinct acts at a modern ceilidh. Acts range from the most traditional, like the Old Swan Band, to the most experimental like the electronic dance music influenced Monster Ceilidh Band. Many other forms of music have been combined with English ceilidh music including; Irish music from the band Phoenix Ceilidh Band; ska from the band Whapweasel; Traditional Jazz from the bands Chalktown and Florida; Funk Fusion from Licence to Ceilidh, Ceilidhography and Climax Ceilidh Band, Rock from the bands Peeping Tom, Aardvark Ceilidh Band, Touchstone and Tickled Pink; West African and Indian influenced music from the band Boka Halattraditional; traditional French music from the band Token Women; traditional Welsh music from Twm Twp; and heavy metal from Glorystrokes.

The game was co-developed by Nintendo (primarily Nintendo EAD, who developed the original game) and the American visual technology group Paradigm Simulation. It was one of three launch titles for the Nintendo 64 in Japan as well as Europe and one of two launch titles in North America. Pilotwings 64 is a follow-up to Pilotwings for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES), which was a North American launch game for its respective console in 1991. Also like that game, Pilotwings 64 received production input from Nintendo producer and EAD General Manager Shigeru Miyamoto. Pilotwings 64 is a 3D amateur flight simulator that puts the player in control of one of six pilots as they try to earn pilot licenses through various forms of aviation. The events are flying an autogyro, using a jet pack, and hang gliding. Several bonus tasks are offered, such as skydiving and a human cannonball test. The game also puts focus on allowing the player to freely explore its detailed 3D environments, most notably a miniature representation of the United States. The game received positive review scores and praise from gaming publications and news sources alike for its visual presentation and flying controls. Similar to its SNES predecessor, Pilotwings 64 serves to demonstrate the graphical capabilities of its gaming hardware. Although the flight simulator did not enjoy the same commercial success as its fellow launch game Super Mario 64, Pilotwings 64 nonetheless went on to sell over one million copies worldwide. Gameplay alt=The screenshot shows a character in a red hang glider descending along an icy river between two snow- covered mountains. Green rings made up of yellow triangles accent the desired path. A radar is displayed at the top right. The character's time is on the top left. The character's speed, number of available photographs, and altitude are displayed at the bottom. Pilotwings 64 is a 3D flight simulator in which the player must complete a variety of missions involving different airborne vehicles and air sports. Before each mission, the player must choose one of six character pilots, each with their own advantages and disadvantages based on factors such as weight. The tests presented to the player require him or her to complete an objective in order to earn a license for the given event. Depending on the mission, points are awarded or deducted based on time, damage, fuel usage, accuracy, softness of landing, and similar criteria. The player is awarded either a bronze, silver, or gold license based on the number of points attained. More difficult tests become available as the player progresses. There are three main events in Pilotwings 64 required to complete the game, each of which has its own objectives and unique flight controls centered around the Nintendo 64 controller's single analog stick. The first, hang gliding, usually requires the player to fly through a series of floating marker rings or snap a photograph of a particular piece of scenery before landing on a target area. The player's movement is affected by wind currents and altitude can be gained by flying through thermal columns. The second event is the \\"Rocket Belt\\", a jet pack that allows the player to move and gain height as well as hover, tilt, and rotate in the air using the belt's equipped thrusters. Goals entail flying through rings, landing on floating platforms or popping large balloons before landing. The third event, the gyrocopter, challenges the player to take off and land on a runway after completing objectives like navigating a path of rings or destroying targets with missiles. Pilotwings 64 also features several bonus events that are unlocked if the player performs well in the main missions. The player can also earn medals in many of these events. They include skydiving, a human cannonball event, and the \\"Jumble Hopper\\", which grants the player special spring-loaded boots to be used in bouncing across the landscape to an end space. Lastly, Pilotwings 64 features a \\"Birdman\\" mode that puts the character in a bird suit and gives players the opportunity to freely explore the game's detailed, object-dense environments set among its four distinct islands. One of the islands is based on the United States, and has geographical replications of famous landmarks including the Statue of Liberty and Mount Rushmore and major cities such as Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York City. Representations of Nintendo characters and many other interesting quirks can be found in the landscapes of the game. Development Pilotwings 64 was co-developed by the Texas-based graphics company Paradigm Simulation and Nintendo's Entertainment Analysis and Development (EAD) and Integrated Research and Development (IRD) divisions. Due to Paradigm's experience with Silicon Graphics workstations, Nintendo contacted the American company in 1994 concerning it becoming one of the Nintendo 64's \\"Dream Team\\" of first developers. Paradigm worked directly with a team at Silicon Graphics and spent nine months developing a technology base for Pilotwings 64 and Paradigm's other Nintendo 64 releases. Development on Pilotwings 64 began in earnest during June 1995, with Nintendo working on the game design and Paradigm working on the technical production. Nintendo's Genyo Takeda and Makoto Wada acted as Paradigm's primary technical and design contacts individually. Wada, the game's director, was also involved in design aspects such as modeling and animation. Shigeru Miyamoto, the producer of Pilotwings for the SNES, reprised his role for Pilotwings 64 and oversaw the project from Japan. Miyamoto's involvement was more removed than with the SNES game due to his simultaneous work on the platformer Super Mario 64. According to Miyamoto, Pilotwings 64 was designed to allow gamers to experience free flight in realistic 3D environments on the Nintendo 64. Prior to the game's conception, Paradigm had worked on military vehicle and flight simulators, but not video games. Dave Gatchel of Paradigm disclosed that with regard to creating the game, they began with a \\"physics-based approach\\", but deviated from this in order to gain a balance between accuracy and fun for players. He indicated that there was never an issue as to whether Pilotwings 64 should be more of an arcade game or a simulation, as their goal was to \\"always have a more arcade feel\\". The technical team studied the original Pilotwings extensively during development. Pilotwings on the SNES makes use of the power of the 16-bit console, principally its Mode 7 capability. Similarly, Pilotwings 64 prominently demonstrates the graphical features of its own console. Gatchel suggested that just as design elements present in the game generated its production requirements, these same elements were influenced by the Nintendo 64's technology during development. The large islands within the game were created using Paradigm's own 3D development tool Vega UltraVision. Navigation of these environments is relatively smooth thanks to Pilotwings 64 taking advantage of several key Nintendo 64 hardware features. Conventional level of detail and mipmapping were used to reduce the computational load of distant landscape objects and terrains when they were rendered. The processes respectively substitute simpler geometrical shapes for more complex ones and less detailed textures for more detailed ones, lowering the polygon count and 3D rendering time for a given frame and thus putting less demand on the geometric engine. Pilotwings 64 also applies z-buffering, which keeps track of an object's depth and tells the graphics processor which portions of the object to render and which to hide. This, along with texture filtering and anti-aliasing, makes the object appear solid and smooth along its edges rather than pixelated. As Nintendo was in charge of its actual game design, they dictated the aircraft and characters that would be present in the game. The six playable pilots in Pilotwings 64 are all named after various birds. The character Lark is modeled after Nester, a mascot for the North American Nintendo Power magazine. The female character Robin is called \\"Hooter\\" in the Japanese version. The soundtrack for Pilotwings 64 was composed and arranged by Dan Hess. The tracks were produced to complement each level, such as a \\"soothing\\" jazz-inspired musical piece played during the exploratory Birdman mode. A now out-of-print CD soundtrack was released by Pony Canyon in Japan on December 16, 1996. Pilotwings 64 was one of thirteen Nintendo 64 games shown at Shoshinkai show in Tokyo in November 1995 when the console was first demonstrated to the public as the \\"Ultra 64\\". The game was later displayed at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) in Los Angeles during May 1996. Reception and legacy Pilotwings 64 was released in Japan on June 23, 1996 as one of three Nintendo 64 launch titles, the other two being Super Mario 64 and Saiky≈ç Habu Sh≈çgi. Pilotwings 64 managed to sell about one unit with about every tenth Nintendo 64 console, with regional sales totaling 136,986 copies by the end of the year. The game was one of two original releases for the system during its September 26, 1996 debut in North America, which was a few days earlier than the date set by Nintendo. While Super Mario 64 initially sold at a one-to-one ratio with each console in the United States, Pilotwings 64 sold an average of one copy with every fourth console. Despite selling out, some store locations for Electronics Boutique and KB Toys reported little or no units of the flight simulator being shipped to retailers. About 90,000 copies of Pilotwings 64 were sold in its first few days on sale in the country, putting the game at number four on the NPD Group sales charts for that September. Pilotwings 64 saw a release in European nations on March 1, 1997, when it was one of three launch games along with Super Mario 64 and Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire. In the United Kingdom, it was listed by Esquire magazine as the \\"cheapest game in Nintendo's frighteningly-priced opening range of titles\\". It was confirmed in early 1998 that the game had sold over one million units worldwide. Pilotwings 64 was well received by most reviewers. The game's combination of 3D graphics, realistic settings, and flight simulation were applauded by many news sources and major gaming publications. In his release review of the Nintendo 64, The Seattle Times contributor Steven L. Kent found that the flight mechanics and vast areas featured in Pilotwings 64 make it one of the most impressive games ever made. Glenn Rubenstein of the website GameSpot summarized, \\"The graphics, sound, control, and all around excitement add up to make Pilotwings 64 one hell of a great ride.\\" Staff reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly, GamePro, and IGN all voiced positive comments on the game's polygon rendering and frame rates, as well as its sense of control and flying. Alex Constantides of Computer and Video Games enjoyed the game's large environments, exclaiming, \\"You'll not believe just how huge the islands really are and, because certain elements are hidden at first, it'll take you months to see everything.\\" IGN's Levi Buchanan described this low-pressure, \\"challenge without competition\\" aspect of the game as a design philosophy adopted by later Nintendo titles such as Nintendogs. Rich Leadbetter of Maximum said that \\"The sedate nature of the gameplay might not appeal to everyone, but the bottom line is that PilotWings 64 is an unparalleled test of skill, dexterity and control. It is a game that you must own and whilst not quite in the same league of 'must-have'itude as Super Mario 64, it remains an astounding achievement and another triumph for Nintendo.\\" A Next Generation critic remarked that once beyond the introductory missions the game becomes satisfyingly challenging, and succeeds as both a flight simulation and an example of Nintendo's surrealistic gameplay: \\"It's a weird mix of total realism and self-conscious videogame elements, and the two don't grate.\\" Pilotwings 64 has been criticized for lacking innovative gameplay. The New York Times writer Ashley Dunn characterized the game's E3 demonstration as \\"brain-dead\\" in its gameplay and suggested that even young children would rather fly a dragon on the Sony PlayStation. Game Revolution issued Pilotwings 64 a particularly harsh review score, declaring the game to be nothing more than a graphical showcase for those with nothing better to do. The sound effects present in the game were impressive to several reviewers, but the soundtrack has been negatively compared to lounge music and porn groove, although the 'Birdman' track was highly rated. Electronic Gaming Monthly awarded Pilotwings 64 Flying Game of the Year, explaining that it \\"showed how fun flying could be and demonstrated that there is more than one way to get from here to there. Fun, variety and easy-paced action gave PW64 this award.\\" Pilotwings 64 was ranked number 38 in Nintendo Power's \\"100 Best Nintendo Games of All Time\\" in its landmark 100th issue in September 1997. In February 2006, it was rated the 117th best game made on a Nintendo system in the magazine's \\"Top 200 Games\\" list for its 200th issue. In July 2007, the United Kingdom video game magazine Edge included Pilotwings 64 at number 69 on its own \\"Top 100 Games\\" list. The UK's Official Nintendo Magazine listed it at number 40 on its \\"100 Best Nintendo Games\\" in February 2009. Paradigm announced at E3 1997 that they were producing a Nintendo 64 sequel to Pilotwings 64. However, even though Nintendo expressed interest in Paradigm's early presentations, the game was cancelled because Nintendo did not have the resources to aid in its development at that time. There were rumors of a sequel on the Nintendo GameCube and later the Wii, development courtesy of Factor 5, but no game was ever shown. After their briefing time at E3 2010, Nintendo announced a sequel titled Pilotwings Resort for the Nintendo 3DS, which was released as a launch title for the handheld console.

It stars Paul Newman, Brigitte Fossey, Bibi Andersson, Fernando Rey, Vittorio Gassman and Nina Van Pallandt. Plot The story takes place during a new ice age. The camera tracks a blank, frozen, seemingly deserted tundra until two blurry, distant figures can just be made out. They are the seal hunter Essex (Paul Newman) and his pregnant companion, Vivia (Brigitte Fossey), the daughter of one of Essex's late hunting partners. They are traveling north, where Essex hopes to reunite with his brother, Francha (Thomas Hill). Essex and Vivia eventually find Francha's apartment, but the reunion is short-lived. While Essex is out buying firewood, a gambler named Redstone (Craig Richard Nelson) throws a bomb into Francha's apartment, killing everyone inside, including Vivia. Essex sees Redstone fleeing the scene and chases him to the sector's \\"Information Room.\\" Essex witnesses the murder of Redstone by an Italian gambler named St. Christopher (Vittorio Gassman). When St. Christopher leaves, Essex searches Redstone's pockets and finds a piece of paper with a list of names: Francha, Redstone, Goldstar, Deuca, St. Christopher, and Ambrosia. Puzzled by the mystery, Essex discovers that Redstone had previously checked into the Hotel Electra, a gambling resort in another sector. He visits the hotel and assumes Redstone's identity. Immediately after checking in, Essex is given an unexpected welcome by Grigor (Fernando Rey), who is the dealer in the casino. Insisting that he means no harm, Grigor invites Essex (as \\"Redstone\\") to the casino, where gamblers are now heavily involved in a \\"Quintet\\" tournament. While there he meets Ambrosia (Bibi Andersson), who always assumes the role of the \\"sixth player\\" in the game. Essex is unaware that the current Quintet tournament is a fight for the survival of the fittest. Those who are \\"killed\\" in game are executed in real life. Grigor and St. Christopher are aware that Essex is not the real Redstone, so they ignore him and focus on the other players. Goldstar (David Langton) is the first killed, followed by Deuca (Nina Van Pallandt), until the only two players left are St. Christopher and Ambrosia. Ambrosia, however, insists that Essex be counted as a player in the game since he has assumed Redstone's identity. Grigor agrees and informs St. Christopher that he has to eliminate Essex before he can face off against Ambrosia. Essex and St. Christopher have a showdown outside the city, where St. Christopher is killed by falling into a rupture of the ice sheet. Essex returns to Francha's apartment and finds the same list that Redstone had. Ambrosia follows Essex to the apartment. Essex slits her throat moments before her attempt to slit his throat. Returning to the Hotel Electra to cremate Ambrosia's body, Essex confronts Grigor to demand his \\"prize\\", since he was the winner of Quintet. Grigor reveals that the only prize is the thrill of the game itself. Grigor insists he stay and participate in future tournaments, but a disgusted Essex condemns Quintet and leaves the hotel for good. The film ends with Essex taking a long walk out into the barren distance.

Film Comment14.5 (Sep/Oct 1978): 15-18,80. Quintet was filmed in early 1978 on the site of Montreal's Expo 67 world's fair. The extreme cold made the shoot challenging for the cast and crew. The soundtrack was recorded by the New York Philharmonic. At the time of the film's release, 20th Century Fox President Alan Ladd Jr. told Variety that Altman was not given final cut on what he termed \\"a complicated picture.\\"Neff, Andrew J.

Reception According to a report in Daily Variety, the film was \\"a financial disaster.\\" Reviews were mostly negative. Roger Ebert gave the film two stars out of four, calling it \\"a puzzlement, and not a very interesting one.\\" Gene Siskel awarded one-and-a-half stars out of four, writing \\"These are metaphors that college filmmakers wouldn't consider making into movies, but Altman somehow considers this profound.

Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote \\"Quintet is depressing not because it's about the end of the world, but because its artistic vision is feeble.

The Washington Post. D1. Pauline Kael of The New Yorker lamented that Altman was \\"giving weight to scenes that he would have treated as comedy skits only a few years ago ... with dialogue such as the diabolical Gassman's 'Hope is an obsolete word,' contrasted with the inspirational music as Newman presses on northward, it's like a Monty Python show played at the wrong speed.\\"Kael, Pauline (February 26, 1979). \\"The Current Cinema\\". The New Yorker. 100-101. Charles Champlin of the Los Angeles Times, however, wrote in a positive review: \\"It invites easy charges that it is self-indulgent and pretentious.

Los Angeles Times. Part IV, p. 1. Jack Kroll wrote in Newsweek: \\"It's clear that the game of Quintet is Altman's metaphor for the erosion of art, philosophy and the humane activities of civilization. That's one of the weaknesses of the film - the game itself can't bear this symbolic weight ...

Valencia is a neighborhood in Santa Clarita located within Los Angeles County, California, United States. It is the most populous of the four unincorporated communities (along with Saugus, Newhall, and Canyon Country) that merged to create the city of Santa Clarita in 1987. It is situated centrally in the now-City of Santa Clarita, running from Newhall to the south (below Lyons Avenue) to north of Copper Hill Drive. Valencia was founded as a master-planned community with the first development, Old Orchard I, built on Lyons Avenue behind the Old Orchard Elementary.http://www.oldorchard1.org/ History In 1769, the Spanish Portola expedition, the first Europeans to see inland areas of California, came up and over the pass from the San Fernando Valley and camped near the river on August 8‚Äì9. They found a large native village there and witnessed a wedding celebration. Fray Juan Crespi, a Franciscan missionary travelling with the expedition, named the river \\"Santa Clara\\" and noted in his diary that the place would be a good location for a mission. On the return trip, however, the party found a less strenuous trail through Conejo Valley. Later travelers also preferred that route, and Mission San Fernando Rey de Espa√±a was established down in the valley. The master planned portion of Valencia was first planned in the 1960s by the Newhall Land and Farming Company. Development began in 1967, continues to the present day, and is nearing completion. Valencia is notable for its landscaped boulevards connecting a mix of apartment buildings, single-family detached homes, shopping centers, office parks and industrial warehouses. Major schools in Santa Clarita include California Institute of the Arts, College of the Canyons, Hart High School, West Ranch High School, Saugus High School, Canyon High School, Golden Valley High School and Valencia High School. Community Valencia's residential areas are separated into villages, each with its own lifestyle (see List of Valencia, California residential villages). Almost all of Valencia's villages are close to schools, shopping, and other amenities. In many of the villages, homeowner associations oversee the quality and upkeep of housing developments ranging in size from a few dozen homes to over a thousand. Many villages also have a neighborhood watch program in force. Valencia also has a system of paved pathways over or under the streets and boulevards, which are called paseos. They connect the entire community, making it possible to travel throughout nearly all of Valencia on foot or by bicycle without crossing a street at grade level. The paseo network is connected to the Santa Clara River Trail which runs east along the Santa Clara River to Canyon Country. As of 2010, the estimated population of the 91354 ZIP code was 28,722 and the estimated median household income was $111,098; the estimated population of the 91355 ZIP code was 32,605 and the estimated median household income was $89,596.

In the game's 57 levels, the player solves puzzles by transferring between vehicles to move objects and bridge gaps. It was released in March 1997 in Japan and North America. A wider release followed at the end of that year. The game was among Rare's first for the Nintendo 64. Its development team ranged between four and seven members, many of whom were recent graduates. The team sought to find gameplay to fit Rare co-founder Chris Stamper's idea for a building destruction game. The puzzle game mechanics were inspired by those of Donkey Kong (1994). Blast Corps was released to universal acclaim and received Metacritic's second highest Nintendo 64 ratings of 1997. The game sold one million copies‚Äîlower than the team's expectations‚Äîand received several editor's choice awards. Reviewers highly praised its originality, variety, and graphics, but some critiqued its controls and repetition. Reviewers of Rare's 2015 Rare Replay retrospective compilation noted Blast Corps as a standout title.  Gameplay  Screenshot of gameplay in which the player uses a bulldozer to clear a path for the carrier. Radar and an arrow in the lower-left corner show the proximity of objects in the carrier's way. Blast Corps is a single-player action video game. The player controls vehicles to destroy buildings, farms, and other structures in the path of a runaway nuclear missile carrier. The player fails if the carrier collides with an object. The eight demolition vehicles vary in the way they clear structures: the bulldozer rams, the dump truck drifts, the lightweight buggy crashes from higher ground, the tricycle shoots missiles, another truck presses outwards from its sides, and robot mechs tumble and stomp from the land and the air. The player must transfer between vehicles and other machinery to solve puzzles. Objectives include transporting timed explosive crates and bridging gaps. The game's puzzles increase in difficulty as the player progresses through its 57 levels. The world is portrayed from a three-quarters overhead view. The player can adjust the game's viewable perspective with zoom and horizontal panning functions. Pop-up hints will guide the player in the early stages of the game, and other characters audibly encourage the player as each level wears on. The cheery soundtrack increases in tempo as the level's timer runs low. After completing a level, the player can return to explore without a time limit. By finding secrets and activating lights throughout the level, the player raises their score and final medal ranking. There are also secret levels hidden throughout the game, where the player completes objectives against the clock. The player can compete against a ghost copy of their previous path through a level. There are no settings to change the game's difficulty, and the game saves to both the game cartridge itself and external storage.  Development  Blast Corps was among Rare's first games for the Nintendo 64 and led a run of seven critically acclaimed Rare titles for the console. The game's production began in early 1996. The development team consisted of four recent graduates, though it expanded at times to seven concurrent staff. Martin Wakeley became the game's lead designer. He credited the team's small size for their easy progression from planning to market. Rare founder Chris Stamper was the impetus for the project. He had wanted to make a game about destroying buildings for years prior to Blast Corps development. The team worked to fit his idea to a gameplay concept and devised a \\"Constantly Moving Object\\" conceit that would give the levels a time limit. This idea became the nuclear missile carrier. Blast Corps led a set of seven critically acclaimed Rare titles developed for the Nintendo 64. Retro Gamer credited Wakeley for Blast Corps idiosyncratic ideas and humor in light of the game's serious premise. For instance, the Mario Kart 64 \\"power slide\\" drift mechanics inspired that of Blast Corps dump truck. Wakeley championed the drift controls against the rest of the team, who found them aggravating. The game's lead artist, Ricky Berwick, had developed the vehicle concepts without consideration for their in-game function, and the vehicles were only later retrofitted to the gameplay. One of the robot vehicles was designed without an arm because the developers had run out of computer memory to store the data and liked the look anyway. Wakeley determined the game's high score \\"goal medal\\" objectives, in which players would attempt to better a set completion time on each level. Blast Corps Japanese and American quality assurance teams later competed to push the levels to their limits, which resulted in the game's platinum level objectives. Wakeley described these platinum challenges as \\"just insane\\" and said he could only finish four himself. Wakeley saw Blast Corps as a puzzle game at its core. He was influenced by the 1994 Donkey Kong, in which the player begins each level with all the tools they need to finish but must learn how to use them. Wakeley said this was Blast Corp core game mechanic. He was also inspired by the Super Mario 64 demo at the 1995 Space World, which introduced him to the 3D analog stick and spurred him achieve something similar. The team's technical accomplishments included character and environment models composed completely of polygons and the absence of distance fog to obscure the draw distance. Nintendo published Blast Corps for their Nintendo 64. It was originally titled Blast Dozer in its 1995 Shoshinkai preview, a name it retained for its Japanese release. (The team had considered other titles, including \\"Heavy Duty Heroes\\", \\"Blast Radius\\", and \\"Power Dozer\\".) Blast Corps was first released in Japan on March 21, 1997, and in North America three days later. Its European and Australian release followed on December 22. The game had been in production for just over a year.  Reception  The game received \\"universal acclaim\\", according to video game review aggregator Metacritic, and \\"unanimous critical success\\", according to Retro Gamer. Reviewers highly praised the novelty and variety of Blast Corps gameplay. Peer Schneider (IGN), in particular, lauded the game's originality in an industry hesitant to take risks. Trent Ward commented in GameSpot that the premise taps into childhood fantasies, while \\"the unique relationship between the terrain and the vehicles you pilot ensures that Blast Corps will exercise your mind as well as your reflexes.\\" Reviewers struggled to master the game's controls. GamePros Slo Mo praised this aspect of the game, saying that even mastering the extreme precision of the steering is fun, and rewards the player with both better gameplay technique and an appreciation for the strong distinction between the game's many vehicles. Schneider likewise overcame his initial concerns to appreciate the complexity of the controls and the differences between the vehicles. He considered the locked camera view restrictive when compared to the unrestricted 3D camera in the game's contemporaries. Schneider thought the game should have been longer, with fewer bonus levels and more main missions, though he did appreciate the pacing, design, and difficulty of the included levels. Slo Mo instead asserted that \\"Over 60 levels and hidden areas within hidden areas give you your money's worth\\". A Next Generation critic agreed, asserting that the vast size of the levels and numerous secrets and bonus areas make Blast Corps \\"one of the few Nintendo 64 games that justifies its exorbitant price tag.\\" Shawn Smith and Sushi-X of Electronic Gaming Monthly (EGM) thought the game was repetitive, as did Computer and Video Games. The latter, though, praised Blast Corps level design and difficulty progression. Ward had fewer reservations, writing that \\"basically what you have here is a game with great graphics, great sound, and a great premise. What's even more impressive is that the game doesn't really have any substantial flaws to speak of - unless you want to count lack of a two-player mode, which really isn't fair.\\" Crispin Boyer of EGM wrote that the game's best feature was its \\"palpable sense of suspense\\" as the carrier advanced on resistant buildings. Critics praised the game's graphics and sound. Schneider found the game unpretentious in comparison to video game trends of photorealistic rendering and cartoonish art. He likened the slick vehicle animations and metallic elements to Micro Machines and Rare's R.C. Pro-Am. Schneider praised the game's texture maps, which made the night scenes and houses look realistic, and the canyons breathtaking. He wrote that the game's 3D programming was errorless, and was particularly pleased about the game's lack of fog, usually used to cover developer limitations. EGM echoed Schneider's praise of the deep landscapes, which Boyer called \\"incredible\\". Scott McCall (AllGame) praised the game's realistic polygonal models and technical prowess, and Steve Polak (The Weekend Australian) wrote that Blast Corps showcased the console's graphics capabilities. Schneider described the soundtrack as between \\"70s pop, disaster movie score, and Country Bear Jamboree\\". He praised the range of engine, tire screeching, and crashing sound effects. Reviewers disliked the country music tracks with jaw harp. IGN wrote that Blast Corps exemplified qualities of enjoyable Nintendo Entertainment System and arcade games, while EGM considered the game unlike all others. Retro Gamer wrote that the game's combination of puzzles and continuous destruction made the game so unique as to defy genre classification. The magazine described the gameplay concept of returning to explore without a time limit as \\"a stroke of genius\\". Retro Gamer thought of Blast Corps as a 3D successor to \\"nail-biting reaction games\\" such as Loco-Motion. Computer and Video Games agreed with a reader that Blast Corps was part of a \\"Destroy\\" subgenre including games like Desert Strike, Return Fire, and Body Harvest, and Matt Fox of The Video Games Guide put the game in a lineage with Highway Encounter and Lunar Jetman. Slo Mo said it was \\"like Pilotwings with a kamikaze twist. It's a multifaceted game that melds a slick vehicle sim and a mind-thumping action/strategy challenge with massive destructive force.\\" Schneider said Blast Corps was on par with the quality of Shigeru Miyamoto games and an excellent display of Rare's potential. Next Generation described it as \\"effectively every Tonka fantasy brought vividly and explosively to life.\\" Blast Corps sold one million copies, which was fewer than Rare had expected. The game was most successful in Japan. Metacritic ranked the title among the top ten games released in 1997. It remained Metacritic's highest ranked 1997 Nintendo 64 game after GoldenEye 007. Blast Corps was selected as Electronic Gaming Monthly May 1997 Game of the Month and an IGN Editors' Choice. Later the same year, Electronic Gaming Monthly ranked it number 93 on their 100 best console video games of all time, remarking, \\"C'mon, not only are you driving all the vehicles you thought were mega cool as a kid - you're using 'em to plow through buildings.\\" Note: Contrary to the title, the intro to the article explicitly states that the list covers console video games only, meaning PC games and arcade games were not eligible. Four of six Nintendo Power reviewers recommended the game.  Legacy  Wakeley, the game's designer, considered making a sequel as an action combat game, but thought the concepts behind Blast Corps had been fully exhausted. After praising the game in a 2010 Rare retrospective feature, Retro Gamer writers craved a sequel. The magazine said the title was proof of the company's inventiveness. Steve Ellis, who was a programmer at Rare, thought Blast Corps to be among the company's most underrated games, and though its physics were now dated, he continued to find the game fun enough to revisit regularly. Blast Corps is included in Rare Replay, a compilation of 30 Rare titles, released on the Xbox One on August 4, 2015. The release's bonus features included behind-the-scenes interviews with Blast Corps developers. Blast Corps was a standout favorite among Rare Replay reviewers. Rare's Blast Corps began a run of seven highly lauded and respected Nintendo 64 games, including GoldenEye 007, Banjo-Kazooie, Perfect Dark, and Jet Force Gemini. Retro Gamer wrote that Rare had doubled the number of classic Nintendo 64 games and was an important alliance for Nintendo. Microsoft acquired Rare in 2002 for a record price of $377 million. The industry had changed, Blast Corps designer Martin Wakeley reflected a decade after the game's 1997 release. In 2009, Wakeley said, a studio would rarely entrust the scope of a project like Blast Corps to a team of four recent graduates. The staff of Nintendo Power (1997) and IGN (2014) both listed Blast Corps in the bottom halves of their top 100 Nintendo games of all time.

She was said to have lived during the end of the Spring and Autumn period in Zhuji, the capital of the ancient State of Yue. In traditional stories, Xi Shi was named Shi Yiguang (ÊñΩÂ§∑ÂÖâ).Âè§‰ª£Á¨îËÆ∞‰∏≠ÁöÑË•øÊñΩÂΩíÂÆø‰πã‰∫â She was discovered by the Yue minister Fan Li and given to King Fuchai of Wu by King Goujian of Yue in a sexpionage operation which successfully brought down the State of Wu in 473 BC. This account first appeared in Spring and Autumn Annals of Wu and Yue published five centuries after the conquest, and is completely absent in earlier works such as Guoyu, Zuo zhuan, and Records of the Grand Historian. Appearance Xi Shi's beauty was said to be so extreme that while leaning over a balcony to look at the fish in the pond, the fish would be so dazzled that they forgot to swim and sank below the surface. This description serves as the meaning behind the first two characters of the Chinese idiom Ê≤âÈ≠öËêΩÈõÅ, ÈñâÊúàÁæûËä± (), referring to the Four Beauties which is used to compliment a woman's beauty, meaning one so beautiful she sinks fish and entices birds to fall, eclipses the moon and shames flowers, (literally 'Fish dive/Goose fall, Moon hide/Flower shame'). Story of Xi Shi King Goujian of Yue was once imprisoned by King Fuchai of Wu after a defeat in war, and Yue later became a tributary state to Wu. Secretly planning his revenge, Goujian's minister Wen Zhong suggested training beautiful women and offering them to Fuchai as a tribute (knowing Fuchai could not resist beautiful women). His other minister, Fan Li, found Xi Shi and Zheng Dan, and gave them to Fuchai in 490 BC. Bewitched by the beauty and kindness of Xi Shi and Zheng Dan, Fuchai forgot all about his state affairs and at their instigation, killed his best advisor, the great general Wu Zixu. Fuchai even built Guanwa Palace (Palace of Beautiful Women) in an imperial park on the slope of Lingyan Hill, about west of Suzhou. The strength of Wu dwindled, and in 473 BC Goujian launched his strike and completely routed the Wu army. King Fuchai lamented that he should have listened to Wu Zixu, and then committed suicide. In the legend, after the fall of Wu, Fan Li (ËåÉË†°) retired from his ministerial post and lived with Xi Shi on a fishing boat, roaming like fairies in the misty wilderness of Taihu Lake, and no one saw them ever again. This is according to Yuan Kang's Yue Jueshu (Ë∂äÁªù‰π¶). Another version, according to Mozi, is that Xi Shi later died from drowning in the river. Influence The Xi Shi Temple, which lies at the foot of the Zhu Luo Hill (ËãéËêù) in the southern part of Xiaoshan, on the banks of the Huansha River. The West Lake in Hangzhou is said to be the incarnation of Xi Shi, hence it is also called Xizi Lake, Xizi being another name for Xi Shi, meaning Lady Xi. In his famous work of Song poetry, Drinks at West Lake through Sunshine and Rain (È£≤Êπñ‰∏äÂàùÁùõÂ±ÖÈõ®), renowned scholar Su Shi compared Xi Shi's beauty to the West Lake. Li Bai of the Tang dynasty wrote a poem about Xi Shi. Xi Shi is mentioned in the novel Journey to the West, as a sign of grace and beauty. Xi Shi appears in the wuxia short story by Jin Yong (Louis Cha), \\"Sword of the Yue Maiden\\". Her name also inspired the modern name of the Shih Tzu, whose Chinese name translates to \\"Xi Shi dog\\", but whose English name has been claimed to come from the word for \\"lion\\". The moniker \\"lion dog\\" in Chinese is actually reserved for the Pekingese.

He was the Church of Sweden Archbishop of Uppsala between 1914 and 1931, and recipient of the 1930 Nobel Peace Prize. He is commemorated in the Calendar of Saints of the Lutheran Church and in the liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church (USA) on July 12. Biography S√∂derblom was born in the village of Tr√∂n√∂ in S√∂derhamn Municipality, G√§vleborg County. His father was a parish priest. He enrolled at Uppsala University in 1883. Although not initially convinced what he wanted to study, he eventually decided to follow in his father's footsteps. On returning from a journey to the U.S., he was ordained priest in 1893. During the years 1892 and 1893, S√∂derblom was first vice president and then president of the Uppsala Student Union. From 1894 until 1901, he held a ministry at the Swedish Embassy in Paris, where his congregation included both Alfred Nobel (1833‚Äì1896) and August Strindberg (1849‚Äì1912). In 1897, he conducted the memorial service following the death of Alfred Nobel. From 1901 to 1914, S√∂derblom held a chair in the School of Theology at Uppsala University and from 1912 to 1914 was also a professor of Religious studies at Leipzig University. In 1914, he was elected as Archbishop of Uppsala, the head of the Lutheran church in Sweden. During the First World War, he called on all Christian leaders to work for peace and justice while working to alleviate the conditions of prisoners of war and refugees. He believed that church unity had the specific purpose of presenting the gospel to the world and that the messages of Jesus were relevant to social life. His leadership of the Christian \\"Life and Work\\" movement in the 1920s has led him to be recognised as one of the principal founders of the ecumenical movement. He had begun the movement toward intercommunion between the Church of Sweden and the Church of England and was a close associate of the English ecumenist George Bell (1883‚Äì1958), Dean of Canterbury, Bishop of Chichester. He was instrumental in chairing the World Conference of Life and Work in Stockholm, in 1925. In 1930 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.

The group performed music in both Welsh and English, and they had eight Top 75 singles on the UK Singles Chart during their career. They were prominent during the era known as Cool Cymru. The group disbanded in May 2006. Biography The group was formed by Euros Childs (vocals and keyboards), John Lawrence (vocals and guitar) and Richard James (bass guitar) whilst still at Bro Myrddin Welsh Comprehensive School in Carmarthen. Beyond their main roles in the band, all three were multi- instrumentalists and often swapped around instruments both in the studio and onstage. With Sion Lane (keyboards) and Steffan Cravos (violin) added to the lineup, Gorky's recorded the self-released cassette Allumette (1991). Sion and Steffan left shortly afterwards (the latter going on to form Welsh-language rap group Tystion) and drummer Osian Evans was recruited for second cassette Peiriant Pleser (1992). Euros Childs' sister Megan Childs (violin) subsequently joined the group and the band signed to the Welsh record label Ankst. The band's first release for the label was Patio (1992), a 10\\" collection of various live, home and studio recordings (this was later expanded for the 1995 CD version) which John Cale once proclaimed to be his 'favourite album ever'. Gorky's also released a number of singles and EPs on Ankst, demonstrating a taste for psychedelia and playfulness evidently inspired by the Canterbury scene of the 1960s and 1970s (Kevin Ayers' album Shooting at the Moon is cited in the notes to Tatay as \\"the best LP of all time\\", and the record also includes a version of Robert Wyatt's \\"O, Caroline\\"). The band began to be championed by BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel (other than that, it was extremely rare to hear Welsh-language music on such a station). In 1994 Gorky's released their first full studio album, Tatay. By 1995, Euros Rowlands had replaced Osian Evans on drums in time to record a second album ‚Äì Bwyd Time ‚Äì which featured a wide range of instrumentation (such as the parts for the celesta and sitar credited on \\"Iechyd Da\\"). Both albums were produced by Alan Holmes who also provided their colourful artwork. These early releases show a huge range of influences and styles: \\"Thema o Cartref\\", the opening track of Tatay, for example, is a relatively gentle harmonium-backed song, while \\"When You Hear the Captain Sing\\" appears to be a tribute of sorts to Captain Beefheart and \\"Amsermaemaiyndod/cinema\\" presents one song in the right channel and a completely different one in the left. The 1996 compilation Introducing Gorky's Zygotic Mynci (the band's first release in America) compiled material from the Ankst album and singles and summed up this phase of Gorky's career. Now attracting the interest of larger record labels, Gorky's left Ankst and signed to Fontana Records. Their next album, Barafundle (1997), was produced by Gorwel Owen who had also worked with the Super Furry Animals. The wide-ranging instrumentation remained (\\"Diamond Dew\\" has a prominent part for the jaw harp) and there were still psychedelic touches, but the album as a whole was more laid back than their earlier work, tending more towards folk music. This gentler direction was largely maintained and refined in their later records, though the occasional poppier and rockier number, such as \\"Poodle Rockin'\\" from Spanish Dance Troupe or \\"Mow the Lawn\\" from Sleep/Holiday, continued to crop up. Following their fifth album ‚Äì 1998's appropriately-titled Gorky 5, which was released on Fontana's sister label Mercury Records ‚Äì the band were dropped by Fontana. They quickly signed to Mantra Recordings (a division of the Beggars' Banquet label). In 1999, Gorky's released their first album for Mantra, Spanish Dance Troupe. This would be the last Gorky's album to feature input from founder member John Lawrence, who left the group during the recording sessions. Richard James took on Lawrence's former role of main guitarist, and Gorky's also recruited former Ffa Coffi Pawb member Rhodri Puw as a sideman to play guitar and bass guitar on tour. In 2000, Gorky's appeared with John Cale in a movie called Beautiful Mistake, in which they performed 1994 album track \\"O Caroline II\\". In the same year, the band released an acoustic mini-album called The Blue Trees in 2000, after which drummer Euros Rowlands left Gorky's to take up a career in teaching. Rowlands was replaced by former Topper drummer Peter Richardson, and at around the same time Rhodri Puw was confirmed as being a full member of the band. This lineup of Gorky's recorded and toured two more albums ‚Äì How I Long to Feel That Summer in My Heart (2001) and Sleep/Holiday (2003, on the Sanctuary Music label). The latter would prove to be the final Gorky's Zygotic Mynci album. Although Euros Childs and Richard James would spend time working on separate projects for a while, the band did not announce their formal split until May 2006. In 2010 Richard James and Euros Childs performed at Dan Rebellato's wedding, with him later telling Lauren Laverne via Twitter, \\"We somehow got Gorky's Zygotic Mynci to reform and play our wedding last year, so it was wall-to-wall musical awesomeness\\". They've also collaborated on other short-term occasions, such as the online music video series \\"Outside My House\\" (2014). James and the Childs siblings also performed at the Charlotte Greig memorial concert in Cardiff in 2014. Origin of the band name While in the band, Childs said that one of the most frequent questions he was asked was about the origin of the band's name. After struggling to come up with one, they decided \\"we might as well stick with the most ridiculous crap name we could think of.\\" Gorky's came from the word \\"gawky\\"; Lawrence says that \\"gork\\" was school slang for a dimwit. Zygotic was \\"hijacked from GCSE biology\\"; it refers to the state of being like a zygote ‚Äì a fertilized egg cell. Mynci is a spelling of the word \\"monkey\\" using Welsh spelling rules, rather than a direct Welsh translation, and is pronounced like \\"monkey\\".

Bursts of energy moving out along the relativistic jets emitted from these objects can have a proper motion that appears greater than the speed of light. All of these sources are thought to contain a black hole, responsible for the ejection of mass at high velocities. Light echoes can also produce apparent superluminal motion. Explanation This phenomenon is caused by the jets traveling very near the speed of light towards the observer. Because the high-velocity jets are emitting light at every point of their path, the light they emit does not approach the observer much more quickly than the jet itself. This causes the light emitted over hundreds of years of the jet's travel to not have hundreds of light-years of distance between its front end (the earliest light emitted) and its back end (the latest light emitted); the complete \\"light-train\\" thus arrives at the observer over a much smaller time period (ten or twenty years), giving the illusion of faster-than-light travel. to explain the degree of superluminal motion seen in a particular case.See http://www.mhhe.com/physsci/astronomy/fix/student/chapter24/24f10.html for a graph of angle versus apparent speeds for two given actual relativistic speeds. Superluminal motion is often seen in two opposing jets, one moving away and one toward Earth. If Doppler shifts are observed in both sources, the velocity and the distance can be determined independently of other observations. =Some contrary evidence= As early as 1983, at the \\"superluminal workshop\\" held at Jodrell Bank Observatory, referring to the seven then-known superluminal jets, > Schilizzi ... presented maps of arc-second resolution [showing the large- > scale outer jets] ... which ... have revealed outer double structure in all > but one (3C 273) of the known superluminal sources. An embarrassment is that > the average projected size [on the sky] of the outer structure is no smaller > than that of the normal radio-source population. In other words, the jets are evidently not, on average, close to our line-of- sight. (Their apparent length would appear much shorter if they were.) In 1993, Thomson et al. suggested that the (outer) jet of the quasar 3C 273 is nearly collinear to our line-of-sight. Superluminal motion of up to ~9.6c has been observed along the (inner) jet of this quasar.;; Superluminal motion of up to 6c has been observed in the inner parts of the jet of M87. To explain this in terms of the \\"narrow-angle\\" model, the jet must be no more than 19¬∞ from our line-of-sight. ; But evidence suggests that the jet is in fact at about 43¬∞ to our line-of-sight. The same group of scientists later revised that finding and argue in favour of a superluminal bulk movement in which the jet is embedded. Suggestions of turbulence and/or \\"wide cones\\" in the inner parts of the jets have been put forward to try to counter such problems, and there seems to be some evidence for this. Signal velocity The model identifies a difference between the information carried by the wave at its signal velocity c, and the information about the wave front's apparent rate of change of position. If a light pulse is envisaged in a wave guide (glass tube) moving across an observer's field of view, the pulse can only move at c through the guide. If that pulse is also directed towards the observer, he will receive that wave information, at c. If the wave guide is moved in the same direction as the pulse, the information on its position, passed to the observer as lateral emissions from the pulse, changes. He may see the rate of change of position as apparently representing motion faster than c when calculated, like the edge of a shadow across a curved surface. This is a different signal, containing different information, to the pulse and does not break the second postulate of special relativity. c is strictly maintained in all local fields. Derivation of the apparent velocity A relativistic jet coming out of the center of an active galactic nucleus is moving along AB with a velocity v. We are observing the jet from the point O. At time t_1 a light ray leaves the jet from point A and another ray leaves at time t_2=t_1+\\\\delta t from point B. Observer at O receives the rays at time t_1^\\\\prime and t_2^\\\\prime respectively.

And of course \\\\beta_\\\\text{T} > 1 means that the apparent transverse velocity along CB, the only velocity on the sky that we can measure, is larger than the velocity of light in vacuum, i.e. the motion is apparently superluminal. History Superluminal motion was first observed in 1902 by Jacobus Kapteyn in the ejecta of the nova GK Persei, which had exploded in 1901.http://iopscience.iop.org/1538-4357/600/1/L63/fulltext/ His discovery was published in the German journal Astronomische Nachrichten, and received little attention from English-speaking astronomers until many decades later.Kapteyn's paperIndex of citations to Kapteyn's paper In 1966 Martin Rees pointed out that \\"an object moving relativistically in suitable directions may appear to a distant observer to have a transverse velocity much greater than the velocity of light\\". In 1969 and 1970 such sources were found as very distant astronomical radio sources, such as radio galaxies and quasars, and were called superluminal sources. The discovery was the result of a new technique called Very Long Baseline Interferometry, which allowed astronomers to set limits to the angular size of components and to determine positions to better than milli-arcseconds, and in particular to determine the change in positions on the sky, called proper motions, in a timespan of typically years. The apparent velocity is obtained by multiplying the observed proper motion by the distance, which could be up to 6 times the speed of light. In the introduction to a workshop on superluminal radio sources, Pearson and Zensus reported > The first indications of changes in the structure of some sources were > obtained by an American-Australian team in a series of transpacific VLBI > observations between 1968 and 1970 (Gubbay et al. 1969). Following the early > experiments, they had realised the potential of the NASA tracking antennas > for VLBI measurements and set up an interferometer operating between > California and Australia. The change in the source visibility that they > measured for 3C 279, combined with changes in total flux density, indicated > that a component first seen in 1969 had reached a diameter of about 1 > milliarcsecond, implying expansion at an apparent velocity of at least twice > the speed of light. Aware of Rees's model, (Moffet et al. 1972) concluded > that their measurement presented evidence for relativistic expansion of this > component. This interpretation, although by no means unique, was later > confirmed, and in hindsight it seems fair to say that their experiment was > the first interferometric measurement of superluminal expansion. In 1994, a galactic speed record was obtained with the discovery of a superluminal source in our own galaxy, the cosmic x-ray source GRS 1915+105. The expansion occurred on a much shorter timescale. Several separate blobs were seen to expand in pairs within weeks by typically 0.5 arcsec. Because of the analogy with quasars, this source was called a microquasar.

One tribe faction, numbering several hundred, dominates Hamas in Hebron and is a radical opposition faction within Hamas, which frequently sabotages Hamas cease fires with bombings and attacks, provoking Israeli retaliation. The Shin Bet has accused them of kidnapping the Yeshiva students. Many of the Qawasmeh were originally pro-peace moderates and supporters of a two-state solution.Unruly Hebron Clan Pushes Hamas ‚Äî and Israel ‚Äî to Brink By J.J.

He opened fire on the Yamam officers who returned fire and killed him. According to Palestinian witnesses, however, a squad of Israeli police disguised as Palestinian labourers opened fire on him as he left a Hebron mosque. The controversial assassination led to criticism of Israel from U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell. On August 31, 2004, Ahmed Abed Qawasameh, a resident of the Hebron Discrit, blew himself up in a suicide bombing attack at Beersheba, which claimed the lives of 16 Israeli civilians. He was sent by the local Hamas leader Imad Qawasameh. On October 13, 2004, Imad Qawasameh was arrested by IDF forces, after intelligence was provided by the Shin Bet. According to witnesses, Imad surrendered immediately after an IDF Caterpillar D9 armoured bulldozer started to demolish his house. In 2011, the IDF broke into Omar Qawasameh's home, put a gun to his wife's head and shot him dead in his sleep. Subsequently, the Israeli army released a statement acknowledging the Qawasameh killing was unintended.

Overview =Definition= We work in three dimensions, with similar definitions holding in any other number of dimensions. In three dimensions, a form of the type :A(x,y,z) \\\\,dx + B(x,y,z) \\\\,dy + C(x,y,z) \\\\,dz is called a differential form. This form is called exact on a domain D \\\\subset \\\\mathbb{R}^3 in space if there exists some scalar function Q = Q(x,y,z) defined on D such that : dQ \\\\equiv \\\\left ( \\\\frac{\\\\partial Q}{\\\\partial x} \\\\right )_{y,z} \\\\, dx + \\\\left ( \\\\frac{\\\\partial Q}{\\\\partial y} \\\\right )_{x,z} \\\\, dy + \\\\left ( \\\\frac{\\\\partial Q}{\\\\partial z} \\\\right )_{x,y} \\\\, dz, dQ = A \\\\, dx + B \\\\, dy + C \\\\, dz throughout D. This is equivalent to saying that the vector field (A, B, C) is a conservative vector field, with corresponding potential Q. ::Note: The subscripts outside the parenthesis indicate which variables are being held constant during differentiation. Due to the definition of the partial derivative, these subscripts are not required, but they are included as a reminder. =One dimension= In one dimension, a differential form :A(x) \\\\, dx is exact as long as A has an antiderivative (but not necessarily one in terms of elementary functions). If A has an antiderivative, let Q be an antiderivative of A and this Q satisfies the condition for exactness. If A does not have an antiderivative, we cannot write dQ = A(x) \\\\, dx and so the differential form is inexact. =Two and three dimensions= By symmetry of second derivatives, for any \\"nice\\" (non-pathological) function Q we have : \\\\frac{\\\\partial ^2 Q}{\\\\partial x \\\\, \\\\partial y} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial ^2 Q}{\\\\partial y \\\\, \\\\partial x} Hence, it follows that in a simply-connected region R of the xy-plane, a differential :A(x, y)\\\\,dx + B(x, y)\\\\,dy is an exact differential if and only if the following holds: :\\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial A}{\\\\partial y} \\\\right)_x = \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial B}{\\\\partial x} \\\\right)_y For three dimensions, a differential :dQ = A(x, y, z) \\\\, dx + B(x, y, z) \\\\, dy + C(x, y, z) \\\\, dz is an exact differential in a simply-connected region R of the xyz-coordinate system if between the functions A, B and C there exist the relations: :\\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial A}{\\\\partial y} \\\\right)_{x,z} \\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!= \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial B}{\\\\partial x} \\\\right)_{y,z} ; \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial A}{\\\\partial z} \\\\right)_{x,y} \\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!= \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial C}{\\\\partial x} \\\\right)_{y,z} ; \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial B}{\\\\partial z} \\\\right)_{x,y} \\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!= \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial C}{\\\\partial y} \\\\right)_{x,z} These conditions are equivalent to the following one: If G is the graph of this vector valued function then for all tangent vectors X,Y of the surface G then s(X, Y) = 0 with s the symplectic form. These conditions, which are easy to generalize, arise from the independence of the order of differentiations in the calculation of the second derivatives. So, in order for a differential dQ, that is a function of four variables to be an exact differential, there are six conditions to satisfy. In summary, when a differential dQ is exact: *the function Q exists; *\\\\int_i^f dQ=Q(f)-Q(i), independent of the path followed. In thermodynamics, when dQ is exact, the function Q is a state function of the system. The thermodynamic functions U, S, H, A and G are state functions. Generally, neither work nor heat is a state function. An exact differential is sometimes also called a 'total differential', or a 'full differential', or, in the study of differential geometry, it is termed an exact form. Partial differential relations If three variables, x, y and z are bound by the condition F(x,y,z) = \\\\text{constant} for some differentiable function F(x,y,z), then the following total differentials exist :d x = {\\\\left ( \\\\frac{\\\\partial x}{\\\\partial y} \\\\right )}_z \\\\, d y + {\\\\left ( \\\\frac{\\\\partial x}{\\\\partial z} \\\\right )}_y \\\\,dz :d z = {\\\\left ( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial x} \\\\right )}_y \\\\, d x + {\\\\left ( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial y} \\\\right )}_x \\\\,dy. Substituting the first equation into the second and rearranging, we obtain :d z = {\\\\left ( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial x} \\\\right )}_y \\\\left [ {\\\\left ( \\\\frac{\\\\partial x}{\\\\partial y} \\\\right )}_z d y + {\\\\left ( \\\\frac{\\\\partial x}{\\\\partial z} \\\\right )}_y dz \\\\right ] + {\\\\left ( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial y} \\\\right )}_x dy, :d z = \\\\left [ {\\\\left ( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial x} \\\\right )}_y {\\\\left ( \\\\frac{\\\\partial x}{\\\\partial y} \\\\right )}_z + {\\\\left ( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial y} \\\\right )}_x \\\\right ] d y + {\\\\left ( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial x} \\\\right )}_y {\\\\left ( \\\\frac{\\\\partial x}{\\\\partial z} \\\\right )}_y dz, :\\\\left [ 1 - {\\\\left ( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial x} \\\\right )}_y {\\\\left ( \\\\frac{\\\\partial x}{\\\\partial z} \\\\right )}_y \\\\right ] dz = \\\\left [ {\\\\left ( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial x} \\\\right )}_y {\\\\left ( \\\\frac{\\\\partial x}{\\\\partial y} \\\\right )}_z + {\\\\left ( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial y} \\\\right )}_x \\\\right ] d y. Since y and z are independent variables, d y and d z may be chosen without restriction. For this last equation to hold in general, the bracketed terms must be equal to zero. =Reciprocity relation= Setting the first term in brackets equal to zero yields :{\\\\left ( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial x} \\\\right )}_y {\\\\left ( \\\\frac{\\\\partial x}{\\\\partial z} \\\\right )}_y = 1. A slight rearrangement gives a reciprocity relation, :{\\\\left ( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial x} \\\\right )}_y = \\\\frac{1}{{\\\\left ( \\\\frac{\\\\partial x}{\\\\partial z} \\\\right )}_y}. There are two more permutations of the foregoing derivation that give a total of three reciprocity relations between x, y and z. Reciprocity relations show that the inverse of a partial derivative is equal to its reciprocal. =Cyclic relation= The cyclic relation is also known as the cyclic rule or the Triple product rule. Setting the second term in brackets equal to zero yields :{\\\\left ( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial x} \\\\right )}_y {\\\\left ( \\\\frac{\\\\partial x}{\\\\partial y} \\\\right )}_z = - {\\\\left ( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial y} \\\\right )}_x. Using a reciprocity relation for \\\\tfrac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial y} on this equation and reordering gives a cyclic relation (the triple product rule), :{\\\\left ( \\\\frac{\\\\partial x}{\\\\partial y} \\\\right )}_z {\\\\left ( \\\\frac{\\\\partial y}{\\\\partial z} \\\\right )}_x {\\\\left ( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial x} \\\\right )}_y = -1. If, instead, a reciprocity relation for \\\\tfrac{\\\\partial x}{\\\\partial y} is used with subsequent rearrangement, a standard form for implicit differentiation is obtained: :{\\\\left ( \\\\frac{\\\\partial y}{\\\\partial x} \\\\right )}_z = - \\\\frac { {\\\\left ( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial x} \\\\right )}_y }{ {\\\\left ( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial y} \\\\right )}_x }.  Some useful equations derived from exact differentials in two dimensions  (See also Bridgman's thermodynamic equations for the use of exact differentials in the theory of thermodynamic equations) Suppose we have five state functions z,x,y,u, and v. Suppose that the state space is two dimensional and any of the five quantities are exact differentials. Then by the chain rule (1)~~~~~ dz = \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial x}\\\\right)_y dx+ \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial y}\\\\right)_x dy = \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial u}\\\\right)_v du +\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial v}\\\\right)_u dv but also by the chain rule: (2)~~~~~ dx = \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial x}{\\\\partial u}\\\\right)_v du +\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial x}{\\\\partial v}\\\\right)_u dv and (3)~~~~~ dy= \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial y}{\\\\partial u}\\\\right)_v du +\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial y}{\\\\partial v}\\\\right)_u dv so that: (4)~~~~~ dz = \\\\left[ \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial x}\\\\right)_y \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial x}{\\\\partial u}\\\\right)_v \\\\+ \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial y}\\\\right)_x \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial y}{\\\\partial u}\\\\right)_v \\\\right]du :::\\\\+ \\\\left[ \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial x}\\\\right)_y \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial x}{\\\\partial v}\\\\right)_u \\\\+ \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial y}\\\\right)_x \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial y}{\\\\partial v}\\\\right)_u \\\\right]dv which implies that: (5)~~~~~ \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial u}\\\\right)_v = \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial x}\\\\right)_y \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial x}{\\\\partial u}\\\\right)_v \\\\+ \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial y}\\\\right)_x \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial y}{\\\\partial u}\\\\right)_v Letting v=y gives: (6)~~~~~ \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial u}\\\\right)_y = \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial x}\\\\right)_y \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial x}{\\\\partial u}\\\\right)_y Letting u=y gives: (7)~~~~~ \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial y}\\\\right)_v = \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial y}\\\\right)_x \\\\+ \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial x}\\\\right)_y \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial x}{\\\\partial y}\\\\right)_v Letting u=y, v=z gives: (8)~~~~~ \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial y}\\\\right)_x = - \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial x}\\\\right)_y \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial x}{\\\\partial y}\\\\right)_z using (\\\\partial a/\\\\partial b)_c = 1/(\\\\partial b/\\\\partial a)_c gives the triple product rule: (9)~~~~~ \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial x}\\\\right)_y \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial x}{\\\\partial y}\\\\right)_z \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial y}{\\\\partial z}\\\\right)_x =-1  See also  *Closed and exact differential forms for a higher-level treatment *Differential (mathematics) *Inexact differential *Integrating factor for solving non-exact differential equations by making them exact *Exact differential equation  References  *Perrot, P.

One can think of geographical features as the \\"source code\\" behind a map, whereas the WMS interface or online tiled mapping portals like Google Maps return only an image, which end-users cannot edit or spatially analyze. The XML-based GML furnishes the default payload-encoding for transporting geographic features, but other formats like shapefiles can also serve for transport. In early 2006 the OGC members approved the OpenGIS GML Simple Features Profile.http://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=15201 This profile is designed both to increase interoperability between WFS servers and to improve the ease of implementation of the WFS standard. The OGC membership defined and maintains the WFS specification. Numerous commercial and open- source implementations of the WFS interface standard exist, including the open-source reference implementations GeoServer and deegree. The OGC Implementing Products page provides a comprehensive list of WFS implementations. Overview  The WFS specification defines interfaces for describing data manipulation operations of geographic features. Data manipulation operations include the ability to: * get or query features based on spatial and non-spatial constraints * create a new feature instance * delete a feature instance * update a feature instance The basic Web Feature Service allows querying and retrieval of features. A transactional Web Feature Service (WFS-T) allows creation, deletion, and updating of features. A WFS describes discovery, query, or data transformation operations. The client generates the request and posts it to a web feature server using HTTP. The web feature server then executes the request. The WFS specification uses HTTP as the distributed computing platform, although this is not a hard requirement. There are two encodings defined for WFS operations: * XML (amenable to HTTP POST, or SOAP) * Key/value pairs (encoded in HTTP GET query strings, to perform remote procedure calls)http://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=36263&format;=pdf In the taxonomy of Web Services, WFS is best categorized as a non-RESTful RPC type service. = Communication models= The WFS Web Feature Services or Web Feature Server specification supports two communication models: *Stateless Request Reply *Pub/Sub ::A messaging system in which clients address messages to a specific node in a content hierarchy, called a topic. Publishers and subscribers are generally anonymous and can dynamically publish or subscribe to the content hierarchy. The system takes care of distributing the messages arriving from a node's multiple publishers to its multiple subscribers. Messages are generally not persistent and will only be received by subscribers who are listening at the time the message is sent. A special case known as a ‚Äúdurable subscription‚Äù allows subscribers to receive messages sent while the subscribers are not active. (Source: Oracle Technology Network for Java Developers  Oracle Technology Network  Oracle) The Web Notification Service (WNS) is one of the implementation specifications for the Pub/Sub model. Regardless of the model, URL format is used and specified in the WFS specification. At this time there are no open-standard implementations of WNSs. Vendors plan to release implementations once the standard has been ratified. =Data = Data passed between a Web Feature Server and a client is encoded with Geography Markup Language (GML), an XML dialect which can be used to model geographic features. The 1.0.0 version of the WFS specification requires the use of GML version 2.1.2, while the 1.1.0 version of the WFS specification requires the use of GML version 3.1.1. For both versions of the WFS specification, an arbitrary number of other encodings can also be defined, in addition to the required GML 2.1.2 or 3.1.1 format (for 1.0.0 and 1.1.0 respectively). GML 2.1.2 contains encoding support for basic geometric 'primitives': points, lines, polygons, etc. GML 3.1.1 contains encoding support for more advanced geometric representations: curves, surfaces, multi- dimensions (time, elevation, multi-band imagery). In addition, GML 3.1.1 includes encoding support for topologically integrated datasets.  Public Interfaces =Static Interfaces = The static interface model for the OGC Web Service model appears in the figure below. The Transaction and LockFeature operations are also optional. When writing a WFS, you must implement the following operations: *GetCapabilities - this queries the WFS service to determine available options. *DescribeFeatureType - this retrieves the XML schema to allow the WFS client to parse the resultsets. *GetFeature - this performs the actual query - parameters such as bounding box and any other filters should be passed in, as appropriate, and the WFS service then returns a GML resultset containing full geometry and feature attributes. =Dynamic interface updates = The client gets updates by one of two mechanisms: *Notification: Recommended but not mandatory. Depends on the availability of a WNS implementation. *Polling: Use this method if a WNS implementation is not available. WFS dynamic interface web notification model This model uses the OGC Web Notification Service to send update notifications to registered clients.

His works explore themes of social isolation, emotional torment and depression. He tends to use a vivid color palette and realistic, meticulous detail. His lettering and images are often elaborate and sometimes evoke the ragtime era or another early 20th-century American design style. Ware often refers to himself in the publicity for his work in self-effacing, even withering tones. He is considered by some critics and fellow notable illustrators and writers, such as Dave Eggers, to be among the best currently working in the medium; Canadian graphic-novelist Seth has said, \\"Chris really changed the playing field. After him, a lot of [cartoonists] really started to scramble and go, 'Holy [expletive], I think I have to try harder.'\\" Career Born in Omaha, Nebraska, Ware resides in the Chicago area of Illinois.Chris Ware bio at Fantagraphics His earliest published strips appeared in the late 1980s on the comics page of The Daily Texan, the student newspaper of the University of Texas at Austin. In addition to numerous daily strips under different titles, Ware also had a weekly satirical science fiction serial in the paper titled Floyd Farland: Citizen of the Future. This was eventually published in 1988 as a prestige format comic book from Eclipse Comics, and its publication even led to a brief correspondence between Ware and Timothy Leary. While still a sophomore at UT, Ware came to the attention of Art Spiegelman, who invited Ware to contribute to Raw, the influential anthology magazine Spiegelman was co-editing with Fran√ßoise Mouly. Ware has acknowledged that being included in Raw gave him confidence and inspired him to explore printing techniques and self- publishing. His Fantagraphics series Acme Novelty Library defied comics publishing conventions with every issue. The series featured a combination of new material as well as reprints of work Ware had done for the Texan (such as Quimby the Mouse) and the Chicago weekly paper Newcity. Ware's work appeared originally in Newcity before he moved on to his current \\"home\\", the Chicago Reader. Beginning with the 16th issue of Acme Novelty Library, Ware is self- publishing his work, while maintaining a relationship with Fantagraphics for distribution and storage. This is an interesting return to Ware's early career, when he self-published such books as Lonely Comics and Stories as well as miniature digests of stories based on Quimby the Mouse and an unnamed potato-like creature. In recent years he has also been involved in editing (and designing) several books and book series, including the new reprint series of Gasoline Alley from Drawn and Quarterly titled Walt and Skeezix; a reprint series of Krazy Kat by Fantagraphics; and the 13th volume of Timothy McSweeney's Quarterly Concern, which is devoted to comics. He was the editor of The Best American Comics 2007, the second installment devoted to comics in the Best American series. In 2007, Ware curated an exhibition for the Phoenix Art Museum focused on the non-comic work of five contemporary cartoonists. The exhibition, titled \\"UnInked: Paintings, Sculpture and Graphic Works by Five Cartoonists\\", ran from April 21 through August 19.UnInked: Paintings, Sculpture and Graphic Work by Five Cartoonists , Retrieved March 2, 2010 Ware also edited and designed the catalog for the exhibition. In 2017, Ware's book Monograph appeared. It is a part-memoir, part-scrapbook retrospective of his career to that point. Style Ware's art reflects early 20th-century American styles of cartooning and graphic design, shifting through formats from traditional comic panels to faux advertisements and cut-out toys. Stylistic influences include advertising graphics from that same era; newspaper strip cartoonists Winsor McCay (Little Nemo in Slumberland) and Frank King (Gasoline Alley);Raeburn (2004) Charles Schulz's post-WWII strip Peanuts and the cover designs of ragtime-era sheet music. Ware has spoken about finding inspiration in the work of artist Joseph CornellPantheon Graphic Novels and cites Richard McGuire's strip Here as a major influence on his use of non-linear narratives. Ware has said of his own style: > I arrived at my way of \\"working\\" as a way of visually approximating what I > feel the tone of fiction to be in prose versus the tone one might use to > write biography; I would never do a biographical story using the > deliberately synthetic way of cartooning I use to write fiction. I try to > use the rules of typography to govern the way that I \\"draw\\", which keeps me > at a sensible distance from the story as well as being a visual analog to > the way we remember and conceptualize the world. I figured out this way of > working by learning from and looking at artists I admired and whom I thought > came closest to getting at what seemed to me to be the \\"essence\\" of comics, > which is fundamentally the weird process of reading pictures, not just > looking at them.

He does, however, sometimes use photocopies and transparencies, and he employs a computer to color his strips. Recurring characters and stories Ware in 2009 =Quimby the Mouse= Quimby the Mouse was an early character for Ware and something of a breakthrough. Rendered in the style of an early animation character like Felix the Cat, Quimby the Mouse is perhaps Ware's most autobiographical character. Quimby's relationship with a cat head named Sparky is by turns conflict-ridden and loving, and thus intended to reflect all human relationships. While Quimby exhibits mobility, Sparky remains immobile and helpless, subject to all the indignities Quimby visits upon him. Quimby also acts as a narrator for Ware's reminiscences of his youth, in particular his relationship with his grandmother. Sometimes illustrated as a two-headed mouse, Quimby embodies both Ware and his grandmother, and the duality of a young and old body. Quimby was presented in a series of smaller panels than most comics, almost providing the illusion of motion √† la a zoetrope. In fact, Ware once designed a zoetrope to be cut out and constructed by the reader in order to watch a Quimby \\"silent movie\\". Ware's ingenuity is neatly shown in this willingness to break from the confines of the page. Quimby the Mouse appears in the logo of a Chicago-based bookstore \\"Quimby's\\", although their shared name was originally a coincidence. =Rusty Brown= Ware's Rusty Brown is ostensibly about an action-figure- collecting manchild and his somewhat-troubled childhood, but which, in Ware's fashion, diverges into multiple storylines about Brown's father's early life in the 1950s as a science fiction writer (Acme Novelty Library #19) and his best friend Chalky White's adult home life. The first part of Rusty Brown was published in book form in 2019 by Pantheon Books. =Building Stories= Ware's Building Stories was serialized in a host of different venues. It first appeared as a monthly strip in Nest Magazine. Installments later appeared in a number of publications, including The New Yorker, Kramer's Ergot, and most notably, the Sunday New York Times Magazine. Building Stories appeared weekly in the New York Times Magazine from September 18, 2005 until April 16, 2006. A full chapter was published in Acme Novelty Library, number 18. Another installment was published under the title \\"Touch Sensitive\\" as a digital app released through McSweeneys. The entire narrative was published as a boxed set of books by Pantheon in October 2012. The boxed set holds 14 different works, in various sizes and forms, weaving through the life of an unnamed brown haired woman. =The Last Saturday= Ware's latest project, The Last Saturday, a \\"comic novella,\\" began appearing online every Friday at the website of the UK newspaper The Guardian, starting in September 2014. The story follows a few people in Sandy Port, Michigan: Putnam Gray, a young boy caught up in his sci-fi and space fantasies; Sandy Grains, a young girl and classmate who is interested in Putnam; Rosie Gentry, a young girl and classmate with whom Putnam is infatuated; Mr. and Mrs. Gray and Mrs. Grains. The strip also features in the newspaper's Weekend magazine. The serialization has now apparently ended after 54 instalments. The bottom right-hand corner of the last page has a note that says, \\"END, PART ONE\\", but , there appears to be no indication from The Guardian or from Ware that there is to be a Part Two. Non-comics work Ware is an ardent collector of ragtime paraphernalia and occasionally publishes a journal devoted to the music titled The Ragtime Ephemeralist. He also plays the banjo and piano. The influence of the music and the graphics of its era can be seen in Ware's work, especially in regard to logos and layout. Ware has designed album covers and posters for such ragtime performers as the Et Cetera String Band, Virginia Tichenor, Reginald R. Robinson, the Paragon Ragtime Orchestra and Guido Nielsen. He has also designed covers and posters for non-ragtime performers such as Andrew Bird's Bowl of Fire and 5ive Style.\\"Album Artwork\\". Acme Novelty Library Archive. Retrieved November 26, 2012. In October 2005 Ware designed the elaborate cover art for Penguin Books' new edition of Voltaire's Candide. Ware was commissioned by Chip Kidd to design the inner machinations of the bird on the cover of Haruki Murakami's novel The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle. In 2003-04, Ware worked with Ira Glass of This American Life and Chicago historian Tim Samuelson to illustrate and design Lost Buildings about Samuelson and the preservation of Chicago's old buildings, particularly Louis Sullivan's buildings.Ball, p. xviiBall, p. 13 Originally produced for a live \\"Lost in America\\" stage show in 2003, Lost Buildings was later published as a book and DVD.Ball, p. 118 In 2007-08, he produced animations for the This American Life television series on Showtime and also contributed to the show as a color consultant. Ware created poster art for Tamara Jenkins' 2007 film The Savages and her 2018 film Private Life. =Mural for 826 Valencia= Dave Eggers commissioned Ware to design the mural for the facade of San Francisco literacy project 826 Valencia. The mural depicts \\"the parallel development of humans and their efforts at and motivations for communication, spoken and written.\\" The 3.9m x 6m mural was applied by artisans to Ware‚Äôs specifications. Describing the work, Ware said \\"I didn‚Äôt want it to make anyone 'feel good', especially in that typically muralistic 'hands across the water' sort of way,\\"...\\"I especially wanted it to be something that people living in the neighbourhood could look at day after day and hopefully not tire of too quickly. I really hoped whomever might happen to come across it would find something that showed a respect for their intelligence, and didn‚Äôt force-feed them any 'message'.\\" =Fortune 500 cover= In 2010, Ware designed the cover for Fortune magazine's \\"Fortune 500\\" issue, but it was rejected.ComicsBeat.com Ware had mentioned the work at a panel at the Chicago Comic and Entertainment Expo on April 16, as first noted in an April 20 blog post by Matthew J. Brady. The cover, featuring the circle-shaped humans common in Ware's more broadly socially satirical comic-strips, turned the numbers 500 into skyscrapers looming over the continental United States. On the roofs, corporate bosses drink, dance, and sun themselves as a helicopter drops a shovelful of money down for them. Below, among signs reading \\"Credit Default Swap Flea Market,\\" \\"Greenspan Lube Pro,\\" and \\"401K Cemetery,\\" a helicopter scoops money out of the US Treasury with a shovel, cars pile up in Detroit, and flag-waving citizens party around a boiling tea kettle in the shape of an elephant. In the Gulf of Mexico, homes are sinking, while hooded prisoners sit in Guantanamo, a \\"Factory of Exploitation\\" keeps going in Mexico, China is tossing American dollars into the Pacific, and the roof of bankrupted Greece's Treasury has blown off. A spokesperson for the magazine only said that, as is their practice, they had commissioned a number of possible covers from different artists, including Ware. Brady wrote in his blog that Ware said at the panel he \\"accepted the job because it would be like doing the [cover for the] 1929 issue of the magazine\\". =Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives= In 2011, Ware created the poster for the U.S. release of the 2010 film Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives by Thai director Apichatpong Weerasethakul. Describing the poster, Ware said \\"I wanted to get at both the transcendent solemnity of the film while keeping some sense of its loose, very unpretentious accessibility... This being a poster, however‚Äîand even worse, me not really being a designer‚ÄîI realized it also had to be somewhat punchy and strange, so as to draw viewers in and pique their curiosity without, hopefully, insulting their intelligence.\\" Awards and honors Over the years his work garnered several awards, including the 1999 National Cartoonists Society's Award for Best Comic Book for Acme Novelty Library and Award for Graphic Novel for Building Stories. Ware has won numerous Eisner Awards during his career including Best Artist/Writer in 2009 (Acme Novelty Library) and 2013 (Building Stories); Best Artist/Writer-Drama in 2008; Best Continuing Series in 1996 and 2000 (Acme Novelty Library); Best Graphic Album: New in 2000 and 2013 (Building Stories); Best Graphic Album: Reprint in 2001 (Jimmy Corrigan); Best Colorist of 1996, 1998, 2001 and 2006; Best Publication Design in 1995, 1996, 1997 (Acme Novelty Library), 2001 (Jimmy Corrigan), 2002, 2006 (Acme Novelty Library Annual Report for Shareholders) and 2013 (Building Stories) Ware has won multiple Harvey Awards including Best Continuing or Limited Series in 2000 and 2001; Best Cartoonist in 2006 (Acme Novelty Library); Best Letterer in 1996, 2000, 2002, and 2006 ; Best Colorist in 1996, 1997, 1998, 2000, 2002 and 2004 (Acme Novelty Datebook); and Special Award for Excellence in Presentation in 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000 (Acme Novelty Library), 2001 (Jimmy Corrigan), 2004 (Acme Novelty Datebook) and 2013 (Building Stories) In 2002, Ware became the first comics artist to be invited to exhibit at Whitney Museum of American Art biennial exhibition.Ball, p. 65 With Will Eisner, Jack Kirby, Harvey Kurtzman, Robert Crumb and Gary Panter, Ware was among the artists honored in the exhibition \\"Masters of American Comics\\" at the Jewish Museum in New York City, New York, from September 16, 2006 to January 28, 2007.. .Kimmelman, Michael. \\"See You in the Funny Papers\\" (art review), The New York Times, October 13, 2006 His work was the subject of solo exhibitions at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago in 2006 and at the University of Nebraska's Sheldon Museum of Art, in 2007. Ware's graphic novel Jimmy Corrigan, the Smartest Kid on Earth won the 2001 Guardian First Book Award, the first time a graphic novel has won a major United Kingdom book award. It also won the prize for best album at the 2003 Angoul√™me International Comics Festival in France. In 2006, Ware received a USA Hoi Fellow grant from United States Artists.USA Fellows 2006 Visual Arts: Chris Ware , United States Artists In 2013, Ware received the 2013 Lynd Ward Graphic Novel Prize for Building Stories and was finalist for Jan Michalski Prize for Literature and Los Angeles Times Book Prize.

This differs from \\"digital\\" which uses a series of discrete quantities to represent signal. Analog values are typically represented as a voltage, electric current, or electric charge around components in the electronic devices. An error or noise affecting such physical quantities will result in a corresponding error in the signals represented by such physical quantities. Examples of analog signal processing include crossover filters in loudspeakers, \\"bass\\", \\"treble\\" and \\"volume\\" controls on stereos, and \\"tint\\" controls on TVs. Common analog processing elements include capacitors, resistors and inductors (as the passive elements) and transistors or opamps (as the active elements). Tools used in analog signal processing A system's behavior can be mathematically modeled and is represented in the time domain as h(t) and in the frequency domain as H(s), where s is a complex number in the form of s=a+ib, or s=a+jb in electrical engineering terms (electrical engineers use \\"j\\" instead of \\"i\\" because current is represented by the variable i). Input signals are usually called x(t) or X(s) and output signals are usually called y(t) or Y(s). =Convolution= Convolution is the basic concept in signal processing that states an input signal can be combined with the system's function to find the output signal. It is the integral of the product of two waveforms after one has reversed and shifted; the symbol for convolution is *. : y(t) = (x * h )(t) = \\\\int_{a}^{b} x(\\\\tau) h(t - \\\\tau)\\\\, d\\\\tau That is the convolution integral and is used to find the convolution of a signal and a system; typically a = -‚àû and b = +‚àû. Consider two waveforms f and g. By calculating the convolution, we determine how much a reversed function g must be shifted along the x-axis to become identical to function f. The convolution function essentially reverses and slides function g along the axis, and calculates the integral of their (f and the reversed and shifted g) product for each possible amount of sliding. When the functions match, the value of (f*g) is maximized. This occurs because when positive areas (peaks) or negative areas (troughs) are multiplied, they contribute to the integral. =Fourier transform= The Fourier transform is a function that transforms a signal or system in the time domain into the frequency domain, but it only works for certain functions. The constraint on which systems or signals can be transformed by the Fourier Transform is that: :\\\\int^\\\\infty_{-\\\\infty} x(t)\\\\, dt < \\\\infty This is the Fourier transform integral: :X(j\\\\omega) = \\\\int^\\\\infty_{-\\\\infty} x(t)e^{-j\\\\omega t}\\\\, dt Usually the Fourier transform integral isn't used to determine the transform; instead, a table of transform pairs is used to find the Fourier transform of a signal or system. The inverse Fourier transform is used to go from frequency domain to time domain: :x(t)=\\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi}\\\\int^\\\\infty_{-\\\\infty} X(j\\\\omega )e^{j\\\\omega t}\\\\, d\\\\omega Each signal or system that can be transformed has a unique Fourier transform. There is only one time signal for any frequency signal, and vice versa. =Laplace transform= The Laplace transform is a generalized Fourier transform. It allows a transform of any system or signal because it is a transform into the complex plane instead of just the jœâ line like the Fourier transform. The major difference is that the Laplace transform has a region of convergence for which the transform is valid. This implies that a signal in frequency may have more than one signal in time; the correct time signal for the transform is determined by the region of convergence. If the region of convergence includes the jœâ axis, jœâ can be substituted into the Laplace transform for s and it's the same as the Fourier transform. The Laplace transform is: :X(s) = \\\\int^\\\\infty_{0^-} x(t)e^{-s t}\\\\, dt and the inverse Laplace transform, if all the singularities of X(s) are in the left half of the complex plane, is: :x(t)=\\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi}\\\\int^\\\\infty_{-\\\\infty} X(s )e^{s t}\\\\, d s =Bode plots= Bode plots are plots of magnitude vs. frequency and phase vs. frequency for a system. The magnitude axis is in [Decibel] (dB). The phase axis is in either degrees or radians. The frequency axes are in a [logarithmic scale]. These are useful because for sinusoidal inputs, the output is the input multiplied by the value of the magnitude plot at the frequency and shifted by the value of the phase plot at the frequency. Domains =Time domain= This is the domain that most people are familiar with. A plot in the time domain shows the amplitude of the signal with respect to time. =Frequency domain= A plot in the frequency domain shows either the phase shift or magnitude of a signal at each frequency that it exists at. These can be found by taking the Fourier transform of a time signal and are plotted similarly to a bode plot. Signals While any signal can be used in analog signal processing, there are many types of signals that are used very frequently. =Sinusoids= Sinusoids are the building block of analog signal processing. All real world signals can be represented as an infinite sum of sinusoidal functions via a Fourier series. A sinusoidal function can be represented in terms of an exponential by the application of Euler's Formula. =Impulse= An impulse (Dirac delta function) is defined as a signal that has an infinite magnitude and an infinitesimally narrow width with an area under it of one, centered at zero. An impulse can be represented as an infinite sum of sinusoids that includes all possible frequencies. It is not, in reality, possible to generate such a signal, but it can be sufficiently approximated with a large amplitude, narrow pulse, to produce the theoretical impulse response in a network to a high degree of accuracy. The symbol for an impulse is Œ¥(t). If an impulse is used as an input to a system, the output is known as the impulse response. The impulse response defines the system because all possible frequencies are represented in the input =Step= A unit step function, also called the Heaviside step function, is a signal that has a magnitude of zero before zero and a magnitude of one after zero. The symbol for a unit step is u(t). If a step is used as the input to a system, the output is called the step response. The step response shows how a system responds to a sudden input, similar to turning on a switch. The period before the output stabilizes is called the transient part of a signal. The step response can be multiplied with other signals to show how the system responds when an input is suddenly turned on. The unit step function is related to the Dirac delta function by; :\\\\mathrm{u}(t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{t} \\\\delta (s)ds Systems =Linear time-invariant (LTI)= Linearity means that if you have two inputs and two corresponding outputs, if you take a linear combination of those two inputs you will get a linear combination of the outputs. An example of a linear system is a first order low-pass or high-pass filter. Linear systems are made out of analog devices that demonstrate linear properties. These devices don't have to be entirely linear, but must have a region of operation that is linear. An operational amplifier is a non-linear device, but has a region of operation that is linear, so it can be modeled as linear within that region of operation. Time-invariance means it doesn't matter when you start a system, the same output will result. For example, if you have a system and put an input into it today, you would get the same output if you started the system tomorrow instead. There aren't any real systems that are LTI, but many systems can be modeled as LTI for simplicity in determining what their output will be. All systems have some dependence on things like temperature, signal level or other factors that cause them to be non-linear or non-time-invariant, but most are stable enough to model as LTI. Linearity and time-invariance are important because they are the only types of systems that can be easily solved using conventional analog signal processing methods. Once a system becomes non-linear or non-time-invariant, it becomes a non-linear differential equations problem, and there are very few of those that can actually be solved.

Its initial members came from radical left-wing or anarchist backgrounds and had already participated in groups IWW (calling themselves the Rebel Worker Group and putting out a magazine called the Rebel Worker) and SDS; indeed, the Chicago group edited an issue of Radical America, the SDS journal, and the SDS printshop printed some of the group's first publications.  Collaborations and projects  The group played a major role in organizing the World Surrealist Exhibition held at Gallery Black Swan in Chicago in 1976. As the name suggests, broader in scope than previous \\"international\\" exhibitions, it featured hundreds of works almost exclusively from contemporary participants in surrealism from thirty-one countries.\\"Women and the Surrealist Revolution: an interview with Penelope Rosemont\\" by Danny Postel, in 'Exquisite Corpse: A Journal of Letters and Life' Marvelous Freedom/Vigilance of Desire was the name for the catalogue of the 1976 World Surrealist Exhibition. It contains a number of texts and reproductions, as well as a blueprint of the layout of the gallery, with the location of the different \\"domains\\" into which the exhibition was organised. The Chicago Group has also collaborated on the surrealist issue of the journal Race Traitor, and the \\"Totems Without Taboos\\" show at the Heartland Cafe in Chicago. It sporadically publishes a newspaper entitled WHAT Are You Going To Do About It? and the journal Arsenal/Surrealist Subversion. The Surrealist Movement in the United States was started by the Chicago Surrealist Group as a means of including many of its scattered participants from coast to coast on collective statements and in collective activities. Participants in the group's activities have included Clarence John Laughlin, Gerome Kamrowski, Philip Lamantia, Tristan Meinecke and Franklin Rosemont. As participants past and present have been based in cities other than Chicago, the group has never been strictly defined by geography, despite its name. The group has worked with others, such as The Surrealist Group in Stockholm, with which it met in Chicago and Stockholm in 1986, publishing the International Surrealist Bulletin No. 1.  Criticism  The Chicago Surrealist Group has been frequently criticised. The Rain Taxi Review of Books once described them as being in \\"aesthetic stasis\\" and having an \\"orthodox interpretation\\" of surrealism. There are also numerous criticisms and denouncements of the Chicago Surrealist Group included in the reference section Arsenal.

Inorganic Chemistry:Principles of Structure and Reactivity In quantum mechanics, electron configurations of atoms are described as wavefunctions. In a mathematical sense, these wave functions are the basis set of functions, the basis functions, which describe the electrons of a given atom. In chemical reactions, orbital wavefunctions are modified, i.e. the electron cloud shape is changed, according to the type of atoms participating in the chemical bond. It was introduced in 1929 by Sir John Lennard-Jones with the description of bonding in the diatomic molecules of the first main row of the periodic table, but had been used earlier by Linus Pauling for H2+.Friedrich Hund and Chemistry, Werner Kutzelnigg, on the occasion of Hund's 100th birthday, Angewandte Chemie, 35, 572‚Äì586, (1996), Robert S. Mulliken's Nobel Lecture, Science, 157, no. 3784, 13 - 24, (1967) A mathematical description follows. An initial assumption is that the number of molecular orbitals is equal to the number of atomic orbitals included in the linear expansion. In a sense, n atomic orbitals combine to form n molecular orbitals, which can be numbered i = 1 to n and which may not all be the same. The expression (linear expansion) for the i th molecular orbital would be: : \\\\ \\\\phi_i = c_{1i} \\\\chi_1 + c_{2i} \\\\chi_2 + c_{3i} \\\\chi_3 + \\\\cdots +c_{ni} \\\\chi_n or : \\\\ \\\\phi_i = \\\\sum_{r} c_{ri} \\\\chi_r where \\\\ \\\\phi_i is a molecular orbital represented as the sum of n atomic orbitals \\\\ \\\\chi_r , each multiplied by a corresponding coefficient \\\\ c_{ri} , and r (numbered 1 to n) represents which atomic orbital is combined in the term. The coefficients are the weights of the contributions of the n atomic orbitals to the molecular orbital. The Hartree‚ÄìFock procedure is used to obtain the coefficients of the expansion. The orbitals are thus expressed as linear combinations of basis functions, and the basis functions are one-electron functions which may or may not be centered on the nuclei of the component atoms of the molecule. In either case the basis functions are usually also referred to as atomic orbitals (even though only in the former case this name seems to be adequate). The atomic orbitals used are typically those of hydrogen-like atoms since these are known analytically i.e. Slater-type orbitals but other choices are possible such as the Gaussian functions from standard basis sets or the pseudo-atomic orbitals from plane-wave pseudopotentials. By minimizing the total energy of the system, an appropriate set of coefficients of the linear combinations is determined. This quantitative approach is now known as the Hartree‚ÄìFock method. However, since the development of computational chemistry, the LCAO method often refers not to an actual optimization of the wave function but to a qualitative discussion which is very useful for predicting and rationalizing results obtained via more modern methods. In this case, the shape of the molecular orbitals and their respective energies are deduced approximately from comparing the energies of the atomic orbitals of the individual atoms (or molecular fragments) and applying some recipes known as level repulsion and the like. The graphs that are plotted to make this discussion clearer are called correlation diagrams. The required atomic orbital energies can come from calculations or directly from experiment via Koopmans' theorem. This is done by using the symmetry of the molecules and orbitals involved in bonding, and thus is sometimes called Symmetry Adapted Linear Combination (SALC). The first step in this process is assigning a point group to the molecule. A common example is water, which is of C2v symmetry. Then a reducible representation of the bonding is determined demonstrated below for water: :The irreducible representation as derived from the point group's operations Each operation in the point group is performed upon the molecule. The number of bonds that are unmoved is the character of that operation. This reducible representation is decomposed into the sum of irreducible representations. These irreducible representations correspond to the symmetry of the orbitals involved. MO diagrams provide simple qualitative LCAO treatment. :A typical MO diagram Quantitative theories are the H√ºckel method, the extended H√ºckel method and the Pariser‚ÄìParr‚ÄìPople method.

She was a professor at Stanford University, where she had taught from 1996.New York Times, \\"Eavan Boland, ‚ÄòDisruptive‚Äô Irish Poet,\\" April 28, 2020 Her work deals with the Irish national identity, and the role of women in Irish history. A number of poems from Boland's poetry career are studied by Irish students who take the Leaving Certificate. She was a recipient of the Lannan Literary Award for Poetry. Life and career Boland's father, Frederick Boland, was a career diplomat and her mother, Frances Kelly, was a noted painter. She was born in Dublin in 1944. When she was six, Boland's father was appointed Irish Ambassador to the United Kingdom; the family followed him to London, where Boland had her first experiences of anti-Irish sentiment. Her dealing with this hostility strengthened Boland's identification with her Irish heritage. She spoke of this time in her poem, \\"An Irish Childhood in England: 1951\\". At 14, she returned to Dublin to attend Holy Child School in Killiney. She published a pamphlet of poetry (23 Poems) in her first year at Trinity, in 1962. Boland earned a BA with First Class Honors in English Literature and Language from Trinity College Dublin in 1966. Since then she held numerous teaching positions and published poetry, prose criticism and essays. Boland married the novelist Kevin Casey in 1969 and had two daughters. Her experiences as a wife and mother influenced her to write about the centrality of the ordinary, as well as providing a frame for more political and historical themes. She taught at Trinity College Dublin, University College, Dublin, and Bowdoin College, and was a member of the International Writing Program at the University of Iowa. She was also writer in residence at Trinity College Dublin, and at the National Maternity Hospital. In the late 1970s and 1980s, she taught at the School of Irish Studies in Dublin. From 1996 she was a tenured Professor of English at Stanford University where she was the Bella Mabury and Eloise Mabury Knapp Professor in the Humanities and Melvin and Bill Lane Professor for Director of the Creative Writing program. She divided her time between Palo Alto, and her home in Dublin. Boland died in Dublin on 27 April 2020, aged 75, from a stroke. Works Eavan Boland's first book of poetry was New Territory published in 1967 with Dublin publisher Allen Figgis. This was followed by The War Horse (1975), In Her Own Image (1980) and Night Feed (1982), which established her reputation as a writer on the ordinary lives of women and on the difficulties faced by women poets in a male-dominated literary world. Her books of poetry include Domestic Violence (W. W. Norton & Co., 2007), Against Love Poetry (W. W. Norton & Co., 2001), The Lost Land (1998), An Origin Like Water: Collected Poems 1967‚Äì1987 (1996), In a Time of Violence (1994), Outside History: Selected Poems 1980‚Äì1990 (1990), The Journey and Other Poems (1986), Night Feed (1982), and In Her Own Image (1980). In addition to her books of poetry, Boland was also the author of Object Lessons: The Life of the Woman and the Poet in Our Time (W. W. Norton, 1995), a volume of prose, and co- editor of The Making of a Poem: A Norton Anthology of Poetic Forms (W. W. Norton & Co., 2000). Her last prose book is A Journey With Two Maps: Becoming a Woman Poet (W. W. Norton, 2011 and Carcanet Press UK). Awards In 1976, Boland won a Jacob's Award for her involvement in The Arts Programme broadcast on RT√â Radio. Her other awards include a Lannan Foundation Award in Poetry and an American Ireland Fund Literary Award. She also received the Corrington Medal for Literary Excellence Centenary College 2002, the Bucknell Medal of Distinction 2000 Bucknell University, the Smartt Family prize from the Yale Review and the John Frederick Nims Award from Poetry Magazine 2002. Her volume \\"Domestic Violence\\" (2007) was shortlisted for the Forward prize in the UK. Her poem \\"Violence Against Women\\" from the same volume was awarded the James Boatwright III Prize for Poetry for the best poem published in 2007 in Shenandoah magazine. In 1997 she received an honorary degree from University College Dublin. She also received honorary degrees from Strathclyde University and Colby College in the US in 1997, and the College of the Holy Cross in 1999. She received one from Bowdoin College in 2004. In 2004 she also received an honorary degree from Trinity College Dublin. Her collection In a Time of Violence (1994) received a Lannan Award and was shortlisted for the T. S. Eliot Prize. Several of her volumes of poetry have been Poetry Book Society Choices in the UK, where she is primarily published by Carcanet Press. In the United States her publisher is W. W. Norton. Her volume of poems Against Love Poetry (W. W. Norton 2001) was a New York Times Notable Book of the Year.

In a brief 1982 review of a contemporary reprint of the novel, author David Langford wrote that \\"though it contains an interesting idea, the book seems an implausible award-winner. It's fine (...) to postulate a machine giving immortality, youth and a perfect complexion to those and only those who can cast aside preconceptions and prejudices (...) The idea, though, is flattened into the ground by the authors' reluctance to do the work which would make it convincing.\\" Langford has also addressed conspiracy theories attributing They'd Rather Be Right's win to Scientology, saying it is more likely that Clifton was popular for his short stories. Galaxy Science Fiction reviewer Floyd C.

They are named after the physicist John C. Slater, who introduced them in 1930. They possess exponential decay at long range and Kato's cusp condition at short range (when combined as hydrogen-like atom functions, i.e. the analytical solutions of the stationary Schr√∂dinger equation for one electron atoms). Unlike the hydrogen- like (\\"hydrogenic\\") Schr√∂dinger orbitals, STOs have no radial nodes (neither do Gaussian-type orbitals). Definition STOs have the following radial part: : R(r) = N r^{n-1} e^{-\\\\zeta r}\\\\, where : is a natural number that plays the role of principal quantum number, = 1,2,..., : is a normalizing constant, : is the distance of the electron from the atomic nucleus, and : \\\\zeta is a constant related to the effective charge of the nucleus, the nuclear charge being partly shielded by electrons. Historically, the effective nuclear charge was estimated by Slater's rules. The normalization constant is computed from the integral : \\\\int_0^\\\\infty x^n e^{-\\\\alpha x} \\\\operatorname d x = \\\\frac{n!}{~\\\\alpha^{n+1}\\\\,}~. Hence :N^2 \\\\int_0^\\\\infty \\\\left(r^{n-1}e^{-\\\\zeta r}\\\\right)^2 r^2 \\\\operatorname d r =1 \\\\Longrightarrow N = (2\\\\zeta)^n \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2\\\\zeta}{(2n)!}}~. It is common to use the spherical harmonics Y_l^m(\\\\mathbf{r}) depending on the polar coordinates of the position vector \\\\mathbf{r} as the angular part of the Slater orbital. Derivatives The first radial derivative of the radial part of a Slater-type orbital is : {\\\\partial R(r)\\\\over \\\\partial r} = \\\\left[\\\\frac{(n - 1)}{r} - \\\\zeta\\\\right] R(r) The radial Laplace operator is split in two differential operators : abla^2 = {1 \\\\over r^2}{\\\\partial \\\\over \\\\partial r}\\\\left(r^2 {\\\\partial \\\\over \\\\partial r}\\\\right) The first differential operator of the Laplace operator yields : \\\\left(r^2 {\\\\partial\\\\over \\\\partial r} \\\\right) R(r) = \\\\left[(n - 1) r - \\\\zeta r^2 \\\\right] R(r) The total Laplace operator yields after applying the second differential operator : abla^2 R(r) = \\\\left({1 \\\\over r^2} {\\\\partial\\\\over \\\\partial r} \\\\right) \\\\left[(n - 1) r - \\\\zeta r^2 \\\\right] R(r) the result : abla^2 R(r) = \\\\left[{n (n - 1) \\\\over r^2} - {2 n \\\\zeta \\\\over r} + \\\\zeta^2 \\\\right] R(r) Angular dependent derivatives of the spherical harmonics don't depend on the radial function and have to be evaluated separately.

(1978). STO Software Some quantum chemistry software uses sets of Slater-type functions (STF) analogous to Slater type orbitals, but with variable exponents chosen to minimize the total molecular energy (rather than by Slater's rules as above). The fact that products of two STOs on distinct atoms are more difficult to express than those of Gaussian functions (which give a displaced Gaussian) has led many to expand them in terms of Gaussians. Analytical ab initio software for polyatomic molecules has been developed, e.g., STOP: a Slater Type Orbital Package in 1996. SMILES uses analytical expressions when available and Gaussian expansions otherwise. It was first released in 2000. Various grid integration schemes have been developed, sometimes after analytical work for quadrature (Scrocco), most famously in the ADF suite of DFT codes. After the work of John Pople, Warren. J. Hehre and Robert J. Steward, a least squares representation of the Slater atomic orbitals as a sum of Gaussian-type orbitals is used. In their 1969 paper, the fundamentals of this principle are discussed and then further improved and used in the GAUSSIAN DFT code. See also *Basis sets used in computational chemistry References       Category:Quantum chemistry Category:Computational chemistry ","title":"Slater-type orbital"},{"id":"405783","text":"In computational chemistry and molecular physics, Gaussian orbitals (also known as Gaussian type orbitals, GTOs or Gaussians) are functions used as atomic orbitals in the LCAO method for the representation of electron orbitals in molecules and numerous properties that depend on these.  Rationale  The use of Gaussian orbitals in electronic structure theory (instead of the more physical Slater-type orbitals) was first proposed by Boys in 1950. The principal reason for the use of Gaussian basis functions in molecular quantum chemical calculations is the 'Gaussian Product Theorem', which guarantees that the product of two GTOs centered on two different atoms is a finite sum of Gaussians centered on a point along the axis connecting them. In this manner, four-center integrals can be reduced to finite sums of two-center integrals, and in a next step to finite sums of one-center integrals. The speedup by 4‚Äî5 orders of magnitude compared to Slater orbitals more than outweighs the extra cost entailed by the larger number of basis functions generally required in a Gaussian calculation. For reasons of convenience, many quantum chemistry programs work in a basis of Cartesian Gaussians even when spherical Gaussians are requested, as integral evaluation is much easier in the cartesian basis, and the spherical functions can be simply expressed using the cartesian functions.  Mathematical form  The Gaussian basis functions obey the usual radial-angular decomposition : \\\\ \\\\Phi(\\\\mathbf{r}) = R_l(r) Y_{lm}(\\\\theta,\\\\phi), where Y_{lm}(\\\\theta,\\\\phi) is a spherical harmonic, l and m are the angular momentum and its z component, and r,\\\\theta,\\\\phi are spherical coordinates. While for Slater orbitals the radial part is : \\\\ R_l(r) = A(l,\\\\alpha) r^l e^{-\\\\alpha r}, A(l,\\\\alpha) being a normalization constant, for Gaussian primitives the radial part is : \\\\ R_l(r) = B(l,\\\\alpha) r^l e^{-\\\\alpha r^2}, where B(l,\\\\alpha) is the normalization constant corresponding to the Gaussian. The normalization condition which determines A(l,\\\\alpha) or B(l,\\\\alpha) is :\\\\int _0 ^\\\\infty \\\\mathrm{d}r \\\\, r^2 \\\\left R_l (r) \\\\right^2 = 1 which in general does not impose orthogonality in l. Because an individual primitive Gaussian function gives a rather poor description for the electronic wave function near the nucleus, Gaussian basis sets are almost always contracted: :\\\\ R_l(r) = r^l \\\\sum_{p=1,P} c_p B(l,\\\\alpha_p) \\\\exp(-\\\\alpha_p r^2), where c_p is the contraction coefficient for the primitive with exponent \\\\alpha_p. The coefficients are given with respect to normalized primitives, because coefficients for unnormalized primitives would differ by many orders of magnitude. The exponents are reported in atomic units. There is a large library of published Gaussian basis sets optimized for a variety of criteria available at the Basis Set Exchange portal. =Cartesian Coordinates= In Cartesian coordinates, Gaussian-type orbitals can be written in terms of exponential factors in the x, y, and z directions as well as an exponential factor \\\\alpha controlling the width of the orbital. The expression for a Cartesian Gaussian-type orbital, with the appropriate normalization coefficient is :\\\\Phi(x,y,z;\\\\alpha,i,j,k)=\\\\left(\\\\frac{2\\\\alpha}{\\\\pi}\\\\right)^{3/4}\\\\left[\\\\frac{(8\\\\alpha)^{i+j+k}i!j!k!}{(2i)!(2j)!(2k)!}\\\\right]^{1/2}x^i y^j z^k e^{-\\\\alpha(x^2+y^2+z^2)} In the above expression, i, j, and k must be integers. If i+j+k=0, then the orbital has spherical symmetry and is considered an s-type GTO. If i+j+k=1, the GTO possesses axial symmetry along one axis and is considered a p-type GTO. When i+j+k=2, there are six possible GTOs that may be constructed; this is one more than the five canonical d orbital functions for a given angular quantum number. To address this, a linear combination of two d-type GTOs can be used to reproduce a canonical d function. Similarly, there exist 10 f-type GTOs, but only 7 canonical f orbital functions; this pattern continues for higher angular quantum numbers. Molecular integrals Taketa et al. (1966) presented the necessary mathematical equations for obtaining matrix elements in the Gaussian basis. Since then much work has been done to speed up the evaluation of these integrals which are the slowest part of many quantum chemical calculations. ≈Ωivkoviƒá and Maksiƒá (1968) suggested using Hermite Gaussian functions, as this simplifies the equations. McMurchie and Davidson (1978) introduced recursion relations, which greatly reduces the amount of calculations. Pople and Hehre (1978) developed a local coordinate method. Obara and Saika introduced efficient recursion relations in 1985, which was followed by the development of other important recurrence relations. Gill and Pople (1990) introduced a 'PRISM' algorithm which allowed efficient use of 20 different calculation paths. The POLYATOM System The POLYATOM SystemI.G. Csizmadia, M.C. Harrison, J.W.

Complementary colors in the traditional RYB color model. Colors that are opposite on a color wheel. Complementary colors in the opponent process theory. Complementary colors are pairs of colors which, when combined or mixed, cancel each other out (lose hue) by producing a grayscale color like white or black.Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, 5th Edition, Oxford University Press (2002) \\"A color that combined with a given color makes white or black.\\" When placed next to each other, they create the strongest contrast for those two colors. Complementary colors may also be called \\"opposite colors.\\" Which pairs of colors are considered complementary depends on the color theory one uses: *Modern color theory uses either the RGB additive color model or the CMY subtractive color model, and in these, the complementary pairs are red‚Äìcyan, green‚Äìmagenta, and blue‚Äìyellow. *In the traditional RYB color model, the complementary color pairs are red‚Äìgreen, yellow‚Äìpurple, and blue‚Äìorange. *Opponent process theory suggests that the most contrasting color pairs are red‚Äìgreen, and blue‚Äìyellow. In different color models =Traditional color model= The traditional color wheel model dates to the 18th century and is still used by many artists today. This model designates red, yellow and blue as primary colors with the primary‚Äìsecondary complementary pairs of red‚Äìgreen, blue-orange, and yellow‚Äìpurple. In this traditional scheme, a complementary color pair contains one primary color (yellow, blue or red) and a secondary color (green, purple or orange). The complement of any primary color can be made by combining the two other primary colors. For example, to achieve the complement of yellow (a primary color) one could combine red and blue. The result would be purple, which appears directly across from yellow on the color wheel. Continuing with the color wheel model, one could then combine yellow and purple, which essentially means that all three primary colors would be present at once. Since paints work by absorbing light, having all three primaries together produces a black or gray color (see subtractive color). In more recent painting manuals, the more precise subtractive primary colors are magenta, cyan and yellow.for example, see Isabelle Roelofs and Fabien Petillion, La Couleur expliqu√©e aux artistes, p. 16 Complementary colors can create some striking optical effects. The shadow of an object appears to contain some of the complementary color of the object. For example, the shadow of a red apple will appear to contain a little blue-green. This effect is often copied by painters who want to create more luminous and realistic shadows. Also, if you stare at a square of color for a long period of time (thirty seconds to a minute), and then look at a white paper or wall, you will briefly see an afterimage of the square in its complementary color. Placed side-by-side as tiny dots, in partitive color mixing, complementary colors appear gray. =Colors produced by light= The RGB color model, invented in the 19th century and fully developed in the 20th century, uses combinations of red, green, and blue light against a black background to make the colors seen on a computer monitor or television screen. In the RGB model, the primary colors are red, green, and blue. The complementary primary‚Äìsecondary combinations are red‚Äìcyan, green‚Äìmagenta, and blue‚Äìyellow. In the RGB color model, the light of two complementary colors, such as red and cyan, combined at full intensity, will make white light, since two complementary colors contain light with the full range of the spectrum. If the light is not fully intense, the resulting light will be gray. In some other color models, such as the HSV color space, the neutral colors (white, grays, and black) lie along a central axis. Complementary colors (as defined in HSV) lie opposite each other on any horizontal cross-section. For example, in the CIE 1931 color space a color of a \\"dominant\\" wavelength can be mixed with an amount of the complementary wavelength to produce a neutral color (gray or white).

Complementary colors are opposite each other. File:HSV cylinder.pngThe HSV color wheel has the same complementary colors as the RGB color model, but shows them in three dimensions. File:Colour Combinations Chart.pngA chart of color combinations. =Color printing= In the CMYK color model, the primary colors magenta, cyan, and yellow together make black, and the complementary pairs are magenta‚Äìgreen, yellow‚Äìblue, and cyan‚Äìred. Color printing, like painting, also uses subtractive colors, but the complementary colors are different from those used in painting. As a result, the same logic applies as to colors produced by light. Color printing uses the CMYK color model, making colors by overprinting cyan, magenta, yellow, and black ink. In printing the most common complementary colors are magenta‚Äìgreen, yellow‚Äìblue, and cyan‚Äìred. In terms of complementary/opposite colors, this model gives exactly the same result as using the RGB model. Black is added when needed to make the colors darker. In theory and art =In color theory= The effect that colors have upon each other had been noted since antiquity. In his essay On Colors, Aristotle observed that \\"when light falls upon another color, then, as a result of this new combination, it takes on another nuance of color.\\"On Colors or De Coloribus (793b) cited in John Gage, Couleur et Culture, pg. 13 Saint Thomas Aquinas had written that purple looked different next to white than it did next to black, and that gold looked more striking against blue than it did against white; the Italian Renaissance architect and writer Leon Battista Alberti observed that there was harmony (coniugatio in Latin, and amicizia in Italian) between certain colors, such as red‚Äìgreen and red‚Äìblue; and Leonardo da Vinci observed that the finest harmonies were those between colors exactly opposed (retto contrario), but no one had a convincing scientific explanation why that was so until the 18th century. In 1704, in his treatise on optics, Isaac Newton devised a circle showing a spectrum of seven colors. In this work and in an earlier work in 1672, he observed that certain colors around the circle were opposed to each other and provided the greatest contrast; he named red and blue, yellow and violet, and green and \\"a purple close to scarlet.\\"John Gage, Couleur et culture, pg. 172. In the following decades, scientists refined Newton's color circle, eventually giving it twelve colors: the three primary colors (yellow, blue, and red); three secondary colors (green, purple and orange), made by combining primary colors; and six additional tertiary colors, made by combining the primary and secondary colors. In two reports read before the Royal Society (London) in 1794, the American-born British scientist Benjamin Thompson, Count Rumford (1753‚Äì1814), coined the term _complement_ to describe two colors that, when mixed, produce white. While conducting photometric experiments on factory lighting in Munich, Thompson noticed that an \\"imaginary\\" blue color was produced in the shadow of yellow candlelight illuminated by skylight, an effect that he reproduced in other colors by means of tinted glasses and pigmented surfaces. He theorized that \\"To every color, without exception, whatever may be its hue or shade, or however it may be compounded, there is another in perfect harmony to it, which is its complement, and may be said to be its companion.\\" He also suggested some possible practical uses of this discovery. \\"By experiments of this kind, which might easily be made, ladies may choose ribbons for their gowns, or those who furnish rooms may arrange their colors upon principles of the most perfect harmony and of the purest taste. The advantages that painters might derive from a knowledge of these principles of the harmony of colors are too obvious to require illustration.\\"Benjamin Thompson, Count Rumford, Conjectures respecting the Principle of the Harmony of Colors, The Complete Works of Count Rumford, Volume 5, pp. 67‚Äì68. (Google Books). In the early 19th century, scientists and philosophers across Europe began studying the nature and interaction of colors. The German poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe presented his own theory in 1810, stating that the two primary colors were those in the greatest opposition to each other, yellow and blue, representing light and darkness. He wrote that \\"Yellow is a light which has been dampened by darkness; blue is a darkness weakened by light.\\"Goethe (1810), Theory of Colors, paragraph 502. Out of the opposition of blue and yellow, through a process called \\"steigerung, or \\"augmentation\\" a third color, red, was born. Goethe also proposed several sets of complementary colors which \\"demanded\\" each other. According to Goethe, \\"yellow 'demands' violet; orange [demands] blue; purple [demands] green; and vice versa\\".Goethe, Theory of Colours, trans. Charles Lock Eastlake, Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1982. Goethe's ideas were highly personal and often disagreed with other scientific research, but they were highly popular and influenced some important artists, including J.M.W. Turner.John Gage, Couleur et Culture, pp. 201‚Äì203. At about the same time that Goethe was publishing his theory, a British physicist, doctor and Egyptologist, Thomas Young (1773‚Äì1829), showed by experiments that it was not necessary to use all the colors of spectrum to create white light; it could be done by combining the light of just three colors; red, green, and blue. This discovery was the foundation of additive colors, and of the RGB color model.Isabelle Roelofs and Fabien Petillion, La couleur expliq√©e aux artistes, p. 14. He showed that it was possible to create magenta by combining red and blue light; to create yellow by mixing red and green light; and to create cyan, or blue-green, by mixing green and blue. He also found that it was possible to create virtually any other color by modifying the intensity of these colors. This discovery led to the system used today to create colors on a computer or television display. Young was also the first to propose that the retina of the eye contained nerve fibers which were sensitive to three different colors. This foreshadowed the modern understanding of color vision, in particular the finding that the eye does indeed have three color receptors which are sensitive to different wavelength ranges. At about the same time as Young discovered additive colors, another British scientist, David Brewster (1781‚Äì1868), the inventor of the kaleidoscope, proposed a competing theory that the true primary colors were red, yellow, and blue, and that the true complementary pairs were red‚Äìgreen, blue‚Äìorange, and yellow‚Äìpurple. Then a German scientist, Hermann von Helmholtz, (1821‚Äì1894), resolved the debate by showing that colors formed by light, additive colors, and those formed by pigments, subtractive colors, did in fact operate by different rules, and had different primary and complementary colors.Isabelle Roelofs and Fabien Petillion, La couleur expliqu√©e aux artistes, p. 18. Other scientists looked more closely at the use of complementary colors. In 1828, the French chemist Eugene Chevreul, making a study of the manufacture of Gobelin tapestries to make the colors brighter, demonstrated scientifically that \\"the arrangement of complementary colors is superior to any other harmony of contrasts.\\" His 1839 book on the subject, De la loi du contraste simultan√© des couleurs et de l'assortiment des objets color√©s, showing how complementary colors can be used in everything from textiles to gardens, was widely read in Germany, France and England, and made complementary colors a popular concept. The use of complementary colors was further publicized by the French art critic Charles Blanc in his book Grammaire des arts et du dessin (1867) and later by the American color theorist Ogden Rood in his book Modern Chromatics (1879). These books were read with great enthusiasm by contemporary painters, particularly Georges Seurat and Vincent van Gogh, who put the theories into practice in their paintings.John Gage, Couleur et culture, pp. 174‚Äì75 File:Newton's color circle.pngNewton's color circle (1704) displayed seven colors. He declared that colors opposite each other had the strongest contrast and harmony. File:Boutet 1708 color circles.jpgA Boutet color circle from 1708 showed the traditional complementary colors; red and green, yellow and purple, and blue and orange. File:GoetheFarbkreis.jpgThe color wheel designed by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1810) was based on the idea that the primary colors yellow and blue, representing light and darkness, were in opposition to each other. =In art= In 1872, Claude Monet painted Impression, Sunrise, a tiny orange sun and some orange light reflected on the clouds and water in the center of a hazy blue landscape. This painting, with its striking use of the complementary colors orange and blue, gave its name to the impressionist movement. Monet was familiar with the science of complementary colors, and used them with enthusiasm. He wrote in 1888, \\"color makes its impact from contrasts rather than from its inherent qualities....the primary colors seem more brilliant when they are in contrast with their complementary colors.\\"Philip Ball, Histoire vivante des couleurs, p. 260. Orange and blue became an important combination for all the impressionist painters. They all had studied the recent books on color theory, and they knew that orange placed next to blue made both colors much brighter. Auguste Renoir painted boats with stripes of chrome orange paint straight from the tube. Paul C√©zanne used orange made of touches of yellow, red and ochre against a blue background. Vincent van Gogh was especially known for using this technique; he created his own oranges with mixtures of yellow, ochre and red, and placed them next to slashes of sienna red and bottle-green, and below a sky of turbulent blue and violet. He also put an orange moon and stars in a cobalt blue sky. He wrote to his brother Theo of \\"searching for oppositions of blue with orange, of red with green, of yellow with purple, searching for broken colors and neutral colors to harmonize the brutality of extremes, trying to make the colors intense, and not a harmony of greys.\\"Vincent van Gogh, Lettres √† Theo, p. 184. Describing his painting, The Night Caf√©, to his brother Theo in 1888, Van Gogh wrote: \\"I sought to express with red and green the terrible human passions. The hall is blood-red and pale yellow, with a green billiard table in the center, and four lamps of lemon yellow, with rays of orange and green. Everywhere it is a battle and antithesis of the most different reds and greens.\\"Vincent van Gogh, Corr√©spond√©nce general, number 533, cited by John Gage, Practice and Meaning from Antiquity to Abstraction. File:Claude Monet, Impression, soleil levant.jpgImpression, Sunrise by Claude Monet (1872) featured a tiny but vivid orange sun against a blue background. The painting gave its name to the Impressionist movement. File:Renoir12.jpgOarsmen at Chatou by Pierre-Auguste Renoir (1879). Renoir knew that orange and blue brightened each other when put side by side. File:SelbstPortrait VG2.jpgIn this self-portrait (1889), Vincent Van Gogh made the most of the contrast between the orange of his hair and the blue background. File:VanGogh-starry night ballance1.jpgStarry Night by Vincent van Gogh (1889) features orange stars and an orange moon. File:Vincent Willem van Gogh 076.jpgThe Night Caf√© by Vincent van Gogh (1888) used red and green to express what van Gogh called \\"the terrible human passions\\". Afterimages When one stares at a single color (red for example) for a sustained period of time (roughly thirty seconds to a minute), then looks at a white surface, an afterimage of the complementary color (in this case cyan) will appear. This is one of several aftereffects studied in the psychology of visual perception which are generally ascribed to fatigue in specific parts of the visual system. In the case above the photoreceptors for red light in the retina are fatigued, lessening their ability to send the information to the brain. When white light is viewed, the red portions of light incident upon the eye are not transmitted as efficiently as the other wavelengths (or colors), and the result is the illusion of viewing the complementary color since the image is now biased by loss of the color, in this case red. As the receptors are given time to rest, the illusion vanishes. In the case of looking at the white light, red light is still incident upon the eye (as well as blue and green), however since the receptors for other light colors are also being fatigued, the eye will reach an equilibrium. Practical applications The use of complementary colors is an important aspect of aesthetically pleasing art and graphic design. This also extends to other fields such as contrasting colors in logos and retail display. When placed next to each other, complements make each other appear brighter. Complementary colors also have more practical uses. Because orange and blue are complementary colors, life rafts and life vests are traditionally orange, to provide the highest contrast and visibility when seen from ships or aircraft over the ocean. Red and cyan glasses are used in the Anaglyph 3D system to produce 3D images on computer screens.

Although it was originally planned for the college to be named Oliver Cromwell College, this proved too controversialHill, Christopher; God's Englishman ‚Äì Oliver Cromwell and the English Revolution (Penguin, 1970) p. 265. and it was instead named after Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey, who was prime minister at the time of the university's foundation. History View of Durham Cathedral from Grey College Founded in 1959, Grey was the first college of the university's post- war expansion, and the second college to open on Elvet Hill after St Mary's. It was also the last college founded before the separation of Durham and Newcastle in 1963. The college initially only admitted men, but has been mixed since 1984. In March 1959, just a few months before the opening of the college, the Elvet block (then the main block of the college) was devastated by fire. However, the college recovered to open as scheduled in October and adopted the phoenix as its unofficial badge. The college coat of arms features a scaling ladder (or gr√©‚Äîthe badge of the Grey family) between two St Cuthbert's crosses (the symbol of Durham). A new grant of arms in 2004 confirmed these and added the phoenix as a crest. Fountains Hall was completed in 1971 and the Lattin Chapel, named after former college bursar Frank Lattin, was consecrated on 18 November 1973 by the Bishop of Durham, John Habgood. During the 1966 World Cup, Grey was home to the Soviet Union's football team who were playing their group matches in Sunderland and Middlesbrough. They won all their matches while based in Durham, but eventually lost to West Germany in the semi-finals. Grey College was exclusively for male students until the start of the 1984‚Äì1985 academic year, when a contingent of nineteen women joined the college in their first year as a pilot program. These first female members of the college had been assigned to Grey, rather than having chosen it, since they had not specified a college of residence at the time they had applied to the University of Durham. Few changes were made to accommodate the new mixed-sex living arrangements‚Äîtoilet and bathroom facilities were shared, for instance. Female students could, however, request lace curtains in addition to the regular fabric curtains for their rooms. In the following year, 1985‚Äì1986, Grey College opened its doors to all women, who could now actively apply to join the college. By the time these women had graduated three years later, Grey had become indistinguishable in population from the other mixed-sex colleges of the university. In 1992 a plan to construct a fourth accommodation block was announced. This became Holgate House, named after the college's first matter, Sydney Holgate, and was opened in 1996. The Victor Watts Memorial Library, named after the college's third master, opened as an extension to Holgate House in 2005. Buildings Fountains Hall, Grey College There are four accommodation blocks on site: Hollingside (the main building), Elvet, Oswald and Holgate House. Grey was the first college in Durham to have all of its bedrooms connected to the university computer network. The college offers a number of other facilities: Hollingside contains the 350-seat dining room (the college is fully catered), the college bar and the Junior Common Room (JCR), which has the largest TV of any Durham college, while Holgate House has a conference centre and a library with over 7,000 books. A fifth building, Fountains Hall, is the home of Phoenix Theatre Company (PTC), and also contains the college chapel, a multi-purpose hall (for everything from badminton to band practice), and a toastie bar. The University Botanic Garden and the High Wood are located next door to the college, and a path leads directly to the Science Site. College life Notable social events include the fireworks display (the largest in Durham); \\"The Informal Ball\\" with its fancy dress themes; and \\"Grey Day\\", a mix of fun events on the lawn and college bands, traditionally accompanied by the consumption of alcohol. The year comes to an end with \\"The Phoenix Ball\\", the largest and most lavish social event of the year. Grey has a large number of sports clubs, ranging from Grey College Boat Club through Grey College Ultimate Frisbee Club to team croquet. Many of Grey's sporting clubs have enjoyed success in recent years, notably the women's hockey team, boat club, darts team, rugby team, football team, cheerleading squad and Ultimate Frisbee Club. Members of the college sometimes refer to themselves as the \\"Grey Army\\" and can be found at many college sporting events (usually rugby games) supporting the team, with a \\"Commander-in-Chief\\" appointed by the JCR each academic year to lead the troops. Another mascot of the college is the \\"College Trout\\"‚Äîa Big Mouth Billy Hamill toy that is currently stationed behind the bar. A bi-annual magazine, Grey Matter, also exists to satirise college events. Grey also has termly art exhibitions which were developed by alumnus Henry Dyson. One such was 'My Mining Days' by Tom Lamb which gave an insight into the experience and culture of mining within the area. The college has a fellowship in mathematics (the Alan David Richards Fellowship) and a general fellowship scheme (the Sidney Holgate Fellowships), which includes funding for research fellows and an artist in residence.

He is said to have antlers growing from his head, ride a horse, torment cattle, and rattle chains. The earliest mention of Herne comes from William Shakespeare's 1597 play The Merry Wives of Windsor, and it is impossible to know how accurately or to what degree Shakespeare may have incorporated a real local legend into his work, though there have been several later attempts to connect Herne to historical figures, pagan deities, or ancient archetypes. Legend There is little written evidence for Herne the Hunter before the 1840s, and the details of his original folk tale have been filtered through the various versions of Shakespeare's The Merry Wives of Windsor. Officially published versions of the play refer only to the tale of Herne as the ghost of a former Windsor Forest keeper who haunts a particular oak tree at midnight in the winter time. The earliest written account of Herne comes from Shakespeare's play \\"The Merry Wives of Windsor\\", in which he is said to have horns, shake chains and cause cattle to produce blood instead of milk: An early, pirated version of the play from 1602 includes a different version of this text, which states that the ghost (spelled \\"Horne\\" in this version) was invented to scare children into obedience, and that mothers tell their children the tale of a ghost who walks the forest in the form of a great stag. Because it is a common surname, it is not possible to further identify Shakespeare's Herne, and no earlier references to his legend exist.Westwood, J. Haunted England: The Penguin Book of Ghosts. Penguin UK, 2013. Two hundred years later, in 1792, Samuel Ireland slightly expanded on Shakespeare as follows: It has been noted that the reference to Herne's death as a suicide fits a traditional belief that this sort of death is more likely to produce a haunting. Shakespeare's reference to rattling chains also fits a very common ghostly motif. However, other elements of the tale are unusual for other ghost stories of Shakespeare's era. Ghostly cattle or dogs were common, but there are few contemporary examples of a ghostly stag. It is possible that Shakespeare invented this detail to better fit the forest setting, or to lead into the humorous image of a character wearing antlers, which would have resembled cuckold's horns to an Elizabethan audience. It was also unusual for ghosts of this period to produce such damaging effects. Herne is described bewitching (\\"taking\\") cattle, bloodying their milk, and causing trees to wither. =Herne's Oak= Herne's Oak Herne became widely popularised after his appearance in Shakespeare's play, and the supposed location of Herne's Oak was, for many years, a matter of local speculation and controversy. Some Ordnance Survey maps show Herne's Oak a little to the north of Frogmore House in the Home Park (adjoining Windsor Great Park). This tree was felled in 1796. In 1838, Edward Jesse claimed that a different tree in the avenue was the real Herne's Oak, and this gained in popularity especially with Queen Victoria. This tree was blown down on 31 August 1863, and Queen Victoria had another tree planted on the same site. The Queen's tree was removed in 1906 when the avenue was replanted. One of the new oaks planted in 1906 is currently given the title of Herne's Oak. =Later additions= Further details have entered the folklore from even later sources and reported sightings, such as those in the 1920s.R. Lowe Thompson, The History of the Devil 1929 p. 134 William Harrison Ainsworth's 1843 novel Windsor Castle featured Herne and popularised his legend. Ainsworth's version of the tale added a number of new details, including having Herne being gored by a stag, only to have the Devil save him on the condition that he wear the stag's antlers. Jacob Grimm was the first to suggest, very influentially, that Herne had once been thought of as the leader of the Wild Hunt, based on his title. In the 20th century, further details were added to Herne's legend, including the idea that his ghost appears shortly before national disasters and the deaths of kings. It was also during the 20th century that incidents of personal encounters with the ghost, or of people hearing his hounds and horn in Windsor Forest, were first reported. Possible origins Various theories have been proposed to account for the origin of the character, none of which has been proved conclusive, and the source for many of the tales told of Herne remain unknown. =Pal√¶olithic origins and relationship with the Celtic Cernunnos= In his 1929 book The History of the Devil ‚Äì The Horned God of the West R. Lowe Thompson suggests that \\"Herne\\" as well as other Wild Huntsmen in European folklore all derive from the same ancient source, citing that \\"Herne\\" may be a cognate of the name of Gaulish deity Cernunnos in the same way that the English \\"horn\\" is a cognate of the Latin \\"cornu\\" (see Grimm's Law for more details on this linguistic feature) explaining that \\"As the Latin cornu changes into horn so might Cerne change into Herne.\\" He adds, \\"In any case the reader may also be prepared to recognize Cernunnos and the older magician, who emerge as the Wild Huntsman. My assumption is that these two forms have been derived from the same Pal√¶olithic ancestor and can, indeed, be regarded as two aspects of one central figure, will help us to understand the identification of Herlechin and Herne, whom I will take as the most familiar example of the huntsman.\\"The History of the Devil by R. Lowe Thompson, 1920, page 133 Some modern Neopagans such as Wiccans accept Lowe Thompson's equation of Herne with Cernunnos (which they further connect to the Greco-Roman god Pan).'Simple Wicca: A simple wisdom book' by Michele Morgan, Conari, 2000, , Herne however is a localised figure, not found outside Berkshire and the regions of the surrounding counties into which Windsor Forest once spread. Clear evidence for the worship of Cernunnos has however been recovered only on the European mainland, and not in Britain.Ronald Hutton, The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles: Their Nature and Legacy, People of the Mist (ch. 5) \\"Herne\\" could be derived ultimately from the same Indo-European root, *ker-n-, meaning bone or horn from which \\"Cernunnos\\" derives. However a more direct source may be the Old English hyrne, meaning \\"horn\\" or \\"corner\\",Shipley, Joseph Twadell. 'Dictionary of Early English'. Philosophical Library, 1955.

William Smith (Booksellers) Ltd. . =Anglo-Saxon deity= In the Early Middle Ages, Windsor Forest came under the control of the pagan Angles who worshipped their own pantheon of gods, including Woden, whose Norse equivalent Odin rode across the night sky with his own Wild Hunt and hanged himself on the world tree Yggdrasil to learn the secret of the runic alphabet. It has been suggested that the name Herne is derived from the title Herian,Matthews, J. The Quest for the Green Man.

Berg Publishers, 2005. , . p. 120 =Historical individual= Samuel Ireland identified Herne as a real historical individual, saying that he died an unholy death of the type that might have given rise to tales of hauntings by his unquiet spirit. The fact that Herne is apparently a purely local figure supports this theory. One possibility is that Herne is supposed to be the ghost of Richard Horne, a yeoman during the reign of Henry VIII who was caught poaching in the wood. This suggestion was first made by James Halliwell-Phillipps, who identified a document listing Horne as a \\"hunter\\" who had confessed to poaching.Hedley, Windsor Castle, 93. The earliest edition of The Merry Wives of Windsor spells the name \\"Horne\\".Jeffrey Theis, The \\"ill kill'd\\" Deer: Poaching and Social Order in The Merry Wives of Windsor, Texas Studies in Literature and Language 43.1 (2001) 46‚Äì73.

It is Herne who encourages Loxley to become 'Robin in the Hood' and to use his band of outlaws to fight for good against the evil Norman oppressors. Herne's appearance bears a very strong resemblance to the illustrations that previously depicted him, in that an otherwise unnamed shaman character, portrayed by actor John Abineri, dons a stag's head and tells Robin that \\"when the horned one possesses [him]\\", he becomes the spirit of the forest. Herne featured in 17 of the 26 episodes of the series and was shown to have various magical abilities.

Quantum Theory of Atoms, Molecules and the Solid State, A Tribute to John C. Slater, Academic Press, N.Y. 1966. He also made major contributions to microwave electronics. He received a B.S. in Physics from the University of Rochester in 1920 and a Ph.D. in Physics from Harvard in 1923, then did post-doctoral work at the universities of Cambridge (briefly) and Copenhagen. On his return to the U.S. he joined the Physics Department at Harvard. In 1930, Karl Compton, the President of MIT, appointed Slater as Chairman of the MIT Department of Physics. He recast the undergraduate physics curriculum, wrote 14 books between 1933 and 1968, and built a department of major international prestige. During World War II, his work on microwave transmission, done partly at the Bell Laboratories and in association with the MIT Radiation Laboratory, was of major importance in the development of radar. In 1950, Slater founded the Solid State and Molecular Theory Group (SSMTG) within the Physics Department. The following year, he resigned the chairmanship of the department and spent a year at the Brookhaven National Laboratory of the Atomic Energy Commission. He was appointed Institute Professor of Physics and continued to direct work in the SSMTG until he retired from MIT in 1965, at the mandatory retirement age of 65. He then joined the Quantum Theory Project of the University of Florida as Research Professor, where the retirement age allowed him to work for another five years. The SSMTG has been regarded as the precursor of the MIT Center for Materials Science and Engineering (CMSE). His scientific autobiography and three interviewsOral History Transcript - Dr. John C. Slater, interviewed by Charles Weiner, Niels Bohr Center and Archives for the History of Physics. Session I, Gainesville, February 23, 1970., Session II, MIT, August 7, 1970. present his views on research, education and the role of science in society. In 1964, Slater and his then-92 year-old father, who had headed the Department of English at the University of Rochester many years earlier, were awarded honorary degrees by that university. Slater's name is part of the terms Bohr-Kramers-Slater theory, Slater determinant and Slater orbital. Early life and education Slater's father, born in Virginia, who had been an undergraduate at Harvard, became head of the English Department at the University of Rochester, which would also be Slater's undergraduate alma mater. Slater's youthful interests were with things mechanical, chemical, and electrical. A family helper, a college girl, finally put a name (then little- known as a subject) to his set of interests: physics. When Slater entered the University of Rochester in 1917 he took physics courses and as a senior assisted in the physics laboratory and did his first independent research for a special honors thesis, a measurement of the dependence on pressure of the intensities of the Balmer lines of hydrogen. He was accepted into Harvard graduate school, with the choice of a fellowship or assistantship. He chose the assistantship, during which he worked for Percy W. Bridgman. He followed Bridgman's courses in fundamental physics and was introduced into the then-new quantum physics with the courses of E. C. Kemble. He completed the work for the Ph.D. in three years by publishing his (1924) paper Compressibility of the Alkali Halides, which embodied the thesis work he had done under Bridgman. His heart was in theory, and his first publication was not his doctor's thesis, but a note (1924) to Nature on Radiation and Atoms. After receiving his Ph.D., Slater held a Hamard Sheldon Fellowship for study in Europe. He spent a period in Cambridge, England, before going to Copenhagen. On returning to America, Slater joined the Harvard Physics Department.  Professional career  =Chairing the Department of Physics at MIT= When he became President of MIT, Karl Compton \\"courted\\" Slater to chair the Physics Department. \\"Administration (of the Department) took up a good deal of time, more time than he (Slater) would have preferred. John was a good chairman.\\" The following items from the successive issues of the annual MIT President's ReportPresident's Report, Massachusetts Institute of Technology Bulletin, volume 622, number 1, 1930, 1931, 1932, 1933, 1934, 1935, 1936, 1937, 1938, 1939, 1940, 1941, 1942, 1943, 1946, 1947, 1948, 1949, 1950, 1951, 1952, 1962, 1963, 1964 trace the growth and visibility of the Department under Slater's leadership, before World War II, and the ability of the Department to contribute to defense during the war. The first two quotations are from chapters written by Compton in the successive Reports. The other quotations come from the sections about the department, that Slater wrote. These include statements affecting policies in physics education and research at large, and show his deep commitment to both. * 1930: \\"The selection of Dr. John C. Slater as head of the (Physics) Department will strengthen ... undergraduate and graduate work ... the limitation of space has retarded the development of graduate work ... the total number of undergraduates being 53 and ... graduate students 16.\\" (p. 21) * 1931: \\"This has been the first year of the Department in charge of its new Head, Professor John C. Slater ... the subjects actively (researched include) Spectroscopy, Applied Optics, Discharge of Electricity in Gases, Magneto-Optical Phenomena, Studies of Dielectrics, and various aspects of modern and classical theoretical physics.\\" (p. 42) * 1932: In the list of papers published by MIT faculty, items 293 to 340 are listed under Department of Physics. (p. 206-208) * 1933: \\"The George Eastman Research Laboratory, into which the Department moved at the beginning of the year, provides for the first time a suitable home for research in Physics at the Institute\\". Slater states that outside recognition is shown by holders of six National, an International, and a Rockefeller Research Fellowship choosing to come to the Department. Slater describes the dedication of the Laboratory, the hosting of meetings of the International Astronomical Union, the American Physical Society, and a Spectroscopic conference, and ends: \\"In general the year has been one of settling down to work under satisfactory conditions, after the more difficult transition of the preceding year.\\" (p. 96-98) * 1934: \\"A number of advances in undergraduate teaching have been made or planned.\\" Among the \\"most conspicuous events\\" in the department, \\"we acted as host\\" to meetings of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Physical Society, and a national Spectroscopic Conference, where \\"the main topic was relation to biology and related fields.\\" Advances in research have been \\"taking advantage of the unusual facilities\\" in the Department, and include the work of Warren on structure of liquids, Mueller on dielectric properties, Stockbarger on crystal physics, Harrison on automating spectroscopic measurement, Wulff on hyperfine structure, Boyce on spectra of nebulae, Van der Graaff on high voltage and nuclear research, and Stratton and Morse on ellipsoidal wave functions. (p. 104-106) * 1935: Considerable attention is given to major improvements in undergraduate teaching. The extensive comments on research mention the arrival of Robley Evans and his work on a field new to the department‚Äîradioactivity, with special attention to nuclear medicine. (p. 102-103) * 1936: \\"The most important development of the year in the Department has been the growing recognition of the significance of applied physics. There has been a tendency in the past among physicists to take interest only in the direct line of development of their science, and to neglect its applications.\\" Slater develops this theme at length, and describes actions within the undergraduate, graduate and faculty work of the Department and at the national level to develop Applied Physics. The description of the flourishing basic research refers to ten different areas, including the upsurge in work on radioactivity. (p. 131-134). * 1937 to 1941: These continue in the same vein. But world affairs begin to impact. The 1941 report ends: \\"The X-ray branch had as a guest Professor Rose C. L. Mooney of Newcomb College, who was prevented by the war from carrying on research in Europe under a Guggenheim Fellowship ... As the year ends, the National Defense effort is beginning to claim the services of a number of staff members. Presumably the coming year will see a large intensification of the effort, though it is hoped that the interference with the regular research and teaching will not be too severe.\\" (p. 129) * 1942: This told a very different story. The defense effort had begun to \\"involve a considerable number of personnel, as well as a good deal of administrative work. With the opening of the Radiation Laboratory of the National Defense Research Committee at the Institute, a number of members of the Department's staff have become associated with that laboratory\\" followed by a list of over 10 senior faculty who had, and several more gone to other defense projects. (p. 110-111) * 1943 to 1945: Slater took leave of absence as Chair, to work on topics of importance in radar. The American Mathematical Society selected him as the Josiah Willards Gibbs lecturer for 1945.Josiah Willard Gibbs Lectures * 1946: Slater had returned as Chair. He starts his report: \\"The year of reconversion from war to peace has been one of the very greatest activity. ... Physics during the war achieved an importance which has probably never before been attained by any other science. The Institute, as the leading technical institution of the country and probably the world, should properly have a physics department unequaled anywhere.\\" He lists plans to meet this objective, that proliferate his administrative responsibilities. (p. 133-143) :Setting up interdepartmental laboratories, by restructuring existing laboratories using, as a model, the conversion of the Radiation Laboratory into the Research Laboratory of Electronics (RLE) by Julius Stratton and Albert Hill. :Financing student assistantships and helping shape the role of government financing on an unprecedented scale. :Overseeing Robley Evans' Radioactivity Center (containing a cyclotron) and Van de Graaff's High Voltage Laboratory. :Recruiting physicists familiar with the Manhattan project to build the Laboratory for Nuclear Science and Engineering. This was directed by Jerrold Zacharias. Its first members included Bruno Rossi and Victor Weisskopf. :Setting up the Acoustics Laboratory, directed by Richard Bolt, and the Spectroscopy Laboratory directed by the chemist Richard Lord. * 1947: With the hiring of staff and building of laboratories well in hand, Slater begins: \\"The year in the Physics Department, as in the rest of the Institute, was one of starting the large-scale teaching of returned veterans and other students whose academic careers had been interrupted by the war.\\" He goes on to discuss the needs of students, in the entire Institute, for Physics courses and laboratories, with particular mention of the upsurge in electronics and nuclear science, and he reports briefly on the developments following from his previous report. (p. 139-141) * 1948: Slater begins \\"The current year is the first since the war in which the department has approached normal operation. No new major projects or changes of policy have been introduced.\\" But the department that he has built is vastly different from what it was when he started. Sixteen master's degrees and 47 doctor's degrees were granted. Twenty-five Ph.D. recipients got academic appointments in MIT and other universities. Research flourished, and many scientists visited from European universities and elsewhere in the U.S. (p. 141-143) * 1949: The new-styled 'normalcy' continued. \\"The approach to a steady postwar state continued with few unusual occurrences.\\" The graduate curriculum has been revised and cryogenics enhanced. The continued growth of staff, research grants, industrial contacts and volume of publication are treated as matters of continuity, recognizing at the end, that: \\"The administrative load of the department has grown so much (it became) wise to appoint an executive officer\\". Nathaniel Frank, who had worked with John Slater for nearly two decades accepted the post. (p. 149-153) * 1950: The future of the Department had been set. There were \\"few unexpected changes\\". And with the continued growth, \\"almost every research project in the Department has concerned itself with undergraduate research\\". (p. 189-191) * 1951: Jay Stratton writes \\"Professor John C. Slater resigned as Head of the Department of Physics and has been appointed Harry B. Higgins Professor of the Solid State, the first appointment which will carry the title Institute Professor. Professor Slater has been granted a leave of absence for the coming year to carry on research at Brookhaven National Laboratory.\\" (p. 30) Throughout his Chairmanship, Slater taught, wrote books, produced ideas of major scientific importance, and interacted with colleagues throughout the local, national and international scientific communities. At the personal level, Morse states: \\"Through most of (the 1930s) he looked more like an undergraduate than a department head ... he could render his guests weak with laughter simply by counting ... in Danish.\\" Much later, S.B. Trickey wrote \\"While I got to know him reasonably well, I was never able to call J.C. Slater by his given name. His seeming aloofness turned out more to be shyness.\\"Trickey, Of science and scientists in QTP, Molecular Physics, 108 (21-23) 2841-2845, 2010.  Research  =Atoms, molecules and solids: research preceding World War II= Returning in time to 1920, Slater had gone to Harvard to work for a Ph.D. with Percy Bridgman, who studied the behaviour of substances under very high pressures. Slater measured the compressibility of common salt and ten other alkali halides‚Äîcompounds of lithium, sodium, potassium and rubidium, with fluorine, chlorine and bromine. He described the results as \\"exactly in accord with Bohr's recent views of the relation between electron structure and the periodic table\\". This brought Slater's observation concerning the mechanical properties of ionic crystals into line with the theory that Bohr had based on the spectroscopy of gaseous elements. He wrote the alkali halide paper in 1923, having \\"by the summer of 1922\\" been \\"thoroughly indoctrinated ... with quantum theory\\", in part by the courses of Edwin Kemble following a fascination with Bohr's work during his undergraduate days.J.H. Van Vleck, Remarks, Slater Memorial Session, American Physical Society, Chicago, 7 February 1977, quoted in Morse's Biographical Memoir. In 1924, Slater went to Europe on a Harvard Sheldon Fellowship. After a brief stay at the University of Cambridge, he went on to the University of Copenhagen, where \\"he explained to Bohr and Kramers his idea (that was) a sort of forerunner of the duality principle, (hence) the celebrated paper\\" on the work that others dubbed the Bohr-Kramers-Slater (BKS) theory. \\"Slater suddenly became an internationally known name.\\". Interest in this \\"old-quantum-theory\\" paper subsided with the arrival of full quantum mechanics, but Philp M. Morse's biography states that \\"in recent years it has been recognized that the correct ideas in the article are those of Slater.\\" Slater discusses his early life through the trip to Europe in a transcribed interview.

Hartree's self-consistent field, the quantum mechanical derivation of the Rydberg constant, and the best values of atomic shielding constants, he wrote a seminal paper on directing valency \\" (what became known, later, as linear combination of atomic orbitals). In further comments, John Van Vleck pays particular attention to (1) the 1925 study of the spectra of hydrogen and ionized helium, that J.V.V. considers one sentence short of proposing electron spin (which would have led to sharing a Nobel prize), and (2) what J.V.V. regards as Slater's greatest paper, that introduced the mathematical object now called the Slater determinant. \\"These were some of the achievements (that led to his) election to the National Academy ... at ... thirty-one. He played a key role in lifting American theoretical physics to high international standing.\\" Slater's doctoral students, during this time, included Nathan Rosen Ph.D. in 1932 for a theoretical study of the hydrogen molecule, and William Shockley Ph.D. 1936 for an energy band structure of sodium chloride, who later received a Nobel Prize for the discovery of the transistor. =Research during the war and the return to peace time activities= Slater, in his experimental and theoretical work on the magnetron (key elements paralleled his prior work with self-consistent fields for atoms) and on other topics at the Radiation Laboratory and at the Bell Laboratories did \\"more than any other person to provide the understanding requisite to progress in the microwave field\\", in the words of Mervin Kelley, then head of Bell Labs, quoted by Morse. Slater' publications during the war and the post-war recovery include a book and papers on microwave transmission and microwave electronics,J.C. Slater, Microwave transmission, McGraw-Hill, New York, 1942; reissued Dover Publications, New York, 1959J.C. Slater, Microwave electronics, Reviews of Modern Physics, 18, 441-512, 1946; Microwave electronics, Van Nostrand, Princeton, 1950. linear accelerators,J.C. Slater, The design of linear accelerators, Reviews of Modern Physics, 20, 473-518, 1948. cryogenics,J.C. Slater, The MIT International Conference on the Physics of Very Low Temperatures, Science, 100, 465-467, 1949. and, with Francis Bitter and several other colleagues, superconductors,J.C. Slater, F. Bitter, J.B. Garrison, J. Halpern, E. Maxwell and C.F. Squire, Superconductivity of lead at 3 cm. wave length, Physical Review, 70, 97-98. 1946; J.C. Slater, E. Maxwell and P.M. Marcus, Surface impedance of normal and superconductors at 24,000 megacycles per second, Physical Review, 76, 1331-1347, 1949. These publications credit the many other scientists, mathematicians and engineers who participated. Among these, George H. Vineyard received his Ph.D. with Slater in 1943 for a study of space charge in the cavity magnetron. Later, he became Director of the Brookhaven National Laboratory and President of the American Physical Society. The work of the Radiation Laboratory paralleled research at the Telecommunications Research Establishment in England and the groups maintained a productive liaison. =The Solid State and Molecular Theory Group= Activities In the words of Robert Nesbet: \\"Slater founded the SSMTG with the idea of bringing together a younger generation of students and PostDocs with a common interest in the electronic structure and properties of atoms, molecules and solids. This was in part to serve as a balance for electronic physics to survive the overwhelming growth of nuclear physics following the war\\" .R.K. Nesbet, John C. Slater and the SSMTG in 1954-1956, Molecular Physics, 108 (21-23) 2867-2869, 2010. George Koster soon completed his Ph.D., joined the faculty, and became the senior member of the group. He wrote \\"During the fifteen-year life of the group some sixty persons were members and thirty-four took doctoral degrees with theses connected with its work. In my report I have been unable to separate the work of Slater from that of the group as a whole. He was part of every aspect of the group's research efforts.\\"G. Koster, remarks, Slater Memorial Session, American Physical Society, Chicago, 7 February 1977. Nesbet continued \\"Every morning in SSMTG began with a coffee session, chaired by Professor Slater, with the junior members seated around a long table ... Every member of the group was expected to contribute a summary of his own work and ideas to the Quarterly Progress Report\\". The SMMTG QPRs had a wide distribution to university and industrial research libraries, and to individual laboratories. They were quoted widely for scientific and biographical content, in journal articles and government reports and libraries are starting to put them online.(i) , quotes Slater's biographical comments in QPR 61, 1956 about A. J. Freeman; (ii) , refers to P.M. Scop, QPR 54, 1964; (iii) refers to J.F. Kenney, QPR 53, 38, 1964; (iv) refers to R.E. Watson, QPR 12, 1959; (v) consists of QPR 49, 1963, put online by the Defence Technical Information Center. To begin the work of the group, Slater \\"distilled his experience with the Hartree self-consistent field method\\" into (1) a simplification that became known as the XŒ± method,J. C. Slater, A simplification of the Hartree‚ÄìFock method, Physical Review, 81, 385-390, 1951. and (2) a relationship between a feature of this method and a magnetic property of the system.J. C. Slater, Magnetic effects and the Hartree‚ÄìFock equation, Physical Review, 82, 538-541, 1951. These required computations that were excessive for \\"pencil and paper\\" work. Slater was quick to avail the SSMTG of the electronic computers that were being developed. An early paper on augmented plane waves used an IBM card programmed calculator. The Whirlwind was used heavily, then the IBM 704 in the MIT Computation Center and then the IBM 709 in the Cooperative Computing Laboratory (see below). Solid state work progressed more rapidly at first in the SSMTG, with contributions over the first few years by George Koster, John Wood, Arthur Freeman and Leonard Mattheis. Molecular and atomic calculations also flourished in the hands of Fernando J. Corbat√≥, Lee Allen and Alvin Meckler. This initial work followed lines largely set by Slater. Michael Barnett came in 1958. He and John Wood were given faculty appointments. Robert Nesbet, Brian Sutcliffe, Malcolm Harrison and Levente Szasz brought in a variety of further approaches to molecular and atomic problems. Jens Dahl, Alfred Switendick, Jules Moskowitz, Donald Merrifield and Russell Pitzer did further work on molecules, and Fred Quelle on solids. Slater rarely included his name on the papers of SSMTG members who worked with him. Major pieces of work which he did coauthor dealt with applications of (1) group theory in band structure calculations and (2) equivalent features of linear combination of atomic orbital (LCAO), tight binding and Bloch wave approximations, to interpolate results for the energy levels of solids, obtained by more accurate methods, People A partial list of members of the SSMTG (Ph.D. students, post- doctoral members, research staff and faculty, in some cases successively, labeled ‚Ä†, ‚Ä°, ‡ß≥, ¬∂), together with references that report their SSMTG and later activities, follows. * Leland C.

Fano, Anders Fr√∂man, Inge Fischer-Hjalmars, Douglas Hartree, Werner Heisenberg, Per-Olov L√∂wdin, Chaim Pekeris, Ivar Waller and Peter Wohlfarth. =Slater's further activities at MIT during this time= In the 1962 President's Report, Jay Stratton wrote (on p. 17) \\"A faculty committee under the chairmanship of Professor John C. Slater has taken primary responsibility for planning the facilities in the new Center for Materials. These include a new Cooperative Computing Laboratory completed this year and equipped with an I.B.M. 709 Computer\\". The name Center for Materials Science and Engineering (CMSE) was adopted soon afterward. It embodied the ethos of interdepartmental research and teaching that Slater had espoused throughout his career. The first Director was R.A. Smith, previously Head of the Physics Division of the Royal Radar Establishment in England. He, Slater and Charles Townes, the Provost, had been in close acquaintance since the early years of World War II, working on overlapping topics. The Center was set up, in accordance with Slater's plans. It \\"supported research and teaching in Metallurgy and Materials Science, Electrical Engineering, Physics, Chemistry and Chemical Engineering\\", and preserved MIT as a focus for work in solid state physics. By 1967, two years after Slater left, the MIT Physics Department \\"had a very, very small commitment to condensed matter physics\\" because it was so \\"heavily into high energy physics.\\" But in the same year, the CMSE staff included 55 professors and 179 graduate students. The Center continues to flourish in the 21st century. The Cooperative Computing Laboratory (CCL) was used, in its first year by some 400 faculty, students and staff. These included (1) members of the SSMTG and the CCL running quantum mechanical calculations and non-numeric applicationsM. P. Barnett and R. P. Futrelle, Syntactic analysis by digital computer, Communications of the Association for Computing Machinery, 5, 515-526, 1962; M. P.

Barnett, Some comments suggested by a consideration of computers, in Macromolecular specificity and biological memory, ed. F. O. Schmidt, 24-27, MIT Press, Cambridge, 1962. directed by Slater, Koster, Wood and Barnett, (2) the computer-aided design team of Ross, Coons and Mann, (3) members of the Laboratory for Nuclear Science, (4) Charney and Phillips in theoretical meteorology, and (5) Simpson and Madden in geophysics (from 1964 President's report, p. 336-337).  Personal life and death  In 1926, he had married Helen Frankenfeld. Their three children (Louise Chapin, John Frederick, and Clarke Rothwell) all followed academic careers. Slater was divorced and in 1954 he married Rose Mooney, a physicist and crystallographer, who moved to Florida with him in 1965. At the University of Florida (Gainesville) where the retirement age was 70, Slater was able to enjoy another five years of active research and publication as a Research Professor in the Quantum Theory Project (QTP). In 1975, in his scientific autobiography, he wrote: \\"\\"The Florida Physics Department was a congenial one, with main emphasis on solid state physics, statistical physics and related fields. It reminded me of the MIT department in the days when I had been department head there. It was a far cry from the MIT Physics Department which I was leaving; by then it had been literally captured by the nuclear theorists.\\" Slater published to the end of his life: his final journal paper, published with John Connolly in 1976, was on a novel approach to molecular orbital theory.J.C. Slater and J.W.D. Connolly, Remarks on the overlapping-sphere method for molecular orbitals, International Journal of Quantum Chemistry, 105, 141-46, 1976. Prof. Slater was also Committee Member for Dr. Ravi Sharma's Ph.D.(1966, U of Florida Gainesville) and for many such committees. He and Rose said to Ravi that he had lost his books and research papers when the truck carrying his belongings overturned while moving from MIT to Gainesville. Slater died in Sanibel Island, Florida in 1976. As an educator and advisor Slater's concern for the well being of others is well illustrated by the following dialog that Richard Feynman relates. It took place at the end of his undergraduate days at MIT, when he wanted to stay on to do a Ph.D. \\"When I went to Professor Slater and told him of my intentions he said: 'We will not have you here'. I said 'What?' Slater said 'Why do you think you should go to graduate school at MIT?' 'Because it is the best school for science in the country' ... 'That is why you should go to some other school. You should find out how the rest of the world is.' So I went to Princeton. ... Slater was right. And I often advise my students the same way. Learn what the rest of the world is like. The variety is worthwhile.\\" Summary From the memoir by Philip Morse: \\"He contributed significantly to the start of the quantum revolution in physics; he was one of the very few American-trained physicists to do so. He was exceptional in that he persisted in exploring atomic, molecular and solid state physics, while many of his peers were coerced by war, or tempted by novelty, to divert to nuclear mysteries. Not least, his texts and his lectures contributed materially to the rise of the illustrious American generation of physicists of the 1940s and 1950s.\\" The new generation that Slater launched from the SSMTG and the QTP took knowledge and skills into departments of Physics and Chemistry and Computer Science, into industrial and government laboratories and academe, into research and administration. They have continued and evolved his methodologies, applying them to an increasing variety of topics from atomic energy levels to drug design, and to a host of solids and their properties. Slater imparted knowledge and advice, and he recognized new trends, provided financial support from his grants, and motivational support by sharing the enthusiasms of the protagonists. In a slight paraphrase of a recent and forward looking comment of John Connolly,John Connolly, John C. Slater and the beginnings of density functional theory, Molecular Physics, Volume 108, (21-23), 2863-2866, 2010 it can be said that the contributions of John C. Slater and his students in the SSMTG and the Quantum Theory Project laid the foundations of density functional theory which has become one of the premier approximations in quantum theory today. Slater's papers were bequeathed to the American Philosophical Society by his widow, Rose Mooney Slater, in 1980 and 1982. In August 2003, Alfred Switendick donated a collection of Quarterly Reports of the MIT Solid State and Molecular Theory Group (SSMTG), dating from 1951 to 1965. These are available in several major research libraries. Awards and Honors * Irving Langmuir Award (1967) * Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement (1969) * National Medal of Science (1970) Books  From the Preface (p. v): \\"The present book is the second of several volumes which are intended to replace the Introduction to Theoretical Physics written by the same authors in 1933.

An interpretation divides apocatastasis into three types of restorations, those involving virtuous individuals, nature, and the sinful powers of souls. Etymology and definition While apocatastasis is derived from the Greek verb apokathistemi, which means \\"to restore\\", it first emerged as a doctrine in Zoroastrianism where it is the third time of creation. This period was referred to as wizarishn or the end of history‚Äîthe time of separation and resolution when evil is destroyed and the world is restored to its original state. The idea of apocatastasis may have been derived from the ancient concept of cosmic cycle, which involves the notion of celestial bodies returning to their original positions after a period of time.

The return (apokatastasis) of the planets and stars to their proper celestial signs, namely their original positions, would spark a conflagration of the universe (ekpyrosis). The original position was believed to consist of an alignment of celestial bodies with Cancer. Thereafter, from fire, rebirth would commence, and this cycle of alternate destruction and recreation was correlated with a divine Logos. Antapocatastasis is a counter-recurrence when the stars and planets align with Capricorn, which would mark destruction by a universal flood.. The Stoics identified Zeus with an alternately expanding and contracting fire constituting the universe. Its expansion was described as Zeus turning his thoughts outwards, resulting in the creation of the material cosmos, and its contraction, the apocatastasis, as Zeus returning to self-contemplation.. Leibniz explored both Stoic and his understanding of Origen's philosophy in two essays written shortly before his death, Apokatastasis and Apokatastasis panton (1715). =Judaism= The concept of \\"restore\\" or \\"return\\" in the Hebrew Bible is the common Hebrew verb ,. as used in Malachi 4:6, the only use of the verb form of apocatastasis in the Septuagint. This is used in the \\"restoring\\" of the fortunes of Job, and is also used in the sense of rescue or return of captives, and in the restoration of Jerusalem. This is similar to the concept of tikkun olam in Hasidic Judaism.. =New Testament= The word, apokatastasis, appears only once in the New Testament, in Acts 3:21.Greek: ·ΩÉŒΩ Œ¥Œµ·øñ Œø·ΩêœÅŒ±ŒΩ·Ω∏ŒΩ Œº·Ω≤ŒΩ Œ¥Œ≠ŒæŒ±œÉŒ∏Œ±Œπ ·ºÑœáœÅŒπ œáœÅœåŒΩœâŒΩ ·ºÄœÄŒøŒ∫Œ±œÑŒ±œÉœÑŒ¨œÉŒµœâœÇ œÄŒ¨ŒΩœÑœâŒΩ ·ΩßŒΩ ·ºêŒªŒ¨ŒªŒ∑œÉŒµŒΩ ·ΩÅ Œ∏Œµ·Ω∏œÇ Œ¥Œπ·Ω∞ œÉœÑœåŒºŒ±œÑŒøœÇ œÑ·ø∂ŒΩ ·ºÅŒ≥ŒØœâŒΩ ·ºÄœÄ·æø Œ±·º∞·ø∂ŒΩŒøœÇ Œ±·ΩêœÑŒø·ø¶ œÄœÅŒøœÜŒ∑œÑ·ø∂ŒΩ. Vulgate: quem oportet caelum quidem suscipere usque in tempora restitutionis omnium quae locutus est Deus per os sanctorum suorum a saeculo prophetarum. Peter healed a beggar with a disability and then addressed the astonished onlookers. His sermon set Jesus in the Jewish context, the fulfiller of the Abrahamic Covenant, and says: Grammatically, the relative pronoun \\"·ΩßŒΩ\\" (\\"of which\\", genitive plural), could refer either to \\"œáœÅœåŒΩœâŒΩ\\" (\\"of times\\") or to \\"œÄŒ¨ŒΩœÑœâŒΩ\\" (\\"of all\\" or \\"of all things\\"), which means that it is either the times of which God spoke or the all things of which God spoke. The usual view taken of Peter's use of the \\"apokatastasis of all the things about which God spoke\\" is that it refers to the restoration of the Kingdom of Israel and/or the Garden of Eden and not \\"all things that ever existed\\".. The verbal form of apokatastasis is found in the Septuagint Malachi 3:23LXX (i.e. ), a prophecy of Elijah turning back the hearts of the children to their fathers; in (\\"he will restore all things\\"), echoing Malachi, and in (\\"that I may be restored to you the sooner\\"). Nineteenth-century German theologian Jakob Eckermann interpreted \\"the 'apocatastasis of all things' to mean the universal emendation of religion by the doctrine of Christ, and the 'times of refreshing' to be the day of renewal, the times of the Messiah.\\" =Patristic Christianity= The significance of apocatastasis in early Christianity is today being re-evaluated. In particular it is now questioned whether Origen, often listed as the most notable advocate of universal salvation, did in fact teach or believe in such a doctrine.... Frederick W. Norris, in his article , states that the positions that Origen takes on the issue of universal salvation have often seemed to be contradictory. He then writes that Origen never decided to stress exclusive salvation or universal salvation, to the strict exclusion of either case, therefore concludes that Origen probably kept his view of salvation economically 'open' for a greater effectiveness.... The Alexandrian school adapted Platonic terminology and ideas to Christianity while explaining and differentiating the new faith from all the others... A form of apocatastasis was also attributed to Gregory of Nyssa and possibly the Ambrosiaster, attributed to Ambrose of Milan. Gregory of Nazianzus discussed it without reaching a decision. Eventually, Origen started to be condemned throughout the early church in local councils, though not apocatastasis specifically. This changed definitively in the sixth century. A local Synod of Constantinople (543) condemned a form of apocatastasis as being Anathema, and the Anathema was formally submitted to the Fifth Ecumenical Council of Constantinople (553). The term apocatastasis is mentioned in the 14th of the 15 anathemas against Origen of 553: \\"If anyone shall say ... that in this pretended apocatastasis, spirits only will continue to exist, as it was in the feigned pre-existence: let him be anathema.\\" The fifth ecumenical council in its sentence during the eighth session condemned \\"Origen\\" and his \\"impious writings\\"‚Äîlikely a reference to the teachings ascribed to him by the 543 and 553 anathemas, because during the fifth session Origen's condemnation is described as \\"recent.\\" Konstantinovsky (2009). states that the uses of apocatastasis in Christian writings prior to the Synod of Constantinople (543) and the anathemas (553) pronounced against \\"Origenists\\" and Evagrius Ponticus were neutral and referred primarily to concepts similar to the general \\"restoration of all things spoken\\" (restitutio omnium quae locutus est Deus) of Peter in Acts 3:21 and not for example the universal reconciliation of all souls which had ever been. The \\"official\\" nature of the anathemas was reiterated subsequently. The Second Council of Nicea explicitly affirmed in its sentence that the Second Council of Constantinople condemned Origen, as well as taught the existence of eternal damnation and explicitly rejected \\"the restoration of all things,\\" which in Latin is a reference to apocatastasis. =Gnosticism= The gnostic Gospel of Philip 180‚Äì350c contains the term itself but does not teach universal reconciliation: In Christian theology =Early Christianity= Clement of Alexandria (c. 150 ‚Äì c. 215) generally uses the term apokatastasis to refer to the \\"restoration\\" of the \\"gnostic\\" Christians, rather than that of the universe or of all Christians, but with universal implications. As indicated above, the position of Origen (186‚Äì284) is disputed, with works as recent as the New Westminster Dictionary of Church History presenting him as teaching that the apocatastasis would involve universal salvation. In early Christian theological usage, apocatastasis meant the ultimate restoration of all things to their original state, which early exponents believed would still entail a purgatorial state, Both Origen and Gregory of Nyssa confidently taught that all creatures would be saved. The word was still very flexible at that time, but in the mid-6th century, it became virtually a technical term, as it usually means today, to refer to a specifically Origenistic doctrine of universal salvation.. Maximus the Confessor outlined God's plan for \\"universal\\" salvation alongside warnings of everlasting punishment for the wicked. =Luther= The Vulgate translation of apokatastasis, \\"in tempora restitutionis omnium quae locutus est Deus\\" (the restitution of all things of which God has spoken) was taken up by Luther to mean the day of the restitution of the creation, but in Luther's theology the day of restitution was also the day of resurrection and judgment, not the restitution of the wicked. In Luther's Bible he rendered the Greek apokatastasis with the German herwiedergebracht werde; \\"will be brought back.\\" modernized as: \\"welcher muss den Himmel einnehmen bis auf die Zeit, da herwiedergebracht werde alles, was Gott geredet hat durch den Mund aller seiner heiligen Propheten von der Welt an\\". This sense continued to be used in Lutheran sermons. Luther explicitly disowned belief that the devils would ultimately reach blessedness.. =19th-century Universalism= During the 19th and early 20th centuries several histories published by Universalists, including Hosea Ballou (1829), Thomas Whittemore (1830), John Wesley Hanson (1899) and George T. Knight (1911), argued that belief in universal reconciliation was found in early Christianity and in the Reformation, and ascribed Universalist beliefs to Origen, Clement of Alexandria, and others. =Recent works= In recent writing, apocatastasis is generally understood as involving some form of universal reconciliation, without necessarily attributing this understanding to Origen and other Fathers of the Church. * , described apocatastasis as universal reconciliation. * , translated in the Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge, described apocatastasis as universal reconciliation. * , defined apocatastasis as \\"a name given in the history of theology to the doctrine which teaches that a time will come when all free creatures shall share in the grace of salvation; in a special way, the devils and lost souls.\\". * . Professor Constantinos A. Patrides surveyed the history of apocatastasis in his . reprinted in * , devoted a whole chapter, under the heading \\"Apocatastasis?\\", to the topic of universal reconciliation, \\"sometimes technically known as apocatastasis\\".. * . * von Balthasar, Hans Urs (1988) Dare We Hope That All Men Be Saved?

Peter Stravinskas, in the short article on apocatastasis in . and the still shorter entry in his Catholic Dictionary (1993),. defines it as the belief \\"that all rational creatures are saved, including the fallen angels and unrepentant sinners\\". * Stravinskas identifies apocatastasis with universalism or universal reconciliation, and some of the older sources do so also. In addition, two recent works that do not discuss apocatastasis give the corresponding Greek word as the source from which \\"universalism\\" is derived.. But most writers do not simply identify apocatastasis with universal reconciliation. Gonz√°lez points out that a distinction exists, in that \\"it is possible to hold universalist views without believing that all of creation will return to its original state\\". * Both Ludlow and McGarry state that the word apokatastasis is today usually understood as referring to one specific doctrine of universal salvation, not to all versions of universalism.* describes apocatastasis as \\"a theory... that all angels and human beings, even the demons and the damned, will ultimately be saved\\".. * Morwenna Ludlow (2001), in , writes that, though the meaning was very flexible until the mid-6th century, \\"the word apokatastasis is now usually used to refer to a specifically Origenistic doctrine of universal salvation\\". * Peter L. Berger, in his book , calls apocatastasis \\"the conviction that, in the end, all will be saved and the entire creation will be reconciled with God\\".. * The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church (third edition 2005) explains the term as meaning the doctrine of the ultimate salvation of all.; cf. article \\"Universalism\\". * Justo L. Gonz√°lez, in Essential Theological Terms (2005), says that \\"theories of the apocatastasis usually involve the expectation that in the end all, including the devil, will be saved\\".. * , explains apocatastasis as \\"the idea that all things will be ultimately reconciled to God through Christ ‚Äì including the damned in hell and even Satan and his demons\\".. * Hart, David Bentley (2019), That All Shall Be Saved, Yale University Press. * Ramelli, Ilaria (2019) A Larger Hope?, Volume 1: Universal Salvation from Christian Beginnings to Julian of Norwich, and (2019) A Larger Hope?, Volume 2: Universal Salvation from the Reformation to the Nineteenth Century.

Here, hula is performed by Kumu Hula Frank Kawaikapuokalani Hewett for a ceremony turning over U.S. Navy control over the island of Kahoolawe to the state. Hula is a Polynesian dance form accompanied by chant (Oli) or song (Mele, which is a cognate of \\"meke\\" from the Fijian language). It was developed in the Hawaiian Islands by the Polynesians who originally settled there. The hula dramatizes or portrays the words of the oli or mele in a visual dance form. There are many sub-styles of hula, with the main two categories being Hula  ªAuana and Hula Kahiko. Ancient hula, as performed before Western encounters with Hawaii, is called kahiko. It is accompanied by chant and traditional instruments. Hula, as it evolved under Western influence in the 19th and 20th centuries, is called auana (a word that means \\"to wander\\" or \\"drift\\"). It is accompanied by song and Western-influenced musical instruments such as the guitar, the ukulele, and the double bass. Terminology for two main additional categories is beginning to enter the hula lexicon: \\"Monarchy\\" includes any hula which were composed and choreographed during the 19th century. During that time the influx of Western culture created significant changes in the formal Hawaiian arts, including hula. \\"Ai Kahiko\\", meaning \\"in the ancient style\\" are those hula written in the 20th and 21st centuries that follow the stylistic protocols of the ancient hula kahiko. There are also two main positions of a hula dance: either sitting (noho dance) or standing (luna dance). Some dances utilize both forms. In the 1890s and early 1900s, hula dancers and Hawaiian musicians toured the U.S. mainland. This advertisement appeared in an Ohio newspaper in 1921. Hula dancing is a complex art form, and there are many hand motions used to represent the words in a song or chant. For example, hand movements can signify aspects of nature, such as the swaying of a tree in the breeze or a wave in the ocean, or a feeling or emotion, such as fondness or yearning. Foot and hip movements often pull from a basic library of steps including the kaholo, ka ªo, kawelu, hela,  ªuwehe, and  ªami. There are other related dances (tamure, hura, 'aparima, 'ote'a, haka, kapa haka, poi, Fa'ataupati, Tau'olunga, and Lakalaka) that come from other Polynesian islands such as Tahiti, The Cook Islands, Samoa, Tonga and New Zealand; however, the hula is unique to the Hawaiian Islands.Leilani Holmes, Ancestry of Experience: A Journey into Hawaiian Ways of Knowing (Honolulu: University of Hawai'i Press, 2012), 6. Hula kahiko Hula kahiko performance at the pa hula in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park Hula kahiko, often defined as those hula composed prior to 1894 which do not include modern instrumentation (such as guitar,  ªukulele, etc.), encompasses an enormous variety of styles and moods, from the solemn and sacred to the frivolous. Many hula were created to praise the chiefs and performed in their honor, or for their entertainment. Types of hula kahiko include ƒÅlaapapa, haa, olapa, and many others. Today hula kahiko is simply stated as \\"Traditional\\" Hula. Many hula dances are considered to be a religious performance, as they are dedicated to, or honoring, a Hawaiian goddess or god. As was true of ceremonies at the heiau, the platform temple, even a minor error was considered to invalidate the performance. It might even be a presage of bad luck or have dire consequences. Dancers who were learning to do such hula necessarily made many mistakes. Hence they were ritually secluded and put under the protection of the goddess Laka during the learning period. Ceremonies marked the successful learning of the hula and the emergence from seclusion. Hula kahiko is performed today by dancing to the historical chants. Many hula kahiko are characterized by traditional costuming, by an austere look, and a reverence for their spiritual root. = Chant (Oli) = Hawaiian history was oral history. It was codified in genealogies and chants, which were memorized and passed down. In the absence of a written language, this was the only available method of ensuring accuracy. Chants told the stories of creation, mythology, royalty, and other significant events and people. The‚Äò≈ålelo No‚Äôeau (Hawaiian saying or proverb), ‚Äú‚ÄòO ‚Äòoe ka lua‚Äôahi o kƒÅu mele,‚Äù translates loosely as ‚ÄúYou bear both the good and the bad consequences of the poetry you compose‚Äù The idea behind this saying originates from the ancient Hawaiian belief that language possessed mana, or ‚Äúpower derived from a spiritual source‚Äù particularly when delivered through oli (chant). Therefore, skillful manipulation of language by haku mele (composers) and chanters was of utmost reverence and importance. Oli was an integral component of ancient Hawaiian society, and arose in nearly every social, political and economic aspect of life. Traditional chant types are extremely varied in context and technical components, and cover a broad range of specific functions. Among them (in vague descending order of sacredness) exist mele pule (prayer), hula kuahu (ritual dance), k≈´‚Äôauhau (cosmogeny), ko‚Äôihonua (genealogy), hƒÅnau (birth), inoa (name), ma‚Äôi (procreation/genital), kanikau (lamentation), hei (game), ho‚Äôoipoipo (love), and kƒÅhea (expression/call out). An important distinction between oli, hula, and mele is as follows: mele can hold many different meanings, and is often translated to mean simply, song. However, in a more broad sense, mele can be taken to mean poetry or linguistic composition. Hula (chant with dance) and oli (chant without dance) are two general styles in which mele can be used/performed. Generally, ‚Äúall mele may be performed as oli (chant without dance), but only certain types such as name chants, sex chants, love chants, and chants dedicated to the [‚Äòaumakua] gods of hula (ritual dance), may be performed as hula (chant with dance).‚Äù 'Olelo Hawai'i (Hawaiian language) contains 43 different words to describe voice quality; the technique and particularity of chanting styles is crucial to understanding their function. The combination of general style (with or without dance) and the context of the performance determines what vocal style a chant will use. Kepakepa, kƒÅwele, olioli, ho‚ÄôƒÅeae, ho‚Äôouƒìuƒì, and ‚Äòaiha‚Äôa are examples of styles differentiated by vocal technique. Kepakepa sounds like rapid speech and is often spoken in long phrases. Olioli is a style many would liken to song, as it is melodic in nature and includes sustained pitches , often with ‚Äòi‚Äôi, or vibrato of the voice thats hold vowel tones at the ends of lines. A law passed in Hawai‚Äôi in 1896 (shortly after American overthrow of the Hawaiian kingdom) banned the use of ‚Äò≈ålelo Hawai‚Äôi in schools. This, in combination with a general usurpation of Hawaiian social, political, and linguistic autonomy resulted in a mass decline of the Hawaiian language, to the near brink of extinction. As a result of Americanization, including the spread of Christianity, many traditional chants became viewed as pagan and were ultimately forgotten. But a cultural resurgence beginning in the late 1960s, and carrying through to today has revitalized many Hawaiian practices, including spoken language and chant, and has been furthered by increasing support from various institutions, including P≈´nana Leo Hawaiian language immersion schools, funded by the Hawai‚Äôi State Department of Education as well as major hula competitions such as the Merrie Monarch Festival, which officially began in 1971. In hƒÅlau hula (hula schools) asking permission to enter the space in order to partake in the knowledge of the kumu (teacher) is a key component to being a student. Many hƒÅlau use a variation of ‚ÄúK≈´nihi,‚Äù an oli kƒÅhea, most typically done in an olioli style. Students often stand outside the entrance and chant repeatedly until the kumu decides to grant them permission to enter, and uses a different chant in response. This is an example of how oli is integrated into modern day cultural practices, within the context of hula training. =Instruments and implements= Hula dance researcher Joann Kealiinohomoku with hula implements Puili and uliuli * Ipu‚Äîsingle gourd drum * Ipu heke‚Äîdouble gourd drum * Pahu‚Äîsharkskin covered drum; considered sacred * Puniu‚Äîsmall knee drum made of a coconut shell with fish skin (kala) cover * Iliili‚Äîwater-worn lava stone used as castanets * Ulƒ´ulƒ´‚Äîfeathered gourd rattles (also ulili) * P≈´ili‚Äîsplit bamboo sticks * KƒÅlaau‚Äîrhythm sticks The dog's-tooth anklets sometimes worn by male dancers could also be considered instruments, as they underlined the sounds of stamping feet. = Costumes = Dancer with  ªuli ªuli, hula kahiko competition, Merrie Monarch Festival 2003 Traditional female dancers wore the everyday pƒÅ≈´, or wrapped skirt, but were topless. Today this form of dress has been altered. As a sign of lavish display, the pƒÅ≈´ might be much longer than the usual length of tapa, or barkcloth, which was just long enough to go around the waist. Visitors report seeing dancers swathed in many yards of tapa, enough to increase their circumference substantially. Dancers might also wear decorations such as necklaces, bracelets, and anklets, as well as many lei (in the form of headpieces (lei po ªo), necklaces, bracelets, and anklets (kupe ªe)), and other accessories. Hula dancers in a Luau in Lahaina, in traditional kƒ´ leaf skirts A skirt of green kƒ´ (Cordyline fruticosa) leaves may also be worn over the pƒÅ≈´. They are arranged in a dense layer of around fifty leaves. Kƒ´ were sacred to the goddess of the forest and the hula dance Laka, and as such, only kahuna and ali ªi were allowed to wear kƒ´ leaf leis (lei lƒÅ ªƒ´) during religious rituals. Similar C. fruticosa leaf skirts worn over tupenu are also used in religious dances in Tonga, where it is known as sisi. However, Tongan leaf skirts generally use red and yellow leaves. Traditional female dancers (and occasionally male) are also seen wearing bra made from coconut. Traditional male dancers wore the everyday malo, or loincloth. Again, they might wear bulky malo made of many yards of tapa. They also wore necklaces, bracelets, anklets, and lei. The materials for the lei worn in performance were gathered in the forest, after prayers to Laka and the forest gods had been chanted. The lei and tapa worn for sacred hula were considered imbued with the sacredness of the dance, and were not to be worn after the performance. Lei were typically left on the small altar to Laka found in every hƒÅlau, as offerings. = Performances = Hula performed for spontaneous daily amusement or family feasts were attended with no particular ceremony. However, hula performed as entertainment for chiefs were anxious affairs. High chiefs typically traveled from one place to another within their domains. Each locality had to house, feed, and amuse the chief and his or her entourage. Hula performances were a form of fealty, and often of flattery to the chief. During the performances the males would start off and the females would come later to close the show off. Most kahiko performances would begin with an opening dance, kai, and end with a closing dance, hoi, to state the presence of the hula. There were hula celebrating his lineage, his name, and even his genitals (hula mai). Sacred hula, celebrating Hawaiian gods, were also danced. All these performances must be completed without error (which would be both unlucky and disrespectful). Visiting chiefs from other domains would also be honored with hula performances. This courtesy was often extended to important Western visitors.  Hula auana  Dancer (Hula auana), Merrie Monarch Festival Modern hula arose from adaptation of traditional hula ideas (dance and mele) to Western influences. The primary influences were Christian morality and melodic harmony. Hula auana still tells or comments on a story, but the stories may include events since the 1800s. The costumes of the women dancers are less revealing and the music is heavily Western-influenced. = Songs = The mele of hula auana are generally sung as if they were popular music. A lead voice sings in a major scale, with occasional harmony parts. The subject of the songs is as broad as the range of human experience. People write mele hula auana to comment on significant people, places or events or simply to express an emotion or idea. = Instruments = The musicians performing hula auana will typically use portable acoustic stringed instruments. ;used as part of the rhythm section, or as a lead instrument * Steel guitar‚Äîaccents the vocalist * Bass‚Äîmaintains the rhythm Occasional hula auana call for the dancers to use implements, in which case they will use the same instruments as for hula kahiko. Often dancers use the Ulƒ´ulƒ´ (feathered gourd rattle). = Regalia = Keali ªi Reichel Hula HƒÅlau The traditional Hawaiian hula costume includes kapa cloth skirts and men in just the malo (loincloth) however, during 1880s hula ‚Äòauana was developed from western influences. It is during this period that the grass skirt began to be seen everywhere although, Hula ‚Äòauana costumes are usually more western-looking, with dresses for women and pants for men. Regalia plays a role in illustrating the hula instructor's interpretation of the mele. From the color of their attire to the type of adornment worn, each piece of an auana costume symbolizes a piece of the mele auana, such as the color of a significant place or flower. While there is some freedom of choice, most hƒÅlau follow the accepted costuming traditions. Women generally wear skirts or dresses of some sort. Men may wear long or short pants, skirts, or a malo (a cloth wrapped under and around the groin). For slow, graceful dances, the dancers will wear formal clothing such as a muumuu for women and a sash for men. A fast, lively, \\"rascal\\" song will be performed by dancers in more revealing or festive attire. The hula kahiko is always performed with bare feet, but the hula auana can be performed with bare feet or shoes. In the old times, they had their leis and other jewelry but their clothing was much different. Females wore a wrap called a \\"pa ªu\\" made of tapa cloth and men wore loincloths, which are called \\"malo.\\" Both sexes are said to have gone without a shirt. Their ankle and wrist bracelets, called \\"kupe ªe\\", were made of whalebone and dogteeth as well as other items made from nature. Some of these make music-shells and bones will rattle against each other while the dancers dance. Women perform most Hawaiian hula dances. Female hula dancers usually wear colorful tops and skirts with lei. However, traditionally, men were just as likely to perform the hula. A grass skirt is a skirt that hangs from the waist and covers all or part of the legs. Grass skirts were made of many different natural fibers, such as hibiscus or palm. Training Kumu Hula Hinaleimoana Wong-Kalu, Honolulu, 2013 Hula is taught in schools or groups called hƒÅlau. The teacher of hula is the kumu hula. Kumu means \\"source of knowledge\\", or literally \\"teacher\\". Often there is a hierarchy in hula schools - starting with the kumu (teacher), alaka'i (leader), kokua (helpers), and then the 'olapa (dancers) or haumana (students). This is not true for every hƒÅlau, but it does occur often. Most, if not all, hula halau(s) have a permission chant in order to enter wherever they may practice. They will collectively chant their entrance chant, then wait for the kumu to respond with the entrance chant, once he or she is finished, the students may enter. One well known and often used entrance or permission chant is Kunihi Ka Mauna/Tunihi Ta Mauna.  History  = Legendary origins = Female dancers of the Sandwich Islands depicted by Louis Choris, the artist aboard the Russian ship Rurick, which visited Hawai'i in 1816 There are various legends surrounding the origins of hula. According to one Hawaiian legend, Laka, goddess of the hula, gave birth to the dance on the island of Molokai, at a sacred place in Kaana. After Laka died, her remains were hidden beneath the hill Puu Nana. Another story tells of Hiiaka, who danced to appease her fiery sister, the volcano goddess Pele. This story locates the source of the hula on Hawaii, in the Puna district at the HƒÅena shoreline. The ancient hula Ke Haa Ala Puna describes this event. Another story is when Pele, the goddess of fire was trying to find a home for herself running away from her sister Namakaokaha ªi (the goddess of the oceans) when she finally found an island where she couldn't be touched by the waves. There at chain of craters on the island of Hawai'i she danced the first dance of hula signifying that she finally won. Kumu Hula (or \\"hula master\\") Leato S. Savini of the Hawaiian cultural academy HƒÅlau NƒÅ Mamo O Tulipa, located in Waianae, Japan, and Virginia, believes that hula goes as far back as what the Hawaiians call the Kumulipo, or account of how the world was made first and foremost through the god of life and water, Kane. Kumu Leato is cited as saying, \\"When Kane and the other gods of our creation, Lono, K≈´, and Kanaloa created the earth, the man, and the woman, they recited incantations which we call Oli or Chants and they used their hands and moved their legs when reciting these oli. Therefore this is the origin of hula.\\" = 19th century = Hula dancers, c1885. American Protestant missionaries, who arrived in 1820, often denounced the hula as a heathen dance holding vestiges of paganism. The newly Christianized alii (royalty and nobility) were urged to ban the hula. In 1830 Queen Ka ªahumanu forbade public performances.Missionaries and the Decline of Hula, HawaiiHistory.org; also: Hong, Cesily, \\"The Power of the Hula: A Performance Text for Appropriating Identity Among First Hawaiian Youth\\" (2013). Doctoral Dissertations. Paper 56, p. 21: Queen Ka‚Äôahumanu, the favorite wife of Kamehameha I and an acting Regent during the reign of Kamehameha II and Kamehameha III became a practicing Christian, and banned the hula and accompanying mele from all public venues. However, many of them continued to privately patronize the hula. By the 1850s, public hula was regulated by a system of licensing. The Hawaiian performing arts had a resurgence during the reign of King David KalƒÅkaua (1874‚Äì1891), who encouraged the traditional arts. With the Princess Lili'uokalani who devoted herself to the old ways, as the patron of the ancients chants (mele, hula), she stressed the importance to revive the diminishing culture of their ancestors within the damaging influence of foreigners and modernism that was forever changing Hawaii. Practitioners merged Hawaiian poetry, chanted vocal performance, dance movements and costumes to create the new form, the hula kui (kui means \\"to combine old and new\\"). The pahu appears not to have been used in hula kui, evidently because its sacredness was respected by practitioners; the ipu gourd (Lagenaria sicenaria) was the indigenous instrument most closely associated with hula kui. Ritual and prayer surrounded all aspects of hula training and practice, even as late as the early 20th century. Teachers and students were dedicated to the goddess of the hula, Laka. = 20th century hula dancing = \\"Honolulu Entertainers\\" sideshow at a circus in Salt Lake City, 1920 Hula changed drastically in the early 20th century as it was featured in tourist spectacles, such as the Kodak Hula Show, and in Hollywood films. However, a more traditional hula was maintained in small circles by older practitioners. There has been a renewed interest in hula, both traditional and modern, since the 1970s and the Hawaiian Renaissance. In response to several Pacific island sports teams using their respective native war chants and dances as pre-game ritual challenges, the University of Hawaii football team started doing a war chant and dance using the native Hawaiian language that was called the ha'a before games in 2007. Since 1964, the Merrie Monarch Festival has become an annual one week long hula competition held in the spring that attracts visitors from all over the world. It is to honor King David KalƒÅkaua who was known as the Merrie Monarch as he revived the art of hula.Stacy Kamehiro, The Arts of Kingship: Hawaiian Art and National Culture of the Kalakaua Era (Honolulu: University of Hawai'i Press, 2009), 2.

Nelson was born in Sorel (near Montreal) to William Nelson, an immigrant to Colonial America from Newsham, North Yorkshire. His mother, Jane Dies, was a teacher and daughter of an important land owner in the New York area. He studied medicine in Montreal and later at Harvard University, in the state of Massachusetts. During the War of 1812, he was surgeon for the Deschambault Corps and the Indian Braves Corps. In 1827, Robert Nelson entered politics at the invitation of his brother, Wolfred Nelson, also a doctor and member of the Parti Patriote. On November 24, 1837, Nelson was arrested with other politicians. He was freed soon after, not being involved with the rebels, unlike his brother, Wolfred, who participated in the Battle of Saint- Denis. His arrest, however, led him to join with the rebels who fled to the United States. The leaders of the Patriotes voted for the quick establishment of a provisional government and the launch of an attack from the United States. Some important Patriotes voted against this idea, including Louis- Joseph Papineau. Robert Nelson was made General of the army and elected future President of the Republic of Lower Canada. On February 28, 1838, Nelson encamped at Alburg, Vermont with some 300 men. He proclaimed the independence of the Republic of Lower Canada and distributed copies of a declaration of independence. Soon after, they were arrested by the U.S. Army for violation of the law of neutrality of the United States. A jury, sympathetic to the Patriotes cause, acquitted him and others. After this failed attempt, Robert Nelson and other insurrectionists decided to take the time to organize a new strike. A clandestine paramilitary association, known as the Fr√®res chasseurs, was set up to overthrow the British colonial governments of Lower and Upper Canada and establish sovereign and democratic republics in their place. A second invasion started on November 3, 1838. Things didn't go as planned and the invasion forces were forced to retreat. Nelson and others were eventually granted amnesty by the British colonial government and allowed to return home. Robert Nelson died in 1873 at the age of 78 in Staten Island, New York. He was interred in the Notre-Dame-des-Neiges Cemetery in Montreal.

The algorithm was the first that can provably determine whether any given number is prime or composite within polynomial time, without relying on the generalized Riemann hypothesis, or any mathematical conjecture. The proof is also notable for not relying on the field of analysis. The authors received the 2006 G√∂del Prize and the 2006 Fulkerson Prize for this work. Importance AKS is the first primality- proving algorithm to be simultaneously general, polynomial, deterministic, and unconditional. Previous algorithms had been developed for centuries and achieved three of these properties at most, but not all four. * The AKS algorithm can be used to verify the primality of any general number given. Many fast primality tests are known that work only for numbers with certain properties. For example, the Lucas‚ÄìLehmer test works only for Mersenne numbers, while P√©pin's test can be applied to Fermat numbers only. * The maximum running time of the algorithm can be expressed as a polynomial over the number of digits in the target number. ECPP and APR conclusively prove or disprove that a given number is prime, but are not known to have polynomial time bounds for all inputs. * The algorithm is guaranteed to distinguish deterministically whether the target number is prime or composite. Randomized tests, such as Miller‚ÄìRabin and Baillie‚ÄìPSW, can test any given number for primality in polynomial time, but are known to produce only a probabilistic result. * The correctness of AKS is not conditional on any subsidiary unproven hypothesis. In contrast, Miller's version of the Miller‚ÄìRabin test is fully deterministic and runs in polynomial time over all inputs, but its correctness depends on the truth of the yet-unproven generalized Riemann hypothesis. While the algorithm is of immense theoretical importance, it is not used in practice, rendering it a galactic algorithm. For 64-bit inputs, the Baillie‚ÄìPSW primality test is deterministic and runs many orders of magnitude faster. For larger inputs, the performance of the (also unconditionally correct) ECPP and APR tests is far superior to AKS. Additionally, ECPP can output a primality certificate that allows independent and rapid verification of the results, which is not possible with the AKS algorithm. Concepts The AKS primality test is based upon the following theorem: Given an integer n\\\\ge 2 and integer a coprime to n, n is prime if and only if the polynomial congruence relation holds. Note that x should be understood as a formal symbol. This theorem is a generalization to polynomials of Fermat's little theorem. In one direction it can easily be proven using the binomial theorem together with the following property of the binomial coefficient: :{n \\\\choose k} \\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod{n} for all 0 if n is prime. While the relation () constitutes a primality test in itself, verifying it takes exponential time: the brute force approach would require the expansion of the (x + a)^n polynomial and a reduction \\\\pmod{n} of the resulting n + 1 coefficients. The congruence is an equality in the polynomial ring \\\\mathbb{Z}_n[x]. Evaluating in a quotient ring of \\\\mathbb{Z}_n[x] creates an upper bound for the degree of the polynomials involved. The AKS evaluates the equality in \\\\mathbb{Z}_n[x]/(x^r- 1), making the computational complexity dependent on the size of r. For clarity, this is expressed as the congruence which is the same as: for some polynomials f and g. Note that all primes satisfy this relation (choosing g=0 in () gives (), which holds for n prime). This congruence can be checked in polynomial time when r is polynomial to the digits of n. The AKS algorithm evaluates this congruence for a large set of a values, whose size is polynomial to the digits of n. The proof of validity of the AKS algorithm shows that one can find an r and a set of a values with the above properties such that if the congruences hold then n is a power of a prime. History and running time In the first version of the above-cited paper, the authors proved the asymptotic time complexity of the algorithm to be \\\\tilde{O}(\\\\log(n)^{12}) (using √ï from big O notation)‚Äîthe twelfth power of the number of digits in n times a factor that is polylogarithmic in the number of digits. However, this upper bound was rather loose; a widely-held conjecture about the distribution of the Sophie Germain primes would, if true, immediately cut the worst case down to \\\\tilde{O}(\\\\log(n)^6). In the months following the discovery, new variants appeared (Lenstra 2002, Pomerance 2002, Berrizbeitia 2002, Cheng 2003, Bernstein 2003a/b, Lenstra and Pomerance 2003), which improved the speed of computation greatly. Owing to the existence of the many variants, Crandall and Papadopoulos refer to the \\"AKS-class\\" of algorithms in their scientific paper \\"On the implementation of AKS-class primality tests\\", published in March 2003. In response to some of these variants, and to other feedback, the paper \\"PRIMES is in P\\" was updated with a new formulation of the AKS algorithm and of its proof of correctness. (This version was eventually published in Annals of Mathematics.) While the basic idea remained the same, r was chosen in a new manner, and the proof of correctness was more coherently organized. The new proof relied almost exclusively on the behavior of cyclotomic polynomials over finite fields. The new upper bound on time complexity was \\\\tilde{O}(\\\\log(n)^{10.5}), later reduced using additional results from sieve theory to \\\\tilde{O}(\\\\log(n)^{7.5}). In 2005, Pomerance and Lenstra demonstrated a variant of AKS that runs in \\\\tilde{O}(\\\\log(n)^{6})operations,H. W. Lenstra Jr. and Carl Pomerance, \\"Primality testing with Gaussian periods\\", preliminary version July 20, 2005. leading to another updated version of the paper.H. W. Lenstra jr. and Carl Pomerance, \\"Primality testing with Gaussian periods \\", version of April 12, 2011. Agrawal, Kayal and Saxena proposed a variant which would run in \\\\tilde{O}(\\\\log(n)^{3}) if Agrawal's conjecture were true; however, a heuristic argument by Pomerance and Lenstra suggested that it is probably false. The algorithm The algorithm is as follows: : Input: integer . # Check if n is a perfect power: if for integers and , output composite. # Find the smallest r such that . (if r and n are not coprime, then skip this r) # For all 2 ‚â§ a ‚â§ min (r, n‚àí1), check that a does not divide n: If an for some 2 ‚â§ a ‚â§ min (r, n‚àí1), output composite. # If n ‚â§ r, output prime. # For to \\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\sqrt{\\\\varphi(r)}\\\\log_2(n) \\\\right\\\\rfloor do #: if (X+a)n‚â† Xn+a (mod Xr ‚àí 1,n), output composite; # Output prime. Here ordr(n) is the multiplicative order of n modulo r, log2 is the binary logarithm, and \\\\varphi(r) is Euler's totient function of r. Step 3 is shown in the paper as checking 1 < (a,n) < n for all a ‚â§ r. It can be seen this is equivalent to trial division up to r, which can be done very efficiently without using gcd. Similarly the comparison in step 4 can be replaced by having the trial division return prime once it has checked all values up to and including \\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\sqrt{n} \\\\right\\\\rfloor. Once beyond very small inputs, step 5 dominates the time taken. The essential reduction in complexity (from exponential to polynomial) is achieved by performing all calculations in the finite ring : R := \\\\Bigl(\\\\bigl(\\\\Z/(n)\\\\bigr) [X]\\\\Bigr) \\\\Bigl/ (X^r\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!-\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!1) \\\\Bigr. consisting of n \\\\cdot r elements. This ring contains only the r monomials \\\\\\\\{X^0,X^1,\\\\ldots,X^{r-1}\\\\\\\\} , and the coefficients are in \\\\Z/(n) =: \\\\Z_n which has n elements all of them codable within \\\\log_2(n) bits. Most later improvements made to the algorithm have concentrated on reducing the size of r which makes the core operation in step 5 faster, and in reducing the size of s, the number of loops performed in step 5.Daniel J. Bernstein, \\"Proving Primality After Agrawal-Kayal-Saxena\\", version of January 25, 2003. Typically these changes do not change the computational complexity, but can lead to many orders of magnitude less time taken, e.g. Bernstein's final version has a theoretical speedup by a factor of over 2 million. =Proof of validity outline= For the algorithm to be correct, all steps that identify n must be correct. Steps 1, 3 and 4 are trivially correct, since they are based on direct tests of the divisibility of n. Step 5 is also correct: since (2) is true for any choice of a coprime to n and r if n is prime, an inequality means that n must be composite. The difficult case of the algorithm is the iterated statement in step 5. If this within the finite Ring R happens to result in the incongruence : u ot\\\\equiv v \\\\;\\\\bigl(\\\\text{mod } (x^r\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!-\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!1), n \\\\bigr) this is equivalent to : u \\\\equiv v \\\\;\\\\bigl(\\\\text{mod } (x^r\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!-\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!1) \\\\bigr) \\\\quad \\\\implies \\\\quad u ot\\\\equiv v \\\\;(\\\\text{mod } n), so that after reducing to the r monomials by means of \\\\text{mod } (x^r\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!-\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!1) only u ot\\\\equiv v \\\\;(\\\\text{mod } n) has to be checked for. =Example 1: n = 31 is prime= :Input: integer n = 31 > 1\\\\. Where PolynomialMod is a term-wise modulo reduction of the polynomial. e.g. PolynomialMod[x+2x2+3x3, 3] = x+2x2+0x3 See AKS Talk page for a discussion on why 'Example 2: n is not Prime past Step 4' is missing.

Biography  Nelson was born in Montreal. His father, William Nelson, was an immigrant to Colonial America from Newsham, North Yorkshire, England. His mother, Jane Dies, was a teacher and daughter of an important land owner in the New York area. Along with his younger brother Robert Nelson, he was known as a member of the Patriotes and for his leading role in the Lower Canada Rebellion. Nelson studied at the school of his father in William Henry. He became a physician in January 1811 and subsequently served in that capacity with the British troops on the War of 1812. He moved to Saint-Denis-sur-Richelieu where he opened a distillery. He entered politics when elected in William Henry in 1827. He supported the Parti Patriote. In 1827, he was elected as a member of the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada, but he gave up active politics in 1830, without disavowing his reformist allegiance. He became a Patriote leader in the region of the Richelieu River valley, and supported the use of arms at the Assembl√©e des Six-Comt√©s in 1837. In a prelude to the Lower Canada Rebellion of 1837, Nelson led 5,000 Patriotes in the two-day Assembly of the Six Counties in Saint-Charles, Lower Canada (present-day Quebec), on 23 and 24 October 1837, to protest the government's Russell Resolutions, taking place despite the 15 June Proclamation forbidding public assemblies. The conference delegates approved the Thirteen Resolutions, based on the republican document Rights of Man written by British and later American Revolutionary Thomas Paine, which was also adopted by proponents of both the American Revolution and the French Revolution. A Column of Liberty was also erected in Saint-Charles' Square. On 16 November 1837, he and 25 others were charged with high treason. The following month, on 4 December 1837, Louis-Joseph Papineau and Edmund Bailey O'Callaghan joined Nelson at Saint-Denis where they decided to resist arrest, procure arms and ammunition for the people and declare the independence of Lower Canada. It was around this time that Nelson exclaimed, \\"The time has come, to melt our spoons into bullets.\\" On 28 February 1838, after having crossed the border from Vermont, Nelson, along with 300 to 400 Patriotes from a secret group called Fr√®res Chasseurs, distributed copies of a declaration of independence written by Nelson's brother, Robert Nelson. Drawn from the American Declaration of Independence, the document listed the crimes that Great Britain had committed against Lower Canada, as well as the right to overthrow the government. Nelson's gravesone in Sorel-Tracy Later, he led a group of armed citizens who resisted arrest by the British army at St-Denis. He was arrested soon after. (See Lower Canada Rebellion.) Exiled to Bermuda in 1838, Nelson was granted amnesty by the British colonial government and came back to Montreal in 1842. In 1844, he was elected to the new Parliament of the Province of Canada. In 1854, he became mayor of Montreal, and he died in June 1863. He is interred in the Anglican cemetery in Sorel-Tracy and is commemorated by a park in Mercier- Hochelaga-Maisonneuve borough.

Lloyd grew up near Liverpool. After being an active Liberal as a young man in the 1920s, the following decade he practised as a barrister and served on Hoylake Urban District Council, by which time he had become a Conservative Party sympathiser. During the Second World War he rose to be Deputy Chief of Staff of Second Army, playing an important role in planning sea transport to the Normandy beachhead and reaching the acting rank of brigadier. Elected to Parliament in 1945, he held ministerial office from 1951, eventually rising to be Foreign Secretary under Prime Minister Anthony Eden from April 1955. His tenure coincided with the Suez Crisis, for which he at first attempted to negotiate a peaceful settlement, before reluctantly assisting with Eden's wish to negotiate collusion with France and Israel as a prelude to military action. He continued as Foreign Secretary under the premiership of Harold Macmillan until July 1960, when he was moved to the job of Chancellor of the Exchequer. In this job he set up the NEDC, but became an increasingly unpopular figure because of the contractionary measures which he felt compelled to take, including the \\"Pay Pause\\" of July 1961, culminating in the sensational Liberal victory at the Orpington by-election in March 1962. In July 1962 Macmillan sacked him from the Cabinet, making him the highest-profile casualty in the reshuffle known as the \\"Night of the Long Knives\\". He returned to office under Prime Minister Alec Douglas-Home as Leader of the House of Commons (1963‚Äì4), and was elected Speaker of the House of Commons from 1971 until his retirement in 1976. Family background Lloyd was born on 28 July 1904 at Red Bank in West Kirby, Cheshire.Matthew 2004, p157 His father John Wesley Lloyd (1865-1954) was a dental surgeon of Welsh descent and a Methodist lay preacher; his mother Mary Rachel Warhurst (1872-1959) was distantly related to Field Marshal Sir John French. He had three sisters. He was educated at the Leas School. He was particularly interested in military history as a boy, a fact to which he later attributed his successful military career.Thorpe 1989, p65 He won a scholarship to Fettes College in 1918.Matthew 2004, p158 At Fettes, he became embroiled in a homosexual scandal as a junior boy. He was nicknamed \\"Jezebel\\" after his initials (JSBL), but was deemed to be the innocent party, and escaped punishment whilst three older boys were expelled.Bloch 2015, p.202-4Thorpe 1989, p17 Cambridge In October 1923 he went up, as a scholar, to Magdalene College, Cambridge, where A.

Asquith at Magdalene after a Liberal Party meeting at the Cambridge Guildhall.Thorpe 1989, p28 He became President of the Cambridge University Liberal Club.Website of the Keynes Society for Cambridge Student Liberal Democrats, accessed 12 June 2012 Lloyd was also an active debater in the Cambridge Union Society, where his sparring-partners included Rab Butler, Patrick Devlin, Hugh Foot, Alan King-Hamilton and Geoffrey Lloyd.Thorpe 1989, p27 Lloyd lost his scholarship in June 1925, after obtaining a Second in Classics. He then switched to study History, in which he also obtained a Second.Thorpe 1989, p26 the book does not specify exactly when he switched from History to Law or whether his history result was in June 1926 or June 1927 (the date when he should have graduated, had it not been for the General Strike) During the General Strike of May 1926 Lloyd, who earlier that year had begun eating dinners at Gray's Inn with a view to qualifying as a barrister, volunteered as a Special Constable. He later became critical of the Conservative Government's clampdown on trade unions, e.g. the Trades Disputes Act of 1927.Thorpe 1989, p35 The university authorities encouraged students who had worked for the government so close to their exams to extend their studies for an extra year, which meant that Lloyd was able to spend a very rare fifth year as an undergraduate. Lloyd George had become Liberal leader and was injecting money and ideas into the Liberal Party, and was keen to attract promising young candidates. Selwyn Lloyd was a frequent speaker for the Liberal Party from 1926 onwards.Thorpe 1989, p38-40 In 1926 he toyed, not entirely seriously, with the idea of joining the Labour Party.Thorpe 1989, p56-7 In Michaelmas Term 1926 Lloyd and Devlin (then President of the Cambridge Union) persuaded Walter Citrine to join Lloyd in opposing the motion that \\"The power of trade unions has increased, is increasing and ought to be diminished\\" (an echo of Dunning's famous motion on the power of the Crown in 1780). They had invited the miners' leader A.J. Cook, to the consternation of the town authorities, but in the event he was unable to attend. Lloyd won the debate by 378 votes to 237 and was elected Secretary for Lent Term 1927, putting him on track to be Vice-President for Easter (summer) Term 1927, then President in Michaelmas 1927.Thorpe 1989, p36-7 He took office as President in June 1927. At his retiring debate in November 1927 Samuel Hoare and Rab Butler (then being selected as Tory candidate for Saffron Walden) spoke.Thorpe 1989, p36 Lloyd finally graduated with a third-class in Part II of the Law Tripos in June 1928.Matthew 2004, p158 Early career =Bar and Local Government= Lloyd was a Liberal Parliamentary candidate at Macclesfield in the 1929 general election, coming third. After this he concentrated on his legal career. He was called to the bar in 1930. As a barrister, he was an opponent of capital punishment and was not always deferential to the bench: when a judge suggested holding a special sitting on the morning of Good Friday he withdrew his suggestion after Lloyd pointed out that the last judge to do so had been Pontius Pilate. Like many young politicians Lloyd was sympathetic to Oswald Mosley's New Party in 1930-1, and was disappointed that it made so little headway. He declined to stand again for Macclesfield as a Liberal in 1931 over tariffs, and thought the rump National Liberal Party not worth joining. Lloyd voted Conservative for the first time in 1931,Thorpe 1989, p89 although that year he declined an invitation to join the Conservative Party candidates' list.Thorpe 1989, p59 He joined Hoylake Urban District Council on 19 April 1932, for Grange Ward. For three years he was chairman of the Estates Finance Committee, managing a budget in excess of ¬£250,000 (over ¬£15m at 2016 prices).Compute the Relative Value of a U.K. Pound He became the youngest- ever chairman of the council at the age of 32. As chairman of the council, he was in charge of the local Coronation festivities in 1937, an event which he used to strengthen his links with the Territorial Army.Thorpe 1989, p61 He continued to serve on the council until 1940. In the early 1960s he would often be mocked as \\"Mr Hoylake UDC\\", implying him to be a small-town lawyer and local councillor who had been promoted onto the national stage above his abilities. Lloyd considered himself a Conservative from the mid-1930s, but did not formally join the Conservative Party until he was selected as a Parliamentary candidate in 1945; he later wrote that he would have taken a more active role in Conservative politics had it not been for the war. =Army service= Early Second World War service Lloyd became a reserve officer in 1937.Thorpe 1989, p76 In January 1939 he helped to raise a second line unit of the Royal Horse Artillery in the North-West. He was commissioned as a regular second lieutenant on 27 June 1939, and by August, with war seeming ever more likely, he was an acting captain and acting brigade major to Brigadier Cherry, CRA (Commander, Royal Artillery) of the 55th (West Lancashire) Infantry Division, a first-line Territorial Army formation.Thorpe 1989, p67 His obituary in The Times later stated wrongly that he had begun the war as a private. On the outbreak of war Lloyd's patron Brigadier Cherry sponsored him for the Staff College, Camberley.Thorpe 1989, p71 Many of those sent to the Staff College in 1939 were barristers, businessmen, school and university teachers thought likely to have an aptitude for staff work;Thorpe 1989, p69 Brian Horrocks was one of his instructors. Out of 110 officers in his intake, he was one of 22 passed as fit for immediate staff duty. He was appointed BMRA (Brigade major, Royal Artillery) to Brigadier Cherry, despite \\"not knowing anything about guns etc\\". By the spring of 1940 the 55th Division was on duty defending the Suffolk Coast against possible invasion.Thorpe 1989, p72 In February 1941, by now an acting major, he was a General Staff Officer Grade 2 (GSO2) at the headquarters of Major General Charles Allfrey's 43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division, another first-line TA formation. The division was part of XII Corps, commanded by Lieutenant General Andrew Thorne, but he was replaced in April 1941 by Lieutenant General Bernard Montgomery, who soon noted Lloyd as a promising officer. In later life Lloyd would sometimes write nostalgically to former colleagues about the gruelling regime of physical fitness (\\"100% Binge\\" and \\"Binge, More Binge & Great Binge\\") which Montgomery expected of all those under his command, irrespective of rank. Montgomery was promoted to command South-Eastern Command at Reigate (he soon renamed it \\"South Eastern Army\\") and on 18 December 1941 Lloyd was posted to join him.Thorpe 1989, p73-5 By 1942, Lloyd was a lieutenant colonel (GSO1) on the staff. He wanted to see fighting, and was disappointed not to be posted to Egypt with Montgomery when the latter took command of the Eighth Army in August 1942. Montgomery told him that temporary officers lacked the aptitude of regulars for fighting, but were often better at staff work. On 6 November, Lloyd was promoted to temporary lieutenant-colonel (war-substantive major). Second Army In the spring of 1943 Lloyd was posted to the staff of the Second Army, whose General Officer Commanding (GOC) was Lieutenant General Sir Kenneth Anderson, which was then being formed for participation in Operation Overlord. He was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in June 1943. Between June and August 1943 Lloyd was sent on a fact-finding trip to Algiers, Malta and Sicily, to examine German beach defences and to learn lessons from the recent Operation Torch and Operation Husky landings, and on his return had to make presentations to senior officers.Thorpe 1989, p79 On 14 December 1943, he was promoted to acting colonel, and by February 1944 was Deputy Chief of Staff of the Second Army, now commanded by Lieutenant General Sir Miles Dempsey. He later recalled that the work preparing for the Normandy landings was more intense than at any other time in his life.Thorpe 1989, p81 By March 1944 Montgomery, who, after commanding the Eighth Army in North Africa, Sicily and Italy, had returned to England in late December 1943 to take command of the 21st Army Group, knew him well enough to call him \\"Selwyn\\". Lloyd grew particularly close to Dempsey, with whom he crossed over to Normandy on D-Day and who remained a personal friend for the rest for their lives.Thorpe 1989, p94 He respected Dempsey very deeply. Lloyd's particular responsibility was preparation of the \\"loading tables\\", allocating priceless shipping space to men, weapons, equipment and other supplies.Thorpe 1989, p78 As a result of Lloyd's work, the deployment to the bridgehead went almost entirely according to plan, with only minor discrepancies between the Estimated and Actual Rates of Build Up between D+4 and D+10. The only unforeseen problem was an outbreak of malaria caused by an infestation of mosquitoes around a flooded ditch in I Corps sector, for which Lloyd had to arrange the transfer of malaria vaccines from Burma. Lloyd's first sight of a dead body had been a shot-down German pilot during the Battle of Britain, but he saw the carnage of dead men and animals in the Falaise Pocket at the end of the Battle of Normandy in August 1944.Thorpe 1989, p87 In October 1944, although not yet a member of the Conservative Party, he accepted an invitation to apply for the Conservative candidacy for the Wirral, where the sitting MP was retiring. He was selected in preference to a VC bearing rival, who refused to pledge to live in the constituency; when asked Lloyd replied that he had \\"never lived anywhere else\\".Clarke 1992, p220 In January 1945, he was unanimously adopted as the Conservative candidate whilst home on leave. Lloyd was promoted to Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in February 1945 and was promoted to acting brigadier on 8 March 1945. He was twice mentioned in despatches, the second of these being amongst a list of soldiers honoured for the 1944-5 campaign. Lloyd was with the Allied forces which liberated Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. He seldom spoke about Belsen, but later recalled seeing inmates living like animals, defecating in public view, and that there was no smell from the 10,000 corpses lying unburied (another 17,000 died after liberation) as they were emaciated, with no flesh to putrefy.Thorpe 1989, p91 Lloyd was also sent by Dempsey to identify Heinrich Himmler's body after his suicide. He recalled a corporal lifting Himmler's head with his boot, and then the dull thud of the head falling back as the corporal took his foot away.Thorpe 1989, p93 Lloyd ended his active army service with the honorary rank of colonel. Apart from his CBE, he was also decorated with the U.S. Legion of Merit in the degree of Commander. Post- war On 18 July 1947, Lloyd was appointed the honorary Colonel of 349 37th (Tyne Electrical Engineers) Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery. He was awarded the Territorial Decoration (TD) in August 1951. He retired from the Territorial Army Reserve on 2 March 1955 with the honorary rank of colonel. =Early Parliamentary career= Lloyd was elected to the House of Commons to represent Wirral in the 1945 general election by a majority of 16,625. His maiden speech on 12 February 1946 was not on an anodyne constituency matter as is usual for new MPs, but instead on the Trades Disputes and Trades Unions Bill, reflecting his interest in the subject going back to his student days.Matthew 2004, p159 He said that the public would still oppose another General Strike, and quoted from Shakespeare's \\"Measure for Measure\\": \\"O, it is excellent to have a giant's strength! But it is tyrannous to use it like a giant\\". The Chamber was almost empty, but he received a letter of congratulations from Harold Macmillan (wrongly addressed to Toby Low, another newly-elected MP who was also a brigadier).Thorpe 1989, p104-5 Lloyd's entry to Parliament gave him a headstart over other rising Conservative politicians who did not enter Parliament until 1950. He became a member of the \\"Young Turks\\" faction of the Conservative Party. He was able to stand out amongst the small contingent of Conservative MPs in the 1945-50 Parliament, and worked closely with both Anthony Eden and Rab Butler. Lloyd continued his legal career, taking silk in 1947. He was the Recorder of Wigan between 1948 and 1951. In 1946-7 his annual earnings including his salary as an MP were ¬£4,485, of which the bar made up ¬£3,231 (around ¬£150,000 and ¬£110,000 at 2016 prices). In 1947-8 his earnings dropped to ¬£3,140, of which ¬£1,888 was at the bar (around ¬£100,000 and ¬£60,000 at 2016 prices). Thereafter his earnings continued to decline, as he was busy in Parliament and with his recordership, and he did not have time to carve out a new niche for himself as a King's Counsel either on the North-West Circuit or in London.Thorpe 1989, p106 Lloyd expressed his opposition to capital punishment during the passage of the Criminal Justice Act 1948, and built relationships with other abolitionist MPs including Sidney Silverman. Lloyd gave a dissenting voice on the Beveridge Broadcasting Committee, and was sometimes known as \\"The Father of Commercial Television\\" after his minority report of 1949 helped inspire the setting-up of ITV in 1955. Lloyd believed that competition would help to raise standards, although in later life he came to be disappointed at how much of television time was given over to entertainment. Ministerial offices =Minister of State for Foreign Affairs= When the Conservatives returned to power under Churchill in 1951, Lloyd served under Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden as Minister of State for Foreign Affairs from 1951 to 1954. Lloyd later claimed (his biographer D.R. Thorpe writes that the story had clearly grown in the telling) that on his appointment he protested: 'But, sir, there must be some mistake. I do not speak any foreign language. Except in war, I have never visited any foreign country. I do not like foreigners. I have never spoken in any foreign-affairs debate in the House. I have never listened to one.' 'Young man, these all seem to me to be positive advantages,' growled Churchill in return.Never Had It So Good: A History of Britain from Suez to the Beatles by Dominic Sandbrook Churchill initially thought Selwyn Lloyd \\"that most dangerous of men, the clever fool\\" after he signed an agreement at the UN after misunderstanding his brief, when the order was to be noncommittal. Churchill later revised his opinion upwards.Thorpe 1989, p178 In June 1952 Lloyd and Field Marshal Lord Alexander (Minister of Defence) visited Korea, first calling on Alexander's old subordinate General Mark Clark, now UN Supreme Commander in the Region, then the South Korean leader Syngman Rhee, then the Korean battlefield. They returned via Ottawa (where Alexander had recently been Governor-General) and Washington, where they visited President Truman.Thorpe 1989, p163-4 In Egypt, which had been a British client state since 1883, the pro-British King Farouk was overthrown in July 1952. Lloyd helped to negotiate the treaty (12 February 1953) which gave Sudan (in theory jointly administered by Britain and Egypt) self-government for three years as a stepping-stone to a decision on full independence.Thorpe 1989, p168 Lloyd visited Cairo in March 1953, where he met the new Egyptian leader General Neguib, and his right-hand man Colonel Nasser.Thorpe 1989, p170 In February 1954 Lloyd met Neguib again in Khartoum.Thorpe 1989, p177 His visit to the Sudan saw riots in Khartoum and worries that he might meet the same fate as General Gordon in 1885. He wrote of the Sudan: \\"It is futile to try and outstay one's welcome\\". Later in February 1954 Neguib was ousted by Nasser. The Suez Base Agreement, whereby Britain agreed to withdraw her troops from Egypt by 1956, was on 27 July 1954. Lloyd would have preferred a slower withdrawal.Thorpe 1989, p211 Lloyd attended over a hundred Cabinet meetings, many of them whilst covering for Eden during his serious illness in 1953. =Minister of Supply and Minister of Defence= Lloyd was promoted to Minister of Supply, responsible for supplying the Armed Forces, in October 1954. Lloyd entered the Cabinet as Minister of Defence on Eden's accession to the premiership in April 1955. Just after the 1955 election, along with Rab Butler, Lord Salisbury and Harold Macmillan, he was put on the committee to advise Eden about the upcoming summit, the first since the war.Williams 2010, p229 He was Minister of Defence, a very prestigious post in Conservative eyes, for less than a year and the dates of his tenure meant that he was not in office during the annual defence white paper and defence debate; however, he made important innovations in long-term expenditure planning. The Chiefs of Staff of the three services still had direct right of access to the Prime Minister. Lloyd began a gradual process of consolidation of control of the Armed Forces which would finally come to fruition a decade or so later, with the three service ministries consolidated into a single Ministry of Defence and the three service chiefs reporting to a powerful Chief of Defence Staff.Thorpe 1989, p185 =Foreign Secretary under Eden= Appointment and early months Lloyd was promoted to Foreign Secretary in December 1955, in place of Harold Macmillan who was seen as too strong and independent a figure for Eden's tastes.Matthew 2004, p159-60 In his early days at the Foreign Office Lloyd was known to irritate his subordinates with bad puns, such as \\"Good for Nutting\\" and \\"You're a deb, Sir Gladwyn Jebb\\".Thorpe 1989, p196 The Foreign Office mandarin Sir Evelyn Shuckburgh complained in his diary (9 December 1955) that they were to \\"be landed with that bloody Selwyn Lloyd\\".Williams 2010, p235 Eden and Lloyd visited Washington for talks with his American counterpart, Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, on 30 January 1956, and wondered how long Britain could continue to cooperate with Colonel Nasser. Dulles was only willing to offer Britain \\"moral\\" support against Nasser.Thorpe 1989, p212 On 31 January Lloyd and Dulles had a private meeting about SEATO. Dulles took the lead in private, but would not lead or support Britain in public, although the two men got on well when Dulles realised that Lloyd could not be browbeaten.Thorpe 1989, p213 On 21 March Lloyd obtained Cabinet approval for a policy of hostility to Nasser, who was seen as a threat to British interests in the Middle East, and of building new British alliances with Jordan and Iraq. Part of this policy was the withdrawal of American and British financial aid for the Aswan High Dam, which would trigger Nasser's nationalisation of the Canal.Shepherd 1994, p114 Suez: crisis begins Dulles withdrew US financial help for the building of the Aswan High Dam on 19 July, in retaliation for Colonel Nasser's recognition of Mao's regime in China. Britain did not complain at the time, despite the urging of Roger Makins (British Ambassador to the USA). Britain completed her withdrawal from the Suez Base (under the 1954 Agreement) on 20 July 1956.Thorpe 1989, p215 The Suez Crisis then began in earnest on 26 July 1956 when Nasser nationalised the Suez Canal. The Cabinet met at 11.20am on 27 July in Eden's room in the House of Commons.Thorpe 1989, p217-8 It was decided that Nasser's action should be opposed on the grounds that the Canal was an international trust (he was entitled to nationalise the Canal Company, provided compensation was paid to shareholders) and that Britain, if necessary acting alone, should use force as a last resort. Eden straightaway included Lloyd on the Egypt Committee, along with Salisbury, Macmillan (Chancellor of the Exchequer), Home (Commonwealth Secretary) and Walter Monckton, who was Minister of Defence at the outset of the crisis. Kilmuir (Lord Chancellor) was later added; Butler was initially ill but later took to attending and even on occasion chairing Egypt Committee meetings. The Egypt Committee met for the first time at 7pm on 27 July, and would meet 42 times between then and 9 November.Williams 2010, p243 Lloyd preferred negotiations to force and, with his experience of military logistics, was sceptical as to whether a successful invasion could even be mounted. Dulles visited London on 31 July, and commented that \\"a way had to be found to make Nasser disgorge\\".Thorpe 1989, p219 British reservists were called up on 2 August, and on that day Macmillan raised with the Egypt Committee the prospect of Israel attacking Egypt.Thorpe 1989, p220 On 10 August Lloyd had a difficult meeting with the directors of the Suez Canal Company.Thorpe 1989, p221 On 14 August Eden and Lloyd met with the Labour leaders, who were opposed to the use of force without UN authorisation; Cabinet were informed of this at 11.30am. Australian Prime Minister Robert Menzies attended Cabinet at 11.30am, but stressed the need to educate public opinion. On 14 August Lloyd broadcast about the crisis to the public, and his talk was published in The Listener. Suez: First London Conference The first London Conference of nations with an interest in using the canal met from 16 to 23 August. Dulles laid a lot of stress on the 1888 Convention, but would have preferred it to meet in a neutral venue like Geneva, with the Soviet Foreign Minister in attendance.Thorpe 1989, p219, 222 The conference opened at 11am on 16 August, and Lloyd was elected chairman. 18 out of the 22 nations looked likely to agree. Lloyd helped to negotiate a formula for a new convention, in which Egypt would receive increased canal revenues and would have a place on the board of a new operating company. Dulles noted that \\"Mr Lloyd is showing obvious emotional strain\\" (21 August); Macmillan at this stage was telling Dulles that he hoped to be restored to the Foreign Office soon.Williams 2010, p246 Whilst Lloyd was negotiating, sections of the British press were drawing parallels between Nasser's deeds and the Chanak crisis of 1922 and the Anschluss of Austria in February 1938 and demanding action, a view shared by Eden and many other senior ministers. Monckton's outburst at the Egypt Committee on 24 August (he expressed dismay at this turn of events, after which he was moved from the Ministry of Defence) was not recorded in the minutes, but generated a great deal of correspondence between ministers. By early September the \\"Musketeer\\" Plan, which the British military had secretly been drawing up to seize Alexandria, had been replaced by \\"Musketeer Revise\\" to seize Port Said at the mouth of the Canal.Thorpe 1989, p223 Lloyd was disappointed by the failure of the Menzies mission to Cairo. It had been undermined by President Eisenhower's press conference on 4 September, opposing the use of force.Thorpe 1989, p222 On 5 September Lloyd flew to Paris for talks with Spaak about the NATO upcoming meeting.The ODNB states that Lloyd was in New York from 5 to 15 September \\"preparing for the Security Council meeting\\". This is impossible to reconcile with the more detailed account in Thorpe's 1989 biography, which has him attending meetings in London and exchanging messages with New York in this period. It may be a confusion with his absence in New York between 1 and 16 October. [Thorpe 1989, pp223-7, 229] On 7 September Lloyd was warned by his Canadian counterpart Lester Pearson that neither the USA nor Canada would allow the UN to be used as a cover for war. On 9 September Nasser rejected the proposals offered by the 18 powers at the London Conference. On 10 September the Cabinet agreed the Egypt Committee Plan to deprive Nasser of Suez Canal revenues, provided the USA agreed. At Cabinet on 11 September 1956 (where Lloyd reported that the Menzies Mission had failed) Eden gave what Lloyd later called the \\"clearest possible indication of intention to use force\\".Thorpe 1989, p224-5 Suez: Second London Conference Lloyd chaired the Second London Conference (19 - 21 September), working on Dulles' SCUA (Suez Canal Users' Association) proposal, a plan with which he was willing to cooperate. He wanted an immediate appeal to the UN to enforce rights of passage.Thorpe 1989, p225 Dulles would have preferred to get SCUA up and running before an appeal to the UN, and worried that a failed attack on Nasser would merely strengthen his position. Lloyd later wrote of Dulles that because of his experience as a corporate lawyer there was always \\"an escape clause\\". \\"He was devious. He would say one thing and do another. But believe it or not I liked him. We got on very well together.\\"Thorpe 1989, p226 After private discussion between Dulles and Lloyd, on 23 September there was an appeal to the President of the Security Council about navigation rights. On 24 September Lloyd was interviewed on Panorama, and stated that force would only be used as a last resort. On 26 September Lloyd informed the Cabinet about the failure of the Second London Conference. Eden and Lloyd flew to Paris for talks with Guy Mollet (French Prime Minister) and Christian Pineau (French Foreign Minister), without an interpreter (Eden spoke fluent French) and to which Sir Gladwyn Jebb, British Ambassador in Paris, was not invited. At dinner, Harold Macmillan rang from the IMF meeting in New York. On the morning of 27 September there were further Anglo-French talks before Eden and Lloyd returned to London. The Third London Conference opened at 11am on 1 October, but Lloyd flew to New York at 8.30pm that day, and would be out of the country until 16 October. At the UN talks, Britain and France felt that Dulles was not ruling out the use of force as a last resort.Thorpe 1989, pp226-7 Suez: Lloyd negotiates a settlement in New York In New York Lloyd attended the United Nations Security Council meeting, where he met Christian Pineau and Dr Fawzi, the French and Egyptian foreign ministers. On 10 and 11 October Lloyd had various talks with Fawzi. By 13 October the Seven Points were agreed, which would become the \\"Six Principles\\".The Six Principles were free passage of the canal, respect for Egyptian sovereignty, the canal not be under the control of any single country, tolls to be agreed between Egypt and other users, some revenues to be allocated to development and disputes to be put to arbitration [David Dutton: Anthony Eden: A Life and A Reputation (1997), p414] The Seven Points had also included permitting non-Egyptian personnel to work on the canal. [Thorpe 1989, p.228] UN Secretary-General Dag Hammarskj√∂ld had also been involved in the negotiations on the Six Principles.Williams 2010, p253 Whilst Lloyd was away, the Conservative Party Conference was in session at Llandudno (11 - 13 October), with loud calls for action against Nasser.Thorpe 1989, p228-9 Pineau was less cooperative and left New York on 13 October. Lloyd later wrote that agreement had been reached on the Six Principles, but not on how to implement them, although he conceded that Nasser had never accepted the principle that the Canal could not be under the control of any one country. On 13 October Sir Gladwyn Jebb warned Ivone Kirkpatrick (Permanent Under-Secretary at the Foreign Office) that France appeared to be cooperating with Israel against Egypt, and had sent her ninety-five Myst√®re jets, possibly with French pilots.Thorpe 1989, p229 Fawzi had been sympathetic to Lloyd's Six Principles, but with Soviet encouragement Egypt soon opposed the idea that the Canal not be controlled by any one country. Some of the Cabinet, including Lord Home, thought that Lloyd's \\"Six Principles\\" might have avoided armed conflict, while Lloyd himself thought that he had negotiated \\"a good-natured preamble to a missing treaty\\".Thorpe 1989, p230 With Lloyd still in New York, Albert Gazier (acting French Foreign Minister while Pineau was in New York) and General Challe (Deputy Chief of French Air Staff) visited Eden for a secret meeting at Chequers on 14 October. Before the meeting Gladwyn Jebb, who was not invited, sent Eden a personal telegram to dissuade him, but the meeting merely impressed Eden with French resolve. Concerned that if war broke out in the Middle East Britain might have to take the side of her ally Jordan against France's ally Israel, the French leaders outlined \\"The Plan\\" to Eden and Nutting: in the event of Israel attacking Egypt, Britain and France would intervene jointly to protect the canal, as Britain was entitled to do under the 1954 Treaty, and enforce international law. Eden recalled Lloyd from New York after Nutting had suggested that no decision could be taken without the Foreign Secretary. Lloyd saw Dag Hammarskjold at 10am on 15 October, then Krishna Menon at 12.30pm. He flew to London at 5pm New York time, landing at Heathrow at 11.15am (London time) on 16 October.Thorpe 1989, p231 Suez: Eden and Lloyd go to Paris Lloyd arrived late and jet-lagged for the 16 October meeting of the Egypt Committee in London; Anthony Nutting, junior Foreign Office minister, had stood in for him for the first part of the meeting. Nutting later claimed that on arrival Lloyd told him he'd \\"clinched it\\", i.e. achieved a deal in which the Canal would stay nationalised, with Nasser receiving revenues which would leave him better off than he would later be from World Bank loans, and that he had replied \\"we must have nothing to do with this\\" when Nutting tipped him off about the French plan.Thorpe 1989, p230-1 When the meeting resumed, Eden did not mention Lloyd's negotiations in New York but instead praised the French plan, which Lloyd later wrote of as \\"the plan for which I did not care\\". After an indeterminate discussion, Eden had lunch with Lloyd, and persuaded him that his New York agreement with Fawzi would never hold up and persuaded him to come to Paris to meet the French. At 4pm Eden and Lloyd flew to Paris. In Paris Eden and Lloyd had talks with their French counterparts Prime Minister Guy Mollet and Foreign Minister Christian Pineau.Matthew 2004, p160-1 Nutting later told the author Hugh Thomas that Lloyd had been \\"brainwashed\\" by Eden; Thomas toned this down in his 1967 book to \\"swept along\\". On 16 October Sir Gladwyn Jebb met Eden and Lloyd at Paris airport. In the car he asked Eden if he'd received his telegram about the French sending Mystere jets to Israel. Over Jebb's protests, the ambassadors were not invited to the Anglo-French talks.Thorpe 1989, p232 Lloyd continued to press his doubts, but to no avail. He urged international control over toll increases, with disputes referred to an independent body. The French insisted that Dulles was double-crossing the British and that SCUA was simply intended to play for time so that the British would not formally appeal to the Security Council. Mollet also said that the Egyptians had made so many threats to exterminate Israel that Israel could legitimately attack Egypt and plead self- defence. Eden was worried that the UK might have to come to Jordan's defence in the event of a Middle Eastern War (Palestinian guerrillas were operating against Israel from the West Bank, which would be under Jordanian control until 1967).Thorpe 1989, p233 Suez: Lloyd swallows his doubts Lloyd and Eden returned to London on 17 October. Lloyd reported to the Egypt Committee on the Security Council meeting in New York. Fawzi had stayed behind in New York for further talks with Hammarskjold. Lloyd later described 18 October as \\"an important day\\". Jebb had protested to Ivone Kirkpatrick at the exclusion of the ambassadors from the Anglo-French talks and had sent Lloyd a handwritten threat of resignation. Before the Cabinet meeting at 10 Downing Street that morning, Lloyd buttonholed Rab Butler outside the Cabinet Room. Butler later recorded (and Lloyd's account is similar) that Lloyd had gripped him by the arm, telling him that he had been \\"wafted\\" to Paris and warning him confidentially that there might be a preemptive strike by Israel against Jordan, Egypt and Syria.Jago 2015, p287 Butler's biographer Michael Jago thinks that Lloyd's behaviour was evidence that he was out of his depth.Jago 2015, p290-1 This Cabinet was thinly-attended.Shepherd 1994, p116 Lloyd reported to the Cabinet on the Security Council vote to keep the Canal insulated from the politics of any one country, despite Soviet veto of the second part of the resolution. There was to be another meeting in Geneva, with Egyptian participation. The Cabinet approved, but then moved on to Eden's disingenuous warnings that negotiations might be overtaken by hostilities between Israel and Egypt.Williams 2010, p254-5 Eden informed ministers that a plan (Operation \\"Musketeer Revise\\") was being drawn up to retake the Canal by force. \\"Musketeer Revise\\" was practicable only until the end of October, although in the event a slightly amended version was used for military operations in November. Afterwards Eden circulated a minute that he'd told the French that every effort must be made to stop Israel attacking Jordan, but that he had told Israel that Britain would not come to Egypt's aid in the event of an Israeli attack. Lloyd lunched on 18 October with Monckton, who was also a doubter but had not opposed the decision to use force. Monckton had just been moved from the Ministry of Defence to the position of Paymaster- General (24 September, effective 11 October). That afternoon Sir Humphrey Trevelyan, British Ambassador to Egypt, telegraphed to warn that Nasser was not willing to compromise on Egyptian control of the Canal. This marked the apparent failure of Lloyd's attempt to negotiate a peaceful settlement and was, in the view of his biographer, the moment which he should perhaps have used an excuse to resign.Thorpe 1989, p234 On Friday 19 October Lloyd had a meeting with Butler at 9.30am and informed him fully about the trip to Paris. A day of talks at 10 Downing Street then followed; topics included the impending Jordanian elections and a speech which Lloyd was due to make to Conservative activists at Liverpool the next day. Lloyd went to Chequers on Sunday 21 October (having been summoned by Eden on the phone the previous day). The press were told that Lloyd had a cold so that he could go to Paris in secret to meet the Israelis.Thorpe 1989, p236 Suez: Lloyd's secret trip to Sevres Lloyd, accompanied by his Private Secretary Donald Logan, then went to Sevres, just outside Paris, on 22 October. Eden insisted that British action not be in response to Israeli demands.Jago 2015, p288-9 Logan drove Lloyd to the airport in his own car to maintain secrecy, although he was not told the destination until they were underway. David Carlton argued that this tied Lloyd into the conspiracy by getting him to meet Ben Gurion.Thorpe 1989, p237 He nearly had a serious car accident between Paris airport and Sevres.Thorpe 1989, p238 The discussion at Sevres was in English. He commented, in a joke which fell flat, that he ought to have turned up wearing a false moustache, a comment which Maurice Bourg√®s-Maunoury (French Minister of Defence) misremembered and claimed that Lloyd actually had turned up wearing a false moustache.Thorpe 1989, p239 Lloyd met Pineau, who said that the Israelis would attack Egypt but only with Anglo-French air support. Lloyd then, at 7pm, met the Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion, who like Pineau was disappointed by his obvious lack of enthusiasm for military action. General Moshe Dayan (Israeli Chief of Staff), Shimon Peres and Mordechai Bar- On were also part of the Israeli delegation. Lloyd warned that the UN, the Commonwealth and Scandinavian countries were opposed to the use of force. Israel demanded that British Canberra bombers bomb Egypt from their bases in Cyprus; Lloyd merely promised to seek the Cabinet's opinion on the matter. Lloyd demanded that British airstrikes be delayed for 48 hours after the outbreak of hostilities, so that collusion would not be too obvious, but in the end compromised on 36 hours. Lloyd was still worried about an Israeli attack on Jordan. Dayan later recalled (\\"Story of My Life\\" p218) that \\"[Lloyd]'s manner could not have been more antagonistic. His whole demeanour expressed distaste ‚Äì for the place, the company, and the topic ‚Ä¶ His opening remarks suggested the tactics of a customer bargaining with extortionate merchants.\\" Lloyd left towards midnight.Thorpe 1989, p239-40 Suez: Protocol of Sevres The next morning, 23 October, the newspapers were full of stories about the Hungarian uprising. At 10am Lloyd reported to a group of senior ministers (not the whole Egypt Committee), then to the Cabinet at 11am.Thorpe 1989, p240 Eden told the Cabinet that there had been secret talks with Israel in Paris. Lloyd told the Cabinet that he was still hoping for a peaceful settlement, but that the French were not interested in a peaceful settlement and that Nasser would retain his interest in the Middle East. Eden told that Cabinet that, based on what Lloyd said, and contrary to Eden's comments of 18 October, an Israeli attack on Egypt now seemed less likely. Pineau arrived in London that evening. He dined with Eden and Lloyd joined them after dinner (he was no more than \\"a spectator\\" in his biographer's words as Pineau and Eden reaffirmed their enthusiasm for the plan). Pineau outlined Dayan's plan (for Israel to attack Egypt) to Eden.Thorpe 1989, p241 Lloyd was in the House of Commons on 24 October, so was not present when the secret Protocol of Sevres was signed. He refused to return to Sevres as he could hardly pretend to be ill again after having just appeared in public. In his instructions to Patrick Dean, who went in his place, Lloyd stressed that Britain had not asked Israel to intervene. Later that morning Eden informed the Cabinet about the consultation with Pineau the previous evening. The objective of any Anglo-French action would be to control the Canal and secondly to topple Nasser.Thorpe 1989, p242 The Cabinet further considered the use of force on 24 October.Shepherd 1994, p117 After Cabinet, Lloyd recorded his UN Day Broadcast for the BBC, for transmission that evening. He then had a tense meeting with Ivone Kirkpatrick and Gladwyn Jebb, who was still angry at being kept in the dark. At 11pm Lloyd went to 10 Downing Street to hear Dean's report on the second Sevres meeting. Mountbatten (First Sea Lord) also attended. The French had produced three copies of a typed document, the Protocol of Sevres. Eden later tried in vain to retrieve the French and Israeli copies to destroy the evidence of collusion.Thorpe 1989, p243 On the morning of 25 October Eden told the Cabinet that Israel would attack Egypt after all, but did not tell them about the secret Sevres Protocol. The Plan for an Anglo-French invasion was revealed to the Cabinet. Lord Salisbury was away ill. Butler did not object although Macleod would have backed him had he done so. Heathcoat Amory, Minister of Agriculture, warned of the effect on Anglo-American relations.Thorpe 1989, p244 The Egypt Committee met four times on 25 and 26 October.Thorpe 1989, p246 The Chiefs of Staff knew that the USA had broken French codes and knew of all military preparations.Thorpe 1989, p260 Suez: ultimatum Israel attacked Egypt in the Sinai on 29 October; Eden was informed that night and informed the Cabinet the next day. Aldrich, US Ambassador, was unable to get a meeting with Lloyd and he and Dulles found out from the press.Thorpe 1989, p247 At Cabinet on the morning of 30 October Lloyd reported that the USA was ready to move a motion at the UN condemning Israel as an aggressor, and proposed a delay in order to bring the Americans on board. This suggestion was not adopted. At 4.30pm on 30 October Eden announced the Anglo-French ultimatum to the House of Commons. The House became so rowdy that it had to be suspended for the first time since 1924. Britain and France began bombing Egypt on 31 October,Davenport-Hines 2013, p203 despite hostility from the Opposition, the USA and most of the Commonwealth. The US Sixth Fleet harassed the Anglo-French taskforce as it made its way to the Eastern Mediterranean.Shepherd 1994, p118 On 31 October William Yates, a Conservative MP, commented in the House of Commons that he had heard talk of a secret conspiracy;Thorpe 1989, p210 on 31 October Lloyd stated in the Commons that \\"It is quite wrong to state that Israel was incited to this action by Her Majesty's Government. There was no prior agreement between us about it.\\" This passage is underlined in Lloyd's personal copy of Hansard (now in the library at Fettes School). He regarded it as a lawyerishly careful statementThorpe 1989, p247-8 although it has been portrayed by some writers as an outright lie to the House of Commons. Nasser proclaimed martial law and mobilisation in Egypt. In an emergency session of the UN, Dulles' motion for a ceasefire was vetoed by Britain. On 1 November Eden sent a message to Mollet urging that the French air force and navy desist from openly assisting the Israelis, as they had been doing since 31 October.Thorpe 1989, p248 Nutting resigned (2 November, but made public on 5 November) because of the breach of the 1954 Treaty, the Tripartite Treaty and the UN Charter.Thorpe 1989, p245 Lloyd resisted the temptation to join him and continued to ask questions about military logistics at Cabinet. Suez: decision to invade There were two Cabinets on Friday 2 November.Thorpe 1989, p249 The USA sidestepped the Anglo- French veto on the UN Security Council by obtaining an overwhelming vote for a ceasefire in the General Assembly. The Cabinet agreed that even in the event of a ceasefire between Egypt and Israel, Anglo-French forces should still seize the Canal in a policing role until UN forces were able to take up the baton (Macleod and Heathcoat Amory were doubtful). At the 4.30pm Cabinet, records for which were closed until 2007, Lloyd was concerned about the effect on Britain's Arab client states of being seen to be too closely linked to Israel. Eden spoke about the conditions which would be necessary for the UN to take over the peacekeeping job at the canal. At the 9.30pm Cabinet Lloyd reported on the problem of arms exports to Israel, and reported that he had been asked by BP whether or not to divert a cargo of aviation fuel currently intended for Israel. At Cabinet on Friday 2 November Lloyd suggested that in the event of oil sanctions Britain might have to occupy Kuwait and Qatar.Williams 2010, p259 On Saturday 3 November Lloyd was shouted down in the House of Commons, in a debate so rowdy that the Speaker had to suspend the session.Williams 2010, p260-1 By the weekend of 3‚Äì4 November, fighting between Israel and Egypt had largely ceased. Lloyd called Sunday 4 November \\"one of the most dramatic days in the whole of the Suez Crisis\\". He spent the whole day at 10 Downing Street, first in private talks with Eden, during which he advised that to call off the operation at this late stage would lead to \\"dreadful consequences\\". Afterwards Lloyd rang Gladwyn Jebb in Paris and asked him to arrange a further meeting with Pineau, Bourges-Manoury and Jebb himself. There was then a meeting of the Egypt Committee at 12.30pm. Lloyd reported that the USA had not pushed for a vote on her UN General Assembly resolution, but that resolutions calling for a UN peacekeeping force had been proposed by Canada and by a group of African and Asian countries. Lloyd advised that Britain should respond to the Canadian but not to the Afro-Asian ultimatum, but warned of the threat of oil sanctions. There was a second meeting of the Egypt Committee at 3.30pm, at which Lloyd passed on the warning of the British Ambassador to Iraq that Britain had to condemn Israeli aggression in order to preserve her status in Arab eyes. He also raised the question of what would happen if both Israel and Egypt agreed to a ceasefire before British and French troops had gone in. There was then a meeting of the full Cabinet at 6.30pm, at which the decision to invade Egypt was taken. Butler, Kilmuir and Heathcoat Amory wanted to postpone the paratroop landings for 48 hours, while Salisbury, Buchan-Hepburn and Monckton (the latter of whom hinted that he might resign) wanted to postpone indefinitely. Lloyd was among the majority of the 18 present who wanted to push ahead with the invasion. Throughout the meetings that day the Trafalgar Square demonstration had been audible outside.Thorpe 1989, p249-50 Suez: invasion and ceasefire British and French paratroops landed at dawn on 5 November. Lloyd was given a rough ride in the House of Commons when he announced the Soviet crushing of the Hungarian uprising. The news of Nutting's resignation came through at 6.30pm while Lloyd was attending a sherry party at 10 Downing Street ahead of the State Opening of Parliament. However, Gladwyn Jebb sent a message that Douglas Dillon, US Ambassador in Paris, had no issue with the landings and thought Dulles' policy \\"lamentable\\".Thorpe 1989, p251 On the morning of 6 November Macmillan, who had been told by Humphrey (US Treasury Secretary) that there would be no more financial assistance until there was a ceasefire, saw Lloyd before Cabinet and told him that Britain had to stop in view of the drain of foreign exchange reserves. Macmillan had also been lobbying other ministers. Cabinet met at 9.45am at Eden's room at the House of Commons, with Marshal of the RAF Sir William Dickson, Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee, in attendance. Pierson Dixon (British Ambassador to the UN) had warned that the UN were contemplating oil sanctions. In the event, Lloyd was one of three ministers (along with Anthony Head and James Stuart) to support Eden in his wish to carry on fighting. The Cabinet agreed that there was no choice but to agree a ceasefire. Royal Marines had been landing by sea and helicopter on 6 November, and British and French forces had Port Said and had advanced 23 miles to El Cap by the time a ceasefire was announced at 5pm.Williams 2010, p265-7 Suez: withdrawal On 7 November the United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution calling for withdrawal of British, French and Israeli forces. Lloyd's initial position was that Britain was not prepared to withdraw her forces until they had been replaced by a peacekeeping force acceptable to Britain. The Americans met this idea with extreme hostility, insisting on total British withdrawal.Thorpe 1989, p252-4 Lloyd flew to New York on Sunday 11 November and stayed until the evening of Monday 27 November. To Lloyd's displeasure Hammarskjold was visiting Nasser in Cairo at this time. Whilst Lloyd was away, on 13 November Macmillan, who was busily ingratiating himself with the Americans, told Aldrich (US Ambassador to London) that Selwyn Lloyd was \\"too young and inexperienced\\" for his position.Jago 2015, p297 Lloyd visited Dulles (who had been ill for the climax of the Suez Crisis) in hospital on 18 November. He recorded that Dulles asked \\"Why didn't you go on [i.e. to occupy the whole canal, having begun military action]?\\" When Lloyd replied: \\"Well, Foster, if you'd so much as winked we might have,\\" Lloyd recorded that Dulles murmured that the Americans could not possibly have done that, and turned away.Thorpe 1989, p253 On 20 November 1956 the question of collusion was raised in Cabinet, with Eden and Lloyd both absent; it was agreed to stick to Lloyd's formula that Britain had not incited the Israeli attack.Shepherd 1994, pp119-20 In Washington Lloyd managed to speak to Eisenhower's adviser Walter Bedell Smith, and addressed the UN General Assembly on Friday 23 November, the day Eden left for Jamaica. In a speech which was essentially an acceptance of an Argentinian motion, Lloyd offered to hand over to a UN peacekeeping force and claimed that Britain had prevented a small war growing into a larger one. Despite a hostile attack by Krishna Menon, the resolution was carried. Lloyd addressed a Cabinet meeting (chaired by Butler, with Eden away in Jamaica) at 4.30pm on Wednesday 28 November. He said that the UN would continue to debate the matter and that although Britain could hold on for another three or four weeks there was nothing to be gained in antagonising world opinion any further. He offered his resignation (not mentioned in the minutes) but his colleagues refused to accept it, and was later deeply hurt when Lord Hinchingbrooke, a member of the Suez group (a group of Conservative backbenchers who had opposed Britain's original agreement to withdraw from Egypt in 1954), said that he should have resigned.Thorpe 1989, p254-6 Lloyd's impending divorce was given as the ostensible reason for his offer of resignation.Thorpe 1989, p257 Throughout November and into early December Lloyd, like Butler who was acting Prime Minister from 22 November (with Eden away in Jamaica), was strongly attacked in the House of Commons both by Labour as a scapegoat for the original invasion and by Conservative backbenchers for the enforced withdrawal. On 3 December Lloyd made a statement announcing British withdrawal to a very hostile House, followed by an angry scene, then Butler made a similar announcement, leading many Conservative MPs feeling that Butler should have made the statement himself.Jago 2015, p311 The House of Commons held a No Confidence debate on Suez on 5 December. Aneurin Bevan commented that Lloyd gave the impression of never having warned Israel not to attack Egypt.Thorpe 1989, p256 Bevan congratulated Lloyd on \\"having survived so far\\". The government won the confidence vote on 6 December by 327 votes to 260.Jago 2015, p312 In early December Lloyd again offered his resignation to the Cabinet, citing his impending divorce as the excuse. =Foreign Secretary under Macmillan= Reappointment When Eden resigned in January 1957, Lord Salisbury interviewed the Cabinet one by one, asking each whether he preferred Butler (believed to be the favourite by most outsiders) or Macmillan (the overwhelming choice of the Cabinet) for the succession. Salisbury listed Lloyd as the only minister to abstain, shocking Lord Chancellor Kilmuir, who acted as official witness to the \\"soundings\\".Williams 2010, p274Thorpe 2010, pp. 361‚Äì362. Lloyd later confirmed to Butler in September 1962 that he had expressed no preference.Thorpe 1989, p270 Macmillan retained Lloyd as Foreign Secretary, declaring that \\"one head on a charger is enough\\" (i.e. that Eden's resignation was enough of a sacrifice to appease the government's critics). Another reason was Macmillan's wish to keep Butler out of the Foreign Office.Williams 2010, p280 Lloyd was paradoxically a beneficiary of Suez, as Eden might well have reshuffled him away from the Foreign Office.Thorpe 1989, p268 Macmillan delegated a lot more than Eden, and allowed Lloyd to come into his own.Thorpe 1989, p274 Lloyd was allowed to use Chequers, normally the Prime Minister's country residence, although Macmillan did not formally renounce the use of the place as by law he would not have been allowed to claim it back in the space of that Parliament (Macmillan had a country home of his own, Birch Grove, and so had no need of the place).Thorpe 1989, p274-5 Although Lloyd was not particularly interested in the job, Macmillan tried to encourage him to think of himself as a potential Prime Minister, as a rival to Butler. Lloyd's reappointment was met, in the words of a contemporary observer, with a \\"long, cold arch of raised eyebrows\\", whilst Aneurin Bevan likened Lloyd to a monkey to Macmillan's organgrinder.Sandford 2005, pp.77-8 1957 As Foreign Secretary, Lloyd had to accompany the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh on their State Visit to Portugal in February 1957.Thorpe 1989, p277-9 Lloyd accompanied Macmillan to Bermuda (21-4 March), where Anglo- American relations were repaired, although private discussions were more frank than the press releases might have suggested. Over dinner Lloyd launched a strong attack on Nasser; Dulles replied that the USA would not defend Nasser's regime but were not actively going to try to overthrow him.Williams 2010, p285-6 Whilst in Bermuda Macmillan, after consultation with Lloyd, agreed to release Archbishop Makarios, who had been exiled to the Seychelles in March 1956, after being advised that this might calm EOKA down. This prompted the resignation of Lord Salisbury from the Cabinet. Lloyd's divorce was in progress between March and June 1957. He tried to resign in May 1957, citing as the reason the unfavourable publicity which his divorce might attract.Thorpe 1989, p280 In May 1957 Randolph Churchill speculated that he might be about to be removed from office. At one point that year Beaverbrook's \\"Daily Express\\" ran a picture of Lloyd with a lady on holiday in Spain, asking \\"Who is the senorita?\\" In fact the lady and her husband ‚Äì who was doctored out of the photograph ‚Äì were long-standing friends of Lloyd and were sharing a holiday with him.Davenport-Hines 2013, p200 In October 1957 he likened himself to a \\"human Sputnik\\" because of the amount of flying he was doing.Thorpe 1989, p282 1958 Lloyd again offered his resignation after a poor performance in the two-day Foreign Affairs debate in February 1958, but Macmillan refused to accept it as he had recently had his entire Treasury team (Peter Thorneycroft, Nigel Birch and Enoch Powell) resign. In May 1958 Lebanese President Camille Chamoun appealed for help against the United Arab Republic (Egypt and Syria, both ruled by Nasser). Lloyd coordinated with Dulles and US troops were sent to Lebanon in accordance with the \\"Eisenhower Doctrine\\". Two British paratroop battalions were sent to Jordan after a request by King Hussein.Williams 2010, p312Thorpe 1989, p283 Lloyd wanted to go to the Anglo- American Washington talks in June 1958 but Dulles vetoed this, claiming that if he went it would be necessary to invite the French as well.Williams 2010, p308 On Monday 14 July 1958 Macmillan was at Birch Grove, and recorded that Lloyd \\"almost shouted down the line\\" about the revolution in Iraq, warning that Jordan and Syria might also fall to Nasser. Macmillan sent him to Washington to sound out Dulles. By August 1958 Lloyd publicly supported the US over Formosa whilst privately urging restraint. He also had private talks with Churchill that summer to seek his advice.Thorpe 1989, p284 Lloyd had been very sceptical that Macmillan would be able to negotiate a Greek-Turkish agreement over Cyprus.Williams 2010, p314-5 In December 1958 at a NATO Ministerial Council Lloyd negotiated the concept of \\"sovereign bases\\" in Cyprus, where the Governor was his old Cambridge contemporary Hugh Foot, with the Greek and Turkish foreign ministers.Thorpe 1989, p285 Macmillan wrote of Lloyd in his diary (31 December 1958) that \\"he really is an extraordinary (sic) capable and efficient man ‚Äì as well as a wonderfully agreeable man to work with. He feels a great sense of gratitude and loyalty to me personally, for I have been able (by moral support both in private and in public) to help him through a bad time\\" [i.e. his divorce].Williams 2010, p325 D.R. Thorpe describes Lloyd as \\"Sancho Panza to Macmillan's mercurial Quixote\\". 1959 In November 1958 Khrushchev had demanded that the western powers pull out of West Berlin within six months. This was a prime reason for Macmillan and Lloyd's trip to Moscow early in 1959, besides the desire to grandstand ahead of the impending general election.Thorpe 1989, p287-90 Lloyd accompanied Macmillan to Moscow in February‚ÄìMarch 1959. Much of the planning for the summit had had to take place at the Middlesex Hospital, where Lloyd was having his tonsils out.Williams 2010, p331-3 Lloyd also attended planning meetings at Chequers in late February. At Moscow Ambassador Sir Patrick Reilly wrote that he was \\"quite first class and they make an admirable team\\" and \\"the ideal second\\", keeping his boss supplied with facts and figures and willingly undertaking tedious detailed negotiations. Macmillan thanked Lloyd for having come up with the idea of a diplomatic cold in response to Khrushchev's diplomatic toothache. Afterwards Lloyd reported on the summit to Charles de Gaulle and Konrad Adenauer. Lloyd also accompanied Macmillan to Ottawa, where they met John Diefenbaker and Washington, DC in March 1959, where they met Eisenhower and visited the dying Dulles.Williams 2010, p337 Lloyd was the leader at the Foreign Ministers' conference in Geneva in June 1959 (with Christian Herter, Maurice Couve de Murville and Andrei Gromyko) and kept it going, allowing Eisenhower to issue his invitation to Khrushchev to visit Washington in August. Whilst the conference had been in progress a false story had appeared in \\"The Times\\", fanned by Randolph Churchill and to Macmillan's apparent annoyance, that Lloyd was to be moved from the Foreign Office. The conference ended on 11 August.Thorpe 1989, p291-3 During the victorious 1959 election campaign Lloyd made a national broadcast on 19 September.Thorpe 1989, p294 1959-60 Lloyd kept a detailed diary between 1 November 1959 and his sacking from the Exchequer in July 1962.Thorpe 1989, p295 Many of the press still saw Lloyd as an insignificant Foreign Secretary, although this was no longer the opinion of many of those who knew him.Thorpe 1989, p296 Lloyd also accompanied Macmillan to a meeting in Paris in December 1959.Williams 2010, p354 He approved of Macmillan's \\"Winds of Change\\" speech in February 1960, which predicted the end of rule by Europeans in Africa.Thorpe 1989, p301 In February 1960 Lloyd urged Macmillan, having rebuilt bridges with the Americans, to build bridges with France by accepting de Gaulle's invitation to visit him for a longer stay, a turn of events which Macmillan would use to try to persuade de Gaulle to support British membership of the EEC.Williams 2010, p362 In March 1960 Lloyd noted that his one unfulfilled ambition was to be Lord Chancellor, but he did not consider himself a distinguished enough lawyer for the post ‚Äì he was later to change his mind when Lord Dilhorne was appointed.Thorpe 1989, p302 In mid-May 1960 he accompanied Macmillan to the Four Power Summit in Paris , which broke up in disarray after the U2 had been shot down whilst flying over the USSR. Some see the failure of this summit as the moment when Macmillan's premiership went into decline.Thorpe 1989, p302-4Williams 2010, p368 Agreement was finally reached over Cyprus on 1 July 1960, just before the end of Lloyd's time at the Foreign Office. =Chancellor of the Exchequer= Appointment and economic backdrop In July 1960 Macmillan moved Lloyd to the job of Chancellor of the Exchequer.Edmund Dell, The Chancellors: A History of the Chancellors of the Exchequer, 1945-90 (HarperCollins, 1997) pp 258-82. He was Macmillan's third chancellor and asked for, and was given, an assurance that he would remain in place until the next General Election. Lloyd was permitted to remain at Chequers and was also allowed to keep 1, Carlton Gardens, normally the Foreign Secretary's London residence (the chancellor's usual London residence of 11 Downing Street was not available, as Downing Street was being reconstructed at the time, requiring Macmillan to live at Admiralty House for most of his premiership).Dell 1997, p260 Macmillan, with bitter memories of his time as MP for Stockton in the 1930s, wanted to be free of what he saw as the economic orthodoxy of the Treasury and Bank of England, and to generate economic growth, a view which he shared with many economic thinkers at the time.Dell 1997, p258, 261 He also wanted growth to increase exports, so as to improve the balance of payments without deflation or devaluing the currency.Dell 1997, p263 He declined to appoint David Eccles, Iain Macleod or Reginald Maudling, any of whom might have been better qualified to be chancellor, as he wanted a loyal \\"staff officer\\". Lloyd, however, warned Macmillan that he wanted to be an orthodox chancellor. The economy had been booming as a result of the expansionary measures taken in the run-up to the 1959 General Election, with consequent risk to inflation. Furthermore, the balance of payments was moving into deficit, with Britain's share of world manufacturing falling dramatically as continental Europe, now grouped into the EEC, recovered from the effects of the war. In 1960 Britain suffered the worst balance of payments crisis since 1950, masked a little by the inflow of foreign money into London. The Treasury was already somewhat discredited. Bank Rate had already been raised to 6% by Lloyd's predecessor Heathcote Amory in June.Dell 1997, p261 Soon after his appointment, Lloyd asked Treasury economic advisor Robert Hall (29 July 1960) \\"how soon we were going bust\\". On 16 March 1961 Lloyd wrote to Macmillan complaining that No 10 was briefing the press than Macmillan was in real charge of economic policy, and indeed policy in other areas.Dell 1997, p259 Also the German Deutschmark was revalued by 5% in March 1961, leading to worries that the pound sterling might crash in the summer of 1961. 1961: Budget and July measures Lloyd arranged government funding for the National Theatre on the South Bank. His first Budget (17 April 1961) began by saying that during the 1960-1 fiscal year there had been a deficit of ¬£394m, ¬£76m more than Amory had forecast in the 1960 budget. Lloyd was concerned at rising inflation and public spending. The Budget was intended to be deflationary, and to reduce the government borrowing requirement to ¬£69m for 1961-2 (in the event it was ¬£211m), but increased taxes by less than the Treasury wanted. The budget introduced \\"the Regulator\\", which allowed the Chancellor of the day to vary the rate of most indirect taxes by up to 10% of the existing rate (not ten percentage points) without the need for prior Parliamentary approval, although Parliament had to approve within three weeks. Another measure, effectively a second Regulator (brought in over the objections of John Boyd-Carpenter, Minister of Pensions and National Insurance) allowed the Chancellor to increase Employers' NICs by up to 4 shillings per week.Employers' National Insurance Contributions are paid by the employer on behalf of the worker but are not deducted from the worker's wages, unlike employee NICs, which are deducted from wages as if they were a taxDell 1997, p262-3 Lloyd also raised the threshold for surtax on earned income, which had been unchanged since Lloyd George had introduced it in 1909, from ¬£2,000 per annum to ¬£5,000. This measure had actually been Macmillan's idea.Dell 1997, p263-4 By the summer a run on the pound was threatened. Continental banks, who had been buying pounds, now announced that they had enough of a stockpile (¬£300m) and the Treasury demanded cuts of ¬£300m in demand and a cancellation of the raising of the surtax threshold ‚Äì the latter was a politically impossible demand. Some ministers suggested floating the pound, an option which Macmillan discussed in his diary on 23 July, although he rejected it as it would have irritated the Americans and would have had to be accompanied by deflation. In fact the balance of payments was already moving back into surplus, but based on out-of-date Treasury figures (\\"last year's Bradshaw\\" as Macmillan once famously quipped) Lloyd announced a package of measures on 25 July: bank rate was raised to 7%, public spending was cut, and $1.5bn was borrowed from the IMF, along with conditions, although not as strict as the IMF would have liked. Macmillan wrote to ministers on 28 July ordering public spending restraint.Dell 1997, p264-6 Lloyd refused to use his power to increase Employers' NICs in the July measures, saying it was \\"a dead rat\\". Cairncross, who had succeeded Robert Hall as the government's economic advisor, believed that Lloyd might have given some kind of private promise not to actually use it. Lloyd also announced a Pay Pause on 25 July, until 31 March 1962. Labour moved into a 5 point lead in the opinion polls. The Pay Pause (effectively an incomes policy) made Lloyd a focus of public unpopularity. It mainly affected public sector employees such as nurses and teachers as many private companies had contractual arrangements for automatic pay rises or arbitration.Williams 2010, p390, 402-4Thorpe 2010, p. 518 1961: NEDC Lloyd had announced that there would be a new economic planning body as part of his 25 July measures.Dell 1997, p267 On 8 August Lloyd suggested inviting Industry and Trade Union leaders. There was a stormy meeting of the Cabinet on 21 September, at which only John Hare and Lord Hailsham supported him, but covert support for the proposal from Macmillan swung other ministers behind the scheme. On 23 September, after a period of consultation, formal invitations were issued to the TUC, the Federation of British Industry, the British Employers' Confederation, the National Union of Manufacturers and the Association of British Chambers of Commerce.Thorpe 1989, p327 He told them of his plans to set up the National Economic Development Council (NEDC) in imitation of the French Commissariat du Plan, chaired by the Chancellor, and containing a few other ministers, as well as other appointed members who would include leading trade unionists and business leaders, as well perhaps as other economic thinkers. He also proposed setting up a National Economic Development Organisation (NEDO), whose chair would be drawn from outside the civil service, to advise NEDC. Lloyd did not get on with trade unionists. The TUC, which disliked the Pay Pause, agreed to cooperate only on condition that they were not expected to preach wage restraint.Dell 1997, p269-70 Thorpe writes that Lloyd had Macmillan's backing against a sceptical Cabinet, but Williams writes that Lloyd was lukewarm about the NEDC, which was Macmillan's project.Williams 2010, p402-4 Henry Brooke was appointed to the new position of Chief Secretary to the Treasury in October 1961 so Lloyd did not have to spend all his time arguing with Cabinet colleagues about their planned level of expenditure.Thorpe 1989, p314 The NEDC was unlikely to reap any benefits by the time of the next general election, nor to help in reining pay in. There was a big pay increase in the electricity industry in November 1961, because of the strength of the unions and the weakness of the minister Richard Wood.Dell 1997, p273 The Pay Pause had brought short term benefits but anomalies had made it unpopular, something it shared with later incomes policies. There was even a threat to strike by the 120 workers who made cricket balls.Dell 1997, p274 1962: second budget and Orpington On 29 January 1962 John Hare, Minister of Labour, confirmed that the Pay Pause would end on 31 March. Lloyd presented a White Paper on Incomes Policies, urging an official \\"Guiding Light\\" of 2.5%, a rate which the government expected pay to be increased by companies and tribunals. The White Paper also condemned automatic wage increases because of cost of living increases and comparability between different types of work. In presenting his White Paper on Incomes Policy Lloyd was seen as \\"stubborn\\" \\"wooden\\" \\"inarticulate\\" and \\"unimaginative\\" (Harold Evans Downing Street Diary). He also performed poorly in putting across government policy on television. On 14 February 1962, over whisky at 10 Downing Street, Macmillan persuaded the railway union bosses to call off their planned strike, an achievement trumpeted by the press as \\"Mac's Triumph\\". The NEDC first met on 7 March 1962. The Liberals did very well at a by-election at Conservative-held Blackpool North on 13 March 1962, and took Orpington off the Conservatives at another by-election on 14 March, a sensational victory in a seat adjacent to Macmillan's own seat at Bromley. Party Chairman Iain Macleod's report blamed the Pay Pause for the defeat at Orpington. In April 1962, on the eve of Lloyd's second and final budget, he faced a Cabinet rebellion over Schedule A tax (a tax on the theoretical rental value of a house, paid by the homeowner). The Conference Party Conference at Scarborough in October 1960 had voted for the abolition of Schedule A and the Cabinet now insisted on it.Thorpe 1989, pp333-4 Lloyd promised to end Schedule A the following year, at a cost of ¬£50m to the Exchequer.Dell 1997, p275 In his 9 April 1962 Budget Lloyd announced an agreed growth target of 4% per annum (he would have preferred 5%). This was in line with current rates of growth in continental Europe, but the Treasury were sceptical that the UK could achieve it, rightly as it turned out. The question of the growth in public spending was left unresolved.Dell 1997, p270-1 In the 1962 Budget Lloyd also increased profits tax by 2.5% and brought in a speculative gains tax, although he stopped short of introducing a capital gains tax, which he thought would discourage saving and enterprise.Dell 1997, p272 The budget, on 9 April 1962, reduced purchase tax on cars, TVs and washing machines but increased it on sweets, soft drinks and ice cream, leading to claims that Lloyd was \\"taxing children's pocket money.\\"Thorpe 2010, p. 520 The tax on confectionery was expected to raise ¬£30m that year and ¬£50m in a full year. Rumours were already circulating that Lloyd's days in the job were numbered: the journalist William Rees-Mogg wrote that it was \\"Mr Lloyd's last Budget\\".Thorpe 2010, p520 Macmillan appears to have agreed that the 1962 budget could not be a popular one, but the Cabinet revolt, which Lloyd lacked the eloquence to counter, was an embarrassment to Macmillan as well, which added to Macmillan's irritation with Lloyd. Lloyd also argued that confidence had been restored ‚Äì a run on the pound had been averted, ¬£225m of the $1.5bn (¬£535m) borrowed the previous year had been repaid to the IMF, and the balance of payments was improving. Many industrialists also felt that Britain's economic problems, especially her balance of payments deficit, should be solved by expansion, not by contraction, a view shared by Labour Leader Hugh Gaitskell, and by Roy Jenkins, who in the budget debate quoted the \\"Financial Times\\" to the effect that the budget had done nothing for exports or for investment.Dell 1997, p277 1962: Macmillan's wish for an incomes policy Macmillan, disingenuously, as he had already decided to sack him, wrote to Lloyd on 11 April congratulating him and asking him to begin preparing an expansionary budget for 1963 to help the Conservatives win re-election. During 1962 Lloyd's credibility and that of the Treasury was further damaged when it became clear that the Treasury had overestimated the strength of the economy, meaning that the July 1961 measures had been excessively severe. Bank Rate was cut to 4.5% on 26 April, and ¬£70m of Special Deposits were released on 31 May.Dell 1997, p276 Macmillan was pushing for a full-on incomes policy, led by the NEDC, in the hope that his growth policy would not lead to inflation. He addressed the Cabinet about economic policy on 28 May 1962, stressing that he wanted Britain to achieve low unemployment, low inflation, high growth and a strong pound, and that this could best be achieved by an incomes policy to boost productivity. Lloyd was sceptical.Williams 2010, p407-12 The Liberals did very well at another by-election at West Derbyshire on 6 June.Williams 2010, p402-4 Williams gives the date as April, which was a separate by-election in Labour held Derby North. On 19 June Macmillan presented his ideas on incomes policy to three or four colleagues at Chequers. Macmillan urged a \\"guiding light\\" (a target for wage increases as had been agreed at the beginning of the year), a Standing Commission on Pay (but with power only to give advice, not to coerce wage settlements), abolition of Resale Price Maintenance (in the end this would be done by Edward Heath in 1964) and creation of a Consumers Council; Lloyd was sceptical but the other ministers seemed in favour.Dell 1997, p278 Macmillan had lunch with Butler on 21 June to discuss the impending reshuffle. Macleod, Lord Home, Martin Redmayne (Chief Whip) and Sir Norman Brook (Cabinet Secretary and Joint Permanent Secretary to the Treasury) were all urging Macmillan to change his chancellor, in Brook's case for reasons of civil service management rather than politics. Macmillan also suspected that Lloyd, Butler and/or Eccles might be plotting against him. 22 June saw ministerial discussion of Macmillan's incomes paper; 6 July saw another ministerial discussion.Dell 1997, p279 Dismissal Macmillan would have liked to appoint Lloyd Home Secretary, as he was moving Rab Butler from this post, but Lloyd had made clear when Macmillan became Prime Minister in January 1957 that as an opponent of capital punishment it would not be proper for him to accept that position (because a person sentenced to hang was entitled to appeal to the Monarch for mercy, which in practice meant that the Home Secretary, to whom the task was delegated, had the final say on whether any execution should proceed).Thorpe 2010, p. 522 Macmillan planned to break the news of his impending dismissal to Lloyd, but Butler leaked it to the press first ‚Äì the news appeared in the \\"Daily Mail\\" on the morning of 12 July. 12 July was also the day of the Leicester North East by-election, and Cabinet were due to discuss incomes policy. At the by election the Conservative share of the vote dropped from 48.1% in 1959 to 24.2%.Thorpe 2010, p. 521 That evening Lloyd was sacked from the government and returned to the backbenches, after a 45 minute meeting which Macmillan described as \\"a terribly difficult and emotional scene\\". Next morning, 13 July, Macmillan carried out the rest of his changes after hearing, from Lord Home, that Lloyd had tried in vain to get John Hare, Minister of Labour, to resign in protest. He sacked a third of his Cabinet in a brutal reshuffle which came to be known as the \\"Night of the Long Knives\\". Macmillan later claimed that he had intended to postpone the full reshuffle until the autumn.Dell 1997, p280 Unless one counts Butler's removal in December 1955, Lloyd was the only Chancellor of the postwar era to be sacked outright until Norman Lamont in May 1993. He was replaced by Reginald Maudling, then seen as a potential future Leader of the Conservative Party, and whose remit was to reflate the economy going into the next General Election due by the end of 1964. Lloyd privately thought Macmillan too obsessed with unemployment, risking higher inflation.Thorpe 2010, p. 524-5 Lloyd was seen to have been badly treated. He was cheered to the echo when he reentered the Commons Chamber after his sacking, whereas Macmillan entered in silence from his own party and jeers from the Opposition, and was subjected to public criticism (then almost unprecedented) from his predecessor Lord Avon. Nigel Birch, who had resigned along with Chancellor Thorneycroft in 1958, wrote to the newspapers on 14 July 1962: \\"For the second time the Prime Minister has got rid of a Chancellor of the Exchequer who tried to get expenditure under control. Once is more than enough.\\"Thorpe 1989, p345 Having refused the offer of a peerage from Macmillan, on 20 July 1962 Lloyd was appointed a Companion of Honour. His name had been added to the list at the last minute; he would have preferred to decline, thinking it an honour more suited to alumni of the Arts, but was persuaded by friends to accept. In his unpublished memoirs he would later write that he had tried to avoid \\"a bitter resentment against Macmillan\\" for the sake of his peace of mind. Lloyd left his black Labrador, \\"Sambo\\", for whom there was no room in his London flat, behind at Chequers, where he had been living since his divorce. At a meeting of the new Cabinet later that summer, Sambo came sniffing amongst the ministers searching for his master. Macmillan ignored the animal, which was likened by one observer to Banquo's ghost.Thorpe 2010, p. 525 =Out of office= Lloyd did not regard his political career as over, and declined the chairmanship of Martins Bank and other City posts. Macmillan, shaken by the hostile reaction to his moves, arranged a meeting with Lloyd on 1 August. He told him that sacking him had been a mistake and that he was looking for a way to bring him back. Lloyd attributed this to Macmillan's ruthlessness and survival instinct.Thorpe 2010, p525 Lloyd became a popular figure with Conservative Party members after travelling the country in the bitter winter of 1962-3 (the worst since 1946-7) to write his report on party organisation.Thorpe 2010, p. 564 Ferdinand Mount writes that northerners recognised Selwyn as \\"one of their own, someone who had gone to London but had not become in the least stuck up and who never pretended to be someone he wasn't\\".Mount 2009, p255 Macmillan later compared Lloyd to Augustine Birrell for his links to the nonconformist vote of North West England.Thorpe 2010, p.xiv At Huddersfield he had to give a non-committal reply when Andrew Alexander, then City Editor of The Yorkshire Post, attacked Macmillan's profligate economic policy.Mount 2009, p253 His report, urging the proper provision of paid agents in marginal seats, was published in June 1963 so was overshadowed by the Profumo scandal. Lloyd asked John Profumo whether he had had an affair with Christine Keeler, and passed on his denial to Macmillan, adding his own opinion that he did not see how \\"Jack\\" could have had the time.Davenport-Hines 2013, p269Mount 2009, p258 After Macmillan's impending resignation was announced in October 1963, Lloyd was one of those who pressed Alec Douglas-Home to stand for the party leadership. He was a pivotal figure in whipping up support for Home as a potential successor at the Blackpool Conference. He was also an influential figure with the Chief Whip Martin Redmayne. On a walk on the seafront at Blackpool (11 October) Lloyd and Redmayne were accosted by a socialist old age pensioner who told them that Home would make the best Prime Minister. He helped to dissuade Hailsham, who was initially a candidate for the leadership, from openly opposing Home. \\"Home was just about the only front-line politician [Lloyd] spoke of without a tinge of contempt.\\"Mount 2009, p261 Lloyd visited Macmillan in hospital on Wednesday 16 October, and advised against appointing Rab Butler, who, he said, was disliked in the constituency associations.Thorpe 2010, p. 572 =Return to the front bench= Lloyd was called back to the government in 1963 by Alec Douglas-Home. He refused the Home Office. He also refused the Chairmanship of the Party, as he felt he had done what he could and did not want to spend \\"another winter traipsing around the country\\". In the end he was appointed Leader of the House of Commons, a job which had already been promised to John Boyd-Carpenter.Thorpe 1989, p381-2 He was also appointed Lord Privy Seal. On returning to office he likened himself to a man who had won a lawsuit for wrongful dismissal.Thorpe 1989, p384 As Leader of the House he was popular and well-respected across parties, paving the way for his Speakership nearly a decade later. However, Lloyd's policies as chancellor were blamed to some extent for Conservative defeat in the general election of 1964.Dell 1997, p281 Lloyd helped to discourage Thorneycroft from standing for the Conservative leadership in 1965. He supported Maudling, who was defeated by Edward Heath.Thorpe 1989, p395 As Shadow Commonwealth Secretary under Heath, Lloyd visited Australia and New Zealand in late 1965. He also visited Rhodesia, whose white minority regime had recently declared unilateral independence from the UK, in February 1966. There he met 300 people, including 60 Africans, and impressed on Prime Minister Ian Smith that white minority rule could not last. On his return to the UK (in time for the general election campaign in March), Lloyd was attacked both by the left for having seemed to condone the Smith regime and from the right for not having supported it. He returned to the backbenches in 1966, at his own request. Speaker of the House of Commons In 1969 Lloyd was captain of the Royal Liverpool Golf Club in its centenary year. Lloyd continued to serve on many committees and to campaign for the Conservative Party in North-West England. In the 1970 General Election organisational reforms made in response to Lloyd's report of 1963 bore fruit, especially in the North-West, and specifically the provision of more paid agents. The reforms were thought to have resulted in the gain of 10 seats, contributing to Heath's narrow victory. Lloyd was sounded out for, but declined, the Washington Embassy. In 1971, after the Conservatives had returned to power, Lloyd became Speaker. He was elected Speaker by 294 votes to 55, the opposition coming from those who thought the election was a stitch- up between the leadership of the two main parties. Mindful that the long hours required as Speaker had broken the health of several of his predecessors, he increased the number of deputy speakers to three to ease the burden. His preference was to let as many members as possible be heard, rather than err on the side of firmness, and he also practised what Thorpe describes as \\"selective deafness\\" rather than punish every unparliamentary outburst. During tedious debates he would keep alert by constructing mental anagrams of the names of those speaking.Thorpe 1989, p440 In the Parliamentary debate on Bloody Sunday, Lloyd refused to allow the MP for Mid-Ulster Bernadette Devlin to give her account or to ask questions of the Secretary of State, despite Devlin having been an eyewitness to events.Hansard - NORTHERN IRELAND HC Deb 31 January 1972 vol 830 cc32-43 While he was Speaker, he became Deputy High Steward of Cambridge University in 1971, and was appointed to be a Deputy Lieutenant of Merseyside in 1974. In a break with convention, both the Labour and Liberal Parties contested his seat in both the February 1974 and October 1974 general elections, but he retained it. He retired as Speaker on 3 February 1976, when he was raised to the peerage and appointed to be the Steward of the Manor of Northstead. Peerage and later life On 8 March 1976 Lloyd was created a life peer as Baron Selwyn-Lloyd, of Wirral in the County of Merseyside. He sat as a crossbencher. He became an honorary fellow of his old college, Magdalene. In retirement he lived at Preston Crowmarsh, Oxfordshire. He did a great deal of charity work and was an active patron and generous host to the nearby Oxford University Conservative Association. He died at home of a brain tumour on 17 May 1978. His will was valued at ¬£154,169 for probate (around ¬£750,000 at 2016 prices). Books Lloyd remained on very friendly terms with Eden, and the two men cooperated throughout the 1960s and 1970s, over Eden's memoirs and information which they gave, often anonymously, to historians about Suez. In public they maintained the pretence that there had been no collusion with Israel.Thorpe 1989, pp210, 259-62 Lloyd cooperated in secret with Terence Robinson's 1965 book on Suez and with Hugh Thomas' The Suez Affair (1967). Lloyd insisted to Hugh Thomas (1967) that Britain's priority had always been a peaceful resolution, especially as Britain had only just pulled out of Egypt prior to Suez. Richard Crossman told Hugh Thomas that any attempt to impeach Lloyd would come to nothing because Lloyd was personally popular. Thomas, who was married to Gladwyn Jebb's daughter, began with little sympathy for Eden and Lloyd and came to feel more so, especially as Lloyd told him that Suez was an issue that was simply not black and white.Thorpe 1989, p259-62 Nutting (No End of a Lesson: 1967) and Harold Macmillan (whose relevant volume came out in 1971) were also publishing memoirs. Nutting accused Lloyd not of lying but of not telling the whole truth to the House of Commons. Lloyd insisted that this was perfectly legitimate and that this had been the view of Edward Grey and Ernest Bevin. Nutting's book made Lloyd more determined to release his own memoirs in due course.Thorpe 1989, p264-5 Lloyd wrote two books, \\"Mr Speaker, sir\\" (1976) and \\"Suez 1956: a Personal View\\" (1978). Suez 1956 was the first British admission that the Sevres meeting had taken place (it had already been disclosed by Dayan and Pineau). Sir Donald Logan had to help finish the research as Lloyd by then was ill and could not concentrate for longer than ten or fifteen minutes at a time. He insisted that there had been no \\"collusion\\" as Britain had acted in good faith, and had not instigated the Israeli attack. Nigel Nicolson thought the book \\"pathetic\\".Thorpe 1989, p265-6 Lloyd did not live to complete his memoirs, which he had planned to call \\"A Middle-Class Lawyer from Liverpool\\" after a famous sneer of Harold Macmillan's at his expense. Personal life Lloyd was respected for his cool and shrewd judgement.Bloch 2015, p.202-4 In public he was \\"a stiff-necked, prickly, rather off-putting figure\\"Mount 2009, p245 and even in private, after his dismissal from the Exchequer \\"he had a ruffled, sad look as though bad news had only just reached him.\\"Mount 2009, p246 However, he could sometimes be a much more gregarious and charismatic man in private than his reserved public image would have suggested. Sir Ferdinand Mount, 3rd Bt., wrote that he possessed \\"an exact appreciation of himself\\". \\"He was proud of the things he was patronised for\\" (being called \\"the Little Attorney\\" by Macmillan, or \\"Mr Hoylake UDC\\" by Bernard Levin). In politics, he was loyal to his (self-proclaimed) social superiors who often did not display loyalty in return.Mount 2009, p248-9 Lloyd married his secretary Elizabeth Marshall, known as Bae, daughter of Roland Marshall of West Kirby, a family friend.Thorpe 1989, p148 Lloyd, who still lived with his parents when in the Wirral, and who had never had a serious girlfriend, was uneasy with women.Mount 2009, p246-8 Pamela Berry claimed that Selwyn had told her that he did not much care for sex. He wrote to his parents (November 1950) that \\"the fatal announcement\\" of their engagement had been made and that he felt like somebody shivering before getting into a cold bath. The marriage took place on the Wirral on 29 March 1951.Marriage registered in the Wirral Registration District in the first quarter of 1951. Lloyd was 46 whilst Bae, a solicitor by profession, was born in 1928, making her 24 years his junior. At the reception somebody told him that he had a beautiful bride, and he responded that he had a beautiful wedding cake too. Lloyd's younger sister Rachel, and Bae's mother, both had misgivings about the marriage. Selwyn and Bae had a daughter, Joanna, but divorced in 1957.D R Thorpe: Lloyd, (John) Selwyn Brooke, Baron Selwyn- Lloyd (1904‚Äì1978), Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2011 accessed 13 Sept 2012The Times (Thursday, 18 May 1978), p. 21. At the time of Suez Bae had been in a bad car crash with her lover, whom she later married.Mount 2009, p250 Lloyd was awarded custody of his daughter. He remained on friendly terms with his wife after his divorce,Thorpe 1989, p206 but seldom spoke of her to others, so much so that Ferdinand Mount records that he had no idea how her name was pronounced. Rab Butler quipped that Selwyn's wife had left him \\"because he got into bed with his sweater on\\".Sandford 2005, pp.78 After his divorce he was a lonely man and was sometimes known to try to persuade less than keen civil servants to accompany him to the cinema on Saturday afternoons when the week's work was done.Thorpe 1989, p276 After his divorce, rumour sometimes circulated that Lloyd had homosexual inclinations. He entertained young servicemen at Chequers. Sir Ferdinand Mount writes that he was clearly attracted to the young Jonathan Aitken (his godson, who also worked for him in the early 1960s) but showed no interest in Diana Leishman, an attractive young woman who also worked for him.Mount 2009, p247 Michael Bloch writes that he was \\"infatuated with\\" Aitken who \\"had some difficulty parrying his advances\\" and with the young Peter Walker. The actor Anthony Booth (in his book \\"Stroll On\\" (1989)) claimed that he had been accosted on the Mall by a clearly drunk Selwyn Lloyd, who made a pass at him under the pretext of asking for a light for his cigarette, a recognised courtship ritual among gay men at the time, inviting him back to Admiralty House (which was Lloyd's official residence in 1963-4). Ferdinand Mount comments that such behaviour as alleged by Booth would have been out of character, but adds carefully that \\"It is not clear whether [Lloyd] was ever gay in the active sense\\".Mount 2009, p248 Charles Williams writes that Lloyd \\"had a dubious private life\\" and that his \\"private life was the subject of much gossip\\" but offers no further details.Williams 2010, p279, p325 Assessment Lloyd's obituaries concentrated on his role in Suez. He would have preferred to have been remembered for his minority report on the Beveridge Report on broadcasting, and for setting up the NEDC.Thorpe 1989, p258 Nigel Nicolson thought him \\"weak and mendacious\\" over Suez and recorded that Dag Hammarskj√∂ld regarded him with contempt. However, he acquired a higher reputation as Macmillan's Foreign Secretary. Sir William Hayter, who worked with Lloyd in Ankara during the Baghdad Pact conference in January 1958, commented on how he had a higher regard for Lloyd after the latter had ceased to be Eden's assistant. \\"I liked him and even respected him and ... he was really a very able Minister\\". Thorpe argues that he was not quite in the same league as Bevin or Eden but very much in the next rung.Thorpe 1989, p306 He was happy to listen to expert advice in a way that Eden would not have been. Edmund Dell describes Lloyd as \\"not up to the job\\" of chancellor.Dell 1997, p282 He was \\"a man with limited intellectual horizons ... fortunate to occupy two of the highest offices in the state. He was less fortunate in the timing [Foreign Secretary during Suez then Chancellor at a time of relative economic decline] ‚Ä¶ there is no evidence that he understood economic arguments ‚Ä¶ he was a man tied to his brief, lacking the conviction or understanding to make an independent contribution\\".Dell 1997, p258 However, the real problems with the British economy at this time were, in Dell's view, short-termism (longer time was needed to get results) and an overvalued exchange rate.Dell 1997, p268 The immediate cause for Lloyd's dismissal was that Macmillan saw the Treasury as obstructive in drawing up a workable incomes policy, but Dell argues that the real problem was lack of political will, by Macmillan and other ministers, to enforce compulsory wage control. Macmillan wanted the \\"open air cure\\" (i.e. public moral pressure to discourage inflationary wage rises), so it is hard to see how Lloyd could have urged anything stronger. A National Incomes Commission (\\"Nicky\\") was eventually set up 26 July 1962, after Lloyd's dismissal. It was boycotted by the TUC, who claimed to have been inadequately consulted. It had no compulsory powers, but only powers to demand papers and interview people, and make criticisms of wage settlements which were deemed not in the national interest. Only three cases were ever referred to it. Ferdinand Mount argues that Lloyd's obituary in The Times was wrong to call him unimaginative and that Lloyd was in fact an innovative chancellor. Macmillan, obsessed with economic expansion, constantly belittled Lloyd in his memoirs. In Mount's view, just as Suez was a watershed in foreign policy, so Macmillan's sacking of Lloyd was a watershed in economic policy, opening the way to the inflation of the 1970s.Mount 2009, p262-3 Lloyd would sometimes later claim that he might have become Prime Minister if he had resigned as Foreign Secretary over Suez or if he had made more fuss over his sacking as Chancellor. His biographer D.R. Thorpe dismisses this as \\"wishful thinking\\", arguing that Lloyd was not even in the same league as Joseph Chamberlain or Rab Butler, politicians who were - in different ways - of first-rank importance despite not becoming Prime Minister. Rather, he was \\"more Exeter rather than Balliol\\", i.e. a respectable middle-ranking Oxford college, rather than a prestigious one.Thorpe 1989, p443 Arms  References  Further reading  * covers his term as Chancellor. , essay on Selwyn Lloyd written by D.R.Thorpe * (Mount worked for Lloyd as a young man in the early 1960s)  Watry, David M.

The ballet was composed in 1916‚Äì17 for Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes. The ballet premiered on Friday, May 18, 1917 at the Th√©√¢tre du Ch√¢telet in Paris, with costumes and sets designed by Pablo Picasso, choreography by L√©onide Massine (who danced), and the orchestra conducted by Ernest Ansermet. Overview The idea of the ballet seems to have come from Jean Cocteau. He had heard Satie's Trois morceaux en forme de poire (\\"Three Pieces in the Shape of a Pear\\") in a concert and thought of writing a ballet scenario to such music. Satie welcomed the idea of composing ballet music (which he had never done before) but refused to allow any of his previous compositions to be used for the occasion, so Cocteau started writing a scenario (the theme being a publicity parade in which three groups of circus artists try to attract an audience to an indoor performance), to which Satie composed the music (with some additions to the orchestral score by Cocteau). Work on the production started in the middle of the First World War, with Cocteau traveling back and forth to the war front in Belgium until shortly before the premiere. The most difficult part of the creative process, however, seems to have been to convince Misia Edwards to support the idea of having this ballet performed by the Ballets Russes. She was easily offended but was trusted completely by Sergei Diaghilev for advice on his productions. A first version of the music (for piano) was dedicated to Misia and performed in 1916. Eventually, after aborting some other plans (and some more intrigue), Diaghilev's support was won, and the choreography was entrusted to L√©onide Massine, who had recently become the principal dancer of the Ballets Russes and lover of Diaghilev, replacing Vaslav Nijinsky who had left Paris shortly before the outbreak of the war. The set and costume design was entrusted to the then-Cubist painter Pablo Picasso. In addition to the costume designs, Picasso also designed a curtain which illustrated a group of performers at a fair consuming dinner before a performance. The Italian futurist artist Giacomo Balla aided Picasso in his creating the curtain and other designs for Parade. In February 1917, all the collaborators, excluding Satie, met in Rome to begin working on Parade, scheduled to premiere in May. Costume design by Pablo Picasso for Serge Diaghilev's Ballets Russes performance of Parade at Th√©√¢tre du Ch√¢telet in Paris 18 May 1917 A large curtain for the play painted by Pablo Picasso The poet Guillaume Apollinaire described Parade as \\"a kind of surrealism\\" (une sorte de surr√©alisme) when he wrote the program note in 1917, thus coining the word three years before Surrealism emerged as an art movement in Paris. The English premiere of Parade, performed by Ballet Russes, was performed at London's Empire Theatre in November 14, 1919 and became a cultural event. (Hargrove, 1998) The ballet was remarkable for several reasons: * It was the first collaboration between Satie and Picasso, and also the first time either of them had worked on a ballet, thus making it the first time either collaborated with Diaghilev and the Ballets Russes. * The plot of Parade incorporated and was inspired by popular entertainments of the period, such as Parisian music-halls and American silent-films. * Much of the settings used in Parade's plot occurred outside of the formal Parisian theater, depicting the streets of Paris. * The plot reproduces various elements of everyday life such as the music hall and fairground. Before Parade, the use of popular entertainment materials was considered unsuitable for the elite world of the ballet. * The plot of Parade composed by Cocteau includes the failed attempt of a troupe of performers to attract audience members to view their show. * Some of Picasso's Cubist costumes were in solid cardboard, allowing the dancers only a minimum of movement. * The score contained several \\"noise- making\\" instruments (typewriter, foghorn, an assortment of milk bottles, pistol, and so on), which had been added by Cocteau (somewhat to the dismay of Satie). It is supposed that such additions by Cocteau showed his eagerness to create a succ√®s de scandale, comparable to that of Igor Stravinsky's Le Sacre du Printemps which had been premiered by the Ballets Russes some years before. Although Parade was quite revolutionary, bringing common street entertainments to the elite, being scorned by audiences and being praised by critics, nonetheless many years later Stravinsky could still pride himself in never having been topped in the matter of succ√®s de scandale. * The ragtime contained in Parade would later be adapted for piano solo and attained considerable success as a separate piano piece. The finale is \\"a rapid ragtime dance in which the whole cast [makes] a last desperate attempt to lure the audience in to see their show\\". The premiere of the ballet resulted in a number of scandals. One faction of the audience booed, hissed, and was very unruly, nearly causing a riot before they were drowned out by enthusiastic applause.Peterkin, Norman. \\"Erik Satie's 'Parade'\\", The Musical Times, Vol. 60, No. 918 (Aug. 1, 1919), 426. Many of their objections were focused on Picasso's cubist design, which was met with cries of \\"sales boche.\\"Davis, Mary E. \\"Modernity a la mode: Popular Culture and Avant-Gardism in Erik Satie s Sports et divertissements\\", Musical Quarterly (1999) 83 (3): 465. According to the painter Gabriel Fournier, one of the most memorable scandals was an altercation between Cocteau, Satie, and music critic Jean Poueigh, who gave Parade an unfavorable review. Satie had written a postcard to the critic which read, \\"Monsieur et cher ami ‚Äì vous √™tes un cul, un cul sans musique! Sign√© Erik Satie\\" (\\"Sir and dear friend ‚Äì you are an arse, an arse without music! Signed, Erik Satie.\\"). The critic sued Satie, and at the trial, Cocteau was arrested and beaten by police for repeatedly yelling \\"arse\\" in the courtroom. Satie was given a sentence of eight days in jail.Austin, William W. Music in the 20th Century. New York. W. W. Norton, 1966.

History The rebellion reflected the widespread discontent felt among both pro-imperial and anti-foreigner groups, who rebelled under the sonn≈ç j≈çi (\\"revere the emperor, expell the barbarians\\") slogan. Emperor K≈çmei had issued an \\"Order to expel barbarians\\". Thus, in March 1863, the shishi rebels sought to take control of the Emperor to restore the Imperial household to its position of political supremacy. During what was a bloody crushing of the rebellion, the leading Ch≈çsh≈´ clan was held responsible for its instigation. To counter the rebels' kidnapping attempt, armies of the Aizu and Satsuma domains (the latter led by Saigo TakamoriNagasawa Takaaki, The Life of Japan‚Äôs ‚ÄúLast Samurai‚Äù: Saig≈ç Takamori) at Nippon.com, accessed 18 June 2020) led the defense of the Imperial palace. However, during the attempt, the rebels put Kyoto on fire, starting with the residence of the Takatsukasa family, and that of a Ch≈çsh≈´ official. It is unknown if the rebels set fire to Kyoto as soon as they began to lose, or if their doing so was part of their original strategy, and done as a diversionary tactic. Among the shishi who died in the incident include Kusaka Genzui. Various courtiers, including Nakayama Tadayasu, the Emperor's Special Consultant for National Affairs, were banished from Court as a result of their involvement in this incident.Takeda Hideaki, Nakayama Tadayasu (1809‚Äì88) at kokugakuin.ac, accessed 24 September 2013 The shogunate followed the incident with a retaliatory armed expedition, the First Ch≈çsh≈´ expedition, in September 1864.

Life Family home in Elvaston, Derbyshire, late 19th century William Stanhope was born in 1683 at the family home in Elvaston, Derbyshire, third surviving son of John Stanhope and Dorothy Agard. His elder brother Charles Stanhope (1673‚Äì1760) was also a politician and deeply involved in the South Sea Company financial scandal, while his cousin James Stanhope (1673‚Äì1721) is considered an alternative candidate to Robert Walpole for the title of Britain's first Prime Minister. He married Anne Griffiths, who died in 1719 giving birth to twin sons, William, 2nd Earl of Harrington (1719‚Äì1779) and Thomas (1719‚Äì1743). Career Educated at Eton College, Stanhope was commissioned in 1703 as a Lieutenant in the 2nd Foot Guards during the War of the Spanish Succession, before transferring to the 3rd Foot Guards in Spain. By 1710, he was a Lieutenant-Colonel and missed the December 1710 Battle of Brihuega, when the British rearguard under his cousin James Stanhope was cut off and forced to surrender. In March 1711, he became Colonel of the former Lepells Regiment, which was disbanded in November 1712 as the army was cut back in the run-up to the 1713 Peace of Utrecht. Stanhope was serving as a diplomat in Spain when the War of the Quadruple Alliance began in 1719 and joined the French army under the Duke of Berwick as a volunteer.Adjutant General's Office, p. 84 When the war ended in 1720, Stanhope was appointed British ambassador to Spain and given the Colonelcy of the 13th Light Dragoons, later 13th Hussars; he retained this position until the Anglo-Spanish War began in March 1727, having built up his reputation as a diplomatist during a difficult period. William Stanhope, 1st Earl of Harrington As a reward for his part in negotiating the 1729 Treaty of Seville that ended the war, he was created Baron Harrington in January 1730. Later the same year, he replaced Lord Townshend as Secretary of State for the Northern Department under Robert Walpole. Despite policy differences over British involvement in the 1734‚Äì1735 war, he kept his position until Walpole's fall in 1742, when he became Lord President of the Council and created Earl of Harrington and Viscount Petersham. With the support of his political ally the Duke of Newcastle, he was restored as Secretary of State in 1744 but resigned in February 1746 over his preference for an immediate end to the 1740‚Äì1748 War of the Austrian Succession. He was made Lord Lieutenant of Ireland from 1747 to 1751 and while his active military career finished in 1720, he received a number of promotions, ending a full General in 1747. He died in London on 8 December 1756.

It is the capital of the Butnan District (formerly Tobruk District) and has a population of 120,000 (2011 est.).\\"Tobruk\\" (history), Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 2006, Britannica Concise Encyclopedia, Concise.Britannica.com BC-Tobruk . Tobruk was the site of an ancient Greek colony and, later, of a Roman fortress guarding the frontier of Cyrenaica. Over the centuries, Tobruk also served as a waystation along the coastal caravan route. By 1911, Tobruk had become an Italian military post, but during World War II, Allied forces, mainly the Australian 6th Division, took Tobruk on 22 January 1941. The Australian 9th Division (\\"The Rats of Tobruk\\") pulled back to Tobruk to avoid encirclement after actions at Er Regima and Mechili and reached Tobruk on 9 April 1941 where prolonged fighting against German and Italian forces followed. Although the siege was lifted by Operation Crusader in November 1941, a renewed offensive by Axis forces under Erwin Rommel the following year resulted in Tobruk being captured in June 1942 and held by the Axis forces until November 1942, when it was recaptured by the Allies. Rebuilt after World War II, Tobruk was later expanded during the 1960s to include a port terminal linked by an oil pipeline to the Sarir oil field. King Idris of Libya had his palace at Bab Zaytun. Tobruk was traditionally a stronghold of the Senussi royal dynasty and one of the first to rebel against Colonel Gaddafi in the Arab Spring.  Geography  An aerial image of Tobruk's harbour. Tobruk has a strong, naturally protected deep harbour. It is probably the best natural port in northern Africa, although due to the lack of important nearby land sites it is certainly not the most popular. The city is effectively surrounded by a desert lightly populated with nomadic herdsmen who travel from oasis to oasis. There are many escarpments (cliffs) to the south of Tobruk (and indeed in all of Cyrenaica, the eastern half of Libya). These escarpments generally have their high sides to the south and their low sides (dip slopes) to the north. This constitutes a substantial physical barrier between the north and south of Libya in the Tobruk area. Previously, Tobruk was some from Benghazi through the Libyan Coastal Highway, but this distance was shortened to after the construction of the Charruba‚ÄìTimimi Road between the years 1975 and 1985. Construction of the Tobruk‚ÄìAjdabiya Road reduced the distance between those two cities from to about . Because it is approximately away from Egypt by land, Tobruk is also an important hub for merchants from both Egypt and Libya, and for travellers between the two countries as well as those from Bayda and Derna. However, Tobruk suffers a serious saltwater intrusion problem. A factory for the desalination of sea water has been built there.  Climate  Tobruk features a hot desert climate (BWh according to the K√∂ppen climate classification.) History =Antiquity= An Ancient Greek agricultural colony, Antipyrgus () was once on the site of modern Tobruk, and the ancient name is still occasionally in use. The name roughly meant \\"across from Pyrgos\\", referring to a location in Crete across the Mediterranean Sea from Antipyrgos. In the Roman era, the town became a Roman fortress guarding the Cyrenaican frontier. With the spread of Christianity, Antipyrgus became an episcopal see. Only one of its ancient bishops is known by name: Aemilianus, who took part in the Second Council of Constantinople in 553.Michel Lequien, Oriens christianus in quatuor Patriarchatus digestus , Paris 1740, Vol. II, coll. 633-634 No longer a residential bishopric, Antipyrgus is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.Annuario Pontificio 2013 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 ), p. 834 Later the site became a way station on the caravan route that ran along the coast. =Modern history= The Hotel Tobruk was built in 1937. World War II At the beginning of World War II, Libya was an Italian colony and Tobruk became the site of important battles between the Allies and Axis powers. Tobruk was strategically important to the conquest of Eastern Libya, then the province of Cyrenaica, for several reasons. =Strategic importance= The Battle of Gazala in May 1942, which was fought in the vicinity of Tobruk Tobruk had a deep, natural, and protected harbour, which meant that even if the port were bombed, ships would still be able to anchor there and be safe from squalls, so the port could never be rendered wholly useless regardless of military bombardment. This was of critical importance, as it made Tobruk an excellent place to supply a desert warfare campaign. It was also heavily fortified by the Italians prior to their invasion of Egypt in November 1940. In addition to these prepared fortifications, there were a number of escarpments and cliffs to the south of Tobruk, providing substantial physical barriers to any advance on the port over land. Tobruk was also on a peninsula, allowing it to be defended by a minimal number of troops, which the Allies used to their advantage when the port was under siege. An attacker could not simply bypass the defenders, for if they did, the besieged would sally forth and cut off the nearby supply lines of the attacker, spoiling their advance. But Tobruk was also strategically significant, due to its location with regard to the remainder of Cyrenaica. Attackers from the east who had secured Tobruk could then advance through the desert to Benghazi, cutting off all enemy troops along the coast, such as those at Derna. This advance would be protected from counterattack, due to escarpments that were quite difficult for a military force to climb, running generally from Tobruk to Suluq. Due to the importance of maintaining supply in the desert, getting cut off in this area was disastrous. Therefore, whoever held both Suluq and Tobruk controlled the majority of Cyrenaica. Finally, south of the port was the largest airfield in eastern Libya. This was significant due to the importance of air power in desert warfare. =Italian advance= Italian forces (and their native Libyan allies‚Äîabout two divisions of the latter) invaded Egypt in early September 1940 but halted their advance after a week and dug in at Sidi Barrani. In early December, British Empire forces‚Äîan armoured division and two infantry divisions‚Äîlaunched a counterstrike codenamed Operation Compass. The Italians had previously invaded Albania and occupied part of the south of France, and had now made a military incursion into a British protectorate. =British capture of Tobruk= The counterstrike involved the British pocketing two of the Italian camps against the Mediterranean, forcing their surrender. This led to a general Italian retreat to El Agheila. Tobruk was captured by British, Australian and Indian forces on 22 January 1941. Italy called on her German ally, which sent an army corps, under the name Deutsches Afrika Korps (DAK). Italy also sent several more divisions to Libya. These forces, under Lieutenant-General Erwin Rommel, drove the Allies back across Cyrenaica to the Egyptian border, leaving Tobruk isolated and under siege. The defenders of the fortress consisted of the Australian 9th Division, the Australian 18th Brigade and some British tanks and artillery. They were later reinforced and replaced by the British 70th Infantry Division, Polish Independent Carpathian Rifle Brigade, a Czechoslovak battalion and a British tank brigade. The siege lasted until December, when Operation Crusader pushed the DAK and Italians back out of Cyrenaica. =German capture of Tobruk= Rommel's second offensive took place in May and June 1942. Tobruk was taken in an outflanking attack on 21 June 1942, capturing the largest number of British Commonwealth troops after the fall of Singapore earlier in the year, where over 80,000 were captured. Rommel was promoted to Generalfeldmarschall, shortly thereafter and was the youngest in the Wehrmacht Heer to achieve this rank. The following units were deployed in Tobruk on 20 June 1942, and most of them were captured by the Axis forces: Appendix C * 2nd South African Infantry Division * 4th Royal Tank Regiment * 7th Royal Tank Regiment * 3rd Battalion, Coldstream Guards * 1st Battalion, Sherwood Foresters * 1st Battalion, Worcestershire Regiment * 2nd Battalion, Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders * 2nd Battalion, 5th Mahratta Light Infantry * 2nd Battalion, 7th Gurkha Rifles * 67 Medium Regiment, Royal Artillery * 68 Medium Regiment, Royal Artillery * 25th Field Regiment, Royal Artillery =British recapture= Tobruk remained in Axis hands until 11 November 1942, when the Allies captured it after the Second Battle of El Alamein. It remained in Allied hands thereafter. Although not as much a reason for its strategic significance, the British built a rail line from El Alamein to Tobruk during the course of the war. This rail line was significant both for purposes of supply and as a sense of pride to the Allied troops, as the rail line was built through a little-populated, inhospitable desert. Libyan Civil Wars At the outset of the 2011 Libyan Civil War, the city quickly came under the control of the NTC. In September 2014 the internationally recognized government of Libya relocated to a Greek car ferry in Tobruk harbor. A rival New General National Congress parliament continued to operate in Tripoli. In October 2014 they again re- located, to a hotel named Dar al-Salam also known as the Al Masira Hotel in Tobruk. In November 2014 that government was declared illegal by Libya's highest court.

Blood is normally a sterile environment, so that the detection of microbes in the blood (most commonly accomplished by blood cultures) is always abnormal. A bloodstream infection is different from sepsis, which is the host response to bacteria. Bacteria can enter the bloodstream as a severe complication of infections (like pneumonia or meningitis), during surgery (especially when involving mucous membranes such as the gastrointestinal tract), or due to catheters and other foreign bodies entering the arteries or veins (including during intravenous drug abuse). Transient bacteremia can result after dental procedures or brushing of teeth. Bacteremia can have several important health consequences. The immune response to the bacteria can cause sepsis and septic shock, which has a high mortality rate. Bacteria can also spread via the blood to other parts of the body (which is called hematogenous spread), causing infections away from the original site of infection, such as endocarditis or osteomyelitis. Treatment for bacteremia is with antibiotics, and prevention with antibiotic prophylaxis can be given in high risk situations. Presentation Bacteremia is typically transient and is quickly removed from the blood by the immune system. Bacteremia frequently evokes a response from the immune system called Sepsis, which consists of symptoms such as fever, chills, and hypotension. Severe immune responses to bacteremia may result in septic shock and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, which are potentially fatal. Causes Bacteria can enter the bloodstream in a number of different ways. However, for each major classification of bacteria (gram negative, gram positive, or anaerobic) there are characteristic sources or routes of entry into the bloodstream that lead to bacteremia. Causes of bacteremia can additionally be divided into healthcare-associated (acquired during the process of receiving care in a healthcare facility) or community-acquired (acquired outside of a health facility, often prior to hospitalization). = Gram positive bacteremia = Gram positive bacteria are an increasingly important cause of bacteremia. Staphylococcus, streptococcus, and enterococcus species are the most important and most common species of gram-positive bacteria that can enter the bloodstream. These bacteria are normally found on the skin or in the gastrointestinal tract. Staphylococcus aureus is the most common cause of healthcare-associated bacteremia in North and South America and is also an important cause of community-acquired bacteremia. Skin ulceration or wounds, respiratory tract infections, and IV drug use are the most important causes of community-acquired staph aureus bacteremia. In healthcare settings, intravenous catheters, urinary tract catheters, and surgical procedures are the most common causes of staph aureus bacteremia. There are many different types of streptococcal species that can cause bacteremia. Group A streptococcus (GAS) typically causes bacteremia from skin and soft tissue infections. Group B streptococcus is an important cause of bacteremia in neonates, often immediately following birth. Viridans streptococci species are normal bacterial flora of the mouth. Viridans strep can cause temporary bacteremia after eating, toothbrushing, or flossing. More severe bacteremia can occur following dental procedures or in patients receiving chemotherapy. Finally, streptococcus bovis is a common cause of bacteremia in patients with colon cancer. Enterococci are an important cause of healthcare-associated bacteremia. These bacteria commonly live in the gastrointestinal tract and female genital tract. Intravenous catheters, urinary tract infections and surgical wounds are all risk factors for developing bacteremia from enterococcal species. Resistant enterococcal species can cause bacteremia in patients who have had long hospital stays or frequent antibiotic use in the past. = Gram negative bacteremia = Gram negative bacterial species are responsible for approximately 24% of all cases of healthcare-associated bacteremia and 45% of all cases of community-acquired bacteremia. In general, gram negative bacteria enter the bloodstream from infections in the respiratory tract, genitourinary tract, gastrointestinal tract, or hepatobiliary system. Gram-negative bacteremia occurs more frequently in elderly populations (65 years or older) and is associated with higher morbidity and mortality in this population. E.coli is the most common cause of community-acquired bacteremia accounting for approximately 75% of cases. E.coli bacteremia is usually the result of a urinary tract infection. Other organisms that can cause community-acquired bacteremia include Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis. Salmonella infection, despite mainly only resulting in gastroenteritis in the developed world, is a common cause of bacteremia in Africa. It principally affects children who lack antibodies to Salmonella and HIV+ patients of all ages. Among healthcare-associated cases of bacteremia, gram negative organisms are an important cause of bacteremia in the ICU. Catheters in the veins, arteries, or urinary tract can all create a way for gram negative bacteria to enter the bloodstream. Surgical procedures of the genitourinary tract, intestinal tract, or hepatobiliary tract can also lead to gram negative bacteremia. Pseudomonas and Enterobacter species are the most important causes of gram negative bacteremia in the ICU. = Bacteremia risk factors = There are several risk factors that increase the likelihood of developing bacteremia from any type of bacteria. These include: * HIV infection * Diabetes Mellitus * Chronic hemodialysis * Solid organ transplant * Stem cell transplant * Treatment with glucocorticoids * Liver failure * Asplenia Mechanism Bacteremia can travel through the blood stream to distant sites in the body and cause infection (hematogenous spread). Hematogenous spread of bacteria is part of the pathophysiology of certain infections of the heart (endocarditis), structures around the brain (meningitis), and tuberculosis of the spine (Pott's disease). Hematogenous spread of bacteria is responsible for many bone infections (osteomyelitis). Prosthetic cardiac implants (for example artificial heart valves) are especially vulnerable to infection from bacteremia. Prior to widespread use of vaccines, occult bacteremia was an important consideration in febrile children that appeared otherwise well. Diagnosis Bacteremia is most commonly diagnosed by blood culture, in which a sample of blood drawn from the vein by needle puncture is allowed to incubate with a medium that promotes bacterial growth. If bacteria are present in the bloodstream at the time the sample is obtained, the bacteria will multiply and can thereby be detected. Any bacteria that incidentally find their way to the culture medium will also multiply. For example, if the skin is not adequately cleaned before needle puncture, contamination of the blood sample with normal bacteria that live on the surface of the skin can occur. For this reason, blood cultures must be drawn with great attention to sterile process. The presence of certain bacteria in the blood culture, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli almost never represent a contamination of the sample. On the other hand, contamination may be more highly suspected if organisms like Staphylococcus epidermidis or Cutibacterium acnes grow in the blood culture. Two blood cultures drawn from separate sites of the body are often sufficient to diagnose bacteremia. Two out of two cultures growing the same type of bacteria usually represents a real bacteremia, particularly if the organism that grows is not a common contaminant. One out of two positive cultures will usually prompt a repeat set of blood cultures to be drawn to confirm whether a contaminant or a real bacteremia is present. The patient's skin is typically cleaned with an alcohol-based product prior to drawing blood to prevent contamination. Blood cultures may be repeated at intervals to determine if persistent -- rather than transient -- bacteremia is present. Prior to drawing blood cultures, a thorough patient history should be taken with particular regard to presence of both fevers and chills, other focal signs of infection such as in the skin or soft tissue, a state of immunosuppression, or any recent invasive procedures. Ultrasound of the heart is recommended in all those with bacteremia due to Staphylococcus aureus to rule out infectious endocarditis. =Definition= Bacteremia is the presence of bacteria in the bloodstream that are alive and capable of reproducing. It is a type of bloodstream infection. Bacteremia is defined as either a primary or secondary process. In primary bacteremia, bacteria have been directly introduced into the bloodstream. Injection drug use may lead to primary bacteremia. In the hospital setting, use of blood vessel catheters contaminated with bacteria may also lead to primary bacteremia. Secondary bacteremia occurs when bacteria have entered the body at another site, such as the cuts in the skin, or the mucous membranes of the lungs (respiratory tract), mouth or intestines (gastrointestinal tract), bladder (urinary tract), or genitals. Bacteria that have infected the body at these sites may then spread into the lymphatic system and gain access to the bloodstream, where further spread can occur. Bacteremia may also be defined by the timing of bacteria presence in the bloodstream: transient, intermittent, or persistent. In transient bacteremia, bacteria are present in the bloodstream for minutes to a few hours before being cleared from the body, and the result is typically harmless in healthy people. This can occur after manipulation of parts of the body normally colonized by bacteria, such as the mucosal surfaces of the mouth during teeth brushing, flossing, or dental procedures, or instrumentation of the bladder or colon. Intermittent bacteremia is characterized by periodic seeding of the same bacteria into the bloodstream by an existing infection elsewhere in the body, such as an abscess, pneumonia, or bone infection, followed by clearing of that bacteria from the bloodstream. This cycle will often repeat until the existing infection is successfully treated. Persistent bacteremia is characterized by the continuous presence of bacteria in the bloodstream. It is usually the result of an infected heart valve, a central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI), an infected blood clot (suppurative thrombophlebitis), or an infected blood vessel graft. Persistent bacteremia can also occur as part of the infection process of typhoid fever, brucellosis, and bacterial meningitis. Left untreated, conditions causing persistent bacteremia can be potentially fatal. Bacteremia is clinically distinct from sepsis, which is a condition where the blood stream infection is associated with an inflammatory response from the body, often causing abnormalities in body temperature, heart rate, breathing rate, blood pressure, and white blood cell count.  Treatment  The presence of bacteria in the blood almost always requires treatment with antibiotics. This is because there are high mortality rates from progression to sepsis if antibiotics are delayed. The treatment of bacteremia should begin with empiric antibiotic coverage. Any patient presenting with signs or symptoms of bacteremia or a positive blood culture should be started on intravenous antibiotics. The choice of antibiotic is determined by the most likely source of infection and by the characteristic organisms that typically cause that infection. Other important considerations include the patient's past history of antibiotic use, the severity of the presenting symptoms, and any allergies to antibiotics. Empiric antibiotics should be narrowed, preferably to a single antibiotic, once the blood culture returns with a particular bacteria that has been isolated. =Gram positive bacteremia = The Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) recommends treating uncomplicated methicillin resistant staph aureus (MRSA) bacteremia with a 14-day course of intravenous vancomycin. Uncomplicated bacteremia is defined as having positive blood cultures for MRSA, but having no evidence of endocarditis, no implanted prostheses, negative blood cultures after 2‚Äì4 days of treatment, and signs of clinical improvement after 72 hrs. The antibiotic treatment of choice for streptococcal and enteroccal infections differs by species. However, it is important to look at the antibiotic resistance pattern for each species from the blood culture to better treat infections caused by resistant organisms. =Gram negative bacteremia = The treatment of gram negative bacteremia is also highly dependent on the causative organism. Empiric antibiotic therapy should be guided by the most likely source of infection and the patient's past exposure to healthcare facilities. In particular, a recent history of exposure to a healthcare setting may necessitate the need for antibiotics with pseudomonas aeruginosa coverage or broader coverage for resistant organisms. Extended generation cephalosporins such as ceftriaxone or beta lactam/beta lactamase inhibitor antibiotics such as piperacillin-tazobactam are frequently used for the treatment of gram negative bacteremia. =Catheter-associated infections = For healthcare-associated bacteremia due to intravenous catheters, the IDSA has published guidelines for catheter removal. Short term catheters (in place <14 days) should be removed if bacteremia is caused by any gram negative bacteria, staph aureus, enterococci or mycobacteria. Long term catheters (>14 days) should be removed if the patient is developing signs or symptoms of sepsis or endocarditis, or if blood cultures remain positive for more than 72 hours.

According to this work, Palmer died following a series of strokes.) was an American author and editor, best known as editor of Amazing Stories from 1938 through 1949, when he left publisher Ziff-Davis to publish and edit Fate Magazine, and eventually many other magazines and books through his own publishing houses, including Amherst Press and Palmer Publications. In addition to magazines such as Mystic, Search, and Flying Saucers, he published or republished numerous spiritualist books, including Oahspe: A New Bible, as well as several books related to flying saucers, including The Coming of the Saucers, co-written by Palmer with Kenneth Arnold. Palmer was also a prolific author of science fiction and fantasy stories, many of which were published under pseudonyms. Personal life According to Bruce Lanier Wright, \\"Palmer was hit by a truck at age seven and suffered a broken back.\\" An unsuccessful operation on Palmer's spine stunted his growth (he stood about four feet tall), and left him with a hunchback. Palmer found refuge in science fiction, which he read voraciously. He rose through the ranks of science fiction fandom and is credited, along with Walter Dennis, with editing the first fanzine, The Comet, in May, 1930. Career Throughout the 1930s, Palmer would have many of his stories published in several science fiction magazines of the era. When Ziff-Davis acquired Amazing Stories in 1938, editor T. O'Conor Sloane resigned and production was moved to Chicago. On the recommendation of popular author Ralph Milne Farley, the editorship was offered to Palmer. In 1939, Palmer began a companion magazine to Amazing Stories titled Fantastic Adventures, which lasted until 1953. When Ziff-Davis moved its magazine production from Chicago to New York City in 1949, Palmer resigned and, with Curtis Fuller, another Ziff-Davis editor who did not want to leave the midwest, founded Clark Publishing Co.Harry Warner, Jr. All Our Yesterdays, pgs 75-78. =Science fiction magazines= Palmer's first issue of Amazing Stories introduced a redesigned logo and the unlikely claim \\"Every Story Scientifically Accurate\\" Other Worlds in 1951 Palmer's novella \\"The Metal Emperor\\", his last story published in an sf magazine, was cover-featured on Imaginative Tales in 1955 As an editor, Palmer tended to favor adventurous, fast-moving space opera-type stories. His tenure at Amazing Stories was notable for his purchase of Isaac Asimov's first professional story, \\"Marooned Off Vesta\\". Palmer was also known for his support of the long-running and controversial Shaver Mystery stories, a series of stories by Richard Sharpe Shaver. Palmer's support of the truth of Shaver's stories (which maintained that the world is dominated by insane inhabitants of the hollow earth), was controversial in the science fiction community. It is unclear whether Palmer believed the Shaver stories to be true, or if he was just using the stories to sell magazines. Palmer asked other writers to do stories in the Shaver genre, the most notable being Rog Phillips. Palmer began his own science fiction publishing ventures while working for Ziff-Davis, eventually leaving the company to form his own publishing house, Clark Publishing Company, which was responsible for the titles Imagination and Other Worlds, among others. None of these magazines achieved the success of Amazing Stories during the Palmer years, but Palmer published Space World magazine until his death. =Paranormality magazines= In 1948, Palmer and Curtis Fuller co-founded Fate, which covered divination methods, Fortean events, belief in the survival of personality after death, predictive dreams, accounts of ghosts, mental telepathy, archaeology, flying saucer sightings, cryptozoology, alternative medicine, warnings of death, and other paranormal topics, many contributed by readers. Curtis Fuller and his wife Mary took full control of Fate in 1955, when Palmer sold his interest in the venture. The magazine has continued in publication under a series of editors and publishers to the present day. Another paranormal magazine Palmer created along the line of Fate was Mystic magazine, which after about two years of publication became Search magazine. In the 1970s, Palmer also published Ray Palmer's News Letter which was combined into another of his publications called Forum in March 1975.Files of astronomer Donald Menzel =Flying Saucers magazine= In the first issue of Fate, Palmer published Kenneth Arnold's report of \\"flying discs.\\" Arnold's sighting marked the beginning of the modern UFO era, and his story propelled the fledgling Fate to national recognition. Through Fate, Palmer was instrumental in popularizing belief in flying saucers. This interest led him to establish the magazine Flying Saucers. =Spiritual publications= Palmer's avid interest in spirituality and alternative explanations of reality was reflected in his choice of publications. His interest in the Oahspe Bible, led him on a 15-year search for a copy of the original 1882 edition published by Oahspe Publishing Assoc., New York and London. Although a later edited and revised edition was published in 1891 and reprinted over the years, the original 1882 Oahspe Bible was not available until Palmer republished a facsimile of it in 1960. It is often referred to as \\"The Palmer Edition\\" or \\"The Green Oahspe\\" among Oahspe readers. He continued to publish and reprint later editions to which he added an index and editor's notes. Oahspe was reported by the spiritualist medium John B. Newbrough to have come as automatic writing through his hands on the newly invented typewriter. Tributes The secret identity of DC Comics superhero the Atom ‚Äì introduced by science fiction writer Gardner Fox in 1961 ‚Äì is named after Palmer. A newer edition of Oahspe as a tribute edition to Ray Palmer was published in 2009 titled Oahspe - Raymond A. Palmer Tribute Edition. In September 2013, Palmer was posthumously named to the First Fandom Hall of Fame in a ceremony at the 71st World Science Fiction Convention. In 2013, Tarcher/Penguin published a biography of Palmer called The Man From Mars and written by Fred Nadis. Palmer is also the subject of Richard Toronto's 2013 book, War over Lemuria: Richard Shaver, Ray Palmer and the Strangest Chapter of 1940s Science Fiction, which attempts to give a detailed history of the Shaver Mystery and its two main proponents.

The base is under the jurisdiction of the 802d Mission Support Group, Air Education and Training Command (AETC) and an enclave of the city of San Antonio. It is the only entry processing station for Air Force enlisted Basic Military Training (BMT). Lackland AFB is part of Joint Base San Antonio, an amalgamation of the Fort Sam Houston, the Randolph Air Force Base and Lackland Air Force Base, which were merged on 1 October 2010.Joint Base San Antonio 502d ABW Joint Base San Antonio (JBSA), which includes Lackland Air Force Base, was established in accordance with congressional legislation implementing the recommendations of the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure Commission. The legislation ordered the consolidation of the three facilities which were adjoining, but separate military installations, into a single joint base ‚Äì one of 12 joint bases formed in the United States as a result of the law. Units * 502nd Installation Support Group : A unit of the JBSA 502nd Air Base Wing, the 502nd ISG is the focal point for all base activities, serving and supporting the 37th and 737th Training Groups and all of its mission partners as well as the more than 24,000 retirees living in the local area. * 37th Training Wing : 37th Training Group : Provides professional, military and technical training in the knowledge and skills needed for graduates to perform their jobs worldwide. Joint service training for Air Force, Army, Navy and Marine personnel is provided in numerous courses, such as the military working dog program and security and law enforcement : 737th Training Group : Provides Air Force Basic Military Training for all enlisted people entering the Air Force, Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard, earning Lackland the nickname, \\"Gateway to the Air Force.\\" * Inter-American Air Forces Academy : Fostering enduring Inter-American engagement through education and training. Teaches 37 technical courses, in Spanish and in English, to students from more than 22 countries every year. * Defense Language Institute : Primary mission was to teach English to Allied pilot candidates. In 1966, its mission expanded to include other career fields, and the school moved under the DoD with the U.S. Army as the executive agent. * Sixteenth Air Force : Operates, maintains and defends the Air Force information networks and directs mission critical cyber terrain, provides multisource intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance products, and is the Service Cryptologic Component responsible to the National Security Agency/Central Security Service for Air Force matters involving the conduct of cryptologic activities. * 624th Operations Center :: Interfaces with theater and functional Air Operations Centers to establish, plan, direct, coordinate, assess, and command & control cyber operations in support of AF and Joint warfighting requirements. Lackland AFB hosts a collection of vintage military aircraft on static display on its parade grounds, including a Boeing B-52 Stratofortress, McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II, Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird, B-29 Superfortress, C-121 Constellation, Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress and a B-25 Mitchell. Training Mission Lackland Air Force Base is home to the 37th Training Wing (37 TRW) which operates a variety of training squadrons. Within the 37th TRW is the 37th Training Group (37 TRG) which oversees the 5 technical training schools on the base, and the 737 TRG which oversees the Basic Military Training squadrons. =Basic training (enlisted)= A Staff Sergeant Military Training Instructor (MTI) at Lackland in 2009. RH&T; dormitories in background. A group of Airmen taking part in the Airman's Run, the final run before graduation. Lackland is best known for its role in being the sole location for U.S. Air Force enlisted Basic Military Training (BMT) for the active duty Regular Air Force, Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard. BMT is organized into nine basic training squadrons, each with their own training site on the base. Each squadron is equipped with either a dining facility or a medical clinic. Some BMT squadrons share dining facilities if they are located close enough together and the same is true for medical clinics. Each squadron also has a specific exercise area where basic trainees conduct physical readiness training (PRT). Also, AFOSI anti-terrorism teams are trained here. In October 2008 the BMT was expanded an extra two weeks to implement more air base defense training as well as other rudimentary skills. The BMT course of training is at weeks. =Officer Training= Prior to 22 September 1993, Lackland AFB's Medina Annex was also home to Air Force Officer Training School (OTS), one of three USAF officer accession and commissioning sources in addition to the U.S. Air Force Academy and Air Force ROTC. On 25 September 1993, OTS permanently relocated to Maxwell AFB, Alabama. =Technical training= Lackland, like many other Air Education and Training Command (AETC) bases, trains enlisted airmen out of basic training in a specific specialty via various \\"tech schools.\\" Lackland currently has six technical training squadrons on base training multiple airmen in various Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSCs). * The 37th Training Group supports the following five training squadrons and also trains technical training instructors, military training instructors and military training leaders. * The 341st Training Squadron trains military working dogs and handlers for the entire Department of Defense and several federal agencies. * The 342nd Training Squadron teaches Pararescuemen, Combat Controllers, Special Operations Weathermen, Tactical Air Control Party members, Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape (SERE) Specialists, and a variety of advanced Security Forces courses. * The 343rd TRS trains airmen to become Security Forces members in a 13-week academy. * The 344th TRS provides technical training for more than 10,000 active duty, Reserve, Guard, international and civilian students annually in Career Enlisted Aviator, Vehicle Maintenance, Logistics Readiness Officer, Logistics Plans, Materiel Management, Contracting, Recruiting, Safety, Cryptological, and TEMPEST courses. * The 345th TRS trains, develops and educates technical training students into skilled graduates in the Services, Air Transportation, Hazardous Material Transportation School (HAZMAT) and Traffic Management Office career fields.. History =World War II= Construction on Lackland Air Force Base began on 15 June 1941, and it was originally part of Kelly Field. One year later, it became an independent organization‚Äîthe San Antonio Aviation Cadet Center (SAAC). On 8 January 1943, the War Department constituted and activated the 78th Flying Training Wing (Preflight) at San Antonio and assigned it to the AAF Central Flying Training Command. The 78th Wing provided aviation cadets the mechanics and physics of flight and required the cadets to pass courses in mathematics and the hard sciences. Then the cadets were taught to apply their knowledge practically by teaching them aeronautics, deflection shooting, and thinking in three dimensions. Once completed, the graduates were designated as aviation cadets and were sent to one of the primary flight schools for pilot training. =Cold War= On 3 February 1948, the facility was named Lackland AFB after Brigadier General Frank Lackland, who was commissioned into the regular Army after serving in the National Guard, District of Columbia. It shared Basic Military Training status temporarily with Sampson Air Force Base during the Korean War and Amarillo Air Force Base during the Vietnam War until Amarillo AFB's closure in 1968. As a result of the Korean War, training populations at Lackland soared to 28 basic military training squadrons (BMTS) within the 3700th Military Training Wing. Temporary facilities, to include 129 \\"I dormitories\\", were hastily erected as a quick fix to replace tents cities housing recruits. In 1955 the number of BMTS was reduced to 16, where it remained for the next two decades. The Vietnam War buildup necessitated a \\"split-phase\\" training from August 1965 to April 1966. This program provided for 22 days at Lackland and 8 days at a technical school, with directed duty assignees receiving the full 30 days at Lackland. When BMT returned to a single phase on 1 April 1966, it was briefly cut back to 24 days from April to July 1966. After that, basic training stabilized at a length of six weeks. This was the same length as the program used by the Army Air Forces when Lackland opened as a basic training base 20 years before. Training requirements also expanded to include teaching English to Allied military members from foreign countries. No other item in the 1960s compared to the incident that occurred at Lackland in February 1966 with the death of a basic trainee. An airman died of spinal meningitis and while ten other cases were confirmed, no other deaths were reported. Virtually all non-essential activities requiring gatherings of basic trainees were canceled. To control the issue further, a cadre of personnel was assigned to activate the 3330th Basic Military Training School at Amarillo Air Force Base in Amarillo, Texas, in February 1966. As a result of the continuing expansion of the USAF, Amarillo AFB continued to conduct basic training until December 1968. During the 1960s, more permanent facilities were constructed, including four 1,000-person steel and brick Recruit Housing and Training (RH&T;) dormitories built between 1966 and 1970 for basic military training by the Lackland Military Training Center. These state-of-the-art buildings included living space, dining halls, and training areas for four basic training squadrons under one roof. Eventually six full-size dormitories, and two 600-person facilities, were constructed, enabling excess space to be converted to classroom use. =Air Defense Command= In late 1951 Air Defense Command selected Lackland Air Force Base as one of twenty-eight radar stations built as part of the second segment of the permanent radar surveillance network. Prompted by the start of the Korean War, on 11 July 1950, the Secretary of the Air Force asked the Secretary of Defense for approval to expedite construction of the second segment of the permanent network. Receiving the Defense Secretary's approval on 21 July, the Air Force directed the Corps of Engineers to proceed with construction. On 1 February 1953 the 741st Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron was activated at Lackland (P-75) with an AN/FPS-3 search radar and an AN/FPS-4 height-finder radar. In 1958 the AN/FPS-4 height-finder radar was replaced by AN/FPS-6 and AN/FPS-6A sets. By late 1959 Lackland was also performing air-traffic-control duties for the Federal Aviation Administration. At this time the site hosted an AN/FPS-20A radar. One AN/FPS-6 was retired by 1963. On 31 July 1963, the site was redesignated as NORAD ID Z-75. In addition to the main facility, Lackland operated an AN/FPS-14 Gap Filler site: * Schulenburg, TX (P-75A): In 1965 AN/FPS-20A was upgraded to an AN/FPS-91A radar, then in 1969 it was modified to an AN/FPS-66A. The 741st Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron was inactivated in December 1969, and the FAA assumed control of the radar site. In September 1972, the Houston- based 630th Radar Squadron sent a detachment (OL-D) to this FAA-operated site to set up an AN/FPS-6 height-finder radar to join the AN/FPS-66A search radar already in place (Z-241). The Air Force ceased using the Lackland AFB radar site on 30 September 1976.A Handbook of Aerospace Defense Organization 1946‚Äì1980, by Lloyd H. Cornett and Mildred W.

Prepared for United States Air Force Headquarters Air Combat Command. Today the Lackland ADC site has been taken over by the FAA (also known as 'San Antonio') and remains in operation. This now-FAA long-range radar site is now data-tied into the Joint Surveillance System. The site still operates the AN/FPS-66A search radar. =Post Cold War era= From the end of the Cold War, Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) actions in the 1990s relocated several specialized training programs at Lackland. This included Air Education and Training Command's relocation of Air Force Officer Training School (OTS) from Lackland to Maxwell Air Force Base in Montgomery, Alabama. Lackland gained a flying mission when adjacent Kelly Air Force Base closed in 2001. The two-mile-long runway is now a joint-use facility between Lackland AFB and the city of San Antonio. The portion of the former Kelly AFB still under USAF control is now known as Lackland AFB/Kelly Field Annex and its permanently based flying units include the Air Force Reserve Command's (AFRC) 433d Airlift Wing, an Air Mobility Command (AMC)-gained unit flying the C-5 Galaxy and the 149th Fighter Wing of the Texas Air National Guard, an AETC- gained unit flying the F-16 Fighting Falcon. The civilian side of the former Kelly AFB is now known as Port San Antonio and hosts numerous major DoD defense contractors such as Boeing and Lockheed Martin, many of which directly or indirectly support major overhaul and repair of military aircraft previously conducted, and in facilities previously occupied, by the Air Force's former San Antonio Air Logistics Center (SA-ALC) when Kelly was an active Air Force Logistics Command (AFLC) and Air Force Material Command (AFMC) installation. In addition, with the closure of Kelly AFB Lackland gained the section of base known as Security Hill. Security Hill is home to numerous units such as Air Combat Command's 24th Air Force and 67th Network Warfare Wing and the Air Force Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Agency. All units on Security Hill are considered tenant units. Lackland now consists of the Kelly airstrip, Security Hill, main base Lackland, and the old Medina officer training base now named Medina/Lackland Training Annex. With the exception of a few buildings most of the old Kelly air base including the housing has been turned over to civilian jurisdiction. On 15 May 2009, Air Force officials announced that Lackland is the preferred alternative location for the 24th Air Force. In winter of 2009 it was decided to combine all the military bases in San Antonio into one large base named Joint Base San Antonio.Joint Base San Antonio MOA becomes official In April 2012 Lackland served as an overflow shelter for an influx of illegal immigrant minors after the Administration for Children and Families determined that all other local shelters were filled to capacity. On 28 October 2013, the Military Working Dog Teams National Monument was unveiled during a dedication ceremony with full military fanfare.U.S. Military Dedicates First National Monument to Combat Dogs , Yahoo News, 28 October 2013New MWD monument meaningful to fallen handler's family , JBSA Lackland Public Affairs, 7 November 2013 The U.S. National Monument was authorized with the passage of Public Law 110-181, Section 2877,Public Law 110-181 , Public Law 110-181, 28 January 2008 (having been introduced to Congress by Rep. Walter B. Jones) which was passed by the United States Congress and signed into law by President George W. Bush. The monument was built next to the Basic Military Training Parade Field, that location being chosen due to the historical significance of the base as the training center and headquarters of the United States Department of Defense Military Working Dog Program. =Sexual assault scandal= In the sexual assault scandal at the training centre, dozens of female and male recruits said that they were sexually harassed or raped by their instructors from 2010 onward. =2016 shooting= On 8 April 2016, an airman on the base shot and killed a squadron commander, then killed himself.

O'Conor Sloane c.1928 Thomas O'Conor Sloane (November 24, 1851 ‚Äì August 7, 1940) was a scientist, inventor, author, educator, linguist and magazine editor, perhaps best known for his involvement with Hugo Gernsback and his science fiction magazine, Amazing Stories, initially as managing editor and then as the editor from 1929-38. Life and career Sloane was born in New York City in 1851, eventually moving to South Orange, New Jersey while maintaining work offices in New York City. Sloane was an academic prodigy, graduating with an A.B. from the College of St. Francis Xavier in NYC in 1869 at only eighteen years of age. He then earned an E.M from Columbia University in NYC in 1872, an A.M. from the College of St. Francis Xavier in 1873, a Ph.D. in electrical engineering from Columbia University in 1876 and later, an LL.D. from the College of St. Francis Xavier. Sloane was employed as a chemist by the N.Y. Gas Light Co. in 1872 and in 1877 as chief engineer for Citizens' Gas Light Co. in Brooklyn.

Sloane was the author of The Standard Electrical Dictionary, first published in 1892, as well as Arithmetic of Electricity: A Practical Treatise on Electrical Calculations, Electricity Simplified: The Practice and Theory of Electricity, Questions and Answers About Electricity: A First Book for Students: Theory of Electricity and Magnetism, Electric Toy Making for Amateurs, How to Become a Successful Electrician, The Electrician's Handy Book, Practical Electricity, An Electrical Library, Elementary Electrical Calculations, A Manual of Simple Engineering Mathematics: Covering the Whole Field of Direct Current Calculations, Speed and Fun with Figures, Rapid Arithmetic: Quick and Special Methods in Arithmetical Calculation, Fortunes in Formulas for Home, Farm, and Workshop, Henley's Twentieth Century Book of Formulas, Processes and Trade Secrets, Motion Picture Projection, Liquid Air and the Liquefaction of Gases, Home Experiments in Science, Rubber Hand Stamps and the Manipulation of India Rubber and others; including a translation into English of Saint Francis of Assisi: A Biography written by Johannes Jorgensen and The Electric Light: Its History, Production, and Applications by Alglave and Boulard. Sloane was also a prodigious contributor to many and various scientific and other publications such as the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Alden's Cyclopedia and The Catholic Encyclopedia. Sloane contributed more than two dozen articles to Scientific American. Sloane was an editor of Scientific American and served on the editorial staff of several more popular periodicals such as Everyday Engineering Magazine, Plumber and Sanitary Engineer and Youth's Companion. Sloane's editorial work at The Experimenter and Science and Invention magazines, published by Hugo Gernsback's Experimenter Publishing led to Sloane's involvement with Amazing Stories when Gernsback merged the two magazines, devoting the editorial and printing time, resources and distribution from The Experimenter to the newly created Amazing Stories. Sloane was a professor of natural sciences and higher mathematics at Seton Hall University in South Orange, New Jersey. Sloane was a member of the New Jersey State Board of Education and lectured in its educational series for several years. For many years Sloane was the Educational Director of the Chemical Institute of New York, which provided a distance-learning course of study in chemistry. The institute advertised heavily in the periodicals of the day [magazine ad for the Chemical Institute of New York, 1922], like Popular Mechanics, Popular Science, Amazing Stories and Radio-Craft. =Amazing Stories= Sloane was involved with Amazing Stories from the very beginning, serving as Hugo Gernsback's managing editor. His own role in the magazine production grew and when B. A. MacKinnon purchased Experimenter Publishing in 1929, Sloane was named editor. Sloane published first stories by sci-fi luminaries such as Jack Williamson, John W. Campbell, Jr., Clifford D. Simak, E.E. \\"Doc\\" Smith, Howard Fast and a first poem by Frederik Pohl. It is thought that Sloane collaborated with Gernsback in originating the term scientifiction which was superseded by science fiction to describe this genre, as suggested in part by the first issue of Amazing Stories.\\"A New Sort of Magazine\\", Amazing Stories: The Magazine of Scientifiction, Gernsback, Hugo, and T. O'Conor Sloane, eds., issue 1, page 3, April 1926. In 1938, publisher Ziff- Davis bought the magazine and moved its production from New York City to Chicago, naming Raymond A. Palmer as Sloane's successor. Family Sloane's son, T. O'Conor Sloane, Jr. became a well-known photographer; another son, John Eyre Sloane, an airplane factory owner, was married to Thomas Alva Edison's daughter Madeleine in 1914; their four sons were Edison's only grandchildren.

He was a leading figure in the independence movement and then the new government, and played a crucial role in facilitating and protecting Botswana's steady financial growth and development. He stepped down in 1998 and was succeeded by Vice-President Festus Mogae, who became the third President of Botswana. Early life Masire was born on 23 July 1925 in Kanye, Botswana into a cattle herding family to Gaipone (n√©e Kgopo) and Joni Masire. He grew up in a community where male commoners, such as himself, were expected to become low-paid migrant labourers in the mines of apartheid South Africa. From an early age Masire set himself apart through academic achievement. After graduating at the top of his class at the Kanye school, he received a scholarship to further his education at the Tiger Kloof Educational Institute in South Africa. In 1950, after graduating from Tiger Kloof, Masire helped found the Seepapitso II Secondary School, the first institution of higher learning in the Bangwaketse Reserve. He served as the school's headmaster for about six years. During this period he clashed with Bathoen II, the autocratic Bangwaketse ruler. Resenting Bathoen's many petty interferences in school affairs, Masire, working through the revived Bechuanaland African Teachers Association, became an advocate for the autonomy of protectorate schools from chiefly authority. In 1957, Masire earned a Master Farmers Certificate and established himself as one of the territory's leading agriculturalists. His success led to renewed conflict with the jealous Bathoen, who seized his farms as a penalty for the supposed infraction of fencing communal land. In 1958, Masire was appointed as the protectorate reporter for the African Echo/Naledi ya Botswana newspaper. He was also elected to the newly reformed Bangwaketse Tribal Council and, after 1960, the protectorate-wide African and Legislative Councils. Although he attended the first Kanye meeting of the People's Party, the earliest nationalist grouping to enjoy a mass following in the territory, he declined to join the movement. Masire married Gladys Olebile Masire in 1958. Sir Quett and Lady Masire had six children. Politics and governance In 1961, Masire helped found the Botswana Democratic Party (BDP). He was instrumental in the formation of the party, and served as its first secretary-general. In 1965, the Democratic Party won 28 of the 31 contested seats in the new Legislative Assembly, giving it a clear mandate to lead Botswana to independence. He was elected to the National Assembly in March 1965 and became Deputy Prime Minister in 1966. Masire became the new nation's Vice-President, serving under Seretse Khama, in 1966. Until 1980 he also held the significant portfolios of finance (from 1967) and development planning (from 1967), which were formally merged in 1971.https://www.finance.gov.bw/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=2&Itemid;=102 As a principal architect of Botswana's steady economic and infrastructural growth between 1966 and 1980, Masire earned a reputation as a highly competent technocrat. However, his local Bangwaketse political base was eroded by his old nemesis Bathoen. During the initial years of independence the Democratic Party government moved decisively to undercut many of the residual powers of the chiefs. As a result, in 1969 Bathoen II a Se√™papits√¥ abdicated, only to reemerge as the leader of the opposition National Front. This set the stage for Bathoen's local electoral victory over Masire during the same year. However, the ruling party won decisively at the national level, thus allowing Masire to maintain his position as one of the four \\"specially elected\\" members of Parliament. Presidency Quett Masire departing after a state visit to the United States in 1984. Khama died on 13 July 1980, and Masire automatically became acting president per the Constitution. Five days after Khama's death, Masire was elected as President by secret ballot at the National Assembly on 18 July 1980. Masire's three full terms were characterised by an emphasis on developments through regional and international organisations. Masire was chairman of the Southern African Development Community and vice chairman of the Organisation of African Unity; he was also chairman of the Global Coalition for Africa and a member of the UN group on Africa Development. On August 7, 1988, while flying with his staff to a summit in Angola, his executive jet was accidentally shot at by an Angolan Air Force MiG-23. The plane was damaged and Masire was injured, but the co- pilot was able to make a successful emergency landing.Accident descriptionAP News article Post-Presidency and death Following his retirement in 1998, Sir Ketumile Masire was involved in numerous diplomatic initiatives in a number of African countries, including Ethiopia, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Ghana and Swaziland. Between 1998 and 2000 he served as Chairman of the International Panel of Eminent Personalities Investigating the Circumstances Surrounding the 1994 Rwanda Genocide, and between 2000‚Äì2003 was the facilitator for the Inter-Congolese National Dialogue, which had the objective of bringing about a new political dispensation for the Democratic Republic of Congo, in terms of the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement. In 2007, Sir Ketumile Masire set up the Sir Ketumile Masire Foundation to promote the social and economic well being of the society of Botswana. The Foundation strives to facilitate and drive efforts to promote peace, good governance and political stability internationally; assist children with disabilities from birth; and promote innovation and alternatives in agriculture. During the last decade of his life, Masire became increasingly unhappy with the direction of the Botswana Democratic Party and the government of Ian Khama. Events such as the loss of about a fifth of the membership to the breakaway Botswana Movement for Democracy in 2010, and the bitter 2011 BOFEPUSU strike made him question leadership decisions. He came to conclude that the BDP had lost its original ideas, and had instead been taken over by opportunists looking to benefit from senior government positions.\\"President Masire's Final Message to Botswana,\\" https://www.academia.edu/33661982/President_Masires_Final_Message_to_Botswana As a result, he became estranged from the party for the first time in his life. Sir Ketumile is also a founding Member of the Global Leadership Foundation, an organization which works to support democratic leadership, prevent and resolve conflict through mediation and promote good governance in the form of democratic institutions, open markets, human rights and the rule of law. It does so by making available, discreetly and in confidence, the experience of former leaders to today's national leaders. It is a not-for- profit organization composed of former heads of government, senior governmental and international organization officials who work closely with Heads of Government on governance-related issues of concern to them. In May 2010 Sir Ketumile Masire led an African Union Election Observer Mission to the May 2010 Ethiopia Legislative Elections, and in October 2010 he co-led (with fellow GLF Member Joe Clark) a National Democratic Institute pre-election assessment mission in Nigeria, which identified a number of hurdles that could undermine a successful process surrounding the 2011 state and national polls. He was the chancellor of the University of Botswana from 1982 to 1998. Masire died at Bokamoso Hospital in Mmopane, Botswana, surrounded by his family, on 22 June 2017 at the age of 91. He had been hospitalized on 18 June after undergoing surgery for an unspecified reason, but his health deteriorated afterwards. He was buried on the morning of Thursday 29 June 2017 in his home village Kanye, Botswana.

A leader of the National Party of Transylvania and Banat before and after World War I, Maniu served as Prime Minister of Romania for three terms during 1928-1933, and, with Ion Mihalache, co-founded the National Peasants' Party. Early years Maniu was born to an ethnic Romanian family in Szil√°gybadacsony, Austria-Hungary (now BƒÉdƒÉcin, SƒÉlaj County, Romania); his parents were Ioan Maniu and Clara Maniu. He finished the Calvinist College in ZalƒÉu in 1890, and studied Law at Franz Joseph University, then at the University of Budapest and the University of Vienna, being awarded the doctorate in 1896. Maniu joined the Romanian National Party of Transylvania and Banat (PNR), became a member of its collective leadership body in 1897, and represented it in the Budapest Parliament on several occasions. He settled in Blaj, and served as a lawyer for the Greek Catholic Church (to which he belonged). Maniu was influenced by the activity of Simion BƒÉrnu»õiu, a maternal uncle of his father, Ioan Maniu. After serving as an advisor for Archduke Franz Ferdinand, counseling on the latter's projects to redefine the Habsburg states along the lines of a United States of Greater Austria, Maniu moved towards the option of a union with the Romanian Old Kingdom when the Archduke was assassinated in Sarajevo in 1914. PNR leadership Together with such figures as Vasile Goldi»ô, Gheorghe Pop de BƒÉse»ôti, the Romanian Orthodox cleric Miron Cristea, and Alexandru Vaida-Voevod, Maniu engaged in an intensive unionist campaign, leading to the Alba Iulia gathering on 1 December 1918 (during which Romanians demanded separation from Austria-Hungary). On 2 December, Maniu became head of Transylvania's Directory Council ‚Äì a position equivalent to interim governorship. Bust of Iuliu Maniu in Alba Iulia After the creation of Greater Romania, the PNR formed the government in Bucharest‚Äîa cabinet led by Al. Vaida-Voevod and allied with Ion Mihalache's Peasants' Party. It entered in competition with one of the traditional parties of the Romanian Kingdom, the National Liberal Party, and with its leader Ion I. C. BrƒÉtianu, when the Peasants' Party deadlocked the Parliament of Romania with calls for a widespread land reform. After King Ferdinand I dissolved the Parliament, Iuliu Maniu found himself at odds with the national leadership, especially after the new Prime Minister Alexandru Averescu (with support from the National Liberals) dissolved the Transylvanian Council in April 1920. Consequently, Maniu refused to attend King Ferdinand's Crowning ceremony as King of Greater Romania (held in Alba Iulia, in 1922), seeing it as an attempt to tie multi-religious Transylvania to Orthodoxy. At the same time, the PNR rejected the centralization imposed by the 1923 Constitution favored by BrƒÉtianu, and demanded that any constitutional reform be passed by a Constituent Assembly, and not by a regular vote in Parliament. Citing fears that the PNL had ensured a grip over Romanian politics, the PNR and the Peasants' Party united in 1926, and Maniu was the President of the new political force, the National Peasants' Party (PN»ö), for the following seven years, and again between 1937 and 1947. PN»ö in interwar Romania Despite its success in elections, the PN»ö was blocked out of government by the Royal Prerogative of King Ferdinand (who had preferred to nominate BrƒÉtianu, Averescu, and Prince Barbu »òtirbey). Maniu publicly protested, and attempted to organize a peasants' march on Bucharest as a public show of support modeled on the Alba Iulia assembly. He also showed himself open to deals proposed by Viscount Rothermere regarding a review of the Treaty of Trianon and, as King Ferdinand's death approached, started negotiations with the disinherited Prince Carol (King Ferdinand's son), proposing that the latter bypass the Constitution and crown himself in Alba Iulia (as a new foundation for the Romanian Kingdom). Talks with Carol were ended abruptly after the Romanian authorities called on the United Kingdom to expel the Prince from its territory. The PN»ö first came to power in November 1928, after both King Ferdinand and BrƒÉtianu had died (in the elections of that year, it allied itself with the Romanian Social Democratic Party and the German Party). In 1930, Maniu manoeuvered against the Constitution, and, together with Gheorghe Mironescu, brought about Carol's return and deposition of his son Michael. However, Carol did not respect the terms of his agreement with Maniu, refusing to resume his marriage to Queen Elena. After alternating governments of Maniu and Vaida-Voevod that had brought the party into conflict with the King's inner circle and with his lover Magda Lupescu, during its tenure his government was faced with a strike by coal miners in the Jiu Valley and major social and economic problems caused by the Great Depression. Maniu resigned for the third and final time on 13 January 1933, due to his ongoing conflict with King Carol. Under successive dictatorships The country moved towards an authoritarian regime formed around Carol and prompted by the rapid growth of the fascist Iron Guard. In 1937, Maniu agreed to sign an electoral pact with the Iron Guard's Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, in the hope that this would block the monarch's maneuvers. The king instead sought an agreement with other members of the political class, including the National Liberal Ion Duca and the former PN»ö politician Armand CƒÉlinescu, while clamping down on the Iron Guard‚Äîleading to a wave of similar actions in reprisal. With the loss of Northern Transylvania, Bessarabia, and Southern Dobruja in 1940, Carol conceded power and exiled himself, leading to the creation of the National Legionary State around the Iron Guard and General Ion Antonescu, a regime which aligned Romania with Nazi Germany and the Axis. The PN»ö survived in semi-clandestinity and, after Antonescu purged the Guard, achieved some unofficial status when Maniu began holding talks with the general over several issues (notably, he called for an end to persecution of the Jews and transports of Jews to Transnistria). He remained an opponent of Antonescu, a view which he balanced with his adversity towards the Soviet Union, and joined the plotters of the pro-Allied royal coup in 1944, while expressing his resentment of the Romanian Communist Party (PCR) involvement. Anticommunism thumb Subsequently, Maniu was a prominent supporter of the Western Allies and one of the main adversaries of growing Soviet influence in Romania. His party became the predilect target of PCR hostility. PN»ö supporters and Communists engaged in several street fights in February 1945. The PN»ö finished a distant second in the November 1946 general election with 33 seats, well behind the Communist-dominated Bloc of Democratic Parties. After the fall of Communism, some authors went as far as to claim that the PN»ö had actually won the election but was denied victory because of widespread electoral fraud on the part of the pro-Communist Petru Groza government.Romania at Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Later, historian Petre ≈¢urlea reviewed a confidential Communist Party report about the election and concluded that had the election been conducted honestly, the PN»ö and the other opposition parties could have won enough votes between them to form a coalition government but far less than the 80 percent support long claimed by opposition supporters.Petre ≈¢urlea, \\"Alegerile parlamentare din noiembrie '46: guvernul procomunist joacƒÉ ≈üi c√¢≈ütigƒÉ. IlegalitƒÉ≈£i flagrante, rezultat viciat\\" (\\"The Parliamentary Elections of November '46: the Pro-Communist Government Plays and Wins. Blatant Unlawfulness, Tampered Result\\"), p. 35‚Äì36 After 1946, the PN»ö was sidelined, with the PCR ensuring the collaboration of several former party members, such as Nicolae L. Lupu and Anton Alexandrescu. In a telegram to the State Department, the US representative in Romania, Burton Berry, wrote: \\"The Department well knows that Maniu has stood out boldly as a champion of pro-Allied action and sentiment in Rumania even during the dark days of the Antonescu dictatorship. He has an enormous political following in the country and I believe the respect in which all Rumanians hold him eclipses that held for any other Rumanian. Because of what he has been and what he is it seems important that he be preserved from slipping into sharing the general conviction that the dissolution of the Rumanian state is now in progress.\\"Ambassador in Rumania Burton Berry to the Secretary of State of the United States Stettinius, \\"871.01/12-944: Telegram / The American Representative in Rumania (Burton) to the Secretary of State / BUCHAREST, December 9, 1944, 7 p.m., received 9:45 p.m. The party was outlawed in July 1947. That month, Ion Mihalache attempted to flee the country in an airplane, which landed at TƒÉmƒÉdƒÉu, allegedly to establish a government-in-exile (see TƒÉmƒÉdƒÉu Affair). That was judged as an act of treason, and both Maniu and Mihalache faced a kangaroo court that sentenced them to life imprisonment at hard labour; given their advanced age, that amounted to a death sentence. The show trial, signaling the suppression of opposition groups, was a significant step towards the establishment of an undisguised Communist regime in Romania. Death Iuliu Maniu died in 1953 in Sighet prison, and his body was thrown into the common grave in the courtyard. References External links * Reluctant Allies?

The dance became internationally popular in the 1980s, especially in the Philippines, Latin America and Caribbean countries. It has adopted aspects of dances such as forr√≥, salsa, merengue, maxixe and the carimb√≥. Lambada is generally a partner dance. The dancers generally dance with arched legs, with the steps being from side to side, turning or even swaying, and in its original form never front to back, with a pronounced movement of the hips. At the time when the dance became popular, short skirts for women were in fashion and men wore long trousers, and the dance has become associated with such clothing, especially for women wearing short skirts that swirl up when the woman spins around, typically revealing 90s-style thong underwear. Origins =Carimb√≥= Also known as the forbidden dance, from the time that Brazil was a Portuguese colony, Carimb√≥ was a common dance in the northern part of the country. Carimb√≥ was a loose and very sensual dance which involved many spins by the female dancer, who typically wore a rounded skirt. The music was mainly to the beat of drums made of trunks of wood, thinned by fire. Carimb√≥ involved only side to side movements and many spins and hip movement, which became the basis of the lambada. =Etymology= After a while, a local radio station from Bel√©m (Par√°'s capital city) started to call this new type of music \\"the strong-beated rhythm\\" and \\"the rhythms of lambada\\". The term \\"lambada\\" had a strong appeal and began to be associated with the new emerging face of an old dancing style.Dance History The word lambada means \\"strong slap\\" or \\"hit\\" in Portuguese. However, as a dance form, lambada is of obscure etymology. In Portuguese it may refer to the wave-like motion of a whip. This flowing wave motion is reproduced by the dancers' bodies, and is one of the main elements that distinguish Lambada from other Latin dances.Lambada History - www.lambadamecrazy.co.uk =Two-beat dance style= Around 1983, the Carimb√≥ dance started again to be danced in couples, in a 2-beat style, something very close to Merengue, but with more spins. =Music= Aurino Quirino Gon√ßalves, or simply Pinduca, is a Brazilian musician and singer in the north of Brazil (Amap√° and Par√° area), where it is strongly believed he is the true father of the lambada music. Pinduca is a musician and composer of mainly Carimb√≥. He is the singer and composer of the \\"King of Carimb√≥\\" (as it is affectionately known) and he created rhythms, such as: Sirimb√≥, L√°ri-L√°ri, Lambada and Lamgode. In 1976, he launched a song entitled Lambada (Samb√£o), track number 6 of the LP No embalo of carimb√≥ and sirimb√≥ vol. 5. It is the first Brazilian recording of a song under the label of Lambada. Some support the version that the guitarist and composer Master Vieira, the inventor of the guitarrada, would also be the creator of the Lambada music. His first official disc, Lambada of Quebradas, was recorded in 1976 but officially launched two years later, in 1978.:pt:Pinduca In the late 1980s, the fusion between the metallic and electronic music from Caribbean brought again a new face to the Carimb√≥. This style started to be played throughout north-eastern Brazil (a place well known for its tourist approach), although this new Carimb√≥ went with the name of Lambada. Bahia =Four-beat dance style= The Lambada spread along the coast until it reached Bahia (the elder Brazilian state) where it was influenced by the Forr√≥, an old Brazilian style of dance which also had a strong beat. It became a four-beat dancing style, which was distinctive from the original Carimb√≥. This form of Lambada was danced with arched legs, with the steps being from one side to the other, and never from front to back. At the time short skirts for girls were in fashion and men wore long trousers, and the dance became especially associated with girls wearing short skirts. This association has continued until today, and the tradition is common in some places, such as the Lambar night club of S√£o Paulo. =Carnival= During the 1980s, the Carnival in Bahia was growing in popularity, and every summer a new kind of dance arose, only to disappear during the year after the tourists had left, with another dancing style and rhythm arising the following summer. A few years before the Lambada, there was the Fricote and the Ti-Ti-Ti among others dances, all of which disappeared never to be remembered again. Among with the \\"Trio-eletricos\\" (big movable trucks covered with speakers, on top of which musicians would play during the Carnival in Bahia), in 1988 the Lambada started to become popular in Bahia, and established itself in the city of Porto Seguro. Still, in this first boom of the Lambada, the economically developed south-east region of Brazil despised the various rhythms which came from Bahia on a regular basis, and which were believed to be only summer hits. Although it was recognized as a summer hit, the Lambada was not yet a true worldwide success. Many of the first lambaterias (a place to dance Lambada) which opened in 1988 couldn't survive the low tourism of the winter season, and closed a few months later.

The song continues to be covered to this day; for example: Pastor L√≥pez, Beto Barbosa, Manezinho do Sax, while others were increasing their careers, as was the case with Sidney Magal, Sandy e J√∫nior, Faf√° de Bel√©m and the group Trem da Alegria. =Kaoma's song \\"Lambada\\"= In 1988, French entrepreneur, Olivier Lamotte d'Incamps, visited Porto Seguro in Brazil and discovered locals dancing the tightly syncopated lambada to a melody that turned out to be Bolivian. D'Incamps became involved in the lambada dance craze, largely by promoting a European tour of Kaoma, a band formed with several musicians from the Senegalese group Tour√© Kunda. To display the dance in Europe, he chose a team of the best dancers at the Boca Da Barra (a dance cabana on the beach in Porto Seguro where lambada dancers refined and developed the style and form of the dance). Most notable among these young dancers chosen for the Kaoma company was Braz Dos Santos, who has become the most celebrated lambada dancer in the world today [Los Angeles Zouk Congress 2016 lifetime Achievement Award World's Best Lambazouk Dancer], and his brother Didi Dos Santos. After Olivier Lamotte d'Incamps bought the musical rights of about 300 lambada songs, he took the dancers back to France, and created the Kaoma band. They were part of lambada's worldwide known style, reaching all the way to Japan and Vietnam, where the dance is still popular. The French group Kaoma recorded a number one worldwide summer hit \\"Lambada\\", sung in Portuguese by Loalwa Braz, which sold 5 million singles in 1989. The song peaked at #46 in the United States in 1990 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. In Portuguese, the \\"Lambada\\" song is called \\"Chorando se foi\\", which means Crying he/she went away. In the music video, there were two young children, named Chico and Roberta, performing the lambada dance. They shortly thereafter started their own musical career. Other music videos featured Loalwa Braz, Braz Dos Santos, Didi Dos Santos, and other dancers from the Kaoma European Tour. These videos were broadcast extensively worldwide and, capturing the imagination of audiences who were attracted to the sight of beautiful young people dancing sensuously in the sun, greatly boosted music sales. The \\"Lambada\\" song was actually an unauthorized translation of the 1981 song \\"Llorando se fue\\" (which means: Crying he/she went away), by the Bolivian group Los Kjarkas. Also, the dance arrangements were an identical cover from the version of \\"Llorando se fue\\" recorded by the Peruvian group Cuarteto Continental and produced by Alberto Maravi. Kaoma's \\"Lambada\\" was also a direct cover of M√°rcia Ferreira's legally authorized Portuguese-translated version of \\"Llorando se fue\\". M√°rcia Ferreira and Jos√© Ari wrote and adapted Los Kjarkas' song into Portuguese using an upbeat lambada rhythm as \\"Chorando se foi\\", which was released on Ferreira's third album in 1986.M√°rcia Ferreira Official site marciaferreira.com.brM√°rcia Ferreira interview remember80.com.br. 02-26-2009. Due to Kaoma's clear act of plagiarism and release of their single without Los Kjarkas' permission, Los Kjarkas successfully sued Kaoma. Now Kaoma's \\"Lambada\\" song is credited to the Hermosa brothers (authors), M√°rcia Ferreira (translation), Jos√© Ari (translation), and Alberto Maravi (original producer).Kaoma: Lambada sheetmusicdirect.com Relation to Maxixe The association of Lambada and the idea of 'dirty dancing' became quite extensive. The appellative \\"forbidden dance\\" was and is often ascribed to the Lambada. This was largely due to its links to Maxixe. The true forbidden dance of the early 1920s in Brazil is the Maxixe, because of its spicy lyrics and movements. The idea was further perpetuated by the 1990 movies Lambada and The Forbidden Dance, and the short skirts, typical to the Lambada dance, that were in fashion around 1988. Lambada has many links with Maxixe and also with Forro. They have many figures in common. For example: *Bal√£o apagado, a figure in which the lady rotates her head while it hangs loose. *Pe√£o (also called boneca or toy doll), a figure in which the lady swings her head from side to side. Evolution =Early interpretations= With world repercussion, the dance reached far distortions. Due to a lack of fine Lambada dancers to make films and shows, most professional dancers started changing the way it was danced. Rock spins and steps were added, like those from Jive and East Coast Swing. Also some acrobatic movements became more commonplace. In contrast, Lambada contests at \\"Lambateria UM\\" (a place of Lambada) eliminated contestants if ever they became separated during the dance. =Different styles of music= After 1994 the Brazilian music style (also called Lambada), which gave birth to the dance, started to fade away, and the dancers began to use other musical sources to continue practicing the Lambada dance. Among these rhythms were the Flamenco Rumba (such as from the Gipsy Kings) and some Arabian music. Some very resistant dancers started to use other music styles to keep on dancing Lambada. Many of the Caribbean music like Soca, Merengue, Salsa, and Zouk were used to dance the Lambada. Finally the dance recovered most of its original way and style, with less acrobatic moves, smoother, intimate and closer contact. Some people like Ad√≠lio Porto, Israel Szerman and Lu√≠s Flori√£o (Brazilian teachers) regret that nowadays the dance changed its name to Zouk- Lambada in most parts of Brazil. This is mainly because of its musical orphanage. =Brazilian Zouk = Brazilian Zouk is a group of closely related dance styles based on or evolved from the lambada dance style and is typically danced to zouk music or other music containing the zouk beat. The name Brazilian Zouk is used to distinguish the dance from the Caribbean Zouk dance style, which is historically related to, but very different from the Lambada dance style. The three lines of Brazilian Zouk are LambaZouk, traditional (or Rio) Zouk and Zouk of different styles.

(creating filetypes as , , , etc., and its own hypertext format, ) with a single source file. It is implemented by a computer program released as free software of the same name, created and made available by the GNU Project from the Free Software Foundation.What's GNU: Texinfo, Issue 6, Oct 01, 1994, By Arnold Robbins, Linux Journal The main purpose of Texinfo is to provide a way to easily typeset software manuals. Similar to the LaTeX syntax, all the normal features of a book, such as chapters, sections, cross references, tables and indices are available for use in documents. Using the various output generators that are available for Texinfo, it is possible to keep several documentation types up-to-date (such as on-line documentation provided via a Web site, and printed documentation, as generated using the TeX typesetting system) using only a single source file. The official Texinfo documentation states that the first syllable of \\"Texinfo\\" is pronounced so as to rhyme with \\"speck\\", not \\"hex\\"; this pronunciation is derived from the pronunciation of TeX, in which the X represents the Greek letter chi rather than the English letter x. The maintainers state that \\"Texinfo\\" should be written with only a capital \\"T\\" and the rest of the letters in lower case.  Output formats  In order to make it possible for several documentation output formats to be updated all at once, upon changing the original Texinfo (.texi) source file, several syntax converters are available that can be used to generate translations of the Texinfo file into other formats. Most of these are created using the program, which is part of the GNU Texinfo distribution. ;HTML :(Generated via .) As HTML is the standard language for documents presented on the World Wide Web, this output format can effectively be used to produce online documentation pages. The manual notes that the program attempts to restrict its output files to a certain subset of HTML markup that can be read by as many browsers as possible. ;DVI :(Generated via .) The device independent file format is output by the TeX typesetting system, and can be used for generating device-specific commands that can be viewed or printed; for example, translation to PostScript ( files). ;PDF :(Generated via or .) Based on the PostScript language, this format was developed by Adobe Systems for portable document interchange. Like the PostScript format, it can represent the exact appearance of a document and supports arbitrary scaling. It is intended to be platform-independent and can be viewed with a large variety of software. Texinfo uses the program, a variant of TeX, to output PDF. ;Docbook :(Generated via .) This is an XML-based markup language for technical documentation that bears some resemblance to Texinfo, in broad outlines. It is also possible to convert Docbook files to Texinfo, using the program. ;XML :(Generated via .) For general purposes. ;Info :(Generated via .) This is a specific format which essentially is a plain text version of the original Texinfo syntax in conjunction with a few control characters to separate nodes and provide navigational elements for menus, cross-references, sections, and so on. The Info format can be viewed with the program. Notably, man is not available as an output format from the standard Texinfo tools. While Texinfo is used for writing the documentation of GNU software, which typically is used in Unix-like environments such as GNU/Linux, where man pages are the traditional format for documentation, the rationale for this is that man pages have a strict conventional format, used traditionally as quick reference guides, whereas typical Texinfo applications are for tutorials as well as reference manuals. As such, no benefit is seen in expressing Texinfo content in man page format. Moreover, many GNU projects eschew man pages almost completely, referring the reader of the provided man page (which often describes itself as seldom maintained) to the Info document.  Texinfo source file  Texinfo enables structuring a document like a book with chapters, sections, cross references and indices. The source is almost plain text, but technically it is formatted text marked up by commands that begin with \\"\`@\`\\". A sample of a part of a source file: @ifnottex @node Top @top Short Sample @insertcopying @end ifnottex @menu * First Chapter:: The first chapter is the only chapter in this sample. * Index:: Complete index. @end menu The commands mark structure such as chapters or denote a part of the source to be processed only for certain types of output.  History and status  Texinfo is used as the official documentation system for the GNU Project. Texinfo is licensed under the GNU General Public License. The Texinfo format was created by Richard M. Stallman, combining another system for print output in use at MIT called BoTeX, with the online Info hyperlinked documentation system, also created by Stallman on top of the TECO implementation of Emacs.GNU Texinfo Manual, Section 1.14 HistoryRichard Stallman, January 8, 2012, post on emacs-devel mailing list: \\"...Info has existed since 1976 or so, in the original Emacs. At that time, Info files were written by hand, and everyone could edit system files on ITS.\\" BoTeX itself was based an earlier system called Bolio (associated with David A. Moon, and used for documentation of the Lisp MachineDaniel Weinreb and David A. Moon (January 1979), Lisp Machine Manual, Second Preliminary Version), converted to use TeX for its output. Robert Chassell helped Stallman to create the first translator to create Info in Emacs Lisp. The Texinfo software distribution development was led by Brian Fox (up to version 3.8), Karl Berry (through version 5.2), and by Gavin Smith (since Dec. 2014). Texinfo is \\"loosely based on Brian Reid's Scribe and other formatting languages of the time\\".Texinfo See also * TeX * List of TeX extensions  Notes and references   External links  * Category:Hypertext Category:Free TeX software Category:GNU Project software Category:Markup languages ","title":"Texinfo"},{"id":"405909","title":"Cambodian People's Party"},{"id":"405911","text":"A screenshot of computer-aided dispatch as being used by Toronto Fire Services Computer-aided dispatch (CAD), also called computer-assisted dispatch, is a method of dispatching taxicabs, couriers, field service technicians, mass transit vehicles or emergency services assisted by computer. It can either be used to send messages to the dispatchee via a mobile data terminal (MDT) and/or used to store and retrieve data (i.e. radio logs, field interviews, client information, schedules, etc.). A dispatcher may announce the call details to field units over a two-way radio. Some systems communicate using a two-way radio system's selective calling features. CAD systems may send text messages with call-for-service details to alphanumeric pagers or wireless telephony text services like SMS. The central idea is that persons in a dispatch center are able to easily view and understand the status of all units being dispatched. CAD provides displays and tools so that the dispatcher has an opportunity to handle calls-for-service as efficiently as possible. CAD typically consists of a suite of software packages used to initiate public safety calls for service, dispatch, and maintain the status of responding resources in the field. It is generally used by emergency communications dispatchers, call-takers, and 911 operators in centralized, public-safety call centers, as well as by field personnel utilizing mobile data terminals (MDTs) or mobile data computers (MDCs). CAD systems consist of several modules that provide services at multiple levels in a dispatch center and in the field of public safety. These services include call input, call dispatching, call status maintenance, event notes, field unit status and tracking, and call resolution and disposition. CAD systems also include interfaces that permit the software to provide services to dispatchers, calltakers, and field personnel with respect to control and use of analog radio and telephone equipment, as well as logger-recorder functions. Methodology CAD systems may be interconnected with automatic vehicle location systems, mobile data terminals, office telephones, and selective calling and push-to-talk ID.Computer-assisted dispatch systems use one or more servers located in a central dispatch office, which communicate with computer terminals in a communications center or with mobile data terminals installed in vehicles. There are a multitude of CAD programs that suit different department needs, but the fundamentals of each system are the same. They include: * Log on/off times of police personnel (sworn/non-sworn) * Generating and archiving incidents that begin with a phone call from a citizen or originate from personnel in the field * Assigning field personnel to incidents * Updating Incidents and logging those updates * Generating case numbers for incidents that require an investigation * Timestamping every action taken by the dispatcher at the terminal In an ideal setting, a call is received by a call- taker and information about the call is inputted into the CAD template. Simply, location, reporting party and incident are the main fields that have to be populated by type-codes. For example, if there was a burglary in progress, the type-code for that incident could be \\"BURG\\"; when BURG is typed out, then the program will spell out \\"BURGLARY (in progress)\\". If the location was at the 1400 block of Madison, the type-code could be \\"14MAD.\\" The reporting party information would be populated by the call-taker including last name, first name, call-back number, etc. A typical CAD printout looks something like this based on the example above: \\\\----------------------------------- LOCATION - 1400 Madison RP - Doe, John, 555-5555, 1404 Madison INCIDENT - BURGLARY (in progress) SYNOPSIS - \\"Caller reports a possible burglary in progress based on seeing individuals inside the residence/Caller advises 2 persons inside the location and call advises the current residents are on vacation.\\" \\\\----------------------------------- Again, granted as it can be seen that the fields are spelled out, the call- taker uses those abbreviations that are already predetermined in order to quickly gather and transmit the information. The dispatcher then receives the call from the call-taker and is able dispatch the call to those available. The dispatcher's screen would show the available personnel that are dispatchable. A typical setting can be exemplified by this: \\\\----------------------------------- INCIDENT # - 110001 LOCATION - 1400 Madison RP - Doe, John, 555-5555 INCIDENT - BURGLARY (In Progress) SYNOPSIS - \\"Caller reports a possible burglary in progress based on seeing individuals inside the residence/Caller advises 2 persons inside the location and call advises the current residents are on vacation.\\" UNITS - 746 (Pri), 749 (Cov) \\\\----------------------------------- Units available - (3) Units out of service - (2) 745 - Avail. 746 - Not Avail. Inc # 554121 747 - Avail. 748 - Avail. 749 - Not Avail. Inc # 554122 \\\\----------------------------------- Everything that is gathered, dispatched and disposed is usually stored in a central server in which the type codes reside, or possibly another server. All of these calls which have incident numbers attached to them can be recalled by an internal search engine. For example, a request for a printout of all calls to Madison in the past hour could be gathered by querying the CAD program by location: Search by: Location LOCATION [ ] \\\\--- Result: (Now filled in) Search by: Location LOCATION [14MAD ] \\\\--- Result: (1) Incidents CAD can be used in a multitude of ways, whether it is for radio logs, call logs or statistical analysis. Consoles Denver RTD features a radio communication consoles and a GPS-based AVL system. Left picture is dispatcher console position. Right picture is supervisor's console. At right is a drawing showing basic controls for a single channel. Ambulance dispatch center in Austria. Console with CAD and voice switch Typical of local government dispatching facilities, the Denver RTD's facility is one example of a transit dispatch center. Communications consoles are mounted in desk-style electronics racks. Features include multi-line telephones. Modern facilities usually include a variety of computing systems for operational and administrative purposes. Consoles serve as a human interface and connect to push-to-talk dispatch radio systems. Audio from all channels is processed through audio level compression circuits and is routed to two separate speakers identified as select and unselect. Each has a volume control. The select channel or channels carry the highest priority communications. To prevent missed messages on critical channels, the select volume may be configured so it cannot be set to an inaudible level. Unselect channels may be used for special events, other agencies, or purposes that do not involve dispatch and may be inaudible. By pressing a button, any channel on the console can be toggled between select and unselect status. Each channel has an independent push-to-talk button, allowing the dispatcher to talk over one channel at a time. For broadcast messages, a single button transmits over all selected channels at the same time. A digital clock and an LED bar-graph or VU meter are included. Each channel has a label identifying it and indicator lights and buttons to control settings. A typical channel has a busy light, a call light, select light, select button, and a transmit button. The steady, red busy light indicates another dispatch position is transmitting on the channel. The flashing yellow call light indicates a field unit is talking on the channel. The call light usually blinks for several seconds after a transmission ends allowing a busy dispatcher to look up from a telephone call and determine which channel the last message came from. Some console dispatch panels are actually a PC-based application. Such is the case of Zetron's Acom system and Avtec's Scout system. This allows for easy customization and modification of the dispatch key layout. Service levels and geographic information Computerized mapping, automatic vehicle location, automatic number identification and caller-identification technology are often used to enhance the service by pinpointing the locations of both the client and the most suitable vehicle for serving the client. Some CAD systems allow several sources of information to be combined. For example, adding automatic vehicle location (AVL) and geographic information (GIS) could improve service by getting units to a service call location faster. Ideally, CAD is connected to monitor vehicle locations provided by an AVL system. This information is used to suggest the closest vehicle to an event. How is the closest unit determined? =Basic zone system= The simplest system is a beat or zone map system. For example, in a community with four fire stations, a grid is overlaid on a community map. Each zone of the grid is identified with a progression of police beats, ambulance zones, transit zones, or fire stations.This would work for any system including taxis or parcel pick up. One grid might be labeled: AB241. This means fire station 2, then 4, then 1, then 3 would respond to a fire call occurring inside this zone. The predefined order is created by persons with expertise in the service being provided, local geography, traffic, and patterns in calls for service. Since only basic GIS information is included, if AVL was available, it would simply display service vehicle locations on a map. The closest unit would be interpreted by the dispatcher looking at vehicle locations projected on the map. Where detailed geographic data are not available, units may be assigned based on the center of a district. To make the computing problem easier, the CAD system may use centroids to evaluate service vehicle locations. Centroids are estimated center points within a zone. The system calculates a distance from a fire station or AVL location to a centroid point. The closest fire station, according to CAD system rules, would be assigned. Systems may use centroids that are not exactly centered in order to skew or weight system decisions. Staff based at a fire station that is physically closer by drawing a straight line on the map may be slower to reach a zone. This can occur because responding units must drive around freeways, lakes, or terrain obstructions in order to reach a zone. A centroid may be moved because 200-car freight trains often block a railroad crossing used to access a particular zone. This is the cheapest system to develop because it requires the least detailed geographic information and the simplest calculations. Another problem occurs where several services use the same system. Police and transit, for example, may have different ideas about what boundaries define the ideal zone or how centroids should be weighted. = CAD using geocoding= Geocoding is a translation system allowing addresses to be converted to X- and Y-coordinates. Someone placing a call for service has an address attached to a wired phone number or tells the dispatcher their address. For example, suppose the caller's address is 123 Main Street. The GIS or CAD system includes a look-up table. The table may identify odd-numbered addresses in the community as being on the north and east sides of streets. Addresses from 113 to 157 Main Street are identified as being along Main Street's center line between Broadway and Washington. 123 is estimated to be on the north side of Main Street somewhere closer to 113 than 157. This estimate produces a latitude and longitude, or a set of Universal Transverse Mercator coordinates. The coordinates are close enough to identify the closest service vehicle. This system may automatically append the name of the nearest cross-street or intersecting street. Again, the system uses a straight-line distance to determine which service vehicle is closest to a call for service. If an AVL system is used, the CAD system will look through a list of most recent reported vehicle positions. Next, the positions are compared to the service vehicle status. The CAD system may identify several of the closest units that have a status of available. The dispatcher makes an ideal choice from the CAD system shortlist. This type of system is significantly more expensive than a zone system. The basic system may start with maps from the US Census Bureau or a county assessor's office. The quality of these maps may be good but will not be ideal for dispatching. There would normally be one or more persons on staff who would deal with data changes from new development, new streets, or data quality problems. The person would compile addresses and generate street centerlines in mapping software. Geocoding varies in accuracy depending on data sources and vendors. It normally takes years of work and planning before a system is implemented. Modern geocoded systems will often display service vehicle locations, the location of service calls, and the locations of callers on a map. This helps to disambiguate calls for service and reduces the likelihood of dispatching two reports of a single call for service as two separate calls. Another problem comes from technologies using differing datums or coordinate systems. For example, suppose your AVL system uses degrees-decimal degrees format. The AVL display for a vehicle at the Heart Butte Post Office in Montana shows a latitude and longitude of 48.28333 N, -112.83583 W. The CAD system uses degrees-minutes-seconds format data and shows the same location as 481700N, 1125009W. How do you translate? This is sometimes a problem with neighboring CAD systems. Ideally, you should be able to send and receive calls to and from CAD systems in neighboring areas. What if the state or provincial government has standardized on a different coordinate system? =Full GIS/AVL integration= The most expensive and technically challenging systems fully utilize the capabilities of geographic information systems (GIS) and automatic vehicle location (AVL). In these systems, the street centerlines are described as routable. In addition to geocoding and accurate street centerlines, intersections have attributes or scores. Can a service vehicle turn left from eastbound Carnegie Street onto northbound Hooligan Boulevard? A scoring system is used to assess the difficulty of making the turn. At one end of the scoring system there might be an interchange where service vehicles had unrestricted access in making the turn. Perhaps both streets are one-way, making it relatively easy to turn from one onto another. In the middle scores, a left turn might be blocked occasionally by heavy traffic, a draw bridge, or street cars. At the most difficult score, the two streets may cross but the lack of any interchange does not allow service vehicles to get from one to the other. To calculate the closest service vehicles, the CAD system does a network analysis of the road system based on these routable street centerlines. It assesses the path from the service call to the AVL location of available vehicles. The system recommends the service vehicles with the shortest path. Routable street centerlines take into account differences between northbound and southbound lanes on a freeway or turnpike. For example, to reach a point in the southbound lanes of a turnpike, service vehicles may need to drive north to the next exit then return on the southbound side. The analysis of a routable street network takes this into account so long as the event location is accurately reported. Routable systems account for barriers like lakes by calculating the distance of the driven route rather than a straight-line distance. It is assumed the service vehicle driver knows the shortest path or that all drivers make similar numbers of wrong turns. =Concentration= CAD systems require support staff with special skills. This can lead to concentration of dispatch facilities, particularly where there is population growth or where automation is required to meet defined service objectives. In any system, concentration of facilities increases risks of outages or massive failures. In a system where the call traffic is so high that advanced technology is needed to handle routine levels of day-to-day calls, relatively minor failures can have major effects on service levels. For example, where everyone is used to the convenience of automatic vehicle location (AVL), an AVL outage can suddenly increase staff workloads. Suppose a failure causes a condition where CAD cannot recommend a closest unit. How will the dispatcher efficiently assess which unit to assign? Data exchange (EDI) In public safety systems, standards are under discussion to allow disparate systems to exchange call information. For example, a call taker at the county fire department receives a call for an auto accident inside a city limit. Evolving standards will allow CAD systems to send messages to one another for calls originating outside local jurisdiction. Some entities have arrangements that already support data exchange between systems, but standards aim to make these interconnections more common. Because of auditing trail and fail-safe needs, the problem is more complex than it sounds.Associated Public-Safety Communications Officers web site, Data Transfer Committee, Focus Group III. The A.P.C.O. refers to this as Project 36. The usage of EDI applied to CAD is specific to the law enforcement community and should not be confused with Electronic Document Interchange (EDI) standards for eCommerce. Within law enforcement EDI is used as a buzzword to represent all electronic automated messaging. More mature efforts to interconnect CAD can be found in the standards developed for the Intelligent Transportation Initiatives program of Department of Transportation.Intelligent Transportation Systems This initiative sponsored the IEEE 1512 series of protocols for emergency management which provides sophisticated means to coordinate incidents across operations centers using CAD software. Additional work is occurring under the National Information Exchange ModelNIEM.gov to link homeland security with CAD. Also the OASIS international standards body has produced standardsOASIS EM TC and EDXL Emergency Data Exchange Language funded in part by the DHS and the disaster management e-gov initiative to communicate in emergencies. Other interoperability technologies can bridge disparities between the data-format, software, and hardware that constitute various computer-aided dispatch systems in various jurisdictions. Middleware, software and servers (data brokers), can translate and integrate various systems into a seamless automated dispatch system. One example of such middleware (provided by Utah-based FATPOT Technologies/CII) exists in Orange County, Calif., where the Fire Authority has integrated different emergency service answering points into a seamless dispatching network. A similar project was completed for the Silicon Valley Regional Interoperability Project (SVRIP), and is part of the Dept. of Homeland Security's CADIP report. Australia and New Zealand use the ICEMS protocol for messaging between different CAD systems operated by various emergency services organisations. Part of business enterprise computing system In business use of CAD, the dispatch system may be a module or part of a larger enterprise computing system. Rather than having multiple infrastructures, being able to have a single infrastructure with many applications running on it is important.Multiple Applications with Same Infrastructure A Model for Applications, Sourced March 2007. At the high end of enterprise integration for CAD there is SOS. SOS or systems of systems is a methodology and a set of technology for linking distributed independent applications into one meta-system or system of systems.System of systems System of Systems These methods were originally being used at DOD for command and control (C2) but have now been applied to dispatch in efforts like the Department of Transportation Intelligent Transportation System at the Transportation Management CentersOps.fhwa.dot.gov and other efforts involving DHS counterterrorism or fusion centers. Some local jurisdictions have also integrated their dispatch systems using EAI (Electronic Application Integration) software. Recent developments Computer aided call handling (CACH) is built on the premise that effective call handling is the foundation for an efficient dispatch response. By using structured call handling and a series of risk calculations, such systems can make objective dispatch recommendations based on information provided by the caller.

They are also used to display mapping and information relevant to the tasks and actions performed by the vehicle such as CAD drawings, diagrams & safety information. Mobile data terminals feature a screen on which to view information and a keyboard or keypad for entering information, and may be connected to various peripheral devices. Standard peripherals include two-way radios and taximeters, both of which predate computer assisted dispatching. MDTs may be simple display and keypad units, intended to be connected to a separate black-box or AVL (see below) computer. While MDTs were originally dumb terminals most have been replaced with fully functional PC hardware, known as MDCs (Mobile Digital Computers). While the MDC term is more correct, MDT is still widely used. Other common terms include MVC (Motor Vehicle Computer) and names of manufacturers such as iMobile or KDT. Technology In the earlier days of computer-aided dispatching (CAD), many MDT's were custom devices, used with specialized point to point radios, particularly in applications such as police dispatching. While applications like taxi and package delivery often still use custom designed terminals, majority of CAD systems have switched to ruggedized laptops and Wide-Area Wireless IP communications, utilizing the Internet or private IP networks connected to and over it. For many industrial applications, such as commercial trucking, GIS, agriculture, mobile asset management, and other industries, custom electronic hardware is still preferred. Custom terminals use I/O interfaces that connect directly to industry-specific equipment. They are usually environmentally hardened packages with power supply protection and robust memory file systems that greatly improve reliability and task efficiency. MDT solutions that are based on ruggedized consumer products or consumer available software will typically not have the life cycle duration expected in industrial applications, over 5 years.

A related device classification, specific to the transportation industry, is called automatic vehicle location (AVL). Mobile data terminals are often used in conjunction with a \\"black box\\" that contains GPS receiver, cell phone transceiver, other radio devices, or interfaces to industry-specific equipment. AVL devices may be simple stand-alone modems or may include operating systems with application space for the system integrator. Use in-vehicle MDTs are most commonly associated with in- vehicle use. This requires the MDT to be anchored to the vehicle for driver safety, device security, and user ergonomics. Mounts are designed for attaching MDTs to mobile workspaces into, most notably: automobiles, forklifts, boats, and planes. MDTs generally require specific installation protocols to be followed for proper ergonomics, power and communications functionality. MDT installation companies such as PCN Strategies, USAT Corp. and TouchStar Technologies UK, specialize in designing the mount design, assembling the proper parts, and installing them in a safe and consistent manner away from airbags, vehicle HVAC controls, and driver controls. Frequently installations will include a WAN modem, power conditioning equipment, and a WAN, WLAN, and GPS antenna mounted external to the vehicle.

Written by Paul Schneider and directed by Vincent McEveety, it first aired on December 15, 1966., and a repeat broadcast was aired on August 3, 1967. In the episode, the Enterprise battles a Romulan ship after investigating an unidentified assailant who methodically destroys the Federation's outposts at the Neutral Zone. The episode introduces the cloaking device and the fictional Star Trek race, the Romulans. Mark Lenard, playing the Romulan commander, makes his first of many Star Trek appearances. On September 16, 2006, \\"Balance of Terror\\" became the first digitally remastered Star Trek episode, featuring enhanced and new visual effects, computer generated (CGI) spaceships, and high definition format. The episode featured the final appearance of Grace Lee Whitney (Yeoman Janice Rand) before her return in Star Trek: The Motion Picture. Plot The USS Enterprise, under the command of Captain Kirk, is investigating a loss of communication with a line of Earth outposts near the Romulan Neutral Zone, formed under the terms of the peace treaty that ended the Earth-Romulan War a century earlier. Because there were no visual communications at that time, the two races have never seen each other. While Kirk officiates at the wedding of Lieutenant Tomlinson and Ensign Martine, Outpost 4 comes under attack. The Enterprise comes to Outpost 4's aid and contacts the base commander, Hansen, who reveals he is the only survivor of an attack by an unknown enemy with weapons of immense power. A single shot destroyed the base's shields and killed the phaser crew. As they speak, the enemy ship reappears. The ship fires before disappearing again. The shot destroys the outpost and kills Hansen. The ship's sensors locate the attacker, which remains invisible. Kirk surmises that the attacker is equipped with a cloaking device. A coded message from the intruder provides a view through one of its internal cameras, revealing humanoids with an appearance like Vulcans. Lieutenant Stiles, the navigator, son of a service family that lost several members in the Earth‚ÄìRomulan War, begins to question the loyalty of the Enterprise half-Vulcan first officer, Mr. Spock. During a discussion of the Romulan ship's capabilities, Stiles suggests the Enterprise attack the vessel before it can reach the Neutral Zone. Spock agrees; he reasons that if the Romulans are in fact an offshoot of the Vulcan species and have retained the martial philosophy of the Vulcans' ancient past, they would surely take advantage of any perceived weakness. A cat-and-mouse game ensues. The Enterprise is faster and more maneuverable, while the Romulan ship has a cloaking device and immensely destructive plasma torpedoes. However, the range of these torpedoes is limited, and firing one requires so much power that the ship must decloak first. When the Romulans head into the tail of a comet, Kirk tries to head it off: when the Romulan ship emerges on the other side, it will be visible and can be targeted. However, when a subordinate manning the scanner reports that the Enterprise is gone, the commander guesses Kirk's plan, and takes evasive maneuvers. The Enterprise, waiting on the other side of the comet, sees nothing and Kirk realizes what happened. He orders phasers to be fired blindly before the Romulans can counterattack. The Romulans, almost beaten, plant a nuclear weapon amidst jettisoned debris. When Spock detects a \\"metal-cased object\\", Kirk orders a point-blank phaser shot that detonates the device. The Enterprise is shaken by the blast and much of the phaser crew are incapacitated, requiring Stiles to act as backup. Kirk orders operations to work at minimal power to exaggerate the apparent damage and lure the Romulans in for a kill shot. Although the Romulan commander suspects Kirk's trap, Decius, a politically well-connected member of the command crew pressures him to attack the Enterprise. When the Romulan ship decloaks to launch a torpedo, Kirk tries to spring his trap, but a coolant leak in the phaser room incapacitates Stiles and Tomlinson. Spock rescues Stiles and fires the phasers in time to mortally wound the Romulan ship. Kirk hails the Romulans and at last communicates directly with his opponent, offering to beam aboard survivors. The Romulan commander says that it is not the Romulan way to be taken prisoner and triggers his ship's self-destruct system. The battle's casualties include Lt. Tomlinson. Kirk goes to the chapel to provide some comfort to a grieving Ensign Martine. Production Director Vincent McEveety had seen the 1957 film The Enemy Below but only noticed the similarities between its plot and this episode later. He admitted \\"Obviously, it's the same story.\\" The music played during the opening scene of the wedding ceremony is the 19th century English song \\"Long, Long Ago.\\" The term photon torpedo was only invented for a later episode \\"Arena\\", but the same effect was used in this one although still called phaser. Mark Lenard, the Romulan commander is better known for playing Sarek, Spock's father, and has the distinction of playing a Romulan, Klingon and Vulcan over the course of the series. He would reprise the role of Sarek in Star Trek: The Next Generation. Reception In 1993, The Star Trek Compendium stated the episode was essentially a science fiction version of the submarine film The Enemy Below, depicting a cat-and- mouse game between the Enterprise as the American destroyer against a Romulan vessel as the U-boat.

Billing themselves as \\"the sound of young Doncaster\\", Darren claimed to have met Wayne \\"planting flowers\\" while doing community service for burglary.

Fitzgerald later wrote: \\"When I was young I took my father and my three uncles for granted, and it never occurred to me that everyone else wasn't like them. Later on, I found that this was a mistake, but I've never quite managed to adapt myself to it. I suppose they were unusual, but I still think that they were right, and insofar as the world disagrees with them, I disagree with the world.\\" She was educated at Wycombe Abbey, an independent girls' boarding school, and Somerville College, Oxford University, from which she graduated in 1938 with a congratulatory First, having been named a \\"Woman of the Year\\" in Isis, the student newspaper. She worked for the BBC during World War II. In 1942 she married Desmond Fitzgerald, whom she had met in 1940, while they were both at Oxford. He had been studying for the bar and enlisted to serve as a soldier with the Irish Guards. Six months after their marriage, Desmond's regiment was sent to North Africa. He won the Military Cross in the Western Desert Campaign in Libya, but when he returned to civilian life he was an alcoholic. In the early 1950s she and her husband lived in Hampstead, London, where she had grown up, while they co-edited a magazine called World Review, in which J. D. Salinger's \\"For Esm√© with Love and Squalor\\" was first published in the UK, as were writings of Bernard Malamud, Norman Mailer, and Alberto Moravia. Fitzgerald also contributed to the magazine, writing about literature, music and sculpture. Soon afterwards Desmond was disbarred for \\"forging signatures on cheques that he cashed at the pub.\\" The end of his legal career led to a life of poverty for the Fitzgeralds. At times they were even homeless, living for four months in a homeless centre and for eleven years in subsidized public housing. To provide for her family during the 1960s, Fitzgerald taught at a drama school, Italia Conti Academy, and at Queen's Gate School, where her pupils included Camilla Shand (later Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall). She also taught \\"at a posh crammer\\", where her pupils included Anna Wintour, Edward St Aubyn, and Helena Bonham Carter. In fact, she continued to teach until she was 70 years old. For a while she worked in a bookshop in Southwold, Suffolk, and in another period lived in Battersea on a houseboat that sank twice ‚Äì the second time for good, destroying many of her books and family papers.

Later in 1977 she published her first novel, The Golden Child, a comic murder mystery with a museum setting inspired by the Tutankhamun mania earlier in the 1970s. The novel was written to amuse her terminally ill husband, who died in 1976. Over the next five years she published four novels, each connected in some way with her own experiences. The Bookshop (1978), which was shortlisted for the Booker Prize, concerns a struggling bookstore in the fictional East Anglian town of Hardborough; set in 1959, the novel includes as a pivotal event the shop's decision to stock Lolita.Mark Bostridge (23 August 2008). \\"So I Have Thought of You: The letters of Penelope Fitzgerald, ed Terence Dooley\\".

The first was Innocence (1986) a romance between the daughter of an impoverished aristocrat and a doctor from a southern Communist family set in 1950s Florence, Italy. The Italian Marxist theorist Antonio Gramsci appears as a minor character. The Beginning of Spring (1988) takes place in Moscow in 1913, and examines the world just before the Russian Revolution through the family and work troubles of a British businessman born and raised in Russia. The Gate of Angels (1990), about a young Cambridge physicist who falls in love with a nursing trainee after a bicycle accident, is set in 1912, when physics was about to enter its own revolutionary period. Fitzgerald's final novel, The Blue Flower, published in 1995, centres on the 18th-century German poet and philosopher Novalis, and his love for what is portrayed as a rather ordinary child.

He had previously been Mayor of Barcelona, from 1982 to 1997, and helped run the city's successful Olympic bid.  Early life and education  He was born in Barcelona in 1941 as the third of eight siblings. His grandfather was the Catalan poet Joan Maragall. In 1965, he married Diana Garrigosa, and he has two daughters and a son. He was an active member of the Workers' Front of Catalonia and joined the left- wing anti-Franco movement Popular Liberation Front. He studied law and economics at the University of Barcelona between 1957 and 1964. In 1965, after his studies, he joined the Specialist Office of Barcelona City Council as an economist, work he combined with giving classes in economic theory at the Autonomous University of Barcelona, acting as assistant to the professor, . He also cooperated with the Studies Service of the , run by . Between 1971 and 1973, he lived in New York City, where he gained a master of arts in economics from the New School University.  Beginnings in politics  In 1973, he came back to Barcelona and returned to the Barcelona City Council and to the UAB, where he gave classes on urban economics and international economics as temporary assistant lecturer. One year earlier, he supported Converg√®ncia Socialista de Catalunya, one of the founding groups of the PSC. In 1978, at the Economics Faculty of the UAB, he presented his doctoral thesis The prices of urban land, The case of Barcelona (1948‚Äì1978). In 1978, he was a researcher and guest professor at the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. This university would later appoint him doctor honoris causa. First elections He joined the PSC electoral list in the first democratic municipal election for Barcelona City Council in 1979 and this party won the most votes at the ballot box. His friend Narc√≠s Serra became Mayor while he became tinent d'alcalde (Deputy Mayor) for Administrative Reform, and later for Taxation. On 1 December 1982 he succeeded Narc√≠s Serra as Mayor of Barcelona, since Serra was appointed minister of Defence by the new Socialist government of Felipe Gonz√°lez. In 1986, Barcelona was chosen to host the 1992 Summer Olympics Accordingly, the city's mayorPasqual Maragallpresided over the organising committee (COOB'92). The Olympics provided the city with sorely needed infrastructure. Another Maragall initiative, the 2004 Universal Forum of Cultures, exhibited the same \\"top-down\\" approach. It is widely recognised, however, that the '92 Games helped Barcelona to redefine itself as one of the great cities of Europe. From 1991 to 1997, he was President of the Council of Municipalities and Regions of Europe. He was also Vice-President of the International Union of Local Authorities and President of the Committee of the Regions of the European Union from 1996 to 1998.  Recent years  180px In 1997, Pasqual Maragall resigned as Barcelona's Mayor and returned to university lecturing in Rome and New York City. However, he came back to active politics and was elected as the PSC-CpC candidate for the presidency of the Generalitat in the 1999 election. In 2000, he was elected President of the Partit dels Socialistes de Catalunya (PSC-PSOE), and was a member of the Catalan Parliament from 1988 to 1995. From 1999 to 2003, he presided the PSC- CpC parliamentary group. On 16 December 2003, Pasqual Maragall was elected President of the Generalitat by the Catalan Parliament after cliff-hanger negotiations with the ERC and ICV parties. He finally took office on 20 December. While generally popular as Mayor of Barcelona, Maragall's career as President of the coalition government was marked by a series of crises. A particularly severe one involved Chief Councilor Carod's \\"secret\\" trip to France to unofficially negotiate with ETA. Others include: the stormy negotiations over a new Statute of Autonomy for Catalonia in which Maragall and the PSC hovered between a nationalist stance and caving in to central government pressure; the collapse of an entire city block in Barcelona's Carmel district following poorly planned and executed tunnelling work; and a schemesupported by Maragall's governmentto build a tunnel for the AVE high- speed train under the shaky foundations of Barcelona's 19th-century city centre. In October 2005 Maragall met with objections regarding his plans for reshuffling the cabinet without consulting either his coalition partners or his party. Ernest Maragall, the President's brother, was tipped for a ministerial post in the reshuffle. Ernest, who was seen by critics as an apparatchik and held the post of Executive Secretary, whipped up a storm of protest in June 2005 when he opposed plans to make Catalonia's future anti- fraud department independent of the government. Pasqual Maragall's pledges to fight corruption and nepotism in public administration were one of the key planks in his 2003 election campaign. On 21 June 2006, Maragall announced that he would not be standing for reelection (see 2006 Catalan Parliament election). He offered his support to new President Jose Montilla amongst controversy over Montilla's non-Catalan heritage stating that it did not make Catalonia \\"less Catalan,\\" and later commented that \\"our new homeland is Europe.\\" He later stated \\"our new path is the Mediterranean.\\" On 19 October 2007, it was announced that he would not pay his PSOE membership fee anymore, ending three decades of activity within the party. The following day, he announced that he had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and his plans to create the Pasqual Maragall Foundation to fight against the illness.

Katzenelnbogen is the seat of the Verbandsgemeinde (\\"collective municipality\\") Aar-Einrich. History Katzenelnbogen originated as a castle built on a promontory over the river Lahn around 1095. The lords of the castle became important local magnates, acquiring during the centuries some key and highly lucrative customs rights on the Rhine. The Counts of Katzenelnbogen also built Burg Neukatzenelnbogen and Burg Rheinfels on the Rhine. The male line of the German family died out in 1479, while the Austrian lineage continued, and the county became disputed between Hesse and Nassau. In 1557, the former finally won, but when Hesse was split due to the testament of Philipp the Magnanimous, Katzenelnbogen was split as well, between Hesse-Darmstadt and the small new secondary principality of Hesse-Rheinfels. When the latter line expired in 1583, its property went to Hesse-Kassel (or Hesse-Cassel), which added the inherited part of Katzenelnbogen to its side-line principality of Hesse-Rotenburg. After the Congress of Vienna, this part of Katzenelnbogen was given to Nassau in exchange for property that had been taken away from it; after the War of 1866, with all Nassau, it became part of Prussia. In 1945, Hesse-Darmstadt was united with most of the Prussian province of Hesse-Nassau, which included the former Hesse-Kassel along with Nassau and the formerly Free City of Frankfurt, to form the federal state of Hesse. Thus, Hesse now includes the larger part of former county of Katzenelnbogen. A smaller part of Nassau, including the old castle and village bearing the name of Katzenelnbogen, ended up as part of Rhineland-Palatinate (part of the Rhein-Lahn and Westerwaldkreis districts). William III of England a Prince of Orange had the title Katzenelnbogen in his reign from 1689-1702 and today one of the titles of the King of the Netherlands (the House of Orange-Nassau) is that of Count of Katzenelnbogen. Etymology In German, the name Katzenelnbogen literally translates to 'cat's elbow', arguably a later mondegreen. Historians speculated that the name derives from Cattimelibocus, a combination of two words: the ancient Germanic tribal name of the Chatti and Melibokus, a generic Roman name for \\"mountains\\"., The theory is based on the name ŒúŒ∑ŒªŒØŒ≤ŒøŒ∫ŒøŒΩ (Mƒìl√≠bokon) used by Ptolemy specifically for a mountain range farther to the east, either the Harz, the Thuringian Forest, or both. Melibokon in a Latinised form would then be Melibocus or Melibokus. The fact that the name, in any recognisable form, first appears in medieval documents also suggests that it has no older, i.e. Roman, origin. History of wine In the history of wine, Katzenelnbogen is famous for the first documentation of Riesling grapes in the world: this was in 1435, when the storage inventory of Count John IV of Katzenelnbogen, a member of the Holy Roman high nobility, lists the purchase of vines of \\"Rieslingen\\".

The cocktail may have been invented by a bartender at Chasen's, a restaurant in West Hollywood, California, to serve then-child actress Shirley Temple.

He made his living as an orthopedist and later as the manager of a saw mill and glass factory, and became more appreciated as a composer after his death than he had been in his lifetime. Life and works Berwald was born in Stockholm and came from a family with four generations of musicians; his father, a violinist in the Royal Opera Orchestra, taught Franz the violin from an early age; he soon appeared in concerts. In 1809, Karl XIII came to power and reinstated the Royal Chapel; the following year Berwald started working there, as well as playing the violin in the court orchestra and the opera, receiving lessons from Edouard du Puy, and also started composing. The summers were off-season for the orchestra, and Berwald travelled around Scandinavia, Finland and Russia. Of his works from that time, a septet and a serenade he still considered worthwhile music in his later years. In 1818 Berwald started publishing the Musikalisk journal, later renamed Journal de musique, a periodical with easy piano pieces and songs by various composers as well as some of his own original work. In 1821, his Violin Concerto was premiered by his brother August. It was not well received; some people in the audience burst out laughing during the slow movement.Sven Kruckenberg, programme notes for Naxos CD 8.554287, Swedish Romantic Violin Concertos, translated by Andrew Smith. \\"The press were not enthusiastic. The Concerto was deemed to be too unwieldy and the soloist to lack any feeling for melody ‚Äì except in the central movement, in which the accompaniment was so ridiculous that some members of the audience burst out laughing.\\" A pavement plate commemorating Berwald's time in Berlin and his orthopedic clinic His family got into dire economic circumstances after the death of his father in 1825. Berwald tried to get several scholarships, but only got one from the King, which enabled him to study in Berlin, where he worked hard on operas despite not having any chance to put them on the stage. To make a living, Berwald started an orthopedic and physiotherapy clinic in Berlin in 1835, which turned out to be profitable. Some of the orthopedic devices he invented were still in use decades after his death. He stopped composing during his time in Berlin, resuming only in 1841 with a move to Vienna and marriage to Mathilde Scherer. In 1842 a concert of his tone poems at the Redoutensaal at the Hofburg Imperial Palace received extremely positive reviews, and over the course of the next three years Berwald wrote four symphonies. These were not the first symphonies he had written: numerous major works from the 1820s have gone missing, and the torso of a Symphony in A's first movement remains, has been finished, and recorded. The Symphony No. 1 in G minor, \\"S√©rieuse\\", was the only one of Berwald's four symphonies that was performed in his lifetime. In 1843, it was premiered in Stockholm with his cousin Johan Frederik conducting the Royal Opera House Orchestra. At that same concert, his operetta Jag g√•r i kloster (I enter a monastery) was also performed, but its success is credited to one of the roles having been sung by Jenny Lind. In 1846, Jenny Lind sang in one of Berwald's cantatas.David Mason Greene, Greene's Biographical Encyclopedia of Composers. New York: Reproducing Piano Roll Foundation (1985): 516 Another operetta, The Modiste, had less success in 1845. His Piano Concerto, finished in 1855, intended for his piano pupil Hilda Aurora Thegerstr√∂m, who continued her studies with Antoine Fran√ßois Marmontel and Franz Liszt, did not see the light of day until 1904, when Berwald's granddaughter Astrid performed it at a Stockholm student concert. Particularly in its brilliant last movement it may be compared favourably to Robert Schumann or Edvard Grieg. Its three movements are played without a break. Berwald's music was not recognised favourably in Sweden during his lifetime, even drawing hostile newspaper reviews, but fared a little better in Germany and Austria. The Mozarteum Salzburg made him an honorary member in 1847. When Berwald returned to Sweden in 1849, he managed a glass works at Sand√∂ in √Öngermanland owned by Ludvig Petr√©, an amateur violinist. During that time Berwald focused his attention on producing chamber music. One of his few operas to be staged in his lifetime, Estrella de Soria, was heartily applauded at its premiere at the Royal Theater in April 1862, and was given four more performances in the same month. Following this success, he wrote Drottningen av Golconda (The Queen of Golconda), which would have been premiered in 1864, but was not, due to a change of directors at the Royal Opera. In 1866, Berwald received the Swedish Order of the Polar Star, in recognition of his musical achievements. The following year, the Board of the Royal Musical Academy appointed Berwald professor of musical composition at the Stockholm Conservatory, only to have the Conservatory Board reverse the decision a few days later, and appoint another. The royal family stepped in, and Berwald got the post. At around that time he was also given many important commissions, but he did not live to fulfill them all. Berwald died in Stockholm in 1868 of pneumonia and was interred there in the Norra begravningsplatsen (Northern Cemetery). The second movement of the Symphony No. 1 was played at his funeral. Ten years after Berwald's death, his Symphony No. 4 in E-flat major, \\"Na√Øve\\", was premiered in 1878 (the originally planned 1848 premiere in Paris having been cancelled because of the political unrest of the time). This gap between composition and first performance was relatively short, however, compared to what befell the Symphony No. 2 in D major, \\"Capricieuse\\" and Symphony No. 3 in C major, \\"Singuli√®re\\". Those two pieces were not premiered until 1914 and 1905, respectively. The Swedish conductor and composer Ulf Bj√∂rlin has recorded various works of Berwald under the EMI Classics label. Critical assessment Eduard Hanslick, writing in his 1869 book Geschichte des Concertwesens in Wien, opined of Berwald, \\"a man stimulating, witty, prone to bizarrerie, [who] as a composer lacked creative power and fantasy\\". On the other hand, composers Ludvig Norman, Tor Aulin, and Wilhelm Stenhammar worked hard to promote Berwald's music. However, despite these musicians' efforts, it took a while before Berwald was recognized as, to quote composer-critic Wilhelm Peterson-Berger, writing in the Stockholm newspaper Dagens Nyheter, Sweden's \\"most original and modern composer\\". In 1911, Carl Nielsen wrote of Berwald, \\"Neither the media, money nor power can damage or benefit good Art. It will always find some simple, decent artists who forge ahead and produce and stand up for their works.

Hesse- Nassau was created as a consequence of the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 by combining the previously independent Hesse-Kassel (or Hesse-Cassel), the Duchy of Nassau, the Free City of Frankfurt, areas gained from the Kingdom of Bavaria, and areas gained from the Grand Duchy of Hesse (including part of the former Landgraviate of Hesse-Homburg from Hesse-Darmstadt; ). These regions were combined to form the province Hesse-Nassau in 1868 with its capital in Kassel and redivided into two administrative regions: Kassel and Wiesbaden. The largest part of the province surrounded the province of Upper Hesse in the People's State of Hesse. On 1 April 1929, the Free State of Waldeck became a part of Hesse-Nassau after a popular vote and became part of the Kassel administrative region. In 1935, the Nazi government abolished (de facto) all states, so the provinces held little meaning. Effective 1 July 1944, Hesse- Nassau was split into the provinces of Kurhessen (capital in Kassel) and Nassau (capital in Wiesbaden). In 1945, after the end of World War II, these two provinces were merged and combined with the neighbouring Hesse-Darmstadt to form the northern and western part of the newly founded state of Hesse. Parts of Nassau were also moved into the Rhineland-Palatinate.

Charlie Mortdecai novels Bonfiglioli wrote four books featuring Charlie Mortdecai, three of which were published in his lifetime, and one posthumously as completed by the satirist and literary mimic Craig Brown. Charlie Mortdecai is the fictional art dealer anti-hero of the series. His character resembles, among other things, an amoral Bertie Wooster with occasional psychopathic tendencies. His Mortdecai comic-thriller trilogy won critical plaudits back in the 1970s and early 1980s. The dry satire and black humour of the books were favourably reviewed by The New Yorker and others. The books are still in print and have been translated into several languages. Don't Point That Thing At Me was awarded the 1973 CWA New Blood Dagger for the best crime novel by a hitherto unpublished writer. Bonfiglioli's style and narrative technique have been favourably compared to those of P. G. Wodehouse. Mortdecai and his manservant Jock Strapp bear a fun-house mirror relation to Wodehouse's Wooster and Jeeves. The author makes a nod to this comparison by having Mortdecai reference Wodehouse in the novels. Actors Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie are among those who are fans of his work.

The Bructeri (from Latin; Greek: ŒíœÅŒøœçŒ∫œÑŒµœÅŒøŒπ, Broukteroi, or ŒíŒøœÖœÉŒ¨Œ∫œÑŒµœÅŒøŒπ, Bousakteroi; Old English: Boruhtware) were a Germanic tribein Roman imperial times, located in northwestern Germany, in present-day North Rhine-Westphalia. Their territory included both sides of the upper Ems (Latin Amisia) and Lippe (Latin Luppia) rivers. At its greatest extent, their territory apparently stretched between the vicinities of the Rhine in the west and the Teutoburg Forest and Weser river in the east. In late Roman times they moved south to settle upon the east bank of the Rhine facing Cologne, an area later associated with the Ripuarian Franks. Role in history The Bructeri formed an alliance with the Cherusci, the Marsi, the Chatti, Sicambri, and the Chauci, under the leadership of Arminius, that defeated the Roman General Varus and annihilated his three legions at the Battle of Teutoburg Forest in 9 AD. Six years later, one of the generals serving under Germanicus, Lucius Stertinius defeated the Bructeri near the Ems and devastated their lands. Among the booty captured by Stertinius was the eagle standard of Legio XIX that had been lost at Teutoburg Forest. \\"The troops were then marched to the furthest frontier of the Bructeri, and all the country between the rivers Amisia and Luppia was ravaged, not far from the forest of Teutoburgium, where the remains of Varus and his legions were said to lie unburied.\\"Tac. Ann. 1.60 Scholars consider the Bructeri among the most dangerous Germanic enemies of Rome.Brukterer, ¬ß 2 (Historisches). In: Germanische Altertumskunde Online. Vol. 3 (1978), S. 585. The Bructeri in 69-70 participated in the Batavian rebellion. The best known of the Bructeri was their wise virgin Veleda, the spiritual leader of the Batavi rising, regarded as a goddess.Tac. Ger. 8 She foretold the success of the Germans against the Roman legions during the Batavian revolt. A Roman Munius Lupercus was sent to offer her gifts but was murdered on the road.Tac. Hist. 4.61 The inhabitants of Cologne, the Ubii, asked for her as an arbiter; \\"they were not, however, allowed to approach or address Veleda herself. In order to inspire them with more respect they were prevented from seeing her. She dwelt in a lofty tower, and one of her relatives, chosen for the purpose, conveyed, like the messenger of a divinity, the questions and answers.\\"Tac. Hist. 4.65 Geography The Bructeri were sometimes divided into major and minor divisions. Strabo (64/63 BC ‚Äì c. 24 AD) describes the Lippe river running through the territory of the lesser Bructeri (ŒíŒøœÖœÉŒ¨Œ∫œÑŒµœÅŒøŒπ), about 600 stadia from the Rhine.Strabo, Geography 7.1 Ptolemy (c. AD 90 ‚Äì c. AD 168) says that lesser Bructeri and the Sicambri occupied the area just to the north of the Rhine. Both authors agree that the greater Bructeri in their time lived between the Ems and the Weser, to the south of a part of the Chauci.Ptolemaeus 2.11. and also at lacuscurtius site Tacitus (56 AD ‚Äì 117 AD) on the other hand, states that the Bructeri had been forced from their territory, which he describes as having been north of the Tencteri who were on the Rhine at the time, between Cologne and the Chatti. This was done by the Chamavi and Angrivarii, who neighbored the Bructeri upon their north, along with other neighboring tribes. More than sixty thousand fell in this conflict, which the Romans had been able to observe with satisfaction.Tac. Ger. 33 Pliny the Younger (died 113) mentioned in a letter (2.7) that in his time \\"a triumphal Statue was decreed by the Senate to Vestricius Spurinna\\", at the Motion of the Emperor, because he \\"had brought the King of the Bructeri into his Realm by force of War; and even subdu'd that rugged Nation, by the Sight and Terror of it, the most honourable kind of Victory\\". Later history The Bructeri eventually disappear from historical records, apparently absorbed into the Frankish communities of the early Middle Ages. The final mentions of their name seem to indicate this, and also that they had moved south from their old position north of the Lippe. In 307-308, after having spent the year before fighting Franks, emperor Constantine fought the Bructeri over the Rhine and built a bridge at Cologne. In 392 AD, according to a citation by Gregory of Tours, Sulpicius Alexander reported that Arbogast crossed the Rhine to punish the Franks for incursions into Gaul. He first devastated the territory of the Bricteri, near the bank of the Rhine, then the Chamavi, apparently their neighbours. Both tribes did not confront him. The Ampsivarii and the Chatti however were under military leadership of the Frankish princes Marcomer and Sunno and they appeared \\"on the ridges of distant hills\\". At this time the Bructeri apparently lived near Cologne. (Note that the Chamavi and the Ampsivarii are the two peoples that Tacitus had long before noted as having conquered the Bructeri from their north.) In the Peutinger map, the Bructeri also appear as a distinct entity on the opposite side of the Rhine to Cologne and Bonn, the Burcturi, with Franks to their north, and Suevi to their south. This has been interpreted to mean that the Bructeri had moved into the area previously inhabited by the Tencteri and Usipetes, which had in the time of Caesar been inhabited by the Ubii (who had in turn crossed the Rhine to inhabit Cologne as Roman citizens during imperial times). In the description of Claudius Ptolemy, the Bructeri and Sicambri are apparently close to their old positions, but with Suevi having inserted themselves upon the Rhine and the Tencteri and Usipetes much further south, near the Black Forest. This document is however suspected of resulting from confused use of primary sources. Sidonius, in his Poems, VII, lists the Bructeri among the allies who crossed the Rhine into Gaul under Attila in 451, leading to the Battle of the Catalaunian Fields. (After them are listed the Franks living along the Neckar River.) But it is possible, according for example to E. A. Thompson that Sidonius included names of historical tribes, for effect. The name of the Arboruchoi (ŒëœÅŒ≤œåœÅœÖœáŒøŒπ), a people described by Procopius (550s) as living next to the Franks along the lower Rhine during the time of Clovis I (c. 490), may be identical with that of the Bructeri. According to Procopius, they were Roman foederati who warred with the Franks before joining and merging with them, although they retained some of the customs from their Roman service down to Procopius' time. Not all scholars accept their identification with the Bructeri, however, which depends on a misspelling by Procopius (Arboruchoi for Arboruchtoi)., at 10. By 690 Bructeri were found in Thuringia, after the Saxons had conquered their homeland; their name is preserved in the names Gro√übr√ºchter and Kleinbr√ºchter, in the municipality Helbed√ºndorf. Under the Carolingians the name of the Bructeri was still being used for a gau in the region near where they had originally lived, the so-called Brukterergau (or Borahtra, Botheresgau, Botheresge, Pagus Boroctra). This was however now south of the Lippe, and north of the Ruhr river, in the area classically inhabited by the Sicambri. This area is today the well-known and heavily populated Ruhr region of Germany. At the beginning of the 8th century, Bede in his Ecclesiastical History of the English People lists among the peoples \\"from whom the Angles and Saxons who now live in Britain derive their origin\\" the Boruhtware (original Latin Bede Boructuari, Old English Bede Boructuare). In the same passage Bede also lists the Frisians, Rugians, Danes, Huns and continental Saxons. This name is usually identified with that of the Bructeri., pp. 10 & 135. According to Walter Pohl, the mention of the Bructeri (or Boructuarii, as he calls them) may be a classical allusion designed to establish continuity between the barbarian present and past., at 15. Ian Wood, noting that the Bricteri of Gregory of Tours are usually considered either a Saxon or Frankish group, suggests that the Boructuarii represent the Frankish component in the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain., at 41 & 44.

While the borders of the region are not clearly defined, the territory that still carries the name is Volyn Oblast, located in western Ukraine. Volhynia has changed hands numerous times throughout history and been divided among competing powers. At one time all of Volhynia was part of the Pale of Settlement designated by Imperial Russia on its southwesternmost border. Important cities include Lutsk, Rivne, Volodymyr-Volynskyi (Volodymyr), Iziaslav, and Novohrad-Volynskyi (Zviahel). After the annexation of Volhynia by the Russian Empire as part of the Partitions of Poland, it also included the cities of Zhytomyr, Ovruch, Korosten. The city of Zviahel was renamed Novohrad-Volynsky, and Volodymyr became Volodymyr-Volynskyi.  Names and etymology  Volynia ); , or ; , , or (Volhynian German: / or / ), ) The alternative name for the region is Lodomeria after the city of Volodymyr- Volynsky (previously known as Volodymer), which was once a political capital of the medieval Volhynian Principality. According to some historians, the region is named after a semi-legendary city of Volin or Velin, said to have been located on the Southern Bug River,E.M. Pospelov, Geograficheskie nazvaniya mira (Moscow, 1998), p. 104. whose name may come from the Proto- Slavic root 'wet'. In other versions, the city was located over to the west of Volodymyr-Volynskyi near the mouth of the River, a tributary of the Western Bug.  Geography  Mezhyrich Abbey in Ostroh was endowed by the Ostrogski princes in the 15th century. Olyka Castle Geographically it occupies northern areas of the Volhynian-Podolian Upland and western areas of Polesian Lowland along the Prypyat valley as part of the vast East European Plain, between the Western Bug in the west and upper streams of Uzh and Teteriv rivers.Portnov, A. Volyn. Encyclopedia of Modern Ukraine. Before the partitions of Poland, the eastern edge stretched a little west along the right-banks of the Sluch River or just east of it. Within the territory of Volhynia is located Little Polisie, a lowland that actually divides the Volhynian-Podolian Upland into separate Volhynian Upland and northern outskirts of Podolian Upland, the so- called Kremenets Hills. Volhynia is located in the basins of the Western Bug and Prypyat, therefore most of its rivers flow either in a northern or a western direction. Relative to other historical regions, it is northeast of Galicia, east of Lesser Poland and northwest of Podolia. The borders of the region are not clearly defined, and it is often considered to overlap a number of other regions, among which are Polesia and Podlasie. The territories of historical Volhynia are now part of the Volyn, Rivne and parts of the Zhytomyr, Ternopil and Khmelnytskyi Oblasts of Ukraine, as well as parts of Poland (see Che≈Çm). Major cities include Lutsk, Rivne, Kovel, Volodymyr- Volynskyi, Kremenets (Ternopil Oblast) and Starokostiantyniv (Khmelnytskyi Oblast). Before World War II, many Jewish shtetls (villages), such as Trochenbrod and Lozisht, were an integral part of the region. At one time all of Volhynia was part of the Pale of Settlement designated by Imperial Russia on its southwesternmost border.  History  The land was mentioned in the works of Arabian scholar Al-Masudi, who denoted the local tribe as \\"people of Valin\\". In his work of 947‚Äì948, Al-Masudi mentions the Valinians as an intertribal union ruled by their leader Madjak. Volhynia may have been included (or was in the sphere of influence) in the Grand Duchy of Kyiv (Ruthenia) as early as the 10th century. At that time Princess Olga sent a punitive raid against the Drevlians to avenge the death of her husband Grand Prince Igor (Ingvar R√∂reksson); she later established pogosts along the Luha River. In the opinion of the Ukrainian historian Yuriy Dyba, the chronicle phrase ¬´–∏ –æ—É—Å—Ç–∞–≤–∏ –ø–æ –º—å—Å—Ç—£. –ø–æ–≥–æ—Å—Ç—ã –∏ –¥–∞–Ω—å. –∏ –ø–æ –ª—É–∑—£ –ø–æ–≥–æ—Å—Ç—ã –∏ –¥–∞–Ω—å –∏ —°–±—Ä–æ–∫—ã¬ª (and established in place pogosts and tribute along Luha), the path of pogosts and tribute reflects the actual route of Olga's raid against the Drevlians further to the west, up to the Western Bug's right tributary Luha River. As early as 983, Vladimir the Great appointed his son Vsevolod as the ruler of the Volhynian Principality. In 988 he established the city of Volodymer (–í–æ–ª–æ–¥–∏–º—£—Ä—ä). The first records can be traced to the Ruthenian chronicles, such as the Primary Chronicle, which mentions tribes of the Dulebe, Buzhan and Volhynian peoples in the year of 1077. Volhynia's early history coincides with that of the duchies or principalities of Halych and Volhynia. These two successor states of the Kyivan Rus formed Halych-Volhynia between the 12th and the 14th centuries. Pochayiv Lavra, the spiritual heart of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church in Volhynia. Zymne Monastery Great Synagogue, Lutsk Tarakaniv Fort near Dubno After the disintegration of the Grand Duchy of Halych-Volhynia circa 1340, the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania divided the region between them, Poland taking Western Volhynia and Lithuania taking Eastern Volhynia (1352‚Äì1366). After 1569 Volhynia was organized as a province of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth. During this period many Poles and Jews settled in the area. The Roman and Greek Catholic churches became established in the province. In 1375 a Roman Catholic Diocese of Lodomeria was established, but it was suppressed in 1425. Many Orthodox churches joined the latter organization in order to benefit from a more attractive legal status. Records of the first agricultural colonies of Mennonites, Protestants from Germany, date from 1783. After the Third partition of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth in 1795, Volhynia was annexed as the Volhynian Governorate of the Russian Empire. It covered an area of 71,852.7 square kilometres. Following this annexation, the Russian government greatly changed the religious make-up of the area: it forcibly liquidated the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, transferring all of its buildings to the ownership and control of the Russian Orthodox Church. Many Roman Catholic church buildings were also given to the Russian Church. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Lutsk was suppressed by order of Empress Catherine II. In 1897, the population amounted to 2,989,482 people (41.7 per square kilometre). It consisted of 73.7 percent East Slavs (predominantly Ukrainians), 13.2 percent Jews, 6.2 percent Poles, and 5.7 percent Germans.Meyers Konversations-Lexikon. 6th edition, Vol. 20, Leipzig and Vienna\\" 1909, pp. 744-745. Most of the German settlers had immigrated from Congress Poland. A small number of Czech settlers also had migrated here. Although economically the area was developing rather quickly, upon the eve of the First World War it was still the most rural province in Western Russia. =World War I and the German settlements in Volhynia= =Ukrainian Nationalist at the end of World War I= At the end of the First World War, nationalists tried to form the Ukrainian National Autonomy. The territory of Volhynia was split in half by a frontline just west of the city of Lutsk. Due to an invasion of the Bolsheviks, the government of Ukraine was forced to retreat to Volhynia after the sack of Kyiv. Military aid from the Central Powers brought peace in the region and some degree of stability. Until the end of the war, the area saw a revival of Ukrainian culture after years of Russian oppression and the denial of Ukrainian traditions. After German troops were withdrawn, the whole region was engulfed by a new wave of military actions by Poles and Russians competing for control of the territory.

The Hebrew inscriptions say: \\"A Good Happy New Year, the year of the redemption of our sanctuaries, Tel Aviv E.Y. (=Eretz Yisrael), year 5731 In 1921, after the end of the Polish‚ÄìSoviet war, the treaty known as the Peace of Riga divided the Volhynian Governorate between Poland and the Soviet Union. Poland took the larger part and established Volhynian Voivodeship. Most of eastern Volhynian Governorate became part of the Ukrainian SSR, eventually being split into smaller districts. During that period, a number of national districts were formed within the Soviet Ukraine as part of cultural liberalization. The policies of Polonization in Poland led to formations of various resistance movements in West Ukraine and West Belarus, including Volhynia. In 1931 the Vatican of the Roman Catholic Church established a Ukrainian Catholic Apostolic Exarchate of Volhynia, Polesia and Pidliashia (Wolhynien, Polissia und Pidliashia in German), where the congregation practiced the Byzantine Rite in Ukrainian language. From 1935 to 1938 the government of the Soviet Union deported numerous nationals from Volhynia in a population transfer to Siberia and central Asia, as part of the dekulakization, an effort to suppress peasant farmers in the region. These people included Poles of Eastern Volhynia (see Population transfer in the Soviet Union). =World War II= Following the signing of the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact in 1939 and the subsequent invasion and division of Polish territories between the Reich and the USSR, the Soviet Union invaded and occupied the Polish part of Volhynia. In the course of the Nazi‚ÄìSoviet population transfers which followed this (temporary) German-Soviet alliance, most of the ethnic German-minority population of Volhynia were transferred to those Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany. Following the mass deportations and arrests carried out by the NKVD, and repressive actions against Poles taken by Germany: deportation to the Reich to forced labour camps, arrests, detention in camps and mass executions, by 1943 ethnic Poles constituted only 10‚Äì12% of the entire population of Volhynia. During the German invasion, around 40,000‚Äì60,000 Polish people in Volhynia were massacred by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army. The number of Ukrainian victims of Polish retaliatory attacks until the spring of 1945 is estimated at approx. 2,000‚àí3,000 in Volhynia. In 1945 Soviet Ukraine expelled ethnic Germans from Volhynia following the end of the war, because Nazi Germany had used ethnic Germans in eastern Europe as an excuse to invade those areas. The expulsion of Germans from eastern Europe was part of a mass population transfer after the war. Soviet Ukraine annexed Volhynia after the end of World War II. In 1944 the communists in Volyhnia suppressed the Ukrainian Catholic Apostolic Exarchate. Most of the remaining ethnic Polish population were expelled to Poland in 1945. Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in the 1990s, Volhynia has been an integral part of Ukraine.

Eighteenth century In the 18th and 19th centuries, coloured cockades were used in Europe to show the allegiance of their wearers to some political faction, or to show their rank or to indicate a servant's livery. Military uniforms would use cockades as well. A cockade was pinned on the side of a man's tricorne or cocked hat, or on his lapel. Women could also wear it on their hat or in their hair. In pre-revolutionary France, the cockade of the Bourbon dynasty was all white. In the Kingdom of Great Britain supporters of a Jacobite restoration wore white cockades, while the recently established Hanoverian monarchy used a black cockade. The Hanoverians also accorded the right to all German nobility to wear the black cockade in the United Kingdom. During the 1780 Gordon Riots in London, the blue cockade became a symbol of anti-government feelings and was worn by most of the rioters. During the American Revolution, the Continental Army initially wore cockades of various colors as an ad hoc form of rank insignia, as General George Washington wrote: Before long however, the Continental Army reverted to wearing the black cockade they inherited from the British. Later, when France became an ally of the United States, the Continental Army pinned the white cockade of the French Ancien R√©gime onto their old black cockade; the French reciprocally pinned the black cockade onto their white cockade, as a mark of the French-American alliance. The black-and-white cockade thus became known as the \\"Union Cockade\\". In the Storming of the Bastille, Camille Desmoulins initially encouraged the revolutionary crowd to wear green. This colour was later rejected as it was associated with the Count of Artois. Instead, revolutionaries would wear cockades with the traditional colours of the arms of Paris: red and blue. Later, the Bourbon white was added to this cockade, thus producing the original cockade of France. Later, distinctive colours and styles of cockade would indicate the wearer's faction; although the meanings of the various styles were not entirely consistent, and they varied somewhat by region and period. Cockades of the Confederate States Echoing their use when Americans rebelled against Britain, cockades ‚Äì usually made with blue ribbons and worn on clothing or hats ‚Äì were widespread tokens of Southern support for secession preceding the American Civil War of 1861‚Äì1865.http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/15/female-partisans/ New York Times blogs Cockades of the European military John VI of Portugal wearing the blue-and-red cockade of Portugal on a military cocked hat A metal cockade on the swivel of a Pickelhaube helmet. From the 15th century, various European monarchy realms used cockades to denote the nationalities of their militaries. Their origin reverts to the distinctive colored band or ribbon worn by late medieval armies or jousting knights on their arms or headgear to distinguish friend from foe in the field of battle. Ribbon-style cockades were worn later upon helmets and brimmed hats or tricornes and bicornes just as the French did, and also on cocked hats and shakoes. Coloured metal cockades were worn at the right side of helmets; while small button-type cockades were worn at the front of kepis and peaked caps. In addition to the significance of these symbols in denoting loyalty to a particular monarch, the coloured cockade served to provide a common and economical field sign at a time when the colours of uniform coats might vary widely between regiments in a single army. During the Napoleonic wars, the armies of France and Russia, had the imperial French cockade or the larger cockade of St. George pinned on the front of their shakos. The Second German Empire (1870‚Äì1918) used two cockades on each army headgear: one (black-white-red) for the empire; the other for one of the monarchies the empire was composed of, which had used their own colors long before. The only exceptions were the Kingdoms of Bavaria and W√ºrttemberg, having preserved the right to keep their own armed forces which were not integrated in the Imperial Army. Their only cockades were either white-blue- white (Bavaria) or black-red-black (W√ºrttemberg). The Weimar Republic (1919‚Äì1933) removed these, as they might promote separatism which would lead to the dissolution of the German nation-state into regional countries again. When the Nazis came to power, they rejected the democratic German colours of black-red-gold used by the Weimar Republic. Nazis reintroduced the imperial colours (in German: die kaiserlichen Farben or Reichsfarben) of black on the outside, white next, and a red center. The Nazi government used black-white- red on all army caps. These colours represented the biggest and the smallest countries of the Reich: large Prussia (black and white) and the tiny Hanseatic League city states of Hamburg, Bremen and L√ºbeck (white and red). France began the first Air Service in 1909 and soon picked the traditional French cockade as the first national emblem, now usually termed a roundel, on military aircraft. During World War I, other countries adopted national cockades and used these coloured emblems as roundels on their military aircraft. These designs often bear an additional central device or emblem to further identify national aircraft, those from the French navy bearing a black anchor within the French cockade. Hungarian revolutionaries wore cockades during the Hungarian revolution of 1848 and during the 1956 revolution. Because of this, Hungarians traditionally wear cockades on 15 March.

Since financial assets minus outstanding liabilities equal net financial assets, net worth can also be conveniently expressed as non- financial assets plus net financial assets. It can apply to companies, individuals, governments or economic sectors such as the sector of financial corporations or to entire countries. By entity =Companies= Net worth in business is also referred to as equity. It is generally based on the value of all assets and liabilities at the carrying value which is the value as expressed on the financial statements. To the extent items on the balance sheet do not express their true (market) value, the net worth will also be inaccurate. On reading the balance sheet, if the accumulated losses exceed the shareholder's equity, net worth becomes negative. Net worth in this formulation does not express the market value of a firm; a firm may be worth more (or less) if sold with a going concern. Net worth vs. debt is a significant aspect of business loans. Business owners are required to \\"trade on equity\\" in order to further increase their net worth. =Individuals= For individuals, net worth or wealth refers to an individual's net economic position: the value of the individual's assets minus liabilities. Examples of assets that an individual would factor into their net worth include retirement accounts, other investments, home(s), and vehicles. Liabilities include both secured debt (such as a home mortgage) and unsecured debt (such as consumer debt or personal loans). Typically intangible assets such as educational degrees are not factored into net worth, even though such assets positively contribute to one's overall financial position. For a deceased individual, net worth can be used for the value of their estate when in probate. Individuals with considerable net worth are described in the financial services industry as high-net-worth individuals and ultra high-net-worth individuals. In personal finance, knowing an individual's net worth can be important to understand their current financial standing and give a reference point for measuring future financial progress. =Governments= Balance sheets that include all assets and liabilities can also be constructed for governments. Compared with government debt, a government's net worth is an alternative measure of the government's financial strength. Most governments utilize an accrual-based accounting system in order to provide a transparent picture of government operational costs. Other governments may utilize cash accounting in order to better foresee future fiscal events. The accrual-based system is more effective, however, when dealing with the overall transparency of a government's spending. Massive governmental organizations rely on consistent and effective accounting in order to identify total net worth. =Countries= A country's net worth is calculated as the sum of the net worth of all companies and individuals resident in this country, plus the government's net worth. As for the United States, this measure is referred to as the financial position, and totaled $123.8 trillion as of 2014.Federal Reserve (2014-06-05). \\"Z.1 Financial Accounts of the United States - Flow of Funds, Balance Sheets, and Integrated Macroeconomic Accounts - First Quarter 2014\\" (PDF).

The EPRDF consisted of four political parties, namely Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), Amhara Democratic Party (ADP), Oromo Democratic Party (ODP) and Southern Ethiopian People's Democratic Movement (SEPDM). After leading the overthrow of the Communist People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, it dominated Ethiopian politics from 1991 to 2019. In November 2019, the EPRDF dissolved, and Prime Minister and EPDRF chairman Abiy Ahmed merged most of the constituent parties of the coalition (except the TPLF) into a new party called the Prosperity Party.Exclusive: Third day EPRDF EC discussing ‚ÄúProsperity Party‚Äù Regulation. Find the draft copy obtained by AS The party was officially founded on 1 December.  History  During the Ethiopian Civil War, the EPRDF was a rebel group battling the Derg, a military regime led by Mengistu Haile Mariam that was effectively in power from 1974 until it was replaced by the People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia in 1987. During this period, the Derg was responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands of opponents without trial in the Qey Shibir and the 1983‚Äì1985 famine in Ethiopia resulting in 400,000 deaths. The EPRDF was formed by the union of the TPLF and the Ethiopian People's Democratic Movement (EPDM) in early-1989. They were later joined by the OPDO (the Oromo members of the TPLF, EPLF, and EPDM) and the Ethiopian Democratic Officers' Revolutionary Movement (a small body of Derg officers captured by TPLF, most notably at Shire in February 1989, which was later disbanded after the establishment of the Transitional Government of Ethiopia).Vaughan, Sarah (2003). \\"Ethnicity and Power in Ethiopia\\" (PDF).

The other five regions of Ethiopia were governed by parties which were either created or heavily influenced by the EPRDF. One of the earliest was the Afar People's Democratic Organization in the Afar Region, which subsequently merged with other Afar political groups to create the Afar National Democratic Party (ANDP).Yasin, Yasin Mohammed (2008). \\"Political history of the Afar in Ethiopia and Eritrea\\" (PDF).

Its members held a variety of positions that could be broadly defined as being to the left of the opposition parties. The EPRDF traditionally identified itself with a number of general goals, namely rapid export-based economic growth; close cooperation with the United States in foreign and defense policies; close cooperation with China on economic and trade policies: and several newer issues, such as administrative reform. Administrative reform encompassed several themes, namely simplification and streamlining of government bureaucracy; privatization of state-owned enterprises; and adoption of measures, including tax reform, in preparation for the expected strain on the economy posed by a rapidly growing population. Other priorities in the early 1990s included the promotion of a more active and positive role for Ethiopia following the collapse of the People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, the internationalization of Ethiopia's economy by the liberalization and promotion of domestic demand (expected to lead to the industrialization) and the promotion of education. A business-inspired commitment to free enterprise was tempered by the insistence of protectionism and tariffs.

He was a member of the Whig Party in the parliament and was known for his wit and writing. Family Born the second son of Anthony Henley, Robert Henley was from a wealthy family in Hampshire. His grandfather, Sir Robert Henley, had been Master of the Court of the King's Bench, essentially a defence counsel. Henley's father Anthony Henley was educated at Oxford and interested in literature. When he moved to London, he became the friend of the Earls of Dorset and Sunderland, as well as a friend of Swift, Pope, and Burnet. After becoming a married man, Anthony Henley had been the Member of Parliament for Andover in 1698. He died in August, 1711 and was succeeded in turn by his eldest son, Anthony and his second son, Robert. Early life The Grange, Northington Henley was educated at Westminster School and attended St. John's College in Oxford. He gained a fellowship at the All Souls College in 1727, entered the Inner Temple to study law in 1729 and was called to the bar on 23 June 1732. He succeeded his elder brother in 1746, inheriting The Grange, Northington in Hampshire which had been built for his grandfather by Inigo Jones. Career He was elected a Member of Parliament for Bath in 1747 and became Recorder of the town in 1751. He was appointed Attorney General and knighted in 1756 and promoted the next year to Lord Keeper of the Great Seal, the last person to receive this title. Although as Lord Keeper he presided over the House of Lords, he was not made a peer until 1760 when he became Baron Henley of Grange in the County of Southampton. When George III ascended to power, Henley was appointed Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain in 1761 and made Earl of Northington in 1764. The delay in raising him to the peerage was due to the hostility of George II, who resented Henley's former support of the Prince of Wales's faction, known as the Leicester House party; and it was in order that he might preside as Lord High Steward at the trial of the Earl Ferrers for murder in 1760 that he then received his patent. He resigned from his position in 1767 and died at his residence in Hampshire on 14 January 1772. Personal life In 1743, Henley had married Jane Huband who was the daughter of Sir John Huband of Ipsley of Warwickshire. He had three sons and five daughters. The names of his daughters were: Lady Catherine Henley (d. 9 Jan 1779); Lady Bridget Henley (d. 13 March 1796), married 1) Robert Lane and 2) Capt. Hon. John Tollemache (30 March 1750 ‚Äì 25 September 1777); Jane Henley (d. February 1823); Lady Elizabeth Henley (d. 20 August 1821); Mary Henley (1753‚Äì1814), married 1) Edward Ligonier, 1st Earl Ligonier, and 2) Thomas Noel, 2nd Viscount Wentworth. He was succeeded by his son Robert Henley, 2nd Earl of Northington.

In 1806, Hesse-Homburg was incorporated with Hesse-Darmstadt; but in 1815, by the Congress of Vienna, the latter state was compelled to recognize the independence of Hesse-Homburg, which was increased by the addition of Meisenheim. The landgraviate of Hesse-Homburg consisted of two parts, the district of Homburg on the right side of the Rhine, and the district of Meisenheim, added in 1815, on the left side of the same river. Hesse-Homburg joined the German Confederation as a sovereign state on July 7, 1817. The Landgraviate was the only principality that was not one of the founding members of the Confederation, apart from the Duchy of Limburg ruled by the King of the Netherlands (added in 1839) and the Duchy of Schleswig (1848-1851) ruled by the Danish king. On 24 March 1866, Hesse-Homburg was inherited by the grand-duke of Hesse-Darmstadt, while Meisenheim fell to Prussia. On 20 September of that same year, these territories were taken from Hesse-Darmstadt again, and the former landgraviate was combined with the Electorate of Hesse- Kassel, duchy of Nassau, and the free city of Frankfurt to form the Prussian Province of Hesse-Nassau.

Apollonia (), known in the Early Islamic period as Arsuf () and in the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem as Arsur, was an ancient city on the Mediterranean coast of what is today Israel. In Israeli archaeology it is known as Tel Arshaf (). Founded by the Phoenicians during the Persian period in the late sixth century BCE, it was inhabited continuously until the Crusader period,History's Garbage Dump, Israel Antiquities Authority, August 2013. Accessed 17.9.2020. through the Hellenistic, Roman, and Byzantine periods, during the latter being renamed to Sozusa (, or Sozusa in Palaestina to differentiate it from Sozusa in Libya).Cohen, Getzel M., The Hellenistic Settlements in Syria, the Red Sea Basin, and North Africa (2006), p. 234. It was situated on a sandy area ending towards the sea with a cliff, about south of Caesarea. It fell to the Muslims in 640, was fortified against Byzantine attacks and became known as Arsuf. In 1101 it was conquered by the Kingdom of Jerusalem, and was a strategically important stronghold in the Third Crusade, during which the Battle of Arsuf (1191) was fought nearby. The fortified city and the castle fell to the Mamluks in 1265, when both were completely destroyed. The site of Arsuf (also Apollonia-Arsuf ) is now in Herzliya municipality, Israel (just north of Tel Aviv). The site was intensively excavated from 1994. In 2002 Apollonia National Park was opened to the public. Names The city is first recorded under its Greek name Apollonia in the final decades of the Persian period (mid-4th century BCE). In a long-standing suggestion, first proposed by Clermont-Ganneau in 1876, it was assumed that the Greek name was given due to the interpretatio graeca of the Canaanite deity Resheph (r≈°p) as Apollo (as god of the plague), suggesting that the settlement would originally have been a \\"Phoenician\\" foundation. The Semitic name r≈°p would then have been \\"restored\\" in the medieval Arabic toponym of Ars≈´f. There is indeed no archaeological evidence for a settlement prior to the Persian period, and Izre'el (1999) upholds this identification, suggesting that the Semitic name might have been preserved by the Aramaic-speaking Samaritan community. The Samaritan chronicle of Abu l-Fath (14th century, written in Arabic) records a toponym r ø≈°fyn (with ayin). Izre'el (1999) considers the possibility of identifying this toponym with the Arabic Ars≈´f, assuming that the ayin may derive from a mater lectionis used in Samaritan Aramaic orthography.Izre'el (1999:73) A tradition connecting the name with the biblical Resheph, a grandson of Ephraim, is spurious.\\"All these elements show that the relation between Resheph, Ephraim's descendent, and the Phoenician city of Arsuf should be rejected.\\" Maciej M. M√ºnnich, The God Resheph in the Ancient Near East (2013), p. 244. The name of the nearby Israeli settlement of Rishpon was given in 1936, inspired by a misreading of an inscription of Tiglath-Pileser III, where *ra≈°p≈´na was read for ka≈°p≈´na; recognition of the misreading rendered void the identification of Arsuf with a supposed Iron Age Phoenician settlement of *Ra≈°p≈´na.Izre'el (1999:72). The misreading was recognized in 1951. The renaming of Apollonia \\"city of Apollo\\" to Sozusa (Œ£œéŒ∂ŒøœÖœÉŒ± S≈çzousa) \\"city of the Saviour\\" took place in the Byzantine period, under the influence of Christianity as the state religion, motivated by Soter (Œ£œâœÑŒÆœÅ) \\"savior\\" being a byname of Apollo as well as of Christ. The renaming is paralleled in at least three other cities called Apollonia: Sozusa in Cyrenaica, Sozopolis in Pisidia and Sozopolis in Thrace. The identification of ancient Apollonia with Byzantine-era Sozusa is due to Stark (1852),Stark, K. B., Gaza und die Philist√§ische K√ºste, Jena (1852), p. 452, accepted by Clermont-Ganneau (1896:338): \\"[...] the noticeable fact remains that the town Apollonias-Arsuf, though of considerable importance, does not appear on the ecclesiastical lists, and that Sozousa is mentioned there in conjunction with Joppa, which would harmonize well enough with the geographic position of Arsuf.\\" that of medieval Arsuf with Apollonia/Sozusa to Clermont-Ganneau (1876). The site is variously referred to as Apollonia, Arsin, Arsuf, Arsuph, Arsur, Arsuth, Assur, Orsuf and Sozusa in Crusader-era documents, with a large dominance of \\"Arsur\\" among the secundary sources discussed by Schmidt.Schmidt, Otto Heinrich, Ortsnamen Pal√§stinas in der Kreuzfahrerzeit: Ortsnamenregister zu den Aufs√§tzen von Prutz, Beyer und Kob in der ZDPV 4‚Äì8, Zeitschrift des Deutschen Pal√§stina-Vereins (1953-), vol. 86, No. 2 (1970), pp. 117-164 (123). History Remains of the castle The dry moat of the castle =Antiquity= Although some Chalcolithic and Iron Age remains were uncovered at the site, there is no evidence that there was a settlement prior to the Persian period (ca. 500 BCE). While the importance of the town was overshadowed by both Jaffa and Caesarea, Apollonia developed into a regional center after the decline of its neighbouring site at Tel Michal in the Late Persian period, and was likely the main city and harbour in the southern Sharon Plain by the mid-4th century BCE. It is mentioned in the Periplus of Pseudo-Scylax.Edward Lipi≈Ñski, Itineraria Phoenicia (2004), p. 329. During the Hellenistic period it was a port town ruled by the Seleucids. Under Roman rule, the town prospered and grew into the chief commercial and industrial centre of the region between the Poleg and Yarkon rivers. In 113 CE, Apollonia was partially destroyed by an earthquake, but recovered quickly. Apollonia is mentioned by Pliny, Hist. nat., V, 14, and Ptolemy, V, xv, 2, between C√¶sarea and Joppa, and by other ancient authors, including Josephus, Ant. jud., XIII, xv, 4, Appianus, Hist. rom. Syr., 57. The Roman proconsul, Gabinius, found it ruined in 57 BCE, and had it rebuilt (Josephus, Bel. jud., I, viii, 4). Apollonia is depicted in the Tabula Peutingeriana, on the coastal highway between Joppa and Caesarea, at the distance of 22 miles from Caesarea, confirming the identification of Arsuf with Apollonia. There was no coin minting in Apollonia, confirming that the town did not have the role of a Roman provincial center but was rather considered a medium-sized coastal town like Jamnia and Azotus. Sozusa in Palaestina was the name of the city in the late Roman province of Palaestina Prima, and its episcopal see was a suffragan of Caesarea, the provincial capital. The name had changed from Apollonia to Sozusa before 449, when Bishop Baruchius signed the acts of the Robber Council of Ephesus with this title. \\"Baruchius episcopus Sozusae Palaestinae provinciae\\", \\"Baruchius episcopus Sozusenae civitatis\\", \\"Baruchius episcopus ecclesiae Sozusae\\" (E. Schwartz, Acta conciliorum oecumenicorum II.1.3 (1935), 183, 245, 255) The name Sozusa also occurs in the works of the Byzantine geographers Hierocles and George of Cyprus. Apart from Baruchius of 449, the names of two more of its bishops, Leontius in 518, and Damianus in 553, are also known. The death of patriarch Modestus in 630 in the city is recorded in both Georgian and Arabic texts, the Georgian texts using Sozos (for Sozusa) and the Arabic texts Arsuf, suggesting that both names remained in use for some time in the early medieval period.Roll, I. and Tal, O. (1999), introduction, citing Conybeare 1910:517; Garitte 1960:55, Peeters 1923-24:41; Garitte 1953:38, 70; 1974:131. During the Byzantine‚ÄìSasanian War of 602‚Äì628, the city surrendered on terms in 614 to Shahrbaraz and was in Sasanian hands until near the end of the war. =Early Muslim period= In 640, the town fell to the Muslims. The Arabic name Arsuf or Ursuf occurs in works of Arab geographers from the 10th century, e.g. Al- Muqaddasi said it was \\"smaller than Yafah, but strongly fortified and populous There is here a beautiful pulpit, made in the first instance for the Mosque of Ar Ramlah, but which being found too small, was given to Arsuf\\".Le Strange, 1890, p. p. 399. At the time of the Muslim conquest, Sozusa was inhabited by Samaritans.Izre'el (1999:64) In 809, following the death of Harun al-Rashid, the local Samaritan community was destroyed and their synagogue ruined. In 809 the Abbasids violently removed the large group of Samaritans that had been living in the city.Taragan (2004), p. 85, f.n. 5 quoting Moshe Gil, Palestine during the First Muslim Period (634‚Äì1099) (Tel-Aviv, 1983), p. 662. The town's area decreased to about and, for the first time, it was surrounded by a fortified wall with buttresses, to resist the constant attacks of Byzantine fleets from the sea. =Crusader to Mamluk period= Godfrey de Bouillon attempted to capture it, but failed for want of ships (William of Tyre, IX, x). King Baldwin I took it in 1102, after a siege by land and sea, allowing the inhabitants to withdraw to Ascalon. The Crusaders, who called it Arsur, rebuilt the city's walls and created the Lordship of Arsur in the Kingdom of Jerusalem. In 1187 Arsuf was recaptured by the Muslims, but fell again to the Crusaders on 7 September 1191 after the Battle of Arsuf, fought between the forces of Richard I of England and Saladin. John of Ibelin, Lord of Beirut became Lord of Arsuf in 1207 when he married Melisende of Arsuf. Their son John of Arsuf (d. 1258) inherited the title. The title then passed to John of Arsuf's eldest son Balian of Arsuf (d. 1277). He built new walls, the large castle and new harbor in 1241. In 1251 Louis IX of France re-erected its ramparts. From 1261, the city was ruled by the Knights Hospitaller. In 1225, Yakut wrote: \\"Arsuf remained in Muslim hands till taken by Kund Furi [Godfrey of Bouillon], lord of Jerusalem, in the year 494 [ AH 494, i.e. 1101 CE], and it is in the hand of the Franks [Crusaders] at the present day.\\" In 1265, sultan Baibars, ruler of the Mamluks, captured Arsuf after 40 days of siege,Gestes des Chiprois, Part III, p.117, ed. Gaston Raynaud, Gen√®ve, 1887: The year given by the chronicler known as the Templar of Tyre is 1265. after almost getting killed in the moat by a sortie of the defenders. The inhabitants were killed or sold as slaves and the town completely razed. The destruction was so complete that the site was abandoned and never regained its urban character - in the 14th century the geographer Abulfeda said it contained no inhabitants (\\"Tabula Syri√¶\\", 82). According to Mujir al-Din (writing c. 1496), the Sidna Ali Mosque just south of Arsuf was dedicated by Baibars at the site of a saint's tomb where he prayed for victory prior to retaking Arsuf.Taragan, Hana (2004): The Tomb of Sayyidna Ali in Arsuf: the Story of a Holy Place In JRAS (Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society), Series 4, 14, 2 (2004), pp. 83‚Äì102. In the Middle Ages, Sozusa was confused with Antipatris. The identity of Arsuf with ancient Apollonia was first noted by Clermont-Ganneau in 1876. =Ottoman period= Arsuf from the 1871-77 PEF Survey of Palestine In 1596, Ottoman tax registers recorded a village called Arsuf with 22 families and 4 bachelors, all Muslims. The villagers paid a total of 2,900 ak√ße in taxes. 1/3 the revenue went to a waqf: Hadrat 'Ali bin 'Ulaym.H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 140 It appeared, just named \\"village\\" on the map that Pierre Jacotin compiled during Napoleon's invasion of 1799.Karmon, 1960, p. 170 =Catholic titular see until 1965= Sozusa in Palaestina is listed as a titular see in the 2013 Annuario Pontificio.Annuario Pontificio 2013 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 ), p. 976 Due to the confusion with the other ancient city in classical Palestine known as Apollonia, it was also assigned under the name Antipatris. Its last titular bishop of the Latin Church was Francis Joseph McSorley, the Apostolic Vicar of Jolo (d. 1970). It has no longer been assigned since, in accordance with the practice established after the Second Vatican Council regarding all titular sees situated in what were the eastern patriarchates.Sozusa in Palaestina (catholic-hierarchy.org) =British Mandate and Israeli periods= The site was incorporated in Herzliya municipality in 1924. At the time, a village called al-Haram existed adjacent to the ruins, but it was depopulated during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, and the area south of the site was built up as the Shikun Olim ( \\"immigrant housing\\") district of Herzeliya in the 1950s. Rishpon was established in 1936 to the immediate north-east of the site. It is part of the Hof HaSharon Regional Council, Central District. Arsuf is a modern \\"exclusive clifftop community\\" named for Arsuf, built in 1995 north of the site, in Hof HaSharon Regional Council.Harriet Sherwood, Beny Steinmetz: Israeli diamond dealer who likes to keep a low profile, The Guardian, 30 July 2013. Archaeology The site of Apollonia‚ÄìArsuf was excavated in the 1990s and opened for visitors as Apollonia National Park in 2002. Excavations were ongoing as of 2015. The excavation report is prepared in three volumes, of which the first was published in 1999. The second and third volume, covering the excavation seasons until 2015, were in preparation as of 2016. The above- ground remains before the excavations included the medieval city wall and moat, enclosing an area of about 90 dunam, a Crusader castle with a double- wall system with an area of about 4 dunam, a port with built jetties and a sheltered anchorage, protected by a sandstone reef. Large amounts of pottery were recovered in the area surrounding the city, mostly of the Byzantine and early Islamic period, indicating that the city extended significantly beyond its old walls in the 7th century. A large Roman-era villa maritima was uncovered to the south of the site.

The town is on the River Cree with most of the town to the west of the river, and is sometimes referred to as the \\"Gateway to the Galloway Hills\\". The main local industries are agriculture, forestry and tourism. The town hosts a local market, and a number of services to support the farming industry. There are many mountain biking trails in the area. Newton Stewart lies on the southern edge of the Galloway Forest Park, which supplies many jobs to the town.

There is a local museum at St. John's Church, and a doll's house exhibition and a butterfly and tropical plant house nearby. The last two are no longer open for visitors. Newton Stewart is from Scotland's book town Wigtown. History The town was founded in the mid 17th century by William Stewart, fourth and youngest son of the 2nd Earl of Galloway. The \\"New Town of Stewart\\" was granted burgh status by charter from King Charles II, allowing a weekly market and two annual fairs to be held. It was on a pilgrimage to the shrine of St Ninian at Whithorn in 1329 that Robert the Bruce forded the river where the present bridge stands. Designed by John Rennie the Elder and built in 1813 the present bridge replaced the old bridge of 1745 which was destroyed by floods in 1806. The industrialist Sir William Douglas (died 1809), best known for founding the planned town of Castle Douglas, also established cotton mills in Newton Stewart, which was renamed \\"Newton Douglas\\" in his honour but soon reverted to Newton Stewart.

The population according to the 1991 census for Port Glasgow was 19,426 persons and in the 2001 census was 16,617 persons. The most recent census in 2011 states that the population has declined to 15,414. It is located immediately to the east of Greenock and was previously a burgh in the county of Renfrewshire. Originally a fishing hamlet named Newark, Port Glasgow came about as a result of large ships being unable to navigate the shallow and meandering River Clyde to the centre of the city of Glasgow. As a result, it was formed as a remote port for Glasgow in 1668, and became known as 'New Port Glasgow', which was shortened to 'Port Glasgow' in 1775. Port Glasgow was home to dry docks and shipbuilding beginning in 1762. The town grew from the central area of the present town and thus many of the town's historic buildings and people are found here. Port Glasgow expanded up the steep hills inland to open fields where areas such as Park Farm, Boglestone, Slaemuir and Devol were founded. This area has subsequently become known as upper Port Glasgow and most of the town's population occupies these areas. History Clyde. The origins of Port Glasgow go back to the construction by Sir George Maxwell between 1450 and 1477 of the \\"New Werke of Finlastoun\\", which became Newark Castle. At a good anchorage near the castle, a small fishing hamlet known as Newark formed, like other scattered hamlets along the shores of the River Clyde. After 1589 the village of Greenock formed just under to the west of Newark, and gradually became a market town with growing fishing and sea trade, although it had only a jetty in the bay to unload ships. Since seagoing ships could not go further up the Clyde due to sandbanks, the Glasgow merchants such as the Tobacco Lords wanted harbour access, but got into arguments with Greenock over harbour dues and warehouses. They put a bid in for the Easter Greenock estate for a harbour, but were outbid and the lands became the Barony of Cartsburn. They then negotiated with Sir Patrick Maxwell of Newark Estate, and in 1668 he agreed to lease the City of Glasgow of land to the west of the castle, for payment of 1,300 merks and an annual feu duty of four merks. Construction of piers and breakwaters enclosing the harbour began promptly, and Newport Glasgow was constituted as a free port. Trade prospered quickly, and by 1710 Newport Glasgow had the principal Clyde custom house, initially in Customhouse Lane, then after 1754 in a new building constructed on the west quay of the harbour. Through that century the town became known simply as Port Glasgow. Ships, mostly owned by Glasgow merchants, imported tobacco, sugar, rum, cotton and mahogany from the Americas, as well as timber, iron and hemp from the Baltic. These goods were then taken by road to Glasgow, as was market garden produce from farms around Port Glasgow. A change began in 1773 when the Lang Dyke was constructed to deepen the upper river, and ships increasingly went upriver straight to Glasgow. In 1830, the custom house collected ¬£243,349 3s 1d in revenue, but after that income from the port declined, while by then Greenock had its own custom house. After 1693, the grid-iron street layout, which still forms much of the town centre today, was laid out. =Shipbuilding= In 1780, Thomas McGill set up one of the first shipyards in the area, located near to Newark castle. By the 19th century, Port Glasgow had become a centre of shipbuilding. The Comet was built in the town in 1812 and was the first commercial steam vessel in Europe. A replica of the Comet was built in 1962 to mark the 150th anniversary. It, and a plaque commemorating the actual site of construction, were situated in Port Glasgow town centre in the early 1970s. PS Comet, Europe's first commercially successful steamboat, was built in Port Glasgow, and a replica of her made by shipyard apprentices now stands in the town centre. Port Glasgow became a burgh in 1833, but around this time, the River Clyde up to Glasgow was deepened and new road and rail links meant that the town was no longer needed much as a port. The shipbuilding industry then took over as the main source of employment and prosperity. Port Glasgow has been responsible for about a quarter of the total tonnage of ships launched on the Clyde, and also dealt in scrapping old ships, most notably the French liner L'atlantique, the burnt out wreck of which was broken up in the yard of Smith & Houston. However, as with most of Inverclyde's industry, the shipbuilding industry has all but gone and only Ferguson Marine Engineering remains in the town today. Ferguson's is one of the last remaining privately owned shipyards in Scotland. Ferguson's yard changed ownership in 2014 had undergone extensive renovation and modernisation, which had resulted in the demolition of most of the buildings on the site for brand new modern ones and a more open front entrance.

Both stations are on the electrified Inverclyde Line, which has frequent services to the termini at Glasgow Central, Gourock and Wemyss Bay. All trains stop at Port Glasgow; Woodhall has a less frequent service. From 1869 to 1959, the town was also served by rail at Port Glasgow Upper railway station on the Greenock and Ayrshire Railway. This station was later demolished. The town is connected to nearby Glasgow by the A8 dual carriageway and the M8 motorway.

The west wing. Newark Castle stands very close to the shore of the Clyde, and dates to around 1484. It was home to the Maxwell Family until 1694. By 1800, the castle was surrounded by shipyards, but today only Ferguson's shipyard remains, standing immediately to the west of the castle. A park and waterfront walkway have been constructed to the east, on the site of Lamont's shipyard and Smith & Houston's shipbreaking yard. The castle is now a visitor attraction maintained on behalf of the nation by Historic Scotland. =Parklea= About a mile upstream from the castle and its surrounding park, several acres of the Clyde foreshore at Parklea are owned by the National Trust for Scotland. For many years, the land has been leased to the local council as playing fields. When the NTS acquired the land, it was regarded as protecting the foreshore from the widespread acquisition by shipyards. However, this did not prevent the construction of extensive timber ponds along this stretch of the river.

The park was opened on the site of the West Harbour in 1937 to celebrate the coronation of King George VI. It was expanded in the 1960s when the East Harbour and Wet Dock were filled to make way for the new A8 dual carriageway, which also cut through part of the original park. As such, the war memorial which once stood at an entrance to the park is now isolated on the town side of the A8. There are still traces of the old harbours and dockside warehouses to be found in the vicinity of the park. There is also an old steam hammer located at the east end of the park. There are playgrounds for toddlers and older children within the park. There is also free to use a public boat slip with a car park and good access from the A8. The park has extensive views of the widening River Clyde and the south Highlands. Perch lighthouse is located just offshore from the park, this marks a sharp bend in the navigable channel to the Upper Clyde and Glasgow.

The team returned \\"home\\" to a new stadium at Parklea, Port Glasgow in 2012, following a spell playing their home games in nearby Greenock. Parliamentary representation Port Glasgow was a parliamentary burgh as part of the Kilmarnock Burghs constituency from 1832 to 1918, when it was merged into the West Renfrewshire constituency. From 1974 to 1997, it was part of the Greenock and Port Glasgow constituency.

Richard Bethell, 1st Baron Westbury, (30 June 1800 ‚Äì 20 July 1873) was a British lawyer, judge and Liberal politician. He served as Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain between 1861 and 1865. He was knighted in 1852 and raised to the peerage in 1861. Background and education Born at Bradford on Avon, in Wiltshire, he was the eldest son of the physician Richard Bethell of Bristol and Jane (n√©e Baverstock). He was from an old Welsh family originally named Ap Ithel. His younger brother was John Bethell. He was educated in Bath and Bristol before attending Wadham College, Oxford at only 14 years old. He received a scholarship the next year. He took first-class honors in classics and second class in mathematics, and he graduated as a Bachelor of Arts in 1818 and was elected a fellow of his college. In 1823, Bethell was called to the bar at the Middle Temple. Career Westbury was made a Queen's Counsel in 1840 was appointed vice- chancellor of the County Palatine of Lancaster in 1851. His most important public service was the reform of the then existing mode of legal education, a reform which ensured that students before call to the bar should have at least some acquaintance with the elements of the subject which they were to profess. In 1847, he ran unsuccessfully for Parliament; contesting Shaftesbury, he lost to Whig politician Richard Brinsley Sheridan. He was successful in his second attempt in 1851, when he was elected for Aylesbury. Attaching himself to the liberals, he became Solicitor General in 1852, on which occasion he was made a Knight Bachelor. He was nominated Attorney-General in 1856 and again in 1859, serving both times for two years. He represented Wolverhampton from 1859‚Äì61. On 26 June 1861, on the death of Lord Campbell, he was appointed Lord Chancellor and raised to the peerage as Baron Westbury, of Westbury, in the County of Wiltshire. Owing to the reception by parliament of reports of committees nominated to consider the circumstances of certain appointments in the Leeds Bankruptcy Court, as well as the granting a pension to a Mr Leonard Edmunds, a clerk in the patent office, and a clerk of the parliaments, the Lord Chancellor felt it incumbent upon him to resign his office, which he accordingly did on 5 July 1865, and was succeeded by Robert Rolfe, 1st Baron Cranworth. After his resignation he continued to take part in the judicial sittings of the House of Lords and the Privy Council until his death. In 1872 he was appointed arbitrator under the European Assurance Society Act 1872. Character Perhaps the best known of his decisions was the judgment delivering the opinion of the judicial committee of the privy council in 1863 against the heretical character of certain extracts from the well-known publication Essays and Reviews. His principal legislative achievements were the passing of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1857, and of the Land Registry Act 1862 (generally known as Lord Westbury's Act), the latter of which in practice proved a failure. What chiefly distinguished Lord Westbury was the possession of a certain sarcastic humour; and numerous are the stories, authentic and apocryphal, of its exercise. In fact, he and Sir William Henry Maule filled a position analogous to that of Sydney Smith, convenient names to whom good things may be attributed. Family Lord Westbury married Ellinor Mary, daughter of Robert Abraham, in 1825. His younger brother John married another daughter of Abraham, Louisa Sarah, in 1833. They had four sons and four daughters: *Ellen (1826‚Äì1880) *Eliza (1828‚Äì1916) *Richard Augustus, 2nd Baron (1830‚Äì1875) *Slingsby (1831‚Äì1896) *Arthur Howard (1833‚Äì1834) *Emma Louisa (1835‚Äì1877) *Augusta (1839‚Äì1931) *Walter John (1842‚Äì1907) After Ellinor Mary's death in March 1863, Richard Bethell married Eleanor Margaret, daughter of Henry Tennant, in January 1873. After an illness, Westbury died six months later on 20 July 1873, within a day of the death of Bishop Samuel Wilberforce, his special antagonist in debate. He was buried in the Great Northern Cemetery (now the New Southgate Cemetery). He was succeeded in the barony by his son from his first marriage, Richard, who committed suicide two years later. Lady Westbury died in December 1894.

It was founded as a classical liberal party but later developed a more social-democratic tradition, joining the Socialist International in 1999. The Liberal Party was the dominant force in Colombian politics alongside the Colombian Conservative Party until 2002, when the election victory of independent candidate √Ålvaro Uribe put an end to dominance of two party politics in Colombia. Currently, the Liberal Party is the second largest party in Congress, and has formed a coalition with the Social Party of National Unity, the governing party in Colombia under the presidency of Juan Manuel Santos.  History  The party was founded in 1848 and, in opposition to the Colombian Conservative Party, became one of the two main political forces in the country for over a century. In the 1940s, the liberal party turned towards socialism under the influence of the charismatic lawyer Jorge Eli√©cer Gait√°n, despite the antipathy it provoked among party members and liberal leaders. In the rural area, Gaitanism faced a bloody repression to which its scrupulous respect for legality did not prepare it: 15,000 militants were murdered between 1945 and 1948 by death squads supposedly close to the conservatives. Gait√°n himself, who was a likely winner of the next presidential election, was shot down in 1948. After the period known as La Violencia the Liberals and the Conservative Party reached an agreement to share power from 1958 to 1974 in the so-called National Front agreement that followed the fall of General Gustavo Rojas Pinilla. Nowadays there are many critics of the 16-year agreement but it greatly reduced the intensity of the violent political warfare that preceded it. Following the end of the National Front agreement in 1974, the Liberal Party dominated Colombian politics until 2002; Liberal candidates won five of the seven Presidential elections and the party was the largest in both the Chamber of Representatives and Senate throughout the entire period. In the 1994 election the Liberal Party's Ernesto Samper was narrowly elected President. Immediately afterwards he was accused of accepting millions from the Cali Cartel to fund his campaign. While Samper had immunity to prosecution as President, a number of his close associates were convicted of involvement in the so-called Proceso 8000 scandal, including Defence Minister Fernando Botero Zea. Partly due to the scandal the Liberal Party lost seats in the 1998 parliamentary election, although it remained easily the largest party. More seriously, the Liberals were defeated in the Presidential election held the same year. The Liberal Party suffered a major split in the lead up to the 2002 elections. Horacio Serpa Uribe, the party's unsuccessful 1998 Presidential candidate was nominated to run again. However √Ålvaro Uribe, a former Senator and Governor from the party launched an independent Presidential campaign, backed by the Conservatives and dissident Liberals. Whereas Serpa supported the then ongoing negotiations with FARC, Uribe advocated confronting the guerrillas. Uribe was victorious in the elections, securing a majority in the first round. In the aftermath, the \\"Government endorsed\\" leadership of the party continued to oppose Uribe's administration, but many Senators and Representatives supported the government, becoming known as the \\"Uribist\\" faction. As a compromise, former president C√©sar Gaviria Trujillo was elected party leader in 2005. At the 2006 legislative election, the Liberals lost around half their seats. While they remained the largest party in the Chamber of Representatives, they finished third in the Senate. Horacio Serpa was again nominated as the Liberal candidate for the subsequent presidential elections of 28 May 2006 and won 11.84% of the popular vote, placing him third, the worst ever result for a Liberal candidate. During the parliamentary elections of 14 March 2010, the Liberal Party obtained 17 senators and 37 representatives, placing third in both the Chamber of Representatives and Senate. At the 2010 presidential election Liberal candidate Rafael Pardo finished sixth with 4.38% of the vote. The Liberal Party went on to join the governing coalition of President Juan Manuel Santos.

It describes the tenuous peace that existed between the two countries as a result of both governments being terrified at the prospect of a world-destroying nuclear war. The term is usually used for rhetorical purposes, and was probably coined by Lester Pearson in June 1955 at the 10th anniversary of the signing of the UN Charter: \\"the balance of terror has succeeded the balance of power\\".A. J. C. Edwards, Nuclear Weapons, the Balance of Terror, the Quest for Peace (London: Palgrave Macmillan, 1986), p. 238n. Some political scientists use this phrase as a means of differentiating the world situation that followed World War II from that which preceded it. Previously, empires had prevented war between each other by maintaining a relative balance of their ability (economic, military, and political) to wage war against each other‚Äîthe phrase \\"balance of power\\" was often used to describe this kind of tentative peace. The atomic bomb created a new political reality, in which two superpowers had the ability to destroy each other and at least gravely damage all of human civilization. The obstacle to war between the communists and capitalists was no longer the fear that the other side was more powerful, but rather the realization that nuclear arsenals were now large enough and deadly enough that winning would still likely result in the destruction of one's own country and perhaps the rest of the world as well. In this counterintuitive way, the existence of the most powerful weapons ever created actually supported a kind of peace: while many wars were fought around the world during the Cold War, the superpowers never fought each other directly, nor have atomic bombs been dropped in war since the atomic bombing of Nagasaki in 1945. Lawrence Summers, after the financial meltdown of 2008, adopted the term as appropriate for the situation of a 'financial balance of terror' in global markets. Uses *John F.

Its leader is former Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. It has been a powerful force in Haitian politics since 1991. Fanmi Lavalas governments advocate a policy of \\"growth with equity\\" based on Caribbean and Western European social democratic principles. Fanmi Lavalas governments have emphasised investment in education and health care as their priorities and have refused International Monetary Fund austerity measures. History The term Lavalas and the social movement associated with it, were popularized as part of Jean Bertrand Aristide's election campaign in 1990. The establishment of the Lavalas movement as a formal political party, renamed Fanmi Lavalas, took place in 1996 as a split by Aristide from the Struggling People's Party (OPL) over the question of his resumption of the three years he lost in exile following the 1991 coup Two main reasons for its creation are known: (1) to allow the Lavalas movement to remain inclusive while opposing the neo-liberal policies of the foreign-influenced OPL, which was one of the conditions for Aristide's return to power in 1994; (2) to prevent rival politicians from taking over the movement's leadership from Aristide and other more left-wing leaders. The Haitian military overthrew Aristide's first government in 1991. \\"Fanmi Lavalas\\" may be roughly translated into English as \\"Avalanche Family\\" or \\"Waterfall Family\\" (referring to the Biblical flood), but the name is almost never completely translated from Haitian Creole, although it is sometimes given as \\"Lavalas Family\\". It was registered officially as a political party on 30 October 1996, and on 14 February 1997 it was recognized by the electoral authorities. Elections were set for 2006 by the Interim Government, which was established by the governments of Canada, the US, and France. Certain members of Fanmi Lavalas claimed that Marc Bazin was the Lavalas candidate. However, its grassroots supporters overwhelmingly supported Ren√© Garcia Pr√©val in his campaign as president. Lavalas candidates boycotted the election for the most part, but its voters supported the emergence of Preval's Lespwa party. The results of the election of the 7 February and 21 April 2006 Chamber of Deputies are not available. =Election exclusion= The performance of the Fanmi Lavalas party in Haitian elections has been difficult to measure since the 2004 coup d'√©tat that toppled it from power as it has been repeatedly excluded from the democratic process.US lawmaker criticizes Haiti election exclusions It was again excluded from participation in the 2010‚Äì2011 Haitian general election by the electoral council after the candidates did not receive the necessary votes.Haitian President Marks Independence With Pledge of Fair Elections, Voice of America =2015 presidential and legislative election= CEP accepted Lavalas' request to contest election in the 2015 election.

The party's legislature candidates received 5 seat out of 85 already elected seats in the 2015 parliamentary election, a second round will be held in December 27.

The program's final episode aired May 18, 2012. History =Early history= Originally, the program aired live on the ABC network and featured a live studio audience. The first interviews included Roseanne Barr and a piece on a Middle East hostage crisis reported by Chris Wallace. Donaldson and Sawyer would allow audience members to comment on the program and ask questions of the guests, who were usually interviewed live via satellite or in studio, a practice that resulted in many technical difficulties and easy satirization on Saturday Night Live. Internal conflicts between Sawyer and Donaldson later led them to be separated, and the audience eliminated. However, the program has always had some live elements when broadcast as Primetime Live, generally consisting of Donaldson reading the opening remarks of packaged stories and the opening title as Primetime... LIVE!. Over time, live interviews were de-emphasized and hidden camera investigations began to occupy more of the schedule. =Cancellation and changes= In 1998, ABC, in an effort to consolidate all of their news magazines, canceled Primetime Live and combined it with ABC's other well-known news magazine, 20/20. The move was made to compete more effectively with NBC's Dateline, which ran multiple nights of the week. In 2000, however, ABC relaunched the program. It was renamed Primetime Thursday with Charles Gibson replacing Donaldson. In 2003, ABC aired a short-lived 2003 continuation of the newsmagazine 20/20 Downtown as Primetime Monday. Beginning in the 2004-2005 season, the show was known once again as Primetime Live. Its pair of co-hosts from the previous four seasons, Charles Gibson and Diane Sawyer, was replaced by the rotating team of Sawyer, David Muir, Chris Cuomo, Cynthia McFadden and John Qui√±ones. The format shifted back to investigative reporting and a new executive producer was brought on board. On July 21, 2005, the show's title was changed to Primetime. Beginning in the 2006‚Äì2007 television season, the news magazine adopted a subseries format, where multiple episodes would be focused on one topic such as crime and medical mysteries, with no set weekly timeslot. Sawyer departed the program around the time this change in format occurred, though she occasionally anchored special editions of Primetime. David Muir joined as co-anchor in 2007. What Would You Do? has become the most popular sub-series and can be regularly seen on ABC, often with a set timeslot. In 2011 ABC aired a special edition of Primetime: an interview by Diane Sawyer with Jaycee Dugard. In 2012, beginning with the sixth season, the Primetime branding was removed from the What Would You Do? show. It still airs sans branding and is anchored by Qui√±ones. The branding has not been used by any program or special since this time. =Food Lion scandal= One hidden camera investigation, of Southeast grocery chain Food Lion, backfired on ABC when Food Lion sued. Food Lion sued for trespass and breach of loyalty, claiming that the report was produced under deceptive pretenses, and ABC employees hired by Food Lion wearing hidden cameras filmed other Food Lion employees without following proper notification procedures. Food Lion did not sue for libel, as the one-year statute of limitations had already run by the time it received all the footage shot by ABC, and prior to receiving the footage, its attorneys believed it would be difficult to prove that ABC acted with actual malice. A jury awarded Food Lion $5.5 million, but later appeals by ABC to the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals resulted in the damages reduced to $2.00. This scandal resulted in Food Lion closing stores in brand-new markets in Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Delaware and Pennsylvania, cancelling expansion into states like Illinois, Missouri, and Kansas, as well as bad publicity and a downturn in profit for the company. =Awards= 2005 Pigasus Award by James Randi Educational Foundation for ABC's Primetime Live for its credulous \\"John of God\\" special, about Brazilian \\"psychic surgeon\\" Jo√£o Teixeira Formats Formats of Primetime include: * Primetime Monday: A short-lived 2003 continuation of the newsmagazine 20/20 Downtown. * Primetime: What Would You Do?: Hidden camera program featuring artificial situations in public and social settings designed to gauge the reaction (or lack thereof) of regular citizens. * Primetime: Basic Instincts: Followed the same format as What Would You Do?, but in more of a controlled test setting. * Primetime: Medical Mysteries: Basic format reporting on cases of mysterious ailments. * Primetime: The Outsiders: Human interest format involving subjects with odd habits or standards of living. * Primetime: Crime: Branding for episodes revolving around a full criminal case, including arrest, trial and aftermath. * Primetime: Mind Games: Investigative series revolving around psychology and other studies with heavy skepticism around them, such as magicians and televangelists. * Primetime: Family Secrets: Summer series revolving around famous family conflicts, both celebrity and criminal. * Primetime: Would You Fall for That?: Summer series with an emphasis on vulnerability and credulity from the public. * Primetime: Beyond Belief: A 2011 special five-part series that delved into paranormal and unexplained phenomena.

Grant, 18th President of the United States, and his wife, Julia Grant. It is a classical domed mausoleum, located in the Morningside Heights neighborhood of Upper Manhattan in New York City. The structure is located in the middle of Riverside Drive at 122nd Street, across from Riverside Church to the southeast and Riverside Park to the west. Upon Grant's death in 1885, his widow declared that he had wished to be buried in New York, and a new committee, the Grant Monument Association, appealed for funds. Progress was slow at first, since many believed that the tomb should be in Washington, D.C., and because there was no architectural design to show. Eventually they selected a proposal by John Hemenway Duncan for a tomb of \\"unmistakably military character,\\" modeled after the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus, with twin sarcophagi based on Napoleon‚Äôs tomb at Les Invalides. The tomb was completed in 1897, and has been under the management of the National Park Service since 1958. After a period of neglect, it has been restored and rededicated. Grant's Tomb is open to the public from Wednesdays through Saturdays. In addition to being a national monument since 1958, Grant's Tomb was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1966 and was designated an official New York City landmark in 1975. History =Creation of Grant Monument Association= On July 23, 1885, Grant died of throat cancer at age 63 in Wilton, New York. Within hours of Grant's death, William Russell Grace, the Mayor of New York City, sent a telegram to Julia offering New York City to be the burial ground for both Grant and Julia. Grant's only real wish when he died was to be next to his wife when he was buried. In practice this eliminated all military cemeteries and installations (such as West Point) from consideration, as they did not permit women to be interred at the time. Grant's family agreed to have his remains interred in New York City. Grace wrote a letter to prominent New Yorkers the following day, to gather support for a national monument in Grant's honor: The preliminary meeting was attended by 85 New Yorkers who established the Committee on Organization. Its chairman was former President Chester A. Arthur; its secretary was Richard Theodore Greener. The organization would come to be known as the Grant Monument Association (GMA). Funding The Grant Monument Association did not originally announce the function or structure of the monument; however, the idea of any monument in Grant's honor drew public support. Western Union donated $5,000 on July 29, the day the committee announced its proposal. The GMA continued to receive donations of large and small amounts. At a membership meeting, former New York State governor Alonzo Cornell proposed a fundraising goal of $1 million. Private industries such as insurance and iron-trading companies donated funds to the project. For every ton of coal the Consumers Coal Company sold, it gave a major donation of 37¬Ω cents to the GMA. Although there was great enthusiasm for a monument to President Grant, early fundraising efforts were stifled by growing negative public opinion expressed by out-of-state press. The Clay County Enterprise in Brazil, Indiana, wrote, \\"We have not a cent for New York in the undertaking, and would advise that not a dollar of help be sent to the millionaire city from Indiana ... If the billions of New York are not sufficient to embellish the city ... let the remains be placed in Washington or some other American city.\\" (September 11) The opposition was vocal in the view that the monument should be in Washington, D.C. Mayor Grace tried to calm the controversy by publicly releasing Mrs. Grant's justification for the New York site as the resting place for her husband: Criticism was not limited to the debate about the monument's location. According to The New York Times, there was discontent with the internal management of the GMA. Even though the GMA members were among the wealthiest in New York, they were making comparatively small donations to the effort they themselves were promoting. The New York Times characterized the members as \\"sitting quietly in an office and signing receipts for money voluntarily tendered.\\" In this early stage, the GMA did not have a model for what the monument was to be; it continued to ask for donations without explaining its purpose, which frustrated and discouraged donors. Joan Waugh captured the feelings of the average citizen in her book, American Hero American Myth: \\"Why should citizens give money to build a monument whose shape was still a mystery?\\" The GMA did not propose a definitive plan for the monument until five years later. During its first few years, the GMA fell short of the fundraising expectations originally set by Alonzo Cornell. In the first year, 1885, the GMA raised just over $111,000, 10% of its goal. In the two years that followed, it raised just $10,000. The slow pace of fundraising caused some trustees to resign. No design for the structure yet existed, and without such a design, it was believed that fundraising efforts would continue to remain low. =Design competition= On February 4, 1888, after a year's delay, the GMA publicly announced the details of a design competition, in a newsletter entitled \\"To Artists, Architects, and Sculptors\\". This information was made public to the entire nation; it was also published in Europe. The GMA also proposed a new estimate for the monument's cost, which ranged from $500,000 to $1 million. The deadline for all designs was rescheduled three times and was then set for a final date of January 10, 1889. The first design competition received 65 designs, 42 of which came from international entries. The Grant Memorial Association did not award an overall winner, and a second design competition was ordered. In April 1890, the Grant Memorial Association selected, from only five commissioned entries, the design of John Hemenway Duncan, who estimated his design would cost between $496,000 and $900,000. Duncan made his first architectural claims in 1883, designing the Washington Monument at Newburgh, the Newburgh Monument, and the Tower of Victory. Duncan built these structures to celebrate the centennial anniversary of the U.S. Revolutionary War, and he became a member of the Architectural League in 1887. Duncan cited as his design's objective: \\"to produce a monumental structure that should be unmistakably a tomb of military character.\\" He wanted to avoid \\"resemblance of a habitable dwelling\\" as the structure was meant to be the epitome of reverence and respect. The tomb's granite exterior is modeled after the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus with Persian elements and but for the Ionic order of the exterior rotunda columns and the Doric columns of the porch, it resembles the Tropaeum Alpium. Within the tomb, the twin sarcophagi of Grant and his wife Julia are based on the sarcophagus of Napoleon Bonaparte at Les Invalides. =Construction= By 1890, the GMA had a defined design and architect. Although the GMA was becoming more organized and the reality of the monument was becoming clearer, the debate over the monument's location reopened in Congress. In October 1890, U.S. Senator Hale introduced legislation to have the sarcophagi placed at a monument in Washington, DC. The legislation did not pass, but the effort reopened the debate over the proper place for the remains of Grant. A groundbreaking ceremony had already been scheduled for April 27, 1891, and although the parties had not agreed on a location for the monument by that date, a groundbreaking ceremony was still held. In June 1891, deliberations ended; the monument was to be built in New York City, and that month, the GMA hired a contractor named John T. Brady. Construction began that summer, and by August, preliminary excavation was complete. Construction was on schedule until the GMA asked Duncan to alter his design in the spring of 1892; the design could not be as elaborate as originally planned because of the Association's inability to raise the sufficient funds. Construction was also slowed by a stonecutters' strike in 1892. After 1894, construction proceeded at a faster pace, and by 1896, work on the outside of the tomb was nearly complete. One innovative feature of the tomb construction is the use of Guastavino tile vaulting to support the circular floor above the perimeter of the downstairs atrium. On April 17, 1897, Grant's remains were quietly transferred to an 8.5-ton red granite sarcophagus and placed in the mausoleum. The monument was dedicated ten days later on April 27, 1897, on the 75th- anniversary ceremony of Grant's birth on April 27, 1822. Julia Dent Grant, Grant's wife of nearly 40 years, died five years later in 1902 and was placed in a matching sarcophagus and laid to rest in the mausoleum beside her husband. =Decay and restoration=  1930s restoration  The initial restoration project began in December 1935 (38 years after the tomb opened), when Works Progress Administration laborers installed new marble flooring in the atrium. The WPA played a large role in sustaining the monument. Joan Waugh explains that \\"In the 1930s the tomb was barely maintained by funds from the Works Progress Administration.\\" Shortly after the restoration project began, the old New York City Post Office was being demolished and donated two statues of eagles to decorate the front of the Grant Monument. The laborers of the WPA worked on several projects throughout the 1930s, including roof restoration, electric lighting and heating systems, and removing the purple stained glass windows. The Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company installed amber glass to replace the purple stained glass. Toward the end of the 1930s, a project began to restore the two reliquary rooms, where battle flags were displayed in trophy cases, and murals of the wars Grant had fought in were painted on the walls. In 1938, the Federal Art Project selected artists William Mues and Jeno Juszko to design the busts of William T. Sherman, Phillip H. Sheridan, George H. Thomas, James B. McPherson, and Edward Ord. The WPA installed five busts in the circular wall of the atrium surrounding the sarcophagi. After the many contributions of the WPA, the Grant Monument Association held a re-dedication of the tomb on April 27, 1939.  NPS control  Grant's Tomb, interior detail In 1958, the National Park Service (NPS) was granted authority to oversee the monument. According to an NPS report, an historian admitted that when the NPS first assumed authority over the tomb, they \\"had no program for the site.\\" Combined with the mismanagement and devastation that New York City was going through financially in the 1960s to the 1990s, that led to great neglect of the site, particularly in the maintenance of the monument. By the 1970s, the tomb was marred by vandalism and graffiti. Many places in the city, including Times Square, were in the same condition. Trash had heaped up around the monument, its exterior recesses were being used by drug users, the homeless, and criminals for hideouts. Graffiti covered the walls and pedestals, and vandals chipped away at the masonry. The NPS undertook a plan to remove the trophy cases in the reliquary rooms.  1990s restoration  The abuse of the monument continued until renewed restoration efforts began in the early 1990s; in 1991, Frank Scaturro, a student at Columbia University and volunteer with the NPS, launched an effort to restore the tomb and brought his concerns to Congress. The tomb was still marred by graffiti and, at the time, there were only three maintenance workers and three rangers on daytime duty, with a yearly budget of $235,000. For over two years, Scaturro battled the National Park Service, which was charged with maintaining Grant's Tomb. He sent weekly memos, including a 26-page report in the summer of 1992. After two years of unsuccessful attempts to navigate the bureaucracy of the National Park Service, Scaturro published a 325-page whistleblower report, which he sent to Congress and the President. Scaturro's efforts drew national media attention and resulted in a $1.8 million grant to restore Grant's Tomb. According to Mr. Scaturro \\"whistle-blowing was the last resort.\\" Scaturro stated \\"I only did what I did because I had no other resort ... the only thing left was abandoning the site and that was not an alternative to me.\\" The tomb was in great need of renovation. A New York Times article articulated Mr. Scaturro's concerns, saying \\"improvements have detracted from the tomb's solemnity.\\" Tomb on map in 1916 Scaturro's efforts to expose the monument's poor condition caught the attention of two Illinois state lawmakers. State Sen. Judy Baar Topinka and State Rep. Ron Lawfer sponsored a resolution to compel the National Park Service to meet its obligations in maintaining and restoring Grant's tomb. If the NPS did not comply, then Topinka and Lawfer demanded that Grant's remains be transported to the state of Illinois. Senator Topinka said, \\"He would be better off anywhere than New York, but my argument is not with New York; it's with the National Park Service.\\" The demands for restoration did not stop at the state level. In 1994, the U.S. House of Representatives introduced legislation to \\"restore, complete, and preserve in perpetuity the Grant's Tomb National Memorial and surrounding areas.\\" The legislation set by the House required that the restoration be completed by April 27, 1997, the tomb's 100th anniversary and Grant's 175th birthday.Grant's Tomb National Memorial Act of 1994, H.R. 4393, 103d Cong., 2nd session (May 11, 1994). On April 27, 1997, the restoration effort sanctioned by Congress was completed and the tomb re-dedicated. General Grant's descendants, who were appalled by the conditions of the tomb, called Scaturro a hero for his efforts. Access and policies sarcophagi of Ulysses and Julia Grant The visitor center is located about 100 yards to the west of the mausoleum and contains a bookstore, memorabilia, movie about Grant's life, and restrooms. The visitor center of General Grant National Memorial is accessible to people with disabilities, but the mausoleum is not.

Examples include Jazzmobile, Inc.'s annual Free Outdoor Summer Mobile Concerts at Grant's Tomb and the annual Grant's Tomb SUMMER CONCERT, which in 2009 featured West Point's United States Military Academy Band. Every year on April 27, the anniversary of Grant's birth, a ceremony celebrating his life is held at the memorial. The back (north) side of Grant's Tomb =Art= A sculpture consisting of seventeen concrete benches bearing colorful mosaics was created around the monument in the early 1970s. The sculpture, entitled The Rolling Bench, was designed by artist Pedro Silva and the architect Phillip Danzig, and was built with the help of hundreds of neighborhood children over a period of three years. The project was sponsored by CITYarts, a non-profit organization founded in 1968 to create works of public art by bringing together children and artists. The sculpture underwent restoration during the summer of 2008 under the supervision of Silva. According to NYC Parks, \\"some popular local folk art in Riverside Park contrasts strikingly with the Tomb's severity\\".

However, Marx often accepted the answer \\"Grant,\\" nonetheless, and awarded a consolation prize to those who gave it. He used the question, among several other easy ones, to ensure that everyone won a prize on the show.Marx, Arthur (1960). Life with Groucho.

He was one of the most prominent Conservative statesmen in the House of Lords during this period of Victorian politics. He served as the seventeenth Chancellor of the University of Dublin between 1867 and 1885. Background and education Cairns was born at Cultra, County Down, Ireland. His father, William Cairns, formerly a captain in the 47th regiment, came from a family of Scottish origin which moved to Ireland around 1715. Hugh Cairns was the second son, and was educated at Belfast Academy and at Trinity College Dublin, graduating with a senior moderatorship in classics in 1838. In 1844 he was called to the Bar by the Middle Temple, to which he had moved from Lincoln's Inn. Legal and political career During his first years at the Chancery Bar, Cairns showed little eloquence. He was so slow and diffident that he feared for his legal career. However, in 1852, he entered parliament as member for Belfast, and he became a QC in 1856. In 1858 Cairns was appointed Solicitor-General and was knighted, and in May of that year made two of his most brilliant and best- remembered speeches in the House of Commons. In the first, he defended the action of Lord Ellenborough, who, as President of the Board of Control, had not only censured Lord Canning for a proclamation issued by him as Governor- General of India but had made public the despatch in which the censure was conveyed. On the other occasion referred to, Cairns spoke in opposition to Lord John Russell's amendment to the motion for the second reading of the government Reform Bill, winning the approval of Benjamin Disraeli. Disraeli's appreciation found an opportunity for displaying itself some years later, when in 1868 he invited him to be Lord Chancellor in the brief Conservative administration which followed Lord Derby's resignation of the party leadership. Meanwhile, Cairns had maintained his reputation in debate, both when his party was in power and when it was in opposition. In 1866 Lord Derby, returning to office, appointed Cairns Attorney General, and in the same year he had availed himself of a vacancy to seek the comparative rest of the Court of Appeal. While a Lord Justice he had been offered a peerage, and though at first unable to accept it, he had finally done so when a relative provided the means necessary for the endowment of a title. The appointment of Baron Cairns as Lord Chancellor in 1868 meant superseding Lord Chelmsford, an act apparently carried out by Disraeli with little tact. Chelmsford declared that he had been sent away with less courtesy than if he had been a butler, but the testimony of Lord Malmesbury is that the affair was the result of an understanding arrived at when Lord Chelmsford took office. Disraeli held office on this occasion for only a few months. In 1869, Cairns succeeded Lord Malmesbury as the leader of the Conservative opposition in the House of Lords. Lord Cairns as Lord Chancellor, by Lowes Cato Dickinson. He had distinguished himself in the Commons by his resistance to the Roman Catholics Oath Bill brought in 1865; in the Lords, his efforts on behalf of the Irish Church were equally strenuous. His speech on Gladstone's Suspensory Bill was afterwards published as a pamphlet, but the attitude which he and the peers who followed him had taken up, in insisting on their amendments to the preamble of the bill, was one difficult to maintain, and Lord Cairns made terms with Lord Granville in circumstances which precluded his consulting his party first. He issued a circular to explain his action. The incident appears to have demonstrated his statesmanship, for he secured concessions which would have been irretrievably lost by continued opposition. Not long after this, Lord Cairns resigned the leadership of his party in the upper house, but resumed it in 1870 and opposed the Irish Land Bill in that year. Upon the Conservatives' return to power in 1874, he again became Lord Chancellor; in 1878 he was created Viscount Garmoyle and Earl Cairns; and in 1880 his party went out of office. In opposition he did not take as prominent a part as previously, but when Disraeli (by then created Earl of Beaconsfield) died in 1881, there were some Conservatives who considered that his claim to lead the party was better than that of Lord Salisbury. His health, never robust, had for many years shown intermittent signs of failing. He had periodically made enforced retirements to the Riviera, and for many years had had a house at Bournemouth, and it was there that he died. Lord Cairns was a great supporter of Barnardo's and was called upon by Dr. Thomas John Barnardo to open his first girl's home at Barkingside, Ilford, Essex, on 9 July 1876. Today Cairns house still stands on the one remaining green at Barkingside which was built by the children of England in memory of the First President of Dr Barnardo's Homes, The Right Honourable Earl Cairns. Cairns House was officially opened 6 August 1887. Legacy Lord Cairns in the 1860s. Of his legal attainments there can be no doubt. His influence upon the legislation of the day was largely felt where questions affecting religion and the Church were involved and in matters peculiarly affecting his own profession. His power was felt, as has been said, both when he was in office and when his party was in opposition. He had been chairman of the committee on judicature reform, and although he was not in office when the Judicature Acts were passed, all the reforms in the legal procedure of his day owed much to him. He took part, when out of office, in the passing of the Married Women's Property Act 1882, and was directly responsible for the Conveyancing Acts, and for the Settled Land Act. Many other statutes in which be was largely concerned might be quoted. His judgments are to be found in the Law Reports and those who wish to consider his oratory should read the speeches above referred to, or that delivered in the House of Lords on the Compensation for Disturbance Bill in 1880, and his memorable criticism of Mr Gladstone's policy in the Transvaal, after Majuba Hill. Family Lord Cairns married in 1856 Mary Harriet, eldest daughter of John McNeill, of Parkmount, County Antrim, by whom he had five sons and two daughters. He was succeeded in the earldom by his second but eldest surviving son, Arthur William Cairns, who left one daughter, and from whom the title passed to his two next younger brothers in succession, Herbert John Cairns, third Earl (1863‚Äì1905), and Wilfred Dallas Cairns, fourth Earl (1865‚Äì1946).

Early life Horne was born at Edmonton, London, son of James Horne, a quarter-master in the 61st Regiment. The family moved to Guernsey, where James was stationed, until James' death on 16 April 1810.Blainey (1963), p. 6. Horne was raised at the home of his rich paternal grandmother and sent to a school at Edmonton and then to the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, as he was intended for the army. Horne appears to have had as little sense of discipline as Adam Lindsay Gordon showed at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, and like him was asked to leave. It appears that he caricatured the headmaster, and took part in a rebellion. He began writing while still in his teens, but he was intended for the army, and entered at Sandhurst, but receiving no commission, he left his country and in 1825 went as a midshipman in the Libertad to fight for Mexican independence, was taken prisoner and joined the Mexican navy. He served in the war against Spain, travelled in the United States and Canada, returned to England in 1827, and took up literature as a profession. Archive at National Library of Australia (nla.gov.au) [NLA]. Early career Horne was employed by Charles Dickens on Household Words in 1849 Horne became a journalist, and from 1836 to 1837 edited the Monthly Repository. In 1837 he published two tragedies, Cosmo de' Medici and The Death of Marlowe. Another drama in blank verse, Gregory VII, appeared in 1840, and in 1841 a History of Napoleon in prose. About the end of 1840 Horne was given employment as a sub-commissioner in connection with the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Children's Employment which particularly focused the employment of children in mines and manufactures. This commission finished its labours at the beginning of 1843, and in the same year Horne published his epic poem, Orion, which appeared in 1843. It was published originally at the price of one farthing, was widely read; three editions were published at that price, and three more at increased prices before the end of the year. In the next year he set forth a volume of critical essays called A New Spirit of the Age, in which he was assisted by Elizabeth Barrett Browning, with whom, from 1839 to her marriage in 1845, he conducted a voluminous correspondence. In 1847 Horne married Catherine Foggo (daughter of David Foggo) but they were soon separated. In December 1849 Horne's acquaintance Charles Dickens gave him a position as a sub-editor on his new weekly magazine Household Words at a salary of \\"five guineas a week\\".Blainey 1963, 179. In 1852 with Horne's marriage failing and being discontented with his work on Household Words, he decided to emigrate to Australia. Australia In June 1852 Horne migrated to the Colony of Victoria in Australia, travelling as a passenger on the same ship as William Howitt and arriving in Melbourne in September. With assistance from Captain Archibald Chisholm (husband of Caroline Chisholm, a contributor to Household Words), he was given a position as commander of a gold escort.Blainey 1963, 196‚Äì97. It was later reported that on the first trip of the escort under Horne's command they returned to Melbourne with \\"two tonnes weight of gold\\". Archive at NLA. The escort was robbed in 1853 and Horne wrote to The Argus with his recollections of George Melville, the bushranger convicted of the crime and hanged. Archive at NLA. In 1854 he was a Goldfields Commissioner at the Waranga goldrush (during the Victorian gold rush) and named the township of Rushworth. During his time there he also reached a peaceful settlement with over 4,000 gold miners who had rioted over the payment of their mining license fee and, in his memoirs, stated that he believed this action, in light of the events at the Eureka Stockade a few months later, was never adequately recognised. During his time at Rushworth, as part of a \\"foolhardy business transaction\\", Horne had invested in blocks of land at nearby Murchison on the Goulburn River.Blainey 1963, 219. But as \\"the village grew slowly\\" he was eager to \\"promote any venture which might bring prosperity to the district\\" and joined with his friend, Rushworth storekeeper Ludovic Marie in establishing a vineyard on the river near Nagambie. The two set up a public company, the Goulburn Vineyard Proprietary, with Marie as manager and Horne as honorary secretary. A third partner \\"died mysteriously in the Melbourne scrub\\" but the venture lasted and still exists as the Tahbilk winery. The venture didn't compensate Horne for the money he had lost in an early public float but he later claimed \\"he was the father of the Australian wine industry\\". In 1856, he was an unsuccessful candidate for the Victorian Electoral district of Rodney.Blainey 1963, 211. In his platform of policies was an ambitious proposal for an irrigation system, which was realised with the construction of the Waranga Basin in the 1900s. Following Waranga, Horne acted as a \\"counsel's clerk to his friend, Mr Mitchie\\". Archive at NLA. Horne became a commissioner of the Yan Yean water-supply on 18 April 1857. It is unfortunate that his lively Australian Autobiography, prefixed to his Australian Facts and Prospects published in 1859, abruptly breaks off about 1854‚Äì55. From among the Commissioners he was elected President of the Victorian Sewerage and Water Commission. Archive at NLA. He lost the position \\"as a consequence of departmental changes\\" and was promised another \\"by successive Governments\\" however this did not eventuate. He \\"wasted three years and upwards, in fruitless expectation\\", and, with his capital tied up in Goulburn River investments, he applied to the Royal Literary Fund, of London, where he \\"was at once recognised, and a handsome assistance transmitted to him by return mail\\". While in Australia Horne brought out an Australian edition of Orion (1854), Archive at NLA. and in 1864 published his lyrical drama Prometheus the Fire-bringer. Archive at NLA. Another edition, printed in Australia, came out in 1866. Also published in 1866 were The South Sea Sisters, a Lyric Masque, for which Charles Horsley (then living in Melbourne) wrote the music. It was sung at the opening of the 1866 intercolonial exhibition. Along with such literary figures as Henry Kendall, Adam Lindsay Gordon, George Gordon McCrae and Marcus Clarke he was a member of the Yorick Club where members met and discussed literature. Horne was the founding President of Melbourne's Garrick Club in the 1850s Archive at NLA. and at a charitable theatrical fundraiser in 1855 \\"kindly consented to sing a Spanish Romansa and Serence\\" between the two short plays. Archive at NLA. London and later life In 1860 Horne was again unemployed. In 1869, \\"dissatisfied with the failure of the Victorian government to fulfil what he conceived to be its obligations to him\\", he returned to England. A later memoria of Horne notes that after his return from Australia he settled in \\"poor quarters in Marylebone\\" and \\"ill at ease in London\\" his health suffered. This included \\"a melancholy increase in weight\\" that resulted in \\"V-shaped additions\\" having to be added to his trousers to accommodate his girth. However, courtesy of his physician, Dr. Bird, of Welbeck Street, his health returned and one day two ladies entering the Doctor's practice \\"were startled to see an old gentleman sliding headfirst down the banisters. This was Mr. Horne celebrating his return to health.\\" Archive at NLA. During the 15 years after his return to England, Horne published several books ‚Äì but the only one which aroused much interest was not written by him, the Letters of Elizabeth Barrett Browning to Richard Hengist Horne. Horne received a Civil List pension of ¬£50 a year in 1874 (increasing to ¬£100 in 1880) and died at Margate on 13 March 1884; leaving behind him much unpublished work. A more complete list of Horne's published work will be found in the British Museum catalogue. Legacy and Influence Horne possessed extraordinary versatility, but, except in the case of Orion, he never attained to a very high degree of distinction. That poem, indeed, has much of the quality of fine poetry; it is earnest, vivid and alive with spirit. But Horne early drove his talent too hard, and continued to write when he had little left to say. In criticism he had insight and quickness. He was one of the first to appreciate Keats and Tennyson, and he gave valuable encouragement to Mrs. Browning when she was still Miss Elizabeth Barrett. Hornes's epic poem, Orion was reprinted by the Scholartis Press in 1928.National Union Catalog, v.254, p134, citing the Library of Congress copy of the 10th edition of 1874. He has been the subject of two biographies: * Always morning: the life of Richard Henry \\"Orion\\" Horne by Cyril Pearl (1960) * The farthing poet: a biography of Richard Hengist Horne, 1802‚Äì84; a lesser literary lion by Ann Blainey (1960) References * External links  Category:1802 births Category:1884 deaths Category:British emigrants to Australia Category:Graduates of the Royal Military College, Sandhurst Category:People from Edmonton, London Category:English male poets Category:19th-century English poets Category:19th-century British male writers ","title":"Richard Henry Horne"},{"id":"406061","text":"A Roy Rogers is a non-alcoholic mixed drink made with cola and grenadine syrup, garnished with a maraschino cherry.

Howitt Primary Community School in Heanor, Derbyshire, is named after him and his wife. Biography Howitt was born at Heanor, Derbyshire. His parents were Quakers, and he was educated at the Friends public school at Ackworth, Yorkshire. His younger brothers were Richard and Godrey whom he helped tutor. In 1814 he published a poem on the Influence of Nature and Poetry on National Spirit. He married, in 1821, Mary Botham, who like himself was a Quaker and a poet. William and Mary Howitt collaborated throughout a long literary career, the first of their joint productions being The Forest Minstrels and other Poems (1821). In 1831, William Howitt produced a work resulting naturally from his habits of observation and his genuine love of nature. It was a history of the changes in the face of the outside world in the different months of the year, and was entitled The Book of the Seasons, or the Calendar of Nature (1831). His Popular History of Priestcraft (1833) won him the favour of active Liberals and the office of alderman in Nottingham, where the Howitts had made their home. They moved in 1837 to Esher, and became friends with Elizabeth Gaskell and her husband. 1838 saw publication of his Colonization and Christianity, which was later quoted approvingly by Karl Marx in Capital, Volume I.The passage, which is used in chapter 31 of Volume I, is from p. 9 of Colonization and Christianity: \\"The barbarities and desperate outrages of the so-called Christian race, throughout every region of the world, and upon every people they have been able to subdue, are not to be paralleled by those of any other race, however fierce, however untaught, and however reckless of mercy and of shame, in any age of the earth.\\" In 1840 they went to Heidelberg, primarily for the education of their children, remaining in Germany for two years. In 1841 William Howitt produced, under the pseudonym of Dr Cornelius, The Student Life of Germany, the first of a series of works on German social life and institutions. Mary Howitt devoted herself to Scandinavian literature, and between 1842 and 1863 she translated the novels of Frederika Bremer and many of the stories of Hans Christian Andersen. In 1847 Howitt published the 'Homes and Haunts of the most Eminent British Poets' with the publisher Richard Bently. The Preface to the Second Edition dated 1847, and referring to careful revision of the work is included in the third edition, published by George Routledge & Sons in 1877, suggesting there were either two editions in 1847, or the first edition was earlier. With her husband she wrote in 1852 The Literature and Romance of Northern Europe. In June of that year William Howitt, with two of his sons, set sail for Australia, where he spent two years in the goldfields. The results of his travels appeared in A Boy's Adventures in the Wilds of Australia (1854), Land, Labour and Gold; or, Two Years in Victoria (1855) and Tallangetta, the Squatter's Home (1857). On his return to England Howitt had settled at Highgate and resumed his indefatigable book- making. From 1856 to 1862 he was engaged on Cassell's Illustrated History of England, and from 1861 to 1864 he and his wife worked at the Ruined Abbeys and Castles of Great Britain. The Howitts had left the Society of Friends in 1847, and became interested in Spiritualism. In 1863 he published The History of the Supernatural in all Ages and Nations, and in all Churches, Christian and Pagan, demonstrating a Universal Faith. He added his own conclusions from a practical examination of the higher phenomena through a course of seven years. From 1870 onwards Howitt spent the summers in Tyrol and the winters in Rome, where he died. In 1880 Mary Howitt had a house built for her (which is still standing) in the spa town of Meran in South Tyrol (then part of Austria) and from then on divided her time between Rome and Meran. Mary Howitt was much affected by William's death, and in 1882 she joined the Roman Catholic Church, towards which she had been gradually moving during her connection with spiritualism. She died at Rome on 30 January 1888. The Howitts are remembered for their untiring efforts to provide wholesome and instructive literature. Their son, Alfred William Howitt, made a name for himself by his explorations in Australia. Anna Mary Howitt was both an artist and a poet, and married Alaric Alfred Watts.Anna Mary Howitt's ODNB entry: Retrieved 9 July 2011. Subscription required. Mary Howitt's autobiography was edited by her daughter, Margaret Howitt, in 1889. William Howitt wrote some fifty books, and his wife's publications, inclusive of translations, number over a hundred.

The result of an extraterrestrial virus's exposure to a laser beam, Deoxys frequently appears around auroras. It is recognized as a Mythical Pok√©mon of the third generation. It exists in four forms: Attack, Defense, Speed, and Normal, which differ by base stat values, effort value yield, and appearance. Originally, there was no Speed Forme; this was added after the movie. Deoxys first appeared in the 2002 video games Ruby and Sapphire, accessible via a Nintendo promotional event. It played a major role in the film Pok√©mon: Destiny Deoxys later that year. It has since appeared in several video games and the Pok√©mon anime series. The Pok√©mon has also been featured in official merchandise and a collaboration with NASA, and has received positive remarks from critics. Design and characteristics Deoxys's arms resemble the double helix structural form. Along with all the other third- generation Pok√©mon, Deoxys was created by Ken Sugimori with the aid of a development team. Its National Pok√©dex number is 386, the last of the third- generation Pok√©mon. Its name is contracted from the term deoxyribonucleic acid, the long-form name of DNA. The character is associated with auroras, and frequently appears with them. It is recognized as a Legendary Pok√©mon throughout the franchise, though today it is recognized as a Mythical Pok√©mon. Deoxys emerged from The universe. It has a crystalline organ on its chest which is considered to serve as its brain and can regenerate its body from almost any attack. and can also eject lasers. Overall, it has an agile body configured for speed. Deoxys is unique among Pok√©mon for its ability to change freely between Formes, of which it has four: Attack, Defense, Speed, and Normal. These Formes differ by base stat values, effort value yield, and appearance. In the Game Boy Advance games, Deoxys's Forme depends on the game version it is used in. Meanwhile, Deoxys's Forme is changed in later games by having it in the player's party and interacting with certain meteorites. Appearances =In the games= Deoxys made its gaming debut is in 2002's Pok√©mon Ruby and Sapphire. Deoxys would not legitimately be made public until Pok√©mon FireRed and LeafGreen. After visiting a Nintendo promotional event, the player activates the \\"Mystery Gift\\" gameplay option, then visits an in- game Pok√©Mart location and inputs the text \\"LINK TOGETHER WITH ALL\\" on a questionnaire. Once you have typed it in, you could download the Aurora Ticket at an event. This unlocks an island where the Pok√©mon is found, Birth Island. The player must follow a triangle at a specific path and once it turns red, a Level 30 Deoxys will appear. Deoxys introduces its Attack Forme in FireRed, Defense Forme in LeafGreen, and then its Speed Forme in Emerald. Deoxys was distributed to Diamond and Pearl players at GameStop locations in June 2008. Deoxys, in its Attack Forme, appears as a randomly generated Pok√©mon springing from the Pok√© Ball item and attacking players in the fighting game Super Smash Bros. Brawl. Deoxys also returns in Super Smash Bros. for 3DS and Wii U as a random generated Pok√©mon from a Master Ball. In both games, it'll use the move Hyper Beam. The character's likeness also graces a trophy in this game. Pok√©mon Ranger: Guardian Signs features a mission accessed with Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection that allows the player to obtain a Deoxys and carry it over to other Pok√©mon games. In Pok√©mon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, Deoxys is available within the game without the need for event distribution. Deoxys is available at the end of the Delta Episode after beating the game for the first time. The player must first capture Rayquaza at Sky Pillar at Level 70 to progress with the story line. After capturing Rayquaza, the player is taken into space to stop an incoming meteor. As soon as it is destroyed, Deoxys's famous triangle can be seen performing the same pattern that the player on Pok√©mon FireRed and Pok√©mon LeafGreen has to perform to summon Deoxys. This time around Deoxys is at level 80 and at par with Arceus for the highest level legendary (mythical) Pok√©mon encountered on any game in the Pok√©mon series. Should the player fail to capture Deoxys, then the player will be given a second and final chance to capture it. The player must defeat the Elite Four for the 2nd time. After this, the player must return to Sky Pillar. At the same spot where Rayquaza was caught, Deoxys will be waiting there instead and once again at Level 80. Deoxys also appears in the mobile game Pok√©mon Go, where it is obtainable through special events known as \\"EX Raids\\". =In other media= Deoxys's Pok√©mon anime canonical debut is in the 2004 film Pok√©mon: Destiny Deoxys. A mysterious green crystalline organ fell to earth in a meteorite which later turned into a Deoxys. A second Deoxys (with a purple crystalline organ) came to earth to search for it but ended up in a battle with Rayquaza. As Pok√©mon Emerald had not been released when the movie was produced, only its Defense, Normal and Attack Formes appeared. A Deoxys appears in each of its Formes in the episode \\"Cheers on Castaways Isle!\\". The creature crashes into a waterfall, becoming nothing but its crystalline core. It later regenerates to save Ash Ketchum and Piplup from Team Rocket before flying away again. In Pok√©mon Adventures Deoxys plays a major role in the events of the FireRed & LeafGreen chapter. One set of Pok√©mon trading cards is named \\"Deoxys EX\\", created as an homage to Destiny Deoxys. Deoxys's Attack, Normal, and Defense Formes each occupy separate cards in this set. The three have different attacks and can be switched for each other each turn via their \\"Forme Change\\" abilities. Cultural impact Deoxys's likeness has been adapted into merchandise such as action figures, lunch boxes, and promotional plush pillows. A \\"Deoxys Whirl\\" toy was distributed with kids' meals at Subway chain restaurants from March to May 2005, as part of the promotional campaign for Destiny Deoxys. In March 2005, NASA teamed up with the Pok√©mon Trading Card Game team to use Deoxys's likeness to educate children about outer space and the ozone layer. As part of this endeavor, NASA created browser games on its website and Nintendo of America distributed promotional bracelets and postcards. The character has received positive remarks from critics. In coverage of Super Smash Bros.

In the context of the stage musical, the song is sung by Samuel Pickwick, when he is mistaken for an election candidate and called on by the crowd to give his manifesto. Ornadel and Bricusse received the 1963 Ivor Novello award for Best Song Musically and Lyrically.Lister, David, Pop ballads bite back in lyrical fashion, The Independent, 28 May 1994 The song is usually associated with Sir Harry Secombe, who got the song to No 18 in the UK charts in 1963. Tony Bennett originally recorded the song in 1965, and had a number 34 hit with it on the U.S. pop singles charts. With Celine Dion, he returned to the song on his Grammy-winning 2006 album Duets: An American Classic. It has been performed by other singers, notably Nancy Wilson, Robert Goulet, James Brown, Stevie Wonder, The Supremes, Tom Jones and Regina Belle. Andy Hallett, the actor best known for playing the part of Lorne ('The Host') in the television series Angel, sang the song in that series' final episode. The politician-spoofing BBC panel show If I Ruled the World was named after the song. This song was featured in Spring/Summer 2009 on the Vodafone adverts in the UK. Jamie Cullum also recorded a version for his album The Pursuit, and performed it at his special performance at the Late Night Prom, number Prom 55, of The Proms in London, with The Heritage Ensemble, on Thursday 26 August 2010 between 22:15 and 13.45.

The award for Best Musical Album for Children was first presented to producer Alan Menken and Tim Rice in 1994 for the soundtrack to the Disney film Aladdin. The award was discontinued from 2012 in a major overhaul of Grammy categories. Starting in 2012, this category merged with the Best Spoken Word Album for Children category to form the new Best Children's Album category. This merger meant essentially returning to the categorization set-up prior to 1994 (although with a small name change), when recordings for children was covered by the Grammy Award for Best Album for Children alone.

Its headquarters are located in central Paris and it is under the supervision of the French Ministries of Defence and Research. It operates from the Toulouse Space Center and Guiana Space Centre, but also has payloads launched from space centres operated by other countries. The president of CNES is Jean-Yves Le Gall. CNES is member of Institute of Space, its Applications and Technologies. , CNES has the second largest national budget‚Äî‚Ç¨2.438 billion‚Äîof all the world's civilian space programs, after only NASA.  History  CNES was established under President Charles de Gaulle in 1961. CNES was responsible for the training of French astronauts, until the last active CNES astronauts transferred to the European Space Agency in 2001. , CNES is working with Germany and a few other governments to start a modest research effort with the hope to propose a LOX/methane reusable launch vehicle by mid-2015. If built, flight testing would likely not start before approximately 2026. The design objective is to reduce both the cost and duration of reusable vehicle refurbishment, and is partially motivated by the pressure of lower-cost competitive options with newer technological capabilities not found in the Ariane 6. = Summary of major events = CNES facility in Toulouse * 1947: CIEES/Hammaguir missile range and launch facility built for the French military in French Algeria.Maurice Va√Øsse (dir.), La IVth R√©publique face aux probl√®mes d'armement, proceedings of the conference held on 29 and 30 September 1997 at the Military Academy of the Center for Defense of studying history, ed.

Commercial competition in space is fierce, so launch services must be tailored to space operators' needs. The latest versions of the Ariane 5 launch vehicle can launch large satellites to geosynchronous orbit or perform dual launches‚Äîlaunching two full-size satellites with one rocket‚Äîwhile the other launch vehicles used for European payloads and commercial satellites‚Äîthe European/Italian Vega and Russian Soyuz-2‚Äîare small and medium-lift launchers, respectively. =Sustainable development= CNES and its partners in Europe‚Äîthrough the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security initiative (GMES)‚Äîand around the world have put in place satellites dedicated to observing the land, oceans, and atmosphere, as well as to hazard and crisis management. The best-known are the SPOT satellites flying the Vegetation instrument, the Topex/Poseidon, Jason-1 and Jason-2 oceanography satellites, the Argos system, Envisat, and the Pleiades satellites. =Civil applications= CNES is taking part in the Galileo navigation programme alongside the European Union and the European Space Agency (ESA), and‚Äîin a wider international context‚Äîin the Cospas-Sarsat search-and-rescue system. =Security and defense= The aforementioned Galileo navigation programme, though intended primarily for civilian navigational use, has a military purpose as well, like the similar American Global Positioning System and Russian GLONASS satellite navigational systems. In addition to Spot and the future Pleiades satellites, CNES is working for the defence community as prime contractor for the Helios photo-reconnaissance satellites. Global Monitoring for Environment and Security‚Äîa joint initiative involving the EU, ESA, and national space agencies‚Äîpools space resources to monitor the environment and protect populations, though it also encompasses satellite support for armed forces on border patrol, maritime security, and peacekeeping missions. =Ongoing missions= France's contribution to the International Space Station is giving French scientists the opportunity to perform original experiments in microgravity. CNES is also studying formation flying, a technique whereby several satellites fly components of a much heavier and complex instrument in a close and tightly-controlled configuration, with satellites being as close as tens of meters apart. CNES is studying formation flying as part of the Swedish-led PRISMA project and on its own with the Simbol-x x-ray telescope mission. CNES currently collaborates with other space agencies on a number of projects, including orbital telescopes like INTErnational Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory, XMM-Newton, and COROT and space probes like Mars Express, Venus Express, Cassini-Huygens, and Rosetta. CNES has collaborated with NASA on missions like the Earth observation satellite PARASOL and the CALIPSO environment and weather satellite. It has also collaborated with the Indian Space Agency (ISRO) on the Megha-Tropiques Mission, which is studying the water cycle and how it has been impacted by climate change. CNES plays a major role in the ESA's Living Planet Programme of Earth observation satellites, having constructed the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity satellite. =UFO Archive= In December 2006, CNES announced that it would publish its UFO archive online by late January or mid-February. Most of the 6,000 reports have been filed by the public and airline professionals. Jacques Arnould, an official for the French Space Agency, said that the data had accumulated over a 30-year period and that UFO sightings were often reported to the Gendarmerie. In the last two decades of the 20th century, France was the only country whose government paid UFO investigators, employed by CNES's UFO section GEPAN, later known as SEPRA and now as GEIPAN. On March 22, 2007, CNES released its UFO files to the public through its website. The 100,000 pages of witness testimony, photographs, film footage, and audiotapes are an accumulation of over 1,600 sightings since 1954 and will include all future UFO reports obtained by the agency, through its GEIPAN unit.

He served as Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain for fourteen years and under four Prime Ministers.  Early life Born at Bracon Ash, Norfolk, Thurlow was the eldest son of Reverend Thomas Thurlow. Thomas Thurlow, Bishop of Durham, was his brother. He studied at King's School, Canterbury and at Caius College, Cambridge. However, he was forced to leave Cambridge in 1751 without a degree after coming into conflict with the authorities of the university. He was for some time articled to a solicitor in Lincoln's Inn, but in 1754 he was called to the Bar, Inner Temple. After a slow start, Thurlow eventually established a successful legal practice. He was made a King's Counsel in 1761 and was elected a bencher of the Inner Temple in 1762.  Political career Lord Chancellor Thurlow In Sin, Death, and the Devil (1792), James Gillray caricatured the political battle between Pitt (Death) and Thurlow (Satan), with Queen Charlotte (Sin) in the middle, protecting Pitt. Thurlow then turned to politics, and in 1768 he was elected Member of Parliament for Tamworth as a Tory. Two years later, as a recognition of his defence the previous January of the expulsion of John Wilkes he was appointed Solicitor-General in the government of Lord North. He held this post until 1772, when he was promoted to Attorney General. He was to remain in this office for six years, during which period he became known as an ardent opponent of the American colonists' strive for independence. He is noted for his defeat in the case of Woodfall, who was publisher of the Letters of Junius, upon which a verdict of mistrial was entered by Lord Mansfield. In 1778 Thurlow was admitted to the Privy Council, raised to the peerage as Baron Thurlow, of Ashfield in the County of Suffolk, and appointed Lord Chancellor by Lord North. In this post he notably opposed the economical and constitutional reforms proposed by Edmund Burke and John Dunning. The Tory administration of Lord North fell in March 1782, after twelve years in office. The Whigs under Lord Rockingham came to power, but Thurlow managed to cling on as Lord Chancellor. Rockingham died in July 1782, but Thurlow remained Lord Chancellor also when Lord Shelburne became Prime Minister. The latter government fell in April 1783, when a coalition government under Charles James Fox and Lord North was formed (with the Duke of Portland as titular Prime Minister). Thurlow was not invited to resume the role of Lord Chancellor, and instead the Great Seal was put into commission. He went into opposition and contributed to the downfall of the coalition in December 1783. William Pitt the Younger became Prime Minister and reinstated Thurlow as Lord Chancellor. The relationship between Pitt and Thurlow was always fragile, and Thurlow often relied on his friendship with King George III to be able to remain in office. He opposed a bill for the restoration to the heirs of estates forfeited in the Jacobite rising of 1745. Partly to please the king, he consistently and strongly supported Warren Hastings, and negotiated with the Whigs to ensure his continued power in the event of a change of government. In 1792, when he attacked Pitt's bill to establish a fund to redeem the national debt, he was finally dismissed. Personal life Thurlow had a number of illegitimate children Two of his daughters, Maria and Catharine, had their portrait painted by George Romney in 1783. Maria, who died in 1816, married Colonel Sir David Cunynghame of Milncraig, 5th Baronet, in 1801, and had several children.Mosley, Charles, editor.

Wilmington, Delaware, U.S.A.: Burke's Peerage (Genealogical Books) Ltd, 2003. Volume 3, page 3512. Later life As a way of compensation, Thurlow was given a second peerage as Baron Thurlow, of Thurlow in the County of Suffolk, with remainder to his three nephews and their heirs male. He was never to hold office again and retired into private life. However, in 1797 he intrigued for the formation of a government from which Pitt and Fox should be excluded, and in which the Earl of Moira should be Prime Minister and himself Lord Chancellor. Despite the tacit support of the Prince of Wales the enterprise failed. His last recorded appearance in the House of Lords was in 1802. Maria and Catherine, daughters of Edward Thurlow, 1st Baron Thurlow (George Romney, 1783) Lord Thurlow never married, but left three natural daughters. He died at Brighton on 12 September 1806, aged 76, and was buried in the Temple Church. The barony of 1778 became extinct on his death, while he was succeeded in the barony of 1792 according to the special remainder by his nephew Edward, who was the eldest son of the first baron's brother, Right Reverend Thomas Thurlow, Bishop of Durham. In popular culture Thurlow appears as a character in Alan Bennett's play The Madness of George III and the subsequent film adaptation, in which he was played by John Wood. John Poynder's Literary Extracts (1844) attributes to Thurlow the following widely quoted saying: See also *Honora Jenkins' will References Bibliography Endnotes: ** Lord Campbell's Lives of the Chancellors, vii. 153‚Äì333 ** Foss's Judges of England, viii. 374‚Äì385 ** Public Characters (1798) ** Notes and Queries, 2nd series, vol. iii. p. 283; 3rd series, vol. iii. p. 122 ** Reports of his decisions by Brown, Dickens and Vesey (jun.) ** Brougham's Statesmen of the Time of George III. * External links - Category:1731 births Category:1806 deaths Category:People educated at The King's School, Canterbury Category:Alumni of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge Category:English lawyers Category:Solicitors General for England and Wales Category:Attorneys General for England and Wales Category:Lord Chancellors of Great Britain Category:Lord High Stewards Category:Members of the Privy Council of Great Britain Category:English Queen's Counsel Category:Queen's Counsel 1597‚Äì1800 Category:Peers of Great Britain created by George III Category:Members of the Parliament of Great Britain for English constituencies Category:British MPs 1761‚Äì1768 Category:British MPs 1768‚Äì1774 Category:British MPs 1774‚Äì1780 Edward 1 ","title":"Edward Thurlow, 1st Baron Thurlow"},{"id":"406108","text":"Mother of the Plaza de Mayo The white scarf of the Mothers, painted on the ground in Plaza de Mayo, Buenos Aires Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo () is a movement of Argentine mothers who campaigned for their children who had been \\"disappeared\\" during the military dictatorship, pursuing the government for answers between 1977 and 2006.  Purpose  Women had organized to gather, holding a vigil, while also trying to learn what had happened to their adult children during 1970s and 1980s. They began to gather for this every Thursday, from 1977 at the Plaza de Mayo in Buenos Aires, in front of the Casa Rosada presidential palace, in public defiance of the government's law against mass assemblies. Wearing white headscarves to symbolize the diapers (nappies) of their lost children, embroidered with the names and dates of birth of their offspring, now young adults, the mothers marched in twos in solidarity to protest the denials of their children's existence or their mistreatment by the military regime. Despite personal risks, they wanted to hold the government accountable for the human rights violations which were committed in the Dirty War.  Activism and reaction  The Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo were the first major group to organize against the Argentina regime's human rights violations. Together, the women created a dynamic and unexpected force, which existed in opposition to traditional constraints on women in Latin America. These mothers came together to push for information on their own children and this highlighted the human rights violations and the scale of the protest drew press attention, raising awareness on a local and global scale. Their persistence to publicly remember and try to find their children, the sustained group organisation, the use of symbols and slogans, and the silent weekly protests attracted reactive measures from those in power. The military government considered these women to be politically subversive; the founder of the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo, Azucena Villaflor De Vincenti, who placed the names of 'the missing' in a newspaper in December 1977 (on International Human Rights Day) was kidnapped, tortured and murdered (later found to have been killed on a 'death flight' and her body disposed of in the sea), along with French nuns Alice Domon and L√©onie Duquet who also supported the movement. This was done at the command of Alfredo Astiz and Jorge Rafael Videla (who was a senior commander in the Argentine Army and dictator of Argentina from 1976 to 1981), both of whom were later sentenced to life in prison for their roles in the repression of dissidents during the Dirty War..

In 1983, former military officers began to reveal information about some of the regime's human rights violations. Eventually, the military has admitted that over 9,000 of those abducted are still unaccounted for, but the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo say that the number of missing is closer to 30,000. Most are presumed dead. Many of these prisoners were high school students, young professionals, and union workers who were suspected of having opposed the government. Those 'taken' were generally below the age of 35, as were the members of the regime who tortured and murdered them. There were a disproportionate number of Jewish \\"disappeared\\" as the military was anti-Semitic, as documented in Prisoner Without a Name, Cell Without a Number. This documented the testimony of Jacobo Timerman and his experience being arrested and tortured during this time. . It took until 2005 and DNA identification for many of the mass graves and human remains to be exhumed and cremated or buried, Azecuna's ashes were interred in the Plaza de Mayo itself.

The text reads \\"30 MIL POCHOS VIVEN\\" = \\"30,000 Pochos live\\", a reference to the estimate of 30,000 \\"disappeared\\" victims of the military junta.  Origins of the movement  On April 30, 1977, Azucena Villaflor de De Vincenti and a dozen other mothers walked to the Plaza de Mayo in Argentina's capital city. The original founders of the group were Azucena Villaflor de De Vincenti, Berta Braverman, Hayd√©e Garc√≠a Buelas; Mar√≠a Adela Gard de Antokoletz, Julia, Mar√≠a Mercedes and C√°ndida Gard (four sisters); Delicia Gonz√°lez, Pepa Noia, Mirta Acu√±a de Baravalle, Kety Neuhaus, Raquel Arcushin, and Senora De Caimi. These women shared the experience of each having had at least one child who had been 'taken' by the military government. The mothers declared that between 1970 and 1980, more than 30,000 individuals became \\"Desaparecidos\\" or \\"the disappeared.\\" These people were erased from public records with no government traces of arrests or evidence of charges against them. The women decided to risk a public protest, although gatherings of more than three people were banned, by linking arms in pairs, as if on a stroll just across the street from the presidential office building, the Casa Rosada (the Pink House). The mothers chose this site for its high visibility, and they were hoping for information on their whereabouts to recover imprisoned or to properly bury their children. The \\"disappeared\\" were believed to have been abducted by agents of the Argentine government during the years known as the Dirty War (1976‚Äì1983). Those whose locations were found, often had been tortured and killed and bodies disposed of in rural areas or unmarked graves.  Becoming a movement  As growing numbers joined weekly marches on Thursdays, the day they first few met, the Mothers also began an international campaign to defy the propaganda distributed by the military regime. This campaign brought the attention of the world to Argentina.. \\"Purdue University Press\\", article, \\"Textual Strategies to Resist Disappearance and the Mothers of Plaza de Mayo\\", 2007.

One year after the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo was founded, hundreds of women were participating, gathering in the Plaza for weekly demonstrations. They found strength in each other by marching in public, and attracted some press. They made signs with photos of their children and publicized their children's names. They wore white headscarves embroidered with the names and dates of births of their lost children. The government tried to trivialize their action calling them \\"las locas\\" (the madwomen).Lester Kurtz. \\"Movements and Campaigns\\", Nonviolent Conflict website, N.p., n.d. Web. 16 December 2012 As the number of disappeared grew, the movement grew, and the Mothers were getting international attention. They began to try and build pressure from outside governments against the Argentine dictatorship, by sharing the many stories of the \\"disappeared\\". On 10 December 1977, International Human Rights Day, the Mothers published a newspaper advertisement with the names of their missing children. That same night, Azucena Villaflor (one of the original founders) was kidnapped from her home in Avellaneda by a group of armed men. She is reported to have been taken to the infamous ESMA torture centre, and from there on a \\"death flights\\" over the ocean. In-flight, the abducted were drugged, stripped, and flung into the sea or killed and thrown overboard.. \\"Gariwo\\", article, \\"Azucena Villaflor: A Mother of the Plaza de Mayo\\". Accessed: May 4, 2015. Also an estimated 500 of the missing are the children who were born in concentration camps or prison to pregnant 'disappeared' women; many of these babies were given in illegal adoptions to military families and others associated with the regime. Their birth mothers were generally believed to have been killed. The numbers are hard to determine due to the secrecy surrounding the abductions.  Global impact  In 1978, when Argentina hosted the World Cup, the Mothers' demonstrations at the Plaza were covered by the international press in town for the sporting event. Later when Adolfo Scilingo spoke at the National Commission on Disappeared People, he described how many prisoners were drugged and thrown out of planes to their deaths in the Atlantic Ocean. For years following the regime, from early 1978 onwards, residents who lived along the R√≠o de la Plata have found human remains of those abducted, murdered and dumped at sea. Some of the movement's most prominent supporters bodies were never found, such as French national L√©onie Duquet. Duquet and her sister Alice Domon, both French nuns, were taken during the Dirty War. Their disappearance attracted international attention and outrage, with demands for a United Nations investigation of human rights abuses in the country. France demanded information on the sisters, but the Argentine government denied all responsibility for them. In 2005, forensic anthropologists dug up some remains of bodies that had been buried in an unmarked grave after washing ashore (in late December 1977) near the beach resort of Santa Teresita, south of Buenos Aires. DNA testing identified among them Azucena Villaflor, Esther Careaga and Mar√≠a Eugenia Bianco, three pioneer Mothers of the Plaza who had \\"disappeared\\".

The government then conducted a national commission to collect testimony about the \\"disappeared\\", hearing from hundreds of witnesses. In 1985, it began prosecution of men indicted for crimes, beginning with the Trial of the Juntas, in which several high-ranking military officers were convicted and sentenced. The military threatened a coup to prevent a widening of prosecutions. In 1986, Congress passed Ley de Punto Final, which stopped the prosecutions for some years. But in 2003, Congress repealed the Pardon Laws, and in 2005 the Argentine Supreme Court ruled them unconstitutional. During the Kirchner's administration, prosecution of war crimes were re-opened. Former high-ranking military and security officers have been convicted and sentenced in new cases. Among the charges is the stealing of babies of the disappeared. The first major figure, Miguel Etchecolatz, was convicted and sentenced in 2006.

One group, called the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo-Founding Line, focused on legislation, the recovery of the remains of their children, and bringing ex-officials to justice. Hebe de Bonafini continued to lead a more radical faction under the name Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo Association. These mothers felt responsible for carrying on their children's political work and assumed the agenda that originally led to the disappearance of the dissidents. Unlike the Founding Line, the association refused government help or compensation. They pledged not to recognize the deaths of their children until the government would admit its fault.. \\"The Oxford International Encyclopedia of Peace\\", Volume 2, \\"Early Christianity and Antimilitarism - Mass Violence and Trends\\", 2010. Accessed: May 4, 2015. A scholar of the movement, Marguerite Guzman Bouvard, wrote that the association faction wanted \\"a complete transformation of Argentine political culture\\" and \\"envisions a socialist system free of the domination of special interests\\". The Mothers Association is now backed by younger militants who support socialism. In the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States, Bonafini said \\"I was happy when I first heard the news, that for once they were the ones attacked, I'm not going to lie.\\" and \\"being the U.S.A the most terrorist of all countries, throwing bombs everywhere around the world\\" but \\"felt bad for the innocent workers dead (because of the terrorist attack)\\" Her remarks led to some understandable criticisms in mainstream media. Speaking for the Mothers, she rejected the investigations of alleged Iranian involvement in the 1994 AMIA Bombing (the terrorist attack on the AMIA Jewish community center), saying the CIA and Mossad were misleading the investigation; making a statement that they repudiate \\"the tragic attack, but respect for the victims and their families requires to investigate and do justice,\\" without being \\"politically manipulated in the service of US interests.\\" 'Final' March of Resistance The Madres de la Plaza de Mayo march in October 2006 On 26 January 2006, members of the Madres de la Plaza de Mayo Association faction announced what they said was their final annual March of Resistance at the Plaza de Mayo, saying \\"the enemy isn't in the Government House anymore.\\" They acknowledged the significance of President N√©stor Kirchner's success in having the Full Stop Law (Ley de Punto Final) and the Law of Due Obedience repealed and declared unconstitutional. They said they would continue weekly Thursday marches in pursuit of action on other social causes. The Founding Line faction announced that it would continue both the Thursday marches and the annual marches to commemorate the long struggle of resistance to the dictatorship. Social involvement and political controversies The association faction remained close to Kirchnerism. They established a newspaper (La Voz de las Madres), a radio station, and a university (Popular University of the Mothers of Plaza de Mayo). The association at one time managed a federally funded housing program, Sue√±os Compartidos (\\"Shared Dreams\\"), which it founded in 2008. By 2011, Sue√±os Compartidos had completed 5,600 housing units earmarked for slum residents, and numerous other facilities in six provinces and the city of Buenos Aires. Its growing budgets, which totaled around US$300 million allocated between 2008 and 2011 (of which $190 million had been spent), came under scrutiny. There was controversy when the chief financial officer of Sue√±os Compartidos, Sergio Schoklender, and his brother Pablo (the firm's attorney) were alleged to have embezzled funds. The Schoklender brothers had been convicted in 1981 for the murder of their parents and served 15 years in prison. After gaining Bonafini's confidence, they were managing the project's finances with little oversight from the Mothers of Plaza de Mayo or the program's licensor, the Secretary of Public Works. Their friendship with the association ended in June 2011 after Bonafini learned of irregularities in their handling of the group's finances. Following an investigation ordered by Federal Judge Norberto Oyarbide, the Secretary of Public Works canceled the Sue√±os Compartidos contract in August 2011. The outstanding projects were transferred to the Undersecretary of Housing and Urban Development. Gender and motherhood Issues of gender and motherhood were embedded in this movement. From its inception, the Mothers have been a strictly women-only organization, as the mothers who lost their children were asserting their existence in the embroidery scarves, posters and demands for restoration. In the later political movement, the women felt it had to be women-only partly to ensure their voices and actions would not be lost in a male-dominated movement, and partly out of a belief that men would insist on a lengthy bureaucratic process rather than immediate action. They also believed that women were more tireless and had more emotional strength than men. The gender separatism reaffirmed its status as a women's movement, although it also raised the question among some scholars of whether the movement truly challenged the notion of female passivity, and whether or not it would have sent a more powerful message to have had male family members involved as well. The Mothers movement also raised questions of women in political space and the boundaries surrounding that space. The socially constructed gender roles prevalent in Argentine society restricted the arena of politics, political mobilisation, and confrontation to men. When the Mothers entered the Plaza de Mayo, a public space with historical significance, they politicised their role as mothers in society and redefined the values associated with both politics and motherhood itself. Although they did not challenge the patriarchal structure of Argentine society, by crossing boundaries into the masculinised political sphere, they expanded spaces of representation for Argentine women and opened the way for new forms of civic participation. The Mothers were committed to child-centred politics, symbolised by the white scarves they wore on their heads.Krause, Wanda C. \\"The Role and Example of Chilean and Argentinian Mothers in Democratisation.\\" Development in Practice, vol. 14, no. 3, 2004, pp. 366‚Äì380. JSTOR. The scarves were originally nappies, or to represent diapers, and were embroidered with the names of their disappeared children or relatives. These headscarves identified the Mothers and symbolised children, and thus life, as well as hope and maternal care. The colour white also symbolised their refusal to wear a black mantilla and go into mourning. Children were at the heart of the movement, as the Mothers fought for a system that would respect human life and honour its preservation. Santa Fe commemoration of 2000 rounds of the Madres de Plaza de Mayo, 2016 The Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo politicised and gave new value to the traditional role of mothers. They used motherhood to frame their protest, demanding the rights inherent to their role: to conserve life. They protested not only what had been done to their children, but also to themselves as mothers by taking them away. The heart of the movement was always \\"women's feelings, mother's feelings\\", according to Hebe de Bonafini. She further stated that \\"it was the strength of women, of mothers, that kept us going.\\" The women's identity as mothers did not restrict them from participating or making an impact in a masculinised political space. Their public protests contradicted the traditional, private domain of motherhood, and by mobilising themselves, they politicised their consciousness as women. They restricted themselves to a conservative representation of motherhood, which avoided controversy and attracted the support of international media. They refuted the concept that to be taken seriously or to be successful, a movement either has to be gender- neutral, or masculine: femininity and motherhood was integral to the Mothers' protest.

It was characterized by swelling and the presence of albumin in the urine, and was frequently accompanied by high blood pressure and heart disease. Signs and symptoms The symptoms and signs of Bright's disease were first described in 1827 by the English physician Richard Bright, after whom the disease was named. In his Reports of Medical Cases, he described 25 cases of dropsy (edema) which he attributed to kidney disease. Symptoms and signs included: inflammation of serous membranes, hemorrhages, apoplexy, convulsions, blindness and coma. Many of these cases were found to have albumin in their urine (detected by the spoon and candle-heat coagulation), and showed striking morbid changes of the kidneys at autopsy. The triad of dropsy, albumin in the urine and kidney disease came to be regarded as characteristic of Bright's disease. Subsequent work by Bright and others indicated an association with cardiac hypertrophy, which was attributed by Bright to stimulation of the heart. Subsequent work by Frederick Akbar Mahomed showed that a rise in blood pressure could precede the appearance of albumin in the urine, and the rise in blood pressure and increased resistance to flow was believed to explain the cardiac hypertrophy. It is now known that Bright's disease is caused by a wide and diverse range of kidney diseases; thus, the term Bright's disease is retained strictly for historical application. The disease was diagnosed frequently in patients with diabetes; at least some of these cases would probably correspond to a modern diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy. Treatment Bright's disease was historically treated with warm baths, blood-letting, squill, digitalis, mercuric compounds, opium, diuretics, laxatives, and dietary therapy, including abstinence from alcoholic drinks, cheese and red meat. Arnold Ehret was diagnosed with Bright's disease and pronounced incurable by 24 of Europe's most respected doctors; he designed The Mucusless Diet Healing System, which apparently cured his illness. William Howard Hay, MD had the illness and, it is claimed, cured himself using the Hay diet.

He pioneered the genre of street photography, and viewed photography as capturing a decisive moment. Cartier-Bresson was one of the founding members of Magnum Photos in 1947. In the 1970s he took up drawing‚Äîhe had studied painting in the 1920s. Early life Henri Cartier-Bresson was born in Chanteloup-en-Brie, Seine-et-Marne, France, the oldest of five children. His father was a wealthy textile manufacturer, whose Cartier-Bresson thread was a staple of French sewing kits. His mother's family were cotton merchants and landowners from Normandy, where Henri spent part of his childhood. His mother was descended from Charlotte Corday.\\"American Photo - ND\\", Sep-Oct 1997. Retrieved 29 March 2019 The Cartier-Bresson family lived in a bourgeois neighborhood in Paris, Rue de Lisbonne, near Place de l'Europe and Parc Monceau. His parents supported him financially so Henri could pursue photography more freely than his contemporaries. Henri also sketched. Young Henri took holiday snapshots with a Box Brownie; he later experimented with a 3√ó4 inch view camera. He was raised in traditional French bourgeois fashion, and was required to address his parents with formal vous rather than tu. His father assumed that his son would take up the family business, but Henri was strong-willed and also feared this prospect. Cartier-Bresson attended √âcole F√©nelon, a Catholic school that prepared students for the Lyc√©e Condorcet. A governess called \\"Miss Kitty\\" who came from across the Channel, instilled in him the love of - and competence in - the English language. The proctor caught him reading a book by Rimbaud or Mallarm√©, and reprimanded him, \\"Let's have no disorder in your studies!\\". Cartier-Bresson said, \\"He used the informal 'tu', which usually meant you were about to get a good thrashing. But he went on, 'You're going to read in my office.' Well, that wasn't an offer he had to repeat.\\" =Painting= After trying to learn music, Cartier-Bresson was introduced to oil painting by his uncle Louis, a gifted painter. But the painting lessons were cut short when uncle Louis was killed in World War I. In 1927 Cartier-Bresson entered a private art school and the Lhote Academy, the Parisian studio of the Cubist painter and sculptor Andr√© Lhote. Lhote's ambition was to integrate the Cubists' approach to reality with classical artistic forms; he wanted to link the French classical tradition of Nicolas Poussin and Jacques-Louis David to Modernism. Cartier-Bresson also studied painting with society portraitist Jacques √âmile Blanche. During this period, he read Dostoevsky, Schopenhauer, Rimbaud, Nietzsche, Mallarm√©, Freud, Proust, Joyce, Hegel, Engels and Marx. Lhote took his pupils to the Louvre to study classical artists and to Paris galleries to study contemporary art. Cartier- Bresson's interest in modern art was combined with an admiration for the works of the Renaissance masters: Jan van Eyck, Paolo Uccello, Masaccio, Piero della Francesca. Cartier-Bresson regarded Lhote as his teacher of \\"photography without a camera.\\" =Surrealists photography influence= Although Cartier- Bresson became frustrated with Lhote's \\"rule-laden\\" approach to art, the rigorous theoretical training later helped him identify and resolve problems of artistic form and composition in photography. In the 1920s, schools of photographic realism were popping up throughout Europe but each had a different view on the direction photography should take. The Surrealist movement, founded in 1924, was a catalyst for this paradigm shift. Cartier- Bresson began socializing with the Surrealists at the Caf√© Cyrano, in the Place Blanche. He met a number of the movement's leading protagonists, and was drawn to the Surrealist movement's technique of using the subconscious and the immediate to influence their work. The historian Peter Galassi explains: Cartier-Bresson matured artistically in this stormy cultural and political atmosphere. But, although he knew the concepts, he couldn't express them; dissatisfied with his experiments, he destroyed most of his early paintings. =Cambridge and army= From 1928 to 1929, Cartier-Bresson studied art, literature, and English at the University of Cambridge, where he became bilingual. In 1930 he was conscripted into the French Army and stationed at Le Bourget near Paris, a time about which he later remarked: \\"And I had quite a hard time of it, too, because I was toting Joyce under my arm and a Lebel rifle on my shoulder.\\" = Receives first camera = In 1929, Cartier- Bresson's air squadron commandant placed him under house arrest for hunting without a licence. Cartier-Bresson met American expatriate Harry Crosby at Le Bourget, who persuaded the commandant to release Cartier-Bresson into his custody for a few days. The two men both had an interest in photography, and Harry presented Henri with his first camera. They spent their time together taking and printing pictures at Crosby's home, Le Moulin du Soleil (The Sun Mill), near Paris in Ermenonville, France. Crosby later said Cartier-Bresson \\"looked like a fledgling, shy and frail, and mild as whey.\\" Embracing the open sexuality offered by Crosby and his wife Caresse, Cartier-Bresson fell into an intense sexual relationship with her that lasted until 1931. =Escape to Africa= Two years after Harry Crosby died by suicide, Cartier-Bresson's affair with Caresse Crosby ended in 1931, leaving him broken-hearted. During conscription he read Conrad's Heart of Darkness. This gave him the idea of escaping and finding adventure on the C√¥te d'Ivoire in French colonial Africa. He survived by shooting game and selling it to local villagers. From hunting, he learned methods which he later used in photography. On the C√¥te d'Ivoire, he contracted blackwater fever, which nearly killed him. While still feverish, he sent instructions to his grandfather for his own funeral, asking to be buried in Normandy, at the edge of the Eawy Forest while Debussy's String Quartet was played. Although Cartier-Bresson took a portable camera (smaller than a Brownie Box) to C√¥te d'Ivoire, only seven photographs survived the tropics.Montier, 1996, p. 12 =Photography= Cartier-Bresson's first Leica Returning to France, Cartier-Bresson recuperated in Marseille in late 1931 and deepened his relationship with the Surrealists. He became inspired by a 1930 photograph by Hungarian photojournalist Martin Munkacsi showing three naked young African boys, caught in near-silhouette, running into the surf of Lake Tanganyika. Titled Three Boys at Lake Tanganyika, this captured the freedom, grace and spontaneity of their movement and their joy at being alive. That photograph inspired him to stop painting and to take up photography seriously. He explained, \\"I suddenly understood that a photograph could fix eternity in an instant.\\" He acquired the Leica camera with 50 mm lens in Marseilles that would accompany him for many years. The anonymity that the small camera gave him in a crowd or during an intimate moment was essential in overcoming the formal and unnatural behavior of those who were aware of being photographed. He enhanced his anonymity by painting all shiny parts of the Leica with black paint. The Leica opened up new possibilities in photography‚Äîthe ability to capture the world in its actual state of movement and transformation. Restless, he photographed in Berlin, Brussels, Warsaw, Prague, Budapest and Madrid. His photographs were first exhibited at the Julien Levy Gallery in New York in 1933, and subsequently at the Ateneo Club in Madrid. In 1934 in Mexico, he shared an exhibition with Manuel √Ålvarez Bravo. In the beginning, he did not photograph much in his native France. It would be years before he photographed there extensively. In 1934, Cartier-Bresson met a young Polish intellectual, a photographer named David Szymin who was called \\"Chim\\" because his name was difficult to pronounce. Szymin later changed his name to David Seymour. The two had much in common culturally. Through Chim, Cartier-Bresson met a Hungarian photographer named Endr√© Friedmann, who later changed his name to Robert Capa. United States exhibits Cartier-Bresson traveled to the United States in 1935 with an invitation to exhibit his work at New York's Julien Levy Gallery. He shared display space with fellow photographers Walker Evans and Manuel √Ålvarez Bravo. Carmel Snow of Harper's Bazaar gave him a fashion assignment, but he fared poorly since he had no idea how to direct or interact with the models. Nevertheless, Snow was the first American editor to publish Cartier-Bresson's photographs in a magazine. While in New York, he met photographer Paul Strand, who did camerawork for the Depression-era documentary The Plow That Broke the Plains. =Filmmaking= When he returned to France, Cartier-Bresson applied for a job with renowned French film director Jean Renoir. He acted in Renoir's 1936 film Partie de campagne and in the 1939 La R√®gle du jeu, for which he played a butler and served as second assistant. Renoir made Cartier-Bresson act so he could understand how it felt to be on the other side of the camera. Cartier-Bresson also helped Renoir make a film for the Communist party on the 200 families, including his own, who ran France. During the Spanish civil war, Cartier-Bresson co-directed an anti- fascist film with Herbert Kline, to promote the Republican medical services. =Photojournalism start= Cartier-Bresson's first photojournalist photos to be published came in 1937 when he covered the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, for the French weekly Regards. He focused on the new monarch's adoring subjects lining the London streets, and took no pictures of the king. His photo credit read \\"Cartier\\", as he was hesitant to use his full family name. Marriage In 1937, Cartier-Bresson married a Javanese dancer, Ratna Mohini. They lived in a fourth-floor servants' flat in Paris at 19, rue Neuve-des-Petits-Champs (now rue Danielle Casanova), a large studio with a small bedroom, kitchen, and bathroom where Cartier-Bresson developed film. Between 1937 and 1939, Cartier-Bresson worked as a photographer for the French Communists' evening paper, Ce Soir. With Chim and Capa, Cartier-Bresson was a leftist, but he did not join the French Communist party. =World War II service= When World War II broke out in September 1939, Cartier-Bresson joined the French Army as a Corporal in the Film and Photo unit. During the Battle of France, in June 1940 at St. Di√© in the Vosges Mountains, he was captured by German soldiers and spent 35 months in prisoner-of-war camps doing forced labor under the Nazis. He twice tried and failed to escape from the prison camp, and was punished by solitary confinement. His third escape was successful and he hid on a farm in Touraine before getting false papers that allowed him to travel in France. In France, he worked for the underground, aiding other escapees and working secretly with other photographers to cover the Occupation and then the Liberation of France. In 1943, he dug up his beloved Leica camera, which he had buried in farmland near Vosges. At the end of the war he was asked by the American Office of War Information to make a documentary, Le Retour (The Return) about returning French prisoners and displaced persons. Toward the end of the War, rumors had reached America that Cartier-Bresson had been killed. His film on returning war refugees (released in the United States in 1947) spurred a retrospective of his work at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) instead of the posthumous show that MoMA had been preparing. The show debuted in 1947 together with the publication of his first book, The Photographs of Henri Cartier-Bresson. Lincoln Kirstein and Beaumont Newhall wrote the book's text. Magnum Photos In early 1947, Cartier- Bresson, with Robert Capa, David Seymour, William Vandivert and George Rodger founded Magnum Photos. Capa's brainchild, Magnum was a cooperative picture agency owned by its members. The team split photo assignments among the members. Rodger, who had quit Life in London after covering World War II, would cover Africa and the Middle East. Chim, who spoke a variety of European languages, would work in Europe. Cartier-Bresson would be assigned to India and China. Vandivert, who had also left Life, would work in America, and Capa would work anywhere that had an assignment. Maria Eisner managed the Paris office and Rita Vandivert, Vandivert's wife, managed the New York office and became Magnum's first president. Cartier-Bresson achieved international recognition for his coverage of Gandhi's funeral in India in 1948 and the last stage of the Chinese Civil War in 1949. He covered the last six months of the Kuomintang administration and the first six months of the Maoist People's Republic. He also photographed the last surviving Imperial eunuchs in Beijing, as the city was falling to the communists. In Shanghai, he often worked in the company of photojournalist Sam Tata, whom Cartier-Bresson had previously befriended in Bombay.Dessureault, Pierre. The Tata Era / L'Epoque Tata. Canadian Museum of Contemporary Photography. Ottawa, 1988. From China, he went on to Dutch East Indies (Indonesia), where he documented the gaining of independence from the Dutch. In 1950, Cartier-Bresson had traveled to the South India. He had visited Tiruvannamalai, a town in the Indian State of Tamil Nadu and photographed the last moments of Ramana Maharishi, Sri Ramana Ashram and its surroundings. A few days later he also visited and photographed Sri Aurobindo, Mother and Sri Aurobindo Ashram, Pondicherry. Magnum's mission was to \\"feel the pulse\\" of the times and some of its first projects were People Live Everywhere, Youth of the World, Women of the World and The Child Generation. Magnum aimed to use photography in the service of humanity, and provided arresting, widely viewed images. =The Decisive Moment= 1952 US edition of Cartier-Bresson's 1952 book The Decisive Moment (Images √† la sauvette). Photograph of Alberto Giacometti by Cartier-BressonIn 1952, Cartier-Bresson published his book Images √† la sauvette, whose English- language edition was titled The Decisive Moment, although the French language title actually translates as \\"images on the sly\\" or \\"hastily taken images\\",Robert Duggan - A Warm Kiss: Cartier-Bresson Speaks in ‚ÄúThe Decisive Moment‚Äù The Big Think Accessed February 2, 2018 (and using Google translation & Cambridge Dictionaries (via Wiktionary) for the word sauvette)Simon Garfield (2016) Timekeepers: How the World Became Obsessed With Time - (a page within Chapter 9) Canongate Books, 29 September 2016 Accessed February 2, 2018Sean O'Hagan (2014) - Cartier-Bresson's classic is back ‚Äì but his Decisive Moment has passed The Guardian 23 December 2014, Accessed February 2, 2018 Images √† la sauvette included a portfolio of 126 of his photos from the East and the West. The book's cover was drawn by Henri Matisse. For his 4,500-word philosophical preface, Cartier-Bresson took his keynote text from the 17th century Cardinal de Retz, \\"Il n'y a rien dans ce monde qui n'ait un moment decisif\\" (\\"There is nothing in this world that does not have a decisive moment\\"). Cartier-Bresson applied this to his photographic style. He said: \\"Photographier: c'est dans un m√™me instant et en une fraction de seconde reconna√Ætre un fait et l'organisation rigoureuse de formes per√ßues visuellement qui expriment et signifient ce fait\\" (\\"To me, photography is the simultaneous recognition, in a fraction of a second, of the significance of an event as well as of a precise organization of forms which give that event its proper expression.\\"). Both titles came from T√©riade, the Greek-born French publisher whom Cartier-Bresson admired. He gave the book its French title, Images √† la Sauvette, loosely translated as \\"images on the run\\" or \\"stolen images.\\" Dick Simon of Simon & Schuster came up with the English title The Decisive Moment. Margot Shore, Magnum's Paris bureau chief, translated Cartier-Bresson's French preface into English. \\"Photography is not like painting,\\" Cartier-Bresson told the Washington Post in 1957. \\"There is a creative fraction of a second when you are taking a picture. Your eye must see a composition or an expression that life itself offers you, and you must know with intuition when to click the camera. That is the moment the photographer is creative,\\" he said. \\"Oop! The Moment! Once you miss it, it is gone forever.\\" The photo Rue Mouffetard, Paris, taken in 1954, has since become a classic example of Cartier-Bresson‚Äôs ability to capture a decisive moment. He held his first exhibition in France at the Pavillon de Marsan in the Louvre Museum in 1955. Later career Cartier-Bresson's photography took him to many places, including China, Mexico, Canada, the United States, India, Japan, Portugal and the Soviet Union. He became the first Western photographer to photograph \\"freely\\" in the post-war Soviet Union. In 1962, on behalf of Vogue, he went to Sardinia for about twenty days. There he visited Nuoro, Oliena, Orgosolo Mamoiada Desulo, Orosei, Cala Gonone, Orani (hosted by his friend Costantino Nivola), San Leonardo di Siete Fuentes, and Cagliari.La fotografia in Sardegna. Lo sguardo esterno 1960-1980, Fondazione Banco di Sardegna, Ilisso Edizioni, 2010. Cartier-Bresson withdrew as a principal of Magnum (which still distributes his photographs) in 1966 to concentrate on portraiture and landscapes. In 1967, he was divorced from his first wife of 30 years, Ratna \\"Elie\\". In 1968, he began to turn away from photography and return to his passion for drawing and painting. He admitted that perhaps he had said all he could through photography. He married Magnum photographer Martine Franck, thirty years younger than himself, in 1970. The couple had a daughter, M√©lanie, in May 1972. Cartier-Bresson retired from photography in the early 1970s, and by 1975 no longer took pictures other than an occasional private portrait; he said he kept his camera in a safe at his house and rarely took it out. He returned to drawing, mainly using pencil, pen and ink, and to painting. He held his first exhibition of drawings at the Carlton Gallery in New York in 1975.  Death and legacy  Cartier-Bresson died in C√©reste (Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, France) on August 3, 2004, aged 95. No cause of death was announced. He was buried in the local cemetery nearby in Montjustin\\"Legendary Photojournalist Cartier-Bresson Is Buried in South of France\\" Photo Central. Accessed 19 September 2016and was survived by his wife, Martine Franck, and daughter, M√©lanie. Cartier-Bresson spent more than three decades on assignment for Life and other journals. He traveled without bounds, documenting some of the great upheavals of the 20th century -- the Spanish Civil War, the liberation of Paris in 1944, the fall of the Kuomintang in China to the communists, the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi, the May 1968 events in Paris, the Berlin Wall. And along the way he paused to document portraits of Camus, Picasso, Colette, Matisse, Pound and Giacometti. But many of his most renowned photographs, such as Behind the Gare Saint-Lazare, are of seemingly unimportant moments of ordinary daily life. Cartier-Bresson did not like to be photographed and treasured his privacy. Photographs of Cartier- Bresson are scant. When he accepted an honorary degree from Oxford University in 1975, he held a paper in front of his face to avoid being photographed. In a Charlie Rose interview in 2000, Cartier-Bresson noted that it wasn't necessarily that he hated to be photographed, but it was that he was embarrassed by the notion of being photographed for being famous. Cartier- Bresson believed that what went on beneath the surface was nobody's business but his own. He did recall that he once confided his innermost secrets to a Paris taxi driver, certain that he would never meet the man again. In 2003, he created the Henri Cartier-Bresson Foundation in Paris with his wife, the Belgian photographer Martine Franck and his daughter to preserve and share his legacy. In 2018, the foundation relocated from the Montparnasse district to Le Marais. =Cin√©ma v√©rit√©= Cartier-Bresson's photographs were also influential in the development of cin√©ma v√©rit√© film. In particular, he is credited as the inspiration for the National Film Board of Canada's early work in this genre with its 1958 Candid Eye series. Technique Cartier-Bresson almost always used a Leica 35 mm rangefinder camera fitted with a normal 50 mm lens, or occasionally a wide-angle lens for landscapes. He often wrapped black tape around the camera's chrome body to make it less conspicuous. With fast black and white film and sharp lenses, he was able to photograph events unnoticed. No longer bound by a 4√ó5 press camera or a medium format twin-lens reflex camera, miniature-format cameras gave Cartier-Bresson what he called \\"the velvet hand...the hawk's eye.\\" He never photographed with flash, a practice he saw as \\"impolite...like coming to a concert with a pistol in your hand.\\" He believed in composing his photographs in the viewfinder, not in the darkroom. He showcased this belief by having nearly all his photographs printed only at full-frame and completely free of any cropping or other darkroom manipulation. He insisted that his prints be left uncropped so as to include a few millimeters of the unexposed negative around the image area, resulting in a black frame around the developed picture. Cartier-Bresson worked exclusively in black and white, other than a few unsuccessful attempts in color. He disliked developing or making his own prints and showed a considerable lack of interest in the process of photography in general, likening photography with the small camera to an \\"instant drawing\\". Technical aspects of photography were valid for him only where they allowed him to express what he saw: He started a tradition of testing new camera lenses by taking photographs of ducks in urban parks. He never published the images but referred to them as 'my only superstition' as he considered it a 'baptism' of the lens. Cartier-Bresson is regarded as one of the art world's most unassuming personalities. He disliked publicity and exhibited a ferocious shyness since his days of hiding from the Nazis during World War II. Although he took many famous portraits, his face was little known to the world at large. This, presumably, helped allow him to work on the street undisturbed. He denied that the term \\"art\\" applied to his photographs. Instead, he thought that they were merely his gut reactions to fleeting situations that he had happened upon.

He is best known for his work on the Dragonlance novels co-written with Margaret Weis. He is also known for authoring role playing games while working for TSR and has cowritten novels with his wife Laura Hickman. Early life Tracy Hickman was born and raised in Salt Lake City, Utah. He graduated from Provo High School in 1974. His major interests were drama, music and Air Force JROTC. In 1975, Hickman began two years of service as a missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He was posted to Hawaii for six months while awaiting visa approval, and then he went to Indonesia, where he served in Surabaya, Djakarta and the mountain city of Bandung until 1977. Within four months of his return to the United States he married his high school sweetheart, Laura Curtis. Laura was the inspiration for Lauralanthalasa (Laurana) Kanan. Hickman eventually attended Brigham Young University. Career Hickman had many jobs before joining TSR in 1982, including working as a supermarket stocker, a movie projectionist, a theater manager, a glass worker, a television assistant director and a drill press operator in a genealogy center. =TSR= Together, Tracy and Laura wrote the original versions of the modules Rahasia and Pharaoh, publishing them privately. Pharaoh was originally published by DayStar West Media in 1980. In 1981, Tracy entered into a business arrangement to produce an arcade immersion game, but his associate disappeared, leaving the Hickmans with $30,000 in debts. Destitute and desperate, Tracy approached TSR with the modules Rahasia and Pharaoh, \\"literally so that I could buy shoes for my children\\". TSR bought the modules, but wanted to hire Tracy as well. Tracy recalls, \\"They said it would be easier to publish my adventures if I was part of the company. So, we made the move from Utah to Wisconsin. It was a terrifying experience. We had no money. My parents begged us not to venture into such foreign territory to pursue such a bizarre career. My father wrote that there was a secure job as a fry cook in Flagstaff (where my parents were living), and he pleaded with me to come take it.\\" When Tracy and Laura Hickman came to TSR, they brought Pharaoh with them. It was published as the first part of TSR's Desert of Desolation series (1982-1983). I6 Ravenloft (1983) was also written by Tracy and Laura Hickman. Tracy Hickman also wrote two supplements for TSR's Gangbusters role-playing game. Tracy and Laura Hickman's contributions to the D&D; module portfolio are credited with initiating a fundamental shift in the RPG module design sensibilities, away from pure dungeon crawl and towards more \\"cerebral\\" adventures centered on intriguing plots. =Dragonlance= As he was traveling from Utah to Wisconsin to join TSR, Hickman conceived the idea for a setting to make dragons fearsome once more. At TSR he found other creators who were interested in his project which was called \\"Project Overlord\\". Harold Johnson became the project's biggest promoter to upper management and convinced Hickman to expand his initial idea of a three- adventure trilogy. Soon after, TSR management announced its intention to develop his series of dragon-based role-playing adventures. Hickman's proposal resulted in the Dragonlance Chronicles, which led to his association with Margaret Weis. Jean Black, the managing editor of TSR's book department, picked Hickman and Weis to write Dragons of Autumn Twilight and the rest of the Dragonlance Chronicles series. This was the first project TSR had undertaken that would include adult novels as well as games, calendars, and other spin-off products. The original Dragonlance team was formed under Hickman's leadership.Phillips, Casey (February 19, 2010). \\"QandA with Larry Elmore\\", Chattanooga Times Free Press. Distributed through McClatchy-Tribune News Service, February 19, 2010. \\"Project Overlord\\" began as a novel and three modules, and beginning in 1984 grew into the first Dragonlance trilogy (by Weis and Hickman) and 15 companion modules. After Dragonlance Chronicles, Hickman and Weis wrote the Dragonlance Legends trilogy, which was published in 1986. By 1987, the Dragonlance project had sold two million books and a half million adventure modules. =Novelist= Hickman left TSR in 1987, having collaborated on over 30 novels with Weis. Together they also wrote the Darksword trilogy and The Death Gate Cycle, and collaborated on the Rose of the Prophet series (1988-1989). Weis and Hickman returned to TSR to write new fiction, although TSR turned their intended trilogy into a single book, Dragons of Summer Flame published in 1995. In spring 1996, Hickman's first two solo novels, Requiem of Stars and The Immortals, were published. Of The Immortals, a near-future cautionary tale about AIDS concentration camps in Utah, Hickman said: \\"I was absolutely driven to write that book. I was able to say many things that I felt strongly about and still do. It is perhaps my finest work.\\" For the Starshield Project, Hickman and Weis produced the Del Rey Books-published novels Sentinels (later retitled Mantle of Kendis-Dai) and Nightsword, and Hickman wrote a story for Dragon #250 called \\"Dedrak's Quest\\". Of this setting he said, \\"Starshield is a universe where a society of dragons can confront blaster-armed spacemen or wizards wielding magic staves with computer targeting\\", and that the Starshield Project \\"grew out of my desire to share the creation process with all our fans. Many of the ideas, worlds, and creations submitted by our citizens find their way into our novels. Everyone whose material is used gets credit and a chance to participate in profits from online sales of their adventures.\\" According to Hickman, Starshield's ultimate purpose, and his biggest dream, was to finance a permanent colony on Mars by the year 2010: \\"Whether we make it to Mars may not be as important as that we honestly, courageously tried.\\" Readers were able to freely download both the first novel in the series, and the Starshield roleplaying game from Hickman's website. Tracy Hickman (left) and Margaret Weis at Gen Con Indy 2008. The Hickmans have been publishing game designs together for over twenty-five years including the popular and innovative Advanced Dungeons & Dragons Ravenloft module in 1983. Says Hickman of the original module, and its 1986 sequel Ravenloft II: The House on Gryphon Hill, \\"I still believe the original Ravenloft modules were perhaps the best that ever had my name on them.\\" They published their first joint novel, Mystic Warrior, in 2004. Tracy and Laura have been producing their DragonHearth podcast since December 2005. In the late 1990s, Larry Elmore approached Weis and Hickman to pitch his fantasy world of Loerem. They agreed and produced the Sovereign Stone trilogy of books. With encouragement from Peter Adkison, Wizards of the Coast published a new trilogy of Dragonlance novels by Weis and Hickman called War of Souls, beginning with Dragons of a Fallen Sun (2000). Hickman announced in 2008 he would be starting two new fantasy series: one being the six-book Dragonships of Vindras series, with his long-time writing partner Margaret Weis, and the other the three-book Drakis series with his wife, Laura. In 1999 Pyramid magazine named Tracy Hickman one of The Millennium's Most Influential Persons \\"at least in the realm of adventure gaming.\\" The magazine stated that Tracy Hickman and Margaret Weis are \\"basically responsible for the entire gaming fiction genre.\\" Hickman was inducted into the Origins Hall of Fame in 2002, recognized in part for \\"one game line turned literary sensation: Dragonlance.\\" Tracy and Laura Hickman wrote the adventure Out in the Black (2006) for the Serenity Role Playing Game for Margaret Weis Productions. Hickman wrote the screenplay for, produced, and edited the first science-fiction film shot completely in space, Apogee of Fear. In 2009, Hickman released XDM: X-Treme Dungeon Mastery, a guide for DMs based on his years of experience in the trade. Written with his son Curtis Hickman and illustrated by online comic artist Howard Tayler, the book calls itself the \\"cure for the common game.\\" In 2010, Tracy and Laura Hickman launched a direct-to-internet serialized fantasy series, \\"Dragon's Bard\\" which introduced the concept of \\"novel as souvenir\\" where subscribers could download periodical ebook chapters as the book was written and then receive a copy of the physical book upon the completion of the subscription. Hickman called the concept \\"web like the Dickens\\" after its merging of 19th century literature serial techniques with modern internet distribution. Eventide and the remaining two books of the series were subsequently contracted for general distribution by Shadow Mountain Publishing in 2012. While primarily known for his work in epic fantasy, Tracy once wrote a Batman novel for DC Comics titled Wayne of Gotham (June 2012). On March 15, 2013, Hickman joined Richard Garriott's team as lead story designer for Shroud of the Avatar: Forsaken Virtues. Shroud of the Avatar is the \\"spiritual successor\\" to Richard Garriott's previous work in the fantasy role-playing genre, the Ultima series of video games. On March 16, 2016, Hickman announced he had become the Director of Story Development at The Void, working with his son Curtis. Personal life Hickman married Laura Curtis in 1977, and together they have four children: Angel, Curtis, Tasha, and Jarod. On his website Hickman states that he is a devout Mormon. Since 1998, the family has resided in South Jordan, Utah.

Life The second son of Philip Yorke, 1st Earl of Hardwicke, he was born in London, and was educated at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. His literary abilities were shown at an early age by his collaboration with his brother Philip in the Athenian Letters. In 1745 he published an able treatise on the law of forfeiture for high treason, in defence of the severe sentences his father had given to the Scottish Jacobite peers following the Battle of Culloden. In the following year he was called to the bar. His father being at this time Lord Chancellor, Yorke obtained a sinecure appointment in the Court of Chancery in 1747, and entered Parliament as member for Reigate, a seat which he afterwards exchanged for that for the University of Cambridge. He quickly made his mark in the House of Commons, one of his earliest speeches being in favour of his father's reform of the marriage law that led to the Marriage Act 1753. In 1750 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1751 he became counsel to the East India Company, and in 1756 he was appointed Solicitor-General, a place which he retained in the administration of the elder Pitt, of whose foreign policy he was a powerful defender. He resigned with Pitt in 1761, but in 1762 became Attorney-General under Lord Bute. He continued to hold this office when George Grenville became Prime Minister (April 1763), and advised the government on the question raised by John Wilkes's The North Briton. Yorke refused to describe the libel as treasonable, while pronouncing it a high misdemeanour. In the following November he resigned office. Resisting Pitt's attempt to draw him into alliance against the ministry he had quit, Yorke maintained, in a speech that extorted the highest eulogy from Horace Walpole, that parliamentary privilege did not extend to cases of libel; though he agreed with Pitt in condemning the principle of general warrants. Yorke, henceforward a member of the Rockingham party, was elected recorder of Dover in 1764, and in 1765 he again became Attorney-General in the Rockingham administration, whose policy he did much to shape. He supported the repeal of the Stamp Act, while urging the simultaneous passing of the Declaratory Act. His most important measure was the constitution which he drew up for the province of Quebec, and which after his resignation of office became the Quebec Act of 1774. On the accession to power of Chatham and Grafton in 1766, Yorke resigned office, and took little part in the debates in parliament during the next four years. In 1770 he was invited by the Duke of Grafton, when Camden was dismissed from the Chancellorship, to take his seat on the woolsack. He had, however, explicitly pledged himself to Rockingham and his party not to take office with Grafton. The King exerted all his personal influence to overcome Yorke's scruples, warning him finally that the Great Seal if now refused would never again be within his grasp. Yorke yielded to the King's entreaty, and he was appointed Lord Chancellor and sworn of the Privy Council on 17 January 1770,. He went to his brother's house, where he met the leaders of the Opposition, and feeling at once overwhelmed with shame, fled to his own house, where three days later he committed suicide (20 January 1770). The patent raising him to the peerage as Baron Morden had been made out, but his last act was to refuse his sanction to the sealing of the document. Family Tyttenhanger House in 1840 Charles Yorke was twice married: Firstly, on 19 May 1755 to Katherine Blount Freeman, with one son: *Philip Yorke, (31 May 175718 Nov 1834) became 3rd Earl of Hardwicke; Secondly, on 30 December 1762 to Agneta Johnson, with children: *Charles Philip Yorke (12 Mar 176413 Mar 1834) was later to be prominent in government. *Caroline Yorke (29 Aug 176526 Jul 1818), who married John Eliot, 1st Earl of St Germans. *Joseph Sydney Yorke (6 Jun 17685 May 1831), who became an Admiral in the Royal Navy.

Controversy surrounds published accounts and Whitehead's own claims that he flew a powered machine successfully several times in 1901 and 1902, predating the first flights by the Wright Brothers in 1903. Much of Whitehead's reputation rests on a newspaper article which was written as an eyewitness report and describes his powered and sustained flight in Connecticut on 14 August 1901. The article also includes a drawing of the aircraft in flight. Over a hundred newspapers in the U.S. and around the world soon repeated information from the article. Several local newspapers also reported on other flight experiments that Whitehead made in 1901 and subsequent years.Gustave Whitehead Book FAQ Gustave Whitehead: \\"First in Flight\\". Retrieved 15 February 2016 Whitehead's aircraft designs and experiments were described or mentioned in Scientific American articles and a 1904 book about industrial progress. His public profile faded after about 1915, however, and he died in relative obscurity in 1927. In the 1930s, a magazine article and book asserted that Whitehead had made powered flights in 1901‚Äì02,Randolph, Stella (1937). Lost Flights of Gustave Whitehead. Washington, DC: Places, Inc. and the book includes statements from people who said that they had seen various Whitehead flights decades earlier. These published accounts triggered debate among scholars, researchers, and aviation enthusiasts, and even Orville Wright questioned whether Whitehead was first in powered flight. Mainstream historians dismissed the Whitehead flight claims, but some later research supported them, including books printed in 1966, 1978, and 2015. Researchers have studied and attempted to copy Whitehead aircraft. Since the 1980s, enthusiasts in the U.S. and Germany have built and flown versions of Whitehead's \\"Number 21\\" machine using modern engines and propellers.  Early life and career  Gustave Whitehead with an early engine Whitehead was born in Leutershausen, Bavaria, the second child of Karl Weisskopf and his wife Babetta. As a boy he showed an interest in flight, experimenting with kites and earning the nickname \\"the flyer\\". He and a friend caught and tethered birds in an attempt to learn how they flew, an activity which the police soon stopped. His parents died in 1886 and 1887, when he was a boy. He then trained as a mechanic and traveled to Hamburg, where in 1888 he was forced to join the crew of a sailing ship. A year later he returned to Germany, then journeyed with a family to Brazil. He went to sea again for several years, learning more about wind, weather and bird flight. Weisskopf arrived in the U.S. in 1893.1900 U.S. Census, Pennsylvania, Allegheny, Pittsburgh, S.D. 18, E.D. 179, Sheet 16 He soon anglicized his name to Gustave Whitehead. The New York toy manufacturer E. J. Horsman hired Whitehead to build and operate advertising kites and model gliders. Whitehead also made plans to add a motor to propel one of his gliders. In 1893, Whitehead was in Boston where he experimented with gliders, kites, and models, and where he worked at Harvard's kite-flying meteorological station. In 1896, Whitehead was hired as a mechanic for the Boston Aeronautical Society. He and mechanic Albert B. C. Horn built a Lilienthal-type glider and an ornithopter. Whitehead made a few short and low flights in the glider, but did not succeed in flying the ornithopter. Also in 1896, founding Society member Samuel Cabot employed Whitehead and carpenter James Crowell to build a Lilienthal glider. Cabot reported to the Society that tests with this glider were unsuccessful.  Claims of powered flight  = 1899 = According to an affidavit given in 1934 by Louis Darvarich, a friend of Whitehead, the two men made a motorized flight of about half a mile in Pittsburgh's Schenley Park in April or May 1899. Darvarich said they flew at a height of in a steam-powered monoplane aircraft and crashed into a brick building. Darvarich said he was stoking the aircraft's boiler aboard the craft and was badly scalded in the accident, requiring several weeks in a hospital.Randolph, 1937, p. 27 Because of this incident, Whitehead was forbidden by the police to perform any more experiments in Pittsburgh. Aviation historian William F. Trimble, pointing to a lack of contemporary proof, dismissed this story in 1982 as a case of \\"overactive imaginations.\\" Whitehead's stated control method ‚Äì a shifting of body weight ‚Äì was said by Trimble to be insufficient to control a powered aircraft, and the supposed charcoal-fired steam powerplant could not have been powerful enough to lift itself off the ground. Whitehead was quoted in Pittsburgh newspapers in December 1899 as still constructing an aircraft, although he did say that he had flown it in Boston. A local historian claimed in 2015 that his research has uncovered evidence of the purported 1899 flight. Whitehead and Darvarich traveled to Bridgeport, Connecticut to find factory jobs. = 1901 = A description and photographs of Whitehead's aircraft appeared in Scientific American in June 1901, stating that the \\"novel flying machine\\" had just been completed, and was \\"now ready for preliminary trials.\\" Whitehead said he tested his unmanned machine on 3 May, according to a newspaper report.Minneapolis Journal, 26 July 1901, credited to the New York Sun. He said in the first test the machine carried 220 pounds of sand ballast and flew to an altitude of 40 to 50 feet for 1/8 of a mile (). On the second test Whitehead said the machine flew a distance of 1/2 mile () for one and a half minutes before crashing into a tree. The report said Andrew Cellie and Daniel Varovi were Whitehead's financial backers and assistants. Whitehead expressed his desire to keep the location of any future experiments hidden to avoid drawing a crowd that might make a \\"snap-shot verdict of failure\\". The aviation event for which Whitehead is now best known reportedly took place in Fairfield, Connecticut, on 14 August 1901 and was described at length in an article in the edition of 18 August 1901 of the weekly Bridgeport Herald newspaper.The Bridgeport Herald displays the name Sunday Herald on some of its pages. The newspaper may also be referred to as the Bridgeport Sunday Herald. Microfilm records of the newspaper.Image of newspaper page at: Page 5 of 18 August 1901 edition of Bridgeport Herald and at: Photocopy of the Bridgeport Herald, 18 August 1901 The article, written as an eyewitness report, stated that Whitehead piloted his Number 21 aircraft in a controlled powered flight for about half a mile, reaching a height of and landing safely. The unsigned article is widely attributed to journalist Richard Howell, later the newspaper's editor.Witkowski, Mary K., \\"Images of America ‚Äì Bridgeport At Work\\" p. 85.Randolph, Stella, \\"Lost Flights of Gustave Whitehead\\", p. 46Delear, 1996. The flight, if it actually took place, preceded the Wright brothers' first powered flights near Kitty Hawk in 1903 by more than two years, and exceeded the best one, which covered at a height of about . The article was accompanied by a drawing, also credited by some Whitehead researchers to Howell, which depicted the aircraft in flight. The drawing was purportedly based on a photograph, which has not been proven to exist. Information from the article was reprinted in the New York Herald, Boston Transcript and The Washington Times, which ran it on 23 August 1901. In the following months, dozens of other newspapers around the world published articles mentioning the reported flight or other aviation activity by Whitehead.Library of Congress, Chronicling America website retrieved on 10 January 2012 The drawing which accompanied the article on page 5 of 18 August 1901 Bridgeport Herald The Bridgeport Herald reported that Whitehead and another man drove to the testing area in the machine, which, when the wings were folded along its sides, functioned as a car. Two other people, including the newspaper reporter, followed on bicycles. For short distances, the Number 21's speed was close to thirty miles an hour on the uneven road, and the article said, \\"there seems no doubt that the machine can reel off forty miles an hour and not exert the engine to its fullest capacity.\\". The newspaper reported that before attempting to pilot the aircraft, Whitehead successfully test flew it unmanned, using tether ropes and sandbag ballast. When Whitehead was ready to make a manned flight, the article said: \\"By this time the light was good. Faint traces of the rising sun began to suggest themselves in the east.\\" According to the newspaper article, trees blocked the way after the flight had started. Whitehead was quoted as saying, \\"I knew that I could not clear them by rising higher, and also that I had no means of steering around them by using the machinery.\\" The article said Whitehead quickly thought of a solution to steer around the trees: Junius Harworth said that as a boy he saw Whitehead fly on 14 August 1901. > He simply shifted his weight more to one side than the other. This careened > the ship to one side. She turned her nose away from the clump of sprouts > when within fifty yards of them and took her course around them as prettily > as a yacht on the sea avoids a bar. The ability to control the air ship in > this manner appeared to give Whitehead confidence, for he was seen to take > time to look at the landscape about him. He looked back and waved his hand > exclaiming, 'I've got it at last.' When Whitehead neared the end of a field, the article said he turned off the motor and the aircraft landed \\"so lightly that Whitehead was not jarred in the least.\\" Junius Harworth, who as a boy was one of Whitehead's helpers, said Whitehead flew the airplane at another time in mid-1901 from Howard Avenue East to Wordin Avenue, along the edge of property belonging to the local gas company. Upon landing, Harworth said, the machine was turned around and another hop was made back to the starting point. On 21 September 1901, Collier's Weekly ran a picture of Whitehead's \\"latest flying machine\\" and said that he \\"recently made a successful flight of half a mile\\". On 19 November 1901, The Evening World (New York) ran a story about Whitehead's achievements and included a photograph of him sitting on his new flying machine. The article quotes him saying, \\"within a year people will be buying airships as freely as they are buying automobiles today and the sky will be dotted with figures skimming the air\\". On 7 December 1901, the Coconino Sun ran a story that stated Gustave Whitehead was the \\"inventor of the flying machine\\" and was planning a flight to New York.Coconino Sun, Flagstaff, AZ 7 December 1901 During this period of activity, Whitehead also reportedly tested an unmanned and unpowered flying machine, towed by men pulling ropes. A witness said the craft rose above telephone lines, flew across a road and landed undamaged. The distance covered was later measured at approximately 1,000 ft (305 m). = 1902 = Whitehead claimed two spectacular flights on 17 January 1902 in his improved Number 22, with a 40 hp (30 kW) motor instead of the 20 hp (15 kW) used in the Number 21, and aluminum instead of bamboo for structural components. In two published letters he wrote to American Inventor magazine, Whitehead said the flights took place over Long Island Sound. He said the distance of the first flight was about two miles (3.2 km) and the second was seven miles (11 km) in a circle at heights up to 200 ft (61 m). He said the airplane, which had a boat-like fuselage, landed safely in the water near the shore. For steering, Whitehead said he varied the speed of the two propellers and also used the aircraft rudder. He said the techniques worked well on his second flight and enabled him to fly a big circle back to the shore where his helpers waited. In his first letter, he expressed pride in the accomplishment: \\"... as I successfully returned to my starting place with a machine hitherto untried and heavier than air, I consider the trip quite a success. To my knowledge it is the first of its kind. This matter has so far never been published.\\" In his second letter he wrote, \\"This coming Spring I will have photographs made of Machine No. 22 in the air.\\" He said snapshots, apparently taken during his claimed flights of 17 January 1902, \\"did not come out right\\" because of cloudy and rainy weather. The magazine editor replied that he and readers would \\"await with interest the promised photographs of the machine in the air,\\" but there were no further letters nor any photographs from Whitehead. Anton Pruckner, a mechanic and assistant to Whitehead, signed an affidavit concerning the claimed 17 January 1902 flight: \\"... I knew that the flight took place because of talk by those who had seen it and because Whitehead himself had told me he made it ... I believe Whitehead made that flight, as his aircraft did fly well and with the bigger engine we had built, the plane was capable of such a flight. Whitehead was of fine moral character and never in all the long time I was associated with him or knew him did he ever appear to exaggerate. I never knew him to lie; he was a very truthful man ... I saw his aircraft fly on many occasions.\\"O'Dwyer and Randolph. History by Contract. Fritz Majer and Sohn. (1978) p. 53-55 Gustave Whitehead's brother John arrived in Connecticut from California in April 1902, intending to offer help. He saw his brother's aircraft only on the ground, not in powered flight. He gave a description 33 years later of the engine and aircraft, including details of the steering apparatus: > Rudder was a combination of horizontal and vertical fin-like affair, the > principle the same as in the up-to-date airplanes. For steering there was a > rope from one of the foremost wing tip ribs to the opposite, running over a > pulley. In front of the operator was a lever connected to a pulley: the same > pulley also controlled the tail rudder at the same time. A 1935 article in Popular Aviation magazine, which renewed interest in Whitehead, said winter weather ruined the Number 22 airplane after Whitehead placed it unprotected in his yard following his claimed flights of January 1902. The article said Whitehead did not have money to build a shelter for the aircraft because of a quarrel with his financial backer. The article also reported that in early 1903, Whitehead built a 200-horsepower eight-cylinder engine, intended to power a new aircraft. Another financial backer insisted on testing the engine in a boat on Long Island Sound, but lost control and capsized, sending the engine to the bottom. = 1903 = 19 September 1903, Scientific American reported Whitehead made powered glider flights in a triplane machine towed by an assistant pulling a rope: \\"By running with the machine against the wind after the motor had been started, the aeroplane was made to skim along above the ground at heights of from 3 to 16 feet for a distance, without the operator touching, of about 350 yards. It was possible to have traveled a much longer distance, without the operator touching terra firma, but for the operator's desire not to get too far above it. Although the motor was not developing its full power, owing to the speed not exceeding 1,000 R.P.M., it developed sufficient to move the machine against the wind.\\"\\"Experiment with motor-driven aeroplanes\\", Scientific American, 19 September 1903 The article said a two-cycle motor powered a two-bladed diameter tractor propeller. The engine shown in the article was exhibited by Whitehead at the Second Annual Exhibit of the Aero Club of America in December 1906.  Aerial machines  The No. 21 aircraft.

Whitehead piloting his glider of 1903W√ºst, Albert: loc. cit. p. 135 Whitehead's Albatros-type glider, ca. 1905‚Äì1906 Whitehead did not give identifiers to his first aircraft, but according to Randolph and Harvey to the end of 1901 he had built \\"fifty-six airplanes\\". Whitehead's Number 21 monoplane had a wingspan of 36 ft (11 m). The fabric-covered wings were ribbed with bamboo, supported by steel wires and were very similar to the shape of the Lilienthal glider's wings. The arrangement for folding the wings also closely followed the Lilienthal design. The craft was powered by two engines: a ground engine of 10 hp (7.5 kW), intended to propel the front wheels to reach takeoff speed, and a 20 hp (15 kW) acetylene engine powering two propellers, which were designed to counter- rotate for stability. Whitehead described his No. 22 aircraft and compared some of its features to the No. 21 in a letter he wrote to the editor of American Inventor magazine, published 1 April 1902. He said the No. 22 had a five-cylinder 40 hp kerosene motor of his own design, weighing 120 lbs. He said ignition was \\"accomplished by its own heat and compression.\\" He described the aircraft as long, made mostly of steel and aluminum with wing ribs made of steel tubing, rather than bamboo, which was used in the Number 21 aircraft. He explained that the two front wheels were connected to the kerosene motor, and the rear wheels were used for steering while on the ground. He said the wing area was , and the covering was \\"the best silk obtainable.\\" The propellers were \\"6 feet in diameter ... made of wood ... covered with very thin aluminum sheeting.\\" He said the tail and wings could all be \\"folded up ... and laid against the sides of the body.\\" In 1905, he and Stanley Beach jointly filed for a patent ‚Äì issued 1908 ‚Äì for an \\"improved aeroplane\\" with a V-shaped trough body and fixed bird-like wings, the pilot hanging below supported by a swing seat. A jointly-designed biplane was built by Whitehead and fitted with a Whitehead 5-cylinder, water-cooled 50 hp motor. The pointed bow of the craft comprised a metal water tank, with hot water being sprayed against the sides inside for cooling.Jane's All the World's Air-Ships, 1909, page 260. (text and heavily-retouched photograph) Whitehead also built gliders until about 1906 and was photographed flying them.  Later career  In addition to his work on flying machines, Whitehead built engines. In 1904, he attended the St. Louis World's Fair and displayed an aeronautical motor.Crouch, A Dream of Wings: Americans and the airplane, 1875‚Äì1905, p. 119 Air Enthusiast wrote: \\"Weisskopf's ability and mechanical skill could have made him a wealthy man at a time when there was an ever-increasing demand for lightweight engines, but he was far more interested in flying.\\" Instead, Whitehead only accepted enough engine orders to sustain aviation experiments. His aeronautical work was described in a chapter titled \\"The Conquest of the Air\\" in a 1904 book, Modern Industrial Progress, by Charles Henry Cochrane. The book said Whitehead had experimented with a \\"three-deck machine\\" and attached a 12 hp motor driving a tractor propeller after tests showed the craft could carry more than his weight. Test of the machine were described as \\"sufficiently satisfactory that another is being built.\\"Modern Industrial Progress, Charles Henry Cochrane, J.B. Lippincott Co., Philadelphia and London, 1904, p. 97 In 1908, Whitehead designed and built a 75 hp lightweight two-cycle motor at the suggestion of aviation pioneer George A. Lawrence, who was having difficulty obtaining an aeronautic engine. The water-cooled machine was designed so that functional cylinders continued to work if others failed, a safety factor to help avoid accidents due to engine failure. The men formed Whitehead Motor Works with an office in New York City and a factory in Bridgeport, Connecticut, that built motors in three sizes: 25, 40 and 75 hp, weighing 95, 145 and 200 pounds respectively.Cycle and Automobile Trade Journal Vol. 14, p. 203, Clinton Co., 1910 Whitehead's business practices were unsophisticated and he was sued by a customer, resulting in a threat that his tools and equipment would be seized. He hid his engines and most of his tools in a neighbor's cellar and continued his aviation work. One of his engines was installed by aviation pioneer Charles Wittemann in a helicopter built by Lee Burridge of the Aero Club of America, but the craft failed to fly. Whitehead's own 1911 studies of the vertical flight problem resulted in a 60-bladed helicopter, which, unmanned, lifted itself off the ground. He lost an eye in a factory accident and also suffered a severe blow to the chest from a piece of factory equipment, an injury that may have led to increasing attacks of angina. Despite these setbacks, he exhibited an aircraft at Hempstead, New York, as late as 1915. He continued to work and invent. He designed a braking safety device, hoping to win a prize offered by a railroad. He demonstrated it as a scale model but won nothing. He constructed an \\"automatic\\" concrete-laying machine, which he used to help build a road north of Bridgeport. These inventions brought him no more profit than did his airplanes and engines.Delear, pp 1‚Äì10 Around 1915 Whitehead worked in a factory as a laborer and repaired motors to support his family. He died of a heart attack, on 10 October 1927, after attempting to lift an engine out of a car he was repairing. He stumbled onto his front porch and into his home, then collapsed dead in the house.  Rediscovery  Whitehead's work remained mostly unknown to the public and aeronautical community after 1911 until a 1935 article was published in Popular Aviation magazine, co-authored by educator and journalist Stella Randolph and aviation history buff Harvey Phillips. Randolph expanded the article into the book Lost Flights of Gustave Whitehead, published in 1937. She sought out people who had known Whitehead and had seen his flying machines and engines, and she obtained 16 affidavits from 14 people and included the text of their statements in the book. Four people said that they did not see flights, while the others said that they saw flights of various types, ranging from a few feet to hundreds of feet to more than a mile. Harvard University economics professor John B. Crane wrote an article for National Aeronautic Magazine in December 1936 disputing claims and reports that Whitehead flew, but he adopted a different tone the following year, after further research. He told reporters, \\"There are several people still living in Bridgeport who testified to me under oath, they had seen Whitehead make flights along the streets of Bridgeport in the early 1900s.\\" Crane reported Harworth's claim of having witnessed a 1¬Ω- mile airplane flight made by Whitehead on 14 August 1901, and he suggested that a Congressional investigation should consider the claims. In 1949, Crane published a new article in Air Affairs magazine which supported claims that Whitehead flew, but he made no reference to his first article, nor did he refute his previous evidence. In 1963, reserve Air Force major William O'Dwyer discovered photographs in the attic of a Connecticut house showing a 1910 Whitehead \\"Large Albatross\\"-type biplane aircraft at rest on the ground. The Connecticut Aeronautical Historical Association (CAHA) asked him and his 9315th U.S. Air Force Reserve Squadron to investigate whether Whitehead had made powered flights.Earlyaviators O'Dwyer continued his research for years and became convinced that Whitehead did fly before the Wright brothers. Former CAHA president Harvey Lippincott said in 1981 that Whitehead \\"may have flown 100 to 200 feet, 10 to 15 feet off the ground. This is confirmed by the witnesses that we have interviewed and talked with, and this seems reasonable for the state of the art in aviation at that time.\\"What role did the Connecticut Aeronautical Historical Association (CAHA) play in the recognition of Gustave Whitehead?Gustave Whitehead: \\"First in Flight\\". Retrieved 18 February 2016 O'Dwyer later contributed interviews of reputed flight witnesses to a second book by Stella Randolph The Story of Gustave Whitehead, Before the Wrights Flew, published in 1966.Randolph, Stella. The Story of Gustave Whitehead: Before the Wrights Flew, New York, G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1966, p. 120. O'Dwyer and Randolph also co-authored History by Contract, published in 1978, which criticized the Smithsonian Institution for signing an agreement with the estate of Orville Wright, requiring the Smithsonian to credit only the 1903 Wright Flyer for the first powered controlled flight.History by Contract, p.15, O'Dwyer and Randolph, 1978 In 1968, Connecticut officially recognized Whitehead as \\"Father of Connecticut Aviation\\". The North Carolina General Assembly passed a resolution in 1985 which repudiated the Connecticut statement and gave \\"no credence\\" to the assertion that Whitehead was first to fly, citing \\"leading aviation historians and the world's largest aviation museum\\" who determined that there was \\"no historic fact, documentation, record or research to support the claim\\". In 2013, Jane's All the World's Aircraft published an editorial which asserted that Whitehead was first to make a powered controlled flight.Jackson, Paul, FRAeS, Editor-in-Chief, \\"Justice delayed is justice denied\\", 8 March 2013, from \\"Foreword\\" to Jane's All the World's Aircraft, 2013 Edition, IHS/Janes, U.K. (as transcribed on the pro- Whitehead website Gustave-Whitehead.com), retrieved 18 October 2016 The editorial reignited debate over who flew first and motivated Connecticut to establish \\"Powered Flight Day\\" to honor Gustave Whitehead, rather than the Wright Brothers.\\"First in Flight?

Retrieved 14 February 2016  Evidence  = Witnesses = Andrew Cellie and James Dickie were named in the Bridgeport Herald article as two witnesses to Whitehead's early-morning flight. The article was published without a byline, but researchers and scholars on both sides of the controversy attribute it to Richard \\"Dick\\" Howell, the sports editor. James Dickie denied seeing a flight in a 1937 affidavit, taken during Stella Randolph's research. He said that he was not present at the flight on 14 August 1901, and that he thought that the newspaper story was \\"imaginary\\". He said that he did not know Andrew Cellie, the other associate of Whitehead who was supposed to be there, and that none of Whitehead's aircraft ever flew, as far as he knew. An article in Air Enthusiast, however, pointed out that Dickie's description of the airplane did not match Whitehead's Number 21. O'Dwyer had known Dickie since childhood and wrote that he spoke to him by telephone, and that Dickie had a grudge against Whitehead: > His mood changed to anger when I asked him about Gustave Whitehead. He > flatly refused to talk about Whitehead, and when I asked him why, he said: > \\"That SOB never paid me what he owed me. My father had a hauling business > and I often hitched up the horses and helped Whitehead take his airplane to > where he wanted to go. I will never give Whitehead credit for anything. I > did a lot of work for him and he never paid me a dime. O'Dwyer wrote that Dickie's 1937 affidavit had \\"little value\\" and that there were inconsistencies between the affidavit and his interview with Dickie. There is no known transcript or recording of his interview. Andrew Cellie was the other eyewitness to the flight on 14 August 1901 named by the Bridgeport Herald, but Randolph could not locate him for an interview in the 1930s. O'Dwyer searched through old Bridgeport city directories in the 1970s and concluded that the newspaper likely misspelled the man's name. He surmised that it was Andrew Suelli, a Swiss or German immigrant also known as Zulli and Whitehead's nextdoor neighbor before moving to the Pittsburgh area in 1902. Suelli's former neighbors in Fairfield told O'Dwyer that Suelli had \\"always claimed he was present when Whitehead flew in 1901.\\" Junius Harworth and Anton Pruckner sometimes worked for Whitehead, and they gave statements to Stella Randolph that they saw him fly on 14 August 1901. Anton Pruckner was a tool maker who worked for a few years with Whitehead, and he attested in 1934 to the flight. He also attested to a January 1902 flight by Whitehead over Long Island Sound; the 1988 Air Enthusiast article, however, said that \\"Pruckner was not present on the occasion, though he was told of the events by Weisskopf himself.\\" Whitehead claimed in his first letter to American Inventor that he made four trips in the airplane on 14 August 1901, and that the longest was 1¬Ω miles. Witnesses reported seeing several different flights on 14 August 1901. The Bridgeport Herald reported that a half-mile flight occurred early in the morning on 14 August, and Whitehead and Harworth said that a one and a half- mile flight was made later that day. In all, witnesses reported that four flights took place on 14 August 1901.O'Dwyer and Randolph. History by Contract. Fritz Majer and Sohn. p. 19 The following are from the affidavits that Stella Randolph collected in the 1930s, quoted in part: :Affidavit: Joe Ratzenberger ‚Äì 28 January 1936: > I recall a time, which I think was probably July or August 1901 or 1902, > when this plane was started in flight on the lot between Pine and Cherry > Streets.

The distance flown was approximately > one mile and a half. Other witnesses signed affidavits reporting additional powered flights in 1902. Elizabeth Koteles stated that she had witnessed a flight at Gypsy Spring which was 5 feet off the ground for a distance of 150 to 250 feet, and John Lesko also stated that he had witnessed a flight in Gypsy Spring.O'Dwyer and Randolph.

Fritz Majer and Sohn. (1978) O'Dwyer organized a survey of surviving witnesses to the flights. Members of the Connecticut Aeronautical Historical Association (CAHA) and the 9315th Squadron (O'Dwyer's Air Force Reserve unit) went door-to-door in Bridgeport, Fairfield, Stratford, and Milford, Connecticut to track down Whitehead's long-ago neighbors and helpers, and they also traced some who had moved away. Of an estimated 30 persons interviewed for affidavits or on tape, 20 said that they had seen flights, eight indicated that they had heard of the flights, and two said that Whitehead did not fly. = Photos = Whitehead and his Number 21 aircraft No photograph has been found conclusively showing any manned Whitehead machine in powered flight, although such photographs have been reported to exist.

The photo was mentioned in a 27 January 1906 Scientific American article which stated that the walls of the exhibit were covered with a large collection of photographs showing the machines of various inventors. The report said, \\"No photographs of ... man-carrying machines in flight were shown, nor has any trustworthy account of their reported achievements ever been published.

They were told that a sea captain named Brown had made a logbook entry describing Whitehead flying over Long Island Sound and had even photographed the airplane in flight. A friend told Kosch that he had found the captain's leather-bound journal containing a photo of Whitehead in flight and a description of the event. After some difficulty, Kosch made contact with the owners of the journal, but they told him that it was lost.  Controversy  = Bridgeport Herald article and drawing = Stella Randolph stated in Lost Flights of Gustave Whitehead (1937) that Richard Howell wrote the article about a Whitehead flight in the Bridgeport Herald,Randolph, Stella (1937), Lost Flights of Gustave Whitehead, Washington, D.C., Places, Inc., pp.18,46 although the article carried no byline. O'Dwyer wrote that Howell made the drawing of the No. 21 in flight which accompanied the newspaper article, saying that Howell was \\"an artist before he became a reporter.\\" O'Dwyer spent hours in the Bridgeport Library studying virtually everything that Howell wrote, and he concluded: \\"Howell was always a very serious writer. He always used sketches rather than photographs with his features on inventions. He was highly regarded by his peers on other local newspapers. He used the florid style of the day, but was not one to exaggerate.\\"Delear, 1996, p. 5 Kosch said, \\"If you look at the reputation of the editor of the Bridgeport Herald in those days, you find that he was a reputable man. He wouldn't make this stuff up.\\" Howell died before the controversy began concerning Whitehead. Gibbs- Smith doubted the veracity of the account and complained that the newspaper article \\"reads like a work of juvenile fiction.\\"Gibbs-Smith, 2000, pp. 286‚Äì287. Aviation historian Carroll Gray asserts that similarities in the Bridgeport Herald newspaper story show that it is a broad rewrite of an article published in the New York Sun newspaper on 9 June 1901. Gray points out that the Sun article described an unmanned test of a Whitehead flying machine on 3 May 1901, but the Bridgeport Herald changed this to a manned flight.\\"Out Fairfield Way\\" FlyingMachines.org.

In the Bridgeport Sunday Post, she quoted her husband's excited first words upon returning from Fairfield on 14 August 1901: \\"Mama, we went up!\\" She said that her husband was always busy with motors and flying machines when he was not working in coal yards or factories, but she never saw any of her husband's reported flights. Smithsonian Institution Curator of Aeronautics Peter L. Jakab said that Whitehead's wife and family did not know about his August 1901 flights.Bridgeport Telegram, 26 September 1926 Louise Whitehead told Randolph that she sewed the material for the wings on the plane and took care of the household, but did not watch any experiments.Randolph, Stella (1937), Lost Flights of Gustave Whitehead, Washington, D.C.

American, 10 April 1939 In 1908, Beach and Whitehead received a patent for a monoplane glider. There were multiple articles published in Scientific American under Beach's editorship in 1903, 1906, and 1908 which stated that Whitehead had conducted \\"short flights\\" and flew \\"short distances\\" in 1901, similar to the hops made by Maxim and Herring.Sci.

Gardner, Secretary of the Institute of the Aeronautical Sciences in New York. It was not published, but Beach gave permission for changes to be made in the statement, and it was edited by Gardner and aviation publisher Earl Findley, a close friend of Orville Wright. Researcher Susan O'Dwyer Brinchman suggests that Findley and Gardner hoped that the statement would help to defend the Wright brothers' primacy in flight against the recent challenge in Randolph's article and book.\\"Smithsonian conspiracy to deny Whitehead flew first now provable\\" Gustave Whitehead: \\"First in Flight\\". Retrieved 17 February 2016 Beach's edited statement was sent to Wright, who relied on it in 1945 to rebut renewed publicity about Whitehead. The edited statement said: \\"I do not believe that any of his machines ever left the ground under their own power in spite of the assertions of many persons who think they saw him fly.\\" It also said that Whitehead never told Beach that he had flown. The statement offered some words of praise, saying that Whitehead \\"deserves a place in early aviation, due to his having gone ahead and built extremely light engines and aeroplanes. The five-cylinder kerosene one, with which he claims to have flown over Long Island Sound on 17 January 1902 was, I believe, the first aviation Diesel.\\" O'Dwyer believed that Beach had \\"recanted\\" his earlier view that Whitehead had flown, as indicated by the Scientific American articles. He asserted that Beach became a \\"politician\\", \\"rarely missing an opportunity to mingle with the Wright tide that had turned against Whitehead, notably after Whitehead's death in 1927.\\" O'Dwyer argued in History by Contract that Beach's statement was self- contradictory. In one part, it claims that Whitehead did not fly, and in another it describes how Whitehead's machine always landed safely in \\"pancaking\\" fashion. = The Smithsonian = Excerpt of the agreement with the Orville Wright estate. Reports that Whitehead made a flight in Connecticut were noticed by the Smithsonian Institution. Smithsonian Secretary Samuel Langley at the time was building his manned aircraft, the Large Aerodrome \\"A\\". Langley's chief engineer, Charles M. Manly, suspected claims for the Whitehead machine were \\"fraudulent.\\" He requested Smithsonian employee F.W. Hodge to inspect the Number 21 aircraft, which Whitehead had put on display in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Hodge reported the machine did not appear to be airworthy.Crouch, The Bishop's Boys, p. 498 For many years the Smithsonian Institution did not formally recognize the 1903 Wright Flyer as first in flight. Instead, it proclaimed the Langley Aerodrome as first to be \\"capable\\" of manned powered flight. This policy offended the surviving Wright brother, Orville, who sent the Wright Flyer to the Science Museum in London on long- term loan, rather than donate it to the Smithsonian. In 1942 the Smithsonian publicly recanted its position, and Orville agreed to bring back the Flyer. As a condition for receiving the airplane, the Smithsonian signed an agreement in 1948 with executors of Orville Wright's estate. Popularly called a \\"contract,\\" the agreement required the Smithsonian to recognize only the 1903 Wright Flyer, and no other aircraft, as first to make a manned, powered, controlled flight. The agreement, which was not made public, allowed the Wright family to reclaim the Flyer if the Smithsonian failed to comply. of the agreement is on this of the \\"glennhcurtiss.com\\" website. The Agreement is also available upon request from the National Air and Space Museum of the Smithsonian Institution. In 1975, O'Dwyer learned about the agreement from Harold S. Miller, an executor of the Orville Wright estate. O'Dwyer obtained release of the document with help from Connecticut U.S. Senator Lowell Weicker and the U.S. Freedom of Information Act. O'Dwyer said that during an earlier 1969 conversation with Paul E. Garber, a Smithsonian curator of early aircraft, Garber denied that a contract existed and said he \\"could never agree to such a thing.\\" The 1978 book co-authored by O'Dwyer and Randolph, History by Contract argued that the Smithsonian compromised its objectivity when it signed a 1948 agreement with the estate of Orville Wright requiring the Institution to recognize the 1903 Wright Flyer as the first aircraft to make a manned, powered, controlled flight or forfeit possession of the aircraft. The book published correspondence between O'Dwyer and the Smithsonian in which he asked the Institution to look at the evidence and to attend interviews of people who said they saw Whitehead fly. The book called for nullification of the agreement. George Gunther, a Connecticut state senator, said History by Contract was too heavy-handed. Gunther said he had been having \\"cordial\\" conversations with the Smithsonian about giving some credit to Whitehead, \\"but after O'Dwyer blasted them in his book, well, that totally turned them off.\\" According to the Smithsonian, the agreement was implemented to close the long- running feud with the Wright family over the Institution's false claims for the Aerodrome. Brinchman documented that Gardner and Findley, who helped Orville rebut the Whitehead claims, also participated in crafting text in the agreement that the Institution is required to use in its labeling of the Wright Flyer. The agreement remains in effect to the present day. In 2005, Peter Jakab of the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum (NASM) said the agreement would not stop the Smithsonian from recognizing anyone as inventor of the first airplane if indisputable evidence were found: \\"We would present as accurate a presentation of the history of the invention of the airplane as possible, regardless of the consequences this might incur involving the agreement. Having said that, however, at this time, as in 1948, there is no compelling evidence that Whitehead or anyone else flew before the Wright brothers.\\" In 2013 senior aeronautics curator Tom Crouch of NASM said, \\"I can only hope that, should persuasive evidence for a prior flight be presented, my colleagues and I would have the courage and the honesty to admit the new evidence and risk the loss of the Wright Flyer.\\"\\"The Flight Claims of Gustave Whitehead\\" Air&Space; Smithsonian.

Statements obtained by Stella Randolph in the 1930s from two of Whitehead's workers, Cecil Steeves and Anton Pruckner, claimed that the Wright brothers visited Whitehead's shop a year or two before their 1903 flights. The January 1988 Air Enthusiast magazine states: \\"Both Cecil Steeves and Junius Harworth remember the Wrights; Steeves described them and recalled their telling Weisskopf that they had received his letter indicating an exchange of correspondence.\\" Steeves said that the Wright brothers, \\"under the guise of offering to help finance his inventions, actually received inside information that aided them materially in completing their own plane.\\" Steeves related that Whitehead said to him, \\"Now since I have given them the secrets of my invention they will probably never do anything in the way of financing me.\\" Orville Wright denied that he or his brother ever visited Whitehead at his shop and stated that the first time they were in Bridgeport was 1909 \\"and then only in passing through on the train.\\"O.

O'Dwyer said Octave Chanute \\"encouraged\\" the Wrights to look into engines built by Whitehead. In a letter to Wilbur Wright on 3 July 1901, Chanute made a single reference to Whitehead, saying: \\"I have a letter from Carl E.

That claim was repeated in a Liberty magazine article, which was condensed in a Reader's Digest article that reached a very large audience. Orville Wright, then in his seventies, countered the magazine articles by writing \\"The Mythical Whitehead Flight\\", which appeared in the August 1945 issue of U.S. Air Services,\\"Orville Wright in US Air Service, August 1945, p.9\\" Gustave Whitehead ‚Äì Pioneer Aviator. Retrieved 16 February 2016, a publication with a far smaller but very influential readership. Orville began by questioning why the Bridgeport Herald \\"withheld\\" such important aeronautical news four days and suggested the story thus must not be true. Whitehead researchers have pointed out that the Herald was not a daily newspaper but a weekly, published only on Sundays. Orville noted that James Dickie, named as a witness by the Herald, had declared in an affidavit that he was not present at the event, did not know the other named witness and never saw a Whitehead aircraft fly. Orville discussed John J. Dvorak, a physics professor at Washington University in St. Louis, who had designed an engine and hired Whitehead to build it after praising him publicly. Dvorak became dissatisfied with Whitehead's progress on the engine and severed the business relationship. Orville quoted Dvorak's 1936 affidavit: \\"I personally do not believe that Whitehead ever succeeded in making any airplane flights.\\" Dvorak's negative comments that Orville quoted included the phrases: \\"Whitehead did not possess sufficient mechanical skill ... was given to gross exaggeration ... He had delusions.\\" Orville also relied on the unpublished statement by Stanley Beach. Orville wrote that Whitehead never told Beach he had flown, and that Beach believed none of Whitehead's aircraft ever left the ground under their own power. Orville asserted that if Whitehead had flown, Beach would surely have known about it after associating frequently with Whitehead for nine years and helping him financially. Orville's critical comments were later quoted by both the Smithsonian Institution and British aviation historian Charles Harvard Gibbs-Smith.  Replica aircraft  To show that the No. 21 aircraft might have flown, Andy Kosch formed the group \\"Hangar 21\\" and led construction of a reproduction of the craft. On 29 December 1986 Kosch made 20 flights and reached a maximum distance of . The reproduction, dubbed \\"21B,\\" was also shown at the 1986 Experimental Aircraft Association Fly-In. In 1986, American actor and accomplished aviator Cliff Robertson was contacted by the Hangar 21 group in Bridgeport and was asked to attempt to fly their reproduction No.21 while under tow behind a sports car, for the benefit of the press. Robertson said \\"We did a run and nothing happened. And we did a second run and nothing happened. Then the wind came up a little and we did another run and, sure enough, I got her up and flying. Then we went back and did a second one.\\" Robertson commented, \\"We will never take away the rightful role of the Wright brothers, but if this poor little German immigrant did indeed get an airplane to go up and fly one day, then let's give him the recognition he deserves.\\" On 18 February 1998, another reproduction of No. 21 was flown in Germany. The director of the aerospace department at Deutsches Museum stated that such a replica was not proof that the original did actually fly. The 1998 reproduction used modern research and materials such as fiberglass, and had a modern engine.  Honors  Connecticut Governor John N.

As a lawyer and judge he was a leading proponent of civil liberties, championing the rights of the jury, and limiting the powers of the State in leading cases such as Entick v Carrington. He held the offices of Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, Attorney-General and Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain, and was a confidant of Pitt the Elder, supporting Pitt in the controversies over John Wilkes and American independence. However, he clung to office himself, even when Pitt was out of power, serving in the cabinet for fifteen years and under five different prime ministers. During his life, Pratt played a leading role in opposing perpetual copyright, resolving the regency crisis of 1788 and in championing Fox's Libel Bill. He started the development of the settlement that was later to become Camden Town in London. Early life Born in Kensington in 1714, he was a descendant of an old Devon family of high standing, the third son of Sir John Pratt, Chief Justice of the King's Bench in the reign of George I.[Anon.] (1911) Charles's mother, Elizabeth, was the daughter of Rev. Hugh Wilson of Trefeglwys, and the aunt of landscape painter Richard Wilson. He received his early education at Eton, where he became acquainted with William Pitt, and King's College, Cambridge. He had already developed an interest in constitutional law and civil liberties. In 1734 he became a fellow of his college, and in the following year obtained his degree of BA. Having adopted his father's profession, he had entered the Middle Temple in 1728, and ten years later he was called to the Bar. Early years at the Bar He practised at first in the courts of common law, travelling also the western circuit. For some years his practice was so limited, and he became so much discouraged that he seriously thought of turning his back on the law and entering the church. He listened, however, to the advice of his friend Sir Robert Henley, a brother barrister, and persevered, working on and waiting for success. Reputedly, once instructed as Henley's junior, Henley feigned illness so that Pratt could lead and earn the credit.Rigg (1896) He was further aided by an advantageous marriage on 5 October 1749 to Elizabeth, daughter of Nicholas Jeffreys of the Priory, Brecknock, by whom he had a son John Jeffreys, his successor in title and estates, and four daughters,Thomas (2008). Rigg (1896) has three daughters. of whom the eldest, Frances, married Robert Stewart, 1st Marquess of Londonderry on 7 June 1775. The first case which brought him prominently into notice and gave him assurance of ultimate success was the government prosecution, in 1752, of a bookseller, William Owen. Owen had published a book The Case of Alexander Murray, Esq; in an Appeal to the people of Great Britain which the House of Commons had, by resolution of the House, condemned as \\"an impudent, malicious, scandalous and seditious libel\\". The author had left the country so the weight of the government's censure fell on Owen.Towers (1764) Pratt appeared in Owen's defence and his novel argument was that it was not the sole role of the jury to determine the fact of publication but that it was further their right to assess the intent of a libel. In his summing up, the judge, Lord Chief Justice Sir William Lee directed the jury to find Owen guilty as publication was proved and the intent of the contents was a question of law for the judge, not a question of fact for the jury. The jury disagreed and acquitted Owen. Pratt was appointed King's Counsel in 1755, and knighted in December 1761. Political career William Pitt the Elder Since their youthful meeting at Eton, Pitt had continued to consult Pratt on legal and constitutional matters and Pratt became involved in the group that met at the Leicester House home of George Prince of Wales and who were opposed to the government of Prime Minister the Duke of Newcastle. In 1756, Newcastle offered Pratt a judgeship but Pratt preferred to take the role of Attorney General to the Prince of Wales. In July 1757, Pitt formed a coalition government with Newcastle and insisted on Pratt's appointment as Attorney-General. Pratt was preferred over Solicitor General Charles Yorke. Yorke was the son of Lord Hardwicke, a political ally of Newcastle who, as Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain had obstructed Pratt's career in favour of his own son. Though this led to an uncomfortable relationship between the two law officers of the Crown, it led to the landmark Pratt-Yorke opinion of 24 December 1757 whereby the pair distinguished overseas territories acquired by conquest from those acquired by private treaty. They asserted that, while the Crown of Great Britain enjoyed sovereignty over both, only the property of the former was vested in the Crown. Though the original opinion related to the British East India Company, it came to be applied elsewhere in the developing British Empire. The same year he entered the House of Commons as Member of Parliament (MP) for the borough of Downton in Wiltshire. He sat in Parliament for four years, but did not distinguish himself as a debater. He introduced the Habeas corpus Amendment Bill of 1758, which was intended to extend the writ of Habeas corpus from criminal law to civil and political cases. Despite Pitt's support, the Bill fell in the House of Lords. At the same time, his professional practice increased, particularly his Chancery practice which made him financially secure and enabled him to purchase the Camden Place estate in Kent. As Attorney-General, Pratt prosecuted Florence Hensey, an Irishman who had spied for France,(1758) 19 Howell's State Trials 1372 and John Shebbeare, a violent party writer of the day. Shebbeare had published a libel against the government contained in his Letters to the People of England, which were published in 1756‚Äì58. As evidence of Pratt's moderation in a period of passionate party warfare and frequent state trials, it is notable that this was the only official prosecution for libel that he started and that he maintained his earlier insistence that the decision lay with the jury. He led for the Crown in the prosecution of Laurence Shirley, 4th Earl Ferrers for the murder of a servant, a case that shocked European society. Wilkes and Entick Sir Charles Pratt by Joshua Reynolds. Pratt lost his patron when Pitt left office in October 1761 but in January 1762, he resigned from the Commons, was raised to the bench as Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, received the customary knighthood and was sworn into the Privy Council. The Common Pleas was not an obvious forum for a jurist with constitutional interest, dealing as it did principally with disputes between private parties. However, on 30 April 1763, Member of Parliament John Wilkes was arrested under a general warrant for alleged seditious libel in issue No.45 of The North Briton. Pratt freed Wilkes holding that parliamentary privilege gave him immunity from arrest on such a charge. The decision earned Pratt some favour with the radical faction in London and seems to have spurred him, over the summer of that year to encourage juries to award disproportionate and excessive damages to printers unlawfully arrested over the same matter. Wilkes was awarded ¬£1,000 (¬£127,000 at 2003 prices) and Pratt condemned the use of general warrants for entry and search. Pratt pronounced with decisive and almost passionate energy against their legality, thus giving voice to the strong feeling of the nation and winning for himself an extraordinary degree of popularity as one of the maintainers of English civil liberties. Honours fell thick upon him in the form of addresses from the City of London and many large towns, and of presentations of freedom from various corporate bodies. In 1762, the home of John Entick had been raided by officers of the Crown, searching for evidence of sedition. In the case of Entick v Carrington (1765), Pratt held that the raids were unlawful as they were without authority in statute or in common law.Thomas (2008) The American Stamp Act crisis On 17 July 1765 Pratt was created Baron Camden, of Camden Place, in Chislehurst, Kent, becoming a member of the House of Lords. Prime Minister Lord Rockingham had unsuccessfully made this, and other appointments, to curry favour with Pitt but Camden was not over-eager to get involved in the crisis surrounding the Stamp Act 1765. Camden did attend the Commons on 14 January 1766 and his subsequent speeches on the matter in the Lords are so similar to Pitt's that he had clearly adopted the party line. He was one of only five Lords who voted against the Declaratory Act, a resolution of the House insisting on parliament's right to tax colonies overseas. Camden insisted that taxation was predicated on consent and that consent needed representation. However, when he came to support the government over the Act's repeal, he rather unconvincingly purported to base his opinion on the actual hardship caused by the Act rather than its constitutional basis. Lord Chancellor In May 1766, Pitt again became prime minister and advanced Camden from the court of common pleas to take his seat as Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain on 30 July. Camden managed to negotiate an additional allowance of ¬£1500 and a position for his son John. Camden carried out the role in an efficient manner, without any great legal innovation. He presided over the Court of Chancery from which only one of his decisions was overturned on appeal. He also presided over the judicial functions of the House of Lords where in 1767 he approved Lord Mansfield's ruling that the City of London could not fine dissenters who refused to serve the corporation. Dissenters were in any case prohibited from serving under the Corporation Act 1661. In 1768 in the House of Lords he again sat in a case involving John Wilkes, this time rejecting his appeal and finding that his consecutive, rather than concurrent sentences were lawful. He gave a controversial judgment in the Douglas Peerage case. =\\"A forty days tyranny\\"= However, Camden the politician was less of a champion of civil rights than Pratt the judge. The poor harvest of 1766 led to fears of high grain prices and starvation but parliament was prorogued and could not renew the export ban that expired on 26 August. Pitt, with Camden's support, called the Privy Council to issue a royal proclamation on 26 September to prohibit grain exports until parliament met. However, despite Camden's record on civil liberties, this proclamation was unlawful, contrary to art.2 of the Bill of Rights 1689 and both houses of parliament ultimately accused Pitt and Camden of tyranny. Camden pleaded necessity, a justification he had rejected in the Wilkes and Carrington trials, and styled it \\"a forty days tyranny\\". Ultimately the government was forced to suppress the parliamentary attacks by an act indemnifying those involved from legal action. =America= In 1767, the cabinet, of which Camden was a member, approved Charles Townshend's attempt to settle the American protest and revolt over taxation. Benjamin Franklin reportedly observed that it was \\"internal\\" taxes that the colonists objected to and Townshend took this to suggest that there would be little opposition to import duties imposed at the ports. Camden's support for the tax proposals would return to embarrass him. Pitt and his followers had, after their initial opposition, come to support the Declaratory Act of 1766 which asserted Great Britain's sovereignty over the American colonies. Further, continued unrest in America, stemming from Townshend's 1767 taxation scheme, brought a robust response from Pitt and Camden was his spokesman in the Lords. However, towards the end of 1767, Pitt, now raised to the Lords as Earl Chatham, fell ill and the Duke of Grafton stepped in as caretaker. Camden became indecisive in his own political role, writing to Grafton on 4 October 1768: Pitt resigned on 14 October and Camden, who continued to sit in the cabinet as Lord Chancellor, now took up a position of uncompromising hostility to the governments of Grafton and Lord North on America and on Wilkes. Camden opposed Lord Hillsborough's confrontational approach to the Americas, favouring conciliation and working on the development of reformed tax proposals. Camden personally promised the colonies that no further taxes would be levied, and voted in the cabinet minority who sought to repeal the tea duty. =John Wilkes MP= John Wilkes On 28 March 1768, Wilkes was surprisingly elected as member for Middlesex, much to Grafton's distaste. Grafton canvassed Camden on whether Wilkes could be removed from parliament and Camden responded that, under the parliamentary privilege of the House to regulate its own membership, Wilkes could, though lawfully elected, be lawfully expelled. However, Camden saw that this was only likely to lead to Wilkes's re-election and an escalating crisis. The cabinet decided to seek Wilkes's expulsion but Camden was not content with the policy. By the end of 1769 he was in open opposition to the government and was making little contribution to discussions in cabinet. Only Royal pressure kept him in post. However, by the beginning of 1770, Chatham had returned to the fray, opposing government policies on Wilkes and America. On 9 January 1770, Chatham moved a motion opposing the government's policies and Camden stepped down from the woolsack to give a speech in support of the motion. However, he did not resign as Lord Chancellor until King George III, outraged by his conduct, demanded his dismissal on 17 January. He seems also to have resigned as a Chancery judge in late 1769. Working Lord =Into opposition= Chatham, Rockingham and Grenville were expected to combine to bring down Grafton, when it was expected that Lord Camden would return to the woolsack. However, though Grafton resigned, Lord North managed to form a successor administration and Camden was left to opposition, continuing to sit in the Lords. From 1770 onwards, Chatham neglected parliamentary attendance and left leadership of the house to Lord Shelburne with whom Camden could manage only the coolest of relationships. During 1770‚Äì71, Camden tussled with Lord Mansfield over the law of libel, Camden maintaining that the jury should not only decide whether the work in question was published but also whether the words themselves were defamatory or innocent. He opposed the extension of the Royal Marriages Act 1772 to all descendants of King George II, believing it to be impractical. In 1774, in the House of Lords appeal in the case of Donaldson v Beckett, Camden spoke against the concept of perpetual copyright for fear of inhibiting the advancement of learning. This was a key influence on the ultimate rejection of that year's Booksellers' Bill.Rose (1988) =The American crisis of 1774= The year 1774 brought a renewed crisis over America. The Boston Tea Party in 1773 led Lord North to seek a blockade of the city through the Boston Port Bill. Camden roundly criticised the taxes that had led to the American protests, as he had opposed them in Cabinet from 1767 to 1769, but was reminded that he was Lord Chancellor when they were imposed. The Chathamite faction went on to support the Bill and further to support the Massachusetts Government Act, Camden's inherent patriotism bringing him into line. However, by May, fears that the Bill would focus and strengthen American resistance led Camden to oppose the measure. On 16 February 1775, Camden made his major speech on the crisis, opposing public opinion and the New England Trade and Fishery Bill, a speech often believed to have been drafted in collaboration with Benjamin Franklin for an American audience. Camden invoked John Locke's dictum that resistance to tyranny was justified and called the Bill: Thomas Hutchinson observed: How Camden voted on the Quebec Act is unknown but in May 1775, and in response to a petition from a small number of settlers, he unsuccessfully moved its repeal. However, he seems to have been in the grip of a conspiracy theory that the Act's ulterior objective was to create an army of militant Roman Catholics in Canada to suppress the Protestant British colonists. =American War of Independence= The American War of Independence broke out in 1775 and Chatham's faction were dismayed. Their official line was to advocate mediation, refusing to think of either American independence or continued English hegemony. Camden continued to speak on the dilemma in parliament. He continued steadfastly to oppose the taxation of the American colonists, and signed, in 1778, the protest of the Lords in favour of an address to the King on the subject of the manifesto of the commissioners to America. In 1782 he was appointed Lord President of the Council under the Rockingham-Shelburne administration, supporting the government economic programme and anti- corruption drive, and championing repeal of the Declaratory Act 1720 in Ireland. Once Rockingham died in July, the Chathamite residue could only lose the Commons vote over the American peace terms the following February. Camden resigned and persuaded Shelburne to do the same. =The Younger Pitt= William Pitt the Younger Camden was a leading opponent of the ensuing Fox- North Coalition, denouncing it for patronage and leading the opposition to Fox's East India Bill that brought down the administration on 9 December 1783. William Pitt the Younger, the son of his former patron, came to power and within a few months Camden was reinstated as Lord President, holding the post until his death. He was created Earl Camden on 13 May 1786 and granted a further peerage as Viscount Bayham to lend his son a courtesy title. Camden took an animated part in the debates on important public matters till within two years of his death, in particular supporting Pitt's 1785 Parliamentary Reform Bill and the Irish trade proposals that same year. Camden continued to attend cabinet meetings and, after he moved to Hill Street, Berkeley Square on account of his ill health, cabinet meetings were sometimes held at his home. =Regency crisis of 1788= In November 1788, King George III fell ill and insanity was feared. Lord Chancellor Thurlow hesitated over what action to take, thereby precipitating the regency crisis of 1788. As Lord President, Camden led the Privy Council examination of the King's doctors' opinions. With Thurlow unwilling to lead the legislature, Camden grasped the challenge of inviting parliament to appoint a regent, in the face of the opposition's support for the automatic appointment of their ally the Prince of Wales. Camden's resolution that appointment rested with parliament was carried in the Lords by 99 votes to 66 on 23 December 1788. Moreover, on 22 January 1789, Camden's motion to appoint the Prince of Wales, but with restrictions in case of the King's recovery, was carried by 94 to 68 votes. The King recovered the following month, having been suffering from porphyria rather than insanity. =Fox's Libel Act= To the last, Camden zealously defended his early views on the functions of juries, especially of their right to decide on all questions of libel. In the Lords debate on the second reading of the Libel Act 1792 on 16 May, Camden contended that intention was an essential element of libel and should be decided by the jury as in murder cases. Broadening the legal argument to the constitutional and political Camden charged press freedom to the hands of the jury as the representatives of the people. The judges he held were too prone to government pressure to guarantee essential freedoms. Despite the unanimous opposition of the Law Lords, Camden's speech helped secure a majority of 57 to 32. Reputation and legacy Camden was short in stature but of a fine physique. For recreation he enjoyed music, theatre, romantic fiction, conversation and food. His vices were sloth and gluttony rather than womanising or gambling. The Earl Camden died in London on 18 April 1794. His remains were interred in Seal church in Kent. Camden died a wealthy man, much of his wealth deriving from his wife. Both Lord Campbell and Sir William Holdsworth held Camden a great Lord Chancellor. Charles Pratt's memorial stone By the 20th century, Camden's legal opinions were seen as subservient to Chatham's politics and Camden certainly followed the party line on Wilkes and America. However, his party loyalty was tempered by a self- serving interest in power. He served under five prime ministers and on two occasions clung to office after Chatham had resigned. In his last years he took a great interest in the career of Robert Stewart, 2nd Marquess of Londonderry, his daughter's stepson. Camden, whose own son was not to prove much of a statesman, recognised young Robert's potential and treated him very much as though he was his actual grandson. In 1788 he obtained an Act of Parliament granting permission to develop some fields he owned just to the north of London. In 1791 he laid out the land in plots and leased them for the construction of 1,400 houses, the beginnings of Camden Town. The town of Camden, Maine in the United States, was named for him in 1791. This is one of several cities, towns, and counties bearing his name, including Camden, South Carolina, Camden, North Carolina, and Camden, New Jersey, as well as Camden Counties in New Jersey (of which the eponymous city is the seat and largest city), Missouri and Georgia. In turn, Camden, South Carolina gave its name both to the Battle of Camden and Camden, Alabama. Camden, Tennessee was named for the battle, and Camden, Arkansas took its name from the town in Alabama. Furthermore, Pratt Street, a major thoroughfare in Baltimore, is also named partially after him. Cases *Chapman v Pickersgill (1762) 2 Wilson 145, 146, \\"I wish never to hear this objection again.

It is manufactured by Procter & Gamble. Old Spice was launched as Early American Old Spice by William Lightfoot Schultz's soap and toiletries company, Shulton Inc., in 1937. It was first targeted to women, with the men's product being released before Christmas at the end of 1937. Old Spice now sells male grooming products including antiperspirant/deodorant sticks and body wash. History 1944 advertisement for various Old Spice products Old Spice products were originally manufactured by the Shulton Company. The Shulton Company was founded in 1934 by William Lightfoot Schultz. Schultz was inspired by his mother's potpourri and as a result, the first Old Spice product in 1937 was a woman's scent called Early American Old Spice. The product was received well, and therefore followed with Old Spice for men in 1938. The men's products included shaving soap and aftershave lotion, marketed with a nautical theme. Sailing ships in particular were used for the brand's packaging. The original ships used on the packaging were the Grand Turk and the Friendship. Other ships used on Old Spice packaging include the John Wesley, Salem, Birmingham, Maria Teresa, Propontis, Recovery, Sooloo, Star of the West, Constitution, Java, United States, and Hamilton. In the 1970s, Old Spice shifted from being a shaving brand to a fragrance brand by introducing signature scents like Old Spice Burley. In June 1990, Procter & Gamble purchased the Old Spice fragrances, skin care and antiperspirant & deodorant brands from the Shulton Company. Throughout the 2000s, Procter & Gamble introduced many forms of deodorant, body washes, and body sprays in several scents under the Old Spice name. In early 2008, the original Old Spice scent was repackaged as \\"Classic Scent\\", both in the after shave and cologne versions. The white glass bottles gave way to plastic, and the gray stoppers to red. Old Spice Classic shower gel was sold using the slogan \\"The original. If your grandfather hadn't worn it, you wouldn't exist.‚Äù In January 2016, Procter & Gamble changed the scent of its Old Spice Classic After Shave. According to the product's website, under ratings & reviews, the change was made in order to \\"comply with new regulations\\". Products Old Spice's buoy-shaped bottle cologne is available in its original scent as well as newer Pure Sport. In 2006, Old Spice introduced a fragrance, OS Signature, which won the magazine FHM 's 2006 Grooming Award for Best Sporty Fragrance. Old Spice Red Zone products include a \\"Scratch-and-sniff\\" version of the Signature fragrance. Old Spice launched the Hardest Working Collection in 2016 with antiperspirants and body washes, offering the best protection and performance yet from the company. In 2014, Old Spice expanded its product line-up to men's hair care with the introduction of shampoos, two-in-one shampoo and conditioners and styling products.  Advertising  Old Spice Pure Sport High Endurance deodorant. In the 1970s and 80s, Old Spice ad campaigns in the United Kingdom and Ireland featured a man on a surfboard accompanied by the strains of composer Carl Orff's O Fortuna from Carmina Burana, with the tagline \\"Old Spice - The Mark Of A Man.\\" Old Spice was also featured as the sponsor of actor John C. Reilly‚Äôs character, Cal Naughton Jr. in the 2006 comedy Talladega Nights. An advertising campaign developed by Wieden + Kennedy in 2010 featuring Isaiah Mustafa became popular after the first advertisement, titled The Man Your Man Could Smell Like.[2] Following this campaign, Old Spice introduced Fabio Lanzoni to challenge Isaiah Mustafa for the Old Spice Guy title in an online advertising campaign. After the success of \\"The Man Your Man Could Smell Like\\", Old Spice released, \\"The Response Campaign\\". Over the course of two and a half days, the brand filmed one hundred and eighty-six videos featuring Isaiah Mustafa engaging in conversation with fans and celebrities. The campaign earned over 40 million views after the first week, was viewed more times than President Obama's 2008 acceptance speech, and led to Old Spice securing the spot of #1 all-time most viewed branded channel on YouTube. Old Spice has partnered with the NFL and featured football stars including: Ray Lewis, Greg Jennings and Wes Welker in various TV and digital campaigns. In 2012, former NFL player Terry Crews was featured in the brand's viral hit ‚ÄúMuscle Music‚Äù. The interactive video allowed people to make music through different musical instruments rigged to corresponding muscles on Terry's body. In 2013, Old Spice launched a series of TV commercials in India titled \\"Mantastic Man\\" starring supermodel and actor Milind Soman. The commercial ‚ÄúMomsong‚Äù became popular in 2014 as a part of the brand's Smellcome to Manhood campaign. The Make a Smellmitment commercials with Isaiah Mustafa and Terry Crews debuted in 2015, promoting Timber (or Swagger) and Bearglove. In early 2016, Old Spice introduced a new brand character, the Legendary Man, with two TV commercials ‚ÄúRocket Car‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhale‚Äù to launch the Hardest Working Collection. Old Spice also launched a series of digital infomercials with Canadian actor Steven Ogg. Early in 2016, the brand introduced two additional Old Spice characters, actors Thomas Beaudoin and Alberto Cardenas, in an advertising campaigns for the Red Zone product collection.

Plot The film centers on √âtienne, who lives in Rouen with his mother and grandmother and intends to take part in the national figure skating championship. For his 16th birthday, his grandmother gives him a digital camcorder as a present, which he starts to use immediately (supplying the introductory scenes of the film). √âtienne films anything and everything around him ‚Äì his family, his teacher Laurent, Ludovic, his best friend, himself figure skating, the sea, steep cliffs. As for Ludovic and his geography teacher, it soon becomes apparent that his obsession with them is grounded in more than just artistic pursuits. √âtienne's homosexuality becomes more and more clear both to him and the audience over the course of the film. Even though √âtienne is determined to make this year \\"the year of love\\", the year when everything turns around for him, things do not go as well as anticipated. He makes a blunder in his figure skating performance and only achieves second place. And when he starts, very carefully, to talk to Ludovic about the possibility of two men being in love, Ludovic runs away. In the final minutes of the film, the purpose of √âtienne's video diary gets clear: Feeling he has failed in what he set out to do and being deeply hurt by Ludovic's resentment, √âtienne decides to jump from the cliff and leave the camcorder (which he sets up to film his suicide) behind to explain to his family what he went through. Luckily, a stranger walks by at that moment and notices the boy close to the cliff and his camera nearby. The final scene shows the stranger and √âtienne in bed after sex, with √âtienne seeming truly happy for the first time.

Davis is best known for being acquitted of murder and attempted murder in two high-profile trials during the 1970s. At the time of his first trial, Davis was believed to be the wealthiest man to have stood trial for murder in the United States. First he was accused of murdering his stepdaughter on August 2, 1976, during a contentious divorce from his second wife, Priscilla Davis. He was found not guilty. The second trial, two years later, involved allegations that Davis attempted to hire a hitman to kill both Priscilla and the judge overseeing his divorce from Priscilla. Again, Davis was acquitted. Early life and first trial Thomas Cullen Davis was the middle of three sons born to legendary Fort Worth oilman Kenneth W. ‚ÄúStinky‚Äù Davis. His father founded KenDavis Industries International, Inc., which manufactured goods used in the petroleum industry.Gary Cartwight (1979) Blood Will Tell: The Murder Trials of T. Cullen Davis, Harcourt, Davis married Sandra Masters on August 29, 1962. They had two sons, Cullen, Jr. and Brian Davis.https://www.genealogymagazine.com/cullen-davis Davis and his brothers received equal shares of their father's estate upon his death in 1968, and all three were described as possessing keen business instincts.Stephenson, 1977 At the first trial, Davis's wealth was estimated at over $100 million ($ million today). Davis had a reputation in Fort Worth society circles for displays of bad temper and general \\"creepiness\\", according to female associates.\\"Millionaires death case acquittal leaves doubts\\", The Spokesman- Review, November 21, 1977. Davis' second marriage was to Priscilla Lee Childers. They were married on August 29, 1968, only hours after the death of his father. It was her third marriage. Priscilla had one daughter from her first marriage, and two children from her second marriage, including Andrea Wilborn.Gary Cartwright. \\"Rich Man Dead Man\\", Texas Monthly March 1977. In 1972, Davis spent $6 million ($ million today) to build Stonegate Mansion, a five-bedroom, 11-bath mansion with an indoor pool and a master bedroom. In its prime, the luxurious, contemporary home of courtyards, tunnels and balconies at 4100 Mockingbird Lane was decorated with more than 100 oil paintings. The mansion was designed by Albert S. Komatsu and Associates. Davis and Childers separated in 1974 and both began dating other people openly. A judge granted Priscilla the right to live in the Stonegate property during the divorce proceedings and further authorized substantial spousal and child support payments from Davis to Childers. Her live-in boyfriend was Stan Farr, a former basketball star at nearby Texas Christian University. On August 2, 1976, an intruder entered Stonegate Mansion and killed 12-year-old Andrea, who was home alone after returning from a Bible study. The body of Andrea would later be found in the basement, apparently shot execution-style. When Childers and her then-boyfriend Stan Farr returned home, both were shot. Farr died at the scene. Childers staggered from the house being pursued by the killer as two family friends, Beverly Bass and Gus Gavrel, Jr., drove up to the mansion. The killer shot Gavrel, paralyzing him for life. Childers identified Davis to police, saying he had shot her and Farr, wearing no disguise except a wig. Gavrel said he was shot after his companion recognized the gunman as Davis and called him by name. Police arrested Davis that same night, at the home he shared with Karen Master, his then-girlfriend who would become his third wife. Davis was only tried for the murder of Andrea. He was defended by famous Texas defense attorney Richard \\"Racehorse\\" Haynes. The prosecution case relied almost entirely on eyewitness testimony. Earlier the day of the shooting, a judge had ordered Davis's monthly support to Priscilla increased from $3500 to $5000 ($ to $ today) and to pay her legal fees of $25,000 ($ today) and household expenses of $24,000 ($ today).Tom Stephenson (1977). Is Priscilla Davis' Story True?, dmagazine.com, March 1977. This change was proposed as a motive for the crimes. Davis did not testify in his own defense. Haynes's defense concentrated on two main points. First, the complete lack of physical evidence linking Davis to the crime (no fingerprints, no firearm linked to the murder, etc.).Gary Cartwright. How Cullen Davis Beat the Rap, TexasMonthly.com, May 1979. Second, Haynes focused on the eyewitness testimony, particularly Priscilla. Haynes depicted her as living in two worlds: Fort Worth high society, and a milieu of drug dealers, criminals and sleazy sex. Haynes proposed that Priscilla's admitted heavy use of prescription painkillers made her an unreliable witness who might have been confused about the identity of her attacker. Journalist Gary Cartwright wrote: \\"most observers agreed later that the case was won as soon as Haynes completed his cross-examination of Priscilla\\"; this occurred only two weeks into a three-month trial. Davis was found not guilty. Of the trial, prosecutor Tim Curry said, \\"We were out-bought and out-thought\\". Davis married Karen Master on June 5, 1979 in Fort Worth. He adopted her two sons Trey Davis and Chelsey Davis. Other trials In related civil litigation concerning Wilborn's death following the murder trial, Davis prevailed and was held not liable for her death. The children of Stan Farr later sued Davis for wrongful death and received a $250,000 out of court settlement. In 1978, Davis was arrested again, this time for allegedly hiring a hitman to murder both Priscilla Davis and the judge overseeing their ongoing divorce litigation.Shuy, Roger W (2001). \\"Discourse Analysis in the Legal Context\\", The Handbook of Discourse Analysis (eds. Deborah Schiffrin, Deborah Tannen, and Heidi E. Hamilton). Oxford: Blackwell Publishing, pp. 438-39. The case largely hinged on a tape- recorded conversation between Davis and David McCrory, an undercover employee posing as a hitman for hire which was recorded in the parking lot of the Coco‚Äôs Famous Hamburgers restaurant (now a Denny's) where Davis was arrested. In the recording, Davis was alleged to have asked the undercover employee to murder his wife and the judge. The trial of Texas v. Cullen T. Davis was one of the first uses of forensic discourse analysis on tape-recorded evidence in a legal setting in the United States. A discourse analyst testified that Davis' words in the tape did not constitute solicitation of murder. Haynes again defended Davis. He again attacked the prosecution's physical evidence: Davis's fingerprints were not found on critical pieces of evidence, such as the cash he allegedly paid to the McCrory. Unlike the first trial, Davis testified in his own defense. He stated that he had not solicited McCrory's offer to kill Priscilla and the judge, and claimed it was a plot orchestrated by her to frame him. Davis claimed he merely played along with the plot in an attempt to eventually convince McCrory to admit that Priscilla was to blame for the entire scheme. Unlike the first trial where observers were convinced that Davis would likely be acquitted, opinion was split in the second trial with the general consensus being that Davis's best hope was a hung jury. After a lengthy trial Davis was acquitted a second time. Due to the prominence of the case, in 2015 Tarrant County authorities chose to keep the paper court documents of the case as historical documents even though they have been digitized. Later life According to truTV, Davis lost most of his oil fortune in the recession of the 1980s, and eventually declared bankruptcy. Cullen and Karen Davis sold their home and property to a real estate developer in 1984. Davis continues to live in the Fort Worth area, while his wife Karen died of organ failure on September 22, 2016. Davis in later life became a born-again Christian, and at one point worked with controversial televangelist James Robison.https://www.upi.com/Archives/1983/01/11/Evangelist-James- Robison-and-millionaire-T-Cullen-Davis-last/1963411109200/ Priscilla Lee Childers died of breast cancer on February 19, 2001, still adamantly insisting on Davis' guilt.

He was Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain from 1771 to 1778. Background and education Bathurst was the eldest son of Allen Bathurst, 1st Earl Bathurst, and his wife Catherine (n√©e Apsley). Educated at Balliol College, Oxford, he was called to the bar, Lincoln's Inn, in 1736. He practised on the Oxford circuit and became a King's Counsel in 1745 after several years sitting in King's Bench. Political and judicial career In April 1735 he had been elected member of parliament for Cirencester, and was rewarded for his opposition to the government by being made solicitor-general in 1745 and, then attorney-general to Frederick, Prince of Wales in 1748. Frederick died in 1751, but Bathurst was asked to carry on in the same office for Prince George. Resigning his seat in parliament in April 1754 he was made a judge and bencher of the Court of Common Pleas in the following month. Bathurst remained opposed to the Whigs, despite the ill-fated attempt by the Tories to capitalise from Walpole's fall. He was admitted to the Privy Council when the death of the Lord Chancellor's death left the post vacant with no candidate. Appointed one of the three commissioners of the Great Seal of England he was favourite for the post and, later allowed as Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain in January 1771; he was on the occasion raised to the peerage as Baron Apsley, in the County of Sussex. He was roundly abused in rhyme and doggerel by satirical writings of Whigs Lord Brougham and Lord Lyndhurst. The best they could say about him was that he was \\"not disagreeable\\", but ridiculed his ability at the bar, and mocked a Tory as incompetent. In January 1774 he was instrumental in writing the Intolerable Acts which he supported in parliament and the courts, most notably the Boston Port Act which gave rise to the Boston Tea Party and revolution. The judge was not a war-monger nor had he any experience of soldiering; but perception was political. In 1777 after the American Frigates had defeated once or twice, Bathurst worried that Great Britain might lose her control of the coast line urged peace preliminaries in order to save the colonies in the West Indies. He was a personal friend of Admiral William Howe, who was known to him since boyhood. Having succeeded his father as second Earl Bathurst in September 1775, he resigned his office somewhat unwillingly in July 1778 to enable Lord Thurlow to join the cabinet of Lord North. In November 1779 he was appointed Lord President of the Council, and left office with North in March 1782. In 1771 the construction of Apsley House was started. A neo-classical facade made of brick with five bays. It had large light and airy sash windows and in the centre of the house a large sweeping circular staircase of exquisite design. The house was remodelled by the Duke of Wellington when he was prime minister between 1828 and 1830, when it was encased in Bath stone. But Lord Bathurst sold the house to the south of Hyde Park, also known as no.1 London removing his estates to the country as befitted a fox hunting Tory. Lord Bathurst used the proceeds to invest into more acreage at Cirencester Park which was planted with trees for landscaping and hunting. King George III held faith with Bathurst as the Speaker for the House of Lords. A former treasury commissioner he had the sinecure of a tellership of the Exchequer. It entailed some duties but the job was worth ¬£1,200 per annum. More importantly for the succession to the estates he was able to secure a tellership for his son by 1790. He continued to plant a new garden into his retirement. Then in 1788 a sick King George decided he would take the waters at Cheltenham with Queen Charlotte. En route the royal family stopped during July at Cirencester Park. Lord Bathurst developed the Sapperton tunnel the following year for a new canal dug to connect the Severn with the Thames. During the reign hundreds of local acts of Parliament authorised construction of roads, bridges, tunnels, and infrastructures. Lord Bathurst letters show he was kindly man with a reserved temperament. He was good patrician master taking care of his workers, he paid more than most employers, and ensured they saw a doctor if necessary. But Bathurst's moral philosophy earned enemies among the whigs, particularly from Horatio Walpole, the journalist of Strawberry Hill, who bore a grudge for the attacks on the Walpole ministry. Family Lord Bathurst married firstly Anne James in 1754, but she died in 1758 without issue. He married secondly Tryphena, daughter of Thomas Scawen, in 1759. He died at Oakley Grove near Cirencester on 6 August 1794, aged 80, and was succeeded in the earldom by his son from his second marriage, Henry. Lady Bathurst died in 1807. Apsley House, in Hyde Park, known as \\"Number One London\\", was built for him by Robert Adam. It was sold in 1807 to the first Marquess of Wellesley, who sold it in 1817 to his famous brother, Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington.

He is particularly known for his description of Bright's disease. Biography He was born in Bristol, Gloucestershire, the third son of Sarah and Richard Bright Sr., a wealthy merchant and banker. Bright Sr. shared his interest in science with his son, encouraging him to consider it as a career. In 1808, Bright Jr. joined the University of Edinburgh to study philosophy, economics and mathematics, but switched to medicine the following year. In 1810, he accompanied Sir George Mackenzie on a summer expedition to Iceland where he conducted naturalist studies. Bright then continued his medical studies at Guy's Hospital in London and in September 1813 returned to Edinburgh to be granted his medical doctorate. His thesis was De erysipelate contagioso (On contagious erysipelas). During the 1820s and 1830s Bright again worked at Guy's Hospital, teaching, practising and researching medicine. There he worked alongside two other celebrated medical pioneers, Thomas Addison and Thomas Hodgkin. His research into the causes and symptoms of kidney disease led to his identifying what became known as Bright's disease. For this, he is considered the \\"father of nephrology\\". He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1821. Bright had a special affection for Hungary and in 1815 he lived in Festetics Castle in Keszthely, where there is a large plaque: ‚ÄúTo the memory of the English physician scientist and traveller who was one of the pioneers in the accurate description of Lake Balaton.‚Äù He delivered the Lumleian Lectures in 1837 on \\"Disorders of the Brain\\" and the Gulstonian lectures in 1833 on the \\"Function of the Abdominal Viscera\\" at the Royal College of Physicians. =Death= On 11 December 1858, Bright became severely ill due to complications of heart disease and was unable to recover.

Frequently listed as one of the fireside poets, he was influenced by the Scottish poet Robert Burns. Whittier is remembered particularly for his anti-slavery writings, as well as his book Snow-Bound. Biography =Early life and work= John Greenleaf Whittier was born to John and Abigail (Hussey) at their rural homestead in Haverhill, Massachusetts, on December 17, 1807.Wagenknecht, 3 His middle name is thought to mean feuillevert, after his Huguenot forebears.Pickard T. Samuel, Life and Letters of John Greenleaf Whittier, Haskell House Publishers, New York (1907), SBN 8383-0191-6 He grew up on the farm in a household with his parents, a brother and two sisters, a maternal aunt and paternal uncle, and a constant flow of visitors and hired hands for the farm. As a boy, it was discovered that Whittier was color-blind when he was unable to see a difference between ripe and unripe strawberries.Wagenknecht, 18 Their farm was not very profitable, and there was only enough money to get by. Whittier himself was not cut out for hard farm labor and suffered from bad health and physical frailty his whole life. Although he received little formal education, he was an avid reader who studied his father's six books on Quakerism until their teachings became the foundation of his ideology. Whittier was heavily influenced by the doctrines of his religion, particularly its stress on humanitarianism, compassion, and social responsibility. Whittier was first introduced to poetry by a teacher. His sister sent his first poem, \\"The Exile's Departure\\", to the Newburyport Free Press without his permission, and its editor, William Lloyd Garrison, published it on June 8, 1826.Wagenknecht, 5 Garrison as well as another local editor encouraged Whittier to attend the recently opened Haverhill Academy. To raise money to attend the school, Whittier became a shoemaker for a time, and a deal was made to pay part of his tuition with food from the family farm.Woodwell, 12 Before his second term, he earned money to cover tuition by serving as a teacher in a one-room schoolhouse in what is now Merrimac, Massachusetts.Woodwell, 17 He attended Haverhill Academy from 1827 to 1828 and completed a high school education in only two terms. Whittier received the first substantial public praise for his work from critic John Neal via Neal's magazine The Yankee in 1828. Whittier valued the opinion of the older and more established writer, pledging that if Neal did not like his writing, \\"I will quit poetry, and everything also of a literary nature, for I am sick at heart of the business.\\" In an 1829 letter, Neal told Whittier to \\"Persevere, and I am sure you will have your reward in every way.\\" Reading Neal's 1828 novel Rachel Dyer inspired Whittier to weave New England witchcraft lore into his own stories and poems. Garrison gave Whittier the job of editor of the National Philanthropist, a Boston-based temperance weekly. Shortly after a change in management, Garrison reassigned him as editor of the weekly American Manufacturer in Boston.Woodwell, 25 Whittier became an outspoken critic of President Andrew Jackson, and by 1830 was editor of the prominent New England Weekly Review in Hartford, Connecticut, the most influential Whig journal in New England. He published The Song of the Vermonters, 1779 anonymously in The New England Magazine in 1838. The poem was mistakenly attributed to Ethan Allen for nearly sixty years. Whittier acknowledged his authorship in 1858. =Abolitionist activity= Broadside publication of Whittier's Our Countrymen in Chains During the 1830s, Whittier became interested in politics, but after losing a congressional election at age 25, he suffered a nervous breakdown and returned home. The year 1833 was a turning point for Whittier; he resurrected his correspondence with Garrison, and the passionate abolitionist began to encourage the young Quaker to join his cause. In 1833, Whittier published the antislavery pamphlet Justice and Expediency,Wagenknecht, 13 and from there dedicated the next twenty years of his life to the abolitionist cause. The controversial pamphlet destroyed all of his political hopes, as his demand for immediate emancipation alienated both Northern businessmen and Southern slaveholders, but it also sealed his commitment to a cause that he deemed morally correct and socially necessary. He was a founding member of the American Anti-Slavery Society and signed the Anti-Slavery Declaration of 1833, which he often considered the most significant action of his life. Whittier's political skill made him useful as a lobbyist, and his willingness to badger anti-slavery congressional leaders into joining the abolitionist cause was invaluable. From 1835 to 1838, he traveled widely in the North, attending conventions, securing votes, speaking to the public, and lobbying politicians. As he did so, Whittier received his fair share of violent responses, being several times mobbed, stoned, and run out of town. From 1838 to 1840, he was editor of the Pennsylvania Freeman in Philadelphia,Wagenknecht, 6 one of the leading antislavery papers in the North, formerly known as the National Enquirer. In May 1838, the publication moved its offices to the newly-opened Pennsylvania Hall on North Sixth Street, which was shortly after burned by a pro-slavery mob. Whittier also continued to write poetry, and nearly all of his poems then dealt with the problem of slavery. In 1838, Charles G. Atherton of New Hampshire presented five resolutions that were adopted and created a new resolution that barred Congress from discussing petitions that mentioned bringing slavery to an end. Congress approved them on December 12, 1838, which became known as the \\"Atherton Gag\\"; Whittier referred to Atherton in one of his many abolition poems as \\"vile\\" by having allied himself so closely with his fellow Democrats from pro-slavery South. It was not until 1844 the House rescinded that gag rule on a motion made by John Quincy Adams. By the end of the 1830s, the unity of the abolitionist movement had begun to fracture. Whittier stuck to his belief that moral action apart from political effort was futile. He knew that success required legislative change, not merely moral suasion. That opinion alone engendered a bitter split from Garrison, and Whittier went on to become a founding member of the Liberty Party in 1839. In 1840, he attended the World Anti-Slavery Convention in London.List of delegates, Anti-Slavery Convention 1840, Retrieved 3 August 2015 By 1843, he was announcing the triumph of the fledgling party: \\"Liberty party is no longer an experiment. It is vigorous reality, exerting... a powerful influence.\\"Laurie, 59 Whittier also unsuccessfully encouraged Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow to join the party.Laurie, 60 He took editing jobs with the Middlesex Standard in Lowell, Massachusetts, and the Essex Transcript in Amesbury until 1844. While in Lowell, he met Lucy Larcom, who became a lifelong friend.Ehrlich, Eugene and Gorton Carruth. The Oxford Illustrated Literary Guide to the United States. New York: Oxford University Press, 1982: 51. In 1845, he began writing his essay \\"The Black Man\\" which included an anecdote about John Fountain, a free black who was jailed in Virginia for helping slaves to escape. After his release, Fountain went on a speaking tour and thanked Whittier for writing his story.Laurie, 77 Around then, the stresses of editorial duties, worsening health, and dangerous mob violence caused Whittier to have a physical breakdown. He went home to Amesbury and remained there for the rest of his life, ending his active participation in abolition. Even so, he continued to believe that the best way to gain abolitionist support was to broaden the Liberty Party's political appeal, and Whittier persisted in advocating the addition of other issues to its platform. He eventually participated in the evolution of the Liberty Party into the Free Soil Party, and some say his greatest political feat was convincing Charles Sumner to run on the Free-Soil ticket for the U.S. Senate in 1850. Beginning in 1847, Whittier was the editor of Gamaliel Bailey's The National Era, one of the most influential abolitionist newspapers in the North. For the next ten years, it featured the best of his writing, both as prose and poetry. Being confined to his home and away from the action offered Whittier a chance to write better abolitionist poetry, and he was even poet laureate for his party. Whittier's poems often used slavery to represent all kinds of oppression (physical, spiritual, economic), and his poems stirred up popular response because they appealed to feelings, rather than logic. Whittier produced two collections of antislavery poetry: Poems Written during the Progress of the Abolition Question in the United States, between 1830 and 1838 and Voices of Freedom (1846). He was an elector in the presidential election of 1860 and of 1864 for Abraham Lincoln both times.Wagenknecht, 8 The passage of the Thirteenth Amendment in 1865 ended both slavery and his public cause, and so Whittier turned to other forms of poetry for the remainder of his life. =Later life= Grave of John Greenleaf Whittier in Amesbury, MA Whittier was one of the founding contributors of the magazine The Atlantic Monthly. One of his most enduring works, Snow-Bound, was first published in 1866. Whittier was surprised by its financial success; he earned $10,000 from the first edition.Wagenknecht, 7 In 1867, Whittier asked James Thomas Fields to get him a ticket to a reading by Charles Dickens during the British author's visit to the United States. After the event, Whittier wrote a letter describing his experience: Whittier spent the last winters of his life, from 1876 to 1892, at Oak Knoll, the home of his cousins in Danvers, Massachusetts.Ehrlich, Eugene, and Gorton Carruth. The Oxford Illustrated Literary Guide to the United States. New York: Oxford University Press, 1982: 46. Whittier spent the summer of 1892 at the home of a cousin in Hampton Falls, New Hampshire, where he wrote his last poem (a tribute to Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr.) and where he was captured in a final photograph.Ehrlich, Eugene, and Gorton Carruth. The Oxford Illustrated Literary Guide to the United States. New York: Oxford University Press, 1982: 14. He died at this home on September 7, 1892,Wagenknecht, 9 and was buried in Amesbury, Massachusetts. Pouliot, Charles J. Amesbury. Charleston, SC: Arcadia Publishing, 2002: 68 Poetry John Greenleaf Whittier in 1887 John Greenleaf Whittier's poem, Burial of Barber was inspired by the burial of abolitionist T. W. Barber (Barber's tomb pictured in 2018). Whittier's first two published books were Legends of New England (1831) and the poem Moll Pitcher (1832). In 1833 he published The Song of the Vermonters, 1779, which he had anonymously inserted in The New England Magazine. The poem was erroneously attributed to Ethan Allen for nearly sixty years. This use of poetry in the service of his political beliefs is illustrated by his book Poems Written during the Progress of the Abolition Question. Highly regarded in his lifetime and for a period thereafter, he is now largely remembered for his anti-slavery writings and his poems Barbara Frietchie, \\"The Barefoot Boy\\", \\"Maud Muller\\" and Snow-Bound. A number of his poems have been turned into hymns, including Dear Lord and Father of Mankind, taken from his poem \\"The Brewing of Soma\\". The latter part of the poem was set in 1924 by Dr. George Gilbert Stocks to the tune of Repton by English composer Hubert Parry from the 1888 oratorio Judith. It is also sung as the hymn Rest by Frederick Maker, and Charles Ives also set a part of it to music in his song \\"Serenity\\". On its own, the hymn appears sentimental, though in the context of the entire poem, the stanzas make greater sense, being intended as a contrast with the fevered spirit of pre-Christian worship and that of some modern Christians. Whittier's Quakerism is better illustrated, however, by the hymn that begins: His sometimes contrasting sense of the need for strong action against injustice can be seen in his poem \\"To R√∂nge\\" in honor of Johannes Ronge, the German religious figure and rebel leader of the 1848 rebellion in Germany: Whittier's poem \\"At Port Royal 1861\\" describes the experience of Northern abolitionists arriving at Port Royal, South Carolina, as teachers and missionaries for the slaves who had been left behind when their owners fled because the Union Navy would arrive to blockade the coast. The poem includes the \\"Song of the Negro Boatmen,\\" written in dialect: Of all the poetry inspired by the Civil War, the \\"Song of the Negro Boatmen\\" was one of the most widely printed, and though Whittier never actually visited Port Royal, an abolitionist working there described his \\"Song of the Negro Boatmen\\" as \\"wonderfully applicable as we were being rowed across Hilton Head Harbor among United States gunboats.\\" Criticism The John Greenleaf Whittier Home in Amesbury, Massachusetts Nathaniel Hawthorne dismissed Whittier's Literary Recreations and Miscellanies (1854): \\"Whittier's book is poor stuff! I like the man, but have no high opinion either of his poetry or his prose.\\"Woodwell, 252 Editor George Ripley, however, found Whittier's poetry refreshing and said it had a \\"stately movement of versification, grandeur of imagery, a vein of tender and solemn pathos, cheerful trust\\" and a \\"pure and ennobling character\\".Crowe, Charles. George Ripley: Transcendentalist and Utopian Socialist. Athens, GA: University of Georgia Press, 1967: 247. Boston critic Edwin Percy Whipple noted Whittier's moral and ethical tone mingled with sincere emotion. He wrote, \\"In reading this last volume, I feel as if my soul had taken a bath in holy water.\\"Woodwell, 443‚Äì444 Later scholars and critics questioned the depth of Whittier's poetry. One was Karl Keller, who noted, \\"Whittier has been a writer to love, not to belabor.\\"Gioia, Dana. \\"Longfellow in the Aftermath of Modernism\\". The Columbia History of American Poetry, edited by Jay Parini. Columbia University Press, 1993: 80. Influence and legacy issued in 1940 Whittier was particularly supportive of women writers, including Alice Cary, Phoebe Cary, Sarah Orne Jewett, Lucy Larcom, and Celia Thaxter. He was especially influential on prose writings by Jewett, with whom he shared a belief in the moral quality of literature and an interest in New England folklore. Jewett dedicated one of her books to him and modeled several of her characters after people in Whittier's life.Blanchard, Paula. Sarah Orne Jewett: Her World and Her Work. Cambridge, MA: Perseus Publishing, 1995: 183‚Äì185. Thomas Hill Whittier's family farm, known as the John Greenleaf Whittier Homestead or simply \\"Whittier's Birthplace\\", is now a historic site open to the public.Ehrlich, Eugene, and Gorton Carruth. The Oxford Illustrated Literary Guide to the United States. New York: Oxford University Press, 1982: 50. His later residence in Amesbury, where he lived for 56 years, is also open to the public, and is now known as the John Greenleaf Whittier Home. Whittier's hometown of Haverhill has named many buildings and landmarks in his honor including J.G. Whittier Middle School, Greenleaf Elementary, and Whittier Regional Vocational Technical High School. Numerous other schools around the country also bear his name. The John Greenleaf Whittier Bridge, built in the style of the Sagamore and Bourne bridges, carries Interstate 95 from Amesbury to Newburyport over the Merrimack River. A covered bridge spanning the Bearcamp River in Ossipee, New Hampshire, is also named for Whittier. The city of Whittier, California, is named after the poet, as are the communities of Whittier, Alaska, and Whittier, Iowa; the Minneapolis neighborhood of Whittier; the Denver neighborhood of Whittier; and the town of Greenleaf, Idaho. Both Whittier College and Whittier Law School are named after him. A park in the Saint Boniface area of Winnipeg is named after the poet in recognition of his poem \\"The Red River Voyageur\\". Whittier Education Campus in Washington, DC, is named in his honor. SS Whittier Victory a World War 2 ship named after Whittier College. Whittier Peak and Mount Whittier in Washington and Mount Whittier in New Hampshire are mountains named after him. The alternate history story P.'s Correspondence (1846) by Nathaniel Hawthorne, considered the first such story ever published in English, includes the notice \\"Whittier, a fiery Quaker youth, to whom the muse had perversely assigned a battle-trumpet, got himself lynched, in South Carolina\\". The date of that event in Hawthorne's invented timeline was 1835. Whittier was one of thirteen writers in the 1897 card game Authors, which referenced his writings \\"Laus Deo\\", \\"Among the Hills\\", Snow-bound, and \\"The Eternal Goodness\\". He was removed from the card game when it was reissued in 1987.Petersen, Clarence. \\"Poe To Whittier: Nevermore\\", The Chicago Tribune. June 22, 1987. Whitter's poem \\"Twilight\\" was set to music in 1932 by Edwin Fowles.

The Athenians under Xenophon marched into Thrace to attack Spartolos. They destroyed the crops outside the city and began negotiating with pro-Athenian factions in Chalcidice, but the anti-Athenian factions asked for help from Olynthus. An army from Chalcidice, Spartolos, and Olynthus met the Athenians in battle, but their hoplites were defeated and they retreated to Spartolos; their cavalry and peltasts (light infantry armed with javelins), however, gained the advantage over the Athenian troops. Reinforcements soon arrived from Olynthus, and they launched a second attack on the Athenians. The Athenian hoplites could not come to grips with the enemy light troops or horsemen. Eventually the Athenians panicked and were routed, with all of their generals and 430 other men killed. In the Athenian tribute list of 429/8 BC the only cities of Chalcidice are: Mende, Aphytis, Scione, Stageira and Acanthus (Athos).IG I¬≥ 282 Acanthus and Mende had not even joined the Chalcidian League. Early Stage of Battle When the phalanxes of the Chalcidians clashed with those of the Athenians, it was clear that the Athenians had a great advantage. The local Chalcidian hoplites made up the centre and right hand portions of the army while hired Peloponnesian forces made up the left side. The locals on the Chalcidian side gave way first, forcing the mercenaries to fall back as well. This left the Chalcidian army worn and strained, and the battle looked very promising for the Athenians. Later Stage of Battle After the Chalcidian side was worn down by the Athenians, the Chalcidians were reinforced by troops sent from Olynthus. With the help of the troops from Olynthus, the Chalcidians rallied back against the Athenians much stronger than before. They had learned that the Athenians did not have the experience or equipment to defend against large numbers of javelins, so when they came back strengthened by their allies and with a new tactic, the Chalcidians forced the Athenians to retreat. As the Athenians retreated, Chalcidian cavalry and light infantry chased down the Athenians to inflict further damage upon them. The Athenians tried multiple counter-attacks to defend themselves from further harm, but each time the Chalcidians were able to evade the attacks. The back ranks of Athenian troops began to abandon those at the front, allowing them to be overwhelmed, surrounded, and killed, including their general, Xenophon. Statistics On the Athenian side of the battle were 2,000 hoplites, 200 cavalry, and around 500 light troops. Aftermath Between a fifth and a fourth of the Athenian troops were killed in this battle- twice as much as was expected prior to the battle. This brutal defeat showed Athens what would be required of them to win the war.

William Wood caricatured by \\"Ape\\" in Vanity Fair, 1869 William Page Wood, 1st Baron Hatherley, PC (29 November 1801 ‚Äì 10 July 1881) was a British lawyer and statesman who served as a Liberal Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain between 1868 and 1872 in William Ewart Gladstone's first ministry. Background and education Wood was born in London, the second son of Sir Matthew Wood, 1st Baronet,thepeerage.com William Page Wood, 1st and last Baron Hatherley an alderman and Lord Mayor of London who became famous for befriending Queen Caroline and braving George IV. Sir Evelyn Wood and Katharine O'Shea were his nephew and niece respectively. He was educated at Winchester College, from which he was expelled after a revolt against the headmaster, Woodbridge School, Geneva University, and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he became a fellow after being 24th wrangler in 1824. Legal and political career Wood entered Lincoln's Inn, and was called to the Bar in 1824, studying conveyancing in John Tyrrell's chambers. He soon obtained a good practice as an equity draughtsman and before parliamentary committees. In 1845 he became a Queen's Counsel, and in 1847 was elected to parliament for the city of Oxford as a Liberal. In 1849 he was appointed Vice-Chancellor of the County Palatine of Lancaster, and in 1851 was made Solicitor General for England and Wales and knighted, vacating the former position in 1852. When his party returned to power in 1853, he was raised to the bench as a Vice- Chancellor. In 1868 he was made a Lord Justice of Appeal, but before the end of the year was selected by Gladstone to be Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain and was raised to the peerage as Baron Hatherley, of Down Hatherley in the County of Gloucester. He retired in 1872 owing to failing eyesight, but sat occasionally as a law lord. Family Wood married Charlotte, daughter of Edward Moor, in 1830. They had no children. Charlotte's death in 1878 was a great blow to Wood, from which he never recovered, and he died in London on 10 July 1881, aged 79. Both are buried in the churchyard in Great Bealings, where Charlotte's brother was rector. The title became extinct on his death.

Biography Godchaux was born in Seattle, Washington, and grew up in Concord, California, a regional suburban center within the East Bay of the San Francisco Bay Area. He began piano lessons at age five at the instigation of his father (a semi-professional musician) and subsequently played Dixieland and cocktail jazz in professional ensembles as a teenager. According to Godchaux, \\"I spent two years wearing dinner jackets and playing acoustic piano in country club bands and Dixieland groups...I also did piano bar gigs and put trios together to back singers in various places around the Bay Area...[playing] cocktail standards like 'Misty' the way jazz musicians resentfully play a song that's popular ‚Äì that frustrated space... I just wasn't into it... I was looking for something real to get involved with ‚Äì which wouldn't necessarily be music\\". He met and married former FAME Studios session vocalist Donna Jean Thatcher in November 1970; their son Zion, of the band BoomBox, was born in 1974. The couple introduced themselves to Jerry Garcia at a concert in August 1971; coincidentally, ailing keyboardist/vocalist Ron \\"Pigpen\\" McKernan (who would go on to play alongside Godchaux from December 1971 to June 1972) was unable to handle the rigors of the band's next tour. At the time, Godchaux was largely supported by his wife and irregularly employed as a lounge pianist in Walnut Creek, California. While he was largely uninterested in the popular music of the era and eschewed au courant jazz rock in favor of modal jazz, bebop, and swing, several sources claim that he collaborated with such rock acts as Dave Mason and James and the Good Brothers, a Canadian trio acquainted with the Grateful Dead. According to Godchaux, \\"I first saw [the Grateful Dead] play with a bunch of my old lady's friends who were real Grateful Dead freaks. I went to a concert with them and saw something I didn't know could be really happening... It was not like a mind-blowing far out, just a beautiful far out. Not exactly a choir of angels but some incredibly holy, pure and beautiful spiritual light. From then on, I was super turned-on that such a thing existed. This was about a year and a half ago, when I first met Donna... I knew I was related to them.\\" He was also known to Betty Cantor-Jackson, a Grateful Dead sound engineer who produced James and the Good Brothers' debut album in 1970. Remembering their initial meet, Bill Kreutzmann writes, \\"Then, around the same time that Pigpen entered the hospital, Jerry gave me a call telling me to get my ass down to the rehearsal space. He said there was a guy down there with him that I simply had to hear. Nobody else from the band was around, but almost immediately after I arrived, I knew that Jerry was right‚Äîthis guy could really play piano.\\" Although the band had employed several other keyboardists (including Howard Wales, Merl Saunders and Ned Lagin) as session musicians to augment McKernan's limited instrumental contributions following the departure of Tom Constanten in January 1970, Godchaux was invited to join the group as a permanent member in September 1971. He first performed publicly with the Dead on October 19, 1971 at the University of Minnesota's Northrup Auditorium. After playing an upright piano and increasingly sporadic Hammond organ on the fall 1971 tour, Godchaux primarily played acoustic grand piano (including nine-foot Yamaha and Steinway instruments) at concerts from 1972 to 1974. Throughout this period, Godchaux's rented pianos were outfitted with a state-of-the-art pickup system designed by Carl Countryman. According to sound engineer Owsley Stanley, \\"The Countryman pickup worked by an electrostatic principle similar to the way a condenser mic works. It was charged with a very high voltage, and thus was very cantankerous to set up and use. It had a way of crackling in humid conditions and making other rather unmusical sounds if not set up just right, but when it worked it was truly brilliant.\\" The control box also enabled Godchaux to use a wah-wah pedal with the instrument. He added a Fender Rhodes electric piano in mid-1973 and briefly experimented with the Hammond organ again on the band's fall 1973 tour; the Rhodes piano would remain in his setup through 1976. Following the group's extended touring hiatus, he continued to use contractually-stipulated nine-foot Steinways furnished by the band's venues in 1976 and early 1977 before switching exclusively to the Yamaha CP-70 electric grand piano in September 1977. The instrument's unwieldy tuning partially contributed to the shelving of the band's recordings of their 1978 engagement at the Giza Plateau for a planned live album. Initially, Godchaux incorporated a richly melodic, fluid and boogie-woogie-influenced style that intuitively complemented the band's improvisational approach to rock music; critic Robert Christgau characterized his playing as \\"a cross between Chick Corea and Little Richard.\\" According to Garcia in a 1980 interview with Mark Rowland conducted shortly before Godchaux's death, \\"Keith is one of those guys who is sort of an idiot savant of the piano. He‚Äôs an excellent pianist but he didn‚Äôt really have a concept of music, of how the piano fit in with the rest of the band. We were constantly playing records for him and so forth but that wasn‚Äôt his gift. His gift was the keyboard, the piano itself.\\" Bassist Phil Lesh lauded his ability to \\"fit perfectly in the spaces between [our] parts,\\" while drummer Bill Kreutzmann was inspired by his \\"heart of music.\\" Increasingly frayed from the vicissitudes of the rock and roll lifestyle, Godchaux gradually became dependent upon various drugs, most notably alcohol and heroin. Throughout the late 1970s, he was frequently embroiled in violent domestic conflicts with Donna, who also developed an alcohol use disorder. Following the Grateful Dead's 1975 hiatus, he largely yielded to a simpler comping-based approach with the group that eschewed his previously contrapuntal style in favor of emulating or ballasting Garcia's guitar parts. Despite occasional flirtations with synthesizers (most notably a Polymoog during the group's spring 1977 tour), this tendency was foregrounded by the reintegration of second drummer Mickey Hart, resulting in a heavily percussive sound with little sustain beyond Garcia's leads. However, Godchaux's playing in the Jerry Garcia Band ‚Äì which had fewer instrumentalists and hence a more \\"open\\" sound ‚Äì retained more elements of his earlier work with the Grateful Dead during this period. In early 1978, rhythm guitarist Bob Weir began to perform slide guitar parts with an eye toward variegating the group's sonic palette, with Weir concluding that \\"desperation is the mother of invention.\\" Garcia biographer Blair Jackson has also asserted that \\"the quality of Keith‚Äôs playing in the Dead fell off in ‚Äô78 and early ‚Äô79. It no longer had that sparkle and imagination that marked his best work (‚Äô72‚Äì‚Äô74). Much of what he played in his last year was basic, blocky, chordal stuff. I don‚Äôt hear many wrong notes but he‚Äôs not exactly out there on the edge taking chances and pushing the others, as he frequently did, in his own quiet way, in his peak Grateful Dead years. I guess the worst thing you could say about later-period Keith is that he was just taking up sonic space in the Dead‚Äôs overall sound. Did this affect the others? No doubt, though it can‚Äôt be measured.\\" Eventually, according to Donna Jean Godchaux, \\"Keith and I decided we wanted to get out and start our own group or something else ‚Äì anything else. So we played that benefit concert at Oakland [2/17/79] and then a few days later there was a meeting at our house and it was brought up whether we should stay in the band anymore...and we mutually decided we'd leave.\\" Keyboardist/vocalist Brent Mydland (who shared Godchaux's suburban East Bay background) had been groomed as their replacement for nearly a year in the Bob Weir Band and made his Grateful Dead debut at San Jose State University's Spartan Stadium on April 22, 1979. During his tenure with the Dead, his only lead vocal and wholly original composition was \\"Let Me Sing Your Blues Away,\\" a collaboration with lyricist Robert Hunter released on Wake of the Flood (1973). It was performed live six times, all in 1973. He also contributed to two group compositions on Blues for Allah (1975). Keith and Donna Godchaux issued the mostly self-written Keith & Donna album in 1975 with a core band including Garcia, Spooky Tooth bassist Chrissy Stewart and Wings drummer Denny Seiwell. The album was recorded at their home in Stinson Beach, California, where they lived in the 1970s.Grateful Dead Family Discography: Keith and Donna Godchaux, accessed February 2, 2008. A touring iteration of the Keith & Donna Band with Kreutzmann on drums and former Quicksilver Messenger Service equipment manager Stephen Schuster on saxophone frequently opened for Grateful Dead-related groups in 1975, allowing Garcia to sit in on several occasions. Following the dissolution of this ensemble, the Godchauxs performed as part of the Jerry Garcia Band from 1976 to 1978. \\"Six Feet of Snow,\\" a collaboration with Lowell George of Little Feat, was featured on the latter group's Down on the Farm (1979); George had recently produced the Grateful Dead's Shakedown Street (1978). Following their departure from the Grateful Dead, the Godchauxs enjoyed an extended period of recuperation with their family in Alabama. He maintained a presence in the band's extended orbit, returning intermittently to California to perform alongside Kreutzmann in the Healy-Treece Band (a venture for Dan Healy, the band's longtime live audio engineer) and on at least one occasion with Hunter. He also formed The Ghosts (later rechristened The Heart of Gold Band) with his wife; this Bay Area-based aggregation eventually came to include a young Steve Kimock on guitar. Godchaux sustained massive head injuries in an auto accident while being driven home on his birthday by noted tie-dye artist Courtenay Pollock (who was hosting the Godchauxs at his home in San Geronimo, California as they worked with their new band) in July 1980. Shortly before the accident, he professed to Pollock that he was \\"the happiest I've ever felt in my life.\\" He died at the age of 32 on July 23, 1980, four days after his birthday. In 1994, he was inducted, posthumously, into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Grateful Dead.  Legacy  According to Phil Lesh, many fans consider the years that Keith joined through the touring hiatus in 1974 to be the best years of the Grateful Dead. In his book he writes, \\"Keith turned into a fire-breathing demon about halfway through the fall [1971] tour‚Äînot only following the band effortlessly through all our endlessly bifurcating highways and byways, but grabbing the ball and running with it, leading us into unknown regions and setting the stage for what many heads consider the peak years of the Grateful Dead. With Keith, we became the turbocharged turn-on-a-dime Grateful Dead that had only been hinted at before, but the music also became warmer and more organic, almost but not quite filling the hole Pig's absence had left.\\" Lesh has further clarified that, to him, the band was \\"never quite the same\\" after coming back from their touring hiatus in 1975. Bill Kreutzmann writes about Keith, \\"He was one of the best, if not the best, keyboardist that I‚Äôve had the honor of playing with. The Grateful Dead have played with some really good ones over the years, like Bruce Hornsby and Brent Mydland, but this guy was just outrageous. He was really competent too, in that he could pick up whatever Jerry and I started playing that day, and just run with it. He didn‚Äôt need to know the material first. He could learn songs before he was even done hearing them for the first time. And he could play just about anything.\\" References External links *Keith Godchaux Home at Dead101.com Official Grateful Dead Website Category:1948 births Category:1980 deaths Category:American rock pianists Category:American male pianists Category:Grateful Dead members Category:Musicians from Seattle Category:Road incident deaths in California Category:American rock keyboardists Category:20th-century American pianists Category:Heart of Gold Band members Category:Jerry Garcia Band members Category:20th-century American keyboardists ","title":"Keith Godchaux"},{"id":"406199","text":"The Arthur M. Sackler Gallery is an art museum of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. focusing on Asian art. The Sackler Gallery and the Freer Gallery of Art together form the Smithsonian's national museums of Asian art in the United States. The Freer and Sackler galleries house the largest Asian art research library in the country. Founded in 1982, the Gallery is named after Arthur M. Sackler, who donated approximately 1,000 objects and $4 million to the building of the museum. Located on the south side of the National Mall, and being physically connected to the Freer Gallery of Art, 96% of the museum is located underground below the Enid A. Haupt Garden. Their donations and contributions have been protested by people who accuse them of being a key contributor to the opioid crisis in the U.S. History Japanese Prime Minister Masayoshi ≈åhira visited the Freer Gallery of Art in 1979. During his visit, he announced that Japan would donate $1 million to the Smithsonian in order to assist in the building of an annex to the Freer to display Asian art. That same year, the United States Senate approved the Smithsonian Institution's request for $500,000 to build museums for Asian and African art on June 6. In June, 1980, the Smithsonian removed the South Quadrangle Project from their fiscal plan. The project resurfaced in 1981, and on December 23 Congress approved $960,000 for the new complex. It was the first time that federal funds were contributed to a project as unrestricted. In 1982, Arthur M. Sackler donated around 1,000 Asian artworks and objects to the Smithsonian Institution. The collection was valued at $50 million. Along with the object donation, Sackler also provided $4 million to build a facility to house the objects, thus founding the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery. The quadrangle construction began on June 22, 1982. An additional $36.5 million was appropriated to continue the project in October. Groundbreaking took place on June 21, 1983 with participation by Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, then Vice President George H. W. Bush and Smithsonian Secretary S. Dillon Ripley. On February 21, 1984, Milo C. Beach was declared scholarly director of the Sackler Gallery. The gallery opened on September 28, 1987. Arthur Sackler died four months before the opening. In honor of the quadrangle complex's opening, Washington, D.C. Mayor Marion Barry declared the day \\"Smithsonian Institution Day.\\" Starting in October, Milo C. Beach served as acting director of both the Sackler and the Freer. In November 1988, he became director of both. In March 2002, scholar in Islamic art Julian Raby was appointed director of the combined galleries.http://newsdesk.si.edu/photos/julian-raby-director-freer- gallery-art-and-arthur-m-sackler-gallery In 2006, J. Keith Wilson became the assistant director and curator of Chinese art. In January, 2012, the Sackler celebrated the 30th anniversary of its founding with a gift of $5 million from Sackler's widow. Architecture The grand staircase at the Sackler. The Gallery is located in the Quadrangle Complex behind the Smithsonian Institution Castle. It shares the complex with the National Museum of African Art and the S. Dillon Ripley Center. The complex, which is 96% underground and covers , was designed by Jean Paul Carlhian, with the goal of connecting various underground buildings. Geometric forms, influenced by the Smithsonian Castle, the Arts and Industries Building and the Freer Gallery of Art, were used in the design, as was pink and gray granite representative of the color of those buildings. The Sackler Gallery is next to the Freer Gallery of Art. It is decorated with designs inspired by Islamic art. A granite pavilion was built in the Enid A. Haupt Victorian Garden to serve as an entrance to the facility. A fountain, shaped like a diamond, is located on the third and lowest floor, which can be viewed from the two upper levels. Construction of a tunnel between the Freer and Sackler was begun in early 1987 and completed in 1989. The sections of the Gallery open to the public cover . Exhibitions Ancient sculptures from Jordan Exhibitions at the Gallery focus around Asian art and culture. In 1992, two exhibitions opened showcasing loaned and permanent collection objects: \\"Metalwork and Ceramics from Ancient Iran\\" and \\"Buddhist and Jain Sculpture from South Asia.\\" Both exhibitions followed renovations. The following year, \\"Contemporary Porcelain from Japan,\\" showcased 30 works by 30 Japanese artists, donated by the Japan Foundation. The first exhibition on Korean art took place in 1994, \\"Korean Arts of the Eighteenth Century: Splendor and Simplicity.\\" An exhibition about scholarly research and provenance called \\"A Mughal Hunt\\" was held in 1994. It showcased the research behind newly acquired Mughal Empire paintings. That same year, \\"A Basketmaker of Rural Japan,\\" was held. The exhibition showcased the work of Hiroshima Kazou and included works primarily on loan from the National Museum of Natural History. In 1996, the Sackler hosted the oldest sculptures to be found in Western Asia. The sculptures, found in 1974 outside of Amman, Jordan, were sent to Washington, D.C. for research and conservation. The exhibition, \\"Preserving Ancient Statues From Jordan,\\" exhibited eight pieces dating from 6500‚Äì7000 B.C. \\"King of the World: A Mughal Manuscript from the Royal Library, Windsor Castle\\", in 1997, exhibited the \\"Padshahnama\\" Mughal manuscript owned by the British Royal Family. The Shahnama was on display in early 2011 in an exhibition curated by Islamic curator Massumeh Farhad, titled \\"Shahnama: 1000 Years of the Persian Book of Kings.\\" Photography was the focus of a fall 2011 exhibition focusing on a collection of photographs of Empress Dowager Cixi, taken by a diplomat's son, Xunling. The photographs were acquired by the Smithsonian after Xunling's sister died in 1944 and a dealer sold the collection of 36 photographic plates. The Sackler exhibited only six objects in its December, 2011 exhibition \\"Ancient Iranian Ceramics.\\" The exhibit showcased pieces that are some 3,000 years old. In 2011, the Sackler indefinitely postponed an exhibition of artifacts from the Belitung shipwreck owing to possible collecting violations by the commercial organization which acquired the objects. The exhibition was originally planned by the government of Singapore, which bought the objects for $32 million from a treasure hunting company. The Gallery has also curated and hosted exhibitions about the Mesopotamian art collection of the Louvre, the paintings of Chang Dai-chien, and photographs of orientalism and colonialism in India. Contemporary artists exhibited have included Hai Bo and Ai Weiwei. The Gallery also has a number rotating/temporary exhibits, which include: * Yoga: The Art of Transformation (ending January 26, 2014) * Chigusa and the Art of Tea (opening February 22, 2014) * Kiyochika: Master of the Night, an exhibition showcasing Japanese artist Kobayashi Kiyochika (opening March 29, 2014) * An American in London: Whistler and the Thames, an exhibition showcasing the work of American artist James McNeill Whistler (opening May 3, 2014) A full list of all past, current, and future exhibitions can be found on the FreerSackler exhibitions page. =Collections= Aside from Sackler's original donation of objects, the Gallery also holds other collections. General holdings at the Gallery include Chinese, Indian, Korean and Japanese paintings, photography, contemporary ceramics from China, 19th- and 20th-century Japanese prints, contemporary Japanese pottery, and other related Asian arts. Sackler Collection The founding collection, consisting of approximately 1,000 objects, was donated by gallery namesake, Arthur M. Sackler in 1987. The Sackler collection consists of ancient and contemporary pieces, ranging from Near Eastern metalware and ceramics, South and Southeast Asian sculpture, Chinese jade and bronze pieces, and Chinese lacquerware and paintings. Vever Collection In 1986 the Sackler acquired the Vever Collection, a collection of Persian and Islamic paintings and manuscripts collected by jeweler Henri Vever. Collected between 1900 and 1943, the Vever Collection features one of the finest groupings of Persian books. Upon acquisition, Glenn Lowry and Milo Beach were the first scholars in forty years to see the objects. Conservation The Department of Conservation and Scientific Research for both the Freer and Sackler Galleries was established as the first Smithsonian facility devoted to the use of scientific methods for the study of works of art and remains one of the few facilities in the United States that specializes in the conservation of Asian paintings. Care of the collections began before the museums came into existence as Charles Lang Freer, the founder of the Freer Gallery of Art, hired Japanese painting restorers to care for his works and to prepare them for their eventual home as part of the Smithsonian Institution. In 1932, the Freer Gallery of Art hired a full-time Japanese restorer and established the East Asian Painting Conservation Studio. The Technical Laboratory, and the first use of scientific methods for the study of art at the Smithsonian Institution, started in 1951 when the chemist Rutherford J. Gettens moved from the Fogg Museum at Harvard University to the Freer. The East Asian Painting Conservation Studio and the Technical Laboratory merged in 1990 to form the Department of Conservation and Scientific Research. Among the conservation projects that the Sackler Gallery has undertaken was a 2009 project where conservators used laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory to explore the \\"fingerprints\\" of ancient Chinese gold objects from the Gallery. =Scholarship= The Sackler presents lectures and symposia to the public with the Freer has copublished the art historical journal Artibus Asiae with the Museum Rietberg in Zurich since 1991. The Freer and Sackler, along with the Metropolitan Center for Far Eastern Art Studies in Kyoto, Japan, presents the Shimada Prize for distinguished scholarship in the history of East Asian art. The award was established in 1992 in honor of Professor Shimada Shujiro, by the Freer Gallery of Art and Arthur M. Sackler Gallery and by The Metropolitan Center for Far Eastern Art Studies in Kyoto, Japan. In addition, the Sackler is able to exchange objects with other institutions (which the adjacent Freer Gallery of Art is prohibited from). Several fellowships are also available to support graduate students and visiting scholars, including the Andrew W. Mellon Fellowship, Anne Van Biema Fellowship (Japanese Visual Arts), Iran Heritage Foundation (IHF) Fellowship (Persian art), Lunder Fellowship, J. S. Lee Memorial Fellowship (Chinese Art), Smithsonian Institution Fellowship, and the Freer Fellowship. =Outreach= Exhibition at the Sackler, 2006 The Sackler has hosted a variety of celebrations and ongoing events revolving around Asian art and culture. In 1989, the Gallery hosted its first series of events, a two-month-long celebration of Persian art and culture sponsored in collaboration with the Foundation for Iranian Studies. Musician Dariush Dolat- shahi performed and workshops, lectures and other performances took place. Events often coincide with the theme of exhibitions. In 2011, Azar Nafisi and Dick Davis discussed the role of women in the Shahnameh in conjunction with an exhibition on the 1,000-year-old Persian poem. =Initiatives= Together, alongside the Freer and the Metropolitan Center for Far Eastern Studies of Kyoto, the Sackler created the Shimada Prize. The biannual $10,000 prize awards scholars of East Asian art. In 2011, the Sackler and the Freer received a major gift from donor Jahangir Amuzegar. The gift created two endowments, one for a yearly celebration of the Persian holiday of Nowruz and another to build a collection of and celebrate contemporary Iranian art. It was the largest Persian focused gift to be given to the Sackler and Freer and one of the largest Asian art donations ever given to the Smithsonian. References Further reading *Lawton, Thomas.

He discovered the original Cro-Magnon skeletons. Louis Lartet was born in Castelnau-Magnoac, in Seissan in the d√©partement of Gers. His father, √âdouard Lartet was a prominent geologist and prehistorian who played a key role in the 1860s and 1870s in finding evidence that humans had lived during the Quaternary period and Louis continued his father's researches into human prehistory. He became a member of the Soci√©t√© g√©ologique de France (Geological Society of France) in 1863 and joined the expedition organized by the Duke of Luynes to explore Palestine. This resulted in his publication of Exploration g√©ologique de la mer Morte (1876-7), which formed his doctoral thesis. In 1868, Lartet was asked to conduct excavations in a rock shelter near the French village of Les Eyzies after workmen stumbled upon extinct animal bones, flint tools, and human skulls. Lartet discovered the partial skeletons of four prehistoric adults and one infant along with perforated shells used as ornaments, an object made from ivory, and worked reindeer antler. These Cro-magnon humans were soon identified as a new prehistoric human race distinct from the Neanderthal man fossils discovered in Germany in 1856. Lartet began teaching geology at the University of Toulouse in 1873 and in 1879 he became a tenured professor of geology at the university. He became a member of the Soci√©t√© arch√©ologique du midi de la France in 1879, the Soci√©t√© d'agriculture in 1880; the Acad√©mie des sciences in 1882 and the Soci√©t√© d'histoire naturelle in 1882.

He wrote short stories in the horror and fantasy genres for the pulp magazine market, appearing in such pulps of the bizarre and uncanny as Thrilling, Ghost Stories, Startling Stories, Thrilling Wonder Stories and Strange Stories. He also wrote stories crime and adventure which appeared in such pulps as Thrilling Adventures, Complete Stories, Top-Notch, Short Stories, The Skipper, Doc Savage and Dime Adventures Magazine. Jacobi also produced some science fiction, mainly space opera, published in such magazines as Planet Stories. He was one of the last surviving pulp-fictioneers to have contributed to the legendary American horror magazine Weird Tales during its \\"glory days\\" (the 1920s and 1930s). His stories have been translated into French, Swedish, Danish and Dutch. Biography =Early life and education= Jacobi was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota in 1904 and lived there throughout his life. He was a lifelong bachelor. He was a voracious reader, gulping down at an early age quantities of Jules Verne, Edgar Allan Poe, H.G. Wells as well as the Frank Merriwell and Tom Swift boys' adventure yarns. Jacobi was always a writer; at his junior high school he earned good pocket- money concocting his own 'dime novels' (short story booklets) and selling them to fellow students as 10 cents-a-piece.Jack Adrian. \\"Obituary: Carl Jacobi\\". The Independent (Fri January 23, 2015) Jacobi attended the University of Minnesota from 1927 to 1930, majoring in English Literature, where he began his writing career in campus magazines and was an undergraduate classmate of Donald Wandrei. He wrote of this period on Thrilling Wonder Stories (June 1939) that \\"I tried to divide my time between rhetoric courses and the geology lab. As an underclassman I was somewhat undecided whether future life would find me studying rocks and fossils or simply pounding a typewriter. The typewriter won.\\" Jacobi's first stories were published while he was at the University. Long before graduation he made his first professional sale, a short detective tale, \\"Rumbling Cannon\\", to Secret Service Stories. This ought to have paid around fifty dollars but Jacobi received nothing since the pulp folded soon after the story was published. The last of the stories he published while at university, \\"Moss Island\\", was a graduate's contribution to The Quest of Central High School, and \\"Mive\\" (which won a college-wide contest judged by Margaret Culkin Banning), published in the University of Minnesota's The Minnesota Quarterly. Both stories were later sold to Amazing Stories (Winter 1932) and Weird Tales respectively and marked his debut in professional magazines. \\"Mive\\" (Weird Tales, 1932) brought him payment of 25 dollars. \\"Mive\\" was praised by H. P. Lovecraft in his letter to Jacobi of 27 February 1932: \\"Mive please me immensely, and I told Wright that I was glad to see at least one story whose weirdness of incident was made convincing by adequate emotional preparation and suitably developed atmosphere.\\" Lovecraft commended Jacobi's work to Derleth and thereby helped set up the long-term relationship Arkham House would have with Jacobi. Beginning in 1928, Jacobi corresponded with adventure-pulp veteran Arthur O. Friel. Jacobi's early story \\"The Monument\\" (1932) was submitted only once‚Äîto Farnsworth Wright of Weird Tales. It was not submitted subsequently but was discovered in a filing cabinet when R. Dixon Smith was researching his biography Lost in the Rentharpian Hills: Spanning the Decades with Carl Jacobi (1985) and finally saw print when included by Smith in Smoke of the Snake (1994) = 1930s= Jacobi joined the editorial staff of The Minnesota Quarterly, and after graduation in 1931, he became a news reporter, reviewer and sub-editor for the Minneapolis Star, as well as a frequent reviewer of books and plays. He also served on the staff of the Minnesota Ski-U-Mah, a campus humor magazine (described on the jackets of Jacobi's books as 'a scholastic publication'). After a while regular hours palled, and he left the Star, renting an office in uptown Minneapolis in which were typewriter, paper, a few reference books, and a list of editorial addresses in New York. Jacobi met August Derleth in January 1931 when Derleth was visiting Minneapolis to see Donald Wandrei. Jacobi had read Derleth's stories in Weird Tales and his Solar Pons stories in Dragnet and asked to be introduced; they met together, and with Donald Wandrei, for a literary roundtable at Minneapolis' Rainbow Cafe. Though Derleth and Jacobi corresponded for 40 years thereafter, Jacobi saw him but a few times in St Paul and never visited Derleth's home of Sauk City, Wisconsin. Over the following summer, when Derleth worked briefly as an editor for Fawcett Publications, outside Minneapolis, the three men frequently got together for brainstorming sessions. Jacobi owned his own private retreat, a cabin at Minnewashta in the Carver country outlands of Minneapolis. His intimate familiarity with the terrain and environment there provided the setting for many of his most distinguished stories. From 1932 until Jacobi's death in 1997, pulp writer Hugh B. Cave corresponded with Jacobi. Scores of their letters are quoted in Cave's memoir Magazines I Remember (Chicago: Tattered Pages Press, 1994), though many of Jacobi's early letters to Cave were lost in a fire in the early 1970s, along with copies of all Cave's early stories. Jacobi and Cave often criticised and improved each other's stories.W. H. Pugmire, ed. Carl Jacobi: An Appreciation. Pensacola, FL: Stellar Z Publications, 1977, p. 7 Jack Adrian writes: > In the depression years of the early 1930s, the pulp-writer needed as > formidable a creative armoury as possible, along with a certain amount of > luck, and cunning, to crack even the lowest paying markets. Jacobi had a > useful knack for dreaming up memorable milieu against which to set his > tales, and bizarre situations that stayed in the mind long after the > magazine the story itself was in had been finished and tossed away.

This was \\"Revelations in Black\\", a chilling, and much-reprinted, > vampire tale set in an old stone farmhouse outside of Minneapolis Jacobi had > driven past one night (the house's eerie statue-lined garden, as seen by > brilliant moonlight, had caught his eye and his imagination. Jacobi wrote scores of tales for all the best-known magazines of fantasy and science fiction and was represented in numerous anthologies of imaginative fiction published in the United States, England and New Zealand. His stories were translated into French, Swedish, Danish and Dutch. Many of his tales were published in anthologies edited by Derleth, and Arkham House published his first three short story collections. Stories also appeared in such magazines as Short Stories, Railroad Magazine, The Toronto Star, Wonder Stories, MacLean's magazine, Ghost Stories, Strange Stories, Thrilling Mystery, Startling Stories, Complete Stories, Top-Notch and others. Though best known for his macabre fiction, Jacobi also wrote science fiction, weird-menace yarns and adventure stories.\\"Jacobi, Carl\\" in Encyclopedia of pulp fiction writers by Lee Server. Facts on File (2002) , (pp. 155-6) Already by 1935, Jacobi was seeing a greater percentage of rejected stories. Pressed by financial problems and the need to help his parents survive the Depression, he took a $50 a week job as a continuity writer for the local radio station where he stayed until 1940. Jacobi was fascinated by adventure tales with a Southeast Asia setting, particularly in regard to Dutch central Borneo and the Maritime Southeast Asia. Jacobi wrote to officials working in Southeast Asia to obtain details for his stories, and he had considerable knowledge of that background in his fiction. According to Jack Adrian, \\"He would write to those in charge of far- flung outposts deep in the heart of the Borneo jungle, say, demanding geographical detail, obscure ethnic lore, atmospheric and forestall conditions; anything, in short, you couldn't get out of a book. This way he became an acknowledged expert in a field he had created himself, at the same time inventing whole new fiction subgenres, such as \\"Borneo terror tale\\", \\"New Guinea adventure\\" and so on. Later he turned the same trick with Baluchistan.Jack Adrian. \\"Obituary: Carl Jacobi\\". The Independent (Fri January 23, 2015) In 1939, Jacobi met writer Clifford D. Simak when Simak moved to Minneapolis to take a job with the Minneapolis Star; they became friends. At this time, Jacobi listed his hobbies as \\"studying the night sky with a 60 power glass; continuing contacts with friends now located in jumping off spots of the South Seas and Malaysia; and collecting old tobacco tins.\\"\\"Fiction Family: Carl Jacobi in Thrilling Wonder Stories (June 1939) Fritz Leiber wrote that: \\"his best tales surely include \\"Mive\\", \\"Carnaby's Fish\\", \\"Revelations in Black\\", \\"Moss Island\\", \\"Portrait in Moonlight\\", \\"The Lo Prello Paper\\", \\"The Aquarium\\", \\"The Singleton Barrier\\"...and \\"The Unpleasantness at Carver House\\".W. H. Pugmire, ed. Carl Jacobi: An Appreciation. Pensacola, FL: Stellar Z Publications, 1977, p. 16 = 1940s and 1950s= In 1940-41, Jacobi served as editor of Midwest Media, an advertising and radio trade journal. He then spent some years as a reporter, and reviewer of books and plays, for the Minneapolis Star. He worked for them for many years, writing fiction on the side. Following this, he \\"travelled a spell; fooled about with telegraphy, both wireless and Morse for another spell; then turned to writing fiction full-time.\\" At the time of the compilation of Revelations in Black (1947), Jacobi's first collection, Jacobi was at work on a novel, but it is unknown whether this was completed. Jacobi continued to sell stories to Weird Tales up through the 1950s, with that market taking eighteen of his stories in all. When the pulp markets collapsed, Jacobi took regular employment with one of the Honeywell defense plants as an electronics inspector, a job he had through WWII and beyond, while writing part-time. He worked the night shift at Honeywell seven days a week, which had a severe effect on both his writing schedule and his health, leading to heart problems. = 1960s= 1964 saw the publication of Jacobi's second collection of weird fiction, Portraits in Moonlight, and several short stories published in magazines. = 1970s and 1980s= In 1972, Arkham House published Jacobi's third collection of weird fiction, Disclosures in Scarlet. Don Herron, writing in Jack Sullivan's Penguin Encyclopedia of Horror and the Supernatural, calls Jacobi's 1972 story \\"The Unpleasantness at Carver House\\" his masterpiece - \\"a ghoulish tale of horror and madness that may rank with the best work of Robert Aickman and Walter de la Mare in its brilliant use of suggestion. A feeling of unease pervades the story, and its many macabre implications prey on the imagination long after the last sentence is read.\\" In 1973, Jacobi attended the science- fiction convention Torcon II 31st World Science Fiction Convention, held in Canada, having been persuaded to attend by literary agent Kirby McCauley. There he met such figures as J. Vernon Shea and Robert Bloch. In the same year, Etchings and Odysseys magazine was launched in Minneapolis by Kirby McCauley, John Koblas, Eric Carlson, Joe West and others. Jacobi attended the launch, along with Mary Elizabeth Counselman, who had frequently appeared in the pages of the same magazines as Jacobi. Jacobi also met E. Hoffman Price (visiting from the West) at both Donald Wandrei's home and at Etchings and Odysseys 'headquarters'. Koblas had come to know Jacobi much earlier, and received encouraging criticism from Jacobi on his manuscripts. 1980 saw a collection of Jacobi's stories published in French, under the title Les ecarlates. In 1989 appeared a collection of all-reprint adventure stories from the pulps, East of Samarinda. In the late 1980s, Robert M. Price's Cryptic Publications published a number of obscure Jacobi stories in such magazines as Astro-Adventures, Pulp Stories, Pulse-Pounding Adventure Stories and Shudder Stories. Jacobi continued to write macabre stories in the 1970s and 1980s. Many are collected in his final volume, The Smoke of the Snake (1994). His last published story, \\"A Quire of Foolscap\\" (Whispers, Oct 1987) contains an in-joke: an unfaithful wife and her lover check into a motel \\"out on Carcosa\\", an obvious reference to both Ambrose Bierce's \\"An Inhabitant of Carcosa\\" and Robert W. Chambers' The King in Yellow, as well as affectionate praise for Karl Edward Wagner's newly established publishing firm (see Carcosa). =Later life and death= Debilitating illness crippled Jacobi during the final half- decade of his life, although his literary agent and biographer R. Dixon Smith did much to alleviate his various afflictions. Jacobi died at St Louis Park, Minnesota on 25 August 1997.

A member of the Democratic Party, he served as the U.S. Representative from California's 11th congressional district from 1973 until his assassination during the Jonestown massacre in 1978. After the Watts riots of 1965, Ryan took a job as a substitute school teacher to investigate and document conditions in the area. In 1970, he launched an investigation into California prisons. While presiding as chairman of the Assembly committee that oversaw prison reform, he used a pseudonym to enter Folsom State Prison as an inmate. During his time in Congress, Ryan traveled to Newfoundland to investigate the practice of seal hunting. He was also famous for vocal criticism of the lack of Congressional oversight of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and co-authored the Hughes‚ÄìRyan Amendment, passed in 1974. Ryan was shot and killed at an airstrip in Guyana on November 18, 1978, as he and his party were attempting to leave. He had traveled to Guyana to investigate claims that people were being held against their will at the Peoples Temple Jonestown settlement. Shortly after the airstrip shootings, 909 members of the Jonestown settlement died in a mass suicide-murder by drinking cyanide-laced Flavor Aid. He was the second sitting member of the U.S. House of Representatives to be assassinated in office, after James M. Hinds in 1868.Other members of the House of Representatives have been killed while in office, although not as assassination attempts; others have been the target of deliberate assassination attempts, albeit without success to date. See List of United States Congress members killed or wounded in office for details. \\"Thirty-five years later, Ryan remains the only U.S. representative to be killed in the line of duty.\\" Ryan was posthumously awarded the Congressional Gold Medal in 1983.  Early life and education  Ryan was born in Lincoln, Nebraska. During his early life his family moved frequently, through Illinois, Florida, New York, Wisconsin, and Massachusetts. Ryan graduated from Campion Jesuit High School in Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, in 1943. He then received V-12 officer training at Bates College and served with the United States Navy from 1943 to 1946 as a submariner. Ryan graduated from Nebraska's Creighton University with a B.A. in 1949 and an M.S. in 1951. He served as a teacher, school administrator and South San Francisco city councilman from 1956 to 1962. He taught English at Capuchino High School, and chaperoned the marching band in 1961 to Washington, D.C., to participate in President John F. Kennedy's inaugural parade. Ryan was inspired by Kennedy's call to service in his inaugural address and decided to run for higher office. Career alt=Black and white of a man wearing a suit and a tie. His name is written below. =State of California= In 1962 Ryan was elected mayor of South San Francisco. He served less than a year before being elected to the California State Assembly, winning the 27th district race by 20,000 votes. He had run for the Assembly's 25th district in 1958, but lost to Republican Louis Francis. Ryan served as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1964 and 1968 and held his Assembly seat until 1972, when he was elected to the United States House of Representatives. He was reelected three times. U.S. Congresswoman and former California State Senator and Ryan aide Jackie Speier described Ryan's style of investigation as \\"experiential legislating\\". After the Watts riots of 1965, Ryan went to the area and took a job as a substitute school teacher to investigate and document conditions there. In 1970, using a pseudonym, Ryan had himself arrested, detained, and strip-searched to investigate conditions in California's prisons. He stayed for ten days as an inmate at Folsom State Prison while presiding as chairman on the Assembly committee that oversaw prison reform. As a California assemblyman, Ryan also chaired legislative subcommittee hearings and presided over hearings involving his eventual successor as Congressman, Tom Lantos. Ryan pushed through significant educational policies and authored what came to be known as the Ryan Act, which established an independent regulatory commission to monitor educational credentialing in California. =United States Congress= During his time in Congress, Ryan went to Newfoundland with James Jeffords to investigate the inhumane killing of seals, and became famous for his vocal criticism of the lack of Congressional oversight of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), authoring the Hughes‚ÄìRyan Amendment, which would have required extensive CIA notification of Congress about covert operations. Ryan once told Dick Cheney that leaking a state secret was an appropriate way for a member of Congress to block an \\"ill-conceived operation\\". He supported Patty Hearst, and along with Senator S. I. Hayakawa, delivered Hearst's application for a presidential commutation to the Pardon Attorney. Peoples Temple In 1978 reports of widespread abuse and human rights violations in Jonestown at the Peoples Temple, led by cult leader Jim Jones, began to filter out of its Guyana enclaves. Ryan was friends with the father of former Temple member Bob Houston, whose mutilated body was found near train tracks on October 5, 1976, three days after a taped telephone conversation with Houston's ex-wife in which they discussed his leaving the Temple. Ryan's interest was further aroused by the custody battle between the leader of a \\"Concerned Relatives\\" group, Timothy Stoen, and Jones following a Congressional \\"white paper\\" by Stoen detailing the events. p. 227 Ryan was one of 91 Congressmen to write Guyanese Prime Minister Forbes Burnham on Stoen's behalf. After reading an article in The San Francisco Examiner, Ryan declared his intention to go to Jonestown, an agricultural commune in Guyana where Jones and roughly 1,000 Temple members resided. His decision was also influenced both by the Concerned Relatives group, which consisted primarily of Californians, as did the Temple, and by his own distaste for social injustice. According to the San Francisco Chronicle, while he investigated, the United States Department of State \\"repeatedly stonewalled Ryan's attempts to find out what was going on in Jonestown\\" and told him that \\"everything was fine\\". The State Department characterized possible United States government action in Guyana against Jonestown as a potential \\"legal controversy\\", but Ryan at least partially rejected this viewpoint. In a later article in The Chronicle, Ryan was described as having \\"bucked the local Democratic establishment and the Jimmy Carter administration's State Department\\" in order to prepare for his own investigation. =Travels to Jonestown= On November 1, 1978, Ryan announced that he would visit Jonestown.Rebecca Moore, American as Cherry Pie, 2000, Jonestown Institute, San Diego State University He did so as part of a government investigation, with governmental permission and funding. He made the journey in his role as chairman of a congressional subcommittee with jurisdiction over US citizens living in foreign countries. He asked the other members of the Bay Area congressional delegation to join him on the trip to Jonestown, but they all declined. Ryan also invited his friend, Indiana Congressman and future Vice President Dan Quayle, who had served with Ryan on the Government Operations Committee, but Quayle was unable to go. The investigation group was initially to consist only of press and a few members of Ryan's staff, but once the media learned of the trip the entourage ballooned to include, among others, concerned relatives of Temple members. Ryan traveled to Jonestown with 17 Bay Area relatives of Peoples Temple members, several newspaper reporters and an NBC TV team. When Jones's legal counsel attempted to impose restrictive conditions on the visit, Ryan responded that he would go to Jonestown whether Jones permitted it or not. Ryan's stated position was that a \\"settlement deep in the bush might be reasonably run on authoritarian lines\\" but that its residents must be allowed to come and go as they pleased. He further asserted that if the place had become \\"a gulag\\", he would do everything he could to \\"free the captives\\". =Jungle ambush and assassination= On November 14, according to the Foreign Affairs Committee report, Ryan left Washington and arrived in Georgetown, the capital of Guyana, from Jonestown, with his congressional delegation of government officials, media representatives and some members of the \\"Concerned Relatives\\". That night the delegation stayed at a local hotel where, despite confirmed reservations, most of the rooms had been canceled and reassigned, leaving the delegation to sleep in the lobby. For three days Ryan continued to negotiate with Jones's legal counsel and held perfunctory meetings with embassy personnel and Guyanese officials. While in Georgetown, Ryan visited the Temple's Georgetown headquarters in the suburb of Lamaha Gardens. He asked to speak to Jones by radio. Sharon Amos, the highest-ranking Temple member present, told Ryan that he could not, because his visit was unscheduled. On November 17, Ryan's aide Jackie Speier (who became a Congresswoman in 2008), the United States embassy Deputy Chief of Mission Richard Dwyer, a Guyanese Ministry of Information officer, nine journalists, and four Concerned Relatives representatives of the delegation boarded a small plane for the flight to an airfield at Port Kaituma, a few miles outside of Jonestown. At first, only the Temple legal counsel was allowed off the plane, but eventually the entire entourage, including Gordon Lindsay, reporting for NBC, was allowed in. Initially the group was warmly welcomed, but Temple member Vernon Gosney handed NBC correspondent Don Harris (mistaking him for Ryan) a note that read \\"Vernon Gosney and (Temple member) Monica Bagby: please help us get out of Jonestown\\". Jones was made aware of the note, and Gosney tried and failed to impress upon Ryan the extreme danger that his delegation was now in. That night the media and the delegation returned to the airfield for accommodations after Jones refused to let them stay the night. The rest of the group remained. The next morning, Ryan, Speier, and Dwyer continued their interviews, and met a woman who secretly expressed her wish to leave Jonestown with her family and another family. Around 11:00 a.m., the media and the delegation returned and took part in interviewing Peoples Temple members. Around 3:00 p.m., 14 Temple defectors, and Larry Layton posing as a defector, boarded a truck and were taken to the airstrip, with Ryan wishing to stay another night to assist any others who wanted to leave. Shortly thereafter, a knife attack on Ryan failed while he was arbitrating a family dispute on leaving. Against Ryan's protests, Dwyer ordered Ryan to leave, but he promised to return later to address the dispute. alt=An empty truck sits on an airfield. The entire group left Jonestown and arrived at the Kaituma airstrip by 4:45 p.m. Their exit transport planes, a twin-engine Otter and a Cessna, did not arrive until 5:10 p.m. The smaller six-seat Cessna was taxiing to the end of the runway when one of its occupants, Larry Layton, opened fire on those inside, wounding several. Concurrently, several other Peoples Temple members who had escorted the group out began to open fire on the transport plane, killing Ryan, three journalists and a defecting Temple member, while wounding nine others, including Speier. The gunmen riddled Ryan's body with bullets before shooting him in the face. The passengers on the Cessna subdued Layton and the survivors on both planes fled into nearby fields during and after the attack. That afternoon, before the news became public, the wife of Ryan's aide William Holsinger received three threatening phone calls. The caller allegedly said, \\"Tell your husband that his meal ticket just had his brains blown out, and he better be careful.\\" The Holsingers then fled to Lake Tahoe and later Houston. They never returned to San Francisco.Bernstein-Wax, Jessica, \\"Jonestown still reverberates in Bay Area 30 years later\\", San Jose Mercury News, November 16, 2008 After taking off, the Cessna radioed in a report of the attack, and U.S. Ambassador John R. Burke went to the residence of Prime Minister Burnham. It was not until the next morning that the Guyanese army could cut through the jungle and reach Jonestown. They discovered 909 of its inhabitants dead. They died in what the United States House of Representatives described as a \\"mass suicide/murder ritual\\". =Conviction of Larry Layton= Larry Layton, brother of former Peoples Temple member and author of Seductive Poison Deborah Layton, was convicted in 1986 of conspiracy in Ryan's murder. Temple defectors boarding the truck to Port Kaituma had said of Layton that \\"there's no way he's a defector. He's too close to Jones.\\" Layton was the only former Temple member to be tried in the United States for criminal acts relating to the murders at Jonestown. He was convicted on four different murder-related counts. On March 3, 1987, Layton was sentenced to concurrent sentences of life in prison for \\"aiding and abetting the murder of Congressman Leo Ryan\\", \\"conspiracy to murder an internationally protected person, Richard Dwyer, Deputy Chief of Mission for the United States in the Republic of Guyana\\", as well as 15 years in prison on other related counts. He was eligible for parole in five years. On June 3, 1987, the United States District Court of the Northern District of California denied Layton's motion to set aside the conviction \\"on the ground that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel during his second trial\\". After 18 years in prison, Layton was released from custody in April 2002.Larry Layton released Memorial Veterans for Peace Chapter 124 was named the Leo J. Ryan Memorial chapter. =Burial= alt=A white-colored tombstone stands in the middle of a cemetery. \\"Leo J. Ryan Jr\\" is engraved on it. Ryan's body was returned to the United States and interred at Golden Gate National Cemetery in San Bruno, California. His official Congressional Memorial Services were compiled into a book, Leo J. Ryan ‚Äì Memorial Services ‚Äì Held In The House Of Representatives & Senate Of The U.S., Together With Remarks. Ryan's younger sister Shannon said she was surprised both by the number of supporters who attended the funeral and by the \\"outgrowth of real, honest sorrow\\". Legacy and honors * In 1983 the United States Congress posthumously awarded Ryan a Congressional Gold Medal, as the only member of Congress killed in the line of duty; President Ronald Reagan signed the bill. In Reagan's remarks about the medal, he said: \\"It was typical of Leo Ryan's concern for his constituents that he would investigate personally the rumors of mistreatment in Jonestown that reportedly affected so many from his district.\\" Ryan's daughters Patricia and Erin helped garner support for the medal in time for the fifth anniversary of his death. * In 1984 the National Archives and Records Center in San Bruno, California was named the Leo J. Ryan Federal Building in his honor, through a Congressional bill passed unanimously and signed by Reagan.The Washington Post, November 30, 1984 v107 pC4 col 5 (10 col in), \\"Leo Ryan honored.

In 2008 she won a special election to the US Congress from California's 12th congressional district, much of it formerly Ryan's constituency.SFGATE: Voters send Jackie Speier to Washington Since 2013 it has been the state's 14th congressional district. =Daughters= Shannon Jo Ryan, Ryan's eldest daughter, joined the Rajneesh movement. After the Bhagwan moved to Oregon in 1981, she joined his commune, which became known as Rajneeshpuram. Taking the name Ma Amrita Pritam, by December 1982 she had married another member, who also lived at the commune. Patricia Ryan received her master's degree in public administration from George Washington University in Washington, D.C., and served from 2001 to 2012 as executive director of the California Mental Health Directors Association (now the County Behavioral Health Directors Association of California). During the 1980s she became involved as a volunteer and eventually served as president of the board of the national Cult Awareness Network. Erin Ryan graduated from University of California, Hastings College of the Law. and worked as an intelligence analyst for the Central Intelligence Agency until 1992. She next worked in New York as a pastry chef for eight years. In 2000 Erin Ryan became an aide to her father's former aide, California Senator Jackie Speier. =Anniversaries= Sign at the alt=A blue sign stands in the middle of a park. \\"Leo J.

On the 25th anniversary of Ryan's death, a special memorial tribute was held in his honor in Foster City, California. His family and friends, including his three daughters and Jackie Speier, attended. The San Francisco Chronicle reported, \\"Over and over today, people described a great man who continually exceeded his constituents' expectations.\\" Near the end of the memorial service, parents of those who had died in Jonestown stood to honor and thank Ryan for giving his life while trying to save their children. After the service ended, mounted police escorted the family and friends into Foster City's Leo J. Ryan Memorial Park. A wreath was laid next to a commemorative rock that honors Ryan. The same year, his daughter Erin Ryan, an aide to Speier, attended a memorial for those who died at Jonestown, held at the Evergreen Cemetery in Oakland. On each anniversary of Leo Ryan's death, Jackie Speier and Patricia Ryan visit his grave at the Golden Gate National Cemetery. For the 30th anniversary, Speier sponsored a bill to designate the United States Postal Service facility at 210 South Ellsworth Avenue in San Mateo, California, the \\"Leo J. Ryan Post Office Building\\". President George W. Bush signed it into law on October 21, 2008. On November 17, 2008, Speier spoke at the dedication ceremony at the post office. In part, she said, > There are those ‚Äì still, thirty years after his passing ‚Äì who question his > motives, or the wisdom of his actions. But criticism was just fine with Leo. > Leo Ryan never did anything because he thought it would make him popular. He > was more interested in doing what he knew was right. In popular culture Ryan has been portrayed in films about the Jonestown mass murder/suicide, including by actor Gene Barry in the 1979 film Guyana: Crime of the Century, and by Ned Beatty in the 1980 made-for-TV miniseries Guyana Tragedy: The Story of Jim Jones. His assassination was discussed in the documentaries Jonestown: The Life and Death of Peoples Temple (2006), on The History Channel documentaries Cults: Dangerous Devotion and Jonestown: Paradise Lost (2006), and the MSNBC production Witness to Jonestown (2008), which aired on the 30th anniversary of Ryan's assassination and the mass suicides at Jonestown. In 2012, National Geographic's Seconds From Disaster aired the sixth-season episode \\"Jonestown Cult Suicide\\", which recreated Ryan's assassination.

In simple terms, a tradeoff is where one thing increases and another must decrease. Tradeoffs stem from limitations of many origins, including simple physics ‚Äì for instance, only a certain volume of objects can fit into a given space, so a full container must remove some items in order to accept any more, and vessels can carry a few large items or multiple small items. Tradeoffs also commonly refer to different configurations of a single item, such as the tuning of strings on a guitar to enable different notes to be played, as well as allocation of time and attention towards different tasks. The concept of a tradeoff suggests a tactical or strategic choice made with full comprehension of the advantages and disadvantages of each setup. An economic example is the decision to invest in stocks, which are risky but carry great potential return, versus bonds, which are generally safer but with lower potential returns. The term is also used widely in an evolutionary context, in which case the processes of natural selection and sexual selection are in reference as the ultimate decisive factors.Garland, T., Jr. 2014. Quick guide: Tradeoffs. Current Biology 24:R60-R61. In biology, the concepts of tradeoffs and constraints are often closely related. In economics, a trade-off is commonly expressed in terms of the opportunity cost of one potential choice, which is the loss of the best available alternative. An opportunity cost example of trade-offs for an individual would be the decision by a full-time worker to take time off work with a salary of $50,000 to attend medical school with annual tuition of $30,000 and earning $150,000 as a doctor after 7 years of study. If we assume for the sake of simplicity that the medical school only allows full-time study, then the individual considering stopping work would face a trade-off between not going to medical school and earning $50,000 at work, or going to medical school and losing $50,000 in salary and having to pay $30,000 in tuition but earning $150,000 or more per year after 7 years of study. Examples  The concept of a trade-off is often used to describe situations in everyday life. Trash cans that are used inside and then taken out to the street and emptied into a Dumpster can be small or large. A large trash can does not need to be taken out to the Dumpster so often, but it may become so heavy when full that the user risks strain or back injury when moving it. The choice of waste receptacle is a trade-off between the frequency of needing to take the trash out for the Dumpster versus the ease and safety of use. In the case of food waste, a second trade-off presents itself as large trash cans are more likely to sit for a long time in the kitchen, leading to higher levels of decomposing food indoors and a potential pest attraction. With a small trash can, the can will be taken out to the Dumpster more often, thus eliminating the persist rot that attracts pests. Of course, a user of a large trashcan could carry the can outside frequently anyway, but the heavier can would weigh more and the user would have to think more about when to take the can out, or confine themselves to a schedule, compared to a smaller can which is evidently full when it takes taking out. In cold climates, mittens in which all the fingers are in the same compartment serve well to keep the hands warm, but this arrangement also confines finger movement and prevents the full range of hand function; gloves, with their separate fingers, do not have this drawback, but they do not keep the fingers as warm as mittens do. As such, with mittens and gloves, warmth versus dexterity is the trade-off. In a like fashion, warm coats are often bulky and hence they impede freedom of movement for the wearer. Thin coats, such as those worn by winter sports athletes, give the wearer more freedom of movement, but they are not as warm. When copying music from compact discs to a computer, lossy compression formats, such as MP3, are used routinely to save hard disk space, but information is \\"thrown away\\" to the detriment of sound quality. Lossless compression schemes, such as FLAC or ALAC take much more disc space, but do not affect the sound quality as much, thus providing better sound. Large cars can carry many people (five or more), and since they have larger crumple zones, they may be safer in an accident. However they also tend to be heavy (and often not very aerodynamic) and hence have relatively poor fuel economy. Small cars like the Smart Car can only carry two people, and their light weight means they are very fuel efficient. At the same time, the smaller size and weight of small cars means that they have smaller crumple zones, which means occupants are less protected in case of an accident. In addition, if a small car has an accident with a larger, heavier car, the occupants of the smaller car will fare more poorly. Thus car size (large versus small) involves multiple tradeoffs regarding passenger capacity, accident safety and fuel economy. In athletics, sprint running demands different physical attributes from running a marathon. As such, the two contests have distinct events in competitions such as the Olympics, and each pursuit features distinct teams of athletes. Whether a professional runner is better suited to marathon running versus sprinting is a trade-off based on the runner's morphology and physiology (e.g., variation in muscle fiber type), as well as the runner's individual interest, preference and other motivational factors. This tradeoff is chiefly from the perspective of a sport's recruiter, who decides what role a prospective athlete would best suit on a team. The meaning of trade off quite similar to that of Opportunity cost In economics In economics a trade-off is expressed in terms of the opportunity cost of a particular choice, which is the loss of the most preferred alternative given up. A tradeoff, then, involves a sacrifice that must be made to obtain a certain product, service or experience, rather than others that could be made or obtained using the same required resources. For example, for a person going to a basketball game, their opportunity cost is the loss of the alternative of watching a particular television program at home. If the basketball game occurs during her or his working hours, then the opportunity cost would be several hours of lost work, as she/he would need to take time off work. Many factors affect the tradeoff environment within a particular country, including availability of raw materials, a skilled labor force, machinery for producing a product, technology and capital, market rate to produce that product on reasonable time scale, and so forth. A trade-off in economics is often illustrated graphically by a Pareto frontier (named after the economist Vilfredo Pareto), which shows the greatest (or least) amount of one thing that can be attained for each of various given amounts of the other. As an example, in production theory the trade-off between output of one good and output of another is illustrated graphically by the production possibilities frontier. The Pareto frontier is also used in multi-objective optimization. In finance, the capital asset pricing model includes an efficient frontier that shows the highest level of expected return that any portfolio could have given any particular level of risk, as measured by the variance of portfolio return. In other specific fields In biology, tradeoffs occur when a beneficial change in one trait is linked to a detrimental change in another trait. In environmental resource management, trade-offs occur among different targets. For example, these occur among biodiversity conservation, carbon sequestration and distributive equity in the distribution of funds of the program for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+), as maximizing one of these targets implies reducing the outcomes in the other two targets. In demography, tradeoff examples may include maturity, fecundity, parental care, parity, senescence, and mate choice. For example, the higher the fecundity (number of offspring), the lower the parental care that each offspring will receive. Parental care as a function of fecundity would show a negative sloped linear graph. A related phenomenon, known as demographic compensation, arises when the different components of species life cycles (survival, growth, fecundity, etc.) show negative correlations across the distribution ranges. For example, survival may be higher towards the northern edge of the distribution, while fecundity or growth increases towards the south, leading to a compensation that allows the species to persist along an environmental gradient. Contrasting trends in life cycle components may arise through tradeoffs in resource allocation, but also through independent but opposite responses to environmental conditions. Tradeoffs are important in engineering. For example, in electrical engineering, negative feedback is used in amplifiers to trade gain for other desirable properties, such as improved bandwidth, stability of the gain and/or bias point, noise immunity, and reduction of nonlinear distortion. Similarly, tradeoffs are used to maximise power efficiency in medical devices whilst guaranteeing the required measurement quality.E. Aguilar Pelaez et al., \\"LED power reduction trade-offs for ambulatory pulse oximetry,\\" 2007 29th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society, Lyon, 2007, pp. 2296-2299. doi: 10.1109/IEMBS.2007.4352784, URL: http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber;=4352784&isnumber;=4352185 In computer science, tradeoffs are viewed as a tool of the trade. A program can often run faster if it uses more memory (a space‚Äìtime tradeoff). Consider the following examples: * By compressing an image, you can reduce transmission time/costs at the expense of CPU time to perform the compression and decompression. Depending on the compression method, this may also involve the tradeoff of a loss in image quality. * By using a lookup table, you may be able to reduce CPU time at the expense of space to hold the table, e.g. to determine the parity of a byte you can either look at each bit individually (using shifts and masks), or use a 256-entry table giving the parity for each possible bit-pattern, or combine the upper and lower nibbles and use a 16-entry table. * For some situations (e.g. string manipulation), a compiler may be able to use inline code for greater speed, or call run-time routines for reduced memory; the user of the compiler should be able to indicate whether speed or space is more important. The Software Engineering Institute has a specific method for analysing tradeoffs,http://www.sei.cmu.edu/architecture/tools/atam/ called the Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method (ATAM). Strategy board games often involve tradeoffs: for example, in chess you might trade a pawn for an improved position. In a worst-case scenario, a chess player might even tradeoff the loss of a valuable piece (even the Queen) to protect the King. In Go, you might trade thickness for influence. Ethics often involves competing interests that must be traded off against each other, such as the interests of different people, or different principles (e.g. is it ethical to use information resulting from inhumane or illegal experiments to treat disease today?) In medicine, patients and physicians are often faced with difficult decisions involving tradeoffs. One example is localized prostate cancer where patients need to weigh the possibility of a prolonged life expectancy against possible stressful or unpleasant treatment side-effects (patient trade-off). Governmental tradeoffs are among the most controversial political and social difficulties of any time. All of politics can be viewed as a series of tradeoffs based upon which core values are most core to the most people or politicians. Political campaigns also involve tradeoffs, as when attack ads may energize the political base but alienate undecided voters. With work schedules, employees will often use a tradeoff of \\"9/80\\" where an 80-hour work period is compressed into a narrow group of 9 nearly-9 hour working days over the traditional 10 8-hour working days, allowing the employee to take every second Friday off.

The adult has blue-grey upperparts with cinnamon underparts, a white throat and face with a black stripe through the eyes, a straight grey bill and a black crown. Its call, which has been likened to a tin trumpet, is high-pitched and nasal. It breeds in coniferous forests across Canada, Alaska and the northeastern and western United States. Though often a permanent resident, it regularly irrupts further south if its food supply fails. There are records of vagrants occurring as far south as the Gulf Coast and northern Mexico. It forages on the trunks and large branches of trees, often descending head first, sometimes catching insects in flight. It eats mainly insects and seeds, especially from conifers. It excavates its nest in dead wood, often close to the ground, smearing the entrance with pitch. Taxonomy In 1760 the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the red-breasted nuthatch in his Ornithologie based on a specimen collected in Canada. He used the French name Le torchepot de Canada and the Latin Sitta Canadensis. The two stars (**) at the start of the section indicates that Brisson based his description on the examination of a specimen. Although Brisson coined Latin names for the species, these usually do not conform to the binomial system and none of them are recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his Systema Naturae for the twelfth edition, he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson. One of these was the red-breasted nuthatch. Linnaeus included a brief description and used Brisson's name Sitta canadensis as his binomial name. Like all nuthatches, the red-breasted nuthatch is assigned to the genus Sitta (Linnaeus, 1758), a name derived from sittƒì (), the Ancient Greek word for the Eurasian nuthatch. The specific epithet canadensis is New Latin for \\"belonging to Canada\\". \\"Nuthatch\\" is a linguistic corruption of \\"nuthack\\", referring to the bird's habit of wedging nuts into cracks in tree bark and hacking at them until they break open. \\"Red-breasted\\" is a reference to the rusty colour of the male's underparts. The nuthatch's habit of wedging seeds into cracks and hammering them open has given rise to its common name. In the past, the red-breasted nuthatch and four other species ‚Äî the Corsican nuthatch, the Chinese nuthatch, the Algerian nuthatch and the Kr√ºper's nuthatch ‚Äî were thought to be a single species.Elphick, Dunning and Sibley 2001, p. 435 These five make up a well-defined species group known as the \\"Sitta canadensis group\\", and are sometimes considered to be a superspecies. Within the species group, DNA studies have shown that the red- breasted nuthatch, the Corsican nuthatch and the Chinese nuthatch make up one clade and the Algerian nuthatch and Kr√ºper's nuthatch make up a sister clade. The red-breasted nuthatch is monotypic across its extensive range.Harrap 2008, p. 136 Description The red-breasted nuthatch is a small passerine, measuring in length, with a wingspan of and a weight of . Its back and uppertail are bluish, and its underparts rust-colored. It has a black cap and eye line and a white supercilium (eyebrow). Sexes are similarly plumaged, though females and youngsters have duller heads and paler underparts. Voice The red-breasted nuthatch's call is high-pitched, nasal and weak. Transcribed as yenk or ink, they have been likened to a toy tin horn or a child's noisemaker. Its song is a slowly repeated series of clear, nasal, rising notes, transcribed as eeen eeen eeen. Habitat and range Though it is primarily a full-time resident of northern and subalpine conifer forests, the red-breasted nuthatch regularly migrates irruptively, with both the number migrating and the wintering locations varying from year to year. They sometimes reach northern Mexico, where they are rare winter visitors to Nuevo Le√≥n, Baja California Norte and south along the Pacific slope as far as Sinaloa. In the eastern United States, its range is expanding southwards. Though formerly resident on Isla Guadalupe, an island off the western coast of Mexico, it appears to have been extirpated there, with the last known record of the species on the island dating from 1971. There is a single vagrant record for Mexico's Isla Socorro. It is an extremely rare vagrant to Europe, with two records in the western Palearctic; one bird successfully overwintered in eastern England. Feeding behavior and diet Like all nuthatches, the red-breasted nuthatch is an acrobatic species, hitching itself up and down tree trunks and branches to look for food. It goes headfirst when climbing down. It can \\"walk\\" on the underside of branches. Unlike woodpeckers and creepers, it does not use its tail as a prop while climbing. It tends to forage singly or in pairs. The red-breasted nuthatch's diet changes depending on the season. In the summer, it eats mostly insects, occasionally even flycatching, while in the winter, it switches to conifer seeds. At feeders it will take sunflower seeds, peanut butter, and suet. It often wedges food pieces in bark crevices in order to break them up with the bill (as opposed to holding the food in their feet, like the black-capped chickadee does). Breeding The red-breasted nuthatch, like all nuthatches, is monogamous. The male courts the female with a peculiar display, lifting his head and tail while turning his back to her, drooping his wings, and swaying from side to side. This bird excavates its own cavity nest, above ground (usually around ). Excavation is by both sexes and takes one to eight weeks.Reed 2001, p. 436 The pair smears sap around the entrance hole, presumably to help deter predators.Reed 2001, p. 437 The nest is lined with grass, moss, shredded bark and rootlets. Nest building is by both sexes, but mostly by the female. The female lays 2‚Äì8 eggs (usually 5‚Äì6), which are white, creamy or pinkish, and covered with reddish-brown speckles. The eggs measure long by wide. Incubation is by the female and lasts 12‚Äì13 days. The young are altricial and stay in the nest for 2‚Äì3 weeks, brooded by the female but fed by both sexes. Normally there is only one brood per year. Lifespan is around 6 years. Conservation status and threats Because of its large global range and its increasing population, the red-breasted nuthatch is rated as a species of Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. In the Americas, it is protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918.

The kernel of the story lies in Orson's upbringing and wildness, and is evidently a folk-tale the connection of which with the Carolingian cycle is purely artificial. The story of the wife unjustly accused with which it is bound up is sufficiently common, and was told of the wives both of Pippin and Charlemagne. The work has a number of references to other, older, works, including: Floovant, The Four Sons of Aymon, Lion de Bourges, and Maugis d'Aigremont. Like nearly all popular romances of chivalry of the period, the French chanson de geste was adapted into a prose romance by the end of the 15th century;Authur Tilly. Studies in the French Renaissance. New York: Barnes & Noble, 1968, pp. 13, 14, 16, 17, 25. several versions from the 16th century are extant; the oldest prose version dates from 1489 (published in Lyon by Jacques Maillet). An English-language version, The Historye of the two Valyannte Brethren: Valentyne and Orson, written by Henry Watson, printed by William Copland about 1550, is the earliest known of a long series of English versions - some of which included illustrations. One such illustrated variant of the tale was prepared by S R Littlwood and accompanied by the illustrations of Florence Anderson when published in 1919. It is known that Richard Hathwaye and Anthony Munday produced a theatrical version of it in 1598. Other Renaissance versions exist in Italian, Spanish, Swedish, Dutch, German, and Icelandic. The number of translations show a European success for the tale. The works of Fran√ßois Rabelais have a number of echoes to the romance. Modern Versions and Adaptations Nancy Ekholm Burkert wrote and illustrated a version of the story in 1989, in which the story is told through the lens of a traveling group of players (including two brothers) who bring the story to a village in Flanders in the Middle Ages.

Biography Lartet was born near Castelnau-Barbarens, ' of Gers, France, where his family had lived for more than five hundred years. He was educated for the law at Auch and Toulouse, but having private means elected to devote himself to science. The then recent work of Georges Cuvier on fossil Mammalia encouraged Lartet in excavations which led in 1834 to his first discovery of fossil remains in the neighborhood of Auch.G. Bibby, The Testimony of the Spade (Fontana 1962) p. 47 For the next decade and a half, he continued to explore the geography and palaeontology of the Pyrenees, uncovering ancestral apes close to the hominid line at Sansan. In 1860, hearing of the discovery of human bones at a cave at Aurignac, and inspired by the work of William Pengelly, he turned his attention most fruitfully to the cave systems of the Dordogne.W. Bray ed., The Penguin Dictionary of Archeology (Penguin 1972) p. 129 His first publication on the subject, The Antiquity of Man in Western Europe (1860), was followed in 1861 by New Researches on the Coexistence of Man and of the Great Fossil Mammifers characteristic of the Last Geological Period. Here he revealed the results of his discoveries in the Aurignac cave, demonstrating the contemporaneous existence of man and extinct mammals. While these first results were met with some incredulity, a fellow geologist helpfully pointed Lartet towards the V√©z√®re valley in the P√©rigord district, where in 1863 he began to dig backed by the financial and personal help of Henry Christy.The Swimming Reindeer, British Museum Objects in Focus, accessed 3 August 2010, Their conjoint work was immediately to open new horizons, and served to establish a basic stratified typology of Paleolithic man which still holds good today. The important discoveries in the Abri de la Madeleine and Le Moustier provided type-sites for archaic stone-age cultures, which (from the associated fauna) Lartet linked to an early 'mammoth' phase and a late 'reindeer' phase. Lartet and Christy were also able to establish and document the presence of mobiliary art in early stratified layers,W. Bray ed., The Penguin Dictionary of Archeology (Penguin 1972) p. 129-30 further transforming the common and professional perception of early man. Such 'home' art, involving bone patternings and carvings, were associated with both the Aurignacian and the Magdalenean cultures.H. Osborne ed. The Oxford Companion to Art (London 1992) p. 1100 The account of their joint researches appeared in a paper descriptive of the Dordogne caves and contents published in Revue arch√©ologique (1864); and would eventually be published by Lartet and Christy under the title Reliquiae Aquitanicae, the first part appearing in 1865. Christy unfortunately died before the completion of the work, but Lartet continued it until the breakdown of his health in 1870. Many artefacts from their excavations are now kept in the local museum in Toulouse, as well as the British Museum in London.British Museum Collection His son Louis Lartet followed in his father's footsteps. The most modest and one of the most illustrious of the founders of modern palaeontology, Lartet's work was publicly recognized by his nomination as an officer of the L√©gion d'honneur; and in 1848 he had had the offer of a political post. In 1857 he had been elected a foreign member of the Geological Society of London, and a few weeks before his death he had been made professor of palaeontology at the museum of the Jardin des Plantes. He died at S√©issan.

The lake is 26% in Alberta and 74% in Saskatchewan. History The name in the Dene language originally referred only to the large delta formed by the confluence of the Athabasca River at the southwest corner of the lake. Prior to 1789, Sir Alexander Mackenzie explored the lake. In 1791, Philip Turnor, cartographer for the Hudson‚Äôs Bay Company, wrote in his journal, \\"low swampy ground on the South side with a few willows growing upon it, from which the Lake in general takes its name Athapison in the Southern Cree tongue which signifies open country such as lakes with willows and grass growing about them\\". Peter Fidler originally recorded the name for the river in 1790 as the Great Arabuska. By 1801, the name had gained a closer spelling to the current name‚ÄîAthapaskow Lake. By 1820, George Simpson referred to both the lake and the river as \\"Athabasca\\". Geography and natural history Lake Athabasca, Canada Mackenzie River drainage basin showing Lake Athabasca's position south of Great Slave Lake The lake covers , is long, has a maximum width of , and a maximum depth of , and holds of water, making it the largest and deepest lake in both Alberta and Saskatchewan, and the eighth largest in Canada. Water flows northward from the lake via the Slave River and Mackenzie River systems, eventually reaching the Arctic Ocean. Fort Chipewyan, one of the oldest European settlements in Alberta, is located on the western shore of the lake, where the Rivi√®re des Rochers drains the lake and flows toward Slave River, beginning its northward journey along the eastern boundary of Wood Buffalo National Park. The eastern section of the lake narrows to a width of about 1 km (.6 miles) near the community of Fond du Lac located on the northern shore then continues to its most easterly point at the mouth of the Fond du Lac River. Fidler Point on the north shore of Lake Athabasca is named for Peter Fidler, a surveyor and map maker for the Hudson's Bay Company. Along with other lakes such as the Great Bear Lake and Great Slave Lake, Lake Athabasca is a remnant of the vast Glacial Lake McConnell. = Tributaries = Tributaries of Lake Athabasca include (going clockwise); Fond du Lac River, Otherside River, Helmer Creek, MacFarlane River, Archibald River, William River, Ennuyeuse Creek, Dumville Creek, Debussac Creek, Jackfish Creek, Claussen Creek, Old Fort River, Crown Creek, Athabasca River, Colin River, Oldman River, Bulyea River, Grease River and Robillard River. Development and environment Uranium and gold mining along the northern shore resulted in the birth of Uranium City, Saskatchewan, which was home to mine workers and their families. While the last mine closed in the 1980s, the effects of mining operations had already heavily contaminated the northern shores. The large oil sands mining nearby is suspected to have added to the current pollution levels in the lake. On October31, 2013, one of Obed Mountain coal mine's pits failed, and from between 600 million to a billion liters of slurry poured into the Plante and Apetowun Creeks. The plume of waste products then joined the Athabasca River, travelling downstream for a month before settling in Lake Athabasca near Fort Chipewyan, over away. The Lake Athabasca Sand Dunes, the largest active sand dunes in the world north of 58¬∞, are adjacent to the southern shore. The dunes were designated a \\"Provincial Wilderness Park\\" in 1992. Lake Athabasca contains 23 species of fish, with a world record lake trout of caught from its depths in 1961 by means of a gillnet. Other fish species include walleye, yellow perch, northern pike, goldeye, lake whitefish, cisco, Arctic grayling, burbot, white sucker and longnose sucker.

The flight controls reverse themselves in a way that is not intuitive, so pilots may not be aware of the situation and therefore provide the wrong inputs; in order to roll to the left, for instance, they have to push the control stick to the right, the opposite of the normal direction. Causes There are several causes for this problem: pilot error, effects of high-speed flight, incorrectly connected controls, and various coupling forces on the aircraft. =Equipment malfunction= Equipment failure may cause flight controls to behave unexpectedly, for example the possible rudder reversal experienced onboard United Airlines Flight 585. =Pilot error= Pilot error is the most common cause of control reversal. In unusual attitudes it is not uncommon for the pilot to become disoriented and start feeding in incorrect control movements in order to regain level flight. This is particularly common when using helmet mounted display systems,https://corescholar.libraries.wright.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1297&context;=etd_all which introduce graphics that remain steady in the pilot's view, notably when using a particular form of attitude display known as an inside- out.https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232896204_The_Outside- In%27_Attitude_Display_Concept_Revisited =Incorrectly connected controls= Incorrectly connected controls are another common cause of this problem. It is a recurring problem after maintenance on aircraft, notably homebuilt designs that are being flown for the first time after some minor work. However it is not entirely uncommon on commercial aircraft, and has been the cause of several accidents including the crash of the Short Crusader before the 1927 Schneider Trophy and the 1947 death of Avro designer Roy Chadwick. =Wing twist= Another manifestation of the problem occurs when the amount of airflow over the wing becomes so great that the force generated by the ailerons is enough to twist the wing itself, due to insufficient torsional stiffness of the wing structure. For instance when the aileron is deflected upwards in order to make that wing move down, the wing twists in the opposite direction. The net result is that the airflow is directed down instead of up and the wing moves upward, opposite of what was expected. This form of control reversal is often lumped in with a number of \\"high speed\\" effects as compressibility. Examples =Wright Brothers glider= The Wright Brothers suffered a form of control reversal, normally referred to as adverse yaw. In their 1902 glider they continued to encounter a problem where the glider would roll in one direction but yaw in the reverse direction, then spin into the ground. They eventually cured the problem by adding a movable rudder system, now found on nearly all aircraft. The root cause of the problem was dynamic. Warping the wing did what was expected in terms of lift, thereby rolling the plane, but also had an effect on drag. The result was that the upward-moving wing was dragged backwards, yawing the glider. If this yaw was violent enough, the additional speed on the lower wing as it was driven forward would make it generate more lift, and reverse the direction of the roll. =Supermarine Spitfire= Due to the unusually high speeds at which the Supermarine Spitfire could dive, this problem of aileron reversal became apparent when it was wished to increase the lateral maneuverability (rate of roll) by increasing the aileron area. The aircraft had a wing designed originally for an aileron reversal airspeed of 580 mph, and any attempt to increase the aileron area would have resulted in the wing twisting when the larger ailerons were applied at high speed, the aircraft then rolling in the opposite direction to that intended by the pilot. The problem of increasing the rate of roll was temporarily alleviated with the introduction of \\"clipped\\" wing tips (to reduce the aerodynamic load on the tip area, allowing larger ailerons to be used) until a new, stiffer wing could be incorporated. This new wing was introduced in the Mk 21 and had a theoretical aileron reversal speed of .Jeffrey Quill OBE, AFC, FRAeS Spitfire - A Test Pilot‚Äôs Story - Arrow Books 1983-89 - =Boeing B-47= The Boeing B-47 was speed limited at low altitudes because the large, flexible wings would cancel out the effect of the control surfaces under some circumstances.http://www.skytamer.com/Boeing_B-47E.htmlhttps://history.nasa.gov/SP-468/ch12-2.htm =Gossamer Condor= Control reversal also affected the Gossamer Condor, the Kremer Prize-winning human-powered airplane. When a wing warping mechanism was tried as a solution to a long-running turning problem, the effect was to turn the airplane in the opposite direction to that expected by conventional airplane knowledge. When the Condor was rigged \\"conventionally\\", the inside wing slowed down so much that it settled to the ground. By employing \\"backwards\\" wired wing-warping, the inside wingtip angle of attack was increased so that the added drag slowed that wing while the added lift allowed the airfoil to stay aloft at a slower speed. The tilted canard could then complete the turn. External links *A320 Incident - incorrect maintenance led to reversal of the roll control on the captain's controls.

He is notable as perhaps the first person to introduce the principles of erotic alchemy to North America, and, according to A. E. Waite, establishing the earliest known Rosicrucian order in the United States.Greenfield, T. Allen (2000). Paschal Beverly Randolph: Sexual Magick in the 19th Century. Early life Born in New York City, Randolph grew up in New York City. He was a free black man, a descendant of William Randolph. His father was a nephew of John Randolph of Roanoke and his mother was Flora Beverly, whom he later described as being of mixed English, French, German, Native American and Malagasy ancestry.Deveney (1996), p. 378. His mother died when he was young, leaving him homeless and penniless; he ran away to sea in order to support himself. From his adolescence through to the age of twenty, he worked as a sailor. As a teen and young man, Randolph traveled widely, due to his work aboard sailing vessels. He journeyed to England, through Europe, and as far east as Persia, where his interest in mysticism and the occult led him to study with local practitioners of folk magic and various religions. On these travels he also met and befriended occultists in England and Paris, France. Career Returning to New York City in September 1855, after \\"a long tour in Europe and Africa,\\" he gave a public lecture to African Americans on the subject of emigrating to India. Randolph believed that \\"the Negro is destined to extinction\\" in the United States.Daily Illinois State Register (Springfield, IL), September 20, 1855, p. 2. After leaving the sea, Randolph embarked upon a public career as a lecturer and writer. By his mid-twenties, he regularly appeared on stage as a trance medium and advertised his services as a spiritual practitioner in magazines associated with Spiritualism. Like many Spiritualists of his era, he lectured in favor of the abolition of slavery; after emancipation, he taught literacy to freed slaves in New Orleans. In addition to his work as a trance medium, Randolph trained as a doctor of medicine and wrote and published both fictional and instructive books based on his theories of health, sexuality, Spiritualism and occultism. He wrote more than fifty works on magic and medicine, established an independent publishing company, and was an avid promoter of birth control during a time when it was largely against the law to mention this topic. Having long used the pseudonym \\"The Rosicrucian\\" for his Spiritualist and occult writings, Randolph eventually founded the Fraternitas Rosae Crucis in 1858, and their first lodge in San Francisco in 1861, the oldest Rosicrucian organization in the United States, which dates back to the era of the American Civil War. This group, still in existence, today avoids mention of Randolph's interest in sex magic, but his magico-sexual theories and techniques formed the basis of much of the teachings of another occult fraternity, the Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor, although it is not clear that Randolph himself was ever personally associated with the Brotherhood.Godwin et al., 1995. Randolph was the principal of the Lloyd Garrison School in New Orleans when on October 14, 1865, he wrote to Garrison in Boston requesting assistance for his school.The Liberator, November 10, 1865. Belief and teaching Randolph described himself as a Rosicrucian. He had worked \\"largely alone\\", producing \\"his own synthesis\\" of \\"esoteric teachings\\". The manner in which Randolph incorporated sex into his occult system was considered uncharacteristically bold for the period in which he lived. Pre-Adamism Randolph was a believer in pre-Adamism (the belief that humans existed on earth before the biblical Adam) and wrote the book Pre- Adamite Man: demonstrating the existence of the human race upon the earth 100,000 thousand years ago! under the name of Griffin Lee in 1863. His book was a unique contribution towards pre-Adamism because it wasn't strictly based on biblical grounds. Randolph used a wide range of sources to write his book from many different world traditions, esoterica and ancient religions. Randolph traveled to many countries of the world where he wrote different parts of his book. In the book he claims that Adam was not the first man and that pre-Adamite men existed on all continents around the globe 35,000 years to 100,000 years ago. His book was different from many of the other writings from other pre-Adamite authors because in Randolph's book he claims the pre- Adamites were civilised men while other pre-Adamite authors argued that the pre-Adamites were beasts or hominids.Paschal Beverly Randolph, Pre-Adamite Man: demonstrating the existence of the human race upon the earth 100,000 thousand years ago!, 1863. Personal life A peripatetic man, he lived in many places, including New York State, New Orleans, San Francisco, and Toledo, Ohio. He married his first wife, Mary Jane (born approximately 1834 in Utica), in 1850; she was African-American (or possibly mixed-race). Together, they had three children, only one of whom (Cora, born 1854) survived to adulthood. They owned a farm in Stockbridge, New York during the 1850s, but sold it in April 1860 for one dollar. They later lived in Utica, New York, where Mary Jane worked as \\"a healer and dispenser of Native american remedies,\\" in addition to helping Paschal publish and sell several books. They divorced in January 1864. Later in life he married his second wife, Kate Corson (1855-1938), an Irish- American woman, with whom he had one child, Osiris Budh (or Buddha) Randolph (1874-1929). Corson acted as a medium and a seer in collaboration with Randolph, and published several of his books, but their relationship appears to have been conflicted for its duration. He is reported to have discovered that she was having an affair shortly before his apparent death by suicide in 1875. After his death, Corson Randolph continued publishing his works under the Randolph Publishing Company imprint until the early 1900s. Death Randolph died in Toledo, Ohio, at the age of 49, under disputed circumstances. According to biographer Carl Edwin Lindgren, many questioned the newspaper article \\"By His Own Hand\\" that appeared in The Toledo Daily Blade. According to this article, Randolph had died from a self-inflicted wound to the head. However, many of his writings express his aversion to suicide. R. Swinburne Clymer, a later Supreme Master of the Fraternitas, stated that years after Randolph's demise, in a death-bed confession, a former friend of Randolph had conceded that in a state of jealousy and temporary insanity, he had killed Randolph. Lucus County Probate Court records list the death as accidental. Randolph was succeeded as Supreme Grand Master of the Fraternitas, and in other titles, by his chosen successor Freeman B. Dowd. Influence and legacy Randolph influenced both the Theosophical Society and‚Äîto a greater degree‚Äîthe Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor. In 1994, the historian Joscelyn Godwin noted that Randolph had been largely neglected by historians of esotericism. In 1996, a biography was published, Paschal Beverly Randolph: A Nineteenth-Century Black American Spiritualist, Rosicrucian, and Sex Magician by John Patrick Deveney and Franklin Rosemont.  Published works  Randolph also edited the Leader (Boston) and the Messenger of Light (New York) between 1852 and 1861 and wrote for the Journal of Progress and Spiritual Telegraph .Lindgren 1996 It is also attributed to Randolph \\"Affectional Alchemy and How It Works\\" (c. 1870). 1 under the pseudonym \\"Griffin Lee\\". 2 as anonymous. 3 under the pseudonym \\"Count de St. Leon\\".

It was the first treaty between the United States of America and Tripoli (now Libya) to secure commercial shipping rights and protect American ships in the Mediterranean Sea from local Barbary pirates. It was authored by Joel Barlow, an ardent Jeffersonian republican, and signed in Tripoli on November 4, 1796, and at Algiers (for a third-party witness) on January 3, 1797. It was ratified by the United States Senate unanimously without debate on June 7, 1797, taking effect June 10, 1797, with the signature of President John Adams. The Treaty is often cited, in discussions regarding the role of religion in United States government, for a clause in Article 11 of the English language American version which states that \\"the Government of the United States of America is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion.\\" The treaty was broken by Tripoli and after the First Barbary War a superseding treaty, the Treaty of Peace and Amity, was signed on July 4, 1805. Barbary pirates For three centuries up to the time of the Treaty, the Mediterranean Sea lanes had been preyed on by the North African Muslim states of the Barbary Coast (Tripoli, Algiers, Morocco and Tunis) through privateering (government-sanctioned piracy). Hostages captured by the Barbary pirates were either ransomed or forced into slavery, contributing to the greater Ottoman slave trade (of which the Barbary states were a segment). Life for the captives often was harsh, especially for Christian captives, and many died from their treatment. Some captives \\"went Turk\\", that is, converted to Islam, a choice that made life in captivity easier for them. Before the American Revolution (1775-1783), the British colonies in North America were protected from the Barbary pirates by British warships of the Royal Navy and treaties. During the Revolution, the Kingdom of France formed an alliance with the former British colonies in 1778, now the proclaimed independent United States of America and assumed the responsibility of providing protection of U.S. merchant ships in the Mediterranean and eastern Atlantic Ocean against the Barbary pirates by the French Navy. After the Revolutionary War ended and the new United States won its independence with the signing of the Treaty of Paris (1783), it had to face the threat of the Barbary pirates on its own. Two American ships were captured by Algerian pirates in July 1785 and the survivors forced into slavery, their ransom set at $60,000. A rumor that Benjamin Franklin, who was en route from France to Philadelphia about that time, had been captured by Barbary pirates, caused considerable upset in the U.S.David McCullough, John Adams (Simon & Schuster Paperbacks), 2001, p. 352. With the disbanding of the former Continental Navy and the selling of its last warship by the Confederation Congress in 1785, now without a standing navy, much less a navy capable of projecting force across an ocean, the U.S. was forced to pay tribute monies and goods to the Barbary nations for the security of its ships and the freedom of its captured citizens. As Lieutenant and consul William Eaton informed newly appointed Secretary of State John Marshall in 1800, \\"It is a maxim of the Barbary States, that 'The Christians who would be on good terms with them must fight well or pay well.'\\" (principally collected from his correspondence and other manuscripts) Soon after the formation of the United States, privateering in the Mediterranean Sea and the eastern Atlantic Ocean from the nations of the Barbary Coast prompted the U.S. to initiate a series of so-called peace treaties, collectively known as the Barbary Treaties. Individual treaties were negotiated with Morocco (1786), Algiers (1795), Tripoli (1797) and Tunis (1797), all of them more than once. The United States consul-general to the Barbary states of Algiers, Tripoli and Tunis was Joel Barlow, who dealt with the text of various treaties (including the Treaty of Tripoli) and supported U.S. diplomatic efforts on the Barbary Coast. Commissioner Plenipotentiary (and Minister to the Kingdom of Spain in Madrid) of the United States, David Humphreys, was given the right to establish a treaty with Tripoli and assigned Joel Barlow and Joseph Donaldson to broker it. It was Joel Barlow who certified the signatures on the Arabic original and the English copy provided to him. Later, Captain Richard O'Brien, USN established the original transport of the negotiated goods along with the Treaty, but it was the American Consul James Leander Cathcart who delivered the final requirements of payment for the treaty. Signing and ratification The first U.S. President, George Washington, appointed his old colleague David Humphreys as Commissioner Plenipotentiary on March 30, 1795, in order to negotiate a treaty with the Barbary powers.Frank Landon Humphreys, Life and times of David Humphreys: soldier--statesman--poet, \\"belov'd of Washington,\\", Volume 2 (1917) ch 11 full text online On February 10, 1796, Humphreys appointed Joel Barlow and Joseph Donaldson as \\"Junior Agents\\" to forge a \\"Treaty of Peace and Friendship\\". Under Humphreys' authority, the treaty was signed at Tripoli on November 4, 1796, and certified at Algiers on January 3, 1797. Humphreys reviewed the treaty and approved it in Lisbon on February 10, 1797. the Bey and Subjects of Tripoli of Barbary, written in Arabic, signed 4 November 1796. The official treaty was in Arabic, and a translated version by Consul-General Barlow was ratified by the United States on June 10, 1797. Article 11 of the treaty was said to have not been part of the original Arabic version of the treaty; in its place is a letter from the Dey of Algiers to the Pasha of Tripoli. However, it is the English text which was ratified by Congress. Miller says, \\"the Barlow translation is that which was submitted to the Senate (American State Papers, Foreign Relations, II, 18-19) and which is printed in the Statutes at Large and in treaty collections generally; it is that English text which in the United States has always been deemed the text of the treaty.\\"Hunter Miller, ed. \\"Treaties and Other International Acts of the United States of America.\\" Volume 2. Washington: Government Printing Office, 1931. http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/bar1796n.asp#n4 The Treaty had spent seven months traveling from Tripoli to Algiers to Portugal and, finally westward across the North Atlantic Ocean, to the United States, and had been signed by officials at each stop along the way. There is no record of discussion or debate of the Treaty of Tripoli at the time that it was ratified. However, there is a statement made by President John Adams on the document that reads: President Adams' signing statement > Now be it known, That I John Adams, President of the United States of > America, having seen and considered the said Treaty do, by and with the > advice and consent of the Senate, accept, ratify, and confirm the same, and > every clause and article thereof. And to the End that the said Treaty may be > observed, and performed with good Faith on the part of the United States, I > have ordered the premises to be made public; And I do hereby enjoin and > require all persons bearing office civil or military within the United > States, and all other citizens or inhabitants thereof, faithfully to observe > and fulfill the said Treaty and every clause and article thereof. Official records show that after President John Adams sent the treaty to the U.S. Senate for ratification in May 1797, the entire treaty was read aloud on the Senate floor, and copies were printed for every Senator. A committee considered the treaty and recommended ratification. Twenty-three of the thirty-two sitting Senators were present for the June 7th vote which unanimously approved the ratification recommendation. However, before anyone in the United States saw the Treaty, its required payments, in the form of goods and money, had been made in part. As Barlow declared: \\"The present writing done by our hand and delivered to the American Captain O'Brien makes known that he has delivered to us forty thousand Spanish dollars,-thirteen watches of gold, silver & pinsbach,-five rings, of which three of diamonds, one of saphire and one with a watch in it, One hundred & forty piques of cloth, and four caftans of brocade,-and these on account of the peace concluded with the Americans.\\" However, this was an incomplete amount of goods stipulated under the treaty (according to the Pasha of Tripoli) and an additional $18,000 had to be paid by the American Consul James Leander Cathcart at his arrival on April 10, 1799. It was not until these final goods were delivered that the Pasha of Tripoli recognized the Treaty as official. In Treaties and Other International Acts of the United States of America by David Hunter Miller, which is regarded as an authoritative collection of international agreements of the United States between 1776 and 1937, , . Hunter Miller describes, \\"While the original ratification remained in the hands of Cathcart ... it is possible that a copy thereof was delivered upon the settlement of April 10, 1799, and further possible that there was something almost in the nature of an exchange of ratifications of the treaty on or about April 10, 1799, the day of the agreed settlement.\\" It is then that the Pasha declares in a Letter to John Adams on April 15, 1799, \\"Whereby we have consummated the Peace which shall, on our side, be inviolate, provided You are Willing to treat us as You do other Regencies, without any difference being made between Us. Which is the whole of what We have, at present, to say to You, wishing you at the same time the most unlimited prosperity.\\" =Article 11= Article 11 has been and is a point of contention in popular culture disputes on the doctrine of separation of church and state as it applies to the founding principles of the United States. Some religious spokesmen claim that‚Äîdespite unanimous ratification by the U.S. Senate of the text in English which contained ‚Äîthe page containing Article 11 is missing from the Arabic version of the treaty. The contemporaneous purpose of Article 11 was to make clear that the United States was a secular state and to reassure the Muslims that the agreement was not with an extension of earlier Christian nations that took part in the Crusades. Article 11 Article 11 reads: > Art. 11. As the Government of the United States of America is not, in any > sense, founded on the Christian religion; as it has in itself no character > of enmity against the laws, religion, or tranquility, of Mussulmen > (Muslims); and as the said States never entered into any war or act of > hostility against any Mahometan (Mohammedan) nation, it is declared by the > parties that no pretext arising from religious opinions shall ever produce > an interruption of the harmony existing between the two countries. According to Frank Lambert, Professor of History at Purdue University, the assurances in Article 11 were \\"intended to allay the fears of the Muslim state by insisting that religion would not govern how the treaty was interpreted and enforced. John Adams and the Senate made clear that the pact was between two sovereign states, not between two religious powers.\\" Lambert writes, > By their actions, the Founding Fathers made clear that their primary concern > was religious freedom, not the advancement of a state religion. Individuals, > not the government, would define religious faith and practice in the United > States. Thus the Founders ensured that in no official sense would America be > a Christian Republic. Ten years after the Constitutional Convention ended > its work, the country assured the world that the United States was a secular > state, and that its negotiations would adhere to the rule of law, not the > dictates of the Christian faith. The assurances were contained in the Treaty > of Tripoli of 1797 and were intended to allay the fears of the Muslim state > by insisting that religion would not govern how the treaty was interpreted > and enforced. John Adams and the Senate made clear that the pact was between > two sovereign states, not between two religious powers. The treaty was printed in the Philadelphia Gazette and two New York papers, with only scant public dissent, most notably from William Cobbett. =Later dissent= A prominent member of Adams' cabinet, Secretary of War James McHenry, claimed that he protested the language of Article 11 before its ratification. He wrote to Secretary of the Treasury Oliver Wolcott, Jr., September 26, 1800: \\"The Senate, my good friend, and I said so at the time, ought never to have ratified the treaty alluded to, with the declaration that 'the government of the United States, is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion.' What else is it founded on? This act always appeared to me like trampling upon the cross. I do not recollect that Barlow was even reprimanded for this outrage upon the government and religion.\\"\\"Letter from James McHenry to John Adams,\\" in Memoirs of the Administrations of Washington and John Adams: Edited from the Papers of Oliver Wolcott, Secretary of the Treasury, Volume 2, ed. George Gibbs, William Van Norden, Printer, 1846. p.421. =Translation and Article 11= Miller's Investigation and Notes The translation of the Treaty of Tripoli by Barlow has been questioned, and it has been disputed whether Article 11 in the English version of the treaty ratified by the U.S. Senate corresponds to anything of the same purport in the Arabic version.Christiaan Snouck Hurgronje, translation of Arabic text of treaty (1930), via Avalon Project (some OCR errors)- accessed 2008-12-06 In 1931 Hunter Miller completed a commission by the United States government to analyze United States' treaties and to explain how they function and what they mean to the United States' legal position in relationship with the rest of the world.His work on the Treaty of Tripoli can be found in Volume Two of . According to Hunter Miller's notes, \\"the Barlow translation is at best a poor attempt at a paraphrase or summary of the sense of the Arabic\\" and \\"Article 11 ... does not exist at all.\\" After comparing the United States' version by Barlow with the Arabic and the Italian version, Miller continues by claiming that: > The Arabic text which is between Articles 10 and 12 is in form a letter, > crude and flamboyant and withal quite unimportant, from the Dey of Algiers > to the Pasha of Tripoli. How that script came to be written and to be > regarded, as in the Barlow translation, as Article 11 of the treaty as there > written, is a mystery and seemingly must remain so. Nothing in the > diplomatic correspondence of the time throws any light whatever on the > point. From this, Miller concludes: \\"A further and perhaps equal mystery is the fact that since 1797 the Barlow translation has been trustfully and universally accepted as the just equivalent of the Arabic ... yet evidence of the erroneous character of the Barlow translation has been in the archives of the Department of State since perhaps 1800 or thereabouts ...\\" However, as Miller noted: > It is to be remembered that the Barlow translation is that which was > submitted to the Senate (American State Papers, Foreign Relations, II, > 18-19) and which is printed in the Statutes at Large and in treaty > collections generally; it is that English text which in the United States > has always been deemed the text of the treaty. However the Arabic and English texts differ, the Barlow translation (Article 11 included) was the text presented by the President and ratified unanimously in 1797 by the U.S. Senate following strict Constitutional procedures. According to the American legal scholar Francis Wharton the original document was framed by an ex-Congregational preacher.Schaff, Philip. (1888). \\"Church and state in the United States, or, the American idea of religious liberty and its practical effects : with official documents.\\" 1972 reprint. Series: Religion in America, 2. New York: Arno Press. p. 41. . Barbary wars The treaty was broken in 1801 by Yusuf Karamanli, the Pasha of Tripoli, over President Thomas Jefferson's refusal to submit to the Pasha's demands for increased payments. Through subsequent battles, Tripoli eventually agreed to terms of peace with the United States. Tobias Lear negotiated a second \\"Treaty of Peace and Amity\\" with the Pasha Yusuf on June 4, 1805. To the dismay of many Americans, the new settlement included a ransom of $60,000 (equal to $ today) paid for the release of prisoners from the USS Philadelphia and several U.S. merchant ships. By 1807, Algiers had gone back to taking U.S. ships and seamen hostage. Distracted by the preludes to the War of 1812 and the war itself, the United States was unable to respond to the provocations until 1815, with the Second Barbary War, thereby concluding the First and the Second Barbary Wars (1800‚Äì1815).

A parody of Phryne before the Areopagus, an 1861 painting by French artist Jean-L√©on G√©r√¥me The Mugwumps were Republican political activists in the United States who switched parties from the Republican Party by supporting Democratic candidate Grover Cleveland in the presidential election of 1884. They switched because they rejected the financial corruption associated with Republican candidate James G. Blaine. In a close election, the Mugwumps supposedly made the difference in New York state and swung the election to Cleveland. The jocular word \\"mugwump\\", noted as early as 1832, is from Algonquian mugquomp, \\"important person, kingpin\\" (from mugumquomp, \\"war leader\\"),On-line Etymological Dictionary; The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology. 1996 implying that they were \\"sanctimonious\\" or \\"holier-than-thou\\"The American Pageant: A History of the Republic, Thirteenth Edition. Advanced Placement edition in holding themselves aloof from party politics. After the election, \\"mugwump\\" survived for more than a decade as an epithet for a party bolter in American politics. Many Mugwumps became Democrats or remained independents and most continued to support reform well into the 20th century.Tucker (1998) During the Third Party System, party loyalty was in high regard and independents were rare. Theodore Roosevelt stunned his upper class New York City friends by supporting Blaine in 1884; by rejecting the Mugwumps, he kept alive his Republican party leadership, clearing the way for his own political aspirations.Henry F. Pringle, Theodore Roosevelt: A Biography. (1931) p. 88. New England and the Northeast had been a stronghold of the Republican Party since the Civil War era, but the Mugwumps considered Blaine to be an untrustworthy and fraudulent candidate. Their idealism and reform sensibilities led them to oppose the political corruption in the politics of the Gilded Age.Summers (2000)  Patronage and politics  The Mugwumps were Republicans who refused to support Republican presidential candidate James G. Blaine in 1884 Political patronage, also known as the spoils system, was the issue that angered many reform-minded Republicans, leading them to reject Blaine's candidacy. In the spoils system, the winning candidate would dole out government positions to those who had supported his political party prior to the election. Although the Pendleton Act of 1883 established the United States Civil Service Commission and made competency and merit the base qualifications for government positions, its effective implementation was slow. Political affiliation continued to be the basis for appointment to many positions.Hoogenboom (1961) In the early 1880s, the issue of political patronage split the Republican Party down the middle for several consecutive sessions of Congress. The party was divided into two warring factions, each with creative names. The side that held the upper hand in numbers and popular support were the Half-Breeds, led by Senator James Blaine of Maine. The Half- Breeds supported civil service reform and often blocked legislation and political appointments put forth by their main congressional opponents, the Stalwarts, led by Roscoe Conkling of New York. Blaine was from the reform wing of his own party, but the Mugwumps rejected his candidacy. This division among Republicans may have contributed to the victory in 1884 of Grover Cleveland, the first President elected from the Democratic party since the Civil War. In the period from 1876 to 1892, presidential elections were closely contested at the national level, but the states themselves were mostly dominated by a single party, with Democrats prevailing in the South and the Republicans in the Northeast. Although the defection of the Mugwumps may have helped Cleveland win in New York, one of the few closely contested states, historians attribute Cleveland's victory nationwide to the rising power of urban immigrant voters.

Puck and the figure representing \\"The Independent Party\\" are watching from a window in the background. Several historians of the 1960s and 1970s portrayed the Mugwumps as members of an insecure elite, one that felt threatened by changes in American society. These historians often focused on the social background and status of their subjects and the narratives they have written share a common outlook.Blodgett (1966) Mugwumps tended to come from old Protestant families of New York and New England and often from inherited wealth. They belonged to or identified with the emerging business and professional elite and were often members of the most exclusive clubs. Yet they felt threatened by the rise of machine politics, one aspect of which was the spoils system; and by the rising power of immigrants in American society. They excelled as authors and essayists, yet their writings indicated their social position and class loyalties. In politics, they tended to be ineffectual and unsuccessful, unable and unwilling to operate effectively in a political environment where patronage was the norm. In his 1998 work, historian David Tucker attempts to rehabilitate the Mugwumps. According to Tucker, the Mugwumps embodied the liberalism of the 19th century and their rejection by 20th-century historians, who embraced the government intervention of the New Deal and the Great Society, is not surprising. To Tucker, their eloquent writings speak for themselves and are testament to a high minded civic morality. During the 2017 United Kingdom general election, Conservative Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson by writing in The Sun accused Labour Party Leader Jeremy Corbyn of being a threat to the United Kingdom and described him as a \\"mutton-headed old mugwump\\". Charles Anderson Dana  Etymology  Dictionaries report that \\"mugguomp\\" is an Algonquian word meaning \\"person of importance\\" or \\"war leader\\". Charles Anderson Dana, the colorful newspaperman and editor of the now-defunct New York Sun, is said to have given the Mugwumps their political moniker. Dana made the term plural and derided them as amateurs and public moralists.Sperber and Trittschuh, pp. 276‚Äì67 During the 1884 campaign, they were often portrayed as \\"fence-sitters\\", with part of their body on the side of the Democrats and the other on the side of the Republicans. Their \\"mug\\" on one side of the fence, and their \\"wump\\" [comic mispronunciation of \\"rump\\"] on the other. Angry Republicans like Roscoe Conkling sometimes hinted they were homosexual, calling them \\"man milliners\\".Allan Nevins, Grover Cleveland p. 178; Muzzey, Blaine p. 160 The epithet \\"goody-goody\\" from the 1890s goo-goo, a corruption of \\"good government\\", was used in a similar derogatory manner. Whereas \\"mugwump\\" has become an obscure and almost forgotten political moniker, \\"goo- goo\\" was revived, especially in Chicago, by the political columns of Mike Royko.Sperber and Trittschuh, pp. 173‚Äì74.

He was the father of Albert, Prince Consort, who was the husband of Queen Victoria. Ernest fought against Napoleon Bonaparte, and through construction projects and the establishment of a court theatre, he left a strong imprint on his residence town, Coburg. Early life Ernest was the eldest son of Francis, Duke of Saxe-Coburg- Saalfeld, and Countess Augusta of Reuss-Ebersdorf. His youngest brother, Leopold Georg Christian Frederick, was later elected the first King of the Belgians. On 10 May 1803, aged 19, Ernest was proclaimed an adult because his father had become gravely ill, and he was required to take part in the government of the duchy. When his father died in 1806, he succeeded in the duchy of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld as Ernest III. However, he could not immediately take over the formal government of his lands, because the duchy was occupied by Napoleonic troops and was under French administration. The following year, after the Peace of Tilsit (1807), the duchy of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld was reunited (having previously been dissolved) and restored to Ernest. This occurred through Russian pressure, since his sister Juliane was married to the brother of the Russian Tsar. Marriages and children Ernest married Princess Louise of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg in Gotha on 3 July 1817. They had two children: *Ernest II, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (21 June 181822 August 1893), who married Princess Alexandrine of Baden on 3 May 1842. *Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (26 August 181914 December 1861), who married Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom on 10 February 1840. They had nine children. The marriage was unhappy because both husband and wife were promiscuous. As the biographer Lytton Strachey put it: \\"The ducal court was not noted for the strictness of its morals; the Duke was a man of gallantry, and the Duchess followed her husband's example. There were scandals: one of the Court Chamberlains, a charming and cultivated man of Jewish extraction, was talked of; at last there was a separation, followed by a divorce.\\"Strachey, Lytton (1921). Queen Victoria. London: Chatto and Windus. pp. 97‚Äì98 Ernest and Louise were separated in 1824 and were officially divorced on 31 March 1826. As heirs to Coburg, the children remained with their father. Seven months after the divorce, in October 1826, Louise secretly married one of her lovers. She died in 1831. In Coburg on 23 December 1832, Ernest married his niece Duchess Marie of W√ºrttemberg, the daughter of his sister Antoinette. They had no children. This marriage made Marie both Prince Albert's first cousin and his stepmother. Ernest had three illegitimate children: * Berta Ernestine von Schauenstein (26 January 1817Coburg, 15 August 1896), born to Sophie Fermepin de Marteaux. She married her first cousin Eduard Edgar Schmidt-L√∂we von L√∂wenfels, the illegitimate son of her father's sister, Juliane. * Ernst Albert and Robert Ferdinand, twins born in 1838 to Margaretha Braun. They were created Freiherren von Bruneck in 1856.  Estates  After 1813, Ernest was a Prussian general and participated in military actions against Napoleon. He fought in the battles of L√ºtzen and Leipzig (1813), and drew in 1814 into the French fortress of Mainz. After the battle of Leipzig, he commanded the 5. Armeekorps. After the defeat of Napoleon in the Battle of Waterloo, the Congress of Vienna on 9 June 1815 gave him an area of 450 square kilometres with 25,000 inhabitants around the town of St. Wendel. Its area was somewhat augmented by the second Treaty of Paris. In 1816, this estate received the name of Principality of Lichtenberg. Ernest sold it to Prussia in 1834. In 1825, Frederick IV, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg, who was the uncle of Ernest's first wife Louise, died without an heir. This resulted in a rearrangement of the Ernestine duchies. It was only as a member of the Ernestine dynasty (and not as Louise's husband) that Ernest had a claim on the late duke's estates. However, he was at that time in the process of divorcing Louise, and the other branches used this as a leverage to drive a better bargain for themselves by insisting that he should not inherit Gotha. They reached a compromise on 12 November 1826: Ernest received Gotha, but had to cede Saalfeld to Saxe-Meiningen. He subsequently became \\"Ernest I, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha\\". Although he had given a constitution to Gotha in 1821, he did not interfere in the system of government in Gotha. At Coburg, Ernest was responsible for various construction projects, including the establishment of the Hoftheater in its new building. The Schlossplatz as it appears today is largely due to work under his rule. He is chiefly remembered for the economic, educational and constitutional development of his territories, and for the significant international position attained by the house of Coburg. Death and burial Ernest died on 29 January 1844 and was initially buried in the Morizkirche but later reinterred in the newly built mausoleum in '.

Block grants have less oversight from the federal government and provide flexibility to each state in terms of designing and implementing programs. Block grants, categorical grants, and general revenue sharing are three types of federal government grants-in-aid programs.A block grant differs from a categorical grant, in that the latter has stricter and more specific provisions on the how it is to be spent. Block grants (United States) Through a block grant program for Medicaid, for example, each state would receive a set amount of money from the federal government. The block grants can be set based on \\"per capita\\" or on the needs of the state. Each state has to fill any funding gap if there is a difference between their spending and the amount set by the federal government. Block grants are the topic of debate in the United States. According to the 2014 Congressional Research Service (CRS) advocates, who would like to see Medicaid converted into a block grant, say that block grants assist in reducing the federal deficit, increase government efficiency, redistribute power, improve accountability, and allow for flexibility. Critics, who are specifically against converting Medicaid into block grants, say that block grant \\"undermine the achievement of national objectives\\", \\"reduce government spending on domestic issues\\" where, for example, the \\"most vulnerable seniors, individuals with disabilities, and low-income children\\" would lose their health care through deep cuts in Medicaid. Critics also say that because block grants are decentralized, it is more challenging to \\"measure block grant performance and to hold state and local government officials accountable for their decisions\\". In February 2017, the national debate in the United States regarding the effectiveness of block grants intensified as the United States Congress decided whether to convert Medicaid to a block grant program. According to a January 11, 2019 Politico article, the Trump Administration was creating new guidelines to overhaul Medicaid in order to reduce health care costs for the poor through block grants, bypassing Congress. According to the same article, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Administrator Seema Verma had mentioned using CMS' authority to \\"pursue block grants during a meeting with state Medicaid directors in the fall\\" of 2018. Verma promotes block grants but she has \\"faced heavy scrutiny\\" from CMS lawyers in her attempts to \\"insert block grant language into federal guidance.\\" =Background= The 2014 Congressional Research Service (CRS) report says the first true block grant was in 1966. In 1949, first Hoover Commission's 1949 report recommended the creation of \\"a system of grants\\" based \\"upon broad categories‚Äîsuch as highways, education, public assistance, and public health‚Äîas contrasted with the present system of extensive fragmentation.\\" The Eisenhower Administration (1953 ‚Äì 1961) created \\"block grants in the health and public welfare fields\\". In the 1950s, the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) was able to consolidate \\"child health and welfare, vocational education, and vocational rehabilitation areas\\" into block grants for public health. But most proposals for block grants repeatedly met rejection in the 1950s. Reasons included a political misalignment between federal and state levels, concerns about a lack or reduction of federal controls, and that giving states wider latitude in spending would be a \\"more effective and efficient use of public funds.\\" In the late 1960s, with both Congress and the White House under control of the Democratic Party, Congress enacted the 1966 Partnership for Health Act and the 1968 Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (Safe Streets Act). In a March 16, 2017 New England Journal of Medicine article, the authors provided background on health care provisions for the poor in the 1950s and 1960s. Prior to the creation of Medicaid in 1965, health providers were reimbursed directly on a per-capita basis.There was a cap on the amount of money available, which is similar to the block grants proposed by the Republicans in 2017. See Carroll (2107). When the cap was spent, states were responsible for cutting health costs to make up the difference by restricting who, what and how much care one could access. As a result, only 3.4 million people in the US were able to access these benefits in the 1960s before Medicaid.compared to 81 million in 2017. See Carroll (2107) According to an October 1977 U.S. Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations report, local government officials compared to federal government officials are \\"closer to the people\\" and therefore better able to identify local needs. According to the ACIR report, advocates say block grants allow local governments to experiment with new approaches to solving various problems that other state and local officials can learn from. Such innovation would not be possible if funding were provided through restrictive categorical grants. During the Nixon Administration (1969 ‚Äì 1974) a new strategy, called \\"special revenue sharing\\" was developed and implemented from 1972 to 1986, to replace block grants. Through revenue sharing, the United States Congress appropriated federal tax revenue to share with states, cities, counties and townships. According to The New York Times, in FY 1986 the year before revenue sharing was eliminated by the Reagan administration, the federal government \\"distributed $4.5 billion to 39,000 municipalities\\".The New York Times reported on January 31, 1987, that \\"The elimination of the program of general revenue sharing on September 30, 1986 after several years of significant cuts in other Federal aid, has prompted layoffs, curtailment of police protection and other services, and higher taxes and user fees in thousands of counties, cities and villages.\\" Revenue sharing lost federal support under Reagan and was replaced by block grants in smaller amounts in 1987. The 1981 Community Services Block Grant under President Reagan consolidated 77 existing anti-poverty grants into nine new block grants with a budget representing c.25% less than the programs they replaced. According to the General Accounting Office, from 1980 to 2001, the number of federal block grant programs went from 450 to 700. The grants were aimed at a wide range of activities from education to healthcare, transportation, housing and counterterrorism. In 1996, HHS and education moved towards \\"nationalizing trends\\", there was an attempt made towards devolution of welfare policy. In 1996, Congress \\"replaced Aid to Families with Dependent Children with the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant\\". The Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations (ACIR), which provided federal intergovernmental expertise, \\"played an important role in the design and creation of a host of intergovernmental policy initiatives, including block grants. ACIR was eliminated in 1996. According to a 2017 CBPP study, since 2000, funding for the 13 major low-income health, housing, and social services block grants has fallen by 37%, after adjusting for inflation and population growth. This sharp reduction in funding can be attributed to the basic structure of block grants. Since block grants are designed to give local governments broad flexibility over their use of federal funds, recipients can turn these grants into savings, or spend them on other matters. As a result, it is often difficult to track in detail how these funds are being used, and what greater impact they have, thus making block grants very vulnerable to funding reductions or freezes. In 2003, under the state Homeland Security Grant Program and Critical Infrastructure Protection, the least populous state, Wyoming received $17.5 million and the most populous state, California, received $164 million. In fiscal year 2004, Wyoming was guaranteed to receive at least $15 million, California $133 million. Wyoming thus received $35.3 per person, California only $4.7 per person. The formulas for how much money states receive favors small states. Most grant programs have a minimum amount per state, usually 0.5% or 0.75% of the total money given to states in the program. Similar patterns exist for other block grant formulas. An analysis exists in the book Sizing Up the Senate. Additionally, individual states may provide block grants to their political subdivisions, such as counties, towns, and school districts. Despite the various theoretical arguments in favor of block grants, existing research has mainly found that block grants are generally ineffective in achieving policy goals. According to a 2004 book entitled Block Grants: Details of the Bush Proposals, critics of block grants argued that the flexibility block grant programs gave to local governments diminished the ability of federal administrators to evaluate the effectiveness of these programs, especially given that there were often no federal requirements for uniform program data collection across states. Opponents also said that the lack of restriction regarding where local officials spend block grant funding would enable them to retarget resources away from communities with the greatest need, to communities with the greatest political influence. Block grant critics said that the funding for block grants was prone to diminish over time because it was more difficult to regenerate political support for broad-purpose, state-run programs, than for categorical programs focusing on specific purposes. The budget for FY 2005 under President Bush budget converted many federal programs into block grants to save $1.8 billion. Eighteen community development block grant programs were consolidated into one Commerce Department program. In 2009, Carl Stenberg wrote that block grants \\"could contribute a greater degree of flexibility to the intergovernmental system, but their potential [was] often overstated and difficult to realize.\\" He said that there was no empirical evidence that block grants reduce administrative costs as these costs were transferred from the federal government to the recipient states. According to a 2013 Center for American Progress, from 2008 through 2013, categorical grant funding decreased for 29 out of 50 states as did block grants. According to a 2009 U.S. Office of Management and Budget report, in 2008 block grants received the lowest average score based on the Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART), a set of questionnaires developed by the George W. Bush Administration to assess the efficacy of various federal funding programs. Out of the seven PART program types in 2008, 30% of block grant programs were rated \\"results not demonstrated\\", and 5% were rated \\"ineffective\\". Block grant advocates said that PART's strong weighting of program results in its calculations make it a poor measure for evaluating block grant performance. While PART examines how programs achieve a single outcome, many block grant programs contain multiple outcomes which are often contradictory to each other, and thus the overall impact of block grants may be underestimated. A 2014 Congressional Research Service (CRS) report entitled \\"Block Grants: Perspectives and Controversies\\" said that there were \\"21 funded block grants, totaling about $50.8 billion in FY2014\\" which represented \\"less than 10% of total federal grant-in-aid assistance.\\" The CRS report provided arguments for both side of the debate on the use of block grants. Those who support block grants, say that they were more cost-effective because they reduce federal administrative costs related to state and local government paperwork requirements. According to a June 2015 Center on Budget and Policy Priorities report, the amount of basic assistance that block grants provide has also fallen, as local governments spend their federal funds on other purposes. For example, in 2015, only half of the funds received from the TANF (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) block grant were spent on core welfare reform activities such as cash assistance, work activities, and child care. The rest of the funds were spent on a variety of different matters unrelated to the program. The CBPP study said that, \\"Unlike block grants, entitlement programs such as Medicaid and SNAP are highly responsive to changes in need. They grow immediately and automatically when need rises. This growth is critically important during recessions...Programs like Medicaid and SNAP would lose this responsiveness if turned into block grants.\\"  Graphical representation  When Town A is offered a block grant of $375,000, the budget constraint shifts outwards from AB to CD. Town A chooses point Y on CD, as it spends $75,000 more on education and $300,000 more on private goods. The figure demonstrates the impact of an education block grant on a town's budget constraint. According to microeconomic theory, the grant shifts the town's budget constraint outwards, enabling the town to spend more on both education and other goods, due to the income effect. While this increases the town's utility, it does not maximize the town's spending on education. Therefore, if the goal of a grant program is to encourage spending on a particular good, a categorical grant may be more effective in achieving this goal than a block grant, as most block grant critics would argue. Other countries = Denmark = Greenland receives a block grant from Denmark. The block grant equals about two-thirds of Greenland's government budget or about one-quarter of the entire GDP of Greenland. Economic stability is seen as a basis for full political independence from Denmark. When Kim Kielsen was reelected with a strong majority as the leader of the largest Greenlandic pro- independence party Siumut in 2017, observers considered it a win for the \\"slow-independence\\" faction instead of the \\"now-independence\\" faction. (His opponent, Vittus Qujaukitsoq, had argued for independence even if it meant losing the large annual block grant from the Danish state.) If Greenland were to become an independent country, the annual block grant from Denmark to Greenland would cease. = United Kingdom = Since devolution in the United Kingdom was implemented in the late 1990s, creating the Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly and the Northern Ireland Assembly, the devolved governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have been funded by block grants from the government of the United Kingdom because only a relatively small percentage of the tax revenue is collected by the devolved governments. Westminster provides a block grant for Transport for London reflecting the expense of operating the London Underground and the fact the London Authority is unable to raise a Transport Levy on Council Tax unlike other metropolitan counties in the UK (Though since 2012 the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy has been introduced allowing the Mayor to attach a levy on property development to serve a similar function). Under the terms of the Scotland Act 2012, the block grant from the United Kingdom government to Scotland will be cut, but the Scottish Government will be able to collect an equivalent amount of income tax. = Netherlands = On the other hand, there is limited research that suggests that block grants have a positive impact on policy outcomes. One study in the Netherlands evaluating the ADHA (Assistance in Daily Housekeeping Activities) block grant finds that for each additional euro of grant money given to local governments, 50 cents is spent on ADHA. Consequently, the authors argue that block grants can achieve important outcomes, and that categorical grants are not necessary to force spending on particular issues. However, block grant critics would likely argue that this 50% spending rate on ADHA is a sign of ineffectiveness, as it means that local governments are spending the rest of the funding on unrelated issues.

Development An-225 carrying Buran in 1989 The lead designer of the An-225 (and the An-124) was Viktor Tolmachev. The Antonov An-225 was designed to airlift the Energia rocket's boosters and the Buran- class orbiters for the Soviet space program. It was developed as a replacement for the Myasishchev VM-T. The An-225's original mission and objectives are almost identical to that of the United States' Shuttle Carrier Aircraft. The An-225 first flew on 21 December 1988 with a 74-minute flight from Kyiv. The aircraft was on static display at the Paris Air Show in 1989 and it flew during the public days at the Farnborough air show in 1990. Two aircraft were ordered, but only one An-225 (registration CCCP-82060 later UR-82060) was finished. It can carry ultra-heavy and oversize freight, up to internally, or on the upper fuselage. Cargo on the upper fuselage can be long. The second An-225 was partially built during the late 1980s for the Soviet space program. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 and the cancellation of the Buran program, the lone operational An-225 was placed in storage in 1994.Antonov An-225 Mriya. Airliners.net. The six Ivchenko-Progress engines were removed for use on An-124s, and the second uncompleted An-225 airframe was also stored. In the 1990s, it became clear that a cargoliner bigger than the An-124 was needed.

Buran-energia.com In May 2011, the Antonov CEO is reported to have said that the completion of a second An-225 Mriya transport aircraft with a carrying capacity of 250 tons requires at least $300 million, but if the financing is provided, its completion could be achieved in three years. According to different sources, the second aircraft is 60‚Äì70% complete. Airspace Industry Corporation of China (AICC)'s president, Zhang You-Sheng, told a BBC reporter that AICC first contemplated cooperation with Antonov in 2009 and contacted them in 2011. AICC intends to modernize the second unfinished An-225 and develop it into an air launch to orbit platform for commercial satellites at altitudes up to . In April 2013, the Russian government announced plans to revive Soviet-era air launch projects that would use a purpose-built modification to the An-225 as a midair launchpad. In August 2016, representatives from Ukraine's Antonov and AICC, an import-export company operating out of Hong Kong, signed an agreement to recommence production of the An-225, with China now planning to procure and fly the first model by 2019. The aviation media cast doubt on the production restart, indicating that due to the ongoing Russia‚ÄìUkraine conflict needed parts from Russia are unavailable, although they may be made in China instead. On 25 March 2020, the freighter commenced a series of test flights from Hostomel Airport near Kyiv, after more than a year out of service for the installation of a domestically-designed power management and control system. Design An-225's main landing gear Based on Antonov's earlier An-124, the An-225 has fuselage barrel extensions added fore and aft of the wings. The wings also received root extensions to increase span. The wings are anhedral. The flight control surfaces are controlled via fly-by-wire and triple-redundant hydraulics. Two more Progress D-18T turbofan engines were added to the new wing roots, bringing the total to six. An increased-capacity landing gear system with 32 wheels was designed, some of which are steerable, enabling the aircraft to turn within a runway. Like its An-124 predecessor, the An-225 has nose gear designed to \\"kneel\\" so cargo can be more easily loaded and unloaded. Unlike the An-124, which has a rear cargo door and ramp, the An-225 design left these off to save weight, and the empennage design was changed from a single vertical stabilizer to a twin tail with an oversized, swept-back horizontal stabilizer. The twin tail was essential to enable the plane to carry large, heavy external loads that would disturb the airflow around a conventional tail. Unlike the An-124, the An-225 was not intended for tactical airlifting and is not designed for short-field operation. Three of six Ivchenko Progress D-18T turbofan engines on the An-225 Initially the An-225 had a maximum gross weight of , but from 2000 to 2001 the aircraft underwent modifications at a cost of US$20M such as the addition of a reinforced floor, which increased the maximum gross weight to .Forward, David C: \\"Antonov's Dream Machine\\", p. 23.

In 1989, the Antonov Design Bureau set up a holding company as a heavy airlift shipping corporation under the name \\"Antonov Airlines\\", based in Kyiv, Ukraine and operating from London Luton Airport in partnership with Air Foyle HeavyLift. The company began operations with a fleet of four An-124-100s and three Antonov An-12s, but a need for aircraft larger than the An-124 became apparent in the late 1990s. In response, the original An-225 was re-engined, modified for heavy cargo transport, and placed back in service under the management of Antonov Airlines. Antonov An-225 at Hostomel Airport, Ukraine On 23 May 2001, the An-225 received its type certificate from the Interstate Aviation Committee Aviation Register (IAC AR). On 11 September 2001, carrying four main battle tanks at a record load of of cargo, the An-225 flew at an altitude of up to over a closed circuit of at a speed of . The hire cost can be $30,000 per hour. The An-225 attracts a high degree of public interest, so much that it has managed to attain a global following due to its size and its uniqueness. People frequently visit airports to see its scheduled arrivals and departures, such as in Perth, Australia in May 2016 when a crowd of more than 15,000 people gathered at Perth Airport. =Contracted flights= The type's first flight in commercial service departed from Stuttgart, Germany on 3 January 2002, and flew to Thumrait, Oman with 216,000 prepared meals for American military personnel based in the region.

He learned to exploit the open, yet restrained, hostilities between the Byzantine Empire and the Crusader principalities of Edessa and Antioch. Most of his successes benefited from Byzantium‚Äôs pre-occupation with the threats of Zengi (the atabeg of Mosul) from Aleppo and the lack of effective Frankish rule, especially in the Principality of Antioch. He expanded his rule over the Cilician plains and even to the Mediterranean shores. In his time, relations between the Armenians and the Franks (the Crusaders), two former allies, were not always as courteous as before: a major cause of dissension between them was the ownership of the strongholds of the southern Amanus, and on the neighboring coasts of the Gulf of Alexandretta. Leo was captured after being invited to a meeting by the Byzantine Emperor John II Comnenus, who had sworn a false promise of peace. Leo and two of his sons were taken captive and imprisoned in Constantinople where Leo died shortly after. His early life Leo was the younger son of Constantine I, lord of Armenian Cilicia. It is likely that his mother was the great- granddaughter of Bardas Phokas. When Constantine I died, Leo‚Äôs brother Thoros I succeeded him; Leo may have ruled in the eastern part of ‚Äúthe Mountains‚Äù during the lifetime of his brother (although the basis of this proposition is not known). Sometime between 1100 and 1103, Count Baldwin II of Edessa gave his sister in marriage to Leo; but the name and origin of his wife are not known with certainty. It is also possible that his wife was Baldwin II‚Äôs sister-in-law, a daughter of the Armenian Gabriel of Melitene. In 1111, Sultan Malik Shah of Iconium entered Armenian territories, and two of the commanders of Leo‚Äôs brother were killed in battle. Saddened by this loss, Leo was so enraged that he launched a savage attack against the Turks and drove them into retreat. In 1118, Leo assigned by his brother brought a contingent to help Prince Roger of Antioch at the siege of Azaz (today A'zƒÅz in Syria). His rule Armenian Cilicia and the Levant in 1135 CE. Thoros I died in 1129 (or in 1130), and his son Constantine II died a few months later, in the course of a palace intrigue. Other authors (e.g., Jacob G. Ghazarian, Vahan M. Kurkjian) suggest that Thoros I died without a male heir and was directly succeeded by Leo. =Conflicts with the Franks= In February 1130, Bohemond II, Prince of Antioch, whose ambition was to restore his principality, thought that the moment had come to recover Anazarbus (a former Antiochene town which had fallen into the possession of Thoros I). He marched with a small force up the river Jihan towards his objective. Leo was alarmed and appealed for help to the Danishmend emir, Ghazi. As Bohemond II progressed carelessly up the river, meeting only light resistance from the Armenians, the Danishmend Turks fell on him and massacred the whole of his army. However, it was due to Byzantine intervention that the Turks did not follow up their victory; and Anazarbus remained in Armenian hands ‚Äì Michael the Syrian says that John II Comnenus at once started an offensive against the Turks. Soon after Bohemond II‚Äô death, Leo protected in his rear by an alliance with the Danishmend emir, descended into the plain; after a brief unsuccessful siege of Seleucia, he seized the three cities of Mamistra, Tarsus and Adana in 1131. In 1133, Leo captured Sarventikar, on the slopes of the Amanus Mountains, from Baldwin of Marash. But the Armenian hold over Cilicia was weak: bandits found refuge there, and pirates hung about its coasts. In 1136, the new prince of Antioch, Raymond I decided that his first action must be to recover Cilicia. With the approval of King Fulk of Jerusalem he marched with Baldwin of Marash against Leo. But Leo, with the help of Count Joscelin II of Edessa (who was his nephew), drove back the Antiochene army. Triumphant, Leo agreed to have a personal interview with Baldwin of Marash, who treacherously made him prisoner and sent him off to captivity in Antioch. In Leo‚Äôs absence his three sons quarreled: the eldest, Constantine, was eventually captured and blinded by his brothers. Meanwhile, the Danishmend emir, Mohammed II ibn Ghazi, invaded Cilicia, destroyed the harvest. Shaken by these disasters, Leo bought his freedom by offering to give up the Cilician cities (Sarventikar, Mamistra and Adana) to Raymond I; in addition he paid 60,000 gold pieces and gave his son as a hostage; but on his return home he forgot his promise. A desultory war broke out again, till, early in 1137, Joscelin II patched up a truce between the combatants. An alliance was then formed against the Emperor John II Comnenus, who was then pressing his claims against Antioch as well as Cilicia. =The (re-)occupation of Cilicia by the Byzantines= In the spring of 1137, the imperial army, with the Emperor and his sons at its head, assembled at Attalia (today Antalya in Turkey) and advanced eastward into Cilicia. Leo moved up in an attempt to check its progress by taking the Byzantine frontier fortress of Seleucia, but was forced to retire. The Emperor swept on, past Mersin, Tarsus, Adana and Mamistra, which all yielded to him at once. Leo relied on the great fortifications of Anazarbus to hold him up. Its garrison resisted for 37 days, but the siege engines of the Byzantines battered down its walls, and the city was forced to surrender. Leo retreated into the high Taurus Mountains, while the emperor led his forces southward into the plain of Antioch. After the emperor had asserted his authority over the Principality of Antioch, he returned to Cilicia to finish off its conquest. The family castle of Vahka (today Feke in Turkey) held out for some weeks. Eventually John invited Leo to a meeting under a false promise of peace, where the prince was captured. Leo and two of his sons, Roupen and Thoros, were subsequently taken prisoner. His last years in exile Leo and his two sons were sent to prison in Constantinople. They were soon allowed to live in the court under surveillance and John acted more honorably towards Leo, with the two dining and going on hunting parties together. Leo's son Roupen was later murdered by Byzantine grandees that were envious of his strength. Leo died in Constantinople.

The president is Estela Barnes de Carlotto. The organization was founded in 1977 to locate children kidnapped during the repression, some of them born to mothers in prison who were later \\"disappeared\\", and to return the children to their surviving biological families. It was believed that at the time it was likely that around 30,000 had disappeared between the ages of 16-35; around 30% were women and of those women, around 3% were pregnant.Arditti, R. (2002).

The Grandmothers' work led to the creation of the Argentine Forensic Anthropology Team and the establishment of a National Genetic Data Bank. Aided by recent breakthroughs in genetic testing, the Grandmothers succeeded in returning 31 children to their biological families. In 13 other cases, adoptive and biological families agreed on jointly raising the children after they had been identified.

In fact, there was a waiting list that consisted of military families that wanted to adopt the trafficked children. These families specified ideal physical characteristics such as sex, hair and eye color. The children who were not chosen by new families were placed in orphanages and adopted later in their lives.Mart√≠nez, L. (1996). Recovering the Future: Grandmothers Campaigning for Human Rights.

No one demographic of people were abducted. Any person suspected as a threat to the dictatorship would be taken; this includes men and women, young and old, pregnant women, students, middle class workers, lawyers, scientists etc. The military tactics such as Operation Condor and a \\"night and fog\\" regime allowed the Argentine government along with other countries surrounding it to deny its actions. While hundreds of people were taken and placed into detention centers that were widely scattered across South America, the government could say that it had never heard of such allegations. With these tactics, the government was able to carry out mass executions. Victims were also thrown from airplanes into the sea, died in captivity and of other torture methods.Arditti, R. (2002).

Each generation suffering from some sort of long-term psychological harm due to living through a time that legitimized crime.Arditti, R. (2002).

The purpose of the grandmothers forming their organization was to find those who went missing during the war as well as provide rehabilitation to those they are able to identify, a cause that is still being fulfilled. However, even today there is a conflict with that aim because on one hand, the grandmothers deserve to know what happened to their loved ones and to know what happened to them. On the other hand, the children sometimes refuse identification methods such as DNA testing and refuse to reunite with their biological family. The refusal has both been voluntary and involuntary; voluntary if the children truly do want to reunite with their biological family, involuntary if the children have been threatened or intimidated out of reuniting, most likely by the government or other military personnel who had adopted the children at the time of the kidnappings.Garibian, S.

Retrieved from www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1wn0rw2.7 Many of the children who were abducted decline the option to meet their biological family because they believe that they are not their true relatives due to the fact that the children were deprived of being raised by their biological parents. Meeting with relatives such as the grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo may open up dark memories that the children cannot handle. Whatever the circumstance of the child, the organization still believes in providing the abducted the opportunity to learn more about themselves and their family history no matter how tragic it is, which is why the grandmothers have continued their movement periodically protest to gain more followers. They make sure to continue to protest at the plaza to remind people of Argentina that their work is not finished.  Formation  The Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo was founded in 1977 to protect children's rights as a response to state sponsored terrorism. Initially they were known as Argentine Grandmothers with Disappeared Little Grandchildren (Abuelas Argentinas con Nietitos Desaparecidos), but later adopted the name The Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo (Las Abuelas de Plaza de Mayo). In 1983 the constitutional government was re-established and the grandmothers searched for missing children using anonymous tips and conducted their own investigations, but were unable to prove the children's identities. Geneticists from the United States worked with the Grandmothers and were able to store blood samples from family members in the National Genetic Data Bank until the grandchildren could be located and could confirm the relatedness with an accuracy rate of 99.99%. The Grandmothers fought through the court systems to annul the unlawful adoptions. By the mid 1990s legal battles of custody were no longer appropriate because the missing grandchildren were now legal adults. The grandmothers adapted their strategy and started public awareness campaigns to direct the missing grandchildren to contact the organization. As of 2008, their efforts had resulted in finding 97 grandchildren.  Work with Identity Archive  In 2000, the Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo partnered with the Identity Archive to provide collections of photos, films, audiotapes, diaries, significant objects, and personal stories from families whose children and grandchildren had disappeared. This was done because some of the grandparents were aging and dying without finding their grandchildren and the Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo wanted to provide these accounts if children were found in the future.  Public Awareness Campaigns  In the mid to late 1990s, the missing grandchildren that the Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo sought became legal adults. The Grandmothers then turned to public awareness campaigns to achieve their goals. The difference between Argentina's case and other child trafficking cases is that the disappeared children likely did not know that they were adopted. The organization turned to a commercial campaign and joined with actors to appeal to younger audiences. Their goal was to use popular culture manufacture doubt within the minds of a group of people who would have never questioned their family. Besides the public protests at the time of the trafficking, the grandmothers have continued to put their efforts into locating more people to this day. Today, the women are known for providing other services such as legal counseling, assistance in investigations, as well as certain forms of psychological support for other women and their families. With these resources, families are able to receive comfort and rehabilitation. The women of the organization also provide training and seminars to teach new volunteers how to assist in rehabilitation services as well as learn more on human rights work.Mart√≠nez, L. (1996).

The harbor is contaminated with PCBs. Environmental remediation deals with the removal of pollution or contaminants from environmental media such as soil, groundwater, sediment, or surface water. Remedial action is generally subject to an array of regulatory requirements, and may also be based on assessments of human health and ecological risks where no legislative standards exist, or where standards are advisory. Remediation standards In the United States, the most comprehensive set of Preliminary Remediation Goals (PRGs) is from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region 9. A set of standards used in Europe exists and is often called the Dutch standards. The European Union (EU) is rapidly moving towards Europe-wide standards, although most of the industrialised nations in Europe have their own standards at present. In Canada, most standards for remediation are set by the provinces individually, but the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment provides guidance at a federal level in the form of the Canadian Environmental Quality Guidelines and the Canada-Wide StandardsCanada-Wide Standard for Petroleum Hydrocarbons in Soil. Site assessment Once a site is suspected of being contaminated there is a need to assess the contamination. Often the assessment begins with preparation of a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment. The historical use of the site and the materials used and produced on site will guide the assessment strategy and type of sampling and chemical analysis to be done. Often nearby sites owned by the same company or which are nearby and have been reclaimed, levelled or filled are also contaminated even where the current land use seems innocuous. For example, a car park may have been levelled by using contaminated waste in the fill. Also important is to consider off site contamination of nearby sites often through decades of emissions to soil, groundwater, and air. Ceiling dust, topsoil, surface and groundwater of nearby properties should also be tested, both before and after any remediation. This is a controversial step as: # No one wants to have to pay for the cleanup of the site; # If nearby properties are found to be contaminated it may have to be noted on their property title, potentially affecting the value; # No one wants to pay for the cost of assessment. Often corporations which do voluntary testing of their sites are protected from the reports to environmental agencies becoming public under Freedom of Information Acts, however a \\"Freedom of Information\\" inquiry will often produce other documents that are not protected or will produce references to the reports. Funding remediation In the US there has been a mechanism for taxing polluting industries to form a Superfund to remediate abandoned sites, or to litigate to force corporations to remediate their contaminated sites. Other countries have other mechanisms and commonly sites are rezoned to \\"higher\\" uses such as high density housing, to give the land a higher value so that after deducting cleanup costs there is still an incentive for a developer to purchase the land, clean it up, redevelop it and sell it on, often as apartments (home units). Mapping remediation There are several tools for mapping these sites and which allow the user to view additional information. One such tool is TOXMAP, a Geographic Information System (GIS) from the Division of Specialized Information Services of the United States National Library of Medicine (NLM) that uses maps of the United States to help users visually explore data from the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Superfund and Toxics Release Inventory programs. Technologies Remediation technologies are many and varied but can generally be categorized into ex-situ and in-situ methods. Ex-situ methods involve excavation of affected soils and subsequent treatment at the surface as well as extraction of contaminated groundwater and treatment at the surface. In-situ methods seek to treat the contamination without removing the soils or groundwater. Various technologies have been developed for remediation of oil-contaminated soil/sediments. Traditional remediation approaches consist of soil excavation and disposal to landfill and groundwater \\"pump and treat\\". In-situ technologies include but are not limited to: solidification and stabilization, soil vapor extraction, permeable reactive barriers, monitored natural attenuation, bioremediation-phytoremediation, chemical oxidation, steam-enhanced extraction and in situ thermal desorption and have been used extensively in the USA. =Thermal desorption= Thermal desorption is a technology for soil remediation. During the process a desorber volatilizes the contaminants (e.g. oil, mercury or hydrocarbon) to separate them from especially soil or sludge. After that the contaminants can either be collected or destroyed in an offgas treatment system. =Excavation or dredging= Excavation processes can be as simple as hauling the contaminated soil to a regulated landfill, but can also involve aerating the excavated material in the case of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Recent advancements in bioaugmentation and biostimulation of the excavated material have also proven to be able to remediate semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) onsite. If the contamination affects a river or bay bottom, then dredging of bay mud or other silty clays containing contaminants (including sewage sludge with harmful microorganisms) may be conducted. Recently, ExSitu Chemical oxidation has also been utilized in the remediation of contaminated soil. This process involves the excavation of the contaminated area into large bermed areas where they are treated using chemical oxidation methods. =Surfactant enhanced aquifer remediation (SEAR)= Also known as solubilization and recovery, the surfactant enhanced aquifer remediation process involves the injection of hydrocarbon mitigation agents or specialty surfactants into the subsurface to enhance desorption and recovery of bound up otherwise recalcitrant non aqueous phase liquid (NAPL). In geologic formations that allow delivery of hydrocarbon mitigation agents or specialty surfactants, this approach provides a cost- effective and permanent solution to sites that have been previously unsuccessful utilizing other remedial approaches. This technology is also successful when utilized as the initial step in a multi-faceted remedial approach utilizing SEAR then In situ Oxidation, bioremediation enhancement or soil vapor extraction (SVE). =Pump and treat= Pump and treat involves pumping out contaminated groundwater with the use of a submersible or vacuum pump, and allowing the extracted groundwater to be purified by slowly proceeding through a series of vessels that contain materials designed to adsorb the contaminants from the groundwater. For petroleum-contaminated sites this material is usually activated carbon in granular form. Chemical reagents such as flocculants followed by sand filters may also be used to decrease the contamination of groundwater. Air stripping is a method that can be effective for volatile pollutants such as BTEX compounds found in gasoline. For most biodegradable materials like BTEX, MTBE and most hydrocarbons, bioreactors can be used to clean the contaminated water to non-detectable levels. With fluidized bed bioreactors it is possible to achieve very low discharge concentrations which will meet or exceed discharge requirements for most pollutants. Depending on geology and soil type, pump and treat may be a good method to quickly reduce high concentrations of pollutants. It is more difficult to reach sufficiently low concentrations to satisfy remediation standards, due to the equilibrium of absorption/desorption processes in the soil. However, pump and treat is typically not the best form of remediation. It is expensive to treat the groundwater, and typically is a very slow process to clean up a release with pump and treat. It is best suited to control the hydraulic gradient and keep a release from spreading further. Better options of in-situ treatment often include air sparge/soil vapor extraction (AS/SVE) or dual phase extraction/multiphase extraction (DPE/MPE). Other methods include trying to increase the dissolved oxygen content of the groundwater to support microbial degradation of the compound (especially petroleum) by direct injection of oxygen into the subsurface, or the direct injection of a slurry that slowly releases oxygen over time (typically magnesium peroxide or calcium oxy-hydroxide). = Solidification and stabilization = Solidification and stabilization work has a reasonably good track record but also a set of serious deficiencies related to durability of solutions and potential long- term effects. In addition CO2 emissions due to the use of cement are also becoming a major obstacle to its widespread use in solidification/stabilization projects. Stabilization/solidification (S/S) is a remediation and treatment technology that relies on the reaction between a binder and soil to stop/prevent or reduce the mobility of contaminants. * Stabilization involves the addition of reagents to a contaminated material (e.g. soil or sludge) to produce more chemically stable constituents; and * Solidification involves the addition of reagents to a contaminated material to impart physical/dimensional stability to contain contaminants in a solid product and reduce access by external agents (e.g. air, rainfall). Conventional S/S is an established remediation technology for contaminated soils and treatment technology for hazardous wastes in many countries in the world. However, the uptake of S/S technologies has been relatively modest, and a number of barriers have been identified including: * the relatively low cost and widespread use of disposal to landfill; * the lack of authoritative technical guidance on S/S; * uncertainty over the durability and rate of contaminant release from S/S-treated material; * experiences of past poor practice in the application of cement stabilization processes used in waste disposal in the 1980s and 1990s (ENDS, 1992); and * residual liability associated with immobilized contaminants remaining on-site, rather than their removal or destruction. =In situ oxidation= New in situ oxidation technologies have become popular for remediation of a wide range of soil and groundwater contaminants. Remediation by chemical oxidation involves the injection of strong oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide, ozone gas, potassium permanganate or persulfates. Oxygen gas or ambient air can also be injected to promote growth of aerobic bacteria which accelerate natural attenuation of organic contaminants. One disadvantage of this approach is the possibility of decreasing anaerobic contaminant destruction natural attenuation where existing conditions enhance anaerobic bacteria which normally live in the soil prefer a reducing environment. In general though, aerobic activity is much faster than anaerobic and overall destruction rates are typically greater when aerobic activity can be successfully promoted. The injection of gases into the groundwater may also cause contamination to spread faster than normal depending on the site's hydrogeology. In these cases, injections downgradient of groundwater flow may provide adequate microbial destruction of contaminants prior to exposure to surface waters or drinking water supply wells. Migration of metal contaminants must also be considered whenever modifying subsurface oxidation-reduction potential. Certain metals are more soluble in oxidizing environments while others are more mobile in reducing environments. =Soil vapor extraction= Soil vapor extraction (SVE) is an effective remediation technology for soil. \\"Multi Phase Extraction\\" (MPE) is also an effective remediation technology when soil and groundwater are to be remediated coincidentally. SVE and MPE utilize different technologies to treat the off- gas volatile organic compounds (VOCs) generated after vacuum removal of air and vapors (and VOCs) from the subsurface and include granular activated carbon (most commonly used historically), thermal and/or catalytic oxidation and vapor condensation. Generally, carbon is used for low (below 500 ppmV) VOC concentration vapor streams, oxidation is used for moderate (up to 4,000 ppmV) VOC concentration streams, and vapor condensation is used for high (over 4,000 ppmV) VOC concentration vapor streams. Below is a brief summary of each technology. # Granular activated carbon (GAC) is used as a filter for air or water. Commonly used to filter tap water in household sinks. GAC is a highly porous adsorbent material, produced by heating organic matter, such as coal, wood and coconut shell, in the absence of air, which is then crushed into granules. Activated carbon is positively charged and therefore able to remove negative ions from the water such as organic ions, ozone, chlorine, fluorides and dissolved organic solutes by adsorption onto the activated carbon. The activated carbon must be replaced periodically as it may become saturated and unable to adsorb (i.e. reduced absorption efficiency with loading). Activated carbon is not effective in removing heavy metals. # Thermal oxidation (or incineration) can also be an effective remediation technology. This approach is somewhat controversial because of the risks of dioxins released in the atmosphere through the exhaust gases or effluent off-gas. Controlled, high temperature incineration with filtering of exhaust gases however should not pose any risks. Two different technologies can be employed to oxidize the contaminants of an extracted vapor stream. The selection of either thermal or catalytic depends on the type and concentration in parts per million by volume of constituent in the vapor stream. Thermal oxidation is more useful for higher concentration (~4,000 ppmV) influent vapor streams (which require less natural gas usage) than catalytic oxidation at ~2,000 ppmV. * Thermal oxidation which uses a system that acts as a furnace and maintains temperatures ranging from . * Catalytic oxidation which uses a catalyst on a support to facilitate a lower temperature oxidation. This system usually maintains temperatures ranging from . # Vapor condensation is the most effective off-gas treatment technology for high (over 4,000 ppmV) VOC concentration vapor streams. The process involves cryogenically cooling the vapor stream to below 40 degrees C such that the VOCs condensate out of the vapor stream and into liquid form where it is collected in steel containers. The liquid form of the VOCs is referred to as dense non-aqueous phase liquids (DNAPL) when the source of the liquid consists predominantly of solvents or light non-aqueous phase liquids (LNAPL) when the source of the liquid consists predominantly of petroleum or fuel products. This recovered chemical can then be reused or recycled in a more environmentally sustainable or green manner than the alternatives described above. This technology is also known as cryogenic cooling and compression (C3-Technology). =Nanoremediation= Using nano-sized reactive agents to degrade or immobilize contaminants is termed nanoremediation. In soil or groundwater nanoremediation, nanoparticles are brought into contact with the contaminant through either in situ injection or a pump-and-treat process. The nanomaterials then degrade organic contaminants through redox reactions or adsorb to and immobilize metals such as lead or arsenic. In commercial settings, this technology has been dominantly applied to groundwater remediation, with research into wastewater treatment. Research is also investigating how nanoparticles may be applied to cleanup of soil and gases. Nanomaterials are highly reactive because of their high surface area per unit mass, and due to this reactivity nanomaterials may react with target contaminants at a faster rate than would larger particles. Most field applications of nanoremediation have used nano zero-valent iron (nZVI), which may be emulsified or mixed with another metal to enhance dispersion. That nanoparticles are highly reactive can mean that they rapidly clump together or react with soil particles or other material in the environment, limiting their dispersal to target contaminants. Some of the important challenges currently limiting nanoremediation technologies include identifying coatings or other formulations that increase dispersal of the nanoparticle agents to better reach target contaminants while limiting any potential toxicity to bioremediation agents, wildlife, or people. =Bioremediation= Bioremediation is a process that treats a polluted area either by altering environmental conditions to stimulate growth of microorganisms or through natural microorganism activity, resulting in the degradation of the target pollutants. Broad categories of bioremediation include biostimulation, bioaugmentation, and natural recovery (natural attenuation). Bioremediation is either done on the contaminated site (in situ) or after the removal of contaminated soils at another more controlled site (ex situ). In the past, it has been difficult to turn to bioremediation as an implemented policy solution, as lack of adequate production of remediating microbes led to little options for implementation. Those that manufacture microbes for bioremediation must be approved by the EPA; however, the EPA traditionally has been more cautious about negative externalities that may or may not arise from the introduction of these species. One of their concerns is that the toxic chemicals would lead to the microbe's gene degradation, which would then be passed on to other harmful bacteria, creating more issues, if the pathogens evolve the ability to feed off of pollutants. =Collapsing air microbubbles= Cleaning of oil contaminated sediments with self collapsing air microbubbles have been recently explored as a chemical free technology. Air microbubbles generated in water without adding any surfactant could be used to clean oil contaminated sediments. This technology holds promise over the use of chemicals (mainly surfactant) for traditional washing of oil contaminated sediments. Community consultation and information In preparation for any significant remediation there should be extensive community consultation. The proponent should both present information to and seek information from the community. The proponent needs to learn about \\"sensitive\\" (future) uses like childcare, schools, hospitals, and playgrounds as well as community concerns and interests information. Consultation should be open, on a group basis so that each member of the community is informed about issues they may not have individually thought about. An independent chairperson acceptable to both the proponent and the community should be engaged (at proponent expense if a fee is required). Minutes of meetings including questions asked and the answers to them and copies of presentations by the proponent should be available both on the internet and at a local library (even a school library) or community centre. Incremental health risk Incremental health risk is the increased risk that a receptor (normally a human being living nearby) will face from (the lack of) a remediation project. The use of incremental health risk is based on carcinogenic and other (e.g., mutagenic, teratogenic) effects and often involves value judgements about the acceptable projected rate of increase in cancer. In some jurisdictions this is 1 in 1,000,000 but in other jurisdictions the acceptable projected rate of increase is 1 in 100,000. A relatively small incremental health risk from a single project is not of much comfort if the area already has a relatively high health risk from other operations like incinerators or other emissions, or if other projects exist at the same time causing a greater cumulative risk or an unacceptably high total risk. An analogy often used by remediators is to compare the risk of the remediation on nearby residents to the risks of death through car accidents or tobacco smoking. Emissions standards Standards are set for the levels of dust, noise, odour, emissions to air and groundwater, and discharge to sewers or waterways of all chemicals of concern or chemicals likely to be produced during the remediation by processing of the contaminants. These are compared against both natural background levels in the area and standards for areas zoned as nearby areas are zoned and against standards used in other recent remediations. Just because the emission is emanating from an area zoned industrial does not mean that in a nearby residential area there should be permitted any exceedances of the appropriate residential standards. Monitoring for compliance against each standards is critical to ensure that exceedances are detected and reported both to authorities and the local community. Enforcement is necessary to ensure that continued or significant breaches result in fines or even a jail sentence for the polluter. Penalties must be significant as otherwise fines are treated as a normal expense of doing business. Compliance must be cheaper than to have continuous breaches. Transport and emergency safety assessment Assessment should be made of the risks of operations, transporting contaminated material, disposal of waste which may be contaminated including workers' clothes, and a formal emergency response plan should be developed. Every worker and visitor entering the site should have a safety induction personalised to their involvement with the site. Impacts of funding remediation The rezoning is often resisted by local communities and local government because of the adverse effects on the local amenity of the remediation and the new development. The main impacts during remediation are noise, dust, odour and incremental health risk. Then there is the noise, dust and traffic of developments. Then there is the impact on local traffic, schools, playing fields, and other public facilities of the often vastly increased local population. Examples of major remediation projects =Homebush Bay, New South Wales, Australia= Remediation of pesticide plant on Homebush Bay Dioxins from Union Carbide used in the production of now- banned pesticide 2,4,5-Trichlorophenoxyacetic acid and defoliant Agent Orange polluted Homebush Bay. Remediation was completed in 2010, but fishing will continue to be banned for decades. =Bakar, Croatia= An EU contract for immobilization of a polluted area of 20,000 m3 in BAKAR Croatia based on Solidification/Stabilization with ImmoCem is currently in progress. After 3 years of intensive research by the Croatian government, the EU funded the immobilization project in BAKAR. The area is contaminated with large amounts of TPH, PAH and metals. For the immobilization, the contractor chose to use the mix-in-plant procedure.

A menu may be √† la carte ‚Äì which presents a list of options from which customers choose ‚Äì or table d'h√¥te, in which case a pre-established sequence of courses is offered. Menus may be printed on paper sheets provided to the diners, put on a large poster or display board inside the establishment, displayed outside the restaurant, or put on a digital screen. Since the late 1990s, some restaurants have put their menus online. Menus are also often a feature of very formal meals other than in restaurants, for example at weddings. In the 19th and 20th centuries printed menus were often used for society dinner-parties in homes; indeed this was their original use in Europe. History German Emperor Wilhelm II and Empress Auguste Viktoria on Sept. 7, 1898 in Hotel Kaiserhof, Porta Westfalica A lighted display board-style menu outside a French Kebab restaurant. Menus, as lists of prepared foods, have been discovered dating back to the Song dynasty in China.Gernet, Jacques (1962). Daily Life in China: On the Eve of the Mongol Invasion, 1250-1276. pp. 50, 133‚Äì134, 137 In the larger cities of the time, merchants found a way to cater to busy customers who had little time or energy to prepare an evening meal. The variation in Chinese cuisine from different regions led caterers to create a list or menu for their patrons. The word \\"menu\\", like much of the terminology of cuisine, is French in origin. It ultimately derives from Latin \\"minutus\\", something made small; in French, it came to be applied to a detailed list or r√©sum√© of any kind. The original menus that offered consumers choices were prepared on a small chalkboard, in French a carte; so foods chosen from a bill of fare are described as \\"√† la carte\\", \\"according to the board.\\" The earliest European menus, several of which survive from 1751 onwards, appear to have been for the relatively intimate and informal soupers intimes (\\"intimate suppers\\") given by King Louis XV of France at the Ch√¢teau de Choisy for between 31 and 36 guests. Several seem to have been placed on the table, listing four courses, each with several dishes, plus dessert.Strong, Roy, Feast: A History of Grand Eating, pp. 213-214, 2002, Jonathan Cape, During the second half of the 18th century, and especially after the French Revolution in 1789, they spread to restaurants. Before then, eating establishments or tables d'h√¥te served dishes chosen by the chef or proprietors. Customers ate what the house was serving that day, as in contemporary banquets or buffets, and meals were served from a common table. The establishment of restaurants and restaurant menus allowed customers to choose from a list of unseen dishes, which were produced to order according to the customer's selection. A table d'h√¥te establishment charged its customers a fixed price; the menu allowed customers to spend as much or as little money as they chose.Rebecca L. Spang, The Invention of the Restaurant: Paris and Modern Gastronomic Culture (Harvard, 2000: ) =Price-less= Menus for private functions, pre-paid meals and the like do not have prices. In normal restaurants, there are two types of menus without prices that were mostly used until the 1970s and 1980s: the \\"blind menu\\" and the \\"women's menu\\". These menus contained all of the same items as the regular menu, except that the prices were not listed. The \\"blind menu\\" was distributed to guests at business meals where the hosts did not want the diners to see the prices, or to any type of dinner where the host felt that having the prices not listed would make the guests feel more comfortable ordering. Until the early 1980s, some high-end restaurants had two menus divided by gender: a regular menu with the prices listed for men and a second menu for women, which did not have the prices listed (it was called the \\"ladies' menu\\"), so that the female diner would not know the prices of the items. In 1980, Kathleen Bick took a male business partner out to dinner at L'Orangerie in West Hollywood; after Bick got a women's menu without prices and her guest got the menu with prices, Bick hired lawyer Gloria Allred to file a discrimination lawsuit, on the grounds that the women's menu went against the California Civil Rights Act. Bick stated that getting a women's menu without prices left her feeling \\"humiliated and incensed\\". The owners of the restaurant defended the practice, saying it was done as a courtesy, like the way men would stand up when a woman enters the room. Even though the lawsuit was dropped, the restaurant ended its gender-based menu policy. While price-less menus for women generally disappeared after the 1980s, in 2010, Tracey MacLeod reported that Le Gavroche in London (UK) still had a price-less women's menu for women who eat at tables booked by men, with tables booked by women getting a regular menu for the woman. Economics of menu production As early as the mid-20th century, some restaurants have relied on ‚Äúmenu specialists‚Äù to design and print their menus.https://foodlocate.com/blog/psychological-optimization-for-profitable- menus Prior to the emergence of digital printing, these niche printing companies printed full-color menus on offset presses. The economics of full- color offset made it impractical to print short press runs. The solution was to print a ‚Äúmenu shell‚Äù with everything but the prices. The prices would later be printed on a less costly black-only press. In a typical order, the printer might produce 600 menu shells, then finish and laminate 150 menus with prices. When the restaurant needed to reorder, the printer would add prices and laminate some of the remaining shells. With the advent of digital presses, it became practical in the 1990s to print full-color menus affordably in short press runs, sometimes as few as 25 menus. Because of limits on sheet size, larger laminated menus were impractical for single-location independent restaurants to produce press runs of as few as 300 menus, but some restaurants may want to place far fewer menus into service. Some menu printers continue to use shells. The disadvantage for the restaurant is that it is unable to update anything but prices without creating a new shell. During the economic crisis in the 1970s, many restaurants found it costly to reprint the menu as inflation caused prices to increase. Economists noted this, and it has become part of economic theory, under the term \\"menu costs\\". In general, such \\"menu costs\\" may be incurred by a range of businesses, not just restaurants; for example, during a period of inflation, any company that prints catalogs or product price lists will have to reprint these items with new price figures. To avoid having to reprint the menus throughout the year as prices changed, some restaurants began to display their menus on chalkboards, with the menu items and prices written in chalk. This way, the restaurant could easily modify the prices without going to the expense of reprinting the paper menus. A similar tactic continued to be used in the 2000s with certain items that are sensitive to changing supply, fuel costs, and so on: the use of the term \\"market price\\" or \\"Please ask the server\\" instead of stating the price. This allows restaurants to modify the price of lobster, fresh fish and other foods subject to rapid changes in cost. The latest trend in menus is to display them on handheld tablets; customers can browse through these and look at the photographs of the dishes. Writing style An 1899 menu from Delmonico's restaurant in New York City, which called some of its selections entremets, and contained barely English descriptions such as \\"plombi√®re of marrons.\\" The main categories within a typical menu in the US are appetizers, \\"side orders and √† la carte\\", entr√©es, desserts and beverages. Sides and √† la carte may include such items as soups, salads, and dips. There may be special age- restricted sections for \\"seniors\\" or for children, presenting smaller portions at lower prices. Any of these sections may be pulled out as a separate menu, such as desserts and/or beverages, or a wine list. Children's menus may also be presented as placemats with games and puzzles to help keep children entertained. Menus can provide other useful information to diners. Some menus describe the chef's or proprietor's food philosophy, the chef's r√©sum√© (British: CV), or the mission statement of the restaurant. Menus often present a restaurant's policies about ID checks for alcohol, lost items, or gratuities for larger parties. In the United States, county health departments frequently require restaurants to include health warnings about raw or undercooked meat, poultry, eggs, and seafood. =Puffery= As a form of advertising, the prose found on printed menus is famous for the degree of its puffery. Menus frequently emphasize the processes used to prepare foods, call attention to exotic ingredients, and add French or other foreign language expressions to make the dishes appear sophisticated and exotic. \\"Menu language, with its hyphens, quotation marks, and random outbursts of foreign words, serves less to describe food than to manage your expectations\\"; restaurants are often \\"plopping in foreign words (80 percent of them French) like \\"spring mushroom civet,\\" \\"pain of rabbit,\\" \\"orange-jaggery gastrique.\\"Sara Dickerman, \\"Eat Your Words: A Guide to Menu English\\" (slate.com, byline April 29, 2003, accessed Nov. 27, 2007) Part of the function of menu prose is to impress customers with the notion that the dishes served at the restaurant require such skill, equipment, and exotic ingredients that the diners could not prepare similar foods at home. In some cases, ordinary foods are made to sound more exciting by replacing everyday terms with their French equivalents. For example, instead of stating that a pork chop has a dollop of apple sauce, a high-end restaurant menu might say \\"Tenderloin of pork avec comp√¥te de Pommes.\\" Although \\"avec comp√¥te de Pommes\\" translates directly as \\"with apple sauce\\", it sounds more exotic‚Äîand more worthy of an inflated price tag. Menus may use the culinary terms concass√© to describe coarsely chopped vegetables, coulis to describe a pur√©e of vegetables or fruit, or au jus, to describe meat served with its own natural gravy of pan drippings. Types =Paper= City Hotel, New Orleans restaurant menu (December 8, 1857) Savoy Hotel in Cairo, menu from 1900. Menus vary in length and detail depending on the type of restaurant. The simplest hand-held menus are printed on a single sheet of paper, though menus with multiple pages or \\"views\\" are common. In some cafeteria-style restaurants and chain restaurants, a single-page menu may double as a disposable placemat. To protect a menu from spills and wear, it may be protected by heat-sealed vinyl page protectors, lamination or menu covers. Restaurants consider their positioning in the marketplace (e.g. fine dining, fast food, informal) in deciding which style of menu to use. Some restaurants use a single menu as the sole source of information about the food for customers, but in other cases, the main menu is supplemented by ancillary menus, such as: *An appetizer menu (nachos, chips and salsa, vegetables and dip, etc.) *A wine list *A liquor and mixed drinks menu *A beer list *A dessert menu (which may also include a list of tea and coffee options) Some restaurants use only text in their menus. In other cases, restaurants include illustrations and photos, either of the dishes or of an element of the culture which is associated with the restaurant. For instance a Lebanese kebab restaurant might decorate its menu with photos of Lebanese mountains and beaches. Particularly with the ancillary menu types, the menu may be provided in alternative formats, because these menus (other than wine lists) tend to be much shorter than food menus. For example, an appetizer menu or a dessert menu may be displayed on a folded paper table tent, a hard plastic table stand, a flipchart style wooden \\"table stand\\", or even, in the case of a pizza restaurant with a limited wine selection, a wine list glued to an empty bottle. Take-out restaurants often leave paper menus in the lobbies and doorsteps of nearby homes as advertisements. The first to do so may have been New York City's Empire Szechuan chain, founded in 1976. The chain and other restaurants' aggressive menu distribution in the Upper West Side of Manhattan caused the \\"Menu Wars\\" of the 1990s, including invasions of Empire Szechuan by the \\"Menu Vigilantes\\", the revoking of its cafe license, several lawsuits, and physical attacks on menu distributors. =Menu board= Some restaurants ‚Äì typically fast-food restaurants and cafeteria-style establishments ‚Äì provide their menu in a large poster or display board format up high on the wall or above the service counter. This way, all of the patrons can see all of the choices, and the restaurant does not have to provide printed menus. This large format menu may also be set up outside (see the next section). The simplest large format menu boards have the menu printed or painted on a large flat board. More expensive large format menu boards include boards that have a metal housing, a translucent surface, and a backlight (which facilitates the reading of the menu in low light) and boards that have removable numbers for the prices. This enables the restaurant to change prices without having to have the board reprinted or repainted. Some restaurants such as cafes and small eateries use a large chalkboard to display the entire menu. The advantage of using a chalkboard is that the menu items and prices can be changed; the downside is that the chalk may be hard to read in lower light or glare, and the restaurant has to have a staff member who has attractive, clear handwriting. A high-tech successor to the chalkboard menu is the 'write-on wipe-off\\" illuminated sign, using LED technology. The text appears in a vibrant color against a black background. =Outdoor= Menu cards - Presi Corp. Some restaurants provide a copy of their menu outside the restaurant. Fast-food restaurants that have a drive-through or walk-up window will often put the entire menu on a board, lit-up sign, or poster outside so that patrons can select their meal choices. High-end restaurants may also provide a copy of their menu outside the restaurant, with the pages of the menu placed in a lit-up glass display case; this way, prospective patrons can see if the menu choices are to their liking. Also, some mid-level and high-end restaurants may provide a partial indication of their menu listings‚Äìthe \\"specials\\"‚Äìon a chalkboard displayed outside the restaurant. The chalkboard will typically provide a list of seasonal items or dishes that are the specialty of the chef which is only available for a few days. =Digital displays= With the invention of LCD and Plasma displays, some menus have moved from a static printed model to one which can change dynamically. By using a flat LCD screen and a computer server, menus can be digitally displayed allowing moving images, animated effects and the ability to edit details and prices. For fast food restaurants, a benefit is the ability to update prices and menu items as frequently as needed, across an entire chain. Digital menu boards also allow restaurant owners to control the day parting of their menus, converting from a breakfast menu in the late morning. Some platforms support the ability allow local operators to control their own pricing while the design aesthetic is controlled by the corporate entity. Various software tools and hardware developments have been created for the specific purpose of managing a digital menu board system. Digital menu screens can also alternate between displaying the full menu and showing video commercials to promote specific dishes or menu items. =Online menu= Websites featuring online restaurant menus have been on the Internet for nearly a decade. In recent years, however, more and more restaurants outside of large metropolitan areas have been able to feature their menus online as a result of this trend. Several restaurant-owned and startup online food ordering websites already included menus on their websites, yet due to the limitations of which restaurants could handle online orders, many restaurants were left invisible to the Internet aside from an address listing. Multiple companies came up with the idea of posting menus online simultaneously, and it is difficult to ascertain who was first. Menus and online food ordering have been available online since at least 1997. Since 1997, hundreds of online restaurant menu web sites have appeared on the Internet. Some sites are city- specific, some list by region, state or province. =Secret menu= Animal fries from In-N-Out Burger's secret menu Another phenomenon is the so-called \\"secret menu\\" where some fast food restaurants are known for having unofficial and unadvertised selections that customers learn by word of mouth, or by looking them up online. A prime example of such being UK branches of McDonald's providing a \\"tradesmans' secret menu\\", whereby the only requirement is that you provide proof of a trade, and as cards are not allowed to be checked in this capacity according to the law, using a drive through in a van is evidence enough. Simply ask for the tradesmans' secret menu to enjoy such benefits as buy one get one free on many items. Fast food restaurants will often prepare variations on items already available, but to have them all on the menu would create clutter. Chipotle Mexican Grill is well known for having a simple five-item menu, but they also offer quesadillas and single tacos, despite neither being on the menu board. In-N-Out Burger has a very simple menu of burgers, fries, sodas, and shakes, but has a wide variety of \\"secret\\" styles of preparations, the most famous being \\"Animal Style\\" burgers and fries. This can also occur in high-end restaurants, which may be willing to prepare certain items which are not listed on the menu (e.g., dishes that have long been favorites of regular clientele). Sometimes restaurants may name foods often ordered by regular clientele after them, for either convenience or prestige. At some fast food restaurants 'secret menu' items exist which were once part of the regular menu but are no longer advertised, such as the chili cheese burrito at Taco Bell. These items may still be rung up as a regular menu item, and are assembled from ingredients that are still in use in other menu items.

Bush and Slovakia‚Äôs Prime Minister Mikulas Dzurinda are greeted by a crowd of thousands gathered in Bratislava's Hviezdoslavovo Square (February 2005). Old Europe and New Europe are terms used to contrast parts of Europe with each other in a rhetorical way. In the 21st century, the terms have been used by conservative political analysts in the United States to describe post-Communist era countries in Central and Eastern Europe as 'newer' and parts of Western Europe as 'older', suggesting that the latter were less important. The term Old Europe attracted attention when it was used by then-U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld in January 2003 to refer to democratic European countries before the fall of Communism in Europe, after which a significant number of new members have eventually joined NATO, European Union, and other European bodies. Old Europe can mean ‚Äì in a wider sense ‚Äì Europe of an older historical period, as opposed to a newer historical period. Before Rumsfeld‚Äôs use, the term had been used in various historical contexts to refer to Europe as the \\"Old World\\" as opposed to America as the \\"New World\\"; or, in Marxist usage, to Europe in the expectation of Communist revolutions. Rumsfeld's term On January 22, 2003 Rumsfeld answered a question from Charles Groenhuijsen, a Dutch journalist, about the potential US invasion of Iraq:Secretary Rumsfeld Briefs at the Foreign Press Center. U.S. Department of Defense. January 22, 2003. The expression was interpreted as a dig against a \\"sclerotic\\" and old-fashioned Western Europe. Those countries, Rumsfeld added on the same occasion, were \\"of no importance.\\"Peter H. Merkl, The Distracted Eagle: The Rift between America and Old Europe, (London & New York: Routeledge, 2005), p 54. It became a potent symbol, especially after division emerged over Iraq between France and Germany and some of the new Central and Southeastern European entrants and applicants to NATO and the European Union.Outrage at 'old Europe' remarks. BBC News. January 23, 2003. Rumsfeld would later claim his comment was \\"unintentional,\\" and that he had meant to say \\"old NATO\\" instead of \\"old Europe;\\" during his time as ambassador to NATO, there were only fifteen alliance members, and France and Germany had played a much larger role than after the admission of many new (particularly Eastern European) countries. Nonetheless, he claims he \\"was amused by the ruckus\\" when the term became debated.Rumsfeld, Donald. Known and Unknown: A Memoir, Penguin Group, New York, 2011, pp. 444-45. Further diplomatic tension built up when Rumsfeld pointed out in February 2003, that Germany, Cuba and Libya were the only nations completely opposing a possible war in Iraq (a statement that was formally correct at the time). This was interpreted by many that he would put Germany on a common level with dictatorships violating human rights.Cornwell, Rupert (February 8, 2003). Rumsfeld 'mends fences' by lumping Germany with Cuba and Libya in an axis of bad boys. The Independent. Later developments The German translation altes Europa was the word of the year for 2003 in Germany, because German politicians and commentators responded by often using it in a sarcastic way.The German Word of the Year. About.com. It was frequently used with pride and a reference to a perceived position of greater moral integrity. The terms altes Europa and Old Europe have subsequently surfaced in European economic and political discourse. For example, in a January 2005 unveiling for the new Airbus A380 aircraft, German chancellor Gerhard Schr√∂der said, \\"There is the tradition of good old Europe that has made this possible.\\" A BBC News article about the unveiling said Schr√∂der \\"deliberately redefined the phrase previously used by... Rumsfeld.\\"Madslien, Jorn (January 18, 2005). Giant plane a testimony to 'old Europe'. BBC News. Outside of Rumsfeld's usage of \\"Old Europe\\", the term New Europe (and neues Europa) also appeared, indicating either the European states that supported the war, the Central European states that had been newly accepted to the EU, or a new economically and technologically dynamic and liberal Europe, often including the United Kingdom. Rumsfeld made fun of his statement shortly before a 2005 diplomatic trip to Europe. \\"When I first mentioned I might be travelling in France and Germany it raised some eyebrows. One wag said it ought to be an interesting trip after all that has been said. I thought for a moment and then I replied: 'Oh, that was the old Rumsfeld.'\\"Rumsfeld urges terror fight unity. BBC News. February 12, 2005. The phrase continued to be used after Rumsfeld's tenure. In a March 2009 speech to the United States Congress, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said \\"There is no old Europe, no new Europe. There is only your friend Europe,\\" which The Boston Globe called \\"an oblique shot at\\" Rumsfeld.UK's Brown seeks US help to aid world economy, Susan Milligan, The Boston Globe, March 5, 2009 The next month, speaking in Prague, U.S. President Barack Obama, echoing Brown's words, said, \\"in my view, there is no old Europe or new Europe.

Anderson. Its offerings include zero-gravity atmospheric flights, orbital spaceflights (with the option to participate in a spacewalk), and other spaceflight-related experiences including cosmonaut training, spacewalk training, and launch tours. Plans announced thus far include sub-orbital and lunar spaceflights. Seven of its clients have participated in the orbital spaceflight program with Space Adventures, including one who took two separate trips to space.  History  Space Adventures was founded in 1998 by Eric C. Anderson‚Äîpresident and CEO‚Äîwith several other entrepreneurs from the aerospace, adventure travel and entertainment industries. The company is headquartered in Tysons Corner, Virginia with an office in Moscow. Space Adventures offers a variety of programs such as Orbital spaceflight missions to the International Space Station, Circumlunar missions around the Moon, zero gravity flights, cosmonaut training programs, spaceflight qualification programs, and reservations on future suborbital spacecraft. Since 2001, Space Adventures has launched seven clients on eight successful missions to the International Space Station (ISS). In April 2001, the company sent American businessman Dennis Tito for a reported $20 million payment, making him the first space tourist. South African businessman Mark Shuttleworth did the same in April 2002, becoming the first African in space. Gregory Olsen became the third private citizen to travel to the ISS in October 2005, followed by the first female space tourist, Anousheh Ansari, who completed her 10-day orbital mission in September 2006. Charles Simonyi, an ex-executive at Microsoft, became the fifth space tourist who visited the ISS in April 2007, then again in March 2009. He is the world's first private space explorer who launched to space twice. In 2008, game developer Richard Garriott, the first second- generation U.S. astronaut, became the sixth client to travel to the ISS. In October 2009, Cirque du Soleil founder, Guy Lalibert√©, became the first Canadian space tourist to have launched to space. , the company's advisory board included Apollo 11 moonwalker Buzz Aldrin, Space Shuttle astronauts Sam Durrance, Tom Jones, Byron Lichtenberg, Norm Thagard, Kathy Thornton, Pierre Thuot, and Charles Walker, Skylab/Shuttle astronaut Owen Garriott, and Russian cosmonaut Yuri Usachev. Mark Shuttleworth in space In January 2008, Space Adventures acquired Zero Gravity Corporation which is the first and only FAA- approved provider of weightless flights to the general public. In 2015, English soprano Sarah Brightman had been expected to become the eighth client of Space Adventures to visit the International Space Station, paying for her flight, with the company announcing that Brightman had postponed her trip \\"for personal family reasons.\\" Brightman was initially expected to be replaced by another Space Adventures client, Japanese advertisement entrepreneur Satoshi Takamatsu; however, in June 2015, the company announced that Takamatsu had elected to postpone his flight in order to prepare for \\"art projects that [he] would like to perform in space require cutting-edge technology both in hardware and software.\\" The spot was eventually taken by Kazakh government cosmonaut Aidyn Aimbetov. During 2011 to 2020, NASA contracted with the Russian space agency Roscosmos to purchase a large number of seats on the Soyuz during 2011-2020, after the dearth of US astronaut launch capacity due to the retirement of the 7-person-capacity Space Shuttle, and seats became unavailable to Space Adventures. Russian Soyuz capsule astronaut transport to the ISS became possible once again after NASA signed contracts with two commercial carriers which began ISS transport services in 2020, thus making the excess capacity of seats from Soyuz capsule launches available to the private market once again. By mid-2020, Space Adventures had contracted for two of the available Soyuz seats in 2021.Two space tourists to blast off to ISS in late 2021 - Roscosmos, TASS, 1 August 2020, accessed 4 August 2020. Orbital commercial space business =Clients who have flown in space= Dennis Tito Space Adventures‚Äô first orbital spaceflight client and the world's first private space explorer launched to the ISS in April 2001 on Soyuz TM-32. American businessman Dennis Tito received training at the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center in Star City in Russia. Tito participated in Space Adventures‚Äô other programs, including a zero-gravity flight, centrifuge training and a supersonic jet flight prior to his orbital flight. Mark Shuttleworth Mark Shuttleworth spent 10 days in space. He launched with two crewmates, Russian commander Yuri Gidzenko and Italian astronaut Roberto Vittori. They launched on Soyuz rocket TM-34 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome, Kazakhstan on April 25, 2002. Prior to his flight, Shuttleworth completed Space Adventures‚Äô Orbital Pre-Qualification Program and underwent almost eight months of training and medical exams, including a one-week orientation program at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston. A zero-gravity flight, centrifuge training, and spacecraft communication, guidance and control system lessons of the Russian Soyuz spacecraft and ISS were also part of his training. Shuttleworth dedicated his flight to educating South African youth and conducting scientific research. Gregory Olsen Gregory Olsen completed over 900 hours of training in Star City, Russia in preparation for his mission. He and his crew mates launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome on October 1, 2005 aboard Soyuz TMA-7. While aboard the ISS, he participated in a research program prepared by the European Space Agency that studied the human body's response to the microgravity environment. Through Amateur Radio on the ISS, Dr. Olsen contacted high school students in New Jersey and New York. Anousheh Ansari Anousheh Ansari lifted off on Soyuz TMA-9 on September 18, 2006 from Baikonur, Kazakhstan. Ansari became the fourth (and first female) space tourist. During her eight-day stay on board the International Space Station, Ansari conducted four experiments for the European Space Agency, including researching the mechanisms behind anemia, how changes in muscles influence lower back pain, consequences of space radiation on ISS crew members and different species of microbes that have made a home for themselves on the space station. Charles Simonyi Charles Simonyi is the first repeat orbital spaceflight client of Space Adventures'. His first spaceflight mission was in 2007 aboard Soyuz TMA-10 and his second was in 2009 aboard Soyuz TMA-14. Simonyi's goals for both of his missions were to advance civilian spaceflight, assist space station research and involve the world's youth in the science of space travel. His website, www.charlesinspace.com, had 33 million viewers. Richard Garriott Richard Garriott became the first American and second overall second-generation space traveler on following his astronaut father Owen Garriott into space in 2008. He is also the second person to wear the British flag in space. He launched for the International Space Station on October 12, 2008 aboard Soyuz TMA-13. Richard's main objective for his mission was to encourage commercial participation. By fostering the involvement of individuals, companies and organizations in his spaceflight, Richard hoped to demonstrate that there is commercial potential in private space exploration, while furthering the understanding of space. One of his crewmates on his return journey to Earth aboard Soyuz TMA-12 was Sergey Volkov, the first second-generation space traveler, who followed his father, cosmonaut Aleksandr Volkov into space. Guy Lalibert√© Guy Lalibert√© is the first Canadian space tourist who reached orbit on September 30, 2009 aboard Soyuz TMA-16. While in orbit, Lalibert√© promoted the One Drop Foundation and proclaimed his mission as a ‚ÄúPoetic Social Mission‚Äù. He also conducted the first ever artistic and social event, ‚ÄúMoving Stars and Earth for Water,‚Äù to originate from space that took place on October 9, 2009. It was a two-hour event that was hosted by Lalibert√© and many celebrities such as Salma Hayek, Shakira and Bono, who participated from Earth. He returned to Earth on board Soyuz TMA-14. =Clients who participated in training only= * Barbara Barrett * Lance Bass * Esther Dyson * Daisuke Enomoto * Nik Halik * Sarah Brightman * Satoshi Takamatsu =Orbital Mission Explorers Circle= A program was originally setup to allow individuals to reserve seats on future orbital spaceflights and then retain the option to fly to orbit as their schedule allowed with preferential access to mission seats, or they can opt to sell their seat to another private astronaut. Sergey Brin, co-founder and president of technology for Google Inc., became the founding member of the \\"Founding Explorer\\" group by placing a deposit on a future orbital spaceflight in 2009. In the event, Brin has never exercised his option to fly on one of the available seats as of 2020. In 2010, Space Adventures established the Orbital Mission Explorers Circle to build a definitive consortium of future private space explorers who share a lifetime goal of orbital spaceflight or the investment therein. Space Adventures has initially created six \\"Founding Explorer\\" positions in the Orbital Mission Explorers Circle, each of whom was intended to have priority access to participate in future orbital space missions. =Spacewalk= In 2006, the company announced that it would begin offering a spacewalk option to its clients traveling to the ISS. The spacewalk would allow participants to spend up to 1.5 hours outside the space station and costs about $15 million. It would lengthen the orbital mission approximately six to eight days. The spacewalk would be completed in the Russian designed Orlan space suit. The training for the spacewalk would require an extra month of training on top of the six months already required. Lunar mission Space Adventures is offering advance booking for a future lunar mission involving travel to circumnavigate the Moon, on a circumlunar trajectory. Pricing was announced at US$100 million per seat, . This mission will utilize two Russian launch vehicles. One Soyuz capsule will be launched into low Earth orbit by a Soyuz rocket. Once in orbit, the crewed capsule will dock with a second, uncrewed, lunar-propulsion module which will then power the circumlunar portion of the trip. Lunar Mission, SpaceAdventures website, undated, accessed 2010-05-24. The mission will last 8‚Äì9 days. That includes (approximately) 2¬Ω days in Earth orbit, docking with the propulsion stage, 5 days to reach lunar orbit, a 45-minute observation of the Moon from as low as 100 km, and 2¬Ω days to return to Earth. In 2011, Space Adventures announced that they had sold one of the seats on the lunar voyage for $150 million, and are in negotiations for selling a second seat. They wouldn't reveal the name of the person to whom the ticket was sold but claim he or she is well known. By 2014, they claimed to have found two people willing to spend $150 million and it could happen within three years. Space Adventures have subsequently amended their website to say they expect the first circumlunar voyage will occur before the end of the decade. Low-Earth Orbit mission In February 2020, the company announced plans to fly private citizens into orbit on Crew Dragon. The SpaceX Crew Dragon vehicle would launch from LC-39A with up to four tourists on board, and spend up to five days in a low-Earth orbit with an apogee of over 1000 km. Suborbital initiatives =Explorer suborbital vehicle= The company, along with Prodea and the Federal Space Agency of Russia, began in the mid-2000s to develop a suborbital space transportation system, called Explorer. The vehicle was to be designed by Myasishchev Design Bureau, a Russian aerospace organization which had developed other aircraft and space systems. By 2006, the Explorer aerospace system would consist of a flight-operational carrier aircraft, the M-55X, and a rocket spacecraft, having the capability to transport up to five people to space. Space Adventures abandoned the Explorer project in 2010 because \\"it got too expensive.\\"Space Adventures returns to suborbital spaceflight, NewSpace Journal, 2010-05-28, accessed 2010-05-28. =Armadillo suborbital rocket= In 2010, Armadillo Aerospace was working on a sub-orbital commercial rocket that was to have been marketed through Space Adventures. The per-passenger price point was announced in April 2010 to be $102,000 for a flight to 62 miles' altitude, above the Karman line. Perhaps You'll Visit Space In Your Lifetime, After All, Gizmodo, 2010-05-12, accessed 2010-05-15. The Armadillo-developed technology was to have been a vertical takeoff, vertical landing (VTVL) suborbital vehicle carrying space tourists to at least 100 kilometers' altitude, with Space Adventures selling the seats. The spacecraft development effort was jointly funded by both Armadillo and Space Adventures. The project has gone quiescent, as the assets of Armadillo Aerospace were sold to Exos Aerospace in May 2014.Exos Taps Armadillo Experience For Reusable Suborbital Launcher April 12, 2016 Lawsuit Japanese businessman Daisuke Enomoto sued Space Adventures as his trip was canceled by them for medical reasons after he paid $21,000,000 and no refund was given.

In cinema, music directors make up the main body of composers; the songs are performed by playback singers and the genre represents 72% of the music sales market in India. Filmi music tends to have appeal across India, Nepal, Pakistan and overseas, especially among the Indian diaspora. Songs are often in different languages depending on the target audience, for example in Hindi or Tamil. Playback singers are usually more noted for their ability to sing rather than their charisma as performers. Filmi playback singers level of success and appeal is tied to their involvement with film soundtracks of cinema releases with the highest box office ratings. At the \\"Filmi Melody: Song and Dance in Indian Cinema\\" archive presentation at UCLA, filmi was praised as a generally more fitting term for the tradition than 'Bombay melody' \\" suggesting that the exuberant music and melodrama so closely identified with the Hindi commercial cinema produced in Bombay (Mumbai) is truly pan-Indian.\\"UCLA International Institute. 2005. Screening - Nayakan (Hero). Available from: http://www.international.ucla.edu/showevent.asp?eventid=3700 . Accessed 25 November 2008. Origins In the earliest years, filmi music was generally Indian (classical Carnatic, Hindustani, and village folk) in inspiration; over the years, Western elements have increased significantly. However, film soundtracks continue to be very diverse, sometimes fusing genres or reverting to entirely classical music. Examples of this can be found throughout the history of filmi music. Music directors R. C. Boral, Harishchandra Bali, Pankaj Mullick, Anil Biswas, Naushad Ali, Khwaja Khurshid Anwar and S. Rajeswara Rao were noteworthy music directors of the 1940s. Rao, who scored the 1948 Tamil Chandralekha, the first all-India hit, continued music directing in Chennai until the 1980s. The 1950s and 1960s, included music composers like Shankar Jaikishan, S. D. Burman, O. P. Nayyar, Madan Mohan, Hemant Kumar, C. Ramchandra, Roshan, Vasant Desai, Kalyanji‚ÄìAnandjiCarlo Nardi (July 2011). \\"The Cultural Economy of Sound: Reinventing Technology in Indian Popular Cinema\\".

Viswanathan were active music directors for more than 35 years from the 1950s. As Indian cinema segued into the 1960s and 1970s, pop artists like R. D. Burman, Bappi Lahiri and duos like Nadeem‚ÄìShravan and Jatin‚ÄìLalit gave filmi a stronger western flavor with composers Ilaiyaraaja and Raveendran who rose to fame during the 1970s and 1980s in Tamil film music. Major musical forces in the 1990s and 2000s have included A. R.

The singer records the song and the actors or actresses lip-sync the song in front of the cameras, a form of singing that is characteristic of the Indian subcontinent. The songs of a film, the quality of the music and its music director (composer), lyricist and singer have often determined the success of a film. Film soundtracks are sometimes released before the film itself, resulting in a disparity between the soundtrack and the songs appearing in the film. Kundan Lal Saigal was one of the earliest playback singers in the Indian music industry. Notable playback singers include Lata Mangeshkar, Asha Bhosle, Mohammed Rafi, Kishore Kumar, Mukesh, S. P. Balasubrahmanyam, K. J. Yesudas, S. Janaki, P. Susheela, K. S. Chithra, Udit Narayan, Alka Yagnik, Kumar Sanu, Armaan Malik, Sonu Nigam, Shaan, KK, Shreya Ghoshal, Arijit Singh, Mohit Chauhan, Javed Ali, Neha Kakkar and many others. Lyricists In the 1950s and '60s, lyricists like Shailendra, Hasrat Jaipuri, Sahir Ludhianvi, Raja Mehdi Ali Khan, Rajendra Krishan, Majrooh Sultanpuri, Bharat Vyas, Shakeel Badayuni, Qamar Jalalabadi, Anand Bakshi, Jan Nisar Akhtar and S. H. Bihari wrote lyrics of many classic filmi songs. Lyrics tended towards the literary and drew heavily on contemporary Urdu and Hindi poetry. The south has seen poets like Kannadasan, Vairamuthu and Vaali rise to prominence, in Tamil poetry and literature alongside Vayalar Ramavarma, P. Bhaskaran, O. N. V. Kurup in the Malayalam music industry. Popularity ratings Binaca Geetmala, Ameen Sayani's popular Hindi language radio show before satellite television took over in India sometime in the 1990s, gave weekly popularity ratings of Hindi film songs (akin to the Billboard Hot 100 list of songs). It ran in various incarnations from 1952 to 1993, and annual lists of the most popular songs were played at year-end. The list was compiled on the basis of record sales in India.Reliving the Geetmala lore. S.K. Screen, Friday, 22 September 2000, transcript at , accessed 2006-7-29 Currently, Hindi filmi songs are sold on tape and CD compilations, played as promos and in programs on various television channels and radio stations, with different popularity ratings claiming different songs as being on the top. In an annual exercise, a net- based effort RMIM Puraskaar lists all important Hindi film songs of the year, in addition to awarding songs for various categories. Accusations of plagiarism Because popular music directors score a great many films over the course of a year, accusations of plagiarizing abound. For example, one production number in Dil (1990) is based on Carl Perkins' Blue Suede Shoes, sung with Hindi lyrics. Of late the Indian film industry has been gaining visibility outside India, and the legal risks of plagiarism have been gaining importance. Some producers have actually paid for the musical rights to popular Western songs, as in Kal Ho Naa Ho's (2003) song, \\"Oh, Pretty Woman\\". Plagiarism has also existed within India, with several music directors in Bombay cinema lifting tunes from other \\"regional\\" industries. There have also been accusations of plagiarism against foreigner musicians borrowing from Hindi filmi songs. For example, \\"Don't Phunk with My Heart\\" by The Black Eyed Peas was largely based on two 1970s filmi songs: \\"Ye Mera Dil Yaar Ka Diwana\\" from Don (1978) and \\"Ae Naujawan Hai Sab Kuchh Yahan\\" from Apradh (1972). Both songs were originally composed by Kalyanji Anandji and sung by Asha Bhosle. Another example is \\"Addictive\\" sung by Truth Hurts, which is lifted from Lata Mangeshkar's \\"Thoda Resham Lagta Hai\\" from Jyoti (1981). This led to the copyright holders of the original song filing a lawsuit against DJ Quik and Dr. Dre, the producers of \\"Addictive\\". Filmi music composed by A. R. Rahman (who would later win two Academy Awards for the Slumdog Millionaire soundtrack) has frequently been sampled by musicians elsewhere in the world, including the Singaporean artist Kelly Poon, the Uzbek artist Iroda Dilroz, the French rap group La Caution, the American artist Ciara, and the German band L√∂wenherz, among others. Wider success Filmi is also making converts and exerting influence beyond the usual Desi audiences, with many Western music stores today carrying Indian music compilations. As early as 1978, the synthpop pioneers Haruomi Hosono and Ryuichi Sakamoto of the Yellow Magic Orchestra produced an electronic album Cochin Moon based on an experimental fusion between electronic music and Bollywood-inspired Indian music. Later in 1988, Devo's hit song \\"Disco Dancer\\" was inspired by the song \\"I am a Disco Dancer\\" from the Bollywood film Disco Dancer (1982). Baz Luhrmann showcases the song \\"Chamma Chamma\\" from China Gate (1998) in his 2001 movie Moulin Rouge. Another 2001 film Ghost World featured Mohammed Rafi's song \\"Jaan Pehechan Ho\\" from the 1965 film Gumnaam. The 2002 song \\"Addictive\\", sung by Truth Hurts and produced by DJ Quik and Dr. Dre, was lifted from Lata Mangeshkar's \\"Thoda Resham Lagta Hai\\" from Jyoti (1981). The Black Eyed Peas' Grammy Award winning 2005 song \\"Don't Phunk with My Heart\\" was inspired by two 1970s Bollywood songs: \\"Ye Mera Dil Yaar Ka Diwana\\" from Don (1978) and \\"Ae Naujawan Hai Sab Kuchh Yahan\\" from Apradh (1972). Both songs were originally composed by Kalyanji Anandji, sung by Asha Bhosle, and featured the dancer Helen. The songs \\"Mera Man Tera Pyasa\\" from the movie Gambler (1971) performed by Mohammed Rafi, \\"Tere Sang Pyar Main\\" from the movie Nagin (1976) performed by Lata Mangeshkar, and \\"Wada Na Tod\\" also by Lata Mangeshkar from the movie Dil Tujhko Diya (1987) were featured in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004). Scores from Chennai Tamil films have appeared in productions such as Lord of War (2005) and The Accidental Husband (2008). Ilaiyaraaja won the Gold Remi Award for Best Music Score jointly with film composer M. S. Viswanathan at the WorldFest-Houston Film Festival for the Tamil film Vishwa Thulasi (2005).IMDb.com. Undated. WorldFest Houston: 2005. Accessed 25 November 2008. A. R. Rahman rose to fame from the Chennai film industry to become one of the most popular international music directors and has had a musicalBombay Dreams, playing in London and New York, and scored several projects outside India. He has won two Academy awards and two Grammy awards, even numerous international awards and accolades. The song \\"Chaiyya Chaiyya\\", originally composed by A. R. Rahman for Dil Se.. (1998), has also been well received around the world, making several top 10 world music lists and has even been featured in several American movies. The song was in both the opening scene and credits of Spike Lee's Inside Man. Rahman's earlier soundtrack for Roja (1991) was included in TIME's 10 Best Soundtracks of all time in 2005. He has been regarded as the only composer from India to attain massive popularity and fame in the international arena. Hindi filmi music has reached an even wider global audience due to the success of the Slumdog Millionaire soundtrack, also composed by Rahman.

Sharing borders with Pasir Ris and Tampines to the west, Changi Bay to the southeast, the South China Sea to the east and the Serangoon Harbour to the north. Changi, excluding the two water catchments and islands of Singapore, is the largest planning area by land size. Today, Changi is an aviation hub. It is the location of both the Changi Airport and Changi Air Base. Also located within Changi is Singapore's largest prison, Changi Prison. It was used as a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp during the occupation of Singapore in World War II. The prison is Singapore's oldest operating internment facility. Etymology Tanjong Rusa (bottom left) in this 1604 map of Singapore by Godinho de Er√©dia. The map is orientated with the South towards the top left. The early Malay place name of Changi was Tanjong Rusa, as written in the 1604 Godinho de Eredia map of Singapore. The name Changi was known in the early 19th century. In the 1828 map by Franklin and Jackson, the extreme southeastern tip of the island is referred to as Tanjong Changi. Vessels using the Johor Straits would have to pass by Changi. There are many versions of the etymological roots of the name Changi. The first director of the Singapore Botanic Gardens Henry Ridley suggested that it gets its name from a tall tree, Pokok Chengal or Cengal (Malay for Neobalanocarpus heimii, also known as Balanscorpus heimii or Balano scorpas), which was common in the area in the early nineteenth century. Also, it written and pronounced as \\"Chengai\\". Its heavy timber is commonly used for buildings and furniture and noted for its strength and deep rich colour. Other sources suggests that it comes from a climbing shrub found in the area, the changi ular (Hopea sangal), or chengal asir (Apama corymbosa). During the early surveys in the 1820s to 1830s of Singapore island, Changi was also named Franklin Point after Captain Franklin who was involved in these early surveys. History Early Changi was mostly a malaria mosquito infested swampland and jungle that had several kampongs spread across the vast area. Several of these kampongs included from north to south, Kampong Changi, Kampong Telok Paku, Kampong Ayer Gemuroh, Kampong Somapah, Kampong Mata Ikan and Kampong Padang Terbakar, although the exact founding dates of many of these kampongs are unknown. The place was first redeveloped by the British as a summer house and a getaway location from the city centre of Singapore in the 1890s, and was prized for its tranquillity and remoteness. The existence of the resorts there today still bear testament to the original redevelopments there. Starting from the 1920s due to increasing tension across Asia and Europe in anticipation for war, the British starting building up its military presence at the area and this included the construction of military barracks and the infamous Changi Hospital, with Chinese and Indian labourers brought in from the city. Defences along Changi's southern coast were also beefed up with the construction of machine-gun pillboxes in anticipation of the Imperial Japanese Army arrival by sea. Construction was briefly halted during the Great Depression but was subsequently resumed as these structures were considered vital for the defence of Singapore. During World War II (WWII), the area saw mass mobilisation of Allied troops in anticipation of a Japanese invasion from the north-eastern coasts of Singapore as the Japanese had moved to capture the neighbouring Pulau Ubin from Malaysia. However it was a bluff that drew vital resources from the west of Singapore that was the eventual landing site used by the Japanese. The area also saw action of three giant artillery guns called the Johore Battery, though their usefulness in defending Singapore has been questionable. In 1942, after the surrender of the British in Singapore, Allied Prisoners-of-Wars (POW) were made to march from the city to Changi Prison and the surrounding barracks where they were interned. The POW Camps were overcrowded and life as described by those who were interned there was unbearable, multiple incidents including the Selarang Barracks incident took place. Civilians were also not spared, the Sook Ching massacre which targeted mainly the Chinese population, took place at multiple locations in Changi, most notably at Changi Beach Park. Thousands were believed to have been executed in these areas. It was during this time too that the Japanese were also involved in the planning and construction of Changi Air Base. After the war in 1945, the British continued to maintain Changi for military purposes, while rebuilding up the area to include accommodations, schools and resorts. They continued to do so even after the independence of Singapore in 1965, as with other areas like Seletar and Tengah. The coast along the eastern side of Changi also saw government bungalows and resorts opened for civil servants use. In 1971, because of the East of Suez policy that was announced by the British earlier in 1968, there was a sudden and large withdrawal of British troops from Changi. The vacated area saw many people whose livelihood and businesses depended on providing for the British forces becoming jobless and unsustainable. However, there were still contingents of ANZUK troops that were left in its place and the government of New Zealand even bolstered its presence in Singapore in the wake of the British withdrawal to maintain its interest in the region. The area then later became home to several of Singapore Armed Forces units too. Changi was then revitalised with Changi Village and Somapah spruced up and Changi Airport being constructed in the area after land reclamation took place. However, this caused further disruptions to the livelihood of the residents as they had to make way for the airport and later the many other redevelopments in the area including high tech industrial estates. Finally in 1989, the last of New Zealand troops withdrew and all its remaining assets were handed over to the Singapore government. Redevelopment works continued into the 21st century with the progressive opening of the airport's terminal 3, 4 in 2008 and 2017, and the new Changi Prison Complex in 2004. Despite the strong progress of these developments, there were several ventures that were eventually stalled, like the Changi Motorsports Hub, which was expected to open as Singapore's first permanent motor racing circuit, but was halted in 2013. Future development of Changi is in the pipelines with a mega-sized Terminal 5 and the Changi East Industrial Zone expected to be ready before 2030. Geography Changi Districts Map The terrain in Changi is generally flat because most of Changi today sits on reclaimed land, there are however three notable hills in the Changi Village area, Battery (Biggin) Hill, Fairy Point Hill and Temple Hill. The ground conditions on reclaimed land however were soft marine clay which could not support the runway and taxiways of the airport, and thus works had to carried out accordingly to drain the water and strengthen them. There are also two reservoirs located in Changi, the Changi Creek Reservoir and South End Reservoir which are located to the north and south of Changi Airport respectively. The Changi planning area as defined by the Urban Redevelopment Authority encompasses the subzone of Changi Airport, Changi Point and Changi West, although in comparison to the parliamentary electoral boundaries or the Changi Estate that is commonly known in public they all differ from one another slightly. Amenities There are numerous amenities spread around Changi. They include shopping malls like Changi City Point and even Changi Airport, which is considered to be a shoppers' paradise with duty-free shopping available inside the airport's transit area. Besides those, the Changi Village hawker centre is renowned for its food options, with shophouses also found around the area for the convenience of its residents. Food and amenity centres are also found all around the industrial estates, including the airfreight centre. Places of worship in the area include Changi Bethany Church, Maranatha Bible Presbyterian Church, Sree Ramar Hindu Temple and Yan Kit Village Chinese Temple. =Education= Currently the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), Singapore's fourth autonomous university, is located at its permanent campus in Changi. Otherwise there are presently no public government schools in Changi but there were several that used to operate in its history. Additionally there are also several private and international schools operating in the area like BNP Paribus Campus, One World International School and Singapore Aviation Academy. These were the schools that used to operate from Changi and most were cleared away for the construction of Changi Airport.

Retrieved 31 October 2012. =Airport Industries= The Changi Airfreight Centre (formerly known as Airport Cargo Complex) and the Airport Logistics Park (ALPS) Terminal are two main facilities that handle the airport-related goods and services daily. This may include inflown and outflown cargo, as well as aeroplane maintenance related services. The Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) also maintains its presence there to enforce customs, inspect and even quarantine goods entering Singapore. There are other smaller industries located nearer to the passenger terminals in Changi like the DNATA and SATS Inflight Catering Centre which also cater to the airports' needs, which may include aeroplane food catering, providing manpower and goods for operation as well as the maintenance of the airport itself. By 2030 the construction of Changi East Industrial Zone is also expected to be completed on par with the opening of Terminal 5 to be able to handle the increase in cargo volume. =Other Industries= Changi Business Park and Changi North Industrial Park are industrial estates located within Changi that have aeroplane related businesses housed in them, like Collins Aerospace, but the industrial parks also contain many other businesses that are unrelated to the operations of Changi Airport. The businesses there may range from logistical, to electronics and even banking. There is also the Singapore Expo which provides companies with a place to hold conventions and exhibitions. Security Changi, except for its airport, falls under the jurisdiction of the Bedok Police Division, and the Loyang Fire Post that is supplemented by the 2nd Singapore Civil Defence Force DIV HQ. Immigration and custom controls at all ferry terminals are controlled by ICA. =Airport= The Airport Police Division is responsible for the overall security of Changi Airport. It is supported by auxiliary police like AETOS, Certis CISCO and SATS Security, that are usually deployed as front line officers for baggage and personnel screening as well as controlling entry points into transit areas, including the airfreight centre. The airport police is further supported by the Police K9 Changi Base and the 9 SIR infantry soldiers to maintain protection of the airport. ICA works independently from the airport police and maintains control over immigration and customs in all terminals and air cargo entry points. It works with the Singapore Customs in customs and excise related issues. The airport has its own firefighting and rescue services, the Airport Emergency Service (AES) that operates two fire stations and one fire substation that are located around the airport's runway. It also has two casualty clearance stations and one sea rescue base located at Changi Airport Fuel Hydrant Installation (CAFHI) Jetty. AES operates 18 firefighting vehicles, two hovercraft and two fire boats. =Military= Changi houses several military installations of all three branches of Singapore's defence forces. Installations for the army in the area include Hendon Camp and the SAF Changi Ferry Terminal, while for the air force include, Changi Air Base East and West, and finally for the navy include Changi Naval Base. With plans to move Paya Lebar Air Base to Changi come 2030 and as well as the construction of Changi Airport Terminal 5, Changi Air Base is undergoing significant redevelopment works which include the lengthening of the runway. The SAF Ferry Terminal is also the starting point for the famous 24 km route march for new army recruits before they head in the direction of The Float @ Marina Bay for their passing out parade, besides being the typical connecting point for military personnel travelling between Pulau Tekong and Singapore. =Prison= Singapore Prison Service (SPS) is headquartered in Changi and most of its departments are located in the vicinity of its headquarters, like the Prison Logistics Branch. SPS operates two prisons in Changi, Changi Prison Complex and Tanah Merah Prison School. Changi Prison is the main premises for the incarcerated in Singapore. It is currently operating from a new building site with various clusters that hold offenders of various classification. Additionally, the Tanah Merah Prison School, which took over Kaki Bukit Prison School in 2011, is the only prison school in Singapore, where inmates can sit for either the GCE 'O', 'N' or 'A' Levels Examinations. Besides prisons, Changi also has rehabilitation centres like the Lloyd Leas Community Supervision Centre, which recently saw the nearby Selarang Park Community Supervision Centre being relocated into it so that and the site can be redeveloped to a halfway house. Past prisons and rehabilitation centres in the area include Abingdon Prison/Drug Rehabilitation Centre and Changi Women's Prison. The Changi Women's Prison was merged into the new Changi Prison Complex in October 2017. Transportation =Air= Changi is the home of Singapore Changi International Airport, which is considered to be the leading aviation hub in the region and serves many regional and international destinations. Most of Singapore's international arrival and departure are made via this airport. It is one of two civilian airports in Singapore, the other being Seletar Airport. =Land= Bus There are three bus terminals in Changi, the Changi Airport Bus Terminal, Changi Business Park Bus Terminal and Changi Village Bus Terminal. In Changi Airport Bus Terminal, the main bus terminal is located in the basement of Terminal 2 but most public buses run to all terminals. Bus services 24, 27, 34, 36, 53, 110 and 858, operate from the airport's Terminal 1,2 and 3, while only bus services 24, 34, 36 and 110 operate from Terminal 4 of the airport. Private buses and coaches also operate from the airport via dedicated coach boarding bays and include services like Transtar Cross Border Service (TS1) to Johor Bahru, Malaysia. The Changi Business Park Bus Terminal is located north of SUTD and there are only two bus services, 47 and 118. However, there are more bus services that ply within the Changi Business Park that do not call at this terminal, which include public bus service 20 and other private bus services. The Changi Village Bus Terminal is located adjacent to the hawker centre and has bus services 2, 29, 59 and 109 operating from it. There used to be another bus terminal, the Somapah Bus Terminal located near the present-day Expo. It was opened in 1981 and demolished in 1989 to make way for redevelopments in the Expo area. Its bus services used to serve the east including the newly built Changi Airport which didn't have a bus terminal then. There are many more bus services that ply within the entire Changi Estate. Several notable locations with bus services running to them include, the Changi Airfreight Centre that have services 9, 19 and 89, operating within it. Access to the airfreight centre is restricted and all buses entering the centre are individually checked by auxiliary police officers to ensure that all passengers have valid passes. Commuters wishing to enter the airfreight centre and do not have the required passes are to alight at the Police Pass Office bus stop to obtain their passes. The ALPS Terminal, which is next to the airfreight centre, as well as the Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal are only accessible via bus service 35. However access to both of the locations are not restricted. Train Changi is served by 3 MRT stations, Changi Airport on the East West MRT line, Upper Changi on the Downtown MRT line and Expo which is an interchange station for both lines. All of the stations are located in the south or central of Changi, hence there are no MRT stations in the vicinity of Changi Village or the airfreight centre, located in the north. Xilin MRT station is under construction as part of the Downtown line extension and would bring greater connectivity to Changi Business Park when it opens in 2024. There are however plans for the northern part of Changi as well as the upcoming Changi Airport Terminal 5 to be linked via the Cross Island MRT line and Thomson-East Coast MRT line. Changi Airport is served internally by the Changi Airport Skytrain system that operates between Terminals 1, 2 and 3, both in the transit as well as public areas. Terminal 3 additionally has a Skytrain in the transit area that operates between the ends of the terminal for travellers convenience. The Skytrain is free of charge and is operationally between 5 am and 2.30 am, and at all other times travellers can take shuttle buses or travel on foot between terminals. Terminal 4 does not have a SkyTrain connection and the shuttle bus from Terminal 2 is available as a possible connection. There exists the Changi Railway for a period of time in the 1930s to the 1940s which was used by the British prior to and during World War II, its primary function was to transport ammunition from the piers near Fairy Point Hill to the Johore batteries located around Changi. However they have since been dismantled. Road The East Coast Parkway (ECP), Pan Island Expressway (PIE) and Tampines Expressway (TPE) all start from the end of Airport Boulevard just south of the perimeter of the airport. Airport Boulevard is the only road available for travellers wishing to enter or exit Changi Airport via road and it branches out to all four terminals inside the airport. There are dedicated roads for arrival, departure, coaches, public buses and taxis within each terminal. Taxi surcharge to and from the airport is $3 per ride or $5 per ride on Friday to Sunday, between 5 pm and 12 am. There are three major roads that head to Changi Village, Loyang Avenue and Upper Changi Road North, which is located to the west of Changi Airport, and Tanah Merah Coast Road which is located to the east of the airport. There is no expressway that heads for a similar direction. =Sea= There are multiple points of entry to Singapore via sea. The Changi Ferry Terminal, Changi Point Ferry Terminal, and Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal are for civilian use while the CAFHI Jetty, Changi Naval Base, and SAF Changi Ferry Terminal are for private or military use and access is restricted. Destinations reachable from the Changi and Changi Point Ferry Terminals include Tanjung Belungkor on the eastern side of Johor, Malaysia, in addition, bumboat ferries operate to Pulau Ubin only from Changi Point. Batam and Bintan, Indonesia, are reachable via Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal. All civilian ferry terminals are operated locally except for Changi Ferry Terminal which is managed by the Johor Port Authority. SAF Changi Ferry Terminal SAF Changi Ferry Terminal, also known as Singapore Armed Forces Ferry Terminal (SAFFT) is located in Changi, Singapore is a jetty that provides ferry services between Singapore main island and Pulau Tekong in which it is home to SAF's Basic Military Training Centre. SAF Changi Ferry Terminal is under Camp Commandant's Office (CCO) Pulau Tekong of the Singapore Armed Forces. The ferry terminal in Pulau Tekong is at Ladang, where the Ladang Camp which houses Basic Military Training Centres HQ, CCO Pulau Tekong and BMTC School 1 to 3 are located. Incidents * On 17 March 2012, Mr. Chandran Mogan, a Malaysian Indian cleaner was killed when a taxi hijacked by a Chinese national ploughed into him at Changi Airport Budget Terminal. When news first broke of the incident, donations to his widow and children were overwhelming and together with insurance claims amounted to almost a million dollars. However two years after the incident happened, news broke again that his widow had spent all their money, which caused disbelief and even anger amongst those who donated to her and her family. * On 29 November 2015, 97 passengers aboard a ferry heading from Batam to Singapore were evacuated onto life rafts after their ferry collided with an object in the water at about 7.40pm. However, their life rafts began taking in water too and were eventually brought back to the Indonesian shores by villagers' boats. The passengers finally arrived at Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal, their intended location, at 12.20am, the next day. * On 21 December 2017, 49 passengers on a ferry from Desaru, Malaysia were stranded at Changi Ferry Terminal for more than two hours in the evening and unable to disembark when a contractor's barge had blocked the jetty. The police had to be called in to assist passengers in disembarking safely. The Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore and Johor Port Authority which operates the terminal are investigating the incident.

P. Snow which were published in book form as The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution the same year. Its thesis was that science and the humanities which represented \\"the intellectual life of the whole of western society\\" had become split into \\"two cultures\\" and that this division was a major handicap to both in solving the world's problems. The lecture The talk was delivered 7 May 1959 in the Senate House, Cambridge, and subsequently published as The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution. The lecture and book expanded upon an article by Snow published in the New Statesman of 6 October 1956, also entitled \\"The Two Cultures\\". Published in book form, Snow's lecture was widely read and discussed on both sides of the Atlantic, leading him to write a 1963 follow- up, The Two Cultures: And a Second Look: An Expanded Version of The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution. Snow's position can be summed up by an often-repeated part of the essay: In 2008, The Times Literary Supplement included The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution in its list of the 100 books that most influenced Western public discourse since the Second World War. Snow's Rede Lecture condemned the British educational system as having, since the Victorian era, over-rewarded the humanities (especially Latin and Greek) at the expense of scientific and engineering education, despite such achievements having been so decisive in winning the Second World War for the Allies. Jardine's 2009 C. P. Snow Lecture honored the 50th anniversary of Snow's Rede Lecture. She places Snow's lecture into its historical context, and emphasizes the expansion of certain elements of the Rede Lecture in Snow's Godkin Lectures at Harvard University in 1960. These were ultimately published as This in practice deprived British elites (in politics, administration, and industry) of adequate preparation to manage the modern scientific world. By contrast, Snow said, German and American schools sought to prepare their citizens equally in the sciences and humanities, and better scientific teaching enabled these countries' rulers to compete more effectively in a scientific age. Later discussion of The Two Cultures tended to obscure Snow's initial focus on differences between British systems (of both schooling and social class) and those of competing countries.  Implications and influence  The literary critic F. R. Leavis called Snow a \\"public relations man\\" for the scientific establishment in his essay Two Cultures?: The Significance of C. P. Snow, published in The Spectator in 1962. The article attracted a great deal of negative correspondence in the magazine's letters pages. In his 1963 book Snow appeared to revise his thinking and was more optimistic about the potential of a mediating third culture. This concept was later picked up in John Brockman's The Third Culture: Beyond the Scientific Revolution . Introducing a reprint of The Two Cultures, Stefan Collini has argued that the passage of time has done much to reduce the cultural divide Snow noticed, but has not removed it entirely. Stephen Jay Gould's The Hedgehog, the Fox, and the Magister's Pox provides a different perspective. Assuming the dialectical interpretation, it argues that Snow's concept of \\"two cultures\\" is not only off the mark, it is a damaging and short-sighted viewpoint, and that it has perhaps led to decades of unnecessary fence-building. Simon Critchley, in Continental Philosophy: A Very Short Introduction suggests: That is, Critchley argues that what Snow said represents a resurfacing of a discussion current in the mid-nineteenth century. Critchley describes the Leavis contribution to the making of a controversy as \\"a vicious ad hominem attack\\"; going on to describe the debate as \\"a familiar clash in English cultural history\\" citing also T. H. Huxley and Matthew Arnold. In his opening address at the Munich Security Conference in January 2014, the Estonian president Toomas Hendrik Ilves said that the current problems related to security and freedom in cyberspace are the culmination of absence of dialogue between \\"the two cultures\\": \\"Today, bereft of understanding of fundamental issues and writings in the development of liberal democracy, computer geeks devise ever better ways to track people... simply because they can and it's cool. Humanists on the other hand do not understand the underlying technology and are convinced, for example, that tracking meta-data means the government reads their emails.\\"Ilves, Toomas Hendrik: \\"Rebooting Trust? Freedom vs Security in Cyberspace \\" Opening address at Munich Security Conference Cyber 31 January 2014. 31.01.2014. Antecedents Contrasting scientific and humanistic knowledge is a repetition of the Methodenstreit of 1890 German universities. A quarrel in 1911 between Benedetto Croce and Giovanni Gentile on the one hand and Federigo Enriques on the other one is believed to have had enduring effects in the separation of the two cultures in Italy and to the predominance of the views of (objective) idealism over those of (logical) positivism. In the social sciences it is also commonly proposed as the quarrel of positivism versus interpretivism.

In computing and telecommunications, a menu is a list of options or commands presented to the user of a computer or communications system. A menu may either be a system's entire user interface, or only part of a more complex one. Navigation A user chooses an option from a menu by using an input device. Some input methods require linear navigation: the user must move a cursor or otherwise pass from one menu item to another until reaching the selection. On a computer terminal, a reverse video bar may serve as the cursor. Touch user interfaces and menus that accept codes to select menu options without navigation are two examples of non-linear interfaces. Some of the input devices used in menu interfaces are touchscreens, keyboards, mice, remote controls, and microphones. In a voice-activated system, such as interactive voice response, a microphone sends a recording of the user's voice to a speech recognition system, which translates it to a command.  Types of menus  Text-based menu in an application program Text-based menu (German) with selection by cursor keys or mouse A computer using a command line interface may present a list of relevant commands with assigned short-cuts (digits, numbers or characters) on the screen. Entering the appropriate short- cut selects a menu item. A more sophisticated solution offers navigation using the cursor keys or the mouse (even in two dimensions; then the menu items appear or disappear similarly to the menus common in GUIs). The current selection is highlighted and can be activated by pressing the enter key. A computer using a graphical user interface presents menus with a combination of text and symbols to represent choices. By clicking on one of the symbols or text, the operator is selecting the instruction that the symbol represents. A context menu is a menu in which the choices presented to the operator are automatically modified according to the current context in which the operator is working. A common use of menus is to provide convenient access to various operations such as saving or opening a file, quitting a program, or manipulating data. Most widget toolkits provide some form of pull-down or pop- up menu. Pull-down menus are the type commonly used in menu bars (usually near the top of a window or screen), which are most often used for performing actions, whereas pop-up (or \\"fly-out\\") menus are more likely to be used for setting a value, and might appear anywhere in a window. According to traditional human interface guidelines, menu names were always supposed to be verbs, such as \\"file\\", \\"edit\\" and so on.Apple Human Interface Guidelines ‚Äì Menus This has been largely ignored in subsequent user interface developments. A single-word verb however is sometimes unclear, and so as to allow for multiple word menu names, the idea of a vertical menu was invented, as seen in NeXTSTEP. Menus are now also seen in consumer electronics, starting with TV sets and VCRs that gained on-screen displays in the early 1990s, and extending into computer monitors and DVD players. Menus allow the control of settings like tint, brightness, contrast, bass and treble, and other functions such as channel memory and closed captioning. Other electronics with text-only displays can also have menus, anything from business telephone systems with digital telephones, to weather radios that can be set to respond only to specific weather warnings in a specific area. Other more recent electronics in the 2000s also have menus, such as digital media players.  Submenus  Menu and expanded submenu Menus are sometimes hierarchically organized, allowing navigation through different levels of the menu structure. Selecting a menu entry with an arrow will expand it, showing a second menu (the submenu) with options related to the selected entry. Usability of submenus has been criticized as difficult, because of the narrow height that must be crossed by the pointer. The steering law predicts that this movement will be slow, and any error in touching the boundaries of the parent menu entry will hide the submenu. Some techniques proposed to alleviate these errors are keeping the submenu open while moving the pointer in diagonal, and using mega menus designed to enhance scannability and categorization of its contents.  Usage of attached ellipses  In computer menu functions or buttons, an appended ellipsis (\\"‚Ä¶\\") means that upon selection, another dialog will follow, where the user can or must make a choice.developer.apple.com: Menu and Menu Item Titles If the ellipse is missing, the function will be executed upon selection. * \\"Save\\": the file will be overwritten without further input. * \\"Save as ...\\": in the following dialog, the user can, for example, select another location or file name or other file format.

Referred to as the ‚ÄúLord of the Mountains‚Äù Thoros (together with his father, Leo I and his brother, Roupen) was taken captive and imprisoned in Constantinople in 1137 after the Byzantine Emperor John II Comnenus during his campaign against Cilicia and the Principality of Antioch, successfully had laid siege to Gaban and Vahka (currently, Feke in Turkey). All Cilicia remained under Byzantine rule for eight years. Unlike his father and brother, Thoros survived his incarceration in Constantinople and was able to escape in 1143. Whatever the conditions in which Thoros entered Cilicia, he found it occupied by many Greek garrisons. He rallied around him the Armenians in the eastern parts of Cilicia and after a persistent and relentless pursuit of the Greeks, he successfully ousted the Byzantine garrisons from Pardzerpert (now Andƒ±rƒ±n in Turkey), Vahka, Sis (today Kozan in Turkey), Anazarbus, Adana, Mamistra and eventually Tarsus. His victories were aided by the lack of Muslim attacks in Cilicia and from the setbacks the Greeks and the Crusaders suffered on the heels of the Siege of Edessa in 1144. Emperor Manuel I Comnenus, unhappy with Thoros's progress in the areas still claimed by the Byzantine Empire, sought peaceful means to settle his conflict with Thoros, but his attempts bore him no fruits. The recovery before 1150 of the Taurus fortresses by Thoros had not seriously affected Greek power, but his conquest of Mamistra in 1151 and the rest of Cilicia in 1152 had necessitated a great expedition. As a result, during the course of the next 20 years there were no less than three separate military campaigns launched by the emperor against Thoros, but each campaign was only able to produce a limited success. Thoros's accomplishments during his reign placed Armenian Cilicia on a firm footing.  His early years  Thoros was the second son of Leo I, lord of Armenian Cilicia. The name and the origin of his mother are not known with certainty. It is possible that she was a daughter of Count Hugh I of Rethel, or she may have been the daughter of Gabriel of Melitene. In 1136, Leo I (Thoros's father) was made prisoner by Baldwin of Marash who sent him off to captivity in Antioch. In his absence, his three sons quarreled; the eldest, Constantine, was eventually captured and blinded by his brothers. After two months of confinement, Leo I obtained his liberty by consenting to harsh terms. In the early summer of 1137, Emperor John II Comnenus came to Cilicia with a full force on his way to take Antioch; his army successively retook Seleucia, Korikos, Tarsus, Mamistra, Adana, Tel Hamdoun (now Toprakkale in Turkey) and Anazarbus. Leo I took refuge in the Taurus Mountains, but at last found the situation hopeless, and surrendered himself to the conqueror; Thoros and his youngest brother, Roupen were also taken captive together with their father. They were dragged away to Constantinople, where Leo I died in imprisonment in 1141. Roupen, after being blinded, was assassinated by the Greeks.  His rule  = The liberation of Armenian Cilicia = Thoros escaped from Constantinople about the year 1143; he fled to the island of Cyprus, which was then under Byzantine suzerainty, aboard a Venetian vessel and then found his way to Antioch. He took refuge at the Court of his cousin, Count Joscelin II of Edessa. From there, in the company of a few trusted comrades, he was assisted by a Syrian priest, who led them by night to a safe shelter by the river Pyramus (now Ceyhan River in Turkey). They then crossed the Amanus range (now Nur Mountains in Turkey) and reached the mountainous Armenian strongholds in the Taurus Mountains where Thoros began gathering a new following. He recaptured the family stronghold of Vahka and two of his brothers, Stephen and Mleh joined him. He made friends with a neighboring Frankish lord, Simon of Raban, whose daughter he married. = The first Byzantine attack against Cilicia = In 1151, while the Byzantines were distracted by the Moslem attack on Turbessel, Thoros swept down into the Cilician plain and defeated and slew the Byzantine governor, Thomas, at the gates of Mamistra. Emperor Manuel I at once sent his cousin Andronicus Comnenus with an army to recover the territory lost to Thoros. But Thoros was well prepared for the unsuspecting Greeks and consequently won a dceisive victory at the Battle of Mamistra in 1152. As Andronicus Comnenus moved up to besiege Thoros at Mamistra, the Armenians made a sudden sortie and caught him unawares. His army was routed and he fled back in disgrace to Constantinople. In the meantime, the Hethumids, who were pro-Byzantine sympathizers, did not overlook any opportunity for engaging in an anti- Roupenian armed conflict. Andronicus Comnenus's mission was such an opportunity but it was not an occasion for glory: many of their numbers were killed by Thoros's aggressive strategy, and many more were taken into captivity. Among the captives were the two illustrious members, Oshin II of Lampron and his son Hethum. Oshin II was eventually released for a ransom but his son was kept as hostage; but Thoros arranged the marriage of his daughter to Hethum and returned half the ransom money to the groom's father Oshin II of Lampron. = Wars with the Seljuks and Antioch = Emperor Manuel I Comnenus persuaded the Seljuk sultan of R√ªm, Mesud I, to attack Thoros and demand his submission to the Sultan's suzerainty. However, the ensuing Seljuk attack, which in fact was provoked by an Armenian raid into Seljuk lands in Cappadocia in the winter of 1154, was routed successfully by Thoros in collaboration with a contingent of the Knights Templar. Then the emperor turned to Antioch for help; he offered to recognize the new prince, Raynald of Ch√¢tillon, if the Franks of Antioch would fight for him against Thoros; he also promised a money-subsidy if the work were properly done. Raynald willingly complied as the Armenians had advanced into the district of Alexandretta (now ƒ∞skenderun in Turkey) which the Franks claimed as part of the Principality of Antioch. After a short battle near Alexendretta, Raynald drove the Armenian back into Cilicia; and he presented the re-conquered country to the Knights Templar. Other view is that after the battle Raynald was forced to return home, covered with humiliation; and later on, Thoros voluntarily surrendered to the brethren the fortresses in question, and the Knights in turn took oath ‚Äúto assist the Armenians on all occasions where they needed help.‚Äù In 1156, the Jacobites were allowed to build a new cathedral in Antioch, at whose dedication Constance of Antioch and Thoros assisted. Having secured the land that he wanted, Raynald demanded his subsidies from the emperor who refused them, pointing out that the main task had yet to be done. Raynald quickly sided with Thoros and conspired to attack Cyprus; and the Armenians attacked the few remaining Byzantine fortresses in Cilicia. = The sack of Cyprus = In the spring of 1156, Raynald of Ch√¢tillon and Thoros made a sudden landing on Cyprus. Thoros and Raynald both conducted widespread plundering of the island. The Franks and Armenians marched up and down the island robbing and pillaging every building that they saw, churches and convents as well as shops and private houses. The corps were burnt; the herds were rounded up, together with all the population, and driven down to the coast. The nightmare lasted about three weeks; then, on the rumor of an imperial fleet in the offing, Raynald gave the order for re-embarkation. The ships were loaded up with booty; and every Cypriot was forced to ransom himself. In the meantime, Thoros quickly established a friendly rapport with Kilij Arslan II, the new Seljuk sultan of R√ªm, and in 1158 a peace treaty was concluded. = The second Byzantine attack against Cilicia = In the summer of 1158, Manuel I Comnenus launched his second assault on Thoros; at the head of an army, he marched down the usual routes leading to Seleucia. There, with a small rapid deployment force of horsemen and Seleucian troops, he launched a surprise attack on Thoros. Thoros was at Tarsus, suspecting nothing, when suddenly, one day in late October, a Latin pilgrim whom he had entertained came rushing back to his Court to tell him that he had seen Imperial troops only a day's march away. Thoros collected his family, his intimate friends and his treasure and fled at once to the mountains. Next day the Emperor Manuel entered the Cilician plain; within a fortnight all the Cilician cities as far as Anazarbus were in his power. But Thoros himself still eluded him. While Byzantine detachments scoured the valleys he fled from hill-top to hill-top and at last found refuge on a crag called Dadjog, near the sources of the river Cydnus; only his two most trusted servants knew where he lay hidden. Thus much of Cilicia was restored back to Byzantine control, but Thoros still held the mountainous regions in the north. Eventually, Baldwin III of Jerusalem intervened and successfully brokered a peace treaty between the emperor and Thoros: Thoros had to walk barefoot and bareheaded to the camp of the emperor; there he prostrated himself in the dust before the imperial platform. The pardon was accorded to him for his transgressions both in Cilicia and Cyprus, and still allowed to hold partial possession in Cilicia. = The murder of his brother = Thoros's brother, Stephen, ignoring Thoros's official pledges to Manuel I. With the help of a few of his supporters, he continued attacking Greek garrisons thus giving Andronicus Euphorbenus, the Byzantine governor stationed in Tarsus, the opportunity to sabotage the treaty. Stephen was invited to a banquet held in the governor's residence where he was seized upon arrival, and his mutilated corpse was flung over the gates of Tarsus. Thoros, who had his own reasons for desiring Stephen's murder, accused of Andronicus Euphorbenus of complicity and swept down on Mamistra, Anazarbus and Vahka, surprising and murdering the Greek garrisons. Eventually, reconciliation with the emperor was negotiated through the mediation of king Amalric I of Jerusalem. Andronicus Euphorbenus was recalled and replaced by Konstantinos Kalamanos as the new Byzantine governor in Tarsus. = In alliance with the crusaders = In 1164, when Nur ad-Din, the emir of Aleppo, knew that Amalric I had left for Egypt, he struck at the Principality of Antioch and laid siege to the key fortress of Harenc. Prince Bohemond III of Antioch called upon Count Raymond III of Tripoli, Thoros and Konstantinos Kalamanos to come to his rescue. At the news of their coming, Nur ad-Din raised the siege; as he retired, Bohemond decided to follow in pursuit. The armies made contact on 10 August 1164 at the battle of Harim, near Artah. Ignoring a warning from Thoros, Bohemond attacked at once, and when the Muslims feigned flight rushed headlong after them, only to fall into an ambush. Thoros and his brother Mleh who had been more cautious, escaped from the battlefield. Around that time (in 1164 or in 1167) Thoros visited Jerusalem and suggested the colonization of a large number of Armenians, but the Latin prelates forced Amalric I to refuse the offer by their insistence that they should pay the dime (a special tax). =The third Byzantine attack against Cilicia= Intermittent fighting erupted everywhere, harassing the Greek forces throughout Cilicia. In 1168, emperor Manuel I, obsessed with his dilemma with Thoros, marched his armies into Cilicia for the third time under the command of Konstantinos Kalamanos. But Kalamanos was able to produce only limited successes which in the end induced Byzantium to renounce its right of possession of the whole of Cilicia so long as it had access to the ports of the Gulf of Alexandretta. Byzantium also disclaimed all rights to direct government of Cilicia and accepted in settlement only Thoros's recognition of Byzantine suzerainty.  His last years  Thoros quarreled with his brother Mleh who attempting to assassinate him fled to Nur ed-Din and became a Moslim. Thoros, weary after nearly quarter of a century of rule and warfare, abdicated in favor of his young son Roupen II, who was placed under the guardianship of Thoros's father-in-law, the Regent Thomas. After his abdication, Thoros became a monk. He died in 1169. He was buried in the monastery of Drazark.

A mixture of forests, glacial lakes, and streams, the BWCAW's preservation as a primitive wilderness began in the 1900s and culminated in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness Act of 1978. It is a popular destination for canoeing, hiking, and fishing, and is one of the most visited wildernesses in the United States.  Geography  The BWCAW within the Superior National Forest The BWCAW extends along of the U.S.‚ÄìCanada border in the Arrowhead Region of Minnesota. The combined region of the BWCAW, Superior National Forest, Voyageurs National Park, and Ontario's Quetico and La Verendrye Provincial Parks make up a large area of contiguous wilderness lakes and forests called the \\"Quetico-Superior country\\", or simply the Boundary Waters. Lake Superior lies to the south and east of the Boundary Waters. , nearly 20% of the BWCAW's total area is water. Within the borders of the area are over 1,100 lakes and hundreds of miles of rivers and streams. Much of the other 80% of the area is forest. The BWCAW contains the largest remaining area of uncut forest in the eastern portion of the United States. The Laurentian Divide between the Great Lakes and Hudson Bay watersheds runs northeast‚Äìsouthwest through the east side of the BWCAW, following the crest of the Superior Upland and Gunflint Range. The crossing of the divide at Height of Land Portage was an occasion for ceremony and initiation rites for the fur-trading Voyageurs of the 18th and early 19th centuries. (Abstract) The wilderness also includes the highest peak in Minnesota, Eagle Mountain (), part of the Misquah Hills. Located around the perimeter of the BWCAW are six ranger stations: in Cook, Aurora, Ely, Isabella, Tofte and Grand Marais. The two nearby communities with most visitor services are Ely and Grand Marais. Several historic roads such as the Gunflint Trail, Echo Trail (County Road 116) and Fernberg Road (County Road 18) allow access to many wilderness entry points.  Natural history  An eastern white pine growing on glacially scoured bedrock, Nina Moose Lake = Geology = The lakes of the BWCAW are located in depressions formed by differential erosion of the tilted layers of the Canadian Shield. For the past two million years, massive sheets of ice have repeatedly scoured the landscape. The last glacial period ended with the retreat of the Laurentide Ice Sheet from the Boundary Waters about 17,000 years ago. The resulting depressions in the landscape later filled with water; becoming the lakes of today. Many varieties of Precambrian bedrock are exposed including: granite, basalt, greenstone, gneiss, as well as metamorphic rocks derived from volcanic and sedimentary rocks. Greenstone of the Superior craton located near Ely, Minnesota, is up to 2.7 billion years old. Igneous rocks of the Duluth Complex comprise the bedrock of the eastern Boundary Waters. Ancient microfossils have been found in the banded iron formations of the Gunflint Chert. = Forest ecology = The Boundary Waters area is within the Laurentian Mixed Forest Province (commonly called the \\"North Woods\\"), a transitional zone between the boreal forest to the north and the temperate hardwood forest to the south that contains characteristics of each. Trees found within the wilderness area include conifers such as red pine, eastern white pine, jack pine, balsam fir, white spruce, black spruce, and white-cedar, as well as deciduous birch, aspen, ash, and maple. Blueberries and raspberries can be found in cleared areas. The BWCAW is estimated to contain of old growth forest, woods that may have burned but have never been logged.Heinselman (1996), p. 18, Table 4.1. This figure is for solid contiguous areas of virgin forest; it does not include some smaller areas within cut-over forests, nor some shoreline areas of virgin woods. Id. Before fire suppression efforts began during the 20th century, forest fires were a natural part of the Boundary Waters ecosystem, with recurrence intervals of 30 to 300 years in most areas. Smoke from the 2011 Pagami Creek Fire On July 4, 1999, a powerful wind storm, or derecho, swept across Minnesota, central Ontario, and southern Quebec. Winds as high as knocked down millions of trees, affecting about within the BWCAW and injuring 60 people. This event became known officially as the Boundary Waters ‚Äì Canadian derecho, commonly referred to as \\"the Boundary Waters blowdown\\". Although campsites and portages were quickly cleared after the storm, an increased risk of wildfire due to the large number of downed trees became a concern. The U.S. Forest Service undertook a schedule of prescribed burns to reduce the forest fuel load in the event of a wildfire. The first major wildfire within the blowdown area occurred in August 2005, burning between Alpine Lake and Seagull Lake in the northeastern BWCAW. In 2006, two fires at Cavity Lake and Turtle Lake burned more than . In May 2007, the Ham Lake Fire started near the location of the Cavity Lake fire, eventually covering in Minnesota and Ontario and becoming the most extensive wildfire in Minnesota in 90 years. In 2011, the Pagami Creek Fire ultimately grew to over , spreading beyond the wilderness boundary to threaten homes and businesses. Smoke from the Pagami Creek Fire drifted east and south as far as the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, Ontario, Chicago, Poland, Ukraine, and Russia. Common loon = Wildlife = Animals found in the BWCAW include deer, moose, beaver, timber wolves, black bears, bobcats, bald eagles, peregrine falcons and loons. It is within the range of the largest population of wolves in the contiguous United States, as well as an unknown number of Canada lynx. It has also been identified by the American Bird Conservancy as a globally important bird habitat. Woodland caribou once inhabited the region but have disappeared due to predation by wolves, encroachment by deer, and the effects of a brainworm parasite carried by deer which is harmful to both caribou and moose populations. Very rare sightings have been reported in nearby areas as recently as the 1980s.  Human history  = Native Americans = Pictographs at Hegman Lake, as they looked in 2003 The north country was inhabited by the Paleo Indian culture circa 8000 BC. Limited artifacts have been found in the BWCAW from that era and the subsequent Archaic period circa 6000 years ago. Artifacts from the Early Woodland Era (circa 1300 years ago) have not been found there, but pottery and clay pipes from the Later Woodland Indians have been found there. Paddling Down BWCAW History by Heather Monthei Boundary Waters Journal magazine Spring 2020 issue Pages 48 - 57 The area was then sparsely populated by the Sioux. Then the Ojibwe arrived and the Sioux migrated westward. The area then became a part of the homeland of the Ojibwe people, who traveled the waterways in canoes made of birch bark. Within the BWCAW are hundreds of prehistoric pictographs and petroglyphs on rock ledges and cliffs. It is thought that the Hegman Lake Pictograph located on a large overlooking rock wall on North Hegman Lake were most likely created by the Ojibwe. The pictograph appears to represent Ojibwe meridian constellations visible in winter during the early evening, knowledge of which may have been useful for navigating in the deep woods during the winter hunting season. The Grand Portage Indian Reservation, just east of the BWCAW at the community of Grand Portage, is home to a number of Ojibwe to this day. = European exploration and development = Voyageur canoe during the fur trade era In 1688 the French explorer Jacques de Noyon became the first European known to have traveled through the BWCAW area. Later, during the 1730s, La V√©rendrye and others opened the region to trade, mainly in beaver pelts. By the end of the 18th century, the fur trade had been organized into groups of canoe- paddling voyageurs working for the competing North West and Hudson's Bay Companies, with a North West Company fort located at the Grand Portage on Lake Superior. The final rendezvous was held at Grand Portage in 1803, after which the North West Company moved its operations further north to Fort William (now Thunder Bay). In 1821 the North West Company merged with the Hudson's Bay Company and the center of the fur trade moved even further north to the posts around Hudson Bay. During the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the area's legal and political status was disputed. The Treaty of Paris, which ended the American Revolutionary War in 1783, had defined the northern border between the United States and Canada based on the inaccurate Mitchell Map. Ownership of the area between Lake of the Woods and Lake Superior was unclear, with the United States claiming the border was further north at the Kaministiquia River and Canada claiming it was further south beginning at the Saint Louis River.Lass, William E. (1980). Minnesota's Boundary with Canada, pp. 47-53. Minnesota Historical Society, . In 1842, the Webster‚ÄìAshburton Treaty clarified the border between the United States and Canada using the old trading route running along the Pigeon River and Rainy River (today the BWCAW's northern border). The BWCAW area remained largely undeveloped until gold, silver and iron were found in the surrounding area during the 1870s, 1880s and 1890s. Logging in the area began around the same time to supply lumber to support the mining industries, with production peaking in the late 1910s and gradually trailing off during the 1920s and 1930s. = Protection = In 1902, Minnesota's Forest Commissioner Christopher C. Andrews persuaded the state to reserve of land near the BWCAW from being sold to loggers. In 1905 he visited the area on a canoe trip and was impressed by the area's natural beauty. He was able to save another from being sold for development. He soon reached out to the Ontario government to encourage them to preserve some of the area's land on their side of the border, noting that the area could be \\"an international forest reserve and park of very great beauty and interest\\". This collaboration led to the creation of the Superior National Forest and the Quetico Provincial Park in 1909. The BWCAW itself was formed gradually through a series of actions. By the early 1920s, roads had begun to be built through the Superior National Forest to promote public access to the area for recreation. In 1926 a section of within the Superior National Forest was set aside as a roadless wilderness area by Secretary of Agriculture William Marion Jardine. This area became the nucleus of the BWCAW. In 1930, Congress passed the Shipstead-Newton-Nolan Act, which prohibited logging and dams within the area to preserve its natural water levels. Through additional land purchases and shifts in boundaries, the amount of protected land owned by the government in the area grew even further. In 1938, the area's borders were expanded and altered (roughly matching those of the present day BWCAW), and it was renamed the Superior Roadless Primitive Area. Additional laws focused on protecting the area's rustic and undeveloped character. In 1948, the Thye- Blatnik Bill authorized the government to purchase the few remaining privately owned homes and resorts within the area. In 1949, President Harry Truman signed Executive Order 10092 which prohibited aircraft from flying over the area below 4,000 feet. The area was officially named the Boundary Waters Canoe Area in 1958. The Wilderness Act of 1964 organized it as a unit of the National Wilderness Preservation System. The 1978 Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness Act established the Boundary Waters regulations much as they are today, with limitations on motorboats and snowmobiles, a permit-based quota system for recreational access, and restrictions on logging and mining within the area. That same year the Forest Service began referring to it as \\"BWCAW\\" to recognize its wilderness character.Heritage History: BWCAW timeline, Superior National Forest, United States Forest Service. =Land use disputes= Some aspects of the BWCAW's management and conservation have been controversial. 1971 A rule limiting visitors to \\"designated campsites\\" on heavy-use routes is instituted by the U.S. Forest Service. Cans and glass bottles are prohibited from the Boundary Waters. According to the U.S. Forest Service, the measure is expected to reduce refuse by , saving $90,000 per year on cleanup. 1975 October, Eighth District Representative James Oberstar (D-MN) introduced a bill that if passed would have established a Boundary Waters Wilderness Area of and a Boundary Waters National Recreation Area (NRA) of , permitting logging and mechanized travel in the latter area and removing from wilderness designation a number of large scenic lakes such as La Croix, Basswood, Saganaga, and Seagull. The bill was strongly opposed by environmentalists. 1978 October 21, Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness Act, U.S. Public Law 95-495, was signed by President Jimmy Carter. The act added to the Boundary Waters, to then encompasses , and extended greater wilderness protection to the area. The name was changed from the Boundary Waters Canoe Area to the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. The Act banned logging, mineral prospecting, and mining, and all but bans snowmobile use (two snowmobile routes remain to access Canada). The act limited motorboat use to about two dozen lakes, limited the size of motors, and regulated the number of motorboats and long established motorized portages. It called for limiting the number of motorized lakes to 16 in 1984, and 14 in 1999, totaling about 24% of the area‚Äôs water acreage. 1989 Truck portage testing. According to the 1978 BWCAW Act: Nothing in this Act shall be deemed to require the termination of the existing operation of motor vehicles to assist in the transport of boats across the portages from Sucker Lake to Basswood Lake, from Fall Lake to Basswood Lake, and from Lake Vermilion to Trout Lake, during the period ending January 1, 1984. Following said date, unless the Secretary determines that there is no feasible non-motorized means of transporting boats across the portages to reach the lakes previously served by the portages listed above, he shall terminate all such motorized use of each portage listed above. 1989 ‚Äì U S Forest Service with the University of MN conduct feasibility tests on the three truck portages. It is determined that trucks should remain. 1990 ‚Äì Friends of the Boundary Waters, Sierra Club and six other environmental groups sue to have trucks removed; CWCS joins the U S Forest Service as intervenors. 1992 ‚Äì Appeals court sides with U S Forest Service that trucks should remain. Friends of the Boundary Waters and coalition appeal to 8th Circuit Court of Appeals. Trucks are removed from the three truck portages. 1994 ‚Äì As a result of the Friends of the Boundary Waters lawsuit against the 1992 BWCAW Management Plan, canoe rests, pontoon boats and sailboats are banned from the Boundary Waters. 1999 ‚Äì As a result of the Friends of the Boundary Waters lawsuit against the 1992 BWCAW Management Plan, the courts redefined the phrase ‚Äòthat particular lake‚Äô and exempt permits were eliminated for property owners, resorts and outfitters on the Moose, Farm and Seagull Chain of Lakes. 1999 ‚Äì Trucks return to two of the three truck portages, Prairie and Trout Lake portages, as a result of Congressman Oberstar including this provision in his 1998 Transportation Bill. A snowmobile trail located from the border provoked a lawsuit in 2006. In 2015, a judge ruled that the snowmobile trail did not violate the Wilderness Act. Proposed Twin Metals Mine It has been known for decades that there are about four billion tons of copper and nickel ore, \\"one of the world's largest undeveloped mineral deposits\\", in the Duluth Complex, which underlies part of northeastern Minnesota.\\"Minnesota's Vast Mineral Resources\\", Mining Minnesota. Accessed July 3, 2019. Resource companies have proposed mines south and west of the BWCAW upstream of the wilderness and within its watershed, leading to concerns that surface runoff could damage the wilderness. June 23, 2010. In December 2016 the federal government proposed banning mining for 20 years while the subject was studied. The Trump Administration cancelled the study in September 2018, clearing the way for mining leases in the national forest.Kraker, Dan, \\"Feds reopen forests near Boundary Waters to mining\\", Minnesota Public Radio, September 7, 2018. The Antofagasta PLC subsidiary Twin Metals Minnesota would operate the proposed mine. The proposed mine is approximately 2 miles from the BWCAW in an area which drains into the BWCA.  Recreation  Canoe campers on a trip in the BWCAW A fire area typical at wilderness campsites throughout the BWCAW The BWCAW attracts over 150,000 visitors per year. It contains more than 2,000 backcountry campsites, of canoe routes, and 12 different hiking trails and is popular for canoeing, canoe touring, fishing, backpacking, dog sledding, and enjoying the area's remote wilderness character. Permits are required for all overnight visits to the BWCAW. Quota permits are required for groups taking an overnight paddle, motor, or hiking trip, or a motorized day-use trip into the BWCAW from May 1 through September 30. These permits must be reserved in advance. Day use paddle and hiking permits do not require advance reservation and can be filled out at BWCAW entry points. From October 1 through April 30, permit reservations are not necessary, but a permit must be filled out at the permit stations located at each entry point. Each permit must specify the trip leader, the specific entry point and the day of entry. The permits are for an indefinite length, although visitors are only allowed one entry into the wilderness and cannot stay in one campsite for more than 14 nights. = Canoeing = A BWCA paddler with her wood-and-canvas canoe Canoeing or other non-motorized boating is the most popular method of exploring the BWCAW. A 2007 study found more than 94% of overnight visitors used a non-motorized boat to travel through the park. The BWCAW's size and abundance of campsites, lakes, rivers and portage trails allow for almost countless options for different routes. Many online maps and guidebooks offer suggested routes based on entry point, duration and difficulty. = Fishing = Junction of the Eagle Mountain and Brule Lake Trails Fishing is a popular activity in the BWCAW. Game species include northern pike, walleye, largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, and occasional panfish. Trout including brook trout, lake trout, rainbow trout and splake are also found. White sucker, burbot, and whitefish also occur. Limited stocking of walleye and lake trout is done on some lakes where natural recruitment is limited. The wilderness contains one of the largest concentrations of native lake trout lakes in the lower 48 states. = Hiking = The BWCAW contains a variety of hiking trails. Shorter hikes include the trail to Eagle Mountain (). Loop trails include the Pow Wow Trail, the Snowbank Trail, and the Sioux-Hustler Trail. The Border Route Trail and Kekekabic Trail are the two longest trails running through the BWCAW. The Border Route Trail runs east-west for over through the eastern BWCAW, beginning at the northern end of the Superior Hiking Trail and following ridges and cliffs west until it connects with the Kekekabic Trail. The Kekekabic Trail continues for another , beginning near the Gunflint Trail and passing through the center of the BWCAW before exiting it near Snowbank Lake. Both the Border Route and the Kekekabic Trail are part of the longer North Country National Scenic Trail. =Night sky viewing= In 2020 the BWCA became a designated Dark Sky Sanctuary, one of one 13 in the world. \\"It differs from other Dark Sky designations in that sanctuaries are the most remote and often darkest places in the world whose conservation state is ‚Äúmost fragile.‚Äù\\" https://www.fox9.com/news/boundary-waters-canoe-area-wilderness-becomes- international-dark-sky-sanctuary Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness becomes International Dark Sky Sanctuary By Allie Johnson September 10th, 2020 Fox9 KMSP Retrieved 10/12/20 The U.S. Forest Service had been working towards gaining this status for the BWCAW since 2008.

The accomplishments during the reign of his elder brother, Thoros II placed Cilicia on a firm footing. But Mleh, whom Thoros II had expelled from Cilicia for converting to Islam, almost undid his brother's work. On the death of his brother, Mleh invaded Cilicia with the support of a contingent from Aleppo, which remained in his service and assisted him to drive out the Knights Templar and Greeks from the fortresses and, in 1173, the cities which they held in Cilicia. Soon after the death of Nur ed-Din (the emir of Aleppo), Mleh was overthrown by his nephew, Roupen III. His early life Mleh was the fourth son of Leo I, lord of Armenian Cilicia. The name and the origin of his mother are not known with certainty. It is possible that she was a daughter of Count Hugh I of Rethel, or she might have been the daughter of Gabriel of Melitene. In the early summer of 1137, the Byzantine Emperor John II Komnenos came to Cilicia with a full force on his way to take Antioch; his army successively took Seleucia, Korikos, Tarsus, Mamistra, Adana, Tel Hamdoun (now Toprakkale in Turkey) and Anazarbus. Mleh and his two brothers, Stephen and the blind Constantine took refuge with their cousin, Count Joscelin II of Edessa. In Cilicia, the family castle of Vahka (today Feke in Turkey) held out for some weeks, but after its fall their father and two of their brothers, Roupen and Thoros, were captured. Leo I and his two sons were imprisoned in Constantinople where Leo I died shortly afterwards, and Roupen was blinded and later murdered. All Cilicia remained under Byzantine rule for eight years. About the year 1143, Mleh's brother, Thoros escaped from Constantinople and recaptured the family stronghold of Vahka; Mleh and his brother Stephen joined him. One after another, Thoros reconquered Anazarbus, Adana, Sis (today Kozan in Turkey) and Pardzerpert (now Andƒ±rƒ±n in Turkey) from the Byzantines. In 1164, Nur ed-Din struck at the Principality of Antioch and laid siege to the key-fortress of Harenc; Prince Bohemond III of Antioch called upon Thoros II to come to his rescue, and Mleh followed his brother. At the news of the coming of the Byzantine and Armenian troops, Nur ed-Din raised the siege, but Bohemond III decided to follow in pursuit; the armies made contact on August 10, near Artah. In the ensuing battle, Bohemond III fell into an ambush and found himself and his knights surrounded by the army of Mosul, but Thoros II and Mleh, who had been more cautious, escaped from the battlefield. In the service of Nur ed-Din Although Mleh had taken vows as a Templar, after a quarrel with Thoros II and an attempt to assassinate him, he fled to Nur ed- Din. Mleh converted to Islam from Armenian Apostolic Christianity. This was to facilitate his plans with Nur ed-Din; afterwards, he held Cyrrhus as a fief from the Emir of Aleppo. His brother died in 1168, leaving a child, Roupen II, to succeed him, under the regency of a Frankish lord called Thomas. But Mleh disputed the succession; early in 1170 Nur ed-Din lent him troops with which he was able not only to dethrone his nephew but also to invade the Cilician plain and take Mamistra, Adana and Tarsus from their Greek garrisons. The young Roupen III was followed by Mleh's men and murdered. His rule With Thoros's legitimate heir dead, Mleh embarked on a policy of conquest with cruel application of force. He beleaguered the Hethumids at Lampron (now Namrun Kalesi in Turkey), but in spite of a long siege his attempt to take this stronghold failed. Mleh then attacked the Templars at Baghras; Bohemond III of Antioch appealed to King Amalric I of Jerusalem, who marched up into Cilicia and temporarily, its seems, restored Imperial rule. But Mleh was irrepressible; a year or so later he routed at Tarsus the assembled forces of the governor Konstantinos Kalamanos, and sent him to Nur ed-Din, who held Konstantinos for heavy ransom. On March 10, 1171 Amalric I left Acre for Constantinople where he made a treaty with the Emperor Manuel I Comnenos; it seems that they decided that a common action should be taken against Mleh. An expedition organized by the king after his return from Constantinople in 1171 was interrupted by Nur ed-Din's attack on Kerak (today Al Karak in Jordan). In the summer of 1171, Mleh waylaid Count Stephen I of Sancerre as he passed through Cilicia from the Holy Land to Constantinople. In order to punish Mleh for his outrage against the count, Amalric I marched north into Cilicia in 1173; but the campaign achieved nothing except to check Mleh's further expansion. Mleh finally succeeded in 1173 in securing Manuel I's recognition of him as ‚ÄúBaron of Cilician Armenia‚Äù with whom now all Byzantine affairs in Cilicia were to be conducted.

In the United States, the term usually applies to the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978. A new form of regulation has been developed to some extent to deal with problems such as the allocation of the limited number of slots available at airports. Introduction As jets were integrated into the market in the late 1950s and early 1960s, the industry experienced dramatic growth. By the mid-1960s, airlines were carrying roughly 100 million passengers and by the mid-1970s, over 200 million Americans had traveled by air. This steady increase in air travel began placing serious strains on the ability of federal regulators to cope with the increasingly complex nature of air travel.The onset of high inflation, low economic growth, falling productivity, rising labor costs and higher fuel costs proved problematic to the airlines.Thierer, A. D. 1998, 20th Anniversary of Airline Deregulation:Cause for Celebration, Not Re-Regulation, The Heritage Foundation, Although it is generally recognized that the purpose behind government regulation is to create a stable industry, in the decades leading up to deregulation many airline market analysts expressed concerns with the structure of the United States' passenger air transport system. Concerns included high barriers to entry for fledgling airlines, slow government response to existing airlines entering to compete in city-pairings, and monopolistic practices by legacy airlines artificially inflating passenger ticket prices. In order to address these growing concerns airline deregulation began in the US in 1978. It was, and still is, a part of a sweeping experiment to ultimately reduce ticket prices and entry controls holding sway over new airline hopefuls. Airline deregulation had begun with initiatives by economist Alfred E. Kahn in the Nixon administration, carried through the Ford administration and finally, at the behest of Ted Kennedy, signed into law by President Jimmy Carter. Globally, state supported airlines are still relatively common, maintaining control over ticket prices and route entry, but many countries have since deregulated their own domestic airline markets. A similar but less laissez-faire approach has been taken by the European Union, Australia, United Kingdom, Scandinavia, Ireland and select South and Central American nations. In the United States The beginning of federal government regulation of the interstate airline industry can be traced to the Air Mail Act of 1925 and the Air Commerce Act of 1926. Additional federal regulation of commercial aviation was imposed with the passage of the Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938. That Act created the Civil Aeronautics Authority, which became the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB), and gave the CAB the power to regulate airline routes, control entry to and exit from the market, and mandate service rates, to investigate accidents, certify aircraft and pilots, to create rules for air traffic control (ATC) and to recommend new rules to prevent repetition of previous accidents. Additional airline safety regulation came later with the passage of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, which created the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) =Civil Aeronautics Board= In 1938 the U.S. government, through the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB), regulated many areas of commercial aviation such as routes, fares and schedules. The CAB had three main functions: to award routes to airlines, to limit the entry of air carriers into new markets, and to regulate fares for passengers. Much of the established practices of commercial passenger travel within the US, went back even farther, to the policies of W. F. Brown, the US postmaster general in the 1920s and early 1930s in the administration of President H. Hoover. Brown had changed the mail payments system to encourage the manufacture of passenger aircraft instead of mail carrying aircraft. His influence was crucial in awarding contracts so as to create four major domestic airlines: United, American, Eastern, and Transcontinental and Western Air (TWA). Similarly, Brown had also helped give Pan American a monopoly on international routes. (See also the US Centennial of Flight Commission http://www.centennialofflight.net/essay/Commercial_Aviation/Dereg/Tran8.htm) Typical regulatory thinking from the 1940s onward is evident in a Civil Aeronautics Board report. In the absence of particular circumstances presenting an affirmative reason for a new carrier, there appears to be no inherent desirability of increasing the present number of carriers merely for the purpose of numerically enlarging the industry.1941 CAB reported quoted on Page 32 of \\"Contrived Competition: Regulation and Deregulation in America\\" by Richard H. K. Vietor. =Airline Deregulation Act= The Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 removed many of the previously mentioned controls. Prior to deregulation, it was required that airlines first seek regulatory approval to serve any given route. Thus incumbent airline operators could raise barriers to the challenge of new competition. This system was dismantled as a result of the Airline Deregulation Act. (See also the Centennial of Flight Commission) It also dismantled the notion of a flag carrier. Post-deregulation In the wake of deregulation, airlines have adopted new strategies and consumers are experiencing a new market. Below are the marquee effects of deregulation. =Hub and spoke= Airlines quickly moved to a hub-and-spoke system, whereby an airline selected an airport, the hub, as the destination point for flights from a number of origination cities, the spokes. Because the size of the planes used varied according to the travel on that spoke, and since hubs allowed passenger travel to be consolidated in \\"transfer stations\\", capacity utilization increased. The hub-and-spoke model survives among the legacy carriers, but the low-cost carriers (LCCs), now 30 percent of the market, typically fly point to point. The network hubs model offers consumers more convenience for routes, but point-to-point routes have proven less costly for airlines to implement. Over time, the legacy carriers and the LCCs will likely use some combination of point to point and network hubs to capture both economies of scale and pricing advantages.Smith Jr F. L., Cox B., Airline Deregulation, The Concise Encyclopedia of Economics, Liberty Fund Inc., 2. Edition, 2007 =Price= Base ticket prices have declined steadily since deregulation. The inflation adjusted 1982 constant dollar yield for airlines has fallen from 12.3 cents in 1978 to 7.9 cents in 1997. Along with rising US. populations and the increasing demand of work-force-mobility, these trends were some of the catalysts for dramatic expansion in passenger miles flown, increasing from 250 million passenger miles in 1978 to 750 million passenger miles in 2005. As such, some think tanks and the U.S. airline trade organization, Airlines for America,http://www.docstoc.com/docs/document- preview.aspx?doc_id=173460020 argue that deregulation has provided benefits to the average air traveler. =Service quality= The quality of airline service can be measured in many different ways, including the number of aircraft departures, the total number of miles flown, seating comfort, punctuality of service, other programs and services, and various frills or amenities. Over the past several years the public's view of airline service quality has shown a significant drop. Johnsson, Julie, Airline industry the worst in customer ratings, Chicago Tribune, May 20, 2008, According to the 2008 American Customer Satisfaction Index, a University of Michigan study of 80,000 consumers' expectations and preferences, the major US airlines ranked last among all the industries surveyed. In 2009, the airlines have moved up to being one point ahead of Cable & Satellite TV and the newspaper industry (though results for all industries were not available at the time of this writing).American Customer Satisfaction Index, Scores by Industry, Sep 14, 2009 In 2011 Congress finally responded to repeated calls for the United States government to pass an \\"Air Passenger Bill of Rights\\" to provide specific requirements about what must happen to air passengers in certain conditions.Martin, Hugo, Support is growing for a fliers' bill of rights, Sep 12, 2009, The push for the bill stemmed from several high-profile passenger strandings over the last several years. On April 25, 2011, the Enhancing Airline Passenger Protections rule, 76 Fed. Reg. 32,110, was enacted. Amongst other items, the rule includes raising the minimum \\"denied boarding compensation\\" to customers with valid tickets yet still not allowed to board the aircraft. The legislation further penalizes airlines up to $27,500 a passenger if left stranded aboard an aircraft, on a tarmac for more than three hours. In 2010, the largest trade associations representing airline management interests before Capitol Hill, Airlines for America and the Regional Airline Association, opposed this legislation stating that they could self-regulate themselves and they already had begun implementing systems by which to mitigate any tarmac delays. Later American Eagle, an RAA airline member, was the first airline to be fined under the new legislation. A total settlement including fines and compensation paid to passengers totaled $800,000 for tarmac delays incurred in Chicago in May 2011. Deregulation advocate Alfred Kahn noted a deterioration in the quality of airline service following deregulation, including the \\"turmoil\\" of massive restructuring of airline routes, price wars, conflicts with airline employee unions, airline bankruptcies, and industry consolidation.Kahn, Alfred E. \\"Surprises of Deregulation.\\" The American Economic Review. 78 (2): 316‚Äì322. He also noted unexpected congestion and delays \\"that have plagued air travelers in recent years\\". However, he also argued that such congestion and delays was also a sign of deregulation success (because it indicated a large increase in passenger volume due to decreases in the price of airfares). Kahn considered the turmoil, congestion, and delays to be unforeseen \\"surprises\\" from deregulation and continued to support deregulation in spite of these events. =Competition between carriers= Competing carriers at Tokyo Narita Airport, Japan A major goal of airline deregulation was to increase competition between airline carriers, leading to price decreases. As a result of deregulation, barriers to entry into the airlines industry for a potential new airline decreased significantly, resulting in many new airlines entering the market, thus increasing competition. =Industry consolidation and reduction in competition between carriers = After airline deregulation, many airlines in the United States were purchased by other airlines and merged into fewer airlines \\"after thirty five years and hundreds of new startup airlines, hundreds of bankruptcies, liquidations, reorganizations, and mergers\\", wrote Richard Finger, equities trader and finance business analyst at Forbes.com.Finger, Richard. \\"Why American Airlines Employees Loathe Management\\" April 29, 2013. Accessed at: https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardfinger/2013/04/29/why-american-airlines- employees-loathe-management/ This has resulted in just 4 major US airlines (United Airlines, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, and Southwest Airlines) controlling a near-monopoly (up to 90%) of both the domestic market and the gates at some regional airports in the United States. For example, United Airlines (with its merger/purchase of Continental Airlines in 2012) now controls over 90 percent of domestic travel in and out of Houston Intercontinental Airport; \\"many flights have been consolidated so travelers have fewer choices\\", resulting in increased fares. Thus, the current situation in the airline industry benefits the airlines, by decreasing competition among airlines, increasing fares for airline passengers, decreasing airline employee pay and benefits (especially pensions), and creating an oligopoly of only four major airlines that was never intended (unintended consequences) by the framers of airline deregulation act. =Effects on airline staff= A key indicator of the volatility of deregulation; from 1976 to 1986 the US. airlines saw a 39% increase in employees (according to Alfred Kahn), and saw continued but less rapid growth throughout the 1990s. Subsequently, between 2000 and 2008, the same industry shed 100,000 jobs - approximately 20% - and formerly busy hub airports (such as Pittsburgh and St. Louis) have reduced staffs due to a significantly decreased number of flights. Immediately following the September 11th attacks, the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act bestowed the US airlines with $15 billion in loans and an additional $5 billion in grants by the US. government. Despite these loans and grants, nearly every major carrier fired 20% of its staff, with United and American both cutting 20,000 jobs. This makes it very difficult to determine the precise job losses due to the effects of deregulation. Then-retired former CEO of American Airlines Robert Crandall stated, \\"I'm not sure 9/11 by itself had any particular profound impact [on the industry], but it exacerbated the problems they had before 9/11.\\" Although regular pay-cuts had become commonplace in the years following deregulation, of the employees remaining after September 11, 2001, the average pay cut has been 18%, with many of the highest earners seeing as much as 40% reductions, virtually every regularly scheduled airline has shifted its pension obligations to its employees. According to a study by economist David Card, deregulation resulted in the shift of approximately 5,000 to 7,000 airline mechanic jobs from the major trunk airlines to smaller carriers between 1978 and 1984.Card, David. \\"The Impact of Deregulation on the Employment and Wages of Airline Mechanics.\\" Industrial and Labor Relations Review. 39 (4): 527-538 (July 1986). http://davidcard.berkeley.edu/papers/dereg-emp-wage.pdf Because such smaller carriers typically pay less than the major airlines, the average hourly wage of airline mechanics decreased by up to 5 percent; however, the author considered this decrease to be relatively small.Card, David. \\"The Impact of Deregulation on the Employment and Wages of Airline Mechanics.\\" Industrial and Labor Relations Review. 39 (4): 527-538 (July 1986). =Open Skies= Beyond the domestic liberalization of the airlines in the US, Open Skies agreements are bilateral agreements between the US and other countries to open the aviation market to foreign access and remove barriers to competition. They give airlines the right to operate air services from any point in the US to any point in the other country, as well as to and from third countries. The first major Open Skies agreements were entered into in 1979. The U.S. has Open Skies agreements with more than 60 countries, including fifteen of the 28 EU nations. Open Skies agreements have been successful at removing many of the government implemented barriers to competition and allowing airlines to have foreign partners, access to international routes to and from their home countries and freedom from many traditional forms of economic regulation. Criticisms With long standing companies like Braniff, TWA, and Pan Am disappearing through bankruptcy since 1978, the years since 2000 have seen every remaining legacy carrier file for bankruptcy at least once. US Airways filed twice in the same number of years. During the same time period, Southwest Airlines continued to expand its route structure, buy new airplanes, and hire more employees, while remaining profitable. JetBlue, a new airline that started up in 1999, \\"was one of only a few U.S. airlines that made a profit during the sharp downturn in airline travel following the September 11, 2001 attacks. For many years, analysts had predicted that JetBlue's growth rate would become unsustainable. Despite this, the airline continued to add planes and routes to the fleet at a brisk pace. JetBlue is one of the largest airlines in the Northeast United States.\\" Unions contend that airline management now uses bankruptcy as a tool to liquidate labor contracts. Progressives view this as union-busting, allowing management to throw out contracts already agreed upon while still receiving exorbitant bonuses themselves, regardless of work quality. In doing so, according to the labor union view, airline executive management has created what many are calling the great race to the bottom with one company filing for bankruptcy after the next, leaving only those who have not filed for bankruptcy, paying their employees what was contractually agreed upon. One of the key elements deregulation sought to end were airline oligopolies and monopolies. However, since 2010 the number of major airlines has receded dramatically. With Delta merging with NorthWest, American merging with US Airways, United merging with Continental, SouthWest with AirTran, and Frontier being purchased by Republic who also owns Chautauqua and Midwest Express and bought Shuttle America in 2005, it has been suggested that the old monopolies and oligopolies still exist regardless of regulation. Instead of using their political connections to keep competition out, now, larger airlines simply price-war new entrants out of business, or simply buy them. This leaves the weaker airlines to merge, eliminating market choices and creating an oligopoly market. Various solutions have been proposed by labor unions, former management and industry analysts, including, for the first time since 1978, federal control over some of the prices charged and routes served by major airlinesPoole, R. W. Jr., Butler V., Airline Deregulation: The Unfinished Revolution, December 1998. with a view of increasing price and cost competition. In June 2008 former CEO of American Airlines, Robert Crandall stated, Crandall has also criticized deregulation for causing airlines to cut service to smaller airports, resulting in a \\"relatively unsatisfactory transportation network;\\" he argues that this \\"has accelerated the movement of people towards the big cities and has discouraged the creation of medium-sized cities.\\" Notes Source 1 needs updating to Table 1-37: U.S. Air Carrier Aircraft Departures, Enplaned Revenue Passengers, and Enplaned Revenue Tons  Bureau of Transportation Statistics.

This philosophy tends to favour communitarian social policies, while maintaining a degree of fiscal discipline and a respect of social and political order. It is contrasted with \\"Blue Tory\\" or \\"High Tory\\". Some Red Tories view themselves as small-c conservatives. In Canada, Red Toryism is found in provincial and federal Conservative political parties. The history of Red Toryism marks differences in the development of the political cultures of Canada and the United States. Canadian conservatism and American conservatism have been different from each other in fundamental ways, including their stances on social issues and the role of government in society.\\"Conservatism\\", The Canadian Encyclopedia Red Tory governments in Canada, such as those of Sir John A. Macdonald, Sir Robert Borden, R. B. Bennett, and John Diefenbaker, were known for supporting an active role for the government in the economy. This included the creation of government- operated Crown Corporations such as the Canadian National Railway, and the development and protection of Canadian industries with programs such as the National Policy. The adjective \\"red\\" refers to the economically left-leaning nature of Red Toryism in comparison with Blue Toryism, since socialist and other leftist parties have traditionally used the colour red. In Canada today, however, red is commonly associated with the centre-left Liberal Party. The term reflects the broad ideological range traditionally found within conservatism in Canada. Canada =Philosophy= Historically, Canadian conservatism has been derived from the Tory tradition, with a distinctive concern for a balance between individual rights and collectivism, as mediated through a traditional pre-industrial standard of morality ‚Äì which has never been as evident in American conservatism. Red Toryism derives largely from a classical conservative tradition that maintained that the unequal division of wealth and political privilege among social classes can be justified if members of the privileged class practiced noblesse oblige and contributed to the common good. Red Tories supported traditional institutions such as religion and the monarchy, and maintenance of the social order. This position was later manifest in their support for some aspects of the welfare state. This belief in a common good, as expanded on in Colin Campbell and William Christian's Political Parties and Ideologies in Canada, is at the root of Red Toryism. =Origins= In distinction to the American experience where class divisions were seen as undemocratic (although still existing), Canadian Tories adopted a more paternalistic view of government. Monarchy, public order and good government ‚Äì understood as dedication to the common good ‚Äì preceded, moderated and balanced a belief in individual rights and liberty. Anthony Hall has argued that Red Toryism in Canada developed specifically in opposition to the American Revolution and its ideology. \\"The Red Tory heritage is rooted in opposition to the Anglo-American secessionists that founded the United States. The Anglo-American rejection of the British Empire bears some resemblances to the Zionist rejection of the British mandate in Palestine or the Afrikaner rejection of the Aboriginal policies of the British rulers of South Africa as expressed in the Great Trek inland of the 1830s. All of these secessionist movements were motivated by an unwillingness to accept imposition of British rules in the relationship with Indigenous peoples. The founders of the US began their enterprise by instigating a civil war in British North America. They were helped in their quest to be freed of British imperial constraints to their rapid westward expansion by a formal alliance with the French monarchy and informally by many Whig supporters in Great Britain.\\" This type of Canadian conservatism is derived largely from the Tory tradition developed by English conservative thinkers and statesmen such as Richard Hooker; the seventh Earl of Shaftesbury; and Benjamin Disraeli, later the first Earl of Beaconsfield. The primary influences on Canadian Toryism in the Victorian age were Disraeli's One Nation Conservatism and the radical Toryism advocated by Lord Randolph Churchill. Inherent in these Tory traditions was the ideal of noblesse oblige and a conservative communitarianism. In Victorian times these ideas were the pre-eminent strains of conservative thought in the British Empire, and were advanced by many in the Tory faction of Sir John A. Macdonald's conservative coalition in the Canadas. None of this lineage denies that Tory traditions of communitarianism and collectivism had existed in the British North American colonies since the Loyalist exodus from the American colonies between 1776 and 1796. It is this aspect that is one of the primary points of difference between the conservative political cultures of Canada and the United States.Christian, William Edward and C. Campbell, Political Parties and Ideologies in Canada (Note: several editions of this textbook have appeared since 1974, reflecting the changes in Canada's politics.) The explicit notion of a \\"Red\\" Toryism was developed by Gad Horowitz in the 1960s, who argued that there was a significant Tory ideology in Canada.Horowitz, Gad. \\"Conservatism, Liberalism and Socialism in Canada: An Interpretation.\\" Canadian Journal of Political Science (1966) This vision contrasted Canada with the United States, which was seen as lacking this collectivist tradition because it was expunged from the American political culture after the American Revolution and the exodus of the United Empire Loyalists. Horowitz argued that Canada's stronger socialist movement grew from Toryism, and that this explains why socialism has never had much electoral success in the United States. This also meant that Canadian conceptions of liberty were more collective and communitarian, and could be seen as more directly derivative of the English tradition, than that of American practices and theories. Horowitz identified George Grant and Eugene Forsey as exemplars of this strain of thought, which saw a central role for Christianity in public affairs and was profoundly critical of capitalism and the dominant business √©lites. Forsey became a Co- operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) member, while Grant remained a Conservative ‚Äì although he became disdainful of an overall shift in policy toward liberal economics and continentalism, something Forsey saw happening decades earlier. When the Conservative government of John Diefenbaker fell in 1963, largely due to the BOMARC controversy, Grant wrote Lament for a Nation: The Defeat of Canadian Nationalism, a book about the nature of traditional Canadian nationhood and independence that would become a lodestar of Red Toryism. Grant defined an essential difference between the founding of the Canadian and American nations when he wrote \\"Canada was predicated on the rights of nations as well as on the rights of individuals.\\"Grant, George. Lament for a Nation: The Defeat of Canadian Nationalism. 40th Anniversary Edition. Carleton Library Series. p.22 This definition recognized Canada's multi-faceted founding nature as an English-speaking, aboriginal and Francophone nation. =Predominance and decline= Many of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada's leaders have been labelled 'Red Tories', including Sir John A. Macdonald, Sir Robert Borden, John Diefenbaker, Robert Stanfield and Joe Clark. Many others have been influential as cabinet ministers and thinkers, such as E. Davie Fulton, Dalton Camp, Roy McMurtry and John Farthing.Christian, William Edward and C. Campbell, Parties, Leaders and Ideologies in Canada The main bastions of Red Toryism were Ontario, the Atlantic provinces and urban Manitoba, areas where the Red Tories dominated provincial politics, and in some federal elections Quebec, where the federal PC party operated largely separately from provincial politics. The Ontario Progressive Conservative Party, which has held power in that province for most of the time since Confederation, was often labelled as Red Tory, especially under the leadership of Bill Davis from 1971 to 1985. Throughout the Atlantic provinces, traditional Red Tories are the dominant force in the provincial Progressive Conservative parties because of their support of the welfare state. The Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta included a broad spectrum from Red Tories to social conservatives, but Peter Lougheed who led the party from 1968 to 1985 and was Premier from 1971 to 1985 was a Red Tory and Lougheed's tenure was characterized by active economic measures and social reforms. The dominance of Red Toryism can be seen as a part of the international post-war consensus that saw the welfare state embraced by the major parties of most of the western world. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, however, the federal Progressive Conservative Party suffered a string of electoral defeats under Red Tory leaders Robert Stanfield and Joe Clark. Pressure began to grow within the party for a new approach. Clark's leadership was successfully challenged, and in the 1983 PC leadership convention, members endorsed Brian Mulroney who rejected free trade with the United States as proposed by another Blue Tory candidate, John Crosbie. Despite this early perception, the eagerness in which Mulroney's ministry embraced the MacDonald Commission's advocacy of bilateral free trade would come to indicate a sharp drift toward libertarian or liberal economic policies, comparable to such contemporaries as Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher. Following Mulroney, the Canadian conservative movement suffered a profound schism in the 1993 election, splitting into the distinct Progressive Conservative and Reform parties. The Red Tory tradition remained loyal to the Progressive Conservatives, while many \\"blue\\" Tories aligned with social conservatives in the Reform Party. Various Unite the Right efforts achieved only modest success in the 1990s and early 2000s ‚Äì most notably, while the creation of the Canadian Alliance in 2000 attracted a small number of Progressive Conservatives, it failed to attract those in the Red Tory tradition or to replace the Progressive Conservatives. After the victory of Peter MacKay at the 2003 PC convention, and in violation of an informal contract signed with rival candidate David Orchard, MacKay merged the Tories with Stephen Harper's Alliance to create the modern federal Conservative Party in 2003. When first created, one of the most important issues facing the Conservative Party was what Red Tories would do. The union resulted in a number of Red Tories leaving the new party, either to retire or to cross the floor to the Liberal Party. Members of Parliament (MPs) Andr√© Bachand, John Herron, Joe Clark and Scott Brison declined to join the new party ‚Äì Brison immediately crossed the floor to the Liberals, Bachand and Clark sat out the remainder of the 37th Canadian Parliament as Progressive Conservatives and then retired from office in the 2004 election, and Herron sat as a Progressive Conservative for the remainder of the term but then ran for re-election in 2004 as a Liberal. Clark, a former Prime Minister, gave a tepid endorsement to the Liberals in the 2004 election, calling Paul Martin \\"the devil we know\\".\\"Joe Clark says he'd choose Martin over Harper\\", CTV News, April 26, 2004. Rick Borotsik joined the new party but openly criticized it from within, did not run for re-election in 2004, and also publicly endorsed the Liberals over the Conservatives during the campaign. Additionally, three of the twenty-six Progressive Conservative Senators, Lowell Murray, Norman Atkins and William Doody, decided to continue serving as Progressive Conservatives, rejecting membership in the new party. Atkins, who died in 2010, remained allied with the still-existent Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario, and Murray, from Atlantic Canada, opposed the merger of the federal PC party. Most, like prominent Senator Marjory LeBreton, came to endorse the new party and have been vocal and visible supporters of the party both between and during elections. Elaine McCoy and Nancy Ruth were later appointed to the Senate by Liberal Prime Minister Paul Martin, and chose to designate themselves as Progressive Conservatives. Doody has since died, and Ruth joined the Conservative Party caucus in 2006. Despite the union, some former Progressive Conservative members still identify themselves as Red Tory, including high-profile political strategist turned Senator Hugh Segal, who in 2013 continued to describe himself as a Red Tory, which has put him at increasing odds with the government on several occasions. A 'grassroots' movement of dissenting Red Tories, who opposed the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada's merger with the Canadian Alliance, gathered signatures on Elections Canada forms from over 200 Progressive Conservative members and applied to re-register as the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada. This name was refused by Elections Canada. Having anticipated such a rejection, the coordinators had had the 'SignaTories' also sign a second application to at least continue with the ballot name \\"PC Party\\". On March 26, 2004 the Progressive Canadian Party was registered with Elections Canada. It aimed to be perceived as a continuation of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada, but achieved only very minor results. The party achieved its largest vote to date in the 2006 election, with 14,151 votes in 25 ridings (about 0.1% of the nationwide total). The party was deregistered by the Chief Electoral Officer of Canada on November 30, 2019 for failing to comply with Canada Elections Act requirements set out in subsection 415(1). =Revival in provincial politics= In the wake of the rise of the conservative Wildrose Party in Alberta in the 2010s, the term \\"Red Tory\\" has been revived as a name of the moderate wing of the Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta, which was seen to be in ascendence under the leadership of Ed Stelmach and Allison Redford. Redford is closely associated with centrist Tories Joe Clark and Peter Lougheed, as opposed to Wildrose leader Danielle Smith's association with right-wing Tories Ralph Klein and Tom Flanagan. Redford was called a Red Tory by Chantal H√©bert, Ezra Levant and others. United Kingdom In 2009 Phillip Blond promoted communitarian traditionalist conservatism ideas within the Conservative Party with a book titled Red Tory: How Left and Right Have Broken Britain and How We Can Fix It and by creating the think-tank ResPublica. Leader of the Conservative Party David Cameron spoke at ResPublica's launch and Red Tory ideas were said to be a major influence on him. In Scotland, the term \\"Red Tory\\" has been used to describe the Scottish Labour Party, who some see as assisting with, or failing to oppose, certain Conservative policies. The term was first used in this context by Scottish independence supporters, following Labour's participation in the Better Together campaign in opposition to Scottish independence alongside the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats during the 2014 Scottish independence referendum. Evolving from the Scottish usage of the term, the term, along with the terms Blairite and \\"centrist\\", have been used, particularly on social media, as a derogatory term by some members on the political left of the Labour Party to refer to MPs and Labour Party figures who do not show sufficient support for Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader elected in 2015. Definition drift The term Red Tory is often used today in the media not to refer to those in the tradition of George Grant, Dalton Camp or Robert Stanfield, but simply to moderates in the conservative movement, particularly those who reject or do not sufficiently embrace social conservatism. For example, in the 2004 Conservative Party leadership election, Tony Clement was sometimes referred to as a Red Tory even though he advocated privatization, tax cuts, curtailment of social and economic development spending, and free trade with the United States. Traditional Red Tories would reject most if not all of these stances. More recently Phillip Blond, director of British think tank ResPublica, has gained traction with his so-called Red Tory thesis which criticizes what he refers to as the welfare state and the market state. Phillip Blond promotes a radical communitarian traditionalist conservatism. It inveighs against welfare states as well as market monopolies and instead respects traditional values and institutions, localism, devolution of powers from the central governments to local communities, small businesses, and volunteerism. Blond also favours empowering social enterprises, charities and other elements of civil society to solve problems such as poverty.\\"Rise of the Red Tories\\", Prospect Magazine, February 2009 He has been mentioned as a major influence on the thinking of David Cameron and other Tories in the wake of the 2008 credit crisis. He advocates a civic state as the ideal, where the common good of society is valued and solutions emerge from local communities. Blond's ideas also parallel the socioeconomic tradition of distributism, as is evidenced by Blond's appearance at a distributist conference at Oxford University in 2009 sponsored by the G. K. Chesterton Institute for Faith and Culture. Blond's Red Toryism has been embraced by traditionalist conservatives in the United States, such as journalists Rod Dreher and economist John Medaille. The editors of the web log Front Porch Republic, however, define Red Toryism as a \\"left or socialist conservatism\\" and further go on to say that it is \\"not a traditionalism that happened to oddly pick up a few egalitarian rhetorical tropes along the way.\\" This is more in keeping with the typical dictionary definition of the term as: \\"(Canadian) a Conservative who holds liberal or mildly socialist views on certain fiscal and social issues.\\" In this regard, Phillip Blond's views are probably closer to what has been referred to as High Tory.

The society was organized to advance the science and art of cinematography and gather a wide range of cinematographers to discuss techniques and ideas and to advocate for motion pictures as a type of art form. Currently, the president of the ASC is Kees van Oostrum. Members use the post-nominal letters \\"ASC\\". On the 1920 film titled Sand, cinematographer Joseph H. August, who was an original member of the ASC, became the first individual to have the \\"ASC\\" appear after his name on the onscreen credit. Only film cinematographers and special effect supervisors can become an ASC member. Basic requirements include being a director of photography for a minimum five out of the last eight years, having a high professional reputation and being recommended by three active or retired ASC members.  History  In the beginning of cinema, directors and photographers in the United States had a similar problem: they had \\"big, ugly white streaks\\" that resulted from static electricity discharged from the cameras. Two separate groups in the United States worked together to find a solution to this problem. The two groups were the Cinema Camera Club and the Static Club of America. A precursor to the ASC, the Cinema Camera Club in New York City was founded in 1913 by Arthur Miller, Phil Rosen, and Frank Kugler. Arthur and his brother, William Miller, both filmmakers in New York City, worked together and established a union for cinematography workers called the Motion Picture Industry Union. Miller left to work in Hollywood, California, one year after the Motion Picture Industry Union was formed. In 1918, Phil Rosen asked the president of the Cinema Camera Club of California, Charles Rosher, whether he could help reorganize the association by creating a national organization with \\"membership by invitation and a strong educational component\\". This reorganisation and the setup of the bylaws occurred on December 21, 1918. The ASC was officially authorized by the State of California on January 8, 1919. In 2014, the ASC admitted its first member with no background in live action feature film, Pixar's Sharon Calahan, who had worked entirely in computer animation. The society started the ASC Master Class education program in the same year (2014). This program allows members of the ASC and other professionals to teach students from all walks of life on various subjects including composition, lighting, angles, creating mood among other techniques of visual storytelling. In 2017, John Bailey, an ASC member, was elected as the president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, making him the first cinematographer to take up such a position.  Publications  In the 1920s, the ASC began printing a four-page newsletter titled The American Cinematographer in 1920. According to the ASC, \\"The American Cinematographer covers the technology and artistry of visual storytelling, offering print and digital editions.\\" Within this publication a wide range of cinematographer and technical information was produced through a variety of means such as interviews, articles, blogs and podcasts. Other than the magazine, the ASC also publishes the American Cinematographer Manual. The first edition was published in 1935 by Jackson J. Rose as The American Cinematographer Hand Book and Reference Guide. The Hand Book evolved from the Cinematographic Annual only published twice, in 1930 and 1931. Rose's handbook went through nine editions by the middle of the 1950s, and it was from this book that the modern American Cinematographer Manual originated. The first edition of the new manual was published in 1960 and is now in its 10th edition, published in 2016.  Founding members  *Phil Rosen *Homer Scott *William C. Foster *L. D.

UNC Pembroke is a master's level degree-granting university and part of the University of North Carolina system. Its history is intertwined with that of the Lumbee nation. History The educational institution that developed into UNC Pembroke has its origins in the circumstances of the post Civil War South. This school was a part of the effort of the Lumbee Nation in North Carolina to preserve their unique identity. Access and authority over their own educational system was understood to be of key importance to retaining Lumbee culture, instilling a sense of pride, and to improving the groups economic and social conditions. Croatan Normal School was created by the General Assembly on March 7, 1887 in response to a local petition, sponsored by North Carolina Representative Hamilton McMillian of Robeson County. This event occurred in the context of competition for support between the Democratic and Republican parties in North Carolina. Hamilton MacMillian's support for the school was connected to his personnel interest and research on Native American history and culture. The school's initial name, Croatan Normal School, was selected in accordance with the debatable view that this tribe were descendants of the Outer Banks Lost Colony of Sir Walter Raleigh. It opened in the fall of 1887 with one teacher and 15 students. With the goal of training American Indian public school teachers. Initially enrollment was limited to the American Indians of Robeson County. In this period school enrollment was often quite limited among the general population. Funding by the state was patchy at best and there was high level of illiteracy. The creation of a centralized training school for teachers was thought to be the best method of addressing this problem in the given circumstances. In 1909, the school moved to its present location, about a mile east of the original site. The name was changed in 1911 to the Indian Normal School of Robeson County, and again in 1913 to the Cherokee Indian Normal School of Robeson County, tracking the legislature's designation for the Indians of the county, who at one time claimed Cherokee descent. In 1926 the school became a two-year post-secondary normal school; until then it had provided only primary and secondary instruction. In 1939 it became a four-year institution, and in 1941 was renamed Pembroke State College for Indians. The next year, the school began to offer bachelor's degrees in disciplines other than teaching. In 1945 the college was opened to members of all federally recognized tribes. A change of name to Pembroke State College in 1949 presaged the admission of white students, which was approved in 1953 for up to forty percent of total enrollment. The Brown v. Board of Education ruling the following year by the United States Supreme Court ended race restrictions at the college. Between 1939 and 1953, Pembroke State was the only state supported four-year college for Indians in the United States. In 1969 the college became Pembroke State University, a regional university that was incorporated into the University of North Carolina system in 1972. The first master's degree program was implemented in 1978. On July 1, 1996, Pembroke State University became The University of North Carolina at Pembroke. On March 14, 2012, UNC Pembroke began a 14-month celebration of its 125th anniversary, to conclude with the spring 2013 Commencement ceremonies in May 2013. Campus The water feature at UNCP. Belk Hall and North Hall are in the background. The university's campus is situated just north of Pembroke, located directly behind N.C. Highway 711. Interstate 74 is located just minutes from campus, as is Interstate 95. The center of campus is considered to be the Chavis University Center (often referred to as the University Center, or the UC). Students can bowl, play pool and related games, or just hang out in the lounge. The dining hall and Chick-fil-A are located in the UC. The UC lawn, an open grass area in front of the UC, is where students play amateur sports, read on benches, or use the area for free speech. Faculty Row, a thoroughfare for university traffic, essentially divides the campus into east and west sections. The eastern side of campus includes the Livermore Library, Oxendine Science Building, Old Main, and Wellons Hall, among other buildings. The campus on the west side has the Business Administration Building, Education Center, and most of the residence hall communities such as Oak Hall, Pine Hall, North, and Belk. Lumbee Hall, the Dial Humanities building, the Sampson building, Auxiliary building, the Jones Athletic Center and the Givens Performing Arts Center make up most of the north end of campus. New to campus is Cypress Hall, a residence hall, which opened in August 2011. In addition, the Weinstein Health Sciences Building, which houses Papa John's Pizza, Einstein Bros. Bagels, and the nursing program, opened in August 2012. The Brave Health Center opened on the north end of campus in 2017. The Givens Performing Arts Center hosts numerous Broadway shows, orchestras, shows geared towards children, and also hosts the \\"Distinguished Speaker Series,\\" in cooperation with the Association of Campus Entertainment, which has brought in notable people such as Cory Booker, Bill Nye, Jodi Sweetin, Patch Adams, Gabby Douglas and Hill Harper, among many others. Organization The title of Principal or Superintendent was used prior to 1940. After 1940, when UNC Pembroke became a collegiate-level institution, the title of President was used. Upon becoming a member institution of the University of North Carolina system, the title was changed to Chancellor. =Presidents= * Dr. O. H. Browne (1940‚Äì1942) * Dr. Ralph D.

Their names may have originally come from an epigram written by poet John Byrom. The nursery rhyme has a Roud Folk Song Index number of 19800. The names have since become synonymous in western popular culture slang for any two people who look and act in identical ways, generally in a derogatory context. Lyrics Common versions of the nursery rhyme include: :Tweedledum and Tweedledee : Agreed to have a battle; :For Tweedledum said Tweedledee : Had spoiled his nice new rattle. :Just then flew down a monstrous crow, : As black as a tar-barrel; :Which frightened both the heroes so, : They quite forgot their quarrel.I. Opie and P. Opie, The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes (Oxford University Press, 1951, 2nd edn., 1997), p. 418. Origins The words \\"Tweedle-dum and Tweedle-dee\\" make their first appearance in print as names applied to the composers George Frideric Handel and Giovanni Bononcini in \\"one of the most celebrated and most frequently quoted (and sometimes misquoted) epigrams\\", satirising disagreements between Handel and Bononcini, written by John Byrom (1692‚Äì1763):C.Edgar Thomas: Some Musical Epigrams and Poems, The Musical Times, November 1, (1915), p. 661. in his satire, from 1725. :Some say, compar'd to Bononcini :That Mynheer Handel's but a Ninny :Others aver, that he to Handel :Is scarcely fit to hold a Candle :Strange all this Difference should be :'Twixt Tweedle-dum and Tweedle- dee!John Byrom: Epigram on the Feuds between Handel and Bononcini, The Poems, The Chetham Society 1894‚Äì1895. Source: Literature Online. Although Byrom is clearly the author of the epigram, the last two lines have also been attributed to Jonathan Swift and Alexander Pope. While the familiar form of the rhyme was not printed until around 1805, when it appeared in Original Ditties for the Nursery, it is possible that Byrom was drawing on an existing rhyme.M. Gardner, ed., The Annotated Alice (New York: Meridian, 1963). Lewis Carroll and John Tenniel The characters are perhaps best known from Lewis Carroll's Through the Looking-Glass and what Alice Found There (1871). Carroll, having introduced two fat little men named Tweedledum and Tweedledee, quotes the nursery rhyme, which the two brothers then go on to enact. They agree to have a battle, but never have one. When they see a monstrous black crow swooping down, they take to their heels. The Tweedle brothers never contradict each other, even when one of them, according to the rhyme, \\"agrees to have a battle\\". Rather, they complement each other's words. This fact has led Tenniel to assume that they are twins, and Gardner goes so far as to claim that Carroll intended them to be enantiomorphs ‚Äî three-dimensional mirror images. Evidence for these assumptions cannot be found in any of Lewis Carroll's writings. Other depictions * In a 1921 letter to Harriet Shaw Weaver, the writer James Joyce uses the twins \\"Tweedledum and Tweedledee\\" to characterize Sigmund Freud and Carl Gustav Jung and their conflict.James Joyce: Letter to Harriet Shaw Weaver. 24 June 1921 * Helen Keller said of democracy in the US: \\"Our democracy is but a name. We vote? What does that mean? It means that we choose between two bodies of real, though not avowed, autocrats. We choose between Tweedledum and Tweedledee.\\"Howard Zinn, A People's History of the United States Harper Perennial Classics, 2005. p.345 . * Tweedledum and Tweedledee appear in the 1934 Betty Boop short film Betty in Blunderland using their clubs to battle only for them to duck their heads into their shirts and surrender. * Tweedledum and Tweedledee appear in the 1951 version of Alice in Wonderland,J.

The project would carry teachers into space as Payload Specialists (non-astronaut civilians), who would return to their classrooms to share the experience with their students. NASA cancelled the program in 1990, following the death of its first participant, Christa McAuliffe, in the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster (STS-51-L) on January 28, 1986. NASA replaced Teachers in Space in 1998 with the Educator Astronaut Project, which required its participants to become astronaut Mission Specialists. The first Educator Astronauts were selected as part of NASA Astronaut Group 19 in 2004. Barbara Morgan, who was selected as a Mission Specialist as part of NASA Astronaut Group 17 in 1998, has often been incorrectly referred to as an Educator Astronaut. However, she was selected as a Mission Specialist before the Educator Astronaut Project.Michael Griffin, NASA TV: STS-118 Post-Landing briefing Barbara Morgan and Christa McAuliffe, backup and primary TISP participants for Mission STS-51-L NASA programs TISP was announced by President Ronald Reagan on August 27, 1984. Not members of NASA's Astronaut Corps, the teachers would fly as Payload Specialists and return to their classrooms after flight. More than 40,000 applications were mailed to interested teachers while 11,000 teachers sent completed applications to NASA. Each application included a potential lesson that would be taught from space while on the Space Shuttle. The applications were sorted and then sent to the various State Departments of Education, who were then responsible for narrowing down their state applicants to a final set of two each. These 114 applicants were notified of their selections and were gathered together for further selection processes down to ten finalists. These were then trained for a time, and in 1985 NASA selected Christa McAuliffe to be the first teacher in space, with Barbara Morgan as her backup. McAuliffe was a high school social studies teacher from Concord, New Hampshire. She planned to teach two 15-minute lessons from the Space Shuttle. McAuliffe died in the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster (STS-51-L) on January 28, 1986. After the accident, Reagan spoke on national television and assured the nation that the Teacher in Space program would continue. \\"We'll continue our quest in space\\", he said. \\"There will be more shuttle flights and more shuttle crews and, yes, more volunteers, more civilians, more teachers in space. Nothing ends here; our hopes and our journeys continue.\\" However, NASA decided in 1990 that spaceflight was still too dangerous to risk the lives of civilian teachers, and eliminated the Teacher in Space project. Morgan returned to teaching in Idaho and later became a Mission Specialist on STS-118. =Educator Astronaut Project= Barbara Morgan, Mission Specialist and backup for the Teacher in Space Project, speaks to an audience of students and media during a January 2007 demonstration at Space Center Houston. In January 1998, NASA replaced the Teacher In Space project with the Educator Astronaut Project. Instead of training teachers for five months as Payload Specialists who would return to the classroom, the Educator Astronaut program required selectees to give up their teaching careers, move to Houston, and become Mission Specialists (full- time NASA astronauts). The first Educator Astronauts were selected in 2004. The three selected in 2004 were Joseph Acaba, Richard Arnold, and Dorothy Metcalf-Lindenburger. Astronauts Acaba and Arnold flew on mission STS-119 in 2009, and Metcalf-Lindenburger flew aboard mission STS-131 in 2010. Although many sources incorrectly refer to Barbara Morgan as the first Educator Astronaut, in actuality, Morgan was selected as a Mission Specialist six years before the Educator Astronaut Project was put into place.Michael Griffin, NASA TV: STS-118 Post-Landing briefing Private program In the early 21st century, the Teacher in Space project was revived in the private sector. The development of reusable, suborbital launch vehicles by commercial companies makes it possible for nonprofit groups to contemplate sending large numbers of teachers into space. The new Teachers in Space program began in 2005. In March 2005, Teacher in Space candidate Pam Leestma, a second-grade teacher and cousin of Space Shuttle astronaut David Leestma, completed a training flight aboard a MiG-21 operated by X-Rocket, LLC. Armadillo Aerospace, Masten Space Systems, PlanetSpace, Rocketplane Limited, Inc., and XCOR Aerospace pledged flights to the new Teachers in Space project. Advisors to the new Teachers in Space project include SpaceShipOne builder and Ansari X-Prize winner Burt Rutan, X-Prize founder Peter Diamandis, Apollo astronaut Buzz Aldrin, and private astronaut and X-Prize sponsor Anousheh Ansari. The United States Rocket Academy partnered with the SFF in 2006, and worked to draft rules for a \\"pathfinder\\" competition to select the first Teachers in Space. The rules were announced at the Wirefly X PRIZE Cup Competition held at Holloman Air Force Base near Alamogordo, New Mexico in October 2007. Applications were accepted until November 4, 2008. On July 20, 2009, Teachers in Space announced its first group of \\"Pathfinders\\": astronaut teacher candidates. On June 11, 2013, Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University‚Äôs new Commercial Space Operations degree program, the first of its kind in the world, announced they will sponsor the Teachers in Space summer workshops for the next five years, indicating their intent toward a continuing long term relationship as well as their sharing a vision to \\"...help students, teachers and organizers collaborate in bringing space education to every level, from K-12 to graduate programs.\\" In 2014, Program director Elizabeth Kennick incorporated the Teachers in Space project as an educational nonprofit in New York, spinning it off from the Space Frontier Foundation. 5 original Pathfinders (James Kuhl, Rachael Manzer, Lanette Oliver, Chantelle Rose, and Michael Schmidt) remain with the program, also Vice President Joe Latrell and several teacher volunteers. Teachers in Space, Inc. has now flown two teacher/student designed experiments to International Space Station (ISS), launched and retrieved several high altitude balloons with data sensors, put teachers through astronaut training experiences including hypobaric chamber and centrifuge, and delivered weeklong professional development workshops for Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) teachers in California, Florida, Oklahoma, Texas, and Georgia.

In the French-inspired Matter of Britain, based on his portrayal in the Historia Regum Britanniae, Bedivere is described as being the Knight of the Round Table of King Arthur who serves as Arthur's marshal and eventually returns Excalibur to the Lady of the Lake. There, he is frequently associated with his brother Lucan and his cousin Griflet, as well as with Kay.  Bedwyr  In early Welsh sources, Bedwyr Bedrydant (\\"Bedwyr of the Perfect Sinew\\") is a handsome, one-handed warrior under Arthur's command. His father is given as Pedrawd or Bedrawd, and his children as Amhren and Eneuawg, both members of Arthur's court. One of the earliest direct references to Bedwyr can be found in the 10th-century poem Pa gur which recounts the exploits of a number of Arthur's men, including Bedwyr, Cei (Kay) and Manawydan. Of Bedwyr, this narrative says: :They fell by the hundred / before Bedwyr of the Perfect- Sinew. :On the shores of Tryfrwyd / fighting with Garwlwyd / furious was his nature / with sword and shield.Pa Gur The 9th-century version of Englynion y Beddau (\\"The Stanzas of the Graves\\") gives Bedwyr's final resting place on Tryfan. In the hagiography of Cadoc, Bedwyr is alongside Arthur and Cei in dealing with King Gwynllyw of Gwynllwg's abduction of Gwladys from her father's court in Brycheiniog. A possible allusion to Bedwyr could be found in the reference to Bedwyr's well in the 9th-century Marwnad Cadwallon ap Cadfan. The Welsh Triads name Bedwyr as \\"Battle-Diademed\\", and a superior to Drystan, Hueil mab Caw and even Cei.Bromwich, Rachel. Trioedd Ynys Prydein. A catchphrase often quipped by Cei, \\"by the hand of my friend\\" is likely a reference to Bedwyr's disability.Davies, Sioned. The Mabinogion. Oxford University Press, 2005. Bedwyr is a prominent character in the tale of Culhwch and Olwen, in which he appears at the head of Arthur's court list with his friend Cei and is described as the most handsome man in the world (save for Arthur and Drych fab Cibddar), and the wielder of a magic lance.S Davies trans, The Mabinogion (Oxford 2007) p. 189-90. He is called upon to accompany Culhwch on his quest to win Olwen's hand in marriage and is the first to strike the giant Ysbaddaden with the poisoned spear meant for Culhwch. Bedwyr goes on to assist Culhwch in completing the impossible tasks given to him by Ysbaddaden; he helps Cei and Goreu fab Custennin kill Wrnach the Giant, rescues Mabon ap Modron from his imprisonment, retrieves the hairs of Dillus the Bearded, captures the cauldron of Diwrnach during Arthur's attack on Ireland, and takes part in the hunting of Twrch Trwyth with Arthur's dog Cavall at his side.S Davies trans, The Mabinogion (Oxford 2007) p. 193 and p. 205-10. The tale ends with the completion of the tasks, the humiliation and death of Ysbaddaden, and the marriage of Culhwch and Olwen.  Bedivere  Bedivere is one of Arthur's loyal allies in Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regum Britanniae and maintains this position in much later Arthurian literature. He helps Arthur and Kay fight the Giant of Mont Saint-Michel, and joins Arthur in his war against Emperor Lucius of Rome, in which he dies fighting.L Thorpe trans, History of the Kings of Britain (Penguin 1966) p. 238-40 and p. 252 In Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur, 'Bedwyr' (as he is initially known) plays a similar role against the Giant, before disappearing from the text to return rather ingloriously as Sir Bedivere to accompany Arthur at his end.H Cooper ed, Le Morte Darthur (Oxford 2008) p. 88, p. 539 and p. 511-15. In the original French romances, the later role belonged to his cousin, Griflet. William Henry Margetson's illustration for Legends of King Arthur and His Knights by Janet MacDonald (1914): \\"Sir Bedivere put King Arthur gently into the barge.\\" In several English versions of Arthur's death, including Malory's, the Alliterative Morte Arthure and the Stanzaic Morte Arthur, Bedivere and Arthur are among the few survivors of the Battle of Camlann (or of Salisbury). After the battle, at the request of the mortally wounded king, Bedivere casts away the sword Excalibur that Arthur had received from the Lady of the Lake. However, he does this only after twice thinking the sword too valuable to Britain to throw into the water.H Cooper ed, Le Morte Darthur (Oxford 2008) p. 514-5 When he reports that nothing in particular happened, King Arthur admonishes him, for Arthur knows that the mystical sword would create some supernatural event. Finally, Bedivere casts the sword into the water, at which a hand arises and catches the sword mid-air, then sinks into the waters, and Arthur is thus assured that the sword has been returned. Upon the death of Arthur, Bedivere enters a hermitage, where he spends the remainder of his life (the same hermitage, led by the Mordred-ousted Bishop of Canterbury, that Lancelot and some of his kindred knights will resort to in their own penitence). It is implied that both King Arthur and Queen Guinevere lie beside each other in or near there. Modern fiction Some modern authors such as Rosemary Sutcliff (Sword at Sunset), Gillian Bradshaw (Hawk of May), and Mary Stewart (The Merlin Trilogy) give him Lancelot's traditional role as Guinevere's lover, Lancelot having been added to the cycle too late to seem historical. *In the 1975 comedy film Monty Python and the Holy Grail, the ironically-named Sir Bedevere the Wise (played by Terry Jones) is regarded as brilliant at science by other characters, but his methods revolve around absurd theories such as the Earth being banana-shaped and witches burning and floating on water because they are made of wood. He devises a Trojan Horse styled scheme with a big wooden rabbit to get inside a French fortress, but overlooks the crucial detail of Arthur and the knights actually being inside it. *In John Boorman's 1981 film Excalibur, Percival replaces Bedivere as the knight that returns the sword to the Lady of the Lake. *Bedivere is the main character in the 1994 novel Grailblazers by Tom Holt. *Although he plays a minor part in Bernard Cornwell's The Warlord Chronicles, many of his legendary deeds (such as throwing Excalibur into the lake; or in Cornwell's story, the sea) are carried out instead by the protagonist, Derfel Cadarn.

Indonesian cuisine is a collection of various regional culinary traditions that formed the archipelagic nation of Indonesia. There are a wide variety of recipes and cuisines in part because Indonesia is composed of approximately 6,000 populated islands of the total 17,508 in the world's largest archipelago,\\"Indonesian Cuisine.\\" Epicurina.com . Accessed July 2011. with more than 300 ethnic groups calling Indonesia home. Many regional cuisines exist, often based upon indigenous culture with some foreign influences. Indonesia has around 5,350 traditional recipes, with 30 of them considered the most important. Indonesia's cuisine may include rice, noodle and soup dishes in modest local eateries to street-side snacks and top-dollar plates. Indonesian cuisine varies greatly by region and has many different influences.\\"Indonesian food.\\" Belindo.com . Accessed July 2011. Sumatran cuisine, for example, often has Middle Eastern and Indian influences, featuring curried meat and vegetables such as gulai and curry, while Javanese cuisine is mostly indigenous, with some hint of Chinese influence. The cuisines of Eastern Indonesia are similar to Polynesian and Melanesian cuisine. Elements of Chinese cuisine can be seen in Indonesian cuisine: foods such as noodles, meat balls, and spring rolls have been completely assimilated. Throughout its history, Indonesia has been involved in trade due to its location and natural resources. Additionally, Indonesia's indigenous techniques and ingredients were influenced by India, the Middle East, China, and finally Europe. Spanish and Portuguese traders brought New World produce even before the Dutch came to colonise most of the archipelago. The Indonesian islands The Moluccas (Maluku), which are famed as \\"the Spice Islands\\", also contributed to the introduction of native spices, such as cloves and nutmeg, to Indonesian and global cuisine. Indonesian cuisine often demonstrates complex flavour, acquired from certain ingredients and bumbu spices mixture. Indonesian dishes have rich flavours; most often described as savory, hot and spicy, and also combination of basic tastes such as sweet, salty, sour and bitter. Most Indonesians favour hot and spicy food, thus sambal, Indonesian hot and spicy chili sauce with various optional ingredients, notably shrimp paste, shallots, and others, is a staple condiment at all Indonesian tables. Seven main Indonesian cooking methods are frying, grilling, roasting, dry roasting, saut√©ing, boiling and steaming. Opor ayam (curry style), gulai, ketupat, diced potatoes with spices, and bawang goreng served during Lebaran (Eid al-Fitr) in Indonesia Some popular Indonesian dishes such as nasi goreng, gado-gado,Gado-Gado  Gado-Gado Recipe  Online Indonesian Food and Recipes at IndonesiaEats.com satay, and soto are ubiquitous in the country and are considered national dishes. The official national dish of Indonesia however, is tumpeng, chosen in 2014 by Indonesian Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy as the dish that binds the diversity of Indonesia's various culinary traditions. However, later in 2018, the same ministry has chosen 5 national dish of Indonesia; they are soto, rendang, satay, nasi goreng, and gado-gado. Indonesia is the home of sate; one of the country's national dishes, there are many variants across Indonesia. Today, some popular dishes that originated in Indonesia are now common to neighbouring countries, Malaysia and Singapore. Indonesian dishes such as satay, beef rendang, and sambal are favoured in Malaysia and Singapore. Soy-based dishes, such as variations of tofu and tempeh, are also very popular. Tempeh is regarded as a Javanese invention, a local adaptation of soy-based food fermentation and production. Another fermented food is oncom, similar in some ways to tempeh but using a variety of bases (not only soy), created by different fungi, and particularly popular in West Java. SBS Australia stated that Indonesian food is \\"one of the most vibrant and colourful cuisines in the world, full of intense flavour\\". Kira Jane Buxton of Mashed described it as \\"eclectic\\" and \\"diverse\\". History Bas-relief of Karmawibhanga of 9th century Borobudur depicts a rice barn and rice plants being infested by mouse pestilence. Rice farming has a long history in Indonesia. Indonesian cuisine has a long history‚Äîalthough most of it is not well-documented, and relied heavily on local practice and oral traditions. A rare instance however, is demonstrated by Javanese cuisine that somewhat has quite a well-documented culinary tradition. The diversity ranges from ancient bakar batu or stone-grilled yams and boar practiced by Papuan tribes of eastern Indonesia, to sophisticated contemporary Indonesian fusion cuisine. The ethnic diversity of Indonesian archipelago provides an eclectic combination ‚Äî mixing local Javanese, Sundanese, Balinese, Minang, Malay and other native cuisine traditions, with centuries worth of foreign contacts with Indian traders, Chinese migrants and Dutch colonials. Rice has been an essential staple for Indonesian society, as bas-reliefs of 9th century Borobudur and Prambanan describes rice farming in ancient Java. Ancient dishes were mentioned in many Javanese inscriptions and historians have succeeded in deciphering some of them. The inscriptions from Medang Mataram era circa 8th to 10th century mentioned several ancient dishes, among others are hada≈ãan hara≈ã (minced water buffalo meat satay, similar with today Balinese sate lilit), hada≈ãan madura (water buffalo meat simmered with sweet palm sugar), and dundu puyengan (eel seasoned with lemon basil). Also various hara≈ã-hara≈ã (grilled meats) either cele·πÖ/w√∂k (pork), hadahan/kbo (water buffalo), kida≈ã/knas (deer) or w·∏çus (goat). Ancient beverages include nalaka rasa (sugarcane juice), jati wangi (jasmine beverage), and kinca (tamarind juice). Also various kuluban (boiled vegetables served in spices, similar with today urap) and phalamula (boiled yams and tubers served with liquid palm sugar). Other ancient vegetable dishes include rumwah-rumwah (lalap), dudutan (raw vegetables) and tetis. The 9th century Old Javanese Kakawin Ramayana mentioned cooking technique as Trijata offered Sita some food (canto 17.101); scrumptious food of landuga tatla-tila (cooked with oil) and modakanda sagula (sugared delicacies). Several foods were mentioned in several Javanese inscriptions dated from 10th century to 15th century. Some of this dishes are identified with present-day Javanese foods. Among others are pecel, pindang, rarawwan (rawon), rurujak (rujak), kurupuk (krupuk), sweets like wajik and dodol, also beverages like dawet. In the 15th century Sundanese manuscript Sanghyang Siksa Kandang Karesian, it was mentioned the common Sundanese food flavours of that times which includes; lawana (salty), kaduka (hot and spicy), tritka (bitter), amba (sour), kasaya (savoury), and madura (sweet). By the 13th to 15th century, coastal Indonesian polities began to absorb culinary influences from India and the Middle East, as evidence with the adoption of curry-like recipes in the region. This was especially affirmative in the coastal towns of Aceh, Minangkabau lands of West Sumatra, and Malay ports of Sumatra and Malay peninsula. Subsequently, those culinary traditions displayed typical Indian culinary influences, such as kare (curry), roti cane and gulai. This was also went hand in hand with the adoption of Islamic faith, thus encouraged halal Muslim dietary law that omits pork. On the other hand, the indigenous inhabitant that resides inland‚Äîsuch as the Bataks and Dayaks, retains their older Austronesian culinary traditions, which incorporate bushmeat, pork and blood in their daily diet. Indonesian spices (bumbu) including peppercorn, clove, cinnamon and nutmeg. The famed 16th century spice trade has prompted European traders to seek spices' sources as far as Indonesian archipelago. According to the 17th century account of Rijklof van Goens, the ambassador of the VOC for Sultan Agung's Javanese Mataram court, the techniques of meat processing (sheep, goats, and buffalo) during celebration in Java, was by grilling and frying the seasoned meat. However, unlike European, the Javanese only use coconut oil instead of butter. Chinese immigrants has settled in Indonesian archipelago as early as Majapahit period circa 15th century CE, and accelerated during Dutch colonial period. The Chinese settlers introduced stir-frying technique that required the use of Chinese wok and small amount of cooking oil. They also introduced some new Chinese cuisine‚Äîincluding soy sauce, noodles and soybean processing technique to make tofu. Subsequently, soybean processing led to the possibly accidental discovery of tempeh (fermented soybean cake). The earliest known reference to tempeh appeared in 1815 in the Javanese manuscript of Serat Centhini.The Book of Tempeh, 2nd ed., by W. Shurtleff and A. Aoyagi (2001, Ten Speed Press, p. 145) The vigor of spice trade during the age of exploration has brought European traders to Indonesian shores. Subsequently, European colonialism was established in the 19th century Dutch East Indies. The influences of European cuisine‚Äîmost notably the Portuguese and Dutch, has introduced European techniques, especially in bread-making, pastries, cookies and cake-baking. Indonesian culinary tradition has been exposed to various influences. Regarding the method of food processing techniques, each region has developed a specificity that ultimately leads to localization of regional taste. Customs, serving and consumption Indonesian typical communal meal, consist of nasi (steamed rice), lauk-pauk (side dishes), and sayur-mayur (vegetables). Indonesian traditional meals usually consists of steamed rice as staple, surrounded by vegetables and soup and meat or fish side dishes. In a typical family meal, the family members gather around the table filled with steamed rice and several other dishes. Each dish is placed in a separate communal large plate or in bowls. Each of these dishes has its own serving spoons, used only to take parts of the dishes from the communal plate into one's own personal plate. Each of the family members has their own personal plate that is first filled with steamed rice. Usually the oldest family member or the husband has the right to initiate the meal, followed by the rest of the family to help themselves with the dishes. Each of them take some portion of dishes from the communal plates into their own individual plates. Nasi goreng-sate combo with egg and krupuk, popular Indonesian dish among foreigners. On their personal plate, the steamed rice will soon be surrounded by two, three or more dishes; vegetables and fish or meat, and maybe some fried dishes, sambal and krupuk. In Indonesian customs ‚Äî unlike in Japanese counterpart ‚Äî it is quite acceptable to be seen to mix the different flavoured dishes in a single personal plate during consumption. A practice commonly found in nasi campur, nasi Padang, or during a buffet. The soupy dish however, might be served in a separate small personal bowl. Today in contemporary Indonesian restaurants, the set menu is often offered. This has led to the personal serving practice, in similar fashion to those of Japanese cuisine, with a personal plate on a tray, a rattan or bamboo container each with a separate small portion of dishes surrounding the rice. This can be found in the presentation of nasi Bali. Personal serving of nasi Bali, weaved bamboo plate with rice surrounded by pieces of meat and vegetables side dishes. Indonesian meals are commonly eaten with the combination of a spoon in the right hand and fork in the left hand (to push the food onto the spoon). Unlike European dining custom, knife however, is absent from dining table, thus most of the ingredients such as vegetables and meat are already cut into bite-size pieces prior of cooking. Although, in many parts of the country, such as West Java and West Sumatra, it is also common to eat with one's bare hands. In restaurants or households that commonly use bare hands to eat, such as seafood food stalls, traditional Sundanese and Minangkabau restaurants, or East Javanese pecel lele (fried catfish with sambal) and ayam goreng (fried chicken) food stalls, kobokan is usually served along with the food. Kobokan is a bowl of tap water with a slice of lime in it to give a fresh scent, this bowl of water is not intended for consumption, rather it is used to wash one's hand before and after eating. Eating with chopsticks is generally only found in food stalls or restaurants serving Indonesian adaptations of Chinese cuisine, such as bakmie or mie ayam (chicken noodle) with pangsit (wonton), mie goreng (fried noodles), and kwetiau goreng (fried flat rice noodles). Staples =Rice= water buffalo to plough rice fields in Java; rice is a staple for all classes in contemporary; Indonesia is the world's third largest paddy rice producer and its cultivation has transformed much of Indonesia's landscape. Rice is a staple for all classes in contemporary Indonesia, and it holds the central place in Indonesian culture: it shapes the landscape; is sold at markets; and is served in most meals both as a savoury and a sweet food. The importance of rice in Indonesian culture is demonstrated through the reverence of Dewi Sri, the rice goddess of ancient Java and Bali. Traditionally the agricultural cycles linked to rice cultivations were celebrated through rituals, such as Seren Taun rice harvest festival. Rice is most often eaten as plain rice with just a few protein and vegetable dishes as side dishes. It is also served, however, as nasi uduk (rice cooked in coconut milk), nasi kuning (rice cooked with coconut milk and turmeric), ketupat (rice steamed in woven packets of coconut fronds), lontong (rice steamed in banana leaves), intip or rengginang (rice crackers), desserts, vermicelli, noodles, arak beras (rice wine), and nasi goreng (fried rice). Nasi goreng is omnipresent in Indonesia and considered as national dish. The ubiquitous nasi goreng (fried rice), considered one of Indonesia's national dishes, it has rich variants, this one uses green stinky bean and goat meat. Rice was only incorporated into diets, however, as either the technology to grow it or the ability to buy it from elsewhere was gained. Evidence of wild rice on the island of Sulawesi dates from 3000 BCE. Evidence for the earliest cultivation, however, comes from the eighth century stone inscriptions from the central island of Java, which shows that kings levied taxes in rice. The images of rice cultivation, rice barns, and pest mice infesting a ricefield is evident in Karmawibhanga bas-reliefs of Borobudur. Divisions of labour between men, women, and animals that are still in place in Indonesian rice cultivation, were carved into relief friezes on the ninth century Prambanan temples in Central Java: a water buffalo attached to a plough; women planting seedlings and pounding grain; and a man carrying sheaves of rice on each end of a pole across his shoulders (pikulan). In the sixteenth century, Europeans visiting the Indonesian islands saw rice as a new prestige food served to the aristocracy during ceremonies and feasts. Rice production in Indonesian history is linked to the development of iron tools and the domestication of wild Asian water buffalo as water buffalo for cultivation of fields and manure for fertiliser. Rice production requires exposure to the sun. Once covered in dense forest, much of the Indonesian landscape has been gradually cleared for permanent fields and settlements as rice cultivation developed over the last fifteen hundred years. =Wheat= Mie goreng (fried noodle), a wheat-based Chinese dish completely assimilated into Indonesian mainstream cuisine. Wheat is not a native plant to Indonesia, however through imports and foreign influences ‚Äî most notably Chinese and Dutch ‚Äî Indonesians began to develop a taste for wheat-based foodstuff, especially Chinese noodles, Indian roti, and Dutch bread. Other than common steamed rice, the Chinese in Indonesia also considered noodles, bakpao and cakwe as staples. Yet in Indonesia, especially in Java and Sumatra, the rice culture was so prevalent that sometimes these wheat-based dishes, such as noodles are treated as side dishes and are consumed with rice, while others such as Chinese buns and cakwe are treated as snacks. The European, especially the Portuguese and the Dutch, introduced bread and various type of bakery and pastry. These European staples have now become alternatives for a quick breakfast. The Indonesian wheat consumption reached a new height after the advent of Indonesian instant noodle industry back in the 1970s. Since then Indonesia has become one of the world's major producers and consumers of instant noodles. Indonesia is the world's second largest instant noodle market only after China, with demand reaching 12.54 billion servings in 2018, Today, instant noodles have become a staple in Indonesian households for quick hot meals. Certain brands such as Indomie have become household names. =Other staples= Papeda, staple food of eastern Indonesia, served with yellow soup and grilled mackerel. Other staple foods in Indonesia include a number of starchy tubers such as yam, sweet potato, potato, taro and cassava. Starchy fruit such as breadfruit and jackfruit and grains such as maize are eaten. A sago congee called papeda is a staple food especially in Maluku and Papua. Sago is often mixed with water and cooked as a simple pancake. Next to sago, people of eastern Indonesia consume wild tubers as staple food. Many types of tubers such as talas (a type of taro but larger and more bland) and breadfruit are native to Indonesia, while others were introduced from elsewhere. Yam was introduced from Africa; while potato, sweet potato, cassava and maize were introduced from the Americas through Spanish influence and reached Java in the 17th century. Cassava is usually boiled, steamed, fried or processed as a popular snack kripik singkong (cassava crackers). Dried cassava, locally known as tiwul, is an alternate staple food in arid areas of Java such as Gunung Kidul and Wonogiri, while other roots and tubers are eaten especially in hard times. Maize is eaten in drier regions such as Madura and islands east of the Wallace Line, such as the Lesser Sunda Islands. Vegetables Indonesian food includes many vegetables as ingredients like this Sayur oyong made with Luffa acutangula A number of leaf vegetables are widely used in Indonesian cuisine, such as kangkung, spinach, genjer, melinjo, papaya and cassava leaves. These are often sauteed with garlic. Spinach and corn are used in simple clear watery vegetable soup sayur bayam bening flavoured with temu kunci, garlic and shallot. Clear vegetable soup includes sayur oyong. Other vegetables like calabash, chayote, kelor, yardlong bean, eggplant, gambas and belustru, are cut and used in stir fries, curries and soups like sayur asem, sayur lodeh or laksa. Daun ubi tumbuk is pounded cassava leaves dish, commonly found in Sumatra, Kalimantan and Sulawesi. Sayur sop is cabbage, cauliflower, potato, carrot, with macaroni spiced with black pepper, garlic and shallot in chicken or beef broth. The similar mixed vegetables are also stir fried as cap cai, a popular dish of the Chinese Indonesian cuisine. Tumis kangkung is a popular stir-fried water spinach dish. Vegetables like winged bean, tomato, cucumber and the small variety of bitter melon are commonly eaten raw, like in lalab. The large bitter melon variety is usually boiled. Kecombrang and papaya flower buds are a common Indonesian vegetable. Urap is seasoned and spiced shredded coconut mixed together with vegetables, asinan betawi are preserved vegetables. Gado-gado and pecel are a salad of boiled vegetables dressed in a peanut-based spicy sauce, while karedok is its raw version. =Vegetarianism in Indonesia= Tempeh burger, a fusion vegan dish. Vegetarianism is well represented in Indonesia, as there is a wide selection of vegetarian dishes and meat substitutes that may be served. Dishes such as gado-gado, karedok, ketoprak, tauge goreng, pecel, urap, rujak and asinan are vegetarian dishes. However, dishes that use peanut sauce, such as gado-gado, karedok or ketoprak, might contain small amounts of shrimp paste, called \\"terasi\\", for flavor. Shrimp paste is also often used to add flavour to spicy sambal chili paste served with lalap assorted fresh vegetables. Fermented soy products, such as tempeh, \\"tahu\\" (tofu) and oncom are prevalent as meat substitutes and as a source of vegetable protein. In contemporary fusion cuisine, tempeh is used to replace meat patties and served as tempeh burger. Most Indonesians do not practice strict vegetarianism and may consume vegetables or vegetarian dishes for their taste, preference, economic and health reasons. Nevertheless, there are small numbers of Indonesian Buddhists that practice vegetarianism for religious reasons. Meat and fish The main animal protein sources in the Indonesian diet are mostly poultry and fish, however meats such as beef, water buffalo, goat and mutton are commonly found in the Indonesian marketplaces. =Poultry= Ayam goreng kalasan, from Kalasan, Yogyakarta. The most common poultry consumed is chicken and duck, however to a lesser amount, pigeon, quail and wild swamp bird such as watercock are also consumed. Traditionally, Indonesians breed free-ranged chicken in the villages known as ayam kampung (village chicken). Compared to common domesticated chicken, these village chicken are thinner and their meat are slightly firmer. Various recipes of ayam goreng (fried chicken) and ayam bakar (grilled chicken) are commonly found throughout Indonesia. Other than frying or grilling, chicken might be cooked as soup, such as sup ayam and soto ayam, or cooked in coconut milk as opor ayam. Chicken satay is also commonly found in Indonesia, it is a barbecued meat on skewer served with peanut sauce. Popular chicken recipes such as ayam goreng kalasan from Yogyakarta, ayam bakar padang from Padang, ayam taliwang from Lombok, ayam betutu from Bali, and ayam goreng lengkuas (galangal fried chicken). =Meat= Rendang daging, a beef, mutton or goat meat dish, that has been marinated with various different spices for several hours, and slow-cooked with coconut milk. Beef and goat meat are the most commonly consumed meats in Indonesia, while kerbau (water buffalo) and domestic sheep are also consumed to a lesser degree, since water buffalo are more useful for ploughing the rice paddies, while sheep are kept for their wool or to be used for the traditional entertainment of ram fighting. As a country with an Islamic majority, Indonesian Muslims follows the Islamic halal dietary law which forbids the consumption of pork. However, in other parts of Indonesia where there are significant numbers of non-Muslims, boar and pork are commonly consumed. Dishes made of non-halal meats can be found in provinces such as Bali, North Sumatra, North Sulawesi, East Nusa Tenggara, Maluku, West Kalimantan, West Papua, Papua, and also in the Chinatowns of major Indonesian cities. Today to cater for the larger Muslim market, most of the restaurants and eating establishments in Indonesia put halal signs that signify that they serve neither pork nor any non-halal meats, nor do they use lard in their cooking. With an overwhelming Muslim population and a relatively small population of cattle, today Indonesians rely heavily on imported beef from Australia, New Zealand and the United States which often results in a scarcity and raised prices of beef in the Indonesian market. The meat can be cooked in rich spices and coconut milk such as beef, goat or lamb rendang, skewered, seasoned and grilled chicken or mutton as satay, barbecued meats, or sliced and cooked in rich broth soup as soto. Muttons and various offals can be use as ingredients for soto soup or gulai curry. In Bali, with its Hindu majority, the babi guling (pig roast) is popular among locals as well as non- Muslim visitors, while the Batak people of North Sumatra have babi panggang that is a similar dish. Wild boar are also commonly consumed in Papua. The meat also can be processed to be thinly-sliced and dried as dendeng (jerky), or made into abon (meat floss). Dendeng celeng is Indonesian \\"dried, jerked\\" boar meat. Raised rabbits are also consumed as food in mountainous region of Indonesia. Some exotic and rare game meat such as venison might be sold and consumed in wilder parts of Indonesia. In West Nusa Tenggara, East Nusa Tenggara, and Papua, deer meat can be found, usually wildly acquired by hunting. Other unusual and often controversial exotic meats include frog legs consumed in Chinese Indonesian cuisine, horse meat consumed in Yogyakarta and West Nusa Tenggara, turtle meat consumed in Bali and Eastern Indonesia, snake, biawak (monitor lizard), paniki (fruit bats), dog meat, and field rats, consumed in Minahasan cuisine of North Sulawesi. Batak cuisine of North Sumatra is also familiar with cooking dog meat. =Fish= Grilling ikan bakar baronang in Mamuju, West Sulawesi. In an archipelagic nation, seafood is abundant, and it is commonly consumed especially by Indonesian residents in coastal areas. Fish is especially popular in the eastern Indonesian regions of Sulawesi and Maluku, where most of the people work as fishermen. Both areas have a vast sea which brings them many different kinds of seafood. Popular seafood in Indonesian cuisine among others; skipjack tuna, tuna, mackerel, pomfret, wahoo, milkfish, trevally, rabbitfish, garoupa, red snapper, anchovy, swordfish, shark, stingray, squid or cuttlefish, shrimp, crab, blue crab, and mussel. Seafood is commonly consumed across Indonesia, but it is especially popular in Maluku islands and Minahasa (North Sulawesi) cuisine. Seafood are usually being grilled, boiled or fried. Ikan bakar is a popular grilled fish dish that can be found throughout Indonesia. However another method of cooking like stir fried in spices or in soup is also possible. Salted fish is preserved seafood through cured in salt, it is also can be found in Indonesian market. Fresh water fisheries can be found in inland regions or in areas with large rivers or lakes. Fresh water fishes are popular in Sundanese cuisine of West Java, caught or raised in Lake Toba in Batak lands of North Sumatra, or taken from large rivers in Malay lands of Riau, Jambi and South Sumatra, or large rivers in Kalimantan. Popular fresh water fish among others; carp, gourami, catfish, pangasius, snakehead, trichogaster, climbing gourami, Nile tilapia, and Mozambique tilapia. =Insects= Botok tawon, botok made from bee larvae. Unlike Thailand, in Indonesia insect is not a popular food ingredient nor widely available as street food. In Java, locals do catch, breed and sell certain species of insects, usually sold fresh or alive as pet bird feed. Nevertheless, traditionally several cultures in Indonesia are known to consume insects, especially grasshopper, cricket, termite, also the larvae of sago palm weevil and bee. In Java and Kalimantan, grasshoppers and crickets are usually lightly battered and deep fried in palm oil as crispy kripik snack. Smaller grashoppers, crickets and termites might be made as rempeyek batter cracker which resembles insect fossil. During monsoon rainy season, flying termites are abundant being attracted to lightbulbs to mate. Locals usually put a bucket of water under the lamp to trap the flying termites, pluck the wings, and roast the termites as additional protein-rich snack. In Banyuwangi, East Java, there is a specialty dish called botok tawon (honeybee botok), which is beehives that contains bee larvae, being seasoned in shredded coconut and spices, wrapped inside banana leaf package and steamed. Dayak tribes of Kalimantan, also Moluccans and Papuan tribes in Eastern Indonesia, are known to consumes ulat sagu (lit. sagoo caterpillar) or larvae of sago palm weevil. This protein-rich larvae is considered as a delicacy in Papua, and often being roasted prior of consumption. However, locals may also commonly eat the larvae raw or alive. Spices and other flavourings Various Indonesian spices \\"Rempah\\" is the Indonesian word for spice, while \\"bumbu\\" is the Indonesian word for a spice mixture or seasoning, and it commonly appears in the names of certain spice mixtures, sauces and seasoning pastes. Known throughout the world as the \\"Spice Islands\\", the Indonesian islands of Maluku contributed to the introduction of its native spices to world cuisine. Spices such as nutmeg or mace, clove, pandan leaves, keluwak and galangal are native to Indonesia. It is likely that black pepper, turmeric, lemongrass, shallot, cinnamon, candlenut, coriander and tamarind were introduced from India, while ginger, scallions and garlic were introduced from China. Those spices from mainland Asia were introduced early, in ancient times, thus they became integral ingredients in Indonesian cuisine. In ancient times, the kingdom of Sunda and the later sultanate of Banten were well known as the world's major producers of black pepper. The maritime empires of Srivijaya and Majapahit also benefited from the lucrative spice trade between the spice islands with China and India. Later the Dutch East India Company controlled the spice trade between Indonesia and the world. =Sambal= Sambal ulek, a common Indonesian spicy condiment. The Indonesian fondness for hot and spicy food was enriched when the Spanish introduced chili pepper from the New World to the region in the 16th century. After that hot and spicy sambals have become an important part of Indonesian cuisine. Indonesia has perhaps the richest variants of sambals. In the Indonesian archipelago, there are as many as 300 varieties of sambal. The intensity ranges from mild to very hot. Sambal evolved into many variants across Indonesia, ones of the most popular is sambal terasi (sambal belacan) and sambal mangga muda (unripe mango sambal). Sambal terasi is a combination of chilies, sharp fermented shrimp paste (terasi), tangy lime juice, sugar and salt all pounded up with mortar and pestle. Dabu-dabu is North Sulawesi style of sambal with chopped fresh tomato, chili, and lime juice. The savoury and sweet shrimp paste from Lombok, West Nusa Tenggara, is called lengkare or terasi lombok Sambal, especially sambal ulek, or sambal terasi can also become a base ingredient for many dishes, such as sambal raja (a dish from Kutai), terong balado, dendeng balado, ayam bumbu rujak, sambal goreng ati, among other things. =Sauces and seasonings= Soy sauce is also an important flavourings in Indonesian cuisine. Kecap asin (salty or common soy sauce) was adopted from Chinese cuisine, however Indonesian developed their own kecap manis (sweet soy sauce) with generous addition of palm sugar into soy sauce. Sweet soy sauce is an important marinade for barbecued meat and fish, such as satay and grilled fishes. Sweet soy sauce is also an important ingredient for semur, Indonesian stew. =Peanut sauce= Peanut sauce is important part of gado-gado. One of the main characteristics of Indonesian cuisine is the wide application of peanuts in many Indonesian signature dishes, such as satay, gado-gado, karedok, ketoprak, and pecel. All of these dishes applied ample of bumbu kacang (peanut sauce) for flavouring. Gado-gado and Satay for example have been considered as Indonesian national dishes. Introduced from Mexico by Portuguese and Spanish merchants in the 16th century, peanuts assumed a place within Indonesian cuisine as a key ingredient. Peanuts thrived in the tropical environment of Southeast Asia, and today they can be found, roasted and chopped finely, in many recipes. Whole, halved, or crushed peanuts are used to garnish a variety of dishes, and used in marinades and dipping sauces such as sambal kacang (a mixture of ground chilies and fried peanuts) for otak-otak or ketan. Peanut oil, extracted from peanuts, is one of the most commonly used cooking oils in Indonesia. Bumbu kacang or peanut sauce represents a sophisticated, earthy seasoning rather than a sweet, gloppy sauce.James Oseland, Cradle Of Flavor (W.W. Norton & Co., 2006) It should have a delicate balance of savoury, sweet, sour, and spicy flavours, acquired from various ingredients, such as fried peanuts, gula jawa (coconut sugar), garlic, shallots, ginger, tamarind, lemon juice, lemongrass, salt, chilli, peppercorns, sweet soy sauce, ground together and mixed with water to form the right consistency. The secret to good peanut sauce is \\"not too thick and not too watery\\". Indonesian peanut sauce tends to be less sweet than the Thai version, which is a hybrid adaptation. Gado-gado is a popular dish particularly associated with bumbu kacang, and is eaten across Indonesia. =Coconut milk= Coconuts are abundant in tropical Indonesia, and since ancient times Indonesians developed many and various uses for this plant. The broad use of coconut milk in dishes throughout the archipelago is another common characteristic of Indonesian cuisine. It is used in recipes ranging from savoury dishes ‚Äì such as rendang, soto, gulai, mie koclok, sayur lodeh, gudeg, and opor ayam ‚Äì to desserts ‚Äì such as es cendol and es doger. Soto is ubiquitous in Indonesia and considered as one of Indonesia's national dishes. The use of coconut milk is not exclusive to Indonesian cuisine. It can also be found in Indian, Samoan, Thai, Malaysian, Filipino, and Brazilian cuisines. Nonetheless, the use of coconut milk is quite extensive in Indonesia, especially in Minangkabau cuisine, although in Minahasan (North Sulawesi) cuisine, coconut milk is generally absent, except in Minahasan cakes and desserts such as klappertart. Cooking gulai, a type of spicy Indonesian curry, in ample of spices and coconut milk In Indonesian cuisine, two types of coconut milk are found, thin coconut milk and thick coconut milk. The difference depends on the water and oil content. Thin coconut milk is usually used for soups such as sayur lodeh and soto, while the thicker variety is used for rendang and desserts. It can be made from freshly shredded coconut meat in traditional markets, or can be found processed in cartons at the supermarket. After the milk has been extracted from the shredded coconut flesh to make coconut milk, the ampas kelapa (leftover coconut flesh) can still be used in urap, seasoned and spiced shredded coconut meat mixed together with vegetables. Leftover shredded coconut can also be cooked, sauteed and seasoned to make serundeng, almost powdery sweet and spicy finely shredded coconut. Kerisik paste, added to thicken rendang, is another use of coconut flesh. To acquire a rich taste, some households insist on using freshly shredded coconut, instead of leftover, for urap and serundeng. Serundeng can be mixed with meat in dishes such as serundeng daging (beef serundeng) or sprinkled on top of other dishes such as soto or ketan (sticky rice). An example of the heavy use of coconut is Burasa from Makassar, rice wrapped in banana leaf cooked with coconut milk and sprinkled with powdered coconut similar to serundeng. Cooking method A traditional humble kitchen in Indonesia using firewood for cooking. Most of the common Indonesian dishes are named according to their main ingredients and cooking method. For example, ayam goreng is ayam (chicken) and goreng (frying), which denotes fried chicken. Mie goreng is fried noodle, ikan bakar is grilled fish, udang rebus is boiled shrimp, babi panggang is roasted pork and tumis kangkung is stir fried water spinach. Cooking methods in Indonesian kitchen are goreng (frying) either in a small amount of oil or deep frying with a lot of cooking oil, tumis (stir frying), sangrai (saut√©ing). Roasting methods are bakar (grilling) usually employing charcoal, firewood, or coconut shell, panggang (baked) usually refer to baking employing oven. Other methods are rebus (boiling) and kukus (steaming). The fire used in cooking can be either strong fire or small fire for slow cooking. Cooking nasi goreng usually employs strong fire, while authentic rendang for example requires small fire for slow cooking of beef, spices, and coconut milk until the meat is caramelised and all the coconut milk's liquid has evaporated. Traditional Indonesian dapur (kitchen) usually employs firewood- fuelled kitchen stove, while the contemporary household today uses liquefied petroleum gas-fuelled stove or an electric stove. The ingredients could be cut in pieces, sliced thinly, or ground into a paste. Cooking utensils are wajan (wok), penggorengan (frying pan), panci (cauldron), knives, several types of spoon and fork, parutan (shredder), cobek and ulekan (stone mortar and pestle). Traditionally Indonesians use a stone mortar and a pestle to grind the spices and ingredients into coarse or fine pastes. Today most households use blender or food processor for the task. Traditional Indonesian cookingwares are usually made from stone, earthenware pottery, wood, and woven bamboo or a rattan container or filter, while contemporary cookingwares, plates and containers use metals ‚Äì iron, tin, stainless steel, aluminium, ceramics, plastics, and also glass. National dishes Initially during the early years of Indonesian independence, the ubiquitous and extremely popular nasi goreng was considered as the national dish of the republic, albeit at that time was unofficial. Its simplicity and versatility has contributed to its popularity and made it as a staple among Indonesian households‚Äîcolloquially considered as the most \\"democratic\\" dish since the absence of an exact and rigid recipe has allowed people to do anything they want with it. Nasi goreng that is commonly consumed daily in Indonesian households was considered as the quintessential dish that represent an Indonesian family. It is in the menu, introduced, offered and served in Indonesian Theatre Restaurant within the Indonesian pavilion at the 1964 New York World's Fair. Howard Palfrey Jones, the US ambassador to Indonesia during the last years of Sukarno's reign in mid 1960s, in his memoir \\"Indonesia: The Possible Dream\\", said that he like nasi goreng. He described his fondness for nasi goreng cooked by Hartini, one of Sukarno's wives, and praise it as the most delicious nasi goreng he ever tasted. Nevertheless, other widely popular Indonesian dish, such as satay, soto and gado-gado are also considered as the strong contenders. In 2014, the Indonesian Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy in an effort to promote Indonesian cuisine, has chosen tumpeng as an official Indonesian national dish. Technically tumpeng refer to the rice cone in the center, while the surrounding various dishes might be taken from any choice of various Indonesian dishes‚Äîthus was considered ideal as a national dish that binds the diversity of Indonesia's various culinary traditions. Subsequently however, the designation of tumpeng as the single national dish of Indonesia was considered insufficient to describe the diversity of Indonesian culinary traditions. Later in 2018, the same ministry has chosen another additional 5 national dish of Indonesia; they are soto, satay, nasi goreng, rendang and gado-gado. Satay and soto are notable and the natural choice to be promoted as Indonesian national dish, since they had transcends the cultural boundaries of myriad ethnic groups of Indonesia‚Äîthose dishes has been extremely localised and has branched into various recipes nationwide. For example, there are rich variants of satay and soto recipes throughout Indonesia; from Sumatra to Eastern Indonesia. Each cultures, ethnics, or even cities had adopted these dishes, and thus developed their own version in accordance to their own culture, tradition, creativity, localised taste and preference, also the availability of local ingredients.

Traditionally, Minangkabau people adheres to merantau (migrating) culture, and they are avid restaurant entrepreneurs. As a result, Padang food restaurant chains can be found throughout Indonesia and neighbouring countries, likely making it the most popular regional dish in Indonesia. In outside West Sumatra such as in Java, most of Padang Restaurants still use buffalo to make rendang, but claim as Rendang Sapi for selling purposes due to buffalo meat is more inferior and cheaper than cow meat. Buffalo meat is harder, so suitable for rendang with cooking time at least 3 hours, the texture is also coarse and the color is more red than cow meat even when is already cooked. =East Sumatra= Gulai ikan kerapu, grouper curry. The cuisine of east coast of Sumatra is referring to the culinary tradition of ethnic Malays of Indonesian Sumatran provinces facing Malacca strait; which includes Riau, Riau Islands, Jambi provinces and coastal North Sumatra in Melayu Deli areas in and around Medan. Because of close ethnic kinship and proximity to Malaysian Malays, many dishes are shared between the two countries. For example nasi lemak, the national dish of Malaysia, and also nasi ulam are considered as native dishes in Riau and Jambi. Malay cuisine also shares many similarities with neighboring Minangkabau cuisine of West Sumatra, South Sumatra, and also Aceh; such as sharing gulai, asam pedas, pindang, kari, lemang and rendang. This is due to the fact that the Minangkabau are culturally closely related to the Malays. Tempoyak fermented durian sauce and sambal belacan are the familiar condiments in both Sumatra and Malay Peninsula. Variants of peranakan cuisine such as laksa spicy noodle and otak-otak are also can be found in Riau Islands and Medan.

With a drier climate in Nusa Tenggara archipelago, there is less rice and more sago, corn, cassava, and taro compared to central and western Indonesia. Fishes are popularly consumed, including sepat (Trichogaster), which is shredded fish in coconut and young-mango sauce. Lombok's sasak people enjoy spicy food such as ayam taliwang which is roasted chicken served with peanut, tomato chilli and lime dip.

Following the spread of Islam to Indonesia, Muslim Indian as well as Arab influences made their way into Indonesian cuisine. Examples include Indian martabak and kari (curry) that influenced Sumatran cuisines of Aceh, Minangkabau, and Malay; in addition to Betawi and coastal Javanese cuisine. Some of Aceh and Minangkabau dishes such as roti cane, nasi biryani, nasi kebuli, and gulai kambing can trace its origin to Indian influences. =Chinese influences= Siomay, popular Indonesian Chinese-influenced dish. Chinese immigration to Indonesia started in the 7th century, and accelerated during Dutch colonial times, thus creating the fusion of Chinese cuisine with indigenous Indonesian style. Similar Chinese-native fusion cuisine phenomena is also observable in neighbouring Malaysia and Singapore as peranakan cuisine. Some popular Indonesian dishes trace its origin to Chinese influences such as; bakmi, bakso, soto mie, soto, bakpau, nasi goreng, mie goreng, tahu goreng, siomay, pempek, lumpia, nasi tim, cap cai, fu yung hai and swikee. Some of this Chinese-influenced dishes has been so well-integrated into Indonesian mainstream cuisine that many Indonesian today might not recognise their Chinese-origin and considered them as their own. =Dutch influences= Selat solo (solo salad), an adaptation of European cuisine into Javanese taste. The Dutch arrived in Indonesia in the 16th century in search of spices. When the Dutch East India Company (VOC) went bankrupt in 1800, Indonesia became a treasured colony of the Netherlands. Through colonialism, Europeans introduced bread, cheese, barbecued steak and pancake. Bread, butter and margarine, sandwiches filled with ham, cheese or fruit jam, poffertjes, pannekoek and Dutch cheeses are commonly consumed by colonial Dutch and Indos during the colonial era. Some of native upperclass ningrat (nobles) and educated native were exposed to European cuisine; This cuisine was held in high esteem as the cuisine of the upper class of Dutch East Indies society. This led to adoption and fusion of European cuisine into Indonesian cuisine. Some dishes created during the colonial era were influenced by Dutch cuisine, including roti bakar (grilled bread), roti buaya, selat solo (solo salad), macaroni schotel (macaroni casserole), pastel tutup (Shepherd's pie), bistik jawa (Javanese beef steak), semur (from Dutch smoor), erten (pea soup), brenebon (kidney bean soup) and sop buntut. Many pastries, cakes and cookies such as kue bolu (tart), lapis legit (spekkoek), spiku (lapis Surabaya) and kaasstengels (cheese sticks) come from Dutch influence. Some recipes were invented as Dutch Indies fusion cuisine, using native ingredients but employing European pastry techniques. These include pandan cake and klappertaart (coconut tart). Kue cubit, commonly sold as a snack at schools and marketplaces, are believed to be derived from poffertjes. Influence abroad Conversely, Indonesian cuisine also had influenced the Dutch through their shared colonial heritage. Indonesian cuisine also influencing neighbouring countries through Indonesians migration across the straits to Malaysia. =Malaysia= Beef rendang with ketupat palas also served in Malaysia. Because of their proximity, historic migrations and close cultural kinship, Indonesian cuisine also has influenced neighbouring cooking traditions; most notably Malaysian cuisine. Indonesian influence is pervasive in the central state of Negeri Sembilan, which was settled largely by Minangkabau people hailing from West Sumatra and is, thus, reflected in their culture, history and cuisine. Minangkabau cuisine influences is profound in Malay cooking tradition, as the result both traditions share same dishes; including rendang, gulai, asam pedas and tempoyak. Rendang is a typical example that has been well-integrated into mainstream Malaysian cuisine and is now considered as their own, and popular especially during Hari Raya Aidil Fitri. In the early 20th century, there are large influx of Sumatrans to Kuala Lumpur and other parts of Malaysia heartland, that led to the popularity of Nasi Padang (originated from Padang city, West Sumatra) not only in Malaysia, but also in Singapore. The Malay cuisine of southernmost state of Johor, reflects the influences of Javanese who settled there for over past two centuries. Popular Javanese-origin dishes in Johor includes ayam penyet, nasi ambeng, telur pindang, sayur lodeh, mee rebus and pechal. =Thailand= Thai pork satay To a lesser extent, Indonesian cuisine also had influenced Thai cuisine ‚Äî probably through Malaysian intermediary ‚Äî such as the introduction of satay, from Java to Sumatra, Malay Peninsula, and reached Thailand. Achat ( ), is a Thai pickles which believed to be derived from Indonesian acar. It is made with cucumber, red chilies, red onions or shallots, vinegar, sugar and salt. It is served as a side dish with the Thai version of satay (). =Netherlands= Kipsate met friet, Dutch take on Indonesian chicken satay, served with Peanut sauce, fried onions, kroepoek, friet, and mayonnaise. During the colonial period, the Dutch embraced Indonesian cuisine both at home and abroad. The Indonesian cuisine had influenced colonial Dutch and Indo people that brought Indonesian dishes back to the Netherlands due to repatriation following the independence of Indonesia. C. Countess van Limburg Stirum writes in her book \\"The Art of Dutch Cooking\\" (1962): There exist countless Indonesian dishes, some of which take hours to prepare; but a few easy ones have become so popular that they can be regarded as \\"national dishes\\". She then provides recipes for nasi goreng (fried rice), pisang goreng (battered, deep fried bananas), lumpia goreng (fried spring rolls), bami (fried noodles), satay (grilled skewered meat), satay sauce (peanut sauce), and sambal oelek (chilli paste).C. Countess van Limburg Stirum: The Art of Dutch Cooking; First published in 1962 by Andre Deutsch Limited, London; p.179-p.185 Dutch-Indonesian fusion dishes also exist, of which the most well- known is the rijsttafel (\\"rice table\\"), which is an elaborate meal consisting of many (up to several dozens) small dishes (hence filling \\"an entire table\\"). While popular in the Netherlands, Rijsttafel is now rare in Indonesia itself. Today, there are many Indonesian restaurants in the Netherlands, especially in large cities like Amsterdam, Den Haag, Utrecht and Rotterdam. Meal times Traditional slametan meal in Java during colonial period. Indonesians might consumes snacks or varieties of small dishes throughout the day. However, if separate scheduled larger meal is observed, they usually consists of sarapan or makan pagi (breakfast), makan siang (lunch) is often the main meal of the day, followed by makan malam (dinner). Mealtime is typically a casual and solitary affair, and might be observed differently across region. In western and central Indonesia, the main meal is usually cooked in the late morning, and consumed around midday. In many families there is no set meal time when all members are expected to attend. For this reason, most of the dishes are made so that they can remain edible even if left on the table at room temperature for many hours. The same dishes are then re-heated for the final meal in the evening. Most meals are built around a cone-shaped pile of long- grain, highly polished rice. A meal may include a soup, salad (or more commonly vegetables saut√©ed with garlic), and another main dish. Whatever the meal, it is accompanied by at least one, and often several, relishes called sambals. Especially for Javanese family, on the table, it is also common to always have chips, that can be kerupuk, rempeyek, or any other chips to accompany the meal. In eastern Indonesia, such as on the islands of Papua and Timor, where the climate is often much drier, the meals can be centred around other sources of carbohydrates such as sago or root vegetables and starchy tubers. Being east of the Wallace line, the biogeographic realm, and hence the flora and fauna, are quite different from those of the islands to the west, and so the food stuffs are as well. Feasts =Tumpeng= Tumpeng nasi kuning, the cone shaped yellow rice is served during a feast. Many Indonesian traditional customs and ceremonies incorporate food and feast, one of the best examples is tumpeng. Originally from Java, tumpeng is a cone shaped mound of rice surrounded by an assortment of other dishes, officially chosen as Indonesian national dish in 2014. Traditionally featured in slametan ceremonies, the cone of rice is made by using bamboo leaves woven into a cone- shaped container. The rice itself can be plain white steamed rice, uduk (rice cooked with coconut milk), or yellow rice (rice coloured with kunyit, i.e., turmeric). After it is shaped, the rice cone is surrounded by assorted dishes, such as urap vegetables, fried chicken, semur (beef in sweet soy sauce), teri kacang (little dried fish fried with peanuts), fried prawns, telur pindang (marblised boiled eggs), shredded omelette, tempe orek (sweet, dry fried tempeh), perkedel kentang (mashed potato fritters), perkedel jagung (corn fritters), sambal goreng ati (liver in chilli sauce), and many other dishes. Nasi tumpeng probably comes from an ancient Indonesian tradition that revers mountains as the abode of the ancestors and the gods. Rice cone is meant to symbolise the holy mountain. The feast served as some kind of thanksgiving for the abundance of harvest or any other blessings. Because of its festivities and celebratory value, even now tumpeng is sometimes used as an Indonesian counterpart to birthday cake. =Nasi Padang= Hidang presentation of nasi padang. Having Nasi Padang in festive hidang (serve) style provides opportunity to sample wide array of Padang food in a single setting. Nasi Padang (Padang-style rice) is the steamed rice served with various choices of pre-cooked dishes originated from Padang city, West Sumatra. It is a miniature banquet of meats, fish, vegetables, and spicy sambals eaten with plain white rice. It is the Minangkabau's great contribution to Indonesian cuisine. After the customers are seated, they do not have to order. The waiter with stacked plates upon their hands will immediately serves the dishes directly to the table. The table will quickly be set with dozens of small dishes filled with richly flavoured foods such as beef rendang, various gulais, curried fish, stewed greens, chili eggplant, curried beef liver, tripe, intestines, or foot tendons, fried beef lung, fried chicken, and of course, sambal. A dozen of dishes is a normal number, it could reach 14 dishes or more. Nasi Padang is an at-your-table, by-the-plate buffet. Customers take ‚Äî and pay for ‚Äî only what they have consumed from this array. =Rijsttafel= Rijsttafel in 1936 Dutch East Indies. Another Indonesian feast, the Rijsttafel (from Dutch, meaning 'rice table'), demonstrates both colonial opulence and the diversity of Indonesian cuisine at the same time. The classic style rijsttafel involved serving of up to 40 different dishes by 40 male waiters, bare foot but dressed in formal white uniforms with blangkon (traditional Javanese caps) on their heads and batik cloth around their waists. In contemporary Indonesian cuisine, it has been adapted into a western style prasmanan buffet. =Prasmanan= Prasmanan, an Indonesian style buffet. When attending the reception of an Indonesian traditional wedding party, office lunch-time meeting, a seminar or dinner gathering, one usually will find themselves queuing to Indonesian prasmanan; a long table filled with wide array of Indonesian dishes. A prasmanan is quite similar with rijsttafel but minus the ceremonial waiters and usually served fewer choices of dishes compared to its flamboyant colonial predecessor. It is an Indonesian buffet as it employs a long table with a wide range of dishes, both savoury and sweet, served on it. It can usually be found in wedding ceremonies or any other festivities. The layout for an Indonesian wedding ceremony buffet is usually: plates, eating utensils (spoon and fork), and paper napkins placed on one end, followed by rice (plain or fried), a series of Indonesian (and sometimes international) dishes, sambal and krupuk (shrimp crackers), and ending with glasses of water on the other end of the table. Beverages =Non-alcoholic beverages= A cup of Java, Javanese kopi tubruk The most common and popular Indonesian drinks and beverages are teh (tea) and kopi (coffee). Indonesian households commonly serve teh manis (sweet tea) or kopi tubruk (coffee mixed with sugar and hot water and poured straight in the glass without separating out the coffee residue) to guests. Since the colonial era of Netherlands East Indies, plantations, especially in Java, were major producers of coffee, tea and sugar. Since then hot and sweet coffee and tea beverages have been enjoyed by Indonesians. Jasmine tea is the most popular tea variety drunk in Indonesia, however recent health awareness promotions have made green tea a popular choice. Usually coffee and tea are served hot, but cold iced sweet tea is also frequently drunk. Kopi luwak is Indonesian exotic and expensive coffee beverage made from the beans of coffee berries which have been eaten by the Asian palm civet (Paradoxurus hermaphroditus) and other related civets. Teh botol, bottled sweet jasmine tea, is now quite popular and locally competes favourably with international bottled soda beverages such as Coca-Cola and Fanta. Kopi susu (coffee with sweetened condensed milk) is an Indonesian version of Caf√© au lait. Es kelapa muda or young coconut ice is fresh drink which is made from chilled young coconut water, coconut flesh and syrup. It is among favourite beverage in Indonesia. Fruit juices (jus) are very popular. Varieties include orange (jus jeruk), guava (jus jambu), mango (jus mangga), soursop (jus sirsak) and avocado (jus alpokat), the last of these being commonly served with condensed milk and chocolate syrup as a dessert-like treat. Durian can be made into ice cream called es durian. Indonesian dessert es teler, consisting of avocado, jackfruit, and young coconut in shredded ice and condensed milk. Many popular drinks are based on ice (es) and can also be classified as desserts. Typical examples include young coconut (es kelapa muda), grass jelly (es cincau), cendol (es cendol or es dawet), avocado, jackfruit and coconut with shreded ice and condensed milk (es teler), mixed ice (es campur), kidney beans (es kacang merah), musk melon (es blewah), and seaweed (es rumput laut). Hot sweet beverages can also be found, such as bajigur and bandrek which are particularly popular in West Java. Both are coconut milk or coconut sugar (gula jawa) based hot drinks, mixed with other spices. Sekoteng, a ginger based hot drink which includes peanuts, diced bread, and pacar cina, can be found in Jakarta and West Java. Wedang jahe (hot ginger drink) and wedang ronde (a hot drink with sweet potato balls) are particularly popular in Yogyakarta, Central Java, and East Java. =Alcoholic beverages= Balinese brem with 5% alcohol content. As a Muslim-majority country, Indonesian Muslims share Islamic dietary laws that prohibit alcoholic beverages. However, since ancient times, local alcoholic beverages were developed in the archipelago. According to a Chinese source, people of ancient Java drank wine made from palm sap called tuak (palm wine). Today tuak continues to be popular in the Batak region, North Sumatra. A traditional Batak bar serving tuak is called lapo tuak. In Solo, Central Java, ciu (a local adaptation of Chinese wine) is known. Bottled brem bali (Balinese rice wine) is popular in Bali. In Nusa Tenggara and Maluku Islands the people also drink palm wine, locally known as sopi. In the Minahasa region of North Sulawesi, the people drink a highly alcoholic drink called Cap Tikus. Indonesians developed local brands of beer, such as Bintang Beer and Anker Beer. Eating establishment In Indonesia, dishes are served from a fine dining restaurant in five-star hotel, a simple restaurant downtown, humble street side warung under the tent, to street hawker peddling their gerobak (cart) or pikulan (carrying using rod). =Restaurant and warung= Musi river, Palembang, selling local favourite such as pempek. In Indonesia rumah makan means restaurant, while warung means small and humble shop. From these eating establishments, a warteg (warung Tegal) and rumah makan Padang are particularly notable for their ubiquitousness in Indonesian cities and towns. A warteg or warung tegal is a more specific warung nasi, established by Javanese people from the town Tegal in Central Java. They sells favourite Javanese dishes and rice, the wide array of pre-cooked dishes are arranged in glass windowed cupboard. They are well known on selling modestly-priced meals, popular among working class such as low-skilled labours in the cities. While rumah makan Padang is a Padang restaurant, a smaller scale Padang eateries might be called warung Padang. Most of Indonesian restaurants are based upon specific regional cuisine tradition. For example, rumah makan Padang are definitely Minangkabau cuisine. Sundanese saung restaurant or colloquically called as kuring restaurants are selling Sundanese dishes. This includes Bataks' lapo, Manado and Balinese restaurants. While other restaurants might specifically featuring their best specific dishes, for example Ayam goreng Mbok Berek, Bakmi Gajah Mada, Satay Senayan, Rawon Setan Surabaya, Pempek Pak Raden, etc. =Street food= Soto mie cart street vendor Indonesian street food are usually cheap, offer a great variety of food of different tastes, and can be found on every corner of the city. Street and street-side vendors are common, in addition to hawkers peddling their goods on bicycles or carts. These carts are known as pedagang kaki lima. These food hawkers on carts or bicycles might be travelling on streets, approaching potential buyers through residential areas whilst announcing their presence, or stationing themselves on a packed and busy street side, setting simple seating under a small tent and waiting for customers. Many of these have their own distinctive call, tune, or noise to announce their presence. For example, bakso sellers will hit the side of a soup bowl using a spoon, whereas nasi goreng sellers announce themselves by hitting their wok. Bakso (meatball) seller in Bandung In most cities, it is common to see Chinese dishes such as bakpao (steamed buns with sweet and savoury fillings), bakmie (noodles), and bakso (meatballs) sold by street vendors and restaurants, often adapted to become Indonesian-Chinese cuisine. One common adaptation is that pork is rarely used since the majority of Indonesians are Muslims. Other popular Indonesian street food and snacks are siomay and batagor (abbreviated from Bakso Tahu Goreng), pempek (deep fried fish cake), bubur ayam (chicken congee), bubur kacang hijau (mung beans porridge), satay, nasi goreng (English: fried rice), soto mie (soto noodle), mie ayam (chicken noodle) and mie goreng (fried noodle), taoge goreng (mung bean sprouts and noodle salad), asinan (preserved vegetables or fruits salad), laksa, kerak telor (spicy omelette), gorengan (Indonesian assorted fritters) and Bakwan (fried dish of beansprouts and batter). Indonesian street snacks include iced and sweet beverages, such as es cendol or es dawet, es teler, es cincau, es doger, es campur, es potong, and es puter. Indonesian cakes and cookies are often called jajanan pasar (market munchies). Snacks =Kue= tahu isi, pisang goreng, risoles, timpan, lemper, and kue pisang. Indonesia has a rich collection of snacks called kue (cakes and pastry), both savoury and sweet. Traditional kue usually made from rice flour, coconut milk, coconut sugar and mostly steamed or fried instead of baked. Traditional kue are popularly known as kue basah (\\"wet kue\\") that has moisty and soft texture because of rich coconut milk. The kue kering (dried kue) is local name for cookies. Indonesia has rich variations of kue, both native-origin or foreign- influenced. Popular ones include Bika Ambon, kue pisang, kue cubit, klepon, onde-onde, nagasari, kue pandan, lupis, lemang, lemper, lontong, tahu isi, getuk, risoles, pastel, lumpia, bakpia, lapis legit, soes, poffertjes and bolu kukus. =Traditional crackers= Krupuks in air-tight tin cans. Traditional crackers are called krupuk, made from bits of shrimp, fish, vegetables or nuts, which are usually consumed as a crunchy snack or to accompany main meals. These crispy snacks sometimes are added upon the main meal to provide crunchy texture; several Indonesian dishes such as gado-gado, karedok, ketoprak, lontong sayur, nasi uduk, asinan and bubur ayam are known to require specific type of krupuk as toppings. There are wide variations of krupuk available across Indonesia. The most popular ones would be krupuk udang (prawn crackers) and krupuk kampung or krupuk putih (cassava crackers). Other popular types include krupuk kulit (dried buffalo-skin crackers), emping melinjo (gnetum gnemon crackers), and kripik (chips or crisps), such as kripik pisang (banana chips) and keripik singkong (Cassava chips), rempeyek, is a flour- based cracker with brittle of peanuts, anchovies or shrimp bound by crispy flour cracker, rengginang or intip (Javanese) is rice cracker made from sun- dried and deep fried leftover rice. Fruits Selection of tropical fruits sold in Bali. Indonesian markets abound with many types of tropical fruit. These are an important part of the Indonesian diet, either eaten freshly, or made into juices (such as jus alpukat), desserts (such as es buah and es teler), processed in savoury and spicy dishes like rujak, fried like pisang goreng (fried banana), cooked into cakes (such as kue pisang or bika ambon), sweetened and preserved such as sale pisang and manisan buah, or processed into kripik (crispy chips) as snacks like jackfruit or banana chips. Fruit rujak, consists of slices of unripe mango, jambu air, kedondong, jicama, papaya and pineapple. These fruits are served with thick and spicy coconut sugar and spicy salt. Many of these tropical fruits such as mangga (mango), manggis (mangosteen), rambutan, cempedak, nangka (jackfruit), durian, jambu air, duku (langsat), jeruk bali (pomelo), belimbing (carambola), kedondong and pisang (banana), are indigenous to Indonesian archipelago; while others have been imported from other tropical countries, although the origin of many of these fruits might be disputed. Klengkeng (longan) were introduced from India, semangka (watermelon) from Africa, kesemek from China, while alpukat (avocado), sawo, markisa (passionfruit), sirsak (soursop), nanas (pineapple), jambu biji (guava) and pepaya (papaya) were introduced from the Americas. Many of these tropical fruits are seasonally available, according to each species flowering and fruiting seasons. While certain fruits such as banana, watermelon, pineapple and papaya are available all year round. Today, Indonesian markets is also enrichen with selections of home-grown non-tropical fruits that is not native to Indonesia. Strawberry, melon, apple, pear and dragonfruit are introduced and grown in cooler Indonesian highlands such as Malang in mountainous East Java, Puncak and Lembang near Bandung, to mimic their native subtropics habitat. Rambutan for sale at a market in Jakarta. In the last few years, fruit chips have been more and more various. In the old times, banana and jackfruit chips were the most common, but now Indonesian fruit chips are also made from strawberry, apple, dragonfruit, pepino, watermelon, melon, more. Malang, a city in East Java, is the centre of fruit chip production aside from tempeh chips. Banana and coconut are particularly important, not only to Indonesian cuisine, but also in other uses, such as timber, bedding, roofing, oil, plates and packaging. Banana leaf and janur (young coconut leaf) are particularly important for packaging and cooking process, employed to make pepes, lontong and ketupat. Health =Nutrition= Deep frying mendoan tempeh, Indonesian food often prepared by deep frying which makes the food contains saturated fat and cholesterol. Much carbohydrate intake in Indonesian cuisine comes from rice, while in eastern parts of Indonesia, yam and sago are common. Indonesian protein intake comes from soy bean products that are processed into tofu and tempeh. Chicken eggs, poultry and meats are also consumed. Most of the fat intake comes from cooking oil (coconut oil) of fried dishes, coconut milk, peanuts, as well as meats and offals. Some Indonesian fruit and vegetable dishes such as fruit rujak, gado- gado, karedok, pecel, lalab, capcay, tofu and tempeh are foods with low fat and high fibre. Tempeh, for example, is a vegetarian substitute for meat. Some dishes, especially gorengan (deep-fried fritters) and those dishes infused or caramelised with coconut milk, such as rendang and gulai, might taste succulent but are rich in saturated fat. =Food safety= The authentic traditional Indonesian home cooking is freshly made and consumed daily with minimal or no processed, canned or preserved foods, which means there is a minimal amount of preservatives and sodium. Most ingredients are bought fresh very early in the morning from local traditional markets, cooked around the late morning and consumed mainly for lunch. The leftovers are stored in the cupboard or on the table covered with tudung saji (weaved bamboo food cover to protect the food from insects or other animals), all in room temperature to be heated and consumed again for dinner. Traditionally, Indonesian dishes are rarely stored for long periods of time, thus most of these dishes are cooked and consumed in the same day. Some exceptions apply to dried, salted, and processed food. For example, dry rendang may still be safe to consume for several days. Modern refrigeration technology is available in most households. =Hygiene= While most of Indonesian grocery products and food served in mid to upperscale eating establishments maintain food hygiene standard ranges from good to acceptable ‚Äî regulated and supervised by Badan Pengawasan Obat dan Makanan (Indonesian Food and Drug Administration) ‚Äî some warung traditional foodstalls and street vendors might have poor hygiene. The tropical microbes also might contribute to food poisoning cases mostly gastroenteritis, especially among foreigners during their stay in Indonesia. It is advisable to drink bottled or boiled drinking water, or choose cooked hot food instead of uncooked room temperatured ones sold by street vendors. For example, when consuming food sold by street vendors, consuming hot cooked mie ayam or soto is much safer than having gado-gado or fruit rujak.

In later literature he is known for his acid tongue and bullying, boorish behaviour, but in earlier accounts he was one of Arthur's premier warriors. Along with Bedivere, with whom he is frequently associated, Kay is one of the earliest characters associated with Arthur.See Rachel Bromwich's discussion in the \\"Notes on Personal Names\\", part of her edition of Trioedd Ynys Prydein: The Welsh Triads, second edition (Cardiff: University of Wales, 1978), pp. 303‚Äì307. Kay's father is called Ector in later literature, but the Welsh accounts name him as Cynyr Ceinfardqfog. Cai in Welsh tradition Cai or Cei is one of the earliest characters to be associated with the Arthurian mythology, appearing in a number of early Welsh texts, including Culhwch ac Olwen, Geraint fab Erbin, Iarlles y Ffynnon, Peredur fab Efrawg, Breuddwyd Rhonabwy, Pa Gur, and the Welsh Triads. His father is given as Cynyr Ceinfarfog (Fork-Beard), his son as Garanwyn and his daughter as Kelemon. Before Cai's birth, Cynyr prophesied that his son's heart would be eternally cold, that he would be exceptionally stubborn, and that no one would be able to brave fire or water like him. Cai is attributed with a number of further superhuman abilities, including the ability to go nine days and nine nights without the need to breathe or to sleep, the ability to grow as \\"tall as the tallest tree in the forest if he pleased\\" and the ability to radiate supernatural heat from his hands.S. Davies translation, The Mabinogion (Oxford 2007) p. 189. Furthermore, it is impossible to cure a wound from Cai's sword.Gantz, Jeffrey. The Mabinogion. Cai is killed by Gwyddawg fab (son of) Menestyr, who is in turn killed in vengeance by Arthur. Robert Graves commented that the early description of Kai \\"is close to the account given of the Sun-hero Cuchulain in his battle rage. But in the later Arthurian legends Kai has degenerated into a buffoon and Chief of Cooks\\"R. Graves, The White Goddess (Manchester 1999) p. 91. \\\\- an aspect of the folklore process whereby old heroes must be downgraded (but not forgotten) in order to make room for new.H. Mustard translation, Parzival (New York 1961) p. 16. =Pa Gur yv y Porthaur= One of the earliest direct reference to Cai can be found in the 10th-century poem Pa Gur, in which Arthur recounts the feats and achievements of his warriors so as to gain entrance to a fortress guarded by Glewlwyd Gafaelfawr, the titular porter. The poem concerns itself largely with Cai's exploits: =Culhwch ac Olwen= Culhwch and his companions at Ysbadadden's court in Ernest Wallcousins illustration for Celtic Myth & Legend (1920) Culhwch's father, King Cilydd son of Celyddon, loses his wife Goleuddydd after a difficult childbirth. When he remarries, the young Culhwch rejects his stepmother's attempt to pair him with his new stepsister. Offended, the new queen puts a curse on him so that he can marry no one besides the beautiful Olwen, daughter of the giant Ysbaddaden. Though he has never seen her, Culhwch becomes infatuated with her, but his father warns him that he will never find her without the aid of his famous cousin Arthur. The young man immediately sets off to seek his kinsman. He finds him at his court in Celliwig in Cornwall and asks for support and assistance. Cai is the first knight to volunteer to assist Culhwch in his quest,S. Davies translation, The Mabinogion (Oxford 2007) p. 189. promising to stand by his side until Olwen is found. A further five knights join them in their mission. They travel onwards until they come across the \\"fairest of the castles of the world\\", and meet Ysbaddaden's shepherd brother, Custennin. They learn that the castle belongs to Ysbaddaden, that he stripped Custennin of his lands and murdered the shepherd's twenty-three children out of cruelty. Custennin set up a meeting between Culhwch and Olwen, and the maiden agrees to lead Culhwch and his companions to Ysbadadden's castle. Cai pledges to protect the twenty-fourth son, Goreu with his life.S. Davies translation, The Mabinogion (Oxford 2007) p. 193. The knights attack the castle by stealth, killing the nine porters and the nine watchdogs, and enter the giant's hall. Upon their arrival, Ysbaddaden attempts to kill Culhwch with a poison dart, but is outwitted and wounded, first by Bedwyr, then by the enchanter Menw, and finally by Culhwch himself. Eventually, Ysbaddaden relents, and agrees to give Culhwch his daughter on the condition that he completes a number of impossible tasks (anoethau), including hunting the Twrch Trwyth and recovering the exalted prisoner Mabon ap Modron. Cai is a prominent character throughout the tale and is responsible for completing a number of the tasks; he kills Wrnach the Giant, rescues Mabon ap Modron from his watery prison and retrieving the hairs of Dillus the Bearded.S. Davies translation, The Mabinogion (Oxford 2007) pp. 202-7. However, when Arthur makes a satirical englyn about Cai, he grows angry and hostile towards the king, ultimately abandoning the quest and his companions. The narrative tells us that Cai would \\"have nothing to do with Arthur from then on, not when the latter was waning in strength or when his men were being killed.\\" As a result, he did not take part in the hunt for Twrch Trwyth. =Other appearances= In the Life of St. Cadoc (c.1100) Bedwyr is alongside Arthur and Cai in dealing with King Gwynllyw of Gwynllwg's abduction of St. Gwladys from her father's court in Brycheiniog. Cai appears prominently in the early Welsh version of Tristan and Isolde, in which he assists the two lovers and is himself infatuated with a maiden named Golwg Hafddydd,Trystan and Esyllt. and in the early dialogue poems relating to Melwas' abduction of Gwenhwyfar. The context suggests that Cai is rescuing the queen from the otherworldly suitor, and may imply a romantic relationship between Cai and Gwenhwyfar.The Dialogue of Melwas and Gwenhwyfar. The Welsh Triads name Cai as one of the \\"Three Battle-Diademed Men of the Island of Britain\\" alongside Drystan mab Tallwch and Hueil mab Caw.Bromwich, Rachel. Trioedd Ynys Prydein. In the Triads of the Horses, his horse is named as Gwyneu gwddf hir (Gwyneu of the Long Neck). According to tradition, Cai is intimately associated with the old Roman fort of Caer Gai.Bromwich, Rachel. Cei at Celtnet. In the Welsh Romances (specifically Owain, or the Lady of the Fountain and Peredur son of Efrawg), Cai assumes the same boorish role he takes in the continental romances.S. Davies translation, The Mabinogion (Oxford 2007) p. 246. However, manuscripts for these romances date to well after Chr√©tien de Troyes, meaning that Cai as he appears there may owe more to Chr√©tien's version of the character than to the indigenous Welsh representation. Kay in chronicles and romances \\"Sir Kay breaketh his sword at ye Tournament\\" from The Story of King Arthur and His Knights by Howard Pyle (1903) Kay and Bedivere both appear in Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regum Britanniae, and support Arthur in his defeat of the Giant of Mont Saint-Michel.L. Thorpe translation, The History of the Kings of Britain (Penguin 1966) pp. 238-9. Geoffrey makes Kay the count of Anjou and Arthur's steward, an office which he holds in most later literature. In Chr√©tien de Troyes's Erec and Enide, a son Gronosis is mentioned, who is versed in evil. By contrast, the Welsh attribute to him a son and daughter named Garanwyn and Celemon. Romance literature rarely deals with Kay's love life, with one exception being Girart d'Amiens' Escanor, which details his love for Andrivete of Northumbria, whom he must defend from her uncle's political machinations before they can marry. In the works of Chr√©tien, Kay assumes the characteristics with which he is most associated today: hot- headedness and fiery temper (retained from the Welsh literature), supplemented by his role as an incompetent braggart. Chr√©tien uses him as a scoffer and a troublemaker; a foil for heroic knights including Lancelot, Ywain, or Gawain. He mocks the chivalric courtesy of Sir Calogrenant in Yvain, the Knight of the Lion, and he tricks Arthur into allowing him to try to save Guinevere from Maleagant in Lancelot, the Knight of the Cart, which ends in his humiliating defeat. In Perceval, the Story of the Grail, Sir Kay grows angry with Perceval's na√Øvet√© and slaps a maiden who says he will become a great knight; Perceval later avenges her by breaking Kay's shoulder. Wolfram von Eschenbach, who tells a similar story in his Parzival, asks his audience not to judge Kay too harshly, as his sharp words actually serve to maintain courtly order: \\"Though few may agree with me - Keie was a brave and loyal man...The mighty Keie.\\"H. Mustard translation, Parzival (New York 1961) pp. 159-60. Kay and Lancelot in a Siedlƒôcin Tower fresco (early 14th century) Kay is ubiquitous in Arthurian literature but he rarely serves as anything but a foil for other characters. Although he manipulates the king to get his way, his loyalty to Arthur is usually unquestioned. In the Vulgate Cycle, the Post-Vulgate and Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur, Kay's father Ector adopts the infant Arthur after Merlin takes him away from his birth parents, Uther and Igraine. Ector raises the future king and Kay as brothers, but Arthur's parentage is revealed when he draws the Sword in the Stone at a tournament in London. Arthur, serving as squire to the newly knighted Kay, is locked out of the house and cannot get to his brother's sword, so he uses the Sword in the Stone to replace it. Kay shows his characteristic opportunism when he tries to claim it was in fact he that pulled the sword from the stone, not Arthur, making Kay the true King of the Britons, but he ultimately relents and admits it was Arthur.H. Cooper edition, Le Morte Dathur (Oxford 2008) p. 9. He becomes one of the first Knights of the Round Table, described as \\"best worthy to be a knight of the Round Table of any\\",H. Cooper edition, Le Morte Dathur (Oxford 2008) p. 60. and serves his foster-brother throughout his life. Scholars have pointed out that Kay's scornful, overly boastful character never makes him a clown, a coward or a traitor, except in the Grail romance Perlesvaus, in which he murders Arthur's son Loholt and joins up with the king's enemies. This strange work is an anomaly, however, and Kay's portrayal tends to range from merely cruel and malicious, as in the Roman de Yder or Hartmann von Aue's Iwein to humorously derisive and even endearing, as in Durmart le Gallois and Escanor. Despite his ubiquity, Kay's death is not a frequent subject in the Arthurian canon. In Welsh literature, it is mentioned he was killed by Gwyddawg and avenged by Arthur. In Geoffrey of Monmouth and the Alliterative Morte Arthure, he is killed in the war against the Roman Emperor Lucius,L. Thorpe translation, The History of the Kings of Britain (Penguin 1966) p. 257. while the Vulgate Cycle describes his death in France, also in battle against the Romans. According to Malory's Book 5, Kay does not die in the war against Rome, but rather survives and later is part of a party sent to try and retrieve Excalibur's sacred scabbard, prior to the Battle of Camlann. He is also among the few people who survives the battle of Camlann, although it is ambiguous as to how he does so; in later interpretations it is suggested that he never participated in that battle. Modern interpretations *Kay is a main character in the first three books of T. H. White's The Once and Future King, The Sword in the Stone and The Queen of Air and Darkness. His portrayal is based on Malory's account of Arthur's upbringing, but White adds a number of new elements to the story, including one in which the young Kay kills a dangerous griffin with the aid of Robin Hood and Maid Marian. White's Kay is quick-witted and often mean, but always a loving foster brother to Arthur, whom he calls \\"the Wart\\". **Kay appears in the 1963 Walt Disney Studios animated film adaptation of The Sword in the Stone, where he is voiced by actor Norman Alden. Though he is inept at jousting and sword fighting, Ector remains determined to groom him for knighthood and to possibly take the crown. Kay serves as a foil to Arthur, being self-centered, lazy, and outwardly boorish and bitter. Kay constantly bullies Arthur, and has a grudge against him, often trying to physically hurt him for his mistakes. However, when Arthur becomes king, Kay comes to respect Arthur as the king, as shown when he reluctantly bows down to Arthur at first, then does so sincerely, and also shows guilt for the way he treated him in the past. *Kay is the main character of Phyllis Ann Karr's 1982 novel The Idylls of the Queen. Expanding on a scene from the classic tales in which a knight is poisoned at Guinevere's feast and the queen is accused of the crime, Karr turns her story into a murder mystery with Kay as the detective attempting to discover the truth. *In Marion Zimmer Bradley's 1983 The Mists of Avalon, Kay (spelled Cai) is Arthur's foster- brother. After a near fatal accident as a small child, Arthur is sent to live with Cai and his father, Ectorius. Cai and Arthur love each other very much, and after Arthur is crowned, he tells Cai, \\"God strike me if I ever ask that you, brother, should call me [king].\\" Cai is described as having a facial scar and a limp, two injuries that he received while protecting Arthur during a Saxon invasion. Cai is made Arthur's knight and chamberlain, and he keeps Arthur's castle for him. *In Thomas Berger's 1978 Arthur Rex: A Legendary Novel, Kay is a somewhat foppish, sharp-tongued gourmand. Relieved to be freed from his bucolic upbringing in Wales, he takes charge of the kitchens at Camelot and yearns to make it a more sophisticated court. Arthur good- naturedly complains that Sir Kay is always serving him rich foods, when the king would rather just have simple meals. Kay supplies occasional comic relief in the book, but ultimately fights and dies with honour in the last battle against Mordred's host. *In the 1970s TV series Arthur of the Britons, Kay (spelled Kai) was played by Michael Gothard. In this version of the legend, Arthur is a Celtic chieftain and Kai is a Saxon orphan, raised together as brothers by an adoptive father, Llud, among the Celts. He is portrayed as somewhat hot-headed and sometimes distracted by female company, but a fiercely capable warrior (sometimes favouring an axe-weapon) and Arthur's most trusted and loyal friend. *In Gillian Bradshaw's Down the Long Wind series, Cei is Arthur's infantry commander. He is a large man with fiery hair and a temper to match, but with a strong sense of honour and loyalty to Arthur. *In Stephen R. Lawhead's Pendragon Cycle Kay, spelled Cai, is Arthur's most loyal companion. As a child he had a crippled leg and Arthur was one of the few who defends him. This earns Arthur his complete and unquestioning loyalty. He dies in the battle against Mordred. *In comedy TV series Kaamelott, Kay is portrayed as a rogue centurion and rival of Arthur named Caius who refused to follow his troops back to Rome and therefore Celticised his name and was given knighthood by Arthur to end their rivalry. *In the 2011 TV series Camelot, Kay is played by Canadian actor Peter Mooney. In this American-Irish-Canadian adaption of Arthurian Legend, Kay is portrayed as a loyal and protective older brother to Arthur. Although raised in a rural setting, he appears educated and somewhat idealistic, described by the actor who plays him as having \\"a world of book- smarts, but no practical experience [of how be a warrior]\\".Starz channel promotion \\"Camelot: Focus on Kay\\". *Sir Kay briefly appears in the season 5 opener of Once Upon a Time, where he betrays Arthur and attempts to pull Excalibur out of the stone to rule Camelot for himself. When he attempts to do so, he is proven unworthy, and the protection around the sword turns him to dust. *He appears in Philip Reeve's Here Lies Arthur, as Cei, Arthur's loyal half-brother and friend to the bard Myrddin (Merlin) at the beginning, before their friendship wanes over his stories designed to improve Arthur's reputation. He is later murdered in person by a character known as 'The Irishman', while riding to the Irishman's aid against raiders. The Irishman attacked their camp overnight, on the order of Myrddin, as many viewed him as a superior leader to Arthur. The other members of Arthur's army who were untrusted were also killed by the Irishman and his soldiers. The main character, Gwyn/Gwyna, and Peredur (Percival), were the only two to escape and survive the attack.

History =Early history and development= Cobble Hill ‚Äì which was named after the conical shaped hill called \\"Cobleshill\\" or \\"Ponkiesbergh\\", located where the current intersection of Atlantic Avenue, Pacific Street, and Court Street now lies ‚Äì was originally settled during the 1640s by Dutch farmers when Willem Kieft, the director of New Netherland, granted patents in the area. The hill was used as a fort ‚Äì known as \\"Cobble Hill Fort\\", \\"Smith's Barbette\\", or \\"Corkscrew Fort\\" ‚Äì during the American War of Independence; the British cut off the top of the hill during their occupation, so it could not be used to look down on their headquarters in Brooklyn Heights. They also seized the estate of Philip Livingston for use as a naval hospital. Cobble Hill was again fortified for the War of 1812, and was then called \\"Fort Swift\\". In 1834, the Village of Brooklyn ‚Äì chartered in 1816 and primarily made up of present-day Brooklyn Heights ‚Äì became a city and soon expanded south beyond Atlantic Street (now Atlantic Avenue) to include South Brooklyn. Until the establishment of the South Ferry, which connected Atlantic Avenue to Manhattan's Whitehall Street in 1836, South Brooklyn was primarily rural. After that time, with the guidelines for a gridiron street pattern already established in 1834, the area developed rapidly. New streets were being laid progressively, and with the development of new buildings ‚Äì which started nearer to the waterfront and moved inward ‚Äì the rural community slowly started changing into a middle-class suburban residential community dominated by small rows of houses, which began to be built as early as 1835. The transformation of the neighborhood was nearly completed by 1860; none of the farm houses from the neighborhood's rural period are extant.\\"Workingman's Cottages\\" built by philanthropist Alfred Tredway White as low-cost housing in 1876 (shown here in 2009) According to the 1840 tax list and street directory, the neighborhood of present-day Cobble Hill contained 45 houses and 112 residents. Although this housing boom caused prices to rise, in 1850 it was still possible for a clerk to pay rent of $200 a year ($6,130 in 2018 dollars)http://www.in2013dollars.com/1850-dollars-in-2018?amount=200 for a row house with a large backyard, albeit on a narrow lot. This provoked an influx of new residents from Manhattan. Philanthropist Alfred Tredway White built two experimental housing projects in the neighborhood. These were the Romanesque revival \\"Towers\\" and \\"Home\\" buildings (now collectively known as Cobble Hill Towers), at 417‚Äì435 and 439-45 Hicks Street, meant as affordable housing for the working class, with adequate light and air for all; and the \\"Workingman's Cottages\\" of Warren Place, a one block mews from Warren Street to Baltic Street between Henry and Hicks Streets, which was two rows of narrow single family houses ( wide) built around a private courtyard. These were intended for slightly more upscale workers. All were built on adjoining lots in 1876 and were designed by William Field & Son; they were restored in 1986 by Maitland, Strauss & Behr. With these projects, which served Native Americans, Irish, Swedes, Norwegians, English, and German workmen, White became the first builder of low rent/low profit housing in the United States. His philosophy was \\"Philanthropy plus 5%\\". Beginning in the 1840s and progressing into the 1870s, wealthier Manhattanites, including bankers and merchants, began to move to various parts of Brooklyn, including Cobble Hill. By 1880 the population of the area was solidly upper-middle class, and the cost of houses had almost equaled those in Brooklyn Heights, of which Cobble Hill was an outgrowth. The Cobble Hill Historic District Designation Report lists the architecture of the neighborhood as including many rowhouses in the Greek Revival and Italianate styles and their offshoots, but also examples of the Romanesque Revival, Gothic Revival, Queen Anne, French Second Empire, and neo-Grec styles. =20th century= The 20th century saw an influx of immigrants into the neighborhood from Ireland, Italy, and the Middle East; some low-rise apartment buildings were constructed prior to the 1920s. After a period of relative quiet, by 1950, brownstones were being rejuvenated and the neighborhood began to experience a renaissance, leading to the revival of the \\"Cobble Hill\\" name, perhaps engendered by a real estate agent who saw the name \\"Cobles Hill\\" on a 1766 map and updated it. Organized community groups fought against large housing projects, and prevailed on the city to make the area an historic district. The historic district ‚Äì first designated by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (NYLPC) on December 20, 1969 and extended on June 7, 1988, ‚Äì is roughly bordered by Atlantic Avenue to the north, Court Street to the east, Degraw Street to the south, and Hicks Street to the west, with a \\"bite\\" removed from the northeast corner of that rectangle. Its area measures approximately twenty-two city blocks. According to the NYLPC, the Cobble Hill Historic District is an \\"unusually fine 19th century residential area\\" and \\"retains an aura of the past with its charming streets and architecture.\\" The Cobble Hill Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. Today on the two main commercial streets ‚Äì Court and Smith Streets ‚Äì generations-old family-run stores and businesses such as Italian meat markets and old time barber shops sit side-by-side with trendy new shops, restaurants, and cafes. Atlantic Avenue, the northern border of the neighborhood, features one of New York City's largest collections of Middle-Eastern shops, some of which have been there for decades. The northern part of Smith Street is known as Brooklyn's \\"Restaurant Row\\" due to the large number of eateries and watering holes that opened on the street during the late 1990s and early 2000s. With a second blossoming of specialized bars along the corridor in the late 2000s, Smith Street became an upscale weekend nightlife destination.\\"Street Level: New Bars in the Works on Smith\\" The Brownstoner (March 5, 2008). Cobble Hill Park Cobble Hill Park with snow on the ground Cobble Hill Park, on Clinton Street between Verandah Place and Congress Street, was created in 1965. The site had been the location of two mansions (the Weber and Whitten Mansions) and the Second Unitarian Church, which was abandoned by the 1940s, when the site was purchased by the Bohack Corporation, a supermarket chain. The mansions were demolished, and in the 1960s the corporation planned to build a supermarket on the site, a proposition which was opposed by the Cobble Hill community, which felt the need for a park for the neighborhood. Bohack sold the site to developers in 1962, who planned to build a low-rise apartment building. The community collected signatures and successfully petitioned the city to create a park. The city bought the property in 1963 and the park was dedicated in 1965. It was reconstructed in 1989, winning the 1988 Annual Award for Excellence in Design from the Art Commission and the Parks Council's Philip Winslow Award for Public Projects in 1990, the first time it was awarded. The new design reflected the 19th-century brick-and-stone character of the tree-lined neighborhood.\\"Cobble Hill Park: History\\", New York City Department of Parks and Recreation.

Some have been converted for residential use. * Christ Church and Holy Family at Clinton and Kane Streets, built in 1840‚Äì41, was an early design in the Gothic Revival style by Richard Upjohn Some of the interior furnishings are by Louis Comfort Tiffany, and date from 1937. Christ Church was the first organized religious group in the Cobble Hill area, having been founded in 1835. The congregation later merged with that of the Church of the Holy Family. * Old St. Paul's Church at Court and Congress Streets was designed by Gamaliel King and built c.1838, allowing the claim that this church is the oldest Roman Catholic church in continuous use in Brooklyn. The steeple was added in the 1860s, and other enlargements were made. The church front faces Court Street, the chapel and former rectory face Congress Street. The parish was originally largely Irish. * Congregation Baith Israel Anshei Emes, which splintered off an earlier congregation, is located at 236 Kane Street in Cobble Hill, in the former Middle Dutch Reformed Church, built in the Romanesque style c.1856. It is currently the oldest continuously operating synagogue in Brooklyn.\\"Kane Street Synagogue (Baith Israel-Anshei Emeth), Brooklyn, NY Records\\" , Jewish Theological Seminary of America * St. Peter's Roman Catholic Church on Hicks Street, built in 1860 and designed by Patrick Charles Keely, was part of a complex which included the church, a school, and a hospital. The church and the school have been converted to host condominium apartments. The original parish was largely Italian. * South Brooklyn Seventh- Day Adventist Church at 249 Degraw Street was built in 1905 as the Trinity German Lutheran Church, and was designed by Theobald Engelhart. * St. Francis Cabrini Roman Catholic Chapel at Degraw Street and Strong Place was built in 1851‚Äì52 as the Strong Place Baptist Church. It was designed by Minard Lafever in the Gothic Revival style. The building was converted into apartments in 2010. * The Second Unitarian Church, known as the \\"Church of the Turtle\\" because it physically resembled one, was designed by Jacob Wrey Mould and built in 1858 on the site where Cobble Hill Park is today.

It began a school of medicine, the Long Island College of Medicine, in 1850; the school became a separate institution in 1930, and since 1954 was the primary teaching affiliate of SUNY Downstate Medical Center. The first private bacteriological laboratory in the United States, Hoagland Laboratory, was built in 1888 at 335 Henry Street, but was destroyed by fire and is no longer extant. The Polhemus Building, now Polhemus Memorial Clinic, was built in 1897 and was designed by Marshall Emery in the French Mannerist style. Dudley Memorial, designed by William Hough was built in 1902. Other buildings were designed by D. Everett Waid and William Higginson. Further expansion took place in the modern era, with buildings raised in 1963, 1974, 1984, and 1988. The hospital was the sixth largest in Brooklyn. After the closure of Long Island College Hospital in August 2014, a freestanding emergency department‚ÄîNYU Cobble Hill, part of NYU Langone Medical Center‚Äîopened in October 2014. The hospital plans to replace the existing facility with a new ambulatory care center and freestanding emergency department at the site, estimated to cost $200 million. Other points of interest * The DeGraw Mansion, also known as the Ralph L. Cutter House, at Clinton and Amity Streets, was built in 1845 and altered in 1891 with a tower in order to see the harbor, the view of which had become blocked by the development of the neighborhood. * The former Dr. Joseph E. Clark House, at 340 Clinton Street between Degraw and Kane Streets, was built c.1860, and is \\"the widest single house in Cobble Hill.\\" * 272 Warren Street, a neo-Grec house built c.1899, stands out from its neighbors * 174 Pacific Street between Clinton and Court Streets, was built in 1889 as Public School 78 * The commercial building that now houses Trader Joe's, formerly the South Brooklyn Savings Institution and then the Independence Savings Bank, was built in 1922 and was designed by McKenzie, Voorhees & Gmelin in the Florentine Renaissance style. Located at 130 Court Street at Atlantic Avenue, it was added to in 1936 by Charles A. Holmes. The cornice features one hundred eagles. The site is the location where General George Washington watched his troops retreat from the Battle of Long Island. Transportation The Atlantic Avenue Tunnel, photographed in 2009 The Cobble Hill Tunnel, under Atlantic Avenue, was built in 1844 to replace the railroad tracks that ran down the middle of Atlantic Avenue as part of the Atlantic Avenue Railroad. Trains used these tracks to transport goods to and from the waterfront during the 1840s, and the tunnel was built to avoid the trains' need to climb a steep hill. The tunnel is now abandoned, but originally ran from Times Plaza to the Ferry Terminal. The brick-lined vaulted tunnel is high by wide and long. Walt Whitman, the poet and editor of the Brooklyn Daily Eagle, said the tunnel was \\"a passage of solemnity and darkness\\". New York City Subway service is available at the Bergen Street station on the IND Culver Line (). The (Atlantic Avenue) and (Court Street) bus routes also serve the area. In June 2017, NYC Ferry's South Brooklyn route started stopping at Brooklyn Bridge Park Pier 6 on the border of Cobble Hill and Brooklyn Heights. There are plans to build the Brooklyn‚ÄìQueens Connector (BQX), a light rail system that would run along the waterfront from Red Hook through Cobble Hill to Astoria in Queens. However, the system is projected to cost $2.7 billion, and the projected opening has been delayed until at least 2029.

She participated in the Teacher in Space program as backup to Christa McAuliffe for the 1986 ill-fated STS-51-L mission of the Space Shuttle Challenger. She then trained as a Mission Specialist, and flew on STS-118 in August 2007. Early life and education Morgan was born to Dr. and Mrs. Jerry Radding in 1951 and raised in Fresno, California, where she attended Herbert Hoover High School. Following graduation in 1969, she was accepted to Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, where she graduated with distinction in 1973 with a B.A. in Human Biology. She obtained her teaching credential from Notre Dame de Namur University in nearby Belmont in 1974. Teaching career Morgan began her teaching career in 1974 on the Flathead Indian Reservation at Arlee Elementary School in Arlee, Montana, where she taught remedial reading and math. From 1975 to 1978, she taught remedial reading/math and second grade at McCall-Donnelly Elementary School in McCall, Idaho. From 1978 to 1979, Morgan taught English and science to third graders at Colegio Americano de Quito in Quito, Ecuador, for a year. From 1979 to 1998, Morgan taught second, third, and fourth grades at McCall-Donnelly Elementary School. Teacher in Space Project Christa McAuliffe and Morgan in 1985. Morgan was selected as the backup candidate for the NASA Teacher in Space Project on July 19, 1985. From September 1985 to January 1986, Morgan trained with Christa McAuliffe and the Space Shuttle Challenger crew at NASA's Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas. Following McAuliffe's death in the Challenger disaster, Morgan assumed the duties of Teacher in Space Designee. From March 1986 to July 1986, she worked with NASA, speaking to educational organizations throughout the country. In the fall of 1986, Morgan returned to Idaho to resume her teaching career. She taught second and third grades at McCall-Donnelly Elementary and continued to work with NASA's Education Division, Office of Human Resources and Education. Her duties as Teacher in Space Designee included public speaking, educational consulting, curriculum design, and serving on the National Science Foundation's Federal Task Force for Women and Minorities in Science and Engineering. NASA career In January 1998, 12 years after McAuliffe's death, Morgan was selected by NASA as an astronaut candidate (Mission Specialist) and reported to the Johnson Space Center in August 1998 to begin training to become a full-time astronaut. Following the completion of two years of training and evaluation, she was assigned technical duties in the Astronaut Office Space Station Operations Branch. She served in the Astronaut Office CAPCOM Branch, working in Mission Control as prime communicator with on-orbit crews. Like many other astronauts and cosmonauts, Morgan is a licensed amateur radio operator, having passed the technician class license exam in 2003. This qualified her to use the facilities of the Amateur Radio on the International Space Station (ARISS) project. Morgan's duties as a Mission Specialist were no different than those of other crew members. While NASA press releases and media briefings often referred to her as a \\"Mission Specialist Educator\\" or \\"Educator Astronaut\\", Morgan did not train in the Educator Astronaut Project. NASA Administrator Michael D. Griffin clarified at a press conference after STS-118 that Morgan was not considered a Mission Specialist Educator, but rather was a standard Mission Specialist, who had been a teacher. Prior to her flight on STS-118, NASA seemed to limit Morgan's exposure to the press, but she did a series of interviews shortly before the start of the mission about what the crew of STS-118 would be doing to help build the International Space Station, commenting, \\"You know, there's a great sense of pride to be able to be involved in a human endeavor that takes us all a little bit farther. When you look down and see our Earth, and you realize what we are trying to do as a human race, it's pretty profound.\\" Three weeks after Morgan's mission ended, she conducted her first space education assignment at Walt Disney World in Florida. Morgan's words from that day were etched into a plaque on a wall of Mission: Space. The \\"Wall of Honor\\" contains quotes from notable people, such as Neil Armstrong, John F. Kennedy, Charles Lindbergh, Stephen Hawking, Carl Sagan, Galileo, and Christa McAuliffe. Morgan's plaque is placed beside McAuliffe's, which says: \\"Space is for everybody ... That's our new frontier out there.\\" This event was one of a series of lectures Morgan would complete. =Spaceflight experience= STS-118, an assembly mission to the International Space Station, successfully launched from Florida's Kennedy Space Center at 6:36:42 p.m. EDT, 8 August 2007. Morgan served as robotic arm operator and transfer coordinator, coordinating the transfer of over of cargo to the International Space Station, and bringing home over . In addition to her other duties, Morgan participated in twenty-minute amateur radio question-and-answer sessions with young people at the Discovery Center of Idaho and other centers, and joined Mission Specialist Alvin Drew in an education event with young people at the Challenger Center for Space Science Education in Alexandria, Virginia. The event was hosted by June Scobee, widow of Space Shuttle Challenger's commander, Richard \\"Dick\\" Scobee. The center honored Morgan with the President George H.W. Bush Leadership Award. STS-118 landed successfully at Kennedy Space Center on August 21, a day ahead of schedule due to concerns about Hurricane Dean. Post-NASA career On June 28, 2008, Morgan announced that she would leave NASA for a teaching job at Boise State University. In August 2008, Morgan took a full-time position as a Distinguished Educator in Residence; a dual appointment to BSU's colleges of engineering and education. There she advises, leads and represents the university in policy development, advocacy and fund-raising in science, technology, engineering and math. On July 4, 2008, Morgan received the \\"Friend of Education\\" award from the National Education Association. The following month Barbara R. Morgan Elementary School opened in McCall, Idaho.Barbara R. Morgan Elementary School. Retrieved January 30, 2012. She appeared on Netflix Documentary: Challenger: The Final Flight. Awards and honors Morgan received the Adler Planetarium Women in Space Science Award in 2008. Actress Mary Chris Wall portrayed Morgan in the 1990 television film Challenger.

Wilson & H.A. Wilson Early references to the area also use the form \\"Ireland Green\\". The earliest documented reference to \\"Herne Hill\\" is in two fire insurance policies issued by the Sun Insurance Company in 1792 (where the spelling is \\"Hearns\\" and \\"Herns\\" Hill).See article by B. Nurse, Herne Hill Society Magazine, Summer 2016, https://issuu.com/hernehillsociety/docs/herne-hill-mag-135. The earliest recorded reference on a map is in James Edwards, A Companion from London to Brighthelmston, in Sussex: Consisting of a Set of Topographical Maps from Actual Surveys. Edwards' Companion was published in complete form in 1801, but the relevant map has the publication date 1 March 1800. The map uses the spelling \\"Hearn\\". The descriptive text, which does not mention Herne Hill, refers to the survey being under way in 1789. The name therefore appeared at some point between then and 1800, prompted by the need to find a description for the location of the newly built houses, though it is likely it must have been in use orally long before then. This is consistent with the evidence of the fire insurance policies and a small sketch by Thomas Girtin (1705‚Äì1802), inscribed ‚ÄúHerne Hill‚Äù and not dated, but attributed to 1796/7 in D. Girtin and D.

Alternatively, it may take its name from the family called Herne mentioned in connection with nearby Dulwich from the 17th century (although their surname almost certainly derives from the same, or a similar, early place name). A link to ‚Äúheron‚Äù has also been suggested, the river Effra being once frequented by herons. History Herne Hill and Half Moon Lane in 1823.

Herne Hill was transformed by the arrival of the London, Chatham & Dover Railway in 1862. Cheap and convenient access to London Victoria, the City of London, Kent and south-west London created demand for middle-class housing; the terraced streets that now characterise the area were constructed in the decades after the opening of Herne Hill station and the old estates were entirely built over. A letter reporting a Herne Hill sighting of Victorian folklore demon Spring-heeled Jack, \\"that malapropre fellow of the ghost\\", was published in the Camberwell and Peckham Times on 9 November 1872. The incident was recorded as taking place where the footpath on Herne Hill ran past St.Paul's Church into Half Moon Lane. The Half Moon is a Grade II* listed public house in Half Moon Lane. Herne Hill escaped lightly from V-weapons attacks during World War II, with five V-1 flying bombs and six deaths recorded. During the early morning of 7 August 2013, an 88‚Äëyear‚Äëold 0.9 m diameter water main on Half Moon Lane burst, flooding Herne Hill, Dulwich Road and Norwood Road along with 36 properties (including the Half Moon public house) to create a scene described as \\"biblical\\" by local residents. Thames Water admitted liability and estimated the total cost of the damage to be around ¬£4 million. The Half Moon reopened in March 2017, following a vigorous local campaign to save it as a pub; Southwark Council has designated it an asset of community value.Mike Urban, \\"Campaign to save the Herne Hill‚Äôs Half Moon pub gathers momentum with an ACV application\\", Brixton Buzz, 27 November 2015.\\"Latest on The Half Moon\\", Herne Hill Society. Geography The Carnegie Library, Herne Hill Road Herne Hill is situated between Brixton, Dulwich Village and Camberwell. It also straddles two boroughs, and is a community of around 15,000 people, with a range of independent shops, art galleries, bars and restaurants. The Southwark half of Herne Hill is part of what is now called the 'North Dulwich Triangle' by estate agents. Famous Herne Hill residents from history include John Ruskin and the Lupino family, and actor Roddy McDowall was born there. Local landmarks The area is home to the Brockwell Park. Near a hilltop in Brockwell Park stands the Grade II* listed Brockwell Hall, which was built in 1831. The hall and the land surrounding it were opened to the public in 1891 after being purchased by London County Council. Brockwell Park hosts the annual Lambeth Country Show and was the site of London's Gay Pride festival for several years in the 1990s. The park also houses Brockwell Lido, a 1937 open-air swimming-pool that faces on to Dulwich Road. Herne Hill railway station on Railton Road was opened by the London, Chatham and Dover Railway in 1862; the Gothic, polychrome brick station building was Grade II listed in 1998. The associated railway viaduct and bridges are also noteworthy; The Building News stated in 1863 that the viaduct was \\"one of the most ornamental pieces of work we have ever seen attempted on a railway\\" for its fine brickwork. The Herne Hill Velodrome, situated in a park off Burbage Road, was built in 1891 and hosted the track cycling events in the 1948 Summer Olympics. Unlike most modern, steeply-banked velodromes, it is a shallow concrete bowl; the 'Save the Herne Hill Velodrome' campaign is seeking a way to secure the future of the site.

A Blue Plaque at 84 Burbage Road marks the former home of the athletics coach Sam Mussabini. Mussabini was later immortalised in the film Chariots of Fire, in which he was played by actor Ian Holm. In 1894, Mussabini was appointed coach to the Dunlop cycling team which trained at the Herne Hill Velodrome. In 1913, Mussabini was appointed coach to the Polytechnic Harriers at the Herne Hill athletics track, which ran round the inside of the Velodrome cycle track. Here he trained athletes, including the fourteen-year-old Harold Abrahams. In recognition of the historical importance and specialist character of the area within its urban context, Stradella Road was designated as a Conservation Area, by Southwark Council in 2000, under the Civic Amenities Act of 1967. The Conservation Area consists principally of properties in Stradella and Winterbrook Roads, and includes bordering properties in Burbage Road and Half Moon Lane. The Half Moon Public House on Half Moon Lane was built in 1896 (although a tavern has existed on the site since the 17th century) and was Grade II* listed in 1998. The pub hosted a boxing gym for more than 50 years.\\"Where the pugilists drink\\", Times Online. Retrieved 28 April 2012.

A carrel desk is a small desk (usually) featuring high sides meant to visually isolate its user from any surroundings either partially or totally.  Description  Carrel desks are most often found in academic libraries. Most carrel desks are rectangular in shape. Above the main desktop area there is often a shelf for books. Sometimes the seat is integrated with the carrel desk. Unlike the cubicle desk, carrel desks usually have no file drawers or other facilities. Since the late 1990s, some carrel desk designs provide AC power and Ethernet receptacles for students using laptop computers. Like the school desk, the carrel desk is normally produced and sold in large quantities for an institutional market. They are made to stand alone or to be grouped together, with or without common sides or walls. The word carrel can also refer to a small isolated \\"study room\\" in public libraries and on university campuses; usually the room has a lockable door to which the user is granted the key on request. Carrels usually contain a desk (not necessarily one described as above), shelving and a lamp. Carrels are generally quite popular at universities and are therefore usually quickly occupied. This becomes especially true during mid-term examinations and finals. They have the advantage of power for a laptop (and often internet port) as well as generally being quieter than in the main library building. Carrels are also often used as temporary storage for books and materials the user is not finished with while they are at lectures or labs. Carrels originated in monasteries to help contain the cacophony of roomfuls of monks reading aloud, as was the early practice.Dom Le Clerq, Love of Learning and the Desire for God, trans.

It is bordered by the roads Brixton Water Lane, Norwood Road, Tulse Hill and Dulwich Road. The park commands views of the skyline of the city and Central London, and hosts almost 4 million annual visits. At the top of the hill within the park stands Brockwell Hall. Whilst competing against multiple demands from a broad range of other interests, the entirety of Brockwell Park is a Site of Importance for Nature Conservation (SINC) of Borough Importance (Grade I), with mature trees including ancient oaks, substantial lawn areas set to meadow, and a series of lakes. As well as adding to the landscape value, these support a variety of birds, and bats including Pipistrelles, with frequent visits from rarer species like Daubentons, Noctule, Leisler's and Serotine bat.http://www.brockwellgreenhouses.org.uk/event/bat-walk-night/ The Park is listed for its heritage value on The National Heritage List for England, Parks & Gardens, Grade II. Noted for its nineteenth-century layout as a gracious public park, the clocktower, water garden, JJ Sexby-designed walled garden and other monuments, the park provides a pleasant exploration with links to its eighteenth-century agricultural past in the hedge lines, and mature oak trees. The model village houses outside the walled garden were originally donated to London County Council by Edgar Wilson in 1943. The Brockwell Lido, a Grade II listed art deco building near the top of the park, is an open-air swimming pool popular with swimmers and bathers. Its attached caf√©/restaurant is also popular. Other amenities in Brockwell Park include tennis courts, a bowling green, a BMX track and a miniature railway. Brockwell Park is open from 7.30am to 15 minutes before sunset every day. History Brockwell Hall in 2012 The Grade II* listed Brockwell Hall was built between 1811-1813 when the area was part of Surrey and was the country seat of glass merchant John Blades Esq. The land and house were acquired by the London County Council (LCC) in March 1891 and opened to the public on 2 June in the following summer, led by the local MP Thomas Lynn Bristowe. At the unveiling, Bristowe died of a heart attack on the steps of the hall. In 1901, the LCC acquired a further of land north of the original park. In the 1920s, there were 13 cricket pitches in the park, which attracted crowds of up to 1,500. Brockwell Park was home to the Galton Institute. During World War I it is recorded that Brockwell Park grazed a large flock of sheep. During World War II, three sites in the Park were set aside for wartime food production in the form of 'Pig Clubs', built of timber and bricks salvaged from bombed houses. Pig swill for this purpose was collected from local homes. A bust of Thomas Bristowe was returned to the Park and unveiled on its 120th birthday, 2012. The park is Grade II listed on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. Festivals and Shows Lambeth Country Show 2015 Main Stage The Park is home to the free Lambeth Country Show, which usually takes place over two days in July, attracting crowds of up to 150,000 people. A ticketed annual fireworks display, attracting 30,000 people, also takes place around November 5. Paid-for music events have been taking place in Brockwell Park for a number of years, including Found Festival in 2016 and Sunfall Festival in 2017. As far back as 1913, it was said that, \\"On the whole probably the people in Brockwell Park, like those in Hyde Park and the other parks, would refuse the weaker Italian stuff and demand the Wagner over and over again\\". Whilst there is recent local opposition to the holding of large festivals, in fact the Park has a long history of hosting large-scale music events, including an estimated crowd of 150,000 in attendance at a Rock Against Racism carnival in September 1978, headlined by Elvis Costello and The Attractions, and with \\"people in trees, on the roofs of the flats and on the lido wall\\". Costello ended his Brockwell Park performance with the song '(What's So Funny 'Bout) Peace, Love, and Understanding'. A further Rock Against Racism event including performances by Aswad and Stiff Little Fingers was also held in the Park in September 1979. In May 1981, Aswad and Pete Townshend \\"swigging Remy Martin brandy\\" headlined a TUC benefit gig for the 'People's March For Jobs' campaign, with a crowd of 70,000 in attendance. In May 1982, Brockwell Park hosted a Cannabis Law Reform Rally, including \\"a wicked turbo sound rig with Jah Shaka, Coxone, King Sounds and DBC Rebel Radio¬¥s boxes all connected in a huge horseshoe\\". Madness also headlined a Greater London Council / CND 'Festival for Peace' in Brockwell Park in 1983, compered by John Peel, with a crowd of 30,000 in attendance. Paul Weller's new band The Style Council made only their second public appearance at this festival. Unfortunate scheduling of the support acts, meant that many arriving in Brockwell Park hoping to see The Damned had already missed their 35-minute set, and subsequent support acts, including The Style Council and Hazel O'Connor, were pelted with mud, amid chants of \\"We want The Damned\\". In August 1984, the Park hosted a GLC free festival, where Leader Ken Livingstone gave a speech, and the increasingly rowdy crowd during performances by The Fall and Spear of Destiny was calmed by poet Benjamin Zephaniah before the headline set by The Damned. One eyewitness recalls The Fall being pelted with cans during their performance, with singer Mark E. Smith narrowly dodging one effort, \\"about an inch from his face, when he suddenly twitched to the right and let it sail past him\\". The Park has also hosted reggae festivals, and the London Pride festival in 1993 and 1994. In May 1994, an Anti Nazi League Carnival in Brockwell Park featured performances by The Manic Street Preachers, The Levellers, and Billy Bragg. Between 2000-2004, the Park even hosted an annual cannabis festival. The cannabis festival was eventually stopped in 2005 by Lambeth Council, after drug dealing at previous events. In June 2002, Australian band Midnight Oil headlined The Fierce Festival in Brockwell Park in front of a crowd of 20,000 people. A dance event called Purple in the Park was held on the preceding day, headlined by Grace Jones, and including performances by Boy George and Yoko Ono. The two events, held over the Queen's Golden Jubilee weekend, had a capacity set at 50,000. In January 2018, Lambeth Council announced that Field Day Festival had been given permission to hold its event in Brockwell Park. Acts lined up for June 2018 included Erykah Badu, Thundercat, and Four Tet.

Denny Driving the first pile for the Seattle and Walla Walla Looking east from the C&PSRR; docks in Seattle, 1882 Railway curves along the shore south of Downtown Seattle, 1881 The Seattle and Walla Walla Railroad (earlier Seattle and Walla Walla Railroad and Transportation Company) was a narrow gauge railroad and was the first proper railroad to serve Seattle, Washington, preceded only by horse-drawn rail vehicles and by a coal train making the very short haul from Lake Union to Pike Street. Despite its ambitious name, actual construction never went beyond King County, the county of which Seattle itself is the seat. After being sold to Henry Villard's Oregon Improvement Company in 1880 it was renamed the Columbia and Puget Sound Railroad. In 1916, that became the Pacific Coast Railroad Company. History =Seattle and Walla Walla= When the Northern Pacific Railway chose nearby Tacoma as its western terminus (1873), many thought that this would condemn Seattle to, at best, a secondary role on Puget Sound. While most of the other towns that were passed over in favor of Tacoma simply accepted their fate, Seattle did not. Selucius Garfielde proposed a railway east through Snoqualmie Pass to the grainfields of Eastern Washington. The railroad was incorporated September 19, 1873. Its founding trustees were Arthur Denny, John Collins, Franklin Mathias, Angus Mackintosh, Henry Yesler, James McNaught, J. J. McGilvra, J. M. Colman, and Dexter Horton. They ventured to Walla Walla, where they were given a warm welcome, but lacked Seattle's concern for the project: they already had land transport to Portland, Oregon, not to mention access to the Columbia River. J. M. Colman, owner of the Seattle lumber mill founded by Henry Yesler, emerged as the leader of the enterprise. He staked US$20,000 of his own money‚Äîa fortune in those days, especially during the slow recovery from the Panic of 1873‚Äîon the condition that other Seattle businessmen would loan the enterprise at least twice that sum. Colman brought in labor contractor Chin Gee Hee, who organized cheap Chinese labor to continue the construction. (Chin would eventually become a railway entrepreneur in his native China.) Despite Walla Walla's lack of interest, construction began on May 1, 1874, at Steele's Landing in Georgetown, the present-day intersection of E. Marginal Way S. and S. Lucille St., which was then near the mouth of the Duwamish River, later re-channeled and straightened. Twelve miles of track had been completed by October of that year, entirely through volunteer labor by the men of Seattle. The line reached the coal fields of Renton in 1877, with the first train running on March 7 and regular commercial runs commencing October 15. The most difficult part of building the line was the trestle ran south from the King Street Coal Wharf, carrying trains through the tide flats that would later be filled to form Seattle's Industrial District. Joe Surber sunk numerous piles into the flats, using his pile driver. The resulting trestle was short-lived, though: shipworms attacked the pilings, and this portion of the line had to be replaced by the successor Columbia and Puget Sound Railroad less than five years after it was initially built. On January 18, 1878 the railroad made it as far as the coal fields of Newcastle,HistoryLink (2018), Seattle & Walla Walla Railroad reaches Newcastle on February 5, 1878.. Retrieved April 14, 2018. ultimately of railway with five locomotives, two passenger cars and sixty freight cars, but never attracted the capitalization that would take it anywhere near the city of Walla Walla from which it took half its name. Henry Villard's Oregon Improvement Company bought the Seattle and Walla Walla November 25, 1880 and renamed it the Columbia and Puget Sound Railroad. The sale was quite profitable for the line's owners, but did little to connect Seattle to the national land transportation grid. =Columbia and Puget Sound= The Columbia and Puget Sound Railroad Company (C&PSRR;), successor to the Seattle and Walla Walla, was incorporated November 26, 1880, the day after the purchase. Like its predecessor, the C&PSRR; continued to lay track in the coal-rich terrain of Western Washington, mainly extending lines south and east from Renton via Black Diamond to Franklin (December 1884), but also extending service a short distance from Newcastle to nearby Coal Creek in December 1881. Additional short lines out of Black Diamond would eventually go to Denny (renamed Bruce in 1897) and to Kummer; the latter opened no later than June 30, 1903); about halfway between Renton and Black Diamond, a line was extended from Maple Valley to Taylor (a company town owned by the Denny Clay Company) around May 1893. The C&SPRR; eventually had of track. The C&PSRR; gave Seattle at least a tenuous link to major railways to its south and east. At Maple Valley, it connected to a line owned by the Milwaukee Road, the Chicago, & Puget Sound Railway Company. Beginning July 1, 1884, a third rail on C&PSRR; track from Black River Junction north to Argo allowed the Northern Pacific to run their wide-gauge trains on C&PSRR;'s otherwise narrow-gauge track, and reach Seattle from the south with their Puget Sound Shore Railroad. The Puget Sound Shore Railroad was never really an adequate connection to the nation's railroad network. The line was built from the Black River Junction via Kent to Stuck Junction (about halfway between Sumner and Kent), leading in theory to the Northern Pacific's main terminal at Tacoma, but the Northern Pacific largely declined to operate the line. The name \\"Stuck Junction\\" became all too apt. \\"[S]ervice was unpredictable and sometimes absent altogether,\\" charges were high, and no break bulk cargo was allowed (an individual merchant had to ship and receive by the carload). This situation drove Seattle to look at the possibility of connecting north, leading to the creation of the Seattle, Lake Shore & Eastern. In 1909, the Milwaukee Road was extended similar trackage rights from the south to what had been granted to the Puget Sound Shore Railroad. By 1913, the C&PSRR; was operating 11 locomotives, 8 passenger cars, 152 freight cars, and 236 coal cars. The C&PSRR; was consolidated into the Pacific Coast Railroad Company on March 26, 1916. =Pacific Coast Railroad Company= The Pacific Coast Railroad Company was incorporated November 27, 1897, but did not operate until March 23, 1916. The line from Renton to Newcastle and Coal Creek was closed in 1933. The last of the extensions out of Black Diamond, to Franklin, was closed in 1936. In 1945 the line from Maple Valley to Taylor was closed, and in 1947 the stretch between Maple Valley and Henry's shut as well, leaving only the lines from Seattle via Black River Junction and Renton to Maple Valley, and from Henry's to Black Diamond, a total of about of track. By 1951, the Pacific Coast Railroad was a subsidiary of the Great Northern. It was sold to Burlington Northern (now part of the BNSF Railway) March 2, 1970.

The historical accomplishment of the line was Seattle to Sumas at the border, with British Columbia, Canada, connecting with the Canadian Pacific transcontinental at the border at Huntingdon, British Columbia, now part of the City of Abbotsford. In addition to the historical accomplishment, the SLS&E; built and ran branches from Seattle through Bothell, on to Woodinville, to Sallal Prairie (just past North Bend); Salmon Bay (the industrial district of the town of Ballard); and Spokane to Davenport.Pleasants This is a tertiary source, so secondary source , per Wikipedia:Cite sources. Toward the latter end, one goal was creating a rail connection to North Dakota via Wallula, an outpost on the Columbia River in the early decades of railroad booms, near the present Tri-Cities. Local historian William Speidel reported that Henry Villard, tycoon of the Northern Pacific Railway (NP), had the federal rights and had the line through Wallula built.Speidel, p. 190. The SLS&E; was first incorporated to build a line from the Seattle harbor in old Downtown, along Elliott Bay to the lumber and fishing town of Ballard.

Like communications networks today, 19th century railroading represented more than track, stock, and trade. Romantic and practical potential wooed communities across the West, much as Web commerce and bandwidth today (bandwidth was narrow, desire high, competition passionate). Travel between America's coasts had taken months, whether overland by wagon or by sailing ship or steamer around Cape Horn, until the Union Pacific reached San Francisco in 1869 and the Northern Pacific opened to Tacoma in 1887.MacIntosh, & Crowley The SLS&E; was conceived and financed by Seattle business interests in response to Villard of the NP selecting Seattle's intense rival Tacoma as its transcontinental western terminus, and incorporated on 15 April 1885. The original scheme for the SLS&E; was connecting with an intercontinental railroad somewhere, while actually building north and east from Seattle.Speidel, p. 196. By the late 1880s, the SLS&E; needed more capital for ongoing construction toward Sumas and an extension toward Spokane. The Seattle & Eastern Construction Company was formed with many of the same investors as the SLS&E.; Construction of the eastern line began in Spokane.MacIntosh By the end of 1889, construction ended, having only reached Sallal Prairie,Sallal Prairie (note the spelling is not as the native salal plant) is sometimes confused with Rattlesnake Prairie, which is a little further south around Rattlesnake Mountain. Further, Snoqualmie Falls is some northwest of North Bend. Both Sallal Prairie and Rattlesnake Prairie are today forgotten ghosts. some miles past North Bend and from the Seattle stationMartin on Western Avenue at Columbia Street.Speidel, p. 202.

McDonald, president of the SLS&E.; Edwin Harrison McHenry, Receiver, St. Paul, Minnesota, to Edward Dean Adams, Chairman, New York City, April 10, 1896. (Courtesy J.R. Masters, Office Engineer, N.P. Ry., Ret., via Northern Pacific Collection at the Minnesota Historical Society.) Transmitting report of [John William] Kendrick, General Manager, concerning the Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway (the Lake Shore). You are already familiar with the general subject of the earlier financial transactions of this company. The record is a disgraceful one. Even before the acquisition of stock by the Northern Pacific, the enterprise appears to have been robbed by its promoters. It was originally intended to complete the line across the Cascade Mountains to a connection with the Spokane Branch, but the amount realized from the sale of bonds being insufficient to defray the expensive construction work of the mountain section the line was not completed The cost of the portion constructed was considerably above the expected amount, and in order to raise more money, the company bonded a number of spurs and sidings. Under ordinary circumstances it would have been expected that after the consummation of the sale of stock to the Northern Pacific, that the road would have been operated in the interests of the purchaser, but control was not secured until the Northern Pacific had paid for 80 [percent] of the stock, and in the interval the officials and others interest in the Lake Shore apparently devoted their time and attention to looting the property. The sale to our company was rushed through in a very peculiar manner, and without proper examination by the Traffic and Engineering departments of the Northern Pacific. The specifications for the construction of the uncompleted portion of the line were accepted by our ex-General Counsel Mr. McNaught, and our Chief Engineer Mr. Kendrick was not allowed an opportunity to examine and comment on same. The specifications were so drawn as to comply with the kind of road which it was expected to build, and allowed but two miles of sidings in of main line, and made entirely inadequate provision for operating facilities. The worst feature, however, was the clause which provided that the track would be ballasted with adjacent material, instead of train-hauled gravel ballast. The soil is particularly wet, and a large portion of the line traverses muskeg swamps; this omission would be better understood by a physical examination of the line than words can convey. The natural surface was so bad that the construction company [was] forced to haul in ballast in order to get construction trains over the track. After the Northern Pacific assumed control, it became necessary to incur great expenditures in providing additional sidings, spurs and other facilities for the ordinary transaction of business, and to perform additional ballasting. The townsites along the line are held by the Virginia Townsite Company, under some deal engineer by the ex-general counsel, who subsequently unloaded same to the Northern Pacific. So valuable was the real estate supposed to be, that no extra width of right-of-way was provided at stations north of Sedro- Woolley, Washington. A contract was also entered into for the benefit of the townsite interest at Anacortes, whereby the Northern Pacific agreed to operate the Seattle and Northern [a subsidiary of] the Oregon Improvement Company, paying [three percent] upon the appraised valuation, and a wheelage portion of expenses, in addition to a further sum of $80,000, expended in purchasing and interest in Syndicate Addition, and in the construction of improvements costing $35,000, entirely disconnected with the property of the Northern Pacific or the Lake Shore. The operation was shortly discontinued by the general manager on account of the heavy loss incurred, but the rental charges still continue to this day. Valuable real estate at Seattle and at Snoqualmie Falls, which was formerly supposed to be property of the railroad, was claimed by private parties, and ownership of the Gilman coal mines at Issaquah, Washington, which were currently reported to have been paid for by the railroad, are in possession of outside interests. Before the purchase by the Northern Pacific of the stock, the Lake Shore, finding it impossible to provide adequate terminal facilities at Spokane from the proceeds of [their] main line bonds, organized a company under the title of the Spokane Union Depot Company, to which the Washington and Idaho Railroad (a branch of the Union Pacific System), were admitted to half ownership. Bonds were issued amounting to a little over $400,000. The stock issue of $500,000 was divided equally between the two companies. The Lake Shore was reimbursed for the work on that portion of their main line within the limits of the depot grounds from the proceeds of the depot bonds, but to the best of my knowledge and belief, the railway bonds were never cancelled. This property I have nominally estimated at $600,000 ... but its real value is probably at least $1,000,000. It is used by the Oregon Railway and Navigation [Union Pacific] and the Great Northern systems, and these companies would have to expend at least $1,000,000 to provide equivalent facilities of less actual value. I have made repeated efforts for several years past to have this matter investigated, but owing to the circumstances have thus far been unsuccessful. If this depot stock does not come under the line of the Lake Shore bonds, it could doubtless be attached to satisfy some claims of the Northern Pacific against the Lake Shore. The Spokane Branch is of little value, apart from the rails, which may be taken up and used elsewhere, with the exception of about two miles of line connecting with the Union Depot property, over which the Great Northern Railway now secures an entrance into Spokane from the west, and for the use of which they pay the heavy annual rental of $72,000. On the Western Division, that portion of the line from Woodinville Junction to the terminus [at] Sallal near North Bend, Washington, is of little present value, but its earnings power will constantly increase. The remainder, which includes the section between Seattle and Woodinville Junction, and [Woodinville Junction] and the International boundary line at Sumas, Washington, I consider as very valuable property. Its present earnings afford no index to its prospective earnings in the future, and if it is not secured by our company at this time, the omission will be bitterly regretted. The development of the region is necessarily slow, but I think it is also certain. There is every reason for expecting a steady and progressive increase in earnings for an indefinite period in the future. I am not in entire accord with the general manager's statement that the business secured from this branch may be replaced from points on our own lines. Contrary to the belief, the supplies of cedar in western Washington are comparatively limited, and the greatest reserves of this timber are along the line of the Lake Shore. I think it but a matter of a few years when the cedar will be exhausted on our other lines. There is also reason to believe that the rate on shingles can be materially advanced without affecting the tonnage, as the present low price of the shingles is brought about wholly by local competition. It was not possible, however, to obtain a higher rate, except by concurrence of the Great Northern, which could not heretofore be obtained, on account of James Jerome Hill persistent effort to reduce the gross and net earnings of our system in order to facilitate his plans. I understand the reorganization of the Lake Shore has been affected upon favorable terms, but have never had an opportunity to see the plan. I would every strongly recommend the purchase or least of the western divisions of the system, if favorable terms may be obtained. I would also advise the purchase of the Spokane Branch, if the property could be acquired upon satisfactory terms, which in my opinion would be based upon the value of that portion of the line within the city limits over which the Great Northern now gains access, including any liens the bonds may constitute upon the depot property, and the salvage value of the rails upon the remaining portion of the branch. I further add, for your information, that I do not think the bondholders of the Lake Shore appreciate the fact that the bonds covering that portion of the line sold to the [Spokane Union] Depot Company were not cancelled, but I may be in error regarding this. > McNaught, James.

The date is reported 1 July 1896, but the cited source is a \\"JUNE 1893 RAILWAY GUIDE Seattle, Washington\\". Seattle & International Railway chartered 30 June 1898. The SLS&E; was placed in receivership on June 26, 1893, and was sold in foreclosure on May 16, 1896., also to distinguish from following Speidel reported that Villard abruptly made a hostile takeover while the SLS&E; was a going concern in 1890, in the midst of maneuvering among railroad business magnate Henry Villard of the Northern Pacific, James J. Hill of what became the Great Northern Railway, and the Seattle Establishment (1873‚Äì1900 and later).Speidel, pp. 154, 166, 205. Seattle DOT (Department of Transportation) reports the SLS&E; was absorbed by the NP in 1892. Though source page provides no references. The lines in western Washington became the Seattle & International Railway Co., which was taken over by the Northern Pacific in 1901. Building the SLS&E; in Eastern Washington The SLS&E; was planned to be a larger railroad than it ultimately became. Construction was in two parts, with the eastern Washington section started in Spokane and headed west, begun in the late 1880s by largely the same group of investors incorporating the Seattle & Eastern Construction Company.(1) MacIntosh (2) Speidel An old map shows the proposed line going from Davenport to Coulee City, up the Grand Coulee to Waterville, then on to Wenatchee, then along the Wenatchee River, and up over part of Stevens Pass then over toward Everett.(1) 1889 Washington Map, Ruffner With what is known today about Cascade Range topography that was little-known or unknown back then, how much was promotion and how much was actually expected according to the insiders' business plan remains part of the intrigue of railroad history. The steam locomotive \\"A. M.

It has been reported that the Great Northern (GN) used the SLS&E; bridge over the Spokane River while the GN was building its own during its transcontinental construction in 1893.Correspondence with retired Burlington Northern executive Robert Downing, of Spokane, WA. The eastern Washington line became the Spokane & Seattle Railway, which was purchased by the NP in two parts. The first--Medical Lake to Davenport--was purchased in 1899. The remainder, between Medical Lake and Spokane, was bought in 1900.(1) Renz p. 197 Recent history The western Washington lines remained in fairly heavy use until 1963. By 1970, most of the line was acquired by Burlington Northern Railway which filed to abandon the lines a year later in 1971. Seven years later, in 1978, the between Gas Works Park in Seattle and Tracy Owen Station in Kenmore was reopened as the Burke- Gilman Trail bike path and recreational rail trail, named after the leaders of the group that founded the railroad, Thomas Burke and Daniel Gilman. The bike path and rail trail has been extended along the SLS&E; line west through Ballard, and extending east from Jerry Wilmot Park, South Woodinville, the King County Regional Trail system leads to the cross-state John Wayne Pioneer Trail. A section of the railway, between Snoqualmie Falls and North Bend, was preserved in 1975, and is now owned and operated by the Northwest Railway Museum. in \\"Museum Description\\". See Bibliography for \\"References\\" cited in \\"Collection\\". In eastern Washington, the Northern Pacific abandoned the section between Spokane and Medical Lake right after purchase, preferring to use their own branch from Spokane, the Central Washington Branch (CW Branch). The section from Medical Lake to Davenport was operated for a time before the line was trimmed back to include only an spur out of Davenport to Eleanor. The Washington Water Power Company purchased the right-of-way between Spokane and Medical Lake from the Northern Pacific on or about 2 March 1904, for use as an interurban passenger railway. It remained in use as an interurban until early 1922, before the rails were torn up again. The only remaining eastern Washington section by 1970 was the spur out of Davenport that ran to Eleanor, abandoned in 1983.Mutschler, Parent, & Siegert As of May 2019 the only remaining section is the Wye going south of Davenport, it is now used to turn locomotives around and storage for the Washington Eastern RailroadOperations Manager of Washington Eastern Railroad. The right-of-way has long since reverted to adjacent landowners and has been used for other purposes, having been abandoned 1922-1983. If these lines had been operated in a more urban setting, and in more recent times, they might have been converted to use today as a trail. But at the time this line was abandoned, the rails to trails movement had not begun. By today much of the lines in the open country of Eastern Washington have gone the way of the \\"disappearing railroad blues.\\"Steve Goodman Some sections can still be seen if you know where to look but otherwise much of it has become roadways or disappeared into history.

The state park is the site of North America's highest single-structured sand dune which is approximately high. The park encompasses and features the Bruneau Dunes Observatory, where visitors can use a telescope for stargazing. Natural history ;Geology The park's dunes are unique in the Western Hemisphere: where others in the Americas form at the edge of a natural basin, the Bruneau dunes form near the center. The basin has acted as a natural trap for over 12,000 years. The dunes may have started with sands from the Bonneville Flood about 15,000 years ago. With prevailing winds blowing from the southeast 28 percent of the time and from the northwest 32 percent of the time, the dunes stay fairly stable, and unlike most dunes, do not drift far. ;Flora and fauna The state park includes desert, dune, prairie, lake and marsh habitat. Desert wildlife is prominent along with birds of prey and waterfowl. Park history Land for the park was purchased under the Recreation and Public Purposes Act in May 1967. Additional acreage was acquired in 1980 and in 1984, bringing the park's total area to . Recreation Activities include sandboarding, fishing, birdwatching, camping, hiking, swimming and viewing the stars at the public observatory. No motorized vehicles are allowed on the dunes but climbing and sledding are permitted. There are 7-mile and 9-mile horseback riding trails around the dunes. An educational center offers natural history displays and a gift shop. The astronomical observatory is open Friday and Saturday evenings mid-March through mid-October. Two cabins, 82 RV sites (with water/electricity) and 32 standard sites are available year round in two campgrounds: Eagle Cove Campground and Broken Wheel Campground. An equestrian overnight facility, with corrals, is also available. Fishing for bass and bluegill is popular in the park's small lake. Only non-motorized canoes, rafts and float tubes are allowed.

History  While it was part of the socialist Yugoslavia, the Socialist Republic of Croatia had its own Constitution under the Constitution of Yugoslavia. Following the first multi-party parliamentary elections held in April 1990, the Parliament made various constitutional changes. On December 22, 1990, they rejected the communist one-party system and adopted a liberal-democratic Constitution of Croatia as the Republic of Croatia. The document is sometimes known as the Christmas Constitution (). The Constitution was amended in early 1998. The Constitution of 1990 used the semi-presidential model of the French Fifth Republic, with broad Presidential executive powers shared with the Government. In 2000, and again in 2001, the Croatian Parliament amended the Constitution changing bicameral parliament back into historic unicameral and reducing the Presidential powers. The Constitution was most recently amended in 2013. This constitutional amendment defines marriage within Croatia as a union between a man and a woman. Effective 1 January 2014.  Contents  = Historical foundations = This is the preamble of the Constitution.

The people exercises this power through the election of representatives and through direct decision-making. Article 3 states that freedom, equal rights, national equality and equality of genders, love of peace, social justice, respect for human rights, inviolability of ownership, conservation of nature and the environment, the rule of law, and a democratic multiparty system are the highest values of the constitutional order of the Republic of Croatia and the ground for interpretation of the Constitution. Article 4 states that the government shall be organized on the principle of separation of powers into the legislative, executive and judicial branches, but limited by the right to local and regional self-government guaranteed by this Constitution. Article 12 states that the official language is Croatian in the Latin script and that in some areas, together with the Croatian language and Latin script, other languages, such as Cyrillic or any other legal language can be used.41 7.5.2001 Ustav Republike Hrvatske (proƒçi≈°ƒáeni tekst) = Protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms = This chapter deals with general human rights, Personal and Political Freedoms and Rights and Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. All are equal before the law regardless of race, color, gender, language, religion, political or other belief, national or social origin, property, birth, education, social status or other characteristics. Article 21 states that every human being has the inalienable right to live, thus there is no capital punishment in the Republic of Croatia. Entrepreneurial and market freedom is the basis of the economic system. In this chapter Croatian National Bank is defined as central bank which is independent in its work of monetary policy making and responsible to the Croatian Parliament. = Organization of Government = The Croatian parliament is defined as a representative body of the people and is vested with the legislative power. The most important function of the parliament is to make laws and to amend the Constitution. The People's Ombudsman, as a commissioner of the Croatian Parliament, shall protect the constitutional and legal rights of citizens in proceedings before the state administration and bodies vested with public authority. He is elected by the parliament for a term of 8 years. The President of the Republic of Croatia shall represent and stand for the Republic of Croatia at home and abroad. He shall take care of regular and harmonized functioning and stability of the state government and is responsible for the defense of independence and territorial integrity. He is elected directly by the people for a term of 5 years and is limited on 2 mandates maximum. The most important task of the President is to be Commander- in-Chief of the armed forces and to be leader during the state of war when he can issue decrees with the force of law. He is impeachable for any violation of the Constitution. Croatian parliament decides whether to proceed impeaching the President and that is decided by the Constitutional Court. The Government of the Republic of Croatia exercise executive power. The Government consists of Prime Minister, one or more Deputy Prime Minister and ministers. President of the republic confides the mandate to form the Government to the person who, upon the distribution of the seats in the Croatian Parliament and consultations held, enjoys confidence of the majority of its members. The Government shall assume its duty if the vote of confidence is passed by a majority vote of all members of the Croatian Parliament. The main function of the Government is to propose legislation, to execute laws, guide the foreign and internal policies, direct the state administration and take care of economic development. The Government is responsible to the Croatian parliament and parliament can vote of no confidence when Government resigns. Judicial power is exercised by independent and autonomous courts. Supreme Court is highest court and secures uniform application of laws and equal justice to all. The president of the Supreme Court is proposed by the President of the Republic and elected by the Croatian Parliament for a term of 4 years. Judicial office is permanent. Judges are elected by the National Judicial Council. The National Judicial Council consists of 11 members elected by the Croatian Parliament from among notable judges, attorneys-at-law and university professors of law. The majority of members of the National Judicial Council shall be from the ranks of judges. The Office of the Public Prosecutions is an autonomous and independent judicial body empowered and due to proceed against those who commit criminal and other punishable offences, to undertake legal measures for protection of the property of the Republic of Croatia and to provide legal remedies for protection of the Constitution and law. The Head Public Prosecutor of the Republic of Croatia shall be appointed by the Croatian Parliament at the proposal of the Government for a term of 4 years. = The Constitutional Court of the Republic of Croatia = The Constitutional Court is not part of judicial system but the court sui generis. It consists of 13 judges elected by the Croatian parliament for a term of 8 years from among notable jurists, especially judges, public prosecutors, lawyers and university professors of law. The main function of the Court is to decide on the conformity of laws and other regulation with the Constitution, to decide on jurisdictional disputes between the legislative, executive and judicial branches, to decide on the impeachment of the president of the republic, to supervise and ban political parties and to supervise the constitutionality and legality of elections and national referendums. The Constitutional Court of the Republic of Croatia shall repeal a law if it finds it to be unconstitutional. When reviewing the legislation, the court often relies on the so-called Croatian constitutional identity and on the Croatian national identity. = Local and regional self-government = Municipalities and towns are units of local self-government which carries out the affairs of local jurisdiction by which the needs of citizens are directly fulfilled, and in particular the affairs related to the organization of localities and housing, area and urban planning, public utilities, child care, social welfare, primary health services, education and elementary schools, culture, physical education and sports, customer protection, protection and improvement of the environment, fire protection and civil defense. Counties are units of regional self-government which carries out the affairs of regional significance, and in particular the affairs related to education, health service, area and urban planning, economic development, traffic and traffic infrastructure and the development of network of educational, health, social and cultural institutions. The capital city of Zagreb may be attributed the status of a county by law. = International relations = International agreements are concluded depending on the nature and contents of the international agreement, within the authority of the Croatian Parliament, the President of the Republic and the Government of the Republic of Croatia. International agreements which entail the passage of amendment of laws, international agreements of military and political nature, and international agreements which financially commit the Republic of Croatia shall be subject to ratification by the Croatian Parliament. International agreements concluded and ratified in accordance with the Constitution and made public, and which are in force, shall be part of the internal legal order of the Republic of Croatia and shall be above law in terms of legal effects. Procedure for the association of the Republic of Croatia into alliances with other states may be instituted by at least one- third of the representatives of the Croatian Parliament, the President of the Republic and the Government of the Republic of the Croatia. It is prohibited to initiate any procedure for the association of the Republic of Croatia into alliances with other states if such association leads, or might lead, to a renewal of a South Slav state community or to any Balkan state form of any kind. Any association of the Republic of Croatia shall first be decided upon by the Croatian Parliament by a two-thirds majority vote of all representatives. Any decision concerning the association of the Republic of Croatia shall be made on a referendum by a majority vote of the total number of electors in the State. The provisions of this Article concerning association shall also relate to the conditions and procedure for the disassociation of the Republic of Croatia. = Amending the Constitution = Amendments to the Constitution of the Republic of Croatia may be proposed by at least one- fifth of the members of the Croatian Parliament, the President of the Republic, the Government of the Republic of Croatia and by popular initiative, if valid signatures of 10% of the total number of voters are collected. The decision to amend the Constitution shall be made by a two- thirds majority vote of all the members of the Croatian Parliament. In the case of popular initiative, a referendum is called and the Constitution can be amended even without majority vote in the Parliament.

Dinghy racing has affected aspects of the modern sailing dinghy, including hull design, sail materials and sailplan, and techniques such as planing and trapezing. Newport Harbor High School sailing team Organization of competitive dinghy sailing Dinghy racing comes under the auspices of the International Sailing Federation. Organisations such as the Royal Yachting Association, National School Sailing Association (UK) and Canadian Yachting Association (Canada) organise and regulate the sport at a national level. Sailing dinghies compete on an international, national, state, association, club and class basis, using the ISAF International Racing Rules of Sailing, which are revised every four years. There are several courses used, such as the Olympic triangle. The International Association for Disabled Sailing (IFDS)] is the body authorized by ISAF to be responsible for disabled sailing worldwide. IFDS works with yachting associations worldwide to run regional events all the way to the Paralympic Games, as well as adapt ISAF Racing Rules of Sailing to meet disability requirements. Many standard boats are suitable for people with disabilities which can be made more accessible by adaptations. More boats are being designed with disabled people in mind and used regularly around the world by people with disabilities. =Race Course= Dinghys typically race around a windward-leeward race course. There is a start/finish \\"line\\", set up perpendicular to the wind, marked by a committee boat at one end, and a buoy on the other. At the end of five minutes, competitors are allowed to cross the line and begin to race to the next mark. The next mark is called the windward mark. The windward mark is placed directly upwind from the start/finish line. Competitors must round the mark going counter-clockwise. After rounding the windward mark, the fleet now heads towards the leeward mark. The leeward mark is positioned directly downwind from the windward mark, below the start/finish line. Sailors also round this mark counter-clockwise. After rounding, competitors head upwind to cross the finish line. =Bermuda Fitted Dinghy racing= In Bermuda, the Bermuda rig, now almost universal on small sailing vessels, can still be seen in its purest form in the Bermuda Fitted Dinghy, used for a series of races contested each year by the colony's yacht clubs. The first race of this type was held in 1880, as a way of reducing the costs then experienced racing larger Bermudian sloops, with their similarly-larger professional crews. BFD racing was restricted to amateurs, although each dinghy carries a crew of six. =Single-handed or more than one crew= Most racing dinghies can be classified as being either single-handed (one person only) such as the Laser, RS Vareo or double-handed, such as the 470, 505, Heron, Tasar, Flying Junior, International Fireball or the International Fourteen. A few classes of dinghy carry more than two crew whilst racing, typically heavier dayboat types, but also a couple of high- performance, Australian-origin skiff-type dinghies. Some classes allow children to sail double-handed until a particular age and then require them to compete single-handed. Some double-handed boats are ideal for an adult and child like the Heron, while some such as the Tasar have weight restrictions which ensure they are sailed competitively by two adults or near-adults. Weight equalisation is also used on certain high-performance classes to ensure that comparative levels of performance are attained. =One-design, or development class= Sailing dinghies can be one-design, with virtually no difference between boats and strict rules controlling construction; or development classes where there is wide leeway to experiment with the latest technology. One-design classes allows the competition to be more about sailing ability than about who can afford the newest innovation, although the weight of the boat, and sail age and quality, may also be differentiating factors, even in one-design classes. The oldest known one-design sailing dinghy is the Water Wag. Thomas Middleton proposed the idea of one design sailing punts, with centreboards all built and rigged the same in 1887. The first race took place on April 12, 1887, in Kingstown (now D√∫n Laoghaire) Harbour. The Water Wag Club still race Water Wag dinghies in D√∫n Laoghaire every Wednesday during the summer season. One designs may be strictly controlled, as in the ubiquitous Laser, with all boats being factory produced from identical moulds, with identical rigs and sails. Strict-one designs suffer from being very crew weight specific. International Flying Dutchman by \\"MADER\\" of Germany Other one-design classes such as the Europe and Flying Dutchman (1960 to 1992) allow differences in hull dimensions within certain tight tolerances. Despite these tolerances only being intended to allow some leeway for boats built by different builders, this usually results in certain builders boats being perceived as faster due to the way they make use of the tolerances to create a subtly different hull shape. This type of one-design generally allows more freedom in choice of masts, sails and deck layouts. Restricted classes like the National 12 and Merlin Rocket were previously referred to as one-designs, with tightly controlled rules which keep the boats closely competitive, but allow the owner to customize the boat to their preferences and weight. Full development classes such as the International Moth and International C class catamaran represent the cutting edge of the sport, with fleets being very diverse and often using the latest ideas and technology, including hydrofoils and solid wings in place of sails. =Olympic dinghy sailing= Current Olympic sailing includes several dinghy classes for both men and women, the Laser (men), Finn (men), 470 (men and women), Laser Radial (women), and Nacra 17 catamaran (mixed). Added for the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games, was the 49er skiff (men.) Most recently the IOC has added a Women's high performance planing dingy, the 49erFX skiff. The 49erFX is n identical hull to the men's 49er with a slightly reduced rig and sail area to accommodate lighter women's crews. =In scholastic sport= Many secondary schools and universities worldwide have adopted dinghy racing as either a club or varsity sport. In the United States secondary school sailing is governed by the Interscholastic Sailing Association. College sailing in the United States is governed by the Intercollegiate Sailing Association. Both organizations have been in continuous existence since the early 20th century and, indeed, college racing began in 1928. College sailing in Canada is now governed by the Canadian Intercollegiate Sailing Association, founded in 2010. In the United Kingdom secondary school sailing is governed by the National School Sailing Association. They not only organize 6 large events each year but support teachers by using sailing as a way of making education interesting and fun. They also offer schools, sailing clubs and youth clubs support on navigating the legal obligations surrounding involving youngsters in adventurous activities. They will be celebrating 50 years existence in 2012. Most school programs own fleets of at least 6 dinghies, and the well funded programs often have more than 20 dinghies in addition to support boats and paid coaches. Often schools cooperate with local yacht clubs to share fleets. The schools compete in both the fall and spring within regional districts and then, if they qualify through district championships, at a national championship regatta. Additionally, schools also compete in team racing regattas where they are able to compete one-on-one against other schools. Many clubs also sponsor junior programs for younger sailors. Junior sailors generally compete in club races and, if eligible, can compete in national events like those sponsored by US Sailing and internationally. =Handicap events - an attempt to even the playing field between different boat speeds= Races involving mixed fleets (different classes of boat, different ages, weights and abilities of sailors) can be organised on a handicap basis. The most commonly used handicapping system is the Portsmouth yardstick, which assigns a different rating to each class of boat in a mixed fleet and (at least in theory) gives every boat an equal chance of winning. Handicaps can also be personal (sometimes called a back-calculated yardstick), taking into account the results of the sailor over past races, so an inexperienced person who sails significantly better than previously over a season or regatta can win on handicap. There are unfortunately certain classes of boats which do better or worse because of their particular handicap, and as boats are modified the handicap system are often slow to catch up. However, for the purposes of large fleet racing with many different classes, the handicap systems seem to work quite well. =Class, association, club= Clubs generally have a number of different classes competing on any one day, often sailing the same course at the same time, or sometimes with each class starting a few minutes apart. Keen club sailors join and compete in events with their State and National Associations. Associations generally cater for only one class of boat, but generally have competitors in several divisions. =Competitive areas= The UK has one of the most diverse dinghy racing scenes in the world with over 100 different classes of dinghy and strongly supported clubs both inland and around the coast. Other competitive areas include the Eastern seaboard of the United States and Southern California. In these areas the junior programs are well funded and provide excellent training experience. The most popular boats are Naples Sabots, the Flying Junior, the Laser, 420s and 29ers. Europe has a very active circuit in many classes. Asia, Australia and South America are all large contenders at international events, Examples # Class: 470: http://www.470.org # Class: Laser: http://www.laser.org # Class: GP14: http://www.gp14.org # Discussion: The Laser Forum: http://www.laserforum.org # Discussion: The Sunfish Forum: http://www.sunfishforum.com # Class: Lark: http://www.larkclass.org # Class: 505: http://www.int505.org # Club: Concord & Ryde Sailing Club: http://www.concordrydesailing.org.au # Association: NSW Heron Association: https://web.archive.org/web/20060219183812/http://herons.dinghies.org/ # Puddle Duck Racer: http://www.pdracer.com Motor-driven dinghy racing Motor-driven dinghy races include the Dinghy Derby in Australia, using aluminium boats that are variants of the Stacer 319 Proline type.

Edit distances find applications in natural language processing, where automatic spelling correction can determine candidate corrections for a misspelled word by selecting words from a dictionary that have a low distance to the word in question. In bioinformatics, it can be used to quantify the similarity of DNA sequences, which can be viewed as strings of the letters A, C, G and T. Different definitions of an edit distance use different sets of string operations. Levenshtein distance operations are the removal, insertion, or substitution of a character in the string. Being the most common metric, the term Levenshtein distance is often used interchangeably with edit distance.  Types of edit distance  Different types of edit distance allow different sets of string operations. For instance: * The Levenshtein distance allows deletion, insertion and substitution. * The Longest common subsequence (LCS) distance allows only insertion and deletion, not substitution. * The Hamming distance allows only substitution, hence, it only applies to strings of the same length. * The Damerau‚ÄìLevenshtein distance allows insertion, deletion, substitution, and the transposition of two adjacent characters. * The Jaro distance allows only transposition. Some edit distance are defined as a parameterizable metric calculated with a specific set of allowed edit operations, and each operation is assigned a cost (possibly infinite). This is further generalized by DNA sequence alignment algorithms such as the Smith‚ÄìWaterman algorithm, which make an operation's cost depend on where it is applied. Formal definition and properties Given two strings and on an alphabet (e.g. the set of ASCII characters, the set of bytes [0..255], etc.), the edit distance is the minimum-weight series of edit operations that transforms into . One of the simplest sets of edit operations is that defined by Levenshtein in 1966: :Insertion of a single symbol. If = , then inserting the symbol produces . This can also be denoted Œµ‚Üí, using Œµ to denote the empty string. :Deletion of a single symbol changes to (‚ÜíŒµ). :Substitution of a single symbol for a symbol ‚â† changes to (‚Üí). In Levenshtein's original definition, each of these operations has unit cost (except that substitution of a character by itself has zero cost), so the Levenshtein distance is equal to the minimum number of operations required to transform to . A more general definition associates non-negative weight functions ins(), del() and sub(, ) with the operations. Additional primitive operations have been suggested. Damerau‚ÄìLevenshtein distance counts as a single edit a common mistake: transposition of two adjacent characters, formally characterized by an operation that changes into . For the task of correcting OCR output, merge and split operations have been used which replace a single character into a pair of them or vice versa. Other variants of edit distance are obtained by restricting the set of operations. Longest common subsequence (LCS) distance is edit distance with insertion and deletion as the only two edit operations, both at unit cost. Similarly, by only allowing substitutions (again at unit cost), Hamming distance is obtained; this must be restricted to equal-length strings. Jaro‚ÄìWinkler distance can be obtained from an edit distance where only transpositions are allowed. =Example= The Levenshtein distance between \\"kitten\\" and \\"sitting\\" is 3. A minimal edit script that transforms the former into the latter is: # kitten ‚Üí sitten (substitute \\"s\\" for \\"k\\") # sitten ‚Üí sittin (substitute \\"i\\" for \\"e\\") # sittin ‚Üí sitting (insert \\"g\\" at the end) LCS distance (insertions and deletions only) gives a different distance and minimal edit script: # kitten ‚Üí itten (delete \\"k\\" at 0) # itten ‚Üí sitten (insert \\"s\\" at 0) # sitten ‚Üí sittn (delete \\"e\\" at 4) # sittn ‚Üí sittin (insert \\"i\\" at 4) # sittin ‚Üí sitting (insert \\"g\\" at 6) for a total cost/distance of 5 operations. =Properties= Edit distance with non-negative cost satisfies the axioms of a metric, giving rise to a metric space of strings, when the following conditions are met: * Every edit operation has positive cost; * for every operation, there is an inverse operation with equal cost. With these properties, the metric axioms are satisfied as follows: :(, ) = 0 if and only if a=b, since each string can be trivially transformed to itself using exactly zero operations. :(, ) > 0 when ‚â† , since this would require at least one operation at non-zero cost. :(, ) = (, ) by equality of the cost of each operation and its inverse. :Triangle inequality: (, ) ‚â§ (, ) + (, ). Levenshtein distance and LCS distance with unit cost satisfy the above conditions, and therefore the metric axioms. Variants of edit distance that are not proper metrics have also been considered in the literature. Other useful properties of unit-cost edit distances include: * LCS distance is bounded above by the sum of lengths of a pair of strings. * LCS distance is an upper bound on Levenshtein distance. * For strings of the same length, Hamming distance is an upper bound on Levenshtein distance. Regardless of cost/weights, the following property holds of all edit distances: * When and share a common prefix, this prefix has no effect on the distance. Formally, when = and = , then (, ) = (, ). This allows speeding up many computations involving edit distance and edit scripts, since common prefixes and suffixes can be skipped in linear time. Computation The first algorithm for computing minimum edit distance between a pair of strings was published by Damerau in 1964. =Common algorithm= Using Levenshtein's original operations, the (nonsymmetric) edit distance from a = a_1\\\\ldots a_n to b = b_1\\\\ldots b_m is given by d_{nm}, defined by the recurrence :\\\\begin{align}d_{i0} &= \\\\sum_{k=1}^{i} w_\\\\mathrm{del}(a_{k}), & & \\\\quad \\\\text{for}\\\\; 1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq m \\\\\\\\\\\\ d_{0j} &= \\\\sum_{k=1}^{j} w_\\\\mathrm{ins}(b_{k}), & & \\\\quad \\\\text{for}\\\\; 1 \\\\leq j \\\\leq n \\\\\\\\\\\\ d_{ij} &= \\\\begin{cases} d_{i-1, j-1} & \\\\text{for}\\\\; a_{i} = b_{j}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\min \\\\begin{cases} d_{i-1, j} + w_\\\\mathrm{del}(a_{i})\\\\\\\\\\\\ d_{i,j-1} + w_\\\\mathrm{ins}(b_{j}) \\\\\\\\\\\\ d_{i-1,j-1} + w_\\\\mathrm{sub}(a_{i}, b_{j}) \\\\end{cases} & \\\\text{for}\\\\; a_{i} eq b_{j}\\\\end{cases} & & \\\\quad \\\\text{for}\\\\; 1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq m, 1 \\\\leq j \\\\leq n.\\\\end{align} This algorithm can be generalized to handle transpositions by adding another term in the recursive clause's minimization. The straightforward, recursive way of evaluating this recurrence takes exponential time. Therefore, it is usually computed using a dynamic programming algorithm that is commonly credited to Wagner and Fischer, although it has a history of multiple invention. After completion of the Wagner‚ÄìFischer algorithm, a minimal sequence of edit operations can be read off as a backtrace of the operations used during the dynamic programming algorithm starting at d_{mn}. This algorithm has a time complexity of Œò(). When the full dynamic programming table is constructed, its space complexity is also ; this can be improved to by observing that at any instant, the algorithm only requires two rows (or two columns) in memory. However, this optimization makes it impossible to read off the minimal series of edit operations. A linear-space solution to this problem is offered by Hirschberg's algorithm. =Improved algorithms= Improving on the Wagner‚ÄìFisher algorithm described above, Ukkonen describes several variants, one of which takes two strings and a maximum edit distance , and returns . It achieves this by only computing and storing a part of the dynamic programming table around its diagonal. This algorithm takes time , where and are the lengths of the strings. Space complexity is or , depending on whether the edit sequence needs to be read off. Further improvements by Landau, Myers, and Schmidt give an time algorithm. Applications Edit distance finds applications in computational biology and natural language processing, e.g. the correction of spelling mistakes or OCR errors, and approximate string matching, where the objective is to find matches for short strings in many longer texts, in situations where a small number of differences is to be expected. Various algorithms exist that solve problems beside the computation of distance between a pair of strings, to solve related types of problems. * Hirschberg's algorithm computes the optimal alignment of two strings, where optimality is defined as minimizing edit distance. * Approximate string matching can be formulated in terms of edit distance. Ukkonen's 1985 algorithm takes a string , called the pattern, and a constant ; it then builds a deterministic finite state automaton that finds, in an arbitrary string , a substring whose edit distance to is at most (cf. the Aho‚ÄìCorasick algorithm, which similarly constructs an automaton to search for any of a number of patterns, but without allowing edit operations). A similar algorithm for approximate string matching is the bitap algorithm, also defined in terms of edit distance. * Levenshtein automata are finite-state machines that recognize a set of strings within bounded edit distance of a fixed reference string.  Language edit distance  A generalization of the edit distance between strings is the language edit distance between a string and a language, usually a formal language. Instead of considering the edit distance between one string and another, the language edit distance is the minimum edit distance that can be attained between a fixed string and any string taken from a set of strings. More formally, for any language L and string x over an alphabet , the language edit distance d(L, x) is given byd(L,x) = \\\\min_{y \\\\in L} d(x,y) , where d(x,y) is the string edit distance. When the language L is context free, there is a cubic time dynamic programming algorithm proposed by Aho and Peterson in 1972 which computes the language edit distance. For less expressive families of grammars, such as the regular grammars, faster algorithms exist for computing the edit distance. Language edit distance has found many diverse applications, such as RNA folding, error correction, and solutions to the Optimum Stack Generation problem.

Deposition is the geological process in which sediments, soil and rocks are added to a landform or land mass. Wind, ice, water, and gravity transport previously weathered surface material, which, at the loss of enough kinetic energy in the fluid, is deposited, building up layers of sediment. Deposition occurs when the forces responsible for sediment transportation are no longer sufficient to overcome the forces of gravity and friction, creating a resistance to motion; this is known as the null-point hypothesis. Deposition can also refer to the buildup of sediment from organically derived matter or chemical processes. For example, chalk is made up partly of the microscopic calcium carbonate skeletons of marine plankton, the deposition of which has induced chemical processes (diagenesis) to deposit further calcium carbonate. Similarly, the formation of coal begins with the deposition of organic material, mainly from plants, in anaerobic conditions. Null-point hypothesis The null-point hypothesis explains how sediment is deposited throughout a shore profile according to its grain size. This is due to the influence of hydraulic energy, resulting in a seaward-fining of sediment particle size, or where fluid forcing equals gravity for each grain size. The concept can also be explained as \\"sediment of a particular size may move across the profile to a position where it is in equilibrium with the wave and flows acting on that sediment grain\\". This sorting mechanism combines the influence of the down-slope gravitational force of the profile and forces due to flow asymmetry; the position where there is zero net transport is known as the null point and was first proposed by Cornaglia in 1889. Figure 1 illustrates this relationship between sediment grain size and the depth of the marine environment. Figure 1. Illustrating the sediment size distribution over a shoreline profile, where finer sediments are transported away from high energy environments and settle out of suspension, or deposit in calmer environments. Coarse sediments are maintained in the upper shoreline profile and are sorted by the wave-generated hydraulic regime The first principle underlying the null point theory is due to the gravitational force; finer sediments remain in the water column for longer durations allowing transportation outside the surf zone to deposit under calmer conditions. The gravitational effect or settling velocity determines the location of deposition for finer sediments, whereas a grain's internal angle of friction determines the deposition of larger grains on a shore profile. The secondary principle to the creation of seaward sediment fining is known as the hypothesis of asymmetrical thresholds under waves; this describes the interaction between the oscillatory flow of waves and tides flowing over the wave ripple bedforms in an asymmetric pattern. \\"The relatively strong onshore stroke of the waveforms an eddy or vortex on the lee side of the ripple, provided the onshore flow persists, this eddy remains trapped in the lee of the ripple. When the flow reverses, the eddy is thrown upwards off the bottom and a small cloud of suspended sediment generated by the eddy is ejected into the water column above the ripple, the sediment cloud is then moved seaward by the offshore stroke of the wave.\\" Where there is symmetry in ripple shape the vortex is neutralised, the eddy and its associated sediment cloud develops on both sides of the ripple. This creates a cloudy water column which travels under the tidal influence as the wave orbital motion is in equilibrium. The Null-point hypothesis has been quantitatively proven in Akaroa Harbour, New Zealand, The Wash, U.K., Bohai Bay and West Huang Sera, Mainland China, and in numerous other studies; Ippen and Eagleson (1955), Eagleson and Dean (1959, 1961) and Miller and Zeigler (1958, 1964). = Deposition of non-cohesive sediments = Large-grain sediments transported by either bedload or suspended load will come to rest when there is insufficient bed shear stress and fluid turbulence to keep the sediment moving; with the suspended load this can be some distance as the particles need to fall through the water column. This is determined by the grain's downward acting weight force being matched by a combined buoyancy and fluid drag force and can be expressed by: : \\\\frac{4}{3} \\\\pi R^3 \\\\rho_s g = \\\\frac{4}{3} \\\\pi R^3 \\\\rho g + \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\Complex_d \\\\rho \\\\pi R^2 w_s^2\\\\, Downward acting weight force = Upward-acting buoyancy force + Upward-acting fluid drag force where: *œÄ is the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter. *R is the radius of the spherical object (in m), *œÅ is the mass density of the fluid (kg/m3), *g is the gravitational acceleration (m/s2), *Cd is the drag coefficient, and *ws is the particle's settling velocity (in m/s). In order to calculate the drag coefficient, the grain's Reynolds number needs to be discovered, which is based on the type of fluid through which the sediment particle is flowing, laminar flow, turbulent flow or a hybrid of both. When the fluid becomes more viscous due to smaller grain sizes or larger settling velocities, the prediction is less straightforward and it is applicable to incorporate Stokes Law (also known as the frictional force, or drag force) of settling. = Deposition of cohesive sediments = The cohesion of sediment occurs with the small grain sizes associated with silts and clays, or particles smaller than 4œï on the phi scale. If these fine particles remain dispersed in the water column, Stokes law applies to the settling velocity of the individual grains, although due to seawater being a strong electrolyte bonding agent, flocculation occurs where individual particles create an electrical bond adhering each other together to form flocs. \\"The face of a clay platelet has a slight negative charge where the edge has a slight positive charge when two platelets come into close proximity with each other the face of one particle and the edge of the other are electrostatically attracted.\\" Flocs then have a higher combined mass which leads to quicker deposition through a higher fall velocity, and deposition in a more shoreward direction than they would have as the individual fine grains of clay or silt. = The occurrence of null point theory = Akaroa Harbour is located on Banks Peninsula, Canterbury, New Zealand, . The formation of this harbour has occurred due to active erosional processes on an extinct shield volcano, whereby the sea has flooded the caldera, creating an inlet 16 km in length, with an average width of 2 km and a depth of ‚àí13 m relative to mean sea level at the 9 km point down the transect of the central axis. The predominant storm wave energy has unlimited fetch for the outer harbour from a southerly direction, with a calmer environment within the inner harbour, though localised harbour breezes create surface currents and chop influencing the marine sedimentation processes. Deposits of loess from subsequent glacial periods have in filled volcanic fissures over millennia, resulting in volcanic basalt and loess as the main sediment types available for deposition in Akaroa Harbour Figure 2. Map of Akaroa Harbour showing a fining of sediments with increased bathymetry toward the central axis of the harbour. Taken from Hart et al. (2009) and the University of Canterbury under the contract of Environment Canterbury. Hart et al. (2009) discovered through bathymetric survey, sieve and pipette analysis of subtidal sediments, that sediment textures were related to three main factors: depth, distance from shoreline, and distance along the central axis of the harbour. This resulted in the fining of sediment textures with increasing depth and towards the central axis of the harbour, or if classified into grain class sizes, ‚Äúthe plotted transect for the central axis goes from silty sands in the intertidal zone to sandy silts in the inner nearshore, to silts in the outer reaches of the bays to mud at depths of 6 m or more‚Äù. See figure 2 for detail. Other studies have shown this process of the winnowing of sediment grain size from the effect of hydrodynamic forcing; Wang, Collins and Zhu (1988) qualitatively correlated increasing intensity of fluid forcing with increasing grain size. \\"This correlation was demonstrated at the low energy clayey tidal flats of Bohai Bay (China), the moderate environment of the Jiangsu coast (China) where the bottom material is silty, and the sandy flats of the high energy coast of The Wash (U.K.).\\" This research shows conclusive evidence for the null point theory existing on tidal flats with differing hydrodynamic energy levels and also on flats that are both erosional and accretional. Kirby R. (2002) takes this concept further explaining that the fines are suspended and reworked aerially offshore leaving behind lag deposits of the main bivalve and gastropod shells separated out from the finer substrate beneath, waves and currents then heap these deposits to form chenier ridges throughout the tidal zone, which tend to be forced up the foreshore profile but also along the foreshore. Cheniers can be found at any level on the foreshore and predominantly characterise an erosion-dominated regime. = Applications for coastal planning and management = The null point theory has been controversial in its acceptance into mainstream coastal science as the theory operates in dynamic equilibrium or unstable equilibrium, and many fields and laboratory observations have failed to replicate the state of a null point at each grain size throughout the profile. The interaction of variables and processes over time within the environmental context causes issues; \\"a large number of variables, the complexity of the processes, and the difficulty in observation, all place serious obstacles in the way of systematisation, therefore in certain narrow fields the basic physical theory may be sound and reliable but the gaps are large\\" Geomorphologists, engineers, governments and planners should be aware of the processes and outcomes involved with the null point hypothesis when performing tasks such as beach nourishment, issuing building consents or building coastal defence structures. This is because sediment grain size analysis throughout a profile allows inference into the erosion or accretion rates possible if shore dynamics are modified. Planners and managers should also be aware that the coastal environment is dynamic and contextual science should be evaluated before the implementation of any shore profile modification. Thus theoretical studies, laboratory experiments, numerical and hydraulic modelling seek to answer questions pertaining to littoral drift and sediment deposition, the results should not be viewed in isolation and a substantial body of purely qualitative observational data should supplement any planning or management decision.

Roupen remained always friendly to the Crusaders in spirit. He was a just and good prince, and created many pious foundations within his domains. His life He was the eldest son of Stephen, the third son of Leo I, lord of Armenian Cilicia. His mother was Rita, a daughter of Sempad, Lord of Barbaron. Roupen's father, who was on his way to attend a banquet given by the Byzantine governor of Cilicia, Andronicus Euphorbenus, was murdered on February 7, 1165. Following his father's death, Roupen lived with his maternal uncle, Pagouran, lord of the fortress of Barbaron, protecting the Cilician Gates pass in the Taurus Mountains. Roupen took up the reins of Cilicia following the assassination of his paternal uncle, Mleh who had been murdered by members of his own inner circle of Armenian nobles on May 15, 1175. He was a friend of the Franks (the Crusaders); for example, at the end of 1177, he assisted Philip, Count of Flanders and Prince Bohemond III of Antioch at the ineffectual siege of Harenc. In June 1180, Saladin, the sultan of Egypt, and Kilij Arslan II, the sultan of Iconium met on the river Sanja and there, apparently concluded an alliance. The first fruits of their alliance were a short and successful campaign against Roupen III, on the pretext of harsh treatment of the Turkoman tribes in his territories. Roupen made peace with Kilij Arslan II in the same year. In the course of the year, many of the nobles of the Principality of Antioch who hated Sybilla, the new wife of Bohemond III fled to Roupen's court. Early in 1181, Roupen came on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, and there on 4 February1181/3 February 1182 he married Isabella of Toron, daughter of Humphrey III of Toron and Stephanie of Milly. At the end of 1182, the Byzantine governor of Cilicia, Isaac Comnenus, in revolt against the Emperor Andronicus I Comnenus, sought help from Bohemond III against Roupen and admitted his troops into Tarsus. Bohemond promptly changed his mind and sold Tarsus and the governor to Roupen, then repented of it. Isaac Comnenus was ransomed by the Knights Templar. In 1183, Hethum III of Lampron, allied with Bohemond III, began joint hostilities against Roupen. They invited Roupen to Antioch as a prelude to ending the counterproductive rivalry between the two Armenian houses, but upon his arrival Roupen was taken captive and imprisoned. But Roupen's brother Leo finished off the conquest of the Hethoumians and attacked Antioch. Roupen's release required payment of a large ransom and the submission of Adana and Mamistra as vassalages to Antioch; but on his return to Cilicia he soon recovered them. Bohemond III made various ineffectual raids but achieved nothing more. Roupen abdicated in favor of his brother and retired to the monastery of Drazark where he died.

Life Tubin was born in Torila, Tartu County, Governorate of Livonia, then part of the Russian Empire. Both his parents were music lovers, and his father played trombone in the village band. His first taste of music came at school where he learned the flute. Later, his father swapped a cow for a piano, and the young Eduard soon became known in the village for his playing. Eduard also played flute in the village orchestra. Tubin entered the Tartu Teacher's College in the newly independent Estonia in 1920. It was here he began to take an interest in composition. In 1924 he was admitted to the Tartu Higher Music School starting his studies under the guidance of the famous Estonian composer Heino Eller. He married a fellow student, Linda Pirn, in 1930 and their son Rein was born in 1932. Tubin took up work conducting in the Vanemuine theatre. During this time he also conducted one of the best- known male choirs and made several trips abroad. In 1938 he met Zolt√°n Kod√°ly in Hungary, who encouraged his interest in folk songs. In 1941 he married the ballet dancer Erika Saarik. Their son Eino was born in 1942. Eduard Tubin (far left) with other Estonian composers of the Tartu school of composition (left to right): Olav Roots, Heino Eller, Karl Leichter and Alfred Karindi, circa 1930. When the Soviet Union again occupied Estonia in 1944, Tubin fled to Stockholm with his wife Erika and sons Rein and Eino. He remained in Sweden and became a Swedish citizen in 1961, although he did visit Estonia on occasions. He was offered work at the historical Drottningholm Palace Theatre restoring old operas. This left him time to devote himself to his own composition. Here he wrote most of his greatest works, including two operas, symphonies 5-10, a second concerto for violin, one concerto for double-bass and one for balalaika, a piano concertino, much piano and violin music, choir and solo songs etc. Towards the end of his life, Tubin slowly began to gain recognition, particularly after the conductor Neeme J√§rvi, also an Estonian, escaped to the United States in 1980. In the last year of his life his Tenth Symphony was performed on 5 concerts by the Boston Symphony Orchestra. Tubin received several Swedish music awards and was elected member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Music. After a long illness he died on 17 November 1982 in Stockholm. Style Tubin often used Estonian folk music in his works, for instance in the Sinfonietta on Estonian motifs. His ballet Kratt is entirely based on folk tunes. In 1938 Tubin had visited the Estonian island of Hiiumaa to collect folk songs. Tubin was also a very good orchestrator, and this can be heard particularly in the Third and Fourth symphonies. A change took place in Tubin's style at the end of the 1940s; the music became harmonically more astringent. The finale of the seventh symphony makes much use of a theme with all twelve notes, though it is tonal. The shift to a less nationalistic and more international style came after Tubin had fled Estonia to Sweden. Conductor Olav Roots, Eduard Tubin and double-bassist in Stockholm Concert Hall in 1947. Tubin is perhaps not better known because of his displacement. Although Estonia claims him as one of their greatest composers, most of his composing was done in Sweden, which never gave him the attention he was due. Tubin is gaining recognition, however, particularly for his later symphonies and the Second Piano Sonata, which are recognised as masterpieces. Most of his works have been recorded (there are two complete recorded sets of his symphonies, conducted by Neeme J√§rvi and Arvo Volmer). In June 2005 the city of Tallinn observed the centennial of his birth with a festival where all of his symphonies and much of his piano and chamber music was performed. A statue of Tubin was erected in Tartu. A Tubin Museum was opened at the Alatskivi Castle near to his birthplace in 2011. This has an exhibition about the composer and other members of the \\"Tartu school\\" of musicians who studied under Heino Eller including Alfred Karindi, Eduard Oja, Olav Roots and Karl Leichter.

Born and raised in the village of Karaƒç, Vuƒçitrn, Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (modern day Kosovo), Ademi graduated from the Yugoslav military academy in Belgrade in 1976. He was assigned to a station in Rogoznica near ≈†ibenik in Croatia where he married and had two children. In 1986, the Military Court in Sarajevo convicted him of counterrevolutionary acts and Albanian irredentism, but after serving a year and a half in prison, the Supreme Military Court agreed with his appeal and acquitted him. He would spend the next years serving as an officer in Sinj until 1990 when the war in Croatia was starting and he deserted the Yugoslav People's Army in order to help create Croatian army formations. He officially joined the Ministry of the Interior in 1991 and later became part of the Croatian Army forces during the Croatian War of Independence. Between 1992 and 1993, as a Brigadier, he commanded Croatian military units in the Sinj area, with particular responsibility for the Peruƒáa Dam.Personal recollection as UN Military Observer Jul 1992 - Feb 1993. (Commando1664) In 1993 he was assigned to the post of sub commander of the Gospiƒá military district, but was relieved of duty later that year, after the controversial Operation Medak pocket. He later served as a sub-commander of the Split military district and was promoted to brigadier general for his achievements in Operation Storm in 1995. He remained there until 1999 when he was reassigned to the post of the Assistant Chief Inspector of the Armed Forces in Zagreb. In 2001, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) indicted Ademi for crimes against humanity allegedly committed against the Croatian Serbs in the Medak pocket. He was originally in the custody of the Court but was later allowed to prepare his defense free. In November 2005, in line with its completion strategy, the ICTY referred the Ademi-Norac case to the Croatian judiciary. The trial began on 18 June 2007 in front of a special bench of the Zagreb County Court with Judge Marin Mrƒçela presiding. Ademi claims that the Croatian government, under international pressure, relieved him of duty in Gospiƒá in 1993 in order to make him a scapegoat, rather than implicating commanding officers Janko Bobetko, Mirko Norac and Mladen Markaƒç. He alleged that the Tribunal wanted him for questioning as far back as 1998 but the government did not allow him to answer their questions. On 30 May 2008, he was acquitted by the Zagreb County Court of responsibility for atrocities committed against Serb prisoners by Croat troops during Operation Medak Pocket.Ademi Acquitted of Medak Pocket Crimes, iwpr.net; accessed 26 November 2014. In March 2010, the Supreme Court of Croatia upheld Ademi's acquittal.

For example, (US), (Canada), (UK), (Australia), (South Korea) and ABS- CBN (Philippines) are TV networks that provide programming for local terrestrial television station affiliates to air using signals that can be picked up by the home television sets of local viewers. Networks generally, but not always, operate on a national scale; that is, they cover an entire country. Streaming media, Internet radio, and webcasting are sometimes considered forms of broadcasting despite the lack of terrestrial stations; its practitioners may also be called \\"broadcasters\\" or even \\"broadcast networks\\". Logos of the five major U.S. terrestrial television networks (clockwise from top left: NBC, CBS, ABC, The CW, and FOX.) History Original major radio broadcasting networks in the United States =American networks= AT&T;'s \\"WEAF Chain\\" The WEAF and WJZ chains Following the introduction of radio broadcasting in the early 1920s, the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T;) developed the first radio network, linking together individual stations with specially prepared long-distance telephone lines in what at the time was called a \\"chain\\". The key station was AT&T;'s WEAF (now WFAN) in New York City. The network featured a variety of regularly scheduled programs which included sponsorships (at the time not called advertising but \\"toll broadcasting\\"). From the beginning, AT&T; planned to eventually expand nationwide, so that national companies would be able reach large portions of the nation with their brand names and slogans in an efficient manner. At first the network's expansion was slow. In 1924, the Eveready Hour was broadcast over 12 stations, primarily located in the U.S. Northeast. Eveready Hour was the first commercially sponsored variety show in the history of broadcasting. By 1925, AT&T; had linked together 26 stations in its network. AT&T; eventually decided to concentrate on its most profitable business, telephones, and in 1926 sold its broadcasting interests to the Radio Corporation of America (RCA). RCA's purchase included an agreement to lease AT&T; phone lines.Perry, Stephen D. (2004). A Consolidated History of Media (4th edition). Bloomington, IL: Epistelogic RCA's \\"WJZ Chain\\" In 1922 the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) followed AT&T;'s network model lead, and formed a small competing network centered on its New York City station, WJZ (now WABC). However, conflict resulted as RCA had a limited ability to lease lines from AT&T;, and often had to use telegraph lines to connect stations, which had inferior acoustical properties. NBC After acquiring WEAF and AT&T;'s network assets in 1926, RCA created the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) and reorganized the WEAF chain (with WGR, WTIC, WTAG, WEEI, WJAR, WZAN, WFI- WLIT, WCAE, WRC, WTAM, WSAI, WWJ, WGN, WOC, KSD, WDAF, WCCO) as the NBC Red network and the WJZ chain as the NBC Blue network (with WBZ, WBZA, KYW, KDKA). (One explanation for the color designations is that they reflected the red and blue push pins used on a map that AT&T; originally used to designate the affiliated stations on the two networks.) On 23 December 1928, NBC instituted the first permanent transcontinental network. As of September 1938, when there were 154 NBC outlets; 23 composed the basic Red network and 24 composed the basic Blue network. Supplementing these basic networks were 107 stations, of which one was available only to the basic Red network, six were available only to the basic Blue network, and the remainder available to either. NBC also had a chain of shortwave stations, called the \\"NBC White Network\\", in the 1930s. In 1941, the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) Report on Chain BroadcastingFederal Communications Commission: Report on Chain Broadcasting (May 1941). reviewed the alleged monopolistic practices of the radio networks. The FCC was concerned NBC Red and NBC Blue were anti-competitive. Because the FCC did not have the power to directly regulate networks, it decided to enact regulations affecting the stations, and adopted standards intended to force NBC to relinquish one of its networks. In 1943, the Supreme Court upheld the FCC's power to enforce its chain broadcasting regulations.Rivera-Sanchez, M. (1998). Report on Chain Broadcasting. History of the Mass Media in the United States, An Encyclopedia, pg 590‚Äì591.National Broadcasting Co. v. U.S., 310 U.S. 190 (1943). As a consequence, NBC Blue was sold to Edward Noble who later named it the American Broadcasting Company (ABC). After NBC Blue was divested the remaining NBC Red network was renamed the NBC Radio Network. CBS In 1927, United Independent Broadcasters, Inc., supported by the Columbia Phonograph Record Company, started a new network of 16 stations (WOR New York, WFBL Syracuse, WMAK Buffalo-Lockport, WNAC Boston, WEAN Providence, WCAU Philadelphia, WJAS Pittsburgh, WCAO Baltimore, WADC Akron, WAIU Columbus, WKRC Cincinnati, WGHP Detroit, WOWO Fort Wayne, WMAQ Chicago, KMOX St. Louis, KOIL Council Bluffs) named the Columbia Phonographic Broadcasting System. In 1928 William S. Paley assumed control of the network, which under his leadership focused on entertainment programming, news, and news affiliation. He quickly turned the failing company around, which was named Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. (CBS) in 1929. By the end of 1938 there were 113 CBS outlets. Regional networks on CBS also existed in various parts of the country. CBS later hired Edward R. Murrow who is credited with boosting ratings dramatically. Murrow and CBS covered the war in Europe while Adolf Hitler was in power. NBC and ABC withdrew from the war for safety reasons. As a result of taking the risk, CBS's ratings skyrocketed.Edwards, B. (2004). Edward R. Murrow and the Birth of Broadcast Journalism. New Jersey: Navta Associates, Inc. ABC In 1945, the NBC Blue network was sold to Edward John Noble, who later renamed it American Broadcasting Company (ABC). By the mid-1940s broadcasting had become a big Three television networks battle. ABC almost went bankrupt and in 1951 Leonard Goldenson and United Paramount Theaters bought the network for $25 million. In 1964, ABC won the ratings race in the fifty largest U.S. markets. In the 1970‚Äì71 season, ABC ranked #1 in the Nielsen ratings with a medical drama called Marcus Welby, M.D.,American Broadcasting Company, The Museum of Broadcast Communications. the first ABC television show to top the list. Mutual In 1929, a group of four radio stations in the major markets of New York City, Chicago, Cincinnati, and Detroit organized into a loose confederation known as the Quality Network. In 1934 this was reorganized as the Mutual Broadcasting System. The network was organized with the members contracting for telephone-line transmission facilities and agreeing to collectively enter into contracts with advertisers for their networked shows.

The French merchants contracted to transport colonists did not respect their end of the bargain, and the French and their Indian allies were at war with the Iroquois, allied to the English until 1701, etc. To add to these difficulties, the printing press was officially forbidden in Canada until the British Conquest. In spite of this, some notable documents were produced in the early days of colonization and were passed down from generation to generation until today. The Voyage of Jacques Cartier, the Muses de la Nouvelle-France of Marc Lescarbot, the Voyages of Samuel de Champlain are memories of the exploration of North America and the foundation of New France. The Relations des j√©suites, Le Grand voyage au pays des Hurons of Gabriel Sagard, the √âcrits of Marguerite Bourgeois were written by the many religious founders of New France who had undertaken the task of converting the Sauvages to Christianity. Many songs and poems were transmitted orally by the early French settlers. A popular French ballad, √Ä la claire fontaine was adapted by the voyageurs and gave us the version that is known today in Quebec. The first patriotic song of Quebec (then known as le Canada) was written by a soldier, Fran√ßois Mariauchau d'Esgly. Entitled C'est le G√©n√©ral de Flip, it paid tribute to the resistance of the French at Quebec during the siege of General William Phips in 1690. In France, Canada and New France in general caught the interest of many writers, notably Fran√ßois Rabelais who refers to Cartier and Roberval in Pantagruel.  18th century  Until 1760, the themes of nature, explorations, and the Sauvages continued to mark the imagination of the civilization of New France. The Moeurs des sauvages am√©ricains of Joseph-Fran√ßois Lafitau, Histoire de l'Am√©rique septentrionale of Bacqueville de la Potherie and the Histoire et description g√©n√©rale de la Nouvelle-France are in continuity with the writings of the preceding century. The first verified use of the term Canadien to designate the descendants of French settlers in Canada was written in a song composed in 1756 in honour of Governor Vaudreuil after the military victory of Fort Chouaguen. In 1758, √âtienne Marchand wrote a famous poem in Le carillon de la Nouvelle-France. This song tells the story of the victorious battle of Fort Carillon. The first poem written by a Canadien after the cession of Canada to Great Britain is Quand Georges trois pris l'Canada written by an anonymous author in 1763. The Quebec Gazette newspaper was founded in Quebec City by William Brown on June 21, 1764. The bilingual paper was published in both the French language and the English language and over the years survived to be the oldest newspaper still publishing in North America. The literary trends of Europe and the rest of America slowly penetrated the cities, primarily Quebec City and Montreal. The writings of the Enlightenment and those produced at the time of the American and French revolutions were dominant in the available literature. Valentin Jautard and Fleury Mesplet published the first journal of Quebec, the Gazette du commerce et litt√©raire, in 1778‚Äì79. Valentin Jautard, a disciple of Voltaire and sympathizer with the American cause, published many poems under different pseudonyms. Some notable names of the time are Joseph-Octave Plessis, Ross Cuthbert, Joseph Quesnel and Pierre de Sales Laterri√®re. In France, Voltaire wrote L'Ing√©nu, the tale of a Huron who visits France and also Chateaubriand, a French noble exiled in America, wrote Atala and Ren√©.  19th century  The 19th century marks the beginning of the first real literary works published by Quebecers, including Michel Bibaud, Pierre Boucher de Boucherville, Fran√ßois R√©al Angers, Phillipe-Ignace Fran√ßois Aubert de Gasp√©, Am√©d√©e Papineau, Joseph Doutre, Fran√ßois-Xavier Garneau, Pierre Jean Olivier Chauveau, Louis-Antoine Dessaulles, H.-√âmile Chevalier. By the 1860s, Quebec authors were able to acquire a certain autonomy, as it became easier to publish a book and mass-produce it. Antoine G√©rin-Lajoie, Philippe-Joseph Aubert de Gasp√©, Louis Fr√©chette, Arthur Buies, William Kirby, Honor√© Beaugrand, Laure Conan, Edith Maude Eaton, William Chapman, Jules-Paul Tardivel, Winnifred Eaton, Pamphile Lemay were some of the key writers in this era.

Her keel was laid down on 2 July 1944 by DeSchiMAG AG Weser of Bremen, and she was commissioned on 19 October 1944 with Kapit√§nleutnant Fokko Schl√∂mer in command. In March 1945 Schl√∂mer was relieved by Kapit√§nleutnant Helmut Manseck who commanded the boat until Nazi Germany's surrender on 8 May. Design Like all Type XXI U-boats, U-3008 had a displacement of when at the surface and while submerged. She had a total length of (o/a), a beam length of , and a draught length of . The submarine was powered by two MAN SE supercharged six-cylinder M6V40/46KBB diesel engines each providing , two Siemens-Schuckert GU365/30 double-acting electric motors each providing , and two Siemens-Schuckert silent running GV232/28 electric motors each providing . The submarine had a maximum surface speed of and a submerged speed of . When running on silent motors the boat could operate at a speed of . When submerged, the boat could operate at for ; when surfaced, she could travel at . U-3008 was fitted with six torpedo tubes in the bow and four C/30 anti- aircraft guns. She could carry twenty-three torpedoes or seventeen torpedoes and twelve mines. The complement was five officers and fifty-two men. Service history =Kriegsmarine= U-3008 left Wilhelmshaven for patrol on 3 May 1945, but returned to port after the surrender. On 21 June 1945 she was taken by the Allies from Wilhelmshaven to Loch Ryan, thence transferred to the United States, reaching New London, Connecticut, on 22 August. =United States Navy= On 13 September, she moved to the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine, where she began an extensive overhaul the following day. Work proceeded on an intermittent basis due to the lack of final and total approval of the vessel's allocation to the United States by the Allied powers concerned. However, by the spring of 1946, the naval shipyard received orders to proceed with the overhaul as expeditiously as possible and to place the submarine in service immediately upon its completion. U-3008's overhaul was completed by mid-summer, and she was placed into active U.S. Navy service on 24 July 1946 with Commander Everett H. Steinmetz in charge. U-3008 was assigned initially to Submarine Squadron 2 and operated along the New England coast out of New London and Portsmouth. That duty continued until 31 March 1947, when she departed New London bound ultimately for Key West, Florida, and duty with the Operational Development Force. En route, the U-boat stopped off at Norfolk, Virginia, for three weeks of underway operations with Task Force 67. She continued south on 19 April and arrived at Key West on 23 April. There, she reported for duty with Submarine Squadron 4 and began working with the Operational Development Force. That duty involved the development of submarine and antisubmarine tactics and lasted until October 1947 when she returned to New London. The U-boat conducted operations out of New London and Portsmouth between October 1947 and February 1948. On 28 February, she stood out of New London to return to Florida. She reached Key West on 5 March and resumed duty with the Operational Development Force. She remained so engaged until the end of the first week in June. On 7 June, she headed north once more and arrived in Portsmouth on 11 June. On 18 June 1948 U-3008 was placed out of service at the Portsmouth Navy Yard in New Hampshire. Though out of service, U-3008 remained a Navy test hulk for several years. She was scuttled in a series of demolition tests in 1954. The hulk was raised and towed to the Navy drydock at Roosevelt Roads where she was offered up for sale in 1955. She was sold to Loudes Iron & Metal Company on 15 September 1955, and the purchaser took possession of her on 17 January 1956. She was subsequently scrapped.

The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) indicted him on war crimes charges and in 2000 he was sentenced to 45 years of prison. In July 2004, the ICTY, on appeal, determined that his command responsibility for most of the charges was non-existent and his sentence was lessened to nine years imprisonment. He was released the following month. Early life Tihomir Bla≈°kiƒá was born on 2 November 1960Profile , ess.uwe.ac.uk; accessed 13 April 2015. in the village of Brestovsko in the Kiseljak municipality of Bosnia-Herzegovina, FPR Yugoslavia. He was a career military officer and graduated from the Belgrade Military Academy in 1983, having previously been a captain in the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA).http://www.icty.org/x/cases/blaskic/ind/en/bla-1ai961122e.pdf During the period referred to in the indictment, he held the rank of colonel in the Croatian Defence Council (HVO), the official military formation of the Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia. From 27 June 1992, Bla≈°kiƒá was Commander of the Regional Headquarters of the Armed Forces in central Bosnia. Subsequently, in August 1994, he was promoted to the rank of general and appointed Commander of the HVO, which had its headquarters in Mostar. In November 1995, he was given the post of inspector in the General Inspectorate of the Army of the Republic of Croatia. Bosnian War Following international recognition of Bosnia on 6 April 1992, armed conflict erupted between the different communities. As a result, on 8 April 1992, the Bosnian Croats created the HVO, backed by the Croatian Army (HV). The zones which they had control over were contained within the Croatian Community of Bosnia- Herzegovina (HZBH). Bla≈°kiƒá was in command of the HVO troops in the La≈°va Valley in central Bosnia, which was inhabited, in the majority, by Muslims and Croats. Between May 1992 and January 1993, relations between the two communities became increasingly strained. This peace plan gave definition to a decentralised Bosnia-Herzegovina, organised into ten provinces, each benefiting from substantial autonomy and each being administered by a democratically elected local government. Under this plan, the La≈°va Valley was attached, for the greater part, to a province where the principal responsibilities were attributed to the Croats. Muslims wanted Coatian territories as satisfaction for territories lost from Serbs. The Croats are expelled from Travnik, Bugojno, Kakanj, Vare≈°, Konjic, Fojnica etc. War crimes In 1996 the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) indicted Bla≈°kiƒá for crimes committed by troops under his command against Bosniaks in central Bosnia, particularly the La≈°va Valley, including grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions, violations of the laws or customs of war and crimes against humanity. In reaction, Franjo Tuƒëman named Bla≈°kiƒá Inspector General of the Croatian Army. Later in the year, Bla≈°kiƒá was told by his military superiors that it was his duty to voluntarily surrender and he reluctantly did so; his trial began in 1997. On 3 March 2000, The First Trial Chamber of the ICTY handed down its verdict, which condemned Bla≈°kiƒá to 45 years in prison. The First Trial Chamber charged Bla≈°kiƒá, based on his individual personal responsibility (Art. 7 ¬ß 1 ICTY Statute) and on his responsibility as hierarchical superior (Art. 7 ¬ß 3 ICTY Statute), on the following counts: * serious breaches of the Geneva Conventions of 1949 (Art. 2 ICTY Statute: wilful murder, wilfully causing great suffering or serious injury to body or health; widespread destruction of property; inhumane treatment, taking of civilian hostages); * violations of the laws and customs of war (Art. 3 ICTY Statute: devastation not justified by military necessity; illegal attacks on civilians; illegal attacks on civilian property, murder; infliction of grievous bodily harm; looting of public or private property; destruction or wilful damage to institutions dedicated to religion or education; cruel treatment; hostage taking; * crimes against humanity (Art. 5 ICTY Statutes: persecutions on political, racial or religious grounds; murder; inhumane acts). The case was in appeal until July 2004 when the ICTY appeals panel dismissed 16 of 19 counts in the initial indictment, notably the claim that Bla≈°kiƒá had command responsibility for the massacre in Ahmiƒái and that Ahmiƒái was not a legitimate military target. The decision did not assess the nature of Croat-Muslim war in Bosnia in 1993‚Äì94; it accepted the defense claim that there existed a \\"double chain of command\\". The appeals panel reaffirmed less serious charges, including responsibility for the inhumane treatment of POWs. It reduced Bla≈°kiƒá's prison sentence to nine years, purportedly due to his good behavior, clear prior record, poor health, voluntary surrender and his young children. His defense applied for an early release as he had served eight years and four months already; the request was granted on 29 July 2004 (see ICTY, 'Tihomir Bla≈°kiƒá Granted Early Release', Press Release, 29 July 2004). Exactly one year later, ICTY prosecutor Carla Del Ponte filed a motion for new trial, citing new evidence.

He is noted for his primary role in the 1995 Operation Storm. In 2001, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) indicted him on war crimes and crimes against humanity charges in connection with that operation and its aftermath. After spending four years in hiding, he was captured in the Canary Islands in December 2005. On 16 November 2012, Gotovina's convictions were overturned by an appeals panel at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and he was released from custody. Early life Ante Gotovina was born in Tkon on the island of Pa≈°man. His father Milan tried to move with his mother to Italy, but was caught by the Yugoslav border police. His mother was released while his father spent time in prison. When Gotovina was nearly four, his mother was killed saving him from an explosion at a construction site. Subsequently, his father went to work in Zagreb, while Gotovina and his siblings went to live with their maternal grandfather ≈†ime in Pako≈°tane. Around Easter of 1971, Gotovina and his friend Sreƒáko tried to escape by sailing away. They soon returned to Pako≈°tane after a storm caused troubles at sea. Gotovina hid his attempt to escape from his family and continued to attend school for electrical engineering in Zadar. French Foreign Legion At the age of sixteen, Gotovina left home to become a sailor. In 1973, before turning eighteen, he joined the French Foreign Legion under the pseudonym of Andrija Grabovac and became a member of the 2nd Foreign Parachute Regiment (2e REP) after qualifying at the Training School in Pau before joining the elite Commandos de Recherche et d'Action en Profondeur (CRAP) now renamed as Parachute Commando Group (GCP). It was there he met Dominique Erulin, brother of the Colonel Philippe Erulin, who became his friend and partner in future missions. In the next few years, he participated in Foreign Legion operations in Djibouti, the Battle of Kolwezi in Zaire, and missions in the Ivory Coast, becoming Colonel Erulin's driver. After five years of service, he left the Legion with the rank of caporal-chef; he obtained French citizenship in 1979.  Life in France  He subsequently worked for a variety of French private security companies during the 1980s, among them KO International Company, a filial or subsidiary of VHP Security, known as a cover for the Service d'Action Civique (SAC), and was at this time responsible for the security of far-right politician Jean-Marie Le Pen. In 1981, together with Dominique Erulin, he helped editor Jean-Pierre Mouchard (a close friend of Jean-Marie Le Pen) organize a commando operation to free his press in La Seyne-sur-Mer, occupied by CGT trade-union strikers. According to French police records, he became involved in criminal activities, which led to arrest warrants being issued for robbery and extortion; it has been reported that he served at least one two-year prison sentence, though this has been denied by his attorneys. Towards the end of the decade he moved to South America, where he provided training to a number of right-wing paramilitary organizations, notably in Argentina and Guatemala. He met his first wife Ximena Dalel in Colombia, and they had a daughter. Arrested during a trip to France, he was sentenced in 1986 to five years of prison by Paris' Cour d'assises.Axis Information and Analysis - Ante Gotovina: Gangster, General, National Hero...

He was freed the next year, \\"in circumstances showing that he was benefiting from very particular protections\\".https://web.archive.org/web/20060522200903/http://www.axisglobe.com/article.asp?article=548 Dominique Erulin disputes the verdict against Gotovina and himself and claims Gotovina's criminal record was manufactured by left-wing factions allied with President Fran√ßois Mitterrand. Gotovina's lawyers submitted a brief to the International War Crimes Tribunal alleging that Gotovina was framed by an alleged criminal police group loyal to Fran√ßois Mitterrand. Croatian War of Independence Gotovina returned to Croatia in 1991 when the Croatian War of Independence was beginning, and enlisted in the Croatian National Guard (ZNG), the first organized military body of what would become the Croatian Army. He was an efficient commander and had the advantage ‚Äì shared by relatively few other Croatian soldiers ‚Äì of combat experience. He fought in western Slavonia: in Novska and Nova Gradi≈°ka, attached to the 1st Guards Brigade. He soon caught the attention of his superiors, and when the Croatian Army was established as such in 1992, Gotovina was promoted to Colonel. As a colonel he was one of the main organizers of Operation Maslenica, which restored Croatia's territorial continuity in Dalmatia. By 1994 he had risen to the rank of major-general and, as a general-pukovnik and commanding officer of the Split military district he organized key military operations: the defense of Livno and Tomislavgrad from the troops of Bosnian Serb general Ratko Mladiƒá, and the ten-month war of attrition which broke the Serb defenses in the Plain of Livno, the Dinara Ridge and the ≈†ator mountain. He led the conquest of Glamoƒç and Bosansko Grahovo (Operation Summer '95), which enabled him to close from the east the encirclement of Knin, the capital of the self-declared (1991‚Äì95) Republic of Serbian Krajina. This ensured conditions for the rapid success of Operation Oluja (\\"Storm\\") in 4‚Äì6 August 1995, during which forces under his command captured Knin.Tanner, Marcus (1997) Croatia: A Nation Forged in War. Gotovina was then immediately put in charge of the combined forces of the Croatian Army (Hrvatska Vojska or HV) and the Croatian Defense Council in Bosnia (Hrvatsko Vijeƒáe Obrane or HVO) in Operation Mistral 2, which defeated the army of the Bosnian Serbs and led the Croatian army, together with the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina, within 23 kilometres of Banja Luka and was only stopped under American pressure. Post-war period In 1996, he became the chief of the Army Inspectorate. In September 2000, he was a signatory to the Twelve Generals' Letter in which the government of Ivica Raƒçan was criticised. Among the other generals, he was forced to retire by president Stjepan Mesiƒá, with an explanation that military officers shouldn't write political letters if not approved by the supreme commander and the president, respectively. War crimes indictment =Flight and attendant political controversies= In July 2001, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) issued sealed indictments to the Croatian government seeking the arrest of Ante Gotovina and Mladen Markaƒç for war crimes and crimes against humanity allegedly committed between 4 August 1995 and 15 November 1995. Gotovina was indicted together with Markaƒç, a former commander of the special police of Croatia's interior ministry, and Ivan ƒåermak, assistant defense minister from 1991 to 1993. The three were accused of \\"aiding and abetting the murders of 324 Krajina Serb civilians and prisoners of war by shooting, burning and/or stabbing\\" them and \\"forcibly displacing almost 90,000 Serb civilians\\". Gotovina was charged with five counts of crimes against humanity (persecutions, deportation, inhumane acts, murder) and four counts of violations of the laws or customs of war (plunder, wanton destruction, murder, cruel treatment). He denied all charges. For four years, 2001‚Äì2005, Gotovina remained at large despite intense pressure from the United States and the European Union for his surrender. Foreign countries sought to hunt down Gotovina, and an Interpol warrant was issued for his arrest. The United States announced a $5 million (‚Ç¨4.2 million) reward for his capture. The British Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) was reported in Croatian media in 2004 to have been allowed to import sophisticated monitoring equipment to track down Gotovina. This caused resentment among elements of Croatia's security establishment; as a result, MI6 officers based in Croatia under cover were exposed in the Croatian media, allegedly at the behest of Gotovina's sympathisers in Croatia's counter-intelligence service, the POA (Protuobavje≈°tajna agencija). Prior to that, a number of Croatian security officials were sacked, including POA head Franjo Turek, who was replaced by Jo≈°ko Podbev≈°ek and shortly afterwards by Tomislav Karamarko. The wiretapping operation went ahead after Turek's retirement in March 2004, under his successor at the POA, but failed to locate Gotovina before a deadline set by the Croatian prime minister Ivo Sanader in June 2004. According to a leaked memo from MI6 to the POA, the UK government had called for Turek's arrest, unless he started to cooperate on Gotovina. Several EU member states, including the UK and the Netherlands, made the surrender of Gotovina a precondition for Croatia's accession to the European Union. This stance was criticised by the Croatian government, which claimed ignorance of Gotovina's whereabouts but that he was probably outside the country and that it was doing all it could to bring him to justice. Accession negotiations with the EU, scheduled to start on 17 March 2005, were postponed pending a resolution of the issue. In September 2005, ICTY's chief prosecutor Carla Del Ponte claimed she had information that he was hiding in a Franciscan monastery in Croatia or in Bosnian Croat territory. She went to the Vatican to ask for help in locating him, but told The Daily Telegraph that the Vatican Secretary for Relations with States, Archbishop Giovanni Lajolo, had refused to help, telling her that the Vatican was not a state and thus had \\"no international obligations\\". Her comments infuriated the Church in Croatia as well as the Vatican, whose spokesman Joaqu√≠n Navarro-Valls said the archbishop asked Del Ponte what evidence she had for her claims but which she reportedly did not provide. Del Ponte was later criticized for making contradictory statements about Gotovina's whereabouts in September 2005.Jos Verhulst. \\"How fair can War Crimes Tribunal be with this Prosecutor?\\", The Brussels Journal, 16 December 2005. =Capture and extradition= On 7 December 2005, Gotovina was captured by Spanish police and special forces in the resort of Playa de las Am√©ricas on Tenerife in the Canary Islands. He was reported to have been traveling on two fake Croatian passports using the names, Kristijan Horvat and Stjepan Seniƒçiƒá. His passport contained border stamps of several countries, including Argentina, Chile, Russia, China, Czech Republic and Tahiti. A sum of money amounting to ‚Ç¨12,000 was discovered in his room.War Crimes Case Revives Passions in a Divided Croatia The New York Times 12 December 2005 He was immediately flown to Madrid, where he was imprisoned in advance of a court hearing to extradite him to the ICTY prison at The Hague. Spanish police were later reported to have been tracking him for several days, apparently following a lead obtained through the wiretapping of his wife Dunja's phone. The involvement of Croatian authorities was backed up by the Carla's List documentary, a part of which is available on YouTube. Croatian media credited Josip Buljeviƒá (subsequently the SOA's director, later president Kolinda Grabar-Kitaroviƒá's national security advisorCroatia Today (12:00), 28 January 2015. and since January 2016 defence minister) with being in charge of the operation to locate and arrest Gotovina. On 10 December 2005, Gotovina was flown to The Hague, where he appeared before the ICTY on 12 December. He pleaded not guilty to the seven charges brought against him, for acting individually and/or through a joint criminal enterprise in persecutions, deportation and forced displacement and other inhumane acts for a total of four counts of crimes against humanity; and murder, plunder of property and wanton destruction of settlements in three counts of violations of the laws or customs of war. According to his lawyer, Gotovina has declared that he is \\"not the man described in each and every count.\\" =Reactions= \\"Croatian pride\\", Makarska centre, September 2011 Many Croats continued to regard Gotovina as a war hero and rejected the assertion that he was guilty of crimes. Major parties in Croatia were reported to be using Gotovina as a means of drumming up political support in the run-up to the 2007 parliamentary election. During his flight, Gotovina became a prominent icon of Croatian popular culture. Marko Perkoviƒá and Miroslav ≈†koro, two popular Croatian musicians, recorded songs with lyrics implicitly praising the general and his flight, and both songs became huge hits, especially among younger fans.Baker, Catherine. Sounds of the Borderland: Popular Music, War and Nationalism in Croatia (2010) In 2006, the two most popular football teams in the country, Dinamo Zagreb and Hajduk Split, played a match, whose proceeds went to help finance the generals' legal fees. In March 2005, a survey conducted on behalf of the U.S. Embassy in Croatia reported that a majority of those surveyed thought it was not in Croatia's interest to extradite Gotovina. Unofficial polls by television programs also showed strong support, with most callers saying that they would prefer Gotovina remain at large even if it meant not joining the European Union. In 2001 the Croatian writer Nenad Ivankoviƒá wrote a biography of Gotovina, Warrior-Adventurer and General (A Biography). The Croatian filmmaker Dejan ≈†orak wrote and directed Two Players from the Bench (Dva igraƒça s klupe), a black comedy released in 2005 whose plot was inspired by the events surrounding the indictments against Gotovina. After Gotovina's arrest in Spain, several rallies and protests took place in Croatian cities. On 11 December 2005 (the first Sunday after his arrest), a rally organised by war veterans attracted between 40,000 and 70,000 Croatians in the city of Split to protest the arrest.Bideleux, Robert & Jeffries, Ian. The Balkans: a post-communist history (2007). Several retired generals attended the rally and expressed their support for Gotovina. On the same day, rallies were held in several other cities in Croatia, but with smaller attendance (in Zagreb some 500 people gathered). Polls taken by the PULS Agency after Gotovina's arrest showed that almost two-thirds of the Croatian public found the accusations baseless. Trial At the end of 2006, Gotovina's case was combined with cases of Ivan ƒåermak and Mladen Markaƒç, as they all relate to Operation Storm. The Trial of Gotovina et al was expected to begin in May 2007 but was postponed indefinitely because of conflicts between lawyers on the defence bench. His lawyers were Luka Misetic, an American attorney of Croatian descent, Greg Kehoe, an American lawyer who advised the prosecution in the Iraqi Special Tribunal case against Saddam Hussein, and Payam Akhavan, former Legal Advisor to the Prosecutor's Office of the ICTY. After the 2006 death of Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá, Gotovina signed a condolence note to his family (together with Mladen Naletiliƒá Tuta, Ivica Rajiƒá and other Croat and Serb detainees, making the list 34 signatures long), which was published in Belgrade's Politika and Veƒçernje novosti newspapers. Gotovina's attorney stated that he signed because of his Catholic faith, which stresses forgiveness. The trial began on 11 March 2008, and it concluded in September 2010 with the delivery of closing arguments. Misetic said that he expected a verdict in two to 10 months' time, as had been the case with the tribunal's decisions to date. =First-degree verdict= On 15 April 2011, Gotovina was found guilty on 8 of the 9 counts of the indictment and sentenced to 24 years of imprisonment. He was convicted of \\"committing war crimes and crimes against humanity, including murder, deportation, persecution and inhuman acts\\" and Presiding Judge Alphons Orie cited several witness testimonies in the decision. In the Gotovina Defence Final Trial Brief, a 315-page document, Gotovina's lawyers rejected the accusation of mass expulsion of Serbian population as well as the accusation of unlawful shelling of civilian areas, saying that the \\"HV used artillery solely against military objectives in a highly professional operation consistent with well-established military doctrine\\". In Zagreb, Croatia's capital, thousands gathered to watch the sentence being given out live on large screens and loudly protested the decision. Croatian prime minister Jadranka Kosor stated the idea of a \\"joint criminal enterprise\\" was \\"unacceptable\\". War veterans staged a march in the Croatian capital in protest. About 10,000 showed up to the march, chanting slogans against the Kosor-led government and the EU as protesters removed and ripped apart the EU flag from a flagpole at the main square, replacing it with the Croatian flag. A poll conducted immediately after the verdict showed that 95.4% of Croatians felt the judgment against Gotovina was unjust and that 88% still saw him as a hero. Support for Croatia's entry into the European Union plummeted to 23.8%. In June 2011, Gotovina was ranked the second most creditable person for the creation of an independent Croatian state in a poll conducted by Veƒçernji list. =Appeal verdict= On 16 November 2012, Gotovina was found not guilty by three votes against two by the Appeals Panel of the ICTY, presided over by Theodor Meron. The previous verdict had sentenced him to 24 years in prison while Mladen Markaƒç was sentenced to 18 years. Both of them were accused of being part of the \\"criminal enterprise\\" but the Court concluded there was no such conspiracy. On 15 November, the night before the verdict, candle-lit vigils were held across Croatia, including at Catholic churches. Gotovina and Markaƒç were supported by numerous Croatian veterans, and some marched from Zagreb's Mirogoj cemetery to the Zagreb Cathedral. Gotovina's acquittal provoked mixed international reactions. Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanoviƒá reacted positively, as did the Croatian president Ivo Josipoviƒá. Serbian President Tomislav Nikoliƒá reacted negatively, as did Serbian government minister Rasim Ljajiƒá and Prime Minister Ivica Daƒçiƒá and much of the Serbian media. The Serbian government froze its relations with the Tribunal. On the other hand, Veselin ≈†ljivanƒçanin congratulated the generals on their release and blamed the political leaders instead. Reactions in Bosnia and Herzegovina were mixed: positive reactions came from the President of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina ≈Ωivko Budimir and Croatian politician Dragan ƒåoviƒá, while the President of Republika Srpska Milorad Dodik responded negatively. The case raised significant issues for law of war and it has been described as a precedent. Carla del Ponte, former Chief Prosecutor of ICTY, was described as shocked by the verdict.This is no justice, english.ruvr.ru; accessed 19 March 2015. Ivan ≈†imonoviƒá, former Croatian minister of justice and current UN Assistant Secretary-General for human rights, said that the verdict would have an important role in interpretation of some regulations of international criminal law. Serbian politician Vuk Jeremiƒá, President of the UN General Assembly, criticized the ICTY on Twitter. and in response scheduled a UN GA session to discuss the work of the ad-hoc Tribunals set up by UN. After release A billboard showing a picture of Ante Gotovina on a road near Dubrovnik. After the generals' release, the Croatian government dispatched the governmental Bombardier Challenger 600 plane along with the Minister of Defence, Ante Kotromanoviƒá, and the Minister of Veterans' Affairs, Predrag Matiƒá, to bring Gotovina and Markaƒç to Croatia. In Zagreb, they were greeted by Prime Minister Zoran Milanoviƒá and the Speaker of Parliament Josip Leko. Around 100,000 people heard them speak at the Ban Jelaƒçiƒá Square, after which Cardinal Josip Bozaniƒá held a mass for them at the Zagreb Cathedral. The two generals were then received by the President at the Presidential Palace where Gotovina said that the \\"Homeland War is now clean, it belongs to our history, it is a basis on which we build our future.\\" Matiƒá said that Gotovina and Markaƒç are amongst the candidates for a new highest Croatian decoration. On 19 November 2012, the Belgrade-based tabloid Kurir ran an interview with Gotovina, who urged Serbs displaced after Operation Storm to return to Croatia. On 23 November 2012, Gotovina became an honorary citizen of Split and the next day he became an honorary citizen of Zadar. On 2 December he was named honorary citizen of Osijek along with Markaƒç. In November 2012, Serbia's government requested that the ICTY transfer the evidence against both generals to them for their own investigation. In January 2013, Serbia's War Crimes Prosecutor Vladimir Vukƒçeviƒá said that the acquittal was final and a review of the case was impossible. On 7 January 2014, it was announced that Gotovina had filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Treasury to lift economic sanctions imposed against him, which had been in place for more than a decade, listing Gotovina as a Specially Designated National in 2003, subject to economic sanctions. On 6 February, the Federal Register announced Gotovina's removal from the list.Unblocking of Three Individuals Blocked Pursuant to Executive Order 13219, as Amended, federalregister.gov; accessed 19 March 2015. In 2016, a prominent Croatian film director and actor Antun Vrdoljak, announced making a film, The General, about life of Ante Gotovina, based on Nenad Ivankoviƒá's book Warrior-Adventurer and General (A Biography) Croatian Hollywood actor Goran Vi≈°njiƒá who plays Gotovina in the film announced that he won't take any money for this role and that he will participate in the film for free. Croatian Ministry of Defence also announced that they will give all the necessary equipment without charge.

Local stamps are considered cinderella stamps. Allied propaganda stamps for the World War II Spitfire Fund and its accompanying booklet A used railway stamp from Queensland, Australia, for 1 penny valid for the transport of newspapers and parcels In philately, a cinderella stamp is \\"virtually anything resembling a postage stamp, but not issued for postal purposes by a government postal administration\\".Mackay, James. Philatelic Terms Illustrated. 4th edition. London: Stanley Gibbons, 2003, p.27. . The term excludes imprinted stamps on postal stationery.Carlton, R. Scott. The International Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Philately, Iola WI: Krause Publications, 1997, p.52. .  Etymology  Named after Cinderella, a folk-tale underdog heroine who was treated as inferior within her family. Cinderella stamps similarly were considered inferior to postage stamps.  Types  As cinderella stamps are defined by what they are not, there are many different types and the term is usually construed fairly loosely. Items normally regarded as falling within the area are poster stamps, propaganda labels, commemorative stickers, stamps issued by non-recognised countries or governments, charity labels like Christmas seals and Easter seals, most telegraph stamps, some railway stamps, some local stamps and purely decorative items created for advertising or amusement. Revenue stamps may be considered cinderellas, but as they are normally issued by an official government agency, they tend to be classified separately. Some telegraph, railway and other stamps may also be issued by government agencies but still fall under the cinderella umbrella since they are not for postal purposes. = Local stamps = Local stamps have a long history and began to be issued soon after the invention of the postage stamp. Zemstvo stamps were issued in rural areas of the Russian Empire (c. 1860-1917), and local stamps have been issued in many other countries. Many local stamps performed a genuine postal function where the national post was lacking. Other locals, however, amount to nothing more than colourful labels. In the United Kingdom many local carriage labels have been issued by offshore islands, which in some cases had a genuine use to pay for transport of the mail to the mainland by ferry. Others were produced simply to sell to collectors and tourists. Usually they had to be placed on the back of the envelope, with a conventional stamp on the front to pay for onward delivery by the official postal service. Islands for which such labels have been issued include the Summer Isles, Lundy and the Calf of Man. Hotel stamps may also be regarded as a form of local stamp. = Political and propaganda stamps = While it is common to find patriotic sentiments on official stamps, the term propaganda stamp is usually used to mean unofficial stamps produced to promote a particular ideology, or to create confusion within an enemy state. Stamps with encouraging slogans have been attached to letters for prisoners of war, or troops serving abroad. Sometimes stamps are issued by breakaway governments, governments in exile or micronations in order to give themselves greater legitimacy; however, these stamps usually have no postal validity and are therefore cinderella items.Carlton, R. Scott. p.100. The Indian National Army (Azad Hind) produced ten stamps as part of their campaign. From 1951 to 1966, UNESCO issued a series of 41 \\"gift stamps\\". Considered to be cinderellas, they were produced to raise money for the organization.UNESCO Gift Stamps. Retrieved 7 April 2009. The series is unusual in being an international cooperative effort. Most are readily available from specialized dealers. Illustrator and anarchist Clifford Harper, whose family had an occupational history in the postal service, designed stamps \\"for post- revolutionary post\\" bearing the image of anarchist figures such as Pierre- Joseph Proudhon (\\"property is theft\\"), Oscar Wilde, Emma Goldman and Emiliano Zapata. Colin Ward, along with Harper, published a book in 1997 called Stamps: Designs For Anarchist Postage Stamps, containing an essay by Ward on the subject of anarchists and postage stamps. Fund-raising stamps with anti-state messages have appeared within labor unions such as the ones printed by the Confederaci√≥n Nacional del Trabajo, and the Industrial Workers of the World. The Jewish National Fund had been publishing its own stamps since 1901, promoting the ideology of Zionism - see . = Non-official railway stamps = In the United Kingdom, the railway letter service, a special facility offered by most British railway companies since 1891, produced a great variety of stamps and labels, which were originally an official requirement of the service. Current officially licensed Heritage railway-operated services include the Festiniog Railway Letter Service. United Kingdom railway letter stamps almost always specify a fee (often, even in Victorian times, priced higher than the current postage fee, which additionally had to be paid with regular postage stamps) for the use of this official and once-important British postal facility.  Design  The design of cinderella items generally follows the principles of postage stamp design, but they may lack a country name, often replaced by the organization or cause being promoted, or a denomination. Sometimes a fictitious country or denomination may be present.  Collecting  While many cinderella stamps are common, others were privately produced in limited numbers, are little-known, and can be quite rare. Cinderella stamps are not normally listed in the main stamp-collecting catalogues; if they are, it is usually in a separate appendix within the publication, and so they are sometimes called back of the book stamps. Online catalogs include cinderella stamps and usually have them listed as one of the emission types. Revenue stamps are a recognised competitive category within the FIP (F√©d√©ration Internationale de Philat√©lie) and have their own commissioner, unlike other types of cinderella stamps. There are cinderella stamp clubs in the United Kingdom and in Australia, both of which accept members worldwide. Cinderella philately has a specific name in many countries. For example: Erinnophilie in France and Germany, Erinnofilia in Italy.  See also  * Artistamp * Illegal stamps * Cinderella Stamp Club  References   Further reading  * Brunstrom, Christer.

It is located in the northeast of the country. It has a population of 3,001,184 (2016 census), which includes the areas of Mashhad Taman and Torqabeh. It was a major oasis along the ancient Silk Road connecting with Merv to the east. The city is named after the shrine of Imam Reza, the eighth Shia Imam. The Imam was buried in a village in Khorasan, which afterward gained the name Mashhad, meaning the place of martyrdom. Every year, millions of pilgrims visit the Imam Reza shrine. The Abbasid caliph Harun al-Rashid is also buried within the same shrine. Mashhad has been governed by different ethnic groups over the course of its history. The city enjoyed relative prosperity in the Mongol period. Mashhad is also known colloquially as the city of Ferdowsi, after the Iranian poet who composed the Shahnameh. The city is the hometown of some of the most significant Iranian literary figures and artists, such as the poet Mehdi Akhavan-Sales, and Mohammad-Reza Shajarian, the traditional Iranian singer and composer. Ferdowsi and Akhavan-Sales are both buried in Tus, an ancient city that is considered to be the main origin of the current city of Mashhad. On 30 October 2009 (the anniversary of Imam Reza's martyrdom), Iran's then-President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad declared Mashhad to be \\"Iran's spiritual capital\\". History =Etymology and early history= The older name of Mashhad is Sanabad (ÿ≥ŸÜÿßÿ®ÿßÿØ). It was eventually renamed to Mashhad during the Safavid Empire. The name Mashhad comes from Arabic, meaning a martyrium.E.J. Brill's First Encyclopaedia of Islam 1913‚Äì1936 p. 127The Shias: A Short Gistory, Heinz Halm, p. 26 It is also known as the place where Ali ar-Ridha (Persian, Imam Reza), the eighth Imam of Shia Muslims, died (according to the Shias, was martyred). Reza's shrine was placed there. The ancient Parthian city of Patigraban√¢, mentioned in the Behistun inscription (520 BCE) of the Achaemenid Emperor Darius I, may have been located at the present-day Mashhad. At the beginning of the 9th century (3rd century AH), Mashhad was a small city called Sanabad, which was situated away from Tus. There was a summer palace of Humayd ibn Qahtaba, the governor of Khurasan. In 808, when Harun al-Rashid, Abbasid caliph, was passing through to quell the insurrection of Rafi ibn al-Layth in Transoxania, he became ill and died. He was buried under the palace of Humayd ibn Qahtaba. Thus the Dar al-Imarah was known as the Mausoleum of Haruniyyeh. In 818, Ali al-Ridha was martyred by al-Ma'mun and was buried beside the grave of Harun.Zabeth (1999) pp. 12‚Äì13. Although Mashhad owns the cultural heritage of Tus (including its figures like Nizam al-Mulk, Al-Ghazali, Ahmad Ghazali, Ferdowsi, Asadi Tusi, and Shaykh Tusi), earlier Arab geographers have correctly identified Mashhad and Tus as two separate cities that are now located about from each other. =Mongolian invasion: Ilkhanates= Although some believe that after this event, the city was called Mashhad al-Ridha (the place of martyrdom of al-Ridha), it seems that Mashhad, as a place-name, first appears in al-Maqdisi, i.e., in the last third of the 10th century. About the middle of the 14th century, the traveller Ibn Battuta uses the expression \\"town of Mashhad al-Rida\\". Towards the end of the Middle Ages, the name Nuqan, which is still found on coins in the first half of the 14th century under the Il-Khanids, seems to have been gradually replaced by al-Mashhad or Mashhad. Terken Khatun, Empress of the Khwarazmian Empire, known as \\"the Queen of the Turks\\", held captive by Mongol army.thumb Shias began to make pilgrimages to his grave. By the end of the 9th century, a dome was built above the grave, and many other buildings and bazaars sprang up around it. Over the course of more than a millennium, it has been destroyed and rebuilt several times.Zabeth (1999) pp. 13‚Äì16. In 1161, however, the Ghuzz Turks seized the city, but they spared the sacred area their pillaging. Mashad al-Ridha was not considered a \\"great\\" city until Mongol raids in 1220, which caused the destruction of many large cities in Khurasan but leaving Mashhad relatively intact in the hands of Mongolian commanders because of the cemetery of Ali Al-Rezza and Harun al- Rashid (the latter was stolen).ŸÖŸàÿ≥ŸàŸä 1370, p. 40 Thus the survivors of the massacres migrated to Mashhad.Zabeth (1999) pp. 14‚Äì15. When the traveller Ibn Battuta visited the town in 1333, he reported that it was a large town with abundant fruit trees, streams and mills. A great dome of elegant construction surmounts the noble mausoleum, the walls being decorated with colored tiles. The most well-known dish cooked in Mashhad, \\"sholeh Mashhadi\\" (ÿ¥ŸÑŸá ŸÖÿ¥ŸáÿØ€å) or \\"Sholeh\\", dates back to the era of the Mongolian invasion when it is thought to be cooked with any food available (the main ingredients are meat, grains and abundant spices) and be a Mongolian word. =Timurid Empire= The map of the Persian Empire in 1747 at the time of Afsharid Dynasty. The name of Mashhad is seen belong Tous It seems that the importance of Sanabad-Mashhad continually increased with the growing fame of its sanctuary and the decline of Tus, which received its death-blow in 1389 from Miran Shah, a son of Timur. When the Mongol noble who governed the place rebelled and attempted to make himself independent, Miran Shah was sent against him by his father. Tus was stormed after a siege of several months, sacked and left a heap of ruins; 10,000 inhabitants were massacred. Those who escaped the holocaust settled in the shelter of the 'Alid sanctuary. Tus was henceforth abandoned and Mashhad took its place as the capital of the district. Later on, during the reign of the Timurid Shahrukh Mirza, Mashhad became one of the main cities of the realm. In 1418, his wife Goharshad funded the construction of an outstanding mosque beside the shrine, which is known as the Goharshad Mosque. The mosque remains relatively intact to this date, its great size an indicator to the status the city held in the 15th century. =Safavid dynasty= Shah Ismail I, founder of the Safavid dynasty, conquered Mashhad after the death of Husayn Bayqarah and the decline of the Timurid dynasty. He was later captured by the Uzbeks during the reign of Shah Abbas I. In the 16th century the town suffered considerably from the repeated raids of the √ñzbegs (Uzbeks). In 1507, it was taken by the troops of the Shaybani or Shabani Khan. After two decades, Shah Tahmasp I succeeded in repelling the enemy from the town again in 1528. But in 1544, the √ñzbegs again succeeded in entering the town and plundering and murdering there. The year 1589 was a disastrous one for Mashhad. The Shaybanid 'Abd al-Mu'min after a four months' siege forced the town to surrender. Shah Abbas I, who lived in Mashhad from 1585 till his official ascent of the throne in Qazwin in 1587, was not able to retake Mashhad from the √ñzbegs till 1598. Mashhad was retaken by the Shah Abbas after a long and hard struggle, defeating the Uzbeks in a great battle near Herat as well as managing to drive them beyond the Oxus River. Shah Abbas I wanted to encourage Iranians to go to Mashhad for pilgrimage. He is said to have walked from Isfahan to Mashhad. During the Safavid era, Mashhad gained even more religious recognition, becoming the most important city of Greater Khorasan, as several madrasah and other structures were built beside the Imam Reza shrine. Besides its religious significance, Mashhad has played an important political role as well. The Safavid dynasty has been criticized in a book (Red Shi'sm vs. Black Shi'ism) on the perceived dual aspects of the Shi'a religion throughout history) as a period in which although the dynasty didn't form the idea of Black Shi'ism, but this idea was formed after the defeat of Shah Ismail against the Ottoman leader Sultan Yavuz Selim. Black Shi'ism is a product of the post-Safavid period. =Afsharid dynasty= Mashad saw its greatest glory under Nader Shah, ruler of Iran from 1736 to 1747, and also a great benefactor of the shrine of Imam Reza, who made the city his capital. Nearly the whole eastern part of the kingdom of Nadir Shah passed to foreign rulers in this period of Persian impotence under the rule of the vigorous Ahmad Shah Durrani of the Afghan Durrani Empire. Ahmad defeated the Persians and took Mashhad after an eight- month siege in 1753. Ahmad Shah and his successor Timur Shah left Shah Rukh in possession of Khurasan as their vassal, making Khurasan a kind of buffer state between them and Persia. As the city's real rulers, however, both these Durrani rulers struck coins in Mashhad. Otherwise, the reign of the blind Shah Rukh, which with repeated short interruptions lasted for nearly half a century, passed without any events of special note. It was only after the death of Timur Shah (1792) that Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar, the founder of the Qajar dynasty, succeeded in taking Shah Rukh's domains and putting him to death in 1795, thus ending the separation of Khurasan from the rest of Persia. =Qajar dynasty= Mashhad in 1858 Some believe that Mashhad was ruled by Shahrukh Afshar and remained the capital of the Afsharid dynasty during Zand dynastyŸÜŸàÿß€å€åÿå ÿπÿ®ÿØÿßŸÑÿ≠ÿ≥€åŸÜ. ⁄©ÿ±€åŸÖ ÿÆÿßŸÜ ÿ≤ŸÜÿØ until Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar conquered the then larger region of Khorasan in 1796. 1912 Imam Reza shrine bombardment In 1911 Yusuf Khan of Herat was declared independent in Mashhad as Muhammad Ali Shah and brought together a large group of reactionaries opposed to the revolution, and keep stirring for some time. This gave Russia the excuse to intervene and 29 March 1912 bombed the city; this bombing killed several people and pilgrims; action against a Muslim shrine caused a great shock to all Islamic countries. On 29 March 1912, the sanctuary of Imam Reza was bombed by the Russian artillery fire, causing some damage, including to the golden dome, resulting in a widespread and persisting resentment in the Shiite Muslim world as well as British India. This bombing was orchestrated by Prince Aristid Mikhailovich Dabizha (a Moldovan who was the Russian Consul in Mashhad) and General Radko (a Bulgarian who was commander of the Russian Cossacks in the city). Yusuf Khan ended up captured by the Persians and was executed. =Pahlavi dynasty= Modernization under Reza Shah The modern development of the city accelerated under the regime of Reza Shah (1925-1941). Shah Reza Hospital (currently Imam Reza Hospital, affiliated with the Basij organization) was founded in 1934; the sugar factory of Abkuh in 1935; and the Faculty of Medicine of Mashhad in 1939. The city's first power station was installed in 1936, and in 1939, the first urban transport service began with two buses. In this year the first population census was performed, with a result of 76,471 inhabitants. 1935 Imam Reza shrine rebellion In 1935, a backlash against the modernizing, anti-religious policies of Reza Shah erupted in the Mashhad shrine. Responding to a cleric who denounced the Shah's heretical innovations, corruption, and heavy consumer taxes, many bazaars and villagers took refuge in the shrine, chanted slogans such as \\"The Shah is a new Yazid.\\" For four days local police and army refused to violate the shrine and the standoff was ended when troops from Azerbaijan arrived and broke into the shrine,Ervand, History of Modern Iran, (2008), p.94 killing dozens and injuring hundreds, and marking a final rupture between Shi'ite clergy and the Shah.Bakhash, Shaul, Reign of the Ayatollahs: Iran and the Islamic Revolution by Shaul, Bakhash, Basic Books, 1984, p. 22. According to some Mashhadi historians, the Goharshad Mosque uprising, which took place in 1935, is an uprising against Reza Shah's decree banning all veils (headscarf and chador) on 8 January 1936. 1941‚Äì1979 reforms Comprehensive planning of Mashhad in 1974 Mashhad experienced population growth after the Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran in 1941 because of relative insecurity in rural areas, the 1948 drought, and the establishment of Mashhad University in 1949. At the same time, public transport vehicles increased to 77 buses and 200 taxis and the railway link with the capital, Tehran, was established in 1957. The 1956 census reflected a population of 241,989 people. The increase in population continued in the following years thanks to the increase in Iranian oil revenues, the decline of the feudal social model, the agrarian reform of 1963, the founding of the city's airport, the creation of new factories and the development of the health system. In 1966, the population reached 409,616 inhabitants, and 667,770 in 1976. The extension of the city was expanded from . In 1965 an important urban renewal development project for the surroundings of the shrine of Imam Reza was proposed by the Iranian architect and urban designer Dariush Borbor to replace the dilapidated slum conditions which surrounded the historic monuments. The project was officially approved in 1968. In 1977 the surrounding areas were demolished to make way for the implementation of this project. To relocate the demolished businesses, a new bazaar was designed and constructed in Meydan-e Ab square (in Persian, ŸÖ€åÿØÿßŸÜ ÿ¢ÿ®\\") by Dariush Borbor. After the revolution, the urban renewal project was abandoned. 1994 Imam Reza shrine bombing On 20 June 1994, a bomb exploded in a prayer hall of the shrine of the Imam Reza The bomb that killed at least 25 people on 20 June in Mashhad exploded on Ashura. The Baluch terrorist, Ramzi Yousef, a Sunni Muslim turned Wahhabi, one of the main perpetrators of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, was found to be behind the plot. However, official state media blamed Mehdi Nahvi, a supposed member of the People's Mujahedin of Iran (MKO), a fundamentally Marxist organization, to prevent sectarian violence. =Mashhad after the Revolution= In 1998 and 2003 there were student disturbances after the same events in Tehran. Geography The city is located at 36.20¬∫ North latitude and 59.35¬∫ East longitude, in the valley of the Kashafrud River near Turkmenistan, between the two mountain ranges of Binalood and Hezar Masjed Mountains.

Subscribers could install the proprietary modem and storage cartridge in their home game console, accessing the GameLine service to download games over a telephone line. GameLine had an exclusive selection of games, and its pioneering business model eventually gave rise to America Online. Despite being ahead of its time, it wasn't very popular, possibly due to its price of $60 for the hardware, $15 for the membership fee, and $1 per game, which you could only keep for a week. In 1983, cable pioneer William von Meister was looking for a way to use his modem transmission technology, which was previously acquired in ill-fated attempts of sending music to cable companies. Legal issues caused cable providers to step away from the service, leaving Von Meister with a delivery tool and no content. He then converted his variable speed adaptive modem technology to download games from central servers to individual households. This allowed users to dial a system and, for a fee, download games to their GameLine modules. The game would typically work for 5-10 plays, after which the user would have to connect to GameLine again and pay for another download. The \\"Master Module\\" has 8 KB of RAM and a 1,200 Bps modem, and physically resembles an oversized silver Atari cartridge. It has a phone jack on the side that was used to link the Master Module with the CVC computers. The module is able to transmit with pulse or tone dialing, allowing the unit to be versatile in the field. The games available on the GameLine service were all from third- party gamemakers, the largest of which was Imagic. CVC tried, but failed to obtain licensing agreements from the largest game makers, such as Atari, Activision, Coleco, Mattel, and Parker Brothers. Membership benefits When a user registered with the service, they were given a PIN. This PIN was used to log into the central CVC computer and download the requested games. One of the benefits of registering was that users were given free games on their birthday. GameLine provided players an opportunity to compete in contests with selected games, where they could upload a high score. Prizes would be awarded to regional (and supposedly national) champions. One such regional prize was a GameLine windbreaker. Each subscriber to GameLine also received a professionally printed magazine titled GameLiner. GameLiner consists of information about new games added to the service, questions and answers, advice on better gameplay, and a list of all currently available games on GameLine. Discontinuation GameLine was originally envisioned to not provide just games, but also news (NewsLine), stock quotes (StockLine), sports reporting and scores (SportLine), electronic mail (MailLine), online banking (BankLine), online forums (OpinionLine), and a wide variety of information including airline schedules, horoscopes, and classified ads (InfoLine). GameLine ceased operations before any of these expanded services were offered, though StockLine and SportsLine were reportedly near complete implementation. Control Video Corporation was one of many smaller companies that went bust in the video game crash of 1983. Legacy Even though the GameLine was discontinued, the investors and founding members of CVC went on to start a new company that would continue to use the technological infrastructure they had built. The company, named Quantum Computer Services, was created by Steve Case, among others. This company created a service named Quantum Link which linked together Commodore 64 and Commodore 128 users offering many of the expanded services originally envisioned for GameLine. Quantum Computer Services eventually became America Online in October 1991, which became extremely successful during the 1990s, and eventually took over Time Warner in 2001, but was spun off a few years later. Though the company still technically exists, support for the GameLine does not. The game titled Save The Whales was exclusive to the GameLine and although it was never released on a cartridge, a prototype was found in early 2002.

Eastern freshwater cod are closely related to the Murray cod of the Murray-Darling River system, and are considered an icon of the Clarence River system. A long-lived, slow- growing species, eastern freshwater cod are threatened by poaching [i.e. illegal take], habitat degradation, catastrophic natural events such as bushfires, and inbreeding from low genetic diversity. They are currently classified as endangered and protected by law from human exploitation of any kind. Range Eastern freshwater cod are native to the Clarence River system in northern New South Wales, Australia. The Clarence River system is an extensive East Coast drainage with many tributaries of differing size. By Australian standards, the Clarence River and its major tributaries the Mann and Nymboida Rivers are extremely large rivers with extremely large flow volumes. Eastern freshwater cod originally occurred in great abundance throughout the system, to significant altitudes. Though reportedly M. ikei were never found above the large falls in some headwaters, the uppermost reaches of many tributaries feature in this species' range. The indigenous cod population of the Richmond River system (Richmond River Cod), now extinct, are believed to have been a sub-population of eastern freshwater cod. The Richmond River has been restocked with fingerlings (juvenile fish) produced from Clarence River cod, but no evidence of breeding has been found. A closely related freshwater cod was historically common in the Brisbane River system, however the exact taxonomic status of the now-extinct Brisbane River Cod is not known. Appearance and size The eastern freshwater cod is a small to medium-sized grouper-like fish with a deep, elongated body that is round in cross section and a broad, scooped head, and a large mouth lined with pads of very small needle-like teeth. The jaws are equal, or the lower jaw may protrude slightly. The eyes are slightly larger and more prominent than in Murray cod. The spiny dorsal fin is moderate in height and is partially separated by a notch from the high, rounded soft dorsal fin. Soft dorsal, anal, and caudal (tail) fins are all large and rounded, and are dusky grey or black with distinct white edges. The large, rounded pectoral fins are usually similar in colour to flanks. The pelvic fins are large and angular, set forward of the pectoral fins, and are usually a translucent greyish-white colour, tending toward opacity in large fish. The leading greyish-white coloured rays on the pelvic fins split into two trailing filaments. These filaments are significantly longer than in Murray cod. Eastern freshwater cod are vary from cream or greyish-white to yellow on their ventral (‚Äúbelly‚Äù) surfaces. Their backs and flanks are usually an intense yellow or gold in colour, overlain with a dense pattern of black to very dark green mottling. The effect is a marbled appearance sometimes reminiscent of a leopard's markings. Colouration does vary considerably however and eastern freshwater cod from dark, heavily shaded habitats can be very dark or almost black in colour. Eastern freshwater cod were historically recorded reaching sizes well over 1 metre in length and up to 48 kg in weight, but today are commonly less than 60 cm in length and less than 5 kg in weight. Large fish are rare today. A small eastern freshwater cod that took a lure intended for Australian bass Origins Eastern freshwater cod are a species of cod that is descended from the Murray cod, Maccullochella peelii, present in tributaries of the Murray- Darling Basin on the western side of the Great Dividing Range. Murray cod entered an east coast river system, likely the Clarence, via a natural event somewhere between 0.62 and 1.62 million years ago (mean estimate 1.1 mya), as estimated by DNA divergence rates. Subsequent isolation from Murray cod populations, the founder effect, genetic drift, and natural selection lead to allopatric speciation. In addition to eastern freshwater cod of the Clarence River system, cod are/were to be found in several other coastal river systems. In total, at the time of European settlement of the Australia in the 18th century, naturally occurring cod were present and abundant in four East Coast river systems: * Clarence River system, northern New South Wales (eastern freshwater cod, Maccullochella ikei) * Richmond River system, northern New South Wales (Richmond River cod, Maccullochella ikei) * Brisbane River system and its Logan-Albert and Coomera River sub-systems, southern Queensland (Brisbane River cod, Maccullochella sp.) * Mary River system, central Queensland (Mary River cod, Maccullochella mariensis) Several genetic studies have found that eastern freshwater cod, in the southernmost of these four rivers, and Mary River cod, in the northernmost of these four rivers, are more closely related to each other than to Murray cod. This suggests that Murray cod only managed to cross into east coast river systems once. It is not clear which of the four river systems was the original entry point, but geomorphological evidence suggests the headwaters of the Clarence River. The mechanism by which Murray cod crossed the Great Dividing Range are considered to be either river capture, where the headwaters of an easterly-flowing coastal river cuts back (in the erosional sense) and intercepts and \\"captures\\" the headwaters (and fish fauna) of a previously westerly flowing stream, or a \\"wet divide\\", where extreme flooding or a very wet climatic phase created swamps in a topographic low point that effectively connected the headwaters of western flowing and eastern flowing streams. After crossing the Great Dividing Range, drops in sea level during glacial periods (ice ages) and/or \\"lateral\\" river capture events linked these four coastal rivers at times, allowing freshwater cod to gain access to these rivers and colonise them. The mean estimate for genetic separation of Mary River cod and eastern freshwater cod is only 300,000 years. DNA analysis reveals eastern freshwater cod of the Clarence River system went through one or more population bottlenecks before European settlement. This was likely due to a sequence of catastrophic drought, whole-of-catchment-scale bushfire and severe, widespread ash-induced fish kills, similar to those which occurred in 1936 (see below). Eastern freshwater cod numbers recovered from these pre-European bottleneck events, and the fish were abundant by the time of European settlement, but the species appears to have lost some genetic diversity. Further, very significant losses in genetic diversity occurred when European settlers caused catastrophic declines, and to a lesser extent by recent stockings of hatchery fish with low genetic diversity. Habitat and diet Eastern freshwater cod are found in clear-flowing rivers and streams with rocky beds and deep holes within the Clarence River system, to significant altitudes. They inhabit all sizes of rivers and streams. Eastern freshwater cod are territorial and aggressive. The bulk of their diet is based on crustaceans (the large, clawed Macrobrachium shrimp and the small, clawless Paratya shrimp) and other fish, but they are powerful opportunistic predators and are also known to take insects (e.g. cicadas), frogs, snakes, lizards, birds, and small mammals. Lifecycle Growth is highly variable in eastern freshwater cod, but overall is slower than in Murray cod. The oldest specimen yet aged was only 14 years old, but this likely reflects limited sampling and many decades of overfishing and poaching that have led to the loss of most large individuals. There is little doubt the species has the potential to reach or exceed the maximum age recorded in Murray cod (48 years). Eastern freshwater cod are sexually mature at 4 to 5 years old, and at sizes as small as 700 g, the latter being markedly smaller than in Murray cod. This appears to be an evolved adaptation to the rocky, low-nutrient, and often quite small waterways in which they found. The trout cod, a Maccullochella cod, once found in comparable habitats in the Murray-Darling system, displays a similar trait. Eastern freshwater cod spawn in early spring when water temperatures exceed 16 ¬∞C, using rock structures as sites for the adhesive eggs. Most other aspects of their spawning, including the guarding of eggs and newly hatched larvae by the male fish, are similar to Murray cod. The breeding season is 8‚Äì10 weeks long. Males clean and protect nesting sites until females enter and a complex spawning ritual is performed. The males then protect the eggs until hatching, and continue to defend the larvae for 12‚Äì14 days until they disperse. While specifically targeting this protected species is prohibited, it is also important for anglers to avoid any accidental captures of eastern freshwater cod in winter when they are developing their roe (eggs), or in early spring when spawning is occurring, as research indicates this results in resorbed roe or abandoned nests, respectively, and a failed spawning effort. (The eggs in abandoned nests are rapidly consumed by shrimp, turtles and small fish.) A total fishing closure is in effect on the Mann and Nymboida Rivers and their tributaries between August and October each year specifically to prevent this. Eastern freshwater cod habitat: Eastern freshwater cod often share such habitats with Australian bass. Conservation status Following heavy declines in numbers and distribution, the eastern freshwater cod is currently classified as endangered by the IUCN. =Population decline= Early records show that eastern freshwater cod were extremely abundant in the all parts of the Clarence River system at the time of European settlement. They were so abundant that they were caught \\"on demand\\" for diners at one riverside hotel, and were reportedly even used as pig feed, as were the related Mary River Cod. A number of factors have led to the decline of eastern freshwater cod. One factor was decades of pronounced overfishing, including with lines, nets, explosives, and spears. As a very slow-growing top predator with low fecundity, eastern freshwater cod are even more vulnerable to overfishing than Murray cod. Another factor were several huge bushfires (on the scale of the entire catchment) in the 1920s and 1930s, but particularly a bushfire in late 1936. These caused severe and widespread ash-induced fish kills in the first rainfall events post-fire. Habitat degradation and siltation brought on by poor farming practices (such as clearing riverbank vegetation and allowing stock to trample river banks) has also destroyed many eastern freshwater cod habitats. Some of these practices leading to land degradation are still continuing. =Mining pollution= Tin mining and dredging/sluicing for tin caused serious and widespread pollution of the Clarence River system in the late 19th century/early 20th century, with dozens of newspaper reports suggesting it reached its worst extent in the mid-late 1930s. These reports detail numerous pollution events characterised by milk-coloured stinking water, stained river rocks, cattle refusing to drink river water, and hundreds or thousands of dead fish per event. An article in The Daily Examiner from 11 October 1935 states that pollution was \\"causing alarm amongst fishermen, stockowners and people interested in preserving the Clarence and its tributaries as tourist attractions\\", and that farmers had trouble in getting their stock to drink from the polluted water. It includes statements from fishermen who describe fish \\"dead in thousands\\". This tin mining pollution caused many severe fish kills and was probably a key factor in the extirpation of eastern freshwater cod from large tracts of the Clarence River system in the 1930s. =Conservation actions= The above factors, which have in the past led to the extinction of the Richmond River cod and the Brisbane River cod and the endangerment of the Mary River cod, have reduced the eastern freshwater cod from an abundant fish found in all parts of the Clarence River system to an endangered fish absent from most parts of it. It survives only in limited, remote parts of the Nymboida/Mann and Guy Fawkes/Sara sections. The latter population is now at risk of severe inbreeding depression and is in need of \\"genetic rescue\\" via translocation of genetically differing fish from the former, more diverse population. Currently there are no management plans to undertake such translocations. Eastern freshwater cod were recognised as a potentially separate and endangered species of cod in 1984, and were declared a protected species in that year. Subsequent research confirmed this finding. While a high level of poaching is still taking place, legal protection has played a large role in finally allowing the species to commence a limited natural recovery. A restocking programme was undertaken by the government of New South Wales in 1984-1989, but was then closed and contracted to a private operation, which produced and stocked fingerlings until the late 1990s. The eastern freshwater cod stocking programme was suspended after genetic research indicated the fingerlings being produced had lower than desirable levels of genetic diversity. No eastern freshwater cod are currently being bred or stocked. Concern has been expressed over the future of eastern freshwater cod stocks in the Clarence River system after the NSW Fisheries department allowed a stocking of Australian bass fingerlings from a completely different bioregion to proceed. The fingerlings were contaminated with and introduced the Banded grunter (Amniataba percoides), an aggressive small native fish, to the lower reaches of the river. It is feared that banded grunter may yet invade the main freshwater reaches of the Clarence River system, with possibly devastating impacts on eastern freshwater cod. Species description and etymology The Eastern freshwater cod was first formally described in 1986 by Stuart J. Rowland with the type locality given as the confluence of the Nymboida River with the Mann River in New South Wales. Rowland gave it the specific name ikei in honour of his father Isaac \\"Ike\\" Morgan Rowland who was an angler and who enjoyed catching freshwater cod.

He has been called the \\"most influential creator of gay pornographic images\\" by cultural historian Joseph W. Slade.Slade, Joseph W.: Pornography and Sexual Representation: A Reference Guide, Volume 2. Pp. 545‚Äì546. Greenwood Publishing Group, 2001. Over the course of four decades, he produced some 3,500 illustrations, mostly featuring men with exaggerated primary and secondary sex traits, wearing tight or partially removed clothing. Early life Laaksonen was born on 8 May 1920 and raised by a middle-class family in Kaarina, a town in southwestern Finland, near the city of Turku.L√∂fstr√∂m, pp. 189. Both of his parents Suoma and Edwin Laaksonen were schoolteachers at the grammar school that served Kaarina. The family lived in the school building's attached living quarters.Hooven 1993, p. 3. He went to school in Turku and in 1939, at the age of 19, he moved to Helsinki to study advertising. In his spare time he also started drawing erotic images for his own pleasure, based on images of male laborers he had seen from an early age. At first he kept these drawings hidden, but then destroyed them \\"at least by the time I went to serve the army.\\"Arell & Mustola, p. 15. The country became embroiled in the Winter War with the USSR, and then became formally involved in World War II, and he was conscripted in February 1940 into the Finnish Army. He served as an anti-aircraft officer, holding the rank of second lieutenant. He later attributed his fetishistic interest in uniformed men to encounters with men in army uniform, especially soldiers of the German Wehrmacht serving in Finland at that time. \\"In my drawings I have no political statements to make, no ideology. I am thinking only about the picture itself. The whole Nazi philosophy, the racism and all that, is hateful to me, but of course I drew them anyway‚Äîthey had the sexiest uniforms!\\"Hooven 1993, p. 30. After the war, in 1945, he returned to studies. Laaksonen's artwork of this period compared to later works is considered more romantic and softer with \\"gentle-featured shapes and forms.\\" The men featured were middle class, as opposed to the sailors, bikers, lumberjacks, construction workers, and other members of stereotypically hypermasculine working class groups that feature in his later work. Another key difference is the lack of dramatic compositions, self-assertive poses, muscular bodies and \\"detached exotic settings\\" that his later work embodied. Career In 1956 Laaksonen submitted drawings to the influential American magazine Physique Pictorial, which premiered the images in the 1957 Spring issue under the pseudonym Tom, as it resembled his given name Touko. In the Winter issue later that year, editor Bob Mizer coined the credit Tom of Finland.Arell & Mustola, p. 31. This followed the naming conventions of the magazine. Other pseudonyms of the time were Bruce of Los Angeles and Spartan of Hollywood, for example. One of his pieces was featured on the Spring 1957 cover, depicting two log drivers at work with a third man watching them. Pulled from the Finnish mythology of lumberjacks representing strong masculinity, Laaksonen emphasized and privileged \\"homoerotic potentiality [...] relocating it in a gay context\\", a strategy repeated throughout his career. The post-World War II era saw the rise of the biker culture as rejecting \\"the reorganization and normalization of life after the war, with its conformist, settled lifestyle.\\"L√∂fstr√∂m, p. 190.Su√°rez, 1996, pp. 150. Biker subculture was both marginal and oppositional and provided postwar gay men with a stylized masculinity that included rebelliousness and danger. This was in contrast to the then-prevailing stereotypes of gay man as an effeminate sissy, as seen in vaudeville and films going back to the first years of the industry.The Celluloid Closet; Directors: Rob Epstein, Jeffrey Friedman (1996) UPC: 043396821071. Laaksonen was influenced by images of bikers as well as artwork of George Quaintance and Etienne, among others, that he cited as his precursors, \\"disseminated to gay readership through homoerotic physique magazines\\" starting in 1950.Hooven 1993, pp. 84‚Äì85. Laaksonen's drawings of bikers and leathermen capitalized on the leather and denim outfits which differentiated those men from mainstream culture and suggested they were untamed, physical, and self-empowered.Su√°rez, 1996, pp. 152, 158.L√∂fstr√∂m, pp. 190‚Äì1. This in contrast with the mainstream, medical and psychological sad and sensitive young gay man who is passive.Su√°rez, 1996, pp. 152, 158.; Dyer 1983 Laaksonen's drawings of this time \\"can be seen as consolidating an array of factors, styles and discourses already existing in the 1950s gay subcultures,\\" this may have led to them being widely distributed and popularized within those cultures.L√∂fstr√∂m, pp. 191. = U.S. censorship codes (1950s‚Äì1960s) = Cover of the Tom of Finland: Life and Work of a Gay Hero book. Laaksonen's style and content in the late 1950s and early 1960s was partly influenced by the U.S. censorship codes that restricted depiction of \\"overt homosexual acts\\". His work was published in the beefcake genre that began in the 1930s and predominantly featured photographs of attractive, muscular young men in athletic poses often shown demonstrating exercises.Beefcake (1999); Thom Fitzgerald, writer, director, co-producer; Shandi Mitchell, co-producer; Alliance Independent Films. Their primary market was gay men, but because of the conservative and homophobic social culture of the era, gay pornography was illegal and the publications were typically presented as dedicated to physical fitness and health. They were often the only connection that closeted men had to their sexuality. By this time, however, Laaksonen was rendering private commissions, so more explicit work was produced but remained unpublished. In the 1962 case of MANual Enterprises v. Day the United States Supreme Court ruled that nude male photographs were not inherently obscene.MANual Enterprises v. Day, 370 U.S. 478 in 1962; Barron, Jerome A. and Dienes, C. Thomas, First Amendment Law, St. Paul, Minn.: West Publishing Co., 1993, ; Streitmatter, Rodger and Watson, John C., \\"Herman Lynn Womack: Pornographer as First Amendment Pioneer,\\" Journalism History, 28:56 (Summer 2002). Softcore gay pornography magazines and films featuring fully nude models, some of them tumescent, quickly appeared and the pretense of being about exercise and fitness was dropped as controls on pornography were reduced.Waugh, Thomas: Hard to Imagine: Gay Male Eroticism in Photography and Film from Their Beginnings to Stonewall. New York: Columbia University Press, 1996. . By the end of the 1960s the market for beefcake magazines collapsed. Laaksonen was able to publish his more overtly homoerotic work and it changed the context with \\"new possibilities and conventions for displaying frontal male nudity in magazines and movies.\\" Laaksonen reacted by publishing more explicit drawings and stylized his figures' fantastical aspects with exaggerated physical aspects, particularly their genitals and muscles. In the late 1960s he developed Kake, a character appearing in an ongoing series of comics, which debuted in 1968. = Gay mainstream appeal (1970s‚Äì1991) = With the decriminalization of male nudity, gay pornography became more mainstream in gay cultures, and Laaksonen's work along with it. By 1973, he was publishing erotic comic books and making inroads to the mainstream art world with exhibitions. In 1973 he gave up his full-time job at the Helsinki office of McCann-Erickson, an international advertising firm. \\"Since then I've lived in jeans and lived on my drawings,\\" is how he described the lifestyle transition which occurred during this period. By the mid-1970s he was also emphasizing a photorealistic style, making aspects of the drawings appear more photographic. Many of his drawings are based on photographs, but none are exact reproductions of them.Ilppo Pohjola (author): Kari Paljakka and Alvaro Pardo (producers): Daddy and the Muscle Academy: Tom of Finland: United Kingdom: Oracle Home Entertainment: 2002. The photographic inspiration is used, on the one hand, to create lifelike, almost moving images, with convincing and active postures and gestures while Laaksonen exaggerates physical features and presents his ideal of masculine beauty and sexual allure, combining realism with fantasy. In Daddy and the Muscle Academy ‚Äì The Art, Life, and Times of Tom of Finland examples of photographs and the drawings based upon them are shown side by side. Although he considered the photographs to be merely reference tools for his drawings, contemporary art students have seen them as complete works of art that stand on their own.Hooven 2012, p. 134. Tom of Finland's room at the Tom of Finland Foundation's house in Los Angeles, 2002; photographed by Henning von Berg. In 1979, Laaksonen, with businessman and friend Durk Dehner, co-founded the Tom of Finland Company to preserve the copyright on his art, which had been widely pirated. In 1984 the Tom of Finland Foundation was established to collect, preserve, and exhibit homoerotic artwork.Prono, Luca: Encyclopedia of Gay and Lesbian Popular Culture. P. 258. Greenwood Publishing Group, 2008. Although Laaksonen was quite successful at this point, with his biography on the best-seller list, and Benedikt Taschen, the world's largest art book publisher reprinting and expanding a monograph of his works, he was most proud of the Foundation. The scope of the organization expanded to erotic works of all types, sponsored contests, exhibits, and started the groundwork for a museum of erotic art. = Death = Laaksonen was diagnosed with emphysema in 1988. Eventually the disease and medication caused his hands to tremble, leading him to switch mediums from pencil to pastels. He died in 1991 of an emphysema-induced stroke. Reception During his lifetime and beyond, Laaksonen's work has drawn both admiration and disdain from different quarters of the artistic community. Laaksonen developed a friendship with gay photographer Robert Mapplethorpe, whose work depicting sado-masochism and fetish iconography was also subject to controversy. A controversial theme in his drawings was the erotic treatment of men in Nazi uniforms. They form a small part of his overall work, but the typically flattering visual treatment of these characters has led some viewers to infer sympathy or affinity for Nazism, and they have been omitted from most recent anthologies of his work. Later in his career Laaksonen disavowed this work and was at pains to dissociate himself and his work from fascist or racist ideologies. He also depicted a significant number of black men in his drawings, with no overt racial or political message in the context in which they appear; although they bear some commonality with racist caricatures of the \\"hypersexual\\" black male, these traits are shared by Laaksonen's white characters as well. Art critics have mixed views about Laaksonen's work. His detailed drawing technique has led to him being described as a \\"master with a pencil\\", while in contrast a reviewer for Dutch newspaper Het Parool described his work as \\"illustrative but without expressivity\\".The Queer Encyclopedia Of The Visual Arts, Claude J. Summers, Cleis Press, 2004. There is considerable argument over whether his depiction of \\"supermen\\" (male characters with huge sexual organs and muscles) is facile and distasteful, or whether there is a deeper complexity in the work which plays with and subverts those stereotypes. For example, some critics have noted instances of apparent tenderness between traditionally tough, masculine characters, or playful smiles in sado-masochistic scenes. In either case, there remains a large constituency who admire the work on a purely utilitarian basis; as described by Rob Meijer, owner of a leathershop and art gallery in Amsterdam, \\"These works are not conversation pieces, they're masturbation pieces.\\" Writing for Artforum, Kevin Killian said that seeing Tom of Finland originals \\"produces a strong respect for his nimble, witty creation\\".\\"Bob Mizer and Tom of Finland\\", Kevin Killian, Artforum International Magazine, March 2014 Kate Wolf writes that \\"Tom of Finland helped pave the way to gay liberation\\".\\"Bob Mizer and Tom of Finland\\", Kate Wolf, Artforum International Magazine (Online), 21 November 2013 Cultural impact and legacy Cover of a video release of Daddy and the Muscle Academy: The Life and Art of Tom of Finland documentary. In the late 1980s, artist G. B. Jones began a series of drawings called the \\"Tom Girls\\" that appropriated Tom of Finland's drawings. The drawings were done in the style of Tom of Finland and based on his drawings, but featured punk girls or other subculturally identified women. However, unlike Tom's drawings, in Jones' work the authority figures exist only to be undermined, not obeyed. The two artists exhibited their work together in New York City in the early 1990s. In 1995, Tom of Finland Clothing Company introduced a fashion line based on his works, which covers a wide array of looks besides the typified cutoff-jeans-and-jacket style of his drawings. The fashion line balances the original homoeroticism of the drawings with mainstream fashion culture, and their runway shows occur in many of the venues during the same times as other fashion companies. In 2009, Laaksonen was inducted into the Leather Hall of Fame. Some of his original works are at the Leather Archives and Museum. =Exhibitions= New York's Museum of Modern Art has acquired several examples of Laaksonen's artwork for its permanent collection.Arell & Mustola, p. 187 In 2006, MoMA in New York accepted five Tom of Finland drawings as part of a much larger gift from The Judith Rothschild Foundation. The trustee of The Judith Rothschild Foundation, Harvey S. Shipley Miller, said, \\"Tom of Finland is one of the five most influential artists of the twentieth century. As an artist he was superb, as an influence he was transcendent.\\"Hooven 2012, p. 233. Hudson, of Feature Inc., New York, placed Tom of Finland's work in the collections of Rhode Island School of Design Museum of Art and Art Institute of Chicago. His work is also in the public Collections of: The Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA), Los Angeles, USA; W√§in√∂ Aaltonen Museum of Art; Turku, Finland; University of California Berkeley Art Museum, Berkeley (California), USA; Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Los Angeles, USA; Kiasma, Museum of Contemporary Art, Helsinki, Finland; San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, San Francisco, USA; and Tom of Finland Foundation, Los Angeles, USA. In 1999, an exhibition took place at the Institut Culturel Finlandais (Finnish Cultural Centre) in Paris. In 2011 there was a large retrospective exhibition of Laaksonen's artwork in Turku, Finland. The exhibition was one of the official events in Turku's European Capital of Culture programme. In 2012, Kulturhuset presented a retrospective, Tom of Finland, in Stockholm, Sweden; and Tom of Finland's work was in the Robert Rauschenberg Foundation's We the People in New York City, USA. In 2013, MOCA presented Bob Mizer & Tom of Finland in Los Angeles, USA. The artist's work was also seen in HAPPY BIRTHDAY Galerie Perrotin ‚Äì 25 years in Lille, France; Leslie Lohman Museum's Rare and Raw in New York City, USA; and the Institute of Contemporary Art‚Äôs Keep Your Timber Limber (Works on Paper) in London, England. In 2015, Artists Space presented the exhibition \\"Tom of Finland: The Pleasure of Play\\" in New York City, USA.Tom of Finland: The Pleasure of Play The exhibition was also presented in Kunsthalle Helsinki in 2016, complemented with additional material such as photos from family albums. In 2020, as part of the 100th birthday celebrations, \\"Tom of Finland: Love and Liberation\\" at London's House of Illustration showed 40 originals with ephemera emphasizing fashion as an aspect of his work. =Film= In 1991, Filmitakomo and Yleisradio produced a documentary film, Daddy and the Muscle Academy: The Life and Art of Tom of Finland, directed by Ilppo Pohjola. By the late 1980s, Laaksonen was well known in the gay world, but his \\"pneumatically muscled, meticulously rendered monster-donged icons of masculinity\\" received mainstream attention when the film ‚Äì which includes hundreds of images of his work along with interviews ‚Äì was released theatrically in Finland, won a Finnish Jussi Award in its category in 1992, and was shown at film festivals and film art houses worldwide.Hooven, F.

Sheila Johnston reports from the 46th Edinburgh International Film Festival Sheila Johnston, The Independent, 21 August 1992. While praising the artwork's quality one critic noted the film's lauding of Laaksonen as a gay pride icon while ignoring his work's \\"resemblance to both S & M pornography and Fascist art\\" which she tied to Laaksonen's early sexual experiences with German soldiers during World War II. Filmmaker Wes Hurley credits Tom of Finland as an influence in his work, including his short Peter and the Wolf and his cult comedy musical Waxie Moon in Fallen Jewel. Variety announced in 2013 that Finnish director Dome Karukoski was set to make a biopic of Laaksonen, entitled Tom of Finland. Helsinki-filmi produced it and secured exclusive rights. The film, released in February 2017 in Finland, is the first biopic of the artist.\\"Karukoski's English-Language Debut Will Be Tom of Finland's First Authorized Biopic\\". Elsa Keslassy. Variety 2013-09-13 =Stamps= In September 2014 the Finnish postal service, Itella Posti, published a set of three first class stamps featuring drawings by Laaksonen and in association with the stamps' release exhibited some of his correspondence at the Finnish Postal Museum. Two of the stamps include portions of an illustration of a nude man sitting between the legs of another man dressed as a police officer; the other depicts nude buttocks with a man's face included between the thighs. The stamp set exceeded Posti's expectations, with pre-orders from 178 countries, making it the best-selling stamp set in the service's history.

Construction and commissioning The contract for Richard B. Russells construction was awarded on 25 July 1969 and her keel was laid down 19 October 1971 by Newport News Shipbuilding at Newport News, Virginia, authenticated by Mrs. Ina Russell Stacey, sister and official hostess for Senator Russell. Richard B. Russell was launched at Newport News on 12 January 1974, sponsored by Mrs. Leila Elizabeth (Betty) Talmadge (n√©e Shingler), wife of Herman E. Talmadge (1913‚Äì2002), U.S. Senator from Georgia (1957‚Äì1981), and commissioned on 16 August 1975. Service history In August 1977, Richard B. Russell was fitted with a large housing attached to her hull just aft of her sail, containing a tethered antenna buoy that was under development. The housing, called a \\"bustle\\" (and particularly the \\"Russell bustle\\"), gave her a unique profile and her nickname became \\"Dickey \\"B\\".\\" Later submarine classes would have their antenna buoy housings built into their hull fairings. One point of interest about the fitting of the bustle came about as it was being installed. A crane was used to lift the bustle for the installation process. The crane used had insufficient capacity to lift the bustle. The bustle went into the water, and the crane was pulled onto its side. Two people were pinned under the crane until another barge-mounted crane was brought in to lift the bustle from the water, and right the other crane. In 1978, Richard B. Russell completed a three-month deployment in the North Atlantic Ocean for which she received a Navy Unit Commendation and an Expeditionary Medal. In 1980, Richard B. Russell completed a five-month deployment in the Mediterranean Sea. In 1981 she completed a deployment in the North Atlantic Ocean for which she received a Meritorious Unit Commendation and an Expeditionary Medal. The Richard B. Russell was used in covert operations, gathering intelligence on Soviet naval movements. In 1982, Richard B. Russell went through the Panama Canal and arrived at Mare Island Naval Shipyard in Vallejo, California, for an extended overhaul. During her time at Mare Island, it was decided that she would become a special projects submarine. After a short period of post-overhaul testing and sea trials, she underwent extensive ocean engineering modifications prior to commencing operations as a unit of Submarine Development Group 1. As a member of Sub Dev Group 1, she spearheaded a testing program for submarine rescue technology. Richard B. Russells role as a fast attack submarine as well as a development and testing platform earned her the Presidential Unit Citation, the highest award any naval unit can be given. She also earned six Navy Unit Commendations, and seven Battle Effectiveness Awards (formerly the Battle Efficiency Award), commonly known as the Battle \\"E\\", during her career. Richard B. Russell was placed in reserve while still in commission on 1 July 1993. Decommissioning and disposal Richard B. Russell was both decommissioned and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 24 June 1994. She was stored at Bremerton, Washington, until 1 October 2001, when she entered the Nuclear-Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton for scrapping. Her scrapping was completed on 3 January 2003. References *This article includes awards information from the \\"official website\\" for the USS Richard B. Russell (SSN687).

Tjader played the vibraphone primarily, but was accomplished on the drums, bongos, congas, timpani, and the piano. He worked with many musicians from several cultures.

His Grammy award in 1980 for his album La Onda Va Bien capped off a career that spanned over forty years. Early years (1925-1943) Callen Radcliffe Tjader, Jr. was born 16 July 1925 in St. Louis, Missouri, to touring Swedish American vaudevillians. His father tap danced and his mother played piano, a husband-wife team going from city to city with their troupe to earn a living. When he was two, Tjader's parents settled in San Mateo, California, and opened a dance studio. His mother (who dreamed of becoming a concert pianist) instructed him in classical piano and his father taught him to tap dance. He performed around the Bay Area as \\"Tjader Junior,\\" a tap-dancing wunderkind. He performed a brief non-speaking role dancing alongside Bill \\"Bojangles\\" Robinson in the film The White of the Dark Cloud of Joy. He joined a Dixieland band and played around the Bay Area. At age sixteen, he entered a Gene Krupa drum solo contest, making it to the finals and ultimately winning by playing \\"Drum Boogie.\\" The win was overshadowed by that morning's event: Japanese planes had bombed Pearl Harbor. Navy and college (1940s) Tjader entered the United States Navy in 1943 at age 17 and served as a medical corpsman in the Pacific Theater until March 1946. He saw action in five invasions, including the Marianas campaign and the Battle of the Philippines. Upon his return he enrolled at San Jose State College under the G.I. Bill, majoring in education. Later he transferred to San Francisco State College, still intending to teach. It was there he took timpani lessons, his only formal music training. At San Francisco State he met Dave Brubeck, a young pianist also fresh from a stint in the Army. Brubeck introduced Tjader to Paul Desmond. The three connected with more players and formed the Dave Brubeck Octet with Tjader on drums. Although the group recorded only one album (and had an abysmal time finding work), the recording is regarded as important due to its early glimpse at these soon-to-be-legendary jazz greats. After the octet disbanded, Tjader and Brubeck formed a trio, performing jazz standards in the hope of finding more work. The Dave Brubeck Trio succeeded and became a fixture in the San Francisco jazz scene. Tjader taught himself the vibraphone during this period, alternating between it and the drums depending on the song. Sideman (1951-1954) Brubeck suffered major injuries in a diving accident in 1951 in Hawaii and the trio was forced to dissolve. Tjader continued the trio work in California with bassist Jack Weeks from Brubeck's trio and pianists John Marabuto or Vince Guaraldi, recording his first 10\\" LP as a leader with them for Fantasy, but soon worked with Alvino Rey and completed his degree at San Francisco State. Jazz pianist George Shearing recruited Tjader in 1953 when Joe Roland left his group. Al McKibbon was a member of Shearing's band at the time and he and Tjader encouraged Shearing to add Cuban percussionists. Tjader played bongos as well as the vibes: \\"Drum Trouble\\" was his bongo solo feature. Down Beat's 1953 Critics Poll nominated him as best New Star on the vibes. His next 10\\" LP as a leader was recorded for Savoy during that time, as well as his first Latin Jazz for a Fantasy 10\\" LP. While in New York City, bassist Al McKibbon took Tjader to see the Afro-Cuban big bands led by Machito and Chico O'Farrill, both at the forefront of the nascent Latin jazz sound. In New York he met Mongo Santamar√≠a and Willie Bobo who were members of Tito Puente's orchestra at the time. Leader (1954-1962) Tjader soon quit Shearing after a gig at the San Francisco jazz club the Blackhawk. In April 1954, he formed the Cal Tjader Modern Mambo Quintet. The members were brothers Manuel Duran and Carlos Duran on piano and bass respectively, Benny Velarde on timbales, bongos, and congas, and Edgard Rosales on congas (Luis Miranda replaced Rosales after the first year). Back in San Francisco and recording for Fantasy Records, the group produced several albums in rapid succession, including Mambo with Tjader. The Mambo craze reached its pitch in the late 1950s, a boon to Tjader's career. Unlike the exotica of Martin Denny and Les Baxter, music billed as \\"impressions of\\" Oceania (and other locales), Tjader's bands featured seasoned Cuban players and top-notch jazz talent conversant in both idioms. He cut several notable straight-ahead jazz albums for Fantasy using various group names, most notably the Cal Tjader Quartet (composed of bassist Gene Wright, drummer Al Torre, and pianist Vince Guaraldi). Tjader is sometimes lumped in as part of the West Coast (or \\"cool\\") jazz sound, although his rhythms and tempos (both Latin and bebop) had little in common with the work of Los Angeles jazzmen Gerry Mulligan, Chet Baker, or Art Pepper. Tjader and his band opened the second Monterey Jazz Festival in 1959 with an acclaimed \\"preview\\" concert. The first festival had suffered financially. Tjader is credited with bringing in big ticket sales for the second and saving the landmark festival before it had even really started. The Modern Mambo Quintet disbanded within a couple of years. Tjader formed several more small- combo bands, playing regularly at such San Francisco jazz clubs as the Blackhawk.Cotterrell, Roger. ‚ÄòCal Tjader: Between Two Worlds‚Äô Jazz & Blues July 1972. Verve and Skye Records (1960s) After recording for Fantasy for nearly a decade, Tjader signed with better-known Verve Records, founded by Norman Granz but owned then by MGM. With the luxury of larger budgets and seasoned recording producer Creed Taylor in the control booth, Tjader cut a varied string of albums. During the Verve years Tjader worked with arrangers Oliver Nelson, Claus Ogerman, Eddie Palmieri, Lalo Schifrin, Don Sebesky, and performers Willie Bobo, Donald Byrd, Clare Fischer, a young Chick Corea, Jimmy Heath, Kenny Burrell, Hank Jones, Anita O'Day, Armando Peraza, Jerome Richardson and others. Tjader recorded with big band orchestras for the first time, and even made an album based on Asian scales and rhythms. His biggest success was the album Soul Sauce (1964). Its title track, a Dizzy Gillespie cover Tjader had been toying with for over a decade, was a radio hit (hitting the top 20 on New York's influential pop music station WMCA in May 1965), and landed the album on Billboard's Top 50 Albums of 1965. Titled \\"Guachi Guaro\\" (a nonsensical phrase in Spanish), Tjader transformed the Gillespie/Chano Pozo composition into something new. (The name \\"Soul Sauce\\" came from Taylor's suggestion for a catchier title and Willie Bobo‚Äôs observation that Tjader's version was spicier than the original.) The song's identifiable sound is a combination of the call-outs made by Bobo (\\"Salsa ahi na ma ... sabor, sabor!\\") and Tjader's crisp vibes work. The album sold over 100,000 copies and popularized the word salsa in describing Latin dance music. The 1960s were Tjader's most prolific period. With the backing of a major record label, Verve, he could afford to stretch out and expand his repertoire. The most obvious deviation from his Latin jazz sound was Several Shades of Jade (1963) and the follow-up Breeze From the East (1963). Both albums attempted to combine jazz and Asian music, much as Tjader and others had done with Afro- Cuban. The result was dismissed by the critics, chided as little more than the dated exotica that had come and gone in the prior decade. Other experiments were not so easily dismissed. Tjader teamed up with New Yorker Eddie Palmieri in 1966 to produce El Sonido Nuevo (\\"The New Sound\\"). A companion LP was recorded for Palmieri's contract label, Tico, titled Bamboleate. While Tjader's prior work was often dismissed as \\"Latin lounge\\", here the duo created a darker, more sinister sound. Cal Tjader Plays The Contemporary Music Of Mexico And Brazil (1962), released during the bossa nova craze, actually bucked the trend, instead using more traditional arrangements from the two countries' past. In the late 1960s Tjader, along with guitarist G√°bor Szab√≥ and Gary McFarland, helped to found the short-lived Skye record label. Tjader's work of this period is characterized by Solar Heat (1968) and Tjader Plugs In (1969), precursors to acid jazz. Fusion years (1970s) During the 1970s Tjader returned to Fantasy Records, the label he began with in 1954. Embracing the jazz fusion sound that was becoming its own subgenre at the time, he added electronic instruments to his lineup and began to employ rock beats behind his arrangements. His most notable album during this period is Amazonas (1975) (produced by Brazilian percussionist Airto Moreira). He played on the soundtrack to the 1972 animated film Fritz the Cat, most notably on the track entitled \\"Mamblues\\". In 1976, Tjader recorded several live shows performed at Grace Cathedral, San Francisco. Like the Monterey Jazz Festival show, he played a mix of jazz standards and Latin arrangements. Later he toured Japan with saxophonist Art Pepper, the latter recovering from alcohol and drug dependencies. Final years (1979 to 1982) Carl Jefferson, president of Concord Records, created a subsidiary label called Concord Picante to promote and distribute Tjader's work. Unlike his excursions in the 1960s and his jazz-rock attempts in the 1970s, Tjader's Concord Picante work was largely straight-ahead Latin jazz. Electronic instruments and rock backbeats were dropped, reverting to a more \\"classic\\" sound. During the prior decade he'd built up a top-notch crew of young musicians, his best lineup since his Modern Mambo Quintet of the 1950s, with Mark Levine on piano, Roger Glenn on flute, Vince Lateano on drums, Robb Fisher on the bass, and Poncho Sanchez on the congas. Tjader cut five albums for Concord Picante, the most successful being La Onda Va Bien (1979) (roughly \\"The Good Life\\"), produced by Carl Jefferson and Frank Dorritie, which earned a Grammy award in 1980 for Best Latin Recording. The A section of Tjader's \\"Sabor\\" is a 2-3 onbeat/offbeat guajeo, minus some notes. A section of \\"Sabor\\" by Jo√£o Donato, as arranged by Mark Levine, and performed by Cal Tjader. Tjader died on tour. On the road with his band in Manila, he collapsed from a heart attack and died on 5 May 1982, aged 56. Tjader's legacy is associated with that of G√°bor Szab√≥ and Gary McFarland, who worked and founded Skye Records together (the PANDORA archive spells Szab√≥ without the acute accent). The American hip-hop band A Tribe Called Quest sampled songs from Cal's \\"Aquarius\\" as an outro to most of the songs on the album Midnight Marauders. According to WhoSampled.com, over 80 tracks have sampled Cal Tjader.

The name derives from the Afrikaans word for a \\"mountain pass\\" but the terrain itself was a perfect bottleneck and easy to defend, as had been proven during an Ottoman attack in June. It connected Australian and New Zealand trenches on the ridge known as \\"Russell's Top\\" to the knoll called \\"Baby 700\\" on which the Ottoman defenders were entrenched. The campaign on the Gallipoli Peninsula had begun in April 1915, but over the following months had developed into a stalemate. In an effort to break the deadlock, the British and their allies launched an offensive to capture the Sari Bair range. As part of this effort, a feint attack by Australian troops was planned at the Nek to support New Zealand troops assaulting Chunuk Bair. Early on 7 August 1915, two regiments of the Australian 3rd Light Horse Brigade, one of the formations under the command of Major General Alexander Godley for the offensive, mounted a futile bayonet attack on the Ottoman trenches on Baby 700. Due to poor co-ordination and inflexible decision making, the Australians suffered heavy casualties for no gain. A total of 600 Australians took part in the assault, assaulting in four waves; 372 were killed or wounded. Ottoman casualties were negligible.  Prelude  =Geography= A narrow saddle, the Nek connected the Australian and New Zealand trenches on Walker's Ridge at a plateau designated as \\"Russell's Top\\" (known as Yuksek Sirt to the Ottomans) to the knoll called \\"Baby 700\\" (Kilic Bayir), on which the Ottoman defenders were entrenched in what the historian Chris Coulthard-Clark describes as \\"the strongest position at Anzac\\". The immediate area was known to the British and Empire troops as the Anzac sector, and the allied landing site was dubbed Anzac Cove, after the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps. The Nek was between wide; on each side, the ground sloped steeply down to deep valleys below. These valleys were Monash Valley to the south and Malone's Gulley to the north. Anzac beachhead plateaus and ridges The name given to the feature by Australian troops ‚Äì the Nek ‚Äì derives from the Afrikaans word for \\"mountain pass\\" and according to Glenn Wahlert was \\"likely coined by veterans of the South African war\\". The Turkish name for the Nek was Cesarettepe. It was well suited to defence, with no vegetation, and providing the defenders good observation and fields of fire along a narrow frontage. The ground was bare and covered in pot-holes, and on a slight slope. The difficult nature of the terrain had been highlighted earlier in the campaign, initially when a battalion of the Turkish 57th Regiment had suffered heavy casualties during a failed counter-attack in April. After the 19 May Ottoman counter-attack, Major-General Alexander Godley had ordered an attack by the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade across the Nek, but Brigadier General Andrew Russell (after whom Russell's Top was named) had convinced him to abandon this over concerns of the commanders of both the Wellington and Auckland Mounted Rifles Regiments. Another unsuccessful attack resulting in heavy casualties had been made by the Turkish 18th Regiment across the Nek on the night of 30 June. Despite these incidents, the challenges of attacking the Nek were not fully appreciated by Allied commanders when formulating the plan for the August Offensive. The Australian line at Russell's Top lay just below the Nek and extended . The right of the line lay opposite the Ottoman position across flat ground; it was described by Les Carlyon as a \\"conventional trench\\" and was deep enough that wooden hand and footholds had been attached to the wall of the trench to enable the assaulting troops to climb out. On the left of the Australian line, the line sloped away into dead ground where the Australians had established what Carlyon describes as a \\"ditch without a parapet\\" that was obscured from view with vegetation and earth. The Ottoman front line at the Nek consisted of two lines of trenches, with machine guns positioned on the flanks on spur lines, which provided clear fields of fire into no man's land in front of the Ottoman position. Behind this another eight trenches existed, tiered along the slopes towards Baby 700. At least five groups of machine guns ‚Äì approximately 30 altogether ‚Äì were located in the area, providing direct fire support to the Ottoman troops holding the Nek. These positions were widely dispersed and positioned in depth, at least from the Ottoman front line. The commanders of the two Ottoman regiments occupying positions around the Nek had chosen not to cover their trenches, despite orders from their divisional headquarters, due to concerns that a bombardment would collapse the roofs and block communication through the trenches, similar to what had occurred at Lone Pine. =Strategic situation and planning= For the three months since the 25 April landings, the Anzac beachhead had been a stalemate. On 19 May, Ottoman troops had attempted to break the deadlock with a counter-attack on Anzac Cove, but had suffered heavy casualties. In August, an Allied offensive (which later became known as the Battle of Sari Bair) was intended to break the deadlock by capturing the high ground of the Sari Bair range, and linking the Anzac front with a new landing to the north at Suvla. Along with the main advance north out of the Anzac perimeter, supporting attacks were planned from the existing trench positions. Higher-level conceptual planning for the offensive was undertaken by the commander of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps, Lieutenant General William Birdwood, and Colonel Andrew Skeen; more detailed tactical planning devolved to other staff. Tactical command of the offensive to secure Sari Bair was given to Godley, who was at the time in command of the New Zealand and Australian Division. Map of the planned August offensive, 6‚Äì8 August As part of the effort to secure Baby 700, Godley, assisted by Birdwood, planned a breakthrough from the Nek. The official Australian historian Charles Bean writes that concerns about \\"attacking unaided\\" meant that plans were made to co-ordinate the attack with other actions. The attack at the Nek was meant to coincide with an attack by New Zealand troops from Chunuk Bair, which was to be captured during the night. The light horsemen were to attack across the Nek to Baby 700 while the New Zealanders descended from the rear from Chunuk Bair onto Battleship Hill, the next knoll above Baby 700. Other attacks were to be made by the 1st Light Horse Brigade at Pope's Hill and the 2nd Light Horse Brigade at Quinn's Post. The 3rd Light Horse Brigade was chosen for the attack at the Nek. This formation was commanded by Colonel Frederic Hughes, and consisted of the 8th, 9th and 10th Light Horse Regiments. For the attack, the 8th and 10th would provide the assault troops, while the 9th was placed in reserve. Some of its machine guns, positioned on Turk's Point, about from the Nek, would provide direct fire support during the attack. Like the other Australian Light Horse and the New Zealand Mounted Rifles formations, the 3rd Light Horse Brigade had been dispatched to Gallipoli in May as infantry reinforcements, leaving their horses in Egypt. The area around the Nek was held by the 18th Regiment, under the command of Major Mustafa Bey. The regiment formed part of Mustafa Kemal's Ottoman 19th Division. The 27th Regiment, under Lieutenant Colonel Sefik Bey, also held part of the line south from the Nek to Quinn's Post (Bomba Sirt). Godley's orders for the attack stipulated that the attack would be made with bayonets and grenades only; rifles would be unloaded. This was, according to Roland Perry, designed to \\"influence the troopers to keep running at the [Ottoman] trenches\\" and ultimately meant they could not stop and fire. The envisaged four waves of troops attacking from Russell's Top across the Nek. The first wave would use the cover of a naval bombardment to approach the trenches silently and quickly while the defenders were dazed, and would capture the trench with bayonets and grenades. The second wave would then pass through the first to capture trenches on the lower slopes of Baby 700. The third and fourth waves would exploit further and would dig-in, with ultimate goal of securing the heights away on Baby 700. The British 8th Battalion, Cheshire Regiment, was to consolidate positions on the Nek afterwards, while two companies from the 8th Battalion, Royal Welch Fusiliers would advance up the western part of Monash Valley and carry out an attack around the \\"Chessboard\\" ‚Äì to the south of the Nek ‚Äì to cover the southern flank of the Australians on the Nek. Preparations for the attack began several days earlier when the troopers were ordered to stow unnecessary clothing, including woollen tunics, and equipment. This resulted in the men living in the trenches for several cold nights in just shirts and short pants. Each man was authorised to carry 200 rounds of ammunition, as well as a small amount of personal rations. Assault equipment included wire cutters, empty sandbags, ladders, and periscopes; only the fourth and final assault line would carry entrenching tools. The light horsemen had not participated in a large-scale attack before; they had not been trained to fight like infantrymen, having been recruited to fight in a mounted role, but they were all keen and eager for the attack to commence. Encouraged by earlier efforts by compatriots at Lone Pine, the troops were spurred on by the Brigade Major, Lieutenant Colonel John Antill, a Boer War veteran who encouraged them with stories from that war. Many soldiers who had been injured or ill, and were in hospital, ensured they were released and returned to their units in time to take part. In this climate, nobody questioned the tactics of the plan, contingencies, or the efficacy of attacking without loaded weapons. Prior to the assault, each man was given a double issue of rum to warm up.  Battle  The attack was scheduled to commence at 04:30 on 7 August. It was to be preceded by a naval bombardment, supported by field guns from several shore based batteries. The 8th and 10th Light Horse Regiments assembled in a trench about long, opposite the Ottoman line that was between away. Coloured marker flags were carried, to be shown from the captured trenches to indicate success. To help the supporting artillery to identify the attacking Australian troops, the attackers attached white armbands and patches to their shirts. On the morning of 7 August, it was clear that the prerequisites for the attack had not been met. The initial concept of operations for the August offensive required a simultaneous attack from the rear of Baby 700, thereby creating a hammer and anvil effect on the Ottoman trenches caught in between this pincer movement. Because the New Zealand advance on Chunuk Bair had been held up and failed to reach Chunuk Bair, the troops assaulting the Nek would have to do so alone if the attack was to continue. The New Zealanders had made some progress, though, having captured the lower part of Rhododendron Spur and it was hoped that Chunuk Bair could still be carried; as a result, Birdwood and Skeen decided it was important for the attack on the Nek to proceed as a feint ‚Äì rather than a pincer ‚Äì to assist the New Zealanders at Chunuk Bair, while the Australians and Indians from other formations also attacked Hill 971. British troops were also landing at Suvla Bay, having commenced their operation the night before (6 August). View of the Nek from the south, 1919 A further part of the plan required an attack from Steele's Post through several tunnels against German Officers' Trench by the Lieutenant Colonel Gordon Bennett's 6th Battalion (2nd Infantry Brigade of the Australian 1st Division). The Ottoman machine guns sited there enfiladed the ground in front of Quinn's Post and the Nek and the 6th Battalion's attack was conceived as a preliminary supporting move to suppress Ottoman fire onto the Nek to assist the 3rd Light Horse Brigade's. Planners had requested that this attack be conducted simultaneously with the attack at the Nek, but Birdwood had decided it should be conducted prior. The failure of this attack meant that Ottoman machine guns supporting the 18th Regiment around the Nek remained intact. Nonetheless, Birdwood declared that the 3rd Light Horse Brigade's attack was to proceed, albeit with some modifications. This would see the Australian light horsemen become the right flank of the assault on Chunuk Bair, linking in with the New Zealand Infantry Brigade on Rhododendron Spur. Following the decision to proceed, at 04:00 field artillery and howitzers began firing from the beachhead around Anzac Cove onto the Ottoman trenches around the Nek. These guns were then joined by several warships, including a destroyer, which opened fire on the Nek and other positions around Baby 700. This continued at a steady and deliberate rate until 04:27, when the intensity rose. Due to the proximity of the two sides' trenches, the shells mostly landed behind the first line of Ottoman trenches. Bean describes the bombardment as the heaviest since 2 May; but Carlyon notes that no battleships were assigned to the shelling due to the proximity of the Australian trenches, and describes it as \\"'desultory' and a 'joke'\\", citing an officer from the 9th Light Horse Regiment, who were in reserve for the attack. Owing to a failure to co-ordinate timings, the field artillery preparation of the forward positions ceased at 04:23, although the naval guns continued to engage some of the depth targets. While the original plan had been for the attack to begin as soon as the artillery had stopped, local commanders did not adjust their plans following the early cutoff of preparatory fires and the attack was not launched until the appointed time of 04:30. After the artillery firing ceased, no-one in the assaulting force knew if the bombardment was to continue. It was later discovered that the synchronisation of watches between the artillery officer and the assault officer was overlooked. As the attack was not launched as soon as the bombardment ceased, but instead held back until the planned time of 04:30, the Ottoman defenders had ample time to return to their trenches ‚Äì which were largely undamaged ‚Äì and prepare for the assault that they now knew was coming. The first wave of 150 men from the 8th Light Horse Regiment, led by their commander, Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Henry White, \\"hopped the bags\\" and went over the top. They were met with a hail of machine gun and rifle fire and, within 30 seconds, White and all of his men were gunned down. A few men reached the Ottoman trenches, where they began to hurl grenades and marker flags were reportedly seen flying around the south-eastern corner of the Ottoman trench line, but the men were quickly overwhelmed by the Ottoman defenders. View from Turkish trenches on the Nek towards former Australian positions, 1919 At this stage, the futility of the effort became clear to those in the second wave and, according to Carlyon, the attack should have been called off at this point. The second wave of 150 followed the first without question two minutes later and met the same fate, almost all the men being cut down by heavy rifle and machine gun fire before they got halfway to the Ottoman trench. This contrasted with the simultaneous attack by the 2nd Light Horse Regiment (1st Light Horse Brigade) at Quinn's Post, against the Ottoman trench system known as \\"The Chessboard\\", which was abandoned after 49 out of the 50 men in the first wave became casualties. In this case, the regiment's commander had not gone in the first wave and so was able to make the decision to cancel further attacks. As the third wave, consisting of men from the 10th Light Horse Regiment, began assembling in the forward trench, two Ottoman field artillery pieces began firing into no man's land. Lieutenant Colonel Noel Brazier, commander of the 10th Light Horse Regiment, attempted to have the third wave cancelled. He was unable to find Hughes ‚Äì who had moved to an observation post ‚Äì and instead found Antill. A strong personality, Antill exerted a large amount of influence within Hughes' command, and had a personal dislike of Brazier, who he felt was being insubordinate in questioning orders. Antill had received the reports that marker flags, implying success, had been sighted. This report of marker flags was subsequently confirmed in a Turkish article published after the war, where it was stated by the commander of the Turkish 27th Regiment that a couple of men with a marker flag reached the Ottoman trench and raised the flag, but were killed. Antill had not checked the scene to establish if it was of any use to send the next wave, nor did he confirm if the marker flags were still in place, and after heated words with Brazier issued the order for the third wave to proceed without referring the matter to Hughes. Without being able to speak to Godley, who was at his headquarters on the beach, Brazier returned to the forward Australian position at Russell's Top and gave the order for the third wave to attack, telling them \\"Sorry, lads, but the order is to go\\". Soldiers from the 10th Light Horse Regiment with unclaimed kitbags of the dead after the charge at the Nek The assault by the third wave was launched at 04:45, and came to a quick end as before. Brazier made another attempt to reason with Antill, as did the 10th Light Horse Regiment's second-in-command, Major Allan Love. Again Antill ordered the men forward. This time, Brazier conferred with several majors and then went forward to find Hughes, who called off the attack. Meanwhile, the troops assigned to the fourth wave assembled on the fire-step of the forward Australian trench; amidst much confusion the right hand side of the line charged before Hughes' order could reach them. The troops on the left followed them shortly afterwards, but according to Bean many of them adopted a more cautious approach, \\"keeping low and not running\\". Briefly, Hughes entertained detaching a force via Monash Valley to support the British attack towards the \\"Chessboard\\" but this was eventually abandoned. In the aftermath, the ridge between Russell's Top and the Turkish trenches was covered with dead and wounded Australian soldiers, most of whom remained where they fell for the duration of the war. Recovering the wounded during the daylight proved largely impossible and many of those who lay injured on the battlefield succumbed in the intense heat. Some troops that had fallen into defiladed positions were recovered, but mostly the wounded had to wait until night. Under the cover of darkness, stretcher bearers were able to venture out to recover some of the wounded, others of whom were able to crawl back to the Australian trenches. A total of 138 wounded were saved. Of these, one who had been wounded in the ankle made it back to Australian lines two nights later; he was among three men to have made it to the Ottoman firing line on the right. Another Australian, Lieutenant E.G. Wilson, is known to have reached the left trench where he was killed by an Ottoman grenade.  Aftermath  The Nek Cemetery occupies much of the former battlefield; the white marble sculpture stands on the location of the former Ottoman Turkish trench. A further consequence of the failure to call off the attack at the Nek was that the supporting attack by two companies of the Royal Welch Fusiliers was launched from the head of Monash Valley, between Russell's Top and Pope's Hill, against the \\"Chessboard\\" trenches. Sixty-five casualties were incurred before the attack was aborted around 06:00. The Australians charged with unloaded rifles with fixed bayonets and were unable to fire; in contrast the volume of fire they faced was, according to Bean, the most intense the Australians faced throughout the war. Of the 600 Australians from the 3rd Light Horse Brigade who took part in the attack, the casualties numbered 372; 234 out of 300 men from the 8th Light Horse Regiment, of whom 154 were killed, and 138 out of the 300 men from the 10th, of whom 80 were killed. The Ottoman losses were negligible; Bean notes that the Ottomans suffered no losses during the assault, but afterwards a \\"large number ... who continued to expose themselves after the attack ... were certainly shot by [Australian] machine guns\\" from Turk 's Point (to the north of Walker's Ridge and the Nek) and Pope's Hill (to the south). Ottoman losses are placed at around twelve dead. In analysing the battle, Carlyon writes that the attack failed due to poor planning and appreciation of the ground by Birdwood, Godley and Skeen. John Hamilton writes that in the aftermath, some Australians nicknamed the battleground \\"Godley's abattoir\\", holding him responsible for the losses. Perry writes that Godley \\"on the beach and out of touch, was most culpable\\", although Carlyon highlights command deficiencies within the Australian brigade as being a key factor, focusing on the role of Hughes and Antill in the decision to continue the attack. Bean, while noting higher-level conceptual errors by Birdwood and Skeen, also concludes that the local commanders were \\"chiefly responsible\\" for the large-scale loss of life at the Nek. Carlyon questions why Godley did not heed the lessons highlighted by the Ottoman attack over the same ground on 30 June, pointing out that the Australians were at several disadvantages ‚Äì attacking up hill, in daylight and against stronger defences ‚Äì compared to the Ottoman attack on 30 June. He also contrasts Hughes and Antill's unquestioning approach with that of Brigadier General Harold Walker, who was ordered to attack Lone Pine despite his own protests but who critically analysed the problem to give his soldiers the best chance of success. Bean wrote that the attack was \\"one of the bravest actions in the history of war\\", but in terms of its wider impact, according to Carlyon the attack gained no ground and served no strategic purpose. Coulthard-Clark concludes that \\"at most, the bold display by the light horsemen at the Nek may have impeded for a few hours ‚Äì but did not prevent ‚Äì the transfer of Turkish reinforcements towards Chunuk Bair, where the New Zealanders were also engaged in a desperate struggle\\". Ultimately, the August Offensive failed to break the deadlock and it proved to be the last major attack launched by the Allied forces on the peninsula. Before it concluded, elements of the 3rd Light Horse Brigade ‚Äì the 9th and 10th Light Horse Regiments ‚Äì took part in another costly attack during the Battle of Hill 60. As winter arrived in October, the Allies made plans to evacuate their troops from Gallipoli beginning in December 1915. One of the final Allied offensive actions took place at the Nek during the evacuation when, on 20 December, a large mine was detonated under the Nek by Allied troops, killing 70 Ottoman defenders. Harold Rush's grave marker in Walker's Ridge Cemetery Efforts were made by the Australians to recover their dead throughout the months following the battle, the 20th Battalion managing to recover the bodies of several men from the first wave, including White in October. Most were unrecoverable during the campaign. When Australian Commonwealth burial parties returned to the peninsula in 1919 after the war's end, the bones of the dead light horsemen were still lying thickly on the small piece of ground. The Nek Cemetery now covers most of no-man's land of the tiny battlefield and contains the remains of 316 Australian soldiers, most of whom fell during the 7 August attack; only five could be identified. Trooper Harold Rush of the 10th Light Horse Regiment died in the third wave. His body was one of the few identified, and he is buried in Walker's Ridge Cemetery. His epitaph famously reads: \\"His last words, Goodbye Cobber, God bless you\\". On 25 November 1915, shortly before the decision to completely withdraw from the peninsula, Godley was temporarily promoted to lieutenant general and appointed corps commander. After the evacuation (he left the day before the rest of his troops), in recognition of his services at Gallipoli, he was made Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath, second highest of the seven British orders of chivalry. Portrayals in media In the aftermath of the battle, Bean covered the fighting at the Nek in a September 1915 article for The Argus that was heavily censored. A January 1916 report by the British commander during the Gallipoli campaign, General Ian Hamilton, provided limited details and was, according to Carlyon, very optimistic in its assessment. Godley's autobiography devoted only two sentences to the battle. Post-war, the battle formed the basis of a chapter in the second volume of Bean's official history. The battle is depicted in the climax of Peter Weir's movie, Gallipoli (1981), although it inaccurately portrays the offensive as a diversion to reduce Ottoman opposition to the landing at Suvla Bay. The battle is also depicted in the Gallipoli miniseries, episode 5: \\"The Breakout\\" (air date 2 March 2015). The episode was reviewed for the Honest History website by Peter Stanley.

The genus name Emberiza is from Old German Embritz, a bunting. The specific aureola is Latin for \\"golden\\". The bird's call is a distinctive zick, and the song is a clear tru-tru, tri-tri. Until 2004, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature considered the yellow-breasted bunting to be a species of least concern. Since 2004, it has been gradually upgraded to a status of Critically Endangered due to rapid drops in population sizes. It is subject to heavy hunting pressure in China, through which most specimens pass during migration.  Description  The yellow-breasted bunting is a small passerine, ranging from in length, and weighing . For a bunting, it is large and rather stocky. The breeding male has bright yellow underparts with black flank streaks, brown upperparts, black face and throat bar, and a pink lower mandible. The female has a heavily streaked grey-brown back, and less intensely yellow underparts. She has a whitish face with dark crown, eye and cheek stripes. The juvenile is similar, but the background colour of the underparts and face is buff.  Distribution and habitat  Schoeniclus aureolus aureolus breeds in boreal forests of Finland to Bering Sea migrating to Indochina Schoeniclus aureolus ornatus breeds from the Amur River to Manchuria, N Korea, Kamchatka and Kuril Islands. It is migratory, wintering in south-east Asia, India, and southern China. It is a rare but regular wanderer to western Europe. There are also ~4 records from the Aleutian Islands of Alaska and a 2017 record from Labrador, Canada. The species winters in large flocks in cultivated areas, rice fields and grasslands, preferring to roost in rice-fields. Breeding The yellow- breasted bunting breeds in open scrubby areas that consist of dry water rice fields for foraging and reedbeds for roosting, often near water, and is present in Siberia. It lays four to six eggs in a nest on the ground. Its food consists of insects when feeding young, and otherwise seeds.  Conservation  Populations have declined precipitously since the early 2000s, and the species is now considered to be critically endangered. The decline of the yellow-breasted bunting is likely to be caused by substantial trapping during migration and most specifically at winter sites. Birds are flushed then caught in mist-nets, to be sold for consumption as \\"sparrows\\" or \\"rice birds\\". Even though the actions have been restricted to a small area in southern China, it has become more widespread and popular to increasing wealth, and hunters now travel long distances to find sufficient birds. Shifts in rice paddy irrigation practices have reduced the quality and quantity of wintering habitats, including the loss of water stubble, and the loss of reedbeds has reduced available roost sites.

Some of the academic fields related to applied linguistics are education, psychology, communication research, anthropology, and sociology.  Domain  Applied linguistics is an interdisciplinary field. Major branches of applied linguistics include bilingualism and multilingualism, conversation analysis, contrastive linguistics, sign linguistics, language assessment, literacies, discourse analysis, language pedagogy, second language acquisition, language planning and policy, interlinguistics, stylistics, language teacher education, pragmatics, forensic linguistics and translation.  Journals  Major journals of the field include Annual Review of Applied Linguistics, Applied Linguistics, Applied Psycholinguistics, International Review of Applied Linguistics in Language Teaching, International Journal of Applied Linguistics, Applied Linguistics Review, European Journal of Applied Linguistics, Language Learning, Language and Education, System, TESOL Quarterly, and Linguistics and Education.  History  The tradition of applied linguistics established itself in part as a response to the narrowing of focus in linguistics with the advent in the late 1950s of generative linguistics, and has always maintained a socially-accountable role, demonstrated by its central interest in language problems.Alan Davies & Catherine Elder.(Eds.). 2004. Handbook of Applied Linguistics. 1 Although the field of applied linguistics started from Europe and the United States, the field rapidly flourished in the international context. Applied linguistics first concerned itself with principles and practices on the basis of linguistics. In the early days, applied linguistics was thought as ‚Äúlinguistics-applied‚Äù at least from the outside of the field. In the 1960s, however, applied linguistics was expanded to include language assessment, language policy, and second language acquisition. As early as the 1970s, applied linguistics became a problem-driven field rather than theoretical linguistics, including the solution of language-related problems in the real world. By the 1990s, applied linguistics had broadened including critical studies and multilingualism. Research in applied linguistics was shifted to \\"the theoretical and empirical investigation of real world problems in which language is a central issue.\\"Christopher Brumfit. How applied linguistics is the same as any other science, \\"International Journal of Applied Linguistics\\", 7(1), 86-94. In the United States, applied linguistics also began narrowly as the application of insights from structural linguistics‚Äîfirst to the teaching of English in schools and subsequently to second and foreign language teaching. The linguistics applied approach to language teaching was promulgated most strenuously by Leonard Bloomfield, who developed the foundation for the Army Specialized Training Program, and by Charles C. Fries, who established the English Language Institute (ELI) at the University of Michigan in 1941. In 1946, Applied linguistics became a recognized field of studies in the aforementioned university. In 1948, the Research Club at Michigan established Language Learning: A Journal of Applied Linguistics, the first journal to bear the term applied linguistics. In the late 1960s, applied linguistics began to establish its own identity as an interdisciplinary field of linguistics concerned with real-world language issues. The new identity was solidified by the creation of the American Association for Applied Linguistics in 1977.Margie Berns and Paul Kei Matsuda. 2006. Applied linguistics: Overview and history. In K. Brown (Ed.), The Encyclopedia of language and linguistics (2nd ed.), 398-401.

Rhodes is located 16 kilometres west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the City of Canada Bay. It was formerly part of Concord Municipality until a merger with Drummoyne Council to form Canada Bay in December 2000. Rhodes sits on a peninsula between Bray Bay and Homebush Bay, on the southern bank of the Parramatta River and is located about 3 kilometres from Stadium Australia, Sydney Olympic Park, Sydney International Aquatic Centre, Bicentennial Park and Millennium Parklands. The pedestrian, cyclist, transport and emergency services Bennelong Bridge from Rhodes to Wentworth Point opened in May 2016. Description The eastern section, east of Concord Road, is predominantly single family detached houses and parkland. It features two residential streets, Cropley Street and Llewellyn Street, which front the Parramatta River. The central section, between Concord Road and the Main Northern railway line, is mixed commercial, single family detached dwelling residential, warehouse/office developments and community facilities. It includes: Rhodes Corporate Park, built on the site of the former Tullochs Phoenix Iron Works; two office blocks with some retail opposite the station; the Rhodes NSW Fire Brigades station (staffed by retained as opposed to full-time officers); single dwelling residences; the former Rhodes Public School (now a community centre); a Coptic Orthodox church and facilities; the Masonic Aged Care Hostel; warehouse/office development along the river; and the First Yaralla Sea Scouts. The western section, west of the railway line, features new developments on the former chemical and industrial sites, and includes: the Rhodes Waterside Shopping Centre; many new (2007) apartment blocks; and a public foreshore walkway with two small parks (one incomplete Jan 2010). This area was planned by the NSW Government under Sydney Regional Environment Plan No 29. History Rhodes was named after the home of an early resident, Thomas Walker (1791‚Äì1861), which was built on the north-eastern side of the peninsula. Walker named his property Rhodes after his grandmother's home, Rhodes Hall, in Leeds, England. The house was demolished in 1919, when the land was purchased by the John Darling Flour Mills, later owned by Allied Feeds Limited.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Compiled by Frances Pollon, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia , page 222 Industry invaded the once picturesque and heavily forested isthmus in 1911 when Messrs. G & C. Hoskins established a large foundry specialising in the manufacture of cast iron pipes for gas and city water reticulation purposes. In 1930 their operations moved to Port Kembla, and in 1935 the site was taken over by CSR.The Former Hoskins Sidings at Rhodes, Eardley, Gifford Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin, November 1971, pp255-260 During the period from about 1930 to the mid-1980s, the western part of the suburb between Homebush Bay and the railway line was taken up by chemical manufacturing. The main manufacturers were Berger Paints, CSR Chemicals,CSR Chemicals was Australia's major manufacturer of phthalates. It was later taken over by Orica Chemicals, (which was then a subsidiary of ICI) Union Carbide,Union Carbide is now a subsidiary of Dow Chemical Company which made Agent Orange, used as a defoliant during the Malayan Emergency and the Vietnam War, at its Rhodes plant and Allied Feeds.Allied Feeds is/was a grain and stock feeds company which sat on a site which had been substantially reclaimed from the Parramatta River by Union Carbide. Union Carbide used the reclaimed area as a dumping ground for its industrial waste, contaminating land and sediments with dioxin. The former Tulloch Limited Phoenix Iron Works were located between the railway line and Concord Road, south of Mary Street. They gave their name to Tulloch Avenue and Phoenix Avenue. This is now the site of the Hewlett Packard offices in Sydney. Tullochs manufactured rolling stock for the New South Wales Government Railways. In October 2010, the City of Canada Bay approved a plan which would allow up to 5 buildings of 25 storeys in this Western section. The expected population in this western section is over 11,000, making it one of the most densely populated areas of Sydney outside the CBD. There are no facilities for organised active recreation or school education within this area. =Major remediation= Remediation by soil desorbtion and incineration With the exception of the area bounded by Mary, Walker, Marquet and Gauthorpe Streets, almost all of the land on the western side of the railway line has needed remediation. Most of the sediments along the sea wall from Oulton Avenue to the northern tip of the peninsula also require(d) remediation. The balance of the bay remains contaminated by numerous chemicals including phthalates, dioxins, lead, heavy metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (coal tars), but to a lesser extent than the areas closer to the sea wall on the eastern shore of the bay.Human Health and Environmental Risk Assessment of Sediments in South-east Homebush Bay. The remediation of the former Union Carbide site, the former Allied Feeds site and a strip of heavily dioxin contaminated sediments in Homebush Bay, have been the subject of extensive analysis, investigations and community activism, including by the Rhodes Peninsula Group.Rhodes The remediation is approved and monitored by the Department of Planning & Environment with extensive community consultation.Rhodes Remediation website A strip of sediment in Homebush Bay between 40 and 100 metres wide and about 850 metres long along the eastern foreshore is being excavated and processed by direct thermal desorption and incineration to remove dioxins and other volatile organics. The remediation proposals were subject to a Parliamentary Inquiry by the NSW Standing Committee on State Development Committee. The remediation was completed in February 2011. The former Berger Paints site near Oulton Avenue, and the CSR Chemicals / Orica Chemicals site on the southern side of Mary Street west of the railway, were also remediated. The Rhodes Waterside Shopping centre is located on the former Berger Paints site. Apartments are being developed on the former Orica Chemicals site, with commercial buildings along the railway line. Apartments are being developed on the former Union Carbide site and the former Allied Feeds site.  Heritage listings  Rhodes has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Main Northern railway: Meadowbank Rail Bridge over Parramatta River * Blaxland Road: Rhodes railway station Transport Rhodes railway station =Railway= Rhodes railway station is on the Northern Line of the Sydney Trains network. The station is about 30 minutes from the Sydney central business district by rail. =Buses= State Transit and Transit Systems provide services along Concord Road and Rider Boulevard. =Road Network and bridges= The Ryde Bridge links Rhodes to Ryde, across the Parramatta River. Rhodes is on a major north-south road system through the suburbs of Sydney, the A3. It is close to two main east-west links, Victoria Road to the north and the M4 Western Motorway/Parramatta Road/City West Link to the south. Bennelong Bridge The Bennelong Bridge across Homebush Bay for buses, emergency services, cyclists and pedestrians opened in May 2016 from Gauthorpe Street in Rhodes to Footbridge Boulevarde in Wentworth Point. The bridge will affect access by boats into the southern part of the bay and its potential use for recreational sailing, although kayaking would be less affected except near the Rhodes shore. =Cycleways= A number of Council and Roads & Maritime Services cycleways run through Rhodes, predominantly along Llewellyn and Walker Streets, joined by Leeds Street and an underpass under Ryde Bridge. There are shared paths along the Homebush Bay foreshore (incomplete in 2010) and immediately to the west of the railway behind the shopping centre and offices in Rider Boulevarde. Cycleways run west to Silverwater Bridge and on to Parramatta on both sides of the river. John Whitton Bridge, which is the former railway bridge joining Rhodes and Meadowbank, has a cycleway and pedestrian walkway. There are links to the cycleway running predominantly along the Cooks River to Botany Bay. =Ferry wharf= A proposal to build Rhodes ferry wharf was announced in 2015. The wharf was scheduled to join Parramatta River ferry services but safety concerns resulted in the project being deferred in 2016. Commercial areas Rhodes Waterside Rhodes features a mixture of single dwelling residential, high density residential, major retail developments such as Rhodes Waterside (including IKEA, Coles Supermarkets, Bing Lee, Reading Cinemas and a Target variety store), commercial, warehouse/office developments and community facilities. There are a number of commercial buildings in the Rhodes Redevelopment Area west of the railway, mainly in Rider Boulevarde, housing substantial businesses such as Australian Associated Press. The Rhodes Corporate Park developed by Australand is located at the corner of Concord Road and Homebush Bay Drive on the eastern side of the railway line and includes businesses such as National Australia Bank and Nestle. Residential areas Apartments in Rhodes While nearly all of the residential areas on the eastern side of the railway line are low to medium density of one or two storeys, the residential area on the western side of the railway line is high density, with most of the area zoned for high density residential development with buildings of four to eight storeys. There is an area of mixed high density residential and business opposite the railway station in Walker Street. The original planning instrument for the Rhodes Redevelopment Area provided for over 7,500 people to live west of the railway line in Rhodes, but with 2009/10 Council amendments, the projected population is now over 11,000 when redevelopment is completed. Community First Yaralla Sea Scouts, near Ryde Bridge Rhodes has one of the last Fire & Rescue NSW stations staffed wholly by paid volunteers in inner metropolitan Sydney. It was established on land owned by the McIlwaine family, (for whom McIlwaine Park is named). Three generations of the McIlwaine family have been Captain of the Brigade. The fire station is located on Concord Road near the intersection with Mary Street on the eastern side of the peninsula. First Yaralla Sea Scouts has a hall near Ryde Bridge. The hall was rebuilt in brick after the original hall was destroyed by fire. Dragon boat paddling also takes place from this site. The Concord Rhodes Open Sailing Club (now Concord Ryde Sailing Club) operated from King George V park until relocated to Waterview Street Putney (near Yaralla Street) to allow for the building of the duplication of Ryde Bridge. Rhodes Community Centre is located in Blaxland Road in the former two teacher Rhodes Primary School buildings. Most primary school children in the area now attend Concord West Public School, Strathfield North Public School or Saint Ambrose at Concord West. A community building is planned for the central Homebush Bay foreshore park on the western side of the peninsula and is expected to be completed in 2012. There is an aged care hostel in Cavell Avenue, built largely on the former Rhodes Public School playground. A Coptic Orthodox church has been built on the site of a former church of another denomination, and additional parish facilities added. Rhodes Residents Association has represented the community, particularly to local government, for over 20 years. Rhodes Peninsula Group also represents community interests in relation to the Rhodes Remediation and Redevelopment and associated issues and infrastructure. =Demographics= At the , the suburb of Rhodes recorded a population of 11,906 people. Of these: * Age distribution: Residents were younger than the country overall. Their median age was 29 years, compared to the national median of 38 years. The disparity is most marked for people aged in the range 20‚Äì29 years, which made up 38.3% of the residents of Rhodes, but only 13.8% nationally. Children aged under 15 years made up 10.9% of the population (national average is 18.7%) and people aged 65 years and over made up 3.7% of the population (national average is 15.8%). * Ethnic diversity : 18.8% of people were born in Australia. The most common countries and region of birth were China 38.2%, South Korea 10.7%, India 4.4%, Hong Kong 2.7% and Saudi Arabia 1.7%. 18.4% of people only spoke English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Mandarin 36.8%, Korean 11.8%, Cantonese 8.1%, Arabic 3.2% and Hindi 2.5%. * Finances: The median household weekly income was $1,693, compared to the national median of $1,438. This difference is also reflected in real estate, with the median mortgage payment being $2,200 per month, compared to the national median of $1,755. * Housing: The great majority (94.6%) of occupied private dwellings were flats, units or apartments and 3.7% were separate houses. The average household size was 2.4 people. * Religion: The most common religious affiliation was \\"No Religion\\" (50.6%); the next most common response was Catholic at 10.9%. Parramatta River at Rhodes The river is generally regarded as safe for secondary contact such as sailing. The river around Rhodes is used by rowing crews for training, predominantly in early mornings, late afternoons and on weekends. Sailing from Concord and Ryde Sailing Club can be seen in the distance from McIlwaine and Brays Bay Parks at Rhodes on Saturdays from 1 September to 30 April. Dragon boating is available from near Yaralla Sea Scouts near Ryde Bridge. There is a boat ramp at the northern end of Blaxland Road. There are other ramps at Wharf Road, West Meadowbank and on the eastern side of Silverwater Bridge on the southern side of the river. No fishing in Homebush Bay Fishing is banned in all of Homebush Bay (including from Rhodes and Wentworth Point). =Proposed Wentworth Point marina= Maritime, a NSW Government instrumentality, owns most of the land on Wentworth Point north of Burroway Road on both sides of Hill Road. Maritime has announced plans for a major boat storage facility with complementary maritime facilities. These are in the planning stage. =Fire= The Rhodes community is protected by the Rhodes, Concord and Ryde Fire Brigades. Rhodes Fire Brigade is one of only three remaining Retained (paid volunteer) Fire Brigades in inner Sydney. Rhodes Fire Brigade celebrated its 90th anniversary in 2011. Parks Bay Day festival at McIlwaine Park in March 2009 There are a number of foreshore parks in the eastern part of the suburb, including McIlwaine Park, King George V Park, Brays Bay Reserve (which contains the Oliveto restaurant), and Rhodes/Rotary Park. Concord and Ryde Sailing Club was based in King George V Park until construction of the second Ryde Bridge required its demolition, after which the club premises were relocated to Kissing Point in Ryde. The Kokoda Track Memorial Walkway, which connects Brays Bay Reserve with Concord Hospital, is a memorial to those killed in Papua New Guinea on the Kokoda Track during World War II. Rhodes features a foreshore path and cycleway, which links to an extensive network of foreshore parks in Sydney.

Roscosmos is headquartered in Moscow, with its main Mission Control Center in the nearby city of Korolyov, and the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center located in Star City in Moscow Oblast. Its launch facilities include Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, the world's first, largest, and busiest spaceport, and Vostochny Cosmodrome, which is being built in the Russian Far East in Amur Oblast. Its director since May 2018 is Dmitry Rogozin. As the main successor to the Soviet space program, Roscosmos' legacy includes the world's first satellite, first human spaceflight, and first space station. Its current activities include the International Space Station, wherein it is a major partner. On February 22, 2019, Roscosmos announced the construction of its new headquarters in Moscow, the National Space Centre. History Patch of the Russian Space Agency, 1991-2004 Space Technology in the Tsiolkovsky State Museum of the History of Cosmonautics, Kaluga, Russia. The exhibition includes the models and replicas of the following Russian/Soviet inventions: the first satellite, Sputnik 1 (a ball under the ceiling); the first spacesuits (lower-left corner); the first human spaceflight module, the Vostok 3KA (center); the first Molniya-type satellite (upper right corner); the first space rover, Lunokhod 1 (lower right); the first space station, Salyut 1 (left); the first modular space station, Mir (upper left). The Soviet space program did not have central executive agencies. Instead, its organizational architecture was multi-centered; it was the design bureaus and the council of designers that had the most say, not the political leadership. The creation of a central agency after the separation of Russia from the Soviet Union was therefore a new development. The Russian Space Agency was formed on February 25, 1992, by a decree of President Yeltsin. Yuri Koptev, who had previously worked with designing Mars landers at NPO Lavochkin, became the agency's first director. In the early years, the agency suffered from lack of authority as the powerful design bureaus fought to protect their own spheres of operation and to survive. For example, the decision to keep Mir in operation beyond 1999 was not taken by the agency; instead, it was made by the private shareholder board of the Energia design bureau. Another example is that the decision to develop the new Angara rocket was rather a function of Khrunichev's ability to attract resources than a conscious long-term decision by the agency. = Crisis years = The 1990s saw serious financial problems due to the decreased cash flow, which encouraged the space agency to improvise and seek other ways to keep space programs running. This resulted in the agency's leading role in commercial satellite launches and space tourism. Scientific missions, such as interplanetary probes or astronomy missions during these years played a very small role, and although the agency had connections with the Russian aerospace forces, its budget was not part of Russia's defense budget; nevertheless, the agency managed to operate the Mir space station well past its planned lifespan, contributed to the International Space Station, and continued to fly Soyuz and Progress missions. = Start of the ISS Cooperation in 2000 = On Oct. 31, 2000, a Soyuz spacecraft lifted off from the Baikonur Cosmodrome at 10:53 a.m. Kazakhstan time. On board were Expedition One Commander William M. (Bill) Shepherd of NASA and cosmonauts Sergei Krikalev and Yuri Gidzenko of Roscosmos. The trio arrived at the International Space Station on Nov. 2, marking the start of an uninterrupted human presence on the orbiting laboratory. = 2004: New director = In March 2004, the agency's director Yuri Koptev was replaced by Anatoly Perminov, who had previously served as the first commander of the Space Forces. = Improved situation in 2005‚Äì2006 = The Russian economy boomed throughout 2005 from high prices for exports, such as oil and gas, the outlook for future funding in 2006 appeared more favorable. This resulted in the Russian Duma approving a budget of 305 billion rubles (about US$11 billion) for the Space Agency from 2006 January to 2015, with overall space expenditures in Russia total about 425 billion rubles for the same time period. The budget for 2006 was as high as 25 billion rubles (about US$900 million), which is a 33% increase from the 2005 budget. Under the current 10-year budget approved, the budget of the Space Agency shall increase 5‚Äì10% per year, providing the space agency with a constant influx of money. In addition to the budget, Roscosmos plans to have over 130 billion rubles flowing into its budget by other means, such as industry investments and commercial space launches. It is around the time US-based The Planetary Society entered a partnership with Roscosmos. *New science missions: Koronas Foton (launched in January 2009), Spektr R (RadioAstron, launched in July 2011), Intergelizond (2011), Spektr RG (Roentgen Gamma, 2015), Spektr UV (Ultra Violet, 2016), Spektr M (2018),–í–ó–ì–õ–Ø–î / –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–∏–µ —É—á–µ–Ω—ã–µ —Å–æ–∑–¥–∞–ª–∏ –Ω–æ–≤—É—é —Ç–µ—Ö–Ω–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—é –¥–ª—è –∫–æ—Å–º–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö —Ç–µ–ª–µ—Å–∫–æ–ø–æ–≤.

Priorities of the Russian space program include the new Angara rocket family and development of new communications, navigation and remote Earth sensing spacecraft. The GLONASS global navigation satellite system has for many years been one of the top priorities and has been given its own budget line in the federal space budget. In 2007, GLONASS received 9.9 billion rubles ($360 million), and under the terms of a directive signed by Prime Minister Vladimir Putin in 2008, an additional $2.6 billion will be allocated for its development.  Space station funding issues  Due to International Space Station involvements, up to 50% of Russia's space budget is spent on the crewed space program . Some observers have pointed out that this has a detrimental effect on other aspects of space exploration, and that the other space powers spend much lesser proportions of their overall budgets on maintaining human presence in orbit. Despite the considerably improved budget, attention of legislative and executive authorities, positive media coverage and broad support among the population, the Russian space program continues to face several problems. Wages in the space industry are low; the average age of employees is high (46 years in 2007), and much of the equipment is obsolete. On the positive side, many companies in the sector have been able to profit from contracts and partnerships with foreign companies; several new systems such as new rocket upper stages have been developed in recent years; investments have been made to production lines, and companies have started to pay more attention to educating a new generation of engineers and technicians. = 2011: New director = On 29 April 2011, Perminov was replaced with Vladimir Popovkin as the director of Roscosmos. The 65-year-old Perminov was over the legal age for state officials, and had received some criticism after a failed GLONASS launch in December 2010. Popovkin is a former commander of the Russian Space Forces and First Deputy Defense Minister of Russia.Popovkin replaces Perminov at Russian space agency RIA Novosti 2011-04-29 =2013-2015 reorganization of the Russian space sector= As a result of a series of reliability problems, and proximate to the failure of a July 2013 Proton M launch, a major reorganization of the Russian space industry was undertaken. The United Rocket and Space Corporation was formed as a joint-stock corporation by the government in August 2013 to consolidate the Russian space sector. Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin said \\"the failure-prone space sector is so troubled that it needs state supervision to overcome its problems.\\" Three days following the Proton M launch failure, the Russian government had announced that \\"extremely harsh measures\\" would be taken \\"and spell the end of the [Russian] space industry as we know it.\\" Information indicated then that the government intended to reorganize in such a way as to \\"preserve and enhance the Roscosmos space agency.\\" More detailed plans released in October 2013 called for a re-nationalization of the \\"troubled space industry,\\" with sweeping reforms including a new \\"unified command structure and reducing redundant capabilities, acts that could lead to tens of thousands of layoffs.\\" According to Rogozin, the Russian space sector employs about 250,000 people, while the United States needs only 70,000 to achieve similar results. He said: \\"Russian space productivity is eight times lower than America's, with companies duplicating one another's work and operating at about 40 percent efficiency.\\" Under the 2013 plan, Roscosmos was to \\"act as a federal executive body and contracting authority for programs to be implemented by the industry.\\" In 2016, the state agency was dissolved and the Roscosmos brand moved to the state corporation, which had been created in 2013 as the United Rocket and Space Corporation, with the specific mission to renationalize the Russian space sector. In 2018, Russian President Vladimir Putin said \\"it 'is necessary to drastically improve the quality and reliability of space and launch vehicles' ... to preserve Russia's increasingly threatened leadership in space.\\"Putin challenges Roscosmos to \\"drastically improve\\" on space and launch, SpaceNews, 20 July 2018, accessed 21 July 2018. In November 2018 Alexei Kudrin, head of Russian financial audit agency, named Roscosmos as the public enterprise with \\"the highest losses\\" due to \\"irrational spending\\" and outright theft and corruption. Current programs =ISS involvement= The Zarya module was the first module of the ISS, launched in 1998. Roscosmos is one of the partners in the International Space Station program; it contributed the core space modules Zarya and Zvezda, which were both launched by Proton rockets and later were joined by NASA's Unity Module. The Rassvet module was launched aboard and will be primarily used for cargo storage and as a docking port for visiting spacecraft. The Nauka module is the last component of the ISS, due to be launched in November 2019. Roscosmos is furthermore responsible for expedition crew launches by Soyuz-TMA spacecraft and resupplies the space station with Progress space transporters. After the initial ISS contract with NASA expired, Roscosmos and NASA, with the approval of the US government, entered into a space contract running until 2011, according to which Roscosmos will sell NASA spots on Soyuz spacecraft for approximately $21 million per person each way (thus $42 million to and back from the ISS per person) as well as provide Progress transport flights ($50 million per Progress as outlined in the Exploration Systems Architecture Study). Roscosmos has announced that according to this arrangement, crewed Soyuz flights will be doubled to 4 per year and Progress flights also doubled to 8 per year beginning in 2008. Roscosmos also provides space tourism for fare-paying passengers to ISS through the Space Adventures company. As of 2009, six space tourists have contracted with Roscosmos and have flown into space, each for an estimated fee of at least $20 million (USD). =Science programs= Roscosmos operates a number of programs for Earth science, communication, and scientific research. Future projects include the Soyuz successor, the Prospective Piloted Transport System, scientific robotic missions to one of the Mars moons as well as an increase in Lunar orbit research satellites. *Luna-Glob Moon orbiter and lander, planned in 2021 *Venera-D Venus lander, planned in 2025 *Fobos-Grunt Mars mission, lost in low Earth orbit in 2012 *Mars 96 Mars mission, lost in low Earth orbit in 1996 =Rockets= Roscosmos uses a family of several launch rockets, the most famous of them being the R-7, commonly known as the Soyuz rocket that is capable of launching about 7.5 tons into low Earth orbit (LEO). The Proton rocket (or UR-500K) has a lift capacity of over 20 tons to LEO. Smaller rockets include Rokot and other Stations. Currently rocket development encompasses both a new rocket system, Angara, as well as enhancements of the Soyuz rocket, Soyuz-2 and Soyuz-2-3. Two modifications of the Soyuz, the Soyuz-2.1a and Soyuz-2.1b have already been successfully tested, enhancing the launch capacity to 8.5 tons to LEO. = New piloted spacecraft = One of Roscosmos's projects that was widely covered in the media in 2005 was Kliper, a small lifting body reusable spacecraft. While Roscosmos had reached out to ESA and JAXA as well as others to share development costs of the project, it also stated that it will go forward with the project even without the support of other space agencies. This statement was backed by the approval of its budget for 2006‚Äì2015, which includes the necessary funding of Kliper. However, the Kliper program was cancelled in July 2006,www.flightglobal.com and has been replaced by the new Orel project. no crafts were launched. = Space systems = \\"Resurs-P\\" is a series of Russian commercial Earth observation satellites capable of acquiring high-resolution imagery (resolution up to 1.0 m).

On 2016, the system consists of 13 satellites (12 Gonets-M and 1 Gonets-D1). = Gecko mating experiment = On 19 July 2014, Roscosmos launched the Foton-M4 satellite containing, among other animals and plants, a group of five geckos. The five geckos, four females and one male, were used as a part of the Gecko-F4 research program aimed at measuring the effects of weightlessness on the lizards' ability to procreate and develop in the harsh environment. However, soon after the spacecraft exited the atmosphere, mission control lost contact with the vessel which led to an attempt to reestablish communication that was only achieved later in the mission. When the satellite returned to Earth after its planned two-month mission had been cut short to 44 days, the space agency researchers reported that all the geckos had perished during the flight. The exact cause that led to the deaths of the geckos was declared unknown by the scientific team in charge of the project. Reports from the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems in Russia have indicated that the lizards had been dead for at least a week prior to their return to Earth. A number of those connected to the mission have theorized that a failure in the vessel's heating system may have caused the cold blooded reptiles to freeze to death. Included in the mission were a number of fruit flies, plants, and mushrooms which all survived the mission. Launch control The military counterpart of Roscosmos is the Military Space Forces (VKO). The VKO controls Russia's Plesetsk Cosmodrome launch facility. Roscosmos and the VKO share control of the Baikonur Cosmodrome, where Roscosmos reimburses the VKO for the wages of many of the flight controllers during civilian launches. Roscosmos and the VKO also share control of the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center. It has been announced that Russia is to build another spaceport in Tsiolkovsky, Amur Oblast.

Her career of travelling and writing about her travels has spanned 40 years.  Biography  Robyn Davidson was born at Stanley Park, a cattle station in Miles, Queensland, the second of two girls. Her mother died by suicide when Davidson was 11, and she was largely raised by her father's unmarried sister, Gillian. She went to a girls' boarding school in Brisbane. She received a music scholarship but did not take it up. In Brisbane, Davidson shared a house with biologists and studied zoology. In 1968, aged 18, she went to Sydney and later lived a bohemian life in a Sydney Push household at Paddington, while working as a card-dealer at an illegal gambling house.Krien, Anna.

She had no intention of writing about the journey, but eventually agreed to write an article for the magazine National Geographic. Having met the photographer Rick Smolan in Alice Springs, she insisted that he be the photographer for the journey. Smolan, with whom she had an \\"on-again off- again\\" romantic relationship during the trip, drove out to meet her three times during the nine-month journey. The National Geographic article was published in 1978 and attracted so much interest that Davidson decided to write a book about the experience. She travelled to London and lived with Doris Lessing while writing Tracks. Tracks won the inaugural Thomas Cook Travel Book Award in 1980 and the Blind Society Award. In the early nineties, Smolan published his pictures of the trip in From Alice to Ocean. It included the first interactive story-and-photo CDs made for the general public. It has been suggested that one of the reasons Tracks was so popular, particularly with women, is that Davidson \\"places herself in the wilderness of her own accord, rather than as an adjunct to a man\\". Davidson's desert journey is remembered by Aboriginal Australians she encountered along the way. Artist Jean Burke remembers Davidson in a painting called The Camel Lady which was produced for a Warakurna Artists' exhibition in Darwin in 2011.Warakurna Artists Burke's father, Mr Eddie, had trekked through Ngaanyatjarra lands with Davidson, guiding her to water sources along the way. Davidson mentions Mr Eddie in Tracks.Warakurna history paintings, National Museum of Australia =Film adaptation= In 2013, a film adaptation directed by John Curran and starring Mia Wasikowska was completed. The film Tracks screened at the Venice Film Festival.\\"Mia Wasikowska stars in film of Robyn Davidson's book Tracks, about camel journey across Australia\\", The Daily Telegraph (Sydney) Nomads The majority of Davidson's work has been travelling with and studying nomadic peoples. Jane Sullivan in The Age writes that \\"while she is often called a social anthropologist\\", she has no academic qualifications and says that she is \\"completely self-taught\\". Davidson's experiences with nomads include traveling on migration with nomads in India from 1990 to 1992. These experiences were published in Desert Places. She has studied different forms of the nomad lifestyle‚Äîincluding those in Australia, India, and Tibet‚Äîfor a book and a documentary series. Her writing on nomads is based mainly on personal experience, and she brings many of her thoughts together in No Fixed Address, her contribution to the Quarterly Essay series. Sullivan writes about this work: > One of the questions we need to ask, if we are to have a future, she says, > is \\"Where did we cause less damage to ourselves, to our environment, and to > our animal kin?\\" One answer is: when we were nomadic. \\"It is when we settled > that we became strangers in a strange land, and wandering took on the > quality of banishment,\\" she writes, and then later adds: \\"I shall probably > be accused of romanticism\\".

He is best remembered as one of the authors of the Napoleonic Code, which still forms the basis of French civil law and French- inspired civil law in many countries.  Early life  Cambac√©r√®s was born in Montpellier, into a family of the legal nobility. Although his childhood was relatively poor, his brother √âtienne Hubert de Cambac√©r√®s later became a cardinal, and his father later became mayor of Montpellier. In 1774, Cambac√©r√®s graduated in law from the college d'Aix and succeeded his father as Councillor in the court of accounts and finances in Toulouse. He was a supporter of the French Revolution of 1789, and was elected as an extra deputy to represent the nobility of Montpellier, in case the government doubled the nobility's delegation at the meeting of the Estates-General at Versailles. However, as the delegation was not increased, he never took his seat. In 1792, he represented the department of H√©rault at the National Convention which assembled and proclaimed the First French Republic in September 1792.  National Convention  In revolutionary terms, Cambac√©r√®s was a moderate republican and sat left of center during the National Convention. During the trial of Louis XVI he protested that the Convention did not have the power to sit as a court and demanded that the king should have due facilities for his defence. Nevertheless, when the trial proceeded, Cambac√©r√®s voted with the majority that declared Louis to be guilty, but recommended that the penalty should be postponed until it could be ratified by a legislative body. This would later save him from being executed for regicide. During the Convention, many of his decisions (like the latter) were well thought out and calculated. Cambac√©r√®s made sure that he never committed himself to a certain faction. His legal expertise made him useful to all parties; he was a friend to all and an enemy to none. However, due to this, his fellow representatives at the convention did criticize him for sometimes fluctuating on some positions.  Rise under Napoleon  Cambac√©r√®s was a member of the Committee of General Defence from 1793 until the end of 1794, and later became a member of its infamous successor, the Committee of Public Safety after the fall of Robespierre. In the meantime he worked on much of the legislation of the revolutionary period. During 1795, he was employed as a diplomat and negotiated peace with Spain, the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, the Kingdom of Prussia and the Batavian Republic. His remarkable debating skills gave him a spot as a councilor of the Five Hundred from 1795-1799. Cambac√©r√®s was considered too conservative to be one of the five Directors who took power in the coup of 1795 and, finding himself in opposition to the Executive Directory, he retired from politics. In 1799, however, as the Revolution entered a more moderate phase, he became Minister of Justice. He supported the coup of 18 Brumaire (in November 1799) that brought Napoleon Bonaparte to power as First Consul, a new regime designed to establish a stable constitutional republic.  The Napoleonic Code  A portrait of the three Consuls, from left to right: Jean Jacques R√©gis de Cambac√©r√®s, Napoleon Bonaparte and Charles-Fran√ßois Lebrun. In December 1799, Cambac√©r√®s was appointed Second Consul under Bonaparte. He owed this appointment to his vast legal knowledge and his reputation as a moderate republican. His most important work during this period, and arguably during his entire political career, was the drawing up of a new Civil Law Code (later called the Napoleonic Code; France's first modern legal code). The Code was promulgated by Bonaparte (as Emperor Napoleon) in 1804. In the end, the Napoleonic Code was the work of Cambac√©r√®s and a commission of four lawyers. The Code was a revised form of Roman law, with some modifications drawn from the laws of the Franks still current in northern France (Coutume de Paris). The Code was later extended by Napoleon's conquests to Poland, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, western Germany and Spain, and indirectly to the Spanish colonies in Latin America. Cambac√©r√®s' work has thus been enormously influential in European and American legal history. Versions of the Code are still in force in Quebec and Louisiana. The Napoleonic Code dealt with Civil Law; other codes ensued for Penal Law, criminal procedure, and civil procedure.  Life with Napoleon (1804‚Äì1815)  Cambac√©r√®s disapproved of Bonaparte's accumulation of power into his own hands (culminating in the proclamation of the First French Empire on 18 May 1804) but retained high office under Napoleon: Arch-Chancellor of the Empire and President of the House of Peers from 2 June, to 7 July 1815. He also became a prince of the Empire and in 1808 was made Duke of Parma (French: duc de Parme). His duchy was one of the twenty created as a duch√© grand-fief (among 2200 noble titles created by Napoleon)‚Äîa rare hereditary honor, extinguished upon Cambac√©r√®s' death in 1824. He was essentially second in command of France during the Napoleonic era. Under Napoleon, he was a force for moderation and reason, opposing adventures such as the Spanish affairs in 1808 and the invasion of Russia in 1812. Nevertheless, Cambac√©r√®s was extremely trusted by Napoleon and was constantly consulted for advice; Cambac√©r√®s even sat as Council of State when Bonaparte was involved in other affairs. As Napoleon became increasingly obsessed with military affairs, Cambac√©r√®s became the de facto domestic head of government of France, a position which inevitably made him increasingly unpopular as France's economic situation grew worse. As more and more of Napoleon's ministers proved themselves untrustworthy, Cambac√©r√®s' power continued to grow. His taste for high living also attracted hostile comments. Nevertheless, he was given credit for the justice and moderation of his government, although the enforcement of conscription was increasingly resented towards the end of the Napoleonic Wars. When the Empire fell in 1814, Cambac√©r√®s retired to private life but was later called upon during Napol√©on's brief return to power in 1815. During the Hundred Days, the short period of time when Napoleon returned from exile, Cambac√©r√®s served as the minister of justice. After the restoration of the monarchy, he was in danger of arrest for his revolutionary activities, and he was exiled from France in 1816. The fact that he had opposed the execution of Louis XVI counted in his favor, and in May 1818 his civil rights as a citizen of France were restored. From 1815 and on, Cambac√©r√®s used the title of Duke of Cambac√©r√®s (on the fall of the Empire, the Duchy of Parma passed to former Empress Marie Louise). He was a member of the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise and lived quietly in Paris until his death in 1824.  Private life  The common belief that Cambac√©r√®s is responsible for decriminalizing homosexuality in France is in error. Before the French Revolution, sodomy had been a capital crime under royal legislation. The penalty was burning at the stake. Very few men, however, were ever actually prosecuted and executed for consensual sodomy (no more than five in the entire eighteenth century). Sodomites arrested by the police were more usually released with a warning or held in prison for, at most, a few weeks or months. The National Constituent Assembly revised French criminal law in 1791 and got rid of a variety of offenses inspired by religion, including blasphemy. Sodomy was not specifically mentioned but was covered under the umbrella of 'religious crimes'. Since there was no public debate, its motives remain unknown (a similar state of affairs occurred during the early years of the Russian Revolution). Cambac√©r√®s was a homosexual, his sexual orientation was well-known, and he does not seem to have made any effort to conceal it. He remained unmarried, and kept to the company of other bachelors. Napoleon is recorded as making a number of jokes on the subject. Upon hearing that Cambac√©r√®s had recruited a woman for a mission, Napoleon responded with, \\"my compliments, so you have come closer to women?\\". Robert Badinter once mentioned in a speech to the French National Assembly, during debates on reforming the homosexual age of consent, that Cambac√©r√®s was known in the gardens of the Palais-Royal as \\"Tante Urlurette\\". In fact, however, Cambac√©r√®s was not responsible for ending the legal prosecution of homosexuals. He did play a key role in drafting the Code Napol√©on, but this was a civil law code. He had nothing to do with the Penal Code of 1810, which covered sexual crimes. The authors of the Penal Code of 1810 had the option of reintroducing a law against male homosexuality (as was eventually done in the Soviet Union), but there is no evidence that they even considered doing so. This had nothing to do with the influence of Cambac√©r√®s, as recent research has shown. However, Napoleonic officials could and did repress public expressions of homosexuality using other laws, such as \\"offenses against public decency\\". Nevertheless, despite police surveillance and harassment, the Revolutionary and Napoleonic era was a time of relative freedom for homosexuals and opened the modern era of legal toleration for homosexuality in Europe. Napoleonic conquests imposed the principles of Napoleon's Penal Code (including the decriminalization of homosexuality) on many other parts of Europe, including Belgium, the Netherlands, the Rhineland, and Italy. Other states freely followed the French example, including Bavaria in 1813 and Spain in 1822. Cambac√©r√®s' colleagues also didn't fail to poke fun at his gluttony. When he met with the Council while Napoleon was away, everyone knew that the meeting would be over before lunch. He was known for having the best dinners in France and for his extravagant lifestyle. According to him, \\"a country is governed by good dinner parties\\". His estate was worth around 7.3 million francs (around ‚Ç¨50 million in 2015 euros) upon his death in 1824. His body now lies in the cemetery of P√®re Lachaise where he was buried with military honors.  Freemasonry  Cambaceres was admitted to the lodge of \\"Les Amis Fid√®les\\" in Montpellier in 1775. During Napoleon's reign, he was charged by the Emperor to monitor Freemasonry in France. From 1805 to 1815, he was the assistant of Joseph Bonaparte, Grand Master of Grand Orient de France, and managed the post-revolutionary rebirth of French freemasonry. During his term, more than 1200 lodges were created.

The Luff Award of the American Philatelic Society is named after him. Philatelic career He developed a serious interest in philately in 1890, and joined the Pacific Philatelic Society in San Francisco, California. He moved to New York City in 1893 with the intention of becoming a full-time stamp dealer, and the following year joined the Scott Stamp & Coin Company, at the time one of the largest dealers in the world. At Scott he headed the approval department, edited the American Journal of Philately, and co-edited the Scott catalog. In 1896, he helped establish the Collectors Club of New York, and was later its president for a number of years. He became president of Scott in 1903, but moved to Stanley Gibbons in 1905, shortly after returning to Scott, where he remained for the rest of his life. Luff had become perhaps the most prolific philatelic writer of the age, with works ranging from the tutorial What Philately Teaches Us (1899) to the classic reference work The Postage Stamps of the United States (1902), and numerous articles in the AJP and Mekeel's Weekly Stamp News. In addition to building a US collection that won the gold medal at the Paris exhibition of 1900, Luff also collected Great Britain, Shanghai, Hawaii, Japan, and China. But his most important collection was a reference collection that he used as a basis for comparison when expertizing stamps at Scott. He sold the collection to Scott when he left in 1905; the collection was later donated to the Philatelic Foundation, where it mostly still resides and is in use . Luff was president of the American Philatelic Society from 1907 to 1909. In 1913, Luff was one of 10 judges who participated in the Panama-Pacific Exposition held in San Francisco, CA. There were 6 other U.S. judges at the Expo. In 1941, he was named to the American Philatelic Society Hall of Fame.

The historiography of the French Revolution stretches back over two hundred years, as commentators and historians have sought to answer questions regarding the origins of the Revolution, and its meaning and effects. By the year 2000, many historians were saying that the field of the French Revolution was in intellectual disarray. The old model or paradigm focusing on class conflict has been challenged but no new explanatory model had gained widespread support.Rebecca L. Spang, \\"Paradigms and Paranoia: How modern Is the French Revolution?\\" American Historical Review (2003) 108#1 pp. 119‚Äì47 Nevertheless, there persists a very widespread agreement to the effect that the French Revolution was the watershed between the premodern and modern eras of Western history.Rebecca L. Spang, \\"Paradigms and Paranoia' Contemporary and 19th-century historians The literature in French is vast, and in English quite substantial. For a summary of the older studies see Alfred Cobban, \\"The Beginning of the French Revolution\\" History 30#111 (1945), pp. 90-98 online covers the older studies. =French historians ‚Äì Adolphe Thiers= The first major work on the Revolution by a French historian was published between 1823 and 1827 by Adolphe Thiers. His celebrated Histoire de la R√©volution fran√ßaise, in ten volumes, founded his literary reputation and launched his political career. The complete work of ten volumes sold ten thousand sets, an enormous number for the time. It went through four more editions. Thiers' history was particularly popular in liberal circles and among younger Parisians. Written during the Restoration, when the tricolor flag and singing the Marseillaise were forbidden, the book praised the principles, leaders and accomplishments of the 1789 Revolution; the clear heroes were Mirabeau, Lafayette, and other moderate leaders. It condemned Marat, Robespierre and the other radical leaders, and also condemned the monarchy, aristocracy and clergy for their inability to change. The book played a notable role in undermining the legitimacy of the Bourbon regime of Charles X, and bringing about the July Revolution of 1830. Thiers went on to become a Deputy, twice Prime Minister, and the first president of the Third French Republic. He also headed the French government in 1871 which suppressed the Paris Commune. Thiers' history of the Revolution was praised by the French authors Chateaubriand, Stendhal et Sainte-Beuve, was translated into English (1838) and Spanish (1889), and won him a seat in the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise in 1834. It was less appreciated by British critics, in large part because of his favorable view of the French Revolution and of Napoleon Bonaparte. The British historian Thomas Carlyle, who wrote his own history of the French Revolution, complained that it \\"was far as possible from meriting its high reputation\\", though he admitted that Thiers is \\"a brisk man in his way, and will tell you much if you know nothing.\\" The British historian Hugh Chisholm wrote in the 1911 edition of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, \\"Thiers' historical work is marked by extreme inaccuracy, by prejudice which passes the limits of accidental unfairness, and by an almost complete indifference to the merits as compared with the successes of his heroes.\\" =Attacks from the right= The constant stream of major books began with Edmund Burke's Reflections on the Revolution in France (1790). In it he established the conservative stream of opinion, wherein even the revolution of July 1789 went \\"too far\\". His book is not so much studied today as part of Revolution studies, but rather as a classic of conservative political philosophy. In France, conspiracy theories were rife in the highly charged political atmosphere, with the Abb√© Barruel, in perhaps the most influential work Memoirs Illustrating the History of Jacobinism (1797‚Äì1798), arguing that Freemasons and other dissidents had been responsible for an attempt to destroy the monarchy and the Catholic Church. Hippolyte Taine (1828‚Äì1893) was among the more conservative of the originators of social history. His most famous work is his Origines de la France Contemporaine (1875‚Äì1893). Many minor studies appeared, such as The French Revolution: A Study in Democracy by British writer Nesta Webster, published in 1919. It advanced the theory that the progress of the French Revolution was considerably influenced by a conspiracy conducted by \\"the lodges of the German Freemasons and Illuminati\\". This theory was believed by Winston Churchill, who wrote in 1920: \\"This conspiracy against civilization dates from the days of Weishaupt ... as a modern historian Mrs. Webster has so ably shown, it played a recognisable role on the French Revolution.\\" =Liberal support for 1789‚Äì91= A simplified description of the liberal approach to the Revolution was typically to support the achievements of the constitutional monarchy of the National Assembly but disown the later actions of radical violence like the invasion of the Tuileries and the Terror. French historians of the first half of the 19th century like the politician and man of letters Fran√ßois Guizot (1787‚Äì1874), historian Fran√ßois Mignet (published Histoire de la R√©volution fran√ßaise in 1824), and famous philosopher Alexis de Tocqueville (L'Ancien R√©gime et la R√©volution, 1856) established and wrote in this tradition. *Jules Michelet (1798‚Äì1874) ‚Äì His Histoire de la R√©volution fran√ßaise, published after the Revolution of 1848, is a major history. Historian Fran√ßois Furet, a leader of the Annales School, argues that his multivolume history remains \\"the cornerstone of all revolutionary historiography and is also a literary monument.\\"Fran√ßois Furet, Revolutionary France 1770‚Äì1880 (1992), p. 571 His aphoristic style emphasized his anti- clerical republicanism. =Others in 19th century= Other French historians in the 19th-century include: *Louis Blanc (1811‚Äì1882) ‚Äì Blanc's 13-volume Histoire de la R√©volution fran√ßaise (1847‚Äì1862) displays utopian socialist views, and sympathizes with Jacobinism. *Th√©odore Gosselin (1855‚Äì1935) ‚Äì Better known by the pseudonym \\"G. Lenotre\\". *Albert Sorel (1842‚Äì1906) ‚Äì Diplomatic historian; L'Europe et la R√©volution fran√ßaise (8 volumes, 1895‚Äì1904); introductory section of this work translated as Europe under the Old Regime (1947). * Edgar Quinet (1803‚Äì1875) ‚Äì Late Romantic anti-Catholic nationalist. =Carlyle= One of the most famous English works on the Revolution remains Thomas Carlyle's three-volume The French Revolution, A History (1837) . It is a romantic work, both in style and viewpoint. Passionate in his concern for the poor and in his interest in the fears and hopes of revolution, he (while reasonably historically accurate) is often more concerned with conveying his impression of the hopes and aspirations of people (and his opposition to ossified ideology‚Äî\\"formulas\\" or \\"Isms\\"‚Äîas he called them) than with strict adherence to fact. The undoubted passion and intensity of the text may also be due to the famous incident where he sent the completed draft of the first volume to John Stuart Mill for comment, only for Mill's maid to accidentally burn the volume to ashes, forcing Carlyle to start from scratch. He wrote to Ralph Waldo Emerson that the writing of the book was the \\"dreadfulest labor [he] ever undertook\\".Quoted in John Hall Stewart, A Documentary Survey of the French Revolution, Macmillan, 1951. =Anarchists= In 1909, Peter Kropotkin, a Russian anarchist, published The Great French Revolution, which attempts to round out the political approach with the perspective and contribution to the Revolution of the common man. Aulard and academic studies Alphonse Aulard (1849‚Äì1928) was the first professional historian of the Revolution; he promoted graduate studies, scholarly editions, and learned journals. His appointment to the Sorbonne was promoted and funded by Republicans in the national and Paris governments, but he was not himself involved in party politics. He promoted a republican, bourgeois, and anticlerical view of the revolution. From 1886 he taught at the Sorbonne, trained advanced students, founded the Soci√©t√© de l'Histoire de la R√©volution, and edited the scholarly journal La R√©volution fran√ßaise. He assembled and published many key primary sources. He professionalized scholarship in the field, moving away from the literary multi-volume studies aimed at an upscale general public, promoting special political ideals, that had characterized writing on the Revolution before the 1880s. Instead his work was aimed at fellow scholars and researchers. His broad interpretation argued: :From the social point of view, the Revolution consisted in the suppression of what was called the feudal system, in the emancipation of the individual, in greater division of landed property, the abolition of the privileges of noble birth, the establishment of equality, the simplification of life.... The French Revolution differed from other revolutions in being not merely national, for it aimed at benefiting all humanity.\\" Aulard's historiography was based on positivism. The assumption was that methodology was all-important and the historian's duty was to present in chronological order the duly verified facts, to analyze relations between facts, and provide the most likely interpretation. Full documentation based on research in the primary sources was essential. He took the lead in training advanced students in the proper use and analysis of primary sources. Aulard's famous four volume history of the Revolution focused on technical issues.Fran√ßois-Alphonse Aulard, The French Revolution, a Political History, 1789‚Äì1804 (4 vol., 3rd ed. 1901; English ed. 1910); volume 1 1789‚Äì1792 online; Volume 2 1792‚Äì95 online Aulard's books favored the study of parliamentary debates, not action in the street; institutions, not insurrections. He emphasized public opinion, elections, parties, parliamentary majorities, and legislation. He recognized the complications that prevented the Revolution from fulfilling all its ideal promises ‚Äì as when the legislators of 1793 made suffrage universal for all French men, but also established the dictatorship of the Terror.Furet (1989) The Marxist/Classic interpretation The dominating approach to the French Revolution in historical scholarship in the first half of the 20th century was the Marxist, or Classic, approach. This view sees the French Revolution as an essentially 'bourgeois' revolution, marked by class struggle and resulting in a victory of the bourgeoisie. Influenced by socialist politician Jean Jaur√®s and historian Albert Mathiez (who broke with his teacher Aulard regarding class conflict), historians on the left led by Georges Lefebvre and Albert Soboul developed this view. Lefebvre was inspired by Jaur√®s and came to the field from a mildly socialist viewpoint. His massive and reputation-making thesis, Les paysans du Nord (1924), was an account of the Revolution among provincial peasants. He continued to research along these lines, publishing The Great Fear of 1789 (1932, first English translation 1973), about the panic and violence which spread throughout rural France in the summer of 1789. His work largely approaches the Revolution \\"from below\\", favouring explanations in terms of classes. His most famous work was Quatre-Vingt-Neuf (literally Eighty-Nine, published in 1939 and translated into English as The Coming of the French Revolution, 1947). This skilfully and persuasively argued work interprets the Revolution through a Marxist lens: first there is the \\"aristocratic revolution\\" of the Assembly of Notables and the Paris Parlement in 1788; then the \\"bourgeois revolution\\" of the Third Estate; the \\"popular revolution\\", symbolised by the fall of the Bastille; and the \\"peasant revolution\\", represented by the \\"Great Fear\\" in the provinces and the burning of ch√¢teaux. (Alternately, one can view 1788 as the aristocratic revolution, 1789 the bourgeois revolution, and 1792/3 the popular revolution). This interpretation sees a rising capitalist middle-class overthrow a dying-out feudal aristocratic ruling caste, and held the field for almost twenty years.William Doyle.

Aulard ‚Äì 1891 (for more than thirty years) * Georges Lefebvre ‚Äì 1937‚Äì1959 * Albert Soboul ‚Äì 1967‚Äì1982 * Michel Vovelle ‚Äì 1982 Revisionism and modern work \\"Revisionism\\" in this context means the rejection of the Orthodox/Marxist model of a revolution carried out by the bourgeoisie against the aristocracy on the right, with intervention from the proletariat pushing it to the left. J. B. Shank finds that 21st century trends include a broader range of topics regarding the effects of the Revolution, and a more global perspective. He cites heavy use of the Internet, resources such as the H-France daily discussion email list,See home page and use of digital sources to scan through massive amounts of text. =Cobban= In 1954, Alfred Cobban used his inaugural lecture as Professor of French History at the University of London to attack what he called the \\"social interpretation\\" of the French Revolution. The lecture was later published as \\"The Myth of the French Revolution\\", but his seminal work arguing this point was The Social Interpretation of the French Revolution (1963). It was published in French translation only in 1984. His main point was that feudalism had long since disappeared in France; that the Revolution did not transform French society, and that it was principally a political revolution, not a social one as Lefebvre and others insisted.A. Cobban, The Social Interpretation of the French Revolution (1963) Although dismissed and attacked by the mainstream journals at first, Cobban was persistent and determined, and his approach was soon supported and modified by a flood of new research both inside and outside France. American historian George V. Taylor's research established that the bourgeoisie of the Third Estate were not quite the budding capitalists they were made out to be; indeed Taylor showed the aristocrats were just as entrepreneurial if not more so. John McManners, Jean Egret, Franklin Ford and others wrote on the divided and complex situation of the nobility in pre- revolutionary France. The most significant opposition to arise in France was that of Annales historians Fran√ßois Furet, Denis Richet, and Mona Ozouf. Furet in the 1960s worked in terms of the Annales School, which locates the 1789 revolution in a \\"long\\" history of 19th century revolutionary France. =Cobb= Another seminal figure in the revisionism debate is the Francophile Englishman Richard Cobb, who has produced a number of immensely detailed studies of both provincial and city life, avoiding the revisionism debate by \\"keeping his nose very close to the ground\\".David Troyansky, review of Hunt's Politics, Culture, and Class. From The History Teacher, 20, 1 (November 1986), pp. 136‚Äì37 Les arm√©es r√©volutionnaires (1968, translated as The People's Armies in 1987) is his most famous work. =Doyle= William Doyle, professor at Bristol University, has published The Origins of the French Revolution (1988) and a revisionist history, The Oxford History of the French Revolution (2nd edition 2002). Another historian working in this tradition is Keith Michael Baker. A collection of his essays (Inventing the French Revolution, 1990) examines the ideological origins of the Revolution. =Tackett= Timothy Tackett in particular has changed approach, preferring archival research to historiographical dialectics. He challenges the ideas about nobility and bourgeoise in Becoming a Revolutionary (2006), a \\"collective biography\\" via letters and diaries of the third estate deputies of 1789. His other major work is When the King Took Flight (2004), a study of the rise of republicanism and radicalism in the Legislative Assembly in 1791/2. Tackett also has several works focusing on Reign of Terror, The Coming of the Terror in the French Revolution (2015), and the psychology behind the paranoia affecting the Committee of Public Safety during the Terror. These insights provide a deeper look into how and why this event happened. =Schama= Simon Schama's Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution (1989) is a popular, generally moderate/conservative history of the period. It is ostensibly a narrative of \\"Persons\\" and \\"Events\\", and more in the tradition of Carlyle than Tocqueville and Lefebvre.Simon Schama, \\"Prologue\\", Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution, Knopf, 1988 Its narrative- while massive- focuses on the most visible leaders of the Revolution, even through its more \\"popular\\" phases. The book's allegiance is to historical literary styles rather than schools. Thus Schama is simultaneously able to deny the existence of a so- called \\"bourgeois\\" revolution, reserve apotheoses for Robespierre, Louis XVI, and the sans-culottes alike, and utilize historical nuance to a degree usually associated with more liberal historians. Borrowing from the Romantics for imagery (the introduction closely follows that of Michelet's \\"History...\\"), \\"Citizens\\" also argues against the Romantics' belief in the necessity of the Revolution. Schama concentrates on the early years of the Revolution, the Republic only taking up about a fifth of the book. He also places increased emphasis on insurrectionary violence in Paris and violence in general, claiming that it was \\"not the unfortunate by-product of revolution, [but] the source of its energy.\\"Schama, Citizens, ch. 14 \\"September 1791 ‚Äì August 1792\\", p. iii \\"Marseillaise\\" =Hunt and feminism= Lynn Hunt, though often characterized as a feminist interpreter of the Revolution, is a historian working in the wake of the revisionists. Her major works include Politics, Culture, and Class in the French Revolution (1984), and The Family Romance of the French Revolution (1992), both interpretative works. The former focuses on the creation of a new democratic political culture from scratch, assigning the Revolution's greatest meaning here, in a political culture.William H. Sewell. Review of Politics, Culture, and Class in the French Revolution by Lynn Hunt. Theory and Society, 15, 6 (November 1986), pp. 915‚Äì17 In the latter study she works with a somewhat Freudian interpretation, the political Revolution as a whole being seen as an enormous dysfunctional family haunted by patricide: Louis as father, Marie-Antoinette as mother, and the revolutionaries as an unruly mob of brothers.Jeff Goodwin.

French Historical Studies, 19, 2 (Autumn 1995), pp. 261‚Äì76 =Furet= Fran√ßois Furet (1927‚Äì1997) was the leading figure in the rejection of the \\"classic\\" or \\"Marxist\\" interpretation. Desan (2000) concluded he \\"seemed to emerge the victor from the bicentennial, both in the media and in historiographic debates.\\"Suzanne Desan, \\"What's after Political Culture? Recent French Revolutionary Historiography,\\" French Historical Studies, Volume 23, Number 1, Winter 2000, pp. 163‚Äì96 in Project MUSE A disillusioned ex- Communist, he published his La R√©volution Fran√ßaise in 1965‚Äì66. It marked his transition from revolutionary leftist politics to liberal Left-center position, and reflected his ties to the social-science-oriented Annales School.Michael Scott Christofferson, \\"Fran√ßois Furet between History and Journalism, 1958‚Äì1965.\\" French History, December 2001, Vol. 15 Issue 4, pp. 421‚Äì47 He then moved to the right, re-examining the Revolution from the perspective of 20th century totalitarianism (as exemplified by Hitler and Stalin). His Penser la R√©volution Fran√ßaise (1978; translated as Interpreting the French Revolution 1981) was an influential book that led many intellectuals to reevaluate Communism and the Revolution as inherently totalitarian and anti-democratic. Looking at modern French Communism he stressed the close resemblance between the 1960s and 1790s, with both favoring the inflexible and rote ideological discourse in party cells where decisions were made unanimously in a manipulated direct democracy. Furet further suggested that popularity of the Far Left to many French intellectuals was itself a result of their commitment to the ideals of the French Revolution.Michael Scott Christofferson, \\"An Antitotalitarian History of the French Revolution: Francois Furet's Penser la Revolution francaise in the Intellectual Politics of the Late 1970s,\\" French Historical Studies, Volume 22, Number 4, Fall 1999, pp. 557‚Äì611 Working much of the year at the University of Chicago after 1979, Furet also rejected the Annales School, with its emphasis on very long-term structural factors, and emphasized intellectual history. Influenced by Alexis de Tocqueville and Augustin Cochin, Furet argues that Frenchmen must stop seeing the revolution as the key to all aspects of modern French history.James Friguglietti and Barry Rothaus, \\"Interpreting vs. Understanding the Revolution: Fran√ßois Furet and Albert Soboul,\\" Consortium on Revolutionary Europe 1750‚Äì1850: Proceedings, 1987, (1987) Vol. 17, pp. 23‚Äì36 His works include Interpreting the French Revolution (1981), a historiographical overview of what has preceded him and A Critical Dictionary of the French Revolution (1989).Claude Langlois, \\"Furet's Revolution,\\" French Historical Studies, Fall 1990, Vol. 16 Issue 4, pp. 766‚Äì76Donals Sutherland, \\"An Assessment of the Writings of Fran√ßois Furet,\\" French Historical Studies, Fall 1990, Vol. 16 Issue 4, pp 784‚Äì91 =Others= Some other modern historians include: * Marcel Gauchet (b. 1946) ‚Äì Author of La R√©volution des droits de l'homme (1989) and La R√©volution des pouvoirs (1995). * Patrice Higonnet ‚Äì Author of Goodness Beyond Virtue: Jacobins in the French Revolution (1998). * Owen Connelly (1924‚Äì2011) ‚Äì The French Revolution and Napoleonic Era (1993). * Henry Heller ‚Äì Author of \\"The Bourgeois Revolution in France: 1789‚Äì1815\\"; his work maintains a defence of the Classic (Marxist) Interpretation of the Revolution. * Olwen Hufton (b. 1938) ‚Äì Writes on women in history; her principal work on the Revolution is Women and the Limits of Citizenship in the French Revolution (1999). * Dale K.

Wieman, was able to synthesize the first Bose‚ÄìEinstein condensate in 1995. For their efforts, Cornell, Wieman, and Wolfgang Ketterle shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2001. Biography Cornell was born in Palo Alto, California, where his parents were completing graduate degrees at nearby Stanford University. Two years later he moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts, where his father was a professor of civil engineering at MIT. Here he grew up with his younger brother and sister, with yearlong intermezzos in Berkeley, California, and Lisbon, Portugal, where his father spent sabbatical years. In Cambridge he attended Cambridge Rindge and Latin School. The year before his graduation he moved back to California with his mother and finished high school at San Francisco's Lowell High School, a local magnet school for academically talented students. After high school he enrolled at Stanford University, where he was to meet his future wife, Celeste Landry. As an undergraduate he earned money as an assistant in the various low- temperature physics groups on campus. He was doing well both in his courses and his jobs in the labs and seemed set for a career in physics. He however doubted whether he wished to pursue such a career, or rather a different one in literature or politics. Halfway through his undergraduate years he went to China and Taiwan for nine months to volunteer teaching conversational English and to study Chinese. He learned that this was not where his talents lay, and returned to Stanford with renewed resolve to pursue his true talent ‚Äì physics. He graduated with honors and distinction in 1985. For graduate school he returned to MIT. There he joined David Pritchard's group, which had a running experiment that tried to measure the mass of the electron neutrino from the beta decay of tritium. Although he was unable to determine the mass of the neutrino, Cornell did obtain his PhD in 1990. After obtaining his doctorate he joined Carl Wieman at the University of Colorado Boulder as a postdoctoral researcher on a small laser cooling experiment. During his two years as a postdoc he came up with a plan to combine laser cooling and evaporative cooling in a magnetic trap to create a Bose‚ÄìEinstein condensate (BEC). Based on his proposal he was offered a permanent position at JILA/NIST in Boulder. For synthesizing the first Bose‚ÄìEinstein condensate in 1995, Cornell, Wieman, and Wolfgang Ketterle shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2001. He is currently a professor at the University of Colorado Boulder and a physicist at the United States Department of Commerce National Institute of Standards and Technology. His lab is located at JILA. He was awarded the Lorentz Medal in 1998 and is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2005. Award and honors Cornell received multiple awards including the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2001. * Ioannes Marcus Marci Medal for Molecular Spectroscopy, Ioannes Marcus Marci Spectroscopic Society, Czech Republic, 2012 * Fellow, American Academy of Arts & Sciences, 2005 * Nobel Prize in Physics 2001 * Member, National Academy of Sciences, 2000 * Fellow, Optical Society of America, Elected 2000 * R.

In October 2004, his left arm and shoulder were amputated in an attempt to stop the spread of necrotizing fasciitis.

Symptoms may include vomiting, personality changes, confusion, seizures, and loss of consciousness. Even though liver toxicity typically occurs, jaundice usually does not. Death occurs in 20‚Äì40% of those affected and about a third of those who survive are left with a significant degree of brain damage. The cause of Reye syndrome is unknown. It usually begins shortly after recovery from a viral infection, such as influenza or chickenpox. About 90% of cases in children are associated with aspirin (salicylate) use. Inborn errors of metabolism are also a risk factor. Changes on blood tests may include a high blood ammonia level, low blood sugar level, and prolonged prothrombin time. Often the liver is enlarged. Prevention is typically by avoiding the use of aspirin in children. When aspirin was withdrawn for use in children a decrease of more than 90% in rates of Reye syndrome was seen. Early diagnosis improves outcomes. Treatment is supportive. Mannitol may be used to help with the brain swelling. The first detailed description of Reye syndrome was in 1963 by Douglas Reye, an Australian pathologist. Children are most commonly affected. It affects fewer than one in a million children a year. The general recommendation to use aspirin in children was withdrawn because of Reye syndrome, with use of aspirin only recommended in Kawasaki disease. Signs and symptoms Reye syndrome progresses through five stages: * Stage I ** Rash on palms of hands and feet ** Persistent, heavy vomiting that is not relieved by not eating ** Generalized lethargy ** Confusion ** Nightmares ** No fever usually present ** Headaches * Stage II **Stupor ** Hyperventilation ** Fatty liver (found on biopsy) ** Hyperactive reflexes * Stage III ** Continuation of Stage I and II symptoms ** Possible coma ** Possible cerebral edema ** Rarely, respiratory arrest * Stage IV ** Deepening coma ** Dilated pupils with minimal response to light ** Minimal but still present liver dysfunction * Stage V ** Very rapid onset following stage IV ** Deep coma ** Seizures ** Multiple organ failure ** Flaccidity ** Hyperammonemia (above 300 mg/dL of blood) ** Death Causes The cause of Reye syndrome is unknown. It usually begins shortly after recovery from a viral infection, such as influenza or chickenpox. About 90% of cases in children are associated with aspirin (salicylate) use. Inborn errors of metabolism are also a risk factor. The association with aspirin has been shown through epidemiological studies. The diagnosis of \\"Reye Syndrome\\" greatly decreased in the 1980s, when genetic testing for inborn errors of metabolism was becoming available in developed countries. A retrospective study of 49 survivors of cases diagnosed as \\"Reye's Syndrome\\" showed that the majority of the surviving patients had various metabolic disorders, particularly a fatty-acid oxidation disorder medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency. = Aspirin = There is an association between taking aspirin for viral illnesses and the development of Reye syndrome, but no animal model of Reye syndrome has been developed in which aspirin causes the condition. The serious symptoms of Reye syndrome appear to result from damage to cellular mitochondria, at least in the liver, and there are a number of ways that aspirin could cause or exacerbate mitochondrial damage. A potential increased risk of developing Reye syndrome is one of the main reasons that aspirin has not been recommended for use in children and teenagers, the age group for which the risk of lasting serious effects is highest. In some countries, oral mouthcare product Bonjela (not the form specifically designed for teething) has labeling cautioning against its use in children, given its salicylate content. There have been no cases of Reye syndrome following its use, and the measure is a precaution. Other medications containing salicylates are often similarly labeled as a precaution. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the U.S. Surgeon General, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommend that aspirin and combination products containing aspirin not be given to children under 19 years of age during episodes of fever-causing illnesses. Hence, in the United States, it is advised that the opinion of a doctor or pharmacist should be obtained before anyone under 19 years of age is given any medication containing aspirin (also known on some medicine labels as acetylsalicylate, salicylate, acetylsalicylic acid, ASA, or salicylic acid). Current advice in the United Kingdom by the Committee on Safety of Medicines is that aspirin should not be given to those under the age of 16 years, unless specifically indicated in Kawasaki disease or in the prevention of blood clot formation. Diagnosis =Differential diagnosis= Causes for similar symptoms include * Various inborn metabolic disorders * Viral encephalitis * Drug overdose or poisoning * Head trauma * Liver failure due to other causes * Meningitis * Kidney failure * Shaken baby syndrome Treatment Treatment is supportive. Mannitol may be used to help with the brain swelling. Prognosis Documented cases of Reye syndrome in adults are rare. The recovery of adults with the syndrome is generally complete, with liver and brain function returning to normal within two weeks of onset. In children, mild to severe permanent brain damage is possible, especially in infants. Over thirty percent of the cases reported in the United States from 1981 through 1997 resulted in fatality.  Epidemiology  Reye syndrome occurs almost exclusively in children. While a few adult cases have been reported over the years, these cases do not typically show permanent neural or liver damage. Unlike in the United Kingdom, the surveillance for Reye syndrome in the United States is focused on people under 18 years of age. In 1980, after the CDC began cautioning physicians and parents about the association between Reye syndrome and the use of salicylates in children with chickenpox or virus-like illnesses, the incidence of Reye syndrome in the United States began to decline, prior to the FDA's issue of warning labels on aspirin in 1986. In the United States between 1980 and 1997, the number of reported cases of Reye syndrome decreased from 555 cases in 1980 to about two cases per year since 1994. During this time period 93% of reported cases for which racial data were available occurred in whites and the median age was six years. In 93% of cases a viral illness had occurred in the preceding three-week period. For the period 1991‚Äì1994, the annual rate of hospitalizations due to Reye syndrome in the United States was estimated to be between 0.2 and 1.1 per million population less than 18 years of age. During the 1980s, a case-control study carried out in the United Kingdom also demonstrated an association between Reye syndrome and aspirin exposure. In June 1986, the United Kingdom Committee on Safety of Medicines issued warnings against the use of aspirin in children under 12 years of age and warning labels on aspirin-containing medications were introduced. United Kingdom surveillance for Reye syndrome documented a decline in the incidence of the illness after 1986. The reported incidence rate of Reye syndrome decreased from a high of 0.63 per 100,000 population less than 12 years of age in 1983‚Äì1984 to 0.11 in 1990‚Äì1991. From November 1995 to November 1996 in France, a national survey of pediatric departments for children under 15 years of age with unexplained encephalopathy and a threefold (or greater) increase in serum aminotransferase and/or ammonia led to the identification of nine definite cases of Reye syndrome (0.79 cases per million children). Eight of the nine children with Reye syndrome were found to have been exposed to aspirin. In part because of this survey result, the French Medicines Agency reinforced the international attention to the relationship between aspirin and Reye syndrome by issuing its own public and professional warnings about this relationship.  History  The syndrome is named after Douglas Reye, who, along with fellow physicians Graeme Morgan and Jim Baral, published the first study of the syndrome in 1963 in The Lancet. In retrospect, the occurrence of the syndrome may have first been reported in 1929. Also in 1964, George Johnson and colleagues published an investigation of an outbreak of influenza B that described 16 children who developed neurological problems, four of whom had a profile remarkably similar to Reye syndrome. Some investigators refer to this disorder as Reye-Johnson syndrome, although it is more commonly called Reye syndrome. In 1979, Karen Starko and colleagues conducted a case-control study in Phoenix, Arizona, and found the first statistically-significant link between aspirin use and Reye syndrome. Studies in Ohio and Michigan soon confirmed her findings pointing to the use of aspirin during an upper respiratory tract or chickenpox infection as a possible trigger of the syndrome. Beginning in 1980, the CDC cautioned physicians and parents about the association between Reye syndrome and the use of salicylates in children and teenagers with chickenpox or virus-like illnesses. In 1982 the U.S. Surgeon General issued an advisory, and in 1986 the Food and Drug Administration required a Reye syndrome-related warning label for all aspirin-containing medications.

I-705 serves as the connector between I-5, Downtown Tacoma, Tacoma's waterfront, North Tacoma, and the Tacoma Dome. I-705 was the last new portion of the Interstate Highway System to be constructed in Washington, having opened in 1988. Route description The Tacoma Spur begins as a continuation of State Route 7 (SR 7) underneath I-5 in Tacoma, and has a posted speed limit of for the entire length (). Traveling northbound as a continuation of SR 7, the first exit is for South 26th Street, which provides access to the Tacoma Dome, and the Tacoma Dome transit hub and Amtrak station. A single-point urban interchange (SPUI) with SR 509 (South 21st Street) provides access to the University of Washington Tacoma campus, as well as the Port of Tacoma via the East 21st Street Bridge. The left two lanes of I-705 separate, providing access to A Street, as well as South 15th Street / Pacific Avenue, however travelers merging onto northbound I-705 can not access this exit. The Bridge of Glass, linking the Museum of Glass on the shorefront to downtown Tacoma, passes over I-705 as it continues north, paralleling the Thea Foss Waterway to the east, and Firemans Park to the west. A signalled at-grade intersection with Stadium Way marks the end of I-705 northbound. Traveling southbound towards I-5, I-705 begins with on ramps from Stadium Way South and from Schuster Parkway. Passing Firemans Park on the south, traffic from South 9th Street and A Street merge onto I-705. Traffic coming from Bates Technical College and South 13th Street join the freeway, as well as traffic from South A Street. A SPUI with SR 509 (South 21st Street) is the only exit in Tacoma, before either exiting onto I-5 southbound towards Portland, Oregon, I-5 northbound towards Seattle and Vancouver, British Columbia, or onto SR 7. Every year the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of annual average daily traffic (AADT), which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 2011, WSDOT calculated that as few as 26,000 cars used the spur at the continuation point from SR 7, and as many as 72,000 cars between the onramp from I-5 and SR 509. The entire Tacoma Spur is listed on both the WSDOT List of Highways of Statewide Significance, which marks the highway as a critical to connecting major communities in the state, and the National Highway System, a system of roads that are important to the nation's economy, defense and mobility. History I-705 northbound approaching SR 509 The opening of Interstate 5 and the Tacoma Mall in 1965 caused a reduction in the number of retailers in Downtown Tacoma, which was only accessible via local streets from the freeway. The lost business, combined with worsening congestion in Downtown Tacoma, prompted downtown retailers to ask the state government for an improved connection to Interstate 5. The state Department of Highways began studying a freeway connection between the Pacific Avenue Interchange (where SR 7 terminates) and Downtown Tacoma in 1955, recommending a temporary one-way couplet that became part of SR 509 and an eventual freeway link. In 1968, the Department of Highways adopted the routing of a freeway into Downtown Tacoma along the western side of the City Waterway, to be constructed over railroad right of way. The project, then part of a new freeway corridor for State Route 509 through the Port of Tacoma, was approved by the Tacoma City Council in 1971, but further planning was suspended at the time due to funding issues. In 1978, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) approved the designation of the Tacoma Spur as Interstate 705. The Federal Highway Administration had tentatively numbered the route as \\"Interstate 105\\", but the Washington State Department of Transportation had requested the use of \\"705\\" as it would not conflict with existing state highways. The Washington State Legislature approved the addition of Interstate 705 into the state highway system in April 1979. While funding was identified in the 1970s, construction on the freeway was not completed until the next decade because of federal budget cuts. I-705 was dedicated on October 17, 1988, with a parade and ribbon-cutting; the freeway cost $102.3 million to construct and was the last new Interstate to be completed in the state of Washington. The Tacoma City Council in 1992 proposed to name the freeway Martin Luther King Way, however that name was finally applied to nearby K Street. Work on the single-point urban interchange, costing $29.4 million (equivalent to $ million in ), was completed in 1993 to accommodate the changes that were made to SR 509 through Tacoma.

The brain can thus be described as being divided into left and right cerebral hemispheres. Each of these hemispheres has an outer layer of grey matter, the cerebral cortex, that is supported by an inner layer of white matter. In eutherian (placental) mammals, the hemispheres are linked by the corpus callosum, a very large bundle of nerve fibers. Smaller commissures, including the anterior commissure, the posterior commissure and the fornix, also join the hemispheres and these are also present in other vertebrates. These commissures transfer information between the two hemispheres to coordinate localized functions. There are three known poles of the cerebral hemispheres: the occipital pole, the frontal pole, and the temporal pole. The central sulcus is a prominent fissure which separates the parietal lobe from the frontal lobe and the primary motor cortex from the primary somatosensory cortex. Macroscopically the hemispheres are roughly mirror images of each other, with only subtle differences, such as the Yakovlevian torque seen in the human brain, which is a slight warping of the right side, bringing it just forward of the left side. On a microscopic level, the cytoarchitecture of the cerebral cortex, shows the functions of cells, quantities of neurotransmitter levels and receptor subtypes to be markedly asymmetrical between the hemispheres. However, while some of these hemispheric distribution differences are consistent across human beings, or even across some species, many observable distribution differences vary from individual to individual within a given species.  Structure  Each cerebral hemisphere has an outer layer of cerebral cortex which is of grey matter and in the interior of the cerebral hemispheres is an inner layer or core of white matter known as the centrum semiovale. The interior portion of the hemispheres of the cerebrum includes the lateral ventricles, the basal ganglia, and the white matter. =Poles= Poles of cerebral hemispheres There are three poles of the cerebrum, the occipital pole, the frontal pole, and the temporal pole. The occipital pole is the posterior end of each occipital lobe in each hemisphere. It is more pointed than the rounder frontal pole. The frontal pole is at the frontmost part of the frontal lobe in each hemisphere, and is more rounded than the occipital pole. The temporal pole is located between the frontal and occipital poles, and sits in the anterior part of middle cranial fossa in each temporal lobe.  Composition  If the upper part of either hemisphere is removed, at a level about 1.25 cm above the corpus callosum, the central white matter will be exposed as an oval-shaped area, the centrum semiovale, surrounded by a narrow convoluted margin of gray substance, and studded with numerous minute red dots (puncta vasculosa), produced by the escape of blood from divided blood vessels. If the remaining portions of the hemispheres be slightly drawn apart a broad band of white substance, the corpus callosum, will be observed, connecting them at the bottom of the longitudinal fissure; the margins of the hemispheres which overlap the corpus callosum are called the labia cerebri. Each labium is part of the cingulate gyrus already described; and the groove between it and the upper surface of the corpus callosum is termed the callosal sulcus. If the hemispheres are sliced off to a level with the upper surface of the corpus callosum, the white substance of that structure will be seen connecting the two hemispheres. The large expanse of medullary matter now exposed, surrounded by the convoluted margin of gray substance, is called the centrum semiovale. The blood supply to the centrum semiovale is from the superficial middle cerebral artery. The cortical branches of this artery descend to provide blood to the centrum semiovale. =Development= The cerebral hemispheres are derived from the telencephalon. They arise five weeks after conception as bilateral invaginations of the walls. The hemispheres grow round in a C-shape and then back again, pulling all structures internal to the hemispheres (such as the ventricles) with them. The intraventricular foramina (also called the foramina of Monro) allows communication with the lateral ventricles. The choroid plexus is formed from ependymal cells and vascular mesenchyme. Function =Hemisphere lateralization= Broad generalizations are often made in popular psychology about certain functions (e.g. logic, creativity) being lateralized, that is, located in the right or left side of the brain. These claims are often inaccurate, as most brain functions are actually distributed across both hemispheres. Most scientific evidence for asymmetry relates to low-level perceptual functions rather than the higher-level functions popularly discussed (e.g. subconscious processing of grammar, not \\"logical thinking\\" in general).Western et al. 2006 \\"Psychology: Australian and New Zealand edition\\" John Wiley p.107\\"Neuromyth 6\\" http://www.oecd.org/document/63/0,3746,en_2649_35845581_34555007_1_1_1_1,00.html Retrieved October 15, 2011. In addition to this lateralization of some functions, the low-level representations also tend to represent the contralateral side of the body. The best example of an established lateralization is that of Broca's and Wernicke's Areas (language) where both are often found exclusively on the left hemisphere. These areas frequently correspond to handedness however, meaning the localization of these areas is regularly found on the hemisphere opposite to the dominant hand. Function lateralization such as semantics, prosodic, intonation, accentuation, prosody, etc. has since been called into question and largely been found to have a neuronal basis in both hemispheres.Weiss, Peter H., and Simon D. Ubben. \\"Where Language Meets Meaningful Action: A Combined Behavior and Lesion.\\" Springer. 29 Oct. 2014. Web. 31 Mar. 2016.Ri√®s, Stephanie K., and Nina F. Dronkers. \\"Choosing Words: Left Hemisphere, Right Hemisphere, or Both? Perspective on the Lateralization of Word Retrieval.\\"Wiley Online Library. 14 Jan. 2016. Web. 31 Mar. 2016. Cerebral hemispheres of a human embryo at 8 weeks. Perceptual information is processed in both hemispheres, but is laterally partitioned: information from each side of the body is sent to the opposite hemisphere (visual information is partitioned somewhat differently, but still lateralized). Similarly, motor control signals sent out to the body also come from the hemisphere on the opposite side. Thus, hand preference (which hand someone prefers to use) is also related to hemisphere lateralization. In some aspects, the hemispheres are asymmetrical; the right side is slightly bigger. There are higher levels of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine on the right and higher levels of dopamine on the left. There is more white matter (longer axons) on the right and more grey matter (cell bodies) on the left.R. Carter, Mapping the Mind, Phoenix, London, 2004, Originally Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1998. Linear reasoning functions of language such as grammar and word production are often lateralized to the left hemisphere of the brain. In contrast, holistic reasoning functions of language such as intonation and emphasis are often lateralized to the right hemisphere of the brain. Other integrative functions such as intuitive or heuristic arithmetic, binaural sound localization, etc. seem to be more bilaterally controlled. Clinical significance Infarcts of the centrum ovale can occur. As a treatment for epilepsy the corpus callosum may be severed to cut the major connection between the hemispheres in a procedure known as a corpus callosotomy. A hemispherectomy is the removal or disabling of one of the hemispheres of the brain. This is a rare procedure used in some extreme cases of seizures which are unresponsive to other treatments.

Heinlein. It was written in 1938 and published for the first time in 2003. Heinlein admirer and science fiction author Spider Robinson titled his introductory essay \\"RAH DNA\\", as he believes this first, unpublished novel formed the DNA of Heinlein's later works. The novel's manuscript was lost when biographer Robert James traced down references to it. His research led to its rediscovery in a box left in a garage. Heinlein had apparently sent it to an earlier biographer, Leon Stover.The finding and publishing of \\"For Us, the Living\\" Plot summary Perry Nelson, a normal 1939 engineer and Navy Pilot, is driving his automobile when he has a blowout, skids over a cliff, and wakes up in the year 2086. Though he was apparently killed in the summer, he re-appears in extremely cold snow, nearly dies again by freezing, and is saved by a fur-clad woman named Diana. The exact circumstances of his being killed and reborn after a century and half are never explained. The later 21st Century people seem strangely incurious, showing little interest in how he had come to be among them and rather take his appearance for granted and proceed to explain to him the details of the social and political set-up of their world. Background The book is akin more to a lecture series than a novelSpider Robinson. A number of people have remarked on its resemblance to H. G. Wells' The Shape of Things to Come where the sleeper wakes into pseudo-utopia. The character Diana's background is clarified in a multiple-page footnote from the author. The future society has a version of a Social Credit structure with a central government run bank exclusively controlling the monetary supply to prevent overproduction and remaining private banks prohibited from lending money they do not actually have on hand and which had been explicitly designated for investment risk. The book does not tell precisely how the protagonist came to wake up a century and a half after being killed in a car accident, and find himself wandering in the snow in the body of a denizen of the future who had had enough of life and chose to commit suicide. It is mentioned that his last sight before crashing down and getting killed was a girl in a green bathing suit who had the same face as the Diana which he meets in the future; it turns out that her name had been Diana, too, and that to her fell the disagreeable task of finding Perry's broken body and reporting the accident. There is the clear implication that the later Diana was an avatar or reincarnation of the earlier one, but this is not stated explicitly. As noted by reviewer Nancy Green, this aspect of the book gives the impression of a draft which Heinlein intended to further work on, but never did.Article in \\"Science Fiction Review\\", August 2009 Connections to other Heinlein works Appearing already in this early stage of Heinlein's career is the fanatic and dictatorial religious leader Nehemiah Scudder. However, in Heinlein's later Future History Scudder succeeds in getting elected President and establishing a theocratic dictatorship dominating the U.S. for most of the 21st century. Conversely, in For Us, The Living, Scudder does establish for several years a de facto domination over the Mississippi Valley, and terrorizes much of the rest of the country by Ku Klux Klan‚Äìtype thugs‚Äîbut he is stopped at the last moment by the counter- mobilization of libertarians, and despite mass voter intimidation carries only Tennessee and Alabama. In fact, the new regime seen in full bloom in the book's 2086 came into being in direct reaction to Scudder's attempt to impose Puritanical mores on the entire American society‚Äîfor example, the complete abolition of the nudity taboo, which is an important aspect of the book's plot. The abolition of the taboo on public nudity would re-appear as a major issue in Heinlein's The Puppet Masters‚Äîthough under radically different circumstances to those in the present book. A major difference between the time line of For Us, The Living and Heinlein's later Future History is the time when space exploration begins. In the Future History, Heinlein assumed that long before the end of the 20th century an extensive human exploration and colonization would take place all over the Solar System; the same assumption was made also in other works not fitting into the Future History's framework. However, in his earlier book dealt with here, Heinlein was far more cautious, placing the first circumlunar flight (not yet an actual landing) only in 2089. Ward Carson wrote: \\"In For Us, The Living, space colonization waits until the end of the Twenty-First Century and Scudder is defeated; in the Future History it happens a century earlier and Scudder takes over the US. Heinlein made no explicit remark on this, but a causal connection could be made: in the Future History the bold individualistic Americans emigrated into space in the end of the Twentieth Century, and were not present in America to stop it from falling into the fanatic's hands\\".Ward G. Carson, \\"The Formative Years of Science Fiction\\" in Ed Woods (ed.) Round Table on Speculative Literature, London, 2008 Concepts and themes =The Second World War= At the time of writing, there was already a widespread expectation of a new war breaking out in Europe in the near future, and Heinlein followed this assumption. However, in the book's timeline the US stays out of the war, and it ends due to Germany's economic collapse rather than its military defeat (similar to the scenario given in H. G. Wells' The Shape of Things to Come, four years before). Heinlein did correctly predict that Adolf Hitler would end up committing suicide, once his schemes of conquest collapsed. The timeline depicted in the book does not include a war between the US and Japan. However, in the context of a later war there is a depiction of Latin American aircraft carriers launching a devastating surprise attack on New York City, which bears some similarities to the methods which the Japanese would use at Pearl Harbor three years after the book was written. Heinlein, a former naval officer, clearly understood the strategic implications of the carriers' appearance and the revolution they would bring to naval warfare. The recently abdicated King Edward VIII of the UK is very positively presented, his romantic image as \\"the King who gave up his throne for love\\" not yet, at the time of writing, tainted by pro-Nazi associations. In Heinlein's projected future, Edward returns to England at the outbreak of war and distinguishes himself in wartime service. After the war a European Federation is formed and Edward is made into a Constitutional Emperor of Europe, a task which he fulfills with great success. However, he dies without issue in 1970 (two years earlier than in actual history) and in the aftermath Europe is torn up in forty years of highly destructive war and is largely depopulated. =Secularism= As could be expected of a regime born directly of secular opposition to a religious fanatic's violent attempt to set up a Theocracy, the regime depicted in the book has a clearly Secularist inclination. All organized religious groups are defined as \\"sects\\", including what were considered \\"Churches\\" at the time of writing (and still are at present). Such religious themes as \\"the conspicuous depiction of a person suffering in great pain\\" (i.e. a crucifix) or the \\"wild aggressive behavior of ancient barbaric tribes\\" (i.e. the ancient Hebrews as depicted in the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament) is greatly frowned upon. While religious education is not outright forbidden, all youths typically undergo a minimum of two years at a \\"development center\\" (a kind of boarding school) where education is completely secular. An option for parents refusing to let their children have such an experience is to go to Coventry where they could do as they wish, and some \\"sects\\" have done exactly that, to their last member. In this, Heinlein's vision of the future could be considered a watered-down version of that in Wells's The Shape of Things to Come where determined reformers completely suppress all organized religion for the explicit purpose of gaining a complete monopoly over education. =President Roosevelt= The book‚Äîwritten in the aftermath of the Democrats' heavy losses in the 1938 mid-term elections‚Äîassumes that by 1938‚Äì39 Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal had failed due to the constant attacks by his opponents, that in the 1940 election, Roosevelt would prove unelectable, that his downfall would drag the Democratic Party to ruin and that a sharp drift to the Right would culminate in an extreme-right dictatorship in the late 1940s‚Äîwhich would, however, prove short-lived and after which the pendulum would swing sharply to the Left again. Heinlein assigned to Fiorello H. La Guardia‚Äîat the time of writing a reformer Mayor of New York and outspoken supporter of Roosevelt, despite being nominally a Republican‚Äîthe role of picking up FDR's torch, as a militant reforming President in the 1950s who would lead a head-on confrontation with the banking system, effectively nationalize the banks and institute the system of Social Credit. Several decades later, a John Delano Roosevelt is mentioned among the six highly regarded reformers who revise the US Constitution and institute the new regime seen in 2086. =Economic independence= At a number of points in For Us, the Living, Heinlein describes an environment in which individuals are able to choose whether or not to accept a job. Passing references are made to the large number of individuals who take up art or other careers that traditionally do not pay well. The book also points out the short working hours and high wages paid to employees. The book ascribes this flexible working environment to the social credit system (the \\"Dividend\\") adopted by the United States which provides enough new capital in the economic system to overcome the problems of overproduction while providing a guaranteed minimal income for all members of society. For Us, the Living also depicts an early example of homesourcing in fiction. The character of Diana, a nationally renowned dancer, is shown performing in her own home for a broadcast audience, which sees her dancing on sets added by the broadcasting company to her original feed. The mechanism for this homesourcing is not described in much technical detail, but it appears to be similar to a high-definition video signal interfaced with something like modern chroma key technology. The biggest economic impact in the book, however, is Heinlein's Social Credit system, that he takes many pains to explain: the Heritage Check System, an alternative form of government funding, in place of taxation. The heritage check system is a moderately altered Social Credit system. Its modification reflects Heinlein's more libertarian views and Heinlein's interpretation on how financial systems are affected by the relationship between consumption and production.James, Robert, PhD, \\"Afterword\\", in For Us, the Living, by Robert Heinlein, Simon & Schuster, 2003 The system could be construed as a libertarian's approach to a socialist idea, creating an alternative to a tax system that puts fewer requirements on individuals, while simultaneously providing more for the common welfare. This is not too surprising, as Heinlein (a proclaimed libertarian) was also fascinated by Social Credit plan that appeared in Canada in the 1930s. In this role, the government becomes less a part of the economy and more a facilitator of it. The Heritage System in \\"For Us, the Living\\" can be summarized by four major actions: # A required end to fractional reserve banking. Banks must always have a 100% reserve for any loan they give out. # New money is printed only by the government, and then, only enough to counteract the natural deflation that would occur in a system without fractional reserve banking. # The government uses this money (and only this money), divided among all of its necessary roles. Any extra is divided evenly among citizens and businesses that over-produce, to offset the loss of not selling their over-production (the government buying the over-production for its own use, which can be bought by citizens later if they so desire at the same price.) # Goods bought by the government are later sold by the government (or used by it), and normal governmental services (such as postage) are sold. These goods and services provide the standard backing for the currency, similar to how gold is used to back the gold standard.Sewell, Thomas, \\"Featured Review: For Us, The Living: A Comedy of Customs ‚Äì A Young Heinlein tries for Utopia, but fails\\" , Books Under Review, retrieved 21 March 2013 Dealing with government funding in this way is theorized to stabilize an economy, and deals with the production/consumption problem that Heinlein claims to exist with more conventional economic systems: :\\"A production cycle creates exactly enough purchasing power for its consumption cycle. If any part of this potential purchasing is not used for consumption but instead is invested in new production, it appears as a cost charge in the new items of production, before it re-appears as new purchasing power. Therefore, it causes a net loss of purchasing power in the earlier cycle. Therefore, an equal amount of new money is required by the country.\\" In addition to stabilizing the economy, it is theorized to have the added benefit of being a system where Federal taxes would not be needed for Government function, and only be needed for regulatory measures (e.g. enforcing environmental standards, corporations being taxed for not meeting government requirements, tariffs that exist purely to discourage buying from certain locations, wealth redistribution, etc.) The system also makes note of the fact that government spending and government taxing are not only not related, both can happen in the complete absence of the other (especially in a heritage check system), and that as far as market effect, taxing causes deflation and Government spending causes inflation. He notes this, and that as a result, the value of money can be completely and totally controlled, making the currency as stable as it is desired to be. =Social and governmental= For Us, the Living also depicts graphically the transition between the society that Perry left in 1939 and how it is transformed through a series of acts by the Government. Of specific note is the \\"War Voting Act\\". In this act, if the United States wished to engage in armed conflict with any other country, a national referendum was required to be held. Voting on a war is limited to citizens eligible for military service and not currently in the military. In the event that the article was passed and the country was to go to war, those who had voted for war were the first to be enlisted in the armed forces, those who did not vote were the second group conscripted, and those who voted \\"No\\" were the third group. Heinlein states that in the history of the \\"War Voting Act\\", the process had been enacted three times, and all three times the entire citizenry were actively engaged in very vocal debate as to whether the conflict was warranted. All three times, he states, the measures to go to war were defeated. After the transition has been completed, the social norms of the society are effectively transformed. One of the most pervasive, is the distinction between \\"public sphere\\" and \\"private sphere\\". The society as a whole respects privacy in what are considered private sphere events, such as intimacy, closeness, interpersonal relationships and even identity in business and governmental transactions. As there is a great deal of information in the society, this becomes rather critical in moving the society toward a point away from information fetishism and toward a society where persons have respect for one another's privacy and work as a society for the betterment of all.

He first came to notice, working for Cerruti and then for many others, including Allegri, Bagutta and Hilton. He formed his company, Armani, in 1975, which eventually diversified into music, sport and luxury hotels. By 2001 Armani was acclaimed as the most successful designer of Italian origin, and is credited with pioneering red-carpet fashion. Early years Armani was born in the northern Italian town of Piacenza, where he was raised with his older brother Sergio and younger sister Rosanna by his mother Maria Raimondi and father Ugo Armani (an accountant for a transport company). While at secondary school at the Liceo Scientifico Leonardo Da Vinci in Milan, Armani aspired to a career in medicine, particularly after reading A. J. Cronin's The Citadel. He enrolled in the Department of Medicine at the University of Milan, but after three years, in 1953, he left and joined the army. Due to his medical background, he was assigned to the Military Hospital in Verona, where he would attend shows at the Arena. He eventually decided to look for a different career path. Design career After his stint in the armed forces, Armani found a job as a window dresser at La Rinascente, a department store in Milan in 1957. He went on to become a seller for the menswear department, in which capacity he gained valuable experience in the marketing aspect of the fashion industry. In the mid-1960s, Armani moved to the Nino Cerruti company, where he designed menswear. His skills were in demand, and for the next decade, while continuing to work for Cerutti, Armani also freelanced, contributing designs to as many as ten manufacturers at a time. In the late 1960s, Armani met Sergio Galeotti, an architectural draftsman, which marked the beginning of a personal and professional relationship that lasted for many years. In 1973, Galeotti persuaded him to open a design office in Milan, at 37 Corso Venezia. This led to a period of extensive collaboration, during which Armani worked as a freelance designer for a number of fashion houses, including Allegri, Bagutta, Hilton, Sicons, Gib√≤, Montedoro, and Tendresse. The international press was quick to acknowledge Armani's importance following the runway shows at the Sala Bianca in the Pitti Palace in Florence. The experience provided Armani with an opportunity to develop his own style in new ways. He was now ready to devote his energy to his own label, and on July 24, 1975 he founded Giorgio Armani S.p.A. in Milan, with his friend Galeotti. In October of that same year, he presented his first collection of men's ready-to-wear for Spring and Summer 1976 under his own name. He also produced a women's line for the same season. Giorgio Armani in 2009 Armani established an innovative relationship with the fashion industry, characterized by the 1978 agreement with Gruppo Finanzario Tessile (GFT), which made it possible to produce luxury ready-to-wear in a manufacturing environment under the attentive supervision of the company's designer. In 1979, after founding the Giorgio Armani Corporation, Armani began producing for the United States and introduced the Main line for men and women. The label became one of the leading names in international fashion with the introduction of several new product lines, including G. A. Le Collezioni, Giorgio Armani Underwear and Swimwear, and Giorgio Armani Accessories. In the early 1980s the company signed an important agreement with L'Or√©al to create perfumes and introduced the Armani Junior, Armani Jeans, and Emporio Armani lines, followed in 1982 by the introduction of Emporio Underwear, Swimwear, and Accessories. A new store was opened in Milan for the Emporio line, followed by the first Giorgio Armani boutique. Armani's concern for the end user culminated in the development of a more youthful product with the same level of stylistic quality as his high-end line, but at a more accessible price. Because of the democratic nature of the Emporio line, Armani felt that he had to make use of new and unconventional advertising methods. These included television spots and enormous street ads, together with a house magazine that was sent out by mail to consumers, faithful Armani Eagle wearers. Armani also felt that a relationship with the cinema was essential, both for promotional reasons and for the stimulus to creativity. He designed the costumes for American Gigolo (1980), the success of which led to a long-term collaboration with the world of film. Armani designed costumes for more than one hundred films, one of the most important of which was The Untouchables (1987). In 1983 the designer modified his agreement with GFT. They began to produce both the Mani line for the United States and his high-end ready-to-wear line, rechristened Borgonuovo 21, after the address of the company's headquarters. During the late 1980s, despite Galeotti's death in 1985, Armani continued to expand commercial horizons and licensing agreements. He opened Armani Japan and introduced a line of eyeglasses (1988), socks (1987), a gift collection (1989), and a new \\"basic\\" men's and women's line for America known as A/X Armani Exchange (1991). After the frenetic expansion of the 1990s (sportswear, watches, eyeglasses, cosmetics, home, and new accessories collections), 2000, the twenty-fifth anniversary of the brand, saw a flurry of investment activity, including stock sales and the acquisition of new manufacturing capacity intended to increase Armani's control over the quality and distribution of his products. Armani's men's and women's skiwear and ski casualwear line was developed in 1995. His 1991 project, A/X: Armani Exchange, represented Armani's attempt to break into the American mass market, offering lower prices for relaxed chic clothes. Giorgio Armani, in September 1997 In 1996 his long-time friend Eric Clapton composed songs for Armani's fashion shows and has since dressed in Armani. Later that year Clapton opened two Emporio Armani stores in New York City.Eric Clapton Tourdates 1996 Where's Eric! In 1998 Armani hosted a party for Clapton's Crossroads guitar auction.Eric Clapton My Life ‚Äì The Autubiography He also prepared to break into the Chinese market by opening up his first store in that country in 1998. The small shop in Beijing was followed by a flagship store in Shanghai in 2004 and plans for 40 by 2011. In 2000, Giorgio Armani SpA was introducing new lines of cosmetics and home furnishings, and expanding its line of accessories. At the same time, the Guggenheim Museum in New York hosted an exhibition of Armani's work ‚Äì a first for a living designer ‚Äì with average attendance of 29,000 a week. In 2008, Armani designed the bullfighting costume, called the \\"Goyesco\\", worn by Spanish bullfighter Cayetano Rivera Ord√≥√±ez at the \\"Corrida Goyesca\\" in Ronda, Spain. They have also collaborated on several fashion shows and other events. As of 2009, Armani has a retail network of 60 Giorgio Armani boutiques, 11 Collezioni, 122 Emporio Armani, 94 A/X Armani Exchange, 1 Giorgio Armani Accessori, and 13 Armani Junior stores spread over 37 different countries. He has an annual turnover of $1.6 billion and a personal fortune of $8.1 billion as of 2017. In 2001 Armani was acclaimed as the most successful designer of Italian origin. Innovations Armani is credited with pioneering red-carpet fashion. Armani was the first designer to ban models with a body mass index (BMI) under 18, after model Ana Carolina Reston starved herself to death due to anorexia nervosa. Armani broadcast his collection live on the Internet, the first in the world of haute couture, on 24 January 2007. The Armani Priv√© Spring/Summer 2007 fashion show was broadcast via MSN and Cingular cellular phones. After LG teamed with Prada to introduce the LG Prada phone, Samsung joined Armani to design the Giorgio Armani phone. Armani has designed many stage outfits for pop superstar Lady Gaga, including those worn on her record-breaking Monster Ball Tour and Born This Way Ball Tour. He has also designed for many high- profile award shows, such as the 52nd Grammy Awards and the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards.  Armani Hotel Collection  Giorgio Armani and Emaar Properties PJSC signed an agreement in 2005 for Emaar Properties PJSC to build and operate at least seven luxury hotels and three vacation resorts under the Giorgio Armani name. Giorgio Armani would be responsible for overseeing all aspects of the interior design and style of the hotels. The Armani Hotel was opened in Burj Khalifa on April 27, 2010, comprising the bottom 39 floors of the supertall skyscraper in Dubai, United Arab Emirates; it has 160 guest rooms and suites, and 144 residences. Giorgio Armani is also designing the interiors of the Armani Residences, also within the skyscraper, and its specially designed line of products from the Armani/Casa home furnishings collection. Music Armani Musica presents Emporio Armani Caff√® compilations, a series of special CD compilations curated by Giorgio Armani with dj-sound designer Matteo Ceccarini, offering an eclectic mix of conceptual sounds and underground rhythms. Sport Giorgio Armani ‚Äì Vogue Fashion's Night Out Sept.10 2009 ‚Äì MILANO Giorgio Armani has a keen interest in sports. He is the president of the Olimpia Milano basketball team,Giorgio Armani, The Father Of Italian Fashion and an Inter Milan fan. He has twice designed suits for the England national football team.

Scientific literature comprises scholarly publications that report original empirical and theoretical work in the natural and social sciences, and within an academic field, often abbreviated as the literature. Academic publishing is the process of contributing the results of one's research into the literature, which often requires a peer-review process. Original scientific research published for the first time in scientific journals is called the primary literature. Patents and technical reports, for minor research results and engineering and design work (including computer software), can also be considered primary literature. Secondary sources include review articles (which summarize the findings of published studies to highlight advances and new lines of research) and books (for large projects or broad arguments, including compilations of articles). Tertiary sources might include encyclopedias and similar works intended for broad public consumption.  Types of scientific publications  Scientific literature can include the following kinds of publications: * Scientific articles published in scientific journals * Patents in the relevant subject (for example, biological patents and chemical patent)s * Books wholly written by one author or a few co-authors * Edited volumes, where each chapter is the responsibility of a different author or group of authors, while the editor is responsible for determining the scope of the project, keeping the work on schedule, and ensuring consistency of style and content * presentations at academic conferences, especially those organized by learned societies * Government reports such as a forensic investigation conducted by a government agency such as the NTSB * Scientific publications on the World Wide Web (although e.g. scientific journals are now commonly published on the web) * Books, technical reports, pamphlets, and working papers issued by individual researchers or research organizations on their own initiative; these are sometimes organized into a series. Literature may also be published in areas considered to be \\"grey\\", as they are published outside of traditional channels. This material is customarily not indexed by major databases and can include manuals, theses and dissertations, or newsletters and bulletins. The significance of different types of the scientific publications can vary between disciplines and change over time. According to James G. Speight and Russell Foote, peer-reviewed journals are the most prominent and prestigious form of publication. University presses are more prestigious than commercial press publication. The status of working papers and conference proceedings depends on the discipline; they are typically more important in the applied sciences. The value of publication as a preprint or scientific report on the web has in the past been low, but in some subjects, such as mathematics or high energy physics, it is now an accepted alternative. = Scientific papers and articles = Scientific papers have been categorised into ten types. Eight of these carry specific objectives, while the other two can vary depending on the style and the intended goal. Papers that carry specific objectives are: * An original article provides new information from original research supported by evidence. * Case reports are unique events that researchers read to obtain information on the subject. * A technical note is a description of a technique or piece of equipment that has been modified from an existing one to be new and more effective. * A pictorial essay is a series of high-quality images published for teaching purposes. * A review is a detailed analysis of recent developments on a topic. * A commentary is a short summary of an author's personal experience. * Editorials are short reviews or critiques of original articles. * Letters to the editor are communications directed to the editor of an article to ask questions and provide constructive criticism. The following two categories are variable, including for example historical articles and speeches: * \\"Nonscientific material\\" This type of material comes from the result of an article being published. It does not advance an article scientifically but instead contributes to its reputation as a scientific article. * \\"Other\\": Other types of papers not listed under non-scientific material or in any of the above eight categories. They can vary depending on the objective and style of the article. Scientific article =Preparation= The actual day-to-day records of scientific information are kept in research notebooks or logbooks. These are usually kept indefinitely as the basic evidence of the work, and are often kept in duplicate, signed, notarized, and archived. The purpose is to preserve the evidence for scientific priority, and in particular for priority for obtaining patents. They have also been used in scientific disputes. Since the availability of computers, the notebooks in some data-intensive fields have been kept as database records, and appropriate software is commercially available. The work on a project is typically published as one or more technical reports, or articles. In some fields both are used, with preliminary reports, working papers, or preprints followed by a formal article. Articles are usually prepared at the end of a project, or at the end of components of a particularly large one. In preparing such an article vigorous rules for scientific writing have to be followed. =Language= Often, career advancement depends upon publishing in high-impact journals, which, especially in hard and applied sciences, are usually published in English. Consequently, scientists with poor English writing skills are at a disadvantage when trying to publish in these journals, regardless of the quality of the scientific study itself. Yet many international universities require publication in these high-impact journals by both their students and faculty. One way that some international authors are beginning to overcome this problem is by contracting with freelance medical copy editors who are native speakers of English and specialize in ESL (English as a second language) editing to polish their manuscripts' English to a level that high-impact journals will accept. =Structure and style= Although the content of an article is more important than the format, it is customary for scientific articles to follow a standard structure, which varies only slightly in different subjects. Although the IMRAD structure emphasizes the organization of content, and in scientific journal articles, each section (Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion) has unique conventions for scientific writing style. The following are key guidelines for formatting, although each journal etc will to some extent have its own house style: *The title attracts readers' attention and informs them about the contents of the article. Titles are distinguished into three main types: declarative titles (state the main conclusion), descriptive titles (describe a paper's content), and interrogative titles (challenge readers with a question that is answered in the text). Some journals indicate, in their instructions to authors, the type (and length) of permitted titles. *The names and affiliations of all authors are given. In the wake of some scientific misconduct cases, publishers often require that all co-authors know and agree on the content of the article.Scientific fraud#Responsibility of authors and of coauthors *An abstract summarizes the work (in a single paragraph or in several short paragraphs) and is intended to represent the article in bibliographic databases and to furnish subject metadata for indexing services. *The context of previous scientific investigations should be presented, by citation of relevant documents in the existing literature, usually in a section called an \\"Introduction\\". *Empirical techniques, laid out in a section usually called \\"Materials and Methods\\", should be described in such a way that a subsequent scientist, with appropriate knowledge of and experience in the relevant field, should be able to repeat the observations and know whether he or she has obtained the same result. This naturally varies between subjects, and does not apply to mathematics and related subjects. *Similarly, the results of the investigation, in a section usually called \\"Results\\", should be presented in tabular or graphic form (image, chart, schematic, diagram or drawing). These display elements should be accompanied by a caption and should be discussed in the text of the article. *Interpretation of the meaning of the results is usually addressed in a \\"Discussion\\" or \\"Conclusions\\" section. The conclusions drawn should be based on the new empirical results while taking established knowledge into consideration, in such a way that any reader with knowledge of the field can follow the argument and confirm that the conclusions are sound. That is, acceptance of the conclusions must not depend on personal authority, rhetorical skill, or faith. *Finally, a \\"References\\" or \\"Literature Cited\\" section lists the sources cited by the authors.  Peer review  Though peer review and the learned journal format are not themselves an essential part of scientific literature, they are both convenient ways of ensuring that the above fundamental criteria are met. They are essentially a means of quality control, a term which also encompasses other means towards the same goal. The \\"quality\\" being referred to here is the scientific one, which consists of transparency and repeatability of the research for independent verification, the validity of the conclusions and interpretations drawn from the reported data, overall importance for advance within a given field of knowledge, novelty, and in certain fields applicability as well. The lack of peer review is what makes most technical reports and World Wide Web publications unacceptable as contributions to the literature. The relatively weak peer review often applied to books and chapters in edited books means that their status is also second-tier, unless an author's personal standing is so high that prior achievement and a continued stake in one's reputation within the scientific community signals a clear expectation of quality. The emergence of institutional digital repositories where scholars can post their work as it is submitted to a print-based journal has taken formal peer review into a state of flux. Though publicizing a preprint online does not prevent it from being peer reviewed, it does allow an unreviewed copy to be widely circulated. On the positive side this change has led to faster dissemination of novel work within the scientific community; on the negative it has made it more difficult to discern a valid scientific contribution from the unmeritorious. Increasing reliance on digital abstracting services and academic search engines means that the de facto acceptance in the academic discourse is predicted by the inclusion in such selective sources. Commercial providers of proprietary data include Chemical Abstracts Service, Web of Science and Scopus, while open data (and often open source, non-profit and library-led) services include DOAB, DOAJ and (for open access works) Unpaywall (based on CrossRef and Microsoft Academic records enriched with OAI-PMH data from open archives). Ethics The transfer of copyright from author to publisher, used by some journals, can be controversial because many authors want to propagate their ideas more widely and re-use their material elsewhere without the need for permission. Usually an author or authors circumvent that problem by rewriting an article and using other pictures. Some publishers may also want publicity for their journal so will approve facsimile reproduction unconditionally; other publishers are more resistant. In terms of research publications, a number of key issues include and are not restricted to: * Honesty. Honesty and integrity is a duty of each author and person, expert-reviewer and member of journal editorial boards. * Review process. The peer-review process contributes to the quality control and it is an essential step to ascertain the standing and originality of the research. **Redundant Publications. Publications that contain copyrighted and new unpublished material. **Data Fabrications. Is the process of purposefully changing data to make the information more in the favor of the author. * Ethical standards. Recent journal editorials presented some experience of unscrupulous activities. ** Human Welfare Concerns. The guidelines for human experimentation started during WWII with the Nuremberg Code. It has evolved into three main principles from The Belmont Report. The subject must be able to make their own choices to protect themselves, benefits must outweigh the risks, and subjects must be evaluated for their selection and benefits must go to all of society. **Animal Welfare Concerns. Is the ethical care of animals in scientific experiments. The APS has set strict guidelines and regulations to stop animals from being unnecessarily harmed in experiments. These are being updated regularly by the APS and is a federal law in the United States enforced by DHHS. * Authorship. Who may claim a right to authorship? In which order should the authors be listed? **Conflicts of Interests. This is referring to the biased assumption due to private interest. It can be done knowingly or not. This is unethical because it makes data inaccurate. **Authors Disputes. The authorship of an article is simply the author of the article. The ethical issue with this is when there are two people that believe to be the author, but there is only one true author. There are guidelines to help pick which get authorship of the writing. The one that does not get authorship is put in the acknowledgments. The guidelines come from NIH and The Council of Science Editors. History The first recorded editorial pre-publication peer-review occurred in 1665 by the founding editor of Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, Henry Oldenburg.Wagner (2006) p. 220-1 Technical and scientific books were a specialty of David Van Nostrand, and his Engineering Magazine re-published contemporary scientific articles.

As the widow of Charles, Prince of Leiningen (1763‚Äì1814), from 1814 she served as regent of the Principality during the minority of her son from her first marriage, Carl, until her second wedding in 1818 to Prince Edward, son of King George III of the United Kingdom.Tom Levine: Die Windsors. Glanz und Tragik einer fast normalen Familie. Campus-Verlag, Frankfurt am Main u. a. 2005, , S. 20. Early life  Victoria was born in Coburg on 17 August 1786 in the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation and was named Marie Louise Victoire.Urbach, Karina, \\"Victoire\\" in: Neue Deutsche Biographie 26 (2017), pp. 810‚Äì811 She was the fourth daughter and seventh child of Franz Frederick Anton, Duke of Saxe-Coburg- Saalfeld, and Countess Augusta of Reuss-Ebersdorf. One of her brothers was Ernest I, Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, and another brother, Leopold, future king of the Belgians, married, in 1816, Princess Charlotte of Wales, the only legitimate daughter of the future King George IV, and heiress presumptive to the British throne.  Marriages  =First marriage= On 21 December 1803 at Coburg, a young Victoria married (as his second wife) Charles, Prince of Leiningen (1763‚Äì1814), whose first wife, Countess Henrietta of Reuss- Ebersdorf, had been her aunt. The couple had two children, Prince Carl, born on 12 September 1804, and Princess Feodora of Leiningen, born on 7 December 1807. Through her first marriage, she is a direct matrilineal ancestor to various members of royalty in Europe, including Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden, Felipe VI of Spain, and Constantine II of Greece. =Regency= After the death of her first spouse, she served as regent of the Principality of Leiningen during the minority of their son, Carl. =Second marriage= The death in 1817 of Princess Charlotte of Wales, the wife of Victoria's brother Leopold, prompted a succession crisis. With Parliament offering them a financial incentive, three of Charlotte's uncles, sons of George III, were prepared to marry. One of them, Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn (1767‚Äì1820) proposed to Victoria and she accepted. The couple were married on 29 May 1818 at Amorbach and on 11 July 1818 at Kew, a joint ceremony at which Edward's brother, the Duke of Clarence, later King William IV, married Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen. Shortly after their marriage, the Kents moved to Germany, where the cost of living would be cheaper. Soon after, Victoria became pregnant, and the Duke and Duchess, determined to have their child born in England, raced back. Arriving at Dover on 23 April 1819, they moved into Kensington Palace, where Victoria gave birth to a daughter on 24 May 1819, Princess Alexandrina Victoria of Kent, later Queen Victoria. An efficient organiser, Sir John Conroy's planning ensured the Kents' speedy return to England in time for the birth of their first child. Widowhood The Duchess of Kent by Sir George Hayter in 1835 The Duke of Kent died suddenly of pneumonia in January 1820, six days before his father, King George III. His widow the Duchess had little cause to remain in the United Kingdom, since she did not speak the language and had a palace at home in Coburg where she could live cheaply on the revenues of her first husband. However, the British succession at this time was far from assured ‚Äì of the three brothers older than Edward, the new king, George IV, and the Duke of York were both estranged from their wives, who were in any case past childbearing age. The third brother, the Duke of Clarence, had yet to produce any surviving children with his wife. The Duchess of Kent decided that she would do better by gambling on her daughter's accession than by living quietly in Coburg and, having inherited her second husband's debts, sought support from the British government. After the death of Edward and his father, the young Princess Victoria was still only third in line for the throne, and Parliament was not inclined to support yet more impoverished royalty. The provision made for the Duchess of Kent was mean: she resided in a suite of rooms in the dilapidated Kensington Palace, along with several other impoverished members of the royal family, and received little financial support from the Civil List, since Parliament had vivid memories of the late Duke's extravagance. In practice, a main source of support for her was her brother, Leopold. The latter had a huge income of fifty thousand pounds per annum for life, representing an annuity allotted to him by the British Parliament on his marriage to Princess Charlotte, which had made him seem likely to become in due course the consort of the monarch. Even after Charlotte's death, Leopold's annuity was not revoked by Parliament. In 1831, with George IV dead and the new king William IV (formerly the Duke of Clarence) being over 60 without any surviving legitimate issue, and whose nearly 40-year-old wife was considered to be at the end of childbearing age, the young princess's status as heir presumptive and the Duchess's prospective place as regent led to major increases in British state income for the Kents. A contributing factor was Leopold's designation as King of the Belgians, upon which he surrendered his British income. Royal feud The Duchess of Kent with her daughter, the future Queen Victoria Together in a hostile environment, John Conroy's relationship with the Duchess was very close, with him serving as her comptroller and private secretary for the next nineteen years, as well as holding the unofficial roles of public relations officer, counsellor, confidant and political agent. While it is not clear which of the two was more responsible for devising the Kensington System, it was created to govern young Victoria's upbringing. The intention was for the Duchess to be appointed regent upon Victoria's (assumed youthful) ascension and for Conroy to be created Victoria's private secretary and given a peerage. The Duchess and Conroy continued to be unpopular with the royal family and, in 1829, the Duke of Cumberland spread rumours that they were lovers in an attempt to discredit them.Hibbert, p. 27; Longford, pp. 35‚Äì38, 118‚Äì119; St Aubyn, pp. 21‚Äì22; Woodham-Smith, pp. 70‚Äì72. The rumours were false in the opinion of these biographers. The Duke of Clarence referred to Conroy as \\"King John\\", while the Duchess of Clarence wrote to the Duchess of Kent to advise that she was increasingly isolating herself from the royal family and that she must not grant Conroy too much power. The Duchess of Kent was extremely protective, and raised Victoria largely isolated from other children under the so-called \\"Kensington System\\". The system prevented the princess from meeting people whom her mother and Conroy deemed undesirable (including most of her father's family), and was designed to render her weak and dependent upon them.Hibbert, pp. 27‚Äì28; Waller, pp. 341‚Äì342; Woodham- Smith, pp. 63‚Äì65 The Duchess avoided the court because she was scandalised by the presence of King William's illegitimate children,Hibbert, pp. 32‚Äì33; Longford, pp. 38‚Äì39, 55; Marshall, p. 19 and perhaps prompted the emergence of Victorian morality by insisting that her daughter avoid any appearance of sexual impropriety.Lacey, Robert (2006) Great Tales from English History, Volume 3, London: Little, Brown, and Company, , pp. 133‚Äì136 Victoria shared a bedroom with her mother every night, studied with private tutors to a regular timetable, and spent her play-hours with her dolls and her King Charles Spaniel, Dash.Waller, pp. 338‚Äì341; Woodham-Smith, pp. 68‚Äì69, 91 Perhaps because of Conroy's influence, the relationship between the Duchess's household and King William IV soon soured, with the Duchess regarding the King as an oversexed oaf.Farquhar, Michael (2001). A Treasure of Royal Scandals, p.152. Penguin Books, New York. . As far as she dared, the Duchess denied the King access to his niece. She prevented her daughter from attending William's coronation out of a disagreement of precedence, a decision attributed by the Duke of Wellington to Conroy. In 1831, the year of William's coronation, Conroy and the Duchess embarked on a series of royal tours with Victoria to expose her to the people and solidify their status as potential regents. Their efforts were ultimately successful and, in November 1831, it was declared that the Duchess would be sole regent in the event of Victoria's young queenship. The Duchess further offended the King by taking rooms in Kensington Palace that the King had reserved for himself. Both before and during William's reign, she snubbed his illegitimate children, the FitzClarences. Both the King and his wife Queen Adelaide were fond of their niece, Princess Victoria of Kent. Their attempts to forge a close relationship with the girl were frustrated by the conflict between the King and the Duchess of Kent. The King, angered at what he took to be disrespect from the Duchess to his wife, took the opportunity at what proved to be his final birthday banquet in August 1836 to settle the score. Speaking to those assembled at the banquet, who included the Duchess and Princess Victoria, William expressed his hope that he would survive until Princess Victoria was 18 so that the Duchess of Kent would never be regent. He said, > I trust to God that my life may be spared for nine months longer ... I > should then have the satisfaction of leaving the exercise of the Royal > authority to the personal authority of that young lady, heiress presumptive > to the Crown, and not in the hands of a person now near me, who is > surrounded by evil advisers and is herself incompetent to act with propriety > in the situation in which she would be placed.Somerset, p. 209. The breach between the Duchess and the King and Queen was never fully healed, but Victoria always viewed both of them with kindness.Allen, p.225 Conroy had high hopes for his patroness and himself: He envisaged Victoria succeeding the throne at a young age, thus needing a regency government, which, following the Regency Act 1830, would be headed by the princess's mother (who had already served in that capacity in Germany following the death of her first husband).Hibbert, p. 31; St Aubyn, p. 26; Woodham-Smith, p. 81 As the personal secretary of the Duchess, Conroy would be the veritable \\"power behind the throne\\". He had not counted on William IV surviving long enough for Victoria to succeed to the throne as an adult and consequently, while cultivating her mother, had shown little consideration for Victoria. When the latter succeeded, Conroy risked having no influence over her. He tried to force Victoria to agree to make him her personal secretary once she succeeded, but this plan, too, backfired. Victoria resented her mother's support for Conroy's schemes and being pressured by her to sign a paper declaring Conroy her personal secretary. The result was that when Victoria became queen, she relegated the Duchess to separate accommodations, away from her own. Reconciliation The Duchess of Kent in a portrait by Winterhalter When the Queen's first child, the Princess Royal, was born, the Duchess of Kent unexpectedly found herself welcomed back into Victoria's inner circle. It is likely that this came about as a result of the dismissal of Baroness Lehzen at the behest of Victoria's husband (and the Duchess's nephew), Prince Albert. Firstly, this removed Lehzen's influence, and Lehzen had long despised the Duchess and Conroy, suspecting them of an illicit affair. Secondly, it left the Queen wholly open to Albert's influence, and he likely prevailed upon her to reconcile with her mother. Thirdly, Conroy by now lived in exile on the Continent and so his divisive influence was removed. The Duchess's finances, which had been left in shambles by Conroy, were restored thanks to Victoria and her advisors. By all accounts, the Duchess became a doting grandmother and was closer to her daughter than she ever had been.Packard, p. 85 Rumours of affairs Some historians, including A. N. Wilson, suggested that Victoria's father could not have been the Duke of Kent. Those who promote this position point to the absence of porphyria in the British royal family among the descendants of Queen Victoria ‚Äì it had been widespread before her; and haemophilia, unknown in either the Duke's or Duchess's family, had arisen among the best documented families in history.A. N. Wilson, The Victorians (Hutchinson, 2002). , page 25 In practice, this would have required the Duchess's lover to be haemophiliac ‚Äì an extremely unlikely survival, given the poor state of medicine at the time,Packard, Jerrold (1973). Victoria's Daughters. New York: St. Martin's Press, pp. 43‚Äì44 or the Duchess herself to be a carrier of haemophilia, since haemophilia is X-linked, meaning that her mother would have been a carrier, if haemophilia was not otherwise previously expressed in the Duchess's parents. Actual evidence to support this theory has not arisen, and haemophilia occurs spontaneously through mutation in at least 30% of cases. John R√∂hl's book, Purple Secret, documents evidence of porphyria in Victoria, Princess Royal's daughter Charlotte, and her granddaughter, Feodora.R√∂hl, John C. G.; Warren, Martin; Hunt, David (1998) Purple Secret: Genes, \\"Madness\\" and the Royal Houses of Europe, London: Bantam Press, It goes on to say that Prince William of Gloucester was diagnosed with porphyria shortly before he died in a flying accident. Death The Duchess of Kent's Mausoleum at Frogmore The Duchess died at 09:30 on 16 March 1861 with her daughter Victoria at her side, aged 74 years. The Queen was much affected by her mother's death. Through reading her mother's papers, Victoria discovered that her mother had loved her deeply;Hibbert, p. 267; Longford, pp. 118, 290; St Aubyn, p. 319; Woodham-Smith, p. 412 she was heart-broken, and blamed Conroy and Lehzen for \\"wickedly\\" estranging her from her mother.Hibbert, p. 267; Marshall, p. 152; Woodham-Smith, p. 412 She is buried in the Duchess of Kent's Mausoleum at Frogmore, Windsor Home Park, near to the royal residence Windsor Castle. Queen Victoria and Albert dedicated a window in the Royal Chapel of All Saints in Windsor Great Park to her memory.

Most commonly, a time series is a sequence taken at successive equally spaced points in time. Thus it is a sequence of discrete-time data. Time Series analysis can be useful to see how a given asset, security or economic variable changes over time. Examples of time series are heights of ocean tides, counts of sunspots, and the daily closing value of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Time series are very frequently plotted via run charts (a temporal line chart). Time series are used in statistics, signal processing, pattern recognition, econometrics, mathematical finance, weather forecasting, earthquake prediction, electroencephalography, control engineering, astronomy, communications engineering, and largely in any domain of applied science and engineering which involves temporal measurements. Time series analysis comprises methods for analyzing time series data in order to extract meaningful statistics and other characteristics of the data. Time series forecasting is the use of a model to predict future values based on previously observed values. While regression analysis is often employed in such a way as to test theories that the current values of one or more independent time series affect the current value of another time series, this type of analysis of time series is not called \\"time series analysis\\", which focuses on comparing values of a single time series or multiple dependent time series at different points in time. Interrupted time series analysis is the analysis of interventions on a single time series. Time series data have a natural temporal ordering. This makes time series analysis distinct from cross- sectional studies, in which there is no natural ordering of the observations (e.g. explaining people's wages by reference to their respective education levels, where the individuals' data could be entered in any order). Time series analysis is also distinct from spatial data analysis where the observations typically relate to geographical locations (e.g. accounting for house prices by the location as well as the intrinsic characteristics of the houses). A stochastic model for a time series will generally reflect the fact that observations close together in time will be more closely related than observations further apart. In addition, time series models will often make use of the natural one-way ordering of time so that values for a given period will be expressed as deriving in some way from past values, rather than from future values (see time reversibility.) Time series analysis can be applied to real-valued, continuous data, discrete numeric data, or discrete symbolic data (i.e. sequences of characters, such as letters and words in the English language). Methods for analysis Methods for time series analysis may be divided into two classes: frequency-domain methods and time-domain methods. The former include spectral analysis and wavelet analysis; the latter include auto-correlation and cross-correlation analysis. In the time domain, correlation and analysis can be made in a filter-like manner using scaled correlation, thereby mitigating the need to operate in the frequency domain. Additionally, time series analysis techniques may be divided into parametric and non-parametric methods. The parametric approaches assume that the underlying stationary stochastic process has a certain structure which can be described using a small number of parameters (for example, using an autoregressive or moving average model). In these approaches, the task is to estimate the parameters of the model that describes the stochastic process. By contrast, non-parametric approaches explicitly estimate the covariance or the spectrum of the process without assuming that the process has any particular structure. Methods of time series analysis may also be divided into linear and non-linear, and univariate and multivariate. Panel data A time series is one type of panel data. Panel data is the general class, a multidimensional data set, whereas a time series data set is a one-dimensional panel (as is a cross-sectional dataset). A data set may exhibit characteristics of both panel data and time series data. One way to tell is to ask what makes one data record unique from the other records. If the answer is the time data field, then this is a time series data set candidate. If determining a unique record requires a time data field and an additional identifier which is unrelated to time (student ID, stock symbol, country code), then it is panel data candidate. If the differentiation lies on the non-time identifier, then the data set is a cross-sectional data set candidate. Analysis There are several types of motivation and data analysis available for time series which are appropriate for different purposes. =Motivation= In the context of statistics, econometrics, quantitative finance, seismology, meteorology, and geophysics the primary goal of time series analysis is forecasting. In the context of signal processing, control engineering and communication engineering it is used for signal detection and estimation. In the context of data mining, pattern recognition and machine learning time series analysis can be used for clustering, classification, query by content, anomaly detection as well as forecasting. =Exploratory analysis= Tuberculosis incidence US 1953-2009 The clearest way to examine a regular time series manually is with a line chart such as the one shown for tuberculosis in the United States, made with a spreadsheet program. The number of cases was standardized to a rate per 100,000 and the percent change per year in this rate was calculated. The nearly steadily dropping line shows that the TB incidence was decreasing in most years, but the percent change in this rate varied by as much as +/- 10%, with 'surges' in 1975 and around the early 1990s. The use of both vertical axes allows the comparison of two time series in one graphic. Other techniques include: * Autocorrelation analysis to examine serial dependence * Spectral analysis to examine cyclic behavior which need not be related to seasonality. For example, sun spot activity varies over 11 year cycles. Other common examples include celestial phenomena, weather patterns, neural activity, commodity prices, and economic activity. * Separation into components representing trend, seasonality, slow and fast variation, and cyclical irregularity: see trend estimation and decomposition of time series =Curve fitting= Curve fittingSandra Lach Arlinghaus, PHB Practical Handbook of Curve Fitting.

Pg 69 since it may reflect the method used to construct the curve as much as it reflects the observed data. The construction of economic time series involves the estimation of some components for some dates by interpolation between values (\\"benchmarks\\") for earlier and later dates. Interpolation is estimation of an unknown quantity between two known quantities (historical data), or drawing conclusions about missing information from the available information (\\"reading between the lines\\").Hamming, Richard. Numerical methods for scientists and engineers. Courier Corporation, 2012. Interpolation is useful where the data surrounding the missing data is available and its trend, seasonality, and longer-term cycles are known. This is often done by using a related series known for all relevant dates.Friedman, Milton. \\"The interpolation of time series by related series.\\" Journal of the American Statistical Association 57.300 (1962): 729‚Äì757. Alternatively polynomial interpolation or spline interpolation is used where piecewise polynomial functions are fit into time intervals such that they fit smoothly together. A different problem which is closely related to interpolation is the approximation of a complicated function by a simple function (also called regression).The main difference between regression and interpolation is that polynomial regression gives a single polynomial that models the entire data set. Spline interpolation, however, yield a piecewise continuous function composed of many polynomials to model the data set. Extrapolation is the process of estimating, beyond the original observation range, the value of a variable on the basis of its relationship with another variable. It is similar to interpolation, which produces estimates between known observations, but extrapolation is subject to greater uncertainty and a higher risk of producing meaningless results. =Function approximation= In general, a function approximation problem asks us to select a function among a well-defined class that closely matches (\\"approximates\\") a target function in a task-specific way. One can distinguish two major classes of function approximation problems: First, for known target functions approximation theory is the branch of numerical analysis that investigates how certain known functions (for example, special functions) can be approximated by a specific class of functions (for example, polynomials or rational functions) that often have desirable properties (inexpensive computation, continuity, integral and limit values, etc.). Second, the target function, call it g, may be unknown; instead of an explicit formula, only a set of points (a time series) of the form (x, g(x)) is provided. Depending on the structure of the domain and codomain of g, several techniques for approximating g may be applicable. For example, if g is an operation on the real numbers, techniques of interpolation, extrapolation, regression analysis, and curve fitting can be used. If the codomain (range or target set) of g is a finite set, one is dealing with a classification problem instead. A related problem of online time series approximationGandhi, Sorabh, Luca Foschini, and Subhash Suri. \\"Space-efficient online approximation of time series data: Streams, amnesia, and out-of-order.\\" Data Engineering (ICDE), 2010 IEEE 26th International Conference on. IEEE, 2010. is to summarize the data in one-pass and construct an approximate representation that can support a variety of time series queries with bounds on worst-case error. To some extent the different problems (regression, classification, fitness approximation) have received a unified treatment in statistical learning theory, where they are viewed as supervised learning problems. =Prediction and forecasting= In statistics, prediction is a part of statistical inference. One particular approach to such inference is known as predictive inference, but the prediction can be undertaken within any of the several approaches to statistical inference. Indeed, one description of statistics is that it provides a means of transferring knowledge about a sample of a population to the whole population, and to other related populations, which is not necessarily the same as prediction over time. When information is transferred across time, often to specific points in time, the process is known as forecasting. * Fully formed statistical models for stochastic simulation purposes, so as to generate alternative versions of the time series, representing what might happen over non-specific time-periods in the future * Simple or fully formed statistical models to describe the likely outcome of the time series in the immediate future, given knowledge of the most recent outcomes (forecasting). * Forecasting on time series is usually done using automated statistical software packages and programming languages, such as Julia, Python, R, SAS, SPSS and many others. * Forecasting on large scale data is done using Spark which has spark-ts as a third party package. =Classification= Assigning time series pattern to a specific category, for example identify a word based on series of hand movements in sign language. =Signal estimation= This approach is based on harmonic analysis and filtering of signals in the frequency domain using the Fourier transform, and spectral density estimation, the development of which was significantly accelerated during World War II by mathematician Norbert Wiener, electrical engineers Rudolf E. K√°lm√°n, Dennis Gabor and others for filtering signals from noise and predicting signal values at a certain point in time. See Kalman filter, Estimation theory, and Digital signal processing =Segmentation= Splitting a time-series into a sequence of segments. It is often the case that a time-series can be represented as a sequence of individual segments, each with its own characteristic properties. For example, the audio signal from a conference call can be partitioned into pieces corresponding to the times during which each person was speaking. In time-series segmentation, the goal is to identify the segment boundary points in the time-series, and to characterize the dynamical properties associated with each segment. One can approach this problem using change-point detection, or by modeling the time- series as a more sophisticated system, such as a Markov jump linear system. Models Models for time series data can have many forms and represent different stochastic processes. When modeling variations in the level of a process, three broad classes of practical importance are the autoregressive (AR) models, the integrated (I) models, and the moving average (MA) models. These three classes depend linearly on previous data points. Combinations of these ideas produce autoregressive moving average (ARMA) and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models. The autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average (ARFIMA) model generalizes the former three. Extensions of these classes to deal with vector-valued data are available under the heading of multivariate time-series models and sometimes the preceding acronyms are extended by including an initial \\"V\\" for \\"vector\\", as in VAR for vector autoregression. An additional set of extensions of these models is available for use where the observed time-series is driven by some \\"forcing\\" time-series (which may not have a causal effect on the observed series): the distinction from the multivariate case is that the forcing series may be deterministic or under the experimenter's control. For these models, the acronyms are extended with a final \\"X\\" for \\"exogenous\\". Non-linear dependence of the level of a series on previous data points is of interest, partly because of the possibility of producing a chaotic time series. However, more importantly, empirical investigations can indicate the advantage of using predictions derived from non-linear models, over those from linear models, as for example in nonlinear autoregressive exogenous models. Further references on nonlinear time series analysis: (Kantz and Schreiber), and (Abarbanel) Among other types of non-linear time series models, there are models to represent the changes of variance over time (heteroskedasticity). These models represent autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH) and the collection comprises a wide variety of representation (GARCH, TARCH, EGARCH, FIGARCH, CGARCH, etc.). Here changes in variability are related to, or predicted by, recent past values of the observed series. This is in contrast to other possible representations of locally varying variability, where the variability might be modelled as being driven by a separate time-varying process, as in a doubly stochastic model. In recent work on model-free analyses, wavelet transform based methods (for example locally stationary wavelets and wavelet decomposed neural networks) have gained favor. Multiscale (often referred to as multiresolution) techniques decompose a given time series, attempting to illustrate time dependence at multiple scales. See also Markov switching multifractal (MSMF) techniques for modeling volatility evolution. A Hidden Markov model (HMM) is a statistical Markov model in which the system being modeled is assumed to be a Markov process with unobserved (hidden) states. An HMM can be considered as the simplest dynamic Bayesian network. HMM models are widely used in speech recognition, for translating a time series of spoken words into text. =Notation= A number of different notations are in use for time-series analysis. A common notation specifying a time series X that is indexed by the natural numbers is written :X = {X1, X2, ...}. Another common notation is :Y = {Yt: t ‚àà T}, where T is the index set. =Conditions= There are two sets of conditions under which much of the theory is built: * Stationary process * Ergodic process However, ideas of stationarity must be expanded to consider two important ideas: strict stationarity and second-order stationarity. Both models and applications can be developed under each of these conditions, although the models in the latter case might be considered as only partly specified. In addition, time-series analysis can be applied where the series are seasonally stationary or non- stationary. Situations where the amplitudes of frequency components change with time can be dealt with in time-frequency analysis which makes use of a time‚Äìfrequency representation of a time-series or signal.Boashash, B.

He is acknowledged as a patriarch of Islam. Muslims believe that he preached the same monotheistic faith as did his forefathers: Abraham (Ibrahim), Isaac (Ishaq) and Ishmael (Ismail). Jacob is mentioned sixteen times in the Quran.\\"Jacob\\", Encyclopaedia of Islam Vol. XI, p.254. Two further references to Isra'il are believed to be mentions of Jacob.Jane Dammen McAuliffe (General Editor) Encyclopaedia of the Qur‚Äôan Volume Three : J-O In the majority of these references, Jacob is mentioned alongside fellow Hebrew prophets and patriarchs as an ancient and pious prophet who stayed in the \\"company of the elect\\". Muslims hold that Jacob was the son of Isaac and that he preached the Oneness of God throughout his life. As in Christianity and Judaism, Islam holds that Jacob had twelve sons, each of which would go on to father the Twelve Tribes of Israel.Concise Encyclopedia of Islam, C. Glasse, Children of Israel Jacob plays a significant role in the story of his son, Joseph (Y≈´suf).Quran, surah Yusuf (Chapter of Joseph) The Quran further makes it clear that God made a covenant with Jacob and Jacob was made a faithful leader by God's command. His grandfather (Ibrahim), father (Ishaq), uncle (Ismail), son (Yusuf) and himself are all prophets of Islam.  Jacob in the Quran  Jacob is mentioned by name in the Quran sixteen times. Although many of these verses praise him rather than recount an instance from his narrative, the Quran nonetheless records several significant events from his life. Although Muslim tradition and literature greatly embellishes upon the narrative of Jacob,Qisas Al-Anbiya (Stories of the Prophets), Ibn Kathir/Kisa'i, Story of Isaac and Jacob the earliest event involving Jacob in the Quran is that of the angels (malƒÅ æikah) giving \\"glad tidings\\" to Abraham and Sarah of the future birth of a prophetic son by the name of Isaac as well as a prophetic grandson by the name of Jacob. The Quran states: The Quran also mentions that Abraham taught the faith of pure monotheism to his sons, Ishmael and Isaac, as well as Jacob. The Quran records Abraham telling Ishmael, Isaac and Jacob: \\"Oh my sons! Allah hath chosen the Faith for you; then die not except in the Faith of Islam.\\" The Quran also mentions the gifts given to Jacob as well as the strength of his faith, which became stronger as he became older. The Quran mentions that Jacob was \\"guided\\"; given \\"knowledge\\"; \\"inspired\\"; and was given a \\"tongue of truthfulness to be heard\\". The Quran later states the following regarding Jacob: = Jacob and his sons = Jacob's next significant mention in the Quran is in the narrative of the surah Yusuf. Joseph's story in the Quran opens with a dream that Joseph had one night, after which he ran to his father Jacob, saying: \\"Behold! Joseph said to his father: \\"O my father! I did see eleven planets and the sun and the moon: I saw them prostrate themselves to me!\\" \\" Jacob's face filled with delight at what he had heard from the young Joseph, and the ageing prophet immediately understood what the dream meant. Jacob could foresee that his son would grow up to be the next prophet in the line of Abraham and it would be Joseph who would keep the message of Islam alive in the coming years. Jacob's older sons, however, felt that their father loved Joseph and Benjamin, Jacob's youngest son, more than them. Jacob knew about their jealousy and warned the young Joseph about it. Joseph's ten older brothers then decided to kill him. As the Quran narrates their discussion: One of the brothers (usually understood to be ReubenAbdullah Yusuf Ali's tafsir on surah Yusuf) however, felt that instead of slaying Joseph they should instead drop him into a well, so that a caravan may come and pick him up. Thus, they asked their father whether they could take the young Joseph out to play with them, on the condition that they would keep watch over him. Although Jacob feared that a dhi‚Äôb (, wolf) would devour his son, the rebellious older sons forcefully took Joseph away and threw him into the well. When the sons came back to Jacob that night, they pretended to weep and they further told him that the wolf had devoured Joseph. To trick their father, they stained Joseph's shirt with false blood, but Jacob, who had been gifted with knowledge, knew this was a false concoction that they had devised. Although Jacob did worry over the loss of Joseph, he remained steadfast to God throughout his grief. As the years passed, the young Joseph grew up into a man in Egypt; Jacob, meanwhile, was back at home in Canaan, where his sons would constantly bother him about his repeated praying to God for the return of Joseph. Although Jacob frequently complained to God it was never for God's doings, but out of the distractions of his own mind and his occasional breaking out of the bounds of patience he had set for himself. He constantly ignored the wicked taunting of his sons and would forgive them and tried to give them sound advice. One day, Jacob decided to send his sons on an errand, telling them to go to Egypt in search of Joseph and Benjamin. His sons, for the first time, listened to him and departed for Egypt. When one of Jacob's sons returned to Canaan with the good news of Joseph and Benjamin in Egypt, he came with a shirt that Joseph had given him, which he had told him to cast over their father's face,: \\"Go with this my shirt, and cast it over the face of my father: he will come to see (clearly). Then come ye (here) to me together with all your family.\\" to remove Jacob's blindness and grief. Thus, the son followed the instructions and did as Joseph said, restoring Jacob's physical and mental vision. Once Jacob's sight had been restored, the whole family began their trek to Egypt, to meet Joseph and the other sons again. Once they arrived, the father and son met each other with great love and were reunited in peace once again. The now powerful Joseph provided a home for his parents with himself and, as the Quran says, raised them high on a 'throne of dignity'.: And he raised his parents high on the throne (of dignity), and they fell down in prostration, (all) before him. He said: \\"O my father! this is the fulfilment of my vision of old! Allah hath made it come true! He was indeed good to me when He took me out of prison and brought you (all here) out of the desert, (even) after Satan had sown enmity between me and my brothers. Verily my Lord understandeth best the mysteries of all that He planneth to do, for verily He is full of knowledge and wisdom. It was now that the whole family, together, could turn to God through the prophetic offices of both Jacob and Joseph.  Jacob's last advice to his people  The whole of the Children of Israel were called to bow down to faith in Islam (Submission to God) before Jacob died. Jacob wanted to make sure that his children die only in Islam and, therefore, took one last promise from them. When he asked them who they would worship after his death, they replied that they would continue in Islam and bow down to and worship God. Although the death-bed scene is embellished upon in Jewish tradition, and mentioned in the Book of Genesis, the Quran mentions it to emphasize the notion that Abraham, Isaac, Ishmael, and Jacob were all Muslims, as they bowed down in full faith to God and God alone. The Quran narrates:  The legacy of Jacob  Jacob is very special in Islam for carrying on the legacy left by his forefathers. Muslims believe God bestowed His utmost grace upon Jacob and chose him to be among the most exalted men. The Quran frequently mentions Jacob as a man of might and vision and stresses he was of the company of the good and elect. As the Quran says: Ali ibn Abi Talib, when asked about the prophets who were bestowed special names, narrates in Hadith that Ya'qub ibn Ishaq was known by his people as Isra'il. Instances in the Bible involving Jacob wrestling with an angel are not mentioned in the Quran, but are discussed in Muslim commentaries, as is the vision of Jacob's Ladder. Jacob tricking Isaac into blessing him by impersonating his twin, Esau is also not in the Quran, but is in Muslim commentaries. Muslims, who do believe Jacob was a great patriarch, stress the belief that Jacob's main importance lay in his great submission to God and his firm faith in the right religion. As a patriarch, Jacob, alongside Abraham, may be the most fruitful according to tradition. From his twelve sonsFor the twelve sons, see Simeon, Issachar, Zebulun, Levi, Judah, Reuben, Dan, Asher, Naphtali, Gad, Joseph and Benjamin were to come many other great prophets, including Jonah (Yunus), David (Dawud), Solomon (Sulayman) and Jesus (Isa). Tomb of Jacob The Cave of the Patriarchs in the West Bank, Ash-Sham, which is said to include the tomb of Jacob. Jacob is believed by Muslims to be buried in the Cave of the Patriarchs (known by Muslims as the Sanctuary of Abraham). The compound, located in the ancient city of Hebron, is the second holiest site for Jews (after the Temple Mount in Jerusalem), and is also venerated by Christians and Muslims, both of whom have traditions that maintain that the site is the burial place of three Biblical couples: Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebecca, and Jacob and Leah. Although Jews alternatively also believe this to be the burial place for Adam (√Çdam) and Eve (HawwƒÅ æ), this is a view not usually adopted by Muslims.

Y≈´suf ibn Ya øq≈´b ibn Is·∏•ƒÅq ibn  æIbrƒÅhƒ´m () is a prophet mentioned in the Quran, and corresponds to Joseph, a person from the Tanakh, the Jewish religious scripture, and the Christian Bible, who was estimated to have lived in the 16th century BCE. It is one of the common names in the Middle East and among Muslim nations. Of all of Jacob's children, Joseph was the one given the gift of prophecy. Although the narratives of other prophets are mentioned in various Surahs, the complete narrative of Joseph is given only in one Surah, Yusuf, making it unique. It is said to be the most detailed narrative in the Qur'an and bears more details than the Biblical counterpart. Yusuf is believed to have been the eleventh son of Ya øq≈´b (, Jacob), and, according to many scholars, his favorite. According to Ibn Kathir, \\"Jacob had twelve sons who were the eponymous ancestors of the tribes of the Israelites. The noblest, the most exalted, the greatest of them was Joseph.\\" The story begins with Joseph revealing a dream he had to his father, which Jacob recognizes. In addition to the role of God in his life, the story of Yusuf and Zulaikha (Potiphar's wife of the Old Testament) became a popular subject in Persian literature, where it became considerably elaborated over the centuries. Historical narrative in Islam Joseph in Zuleikha's party. Painting in Takieh Moaven ol molk, Kermanshah, Iran. The story of Joseph in the Qur æƒÅn is a continuous narrative. There are more than one hundred verses, and in totality they encompass many years and \\"present an amazing variety of sciences and characters in a tightly-knit plot, and offer a dramatic illustration of some of the fundamental themes of the Qur æƒÅn.\\" The Qur æƒÅn itself relates to the story's importance in the third verse: \\"and We narrate unto you a·∏•sanal-qa·π£a·π£ (, \\"best (or most beautiful) of stories\\").\\" Most scholars believe this is referring to Joseph's story, while others, including ·π¨abari, argue it is a reference to the Qur æƒÅn as a whole. It asserts and documents the execution of God's rulings despite the challenge of human intervention (\\"And Allah hath full power and control over His affairs; but most among mankind know it not\\"). This is what the story of Y≈´suf confirms categorically, for it ends with comfort and marvels, which is described in the Qur æƒÅn. Along with the story there is also some commentary from some leading scholars of Islam. =Joseph before the dream= Muhammad at-·π¨abari provides exquisite detail and commentary of this narrative in his chapter on Joseph relaying the opinions of well-known scholars. In ·π¨abari's chapter, the physical beauty of Joseph and his mother Rachel is introduced, in that they were said to have had \\"more beauty than any other human being.\\" His father, Jacob, had given him to his oldest sister to be raised. ·π¨abari comments that there was no greater love than what Joseph's aunt felt for him as she had raised him as her own. And she was very reluctant to give him back to Jacob and kept him until her death. The reason, according to ·π¨abari, that she was able to do this was because of a belt that had been passed to her from her father, Isaac. ·π¨abari notes \\"if someone else acquired it by guile from the person who was supposed to have it, then he would become absolutely subject to the will of the rightful owner.\\" This is important because Joseph's aunt puts the belt on Joseph when Jacob is absent and then accuses Joseph of stealing it and he thus stays with her until her death. Jacob was very reluctant to give up Joseph and thus favors him when they are together. This is commentary but, as is the profession of commentators, this provides an interesting set up to Joseph's personal story and also lays a foundation for a future interaction with his brothers, particularly Benjamin. =The dream= The story begins with a dream and ends with its interpretation. As the sun appeared over the horizon, bathing the earth in its morning glory, Joseph, son of Jacob awoke from his sleep, delighted by a pleasant dream he had. Filled with excitement he ran to his father and reported what he had seen. According to Ibn Kathir, Jacob knew that Joseph would someday become extremely important and would be in a high position, both in this world and the next‚Äîhe recognized that the stars represented his brothers and the sun and moon represented himself and Joseph's mother, Rachel. Jacob advised Joseph to keep the dream to himself in order to protect him from the jealousy of his brothers, who were already unhappy about the love Jacob felt for Joseph. Ya'qub foresaw that Yusuf would be one through whom the prophecy of his grandfather, Ibrahim (Abraham), would be fulfilled, in that his offspring would keep the light of Abraham's house alive and spread God's message to mankind. Abu Ya'ala interpreted Jacob's reaction as an understanding that the planets, sun and moon bowing to Joseph representing \\"something dispersed which God united.\\" Ya'qub told Yusuf: \\"My son, relate not thy vision to thy brothers, lest they concoct a plot against thee: for Satan is a clear enemy to humanity. Thus your Lord has selected you and given you knowledge to interpret reports, and has perfected his blessing upon you and upon the family of Jacob just as he perfected it on your forefathers before: Ibrahim and Is-haq (Isaac). Your Lord is Knowing, Wise\\" (Qur'an, Surah 12 (Yusuf) Ayat 5-6). Joseph did not tell his brothers his dream, unlike in the version relayed in the Hebrew Bible, but their dislike of him was already too strong to subdue. ·π¨abari demonstrates this by adding that they said to each other, \\"verily Joseph and his brother (Benjamin) are dearer to our father than we are, though we may be a troop ('usbah). By usbah they meant a group, for they were ten in number. They said, \\"Our father is plainly in a state of aberration.\\"\\" Joseph was known, in addition for being very handsome, to be of gentle temperament. He was respectful, kind and considerate. His brother Benjamin was equally pleasant and both were from the same mother, Rachel. From a hadith (, 'narration'): =The plot against Joseph= Selling Joseph as a slave. Painting in Takieh Moaven ol molk, Kermanshah, Iran The Qur æƒÅn continues with Joseph's brothers plotting to kill him. It relates: \\"in Joseph and his brothers are signs for those who seek answers. When Joseph's brother said about him: \\"He is more loved by our father than we are, and we are a group. Our father is in clear error. Let us kill Joseph or cast him to the ground, so that the face of your father will be toward you, and after him you will be a community of the truthful.\\" But one of the brothers argued against killing him and suggested they throw him into a well, said to be Jubb Yusif (, \\"Well of Joseph\\"), so that a caravan might pick him up and take him into slavery. Mujahid, a scholar, says that it was Simeon and Suddi says it was Judah while Qatadah and Ibn Is-haq says that it was the eldest, Ruben. Said one of them: \\"Slay not Joseph, but if ye must do something, throw him down to the bottom of the well: he will be picked up by some caravan of travellers.\\" Killing Joseph because of jealousy would have been extreme, but scholars also suggested that Joseph was fairly young when he was thrown into the well, as young as twelve. He would live to be 110 or 120. The brothers asked their father to let them take Joseph out to the desert to play and promised to watch him. Jacob, not thrilled with the idea knowing how much the brothers disliked Joseph, hesitated. ·π¨abari comments that Jacobs's excuse was that a dhi'b (, wolf) might hurt him. But the brothers insisted. When they had Joseph alone they threw him into a well and left him there, They returned with a blood stained shirt and lied that he had been attacked by a wolf, but their father did not believe them, as he was a sincere man who loved his son. The Qur'an says: ·π¨abari comments that Judah stopped the brothers from causing more harm to Joseph, and that he would bring him food. Ibn Kathir comments that Reuben suggested that they put him in the pit so that he might return later to bring him home. But when he returned, he found Joseph gone. \\"So he screamed and tore his clothes. He put blood on the coat of Joseph. When Jacob learned of this, he tore his clothes, wore a black cloak, and was sad for many days.\\" Ibn 'Abbas writes that the \\"reason for this trial of Jacob was that he had slaughtered a sheep while he was fasting. He asked a neighbor of his to eat it but he did not. So God tested him with the matter of Joseph.\\" The section that describes Joseph's revelation in the well is interpreted by Ibn 'Abbas: \\"When they were unaware\\" (12:15) means \\"you will tell them about what they did in a situation in which they will not recognize you.\\" This is yet more foreshadowing. A possible reason for his enslavement was that after Abraham had left Egypt he took slaves with him but \\"Abraham did not dismount for them (following barefoot). Therefore God revealed to him: \\"Since you did not alight for the slaves and those walking barefoot with you, I will punish you by selling one of your descendants into his country.\\"\\" =God's plan to save Joseph= A passing caravan took Joseph. They had stopped by the well hoping to draw water to quench their thirst and saw the boy inside. So they retrieved him and sold him into slavery in Misr (, Egypt), to a rich man referred to as \\"Al-'Aziz\\" (, \\"Great One\\", \\"Nobleman\\") in the Qur'an, or Potiphar in the Bible.Genesis,  øAzƒ´z is also known as Qatafir or Qittin. Joseph was taken into 'Aziz's home who told his wife to treat him well. This is the point of the story that many scholars of Islam report as being central (contrasting to other religious traditions) to Joseph's story. Under  øAzƒ´z Misr (, \\"The Dear One of Egypt\\"), Joseph moves to a high position in his household. Later, the brothers would come to Egypt but would not recognize Joseph but called him by the same title, \\"al- øAzƒ´z.\\" While working for 'Aziz, Joseph grew to be a man. He was constantly approached by the wife of 'Aziz (Imra'at al-'Aziz, presumably Zulayka or Zuleika) (variations include 'Zulaykhah' and 'Zulaikhah' as well) who intended to seduce him. Tabari and others are not reticent to point out that Joseph was mutually attracted to her. ·π¨abari writes that the reason he did not succumb to her was because when they were alone the \\"figure of Jacob appeared to him, standing in the house and biting his fingers ‚Ä¶\\" and warned Joseph not to become involved with her. ·π¨abari, again, says \\"God turned him away from his desire for evil by giving him a sign that he should not do it.\\" It is also said that after the death of  øAzƒ´z, Joseph married Zolay·∏µƒÅ. Zolay·∏µƒÅ is said to have then ripped the back of Joseph's shirt and they raced with one another to the door where her husband was waiting. At that point she attempted to blame Joseph and suggested that he had attacked her. However, Joseph said that it was Zolay·∏µƒÅ who had attempted to seduce him and his account is confirmed by one of the household. ' øAzƒ´z believed Joseph and told his wife to beg forgiveness.\\" One member of the family, it is disputed who (perhaps a cousin) told  øAzƒ´z to check the shirt. If it was torn in the front than Joseph was guilty and his wife innocent but if it was torn in the back, Joseph was innocent and his wife guilty. It was torn in the back so  øAzƒ´z reprimands his wife for lying. Zuleikha's circle of friends thought that she was becoming infatuated with Joseph and mocked her for being in love with a slave. She invited them to her home and gave them all apples, and knives to peel them with. She then had Joseph walk through and distract the women who cut themselves with the knives. Zuleikha then pointed out that she had to see Joseph every day. Joseph prayed to God and said that he would prefer prison to the things that Zolay·∏µƒÅ and her friends wanted. According to ·π¨abari, some time later, even though  øAzƒ´z knew that Joseph was innocent, he \\"grew disgusted with himself for having let Joseph go free ‚Ä¶ It seemed good to them to imprison him for a time.\\" It is possible that Zolay·∏µƒÅ had influence here, rebuking her husband for having her honor threatened. The account of Joseph and the wife of 'Aziz is called \\"Yusuf and Zulaikha,\\" and has been told and retold countless times in many languages. The Qur'anic account differs from the Biblical version in which Potiphar believes his wife and throws Joseph into prison.Genesis, =Joseph interprets dreams= This account refers to the interaction between Joseph and the ruler of Egypt. Unlike the references to the Pharaoh in the account of Musa, the account of Joseph refers to the Egyptian ruler as a malik (, 'king'), not a fir'aun (, 'pharaoh'). After Joseph had been imprisoned for a few years, God granted him the ability to interpret dreams, a power that made him popular amongst the prisoners. One event concerns two royal servants who, prior to Joseph's imprisonment, had been thrown into the dungeon for attempting to poison the food of the king ‚Äì whose name is not given either in the Qur'an or the Bible ‚Äì and his family. Joseph asked them about the dreams they had, and one of them described that he saw himself pressing grapes into wine. The other said he had seen himself holding a basket of bread on his head and birds were eating from it. Joseph reminded the prisoners that his ability to interpret dreams was a favor from God based on his adherence to monotheism. Joseph then stated that one of the men (the one who dreamt of squeezing grapes for wine) would be released from the prison and serve the king, but warned that the other would be executed, and so was done in time. Joseph had asked the one whom he knew would be released (·π¨abari writes that his name was Nabu) to mention his case to the king. When asked about his time in prison, ·π¨abari reports that Muhammad said: \\"If Joseph had not said that‚Äîmeaning what he said (to Nabu)‚Äîhe would not have stayed in prison as long as he did because he sought deliverance from someone other than God.\\" The king had a dream of seven fat cows being eaten by seven skinny ones and seven ears of corn being replaced with shriveled ones, and he was terrified. None of his advisors could interpret it. When the servant who was released from prison heard about it, he remembered Joseph from prison and persuaded the king to send him to Joseph so that he could return with an interpretation. Joseph told the servant that Egypt would face seven years of prosperity and then suffer seven years of famine and that the king should prepare for it so as to avoid great suffering. Scholars debate as to whether Joseph agreed to interpret the dream right away or if he declared that his name should be cleared in the house of  øAzƒ´z first. ·π¨abari notes that when the messenger came to Joseph and invited him to come to the king, Joseph replied \\"Go back to your lord and ask him about the case of the women who cut their hands. My lord surely knows their guile.\\" Ibn Kathir agrees with ·π¨abari saying that Joseph sought \\"restitution for this in order that  øAzƒ´z might know that he was not false to him during his absence\\" and that Zolay·∏µƒÅ eventually confessed that nothing happened between them. ·π¨abari inserts an interesting interaction between Joseph and the angel Gabriel in which Gabriel helps Joseph both gain his freedom and admit to his own desires. Joseph said, \\"What you cultivate during the next seven years, when the time of harvest comes, leave the grains in their spikes, except for what you eat. After that, seven years of drought will come, which will consume most of what you stored for them. After that, a year will come that brings relief for the people, and they will, once again, press juice.\\" (Qur'an, 12:47-49) Joseph was brought to king and interpreted the dream. When he became aware of Yusuf's innocence, the king said, \\"Bring him to me that I may attach him to my person.\\" Then, when he spoke to him, he said: \\"Verily, this day, you are with us high in rank and fully trusted.\\"\\" (Quran 12:54) Upon speaking with Yusuf, the king recognized his virtues, great ability, brilliance, good conduct and perfect mannerisms. Yusuf said, \\"Set me over the storehouses of the land; I will indeed guard them with full knowledge\\" (Quran 12:55). Thus Yusuf asked the king to appoint him as Minister of Finance. Use of \\"king\\" versus \\"pharaoh\\" In the Qur'an, the title of the Ruler of Egypt during the time of Joseph is specifically said to be \\"King\\" (Arabic: Malik) whilst that of the Ruler of Egypt during the time of Moses is specifically said to be \\"Pharaoh.\\" This is interesting because according to historical sources, the title Pharaoh only began to be used to refer to the rulers of Egypt (starting with the rule of Thutmose III) in 1479 BCE - approximately 21 years after the prophet Joseph died. But in the narration of Yusuf in the Bible, the titles King (Hebrew: Melekh) and Pharaoh are used interchangeably for the ruler of Egypt in Genesis chapters 39-41. =The family reunion= Joseph became extremely powerful. Ibn Kathir relates that the king of Egypt had faith in Joseph and that the people loved and revered him. It is said that Joseph was 30 when he was summoned to the king. \\"The king addressed him in 70 languages, and each time Joseph answered him in that language.\\" Ibn Is-haq comments, \\"the king of Egypt converted to Islam at the hands of Joseph.\\" Joseph's brothers, in the meantime, had suffered while the people of Egypt prospered under Joseph's guidance. Jacob and his family were hungry and the brothers went to Egypt, unaware that Joseph was there and in such a high position. Joseph gave them what they needed but questions them and they reveal that there were once twelve of them. They lie and say that the one most loved by their father, meaning Joseph, died in the desert. Joseph tells them to bring Benjamin, the youngest, to him. They return home to Jacob and persuade him to let Benjamin accompany them in order to secure food. Jacob insists that they bring Benjamin back‚Äîand this time the brothers are honest when they swear to it. According to Ibn Kathir, Jacob ordered the brothers to use many gates when returning to Egypt because they were all handsome. The Qur æƒÅn itself elaborates that Jacob sensed Joseph. When the brothers return with Benjamin, Joseph reveals himself to Benjamin. He then gives the brothers the supplies he promised but also put the king's cup into one of the bags. He then proceeds to accuse them of stealing, which the brothers deny. Joseph informs them that whoever it was who stole the cup will be enslaved to the owner and the brothers agree, not realizing the plot against them. ·π¨abari reports that the cup was found in Benjamin's sack. After much discussion and anger, the brothers try to get Benjamin released by offering themselves instead‚Äîfor they must keep their promise to their father. Reuben stays behind with Benjamin in order to keep his promise to his father. When the other brothers inform Jacob of what has happened, Jacob does not believe them and becomes blind after crying much over the disappearance of his son. Forty years had passed since Joseph was taken from his father, and Jacob had held it in his heart. Jacob sends the brothers back to find out about Benjamin and Joseph. Upon their return Joseph reveals himself to his brothers and gives them one of his shirts to give to Jacob. When Jacob receives the shirt, this time as good news, Jacob lays it on his face and regains his vision. He says \\"Did I not tell you that I know from God what you do not know?\\" (12:96). ·π¨abari says that this means that \\"from the truth of the interpretation of Joseph's dream in which he saw eleven planets and the sun and the moon bowing down to him, he knew that which they did not know.\\" Joseph was reunited with his family, and his dream as a child came true as he saw his parents and eleven of his brothers prostrating before him in love, welcome and respect. Ibn Kathir mentions that his mother had already died but there are some who argue that she came back to life. ·π¨abari says that she was alive. Joseph eventually died in Egypt. Tradition holds that when Musa (Moses) left Egypt, he took Joseph's coffin with him so that he would be buried alongside his ancestors in Canaan. =Death and burial= It is hard to find sources that consistently agree on the actual dates of Joseph's life. Scholars tend to see the story as a way for the descendants of Abraham to find their way to Egypt. Joseph is the reason the Israelites move to Egypt, which then allows for the story of Moses and the Exodus from Egypt to take place. Historically, Muslims also associated Joseph's Tomb with that of the biblical figure. In recent years however, they claim that an Islamic cleric, Sheikh Yussuf (Joseph) Dawiqat, was buried there two centuries ago.Israeli army returns to Arafat compound, BBC, October 1, 2002. According to Islamic tradition, the biblical Joseph is buried in Hebron, next to the Cave of the Patriarchs where a medieval structure known as Yussuf-Kalah, the \\"Castle of Joseph\\", is located. Legacy Scholars and believers reveal Joseph is one of the most revered men in Islamic history. Having come through an especially noble line of patriarchs - Abraham, Isaac and Jacob - Joseph too was awarded the gift of prophecy like his forefathers. As Kisai, one of the foremost writers on the lives of the Qur æƒÅnic prophets, states, this was also evident in the fact that Joseph was given a staff of light with five branches. On the first branch was written \\"Abraham, friend of God,\\" on the second, \\"Isaac, pure of God,\\" on the third, \\"Ishmael, sacrifice of God\\", on the fourth, \\"Jacob, Israelite of God,\\" and on the fifth, \\"Joseph, Righteous of God.\\" The Qur'anic narrative about Joseph is perhaps one of the Book's most detailed accounts of the life and deeds of a prophet. Joseph, as a figure, is symbolic of the virtue of beauty - his life being a thing of beauty in itself. Most importantly, though, Joseph is admired as a great preacher of the Islamic faith, who had an extremely strong commitment to God and one who tried to get people to follow the path of righteousness. The Qur'an recounts Joseph's declaration of faith: Joseph is also described as having the three characteristics of the ideal statesman: pastoral ability (developed while Joseph was young and in charge of his fathers flocks); household management (from his time in Potiphar's house) and self-control (as we see on numerous occasions not just with Potiphar's wife): \\"He was pious and God fearing, full of temperance, ready to forgive, and displayed goodness to all people.\\" =Commentaries= Y≈´suf is largely absent from the Hadƒ´th. Discussions, interpretations and retellings of S≈´rat Y≈´suf may be found in the Tafsƒ´r literature, the universal histories of al-·π¨abarƒ´, Ibn KatÃ≤hÃ≤ƒ´r, along with others, and in the poetry and pietistic literatures of many religions in addition to Judaism and Christianity. According to Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq, a great grandson of Muhammad and prominent source of Hadith during his time, Yusuf was among the righteous servants and safe in the world from becoming an adulterer and immoral one. Y≈´suf serves as a model of virtue and wisdom in pietistic literature. He is extolled in ·π¢≈´fƒ´ manuals such as that of Ab≈´ Na·π£r al-SarrƒÅdÃ≤jÃ≤'s K. al-Luma ø as a paragon of forgiveness. \\"He also epitomizes the chastity that is based on complete trust in God, for it was his absolute piety that prompted God to personally intervene to prevent him from the transgression of succumbing to sexual temptation.\\" He is an archetype of wisdom and faith, although arguably still human (as is shown in his interactions with his brothers when in Egypt). As has been noted, commentary never fails to mention Y≈´suf's beauty‚Äîa strong theme in post- ·∏≤ur æƒÅnic literature. Firestone notes, \\"His beauty was so exceptional that the behavior of the wife of al- øAzƒ´z is forgiven, or at least mitigated, because of the unavoidably uncontrollable love and passion that his countenance would rouse in her. Such portrayals are found in many genres of Islamic literatures, but are most famous in N≈´r al-Dƒ´n  øAbd al-Ra·∏•mƒÅn DijƒÅmƒ´'s [q.v.] Y≈´suf wa ZulaykÃ≤hÃ≤ƒÅ, which incorporates many of the motifs and attributes associated with his beauty in earlier works.\\" Certainly by the 7th century AH / 13th century ACE, and up to the 10th century AH / 16th century ACE, in Persian areas at the very least, Y≈´suf was incorporated into the world of art‚Äîand was thus considered a patron. In addition to poetry and other writing, paintings and other forms of art were composed to not only exemplify his physical beauty but his magnificent character as well. Below are a few notes about some, but not all, important influential commentaries‚Äînamely Arabic, Persian and Sufi from the mediaeval period. See references to get more information on each one. Exoteric Commentaries in Arabic \\"The Story of Joseph\\" is a running narrative, but the exoteric commentaries fill in gaps in the story, make connections and identifying characters. Adding detail to the novella is not uncommon, and most complement information already known from the holy texts. According to the Encyclopedia of Iranic, much of this comes from the Esra'Illiyat, that is, traditions drawn from the body of knowledge about Biblical events and people shared by Christians, Jews, and early Muslims. A fairly consistent source for this tradition goes back to the authority of Ibn 'Abbas (d. ca. 687) or Esma'il b. 'Abd-al-Rahman Soddi (d. 745). Among the commentaries, ·π¨abari includes the greatest number of traditions supplying information not found in the Qur æƒÅnic story. Tabari's commentary on Joseph presents numerous sources representing different traditions. \\"All the Arabic commentaries on Surat Yusuf include explanations and discussions of lexicography and grammar to clarify the literal meaning of the Qur æƒÅnic story of Joseph. They focus on smaller details, not big-picture meaning.\\" Additional themes presented here have to do with the character of God, including that of being \\"al-Ghalib\\" (). Mustansir Mir shows Joseph's story as a vindication of God's dominion and the continual fulfillment of his will. According to The Muslim World (1986), this Surah is the only one to point to the word 'Ghalib' as a divine attribute. The Surah also highlights the way dominion is actually established, in that God is al-Latif (, \\"the One subtle in accomplishing his will\\"). God is also seen as al-'Alim (, \\"the Knower\\" or \\"the All-Knowing One\\") and al-Hakim (, \\"the Wise\\" or \\"the All-Wise One\\"). This does not disregard the theme of balance between divine decree and human freedom. A medieval Arabic verse retelling of the Qur'anic Joseph story also exists.The Story of Joseph in Arabic Verse in the Leeds Arabic Manuscript 347, ed. and trans. by R. Y. Ebied and M. J. L. Young, The Annual of Leeds University Oriental Society Supplement, 3 (Leiden: Brill, 1975).A. F. L. Beeston, 'Notes on a Middle- Arabic \\"Joseph\\" Poem', Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, 40.2 (1977), 287-96. Persian commentaries Farsi tafsirs vary considerably in the extent to which they included exegetical discussions of the technical nature and Arabic questions. Thus, some Persian commentaries on Surat Yusuf resemble their Arabic counterparts. Other commentaries consist mainly of a translation of the versus and storytelling, which is unlike Tabari's style. Mystical readings of Joseph, from the 6th century AH / 12th century ACE tafsir of Maybundi are an example of this influence. Storytelling becomes more prominent in Persian tafsirs. They are known especially for their colorful and dramatic depiction of scenes in the narratives. It is often described as \\"lively,\\" which can be seen in Joseph's interactions with his brothers. Another example of Persian expansion of the language is when the brother's realize that Joseph is going to keep Benjamin in Egypt. One of the brothers, often Rueben, is said to have threatened Joseph that he would yell so loudly that every pregnant woman would immediately deliver her child. Judaeo-Persian literature had strong influences on medieval Islamic writings as well. Scholars note that 'genuine' Judaeo-Persian literature seemed to have been developed during the ƒ™l-KÃ≤hÃ≤ƒÅn dynasty over Persia, from the end of the 7th/13th century on. Sufi commentaries The Sufi tradition tends to focus its attention on the lessons and deeper meanings, \\"that may be elicited from the Qur'anic verses and the story of Joseph provides them with ample scope to draw lessons of mystical, ethical and theological and metaphysical significance.\\" All the commentaries of this tradition spend time on the themes of preordination and God's omnipotence. Two teachings stand out here: \\"the first is that God is the controller and provider of all things and that human beings should have complete trust in Him and the second is the prevailing of the divine decree over human contrivance and design.\\" The love story itself is also a central theme in Sufi discussions. The theme of love seeps into more than just the story of Yusuf and Zulaikhah. Jacob becomes a prototype of the mystic lover of God and Zolay·∏µƒÅ goes from temptress to a lover moving from human to divine love. There were two kinds of love present in the story‚Äîthe passion of a lover as well as the devotion of a father to his lost son. Joseph also represents the eternal beauty as it is manifested in the created world. Joseph's story can be seen as a parable of God's way, a way which the mystic should focus his journey‚Äîfollowing the way of love. \\"The Persian versions include full narratives, but also episodic anecdotes and incidental references which occur in prose works, didactic and lyrical poetry and even in drama. The motif was suited to be used by Sufi writers and poets as one of the most important models of the relationship between the manifestation of Divine beauty in the world and the loving soul of the mystic.\\" There was also a Jewish presence. According to W. J. Fischer (2013), \\"Persian Jews, far from living in a cultural vacuum in isolation, took also a keen interest in the literary and poetical works of their Muslim neighbors and shared with them the admiration for the classical Persian poetry.\\" Thus, similar styles in meter and form translated easily between the two. The poet DÃ≤jÃ≤ƒÅmƒ´ (d. 1414) is known for his reflection on stories such as Y≈´suf and ZulaykÃ≤hÃ≤ƒÅ. Which was made accessible in Hebrew transliteration and are preserved in various libraries in Europe, America and in Jerusalem. Shia Commenteries It is narrated in Kitab al-Kafi by Ja'far al-Sadiq that when the fire was set for Abraham, Jibril brought him a dress from paradise and made him wear it. With that dress on him, nothing of the cold or heat would harm him. When Abraham was close to death, he placed it in a covering and gave it to Ishaq who passed it to Yaqub. When Joseph was born, it was passed to him. When he took it out of its covering in Egypt, Jacob (Ya'qub) felt its fragrance as he said, I smell Joseph's scent. I hope that you will not accuse me of senility (12:94). It was the same shirt that was sent from paradise.. =Gender and Sexuality= The story can give us insight into Qur æƒÅnic models of sexuality and gender and an understanding of hegemonic masculinity. In Surah Yusuf, a Prophet, who is very different from other prophets in the Qur æƒÅn, is encountered, but the tradition shows that prophets are chosen to guide other human beings to God, according to the Qur æƒÅn . Yusuf is similar to other Prophets in that his story conveys God's message, but also he is demonstrated in a biography that \\"begins and ends with God. For this reason all prophets are equal: their sole purpose is to highlight God's divinity but not their own significance over against other prophets.\\" Ibn Kathir uses Joseph's resistance to Zolay·∏µƒÅ as a basis for the prophetic statement about men who are saved by God because they fear Him. However, other scholars, especially women scholars such as Barbara Freyer Stowasser, think this interpretation is demeaning of women‚Äîperhaps believing that this seeks to show that women do not have the same connection. Stowasser writes: \\"Both appear in the Hadith as symbolized in the concept of fitna (social anarchy, social chaos, temptation) which indicates that to be a female is to be sexually aggressive and, hence, dangerous to social stability. The Qur æƒÅn, however, reminds human beings to remain focused on submission to God.\\" It is evident from the Islamic traditions that God is not chastising the mutual attraction and love between them but that he points to the associated factors that made their love affair impossible. This is demonstrated later, by some accounts, when they are married.

Miller, who had assembled a complete collection pre-1925.The ‚ÄúHoly Grail‚Äù of Stamp Collections, New York Public Library Life and work Zoellner was born on April 26, 1932, in Irvington, New Jersey to parents Emil John Zoellner and Anna Elizabeth Morton.Miller, Stephen. \\"Robert Zoellner, Alpine Associates Founder, Dies at 82\\", Bloomberg News, December 31, 2014. Accessed December 31, 2014. Raised in what is now known as Elmwood Park, New Jersey (then East Paterson), Zoellner graduated from Lodi High School in 1950. He attended Lehigh University, where he graduated in 1954 with a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering and engineering physics and played on the school's hockey team. He was a member of Lehigh's Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps program and served for two years in the United States Air Force after graduating from college.Levin, Jay. \\"Robert E.

Following his military service, Zoellner went into the investment field, establishing the firm of E.J. Roberts in 1958 before joining Edwards & Hanly, a firm that named him in 1964 as its managing partner. Together with his wife Victoria, he formed the investment firm Alpine Associates in 1976, which focuses on merger arbitrage, bankruptcy and other investment strategies. By the time of his death, the firm based in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey had $1.7 billion in assets under management and claimed never to have had a losing year since its establishment. Zoellner had been a resident of Cresskill, New Jersey, where he donated funds to build tennis courts and a baseball field. He moved to nearby Alpine in the 1980s, where he was the borough's largest individual property owner, loaned heavy equipment to the borough's Department of Public Works and donated funds to the Alpine Public School District. Alpine mayor Paul Tomasko described Zoellner as \\"one of our foremost residents\\". As a benefactor to Lehigh University, Zoellner and his wife contributed $6 million towards the construction of the Zoellner Arts Center and a physical science building. Zoellner had also contributed towards the establishment of a model train show held annually at the New York Botanical Garden. Zoellner began collecting stamps as a child, but only began building his collection in earnest in 1985. He completed the collection in 1996 and it was auctioned off in 1998. Stamp collection Like many philatelists Zoellner collected stamps as a child and had attempted to fill his entire stamp album of United States stamps. However, many US stamps are quite rare, and he eventually put the album aside. His interest was rekindled in 1984, and in 1985 he approached Scott Trepel of Siegel Auctions and asked whether it was possible to assemble a complete collection. At the time all of the major grill rarities were coming on the market and Zoellner had both the \\"means and the inclination\\" (to quote the Weill brothers) to obtain them. He purchased the 1 cent Z grill, the rarest US stamp, in November 1986 for $418,000, setting a new record for a US stamp sale. In addition to singles of each type, Zoellner also bought strips, blocks, and covers. Since his original album had no spaces for these, he moved to a system of computer-generated pages designed for the additional items. By 1996, only a few spaces remained to be filled. Zoellner accepted an invitation to exhibit the collection at Anphilex '96 and scrambled to complete the collection. The last stamp he acquired was the 30c gray black stamp of 1873, given as a gift by one of Zoellner's friends. On October 8‚Äì10, 1998, the entire collection was auctioned off. Siegel's auction catalog was a 391-page work that included extensive description and documentation of the items, many of which were the \\"finest known\\" of their type, and sold for prices well above their nominal values. The 1c Z grill went to Donald Sundman of Mystic Stamp Company for $935,000.

He is mentioned in the Quran a total of 11 times.Brandon M. Wheeler, Historical Dictionary of Prophets in Islam and Judaism, Shuayb, pg. 303 He is believed to have lived after Ibrahim (Abraham), and Muslims believe that he was sent as a prophet to a community: the Midianites, who are also known as the A·π£-·∏•ƒÅb al- Aykah (\\"Companions of the Wood\\"), since they used to worship a large tree. To the people, Shu øayb proclaimed the faith of Islam and warned the people to end their fraudulent ways. When they did not repent, AllƒÅh (God) destroyed the community. Shu øayb is understood by Muslims to have been one of the few Arabian prophets mentioned by name in the Qur'an, the others being Saleh, Hud, and Muhammad. It is said that he was known by Muslims as \\"the eloquent preacher amongst the prophets\\", because he was, according to tradition, granted talent and eloquence in his language. Historical context The area to which Shu øayb was sent to is named 'Madyan in the Qur'an, known in English as Midian, which is frequently referred to in the Tanakh. The preaching of Shuayb, however, is not covered in the Tanakh. The Midianites were said to be of Arab descent, though being neighbors of the Biblical Canaanites, they intermixed with them. It is said they were a wandering tribe, and that their principal territory at the time of Musa (Moses) was the Sinai Peninsula. Jethro is alluded to in rabbinic literature and is mentioned in the Tanakh - Exodus 3:1. Although frequently identified with the Midianite priest Jethro, most modern scholars reject this identification as it is made without any solid grounding. Aside from having no similarity in names, there are chronological differences. Classical commentators, such as Ibn Kathir, say Shu øayb prophesied four generations from Abraham. Shu øayb is believed to have been the son of Mikil, son of Issachar, son of Midian, son of Abraham. Scholars who take this to be true believe that the identification with Jethro is, as a result, rendered irrelevant, as Jethro - who lived at the time of Moses - would have been active hundreds of years later.Abdullah Yusuf Ali: Holy Quran: Text, Translation and Commentary Prophecy in Midian A map of Midian, the area where Shu øayb was sent to prophesy, in Islamic belief The Qur'an states that Shu øayb was appointed by God to be a prophet to the people of Midian. The people of this land were said to be especially notorious for cheating others through dishonesty and for idolatry. Shu øayb's prophecy mainly involved calling the Midianites to the correct path of God, \\"And to Midian [we sent] their brother Shu øayb. He said: 'O my people! serve God, you have no god other than Him; clear proof indeed has come to you from your Lord, therefore give full measure and weight and do not diminish to men their things, and do not make mischief in the land after its reform; this is better for you if you are believers.'\\" and forbidding them to worship false gods. It is also said he told his people to stop being dishonest in their daily activities. Although he preached and prophesied for a sustained period of time, the majority of the people refused to listen to him. Shuayb, however, remained steadfast. He consistently preached powerfully against the wicked, telling them of the punishment that had befallen the sinful before them. Shu øayb warned the people that their ignorance would lead to the destruction of Midian, giving historical examples of earlier prophets, including Noah, Hud, Saleh and Lot, all of whose people had been destroyed by God. The people taunted Shu øayb and told him that, were it not for the prestigious family he came from, he would surely have been stoned to death. Shuayb replied, \\"Is my family of more consideration with you than God?\\" When the Midianites refused to believe, they were destroyed by a mighty earthquake. The Qur'an, however, mentions that Shu øayb, and his believing companions, were rescued from the thunderous punishment. Parallel with other prophets Shuayb's mission is often mentioned in the Qur'an with the mission of Noah, Hud, Saleh and Lot. Scholars have pointed out that these five prophets exemplify the early prophetic missions:Wheeler, A-Z of Prophets in Islam and Judaism, Shuayb The prophet would be sent to his community; the community would pay no attention to his warning and would instead threaten him with punishment; after years of preaching, God would ask him to leave his community and his people would be subsequently destroyed in a punishment. Scholars interpret the listing of the five prophets to be chronological, with Noah being the only prophet in the list who preached before the Great Flood. He was also a descendant of Prophet Abraham. Claimed places-of-burial of Shuayb One claimed tomb of Shu øayb is in Jordan. () It is located west of the town of Mahis, in an area called WƒÅdƒ´ Shu øayb (), although other sites located in the Sinai Peninsula and historical Palestine are also attributed to Shuayb. There is also a tomb in the southwest of Iran (in the village Guriyeh, Shushtar) which has been recorded as the tomb of Shuayb.Documents, Asare-Sabti web.archive.org Retrieved 17 Nov 2018 Another site recognized by Druze as the tomb of Shu øayb, whom they also call \\"Nabi Shu'ayb\\", is located near Hittin in the Lower Galilee.

The Quran states that Musa was sent by God to the Pharaoh of Egypt and his establishments and the Israelites for guidance and warning. Musa is mentioned more in the Qur'an than any other individual, and his life is narrated and recounted more than that of any other prophet.Annabel Keeler, \\"Moses from a Muslim Perspective\\", in: Solomon, Norman; Harries, Richard; Winter, Tim (eds.), Abraham's children: Jews, Christians, and Muslims in conversation , T&T; Clark Publ. (2005), pp. 55‚Äì66. According to Islam, all Muslims must have faith in every prophet (nabi) and messenger (rasul) which includes Musa and his brother. The Qur'an states: Musa is considered to be a prophetic predecessor to Muhammad. The tale of Musa is generally seen as a spiritual parallel to the life of Muhammad, and Muslims consider many aspects of their lives to be shared. Islamic literature also describes a parallel between their believers and the incidents which occurred in their lifetimes. The exodus of the Israelites from Egypt is considered similar to the (migration) from Mecca made by the followers of Muhammad. Musa is also very important in Islam for having been given the revelation of the Torah. Moreover, according to Islamic tradition, Musa was one of the many prophets Muhammad met in the event of the Mi'raj, when he ascended through the seven heavens., During the Mi'raj, Musa is said to have urged Muhammad to ask God to reduce the number of required daily prayers until only the five obligatory prayers remained. Musa is further revered in Islamic literature, which expands upon the incidents of his life and the miracles attributed to him in the Qur'an and hadith, such as his direct conversation with God. Historical narrative in Islam =Youth= According to Islamic tradition, Musa was born into a family of Israelites living in Egypt. Of his family, Islamic tradition generally names his father 'Imram, corresponding to the Amram of the Hebrew Bible, and traditional genealogies name Levi as his ancestor.Stories of the Prophets, Ibn Kathir, The Story of Moses, c. 1350 C.E. Islam states that Musa was born in a time when the ruling Pharaoh had enslaved the Israelites after the time of the prophet Joseph (Yusuf). Around the time of Musa's birth, Islamic literature states that the Pharaoh had a dream in which he saw fire coming from the city of Jerusalem, which burnt everything in his kingdom except in the land of the Israelites. (Other stories said that the Pharaoh dreamt of a little boy who caught the Pharaoh's crown and destroyed it.) although there is no authentic islamic reference to whether the dreams actually occurred. When the Pharaoh was informed that one of the male children would grow up to overthrow him, he ordered the killing of all newborn Israelite males in order to prevent the prediction from occurring. Islamic literature further states that the experts of economics in Pharaoh's court advised him that killing the male infants of the Israelites would result in loss of manpower. Therefore, they suggested that the male infants should be killed in one year but spared the next. Aaron was born in the year in which infants were spared, while Moses was born in the year in which infants were to be killed. On the Nile Asiya (depicted with long black tresses) and her servants, having finished bathing, find baby Moses in the Nile. Their clothes hang in the trees while the river waves and crests are done in the Chinese style. Illustration from the Persian Jami' al-tawarikh According to Islamic tradition, Musa's mother suckled him secretly during this period. The Qur'an states that when they were in danger of being caught, God inspired her to put him in a basket and set him adrift on the Nile.Quran 28:7 She instructed her daughter to follow the course of the ark and to report back to her. As her daughter followed the ark along the riverbank, Musa was discovered by the Pharaoh's wife, Asiya, who convinced the Pharaoh to adopt him. The Qur'an states that when Asiya ordered wet nurses for Musa, Musa refused to be breastfed. Islamic tradition states that this was because God had forbidden Musa from being fed by any wet nurse in order to reunite him with his mother. His sister worried that Moses had not been fed for some time, so she appeared to the Pharaoh and informed him that she knew someone who could feed him. Islamic tradition states that after being questioned, she was ordered to bring the woman being discussed. The sister brought their mother who fed Moses and thereafter she was appointed as the wet nurse of Moses. Test of prophecy According to Isra'iliyat hadith, during his childhood when Musa was playing on the Pharaoh's lap, he grabbed the Pharaoh's beard and slapped him in the face. This action prompted the Pharaoh to consider Musa as the Israelite who would overthrow him, and the Pharaoh wanted to kill Musa. The Pharaoh's wife persuaded him not to kill him because he was an infant. Instead, he decided to test Musa. Two plates were set before young Musa, one contained rubies and the other held glowing coals. Musa reached out for the rubies, but the angel Gabriel directed his hand to the coals. Musa grabbed a glowing coal and put it in his mouth, burning his tongue. After the incident Musa suffered from a speech defect but was spared by the Pharaoh. Escape to Midian The Midian Mountains near Haql on the coast of the Gulf of Aqaba, which separates Midian in the northern part of the Arabian Peninsula and Ash-Shaam from the Sinai Peninsula in present-day Egypt After having reached adulthood, the Qur'an states that when Musa was passing through a city, he came across an Egyptian fighting with an Israelite. The Israelite man is believed to be \\"Sam'ana\\" known in the bible to be a Samaritan, who asked musa for his assistance against the Egyptian. Musa attempted to intervene and became involved in the dispute. In Islamic tradition, Musa struck the Egyptian in a state of anger which resulted in his death. Musa then repented to God and the following day, he again came across the same Israelite fighting with another Egyptian. The Israelite again asked Musa for help, and as Musa approached the Israelite, he reminded Musa of his manslaughter and asked if Musa intended to kill him. Musa was reported and the Pharaoh ordered Musa to be killed. However, Musa fled to the desert after being alerted to his punishment. According to Islamic tradition, after Musa arrived in Midian, he witnessed two female shepherds driving back their flocks from a well. Musa approached them and inquired about their work as shepherds and their retreat from the well. Upon hearing their answers and the old age of their father, Musa watered their flocks for them. The two shepherdesses returned to their home and informed their father of the incident. The Qur'an states that they invited Musa to a feast. At that feast, their father asked Musa to work for him for a period of eight or ten years, in return for marriage to one of his daughters. Moses consented and worked for him during the period. =Preaching= Call to prophethood This is believed to be the Biblical Mount Sinai, where Moses first spoke to God. According to the Qur'an, Musa departed for Egypt along with his family after completing the time period. The Qur'an states that during their travel, as they stopped near the Tur, Musa observed a large fire and instructed the family to wait until he returned with fire for them. When Musa reached the Valley of Tuwa, God called out to him from the right side of the valley from a tree, on what is revered as Al-Buq‚Äòah Al-MubƒÅrakah (\\"The Blessed Ground\\") in the Qur'an. Musa was commanded by God to remove his shoes and was informed of his selection as a prophet, his obligation of prayer and the Day of Judgment. Musa was then ordered to throw his rod which turned into a snake and later instructed to hold it. The Qur'an then narrates Musa being ordered to insert his hand into his clothes and upon revealing it would shine a bright light. God states that these are signs for the Pharaoh, and orders Musa to invite Pharaoh to the worship of one God. Musa states his fear of Pharaoh and requests God to heal his speech impediment, and grant him his brother Aaron (Harun) as a helper. According to Islamic tradition, both of them stated their fear of Pharaoh but were assured by God that He would be observing them and commands them to inform the Pharaoh to free the Israelites. Therefore, they depart to preach to the Pharaoh. Arrival at Pharaoh's court When Musa and Haroon arrived in the court of Pharaoh and proclaimed their prophethood to the Pharaoh, the Pharaoh began questioning Musa about the God he followed. The Qur'an narrates that Musa answered the Pharaoh by stating that he followed the God who gave everything its form and guided them. The Pharaoh then inquires about the generations who passed before them and Musa answers that knowledge of the previous generations was with God. The Qur'an also mentions the Pharaoh questioning Musa: ‚ÄúAnd what is the Lord of the worlds?‚Äù Musa replies that God is the lord of the heavens, the earth and what is between them. The Pharaoh then reminds Musa of his childhood with them and the killing of the man he had done. Musa admitted that he had committed the deed in ignorance, but insisted that he was now forgiven and guided by God. Pharaoh accused him of being mad and threatened to imprison him if he continued to proclaim that the Pharaoh was not the true god. Musa informed him that he had come with manifest signs from God. In response, the Pharaoh demanded to see the signs. Musa threw his staff to the floor and it turned into a serpent. He then drew out his hand and it shined a bright white light. The Pharaoh's counselors advised him that this was sorcery and on their advice he summoned the best sorcerers in the kingdom. Pharaoh challenged him to a battle between him and the Pharaoh's magicians, asking him to choose the day. Musa chose the day of a festival. Confrontation with sorcerers Pharaoh watches a serpent devour a demon in the presence of Musa; from a manuscript of Qisas al-Anbiya, c. 1540. When the sorcerers came to the Pharaoh, he promised them that they would be amongst the honored among his assembly if they won. On the day of the festival of Egypt, Moses granted the sorcerers the chance to perform first and warned them that God would expose their tricks. The Qur'an states that the sorcerers bewitched the eyes of the observers and caused them terror. The summoned sorcerers threw their rods on the floor and they appeared to change into snakes by the effect of their magic. At first, Moses became concerned witnessing the tricks of the magicians, but was assured by God to not be worried. When Moses reacted likewise with his rod, the serpent devoured all the snakes. The sorcerers realized that they had witnessed a miracle. They proclaimed belief in the message of Moses and fell onto their knees in prostration despite threats from the Pharaoh. Pharaoh was enraged by this and accused them of working under Moses. He warned them that if they insisted in believing in Moses, that he would cut their hands and feet on opposite sides, and crucify them on the trunks of palm trees for their firmness in their faith. The magicians, however, remained steadfast to their newfound faith and were killed by Pharaoh. =Exodus= Plagues of Egypt After losing against Moses, the Pharaoh continued to plan against Moses and the Israelites, and ordered meetings of the ministers, princes and priests. According to the Qur'an, the Pharaoh is reported to have ordered his minister, Haman, to build a tower so that he \\"may look at the God of Moses\\". Gradually, Pharaoh began to fear that Moses may convince the people that he was not the true god, and wanted to have Moses killed. After this threat, a man from the family of Pharaoh, who had years ago warned Moses, came forth and warned the people of the punishment of God for the wrongdoers and reward for the righteous. The Pharaoh defiantly refused to allow the Israelites to leave Egypt. The Qur'an states that God decreed punishments over him and his people. These punishments came in the form of floods that demolished their dwellings, swarms of locust that destroyed the crops, pestilence of lice that made their life miserable, toads that croaked and sprang everywhere, and the turning of all drinking water into blood. Each time the Pharaoh was subjected to humiliation, his defiance became greater. The Qur'an mentions that God instructed Moses to travel at night with the Israelites, and warned them that they would be pursued. The Pharaoh chased the Israelites with his army after realizing that they had left during the night. Splitting of the sea Having escaped and then being pursued by the Egyptians, the Israelites stopped when they reached the seafront. The Israelites exclaimed to Moses that they would be overtaken by Pharaoh and his army. The Qur'an narrates God commanded Moses to strike the Red Sea with his staff, instructing them not to fear being overtaken or drowning. Upon striking the sea, it divided into two parts, that allowed the Israelites to pass through. The Pharaoh witnessed the sea splitting alongside his army, but as they also tried to pass through, the sea closed in on them.Quran 7:36 As he was about to die, Pharaoh claimed belief in the God of Moses and the Israelites, but his belief was rejected by God. The Qur'an states that the body of the Pharaoh was made a sign and warning for all future generations. As the Israelites continued their journey to the Promised Land, they came upon a people who were worshipping idols. The Israelites requested to have an idol to worship, but Moses refused and stated that the polytheists would be destroyed by God. They were granted manna and quail as sustenance from God, but the Israelites asked Moses to pray to God for the earth to grow lentils, onions, herbs and cucumbers for their sustenance. When they stopped in their travel to a promised land due to their lack of water, Moses was commanded by God to strike a stone, and upon its impact twelve springs came forth, each for a specific tribe of the Israelites. =Years in the wilderness= Revelation of the Torah The revelation of the Torah at Mount Sinai as depicted in Biblical illustrations After leaving the promised land, Moses led the Israelites to Mount Sinai (the Tur). Upon arrival, Moses left the people, instructing them that Aaron was to be their leader during his absence. Moses was commanded by God to fast for thirty days and to then proceed to the valley of Tuwa for guidance. God ordered Moses to fast again for ten days before returning. After completing his fasts, Moses returned to the spot where he had first received his miracles from God. He took off his shoes as before and went down into prostration. Moses prayed to God for guidance, and he begged God to reveal himself to him. It is narrated in the Qur'an that God told him that it would not be possible for Moses to perceive God, but that He would reveal himself to the mountain stating: \\"By no means canst thou see Me (direct); But look upon the mount; if it abide in its place, then shalt thou see Me.\\" When God revealed himself to the mountain, it instantaneously turned into ashes, and Moses lost consciousness. When he recovered, he went down in total submission and asked forgiveness of God. Moses was then given the Ten Commandments by God as Guidance and as Mercy. Meanwhile, in his absence, a man named Samiri had created a Golden Calf, proclaiming it to be the God of Moses. The people began to worship it. Aaron attempted to guide them away from the Golden Calf, but the Israelites refused to do so until Moses had returned. Moses, having thus received the scriptures for his people, was informed by God that the Israelites had been tested in his absence and they had gone astray by worshiping the Golden Calf. Moses came down from the mountain and returned to his people. The Qur'an states that Moses, in his anger, grabbed hold of Aaron by his beard and admonished him for doing nothing to stop them. But when Aaron told Moses of his fruitless attempt to stop them, Moses understood his helplessness and they both prayed to God for forgiveness. Moses then questioned Samiri for creating the Golden Calf. Samiri replied that it had occurred to him and he had done so. Samiri was exiled and the Golden Calf was burned to ashes, and the ashes were thrown into the sea. The wrong-doers who had worshipped the Calf were ordered to be killed for their crime. Moses then chose seventy elites from among the Israelites and ordered them to pray for forgiveness. Shortly thereafter, the elders travelled alongside Moses to witness the speech between Moses and God. Despite witnessing the speech between them, they refused to believe until they saw God with their own eyes, so as punishment, a thunderbolt killed them. Moses prayed for their forgiveness, and they were resurrected and returned to camp and set up a tent dedicated to worshiping God as Aaron had taught them from the Torah. They resumed their journey towards the promised land. The Israelites and the cow Islamic exegesis narrates the incident of an old and pious man who lived among the Israelites and earned his living honestly. As he was dying, he placed his wife, his little son, and his only possession, a calf in God's care, instructing his wife to take the calf and leave it in a forest. His wife did as she was told, and after a few years when the son had grown up, she informed him about the calf. The son traveled to the forest with a rope. He prostrated and prayed to God to return the calf to him. As the son prayed, the now-grown cow stopped beside him. The son took the cow with him. The son was also pious and earned his living as a lumberjack. One wealthy man among the Israelites died and left his wealth to his son. The relatives of the wealthy son secretly murdered the son in order to inherit his wealth. The other relatives of the son came to Moses and asked his help in tracing the killers. Moses instructed them to slaughter a cow and cut out its tongue, and then place it on the corpse, and that this would reveal the killers. This confused the relatives who did not believe Moses, and did not understand why they were instructed to slaughter a cow when they were trying to find the killers. They accused Moses of joking, but Moses managed to convince them that he was serious. Hoping to delay the process, the relatives asked the type and age of the cow they should slaughter, but Moses told them that it was neither old nor young but in-between the two ages. Instead of searching for the cow described, they inquired about its colour, to which Moses replied that it was yellow. They asked Moses for more details, and he informed them that it was unyoked, and did not plow the soil nor did it water the tilth. The relatives and Moses searched for the described cow, but the only cow that they found to fit the description belonged to the orphaned youth. The youth refused to sell the cow without consulting his mother. All of them traveled together to the youth's home. The mother refused to sell the cow, despite the relatives constantly increasing the price. They urged the orphaned son to tell his mother to be more reasonable. However, the son refused to sell the cow without his mother's agreement, claiming that he would not sell it even if they offered to fill its skin with gold. At this the mother agreed to sell it for its skin filled with gold. The relatives and Moses consented, and the cow was slaughtered and the corpse was touched by the tongue. The corpse rose back to life and revealed the identity of the killers.  Meeting with Khidr  According to a hadith, once when Moses delivered an impressive sermon, an Israelite inquired if there was anyone more knowledgeable than him. When Moses denied any such person existed, he received a revelation from God, which admonished Moses for not attributing absolute knowledge to God and informed Moses that there was someone named Khidr who was more knowledgeable than him. Upon inquiry, God informed Moses that Khidr would be found at the junction of two seas. God instructed Moses to take a live fish and at the location where it would escape, Khidr would be found. Afterwards Moses departed and traveled alongside with a boy named Yusha (Yeshua bin Nun), until they stopped near a rock where Moses rested. While Moses was asleep, the fish escaped from the basket. When Moses woke up, they continued until they stopped for eating. At that moment, Joshua remembered that the fish had slipped from the basket at the rock. He informed Moses about the fish, and Moses remembered God's statement, so they retraced their steps back to the rock. There they saw Khidr. Moses approached Khidr and greeted him. Khidr instead asked Moses how people were greeted in their land. Moses introduced himself, and Khidr identified him as the prophet of the Israelites. According to the Qur'an, Moses asked Khidr \\"shall I closely follow you on condition that you teach me of what you have been taught\\". Khidr warned that he would not be able to remain patient and consented on the condition that Moses would not question his actions. They walked on the seashore and passed by a ship. The crew of the ship recognized Khidr and offered them to come aboard their ship without any price. When they were on the boat, Khidr took an adze and pulled up a plank. When Moses noticed what Khidr was doing, he was astonished and stopped him. Moses reminded Khidr that the crew had taken them aboard freely. Khidr admonished Moses for forgetting his promise of not asking. Moses stated that he had forgotten and asked to be forgiven. When they left the seashore, they passed by a boy playing with others. Khidr took a hold of the boy's head and killed him. Moses was again astonished by this action and questioned Khidr regarding what he had done. Khidr admonished Moses again for not keeping his promise, and Moses apologized and asked Khidr to leave him if he again questioned Khidr. Both of them traveled on until they came along some people of a village. They asked the villagers for food, but the inhabitants refused to entertain them as guests. They saw therein a wall which was about to collapse, and Khidr repaired the wall. Moses asked Khidr why he had repaired the wall when the inhabitants had refused to entertain them as guests and had not given them food. Moses stated that Khidr could have taken wages for his work. Khidr informed Moses that they were now to part as Moses had broken his promise. Khidr then explained each of his actions. He informed Moses that he had broken the ship with the adze because a ruler who reigned in those parts took all functional ships by force, Khidr had created a defect in order to prevent their ship from being taken by force. Khidr then explained that he had killed the child because he was disobedient to his parents and Khidr feared that the child would overburden them with his disobedience, and explained that God would replace him with a better one who was more obedient and had more affection. Khidr then explained that he had fixed the wall because it belonged to two hapless children whose father was pious. God wished to reward them for their piety. Khidr stated that there was a treasure hidden underneath the wall and by repairing the wall now, the wall would break in the future and when dealing with the broken wall, the orphans would find the treasure.  Other incidents  The sayings of Muhammad (hadith), Islamic literature and Qur'anic exegesis also narrate some incidents of the life of Moses. Moses used to bathe apart from the other Israelites who all bathed together. This led the Bani Israel to say that Moses did so due to a scrotal hernia. One day when Moses was bathing in seclusion, he put his clothes on a stone which then fled with his clothes. Moses rushed after the stone and the Bani Israel saw him and said, 'By Allah, Moses has got no defect in his body.\\" Moses then beat the stone with his clothes, and Abu Huraira stated, \\"By Allah! There are still six or seven marks present on the stone from that excessive beating.\\" . In a hadith, Muhammad states that the stone still had three to five marks due to Moses hitting it. =Death= Maqamu Musa, Jerico, Jerusalam Haroon died shortly before Moses. It is reported in a Sunni hadith that when the angel of death, came to Moses, Moses slapped him in the eye. The angel returned to God and told him that Moses did not want to die. God told the angel to return and tell Moses to put his hand on the back of an ox and for every hair that came under his hand he would be granted a year of life. When Moses asked God what would happen after the granted time, God informed him that he would die after the period. Moses, therefore, requested God for death at his current age near the Promised Land \\"at a distance of a stone's throw from it.\\"  Martyrdom Moreover, by indicating that Moses wants to be separated from Aaron, his brother, many of the Israelites proclaim that Moses killed Aaron on the mountain to secure this so-called separation. However, according to the accounts of al-Tabari, Aaron died of natural causes: ‚ÄúWhen they [Moses and Aaron] fell asleep, death took Aaron.... When he was dead, the house was taken away, the tree disappeared, and the bed was raised to heaven‚Äù. When Moses returned to the Children of Israel, his followers, from the mountain without Aaron, they were found saying that Moses killed Aaron because he had envied their love for him, for Aaron was more forbearing and more lenient with them. This notion would strongly indicate that Moses could have indeed killed Aaron to secure the separation in which he prayed to God for. To redeem his faith to his followers though, al- Tabari quotes Moses by saying ‚ÄúHe was my brother. Do you think that I would kill him?‚Äù. As stated in the Shorter Encyclopedia of Islam, it was recorded that Moses recited two rak‚Äôahs to regain the faith of his followers. God answers Moses‚Äô prayers by making the bed of Aaron descend from heaven to earth so that the Children of Israel could witness the truth that Aaron died of natural causes. The unexpected death of Aaron appears to make the argument that his death is merely an allusion to the mysterious and miraculous death of Moses. In the accounts of Moses‚Äô death, al-Tabari reports, ‚Äú[W]hile Moses was walking with his servant Joshua, a black wind suddenly approached. When Joshua saw it, he thought that the Hour‚Äîthe hour of final judgement‚Äîwas at hand. He clung to Moses‚Ä¶. But Moses withdrew himself gently from under his shirt, leaving it in Joshua‚Äôs hand‚Äù. This mysterious death of Moses is also asserted in Deuteronomy 34:5, ‚ÄúAnd Moses the servant of the LORD died there in Moab.‚Äù There is no explanation to why Moses may have died or why Moses may have been chosen to die: there is only this mysterious ‚Äúdisappearance.‚Äù According to Islamic tradition, Moses is buried at Maqam El-Nabi Musa, Jericho. Although the death of Moses seems to be a topic of mysterious questioning, it is not the main focus of this information. However, according to Arabic translation of the word martyr, shahid‚Äîto see, to witness, to testify, to become a model and paradigm ‚Äì is the person who sees and witnesses, and is therefore the witness, as if the martyr himself sees the truth physically and thus stands firmly on what he sees and hears. To further this argument, in the footnotes of the Qur'an translated by M.A.S. Abdel Haleem, ‚ÄúThe noun shahid is much more complex than the term martyr‚Ä¶.The root of shahid conveys ‚Äòto witness, to be present, to attend, to testify, and/or to give evidence‚Äô‚Äù. Additionally, Haleem notes, that the martyrs in the Qur‚Äôan are chosen by God to witness Him in Heaven. This act of witnessing is given to those who are ‚Äúgiven the opportunity to give evidence of the depth of their faith by sacrificing their worldly lives, and will testify with the prophets on the Day of Judgment‚Äù. This is supported in the Qur'an 3:140, ‚Äú‚Ä¶if you have suffered a blow, they too have the upper hand. We deal out such days among people in turn, for God to find out who truly believes, for Him to choose martyrs from among you‚Ä¶.‚Äù It is also stated in the Qur'an, that the scriptures in which Moses brought forth from God to the Children of Israel were seen as the light and guidance of God, himself (Qur'an 6:91). This strongly indicates that Moses died as a martyr: Moses died being a witness to God; Moses died giving his sacrifice to the worldly views of God; and Moses died in the act of conveying the message of God to the Children of Israel. Although his death remains a mystery and even though he did not act in a religious battle, he did in fact die for the causation of a Religious War. A war that showcased the messages of God through scripture. In light of this observation, John Renard claims that Muslim tradition distinguishes three types of super-natural events: ‚Äúthe sign worked directly by God alone; the miracle worked through a prophet; and the marvel effected through a non-prophetic figure‚Äù. If these three types of super- natural events are put into retrospect with the understanding of martyrdom and Moses, the aspect of being a martyr plays out to resemble the overall understanding of what ‚Äúislam‚Äù translates to. The concept of martyrdom in Islam is linked with the entire religion of Islam. This whole process can be somehow understood if the term 'Islam' is appreciated. This is because being a derivate of the Arabic root salama, which means 'surrender' and 'peace', Islam is a wholesome and peaceful submission to the will of God. Just like Moses is an example of the surrender to God, the term martyr further re-enforces the notion that through the signs, the miracle, and the marvel the ones chosen by God are in direct correlation to the lives of the prophets. In conclusion, although the death of Moses was a mysterious claim by God; and the fact that Moses appeared to have died without partaking in some sort of physical religious battle, may lead one to believe that Moses does not deserve the entitlement of being a martyr. The framework of Moses described the spiritual quest and progress of the individual soul‚Äôs as it unfolds to reveal the relationship to God. Nevertheless, because of his actions, his ability to be a witness, and his success as being a model for the Children of Israel his life was a buildup to the ideals of martyrdom. His death and his faithful obligations toward God have led his mysterious death to be an example of a true prophet and a true example of a martyrdom. =Isra and Mi'raj= During his Night Journey (Isra), Muhammad is known to have led Moses along with Jesus, Abraham and all other prophets in prayer. Moses is mentioned to be among the prophets which Muhammad met during his ascension to heaven (Mi'raj) alongside Gabriel. According to the Sunni view: Moses and Muhammad are reported to have exchanged greeting with each other and he is reported to have cried due to the fact that the followers of Muhammad were going to enter Heaven in greater numbers than his followers. When God enjoined fifty prayers to the community to Muhammad and his followers, Muhammad once again encountered Moses, who asked what had been commanded by God. When Moses was told about the fifty prayers, he advised Muhammad to ask a reduction in prayers for his followers. When Muhammad returned to God and asked for a reduction, he was granted his request. Once again he met Moses, who again inquired about the command of God. Despite the reduction, Moses again urged Muhammad to ask for a reduction. Muhammad again returned and asked for a reduction. This continued until only five prayers were remaining. When Moses again told Muhammad to ask for a reduction, Muhammad replied that he was shy of asking again. Therefore, the five prayers were finally enjoined upon the Muslim community. Title =Kalimullah= Musa is given the title Kalimullah (, Meaning: The one who conversed with God) in Islam. In Islamic thought Moses with a cane in his hand, 15th century Persian miniature, Czartoryski Museum Moses is revered as a prominent prophet and messenger in Islam, his narrative is recounted the most among the prophets in the Qur'an. He is regarded by Muslims as one of the five most prominent prophets in Islam along with Jesus (Isa), Abraham (Ibrahim), Noah (Nuh) and Muhammad. These five prophets are known as Ulu‚Äôl azm prophets, the prophets that were favoured by God and are described in the Qur'an to be endowed with determination and perseverance. Islamic tradition describes Moses being granted many miracles, including the glowing hand and his staff which could turn into a snake. The life of Moses is often described as a parallel to that of Muhammad. Both are regarded as being ethical and exemplary prophets. Both are regarded as lawgivers, ritual leaders, judges and the military leaders for their people. Islamic literature also identifies a parallel between their followers and the incidents of their history. The exodus of the Israelites is often viewed as a parallel to the migration of the followers of Muhammad. The drowning and destruction of the Pharaoh and his army is also described to be a parallel to the Battle of Badr. In Islamic tradition along with other miracles bestowed to Moses such as the radiant hand and his staff Moses is revered as being a prophet who was specially favored by God and conversed directly with Him, unlike other prophets who received revelation by God through an intervening angel. Moses received the Torah directly from God. Despite conversing with God, the Qur'an states that Moses was unable to see God. For these feats Moses is revered in Islam as Kalim Allah, meaning the one who talked with God. =Revealed scripture= handwritten copy of the Torah. In Islam, Moses is revered as the receiver of a scripture known as the Torah (Tawrat). The Qur'an describes the Torah to be ‚Äúguidance and a light\\" for the Israelites and that it contained teachings about the Oneness of God, prophethood and the Day of Judgment. It is regarded as containing teachings and laws for the Israelites which was taught and practiced by Moses and Aaron to them. Among the books of the complete Hebrew Bible, only the Torah, meaning the books of Genesis, Deuteronomy, Numbers, Leviticus and Exodus are considered to divinely revealed instead of the whole Tanakh or the Old Testament. The Qur'an mentions the Ten Commandments given to the Israelites through Moses which it claims contained guidance and understanding of all things. The Qur'an states that the Torah was the \\"furqan\\" meaning difference, a term which the Qur'an is regarded as having used for itself as well. The Qur'an states that Moses preached the same message as Muhammad and the Torah foretold that arrival of Muhammad. Modern Muslim scholars such as Mark N. Swanson and David Richard Thomas cite Deuteronomy 18:15‚Äì18 as foretelling the arrival of Muhammad. Some Muslims believe that the Torah has been corrupted (tahrif). The exact nature of the corruption has been discussed among scholars. The majority of Muslim scholars including Ibn Rabban and Ibn Qutayba have stated that the Torah had been distorted in its interpretation rather than in its text. The scholar Tabari considered the corruption to be caused by distortion of the meaning and interpretation of the Torah. Tabari considered the learned rabbis of producing writings alongside the Torah, which were based on their own interpretations of the text. The rabbis then reportedly \\"twisted their tongues\\" and made them appear as though they were from the Torah. In doing so, Al-Tabari concludes that they added to the Torah what was not originally part of it and these writings were used to denounce the prophet Muhammad and his followers. Tabari also states that these writings of the rabbis were mistaken by some Jews to be part of the Torah. A minority view held among scholars such as Al-Maqdisi is that the text of the Torah itself was corrupted. Maqdisi claimed that the Torah had been distorted in the time of Moses, by the seventy elders when they came down from Mount Sinai. Maqdisi states that the Torah was further corrupted in the time of Ezra, when his disciples made additions and subtractions in the text narrated by Ezra. Maqdisi also stated that discrepancies between the Jewish Torah, the Samaritan Torah and the Greek Septuagint pointed to the fact that the Torah was corrupted. Ibn Hazm viewed the Torah of his era as a forgery and considered various verses as contradicting other parts of the Torah and the Qur'an. Ibn Hazm considered Ezra as the forger of the Torah, who dictated the Torah from his memory and made significant changes to the text. Ibn Hazm accepted some verses which, he stated, foretold the arrival of Muhammad. =In religious sects= Sunni Muslims fast on the Day of Ashura (the tenth day of Muharram (the first month in the Hijri calendar as similar to Yom Kippur which is on the tenth day of Tishrei (the first month of the Hebrew civil year)) to commemorate the liberation of the Israelites from the Pharaoh. Shia Muslims view Moses and his relation to Aaron as a prefiguration of the relation between Muhammad and his cousin, Ali ibn Abi Talib. Ismaili Shias regard Moses as 4th in the line of the seven 'speaking prophets' (natiq), whose revealed law was for all believers to follow. In Sufism Moses is regarded as having a special position, being described as a prophet as well as a spiritual wayfarer. The author Paul Nwyia notes that the Qur'anic accounts of Moses have inspired Sufi exegetes to \\"meditate upon his experience as being the entry into a direct relationship with God, so that later the Sufis would come to regard him as the perfect mystic called to enter into the mystery of God\\". Muslim scholars such as Norman Solomon and Timothy Winter state without naming that some Sufi commentators excused Moses from the consequence of his request to be granted a vision of God, as they considered that it was \\"the ecstasy of hearing God which compelled him to seek completion of union through vision\\". The Qur'anic account of the meeting of Moses and Khidr is also noted by Muslim writers as being of special importance in Sufi tradition. Some writers such as John Renard and Phyllis G. Jestice note that Sufi exegetes often explain the narrative by associating Moses for possessing exoteric knowledge while attributing esoteric knowledge to Khidr. The author John Renard states that Sufis consider this as a lesson, \\"to endure his apparently draconian authority in view of higher meanings\\". =In Islamic literature= Moses is also revered in Islamic literature, which narrates and explains different parts of the life of Moses. The Muslim scholar and mystic Rumi, who titles Moses as the \\"spirit enkindler\\" also includes a story of Moses and a shepherd in his book, the Masnavi. The story narrates the horror of Moses, when he encounters a shepherd who is engaged in anthropomorphic devotions to God. Moses accuses the shepherd of blasphemy; when the shepherd repents and leaves, Moses is rebuked by God for \\"having parted one of His servants from Him\\". Moses seeks out the shepherd and informs him that he was correct in his prayers. The authors Norman Solomon and Timothy Winter regard the story to be \\"intended as criticism of and warning to those who in order to avoid anthropomorphism, negate the Divine attributes\\". Rumi mainly mentions the life of Moses by his encounter with the burning tree, his white hand, his struggle with the Pharaoh and his conversation with God on Mount Sinai. According to Rumi, when Moses came across the tree in the valley of Tuwa and perceived the tree consumed by fire, he in fact saw the light of a \\"hundred dawns and sunrises\\". Rumi considered the light a \\"theater\\" of God and the personification of the love of God. Many versions of the conversation of Moses and God are presented by Rumi; in all versions Moses is commanded to remove his footwear, which is interpreted to mean his attention to the world. Rumi commented on the Qur'anic verse considering the speech of God to be in a form accessible only to prophets instead of verbal sounds. Rumi considers the miracles given to Moses as assurance to him of the success of his prophethood and as a means of persuasion to him to accept his mission. Rumi regarded Moses as the most important of the messenger-prophets before Muhammad. The Shi'a Qur'anic exegesis scholar and thinker Muhammad Husayn Tabatabaei, in his commentary Balance of Judgment on the Exegesis of the Qur'an attempted to show the infallibility of Moses in regard to his request for a vision of God and his breaking of his promise to Khidr as a part of the Shi'a doctorine of prophetic infallibility (Ismah). Tabatabaei attempted to solve the problem of vision by using various philosophical and theological arguments to state that the vision for God meant a necessary need for knowledge. According to Tabatabaei, Moses was not responsible for the promise broken to Khidr as he had added \\"God willing\\" after his promise. The Islamic reformist and activist Sayyid Qutb, also mentions Moses in his work, In the Shade of the Qur'an. Sayyid Qutb interpreted the narrative of Moses, keeping in view the sociological and political problems facing the Islamic world in his era; he considered the narrative of Moses to contain teachings and lessons for the problems which faced the Muslims of his era. According to Sayyid Qutb, when Moses was preaching to the Pharaoh, he was entering the \\"battle between faith and oppression\\". Qutb believed that Moses was an important figure in Islamic teachings as his narrative symbolized the struggle to \\"expel evil and establish righteousness in the world\\" which included the struggle from oppessive tyrants, a struggle which Qutb considered was the core teaching of the Islamic faith. The Sixth Imam, Ja'far al-Sadiq, regarded the journey of Moses to Midian and to the valley of Tuwa as a spiritual journey. The turning of the face of Moses towards Midian is stated to be the turning of his heart towards God. His prayer to God asking for help of is described to be his awareness of his need. The commentary alleged to the Sixth Imam then states the command to remove his shoes symbolized the command to remove everything from his heart except God. These attributes are stated to result in him being honoured by God's speech. The Andalusian Sufi mystic and philosopher, Ibn Arabi wrote about Moses in his book The Bezels of Wisdom dedicating a chapter discussing \\"the Wisdom of Eminence in the word of Moses\\". Ibn Arabi considered Moses to be a \\"fusion\\" of the infants murdered by the Pharaoh, stating that the spiritual reward which God had chosen for each of the infants manifested in the character of Moses. According to Ibn Arabi, Moses was from birth an \\"amalgam\\" of younger spirits acting on older ones. Ibn Arabi considered the ark to be the personification of his humanity while the water of the river Nile to signifiy his imagination, rational thought and sense perception. Burial place Grave, Nabi Musa, Jerico-Jerusalam Name plate nabi musa, Jerico-Jerusalam The grave of Moses is located at Maqam El-Nabi Musa, which lies south of Jericho and east of Jerusalem in the Judean wilderness. A side road to the right of the main Jerusalem-Jericho road, about beyond the sign indicating sea level, leads to the site. The Fatimid, Taiyabi and Dawoodi Bohra sects also believe in the same. The main body of the present shrine, mosque, minaret and some rooms were built during the reign of Baibars, a Mamluk Sultan, in 1270 AD. Over the years Nabi Musa was expanded, protected by walls, and includes 120 rooms in its two levels which hosted the visitors.

On February 3, 2008, amidst declining average viewership, Animal Planet underwent a major revamp in its programming and branding. The new lineup placed a larger focus on series portraying animals as \\"characters\\" in their own right, and more \\"aggressive\\" and story-based entertainment series targeting mature viewers 13-49 (such as Escape to Chimp Eden and the reality documentary series Whale Wars), as opposed to traditional nature documentaries and family viewing. The network also adopted a new logo, replacing its previous \\"elephant and globe\\" emblem with a stylized wordmark, and the new slogan \\"Same Planet, Different World\\". Network president Marjorie Kaplan explained that Animal Planet had been too \\"soft\\" and family-oriented, and that it was aiming to be \\"more aggressive and tapping into the instinctual nature of compelling animal content.\\" In April 2010, Animal Planet introduced a new slogan and marketing campaign, \\"Surprisingly Human,\\" as an evolution of the 2008 rebranding. The slogan reflected Animal Planet's increasing number of personality-based series following animal-related investigations and occupations, such as River Monsters. In April 2012, Animal Planet's entertainment-oriented direction was criticized after it broadcast Mermaids: The Body Found‚Äîa fictional documentary suggesting that mermaids were real. Despite its fictitious content, the documentary was widely viewed, and a follow-up entitled Mermaids: The New Evidence set an all-time ratings record for the channel. =2018 rebranding= On October 15, 2018, Animal Planet unveiled a new logo, featuring a symbol of a jumping elephant resembling the original logo. The new branding symbolizes a new mission of \\"keeping the childhood joy and wonder of animals alive by bringing people up close in every way.\\" The new branding coincided with the October 28 premieres of Crikey!

Each arch consists of a pair of outstretched hands holding crossed swords. The two arches mark the two entrances to Grand Festivities Square and the parade ground constructed to commemorate the Iran‚ÄìIraq War, led by then Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. The arches were opened to the public on 8 August 1989. It is one of Baghdad's visitor attractions and near to The Monument to the Unknown Soldier. Location The two sets of arches mark the entrances to an area known as Zawra Park. In 1986 (two years before the war's end) the government of Iraq began the construction of a festival and parade ground in Zawra Park, near the extensive presidential complex in the center of Baghdad. Known as Grand Festivities Square, it comprised a large parade ground, an extensive review pavilion and a large reflecting pool. The surrounding grassy areas hosted Iraqis during military parades. Adding to the festive appeal of the grounds were three refreshments booths that sold ice cream, cold beverages, and candy. Three monuments were constructed to remember Iraq's pain and suffering as a consequence of the eight-year war. The Victory Arch was the last of the three structures to be built, and it followed on from the construction of the Monument to the Unknown Soldier, (1982) and Al-Shaheed Monument (1983). The three monuments form a unit.Makiya, K. and Al-Khalilm S., The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Saddam Hussein's Iraq, p. 29 The official name of the arches, the Swords of QƒÅdisiyyah, is an allusion to the historical Battle of al-QƒÅdisiyyah, when Arab armies defeated Sassanid Iran (Persia) in the 7th- century, and captured their capital, Ctesiphone where an arch marks the entrance to the ancient Imperial Palace. Zawra Park was home to the Museum of Gifts to the President and a performing arts center. The museum was located on the ground floor of the grand reviewing pavilion where Saddam was known to review the Republican Guard while firing a weapon in the air. The museum contained ordinary items donated by Iraqis during his rule. Items included cheap plastic ornaments and drawings donated by Iraqi children. History Iraq's leading sculptor, Khaled al-Rahal, won the commission to design and execute the construction of the arches, which were based on a concept sketch made by president Saddam Hussein. The design consists of a pair of massive hands emerging from the ground, each holding a sword. However, al-Rahal died in 1987, before the monument was completed, and another eminent Iraqi sculptor, Mohammed Ghani Hikmat, assumed control of the project. Makiya, K.

The monument was built as part of a broader program to beautify the city of Baghdad and to create public works that would help to instil a sense of national pride within the population. Baghdad is now dotted with monuments, including Al-Shaheed Monument and Monument to an Unknown Soldier, and many other statues, fountains and sculptures; all constructed between 1969 and 2003.Brown, B.A. and Feldman, M.H. (eds), Critical Approaches to Ancient Near Eastern Art,Walter de Gruyter, 2014 p.20 The site selected for the monument was where the Muslim Arabs defeated the Persians in 636 CE and is generally seen to be the beginning of Islamic domination of the region. On the day the monument was dedicated in 1990, Saddam rode under the arches astride a white horse. It has been suggested that this was an allusion to the slain Shiite martyr Hussein, killed in Karbala in AD 680, whose death caused the rift between Shiite and Sunni Muslims. The monument, although presenting a triumphalist narrative in relation to the Iran-Iraq war, has assumed a broader symbolism and represents those Iraqis who fell in any war throughout the country's history.Makiya, K. (Al-Khalilm S.), The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Iraq, pp 10-12 Description Victory Arch (detail) The giant hands appear to be bursting from the ground, with helmets of fallen soldiers scattered on the ground. The monument consists of a pair of outstretched arms which appear to be exploding out of the ground, each holding a sword which meet at a central point. The swords, which are made of stainless steel, are based on the weapons carried by Sa\`d ibn Abi Waqqas, the Arab leader at the Battle of Qadisiya (from where the monument derives its Arabic name).Davis, E., \\"The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Iraq,\\" [Book Review], Middle East Journal, (Washington), Vol. 46, No. 1, 1992, p. 102 A small flagpole rises from the point where the swords meet, about above the ground. Al-Rahal used photographs and plaster casts of Saddam's forearms as a model for the design of the hands. Toward the end of the project, after Ghani had taken over, the sculptor personally took an impression of one of Saddam's thumbs, and the resulting fingerprint was added to the mold for one of the arches' thumbs. At the time, Iraq did not have a foundry sufficiently large to cast the sculpture, leading to much of it being made abroad. The arches were made by an international consortium led by the German foundry H+H Metallform. The blades of the stainless steel swords weigh 24 tons each. Cast in Iraq, they are partly composed of metal from guns and tanks of Iraqi soldiers killed in the Iran-Iraq war. The hands and arms of the monument are of bronze, cast in the United Kingdom at the Morris Singer Foundry. The arms rest on concrete plinths, the form of which make the arms appear to burst up out of the ground. Each plinth holds 2,500 helmets (a total of 5,000 helmets) which, Saddam claimed, belonged to Iranian soldiers killed during the war; they are held in nets which allow them to spill onto the ground beneath.Al-Khalil, S. and Makiya, K., The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Iraq, pp 1-5 =Physical specifications= A US soldier poses inside the hands of the Victory Arch in 2004 The monument has a number of elements, each made from different construction materials:Makiya, K., The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Iraq, p.2 ; The exploding ground : Constructed of reinforced concrete, with enemy helmets scattered around ; Forearm and grip :Cast in bronze, each weighing 20 tons, fixed with a reinforced frame, also 20 tons ; Swords : The swords have a slight curve, allowing them to meet in the middle, giving the arched shape.

Recent developments The monument was not destroyed during the first Gulf War, though General Norman Schwarzkopf wanted to remove it. The arches remain standing in what is now the International Zone of Baghdad. An American soldier poses with the Iranian helmets at the base of the Victory Arch In February 2007, it was reported that the new Iraqi government had organized the Committee for Removing Symbols of the Saddam Era and that the Arc of Triumph monument had begun to be dismantled, which drew protests from Iraqi and preservationist groups. The demolition began on Tuesday, 20 February 2007. At that time, chunks had been cut out of the bronze monument. Numerous Iraqi bystanders and coalition troops were seen taking helmets and bits of the monument away as souvenirs. The decision to remove the monument, made by Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, was challenged by US Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad, who blocked the demolition on 21 February. The government of Iraq reversed its earlier plans to demolish the monument.Semple, K., ‚ÄúIraq Confronts Hussein Legacy Cast in Bronze,‚Äù New York Times, 7 April 2007, Online: In February 2011, Iraqi authorities began the restoration of the monument as a sign of reconciliation.\\"Iraq Restores Hussein‚Äôs Victory Arch as Sign of Reconciliation\\", The Columbus Dispatch, 6 February 2011, Online: Legacy The Victory arch is one of Baghdad's most photographed monuments. Visitors who stand in a specific location can be photographed as if their own hands are holding the swords. The hands, which are hollow, present visitors with another photo opportunity- many troops and other coalition visitors have climbed up inside them to look out from the point at which the swords meet the hands, generally to have souvenir pictures taken.

Islamic tradition generally holds that he was the third King of Jewish people, and wise ruler for the nation.Concise Encyclopedia of Islam - Page 374, Cyril Glasse - 1988 Islam views Solomon as one of the elect of God, who was bestowed upon with many God-given gifts, including the ability to speak to animals and jinn. Muslims further maintain that he remained faithful to a one and only God throughout his life; and reigned justly over the whole of the Israelites; was blessed with a level of Kingship which was given to none after him and before him; and fulfilled all of his commandments, being promised nearness to God in Paradise at the end of his life. Arab historians regarded Solomon as one of the greatest rulers around the world.  Narrative in the Quran  = Judgment on the field = In the earliest narrative involving Solomon, the Qur'an (21:78) briefly alludes to a story that Solomon was in the company of his father, when two men came to ask David to judge between them regarding a ·∏•arth (, field). Later Muslim commentators expanded on the allusion, including Al-Tabari, Baidawi, and Ibn Kathir. They said that the first of the two men said that he owned a vineyard of which he took great care the whole year through. But one day, when he was absent, the other man's sheep had strayed into the vineyard and devoured the grapes. He asked to be compensated for this damage.Lives of the Prophets, L. Azzam, David and Solomon, pg. 62, Suhail Academy Upon hearing the man's complaint, Solomon suggested that the owner of the sheep take the other man's vineyard to repair and cultivate until the vines returned to their former state, whereupon he should return it to its owner. At the same time, the owner of the vineyard would care for the sheep and benefit from their wool and milk until his land was returned to him, at which point he would return the sheep to their owner. Solomon's level of judgment, which the Quran says in this particular incident surpassed that of David, would characterize Solomon throughout his life. ·∏§ikmah (Wisdom), according to Muslim tradition, would always be associated with Solomon, who would later even be referred to as SulaimƒÅn al-·∏§akƒ´m (, \\"Solomon the Wise\\"). This story is adapted in the Kebra Nagast, but as a dispute adjudicated by a son of Solomon's. = Reign = The Queen of Sheba When David died, Solomon inherited his position as the Prophetic King of the Israelites. He prayed to God to grant him a Kingdom which would be unlike any after him. God accepted Solomon's prayer and gave him what he pleased. It was at this stage that Solomon began to acquire the many gifts that God would bestow upon him throughout his life. The Qur'an narrates that the wind was made subservient to Solomon, and he could control it at his own will, and that the jinn also came under Solomon's control. The jinn helped strengthen Solomon's reign, and the unbelievers among them along with the Shaitan Robert Lebling Legends of the Fire Spirits: Jinn and Genies from Arabia to Zanzibar I.B.Tauris 2010 were forced building for him monuments. God also caused a miraculous  øayn (, 'fount' or 'spring') of molten qi·π≠r (, 'brass' or 'copper') to flow for Solomon, to be used by the jinn in their construction. Solomon was even taught the languages of various animals, such as ants. The Quran recounts that, one day, Solomon and his army entered a wadin-naml (, valley of the ant). On seeing Solomon and his army, a namlah (, female ant) warned all the others to \\"... get into your habitations, lest Solomon and his hosts crush you (under foot) without knowing it.\\" Immediately understanding what the ant said, Solomon, as always, prayed to God, thanking Him for bestowing upon him such gifts and further avoided trampling over the ant colonies.Lives of the Prophets, L. Azzam, David and Solomon, pg. 63, Suhail Academy Solomon's wisdom, however, was yet another of the gifts he received from God, and Muslims maintain that Solomon never forgot his daily prayer, which was more important to him than any of his gifts.  Conquest of Saba'  Ruins of a temple at Ma'rib, the former capital of Saba' in what is now Yemen. Another important aspect of Solomon's kingship was the size of his army, which consisted of both men and jinn. Solomon would frequently assess his troops and warriors as well as the jinn and all the animals who worked under him. One day, when inspecting his troops, Solomon found the Hud-hud (, Green peafowl or Hoopoe) missing from the assembly. Shortly later, however, the Hud-hud arrived to Solomon's court, saying \\"I have compassed (territory) which thou hast not compassed, and I have come to thee from Saba' with tidings true.\\" The Hud-hud further told Solomon that the people of Sheba worshiped the Sun, but that the woman who ruled the Kingdom was highly intelligent and powerful. Solomon, who listened closely, chose to write a letter to the land of Sheba, through which he would try to convince the people of Sheba to cease in worshiping the Sun, and to come to the worship of God. Solomon ordered the Hud-hud to give the letter to the Queen of Sheba, and then to hide and observe her reaction.Lives of the Prophets, L. Azzam, David and Solomon, pg. 64, Suhail Academy The Hud- hud accepted Solomon's orders, and flew to give the letter to her. The Queen then called her ministers in the court and announced the letter of Solomon stating to the people of Sheba: \\"In the name of Allah the Compassionate the Merciful, I warned you to stop worshiping the sun, and accept Allah as the only God, with Solomon as His Messenger.\\" She asked for suggestions from her minister and administration stating that \\"O my people, I know that you all are powerful and brave warriors, and no one on the face of the Earth can defeat our army, but still I want your opinion.\\" The people of the court replied: \\"You have all the power, and whatever order you deliver, you will find us obedient.\\" Eventually, however, the Queen came to Solomon, announcing IslƒÅm (Submission) to God. = Death = Mausoleum of Sulaiman in the compound of Al-Aqsa Mosque, Old City of Jerusalem The Qur'an relates that Solomon died while he was leaning on his staff. As he remained upright, propped on his staff, the jinn thought he was still alive and supervising them, so they continued to work. They realized the truth only when Allah sent a creature to crawl out of the ground and gnaw at Solomon's staff until his body collapsed. The Qur æan then comments that if they had known the unseen, they would not have stayed in the humiliating torment of being enslaved. According to the Qur'an, the death of Solomon was a lesson to be learned:  Mahammaddim in the Song of Solomon  As inspired by verses of the Qur'an, some Muslims insist that Muhammad (, consonant letters: m-ƒß-m-d) is mentioned in the Song of Songs (5:16) as 'Mahammaddim' (, consonant letters: m-ƒß-m-d-y-m), even though the latter word is usually translated as \\"desirable\\" or \\"lovely\\".

This may include telephone calls made from pay phones, calls placed station-to-station, person-to-person, collect, third number calls, calls billed to a credit card, and certain international calls which cannot be dialed directly. The telephone operator may also be able to assist with determining what kind of technical difficulties are occurring on a phone line, to verify whether a line is busy (Busy Line Verification, or BLV), or left off the hook, and break in on a phone line to request for the caller to clear the line for an incoming call (Busy Line Interruption, or BLI). The latter service is often utilized by emergency police. In addition, operators are often a first point of contact for the elderly wanting information on the current date and time. Before the advent of emergency telephone numbers, operators identified and connected emergency calls to the correct emergency service. Directory assistance was also part of the operator's job. Operator-assisted calls can be more expensive than direct dial calls. In the Bell System, an operator-assisted call had a 50% premium, but only on the initial period, usually 3 minutes. A person-to-person call is an operator-assisted call in which the calling party requests to speak to a specific party and not simply to anyone who answers. The caller is not charged for the call unless the requested party is reached. This method was popular when telephone calls were relatively expensive. The alternative, in which the calling party agrees to talk to whoever answers the telephone, is known as station-to-station. Since the introduction of direct dial telephone service and the subsequent drop in the price of long distance telephone calls, person-to-person service has virtually disappeared. This service may still be used if the calling party wishes to remain anonymous to whoever answered, and wishes to have the operator initiate contact with the desired person. A messenger call has been used in countries in which home telephones are unusual, and before the great boom in cell phones in the early 21st century. A messenger, usually a boy, would go to the recipient‚Äôs location to advise him or her to come to a central location at a designated time to receive a phone call. An operator-assisted conference call or op assist call is one in which the conference call is managed by an operator. The telephone operator will greet each call participant, gather specific information from each participant, introduce key speakers, and manage questions and answers, all from the telephone. A third number call or third party call is an operator assisted telephone call that can be billed to the party other than the calling and called party. The operator calls the third number for the party to accept the charges before the call can proceed. Time and charges was a service often requested of the operator before a call begins. After completion of the call, the operator calls back and specifies the length of the call (in minutes) and the charge for the call. While it was used by guests in a residence or business to compensate the host for use of the phone, it was almost always requested by hotel switchboards so that they could bill the room occupant for the charges before the occupant checked out. Modern telephone systems in hotels make this unnecessary, as the calls are rated automatically by the hotel or by a service provider the hotel has contracted with. (Hotels often contract with resellers that charge unusually high rates, with the profit shared between the reseller and the hotel, thus helping the hotel defray the cost of the telephone system.)

Power ranged from 2,200 to over 3,700 hp (1,640 to 2,760 kW), depending on the model. Developed before World War II, the R-3350's design required a long time to mature before finally being used to power the Boeing B-29 Superfortress. After the war, the engine had matured sufficiently to become a major civilian airliner design, notably in its turbo-compound forms, and was used in the Lockheed L-1049 Super Constellation airliners into the 1990s. The engine is now commonly used on Hawker Sea Fury and Grumman F8F Bearcat Unlimited Class Racers at the Reno Air Races. Its main rival was the Pratt & Whitney R-4360 Wasp Major. Design and development In 1927, Wright Aeronautical introduced its famous \\"Cyclone\\" engine, which powered a number of designs in the 1930s. After merging with Curtiss to become Curtiss-Wright in 1929, an effort was started to redesign the engine to the class. The new Wright R-1820 Cyclone 9 first ran successfully in 1935, and became one of the most-used aircraft engines in the 1930s and WWII, powering all frontline examples (the -C through -G models) of the B-17 Flying Fortress Allied heavy bomber aircraft serving in the war, each powerplant assisted by a General Electric-designed turbocharger for maximum power output at high altitudes. By 1931 Pratt & Whitney had started a development of their equally famous single-row, Wasp nine-cylinder design into a larger and much more powerful fourteen-cylinder, twin-row design ‚Äî the Twin Wasp ‚Äî of a nearly identical 30-liter displacement figure, that would easily compete with this larger, single-row Cyclone. In 1935 Wright followed P&W;'s lead, and developed much larger engines based on the mechanics of the Cyclone. The result was two designs with a somewhat shorter stroke, a 14-cylinder design of almost 43 liters displacement that would evolve into the Twin Cyclone, and a much larger 18-cylinder design that became the R-3350. A larger twin-row 22-cylinder version, the R-4090, was experimented with as a competitor to the 71.5 litre-displacement four-row, 28-cylinder Pratt & Whitney Wasp Major, but was not produced. With Pratt & Whitney starting development of their own 46 liter-displacement 18-cylinder, twin-row high- output radial as the Double Wasp in 1937, Wright's first R-3350 prototype engines ‚Äî itself having a nearly 55 liter displacement figure ‚Äî were initially run in May of the same year. Continued development was slow, both due to the complex nature of the engine, as well as the R-2600 receiving considerably more attention. The R-3350 did not fly until 1941, after the prototype Douglas XB-19 had been redesigned from the Allison V-3420 to accept the R-3350. Things changed dramatically in 1940 with the introduction of a new contract by the USAAC to develop a long-range bomber capable of flying from the US to Germany with a 20,000 lb (9000 kg) bomb load. Although smaller than the Bomber D designs that led to the Douglas XB-19, the new designs required roughly the same amount of power. When preliminary designs were returned in the summer of 1940, three of the four designs were based on the R-3350. Suddenly the engine was seen as the future of army aviation, and serious efforts to get the design into production started. In 1942 Chrysler started the construction of the Dodge Chicago Plant and the new factory, designed by Albert Kahn, was in full operation by early 1944. Wright R-3350 Turbo-Compound radial engine. Two exhaust recovery turbines shown outside impeller casing area (top (silver) and lower (red blading)) that are geared to the crankshaft. By 1943 the ultimate development of the new bomber program, the Boeing B-29 Superfortress, was flying. The engines remained temperamental, and showed an alarming tendency for the rear cylinders to overheat, partially due to minimal clearance between the cylinder baffles and the cowl. A number of changes were introduced into the Superfortress' production line to provide more cooling at low speeds, with the aircraft rushed into operational use in the Pacific in 1944. This proved unwise, as the early B-29 tactics of maximum weights, when combined with the high temperatures of the tropical airfields where B-29s were based, produced overheating problems that were not completely solved, and the engines having an additional tendency to swallow their own valves. Because of a high magnesium content in the potentially combustible crankcase alloy, the resulting engine fires ‚Äî sometimes burning with a core temperature approaching 5,600 ¬∞F (3,100 ¬∞C) ‚Äî were often so intense the main spar could burn through in seconds, resulting in catastrophic wing failure.\\"B-29.\\" fighter-planes.com. Retrieved: 15 September 2011. Early versions of the R-3350 had carburetors, though the poorly-designed elbow entrance to the supercharger led to serious problems with fuel/air distribution. Near the end of WWII, the system was changed to use gasoline direct injection where fuel was injected directly into the combustion chamber. This improved engine reliability. After the war the engine was redesigned and became popular for large aircraft, notably the Lockheed Constellation and Douglas DC-7. Following the war the Turbo- CompoundGunston 2006, p. 247. system was developed to deliver better fuel efficiency. In these versions, three power-recovery turbines (PRT) were inserted into the exhaust piping of each group of six cylinders, and geared to the engine crankshaft by fluid couplings to deliver more power. The PRTs recovered about 20% of the exhaust energy (around ) that would have otherwise been wasted, but reduced engine reliability (Mechanics tended to call them Parts Recovery Turbines, since increased exhaust heat meant a return of the old habit of the engine eating exhaust valves). The fuel burn for the PRT- equipped aircraft was nearly the same as the older Pratt and Whitney R-2800, while producing more useful horsepower.

In the past, collect calls were only possible as an operator-assisted call, but with the introduction of computer-based telephone dialing equipment, it is now possible to place a collect call without using an operator, which is called automated operator services (AOS) as opposed to Home Country Direct (HCD). (Automated reverse charge dialing eliminates a service that could be provided, at a higher fee, only on operator-assisted connections: the person-to-person call, in which there is no charge unless a designated person is available.) Several companies will place collect calls, in competition with local service providers. Collect calls can be made from almost any public pay telephone in the world by following directions posted on or near the phone. Collect calling has been in constant decline since the advent of cellular phones, VOIP products, and Skype, which have brought greatly reduced or free domestic long- distance and international calls. While Mother's Day has the highest number of phone calls, the most collect calls are made on Father's Day.Gogoi, Pallavi. \\"Father's Unspectacular Day.\\" BusinessWeek. 14 June 2005.The Book of Useless Information, Noel Botham, 2002, Perigee, , 500 Mostly Useless Facts djtech.netUseless Facts - 102 Best Facts You Can Impress Your Friends laughbreak.com Other forms of paid communication, such as telegrams and mail, could also be sent as \\"collect\\".

However, in the case of prepaid phones, it is accessible only where there is sufficient credit to call 12550. Telstra ran a reverse charge service called HomeLink during the 1990s and 2000s. Homelink consisted of a 1800 number and pin that could only be linked to the user's home phone service. Calls were billed at a slightly higher cost than a standard local call. HomeLink grew out of popularity with the rise in mobile phones. = Brazil = In Brazil, reverse calls are available for every land or mobile line call. All local reverse calls must be started by dialing 9090 and the desired phone number. If the user is not in the same zone as the recipient the calls must be started by dialing 90 + carrier code + area code + the desired phone number. = India = There is not a simple way to call a 1-800 number in the USA or make a reverse charge call for free in India.

Reverse charge calls can be made for free on some mobile networks, although the person being contacted via this service may be charged a considerable amount for accepting such a call. =United States and Canada= It is generally possible to make a collect call from a landline by dialing \\"0\\" and following automated prompts or using operator assistance. The receiving party must agree to the charges (usually after being informed of the name of the caller) before the call can continue normally. In general, customers can configure their landline or cell phone account to block attempted collect calls. Because the name of the caller is given before charges are accepted, it is possible to communicate a simple message for free by giving an agreed-upon name or simply using the call to synchronize an action (e.g. indicating it is time to meet). This is, however, considered toll fraud and can be prosecuted, although in most cases it is probably unlikely the person could be caught. AT&T; no longer operates a collect call service for the United States. Competitors include 1-800-COLLECT, which does serve VoIP receivers. Verizon terminated the ability to receive collect calls on its landlines in 2016. Prior to the introduction of the toll- free 800 area code in 1967, Zenith numbers in the U.S. and Canada, and Enterprise numbers in the U.S. only, indicated to an operator that the business agreed to automatically accept collect calls to that number.

A telephone call is a connection over a telephone network between the called party and the calling party. First telephone call The first telephone call was made on March 10, 1876 by Alexander Graham Bell. Bell demonstrated his ability to \\"talk with electricity\\" by transmitting a call to his assistant, Thomas Watson. The first words transmitted were \\"Mr Watson, come here. I want to see you.\\" This event has been called Bell's \\"greatest success\\", as it demonstrated the first successful use of the telephone. Although it was his greatest success, he refused to have one in his own home because it was something he invented by mistake and saw it as a distraction from his main studies. Information transmission A telephone call may carry ordinary voice transmission using a telephone, data transmission when the calling party and called party are using modems, or facsimile transmission when they are using fax machines. The call may use land line, mobile phone, satellite phone or any combination thereof. When a telephone call has more than one called party it is referred to as a conference call. When two or more users of the network are sharing the same physical line, it is called a party line or Rural phone line. U.S. President Gerald Ford on the phone If the caller's wireline phone is connected directly to the calling party, when the caller takes their telephone off-hook, the calling party's phone will ring. This is called a hot line or ringdown. Otherwise, the calling party is usually given a tone to indicate they should begin dialing the desired number. In some (now very rare) cases, if the calling party cannot dial calls directly, they will be connected to an operator who places the call for them. Calls may be placed through a public network (such as the Public Switched Telephone Network) provided by a commercial telephone company or a private network called a PBX. In most cases a private network is connected to the public network in order to allow PBX users to dial the outside world. Incoming calls to a private network arrive at the PBX in two ways: either directly to a users phone using a DDI number or indirectly via a receptionist who will answer the call first and then manually put the caller through to the desired user on the PBX. Most telephone calls through the PSTN are set up using ISUP signalling messages or one of its variants between telephone exchanges to establish the end to end connection. Calls through PBX networks are set up using QSIG, DPNSS or variants. Costs Some types of calls are not charged, such as local calls (and internal calls) dialed directly by a telephone subscriber in Canada, the United States, Hong Kong, United Kingdom, Ireland or New Zealand (Residential subscribers only). In most other areas, all telephone calls are charged a fee for the connection. Fees depend on the provider of the service, the type of service being used (a call placed from a landline or wired telephone will have one rate, and a call placed from a mobile telephone will have a different rate) and the distance between the calling and the called parties. In most circumstances, the calling party pays this fee. However, in some circumstances such as a reverse charge or collect call, the called party pays the cost of the call. In some circumstances, the caller pays a flat rate charge for the telephone connection and does not pay any additional charge for all calls made. Telecommunication liberalization has been established in several countries to allows customers to keep their local phone provider and use an alternate provider for a certain call in order to save money. Placing a call An early 21st century mobile phone being used for a phone call A typical phone call using a traditional phone is placed by picking the phone handset up off the base and holding the handset so that the hearing end is next to the user's ear and the speaking end is within range of the mouth. The caller then rotary dials or presses buttons for the phone number needed to complete the call, and the call is routed to the phone which has that number. The second phone makes a ringing noise to alert its owner, while the user of the first phone hears a ringing noise in its earpiece. If the second phone is picked up, then the operators of the two units are able to talk to one another through them. If the phone is not picked up, the operator of the first phone continues to hear a ringing noise until they hang up their own phone. One of the main struggles for Alexander Graham Bell and his team was to prove to non-English speakers that this new phenomenon \\"worked in their language.\\" It was a concept that was hard for people to understand at first. In addition to the traditional method of placing a telephone call, new technologies allow different methods for initiating a telephone call, such as voice dialing. Voice over IP technology allows calls to be made through a PC, using a service like Skype. Other services, such as toll-free dial-around enable callers to initiate a telephone call through a third party without exchanging phone numbers. Originally, no phone calls could be made without first talking to the Switchboard operator. Using 21st century mobile phones does not require the use of an operator to complete a phone call. The use of headsets is becoming more common for placing or receiving a call. Headsets can either come with a cord or be wireless. A special number can be dialed for operator assistance, which may be different for local vs. long-distance or international calls. Tones Preceding, during, and after a traditional telephone call is placed, certain tones signify the progress and status of the telephone call: * a dial tone signifying that the system is ready to accept a telephone number and connect the call * either: ** a ringing tone signifying that the called party has yet to answer the telephone ** a busy signal (or engaged tone) signifying that the called party's telephone is being used in a telephone call to another person (or is \\"off the hook\\" though no number has been dialled, i.e. the customer does not want to be disturbed) ** a fast busy signal (also called reorder tone or overflow busy tone) signifying that there is congestion in the telephone network, or possibly that the calling subscriber has delayed too long in dialling all the necessary digits. The fast busy signal is generally twice as fast as the normal busy signal. * status tones such as STD notification tones (to inform the caller that the telephone call is being trunk dialled at a greater cost to the calling party), minute minder beeps (to inform the caller of the relative duration of the telephone call on calls that are charged on a time basis), and others * a tone (sometimes the busy signal, often the dial tone) to signify that the called party has hung up. * tones used by earlier inband telephone switching systems were simulated by a Red box or a blue box used by \\"phone phreaks\\" to illegally make or receive free trunk/toll calls. * off-hook tone if the phone has been picked up but no number dialed for an extended period of time. Cell phones generally do not use dial tones, because the technology used to transmit the dialed number is different from a landline. Unwanted calls Unsolicited telephone calls are a modern nuisance. Common kinds of unwanted calls include prank calls, telemarketing calls, and obscene phone calls. Caller ID provides some protection against unwanted calls, but can still be turned off by the calling party. Even where end-user Caller ID is not available, calls are still logged, both in billing records at the originating telco and via automatic number identification, so the perpetrator's phone number can still be discovered in many cases. However, this does not provide complete protection: harassers can use payphones, in some cases, automatic number identification itself can be spoofed or blocked, and mobile telephone abusers can (at some cost) use \\"throwaway\\" phones or SIMs. Patents * Rabinow, J., - \\"Telephone call indicator\\"‚ÄîNovember 12, 1957 See also * Call completion * Call processing * Emergency telephone number * Pocket dialing * Telephone phobia * Teletraffic engineering  References  Call Call ","title":"Telephone call"},{"id":"406704","text":"Chinese Box is a 1997 movie directed by Wayne Wang and starring Jeremy Irons, Gong Li, Maggie Cheung and Michael Hui. The movie is set and was made at the time of Hong Kong's handover to the People's Republic of China on June 30, 1997. The film credits Paul Theroux as a source for the story, based on themes he explores in his 1997 novel Kowloon Tong.  Plot  The movie unfolds at least nine different stories on very different levels. First, there is John as a reporter, trying to capture interesting scenes on the streets of Hong Kong, persuading himself his work gives his life a tangible meaning. Second, there is Vivian who is looking to find a balance in life, trying to escape from the underground she once was a part of and forget about her past, but is hindered in her attempts by prejudices that go back thousands of years in the Chinese society (including Hong Kong). Third, there is Vivian (still), with a chance to discard most of her problems by simply marrying John and moving to England with him. Even though she is tempted to do so, she knows this would just be running away from the core of the problem and could not be a long-term solution, mostly because of their different cultural backgrounds and maybe even because of a subtle uncertainty regarding John's ex-wife and former life. Fourth, there is Jean, with her own story and with a typical Hong Kong here- today-who-knows-where-tomorrow attitude - living the moment, enjoying and suffering at the same time, embodying a perfect reflection of modern life, especially so easily seen in Hong Kong in the late 1990s. She understands all of the different kinds of hardships that come in life and, with her face somewhat disfigured, is marked more intensely than most, but also knows where to draw the line in selling herself. John tries to help her, but does that in a dishonest way, which disappoints her tremendously. According to a note in film's credits, Jean's story was inspired by a short story by the American- British author Rachel Ingalls.The A.V. ClubCalendarlive.com Fifth, there are John and Jim. Close, mutually understanding, with enough humor and sarcasm to keep them going through both the good and the bad days. Even though their outlooks towards life differ significantly, their love for the job (journalism) creates a strong bond of true friendship. Sixth, there is Chang, a man of power, of high position, but a wimp in his heart. His immense wealth cannot replace what he lacks in personality. He has no charisma, no morality, no care, and exists purely on his imaginary throne of pretentiousness and status. While he is ashamed of Vivian, he does love her, but in a pathetic, cowardly way. He is very much into 'saving face' and can not find an equilibrium in his life (professional nor personal). He agrees to marry Vivian, but deceives her by arranging merely a mock wedding photo session, so she could have some pictures to send to her family. Vivian burns all of the photos and accepts the notion she will never be happy nor free. Seventh, there are John and Vivian. A story of true love that just isn't meant to be. Not because they wouldn't want it to, but because of the constraints of the societies they live in. Eighth, there is John (again), perplexed with his own mortality, which he is suddenly forced to face. Ninth, there is the political aspect of Hong Kong politically becoming a part of China again, which (at the time) was a great uncertainty.

In most other countries (e.g. most European countries), the elevated interconnect fees are paid fully by the calling party and the called party incurs no charge.

Collects appear in the liturgies of Roman Catholic, Orthodox, Anglican, Methodist, Lutheran, and Presbyterian churches, among others (in those of eastern Christianity the Greek term [d√©esis] synapt√© is often used instead of the Latin term [oratio] collecta, both having the same meaning). Origin of the term The word comes from Latin collƒìcta, the term used in Rome in the 5th centuryC. Frederick Barbee, Paul F.M. Zahl, The Collects of Thomas Cranmer (Eerdmans 1999 ), pp. ix-xi and the 10th,Edward McNamara ZENIT liturgy questions, 28 August 2012 although in the Tridentine version of the Roman Missal the more generic term oratio (prayer) was used instead. The Latin word collƒìcta meant the gathering of the people together (from collig≈ç, \\"to gather\\") and may have been applied to this prayer as said before the procession to the church in which Mass was celebrated. It may also have been used to mean a prayer that collected into one the prayers of the individual members of the congregation. Structure A collect generally has five parts: *Invocation or address: indicating the person of Trinity addressed, usually God the Father, rarely God the Son *Acknowledgement: description of a divine attribute that relates to the petition (often qui ... - who ... ) *Petition: \\"for one thing only and that in the tersest language\\" *Aspiration: **The desired result (begins with the word ut - in order that) **Indication of a further purpose of the petition *Pleading: **Conclusion indicating the mediation of Jesus Christ. **Response by the people: Amen In some contemporary liturgical texts, this structure has been obscured by sentence constructions that depart from the Latin flowing style of a single sentence. Variations =Roman Catholicism= Initially, only one collect was said at Mass, but the Tridentine version of the Roman Missal allowed and often prescribed the use of more than one collect, all but the first being recited under a single conclusion. This custom, which began north of the Alps, had reached Rome by about the 12th century. In the 1973 translation of the Roman Missal by the ICEL, the word collecta was rendered as \\"Opening Prayer\\". This was a misnomer, since the collect ends--rather than opens--the introductory rites of the Mass. This prayer is said immediately before the Epistle. =Anglicanism= The collects in the Book of Common Prayer are mainly translations by Thomas Cranmer (d. 1556) from the Latin prayers for each Sunday of the year. At Morning Prayer, the Collect of the Day is followed by a Collect for Peace and a Collect for Grace. At Evening Prayer the Collect of the Day is followed by a Collect for Peace which differs from the version used at Morning Prayer, and a Collect for Aid against Perils, which starts with the well known phrase; \\"Lighten our darkness, we beseech thee, O Lord; and by thy great mercy defend us from all perils and dangers of this night...\\". At Holy Communion, the Collect of the Day is followed by a reading from the Epistles. In more modern Anglican versions of the Communion service, such as Common Worship used in the Church of England or the 1979 Book of Common Prayer used in the Episcopal Church in the United States, the Collect of the Day follows the Gloria and precedes readings from the Bible. =Lutheranism= Similarly, Lutheran liturgies typically retain traditional collects for each Sunday of the liturgical year. In the newly released Evangelical Lutheran Worship, however, the set of prayers has been expanded to incorporate different Sunday collects for each year of the lectionary cycle, so that the prayers more closely coordinate with the lectionary scripture readings for the day. To achieve this expansion from one year's worth of Sunday collects to three years', modern prayer texts have been added. =French Protestantism= The Huguenots used collects derived from the Psalms and published in the Psalter in 1563. =Scottish Presbyterianism= The \\"Oraisons\\" of the French Psalter were translated by and published in the Scottish Metrical Psalter in 1595. Over time the use of written prayers fell out of favor in the Church of Scotland.

For the calling party, a call to a toll-free number from a landline is free of charge. A toll-free, Freecall, Freephone, 0120, 800, 0800, 888, 866, 877, 855, 844, 833 or 1800 number is identified by a dialing prefix similar to a geographic area code, such as 909 (the area code that covers eastern Los Angeles County and southwestern San Bernardino County). The specific service access numbers vary by country.  History  The features of toll-free services have evolved as telephone networks have moved from electro- mechanical call switching to fully computerized stored program controlled networks. Originally, a call billed to the called party had to be placed through a telephone company operator as a collect call. The operator had to secure acceptance of the charges at the remote number before manually completing the call. A few large businesses and government offices received large numbers of collect calls, which proved time-consuming for operators. =Manual toll-free systems= Prior to the development of automated toll-free service many telephone companies provided a manual version of caller free service. Examples of operator-assisted toll-free calling include the Zenith number introduced in the 1950s in the U.S. and Canada, as well as the original manual 'Freephone' service introduced by the British Post Office in 1960. Both systems were similar in concept. The calling party would ring the operator (now '100' in the UK, '0' in Canada/U.S.) and ask for a specific free number. In the U.S., the caller would ask for a number like \\"Zenith 12345\\" (some areas used \\"Enterprise\\" or \\"WX\\" instead of \\"Zenith\\", but in the same pattern of a free service name and a five-digit number). In the UK, the caller would ask the operator to ring \\"Freephone\\" and a name or number (such as \\"Freephone Crimebusters\\" to pass on tips about a crime to the constabulary).Blackburn Police Station, Westlothian UK, \\"dial 100 and ask for Freephone Crimebusters\\" to report tips about crime In either case, the operator would look up the corresponding geographic number from a list and place the call with charges reversed. A Zenith number was typically available from a predefined area, anything from a few nearby cities to a province or state, and was listed in local directories in each community from which the subscriber was willing to accept the charges for inbound calls. Until the introduction of InWATS toll- free service by the Bell System on May 2, 1967 and the Linkline (later \\"Freefone\\") 0800 services by British Telecom on 12 November 1985, manually ringing the operator was the standard means to place a toll-free call. More than a few established manual \\"Freephone\\" or \\"Zenith\\" numbers remained in use for many years after competing automated systems (0800 in UK, 1800 in U.S.) were deployed in parallel for new toll-free numbers. =Initial direct-dial systems= An automated toll-free service was introduced by AT&T; in 1966 (US intrastate) and 1967 (US interstate) as an alternative to operator-assisted collect calling and manual \\"Zenith\\" or \\"Enterprise\\" numbers. This Inward Wide Area Telephone Service (InWATS) allowed calls to be made directly from anywhere in a predefined area by dialling the prefix 1800- and a seven-digit number. The system initially provided no support for Automatic Number Identification and no itemised record of calls, instead requiring subscribers to obtain expensive fixed-rate lines which included some number of hours of inbound calling from a \\"band\\" of one or several U.S. states or Canadian provinces. Early InWATS 800 calling lacked the complex routing features offered with modern toll-free service. After competitive carriers were allowed to compete with AT&T; in establishing toll-free service, the three digit exchange following the 800 prefix was linked to a specific destination carrier and area code; the number itself corresponded to specific telephone switching offices and trunk groups. All calls went to one central destination; there was no means to place a toll-free call to another country. Despite its limitations (and the relatively high cost of long distance in that era), the system was adequate for the needs of large volume users such as hotel chains, airlines and hire car firms which used it to build a truly national presence. For small regional businesses who received few long-distance calls, the original InWATS was prohibitively expensive. As a fixed-rate bulk service requiring special trunks, it was suited only to large volume users. =Modern direct-dial systems= Modern toll-free service became possible when telephone companies replaced their electro-mechanical switching systems with computerized switching systems. This allowed toll-free calls to be routed based on instructions located in central databases. In the United States, AT&T; engineer Roy P. Weber from Bridgewater, New Jersey patented a 'Data Base Communication Call Processing Method' which was deployed by AT&T; in 1982. The called number was an index into a database, allowing a 'Toll-Free Call' or '800 Call' to be directed anywhere. This feature and other advances that made it possible were what led to AT&T; marketing analyst Dodge Cepeda from Bedminster, New Jersey to propose the introduction of providing 800 Toll-Free Service to small and medium-size business customers on a nationwide basis. Once this service was implemented, it became possible for the very smallest of business operations to have potential customers contact them free of charge at a time when long-distance calling was expensive. Until this time, 800 Service was only available to major Fortune 500 companies. In the United Kingdom, BT introduced \\"Linkline\\" on 12 November 1985. No more need to manually ring the operator, two new prefixes 0800 (an automated toll-free service which became \\"Freefone\\") and 0345 (a shared-cost service marketed as \\"Lo-Call\\" because initially its rates resembled those of local calls) could be reached by direct dial. Cable and Wireless used 0500 and 0645, in much the same way, just a few years later. Vanity numbering A toll-free vanity number, custom toll-free number, or mnemonic is easy to remember; it spells and means something or it contains an easily recognized numeric pattern. An easily remembered number is valued as a branding and direct response tool in business advertising. In the United States, Federal Communications Commission regulations mandate that numbers be allocated on a first come, first served basis; this gives vanity number operators who register as RespOrgs a strong advantage in obtaining the most valuable phonewords, as they have first access to newly disconnected numbers and to newly introduced toll-free area codes. In Australia, premium numbers, such as the 13-series or the vanity phone words, are distributed by auction separately from the administrative procedure to assign random, generic numbers from the available pool. =Shared use= In toll-free telephony, a shared-use number is a vanity number (usually a valuable generic phone word), which is rented to multiple local companies in the same line of business in different cities. These appear in Australia (1300 and 1800) and North America (1800- and its overlays); in the U.S., the RespOrg infrastructure is used to direct calls for the same number to different vendors based on the area code of the calling number. As one example, a taxi company could rent shared use of 1800TAXICAB in one city. The number belongs to a company in Van Nuys, California, but is redirected to local cab companies on a city-by-city basis and promoted by being printed on everything from individual taxi cab hub caps to campaigns against drunk driving. Another example is Mark Russell's 1800GREATRATE, a shared-use number rented to lenders in various cities nationwide for a monthly fee. One former Mercedes dealer obtained 1800MERCEDES, charging other dealers to receive calls to that number from their local areas. The automaker unsuccessfully sued MBZ Communications of Owatonna, Minnesota, operated by former Mercedes dealer Donald Bloom, alleging deception and trademark infringement. Mercedes was ultimately forced to obtain a different number, 1-800-FOR-MERCEDES.The United States Patents Quarterly, Page 1361, Associated Industry Publications, 2003 A company renting 1800REDCROSS at a premium price to individual local Red Cross chapters as \\"shared use\\" was less fortunate; the Federal Communications Commission reassigned that number to the Red Cross as an emergency response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Shared use can be used as a means to circumvent FCC regulations against \\"warehousing, hoarding and brokering\\" toll-free numbers as technically the number is not being sold, only rented one city or region at a time. The practice is nonetheless potentially problematic as it leaves local businesses advertising numbers which they do not own and for which they therefore have no number portability. The cost per minute and per month is typically far higher for a shared-use number than for a standard toll-free vanity number which a local business controls outright, and there is little protection if the shared use company fails to meet its obligations or ceases operation. There are also technical limitations; voice over IP users in particular are difficult to geolocate as their calls may be gated to the public switched telephone network at a point hundreds or thousands of miles away from their actual location. A roaming mobile or Internet telephone user is effectively (like the user of a foreign exchange line) attached to a distant rate centre far from their physical address. If a program like Crime Stoppers is inherently regional or local, but its national 1800222TIPS number is shared between multiple exchanges, the exchange accepting the call must determine whether the call belongs to some other region. Around the world Countries around the world use various dialing prefixes to denote toll-free services in their telephone networks. * In Argentina, the prefix for toll-free numbers is \\"0800\\", followed by seven digits (the first three of them are fixed for each operator, so the user may know which carrier is serving the party they are calling). These numbers are called \\"0800\\" (cero ochocientos) or l√≠neas gratuitas (free lines). There is also a local-rate service named \\"0-810\\" (cero ochocientos diez) where the calling party pays the fee for a local call and the called party pays for the long-distance fees. * In Armenia, the toll-free prefix is \\"800\\" followed by a five-digit number. * In Australia, the toll-free prefix is \\"1800\\" followed by a six-digit number. Calls are free from any landline and generally free from mobiles, although some mobile providers may charge their own fee. A fixed-cost fee (usually the cost of a local call) is payable by the caller to \\"1300\\" and \\"13\\" prefix numbers (followed by six and four digits respectively). * In Austria, the prefix for toll-free numbers is also \\"0800\\", but only followed by six digits. They are commonly referred to as null-achthunderter Nummern (zero-eight hundred numbers). * In Azerbaijan, the prefix for toll -free numbers is 088, followed with seven digits. Toll Free calls are available both from mobile and landline phone operators. * In Belgium, the prefix \\"0800\\" is used for toll-free numbers, followed by 5 digits. They are commonly referred to as groen nummer (green numbers) in Dutch, num√©ros verts (green numbers) in French or \\"null- achthunderter Nummern\\" (zero-eight hundred numbers) in the German speaking area. * In Brazil, the toll-free prefix is \\"0800\\". Although regular landline numbers in Brazil are 8 digits long, the toll-free prefix is usually followed by 7 digits, with 6 digits formerly common. Toll-free numbers in Brazil can be accessed from any telephone (by default) within the country, with many exceptions. They can only be accessed from outside Brazil by using a calling service (such as voice-over-Internet services or MCI Worldcom calling service) that accesses numbers from within the called country. Many toll-free numbers are not available from cell phones (usually blocked by the cell phone provider rather than by the provider of the toll-free number, in an effort to prevent low-price competition from calling card providers). Some toll-free numbers are not available from phones listed by the owner of the number, including many payphones. There is no special name for the service and when such a number is advertised, there is usually a remark that the call is free. * In Bulgaria, the toll-free prefix is \\"0800\\" followed by a five-digit number (up to now, only 1XXXX and 20—Ö—Ö—Ö numbers have been allocated). These numbers are called –ó–µ–ª–µ–Ω –Ω–æ–º–µ—Ä (green number) by BTC and –ó–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∞ –ª–∏–Ω–∏—è (green line) by M-tel. * In Canada, toll-free numbers are drawn from the US SMS/800 database. A seven- digit number 310-xxxx (not a true toll-free, but may be called from anywhere in its home area code at local rates from certain, but not all, carriers) is available in Bell Canada and Telus territories. From a landline, these are free. From cell phones, airtime is not covered, but there are no long-distance charges. * In Chile, the toll-free prefix is \\"800\\" followed by a six-digit number. These numbers are called n√∫mero 800 (800 number). These numbers cannot be accessed from abroad. * In Colombia, toll-free numbers start with \\"018000\\". * In Croatia, the prefix for toll-free numbers is \\"0800\\". * In the Czech Republic, the toll-free prefix is \\"800\\". * In Denmark telephone-numbers have eight digits. The toll-free numbers all begin with \\"80\\" followed by six further digits. * The Dominican Republic is assigned specific 1800 exchanges in the North American Numbering Plan; the 1-809-200-xxxx exchange is also free for domestic callers in that country. * In Egypt, it starts with \\"0800\\" followed by a seven-digit number. Unavailable via cellphones. * In Ecuador, it starts with \\"1800\\" followed by a 6-digit number. Some numbers have either regional or nationwide access. Calls from cellphones are only allowed by the operator Alegro which charges a few cents for these calls. PORTA and Movistar do not allow the service. * In France the \\"0800\\" or \\"0805\\" prefix is used for toll-free numbers. They are also known as num√©ros verts (green numbers). * In Finland, the toll-free prefix is \\"0800\\". * In Germany, the toll-free prefix is \\"'0800\\" followed by a seven-digit number. The \\"0801\\" prefix is already reserved for future use. The prefix used to be \\"0130\\". Deutsche Telekom calls these numbers \\"freecall 0800\\", most Germans refer to it simply as null- achthunderter Nummern (zero-eight hundred numbers). * In Greece, the toll-free prefix is \\"800\\" followed by a seven-digit number or \\"807\\" followed by a four- digit number, used for phone card services only. * In Hong Kong, toll-free numbers have the \\"800\\" prefix. * In Hungary, toll-free numbers have the \\"80\\" prefix. * In Iceland, the toll-free prefix is \\"800\\", followed by a four-digit number. * In India, the toll-free prefix is \\"1800\\", followed by a six or seven digit number. Free if calling from a mobile phone or a land line. The \\"1860\\" prefix followed by seven digits is used for local-rate numbers. The calling party pays the local rate and the called party pays long-distance call charges (if any). * In Indonesia, the toll-free prefix is \\"0800-1\\", followed by a six- digit number. * In Ireland, 1800-\`xxxxxx\` numbers are freephones, with the 1800 71xxxx reserved for services that expect unusually high volumes of calls (e.g. radio station phone-in lines). * In Israel, toll-free numbers are prefixed with \\"1800\\" followed by 6 digits (for local businesses); \\"180\\" or \\"189\\" followed by 7 digits usually refers to a free call to an overseas- operated calling center. The called party pays the charges for the call. As of 2012, calls from local cellular phone service providers to these prefixes are also free. Numbers prefixed with \\"1700\\" followed by 6 digits are local-rate numbers for the first 3‚Äì4 minutes, after which the charges for the remaining duration of the call are transferred to the receiving party (on a \\"shared cost\\" basis). * In Italy, toll-free numbers are dialed with the \\"800\\" or \\"803\\" prefix and are commonly referred to as numero verde (green number) or linea verde (green line). The numeri verdi used to begin with \\"1678\\" and later with \\"167\\". NTT Communications trade mark for free dial, often used in print advertising. * In Japan, the prefixes \\"0120\\" and \\"0800\\" are officially assigned for toll-free numbers and are often referred to as or telephone numbers. These numbers are owned by NTT Communications (NTT Com). Several telephone carriers also provide toll-free services under their own company prefixes such as \\"0077\\" (these prefixes are also used for other toll services; the prefix \\"0570\\" is officially assigned for Navi Dial, a special toll service also operated by NTT Com). * In South Korea, toll-free numbers are prefixed with \\"080\\" (not to be confused with \\"060\\" or \\"070\\", which are used for pay- per-call/pay-per-minute information services or digital home phone services). Not all numbers with the \\"080\\" prefix are toll-free when called from a mobile phone. * In Latvia the prefix 8000-xx-xx is used for toll-free services. They are toll-free only when dialed from landlines, and charged the same as a land line when dialed from cell phones. * In Malaysia the prefix is 1800-xxxxxx. Free if calling from a land-line and VoIP only. Calling from mobile phone will be considered a local call, with varying charges depending on the mobile network providers. * In Mexico the prefix is 800. * In Nepal the prefix is 1660-01-XXXXX. * In New Zealand, both \\"0800\\" or \\"0508\\" prefixes are referred to variously and interchangeably as \\"free phone\\" or \\"toll-free\\". Originally these \\"Oh-eight-hundred\\" numbers were provided by Spark New Zealand and \\"0508\\" by rival company Clear (now Vodafone New Zealand), although now both numbers can be provided by either company. Some older toll bar services designed to restrict toll calls (including long distance or calls to mobile phones) will also block calls to these free phone numbers, although this has become less common since the mid-1990s. A limited number of companies utilizing toll-free numbers will not accept calls from mobile phones. Some other free phone services exist, such as \\"*555\\" (\\"star five five five\\"), which can be dialled from cellular phones to report traffic conditions and incidents of dangerous driving. * In the Netherlands, the prefix \\"0800\\" is used for toll-free numbers. Calling 0800 numbers from fixed and mobile phones is free by law. UIFN's \\"00800\\" are generally free from fixed lines and charged for the airtime from mobile phones. UIFN access is not enforced by law, causing certain phone providers not to honor the standard. * In Norway most telephone-numbers have eight digits (with some exceptions). Toll-free numbers all begin with \\"800\\", followed by five further digits. * In Pakistan, toll-free numbers have the format \\"0800-xxxxx\\". * In Paraguay, the prefix \\"0800\\" is used for toll-free numbers, followed by 6 digits. * In the Philippines, the prefix for toll-free numbers is \\"1800\\" followed by either one, two, or four digits (examples include 8, 10, and 1888), and then by either a four- or seven-digit phone number. However, there are restrictions. Toll-free numbers are limited to the telephone network where the toll-free number is being handled. So, subscribers of a different telephone network company will not be able to call a toll-free number handled by a different telephone network. International toll-free numbers can only be accessed if the calling party is a PLDT subscriber. * In Poland, toll-free numbers have the format \\"800 xxx xxx\\". There are also split- charge numbers in the format \\"801 uxx xxx\\" (caller's cost depends on the digit u) and \\"universal numbers\\" in the format \\"804 uxx xxx\\", where the caller is automatically connected to the nearest office (these numbers are toll-free if u=3). * In Portugal, the prefix is \\"800\\" so the 9-digit number is \\"800 xxx xxx\\". It is referred as chamada gratuita (free call) or as n√∫mero verde (green number). * In Qatar, toll-free numbers have the format \\"800' xxxx\\". * In Romania, toll-free numbers have the format \\"0800 xxx xxx\\". The service is referred to as numƒÉr verde. * In Russia, the prefix is \\"8-800\\", followed by 7 digits (8-800-XXX-XX-XX). * In Serbia, the prefix \\"0-800\\", followed by a 6 or 7 digit number, is used. * In Singapore, the prefix \\"1800\\" followed by a 7 digit number is used. Calling from a mobile phone network will be considered a local call and charges vary among service providers. * In Slovakia, the toll- free prefix is \\"0800\\", followed by six digits. The local rate prefix is \\"0850\\". * In Slovenia, the prefix \\"080\\" is used for toll-free numbers, followed by four more digits. * In South Africa, the prefix \\"0800\\", followed by 6 digits is used. It is referred to as a \\"toll-free\\" or \\"0800\\" number (Afrikaans: tol-vrye). * In Spain, the \\"900XXXXXX\\" or \\"800XXXXXX\\" numbers are always toll-free (800 numbers are not usually used), \\"909XXXXXX\\" is used for dial-up Internet service and toll-free dialup Internet service (under subscription). Also \\"1002\\", \\"1004\\", \\"14XX\\", \\"15XX\\" and \\"16XX\\" are free and are used for the telecommunication providers call centers. * In Sweden, the prefix is \\"020\\" or \\"0200\\" for toll-free numbers. (Additionally, 0800 is reserved for future use.) These numbers are unreachable from other countries. * In Switzerland, the toll-free prefix is \\"0800\\"; it used to be \\"155\\". These numbers are called gr√ºne Nummer (German) / num√©ro vert (French) / numero verde (Italian), all meaning \\"green number\\". * In Taiwan, the toll-free prefix is 0800-xxx-xxx or 0809-xxx-xxx, but not all Taiwanese mobile numbers can call toll free numbers. A toll-free subscriber can decide to restrict a number due to high per-minute mobile rates. This is cumbersome for the caller, who is told to dial another landline number, usually at the highest toll rate within the country as a mobile to landline call. Some small VOIP operators also cannot call toll free numbers. For example, 0701-xxx-xxx cannot call toll free numbers directly, but can call through a live operator by dialling \\"123\\" and have them redirect the call. * In Thailand, for the Call Free, Free Call, Toll-Free, or Free Phone service, the format used is \\"1800-xxxxxx\\". Calls are free for all fixed line calls. Mobile carriers AIS and CAT (60+%o f Thailand's subscribers) offer 1-800 service for cell phones. DTAC and True mobile providers currently do not, but it is expected they will offer the 1-800 service for subscribers by late 2009. * In Turkey, the prefix for toll-free numbers is \\"0800\\". * In the UK, modern freephone numbers start with 0800 or 0808, followed by a further 7 digits. Some older 0800 numbers still in use have a shorter number length. The former 0500 freephone number range was withdrawn on 5 June 2017. * In Ukraine, toll-free numbers have the \\"0800\\" prefix, followed by 2 digits for the carrier code, then 4 digits for the client number - i.e., 0 800 YYXXXX. Before October 2009, the \\"8800\\" prefix was used. The list of actual carrier codes allocated by NCCIR is available here. * In Vietnam, the prefix \\"1800\\" followed by a series of numbers, usually from 4 to 9 digits. All \\"1800\\" numbers are free of charge, but some of them cannot be dialled from all telephones. * In Kosovo, the toll-free prefix is \\"0800\\" followed by 5 digits. =Australia= Toll-Free * Toll-Free numbers in Australia are ten-digit numbers beginning with the prefix \\"1800\\". * 1800 numbers can also be found in Phonewords via an online auction. * For all types, the recipient business pays for incoming toll charges, either per call or at flat rates. * In some cases, 1800 numbers can be accessed from international lines. * Callers to an 1800 number are not charged a connection fee from a domestic fixed line. Calls from a mobile phone may incur charges depending on the provider. * The original prefix was 008. Such numbers were nine digits long. For example, the Crime Stoppers toll-free hotline was 008 333 000, sometimes (misleadingly) written as (008) 33 3000. Such numbers could be dialled from outside Australia, for example +61 08 333 0000 Local Rate numbers A system similar to 1800 numbering exists where 6 or 10 digit numbers prefixed with 13 (one-three), 1300 or 1301 (colloquially one-three- hundred) can be called at local call rates regardless of the caller's location. * Callers to a 13 number are charged a \\"connection fee\\" by their telephone provider. * 13 and 1300 numbers are often \\"smart routed\\" to the local outlet of chain stores or fast food premises. They may also be used by different companies in different regions. * 13 numbers, 1300 numbers and 1800 numbers are relocatable across Australia, and can be transferred between different telecommunications suppliers. * 13 numbers are a premium number scheme, subject to charges from the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) of approximately $10,000 per annum collected by the supplying carrier. * Premium numbers, such as those that spell a word using keypad letters, are regularly auctioned by the ACMA. Mobile phones * Mobile callers are charged to phone a 1300 number or 1800 number, usually at their normal per minute rate, but sometimes at predatory rates. These expensive numbers can be decoded to ordinary landline and organisations usually offer a landline number on their websites, though it may be hard to find. * Smart routed 1800 or 13(00) numbers are sometimes not available from mobile phones as owners of the numbers may bar incoming calls from mobile devices due to higher call charges associated with such calls. =Canada= In addition to NANP toll-free numbers, carriers Bell Canada and Telus offer 310- numbers that can be accessed at local-call prices as shared-cost service (free from landlines, incurs local airtime charge from mobiles and local price from payphones). There are a few special mobile-only numbers (like *CAA to call the Canadian Automobile Association) which are free from cell phones, these are actually vertical service codes. =China= * Calling an 800 number is free of charge. Calling a 400 number incurs a local access charge. * 800 numbers are accessible only to land-line subscribers, while 400 numbers are accessible to all land-line and mobile users. 800-toll-free numbers * 800 toll- free numbers are commonly called \\"800 ÂÖçË¥πÁîµËØù\\". The official name is \\"Ë¢´Âè´ÈõÜ‰∏≠‰ªòË¥π‰∏öÂä°\\" (called party collect paid service), which means the cost of the call is borne not by the caller but by the party receiving the call. * 800-toll-free numbers in China are ten-digit numbers beginning with \\"800\\". There is no prefix before \\"800\\". * 800-toll-free numbers are not accessible to mobile network subscribers and some land-line subscribers. For instance China Tietong Telecom land-line users cannot access 800 numbers. 400-toll-free numbers * 400-service is called \\"‰∏ªË¢´Âè´ÂàÜÊëä‰ªòË¥π‰∏öÂä°\\" (calling party and called party split-paid service), which means the calling party pays for the local access fee and the called party pays the toll (long distance) fee. * 400-toll-free numbers in China are ten-digit numbers beginning with \\"400\\". * 400-toll-free numbers can be accessed by all fixed-line and mobile phones. * Callers have to bear local access charges from their service providers. * 400-toll-free numbers with prefix \\"4001\\" are international toll-free numbers which can be routed to destination numbers inside or outside China. 400 toll-free numbers with prefix \\"4000\\", \\"4006\\", \\"4007\\" or \\"4008\\" are national toll-free numbers which can be routed to China destination numbers only. =Netherlands= The introduction of 0800/0900 numbers in the Netherlands in 1986 has led to significant growth of call centres and an increase in outsourcing.Some Sectoral and Locational Factors in the Development of Call Centres in the U.S. and the Netherlands, Peter Bain, University of Strathclyde, 2001 Originally, free telephone numbers in the Netherlands started with either the 06-0, 06-4 or 06-3000 prefix. Most 0800-numbers cannot be called from abroad, and only few can be called from the Caribbean Netherlands (by dialing 0031800). 088-numbers are shared-cost; from landlines, the caller pays only the costs for a local call, whereas the receiver pays the rest. =United Kingdom= In the United Kingdom, toll-free telephone numbers are generally known as \\"freephone\\" numbers (British Telecom numbers are officially Freefone) and begin with the prefixes 0800 or 0808. The most commonly used prefix is 0800, first used in November 1985. Additionally, numbers in the range \`0808 80x xxxx\` are reserved for not-for-profit helplines, through a scheme negotiated by the Helplines Partnership (now known as the Helplines Association). Since 1 July 2015, all 0800 and 0808 numbers have been free to call from landlines and mobile phones alike. Most mobile phone operators had charged for such calls previously, with Orange being the final major network to introduce such charges during December 2005. Certain helplines, such as those in the 0808 80x xxxx series had remained free from most networks on a voluntary basis and some niche operators, such as Giffgaff always offered freephone calls at no charge. The UK mobile operators offer an alternative product to organisations who wish to provide toll-free services - 5-digit voice short codes which are sold through mobile aggregators. 0500 numbers, introduced by Mercury Communications (later known as Cable & Wireless, now Vodafone) in 1982, were also freephone numbers (known as \\"FreeCall\\"), but were officially withdrawn by Ofcom on 3 June 2017. A three- year transition period prior to that had allowed existing subscribers to migrate to matching 080 85 numbers with the same final 6 digits as before. While the numbers had been portable, the 0500 range had been closed to new allocations since 1997/98. 0500 numbers had six more digits after the prefix. 0800 numbers can have six or seven digits after the prefix. 0808 numbers have seven digits after the prefix. =United States= Toll-free numbers in the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) are commonly called \\"800 numbers\\" after the original area code which was used to dial them. They include the area code 800 (since January 1, 1966), 888 (since March 1, 1996), 877 (since April 4, 1998), 866 (since July 29, 2000), 855 (since October 9, 2010), 844 (since December 7, 2013), and 833 (since June 3, 2017). Area codes reserved for future expansion include 822, 880 through 887, and 889. The original Wide Area Telephone Service is obsolete. North American toll-free numbers are controlled by an intelligent network database (SMS/800) in which any toll-free number may be directed to a local or long-distance geographic telephone number, a T-carrier or primary rate interface line under the control of any of various RespOrgs. Direct inward dialing and toll-free number portability are supported; various providers offer gateways which receive free phone calls on PRI lines and deliver them to voice over IP or pager users. Toll free numbers usually capture the telephone number of the caller for billing purposes through automatic number identification, which is independent of caller ID data and functions even if caller ID is blocked. Universal International Freephone Service Universal International Freephone Service is an international service, assigned the country code 800 by the International Telecommunication Union. The intention is that any customer in the world can dial the same number to reach a business subscribing to a number, and at no charge to the calling party. However, only a limited number of countries participate. In order to participate, countries must agree on the amount of revenue they will retain (to cover their costs of network transport) while still forwarding sufficient revenue to cover the recipient's costs of subscribing. A Universal International Freephone Number (UIFN) is a worldwide toll-free \\"800 number\\" issued by the ITU. Like the 800 area code issued for the NANP in the U.S. and Canada and 0800 numbers in many other countries, the call is free for the caller while the receiver pays the charges. UIFN uses ITU country code 800 so that no matter where the caller is, only the international access code (IAC), the UIFN country code (800) and the 8-digit UIFN need to be dialed. As of March 2020, 144 carriers in 67 countries participate in the UIFN program; free access to the numbers (as international calls) from mobile and coin telephones is not universal. Registration of a +800 number incurs a 300 Swiss franc ITU fee (as of 2018) in addition to any charges levied by the individual carrier. The number must be activated for inbound calls from at least two telephone country codes within 180 days. The +800 UIFN service is one of three ITU-administered non-geographic codes with a similar numbering scheme. The +808 Universal International Shared Cost Number (UISCN), billed at the price of a domestic call, shares the same eight-digit format; the +979 Universal International Premium Rate Number (UIPRN), billed at a high premium cost, carries one extra digit to indicate price range.

Fake origins For unknown reasons (some say because of her supposed espionage and others so she could give herself a more exotic allure), Guinness frequently lied about her origins, claiming she was from Veracruz (when she was actually from Guadalajara), that her father was a revolutionary killed in action (when he was a journalist who died of health complications in a clinic in San Antonio, Texas) and saying that her mother was either a laundry maid or a seamstress (when she was well stablished member of the local elite). In any case, while everyone in her social circle tried to \\"play it up\\", Gloria had more fun \\"playing it down\\", and as such, transmitted a light and unpretentious attitude that made people easily attracted to her and still be considered \\"the most elegant woman in the world\\", according to Eleanor Lambert.  True origins  It is only from documentary evidence that it has been possible to establish that Gloria Rubio y Alatorre was born in Guadalajara,Guadalajara given as place of birth on a March 21, 1932 border crossing document; accessed on ancestry.com on March 21, 2016.

Mar√≠a Luisa's brothers in law included don Gaspar Rubio de Tejada y Benavente, a nephew of Ram√≥n de Errazu y Rubio de Tejada, and don Jes√∫s Col√≥n de Larre√°tegui y Vallarta, a descendant of Christopher Columbus, through his eldest son, the 1st Duke of Veragua. She had two elder siblings: Rafael and Maria Luisa.Names of siblings found on 1915 passenger list; accessed on ancestry.com on March 21, 2016. Gloria's childhood was mainly spent hopping around the haciendas of her mother's wealthy relatives, such as the Villase√±or-Jasso and S√°nchez de Aldana families, with whom they grew up, until the Mexican Revolution entered Jalisco and their lands were lost. Career Guinness wrote frequently for Harper's Bazaar. She famously asserted, in the magazine's July 1963 issue, that \\"Elegance is in the brain as well as the body and in the soul. Jesus Christ is the only example we have of any one human having possessed all three at the same time.\\" =Fashion= Voted \\"Best Dressed Woman In the World\\" by Time Magazine in 1962, second only to Jackie Kennedyhttps://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O138936/evening-dress- goma-michel/. Guinness was dressed by various top-couture designers like Crist√≥bal Balenciaga, Elsa Schiaparelli, Marc Bohan at Christian Dior, Chanel, Hubert de Givenchy, Yves Saint Laurent, Valentino Garavani, Halston and shoes by Roger Vivier. She was one of the models to wear capri pants by Emilio Pucci. She was photographed for Vogue, Harper's Bazaar and Woman's Wear Daily by Cecil Beaton, Richard Avedon, John Rawlings, Toni Frissell, Horst P. Horst, Slim Aarons and Henry Clarke. She was painted by artista like Ren√© Bouch√©, Kenneth Paul Block and Alejo Vidal-Quadras. She appeared on the International Best Dressed List from 1959 through 1963. The year after she was elevated into its Hall of Fame. =Rumour of espionage= There is a long-standing rumor that Gloria Guinness was employed as a spy at some point and that when she married her fourth husband, she had no valid passport and was legally stateless. This rumor is substantiated to a certain degree by her appearance in a series of supposedly nonfiction books written by Aline Griffith, Countess of Romanones. Griffith knew Guinness during World War Two and was a friend, fellow spy (originally on the opposite side, the Countess was still an American citizen during the war, and an employee of the OSS), and sometime adversary of Guinness. Guinness was an almost legendary character by this point, the glamorous \\"Countess von F√ºrstenberg\\" who maintained friendships with important Nazis, including Hermann G√∂ring and even Adolf Hitler himself, and lived in neutral Madrid throughout the latter days of the Second World War as an espionage agent for the Axis.

Her second marriage was to Franz-Egon Maria Meinhard Engelbert Pius Aloysius Kaspar Ferdinand Dietrich, third Graf von F√ºrstenberg- Herdringen (1896‚Äì1975), whom she married on October 4, 1935, in Kensington, London, England;The marriage license, accessed on ancestry.com on December 2, 2013, gives the bride's name as Gloria R. de Scholtens she was his second wife and had a stepdaughter from her husband's first marriage, the actress Betsy von Furstenberg. By him, she had two children: * Dolores Maria Agatha Wilhelmine Luise, Freiin von F√ºrstenberg-Hedringen (July 31, 1936 ‚Äì January 20, 2012). She married her stepbrother, Patrick Benjamin Guinness, on 22 October 1955; he was killed in an automobile accident in 1965 in Switzerland. * Franz-Egon Engelbert Raphael Christophorus Hubertus, Freiherr von F√ºrstenberg-Hedringen (born July 27, 1939 in Berlin-Wilmersdorf).The title of Count von F√ºrstenberg-Hedringen was inherited by Franz-Egon's younger brother Wenemar (1897‚Äì1972) and his descendants, rather than by his own son by Gloria. Due to Franz-Egon's marriage to a divorc√©e, he was forced from the succession, according to laws of the house of F√ºrstenberg-Hedringen, as reported in the memoirs of Etti Plesch as well as the Almanac de Gotha. F√ºrstenberg-Herdringen Line: A Prussian graviate; the title was Graf von F√ºrstenberg-Herdringen, and an estate in tail, Besitz Herdringen, was given on January 16, 1843 to Franz Egon Freiherr von F√ºrstenberg of Herdringen (1818-1902) by King Frederick William IV of Prussia, Member of the Prussian House of Lords and Seneschal in the Duchy of Westphalia. He married Agneta Sundby (born April 12, 1943), a Swedish model on August 20, 1967, in Visnum church, Visnum, Sweden.Visnums kyrkoarkiv A II a: 22, E I:9 nr 4/1967. After their divorce, he married Adelina von F√ºrstenberg n√©e Cuberyan. Her third marriage was to Ahmad-Abu-El- Fotouh Fakhry Bey (1921‚Äì1998), whom she married in 1946 and divorced in 1949. The only child of Princess Fawkia of Egypt, Countess Wladimir d‚ÄôAdix- Dellmensingen, and her first husband, Mahmud Fakhry Pasha, he was a grandson of King Fuad I of Egypt and a nephew of Princess Fawzia of Egypt (the first wife of Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, Shah of Iran) and of King Farouk I of Egypt. Her fourth, and final, marriage was to Group Captain Thomas Loel Guinness (1906‚Äì1988), a Member of Parliament and a member of the extended Guinness beer family, though his particular branch made its fortune in banking and real estate. They married on April 7, 1951, in Antibes. By this marriage she had three stepchildren: Patrick Benjamin Guinness (1931‚Äì1965); William Loel Seymour Guinness (born 1939), and Belinda Guinness (born 1941), wife of 5th and last Marquess of Dufferin and Ava.

It runs from I-405 and SR 22 in Seal Beach to I-210 in Duarte. The San Gabriel River Freeway closely parallels the San Gabriel River for most of its alignment, hence its name, which is one of the few Southern California freeways not named after a city along its route. Though this does not include the improvements with the interchange with I-105 (which did not open until the mid 1990s), reconstruction of I-10 between I-605 and I-405, and the addition of an HOV lane between I-405 and I-10, I-605 is one of the only remaining freeways that kept its original alignment throughout its run through Los Angeles County since it first opened. Route description The California Streets and Highways Code defines Route 605 as \\"(a) Route 1 near Seal Beach to Route 405. (b) Route 405 to Route 210 near Duarte.\\" However, the portion in subsection A has yet to be constructed. The southern terminus of I-605 is at the San Diego (I-405) and Garden Grove (State Route 22) Freeways in Seal Beach. From there, it runs roughly north through the Gateway Cities of the Los Angeles Basin. It then shifts north-northeast, crossing the Whittier Narrows and across the San Gabriel Valley. I-605 then ends at its junction with the Foothill Freeway, (I-210) in Duarte, a small city located at the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains. I-605 follows most of the length of the San Gabriel River from the San Diego Freeway in Seal Beach to the Santa Fe Dam. Typically dry riverbed and flood basins are visible from many portions of the route, especially near the northern terminus. In the mid 2000s, a HOV lane was added for motorists with two or more people to use between I-405 and I-10. The HOV lane ends at Interstate 10. There are no plans to extend it to Interstate 210 at this time. With the addition of the HOV lane, the left shoulder was eliminated to avoid massive costs to widen the freeway. The highway also suffers from traffic jams regularly, especially the junction with I-5 (the Santa Ana Freeway). Newer signs with exit numbers replaced the older signs between the Orange County line and Interstate 10 in 2016, with the completion of the I-605 and I-10 junction improvement. Guide signs along I-605 never included destinations (control cities) such as \\"Seal Beach\\" or \\"Irwindale\\" since its opening. Rather, cardinal directions (\\"NORTH\\" or \\"SOUTH\\"), and a simple \\"THRU TRAFFIC\\" designation in place of control cities, are used on signs along I-605 itself. I-605 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. I-605 from I-405 to I-10 is known as the San Gabriel River Freeway, as named by Senate Bill 99, Chapter 1101 in 1967. History Approaching the northern terminus of I-605 In 1957, the number for this route was proposed as I-13, as it is positioned approximately midway between I-5 and I-15 (although it intersects the former). That number was rejected, as was the second proposed number, I-102. Finally, the designation I-605 was accepted in 1958. Interstate 605 began construction in 1963 and the first section was opened in 1964 from I-405 to SR 60\\\\. The newest section (extension to I-210) was opened in 1971 was originally signed as SR 243\\\\. There are plans to extend it to SR 1 further south in Orange County as SR 605, but strong community opposition means that it is unlikely that the alignment will ever be built.

After a name change in that same year and brief hosting time at University of California, Berkeley (Jul-1999 to Jan-2001), the project now resides at SourceForge[CF-Devel] SourceForge File Release Notice: client-linux-rpm where development continues. started with just one indoor map and then increased to 4 indoor maps with one-way portals from level 1 to level 4. Upon clearing the last level, there was nothing more for the player to do. Spells were limited to magic bullet (the first spell), fireball, magic missile, burning hands and lightning bolt. Later, when two-way portals were implemented, development and content contribution expanded greatly. has since grown to encompass over 150 monsters, about 3000 maps to explore, an elaborate magic system, 13 races, 15 character classes, a system of skills, and many artifacts and treasures. As of July 2018 the game is under active development by the community.  Gameplay  Any number of players can connect and play on the public servers, finding and using items and battling monsters. They can cooperate or compete in the same world which includes both static and randomly generated content. It is a client and server based game with the ability to be played over the Internet, on a local network setting, or on a single computer setup. is based in a medieval fantasy world. Players can choose any of 13 races from dragons (fire hatchlings) to quetzalcoatl as well as the more average human and elf. They can also play as one of 15 classes or professions which range from alchemist to a monk to a warrior. The game has a comprehensive skill system that attributes experience points to each skill, instead of the character earning general experience points. Once the character creation process is complete, players enter the game world and pick from the two starting towns, Scorn or Navar. Although there are many quests, the game leans towards hack and slash adventuring with other players. The game world is quite large, making exploration a key gameplay mechanic.

The brown creeper (Certhia americana), also known as the American treecreeper, is a small songbird, the only North American member of the treecreeper family Certhiidae. Description Adults are brown on the upper parts with light spotting, resembling a piece of tree bark, with white underparts. They have a long thin bill with a slight downward curve and a long stiff tail used for support as the bird creeps upwards. The male creeper has a slightly larger bill than the female. Relatively, brown creepers are smaller than white- breasted nuthatches but larger than golden-crowned kinglets. Measurements: * Length: 4.7-5.5 in (12-14 cm) * Weight: 0.2-0.3 oz (5-10 g) * Wingspan: 6.7-7.9 in (17-20 cm) Its voice includes single very high pitched, short, often insistent, piercing calls; see, or swee. The song often has a cadence like; pee pee willow wee or see tidle swee, with notes similar to the calls. Distribution, habitat and range Their breeding habitat is mature forests, especially conifers, in Canada, Alaska and the northeastern and western United States. They are permanent residents through much of their range; many northern birds migrate farther south to the United States. Brown creeper has occurred as a vagrant to Bermuda and Central America's mountains in Guatemala, Honduras and the northern cordillera of El Salvador. As a migratory species with a northern range, this species is a conceivable vagrant to western Europe. However, it is intermediate in its characteristics between common treecreeper and short-toed treecreeper, and has sometimes in the past been considered a subspecies of the former, although its closest relative seems to be the latter (Tietze et al., 2006). Since the two European treecreepers are themselves among the most difficult species on that continent to distinguish from each other, a brown creeper would probably not even be suspected, other than on a treeless western island, and would be difficult to verify even then. Brown Creepers prefer mature, moist, coniferous forests or mixed coniferous/deciduous forests. They are found in drier forests as well, including Engelman Spruce and larch forest in eastern Washington. They generally avoid the rainforest of the outer coast. While they generally nest in hardwoods, conifers are preferred for foraging.

The species has declined in much of North America but appears to be doing well in Washington, with a small (not significant) increase on the state's breeding bird survey since 1966. In Wyoming, C. americana has been recognized as preferring habitat within large, intact and mature stands of spruces, firs, or lodgepole pine. It is therefore potentially vulnerable to logging, climate change, or replacement of those tree species by Ponderosa pine.Faulkner, Douglas W. (2010). Birds of Wyoming, p. 188. Greenwood Village, CO: Roberts and Company Publishers. However, it is not considered a species of serious concern in that state.Wyoming Game and Fish Department (2017). State Wildlife Action Plan: Species of Greatest Conservation Need. https://wgfd.wyo.gov/WGFD/media/content/PDF/Habitat/SWAP/Wyoming-SGCN.pdf Behavior They forage on tree trunks and branches, typically spiraling upwards from the bottom of a tree trunk, and then flying down to the bottom of another tree. They creep slowly with their body flattened against the bark, probing with their beak for insects. They will rarely feed on the ground. They mainly eat small arthropods found in the bark, but sometimes they will eat seeds in winter. Breeding Breeding season typically begins in April. The female will make a partial cup nest either under a piece of bark partially detached from the tree, or in a tree cavity. It will lay 3‚Äì7 eggs, and incubation lasts approximately two weeks. Both of the parents help feed the chicks.

It is a bypass auxiliary route of I-5, running roughly through the center of the Greater San Diego region from San Ysidro (part of the city of San Diego) near the Mexico‚ÄìU.S. border to near Del Mar. The southern terminus of I-805 at I-5 in San Ysidro is less than a mile north of the Mexican border. I-805 then traverses the cities of Chula Vista and National City before reentering San Diego. The freeway passes through the San Diego neighborhoods of North Park, Mission Valley, Clairemont, and University City before terminating at I-5 in the Sorrento Valley neighborhood near the Del Mar city limit. Planning for I-805 began in 1956, and the route was officially designated in 1959 before it was renumbered in the 1964 state highway renumbering. Starting in 1967, the freeway was built in phases, with the northern part of the freeway finished before the southern part. I-805 was completed and open to traffic in 1975. Named the Jacob Dekema Freeway after the longtime head of the regional division of the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), I-805 has been frequently cited for its complex engineering and architecture, including near I-8 on the Mission Valley Viaduct. Since then, several construction projects have taken place, including the construction of local and express lanes at the northern interchange with I-5. High-occupancy toll lanes are under construction on both the northern and southern portions of the route. Route description I-805 northbound at SR 905 The route begins at I-5 near the Mexican border in a far south part of San Ysidro, a neighborhood of San Diego. As it starts its journey northward, it quickly has a junction with State Route 905 (SR 905) before exiting the city of San Diego and entering Chula Vista. Within the past 20 years the freeway has delineated the apparent divide between rich and poor in the city of Chula Vista; those on the eastern side of the freeway have been more affluent and have better schools compared to those on the western side. Just outside the city, I-805 meets County Route S17 (CR S17), also named Bonita Road, before coming to an interchange with SR 54\\\\. The freeway then enters National City, where it intersects Sweetwater Road and Plaza Boulevard, before leaving the city and reentering the city of San Diego. I-805 continues northward through San Diego, where it intersects SR 94, the Martin Luther King Jr. Freeway. As the freeway continues through downtown San Diego, it meets SR 15, the continuation of I-15. It then intersects El Cajon Boulevard before passing under the Hazard Memorial Bridge that carries Adams Avenue. The bridge was named after Roscoe Hazard for his involvement in the construction of several roads and highways in Southern California. I-805 then travels on the Mission Valley Viaduct, a towering reinforced concrete viaduct built in 1972, spanning over Mission Valley and the San Diego River. The viaduct is the top stack of the Jack Schrade Interchange over I-8, which runs along the south side of Mission Valley and crosses underneath the viaduct perpendicularly, and is San Diego County's only symmetrical stack interchange. The San Diego Trolley traffic also runs under the viaduct on the valley floor. The beginning of I-805 south at I-5 during the evening rush hour After intersecting SR 163, also known as the Cabrillo Freeway, I-805 continues through suburban San Diego, where it meets SR 52 in Clairemont Mesa. North of SR 52, it closely parallels I-5 near La Jolla, heading northwest. Passing under the Eastgate Mall arch bridge and entering Sorrento Valley, it finally meets its north end at I-5. During the widening project which was completed in 2007, I-5 at the I-805 merge was built to be 21 lanes wide. Eastbound SR 56 and Carmel Mountain Road are accessible via a parallel carriageway for local traffic heading northbound from I-805; traffic from SR 56 westbound can merge onto I-805 from the local bypass. The route is officially known as the Jacob Dekema Freeway after Jacob Dekema, a pioneering force from the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) who helped shape the San Diego freeway system. It is also part of the California Freeway and Expressway System and the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. In 2013, I-805 had an annual average daily traffic (AADT) of 41,500 at the southern terminus, and 262,000 between Bonita Road and SR 54, the latter of which was the highest AADT for the highway. History =Construction= According to Dekema, planning for I-805 began in 1956. The original routing for I-805 was approved as an Interstate Highway in July 1958. It was added to the state highway system and the Freeway and Expressway System in 1959 as Route 241. I-805 was expected to reduce traffic on what was then US 101 between Los Angeles and San Diego, when the former was opened. Route 241 was renumbered to Route 805 in the 1964 state highway renumbering, and I-5 was designated along the route from Los Angeles to San Diego. Further planning was underway in 1965, with the goal to have the route built by 1972, the federal highway funding deadline. This was to be the first freeway in the area with no prior road along its route that it would replace; the goal was to provide a bypass around San Diego for those traveling to Mexico, and improve access for local residents. By June, houses along the route in the North Park area were being sold, as the land was needed for the first stretch of the freeway to be constructed. The next year, Dekema confirmed that the first portion of what was known as the Inland Freeway to be built would be between Home and Adams avenues. In May 1967, bidding began, after construction had been delayed by that of the I-5 and I-8 freeways, both of which had been given higher priority. This first portion would run from Wabash Boulevard to around Madison Avenue (a distance of ), and the next portion would include the I-8 interchange. The R.E. Hazard and W.F. Maxwell Companies won the low bid of $11.7 million (equivalent to $ in ) in mid-1967. The groundbreaking ceremony happened on September 25 at El Cajon Boulevard and Boundary Street. In August 1968, the portion of I-805 from just south of I-8 to north of Friars Road, including the interchange with I-8, was put up for bidding; at a budgeted $27.5 million (equivalent to $ in ), it was the most expensive job that the Division of Highways had ever put up for bid. The winning bid was $20.9 million (equivalent to $ in ), and was awarded to R.E. Hazard Contracting Company and W.F. Maxwell Company. Aerial view of I-805 near the SR 15 interchange Construction had begun on the viaduct by May 1969; in the meantime, National City was making plans for developing the freeway corridor with motels and restaurants, as well as a shopping center. In mid-1969, bidding was to begin on of I-805 from north of Friars Road to north of what was then US 395, which would become SR 163. Construction from J Street south to near San Ysidro was underway by September, when there were concerns that an order from President Richard Nixon to reduce federal construction projects by 75 percent might affect funding for the portion north of Friars Road. However, Governor Ronald Reagan lifted the associated freeze in construction at the state level a few weeks later. A month later, the contract for the portion between Friars Road and US 395 had been awarded for $15 million (equivalent to $ in ); the portions between there and north of Miramar Road were in the planning phases, while construction continued south of I-8 to Wabash Boulevard. The portion from SR 52 to Miramar Road had been contracted out to O.G. Sansome Company for $5.6 million (equivalent to $ in ) by the end of 1969. Meanwhile, $4 million (equivalent to $ in ) of state funding was spent in 1969 to find housing for those who were to be displaced by the freeway in San Ysidro. By March 1970, the original section between Home Avenue and near I-8 was almost finished. The Mission Valley portion extending north of US 395, as well as from Otay Valley Road and J Street in Chula Vista, were still under construction. The portion immediately north of US 395 was contracted to A.A. Baxter Corporation, E.C. Young, and Young and Sons, Inc. for $7.9 million (equivalent to $ in ). On July 6, the first section to begin construction was dedicated, and was to be opened from El Cajon Boulevard to Wabash Boulevard soon thereafter; the rest of the section would not open until the Mission Valley interchange with I-8 was finished. A second border crossing in the San Ysidro area was proposed near the Playas de Tijuana area, that would be accessible from I-805, although another alternative was considered near Brown Field. A formal study on the matter was commissioned in August. However, this would have added $10 million (equivalent to $ in ) to the cost of the freeway, and possibly delay it by up to 10 years; furthermore, most traffic crossing the border was found to head to Tijuana and not Ensenada. Following this, the city of Chula Vista asked that the state proceed with the original plans to construct the freeway, even though it would pass through a San Ysidro neighborhood. In September 1970, bidding began for the final portion of the northern half of I-805 between Miramar Road and I-5; a month later, the segments between Home Avenue and SR 94, and SR 54 to 12th Street had funding allocated. By the end of the year, Hazard, Maxwell, and Matich had submitted the low bid of around $7.2 million (equivalent to $ in ) for the northernmost portion. The Chula Vista portion of the freeway from Main Street to L Street was completed in February 1971; by then, the estimated date for completing the entire freeway had slipped to 1975 from 1972. By March, the projected completion date for the Mission Valley bridge was revised to July 1972. A 102-home mobile home park was approved by the City Council a few weeks later to house those who were displaced by the freeway construction. The portion of the freeway from Otay Valley Road to Telegraph Canyon Road opened during 1972. On October 22, several unconstructed portions of I-805 were partially funded, including from Chula Vista south past SR 75, north of the completed Chula Vista portion to SR 54, from SR 54 to Plaza Boulevard in National City, from there to SR 94 (including the interchange with SR 252), and from there to Home Avenue. Before the end of the year, the portion from SR 94 to Home Avenue entered the bidding phase; Guy F. Atkinson Company won the contract for roughly $9.96 million (equivalent to $ in ) in early 1972. Following a request from the El Cajon City Council, March 19 was set aside as a Community Cycle Day for bicyclists to travel the newly finished freeway from El Cajon Boulevard to SR 52, just before the freeway was to be dedicated the next day; the entire Mission Valley Viaduct was open to traffic that month. By the beginning of 1974, I-805 was open north of Home Avenue, and from Otay Valley Road to Telegraph Canyon Road in Chula Vista; five segments remaining were under construction, and the last segment was funded. The Imperial Avenue section of I-805 remained in the budget, despite revisions in response to the 1973 oil crisis. In late January, I-805 between SR 15 and SR 94 was opened to traffic, though not all of the ramps at the SR 94 interchange were operational. The connectors to SR 94 east were completed in March. The entire portion between SR 94 and Home Avenue cost $10.5 million (equivalent to $ in ). Construction between SR 94 and Imperial Avenue was well under way by December, at a cost of $8.5 million (equivalent to $ in ). As the scheduled completion of the freeway neared, Mayor Tom Hamilton of Chula Vista expressed concerns regarding the predicted development of the I-805 corridor, and the decisions that the City Council would need to make regarding such plans. The portion south of Otay Valley Road cost $15 million (equivalent to $ in ), and the portion between Telegraph Canyon Road and Sweetwater Road cost $12 million (equivalent to $ in ). The portion from there to Imperial Avenue was projected to cost $10.2 million (equivalent to $ in ). The dedication of the freeway took place on July 23, 1975, even though the freeway was not entirely finished, due to the desire to hold the ceremony during the summer. I-805 from Plaza Boulevard to Telegraph Canyon Road opened to traffic on July 28, leaving the freeway complete except for the portion between Plaza Boulevard and SR 94\\\\. While portions of the freeway were nearly ready for traffic, there were reports of motorists driving on the closed freeway, which the California Highway Patrol warned was illegal. On September 3, Dekema announced that the entirety of the freeway would open the next day as he made a final inspection of the unopened portion; the total cost of the construction was $145 million (equivalent to $ in ). However, Dekema announced that there was no more state funding available to construct further roads for the short-term. =Recognition, artwork, and architecture= The La Jolla Village Drive overpass on I-805 northbound, with the Eastgate Mall bridge in the background The Mission Valley Viaduct was recognized by the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) as the \\"Outstanding Civil Engineering Project for 1973 in the San Diego Area\\"; it was designed to match the close by Mission San Diego de Alcal√° with its columns that look similar to cathedral windows, and arch-like shapes etched into the textured concrete. The viaduct was designed to span , and use squared-off support columns instead of traditional cylindrical supports. Octagonal columns were to be used on the ramps and the ends of the bridge. Over 600 tons of steel bars were to be used, and the bridge was constructed as high as above I-8. The Adams Avenue Bridge over I-805 was also recognized for its span and two tapered supports on the ends of the bridge; in 1968, a Princeton University engineering professor asked for a copy of the design from Caltrans for educational purposes. The construction supervisor, in fact, compared the construction of this bridge to building a boat, and it was constructed from the middle outward rather than the conventional method of building from the ends inward. The span was designed to be long, and high. Awards for the Eastgate Mall (or Old Miramar Bridge) came from the Federal Highway Administration, San Diego Highway Development Association, and Prestressed Concrete Institute Awards Program; at the time, it was one of the first arch bridges in the state, and did not use traditional concrete pillars. The San Diego Union (predecessor to the Union-Tribune) published a few freelance articles in 1984 about I-805, complimenting the four-level interchange with I-8 and the arch bridge at Eastgate Mall, while mentioning that subsequent inflation after their completion would have made such structures more difficult to build if they had been constructed later. Other artwork and architecture that was mentioned included the Wateridge development in Sorrento Valley, and the \\"Stargazer\\" building by Alexander Liberman that was lit with fluorescent colors at night. However, not all forms of artwork along the highway were uncontroversial. In 1977, there were several complaints regarding new billboards that were installed at the northern terminus of the highway, since they blocked the view of the coast. In 1981, an illegal mural that was determined to be incomplete was discovered at the I-8 interchange; while Caltrans discouraged the painting of such murals, they were impressed with the portion that had already been completed. Art Cole, the artist, stepped forward to the department, and was allowed to finish the mural of a desert highland sunrise; following this, Caltrans made efforts to have other murals commissioned. The San Ysidro Chamber of Commerce attempted to have I-805 named as the San Ysidro Freeway in 1976. However, I-805 was named after Jacob Dekema in August 1981, and ceremonies to mark the occasion occurred in February 1982. The plaque honoring Dekema was installed in November at the Governor Drive interchange. Because of his efforts in designing I-805, Ed Settle of Caltrans was given the Outstanding Civil Engineering Award from the ASCE; he designed several other regional freeways, including SR 163 through Balboa Park and I-5 through San Diego. =Expansion= \\"Dual freeway\\" at northern I-805 terminus The construction of a \\"dual freeway\\" at the northern end of I-805 was discussed as early as 1989, referring to the two carriageways needed for each direction of the freeway, resulting in four total. It would require drivers to use the new local lanes to access eastbound SR 56 from I-5 or I-805. The project would allow for trucks to use the new lanes to assist in merging with traffic. However, it faced opposition from local residents, concerned about the loss of the view from their homes, as well as environmentalists concerned about nearby wetlands. Further objections espoused the view that the congestion would continue to increase, regardless of what was done, and that the new road would be at capacity in a few years. The San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) funded the construction with $110 million (equivalent to $ in ) in mid-2000. Construction of the \\"dual freeway\\" began in early 2002, at a cost of $182 million (equivalent to $ in ). The northbound lanes were scheduled to open in February 2006. The southbound lanes were completed in early 2007. That year, a three-year project began to allow robot controlled vehicles, including buses and trucks, to use a special lane. The intention is to allow the vehicles to travel at shorter following distances and thereby allow more vehicles to use the lanes. The vehicles will still have drivers since they need to enter and exit the special lanes. The system was designed by Swoop Technology, based in San Diego County. Two years later, construction began on two auxiliary lanes on I-805 southbound from SR 54 to Bonita Road, to improve traffic flow at the SR 54 interchange. In 2010, Caltrans proposed adding high-occupancy toll express lanes between SR 15 and East Palomar Street in Chula Vista. The California Transportation Commission (CTC) awarded $100 million for the work in June 2011, which would be split into two phases at the interchange with SR 54. Work is also underway to add two HOV lanes between SR 52 and Mira Mesa Boulevard; this project also received $59.5 million from the CTC in September 2011. Meanwhile, SANDAG made arrangements to purchase the SR 125 toll road and reduce the tolls, which was hoped to encourage commuters to take that road instead of I-805 and reduce congestion; this would then enable Caltrans to construct two managed lanes instead of the original four. In February 2013, construction began on the northern HOV lanes; the project is expected to cost $86 million. By May, construction on the Palomar Street direct access ramps had begun, and the Carroll Canyon Road ramps were almost finished. The northern project was completed in 2015, and the southern express lanes opened in March 2014 at a cost of $1.4 billion, with an option to expand them into two lanes in each direction, and a proposed direct ramp to the express lanes. A 2012 Caltrans report proposed adding four managed lanes along the entire length of the highway. Construction on HOV lanes from SR 905 to SR 15 began in 2016.

The state highway is an Interstate route, traveling around the city of Kennewick, the largest of the three Tri-Cities in Eastern Washington. I-182 passes through the cities of Richland and Pasco, located in Benton and Franklin counties, respectively. The four-lane freeway, which is concurrent with U.S. Route 12 (US 12) for its entire length, begins at an interchange with I-82 in the Horse Heaven Hills and runs through Richland, becoming concurrent with State Route 240 (SR 240). I-182 and US 12 cross over the Columbia River into Pasco on the Interstate 182 Bridge and become concurrent with US 395 before the former designation ends abruptly. Route description I-182 eastbound approaching the Queensgate Drive exit in western Richland The freeway begins southwest Richland at a trumpet interchange with I-82 and US 12, located near Badger Mountain. The concurrent I-182 and US 12 travel northeast through Goose Gap in the Horse Heaven Hills and enters Richland, where it passes through housing subdivisions and a retail district surrounding the Queensgate Drive interchange. The freeway then crosses over the Yakima River and intersects SR 240, beginning a short concurrency along the southern outskirts of central Richland. SR 240 splits from the freeway at the following junction, a cloverstack interchange with George Washington Way, and travels southeast towards Kennewick. I-182 and US 12 continue across the Columbia River on the Interstate 182 Bridge, formally the Lee-Volpentest Bridges, which carry six freeway lanes and a section of the Sacagawea Heritage Trail on twin concrete spans. The freeway continues northeast into Franklin County and the city limits of Pasco. I-182 enters Pasco and turns 90 degrees southeast towards the city center after intersections with Broadmoor Boulevard and Road 68 at Gesa Stadium. The freeway intersects US 395 in a trumpet interchange, beginning a third concurrency, and 20th Avenue in a partial cloverleaf interchange near Columbia Basin College and the Tri-Cities Airport, utilizing an eastbound collector-distributor lane. I-182 continues east, forming the northern boundary of downtown Pasco, intersecting 4th Avenue before crossing over a BNSF-owned railyard. The freeway reaches a cloverleaf interchange with SR 397, where US 395 splits off to travel north towards Spokane. I-182 ends southeast of the interchange, while the roadway continues southeastward towards Burbank and Walla Walla as US 12. I-182 is defined by the Washington State Legislature as SR 182, part of the Revised Code of Washington as ¬ß47.17.020. As a component of the Interstate Highway System, the highway is listed as part of the National Highway System for its entire length, classifying it as important to the national economy, defense, and mobility. The Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) maintains the freeway and designates the corridor as a Highway of Statewide Significance, which includes highways that connect major communities in the state of Washington. WSDOT also conducts an annual series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume, which is expressed in terms of annual average daily traffic (AADT), a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. WSDOT calculated that the busiest section of I-182 is between its interchange with SR 240 and the Interstate 182 Bridge in Richland, where approximately 60,000 vehicles used the freeway on average each day in 2013; in contrast, the lowest traffic level on I-182 was 8,900 vehicles at its western terminus with I-82. History I-182 and US 12 on the Interstate 182 Bridge, which has spanned the Columbia River between Richland and Pasco since 1984. As part of Washington's first connected state highway system, the Washington State Legislature designated the Inland Empire Highway between Ellensburg and Laurier in 1913.: \\"A highway connecting with the Sunset Highway at or in the vicinity of the city of Ellensburg; thence by way of North Yakima, Kennewick, Pasco, Walla Walla, Dayton, crossing the Snake River at either Almota or Penawawa, Colfax, Rosalia, Spokane, Deer Park, Loon Lake, Colville, to the international line at boundary, which shall be known as the Inland Empire Highway.\\" The State Highway Board selected a route that would connect the main cities of Eastern Washington and the Inland Empire, which were Ellensburg, Yakima, the Tri-Cities, Colfax, and Spokane. In 1923, by which time the entire road had been improved, the highway became State Road 3 (Primary State Highway 3 after 1937), but retained its name.: \\"A primary state highway, to be known as State Road No. 3, or the Inland Empire Highway, is established as follows: Beginning at the international boundary line at Laurier in Ferry County; thence by the most feasible route in a southerly direction through Colville, Spokane, Colfax, Dayton to Walla Walla; thence in a northwesterly direction through the cities of Wallula, Pasco, Sunnyside, Yakima, Ellensburg, to a junction with the Sunset Highway at or near Virden in Kittitas County; also from a junction at Dodge in Garfield County; thence in an easterly direction through the cities of Pomeroy and Clarkston; thence in a southerly direction to Asotin in Asotin County; also from a junction at Wallula; thence in a southwesterly direction to the Oregon state line; also from a junction at Walla Walla in a southerly direction to the Oregon State line.\\" By that time, all of the route of Interstate 182 became a part of US 410 and US 395; both were established in 1926. When I-82 was approved in 1956, the Tri-Cities wanted an Interstate, since Interstate 82 bypassed the cities. Interstate 182 was the solution and created a connection to the Tri-Cities. Legally, I-182 is defined by the Revised Code of Washington ¬ß 47.17.372.

Aerial warfare includes bombers attacking enemy installations or a concentration of enemy troops or strategic targets; fighter aircraft battling for control of airspace; attack aircraft engaging in close air support against ground targets; naval aviation flying against sea and nearby land targets; gliders, helicopters and other aircraft to carry airborne forces such as paratroopers; aerial refueling tankers to extend operation time or range; and military transport aircraft to move cargo and personnel.See John Andreas Olsen, ed., A History of Air Warfare (2010) for global coverage since 1900. Historically, military aircraft have included lighter-than-air balloons carrying artillery observers; lighter-than-air airships for bombing cities; various sorts of reconnaissance, surveillance and early warning aircraft carrying observers, cameras and radar equipment; torpedo bombers to attack enemy shipping; and military air-sea rescue aircraft for saving downed airmen. Modern aerial warfare includes missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles. Surface forces are likely to respond to enemy air activity with anti-aircraft warfare.  History  The history of aerial warfare began in ancient times, with the use of man-carrying kites in Ancient China. In the third century it progressed to balloon warfare. Airplanes were put to use for war starting in 1911, initially for aerial reconnaissance, and then for aerial combat to shoot down the enemy reconnaissance planes. Aircraft continued to carry out these roles during World War I, where the use of planes and zeppelins for strategic bombing also emerged. During World War II, the use of strategic bombing increased, while airborne forces, missiles, and early precision-guided munitions were introduced. Ballistic missiles became of key importance during the Cold War, were armed with nuclear warheads, and were stockpiled by the United States and the Soviet Union to deter each other from using them. The first military satellites were used for reconnaissance in the 1950s, and their use has progressed to worldwide communication and information systems that support globally distributed military users with intelligence from orbit.  Aerial reconnaissance  Aerial reconnaissance is reconnaissance for a military or strategic purpose that is conducted using reconnaissance aircraft. This role can fulfil a variety of requirements, including the collection of imagery intelligence, observation of enemy maneuvers and artillery spotting.  Air combat manoeuvring  Air combat manoeuvring (also known as ACM or dogfighting) is the tactical art of moving, turning and situating a fighter aircraft in order to attain a position from which an attack can be made on another aircraft. It relies on offensive and defensive basic fighter manoeuvring (BFM) to gain an advantage over an aerial opponent.  Airborne forces  Airborne forces are military units, usually light infantry, set up to be moved by aircraft and \\"dropped\\" into battle, typically by parachute. Thus, they can be placed behind enemy lines, and have the capability to deploy almost anywhere with little warning. The formations are limited only by the number and size of their aircraft, so given enough capacity a huge force can appear \\"out of nowhere\\" in minutes, an action referred to as vertical envelopment. Conversely, airborne forces typically lack the supplies and equipment for prolonged combat operations, and are therefore more suited for airhead operations than for long-term occupation; furthermore, parachute operations are particularly sensitive to adverse weather conditions. Advances in helicopter technology since World War II have brought increased flexibility to the scope of airborne operations, and air assaults have largely replaced large-scale parachute operations, and (almost) completely replaced combat glider operations.  Airstrike  An airstrike or air strikeair strike- DOD Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms is an offensive operation carried out by attack aircraft. Air strikes are commonly delivered from aircraft such as fighters, bombers, ground attack aircraft, and attack helicopters. The official definition includes all sorts of targets, including enemy air targets, but in popular use the term is usually narrowed to a tactical (small- scale) attack on a ground or naval objective. Weapons used in an airstrike can range from machine gun bullets and missiles to various types of bombs. It is also commonly referred to as an air raid. In close air support, air strikes are usually controlled by trained observers for coordination with friendly ground troops in a manner derived from artillery tactics.  Strategic bombing  Strategic bombing is a military strategy used in a total war with the goal of defeating the enemy by destroying their morale or their economic ability to produce and transport materiel to the theatres of military operations, or both. It is a systematically organized and executed attack from the air which can utilize strategic bombers, long- or medium-range missiles, or nuclear- armed fighter-bomber aircraft to attack targets deemed vital to the enemy's war-making capability.  Anti-aircraft warfare  Anti-aircraft warfare or counter-air defence is defined by NATO as \\"all measures designed to nullify or reduce the effectiveness of hostile air action.\\"AAP-6 They include ground-and air-based weapon systems, associated sensor systems, command and control arrangements and passive measures (e.g. barrage balloons). It may be used to protect naval, ground, and air forces in any location. However, for most countries the main effort has tended to be 'homeland defence'. NATO refers to airborne air defence as counter-air and naval air defence as anti-aircraft warfare. Missile defence is an extension of air defence as are initiatives to adapt air defence to the task of intercepting any projectile in flight.  Missiles  In modern usage, a missile is a self-propelled precision-guided munition system, as opposed to an unguided self-propelled munition, referred to as a rocket (although these too can also be guided). Missiles have four system components: targeting and/or missile guidance, flight system, engine, and warhead. Missiles come in types adapted for different purposes: surface- to-surface and air-to-surface missiles (ballistic, cruise, anti-ship, anti- tank, etc.), surface-to-air missiles (and anti-ballistic), air-to-air missiles, and anti-satellite weapons. All known existing missiles are designed to be propelled during powered flight by chemical reactions inside a rocket engine, jet engine, or other type of engine. Non-self-propelled airborne explosive devices are generally referred to as shells and usually have a shorter range than missiles. In ordinary British-English usage predating guided weapons, a missile is \\"any thrown object\\", such as objects thrown at players by rowdy spectators at a sporting event.Guardian newspaper: \\"Emmanuel Ebou√© pelted with missiles while playing for Galatasaray\\" Example of ordinary English usage. In this case the missiles were bottles and cigarette lighters  UAVs  The advent of the unmanned aerial vehicle has dramatically revolutionized aerial warfare with multiple nations developing and/or purchasing UAV fleets. Several benchmarks have already occurred, including a UAV-fighter jet dogfight, probes of adversary air defense with UAVs, replacement of an operational flight wing's aircraft with UAVs, control of UAVs qualifying the operator for 'combat' status, UAV-control from the other side of the world, jamming and/or data-hijacking of UAVs in flight, as well as proposals to transfer fire authority to AI aboard a UAV. UAVs have quickly evolved from surveillance to combat roles. The growing capability of UAVs has thrown into question the survivability and capability of manned fighter jets.

A conference call is a telephone call in which someone talks to several people at the same time. The conference call may be designed to allow the called party to participate during the call or set up so that the called party merely listens into the call and cannot speak. It is sometimes called ATC (audio teleconference). Conference calls can be designed so that the calling party calls the other participants and adds them to the call; however, participants are usually able to call into the conference call themselves by dialing a telephone number that connects to a \\"conference bridge,\\" which is a specialized type of equipment that links telephone lines. Companies commonly use a specialized service provider who maintains the conference bridge, or who provides the phone numbers and PIN codes that participants dial to access the meeting or conference call. These service providers can often dial-out to participants, connecting them to call and introducing them to the parties who are on-the- line. The operators can also take additional information such as question and answer details and also enable and disable advanced conferencing features such as muting lines, muting participants and enabling a recording feature. An operator can often be summoned to conference call hosted by a service provider using a combination of keys on a users' (sometimes only the moderator) telephone keypad. The most common recall function is *0. (asterisk and the zero/operator key) The more limited three-way calling is available (usually at an extra charge) on home or office phone lines. For a three-way call, the first called party is dialed. Then the hook flash button (or recall button) is pressed and the other called party's phone number is dialed. While it is ringing, flash/recall is pressed again to connect the three people together. This option allows callers to add a second outgoing call to an already connected call. Usage =Business= Businesses use conference calls daily to meet with remote parties, both internally and outside of their company. Common applications are client meetings or sales presentations, project meetings and updates, regular team meetings, training classes and communication to employees who work in different locations. Conference calling is viewed as a primary means of cutting travel costs and allowing workers to be more productive by not having to go out-of-office for meetings. Conference calls are used by nearly all United States public corporations to report their quarterly results. These calls usually allow for questions from stock analysts and are called earnings calls. A standard conference call begins with a disclaimer stating that anything said in the duration of the call may be a forward-looking statement, and that results may vary significantly. The CEO, CFO, or investor relations officer then will read the company's quarterly report. Lastly, the call is opened for questions from analysts. Conference calls are increasingly used in conjunction with web conferences, where presentations or documents are shared via the internet. This allows people on the call to view content such as corporate reports, sales figures and company data presented by one of the participants. The main benefit is that the presenter of the document can give clear explanations about details within the document, while others simultaneously view the presentation. Care should be taken not to mix video and audio source on the same network since the video feed can cause interruptions on sound quality. It is important to pay attention to conference call etiquette when participating; for example, one should refrain from shouting and multitasking in certain cases. Care should also be taken to schedule a call at a convenient time. Business conference calls are usually hosted or operator-assisted, with a variety of features. Conference calls are also beginning to cross over into the world of podcasting and social networking, which in turn fosters new kinds of interaction patterns. Live streaming or broadcasting of conference calls allows a larger audience access to the call without dialing into a bridge. In addition, organizers of conference calls can publish a dial-in number alongside the audio stream, creating potential for audience members to dial in and interact. The UK government has changed flexible working rights since 2014, so that employees who have been working full-time for a company or organisation can lawfully request flexible working. In recent years, there have been a number of different types of flexible working options as a result of conference calling technology enabling employees to work remotely. =Flat-rate conferencing= Flat-rate conferencing services are being offered which give unlimited access to a conference bridge at a fixed monthly cost. Because telecommunication carriers offer free long-distance bundled with local service, this alternative is gaining widespread popularity for budget conscious businesses and non-profits. In the UK, there are conference services offered on a pay-as-you-go basis where the cost of the phone calls (using 0843/0844, or 0871/0872 non-geographic revenue sharing numbers) from each of the participants covers the cost of the conference service. With this service type there is no monthly charge and usually no contracts to sign. =Prepaid conference calls= Prepaid conference call services allow businesses and individuals to purchase conferencing services online, and conduct conference calls on a pay-as-you-go basis. Typically, a conference call PIN and its associated calling instructions are displayed immediately online after being purchased and/or sent via email. Generally, prepaid conference call services are used with a landline telephone, mobile phone, or computer, and there is no need to buy additional expensive telecommunications hardware or add/switch long-distance service. Some services allow one to start or join a conference call from virtually any country worldwide‚Äîwith appropriate telephone access. Large telecommunications providers such as AT&T;, Embarq (formerly Sprint), Verizon and other large to medium conferencing service providers maintain a dominant position in the conferencing niche; servicing many of the world's biggest brands. However, the Internet and improved global VoIP networks have helped to significantly reduce the barrier of entry into this niche. =Free conference calling= Free conferencing is different from traditional conference calling in that it has no organizer fees, no human operator, and allows for multiple people to connect at no cost other than that of any other phone call (local or toll). Companies that provide free conference call services are usually compensated through a revenue-sharing arrangement with the local phone company, sharing the termination charge for incoming calls to a phone carrier. In the case of free conference calling, the conferencing company strikes an agreement with the local phone company that hosts the conferencing bridge (equipment connecting lines) to receive a share of the terminating access charge received for connecting the call. At large carriers such as AT&T; and Verizon, they keep these access charges for their own conferencing services in addition to charging the customer for the conference service. With free conference calling, as mentioned above, there are no organizer fees so these services do not double-dip: the consumer pays for a regular call with the same three components ‚Äì origination, transport, and termination ‚Äì of any call. In other words, the call costs the same as any other call under the customer's calling plan, but the conferencing is included for free to the host and participants of the conference call. In November 2011, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) published a 732-page Order on InterCarrier Compensation (ICC), including rules governing revenue sharing. Citing Section 251(b)(5) of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the FCC mandated that terminating access rates for all calls (not just conference calls) be leveled in 2012 and 2013, then reduced in three increments over the subsequent three years until they reached $0 in 2017.FCC Releases Connect America Fund Order, Reforms USF/ICC for Broadband, pg 215 These mostly sub-1 cent charges are replaced with an access recovery charge (ARC) that is added onto every customers' bill by their phone carriers. In other words, every phone company will get to keep the terminating access charges they had to pay out to connect each call while charging consumers more whether they make calls or not. This order has been challenged at the Federal Appeals Court by several parties. As for revenue sharing, the order adds a measure for high volume call traffic which triggers an immediate terminating access charge reduction to the lowest rate of any carrier in that state. In the United Kingdom, the 0870 prefix was originally used by UK-based free conference calling providers in order to receive a rebate from every call from a telephone company that owns the number. However, in April 2009 Ofcom, the independent regulator and competition authority for the UK communications industries, announced that the rebate that is payable to the telecom's supplier when an 0870 number is used would be removed. Systems were soon moved to 0844 and 0871 prefixes in order to retain the revenue sharing arrangement, this means that whilst you wouldn't pay the conference call provider directly, you would dial an expensive premium-rate number to access your conference call. Recently in the UK, a very small number of conference call providers have begun to use 03 numbers, which are included in bundled minutes under Ofcom regulations. This has provided the option to hold conference calls without any costs whatsoever, as call are included in the minutes bundles provided by most UK network operators. There is a general trend for companies in the UK to more to 03 numbers for inbound services because these numbers are more palatable to the caller. A distinct difference between sound quality of paid and free conference calls has been noted by customers who have claimed to hear background noises when using the free conferencing services, which rarely happens on paid conference calling services. =Premium conferencing= Here participants dial in on a premium- rate number such as a toll free number in the US. The conference is typically hosted by the party that perceives value in the call in order to justify the cost: this could be a business owner, a non-profit board member, an educator, lawyer, or expert in any given field. That person then usually pays for the cost of the call. Premium conferencing can also be used for charitable fundraisers.

It is a spur route of I-84 that connects the freeway to Downtown Boise, terminating at U.S. Route 20 (US 20) and U.S. Route 26 (US 26). The Interstate is also known as the Boise Connector. Route description Westbound on I-184 from Orchard Street near downtown Boise I-184 begins at the \\"Flying Wye\\" interchange with I-84 and US 30 in southwestern Boise. The six-lane freeway travels northeast through suburban Boise, crossing over a spur railroad near an interchange with Franklin Street on the south side of the Boise Towne Square shopping mall. I-184 intersects Curtis Road near the Saint Alphonsus Regional Medical Center and turns due east along Fairview Avenue, which acts a frontage road. On the west side of the Boise River in Rotary Park, I-184 terminates after an interchange with US 20 and US 26, which serve northwestern Boise on Chinden Boulevard. US 20 and US 26 supersede I-184 and cross into Downtown Boise, where it splits into Front and Myrtle streets. Interstate 184 is the only three-digit Interstate route in Idaho and the state's shortest, at . The highway is maintained by the Idaho Transportation Department (ITD), which conducts an annual survey of traffic on certain highway segments that is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic (AADT), a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. The sole traffic recording device on I-184 reported a daily average of 81,140 vehicles on the highway in 2017. History The Boise Connector was planned in the early 1960s to connect the Boise freeway bypass to downtown Boise and its inner neighborhoods. One version of the plan proposed a full loop bisecting downtown Boise to carry Interstate 80N (I-80N), but it was rejected in favor of a less costly spur route. The westernmost section of the connector, including a sprawling wye interchange with I-80N, was opened to traffic on December 12, 1968, a year before the rest of the bypass. Parts of the connector were signed as part of SH-55 until it was realigned in the 1980s. The freeway was numbered Interstate 180N until October 13, 1979, when I-184 was adopted to match I-84, which was planned to succeeded I-80N. It was the only signed suffixed auxiliary Interstate route in the nation. When Interstate 80N was redesignated Interstate 84, this highway was re-designated Business Loop I-84 through Boise. The current I-184 designation was signed when the construction upgrading the route to Interstate standards was completed in 1990. The new bridge across the Boise River was opened on August 7, 1992, replacing a pair of smaller bridges to the north. The westernmost segment of I-184, including the Flying Wye interchange, was rebuilt from 1999 to 2004 to accommodate an additional set of lanes. The project cost $86 million and was delayed several times due to a dispute with the Environmental Protection Agency.

It is a passerine bird in the tit family, the Paridae. It is the state bird of Massachusetts and Maine in the United States, and the provincial bird of New Brunswick in Canada. It is well known for its ability to lower its body temperature during cold winter nights, its good spatial memory to relocate the caches where it stores food, and its boldness near humans (sometimes feeding from the hand). Taxonomy In 1760, French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the black-capped chickadee in his Ornithologie based on a specimen collected in Canada. He used the French name La m√©sange a t√™te noire de Canada and the Latin Parus Canadensis Atricapillus. The two stars (**) at the start of the section indicates that Brisson based his description on the examination of a specimen. Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. When in 1766, Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his Systema Naturae for the 12th edition, he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson. One of these was the black-capped chickadee. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name Parus atricapillus and cited Brisson's work. The type location was subsequently restricted to the site of Quebec in Canada. The specific epithet atricapillus is Latin for \\"black- haired\\" from ater \\"black\\" and capillus \\"hair of the head\\". Though originally placed in the genus Parus with most other tits, mtDNA cytochrome b sequence data and morphology suggest that separating Poecile more adequately expresses these birds' relationships. The genus Poecile had been introduced by German naturalist Johann Jakob Kaup in 1829. Molecular phylogenetic studies have shown that the black-capped chickadee is sister to the mountain chickadee (Poecile gambeli). At one time, the black-capped chickadee was considered by some to be conspecific with the willow tit of Eurasia, due to their very similar appearance. This is reflected in an older version of the Peterson Field Guide for the Birds of Britain and Europe, which states \\"N Am. Black- Capped Chickadee\\" as an alternate name for the willow tit. In fact, the willow tit, black-capped chickadee, marsh tit, and Carolina chickadee are all very similar to one another in appearance. Nine subspecies are recognised. The chickadee was known as kejegigilhasis by the Penobscot people speaking the Abenaki language. Description Black-capped chickadee clinging to a wire The black-capped chickadee has a black cap and \\"bib\\" with white sides to the face. Its underparts are white with rusty brown on the flanks.

Although range can generally be used to separate them, the black-capped chickadee is very similar in appearance to the Carolina chickadee. The black-capped is larger on average, but this cannot be used reliably for identification. The most obvious difference between the two is in the wing feathers. In the black-capped chickadee, the wing feathers have white edges that are larger and more conspicuous than those of the Carolina chickadee. The latter is often mistaken for black-capped chickadees with feather dystrophy, which sometimes affects the appearance of the primary feathers making them look slimmer, a phenomenon caused by illnesses such as fatty liver disease in malnourished birds. Overall, the Carolina appears slightly paler colored, whereas the flanks of the black-capped can appear to have a trace of off-yellow or rusty coloration. Also, the black-capped generally has a more \\"ragged\\" looking black bib, whereas the bib of the Carolina has a more smooth-edged look. These subtle features are often even more vague in populations around where the black-capped and Carolina overlap in range (possibly the result of hybrids) and the two cannot always be distinguished as two species. The two species were formerly thought to be easily distinguished by call, but they often learn each other's vocalizations where their ranges overlap (their point of overlap is a narrow band that runs along the east-central United States, with the black-capped chickadee to the north). A bird located near the zone of overlap that sings both songs, or sings \\"odd-sounding\\" songs, cannot be positively identified solely by voice in the field.Tricky Bird IDs: Black-capped and Carolina chickadees. Birds.cornell.edu. Retrieved on 2013-03-23. =Vocalization= Black-capped chickadee, Iona Beach Regional Park The vocalizations of the black-capped chickadee are highly complex. Thirteen distinct types of vocalizations have been classified, many of which are complex and can communicate different types of information. Chickadees' complex vocalizations are likely an evolutionary adaptation to their habitat: they live and feed in dense vegetation, and even when the flock is close together, individual birds tend to be out of each other's visual range. One of the most recognizable sounds produced, particularly by the males, is the two-note fee-bee song. It is a simple, clear whistle of two notes, identical in rhythm, the first roughly a whole-step above the second. The range of frequencies at which this song starts from varies; the complete frequency range spans roughly 1 kHz. Within this range, male chickadees can sing at various tones. The average starting frequency is around 4000 Hz. A decrease of roughly 200 Hz occurs when the first note (fee) is sung, and then another decrease around 400 Hz takes place between the end of fee and the beginning of bee. In spite of these multiple changes in frequency, though, anybody listening to the song only hears a pure, high- frequency tone. This is distinguished from the Carolina chickadee's four-note call fee-bee fee-bay; the lower notes are nearly identical but the higher fee notes are omitted, making the black-capped song like bee bay. The males sing the song only in relative isolation from other chickadees (including their mates). In late summer, some young birds sing only a single note. A recent study found that female fee-bee songs have both similarities with and differences from male fee-bee songs. Both sexes sometimes make a faint version of the song, and this appears to be used when feeding young. When males are out in the wild, they sing this song to defend their territory or attract a mate. It is rare, but a few accounts have been given of females singing a louder version of the fee-bee song when out alone in the wild, too. The black- capped chickadee is a monomorphic species, so distinguishing males and females based solely on their singing is difficult. A bioacoustic analysis performed on both male and female songs revealed that male fee-bee singing fluctuates more, and the absolute amplitude of both sexes is the same. The fee glissando varies far more in females, which makes identifying each sex easier. The purpose of the female fee-bee song is unknown. The most familiar call is the chick-a-dee-dee-dee, which gave this bird its name. This simple-sounding call is astonishingly complex. Scientists have been studying it since the mid-1970s. It is produced by both males and females year-round. It has been observed to consist of up to four distinct units which can be arranged in different patterns to communicate information about threats from predators and coordination of group movement: A, B, C, and D. These four notes only ever appear in this consecutive order with each preceding note blending into the next. Not all four notes may appear in the call, though. Like other sounds the chickadee produces, it may be heard in multiple variations. The A and B notes are almost identical to one another in both frequency and duration. The black- capped chickadee possesses the ability to quickly notice the difference between these two notes. As for the C and D notes, no real similarity is seen between them. The C note fluctuates from low to high then back to low, whereas the D note has a constant frequency. While not confirmed, one study found evidence of a function behind the C and D notes. To be able to recognize the difference between a member of the same species and a potential predator, the D note is required. The C note is needed to locate food. Neither individual notes nor groups of notes have an equal probability of appearing in the chick- a-dee-dee song. Its syntax form may take on several different structures, but the two most commonly heard are [A][D] and [B][C][D]. (The brackets are placed around each note to show that it may be repeated more than once.) Any calls that contain the D note more frequently than others are more commonly heard. A recent study of the call showed that the number of dees indicates the level of threat from nearby predators. In an analysis of over 5,000 alarm calls from chickadees, alarm calls triggered by small, dangerous raptors had a shorter interval between chick and dee and tended to have extra dees, typically four instead of two. In one case, a warning call about a pygmy owl ‚Äì a prime threat to chickadees ‚Äì contained 23 dees. The Carolina chickadee makes a similar call, which is faster and higher-pitched. These chickadees make a number of other calls and sounds, such as a gargle noise usually used by males to indicate a threat of attacking another male, often when feeding. This call is also used in sexual contexts. Black-capped chickadees develop the gargle noise as a result of learning that starts soon after birth and continues through to adulthood. This noise is among the most complex of the calls, containing two to 9 of 14 distinct notes in one population that was studied. It only lasts for about half a second. Social learning, in particular, is largely influential to the development of this sound. Beginning 30 to 35 days after birth, strings of low-amplitude precursor or sub-gargles are produced for about a minute. At this time, the young have several close interactions with their family; they learn to produce such sounds by listening to their parents and siblings. Three chickadee populations were observed at three different sites over 8 years, and all of them produced vocalizations that were very similar to one another. Strings of juvenile sub-gargles are almost perfectly continuous and both low and unstable in frequency, yet lacking multiple syllables. When their vocal abilities are fully developed, a stable frequency is produced and a variety of syllables is heard that vary in length. Chickadees in an environment with ambient noise at the same frequencies as their songs have developed an evolutionary adaptation that enables them to adjust the frequency of their songs much quicker to effectively communicate with the surrounding population. The fee-bee songs of several male black- capped chickadees were monitored to identify their particular frequency. In one particular study, a series of both masking and nonmasking tones was played to multiple male chickadees at various locations to observe how they responded to interfering and noninterfering signals. When interacting with conspecifics close by, the males matched their frequencies, but when the surrounding environment was noisy with other species, the males adapted by increasing the frequency of their songs. The males responded quickly to the masking tones by raising their song frequencies. Another study, though, showed that male chickadees sometimes intentionally match the tones of competing conspecifics as a way of showing aggression. Dominant males in a population often compete with lower-ranked males; one is not at a greater or lesser advantage than the other. Singing contests are a way male chickadees decide who in a population gets to mate. When a male loses a contest, particularly a higher-ranking male in the population, he will often have difficulty finding a mate. Behaviour and ecology =Diet and foraging= Chickadees take food such as seeds from feeders and trays over to a tree branch to hammer them open. Insects (especially caterpillars) form a large part of their diet in summer. The birds hop along tree branches searching for food, sometimes hanging upside down or hovering; they may make short flights to catch insects in the air. Seeds and berries become more important in winter, though insect eggs and pupae remain on the menu. Black oil sunflower seeds are readily taken from bird feeders. The birds take a seed in their beak and commonly fly from the feeder to a tree, where they proceed to hammer the seed on a branch to open it. Like many other species in the family Paridae, black-capped chickadees commonly cache food, mostly seeds, but sometimes insects, also. Items are stored singly in various sites such as bark, dead leaves, clusters of conifer needles, or knothole. Memory for the location of caches can last up to 28 days. Within the first 24 hours, the birds can even remember the relative quality of the stored items. Foraging behaviour in the winter tends to decrease due to the changing weather. Such behaviour is largely influenced by wind and temperature. When wind speeds are higher, black-capped chickadees avoid exposure to such conditions by flying lower where vegetation offers a degree of protection, and when the temperature decreases, they search for food less frequently. In parts of the black-capped chickadee's range with very cold winters, such as Minnesota, survival rates are affected by access to supplemental food. Chickadees with access to bird feeders are twice as likely to survive the winter than those without access to this supplemental food. This difference in survival rates occurs primarily during months with severe weather when the temperature drops below -18¬∞C for more than five days. In Pennsylvania, with milder winters on the southern edge of their range, differences between populations with and without feeders suggest that feeders influence movements of chickadees rather than actual survival. At bird feeders, black-capped chickadees tolerate human approach to a much greater degree than other species do. In fact, during the winter, many individuals accustomed to human habitation readily accept seed from a person's hand. Chickadee at feeder =Metabolism= On cold winter nights, these birds can reduce their body temperature by as much as 12¬∞C (from their normal temperature of about 42¬∞C) to conserve energy. Such a capacity for torpor is not very common in birds. Other bird species capable of torpor include the common swift Apus apus, the common poor-will Phalaenoptilus nuttallii, the lesser nighthawk Chordeiles acutipennis, and various species of hummingbirds. =Movements= These birds are permanent residents, but sometimes they move south within their range, and even outside of it, in the fall or winter. During the winter, chickadees often flock together. Many other species of birds ‚Äì including titmice, nuthatches, and warblers ‚Äì can often be found foraging in these flocks. Mixed flocks stay together because the chickadees call out whenever they find a good source of food. This calling-out forms cohesion for the group, allowing the other birds to find food more efficiently. When flocking, black-capped chickadees soon establish a rigid social hierarchy. In such hierarchies, males usually rank over females, and older birds over juveniles. Black-capped chickadees sleep in thick vegetation or in cavities, usually singly, though they may occasionally roost clumped together. Their sleeping posture is with the beak tucked under the scapular (shoulder) feathers. Their flight is slightly undulating with rapid wing beats. Flight speed is about . =Molt= Chickadees molt once a year; no prenuptial molt occurs in the spring. The postjuvenal molt at the end of the first summer of life is partial, involving only the body feathers and wing coverts. Thereafter, the postnuptial molts at the end of each reproductive season are always complete, involving all feathers. =Breeding= The black-capped chickadee nests in a hole in a tree, above ground. The pair either excavates the hole together, or uses a natural cavity, or sometimes an old woodpecker nest. This species will also nest in a nesting box. The nesting season is from late April through June. The nest is built by the female only. It consists of a base of coarse material such as moss or bark strips, and lining of finer material such as mammal hair. Eggs are white with fine dots of reddish brown concentrated at the larger end. On average, eggs are . Clutch size is six to eight eggs. Incubation lasts 11‚Äì14 days and is by the female only, which is fed by the male. If an unusual disturbance ocurs at the nest entrance, the incubating female may utter an explosive hiss, like that of a snake, a probable adaptation to discourage nest predators.Forbush, E.H. (1925-29) Birds of Massachusetts and other New England states. Mass. Dept. of Agriculture, Boston. Hatchlings are altricial, naked with their eyes closed. Nestlings are fed by both sexes, but are brooded by the female only (when the male brings food to her, which she passes on to the young). Young leave the nest 12‚Äì16 days after hatching, in great part because the parents start presenting food only outside the nest hole. The young are still fed by the parents for several weeks, but are capable of catching food on their own within a week after leaving the nest. Black-capped chickadees usually breed only once a year, but second broods are possible if the first one is lost. First breeding is at one year of age. Maximum recorded lifespan is 12 years, but most individuals live only half that long. Black-capped chickadees are socially monogamous, and males contribute greatly to reproduction. During the laying and incubation periods, males feed their partners extensively. When the nestlings hatch, males are the primary providers, but as the nestlings grow, females become the main caretakers. Females prefer dominant males, and greater reproductive success is closely related to the higher ranking of the male. Black-capped chickadees may interbreed with Carolina chickadees or mountain chickadees where their ranges overlap. It appears to be more rare, but interbreeding with boreal chickadees has also been documented. =Dominance hierarchy= During the winter, the species forms flocks through which dominance hierarchies can be easily observed. Dominance hierarchies play an important role in determining the social behaviors among the birds in these flocks. Positive correlates to higher social rankings include territory size, body condition, singing rate, and reproductive success. The hierarchies are linear and stable; once a relationship is established between two birds, it stays the same for many years. In general, older and more experienced birds are dominant over younger ones, and males are dominant over females. Dominant and subordinate members differ in their foraging strategies and risk-taking behaviors. Dominant individuals control access to preferred resources and restrict subordinates to foraging in novel, riskier, or suboptimal environments. Subordinate individuals are often observed foraging in the outermost tree parts that are more prone to predators, while dominant individuals forage low and close to the tree trunk. In experiments, subordinate individuals display less neophobia when approaching novel foods and objects, compared to their dominant counterparts. Subordinate individuals are also more likely to enter novel environments than their dominant counterparts. This is similar to subordinate primates, which feed on novel food more readily than the dominant individuals because they are more used to eating suboptimal and unfamiliar food. No difference is observed in ability to learn novel foraging tasks between dominant and subordinate individuals. State and provincial bird The black-capped chickadee is the state bird of Maine and Massachusetts and the provincial bird of New Brunswick. In 2014, the black-capped chickadee was named the official bird of Vancouver for 2015. The bird is prominently featured on the standard Maine license plate, as well as welcome signs on major roadways in Massachusetts. Conservation The IUCN classifies the black-capped chickadee as least concern due to its wide distribution and large populations. In Alaska and Washington, and parts of western Canada, black-capped chickadees are among a number of bird species affected by an unknown agent that is causing beak deformities, which may cause stress for affected species by inhibiting feeding ability, mating, and grooming. Black-capped chickadees were the first affected bird species, with reports of the deformity beginning in Alaska in the late 1990s, but more recently the deformity has been observed in close to 30 bird species in the affected areas.Beak Deformities.

Its primary meaning is general and widespread. It is used as an anime and manga term to mean \\"extra or bonus.\\" In the United States, the term is most often used in a narrow sense by anime fans to describe special features on DVD releases: deleted scenes, interviews with the actors, \\"the making of\\" documentary clips, outtakes, amusing bloopers, and so forth. However, this use of the term actually predates the DVD medium by several years. For at least the past fifty years in Japan, omake of small character figurines and toys have been giveaways that come with soft drinks and candy and sometimes the omake is more desired than the product being sold. In English, the term is often used with this meaning, although it generally only applies to features included with anime, tokusatsu, and occasionally manga. It is thus generally limited to use amongst fans of Japanese pop culture (sometimes called otaku); like many loan words from Japanese, omake is both the singular and plural form. Description Omake often include comedy sketches where the characters behave out of character, break the fourth wall, or subtly address opinions of the fandom known to the writers. Sometimes scenes from the TV show or OVA are humorously re-dubbed. One example, included on the Video Girl Ai DVD, replays scenes from the OVA series with new voice-acting in a rural accent. Other times, the same actors voice a new script that is more sexually suggestive, often ludicrously so. Omake can also consist of non-canonical, and often comedic crossover clips that sometimes occur at the end of episodes of two shows airing concurrently from the same studio, such as recent Kamen Rider and Super Sentai programs. chibi versions of the main characters attempt to explain the concept of \\"Ice II\\" For anime, these are often presented in super deformed style, in the same way manga omake often is. For example, the anime OAV Gunbuster features super deformed characters trying to explain what the writers know to be mostly pseudo-science, or talking about their relationships with each other in a way they do not in the series itself. In the anime series Reborn!, one of the characters named Haru Miura has an interview with each of the characters of the anime in chibi forms, and the characters' answers to the questions are often something they would never say in the anime or the manga. For live action programs, although not animated, the expressions and sound effects used for comedic purposes can often be inspired by the omake found in the animated mediums. The term \\"omake\\" has use also in video games; the Sega game Shenmue II for the Dreamcast had a hidden folder on the game disc labelled \\"Omake\\", found by placing the disc into a computer, containing exclusive wallpapers and conception art. Another example of an omake in popular culture is related to Square's Final Fantasy IX. The secret \\"Blackjack\\" minigame after completion of the game is accessed by means of a button combination. The Final Fantasy \\"Playonline\\" site has a secrets section for Final Fantasy IX, which requires passwords given in the official Piggyback guide to enter. The password needed to reveal the button combination for the Blackjack minigame is E-OMAKE. The minigame itself is an omake. In some fiction writing communities based on forum sites, the term \\"omake\\" refer to derivative stories posted in a story thread, usually by users other than the author of the thread, and as a general rule are non-canonical by default. Members of these communities occasionally refer to having written or posted an omake with the term \\"omaked.\\" Omake occasionally appears in fanfiction about anime or manga, after the story itself, usually as a humorous \\"alternative ending\\". An example of this is that at the end of each episode of Dance in the Vampire Bund is a 20‚Äì30 second chibi skit called \\"Dance with the Vampire Maids\\".

It is a spur auxiliary route of I-5 that runs from near Dunnigan south to I-80 in Vacaville. I-505 is primarily a rural Interstate, but travels through Vacaville and the city of Winters. The highway is the primary route connecting the San Francisco Bay Area and the northern Sacramento Valley, bypassing Sacramento and its attendant city traffic. Thus, it is a major route for travelers heading directly from the San Francisco Bay Area to the Pacific Northwest. Power lines connecting Path 15 to Path 66 follow the highway for a while, until one heads northeast and the other northwest. Route description The southern terminus of I-505 is at I-80 next to the Nut Tree Airport in the Nut Tree area in Vacaville. From there, it travels north about ten miles through rural areas near the western edge of the Sacramento Valley before reaching Winters. I-505 then skirts the eastern city limits of Winters, intersecting with State Route 128 ‚Äì the only exit in Winters. After leaving that city, the interstate then proceeds north through rural areas again for about 20 miles until it reaches its northern terminus with I-5 near Dunnigan. For most of its length, I-505 is a four-lane freeway, which is typical for rural interstates in California. I-505 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. History What is now I-505 was originally conceived as part of a loop Interstate with a directional suffix, I-5W. However, I-5W and most of the other Interstates around the country with directional suffixes were eventually renumbered or eliminated, except I-35E and I-35W in Texas and Minnesota and I-69 segments I-69W, I-69C and I-69E in southern Texas.

A loose bull is lassoed by a pickup rider during a rodeo Charro with lariat at a horse show in Pachuca, Hidalgo, Mexico Lassoing on the prairie (from the book Prairie Experiences in Handling Cattle and Sheep, by Major W. Shepherd, 1884) A lasso ( or ), also called lariat, riata, or reata (all from Castilian, la reata 're- tied rope'), is a loop of rope designed as a restraint to be thrown around a target and tightened when pulled. It is a well-known tool of the Spanish and Mexican cowboy, then adopted by the United States cowboy. The word is also a verb; to lasso is to throw the loop of rope around something. Although the tool has several proper names, such terms are rarely employed by those who actually use it; nearly all United States cowboys simply call it a \\"rope,\\" and the use of such \\"roping\\". Overview A lasso is made from stiff rope so that the noose stays open when the lasso is thrown. It also allows the cowboy to easily open up the noose from horseback to release the cattle because the rope is stiff enough to be pushed a little. A high quality lasso is weighted for better handling. The lariat has a small reinforced loop at one end, called a honda or hondo, through which the rope passes to form a loop. The honda can be formed by a honda knot (or another loop knot), an eye splice, a seizing, rawhide, or a metal ring. The other end is sometimes tied simply in a small, tight, overhand knot to prevent fraying. Most modern lariats are made of stiff nylon or polyester rope, usually about 5/16 or 3/8 in (8 or 9.5 mm) diameter and in lengths of 28, 30, or 35 ft (8.5, 9 or 11 m) for arena-style roping and anywhere from for Californio-style roping. The reata is made of braided (or less commonly, twisted) rawhide and is made in lengths from to over . Mexican maguey (agave) and cotton ropes are also used in the longer lengths. The lasso is used today in rodeos as part of the competitive events, such as calf roping and team roping. It is also still used on working ranches to capture cattle or other livestock when necessary. After catching the cattle, the lasso can be tied or wrapped (dallied) around the horn, a typical feature on the front of a western saddle. With the lasso around the horn, the cowboy can use his horse as the equivalent of a tow truck with a winch. Part of the historical culture of both the vaqueros of Mexico and the cowboys of the Western United States is a related skill now called \\"trick roping\\", a performance of assorted lasso spinning tricks. The Hollwood film star Will Rogers was a well-known practitioner of trick roping and the natural horsemanship practitioner Buck Brannaman also got his start as a trick roper when he was a child. Etymology The word lasso seems to have begun to be used as an English word in the early nineteenth century. It comes from the Castilian word lazo, which is first attested in the thirteenth century in the sense 'noose, snare', and derives in turn from classical Latin laqueus ('noose, snare, trap, bond, tie').\\"lace, n. and adj.\\", \\"lasso, n.\\" OED Online, Oxford University Press, July 2018, .

Huns are recorded as using lassos in battle to ensnare opponents prepared to defend themselves in hand-to-hand combat around AD 370. They were also used by Tatars and are still used by the Sami people and Finns in reindeer herding. In Mongolia, a variant of the lasso called an uurga () is used, consisting of a rope loop at the end of a long pole. Lassoes are also mentioned in the Greek Histories of Herodotus; seventh book. Polymnia 7.85 records: \\"The wandering tribe known by the name of Sagartians- a people Persian in language, and in dress half Persian, half Pactyan, who furnished the army as many as eight thousand horse. It is not the wont of this people to carry arms, either of bronze or steel, except only a dirk; but they use lassoes made of thongs plaited together, and trust to these whenever they go to the wars. Now the manner in which they fight is the following: when they meet their enemy, straightway they discharge their lassoes, which end in a noose; then, whatever the noose encircles, be it man or be it horse, they drag towards them; and the foe, entangled in the toils, is forthwith slain. Such is the manner in which this people fight; and now their horsemen were drawn up with the Persians\\". Lasso is mentioned by some sources as one of the pieces of equipment of the Aswaran, the cavalry force of the Sasanian Empire. In the Americas, the method of roping cattle developed in Mexico as a way of managing and controlling individual animals (lassoing). The tool that was used was called a lariat. Furthermore, in order for this tool to be more productive, the Spanish war saddle evolved into the working saddle we know of today. Although a simple tool, many decades if not a century had to pass for this system to be perfected in Mexico. Before the lasso or lariat were successfully implemented in the Mexican style of work, the use of a hocking knife (crescent-shaped blade on a pole that was used to cut the ligaments in a cow's hocks) was used to stop and control the cattle. The hocking knife was similar to the Spanish spear (lanza) that was used to manipulate cattle as well as for combat.

In some jurisdictions, the term probation applies only to community sentences (alternatives to incarceration), such as suspended sentences. In others, probation also includes supervision of those conditionally released from prison on parole. An offender on probation is ordered to follow certain conditions set forth by the court, often under the supervision of a probation officer. During the period of probation, an offender faces the threat of being incarcerated if found breaking the rules set by the court or probation officer. Offenders are ordinarily required to maintain law-abiding behavior, and may be ordered to refrain from possession of firearms, remain employed or participate in an educational program, abide a curfew, live at a directed place, obey the orders of the probation officer, or not leave the jurisdiction. The probationer might be ordered as well to refrain from contact with the victims (such as a former partner in a domestic violence case), with potential victims of similar crimes (such as minors, if the instant offense involves child sexual abuse), or with known criminals, particularly co-defendants. Additionally, offenders can be subject to refrain from use or possession of alcohol and drugs and may be ordered to submit alcohol/drug tests or participate in alcohol/drug psychological treatment. Offenders on probation might be fitted with an electronic tag (or monitor), which signals their movement to officials. Some courts permit defendants of limited means to perform community service in order to pay off their probation fines.  History  The concept of probation, from the Latin, probatio, \\"testing\\", has historical roots in the practice of judicial reprieve. In English common law, prior to the advent of democratic rule, the courts could temporarily suspend the execution of a sentence to allow a criminal defendant to appeal to the monarch for a pardon. =United States= Probation first developed in the United States when John Augustus, a Boston cobbler, persuaded a judge in the Boston Police Court in 1841 to give him custody of a convicted offender, a \\"drunkard\\", for a brief period and then helped the man to appear rehabilitated by the time of sentencing. Even earlier, the practice of suspending a sentence was used as early as 1830 in Boston, Massachusetts, and became widespread in U.S. courts, although there was no statutory provision for such a practice. At first, judges, most notably Peter Oxenbridge Thatcher of Boston, used \\"release on recognizance\\" or bail and simply refrained from taking any further action. In 1878, the mayor of Boston hired a former police officer, the ironically named \\"Captain Savage\\", to become what many recognize as the first official probation officer. By the mid-19th century, however, many Federal Courts were using a judicial reprieve to suspend sentence, and this posed a legal question. In 1916, the United States Supreme Court, in the Killets Decision, held that a Federal Judge (Killets) was without power to suspend a sentence indefinitely. This decision led to the passing of the National Probation Act of 1925, thereby, allowing courts to suspend the imposition of incarceration and place an offender on probation. Probation developed from the efforts of a philanthropist, John Augustus, who looked for ways to rehabilitate the behavior of criminals. Massachusetts developed the first statewide probation system in 1878, and by 1920, 21 other states had followed suit. With the passage of the National Probation Act on March 5, 1925, signed by President Calvin Coolidge, the U.S. Federal Probation Service was established. On the state level, pursuant to the Crime Control and Consent Act of 1936, a group of states entered into an agreement wherein they would supervise probationers and parolees who reside in each other's jurisdictions on each other's behalf. Known as the Interstate Compact For the Supervision of Parolees and Probationers, this agreement was originally signed by 25 states in 1937. By 1951, all the states in the United States of America had a working probation system and ratified the Interstate Compact Agreement. In 1959, the new states of Alaska and Hawaii, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the territories of the Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa ratified the act as well.  Arming and increased authority  In the United States, most probation agencies have armed officers. In 39 states, territories and federal probation, such arming is either mandated or optional. Arming is allowed in an increasing number of jurisdictions. Probation officers are peace officers who possess limited police powers.  Types  Robert L. Patten Probation Detention Center in Lakeland, Georgia =Intensive= Home detention, GPS monitoring and computer management are highly intrusive forms of probation in which the offender is very closely monitored. It is common for violent criminals, higher-ranking gang members, habitual offenders, and sex offenders to be supervised at this level. Some jurisdictions require offenders under such supervision to waive their constitutional rights under the Fourth Amendment regarding search and seizure, and such probationers may be subject to unannounced home or workplace visits, surveillance, and the use of electronic monitoring or satellite tracking. Under terms of this kind of probation, a client may not change their living address and must stay at the address that is known to probation. GPS monitoring and home detention are common in juvenile cases, even if the underlying delinquency is minor. Some types of supervision may entail installing some form of monitoring software or conducting computer searches to ascertain what an offender is doing online. Cybercrime specialist in corrections, Art Bowker, noted ‚ÄúThis is an area more and more community corrections officers are going to have to get up to speed on, learning how to enforce conditions that restrict and/or monitor cyber offenders' computer and internet use.‚Äù Bowker, also observed \\"The use of social media is taking off in the field of community corrections\\". =Standard= Offenders under standard supervision are generally required to report to an officer, most commonly between biweekly and quarterly, and are subject to any other conditions as may have been ordered, such as alcohol/drug treatment, community service, and so on. =Unsupervised= Some probation does not involve direct supervision by an officer or probation department. The probationer is expected to complete any conditions of the order with no involvement of a probation officer, and perhaps within a period shorter than that of the sentence itself. For example, given one year of unsupervised probation, a probationer might be required to have completed community service and paid court costs or fines within the first six months. For the remaining six months, he or she may be required merely to refrain from unlawful behavior. Probationers are allowed to go to their workplaces, educational institutions, or places of worship. Such probationers may be asked to meet with an officer at the onset or near the end of the probationary period, or not at all. If terms are not completed, an officer may file a petition to revoke probation. =Informal= Informal probation may occur with deferred adjudication, without the defendant's having been convicted of a criminal offense, or may occur following a guilty plea pending the completion of terms set forth in a plea agreement. As with other forms of probation, terms may include drug testing or waiver of Fourth Amendment rights for the duration of the term of probation. At the end of the informal period, the case is typically dismissed. This is usually offered as part of a plea bargain or pre- trial diversion. =Shock= Some programs give a sentencing judge the power to reconsider an original jail sentence. The judge may recall the inmate from jail and put him or her on probation within the community instead. The courts have a theory that a short term in jail may ‚Äúshock‚Äù a criminal into changing their behavior. Shock probation can be used only between a specific period of 30‚Äì120 days after the original sentence, and is not available in all states.  Grant  Community corrections officials are key personnel in helping decide whether a criminal is granted probation. They determine whether the offender is a serious risk to public and recommend to the court what action to take. Correction officials first go through an investigation process during the pretrial period. They assess the offender's background and history to determine whether he or she can be released safely back into the community. The officers then write a report on the offender. The courts use the report to determine whether the offender shall be put on probation instead of going to jail. After the offender is found guilty, the probation officer puts together a pre-sentence investigation report (PSI). Courts base their sentencing on it. Finally, courts make their decisions as to whether to imprison the convict or to assign him or her probation. If a court decides to grant a person probation, they must then determine how to impose the sentence based on the seriousness of the crime, recidivism, the circumstances of the convict, and the recommendations from the corrections officials.  Violation  A probation officer may imprison a probationer and petition the court to find that the probationer committed a violation of probation. The court will request that the defendant appear at a show cause hearing at which the prosecutor must demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant committed a probation violation. If the defendant pleads guilty to a probation violation, or is found guilty of a probation violation after the hearing, the officer or prosecutor may request that additional conditions of probation be imposed, that the duration be extended, or that a period of incarceration be ordered, possibly followed by a return to probation. No law specifies when probation violation proceedings must be commenced, although probation violation proceedings are nearly certain to occur following the defendant's conviction of a subsequent offense or failure to report to the probation officer as ordered. If a violation is found, the severity of the penalties may depend upon the facts of the original offense, the facts of the violation, and the probationer's criminal history. For example, if an offender is on probation for a gang-related offense, subsequent \\"association with known criminals\\" may be viewed as a more serious violation than if the person were on probation for driving a car with a suspended license; the reverse may be true if the initial offense were for driving under the influence. Similarly, penalties for violation may be greater if a subsequent offense is of greater severity (such as a felony, following a misdemeanor), or if the original offense and subsequent offense are of the same type (such as a battery following an assault, or retail theft following retail theft).  Revocation  When a probation violation is extremely severe, or after multiple lesser violations, a probation revocation hearing could be scheduled. A judge at the hearing will consider reports from the probation officer, and if probation is revoked, the probationer will often be incarcerated in jail or prison. However, the term of incarceration might be reduced from the original potential sentence for the alleged crime(s). It is possible that an innocent defendant would choose to accept a deferred sentence rather than incur the risk of going to trial. In such a case, a probation revocation can result in conviction of the original criminal charges and a permanent record of conviction.

A fugitive (or runaway) is a person who is fleeing from custody, whether it be from jail, a government arrest, government or non-government questioning, vigilante violence, or outraged private individuals. A fugitive from justice, also known as a wanted person, can be a person who is either convicted or accused of a crime and hiding from law enforcement in the state or taking refuge in a different country in order to avoid arrest. A fugitive from justice alternatively has been defined as a person formally charged with a crime or a convicted criminal whose punishment has not yet been determined or fully served who is currently beyond the custody or control of the national or sub-national government or international criminal tribunal with an interest in his or her arrest. This latter definition adopts the perspective of the pursuing government or tribunal, recognizing that the charged (versus escaped) individual does not necessarily realize that they are officially a wanted person (e.g., due to a case of mistaken identity or reliance on a sealed indictment), and therefore may not be fleeing, hiding, or taking refuge to avoid arrest. The fugitive from justice is ‚Äòinternational‚Äô (versus ‚Äòdomestic‚Äô) if wanted by law enforcement authorities across a national border. Interpol is the international organization with no legal authority to directly pursue or detain fugitives of any kind. Europol is the European authority for the pursuit of fugitives who are on the run within Europe, and coordinates their search, while national authorities in the probable country of their stay coordinate their arrest. In the United States, the U.S. Marshals Service is the primary law enforcement agency that tracks down federal fugitives, though the Federal Bureau of Investigation also tracks fugitives. As a verbal metaphor and psychological concept, one might also be described as a \\"fugitive from oneself\\". Finally, the literary sense of \\"fugitive\\" includes the meaning of simply \\"fleeing\\". In many jurisdictions, a fugitive who flees custody while a trial is underway loses the right to appeal any convictions or sentences imposed on him, since the act of fleeing is deemed to flout the court's authority. Recently, convicted rapist Andrew Luster had his appeals denied on the basis that he spent six months as a fugitive (he was convicted in absentia).[ Supreme Court of the United States Docket for 03-854, Andrew Stuart v. California] December 11, 2003 Terminology While a person is being sought for potential arrest, the person may be described variously as being \\"at large\\" or as a \\"person of interest\\" to law enforcement. The latter term is frequently used in an \\"All- points bulletin\\" issued to other law enforcement persons or agencies. A person who has jumped bail after arraignment in court may be hunted or pursued by his bail bondsman, and a bounty may be \\"on his head.\\" The act of fleeing from the jurisdiction of a court is described colloquially as \\"fleeing justice\\" or \\"running from the Law.\\" A \\"wanted poster\\" may be issued, especially by the FBI, culminating in the \\"FBI's Most Wanted List\\" of fugitives. \\"On the lam\\" or \\"on the run\\" often refers to fugitives. Mencken's The American Language and The Thesaurus of American Slang proclaim that lam, lamister, and \\"on the lam\\"‚Äîall referring to a hasty departure‚Äîwere common in thieves' slang before the turn of the 20th century. Mencken quotes a newspaper report on the origin of 'lam' which actually traces it indirectly back to Shakespeare's time. Mencken also quotes a story from the New York Herald Tribune newspaper in 1938 which reported that \\"one of the oldest police officers in New York said that he had heard 'on the lam' thirty years ago.\\" Methods of finding fugitives Various methods can be used to find fugitives. Phone taps and pen registers can be used on relatives. Credit card and cell phone activities and electronic transfer of money can also be traced. Wanted posters and rewards can also be used. Jail records are also sometimes used; for instance, after the U.S. Government determined that Timothy McVeigh had perpetrated the Oklahoma City Bombing, he was found in a local jail. Other methods include using anonymous tips from members of the public who may have seen sight of the fugitive; CCTV and other modes of technology; news broadcasting of public awareness (depending on the severity of the crime the fugitive has committed), and co- operation with local law enforcement teams.

Luminol is a white-to- pale-yellow crystalline solid that is soluble in most polar organic solvents, but insoluble in water. Forensic investigators use luminol to detect trace amounts of blood at crime scenes, as it reacts with the iron in hemoglobin. Biologists use it in cellular assays to detect copper, iron, cyanides, as well as specific proteins via western blotting. When luminol is sprayed evenly across an area, trace amounts of an activating oxidant make the luminol emit a blue glow that can be seen in a darkened room. The glow only lasts about 30 seconds, but investigators can document the effect with a long-exposure photograph. Crime scene investigators must apply it evenly to avoid misleading results, as blood traces appear more concentrated in areas that receive more spray. The intensity of the glow does not indicate the amount of blood or other activator present, but only shows the distribution of trace amounts in the area. Synthesis Luminol is synthesized in a two-step process, beginning with 3-nitrophthalic acid.Synthesis of luminol First, hydrazine (N2H4) is heated with the 3-nitrophthalic acid in a high-boiling solvent such as triethylene glycol and glycerol. An acyl substitution condensation reaction occurs, with loss of water, forming 3-nitrophthalhydrazide. Reduction of the nitro group to an amino group with sodium dithionite (Na2S2O4), via a transient hydroxylamine intermediate, produces luminol. 500px The compound was first synthesized in Germany in 1902,See: * Aloys Josef Schmitz, \\"Ueber das Hydrazid der Trimesins√§ure und der Hemimelliths√§ure\\" (On the hydrazide of trimesic acid [1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid] and of hemimellitic acid [1,2,3-benzenetricarboxylic acid]), Inaugural Dissertation, Heidelberg University, 1902; pp. 17, 39‚Äì43. Schmitz calls luminol \\"1-amino-2,3-phtals√§urehydrazid\\". * Note: Gill states that luminol was prepared as early as 1853. See: Steven K. Gill (1983) \\"New developments in chemiluminescence research,\\" Aldrichimica Acta 16 (3) : 59‚Äì61; has footnote 2 on p. 60. Available at: Aldrichimica Acta . However, the sources Gill cites don't mention the preparation of luminol before 1902. Gill probably confused luminol with lophine (2,4,5-triphenyl-1H -imidazole), which the sources he cites do mention. Lophine is also chemiluminescent, and was first prepared in 1844 by Auguste Laurent. (See: Auguste Laurent (1844) \\"Sur un nouvel alcali organique, la lophine\\" (On a new organic alkali, lophine), Revue scientifique et industrielle, 18: 272‚Äì278.) The chemiluminescence of lophine was first observed by: Radziszewski, Bronis≈Çaw L. (1877) \\"Untersuchungen √ºber Hydrobenzamid, Amarin und Lophin\\" (Investigations of hydrobenzamide, amarine, and lophine), Berichte der Deutschen chemischen Gesellschaft zu Berlin, 10 : 70‚Äì75. In 1853, Ludwig Teichmann developed a test for blood, but it did not rely on chemiluminescence. See: L Teichmann (1853) \\"Ueber die Krystallisation der organischen Bestandtheile des Bluts\\" (On the crystallization of the organic components of blood), Zeitschrift f√ºr rationelle Medicin, new series, 3 : 375‚Äì388. but was not named \\"luminol\\" until 1934.See also: Ernest H. Huntress, Lester N. Stanley, and Almon S. Parker (March 1934) \\"The oxidation of 3-aminophthalhydrazide (\\"luminol\\") as a lecture demonstration of chemiluminescence,\\" Journal of Chemical Education, 11 (3) : 142‚Äì145. Chemiluminescence Chemiluminescence of luminol To exhibit its luminescence, the luminol must be activated with an oxidant. Usually, a solution containing hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and hydroxide ions in water is the activator. In the presence of a catalyst such as an iron or periodate compound, the hydrogen peroxide decomposes to form oxygen and water: :2 H2O2 ‚Üí + 2 H2O :H2O2 \\\\+ KIO4 ‚Üí KIO3 \\\\+ O2 \\\\+ H2O Laboratory settings often use potassium ferricyanide or potassium periodate for the catalyst. In the forensic detection of blood, the catalyst is the iron present in haemoglobin. Enzymes in a variety of biological systems may also catalyse the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide. Luminol reacts with the hydroxide ion, forming a dianion. The oxygen produced from the hydrogen peroxide then reacts with the luminol dianion. The product of this reaction, an organic peroxide, is very unstable and immediately decomposes with the loss of nitrogen to produce 5-aminophthalic acid with electrons in an excited state. As the excited state relaxes to the ground state, the excess energy is liberated as a photon visible as blue light. Reactions leading to the chemiluminescence of luminol. Use by crime scene investigators =History= In 1928, German chemist H. O. Albrecht found that blood, among other substances, enhanced the luminescence of luminol in an alkaline solution of hydrogen peroxide.H. O. Albrecht (1928) \\"√úber die Chemiluminescenz des Aminophthals√§urehydrazids\\" (On the chemiluminescence of aminophthalic acid hydrazide) Zeitschrift f√ºr Physikalische Chemie 136: 321‚Äì330.Stuart H. James and William G. Eckert, Interpretation of Bloodstain Evidence at Crime Scenes, 2nd ed. (Boca Raton, Florida: CRC Press LLC, 1998), page 154 . In 1936, Karl Gleu and Karl Pfannstiel confirmed this enhancement in the presence of haematin, a component of blood.Gleu, Karl ; Pfannstiel, Karl (1936) \\"√úber 3-aminophthalsaure- hydrazid\\" Journal f√ºr Praktische Chemie 146: 137‚Äì150. In 1937, German forensic scientist Walter Specht made extensive studies of luminol's application to the detection of blood at crime scenes.Specht, Walter (1937) \\"Die Chemiluminescenz des H√§mins, ein Hilfsmittel zur Auffindung und Erkennung forensisch wichtiger Blutspuren\\" (The chemiluminescence of haemin, an aid to the finding and recognition of forensically significant blood traces), Angewandte Chemie 50 (8): 155‚Äì157. In 1939, San Francisco pathologists Frederick Proescher and A. M. Moody made three important observations about luminol:Proescher F. and Moody A.M. (1939) \\"Detection of blood by means of chemiluminescence,\\" Journal of Laboratory and Clinical Medicine, 24 : 1183‚Äì1189. # although the test is presumptive, large areas of suspected material can be examined rapidly; # dried and decomposed blood gave a stronger and more lasting reaction than fresh blood; and # if the luminescence disappears, it may be reproduced by the application of a fresh luminol-hydrogen peroxide solution; dried bloodstains may thus be made luminescent repeatedly. =Theory= Crime scene investigators use luminol to find traces of blood, even if someone has cleaned or removed it. The investigator sprays a solution of luminol and the oxidant. The iron in blood catalyses the luminescence. The amount of catalyst necessary to cause the reaction is very small relative to the amount of luminol, allowing detection of even trace amounts of blood. The blue glow lasts for about 30 seconds per application. Detecting the glow requires a fairly dark room. Any glow detected may be documented by a long-exposure photograph. =Drawbacks= Luminol has drawbacks that can limit its use in a crime scene investigation: * Luminol chemiluminescence can also be triggered by a number of substances such as copper or copper-containing chemical compounds, and certain bleaches. As a result, if someone cleans a crime scene thoroughly with a bleach solution, residual cleaner makes the entire crime scene produce the typical blue glow, which effectively camouflages organic evidence such as blood. * Horseradish sauce, via the enzyme horseradish peroxidase, catalyses the oxidation of luminol, emitting light at 428 nm (blue in the visible spectrum), which may result in a false positive. * Luminol can detect the small amount of blood present in urine, and can be distorted if animals' urine is present in the room being tested. * Luminol reacts with faecal matter, causing the same glow as if it were blood. * Luminol's presence may prevent other tests from being performed on a piece of evidence. However, it has been shown that DNA can be successfully extracted from samples treated with luminol reagent.Technical note about Hemaglow * Excessive smoke in an enclosed space‚Äîe.g., a car that someone frequently smokes in‚Äîcan cause positive results with Luminol.

Life Habington was born at Hindlip Hall, Worcestershire, and belonged to a well-known Catholic family. His father, Sir Thomas Habington, an antiquary and historical scholar, had been implicated in the plots on behalf of Mary, Queen of Scots; his uncle, Sir Edward Habington, was beheaded in 1586 on the charge of conspiring against Elizabeth I in connection with Sir Anthony Babington; while to his mother, Mary Habington, was attributed the revelation of the Gunpowder Plot. The poet received his education in Paris and Saint-Omer. The information given by Anthony √† Wood in his Athenae that Habington returned to England \\"to escape the importunity of the Jesuits to join their order\\" rests only on a vague statement made by the ex-Catholic James Wadsworth in his English Spanish Pilgrim. He married about 1632 Lucy, second daughter of Sir William Herbert, 1st Baron Powis, the dedicatee of his first book of poems.

The heavily traveled spur route of I-80 runs from US 101 in San Rafael in the San Francisco Bay Area to I-5 near Tracy in the Central Valley. I-580 forms a concurrency with I-80 between Albany and Oakland, the latter of which is the location of the MacArthur Maze interchange immediately east of the San Francisco‚ÄìOakland Bay Bridge. I-580 provides a connection from the Bay Area to the southern San Joaquin Valley and Southern California via I-5, as I-5 bypasses the Bay Area to the east. A portion of I-580 is called the MacArthur Freeway, after General Douglas MacArthur. Other portions are named the John T. Knox Freeway (after a former California State Assemblyman and Speaker Pro Tempore who currently practices law at Nossaman LLP), the Eastshore Freeway (after its location on San Francisco Bay), the Arthur H. Breed Jr. Freeway (after a former California State Assemblyman and Senator‚Äîthe stretch itself lying between the cities of Castro Valley and Dublin), the William Elton \\"Brownie\\" Brown Freeway (after a Tracy resident instrumental in determining the route of Interstate 5 through the San Joaquin Valley), the Sgt. Daniel Sakai Memorial Highway (after the Castro Valley resident and Oakland SWAT officer killed in the 2009 shootings of Oakland police officers), and the John P. Miller Memorial Highway (after the Lodi resident and California Highway Patrol officer killed while chasing down a DUI driver). Route description I-580 emerging in the Central Valley near Tracy Eastbound I-580 at Grant Line Road about one mile away from the I-580/I-205 split. I-580 at Palomares Road at the west end of Dublin Canyon I-580 at the Altamont Pass Wind Farm Westbound I-580 at Altamont Pass between Livermore and Tracy. BART runs in the median of I-580 through Castro Valley I-580 on the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge The western terminus of I-580 is roughly 10 miles north of San Francisco in the city of San Rafael (Marin County), at the junction with U.S. Route 101 (US 101). The interchange with US 101 is incomplete, only allowing continuous travel from southbound US 101 to eastbound I-580 (via exit 451B) and from westbound I-580 to northbound US 101\\\\. Heading eastward through the light industrial portion of eastern San Rafael, I-580 provides access to San Quentin State Prison at the eastern tip of land before joining the Richmond‚ÄìSan Rafael Bridge to cross San Francisco Bay. I-580 enters the city of Richmond in Contra Costa County mid-span, then continues through Richmond to join Interstate 80 in Albany at the \\"Hoffman Split.\\" After joining I-80, I-580 runs directly south for several miles along the eastern shore of San Francisco Bay in the segment known as the Eastshore Freeway, then enters the MacArthur Maze. The segment between the Hoffman Split and the MacArthur Maze is a wrong-way concurrency, meaning I-580 east is signed as I-80 west, and vice versa. From the MacArthur Maze, I-580 is known as the MacArthur Freeway, which runs through Oakland and San Leandro to Castro Valley. About halfway to Castro Valley from the Maze, is an interchange with the Warren Freeway (State Route 13). Between this interchange and Castro Valley, I-580 runs near or along the trace of the Hayward Fault, a major branch of the San Andreas Fault. In Castro Valley, I-580 turns eastward toward Dublin Canyon before descending into Dublin and Pleasanton. After passing through Livermore, the freeway enters the Altamont Pass. The road emerges in the Central Valley west of Tracy, where, after I-205 splits near the Altamont Speedway, it turns southeastward and terminates by merging with I-5 south of Tracy just shy of the Stanislaus County line. I-580 through Altamont Pass is a major crossing of the Diablo Range linking the Central Valley to the Bay Area, and also a major route to Southern California. I-580 is the only freeway that crosses the Diablo Range, making it the safest route through the mountains. Prior to the construction of this route, traffic was detoured to Pacheco (SR 152) and Polonio (SR 46) passes. I-580 provides Interstate Highway access between San Francisco and Los Angeles since I-5 runs east of the Bay Area. However, the primary control city listed on freeway signs along eastbound I-580 between I-80 and I-205 is instead Stockton, a vestige of when this segment used to be part of US 50\\\\. I-580 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. The route is eligible for the State Scenic Highway System, and is officially designated as a scenic highway by the California Department of Transportation from the San Leandro city limits to SR 24 and from I-5 to I-205, meaning that these are substantial sections of highway passing through a \\"memorable landscape\\" with no \\"visual intrusions\\", where the potential designation has gained popular favor with the community. =Truck ban through Oakland= Trucks over 4.5 tons are prohibited through Oakland between Grand Avenue and the San Leandro border. Specifically, eastbound trucks cannot travel beyond Grand Avenue/Lakeshore Avenue (exit 21B), and those going westbound must get off at MacArthur Boulevard/Foothill Boulevard (exit 30). They are instead instructed to take I-238 in Castro Valley and then I-880 through Oakland as an alternative route. The truck prohibition has been in effect since the freeway was built in 1963 as part of US 50\\\\. Both the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) imposed the restriction, partly because the City of Oakland already had a truck ban through the area prior to the freeway's construction. Since then, the restriction was grandfathered in when the freeway was both renumbered and added to the Interstate Highway System. As a result, it is the only segment of Interstate Highway in California that is not part of the National Truck Network (several other California state highways have similar truck bans such as SR 2, SR 13 and SR 85, but not any other Interstates). With trucks normally rerouted onto I-880 instead of I-580 through Oakland, the former generally gets more traffic than the latter. For decades, the trucking industry lobbied to have the ban removed, but was unsuccessful due to local opposition. In 2000, the California State Legislature passed Assembly Bill 500, adding the I-580 truck restriction into the California Vehicle Code. The ban is temporarily lifted by the California Highway Patrol for short periods to reduce traffic congestion when major accidents occur on I-880 or I-238. =Express lanes= High-occupancy toll (HOT) lanes along I-580 between Pleasanton and Livermore opened in February 2016. The eastbound express lanes stretch between Hacienda Drive and North Greenville Road. The westbound express lanes extend an additional west to San Ramon Road/Foothill Road. All drivers are required to use a FasTrak transponder weekdays between 5 a.m. and 8 p.m. with all other traffic allowed to use the lanes free of charge during other hours. The new switchable FasTrak transponder (first used in the Metro ExpressLanes in the Los Angeles area), with a special switch that indicates the number of occupants (1, 2, or 3 or more) in the vehicle, is needed in some cases. History =I-5W and the San Francisco Bay Area= What is now I-580 from I-5 to Oakland was originally conceived as part of a loop Interstate with a directional suffix, I-5W. However, I-5W and most of the other Interstates around the country with directional suffixes were eventually renumbered or eliminated, except for I-35E and I-35W in Texas and Minnesota, and more recently Interstates 69W, 69C, and 69E in Texas. The former route of I-5W now corresponds to I-580 from I-5 to Oakland, I-80 from Oakland to Vacaville, and I-505 from Vacaville to I-5 near Dunnigan. =I-5 to Castro Valley= For the most part, the I-580 freeway in this segment was constructed over or alongside the right-of-way of US 50, previously part of the old Lincoln Highway, during the course of the late 1960s and early 1970s. The segment which begins at the split with I-205 was constructed during the same period of time over a new right-of-way to a junction with I-5, running through some low hills on the west side of the San Joaquin Valley near the city of Patterson. In the 1990s, the freeway segment from Castro Valley through Pleasanton was enlarged and otherwise re-engineered in conjunction with the construction of the Dublin/Pleasanton Line of the Bay Area Rapid Transit. The BART tracks were placed in a new median between the westbound and eastbound lanes of I-580 as was the new Dublin/Pleasantion Station. The interchange with I-238 and the Hayward exit ramps was also re- engineered at this time. =The MacArthur Freeway: Castro Valley to Oakland= The I-580 freeway in this segment was constructed starting in February 1960, adjacent to the city streets which were part of US 50 between Castro Valley and the large interchange along the eastern approach to the San Francisco‚ÄìOakland Bay Bridge in Oakland now called the MacArthur Maze. The freeway was named in honor of World War II General Douglas MacArthur. Prior to the construction of this freeway, the various city streets of Oakland that were designated for US 50 (principally 38th Street, Hopkins Street, Moss Avenue, Excelsior Avenue and part of Foothill Boulevard) had been re-named for the General as \\"MacArthur Boulevard\\" which, for the most part, still parallels the MacArthur Freeway. The re-naming occurred on March 26 1942, by a resolution of the Oakland City Council.[\\"Naming Our City Streets\\", Albert E. Norman, Oakland Tribune, October 23, 1960] The freeway was opened to traffic in 8 segments until its completion in May, 1966 (last segment, connecting with State Route 238 (now I-238), in Castro Valley, opened May 20, 1966).[California Highways and Public Works, March-April, pp.12-15] =Oakland to San Rafael= The segment of I-580 running from the MacArthur Maze to San Rafael is the most recent to be signed as I-580, beginning in 1984. Before 1984, this segment was part of State Route 17 (SR 17). From the Maze to the interchange locally known as the \\"Hoffman Split\\" in Albany, just north of the Gilman Street interchange (Hoffman Blvd. was the predecessor of I-580 in this section---see below), I-580 follows the Eastshore Freeway, a wrong-way concurrency with I-80 for its entirety: northward on the Eastshore is signed I-80 east and I-580 west; headed southward, one finds signs indicating I-80 west and I-580 east. At the Hoffman Split, I-580 leaves the Eastshore Freeway in a northwesterly direction through the cities of Albany and Richmond. It then crosses San Francisco Bay over the Richmond‚ÄìSan Rafael Bridge. The freeway in this section, officially named the John T. Knox Freeway, was constructed from 1987 to 1991. It replaced a number of city streets which comprised the earlier highway leading to the San Rafael Bridge, principally, Hoffman and Cutting Boulevards. After crossing the bridge, I-580 runs west to San Rafael, ending at an interchange with US 101\\\\. This freeway segment supplanted an earlier boulevard constructed as part of SR 17\\\\. =Interstate 180= Interstate 180 was a temporary designation used in 1978 for the Richmond‚ÄìSan Rafael Bridge, now part of I-580. At the time the bridge had been identified as part of SR 17 but was marked for inclusion in the Interstate Highway System. Briefly the bridge used the number 180, despite the Fresno- area SR 180's use of the number. The California Streets and Highways Code has a policy against using one route number for multiple noncontiguous highways. Unless the existing SR 180 is renumbered, which is unlikely due to its familiarity as the road to Kings Canyon National Park, there will not be an I-180 in California. Future The segment of I-580 from I-680 to I-205 is undergoing significant expansion. Among the projects along this segment is the now-completed high-occupancy vehicle lanes in each direction, a westbound auxiliary lane between Fallon Road and Tassajara Road, the now-completed construction of a new interchange at Isabel Avenue in Livermore, the reconstruction of several interchanges, the construction of additional truck climbing lanes for the eastward ascent to the Altamont Pass, and plans to preserve the right-of-way to accommodate a future BART extension in the median of the freeway. Exit list In popular culture * I-580 features prominently throughout the Sons of Anarchy series. The backstory of the series establishes that \\"First 9\\" (SAMCRO co-founder) John Teller died in a collision on November 13, 1993, 15 years before the pilot episode takes place, and SAMCRO establishes a roadside memorial to Teller near the crash site. In the final scenes of the series finale, Jax rides his father's restored classic motorcycle to visit that memorial, before taking a last ride on I-580. * I-580 through the Altamont Pass is a stage in the 2011 racing video game Need for Speed: The Run.
