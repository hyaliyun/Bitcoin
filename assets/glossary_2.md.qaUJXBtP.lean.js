Founded in 1898, the OU supports a network of synagogues, youth programs, Jewish and Religious Zionist advocacy programs, programs for the disabled, localized religious study programs, and international units with locations in Israel and formerly in Ukraine. The OU maintains a kosher certification service, whose circled-U hechsher symbol, ‚ìä, is found on the labels of many kosher commercial and consumer food products. Its synagogues and their rabbis typically identify themselves with Modern Orthodox Judaism. History= Foundation  The Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America was founded as a lay synagogue federation in 1898 by Rabbi Henry Pereira Mendes. Its founding members were predominately modern, Western-educated Orthodox rabbis and lay leaders, of whom several were affiliated with the Jewish Theological Seminary (JTS), which originated as Orthodox institution to combat the hegemony of the Reform movement.Jonathan D. Sarna, American Judaism: A History. Yale University Press, 2019. pp. 188-192. Cracks between the OU and JTS first formed in 1913, when Solomon Schechter decided all alumni of the institution will be allowed to apply for managerial positions in the newly created United Synagogue of America (then a non- denominational communal organization), though his close ally Frederick de Sola Mendes advocated that only strictly pious ones should be so approved. Only at that time did Mendes begin to distinguish between \\"Conservative\\" and \\"Modern Orthodox\\" Judaism in his diary, though he could not articulate the difference.Michael R. Cohen, The Birth of Conservative Judaism: Solomon Schechter's Disciples and the Creation of an American Religious Movement. Columbia University Press, 2012. pp. 54-56. The OU, JTS and RIETS were closely connected, with an alumnus of the latter two serving in the former's communities, until the postwar era. Only around 1950 did Conservative and Modern Orthodox Judaism fully coalesce as opposing movements.Cohen, pp. 137-140, 157. Development During the early decades of its existence, the Orthodox Union was closely associated with and was a supporter of the development of Yeshiva University into a major Jewish educational institution producing English-speaking, university-trained American rabbis for the pulpits of OU synagogues. Some Orthodox rabbis viewed the nascent OU and the rabbis of its synagogues as too \\"modern\\" in outlook, and thus did not participate in it, instead setting up their own more stringent rabbinical organizations. Nevertheless, the idea for a national Orthodox congregational body took hold. The OU was soon acknowledged within the American Jewish establishment as the main, but not exclusive mouthpiece for the American Orthodox community. Representatives of 150 Orthodox congregations, with an estimated membership of 50,000, participated in the OU's 1919 national convention. The OU became more active in broader American Jewish policy issues after 1924, when Rabbi Dr. Herbert S. Goldstein, the innovative spiritual leader of the West Side Institutional Synagogue of Manhattan became the president of the OU. Under Goldstein, the OU and its Rabbinical Council, became a founding member of the Synagogue Council of America, along with representatives of the Reform and Conservative movements and their rabbinic affiliates. The OU played an active role in advocating for public policies important to Orthodox practice, such as advocating for the five-day work week and defending the right to kosher slaughter. It was also involved in efforts to serve the religious needs of American Jewish soldiers as well as relief for European Jewry. =Kashrut= In the 1920s the OU started its kashrut division, establishing the concept of community-sponsored, not-for-profit kashrut supervision. In 1923, the H. J. Heinz Company's vegetarian beans became the first product to be kosher certified by the OU. The OU's kashrut program was heavily influenced by Abraham Goldstein, a chemist who used his knowledge of food science to determine the kosher status of various products. In 1935, Goldstein left the OU and started his own organization, Organized Kashruth Laboratories (OK). The wide acceptance of OU kashrut supervision rested largely upon the outstanding reputation of its rabbinic administrator, Rabbi Alexander S. Rosenberg. He and his staff established effective kashrut supervision standards for modern food production technology which made possible the explosion in the availability of OU certified packaged kosher products across the US since the 1950s. By the mid-1930s, the OU kashrut division had matured enough to influence and challenge the traditional local rabbinic \\"sole practitioner\\" kashrut supervision model. At the time, kashrut was a profitable business for rabbis; the OU sought to make kashrut freely available, to reduce the consumer cost of keeping kosher. =Mid-century= The OU Women's Branch was also organized during the 1920s to encourage the formation and support of active sisterhoods in OU synagogues. Women's Branch took on a number of special products, typically related to women's Jewish education and support for Yeshiva University. OU operations became more efficient with the appointment in 1939 of Leo S. Hilsenrad as its first full-time professional executive director. Its services were further expanded in 1946, with the addition of Saul Bernstein to the professional staff. Bernstein became the founding editor, in 1951, of Jewish Life, the OU's popular publication for Orthodox laymen. Bernstein also succeeded Hilsenrad as the OU's administrator. During the postwar years, there was considerable overlap in the lay leadership of the Orthodox Union and Yeshiva University. The Orthodox Union expanded its operations following the election in 1954 of Moses I. Feuerstein as its president. Its leadership ranks were augmented by a talented group of lay leaders including Joseph Karasick, Harold M. Jacobs and Julius Berman, who would guide the OU's growth over the next several decades. Another major development was the appointment, in 1959, of Rabbi Pinchas Stolper as director of the Orthodox Union's youth group, the National Conference of Synagogue Youth (NCSY). By inspiring thousands of public-school educated high school youth across North America to become more observant, NCSY played a major role in launching the baal teshuva movement, a widespread spiritual re-awakening among Jewish youth which followed the 1967 Six-Day War. OU's board of directors has had female members since the mid-1970s. By the mid- to late-20th century, most synagogues affiliated with the Orthodox Union were under the leadership of rabbis trained by Rabbi Joseph Soloveitchik at Yeshiva University's Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary. These rabbis were ideologically Modern Orthodox. By the 1990s and early 21st century, the OU's general philosophy and levels of observance may be seen to have shifted towards stricter interpretations and halachic practices. This change has not necessarily affected individual member congregations, but has impacted many Orthodox Jewish communities across America. The general trend toward stricter practices among Orthodox Union congregations reflects American Orthodoxy's trending toward Haredi Judaism. =21st century= In 2009, Rabbi Steven Weil succeeded Rabbi Tzvi Hersh Weinreb as the OU's Executive Vice President, and was succeeded by Allen Fagin in April 2014. In 2011 Rabbi Simcha Katz became president, and was succeeded by Moishe Bane in January 2017. In 2014, the first women were elected as national officers of the OU; specifically, three female national vice presidents and two female associate vice presidents were elected. In 2017, the OU adopted as formal policy the normative Orthodox position that clergy is only for men. It precludes women from holding titles such as \\"rabbi\\", or from functioning as clergy in its congregations in the United States. Activities=Alliance with the Rabbinical Council of America For many years the OU, along with its related rabbinic arm, the Rabbinical Council of America, worked with the larger Jewish community in the Synagogue Council of America. In this group Orthodox, Conservative and Reform groups worked together on many issues of joint concern. The group became defunct in 1994, mainly over the objections of the Orthodox groups to Reform Judaism's official acceptance of patrilineal descent as an option for defining Jewishness. (See Who is a Jew.) Kosher certification The Orthodox Union's Kosher Division headed by CEO Menachem Genack, is the world's largest kosher certification agency. As of 2017, it supervises more than 800,000 products in 8,500 plants in 100 different countries. 200,000 of those products are found in the US. It employs 886 rabbinic field representatives, mashgichim in Hebrew, and about 50 rabbinic coordinators who serve as account executives for OU-certified companies; they are supplemented by a roster of ingredient specialists, flavor analysts, and other support staff. The supervision process involves sending a mashgiach to the production facility to ensure that the product complies with Jewish law. The mashgiach supervises both the ingredients and the production process. National Conference of Synagogue Youth  The international youth movement of the OU, the National Conference of Synagogue Youth (NCSY), was founded in the early 1950s. After a few false starts, NCSY first achieved success under Rabbi Pinchas Stolper by reaching out to public school educated Jewish youth with a message of Orthodox Jewish religious inspiration. It has now expanded its reach to include many already religious mostly Modern Orthodox children attending Jewish day schools.  Orthodox Union Advocacy Center  The OU Advocacy Center is the non-partisan public policy arm of the OU, leading the organization's advocacy efforts in Washington, D.C., and state capitals. Formerly known as the Institute for Public Affairs, OU Advocacy engages leaders at all levels of government as well as the broader public to promote and protect the Orthodox Jewish community's interests and values in the public policy arena. Synagogue affiliation The OU requires that all member synagogues follow Orthodox Jewish interpretations of Jewish law and tradition. Men and women are seated separately, and nearly always are separated by a mechitza, a physical divider between the men's and women's section of the synagogue. Many OU synagogues support the concepts of Religious Zionism, which teaches that the existence of the State of Israel is a step towards the arrival of the Messiah and the eventual return of all Jews around the world to live in the ancient national Jewish homeland. The laws of Shabbat and kashrut are stressed. They pray in Hebrew, using the same traditional text of the siddur that has been used in Ashkenazi and Sephardi Jewish communities for the last few centuries. Until the 1980s, the most popular English translation of the prayer book used in OU synagogues had been Ha-Siddur Ha-Shalem edited by Philip Birnbaum. In recent years the most popular translated siddurim have been the Rabbinical Council of America edition of the Artscroll siddur and the Koren Siddur. Similarly, the most common Hebrew-English Chumash used had been the Pentateuch and Haftarahs, edited by Rabbi Joseph H. Hertz; in recent years this has been supplanted by The Chumash: The Stone Edition, also known as the Artscroll Chumash.commonly called The Stone Chumash  Yachad  Yachad: The National Jewish Council for Disabilities, is a global organization dedicated to address the needs of Jewish individuals with disabilities and ensuring their inclusion in every aspect of Jewish life. The inclusive design aims to ensure that persons with diverse abilities have their rightful place within the Jewish community, while it helps to educate and advocate in the Jewish world for greater understanding, acceptance, outreach, and a positive attitude towards disabled persons.  Controversy = Baruch Lanner abuse scandal  The OU has been accused of ignoring multiple reports of child abuse when appointing Rabbi Baruch Lanner as Director of Regions of its National Conference of Synagogue Youth movement. Lanner was ultimately convicted of multiple counts of sexual abuse and imprisoned. In response to the scandal, the OU implemented several new initiatives to better protect children under their care. Shechita supervision  In 2005, an undercover video purportedly showed cruel treatment of animals in an OU-certified slaughterhouse. The story was featured many times in national newspapers and in Jewish media. The OU defended its limited scope of supervision, while studying changes to its policy. In 2006, the OU's response was the subject of a video narrated by Jonathan Safran Foer, Irving Greenberg, and David Wolpe.  Agriprocessor, Inc.  In May 2008, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, together with other Federal agencies, raided a kosher slaughterhouse and meat packing plant in Postville, Iowa, owned by Agriprocessors, Inc. At the time the OU provided kosher certification services to the plant. The raid was the largest single raid of a workplace in U.S. history and resulted in nearly 400 arrests of immigrant workers with false identity papers, many of whom were charged with identity theft, document fraud, use of stolen social security numbers, and related offenses. Some 300 workers were convicted on document fraud charges within four days. The majority served a five-month prison sentence before being deported. The OU had numerous rabbis working on premises, yet none reported child workers working illegally at the plant or the abusive conditions workers faced on site.  Jeff Sessions speech  In June 2018, Attorney General Jeff Sessions spoke at the OU Advocacy Center's annual conference in Washington, where he was presented with an artistic rendering of the biblical command ‚ÄúJustice, justice shalt thou pursue.‚Äù Given Sessions' policies, particularly those concerning immigrants and asylum seekers, the OU came under criticism for hosting him and presenting him with the plaque.

H., 1919, The War with Mexico, New York: Macmillan ChurubuscoSmith, J. H., 1919, The War with Mexico, New York:Macmillan The Battle of Churubusco took place on August 20, 1847, while Santa Anna's army was in retreat from the Battle of Contreras or Battle of Padierna during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. It was the battle where the San Patricio Battalion, made up largely of American deserters, made their last stand against U.S. forces. The U.S. Army was victorious, outnumbering more than two-to-one the defending Mexican troops. After the battle, the U.S. Army was only 5 miles (8 km) away from Mexico City. About 50 of the captured San Patricio's were later hanged. Background Following their defeats at Contreras Antonio de Padua Mar√≠a Severino L√≥pez de Santa Anna y P√©rez de Lebr√≥n ordered Major General Nicol√°s Bravo Rueda with the Army of the Center to retreat from San Antonio to Churubusco.Bauer, K.J., 1974, The Mexican War, 1846-1848, New York:Macmillan, Santa Anna also ordered Major General Manuel Rinc√≥n to hold the Franciscan Convent of San Mateo in Churubusco, with earthworks and seven guns, and placed General Francisco P√©rez at the t√™te de pont on the south bank of the river. Two regiments were placed along the river while the convent included the Bravo Battalions of the Mexico City National Guard and the San Patricio Battalion, plus Santa Anna formed a reserve along the highway to the north. Battle Scott sent David Twiggs and Gideon Johnson Pillow's Divisions from San Angel to Coyoac√°n, while he ordered William Jenkins Worth to turn the San Antonio position. Worth sent Colonel Newman S. Clarke's Brigade and Lieutenant Colonel Charles Ferguson Smith's Light Battalion across the Pedregal lava field to the west of San Antonio, while Colonel John Garland faced San Antonio on the south. During retreat from San Antonio, the Mexican defenders (part of the 1st Line of Defense (or sometimes the \\"Army of the Center\\") with Colonel F. Villarreal and about 2,000 men: 700 of the \\"Hidalgo,\\" 500 of the \\"Victoria\\" (Lieutenant Colonel P. Jorrin) National Guards Battalions, and 800 others: under Colonels A. Zerecero and J. G. Perdig√≥n Garay), were struck in flank by Clarke's Brigade. Garland moved forward as the Mexicans withdrew from San Antonio and captured a General and four guns. Scott ordered an attack on the convent. In addition to the stone walls of the convent, the defenses included a series of incomplete trenches the Mexicans had begun digging prior to the attack.Ramsey (1850), pp. 292 Some elements of the Tlapa and Lagos Battalions arrived as reinforcements. Three cannon were placed on the right; two in the center; and the remaining two on the left. Independencia was assigned to defend the upper walls, the right flank leading to the bridge, the unfortified south and north sides, and two adobe huts further forward on the battlefield. The Bravos and the San Patricios were stationed on the left, behind barricades. In support along the Rio Churubusco was the P√©rez Brigade: 2,500 men (11th Line, 1st, 3d & 4th Light Infantry Regiments). Worth's division took on the t√™te de pont, while Twiggs' the convent. Rinc√≥n's gunners were able to force Taylor's battery to withdraw, and Perez's defense on the t√™te de pont twice repulsed Major Benjamin Louis Eulalie de Bonneville's 6th Infantry charge. The attack by Franklin Pierce and James Shields, crossing the river on the Coyoacan-Mixcoac road in an attempt to cut off the Mexican retreat, was also stopped. However, Worth turned the Mexican left and crossed the river, while the 8th and 5th Infantry took the t√™te de pont. Captain Duncan then set up a battery to attack the convent. Two of the Mexican cannons had melted and a third had fallen from its mount. Lieutenant Colonel Francisco Pe√±√∫√±uri of Independencia led a handful of men in a bayonet charge and was defeated. He and Captain Luis Mart√≠nez de Castro, who had accompanied him, were killed in the battle. Officers from the Bravos attempted to raise the white flag over the convent walls on three occasions. They were prevented from doing so, however, by members of the San Patricios, who feared the fate that awaited them if they were taken prisoner.Pam Nordstrom, \\"SAN PATRICIO BATTALION,\\" Handbook of Texas Online , accessed March 11, 2012. Published by the Texas State Historical Association. They were ultimately captured and court-martialed for desertion, including the leader, John Patrick Riley. U.S. Captain James Milton Smith finally stopped the fighting by putting up a white handkerchief. Aftermath The Americans captured 192 prisoners and three pieces of artillery at the t√™te de pont. They captured 1,259 prisoners, including three Generals and the San Patricios leader Lieutenant Colonel Francisco Rosenda Moreno, plus seven pieces of artillery at the convent. They captured another 380 prisoners further up the road. Seventy-two men of the San Patricios Battalion were court-martialed by the United States Army as deserters. Two separate courts martial were held, one at Tacubaya on 23 August, and another at San √Ångel on 26 August. Fifty were sentenced to hang, having deserted after war had been declared. Those who had deserted earlier received 50 lashes. (See Saint Patrick's Battalion for a more complete description.) When General Anaya was asked by General Twiggs to surrender his ammunition after the end of the battle, he replied, \\"If I had any ammunition, you would not be here\\". Scott did not continue the pursuit into Mexico City, \\"...willing to leave something to this republic... I halted our victorious corps at the gates of the city.\\" A Brigade of volunteers from New York was billeted to the convent, remaining there until September 7.

Grand Jury Charges, Introduction, \\"United States of America v. Mary Sue Hubbard\\", United States District Court for the District of Columbia, 1979. Operation Snow White was a criminal conspiracy by the Church of Scientology during the 1970s to purge unfavorable records about Scientology and its founder, L. Ron Hubbard. This project included a series of infiltrations into and thefts from 136 government agencies, foreign embassies and consulates, as well as private organizations critical of Scientology, carried out by Church members in more than 30 countries. It was one of the largest infiltrations of the United States government in history, with up to 5,000 covert agents. This operation also exposed the Scientology plot 'Operation Freakout', because Operation Snow White was the case that initiated the U.S. government's investigation of the Church. Under this program, Scientology operatives committed infiltration, wiretapping, and theft of documents in government offices, most notably those of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. Eleven highly placed Church executives, including Mary Sue Hubbard (wife of founder L. Ron Hubbard and second-in- command of the organization), pleaded guilty and were convicted in federal court of obstructing justice, burglary of government offices, and theft of documents and government property. The case was United States v. Mary Sue Hubbard et al., 493 F.Supp. 209 (D.D.C. 1979).wikisource:U.S. v. Hubbard 650 F.2d 293 (1981) Background As early as 1960, L. Ron Hubbard had proposed that Scientologists should infiltrate government departments by taking secretarial, bodyguard or other jobs. In the early 1970s, the Church of Scientology was increasingly scrutinized by US federal agencies, having already been raided by the Food and Drug Administration in 1963. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) claimed the Church owed millions of dollars in taxes and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) sent agents into the organization. The Church's response involved a publicity campaign, extensive litigation against the IRS and a program of infiltration of agency offices. The specific branch of Scientology responsible for Operation Snow White was the Guardian's Office. Created in 1966 by L. Ron Hubbard, the purpose of the Guardian's Office was to protect the interests of Scientology. At the time of Operation Snow White, the Guardian's Office had its worldwide headquarters (Guardian's Office WW) located at Saint Hill Manor in England. Headquarters in the United States (Guardian's Office US) were in Los Angeles, California, though smaller offices existed in Washington, D.C. (Guardian's Office DC) and other cities throughout the United States. Each Guardian Office consisted of five bureaus. One such bureau was the Information Bureau, which oversaw the infiltration of the government. L. Ron Hubbard oversaw the Guardian's Office, though it was Mary Sue Hubbard, his wife, who held the title Commodore Staff Guardian. Several years later, in 1973, the Guardian's Office began a massive infiltration of governments around the world, though the primary target of the operation was the United States. Worried about Scientology's long-term reputation, the Guardian's Office decided to infiltrate Interpol to obtain documents related to Scientology, as well as those connecting L. Ron Hubbard to criminal activity. Jane Kember handed this duty to Henning Heldt and his staff. Around this time L. Ron Hubbard himself wrote Guardian Order 732, which called for the removal and correction of \\"erroneous\\" Scientology files. It is here that Operation Snow White has its origins. Though the order called for this to be achieved by legal means, this would quickly change. Hubbard himself would later be named by federal prosecutors as an \\"unindicted co-conspirator\\" for his part in the operation. Though extensive records of his involvement exist, many Scientologists claim his directives were misinterpreted by his followers. Operation Snow White would be further refined by Guardian Order 1361. Addressed from Jane Kember to Heldt, Duke Snider, and Richard Weigand, GO 1361 called for, among other things, an infiltration of the Los Angeles and London offices of the IRS, and the Department of Justice. While the order was specific to the IRS, the Guardian's Office was soon recruiting their own field agents to infiltrate other governmental offices, including the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the U.S. Coast Guard intelligence service, and the National Institute of Mental Health, among others, as well as the American Medical Association.\\"Dianetic Sect Said to Spy on AMA; Criticized Over Dianetics.\\" New York Times.

One of the sentencing memoranda in the case also noted that, contrary to what the defendants claimed, the programs planned by the Guardian's Office were not restricted to trying to remove \\"false reports\\" but included plans to plant false information‚Äîfor instance, planting false records about \\"a cat with a pedigree name\\" into US security agency computers so that later \\"the creature holds a press conference and photographic story results.\\" The purpose of Operation Cat was \\"to hold up the American security to ridicule, as outlined in the GO by LRH.\\"Sentencing Memorandum in Criminal No. 78-401(2)&(3): UNITED STATES OF AMERICA v.

Meisner's supervisor at this time was Duke Snider, the Assistant Guardian for DC, or AG DC. This was the highest position in Washington's GO office. In July 1974, Meisner was ordered by Duke Snider to implement the previously written plan to obtain Interpol documents, which were then located in the U.S. Department of the Treasury. Meisner had more to do than just this, though, as by August he was also taking directions from Cindy Raymond, the GO's Collections Officer for the US, who ordered Meisner to assist her in finding a loyal Scientologist agent to gain employment at the IRS headquarters in Washington DC. This employee was to steal all documents dealing with Scientology, especially those involving current litigation by Scientology against the government. Meisner discussed this with Raymond for a period of a month before interviewing various Scientologists with no luck. A month after the order had been given, Raymond informed Meisner that she had selected Gerald Bennett Wolfe. Implementation The GO's actual infiltration of the government likely began when Gerald Wolfe and Michael Meisner were able to gain employment at the IRS as clerk-typists. Under direction of the Guardian Office, Wolfe monitored files on tax-exempt organizations and, when requested, illegally made copies for Scientology. Meisner supervised both Wolfe and the Information Bureau section in DC, and reported to the GO's Deputy Guardian for Information in the US. In November 1974, Operation Snow White took an unexpected turn for the GO when they received word that the IRS would be conducting a meeting on Scientology's tax-exempt status. In response, the church sent a spy to bug the room.\\"Documents Made Public in Case of Infiltration by Scientologists; Documents Give First Details 8 Plead to Conspiracy.\\" New York Times October 26, 1979. On the morning of November 1, the day before the meeting, a GO agent, Hermann, broke into the conference room and plugged the device into an electrical outlet. This device, in turn, then transmitted a signal on an FM frequency, which was picked up and recorded by Scientologists sitting in a car in the parking lot of the Smithsonian, which faced the office. After the meeting Hermann removed the device, and the taped recording of the meeting was sent to Los Angeles. By December, Wolfe, Herman, and Meisner had sent a shipment of stolen documents 20 inches thick to Duke Snider. Snider, in turn, sent notification to Mo Budlong in Los Angeles. By the end of December, Wolfe was stealing documents from the IRS's Chief Counsel's office. Just days after Christmas, Wolfe broke into the office of Barbara Bird, an attorney in the IRS's Refund Litigation Service. Bird had been present at the November 1st meeting. Instead of stealing files, Wolfe took them to a copier and made photocopies using government paper. Later, Wolfe met Meisner at a restaurant, where he reported on his most recent theft. Meisner took the documents and underlined selections that he believed his superiors would find interesting or relevant and wrote a summary of the important points. This was then routed through the Assistant Guardian for DC and on to the Deputy Guardian for the US, the Deputy Guardian for Information in the US, the Branch I Director of the Information Bureau, and the Collections Officer, all of which were in Los Angeles. A copy was also sent to Mary Sue Hubbard. This was typically standard procedure for Meisner. In early 1975, Operation Snow White expanded again as Sharon Thomas found employment in the U.S. Coast Guard Intelligence Agency and Nancy Douglass began work at the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). Douglass stole documents and made photocopies of others. These were transmitted to Hermann. By spring, attention had been called back to the IRS case as Mary Sue Hubbard had instructed Kember and Heldt to \\"use any method at our disposal to win the battle and gain our non-profit (tax) status\\". Heldt wrote back telling that her request had been sent to the Information Bureau, who had been ordered to complete the collection of documents from the IRS and the Department of Justice's tax files within three months. In April, Meisner procured a directory of the Department of Justice and located the offices that would have files pertaining to Scientology litigation. When he found what he wanted he sent in Wolfe, who broke into the offices of two attorneys on three successive Saturdays. Wolfe copied twelve files and met up with Meisner, as before, at a restaurant. These files were especially useful to Scientology, as it detailed the government's strategy in various court cases. In May, Willardson directed Meisner to implement \\"Project Horn\\", which called for Meisner to \\"provide a cover for PR and legal for the way they obtained IRS docs\\". The idea would be for the GO's Public Relations Bureau to view the documents without worrying about being connected to the theft. Willardson's idea called for Meisner to steal documents dealing with organizations other than Scientology. Willardson also called for the theft of IRS stationery, in order to forge letters from a (fictional) disgruntled IRS employee. The files on various organizations (including Scientology, of course) would then be sent out attached to the fake letter. The idea was that it would appear that an upset IRS agent had himself sent the files to numerous organizations. There would be nothing to tie it to Scientology. Wolfe stole both the stationery and, without permission, files on the Unification Church and Bob Jones University. During the summer and fall months of 1975, the GO launched an additional plan. In July, Meisner was told by Cindy Raymond that the Church of Scientology had initiated a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit against the IRS. Meisner was directed to add the office of Charles Zuravin to his list of offices to monitor. Zuravin was representing the government in the case. Meisner immediately passed this duty on to Wolfe, who broke into Zuravin's office multiple times between July and November. Wolfe revealed to his superiors that Zuravin was preparing an index of Scientology files relevant to the FOIA case. IRS offices from all over the country were sending files to Zuravin. This index file, required by the courts in all FOIA cases, is a total list of the documents requested, and reasons for their exemption from the public, if any. By October, Zuravin had finished the index, numbering each document in order to simplify location, and had provided a copy to Scientology attorneys. These attorneys, in turn, gave the index to Raymond, who passed it along to Meisner, who passed it to Wolfe. Wolfe then entered Zuravin's office and then began copying the documents listed on the index. Zuravin had essentially done the GO's job for them. On December 5, 1975, Jane Kember issued Guardian Program Order 158, which intended to give L. Ron Hubbard early warning of impending legal action. The plan called for the infiltration of the government agencies that had either the power to issue, or the knowledge of, impending subpoenas. Specific agencies include the US Attorney's Office in DC and LA, the IRS Office of International Operations, the DEA, and the Coast Guard and Immigration and Naturalization. After reviewing the letter, Meisner concluded it would be a better idea to infiltrate the Department of Justice than the US Attorney's Office. In January 1976, Hermann, the Southeast US Secretary for the Information Bureau, informed Meisner that Heldt and Weigand had approved a plan to send Alverzo to Washington. Alverzo arrived on the 17th, and on the 18th he picked the locks on the doors belonging to the office of Lewis Hubbard (no relation to L. Ron Hubbard) and the file room housing Zuravin's files. Wolfe stood guard at the end of the hallway while Alverzo worked on Hubbard's door. A few doors down Meisner worked on Zuravin's door. After an hour and a half with no success, Meisner was getting upset. In frustration, Meisner hit the top of Zuravin's door, which popped right open. The three Scientologists entered the office and took the remaining Scientology related documents. They then traveled to another floor where they made photocopies. Wolfe continued to make copies while Alverzo and Meisner tried again to open Hubbard's office. The trio then worked well into the night photocopying files from Hubbard's office. When they left, sometime around 2 AM, they left with a foot tall stack of documents. Less than a month later Richard Weigand wrote to Jane Kember, telling her that the IRS documents that had been ordered to be produced in Guardian Order 1361, over two years earlier, had been obtained. Gerald Wolfe, along with Meisner, were later able to break into a room and make false IRS identification cards, which allowed them access to the federal courthouse in Washington. Wolfe and Meisner then used these cards to gain access to restricted areas and steal more documents. While Wolfe and Meisner continued their work at the IRS, Mary Sue Hubbard, along with other Guardian Office members, were coming up with further plans. Guardian Program Order 302, written by Cindy Raymond and approved by Hubbard, amongst others, directed the infiltration of all government agencies that had withheld files from Scientology's various FOIA requests. On the night of April 14, Meisner and Wolfe were on the tenth floor of the IRS building housing the Office of International Operations. Trying to enter an office, the pair found it locked. A passing cleaning lady noted Meisner and Wolfe's suspicious behavior, and notified a security guard. The guard confronted the pair and was presented with Wolfe's genuine IRS card and Meisner's fabricated one. Satisfied, the guard had the cleaning lady open the door. Inside, the pair grabbed a hefty load of files. Unable to find a photocopier, the pair then took the files to the main IRS building, where the pair again used their identification to gain access. After copying the files, they returned them to Crate's office. The entire process took some four hours. In May, Wolfe broke into the United States Courthouse and stole keys to the office of Assistant United States Attorney Nathan Dodell. Wolfe then took these keys to have them duplicated, and returned them unnoticed. Almost three weeks later, Wolfe and Meisner broke into Dodell's office, stealing documents and, as usual, forwarding them to Guardian headquarters in Los Angeles. The GO's interest in Nathan Dodell stemmed from a Scientology FOIA case. In April, Judge George L Hart asked Dodell whether the US had considered taking a deposition of L. Ron Hubbard. Dodell responded that it was an \\"interesting thought\\". Furthermore, he promised to discuss it with the Department of Justice. In May, Meisner and Wolfe entered the US Courthouse for the District of Columbia around four in the afternoon. They went to the third floor, which was the home of both the US Attorney's Office and the Bar Association Library. They planned to locate Nathan Dodell's office, which was in the back of the Civil Division area, near an elevator. They then searched for the building's photocopiers. After mapping out these locations, they left. Later, Wolfe and Meisner made a copy of Dodell's keys. On May 21, Meisner and Wolfe entered the Courthouse, signing in to do research in the library and were issued an elevator key. After riding the elevator to the floor of the library, the pair entered the library and removed several books from shelves and sat at a table. After a few minutes, they exited through a backdoor and emerged in a hallway. In this hallway was Dodell's office, which they entered using their keys. The duo stole a number of documents related to Scientology and walked through the hallway to the two copy machines they had previously located. The pair photocopied some six inches of documents before returning the originals to Dodell's office. One week later, Wolfe and Meisner again met outside the IRS building. The duo then walked to the US Courthouse, and signed in under fake names. They repeated their actions from the previous week, copying another group of documents from the District of Columbia Police Department as well as the Food and Drug Administration. Returning to Dodell's office through the library, they were stopped by the night librarian, who asked if they had signed in. While they had signed in at the front desk, they had failed to do the same at the front desk of the library. When they announced that they had not, Johnson, the night librarian, told the pair not to come back unless they had specific authorization from the day librarian. The pair promptly left. Three days later Johnson notified the US Attorney's Office that two individuals had been seen using the photocopying machines of the Attorney's Office. Johnson and the night guard were told to immediately contact the FBI if the individuals returned. Less than two weeks later, Hermann phoned Meisner, and ordered him to return to Dodell's office and steal his personal files. The goal was to formulate a plan that would result in Dodell being removed from his position as an Assistant US Attorney for the District of Columbia. Meisner and Wolfe entered the United States Courthouse on June 11 around 7 in the evening. They signed in as they did before, and headed to the library. Johnson, the night librarian, recognized the pair and immediately stopped them. Meisner was prepared for this, and showed the man a letter from the head librarian. Wolfe and Meisner continued to the back of the library where they exited into the hallway. Outside Dodell's office the two saw that cleaning ladies were still at work. While Meisner and Wolfe waited for the cleaning crew to vacate the office, Johnson called the FBI, which sent two agents over immediately. The two agents confronted the Scientologists and demanded to see their identification. Wolfe used his real identification. Meisner presented his fake card, and told the agents that he had recently resigned from the IRS. Meisner told Hansen that the pair was in the library to do legal research, and that they had used the photocopiers to copy books and cases. Neither mentioned Scientology. After roughly twenty minutes of questioning, the FBI agents allowed them to leave. Meisner then phoned Hermann to inform him of the news and was told to immediately fly to Los Angeles. Aftermath and trial Meisner and Wolfe were given cover stories by the Guardian's Office. On the last day of June, Gerald Wolfe was arrested. Wolfe was charged with \\"the use and possession of a forged official pass of the United States.\\" The day after Wolfe's arrest, Mary Sue Hubbard wrote a letter to Weigand ordering him to keep her abreast of the situation. Hubbard also conversed with Mo Budlong and Richard Weigand about Wolfe's arrest, cover story, and subsequent plan to destroy evidence linking Wolfe and Meisner to Scientology. At the end of July a judge decided that the case against Wolfe warranted an investigation by a grand jury. A week later the judge issued an arrest warrant for Meisner, who, at the time, was being hidden in LA. The FBI was able to connect him to Scientology. By January 1977 it was becoming increasingly likely that Scientology would be unable to escape Operation Snow White without serious penalty. Though Meisner was still in hiding, he was growing increasingly anxious about the situation. By April, Meisner wanted to surrender to the authorities. Meisner was quickly put under the control of several guards. On May 13, Gerald Wolfe entered a guilty plea. Later in the month, Meisner escaped his captors, only to be convinced to rejoin the GO the following day. From 1964 to 1995, the Founding Church of Scientology in Washington, D.C.. The building was raided by the FBI in July 1977. In June, Wolfe, after being sentenced to probation and community service, testified before the Grand Jury. Instead of the truth, Wolfe told the latest incarnation of his cover story. Several days later Meisner would again escape his captors, though this time he would contact the FBI. Meisner was eventually taken to Washington, where he agreed to plead guilty to a five-year conspiracy felony and cooperate with the Grand Jury. On July 8, the FBI raided Church of Scientology locations in Los Angeles, Hollywood and Washington, DC. The Los Angeles raid involved 156 FBI agents, the most that had ever been used in a single raid. It lasted 21 hours and filled a 16-ton truck with documents and other items. The raids turned up documentation of not only the group's illegal activities against the United States government, but also illegal activities carried out against other perceived enemies of Scientology. These included \\"Operation Freakout\\", a conspiracy to frame author Paulette Cooper on false bomb-threat charges, and conspiracies to frame Gabe Cazares, mayor of Clearwater, Florida, on false hit-and-run charges. Original (18M) The papers also revealed that Sir John Foster (author of the official UK Government inquiry into Scientology) and Lord Balniel (who had requested the report) were targets, along with the National Association for Mental Health (NAMH) and World Federation for Mental Health.

By July 20, 13 days after the raid, a Washington judge ruled that the documents should be returned, at least temporarily, to the Church, and that none of the documents could be shared with branches of the government, unless that specific branch was investigating Scientology. Scientology's lawyers had successfully argued that in order to prepare for an August 8 hearing on the legality of the raid, they must be able to see the documents.\\"Church of Scientology to Get Documents Back.\\" New York Times. July 21st 1977. By July 27, a judge in Washington had ruled the warrant authorizing the raid was too broad and, as such, violated the Church's 4th Amendment rights.\\"FBI Raids on Church are Ruled Improper; Judge Calls Warrants Too Broad to Justify Seizure of Papers.\\" July 28th 1977. In August, this ruling would be overturned, with Scientology promising to take the case to the Supreme Court,\\"FBI is Upheld on Search Warrant for Church Offices.\\" New York Times.

In August 1978, 11 high-ranking members of Scientology were indicted on 28 charges. One of the indicted was Mary Sue Hubbard, wife of Scientology's creator L. Ron Hubbard. The other ten were Gerald Wolfe, Cindy Raymond, Henning Heldt, Duke Snider, Gregory Willardson, Richard Weigand, Mitchell Herman, Sharon Thomas, Jane Kember, and Mo Budlong. Kendrick Moxon and L. Ron Hubbard were named unindicted co-conspirators.\\"Ex-Agent Alleges Fraud in FBI; Says Many Informers are Bogus.\\" New York Times January 6th, 1979.

Seven of the 11 members of the Guardian's Office pleaded guilty to just a single count of conspiracy to obstruct justice. One more pleaded guilty to a similar charge and a ninth pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor. The Scientologists were allowed to argue for the suppression of the government's evidence. The remaining two Scientologists were in England, pending extradition.\\"Judge Backs Guilty Plea Bargain by Scientology Church Leaders; Assurances Asked.\\" New York Times October 9th 1979.

November 27th, 1980. and were sentenced to six years.\\"2 Scientologists Sentenced to Prison.\\" The Washington Post. December 20th, 1980. Kember and Budlong had claimed political asylum in the UK, arguing that they should not be extradited to the US because the burglaries had political objectives. Their application against extradition was denied by the British High Court on the grounds that it did not fall within the political offence exception to the Extradition Act 1870; Mr. Justice Griffiths said: > I am unable to accept that organising burglaries either for the purpose of > identifying persons in Government offices hostile to the Scientologists, or > for the purpose of gaining an advantage in litigation, or even for the wider > purpose of refuting false allegations thus enabling a better image of the > Church of Scientology to be projected to the public, comes anywhere near > being an offence of a political character within the meaning of the > Extradition Act.

In my view, it would be ridiculous to regard the > Applicants as political refugees seeking asylum in this country, and I > reject the submission that these were offences of a political character. Involved parties Mary Sue Hubbard, Cindy Raymond, Gerald Bennett Wolfe, Henning Heldt, Duke Snider, Gregory Willardson, Richard Weigand, Mitchell Herman, Sharon Thomas, Jane Kember, and Mo Budlong, all high-ranking Scientologists, were convicted; prison sentences were as long as six years, though no defendant served that amount. L. Ron Hubbard was named by federal prosecutors as an \\"unindicted co-conspirator\\" and went into hiding for the rest of his life. Effect of the scandal The Church has been reluctant to discuss the operation's details; typical statements by members and operatives are often vague comments saying that the Guardian's Office (GO) had been \\"infiltrated\\" and \\"set up\\" to fail in its mission to protect the Church, that those involved were \\"purged\\" from the Church, without detailing what actually happened (although it has been suggested many of those involved and \\"purged\\" remained in important positions of power within the church). Church spokespersons on the Internet and elsewhere have been known to claim that the operatives \\"had done nothing more serious than steal photocopier paper.\\"Ortega, Tony (Sept. 9, 2001). \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\". New Times Los Angeles. In 2009, Church of Scientology spokesman Tommy Davis said that the jailed members of Guardians Org were declared \\"suppressive people\\" by the Church of Scientology and had to undergo rehabilitation in order to resume their upper level training in the church. Operation Snow White extended to Canada and resulted in legal proceedings against the Church. By 1990, all eleven defendants in Operation Snow White were free.

It is used in a variety of baking recipes and desserts. It has an appearance similar to honey and is often used as a substitute where honey is unavailable or prohibitively expensive. It is not to be confused with amber corn syrup or amber refined sugar. Regular molasses, or dark treacle, has both a richer colour and a strong, distinctive flavour. Formulated by the chemists Charles Eastick and his brother John Joseph Eastick at the Abram Lyle & Sons (now part of Tate & Lyle) refinery in Plaistow, London, Lyle's Golden Syrup was first canned and sold in 1885. In 2006 it was recognised by Guinness World Records as having the world's oldest branding and packaging.  History  Tate & Lyle syrup refinery at Plaistow Wharf, east London, England, featuring a large-scale representation of a golden syrup can on the nearest corner In 1863, Abram Lyle, owner of a cooperage, became owner of the Glebe Sugar Refinery in Greenock, in lieu of a debt. He became aware of the fact that a by-product of the sugar refining was a syrup which was usually sold off cheaply as pig-food. He thought that, given some adjustment, this syrup could be adapted for human consumption. His company did well and expanded to London.Made in Scotland: Lyle's Golden Syrup In 1883, Charles Eastick, an English chemist at the Abram Lyle & Sons (now part of Tate & Lyle) refinery in Plaistow, east London, further formulated how sugar could be refined to make a preserve and sweetener for cooking, bringing it to its current recipe. Charles and his brother John Joseph Eastick experimented with the refining process, of the bitter molasses- brown treacle‚Äîhitherto a waste by-product of sugar refining‚Äîinto an eminently palatable syrup with the viscosity, hue, and sweetness of honey. The resulting product was marketed commercially in 1885 as \\"golden syrup\\". The name \\"golden syrup\\" in connection with molasses had occurred, however, as early as 1840 in an Adelaide newspaper, the South Australian. A tin of Lyle's Golden Syrup, first sold in 1885. Recognised by Guinness World Records as having the world's oldest branding and packaging.\\"Oldest branding (packaging)\\". Guinness World Records. The tin bears a picture of the rotting carcass of a lion with a swarm of bees and the slogan \\"Out of the strong came forth sweetness\\". This is a reference to the Biblical story in chapter 14 of the Book of Judges in which Samson was traveling to the land of the Philistines in search of a wife. During the journey he killed a lion, and when he passed the same spot on his return he noticed that a swarm of bees had formed a comb of honey in the carcass. Samson later turned this into a riddle at a wedding: \\"Out of the eater came forth meat and out of the strong came forth sweetness\\". While it is not known exactly why this image and slogan were chosen, Abram Lyle was a deeply religious man, and it has been suggested that they refer either to the strength of the Lyle company or the tins in which golden syrup is sold. In 1904, they were registered together as a trademark, and in 2006 Guinness World Records declared the mark to be the world's oldest branding and packaging. Lyle's golden syrup was awarded a Royal Warrant in 1911. In 1921, Lyle's business merged with Tate, a sugar-refining firm founded by Sir Henry Tate in 1859, to become Tate & Lyle. In 2010, Tate & Lyle sold its sugar refining and golden syrup business to American Sugar Refining. Originally, golden syrup was a product made at the white sugar refinery from the recovered mother liquor (recovered molasses) \\"washed\\" off the raw sugar crystals in the process of creating white sugar. This liquor is generally known as refiners return syrup. Today most golden syrups are produced by a specialist manufacturer by inverting half the refiners return syrup to fructose and glucose and blending it back again; this ensures the product remains liquid and will never re- crystallize.  Production  Refiners syrup begins as a high-Brix, pale sucrose syrup made from white sugar and water designed to loosen the dried molasses found on raw sugar crystals. The sucrose saturated content of the initial \\"green\\" syrup impedes sugar crystals from dissolving during the process of washing. The purpose is to mix the green syrup with raw sugar crystals to form a \\"magma\\" of 8‚Äì10% moisture content at around 60‚Äì65¬∞C that is then washed with water in a centrifuge. After the first washing (often termed affination) the \\"washed off\\" molasses combines with the sucrose syrup to generate refiners return syrup, which is generally re-used several times until deemed spent.http://nzic.org.nz/ChemProcesses/food/6E.pdf The spent refiners return syrup is sold off to manufacturers for golden syrup production or is sent to a recovery section of the refinery often called the remelt house or boil-out section. Here it is reheated to crystallize and recover the sucrose it contains and that is returned to the affination stage. The final spent syrup left after the recovery process is sold as treacle (often called refiners molasses in older texts). An equivalent golden syrup product may be made from beet sugar by processing the clarified, partially evaporated beet juice to break down (invert) most of the disaccharide sucrose into its constituents monosaccharides glucose and fructose. In this process none of the sucrose is ever crystallized from the beet juice. Inversion may be done by acid hydrolysis or by adding an enzyme, invertase. This produces a free flowing (invert) syrup that will not crystallize. Typically in acid hydrolysis, the disaccharides are split by hydrochloric acid, resulting in a solution which is acidic; neutrality is restored by the addition of lye, which is sodium hydroxide. As a result, syrup made by this method contains some common salt, sodium chloride. The free glucose and fructose present in golden syrups are more water-soluble than the original sucrose. As a result, golden syrups are less likely to crystallize than a pure sucrose syrup. The free fructose content gives the syrup a taste sweeter than that of an equivalent solution of white sugar; when substituting golden syrup for white sugar, about 25% less golden syrup is needed for the same level of sweetness. The term invert comes from the method used for assessing sugar syrups. The plane of linear polarised light passed through a sample of pure sucrose solution is rotated to the right. As the solution is converted to a mixture of sucrose, fructose and glucose, the angle of rotation reduces, through zero and then increases in the opposite direction, thus the direction appears to have been inverted compared to light passed through the sucrose solution.  Availability  Golden syrup is widely available across the world, made either from sugar cane or sugar beet. Lyle's Golden Syrup, made by Tate & Lyle, remains one of the best known UK brands. There are two other UK sugar refiners, British Sugar who make an equivalent product under its Silver Spoon brand, and Ragus Sugars, who make the Eastick's & Ragus Golden Syrup brand. In South Africa, the most popular brands are the locally produced Illovo golden syrup and the imported Lyle's Golden Syrup. In addition to the classic golden syrup, several flavoured versions are also marketed, notably maple flavour. In Australia, CSR Limited is the major producer, but it is also produced by Bundaberg Sugar and Smith's. In New Zealand, Chelsea golden syrup has been a household name since the late 19th century. Rogers Golden Syrup and Lyle's golden syrup are available in Canada. In Canada, Lyle's Golden Syrup is available in either a glass jar or the traditional tin. King brand syrup, a mixture of corn and invert syrup, is sold in many areas of the US, often grouped with table syrups like maple syrup. Speciality stores or those with international sections, such as Whole Foods Market and Cost Plus World Market, often stock Lyle's golden syrup from the UK in several different packs. In Germany, a similar product called Zuckerr√ºbensirup (literally \\"sugar-beet syrup\\") is a popular spread, especially in the western part of the country around Cologne. The best known producer is the Grafschafter Krautfabrik which has produced Zuckerr√ºbensirup for more than a hundred years. This syrup is almost always made from sugar-beet; golden syrup from sugar cane is extremely rare on the German market. There are two types of Zuckerr√ºbensirup in Germany, a golden one, similar to golden syrup from sugar cane, and a brown syrup which is similar to dark treacle. The German company Schneekoppe makes a product called Fr√ºhst√ºcks-Sirup (breakfast syrup), which is a golden syrup with some added natural flavor to imitate the taste of honey. In Sweden there is a light and a dark golden syrup, beet based.  Properties  Golden syrup is a Newtonian fluid. Its density is approximately 1430 kg¬∑m‚àí3 at room temperature, and its viscosity is 100 Pa¬∑s.

In this situation, the coefficient estimates of the multiple regression may change erratically in response to small changes in the model or the data. Multicollinearity does not reduce the predictive power or reliability of the model as a whole, at least within the sample data set; it only affects calculations regarding individual predictors. That is, a multivariate regression model with collinear predictors can indicate how well the entire bundle of predictors predicts the outcome variable, but it may not give valid results about any individual predictor, or about which predictors are redundant with respect to others. Note that in statements of the assumptions underlying regression analyses such as ordinary least squares, the phrase \\"no multicollinearity\\" usually refers to the absence of multicollinearity, which is an exact (non-stochastic) linear relation among the predictors. In such case, the data matrix X has less than full rank, and therefore the moment matrix X^{\\\\mathsf{T}}X cannot be inverted. Under these circumstances, for a general linear model y = X \\\\beta + \\\\epsilon, the ordinary least squares estimator \\\\hat{\\\\beta}_{OLS} = (X^{\\\\mathsf{T}}X)^{-1}X^{\\\\mathsf{T}}y does not exist. In any case, multicollinearity is a characteristic of the data matrix, not the underlying statistical model. Since it is generally more severe in small samples, Arthur Goldberger went so far as to call it \\"micronumerosity\\". Definition Collinearity is a linear association between two explanatory variables. Two variables are perfectly collinear if there is an exact linear relationship between them. For example, X_{1} and X_{2} are perfectly collinear if there exist parameters \\\\lambda_0 and \\\\lambda_1 such that, for all observations i, we have : X_{2i} = \\\\lambda_0 + \\\\lambda_1 X_{1i}. Multicollinearity refers to a situation in which two or more explanatory variables in a multiple regression model are highly linearly related. We have perfect multicollinearity if, for example as in the equation above, the correlation between two independent variables is equal to 1 or ‚àí1. In practice, we rarely face perfect multicollinearity in a data set. More commonly, the issue of multicollinearity arises when there is an approximate linear relationship among two or more independent variables. Mathematically, a set of variables is perfectly multicollinear if there exist one or more exact linear relationships among some of the variables. For example, we may have : \\\\lambda_0 + \\\\lambda_1 X_{1i} + \\\\lambda_2 X_{2i} + \\\\cdots + \\\\lambda_k X_{ki} = 0 holding for all observations i, where \\\\lambda_k are constants and X_{ki} is the ith observation on the kth explanatory variable. We can explore one issue caused by multicollinearity by examining the process of attempting to obtain estimates for the parameters of the multiple regression equation : Y_{i} = \\\\beta _0 + \\\\beta _1 X_{1i} + \\\\cdots + \\\\beta _k X_{ki} + \\\\varepsilon _{i}. The ordinary least squares estimates involve inverting the matrix : X^{T} X where : X = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & X_{11} & \\\\cdots & X_{k1} \\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & & \\\\vdots \\\\ 1 & X_{1N} & \\\\cdots & X_{kN} \\\\end{bmatrix} is an N √ó (k+1) matrix, where N is the number of observations and k is the number of explanatory variables (with N required to be greater than or equal to k+1). If there is an exact linear relationship (perfect multicollinearity) among the independent variables, at least one of the columns of X is a linear combination of the others, and so the rank of X (and therefore of XTX) is less than k+1, and the matrix XTX will not be invertible. Perfect multicollinearity is fairly common when working with raw datasets, which frequently contain redundant information. Once redundancies are identified and removed, however, nearly multicollinear variables often remain due to correlations inherent in the system being studied. In such a case, instead of the above equation holding, we have that equation in modified form with an error term v_i: : \\\\lambda_0 + \\\\lambda_1 X_{1i} + \\\\lambda_2 X_{2i} + \\\\cdots + \\\\lambda_k X_{ki} + v_i = 0. In this case, there is no exact linear relationship among the variables, but the X_j variables are nearly perfectly multicollinear if the variance of v_i is small for some set of values for the \\\\lambda's. In this case, the matrix XTX has an inverse, but is ill-conditioned so that a given computer algorithm may or may not be able to compute an approximate inverse, and if it does so the resulting computed inverse may be highly sensitive to slight variations in the data (due to magnified effects of either rounding error or slight variations in the sampled data points) and so may be very inaccurate or very sample-dependent. Detection Indicators that multicollinearity may be present in a model include the following: # Large changes in the estimated regression coefficients when a predictor variable is added or deleted # Insignificant regression coefficients for the affected variables in the multiple regression, but a rejection of the joint hypothesis that those coefficients are all zero (using an F-test) # If a multivariable regression finds an insignificant coefficient of a particular explanator, yet a simple linear regression of the explained variable on this explanatory variable shows its coefficient to be significantly different from zero, this situation indicates multicollinearity in the multivariable regression. # Some authors have suggested a formal detection-tolerance or the variance inflation factor (VIF) for multicollinearity: \\\\mathrm{tolerance} = 1-R_{j}^2,\\\\quad \\\\mathrm{VIF} = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\mathrm{tolerance}}, where R_{j}^2 is the coefficient of determination of a regression of explanator j on all the other explanators. A tolerance of less than 0.20 or 0.10 and/or a VIF of 5 or 10 and above indicates a multicollinearity problem. # Farrar‚ÄìGlauber test: If the variables are found to be orthogonal, there is no multicollinearity; if the variables are not orthogonal, then at least some degree of multicollinearity is present. C. Robert Wichers has argued that Farrar‚ÄìGlauber partial correlation test is ineffective in that a given partial correlation may be compatible with different multicollinearity patterns. The Farrar‚ÄìGlauber test has also been criticized by other researchers. # Condition number test: The standard measure of ill-conditioning in a matrix is the condition index. It will indicate that the inversion of the matrix is numerically unstable with finite-precision numbers (standard computer floats and doubles). This indicates the potential sensitivity of the computed inverse to small changes in the original matrix. The condition number is computed by finding the square root of the maximum eigenvalue divided by the minimum eigenvalue of the design matrix. If the condition number is above 30, the regression may have severe multicollinearity; multicollinearity exists if, in addition, two or more of the variables related to the high condition number have high proportions of variance explained. One advantage of this method is that it also shows which variables are causing the problem. # Perturbing the data.A package for R is available: Multicollinearity can be detected by adding random noise to the data and re-running the regression many times and seeing how much the coefficients change. # Construction of a correlation matrix among the explanatory variables will yield indications as to the likelihood that any given couplet of right-hand-side variables are creating multicollinearity problems. Correlation values (off-diagonal elements) of at least 0.4 are sometimes interpreted as indicating a multicollinearity problem. This procedure is, however, highly problematic and cannot be recommended. Intuitively, correlation describes a bivariate relationship, whereas collinearity is a multivariate phenomenon. Consequences One consequence of a high degree of multicollinearity is that, even if the matrix X^{\\\\top}X is invertible, a computer algorithm may be unsuccessful in obtaining an approximate inverse, and if it does obtain one it may be numerically inaccurate. But even in the presence of an accurate X^{\\\\top}X matrix, the following consequences arise. In the presence of multicollinearity, the estimate of one variable's impact on the dependent variable Y while controlling for the others tends to be less precise than if predictors were uncorrelated with one another. The usual interpretation of a regression coefficient is that it provides an estimate of the effect of a one unit change in an independent variable, X_{1}, holding the other variables constant. If X_{1} is highly correlated with another independent variable, X_{2}, in the given data set, then we have a set of observations for which X_{1} and X_{2} have a particular linear stochastic relationship. We don't have a set of observations for which all changes in X_{1} are independent of changes in X_{2}, so we have an imprecise estimate of the effect of independent changes in X_{1}. In some sense, the collinear variables contain the same information about the dependent variable. If nominally \\"different\\" measures actually quantify the same phenomenon then they are redundant. Alternatively, if the variables are accorded different names and perhaps employ different numeric measurement scales but are highly correlated with each other, then they suffer from redundancy. One of the features of multicollinearity is that the standard errors of the affected coefficients tend to be large. In that case, the test of the hypothesis that the coefficient is equal to zero may lead to a failure to reject a false null hypothesis of no effect of the explanator, a type II error. Another issue with multicollinearity is that small changes to the input data can lead to large changes in the model, even resulting in changes of sign of parameter estimates. A principal danger of such data redundancy is that of overfitting in regression analysis models. The best regression models are those in which the predictor variables each correlate highly with the dependent (outcome) variable but correlate at most only minimally with each other. Such a model is often called \\"low noise\\" and will be statistically robust (that is, it will predict reliably across numerous samples of variable sets drawn from the same statistical population). So long as the underlying specification is correct, multicollinearity does not actually bias results; it just produces large standard errors in the related independent variables. More importantly, the usual use of regression is to take coefficients from the model and then apply them to other data. Since multicollinearity causes imprecise estimates of coefficient values, the resulting out-of-sample predictions will also be imprecise. And if the pattern of multicollinearity in the new data differs from that in the data that was fitted, such extrapolation may introduce large errors in the predictions. Remedies # Make sure you have not fallen into the dummy variable trap; including a dummy variable for every category (e.g., summer, autumn, winter, and spring) and including a constant term in the regression together guarantee perfect multicollinearity. # Try seeing what happens if you use independent subsets of your data for estimation and apply those estimates to the whole data set. Theoretically you should obtain somewhat higher variance from the smaller datasets used for estimation, but the expectation of the coefficient values should be the same. Naturally, the observed coefficient values will vary, but look at how much they vary. # Leave the model as is, despite multicollinearity. The presence of multicollinearity doesn't affect the efficiency of extrapolating the fitted model to new data provided that the predictor variables follow the same pattern of multicollinearity in the new data as in the data on which the regression model is based. # Drop one of the variables. An explanatory variable may be dropped to produce a model with significant coefficients. However, you lose information (because you've dropped a variable). Omission of a relevant variable results in biased coefficient estimates for the remaining explanatory variables that are correlated with the dropped variable. # Obtain more data, if possible. This is the preferred solution. More data can produce more precise parameter estimates (with lower standard errors), as seen from the formula in variance inflation factor for the variance of the estimate of a regression coefficient in terms of the sample size and the degree of multicollinearity. # Mean-center the predictor variables. Generating polynomial terms (i.e., for x_1, x_1^2, x_1^3, etc.) or interaction terms (i.e., x_1 \\\\times x_2, etc.) can cause some multicollinearity if the variable in question has a limited range (e.g., [2,4]). Mean-centering will eliminate this special kind of multicollinearity. However, in general, this has no effect. It can be useful in overcoming problems arising from rounding and other computational steps if a carefully designed computer program is not used. # Standardize your independent variables. This may help reduce a false flagging of a condition index above 30. # It has also been suggested that using the Shapley value, a game theory tool, the model could account for the effects of multicollinearity. The Shapley value assigns a value for each predictor and assesses all possible combinations of importance. # Ridge regression or principal component regression or partial least squares regression can be used. # If the correlated explanators are different lagged values of the same underlying explanator, then a distributed lag technique can be used, imposing a general structure on the relative values of the coefficients to be estimated. Examples of contexts in which it arises=Survival analysis Multicollinearity may represent a serious issue in survival analysis. The problem is that time-varying covariates may change their value over the time line of the study. A special procedure is recommended to assess the impact of multicollinearity on the results.For a detailed discussion, see Interest rates for different terms to maturity In various situations it might be hypothesized that multiple interest rates of various terms to maturity all influence some economic decision, such as the amount of money or some other financial asset to hold, or the amount of fixed investment spending to engage in. In this case, including these various interest rates will in general create a substantial multicollinearity problem because interest rates tend to move together. If in fact each of the interest rates has its own separate effect on the dependent variable, it can be extremely difficult to separate out their effects. Extension The concept of lateral collinearity expands on the traditional view of multicollinearity, comprising also collinearity between explanatory and criteria (i.e., explained) variables, in the sense that they may be measuring almost the same thing as each other.

One magazine even wondered if it was an example of her \\"stunt reporting\\" in which Bly would pretend to be married and then write about it. After their marriage, they resided in his home on West 37th Street in New York City. In 1896, they traveled to Europe, returning to New York in 1899 to take care of problems with his business.

Coroner's first album, R.I.P., was based on neoclassical lines and was technical and classically influenced. The second album, Punishment for Decadence, saw a progression into a more complex sound with a unison of bass and guitar. Tempo changes interspersed mid-paced sections and the odd slow passage between the faster passages started to emerge. Lyrically, Coroner began to write about themes such as politics and personal introspection. No More Color was produced by Pete Hinton and the band. Coroner's music became more technical on No More Color as the guitar work was characterized by intricate modes and arpeggios, solo work that was chromatically colorful, as well as the de rigueur crunchy chords and speed runs; the drumming went beyond the 4/4 time of Coroner's two previous albums to incorporate unusual time signatures which became their trademark. Ron Royce's bass playing is also worth a mention as having an advanced three- finger technique which enables him to double the rhythm line as well as perform more intricate riffs. Prime examples of this are the opener \\"Die By My Hand\\" with its vicious riffing and the harmonic minor inspired riff in the middle of \\"Mistress of Deception\\". The closer \\"Last Entertainment\\" is a prescient take on TV. The opening track \\"Die By My Hand\\" is a classic piece of prog come thrash metal. It is technical but also brutal. Mental Vortex continued the evolution over No More Color. Continuing with the previous album's technical formula, the speed metal formula was re-integrated into Coroner's sound on this album but with a tone that made it sound not at all like R.I.P. or Punishment for Decadence. There were slower songs but none of the songs on Mental Vortex stayed the same speed for very long. The songs on Mental Vortex ranged from four to eight minutes. The last track \\"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\\" is a cover of The Beatles song, and a video was shot of it. Overall, the tone was a shift from the thrash/technical of No More Color which showed them gravitating towards their opus Grin. Grin saw a much more industrial sound and was a natural progression from Mental Vortex but was different from most of their previous material. It involved reflective guitar riffs and underlying bass line. It was a slower record and more refined in its metal sensibility. Brooding guitar over Royce's bass produced an almost hypnotic trance-like sound on some tracks. The lead guitar still shone on all tracks. Their eponymous album, Coroner, was a compilation which contained unreleased material, a selection of hits from previous albums, and a remix of the title song from the previous album Grin. The band appears on Br√ºtal Legend with the song \\"Skeleton On Your Shoulder\\". Discography=Studio albums *R.I.P.

He is one of only four players to have won both an Olympic gold medal and the FIFA World Cup with the Italy national football team. Club career Foni was born in Udine, and he made his professional debut with local club Udinese at the age of 16, in 1927, in the Prima Divisione (the predecessor to the Italian Serie A); he later moved to Lazio in 1929. He later moved to Padova for a brief stint after a few seasons in Roma. Foni later transferred to Juventus in 1934, replacing Virginio Rosetta. Along with teammate Pietro Rava at the Turin club, he formed one of the best defensive partnerships in Italy, and in the world, as they went on to win the 1936 Summer Olympics and 1938 FIFA World Cup with Italy, as well as the 1935 League title with Juventus, as well as two Coppa Italia titles in 1938 and 1942. He remained with the club until 1947, and between 1934 and 1947, he never missed a single match for seven consecutive seasons. In total, he made 266 League appearances with Juventus, and 370 total appearances in Serie A, after making his debut in the competition on 2 February 1930, with Lazio, against Pro Vercelli. He moved to play with Chiasso during the 1948‚Äì49 season, making only three appearances in the league, before retiring. International career Foni made his international debut with Italy on 3 August 1936, at the Summer Olympic Games in Berlin, in a 1‚Äì0 win over the United States, helping Italy to win a gold medal in the competition. He became a permanent member of the starting line-up at the 1938 FIFA World Cup, replacing Roma full-back Eraldo Monzeglio, starting alongside his Juventus team-mate Rava, and helping Italy to defend their World Cup title. He ended his international career in 1942, with 23 appearances; along with Pietro Rava, Sergio Bertoni, and Ugo Locatelli, Foni is one of only four Italian players ever to win both the Olympic tournament and the World Cup. Coaching career Following his retirement, he coached in Italy and Switzerland, although Italy failed to qualify for the 1958 World Cup. He won two consecutive scudetti with FC Internazionale in 1953 and 1954, and the Inter- Cities Fairs Cup with Roma in 1961. He later coached Switzerland in the 1966 FIFA World Cup. Style of management Foni is known for having used the catenaccio tactic successfully during his time as Inter's manager in the 1950s; unlike Nereo Rocco's version of the system, however, Foni's teams's strong defensive play off the ball did not limit the offensive manner in which his team played while in possession of the ball. In his system, his team's right winger, Gino Armano, would drop back to mark the opposing the team's left winger (essentially acting as a tornante), allowing Ivano Blason, the right-back, to shift across and act as a sweeper and clear balls away.

It was established as a small-format magazine called The Queen in 1873. In 1897 it was renamed McCall's Magazine‚ÄîThe Queen of Fashion (later shortened to McCall's) and subsequently grew in size to become a large-format glossy. It was one of the \\"Seven Sisters\\" group of women's service magazines. McCall's published fiction by such well-known authors as Alice Adams, Lester Atwell, Ray Bradbury, Gelett Burgess, Willa Cather, Jack Finney, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Barbara Garson, John Steinbeck, Tim O'Brien, Tony J. Caridi, Anne Tyler and Kurt Vonnegut. Features From June 1949 until her death in November 1962, Eleanor Roosevelt wrote a McCall's column, \\"If You Ask Me\\". The former First Lady gave brief answers to questions sent into the magazine.McCall's 100th Anniversary Issue. April 1976. Starting in May 1951, and lasting until at least 1995,Betsy McCall Paper Dolls Betsy McCall paper dolls were printed in most issues. Children could cut out the printed dolls and clothing, or for a small fee (10¬¢ in 1957, 25¬¢ in 1967) paper dolls printed on cardboard could be ordered. Betsy McCall became so popular that various sized vinyl dolls were produced by Ideal and American Character Dolls. Another popular feature which ran for many years was the cartoon panel \\"It's All in the Family\\" by Stan and Jan Berenstain. A pair of pioneering female illustrators, Jessie Willcox Smith and Neysa McMein, drew dozens of McCall's cover portraits. Film critic Pauline Kael worked at McCall's from 1965 to 1966, and was reportedly fired after writing a highly unfavorable review of The Sound of Music. Sewing patterns and The Queen of Fashion In 1870, Scottish immigrant James McCall began designing and printing his own line of sewing patterns. As a means of advertising his patterns, McCall founded a four-page fashion journal entitled The Queen: Illustrating McCall's Bazaar Glove-Fitting Patterns. When McCall died in 1884, his widow became president of McCall Company, and hired Mrs. George Bladsworth as magazine editor. Mrs. Bladsworth held the position until 1891. Though still mainly a vehicle to sell McCall's sewing patterns, The Queen began to publish homemaking and handiwork information, and by 1890 had expanded to 12 pages. In 1891, the magazine's name became The Queen of Fashion, and the cost for a year's subscription was 30 cents. In 1893, James Henry Ottley took over the McCall Company. He increased the subscription price to 50 cents a year, increased the number of pages to between 16 and 30 per issue, and began to publish articles on children's issues, health, beauty, and foreign travel. In order to reflect the magazine's expanded range of topics, the name was changed to McCall's Magazine‚ÄîThe Queen of Fashion in 1897. In time, the name would be shortened to McCall's. Despite the name changes, for many years information on McCall's patterns filled an average of 20 percent of the magazine's pages.McCall's Magazine‚ÄîThe Queen of Fashion, Oct. 1909, McCall's Magazine, Aug. 1914, Jan. 1915, May, 1916 McCall's Magazine Fashion 1916 in McCall's In 1913, the magazine was purchased by the banking firm of White Weld & Co., which organized the McCall Corporation under the direction of president Edward Alfred Simmons. In 1917, the price was raised to 10 cents per issue. In 1922, Harry Payne Burton became editor, and for the first time such well-known fiction writers as Kathleen Norris, Harold Bell Wright, Zane Grey and Booth Tarkington had stories published in McCall's. In 1928, the 23-year-old associate editor, Otis Wiese, was promoted to editor. He believed \\"women were ready for more significant fiction than Gene Stratton-Porter\\" and suggested that McCall's sell Burton's acquisitions of popular fiction to Ladies Home Journal and Woman's Home Companion. Such radical ideas caused Wiese to be fired at least six times within his first year as editor, but he was always rehired because, as he put it, \\"there was no one else around the place with ideas.\\" McCall's Homemaking cover (1938): Jinx Falkenburg In 1932, Wiese changed the format to what he called Three Magazines in One. Three sections‚ÄîNews and Fiction, Homemaking, Style and Beauty‚Äîhad their own cover, and each contained ads tailored to its contents. A survey was conducted that showed fiction was a major attraction for female magazine readers, and in 1937 McCall's became the first women's magazine to print a complete novel in one issue. Pearl Harbor was attacked on December 7, 1941, and Otis Wiese immediately revamped the February 1942 issue then in preparation. A frilly valentine cover was replaced with a woman wearing an \\"I've Enlisted\\" consumer pledge button. Readers were asked to sign a pledge that stated \\"As a consumer, in the total defense of democracy, I will do my part to make my country ready, efficient and strong. I will buy carefully. I will take good care of the things I have. I will waste nothing.\\" Within three weeks, 150,000 readers signed the pledge and sent in a coupon printed in the magazine. During World War II, all women's magazines took on a patriotic slant, but McCall's received much positive press coverage for being the first magazine to do so McCall's began a \\"Washington Newsletter\\" section, which provided information on rationing and conservation. During the post-war era, fiction was no longer such an important draw for readers; they wanted more articles and picture spreads. To provide lively nonfiction Wiese hired two former Look magazine editors. Daniel Danforth Mich became editorial director, and Henry Ehrlich was named managing editor. McCall's Three Magazines in One format was discontinued in 1950. In 1954 Wiese began to reformat McCall's with a \\"Togetherness\\" slogan; it was announced that the magazine would no longer be just for women, but aimed at the entire family. During this time period paid circulation was 4.5 million per issue. In 1953, financier Norton Simon began purchasing shares of McCall Corporation, and in 1956, Simon's group of investors was in control of the corporation. In 1958, Simon named Arthur B. Langlie as president of the company. Otis Wiese, who had been vice president, as well as editor and publisher of McCall's, had expected to be named president. When Langlie was named to the position, Wiese and a number of staffers resigned in protest. A Business Week article stated \\"The house of togetherness had come apart at the seams.\\" Simon replaced Wiese with Herbert Mayes, who had been editor of Good Housekeeping. Mayes did away with the \\"Togetherness\\" slant, and came up with a new slogan, \\"First Magazine For Women.\\" He introduced additional color pages, and used more fiction. In 1962 Mayes became president and CEO of McCall Corporation. From 1962 to 1965, John Mack Carter was editor of McCall's. Under his leadership, circulation rose to 8.4 million. In 1965, Carter left to become editor of Ladies' Home Journal. A rapid succession of editors followed Carter, including Robert Stein and James Fixx. In 1969, Life magazine columnist Shana Alexander was named editor. Alexander had no editing experience, and at the time of her appointment stated \\"I have to educate myself about women's magazines, but I think I know something about women.\\" Alexander left in 1971. Robert Stein was editor from 1972 to 1986. During Stein's tenure, McCalls gained the slogan / subtitle \\"The Magazine for Suburban Women.\\" After Stein left, the quick turnover of editors returned. Change in ownership Ownership of McCall's began to change nearly as fast as editors came and went. Norton Simon sold McCall's to the Pritzker family in 1973. Norton Simon kept the McCall pattern business, which continues under different ownership. In 1986, McCall's Publishing Company was bought by Time Inc. and Lang Communications. In 1989, McCall's was sold to The New York Times Company, and in 1994, German-based Gruner + Jahr announced plans to purchase their magazine business. Change to Rosie In 2000, entertainer Rosie O'Donnell became editorial director of McCall's. In 2001 McCall's was renamed Rosie. O'Donnell stated, \\"I wanted a magazine that celebrates real women, that understands that they care about more than waistlines or the latest makeup styles or fashions, that they want to be relevant and help each other and care about the world.\\" Rosie ceased publication at the end of 2002. O'Donnell said in a statement \\"I decided I could not participate in a magazine that bears my name when I could not be assured it would reflect my vision, values and editorial direction.\\" After publication of the long-running magazine ended, a highly publicized legal battle between O'Donnell and her angry publisher, Gruner + Jahr, began in 2003. Ultimately, the judge ruled against both sides and dismissed the case. Gruner + Jahr exited the U.S. magazine business in 2005, selling its women's magazine portfolio to the Meredith Corporation and its business magazine portfolio to Mansueto Ventures.

Life and death The only son of King Philip IV of Spain and his first wife, Elisabeth of France, he was baptized on November 4, 1629 in the Parish of San Juan, Madrid. His godparents were Infanta Maria Anna and Infante Charles, aunt and uncle of the newborn; In√©s de Z√∫√±iga y Velasco, Countess of Olivares (wife of the Count-Duke of Olivares) sat on a crystal throne during his baptism, which was said to be the most precious jewel she had seen. The Countess of Olivares, who was also chief lady-in-waiting to the Queen, worked as a governess to the prince, which gave rise to comments about the control that the Count-Duke of Olivares had on the heir. On 7 March 1632, he was sworn in before the nobility of Castile as \\"His Majesty's Heir\\" and \\"Prince of these kingdoms of Castile and Leon, and others that are subject to these Crowns, united and incorporated\\", in a ceremony held at the Monastery of San Jer√≥nimo el Real of Madrid. His father soon began diplomatic efforts to seek a bride: Archduchess Mariana of Austria, daughter of Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand III and his paternal aunt, Maria Anna, and therefore his cousin, being chosen; they were betrothed in 1646. Another cousin, the daughter of his mother's sister, Henrietta Maria and her husband, King Charles I of England, Mary, Princess Royal, was also proposed as a potential bride - but was turned down on grounds of religion. After the Catalan revolt of 1640, Philip IV tried to win over Aragon to raise money and men for the new war front. One of the steps taken towards this end was to bring the Prince Balthasar Charles to be sworn as crown prince of the Kingdom of Arag√≥n. The oath was held on 20 August 1645, when the prince was sixteen years old, in the Cathedral of the Savior, Zaragoza. This titled him as Prince of Gerona, Governor General of Aragon, Duke of Montblanc, Count of Cervera and Lord of the City of Balaguer. Meanwhile, on 13 November of that year, Balthasar Charles was also sworn as heir to the Kingdom of Valencia. In April 1646, Philip IV, wanting his son to be sworn in as heir apparent to the throne of Navarre, as he had been in Aragon the previous year, moved with him from Madrid to Pamplona, where, after recognizing the privileges of the kingdom of Navarre, the ceremony was solemnly celebrated on 3 May 1646. After the ceremony, the royal family moved to Zaragoza. On October 5, the eve of second anniversary of the death of Queen Elisabeth, Philip IV and Balthasar Charles attended Vespers that night in her memory. That evening, the prince was ill and the next day, Saturday October 6, he had to stay in bed while the king went to the funeral. The disease, smallpox, spread rapidly, and on Tuesday, October 9, at 8 in the morning, the Archbishop of Saragossa gave him the Last Sacraments. It is said that the Host was exhibited until 3 o'clock, when it became a general procession to the Convent of Jesus, which then proceeded to Our Lady of Cogullada and brought in procession to the altar of La Seo where it was surrounded by candles and prayers. At 9 pm that same day, October 9, Prince Balthasar Charles died. His remains were kept in Zaragoza until the night of October 16, when they were transferred to the Monastery of San Lorenzo de El Escorial. Following his death, his former bride-to-be married his father the king. The king fell into a deep unease as noted in a letter his spiritual advisor, Sister Maria de Agreda: \\"The prayers did not lift the spirits of our Lord for the health of my son enjoying his glory. Not agreeing owed him or us otherwise. I'm in the state that you can judge, for I have lost a child I had, so that you you saw him, I really encouraged him much in the midst of all my cares [...] have offered to God this blow, which I confess I have pierced the heart and in this state do not know if dream or truth is what happens for me.\\" Balthasar Charles and the arts The figure of Prince Balthasar Charles has endured over time because of the portraits made of him by Vel√°zquez (for example, Prince Balthasar Charles on horseback and Prince Balthasar Charles hunter both in the Museo del Prado, Prince Balthasar Charles with a dwarf in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, or the Prince Balthasar Charles in the ring, from the private collection of the Duke of Westminster (London), among others) and Juan Bautista Martinez del Mazo, of which the prince was a great patron (\\"Portrait of Prince Baltasar Carlos\\", dated 1635 (Museum of Fine Arts in Budapest) or \\"Prince Baltasar Carlos at 16 years' (Museo del Prado). Moreover, many authors devoted their works to the young prince. For example, Diego de Saavedra Fajardo dedicates his most famous work, \\"Idea of a Christian Political Prince Represented in a Hundred Enterprises\\" (1640), to the Prince, while Baltasar Graci√°n dedicated to him, his work The Discreet (1646): THE DISCREET / DE / LORENZO GRACIAN, / That public / DON Vincencio IVAN/ DE LASTANOSA. / AND / DEDICATED TO / HIS / SERENE HIGHNESS / Don Baltasar Carlos / Prince of Spain / Y / From the New World. / Licensed. / Printed in Huesca, by Iuan / Nogues, Year 1646 For his part, Quevedo dedicated to the late Prince his \\"Oath of His Royal Highness Prince Don Baltasar Carlos,\\" 23 included in the Muse Clio, 1648 edition of the Spanish Parnassus. The poem was written on the occasion of the swearing in of Prince Balthasar Charles on 7 March 1632 and, even though unfinished, is a very interesting poem by circumstances and technique that is written.

The unit scale is German Corps and Soviet Armies and roughly covers the Berlin to Gorki region (west to east) and Archangelsk to Grozny (north to south). A full campaign game covers the June 1941 to June 1945 period but numerous shorter scenarios are commonly played. The system features a double-impulse movement system that simulates the German armored blitzkrieg into Western Russia, with mass breakthroughs and encirclements. The rules cover unit production with Russian \\"worker units\\" (which simulate both factories and fortifications in key cities), \\"Stuka\\" units representing German air strikes, partisans, rail movement, and weather rules. There are also several smaller scenarios detailing key periods during the campaign. Components The game map represents the portions of the western Soviet Union and the Eastern European countries where the military campaign took place. It is overlaid by a hexgrid to standardize movement, and each hex is about 55 km across. Each turn of the game covers two months of the campaign, beginning with the German invasion on June 22, 1941. \\"The Russian Campaign\\" came in a color-printed cardboard box, with a fold-out, cardboard-backed game board (22\\" √ó 28\\"); Order of Battle cards giving the unit deployments for the German and Soviet players; a sheet of 225 chits a set of rules, and a six-sided die. The terrain types on the map include mountains, woods, swamp, rivers, and the Black and Baltic sea coasts. The map also includes significant cities, national boundaries, Soviet military district boundaries, as well as the major rail networks. The die-cut cardboard counters are colored according to nationality, with field gray for German, light olive for German allies (Hungary, Romania, Italy and Finland with a letter indicating the nationality) and black for German SS units. Soviet tank corps and Guard armies (both infantry and tank) are printed in a lighter yellow than the Soviet cavalry and regular infantry (neither of which may move in the second impulse). Each of the counters is printed with unit-specific information. This information includes the unit type, size, designation, combat factor, setup information and a movement factor. The unit type is indicated by a standard symbol, and the available types are Armor, Cavalry, Infantry, Mountain, Paratroop, and Panzer Grenadier (mechanized infantry). There are also markers for Soviet partisans and worker units, and for German Luftwaffe (air force) troops. Most Soviet units, apart from those that set up in cities in the interior of the USSR, are set up in the Baltic, Western, Kiev (the strongest of the four) and Odessa Military Districts, within boundaries shown on the map. Several potential Soviet setups were published in the Avalon Hill \\"General\\" magazine. Most German forces set up in Germany (including occupied Poland), although some German forces set up in Romania. Up to three of a player's corps, or two armies (or a corps and an army) can be stacked together at the end of a turn. Each of these unit counters has a zone of control, consisting of the six hexes surrounding its current location. As the units are moved about the map during game play, they must cease movement for the turn when they enter a zone of control of one of their opponent's units. Game play A game of The Russian Campaign is normally played between two players, with one playing the side of Germany and its allies, and the other playing the side of the Soviet Union. The game is played in a series of turns, with the German player performing a sequence of actions followed by the Soviet player repeating the same sequence. After the German player has rolled to determine the weather, the game sequence proceeds as follows: *Move your units **Position air units **Check for reinforcements, withdrawals, etc. **Railroad movement *Attack enemy units *Second Impulse - move units (if eligible) not in enemy zone of control *Attack enemy units **Check if your units are out of supply The Soviet player then repeats the same sequence. Movement Units are moved across the map by spending one or more of their movement allowance points to move from one hex to another hex. If a hex contains significant terrain, such as mountains, then movement ceases upon entry (except for mountain infantry). Movement is limited under certain weather conditions, determined by a die roll each turn. For example, \\"Mud\\" weather limits first impulse movement to 2 hexes for all units and prevents second impulse movement. Other weather types include \\"Light Mud\\" and \\"Snow,\\" which halves all first impulse movement for all units and limits second impulse movement to one hex. Snow always occurs in January/February, but may also occur in November/December or (less likely) March/April. The effect of weather rolls has a huge impact on the game, especially in 1941, when the German player might stymie his advance by rolling \\"Mud\\" in the autumn, yet also has a slim chance of rolling clear weather through to the end of the year (this is no longer possible in the L2 Edition), greatly increasing his chances of capturing Moscow. A common house rule to reduce the role of luck was to roll separately for each impulse, giving a slight advantage to the Soviet player who would know in advance what the weather for each impulse would be. Other proposals were aired in the \\"General\\" magazine, while the L2 edition uses a running die roll modifier in which bad weather makes good weather more likely in following turns, and (optionally) Soviet replacements are increased slightly in good weather and reduced in bad weather. Soviet units are less mobile than German, as regular infantry are not eligible to move on the second impulse (German infantry may move 2 hexes in clear weather), and Soviet tank units may only move 2 hexes on the second impulse (German armor may move 4 hexes in clear weather). Combat If a unit ends its movement in a zone of control of the opponent's units, then those units must be attacked. (Not necessarily by every one of the player's units in the opponent's zone of control.) Each attacks is performed separately by adding up the combat factors of the player's attacking units, then dividing by the combat factor of the opponent's units being attacked. This is then rounded down to a simple ratio, such as 2-to-1, 1-to-3, or 5-to-1. Higher odds improved the odds for a successful attack (typically you'd want odds of 3-to-1 or more to have better than 50% chance of success). Terrain features generally favored the defender by doubling their combat factor. Odds of 10-1 (or 7-1 plus a Stuka - see below) ensured an automatic victory, enabling the enemy unit to be removed straightaway from the game (and not eligible for replacement) during the movement phase and perhaps opening up a corridor that other friendly units might pass through. The results of an attack are determined by rolling a six- sided die and then finding the result on the Combat results table. The results ranged from the attacking units being eliminated up to the defending units being eliminated or even surrendering (removed from the game altogether and may never be replaced). Between these extremes there are a range of intermediate results, including retreat by the attacker or defender, an exchange of losses, a combination of unit losses and a retreat, or \\"contact\\", meaning that the units simply remain adjacent to one another, with further combat being thus inevitable in the next turn. Supply, air support and paratroops Supply plays an important role during the game. Combat units must be able to trace a supply line to a friendly city or rail line (captured railway lines automatically convert to friendly control). Units out of supply have their combat rating halved. The first and second winters in Russia are particularly difficult for the German side, as supply is severely hindered during that period for units that are not close to a city. German air supremacy early in the war - initially overwhelming but diminishing over time - is depicted by the use of \\"Stuka\\" units. In 1941 the German player receives three Stukas, or one in \\"Mud\\" turns (some players allowed the German player four Stukas in the opening turn), whereas in 1942 he receives two Stukas, or one in \\"Mud\\" turns, and in 1943 one Stuka in clear turns only. Stukas are never available in snow turns. Each Stuka must trace its air range to one of the three (North, Centre and South) German Army Group Headquarter counters. Adding a Stuka unit to a combat shifts the odds by 3 in the Germans' favour, i.e. a 2-1 becomes a 5-1 attack. The game also includes three optional Russian artillery units, each of which shifts the odds by 1, for use in the latter stages of the game, as well as a single German artillery unit available in 1942. The L2 version of the game allows the Russians to receive air support from \\"Sturmovik\\" units late in the game. The Soviet player has three paratroop units, which may only drop during winter turns, and that must be dropped within range of the Soviet STAVKA headquarters unit. Paratroops are weak (combat factor of one, as opposed to three to eight or even ten for other units), but may be useful in cutting off German retreat. The Russian player also has three partisan counters, which may be deployed to cut railway lines, but that may not be deployed near an SS unit. The game also contains rudimentary rules for seaborne movement and invasions in the Black Sea and Baltic Sea. Hitler and Stalin, who may only move by rail, are also shown as counters in the game. Like STAVKA and the three German Army Group Headquarters, Hitler and Stalin are each assumed to have a combat strength of one. Reinforcements and replacements Each player has a schedule of reinforcements. Most German forces are present on the map to begin with, although some appear later in the game, including most of the SS corps. Italian units are removed in September 1943 at the point when the Western Allies are deemed to have landed in Italy. The German player also receives extra reinforcements at Warsaw and Bucharest when the Soviets draw near to these cities, or in the far north if Leningrad is captured by the Germans (representing Dietl's forces, which fought at Murmansk in reality). The USSR's forces are initially weak, but many new infantry armies are received in the autumn of 1941, and Guards Armies at regular intervals thereafter. The Soviet player starts the game with a three-factor worker unit in Moscow, and two- factor worker units in Leningrad, Kiev, Kharkov and Stalino (the latter three will probably be lost to German attacks), but receives nine more worker units (all but one of them single-factor) over the first year or so of the war. The German player may replace one of each type of unit each year, although he may replace one panzer corps for each of the three oil wells on the map he controls‚Äîwhich means that unless he captures the two oil wells in the Caucasus he is limited to replacing one panzer corps for the oil well at Ploie»ôti in Romania. All SS units may be replaced automatically. The Soviet player receives replacement points each turn, one for each worker factor, and also (between January 1942 and January 1945) between one and six replacement points, determined by a die roll, of Allied aid via Murmansk - in the L2 edition this has now been fixed at three extra points per turn. Only one Russian tank (or Guards Tank) unit, and one Guards Infantry Army, may be replaced each turn. In 1943 the value of the Russian worker units (but not that of the Murmansk aid) is doubled, representing greater industrial mobilisation and greater Allied Lend-Lease aid via Persia and Vladivostok. Generally, the Germans have more powerful (at least in 1941) and more mobile units and are able to usually get more favorable odds in combat, but the Soviets are able to recreate their destroyed armies at a much faster rate and can thus afford the higher casualty rate that comes with the lower combat odds. Victory conditions The game's victory conditions have evolved slightly over the years. In the Avalon Hill version victory was obtained by capturing the enemy capital and eliminating the enemy leader counter, or by capturing all enemy cities (all but one in some versions, to prevent a defeated player avoiding defeat by holing up in Bucharest or Archangel). In the L2 version the German player wins by capturing Moscow and eliminating Stalin, or else by maintaining control of Berlin at the end of the game. The game also contains \\"Sudden Death\\" victory conditions, by which each player may secretly select one of a menu of victory conditions that vary from year to year, and wins the game outright by controlling both his own and the enemy objective for that year. The idea is that this encourages a player to commit more resources than is objectively rational to a given objective, eg. the German offensive into the Caucasus in 1942, in the hope of winning an outright victory but risking catastrophic defeat in the event of failure. Under these rules, the game - if it followed the exact course of history - would end early in 1943 as the Soviet player would control both Stalingrad and the oil well at Maikop. Development history * First Edition: Jedko Games, John Edwards, 1974. First issue had a flat box, and the undated map was in 2 flat sections, 50 x 30cm, using pale colours. A reissue in the same year came in a bookcase box, with identical rules, but a reformatted errata sheet glued to the rulebook, and with the map on 3 folded sections. The map was redrawn with terrain occupying the whole of the hexes, in bolder colours, and expanded 2 hexrows to the west and 1 to the east. It was also given a black border, so that the map consisted only of whole hexes, was dated 1974, and a new branch railway was added into the forest hex just south of Konigsberg. * Second Edition: Avalon Hill, Don Greenwood, 1976 * Third Edition: Avalon Hill, Richard Hamblen, 1977 * Fourth Edition: L2 Design Group, Tom Gregorio, 2003 * Southern Expansion: L2 Design Group, Art Lupinacci, 2004.

Related games In 1980 Avalon Hill also published \\"Fortress Europa\\", covering the Western Front from June 1944 to the end of the war. Although on a slightly smaller scale (divisions/brigades rather than corps/armies), the game was based on an essentially similar system to \\"The Russian Campaign\\", and indeed began with the German player setting up his divisions inside army districts along the French coast, similar to the Russian setup in Military Districts in \\"The Russian Campaign\\". \\"Paul Koenig's Fortress Europe\\", a revised version of \\"Fortress Europa\\", was published by Victory Point Games in 2016 and reprinted in 2017. A similar game covering the Italian campaign is under design. A \\"Designer Signature Edition\\" of the original \\"Fortress Europa\\" was published by Compass Games in 2019. In the mid 1980s Avalon Hill also published \\"Russian Front\\", a game covering almost exactly the same topic as \\"The Russian Campaign\\", but with slightly more detail to the air war and very different combat mechanics. The game also looked very different as it featured a state of the art painted mapboard. In 2004 L2 Design Group developed \\"Russia Besieged\\" based on the designer's experience with \\"The Russian Campaign\\". Similar in scale and scope, and openly acknowledging its debt to \\"The Russian Campaign\\", it adds additional chrome to the rules to provide additional realism to the simulation of this conflict. The game was republished by Compass Games in 2018. Reception This game was the 1976 winner of the Charles S. Roberts award for \\"Best Strategic Game\\".1976 Origins Awards Winners It is considered by many experienced wargame players to be a classic wargame, and is still widely played in organized competition at conventions and e-mail tournaments.

The population in 2011 was 1,900,Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica in an area of 21.97 km¬≤.Eurostat Maia is the largest parish by area in Ribeira Grande. History The front facade of the Church of the Divino Esp√≠rito Santo The tea fields in the foothills of Gorreana, established in the 18th century: the only European region to support tea production The first Azorean historians referred to this parish, owing to the settlement of In√™s da Maia, a noblewoman that established a home here in the 15th century. The settlement of the community dates back to the early settlement of Ribeira Grande; the construction of the main church was begun at the end of the 15th century. By 1522, it had its third vicar. Maia became one of the northern coasts more rapidly growing places: one hundred years after its foundation it had become a civil parish. Its fertile terrains, one of the more productive on the island of S√£o Miguel, and its port access, meant that small industry developed easily in this area. In particular, the tobacco, tea and cement industries developed over the course of the next centuries. Maia was also the location and headquarters for one of the first passenger transport companies on the island. The parochial church was dedicated to the Holy Spirit in 1812, constructed after a 16th-century chapel, and expanded in 17th and 18th centuries. The Solar do Lal√©m, constructed at the end of the 19th century, with chapel and 18th-century portal. In the area of Gorreana, thus named for the fact that the first resident was a man named Gorreana or gorro de Ana, who owned a tea plantation, a rare thing in Europe.The importance of the tea factory () was celebrated during its centanary of operation, when the business demonstrated the infusions and various species that were cultivated in Gorreana over the years. This area is also the location of the Chapel of Nossa Senhora do Resgate (), from the 18th century, constructed with a decorative facade by the local farmers. In its interior, azulejos were assembled on the altar with a medallion and the patron saint in the same decoration. In the area of Lombinha da Maia, named for its location on a small hill/escarpment (), a small chapel was constructed in 1896, to the invocation of Nossa Senhora das Dores. Later it was adapted, with a baptistery and sacristy to support the parishioners. On 27 October 1919, a commission was installed to establish a religious Brotherhood, dedicated to the Holy Spirit of Maia () was convened. In 1943, the group erected a cornerstone for the local hospital, inaugurated on 24 September 1944. With the acquisition of the local pharmacy in 1946, the Santa Casa supported the population from Porto Formoso until Fenais da Ajuda. The first male school was created in 1860, and later another schoolhouse dedicated to female students was established in 1877, eventually resulting in the development of the first primary school in January 1890. These schools were installed in private residences, which were later substituted by centenary schools, as part of centenary build programs at the turn of the century, opening on 1 December 1951. In 2000, Maia inaugurated a new EB2/3 secondary school to support the regional population. Geography Maia is located along the northern coast of S√£o Miguel, situated between the civil parishes of S√£o Br√°s (in the west) and Lomba da Maia (in the east) in the municipality of Ribeira Grande, with the municipalities of Vila Franca do Campo and Povoa√ß√£o to the south. This southern border makes-up part of the Serra da Tronqueira, a rugged ridge that intersects the middle of the island. The parish is bisected by the Regional E.R. 1-1¬™ roadway running west to east, and a secondary roadway (E.R.2-1¬™) running to the southern municipality. There are several smaller nuclei within the borders of Maia, these include the main village of Maia (along the coast), Lombinha da Maia (near the border with Lomba da Maia), Cal√ßos da Maia (a stretch of road to the main roadway from the village) and Gorreana (near its western border with S√£o Br√°s). The main village extends along a former debris field, a faj√£, that extended from the heights of the Economy The parish is supported economically by agriculture, fishing and auxiliary industries/commerce related to the tea plantations, tourism and hospitality services. Culture The parish social centre promotes many of the cultural initiatives, conferences, colloquias and events in the parish. Religious events include the celebrations marking Senhor dos Passos, on the week Sunday of Lent, the festivals of the Holy Spirit (on the Monday of Holy Spirit), the festival of a \\"Blessed\\" (), on the second-to- last Sunday of July, and the feast of Our Lady of the Rosary (), on the first Sunday of October. There are approximately 14 processions per year in the parish.

The Battle of Contreras, also known as the Battle of Padierna, took place on 19‚Äì20 August 1847, in one of the final encounters of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, as invading U.S. forces under Winfield Scott approached the Mexican capital. American forces surprised and then routed the Mexican forces General Gabriel Valencia, who had disobeyed General Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna's orders for his forces' placement. Although the battle was an overwhelming victory for U.S. forces, there are few depictions of it in contemporary popular prints.Sandweiss, Martha A., Rick Stewart, and Ben W. Huseman. Eyewitness to War: Prints and Daguerreotypes of the Mexican War, 1846-1848. Fort Worth: Amon Carter Museum, 1989, p. 309. The armies re- engaged the next day in the Battle of Churubusco. Background General Gabriel Valencia's army of the north was part of the forces that fought at the Battle of Buena Vista in February 1847, in which Santa Anna retreated before giving a crushing blow to the forces of Zachary Taylor. The Mexican forces were then divided in two, with one sent to Cerro Gordo and the other to San Luis Potos√≠. General Valencia was given the command of the forces in San Luis, replacing General Mora y Villamil. In April 1847 Battle of Cerro Gordo, General Winfield Scott's victorious forces clearly threatened the capital, and Valencia's forces were ordered to Mexico City. Most of Valencia's men were from Central Mexico, so the march southward brought them to their home territory. News that Scott's forces were marching from Puebla toward the capital was said to cheer Valencia's forces, who expected to be victorious. Valencia's troops marched rapidly south, from Texcoco northeast of the capital to Guadalupe Hidalgo, and traversed Mexico City on the way to their position south of the city in San Angel.Alcaraz, Ram√≥n. The Other Side, Or, Notes for the History of the War Between Mexico and the United States. Translator, Albert C. Ramsey. New York: John Wiley 1850, reprint. pp. 259-60 They arrived in San Angel on August 17. Valencia expected the U.S. forces to attack San Antonio and anticipated his troops would move behind them to help bring about the victory. On 18 August, he placed a battery of artillery, overseen by General Mej√≠a. Santa Anna did not concur with Valencia's positioning of his forces, and as Supreme Commander orders him to withdraw to Coyoacan and Churubusco. Valencia disobeyed Santa Anna's order and his disobedience \\"formed afterward his indictment\\" [in the defeat].Alcaraz, The Other Side, pp. 271-72 Santa Anna's plan for a coordinated defense of the capital fell apart when Valencia disobeyed his orders, essentially not recognizing Santa Anna as the commander of Mexican forces. Santa Anna and Valencia had a personal rivalry, one of many in the officer corps of the military and a product of years of coups and political rivalries.Guardino, Peter. The Dead March: A History of the Mexican-American War. Cambridge: Harvard University Press 2017, p. 243. The battle was the first one in the immediate environs of the capital, as part of General Winfield Scott's invasion of Mexico's heartland and drive to the capital. Leaving Puebla on 7 August for his march on Mexico City, the U.S. army under Scott, reached Ayotla and Chalco on 11 August with the divisions of David E. Twiggs, William J. Worth, John A. Quitman, and Gideon Johnson Pillow.Bauer, K.J., 1974, The Mexican War, 1846‚Äì1848, New York: Macmillan, Scott moved on the south side of Lake Chalco on 15 August, advancing to San Agust√≠n. Rather than moving northward that would have taken them to the choke point at El Pe√±on, which Mexican General Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna had fortified, Scott chose a circuitous southerly route to attack Mexico City. Santa Anna understood Scott's flanking action, and sought to block alternative routes into the capital. Santa Anna placed troops under his own command at the pueblo of San Antonio and commanded that the 7,000 men of General Gabriel Valencia's Army of the North, place itself at another strategic point at San √Ångel, near Contreras by 17 August. Battle General Valencia had not yet faced U.S. troops in battle, and did not consider the spot that Santa Anna had ordered him to at San √Ångel to be a defensible position. He disobeyed orders and moved his infantry and cannons to just south of Padierna. Valencia had not expected the U.S. forces to be able to cross the lava field at El Pedregal, considering it impassable terrain and a natural defense. Intending to flank San Antonio, Scott ordered Capt. Robert E. Lee to build a road across El Pedregal so he could enfilade San Antonio to the north of San Agustin. On the morning of 19 August, Lee's men met Mexican pickets, which Major William W. Loring's companies cleared at Padierna, only to come under fire from Valencia's 22 pieces of artillery west of El Pedregal and north of Contreras. When told of the American movement across El Pedregal, Valencia exclaimed, \\"No! No! You're dreaming, man.\\" The U.S. forces took heavy casualties and Valencia thought at this point he was winning the encounter.Guardino, The Dead March, p. 245 Gideon Pillow then brought in his artillery, under the command of Capt. John B. Magruder, Lt. Franklin D. Callender, and Lt. Jesse L. Reno. In the meantime Col. Truman B. Ransom's 9th Infantry and Lt. Col. Milledge L. Bonham's 12th moved forward on the American right to within 200 yards of Valencia's camp by nightfall. Pillow also sent General Bennet Riley's brigade, supported by General George Cadwalader, to seize San Jer√≥nimo just north of Valencia's camp, while Persifor Smith's brigade, supported by General Franklin Pierce, struck Valencia from the front. Scott sent General James Shields brigade to Pillow who sent it after Cadwalader. Santa Anna was angered by Valencia's disobedience, but nonetheless sought to save his army. He moved with Brigadier General Francisco P√©rez's 3,000 man brigade to San √Ångel, just north of the fighting. Night brought a cold rain and the end of fighting for the day. The American forces had positioned themselves to block Santa Anna's approach to Valencia's army. Santa Anna wanted to fall back in an orderly fashion and ordered Valencia to abandon his artillery and retreat with his men and their smaller weapons. Valencia refused to obey the order.Guardino, The Dead March, p. 245 During the night, Lt. Zealous Bates Tower discovered a ravine running southwest from San Jer√≥nimo to the rear of Valencia's camp, which Smith planned to use for a dawn attack the next morning. Lee volunteered to cross the Pedregal during the night so Scott could coordinate a diversion using Twiggs. Twiggs did so at 5 AM, just as Smith struck Valencia from the rear. Valencia did not put sentries along in the ravines along the path the American forces took, perhaps because of worries of desertion.Guardino, The Dead March, p. 246. When the attack came, Mexican forces resisted fiercely, but within seventeen minutes, Valencia and his force fled to San √Ångel. Two of the cannons the American forces captured had been lost by Captain John P. O'Brien in bloody fighting at the Battle of Buena Vista in February 1847.Sandweiss, Eyewitness to War, p. 309. The U.S. forces captured 22 pieces of artillery and four generals. The contemporary newspaper dispatch by George Wilkins Kendall names the generals: Miguel Blanco de Estrada, Manuel Garc√≠a Pueblita, N. Mendoza, and former President of Mexico and brigadier general Jos√© Mariano Salas, called \\"the notorious\\" for organizing the Guerrillas of Vengeance against the Americans.Kendall, George Wilkins, Dispatches from the Mexican War [1846-47]. Lawrence Delbert Cress, ed. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press 1999, p. 330. \\"Valencia's repeated refusal to follow orders had led to the dissolution of Mexico's most experienced and disciplined regiments and exposed the rest of the army to the same possibility.\\"Guardino, The Dead March, p. 246. With the rout of Valencia, Twiggs' army was in full pursuit as they retreated toward Mexico City. Santa Anna had to fall to his second line of defense at fortifications he has created at the Churubusco River.Sandweiss, Eyewitness to War, p.311 He ordered Major General Nicol√°s Bravo at San Antonio and Brigadier General Antonio Gaona at Mexicalzingo both to fall back to Churubusco, where soon the Battle of Churubusco would commence.{{rp296} Scott commended Lee, who made three-night crossings across the Pedregal, stating it was \\"the greatest feat of physical and moral courage performed by any individual\\" during the campaign, and awarded Lee with a brevet rank of lieutenant colonel.Davis, Jefferson. Edited by Colonel Harold B. Simpson. Robert E. Lee The Hill Junior College Press. Hillsboro, Texas. 1960. Santa Anna issued his version of events of the battle on 23 August 1847, which appeared in English translation in the New Orleans Daily Picayune on 9 September. In it, he claimed that \\"it would have been equal to a defeat to have kept the troops in the open field.\\"quoted in Sandweiss, Eyewitness to War, p. 308. Memorialization of the battle Monument of the Mexican- American War in Ohio, listing the battle Despite the great victory at Contreras, there are few contemporaneous prints of the action. The most famous and easily accessible is by Carl Nebel. His image of the battle is one of twelve in all as illustrations for the 1851 publication The War between the United States and Mexico Illustrated, with journalist George Wilkins Kendall. Nebel's depiction is of the second day of battle, and is a generally accurate rendering of the topography. According to Kendall's written text, the image's focus is on the assault of Smith, Riley and Cadwalader.Sandweiss et al,Eyewitness to War pp. 308-09. On 20 August 1847, General Scott made a speech from which the first sixteen words have become important to the Regiment of Mounted Riflemen. The regiment was bloodied and exhausted from the fierce fighting at Contreras, but even so, each man stood at attention as Scott approached. The General removed his hat, bowed low, and said: \\"Brave Rifles! Veterans! You have been baptized in fire and blood and have come out steel!\\" This accolade is emblazoned on the regimental coat of arms, and is the source of the regimental motto, \\"Blood and Steel\\" and nickname, \\"Brave Rifles.\\"The regimental accolade Partial Mexican Order of Battle Division of the North ‚Äì General of division Gabriel Valencia * Engineers ‚Äì Gen.

Supporting characters include their children Rick Gordon (son of Flash), L.J. (son of Lothar), Kshin (adopted son of Mandrake), and Jedda Walker (daughter of the Phantom). The show lasted for 65 episodes; there was also a short-lived comic book series published by Star Comics (an imprint of Marvel Comics). The closing credits credit Rob Walsh and Tony Pastor for the main title music, and Stan Lee for the lyrics. The series was later shown in reruns on the Sci Fi Channel as part of Sci Fi's animation block, Cartoon Quest. Flash Gordon has also been seen in two other animated series: The New Adventures of Flash Gordon (1979‚Äì82), and Flash Gordon (1996‚Äì97). Premise Flash Gordon and his son Rick escape from Ming the Merciless, who has exhausted the natural resources of his home planet Mongo and desires to exploit Earth. Ming tries to brainwash Flash's wife Dale Arden, but she resists until death, whereafter her psyche is later included in the Defenders' supercomputer Dynac X. Later, Flash and Mandrake organize the Defenders against Ming. Characters=Protagonists The Defenders of the Earth *Flash Gordon (voiced by Lou Richards) ‚Äî Leader of the Defenders of the Earth: a space pilot and the father of Rick Gordon. *The Phantom (voiced by Peter Mark Richman) ‚Äî Essentially identical to Lee Falk's character, but differing from the original in that by chanting \\"By jungle law, the Ghost Who Walks calls forth the power of ten tigers\\", he momentarily receives superhuman strength. His real name is Kit Walker. His horse Hero and wolf Devil make brief appearances. The end credits describe this Phantom by saying \\"This is the 27th Phantom.\\" *Mandrake the Magician (voiced by Peter Renaday) ‚Äî A hypnotist and mystic capable of manipulating others' perceptions almost at will. He is often portrayed as a secondary leader of the Defenders, and sometimes the narrator of their decisions. *Lothar (voiced by Buster Jones) ‚Äî Mandrake's assistant and bodyguard, depicted as a powerful fighter, an able mechanic, and a master tactician. The action figure's packaging describes Lothar as a \\"Caribbean Ninja\\". * Richard \\"Rick\\" Gordon (voiced by Loren Lester) ‚Äî Richard is an impulsive computer genius and the son of Flash Gordon. Rick, along with many of the other teenagers of the show, attended Central High located in Central City. Rick Gordon was initially intended to be Kit Walker, the son of the Phantom. * L.J. (voiced by Dion Williams) ‚Äî Short for 'Lothar Jr.', L.J. is the street-wise martial arts expert son of Lothar, and Rick's best friend. When in one episode, the Defenders locate a crystal which shows them their greatest desires, L.J.'s is to defeat the antagonist Octon. * Jedda Walker (voiced by Sarah Partridge) ‚Äî Jedda is the daughter of the Phantom and displays telepathy and limited extrasensory powers, usually expressed by communication with her black panther Kisa. There is little-or-no mention of her mother, though in one episode she is the reluctant stepdaughter of Queen Hadea. Some installments imply a relationship with Rick Gordon. Jedda Walker was initially intended to be Jedda Gordon, daughter of Flash Gordon. * Kshin (voiced by Adam Carl) ‚Äî Kshin is an orphaned boy adopted by Mandrake and trained as his apprentice. His origins are revealed in the late season episode \\"The adoption of Kshin\\", where it is shown he was a young street orphan found by Mandrake after a gang of boys tried using him as a distraction in a failed pick-pocketing attempt. He is usually accompanied by the extraterrestrial \\"Zuffy\\", initially found by Rick Gordon on the planet Mongo. * Dynac X (voiced by Diane Pershing) ‚Äî Dynac X is the central computer of the Defenders' Headquarters, whose operating system is stated to contain the psyche of Flash Gordon's wife. Though she is never addressed by name in the series, the comic book adaptation of the first two episodes identifies the slain \\"Mrs. Gordon\\" as Dale Arden. Diane Pershing is the only performer from the Filmation cartoon who reprised her role. Antagonists *Ming the Merciless (voiced by Ron Feinberg) ‚Äî A warlord or supervillain bent on exploiting Earth's natural resources, based on 'Ice Station Earth'. This version is made more grotesque than his traditional appearance to avoid racial stereotyping; a similar treatment would be used on the Mandarin in the Iron Man animated series and on Dr. No in James Bond Jr., in that all three characters received green skin and pointed ears. ** Prince Kro-Tan ‚Äî Ming the Merciless' son ** Princess Castra ‚Äî Ming the Merciless' daughter ** Octon (voiced by William Callaway) ‚Äî an octopus-like artificial intelligence, equivalent to an 'evil version' of Dynac X, which advises Ming the Merciless of methods to conquer the Earth or defeat the Defenders. His name is derived from that of an opponent of Mandrake's in the latter's eponymous comic strip, wherein it identifies a crime lord also known as the Cobra. ** Garax (voiced by William Callaway) ‚Äî the leader of Ming's mechanical soldiers, the Ice Robots. He is the only one of these to recur, and the only given any distinction from the others, who are frequently slain en masse by the Defenders. ** Mongor ‚Äî a giant serpent-like pet of Ming the Merciless * Kurt Walker (voiced by William Callaway) ‚Äî Aliased \\"N'Dama the Weather Demon\\", Kurt is the older brother of the Phantom. When competing in a trial with Kit for the right to become the next Phantom, Kurt won but was passed-over in favor of Kit due his father knowing that he had lied and cheated, as well as abandoning his brother after causing a rock fall that had injured him. This results in him being disinherited by their father, and the contempt he has for Kit. Kurt is specifically created for the series and has never appeared elsewhere. * The Sky Band ‚Äî A coalition of raiders depicted in the Phantom comics; here depicted as space-pirates. * Queen Hadea ‚Äî ruler of the subterranean 'Netherworld', where she is the latest in a dynasty of monarchs served by pale, deformed humanoids. In her first appearance, Hadea desires to take the Phantom as a consort. After later offering to heal the injured Jedda Walker, she displays a brief interest in assuming a maternal role in the girl's life. Her great ambition is to capture the powerful 'Necklace of Oros', which confers control of others in the user's presence. * Graviton ‚Äî the original owner of the Necklace of Oros, and implied to have dwelt among the Moai of Rapa Nui, Graviton is an extradimensional being of unknown origins, who seeks to recover the Necklace from Earth and establish himself as a dictator. Production Marvel Productions and King Features Syndicate worked together to develop the show. Marvel Productions had brought in consulting company Q5 Corporation to help develop the show.

Career Hull was born at 68 Sutton's Dwellings, Adelaide Terrace, Benwell, Newcastle Upon Tyne.Oxford Dictionary of National Biography - Dave Laing He began piano lessons at the age of nine, and guitar lessons two years later.Obituary - The Times - 20 November 1995 He attended Rutherford Grammar School, Newcastle after passing the eleven-plus in 1956 and was given a guitar at the age of twelve. Hull wrote his first song soon afterwards. He became a member of the band The Chosen Few alongside keyboard player Mick Gallagher. He supported himself by working as a window cleaner, one year by working as a nurse at a mental hospital and as a driver for Newcastle Co-op TV Department while appearing as a folk singer and guitarist in local clubs before helping to form Brethren and Downtown Faction, which evolved into Lindisfarne in 1970. He also released a one-off solo single, \\"We Can Swing Together\\", which was re- recorded with the group on their first album, Nicely Out of Tune, and became a regular favourite in their stage performances. As the group's most prolific songwriter and joint lead vocalist, Hull came to be regarded as its leader. In 1972, dissatisfied with the sound and critical reception of their third album Dingly Dell, he considered leaving the group but instead he and joint lead vocalist Ray \\"Jacka\\" Jackson formed a new six-piece Lindisfarne the following year, leaving the three other original members to form Jack The Lad. He also released his first solo album, Pipedream, the same year and published a book of poems, Mocking Horse. Alan Hull appeared in \\"Squire\\", an episode of the BBC's Second City Firsts drama series. Lindisfarne disbanded in 1973 and Hull released a second solo album, Squire, then formed the short-lived Radiator, which also included drummer Ray Laidlaw of Lindisfarne and Jack the Lad. In March 1977 the original line-up of Lindisfarne reformed after a well-received series of sold-out Christmas shows at the Newcastle City Hall in 1976 which was broadcast on local radio. Thereafter he combined his musical career as front man of the group with a solo career. He was also a staunch Labour Party activist. For a time he was secretary of his local constituency Labour Party. He performed in Blackpool to coincide with the Labour Party conference in 1990 and played at numerous benefit concerts for striking or redundant miners and shipyard workers. In January 1994, he recorded Back to Basics, a live all- acoustic survey of the best of his songwriting from 1970 onwards. Death On the night of 17 November 1995, Hull suddenly collapsed at his home in North Shields and was pronounced dead on arrival at North Tyneside General Hospital at 11.30pm. A post-mortem held on 20 November revealed his death to be the result of a Coronary thrombosis. Hull's funeral was held on 24 November at North Shields Crematorium. Musician Chris Rea and actor Tim Healy were among the famous names to attend. Hull's ashes were later scattered at the mouth of the River Tyne. On 19 July 2012, following a public campaign led by Barry McKay, Lindisfarne's manager during the 1970s, an Alan Hull memorial plaque was unveiled on the front of Newcastle City Hall, at a ceremony attended by hundreds of fans, and broadcast and filmed by Sky and ITV Tyne Tees. When he died, Hull was working on a new album, Statues & Liberties. Personal life He married Patricia Sharp on 22 August 1966, and they had three daughters.

Several successful boxing trainers, including Teddy Atlas and Kevin Rooney, were tutored by D'Amato. He was a proponent of the peek-a-boo style of boxing, in which the fighter holds his gloves close to his cheeks and pulls his arms tight against his torso, which was criticized by some because it was believed that an efficient attack could not be launched from it. Early life Constantine D'Amato was born into an Italian-American family in the New York City borough of the Bronx on January 17, 1908. His father, Damiano, delivered ice and coal in the Bronx using a horse and cart. At a young age, D'Amato became very involved and interested in Catholicism, and even considered becoming a priest during his youth. He had a brief career as an amateur boxer, fighting as a featherweight and lightweight, but was unable to get a professional license because of an eye injury he had suffered in a street fight. This was documented in the biographic novel Confusing The Enemy. Confusing The Enemy Career At age 22, D'Amato opened the Empire Sporting Club with Jack Barrow at the Gramercy Gym. He lived in the gym for years. According to D'Amato, he spent his time at the gym waiting for a \\"champion\\", but his best fighters were routinely poached by \\"connected\\" managers. One fighter discovered by D'Amato was Italian-American Rocky Graziano, who signed with other trainers and managers and went on to become middleweight champion of the world. D'Amato also confronted boxing politics and decided, along with his friend Howard Cosell, to thwart the International Boxing Club of New York (IBC). Suspicious to the point of paranoia, he refused to match his fighter in any bout promoted by the IBC. The IBC was eventually found to be in violation of anti-trust laws and was dissolved. Personal life In the early 1970s, while looking for a mansion big enough to accommodate about 12 of his most aspiring trainees and occasionally receive around 50 others, D'Amato (then in his 60s) met his wife-to-be Camille Ewald; she was thinking about selling her house, a 14-room Victorian mansion, after her family left. D'Amato came around and made a proposition to her. He oversaw all the training and managing of his fighters, while she was responsible for cooking and household chores.Watch Me Now: A Documentary by Michael Marton (1983). Notable boxers trained=Floyd Patterson D'Amato and Patterson in 1957 D'Amato and Patterson in 1961 Under D'Amato's tutelage, Floyd Patterson captured the Olympic middleweight gold medal in the 1952 Helsinki games. D'Amato then guided Patterson through the professional ranks, manoeuvring Patterson into fighting for the title vacated by Rocky Marciano. After beating Tommy \\"Hurricane\\" Jackson in an elimination fight, Patterson faced Light Heavyweight Champion Archie Moore on November 30, 1956, for the World Heavyweight Championship. He beat Moore by a knockout in five rounds and became the youngest World Heavyweight Champion in history at the time, at the age of 21 years, 10 months, three weeks and five days. He was the first Olympic gold medalist to win a professional Heavyweight title. Patterson and D'Amato split after Patterson's second consecutive 1st-round KO loss to Sonny Liston, although his influence over the former two-time champion had already begun to diminish. Jos√© Torres D'Amato also managed Jos√© Torres who in May 1965 at Madison Square Garden, defeated the International Boxing Hall Of Fame member, Willie Pastrano, to become world Light Heavyweight champion. With the victory Torres became the third Puerto Rican world boxing champion in history and the first Latin American to win the world Light Heavyweight title. Mike Tyson After Patterson and Torres' careers ended, D'Amato worked in relative obscurity. He eventually moved to Catskill, New York, where he opened a gym, the Catskill Boxing Club. There he met and began to work with the future heavyweight champion, \\"Iron\\" Mike Tyson, who was in a nearby reform school. He adopted Tyson after Tyson's mother died. D'Amato trained him over the next few years, encouraging the use of peek-a-boo style boxing, with the hands in front of the face for more protection. D'Amato was briefly assisted by Teddy Atlas, and later Kevin Rooney, a prot√©g√© of D'Amato, who emphasized elusive movement. It is unclear at exactly which age (11 or 12) Tyson first became seriously interested in becoming a professional boxer. \\"Irish\\" Bobby Stewart, a former Golden Gloves Champion, was approached by Tyson while working as a counselor at the Tryon School For Boys. Tyson knew of Stewart's former boxing glory and specifically asked to speak with Stewart who immediately took on a gruff attitude of the subject after witnessing Tyson's terrible behavior in his first days at the school. Bobby Stewart introduced Mike Tyson to D'Amato when Tyson was around 12 or 13 years old, after Stewart stated he had taught Tyson all he could about boxing technique and skill.Heller, Peter(1988). \\"Bad Intentions: The Mike Tyson Story,\\" p. 13. Da Capo Press, New York, 1988. D'Amato died a little over a year before Tyson became the youngest world heavyweight titleholder in history at the age of 20 years four months, thus supplanting Patterson's record. Rooney would later guide Tyson to the heavyweight championship twelve months after D'Amato's death. Footage of D'Amato can be seen in Tyson, a 2008 documentary. Tyson credits D'Amato with building his confidence and guiding him as a father figure. Death D'Amato died of pneumonia at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan on November 4, 1985. He was 77.

A May Ball is a ball at the end of the academic year that takes place at any of the colleges of the University of Cambridge. They are elaborate and lavish formal affairs, requiring black tie or sometimes white tie, with ticket prices ranging from around ¬£100 to as much as ¬£640 for a pair of dining tickets at Trinity. May Ball budgets (excluding VAT) generally exceed ¬£100,000, although some are as high as ¬£400,000 (St John's) or even more. The balls are held in the colleges, starting around from 6-9 p.m. and lasting until well after dawn. \\"Survivors photographs\\" are taken of those who last until morning. Other colleges frequently hold winter balls, such as the popular Selwyn Snowball, who recently had acts such Tinchy Stryder and Mumford and Sons headlining. History A photo taken the morning after a May Ball in 1906 including Siegfried Sassoon and his brother Hamo The tradition of May Balls in Cambridge started in the 1830s with the first official one being the First and Third Trinity Boat Club May Ball in 1866. It is thought they developed from the celebrations surrounding successes in the May Bumps - a set of rowing races which used to take place before the university tripos examinations in May each year. The balls and the other celebrations which make up May Week (such as June Events and garden parties) moved from May to June in 1882, and still take place in June, after examinations, but the name has been retained.\\"We had a Ball\\" - William Ham Bevan. Cambridge Alumni Magazine, Issue 72 (Easter 2014) By the 1890s, King's and Clare were holding regular balls, and the first St Catharine's Ball dates from 1929. As the 20th century progressed the formula of the balls varied very little until the 1960s, when students began to question both the cost and perceived stuffiness. Around this time, some colleges began to augment the traditional dance orchestras with rock bands, and by the end of the 1970s the focus of the majority had shifted towards booking rock acts. As the all-male colleges began to allow female students, the ubiquitous double tickets began to be bought by pairs of students rather than inviting a date from outside of the university, causing a corresponding reduction in ticket sales; in 1991 Sidney Sussex and Downing merged balls, and in 1992 Pembroke cancelled its ball. When in 1993 there were a reported 16,000 tickets available to an undergraduate population of 10,000, Selwyn, Emmanuel, Girton and Peterhouse were all forced to cancel their balls, though Trinity and Magdalene sold out as usual. The solution was for most of the smaller balls to hold events every other year, and by the 2000s only Trinity, St John's, Clare, and Jesus were still holding annual May Balls. They fell out of popularity with the students in the 1990s, but this trend has since reversed and tickets now sell out in record time. Local businesses also now seek to get involved and the local punting companies put on special night-time tours to allow people to watch the John's and Trinity College firework displays on the Backs from the River Cam - the river usually becomes gridlocked for these evenings during May Week. Colleges hosting balls Many Cambridge colleges originally held the balls in May, sometimes in the week preceding year-end exams. Today, they take place in May Week, which usually starts on the second Thursday of June following the end of exams, and which includes Suicide Sunday. The balls operate a strict dress code. Magdalene and Peterhouse insist on white tie, which is recommended but not required at Trinity, while all the others have a minimum of only black tie. Most balls are themed, though Magdalene, Peterhouse, and Trinity's are notable for their lack of a theme. Guests queue to enter First and Third Trinity Boat Club May Ball Queens' College held its 100th May Ball in 2013 Jesus College May Ball 2012 Jesus College May Ball in 2007. The First and Third Trinity Boat Club May Ball (named after the boat club, but now run by Trinity College), held on the first Monday of May Week, and the St John's May Ball, held on the first Tuesday. Magdalene and Peterhouse hold exclusive white tie balls. Other desirable May balls are held annually by Clare, which has some of the most beautiful gardens, Jesus, whose ball is popular amongst first year students, and Queens', whose balls are well known for finding soon-to-be- famous up and coming acts (see Performances below). Robinson hosts the first ball of May Week, and is also one of the least expensive black tie balls, but still provides an extravagant start to May Week. St Edmund's hosts the final ball of May Week and is known for attracting finalists and postgraduates, and also for never running out of drinks. Christ's is known for securing high- profile acts. The latest addition to May Week will come on Saturday 20 June 2015 as Selwyn hosts a May Ball for the first time since 2008. Trinity, Clare and St John's are situated directly on the River Cam, along the Backs, as are Queens', Magdalene and Trinity Hall. As a result, when several balls are held on the same evening, the river is lit up in different colours from the lights and the fireworks, creating a memorable backdrop to the evening's festivities. Annual balls are held by Clare, Darwin, Hughes Hall, Jesus, St Edmund's, Robinson, Trinity and St John's; while Magdalene, Pembroke, Emmanuel, Corpus Christi, Christ's, Downing, Girton, Gonville and Caius, Homerton, Newnham, Queens', Sidney Sussex, Selwyn, and St Catharine's hold May Balls every two years. Most balls have fundamental similarities: all will offer guests a variety of food, entertainment, and a selection of alcoholic drinks. The quality and diversity of all of these vary markedly between different balls. While all claim to offer luxury (and many deliver), some have distinctive hallmarks: Peterhouse is famed for its ferris wheel, Magdalene for its dining, Trinity for its exceptional fireworks and flame display, Clare for its entertainment lineup and St John's and Robinson for its party atmosphere. Often the balls have overarching themes, sometimes they are fancy dress. Ball entertainment is a closely guarded secret, not least because of the fear that other committees will 'free ride' by booking an act already booked at another ball and thus have to pay a reduced fee because the band is in Cambridge already, whilst simultaneously devaluing the 'get' by the initial contractor. This was seen in 2010 when Two Door Cinema Club performed at four separate balls. Partly for this reason, ball line-ups are not usually announced until the night of the ball, although they tend to leak out fairly early. Ball crashing Colleges with larger May balls pay considerable attention to security and the prevention of ball crashing. With tickets priced at over ¬£150 and in short supply, students often try to gain unauthorized access, climbing high walls, arriving dressed as gorillas pretending to be part of the evening's entertainment, and posing as journalists. Typically, college porters are joined by both student and professional security staff and, at larger balls, police to identify and apprehend the crashers. Some colleges have painted walls with anti-burglar paint, which stains the crashers' clothes with luminous green paint, making it somewhat difficult to blend in. More courageous crashers can be seen swimming down the river Cam holding their clothes in a plastic bag above the water in an attempt to enter colleges from the banks. As part of the security arrangements, students living in parts of the college and not attending the May Ball are often required either to vacate their rooms or remain in them without leaving overnight, in spite of the inevitable loud music. Alternatives Guests watching a fireshow at King's June Event, 2006 Several colleges host a variation on these balls, a June Event. These are cheaper (¬£60-90), tend to be focused on live music, and frequently have less formal dress codes. Some colleges alternate June events and May balls from year to year. Trinity Hall, Newnham and Wolfson hold June events. In 2018 Wolfson held a May Ball instead. King's holds an annual event known as the \\"King's Affair\\" ‚Äî like the June events it is cheaper and has a reputation for \\"Beats not Bollinger\\"; guests are invited to wear any costume they choose. With seven different music stages focusing mainly on new DJs the atmosphere is perhaps more akin to some festivals. The college used to hold a traditional May Ball, but this was banned by the local police after The Stranglers played in the 1970s and caused a crush. In order to spread the fun throughout the year, a number of colleges have broken with tradition to hold balls at different times, normally either in the winter at the end of Michaelmas term, i.e. the beginning of December, or in spring at the end of Lent term. Selwyn is the only college to hold a yearly winter ball, known as the Snowball; in 2008 Selwyn also held a May Ball to celebrate its 125th Birthday and did so again in 2015 and 2017. Cambridge University Law Society also holds a well-regarded yearly winter ball. Fitzwilliam holds winter balls every two years, the most recent being November 2018. Of the spring balls, that of Girton is held biennially at the end of Lent term in March, whereas Churchill continues to produce an annual ball in the middle of Lent term every February.

A pioneer of social justice and a renowned national speaker, Doherty was also a prolific writer of hundreds of articles, best- selling author of dozens of books, and a dedicated wife and mother. Her cause for canonization as a saint is under consideration by the Catholic Church.Catherine Doherty: Her Life, catherinedoherty.org Early life Doherty was born Ekaterina Fyodorovna Kolyschkine (–ï–∫–∞—Ç–µ—Ä–∏–Ω–∞ –§—ë–¥–æ—Ä–æ–≤–Ω–∞ –ö–æ–ª—ã—à–∫–∏–Ω–∞) in Nizhny Novgorod, Russian Empire. Her parents, Fyodor and Emma Thomson Kolyschkine, belonged to the minor nobility and were devout members of the Russian Orthodox Church who had their child baptized in St. Petersburg on September 15, 1896. She was not baptized on the same day that she was born because her mother was worried she might get a disease as she had been born on a train. Schooled abroad due to her father's job, she had an exposure to the Catholic Church in the form of her schooling in Alexandria (Egypt) where her father, an aristocrat, had been posted by the government.Murray PP, John, \\"Servant of God: Catherine de Hueck Doherty\\", The Messenger, July 2007 Her family returned to St. Petersburg in 1910, where she was enrolled in the prestigious Princess Obolensky Academy. In 1912, aged 15, she married her first cousin, Boris de Hueck (1889‚Äì1947). At the outbreak of World War I, Catherine de Hueck became a Red Cross nurse at the front, experiencing the horrors of battle firsthand. On her return to St. Petersburg, she and Boris barely escaped the turmoil of the Russian Revolution with their lives, nearly starving to death as refugees in Finland. Together they made their way to England, where de Hueck was received into the Catholic Church on November 27, 1919. Emigrating to Canada with Boris, de Hueck gave birth to their only child, George, in Toronto in 1921. To make ends meet, she took various jobs, eventually traveling across the United States, giving talks on the Chautauqua lecture circuit.Fay, Terence J., History of Canadian Catholics, McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP, 2002 Friendship House Prosperous now, but deeply dissatisfied with a life of material comfort, her marriage in ruins, de Hueck began to feel the promptings of a deeper call through a passage that leaped to her eyes every time she opened the Bible: \\"Arise ‚Äî go... sell all you possess... take up your cross and follow Me.\\" Consulting with various priests and the bishop of the diocese, she began her lay apostolate among the poor. In 1932, she gave up all her possessions, lived among the multitude of poor people in downtown Toronto and established Friendship House with its soup kitchen. She gave food to them when she had none for herself ‚Äì and offered Catholic education and fellowship, too. She was tagged as a communist sympathizer and, beleaguered by her own organization,Jacobs, Donna,\\"The Unlikely Story of Catherine de Hueck\\", The Ottawa Citizen; July 9, 2007 Friendship House was forced to close in 1936. Catherine then went to Europe and spent a year investigating Catholic Action. On her return, she established the Friendship House at 34 West 135th Street in Harlem in 1937. The interracial charity center, in addition to distributing goods to the poor, conducted lectures and discussions to promote racial understanding.New York Times obituary, December 16, 1985 In 1943, having received an annulment of her first marriage, as she had married her cousin, which is forbidden in the Roman Catholic Church, she married Eddie Doherty, an American journalist, whom she had met when he was writing a story about her.Murray, John. \\"Servant of God: Catherine de Hueck Doherty\\", Catholic Ireland, November 30, 1999 Madonna House Serious disagreements arose between the staff of Friendship House and its foundress, particularly surrounding her marriage. When these could not be resolved, Doherty and Eddie moved to Combermere, Ontario, on May 17, 1947 to retire. As she recovered, she started to serve the needs of the community. What eventually blossomed was a new rural apostolate called Madonna House that now numbers approximately 200 staff workers with 17 missionary field-houses throughout the world.\\"About us\\", Madonna House Death Catherine de Hueck Doherty died in Combermere, on December 14, 1985, at the age of 89. Since then, the cause for her canonization as a saint has been officially opened in the Catholic Church.Pelton, Fr.

Only by being hidden would I be a light to my neighbor‚Äôs feet in the slums,\\" Doherty wrote. She believed that activism should be rooted in prayer and that faith should be brought to every aspect of daily life.LaPointe, Fr. Larry, \\"Catherine de Hueck Doherty\\", Connecticut College \\"The Little Mandate\\" The core of Doherty's spirituality is summarized in a \\"distillation\\" of the Gospel which she called \\"The Little Mandate\\" ‚Äî words which she believed she received from Jesus Christ and which guided her life.Doherty, Catherine. \\"The Little Mandate\\", Chap. 13 in Sobornost: Experiencing Unity of Mind, Heart and Soul , 2nd ed.

Duty of the moment A central theme in Doherty's spirituality is \\"the duty of the moment\\". As she herself put it: > The duty of the moment is what you should be doing at any given time, in > whatever place God has put you. You may not have Christ in a homeless person > at your door, but you may have a little child. If you have a child, your > duty of the moment may be to change a dirty diaper. So you do it.

Publication history While trolls can be found throughout folklores worldwide, the D&D; troll has little in common with these.

Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes, (Wizards of the Coast, 2018) Ecology=Environment Trolls are most often found in cold, mountainous regions, but can be encountered nearly anywhere. Typical physical characteristics The average troll stands nine feet high and weighs roughly 500 pounds, though females tend to be a bit larger than males. The hide of trolls is rubbery, and usually either moss green, putrid grey, or mottled gray and green. Their coarse hair is typically iron grey, or greenish- black. Trolls initially seem to be somewhat shorter, due to their sagging shoulders and tendency to hunch forward. They walk with an uneven gait, and their arms dangle and drag the ground when running. Despite this apparent awkwardness, trolls are quite agile. Trolls are infamous for their regenerative abilities, able to recover from the most grievous of wounds or regenerate entire limbs given time. Severing a troll's head results merely in temporary incapacitation, rather than death. After cutting off a troll's head or other limbs, one must seal the wounds with fire or acid to prevent regeneration. Because of this, most adventurers will typically carry some sort of implement capable of creating fire. Alignment Trolls are usually chaotic evil. Society Trolls speak Giant, and usually worship Vaprak the Destroyer.

Critical reception The troll was ranked second among the ten best mid-level monsters by the authors of Dungeons & Dragons For Dummies. The authors described the troll as \\"a great mid-level monster that can challenge heroes for a number of levels\\" noting that \\"the troll is the players' first introduction to a regenerating monster ‚Äì a creature that's almost impossible to kill unless you've got fire handy\\".

PSIP also supersedes the A/55 and A/56 protocol methods of delivering program guide information (which the ATSC has deleted). TV Guide On Screen is a different, proprietary system provided by datacasting on a single station, while PSIP is required, at least in the United States, to be sent by every digital television station. PSIP information may be passed through the airchain using proprietary protocols or through use of the Programming Metadata Communication Protocol metadata scheme.  Programming Metadata Communication Protocol  PMCP, defined in the Advanced Television Systems Committee's A/76B, provides ATSC broadcasters with a standardized means to exchange system information (SI) among systems that create and manage these data elements. These systems can be outside Program listing services, program management systems, traffic (commercial and program scheduling) and broadcast automation systems, which all contribute a portion of the PSIP data to a PSIP Generator. At the heart of PMCP is an XML Schema (actually a collection of XML Schema Definition files), which provide a standardized structure into which PSI and PSIP-related data may be exchanged. PMCP does not dictate systems' internal database structures; it is simply a platform-independent protocol for the exchange of data. PMCP was first published as A/76 in November 2004, and enjoys adoption from a variety of broadcast equipment and system vendors. Two revisions (largely backwards- compatible) with the standard have been made. ATSC A/76a extended PMCP to include metadata necessary for proper signaling of ACAP data broadcast elements, and A/76B, was released in 2007, fixed some errors and made the schema usable with the related SMPTE S2021 (BXF) schema.

The Official Solicitor acts for people who, because they lack mental capacity and cannot properly manage their own affairs, are unable to represent themselves and no other suitable person or agency is able or willing to act. The Official Solicitor acts for England & Wales only, as Scotland and Northern Ireland have separate legal systems and judiciaries. Historically, states have recognised the need for representation of an incapacitated person when a benevolent relative or friend cannot be found to act on his behalf, this is the function of the Office of the Official Solicitor. The Official Solicitor becomes formally involved when appointed by the Court, and he can act as his own solicitor, or instruct a private firm of solicitors to represent him. The Official Solicitor has two main functions. Firstly, in England and Wales, his main function is to represent minors who are incapable of representing themselves in the High Court and in the Court of Protection. He also acts as last resort personal representative for the estate of a deceased person, or trustee of a trust. Secondly, in the area of international child protection obligations to which the UK government is a signatory, the Official Solicitor deals with cases brought under the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction through the International Child Abduction and Contact Unit (ICACU). In this capacity it deals with international child abduction and contact issues and handles maintenance enforcement in cases where one parent lives outside the UK through the Reciprocal Enforcement of Maintenance Orders Unit (REMO).Official Solicitor Background and history The development of the functions of the Official Solicitor can be traced back to the 18th century when the Office of the Six Clerks, which is mentioned in Samuel Pepys‚Äô Diary, assisted destitute litigants, lunatics and infants in Chancery suits and this form of support continued until the modern system of legal funding came into effect. In 1842, the Office of the Six Clerks was abolished by the Court of Chancery Act and John Johnson was appointed Solicitor to the Suitors‚Äô Fund by the Lord Chancellor to represent ‚Äòpaupers, infants and lunatics‚Äô where there was no ‚Äònatural protector‚Äô. By an order dated 4 December 1871, Lord Chancellor Hatherley appointed Henry Pemberton to be the Official Solicitor to the High Court of Chancery in England and directed him to perform the duties formerly carried out by the Solicitor to the Suitors' Fund, although by 1875 the original duties of the office of Solicitor to the Suitors' Fund had largely disappeared. The present office was created by an Order of the Lord Chancellor made on the 6 November 1875 with the approval of the Presidents of the newly constituted divisions of the High Court and of the Treasury, under the power given to him by Section 84 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873 to appoint officers to serve the Supreme Court generally. Lord Chancellor Cairns by an order dated 7 February 1876 then appointed Henry Pemberton to be The Official Solicitor to the Supreme Court of Judicature.Official Solicitor Episodes in which the Official Solicitor has intervened have generally arisen when there has been a legal stalemate. In 1921 the Official Solicitor intervened to arrange the release from prison of a female Labour councillor from Poplar who had been imprisoned along with most of the members of Poplar Borough Council, for having refused to raise the rates, arguing that the poor inhabitants of Poplar could not afford to pay any more. In 1972 the Official Solicitor, Norman Turner, broke a legal stalemate between the Trades Union Congress and the government known as the Pentonville Five case, in which five shop stewards from the dockers' union were imprisoned on a charge of contempt.Daily Telegraph, Obituary, Norman Turner The Official Solicitor was also called upon by the Secretary of State for the Department of Trade and Industry to deal with the issue of pirate radio broadcasting by Radio Caroline. The present legal basis of the Office of the Official Solicitor dates from 1981 when, under s.90 of the Supreme Court Act 1981, that the Official Solicitor became a statutory officer of the then-Supreme Court of England and Wales appointed by the Lord Chancellor under the name of Official Solicitor to the Supreme Court. The offices of the Official Solicitor to the Supreme Court and the Public Trustee are now housed in one office building, but they continue to have separate functions. On 1 April 2007 the Official Solicitor and Public Trustee merged with the Court Funds Office to become the Offices of Court Funds, Official Solicitor and Public Trustee. This new organisation was an associated office of the Ministry of Justice. They were split up again on 1 April 2009. The new Supreme Court of the United Kingdom was established under the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 and came into effect in October 2009, separating the judicial and law-making functions of the House of Lords for the first time. In October 2009, the 12 Law Lords who hear appeals in Parliament became the first Justices of the Supreme Court. At the same time, the Supreme Court of England and Wales is renamed the Senior Courts of England and Wales, and the Official Solicitor to the Supreme Court became the Official Solicitor to the Senior Courts. International Child Abduction and Contact Unit The International Child Abduction and Contact Unit (ICACU) is the section of the Office of the Official Solicitor that is the Central Authority of England and Wales for international child abduction and contact issues under the terms of the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction and the European Convention on Recognition and Enforcement of Decisions Concerning Custody of Children and on Restoration of Custody of Children.

He played college football for Minnesota. He is a one-time world champion in professional wrestling. Early life Nomellini was born at Lucca, Tuscany, Italy, and immigrated to the United States as an infant to Minnesota, before later moving to Chicago, Illinois where he attended Crane High School. After high school, he joined the Marine Corps. It was there that in 1942, he first started playing football. After the war, he received a football scholarship to the University of Minnesota, where be became a two-time All-American and the 49ers' first-ever NFL draft choice in 1950. While at Minnesota, Nomellini was a member of Delta Chi fraternity.1949 Minnesota Gopher yearbook, p.388, accessed 12 Aug 2020. Professional career Nomellini was selected in the 1st round (11th overall) of the 1950 NFL draft, the first draft pick in the history of the San Francisco 49ers. As a professional, he appeared in 174 regular-season games and started 166 for his 14-year career. While with the 49ers, he played both offensive and defensive tackle, winning All-Pro honors at both positions. He was selected to the All-NFL team six times: two years on offense and four years on defense. \\"He was as strong as three bulls,\\" said 49ers teammate Joe Perry. \\"He'd slap you on the back and knock you twenty feet.\\" Nomellini was named to the NFL's all-time team as a defensive tackle. In 1969, he was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame and in 1977, the College Football Hall of Fame. Professional wrestling=NWA San Francisco During the off-season Nomellini often wrestled professionally as Leo \\"The Lion\\" Nomellini debuting in Minnesota in 1950. For his career, he was a 10-time tag team champion. He won his first tag team championship in NWA San Francisco on March 14, 1952 when he teamed Hombre Montana. The duo defeated Mike Sharpe and Ben Sharpe for the NWA World Tag Team Championship (San Francisco version) . Four months later, Nomellini and Gino Garibaldi won the NWA Pacific Coast Tag Team Championship. In April 1953, Nomellini regained the NWA Pacific Coast Tag Team Championship while teaming with Enrique Torres when they defeated Fred and Ray Atkins. Nomellini and Torres defeated the Mike and Ben Sharpe on May 6, 1953 for the NWA World Tag Team Championship (San Francisco version). On May 11, 1954 Nomellini teamed with Rocky Brown to defeat the Sharpes and win the NWA World Tag Team Championship (San Francisco version). In 1957, Nomellini, again teaming with Torres, defeated Lord James Blears and Ben Sharpe for the NWA World Tag Team Championship (San Francisco version). While working for the National Wrestling Alliance, Nomellini once defeated Lou Thesz in a two-out- of-three falls match, but was not awarded the NWA World Heavyweight Championship because the first fall was a disqualification. NWA Minneapolis Wrestling and Boxing Club/American Wrestling Association Nomellini would leave NWA San Francisco to head to Minnesota to work for Verne Gagne and the NWA Minneapolis Wrestling and Boxing Club. On May 15, 1958, Nomellini, teaming with Verne Gange defeated Mike and Doc Gallagher for the NWA World Tag Team Championship (Minneapolis version). He would win the title again on July 14, 1959 while teaming with Butch Levy and defeated Karol and Ivan Kalmikoff. He would win it for the last time on July 19, 1960, once again teaming with Gagne and defeating Stan Kowalski and Tiny Mills.

For example, the yield on a three-month Treasury bill six months from now is a forward rate.. Forward rate calculation To extract the forward rate, we need the zero-coupon yield curve. We are trying to find the future interest rate r_{1,2} for time period (t_1, t_2), t_1 and t_2 expressed in years, given the rate r_1 for time period (0, t_1) and rate r_2 for time period (0, t_2). To do this, we use the property that the proceeds from investing at rate r_1 for time period (0, t_1) and then reinvesting those proceeds at rate r_{1,2} for time period (t_1, t_2) is equal to the proceeds from investing at rate r_2 for time period (0, t_2). r_{1,2} depends on the rate calculation mode (simple, yearly compounded or continuously compounded), which yields three different results. Mathematically it reads as follows: Simple rate : (1+r_1t_1)(1+ r_{1,2}(t_2-t_1)) = 1+r_2t_2 Solving for r_{1,2} yields: Thus r_{1,2} = \\\\frac{1}{t_2-t_1}\\\\left(\\\\frac{1+r_2t_2}{1+r_1t_1}-1\\\\right) The discount factor formula for period (0, t) \\\\Delta_t expressed in years, and rate r_t for this period being DF(0, t)=\\\\frac{1}{(1+r_t \\\\, \\\\Delta_t)}, the forward rate can be expressed in terms of discount factors: r_{1,2} = \\\\frac{1}{t_2-t_1}\\\\left(\\\\frac{DF(0, t_1)}{DF(0, t_2)}-1\\\\right) Yearly compounded rate : (1+r_1)^{t_1}(1+r_{1,2})^{t_2-t_1} = (1+r_2)^{t_2} Solving for r_{1,2} yields : : r_{1,2} = \\\\left(\\\\frac{(1+r_2)^{t_2}}{(1+r_1)^{t_1}}\\\\right)^{1/(t_2-t_1)} - 1 The discount factor formula for period (0,t) \\\\Delta_t expressed in years, and rate r_t for this period being DF(0, t)=\\\\frac{1}{(1+r_t)^{\\\\Delta_t}}, the forward rate can be expressed in terms of discount factors: : r_{1,2}=\\\\left(\\\\frac{DF(0, t_1)}{DF(0, t_2)}\\\\right)^{1/(t_2-t_1)}-1 Continuously compounded rate :EQUATION‚Üí e^{{(r}_2\\\\ast t_2)}=e^{{(r}_1\\\\ast t_1)}\\\\ast\\\\ e^{\\\\left(r_{1,2}\\\\ast\\\\left(t_2-t_1\\\\right)\\\\right)} Solving for r_{1,2} yields: :STEP 1‚Üí e^{{(r}_2\\\\ast t_2)}=e^{{(r}_1\\\\ast t_1)+\\\\left(r_{1,2}\\\\ast\\\\left(t_2-t_1\\\\right)\\\\right)} :STEP 2‚Üí \\\\ln{\\\\left(e^{{(r}_2\\\\ast t_2)}\\\\right)}=\\\\ln{\\\\left(e^{{(r}_1\\\\ast t_1)+\\\\left(r_{1,2}\\\\ast\\\\left(t_2-t_1\\\\right)\\\\right)}\\\\right)} :STEP 3‚Üí {(r}_2\\\\ast\\\\ t_2)={(r}_1\\\\ast\\\\ t_1)+\\\\left(r_{1,2}\\\\ast\\\\left(t_2-t_1\\\\right)\\\\right) :STEP 4‚Üí r_{1,2}\\\\ast\\\\left(t_2-t_1\\\\right)={(r}_2\\\\ast\\\\ t_2)-{(r}_1\\\\ast\\\\ t_1) :STEP 5‚Üí r_{1,2}=\\\\frac{{(r}_2\\\\ast t_2)-{(r}_1\\\\ast t_1)}{t_2-t_1} The discount factor formula for period (0,t) \\\\Delta_t expressed in years, and rate r_t for this period being DF(0, t)=e^{-r_t\\\\,\\\\Delta_t}, the forward rate can be expressed in terms of discount factors: : r_{1,2} = \\\\frac{1}{t_2-t_1}(\\\\ln DF(0, t_1) - \\\\ln DF(0, t_2)) r_{1,2} is the forward rate between time t_1 and time t_2 , r_k is the zero-coupon yield for the time period (0, t_k) , (k = 1,2).

Telepen is a name of a barcode symbology designed in 1972 in the UK to express all 128 ASCII characters without using shift characters for code switching, and using only two different widths for bars and spaces. (Unlike Code 128, which uses shifts and four different element widths.) Unlike most linear barcodes, Telepen does not define independent encodings for each character, but instead operates on a stream of bits. It is able to represent any bit stream containing an even number of 0 bits, and is applied to ASCII bytes with even parity, which satisfy that rule. Bytes are encoded in little-endian bit order. The string of bits is divided into 1 bits, and blocks of the form 01*0\\\\. That is, blocks beginning an ending with a 0 bit, with any number of 1 bits in between. These are then encoded as follows: * \\"1\\" is encoded as narrow bar-narrow space * \\"00\\" is encoded as wide bar-narrow space * \\"010\\" is encoded as wide bar-wide space * Otherwise, the leading \\"01\\" and trailing \\"10\\" are both encoded as narrow bar-wide space, with additional 1 bits in between coded as described above. Wide elements are 3 times the width of narrow elements, so every bit occupies 2 narrow elements of space. Bar codes always start with ASCII _ (underscore). This has code 0x5F, so the (lsbit-first) bit stream is 11111010. Thus, it is represented as 5 narrow bar/narrow space pairs, followed by a wide bar/wide space. Bar codes always end with ASCII z. This has (including parity) code 0xFA, so the (lsbit-first) bit stream is 01011111. This is encoded as a wide bar/wide space, followed by 5 narrow bar/narrow space pairs. Each end of the bar code consists of repeated narrow elements terminated by a pair of wide elements, but the start has a wide bar first, while if the code is read in reverse, the wide space will be encountered first. In addition to per- character parity bits, a telepen symbol also includes an overall modulo-127 checksum.

It consists of fifteen levels,http://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/2008/03/uridium_virtual_console each named after a metal element, with the last level being called Uridium (a fictional metallic element, not to be confused with the real metallic element iridium). The manual quotes Robert Orchard, who invented the name as saying \\"I really thought it existed.\\" Uridium was later released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1990. Mindscape purchased a license to release a game based on the film The Last Starfighter.https://www.retrogamer.net/retro_games80/the-making-of-uridium/ Rather than program a new game, however, Mindscape decided to take an easier route by recycling an older, relatively obscure game. The title screen, sprites, and soundtrack were modified, but the levels and gameplay were identical. In 2003, it was re-released on the C64 Direct-to-TV. In 2008, the C64 version was announced as a title on the Wii Virtual Console.Commodore 64 coming to Virtual Console On 28 March 2008, Uridium was released for the Virtual Console in Europe, costing 500 Wii Points. Plot The plot of Uridium is described as follows: > The solar system is under attack! Enemy Super-Dreadnoughts have been placed > in orbit around each of the fifteen planets in this galactic sector. They > are draining mineral resources from the planetary cores for use in their > interstellar power units. Each Super-Dreadnought seeks out a different metal > for its metal converter. > Your Manta class Space Fighter will be transported to each planet in turn > and it is your task to destroy each Dreadnought. First you must attack the > defensive screen of enemy fighters, then you must neutralise the majority of > surface defences before you land on the Super-Dreadnought's master runway. > Once on board you must pull as many fuel rods as possible from the metal > converters before you take off for a final strafing run as the Dreadnought > vaporises into the ether. Gameplay In-game screenshot from the first level of the Amstrad CPC version of Uridium In practice, each level takes place at a fixed altitude just above the surface of the Dreadnoughts. The screen scrolls horizontally in both directions as the Manta flies over the Dreadnoughts. Each Dreadnought has a different configuration of walls and other structures which must be negotiated in order to reach the landing zone. This task is hampered by squadrons of enemy fighters that attack the Manta in waves. Lastly, flashing ports on the Dreadnought's surface release homing mines that cannot be destroyed. It takes a skillful Manta pilot to outfly the mines until they self-detonate. Only when enough of the Dreadnought's defenses have been destroyed is the \\"Land Now!\\" signal activated, allowing the player to slow the Manta's speed to a minimum and land on the sternward landing zone. After this, the pilot presumably enters the interior of the mothership and sets its nuclear reactor to self-destruct. Finally, the Manta takes off again as the Dreadnought below it crumbles to atoms. As the Manta flies over the Dreadnought again the player has the opportunity to shoot any remaining defences.http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/R-Uridium_c64 Later Dreadnoughts have tricky wall configurations where the gap between the walls is so narrow that the Manta must turn sideways in order to pass through it. This required skillful use of the joystick. More skill could be exhibited (and more points awarded) by ignoring the \\"Land Now!\\" signal and destroying the elite fighters that attacked in waves of one. The final Dreadnought, Uridium, actually contains only a few screens of gameplay; the bulk of this Dreadnought consists of the \\"congratulations\\" message for completing the game (i.e., \\"GOOD ZAPPING... TURKEY.\\"). This is initially made inaccessible by an impassable wall, but visible in the final overflight when the Dreadnought is destroyed. Technical details When Uridium was originally released, reviewers were impressed by the way the Dreadnoughts were presented. In a simulation of parallax scrolling, the surface of the Dreadnoughts scrolls horizontally, whereas the stars in the background stay still. Since the Commodore 64's graphics do not support parallax scrolling, particular trickery was required to achieve this. The way it was done is that the Dreadnoughts' surface is actually the background, and the black empty space and the stars are character glyphs on the foreground. As the Commodore 64's graphics chip scrolls the screen to the left or right, the character glyphs representing the stars change shape by shifting their single lit pixels to the right or left, countering the scroll of the screen and giving the impression they were stationary.Hyt√∂nen, Pasi: Uridiumin ja Parallaxin grafiikka. C-lehti 1/1987, pp. 50-51. Available online at . Sequels Uridium was followed by Uridium+ (a modified version containing new levels), and Uridium 2 on the Amiga platform. Reception and legacy Computer Gaming World praised Uridium for its graphics' ability to display depth, as well as the game's robust controls. Zzap!64 were similarly enthusiastic, describing the game as \\"Visually awesome, sonically sound, technically stunning and a brilliant shoot em up to boot\\". It was rated 94% overall. Antic also liked the game, citing its \\"detailed and lifelike graphics\\". The game won the award for best shooting game of the year according to the readers of Crash magazine. It was also voted Best Arcade- style Game of the Year at the 1986 Golden Joystick Awards. One of Andrew Braybrook's later releases, Morpheus, contained a homing mine enemy called an \\"Uridimine\\", named no doubt as a tribute to the homing mines of Uridium. Some aficionados refer to the homing mines as \\"Uridimines\\" when talking about Uridium or Uridium 2, as well.

Lattner played halfback for the University of Notre Dame under head coach Frank Leahy from 1950 to 1953. He won the Heisman Trophy in 1953, and won the Maxwell Award twice, in 1952 and 1953. In 1953, the Irish went 9‚Äì0‚Äì1, finishing second to Maryland in the final Associated Press poll. Lattner rushed for 651 yards (averaging 4.9 yards per carry) and scored nine touchdowns, caught 14 passes for 204 yards, had four interceptions and tallied two touchdowns on only 10 kickoff returns. Lattner appeared on the cover of Time Magazine on November 9, 1953 with the caption \\"a bread and butter ball carrier\\", a phrase bestowed upon Lattner by Leahy. In 1954, Lattner was drafted in the first round by the Pittsburgh Steelers, but played with them for only one season before entering the United States Air Force for two years. There, during a football game, he suffered a severe knee injury that prevented him from ever playing professional football again. Lattner's single season in Pittsburgh was a success, as he totaled over 1,000 all purpose yards on offense and special teams. As a result, he was named to the NFL 1954 Pro Bowl as a kick and punt returner. Lattner coached for a period in the late 1950s, at St. Joseph's High School in Kenosha, Wisconsin and the University of Denver. His coaching career ended in 1961 when Denver cut its football program. Lattner was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1979. Personal An Oak Park resident for most of his life, Lattner later lived in Melrose Park, Illinois and resided in Anna Maria Island, Florida during the winter months. He served as vice president of sales at PAL Graphics Inc. in Broadview, Illinois. Of Irish Catholic descent, Lattner was a longtime participant in the Chicago Saint Patrick's Day Parade, often carrying the banner of Saint Patrick. The Chicago Tribune noted that nobody \\"out-Irished\\" Lattner, who also sports a kilt and green stockings for the festivities. In 1962, Lattner opened Johnny Lattner's Steakhouse on Madison Street in Chicago. An electrical fire in 1968 severely damaged the restaurant and claimed three lives. Lattner's Heisman Trophy was on display in the restaurant and was destroyed in the fire. Lattner sent the Downtown Athletic Club a check for $300 along with newspaper coverage of the fire and received a replacement. He then operated a second restaurant at Marina City from 1968 to 1972. A fire four years earlier had ended better for Lattner. While driving home from work in the early morning of November 17, 1963, he spotted a fire in an apartment building on the West Side of Chicago. He called the fire department, then roused 25 residents from one of the buildings and carried a five-year-old girl to safety. He was credited with helping 40 people escape injury. In 1986, Lattner ran in the at-large election to be a member of the Cook County Board of Commissioners from suburban Cook County. While successful in winning the primary to be one of the Democratic Party's nominees, he failed to win election in the general election. Lattner routinely rented out his Heisman Trophy to tailgates and other events with the proceeds donated to charity. At halftime during Fenwick's 2007 game versus Hubbard at Soldier Field, Lattner's #34 jersey was retired.Lattner's jersey retired, chicagotribune.com, August 24, 2007. Lattner had 25 grandchildren, several of whom have also played football for Fenwick High School. Robert Spillane, a class of 2014 graduate, played football at the linebacker position for Western Michigan University, and has played in the NFL for the Tennessee Titans and the Pittsburgh Steelers. Another grandson, Ryan Smith, also graduated from Fenwick in 2014, played football at the tight end position for Miami University, and was an off-season member of the Green Bay Packers in 2018. Lattner was 83 when he died from mesothelioma in his Melrose Park, Illinois home on February 12, 2016.Farmer, Marty. \\"Fenwick legend Johnny Lattner dies at 83,\\" Wednesday Journal (Oak Park, IL), February 17, 2016.

He won the Heisman Trophy and the Maxwell Award while at the University of Notre Dame in 1949 and played in the National Football League (NFL) for eight seasons, from 1950 to 1957, with the Detroit Lions. Hart is the only lineman to win three college football national championships and three NFL Championships. He is the last of only two lineman ever to win the Heisman Trophy. Also, he is one of four players, along with Angelo Bertelli, Cam Newton, and Joe Burrow to win the Heisman Trophy, a national championship, and be the first overall pick in the NFL draft all in the same one-year span. Early years Hart was born in Pittsburgh in 1928 raised in nearby Turtle Creek, Pennsylvania, and attended Turtle Creek High School. He won varsity letters in football, basketball and baseball while in high school. Notre Dame Hart attended the University of Notre Dame where he played college football at the end position, both offense and defense, for Frank Leahy's Fighting Irish football teams from 1946 to 1949. He received first-team All- American honors three times, from the Football Writers Association of America (FWAA) in 1947 and as a consensus first team selection in 1948 and 1949.

Hart was the captain of the 1949 Notre Dame team that compiled a perfect 10-0 record, outscored their opponents 360-86, and was recognized in the final AP Poll as the 1949 national champion. At the end of the 1949 season, Hart won both the Heisman Trophy and the Maxwell Award. He was also voted as the Associated Press Athlete of the Year award with 104 points, edging baseball player Jackie Robinson (55 points). Hart graduated from Notre Dame in 1950 with a degree in mechanical engineering. Detroit Lions Hart was selected by the Detroit Lions with the first overall pick in the 1950 NFL Draft.

Childhood, emigrating to the United States  Obici was born in Oderzo in the Veneto region of Italy to Pietro Ludovico Obici and Luigia Carolina Sartori. His father died when Amedeo was seven years old, leaving behind his widow, young Amedeo, another son, Frank, and two daughters. In 1889, his mother's brother, Vittorio Sartori, invited him to come to the United States. The uncle, his wife and two children had earlier emigrated and lived in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Amedeo was unable to speak English at the time. When he sailed across the Atlantic Ocean from Le Havre, France in March 1889, his destination was written on a label tied through a buttonhole on his coat. Upon arrival in Brooklyn, New York, he rode a train to Scranton. En route, however, he was misdirected, and got off in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. The people in the train station took him to a fruit store owned by Enrico Musante and Enrico's daughter, Louise (whom he would later marry in 1916), as they too were Italian and could translate and assist. While the Musantes worked to contact Amedeo's uncle in Scranton, Amedeo stayed with the Musantes in Wilkes- Barre. After staying with his uncle for a short time, he later returned to Wilkes-Barre, where he attended classes in the evening to learn English, and worked in the Musante fruit store.  Roasted peanuts as a snack food  When Amedeo returned to Wilkes-Barre and worked at the Musante fruit store, they had a peanut roaster and a fan that blew the fragrance of the roasting peanuts out to the street to lure customers to buy fruit and peanuts, which inspired him to get his own peanut cart. Because roaster ovens were expensive, Amadeo made a rudimentary roaster from parts obtained at a local scrapyard. To promote his peanut sales, Amedeo devised a promotion. He put one letter of his last name in each bag of peanuts, O, B, I, or C. He inserted only one letter \\"O\\" for every fifty bags, and the customers who got the bags with the letter \\"O\\" won a gold watch. The watch was an Ingersoll gold-colored watch, which he purchased for a dollar. Amedeo saved his money, and in 1895, brought the rest of his family from Italy to the United States. With the remaining savings, he also was able to open his own fruit stand and get a proper peanut roaster.  Joining forces with Mario Peruzzi  Obici operated an eating establishment that served oyster stew and roasted peanuts in a building in downtown Wilkes- Barre. There, in 1897, he teamed up with Mario Peruzzi, another Italian- American immigrant who was working for a wholesale grocer. Some time after Peruzzi's first wife died in 1910 (leaving two children), he married Obici's sister, \\"Lizzie\\".  Planters Peanuts  Obici and Peruzzi founded Planters Peanut Company (unincorporated) in 1906 and incorporated it as Planters Nut and Chocolate Company in 1908. Planters owned four factories by 1930. Obici invented a new method of skinning and blanching peanuts so the roasted goobers came out clean. In 1913, they built a new processing plant in the heart of peanut farming territory in Suffolk, Virginia. Part of Obici's success was in marketing and finding new products to add to Planters' stock.  Bay Point Farm, Obici Hospital  In 1924, Amedeo and Louise Obici moved to Virginia from Scranton and purchased the 253 acre (1 km¬≤) Bay Point Farm located on a bluff overlooking the Nansemond River. Louise and Amedeo Obici were unable to have children of their own, but they frequently held events for children of the community at their Bay Point Farm. Louise's niece, also Louise Musante, lived with the Obicis from 1927 to 1930. Dairy farming was an avocation for Amedeo. He had a prized herd of Guernsey cows, and distributed Bay Point Dairy Farm milk in Suffolk. Louise Obici died in 1938. Amedeo wanted to create a lasting memorial for her and by 1941 had settled on a hospital. In 1942, he formed a corporation, which was funded by a large endowment presented after his death. Amedeo continued to live at Bay Point Farm until his death at age 69. Although area has been reduced through sale, Bay Point Farm still includes the Obici's home overlooking the Nansemond River and some of the outbuildings, and currently belongs to the City of Suffolk. The area is now known as Sleepy Hole Golf Course, and the Obici house has recently been renovated. Bay Point Farm is listed on the Virginia Landmarks Register and on the National Register of Historic Places. Death and legacy Obici died in Suffolk at the Bay Point Farm in 1947. The generosity of Louise and Amedeo Obici to their adopted community and his workers left a strong imprint in Suffolk and the surrounding community. Among Amedeo Obici's legacy in the Suffolk and surrounding community was the original Louise Obici Memorial Hospital on Main Street U.S. Route 460. The hospital was established by his brother-in-law Mario Peruzzi after Obici's death, using the funds Obici had left him for that purpose. The community landmark, dedicated to Amedeo's wife Louise, opened in 1951. Through his estate, Obici also planned and paid for another hospital in his original hometown of Oderzo in Italy. In 2002, a newer facility replaced the 1951-era Louise Obici Memorial Hospital at a larger site on Godwin Boulevard State Route 10. Obici Hospital is now affiliated with Sentara Healthcare which operates many health care facilities in southeastern Virginia. Another hospital was opened in southern Virginia with the Obici name in 2011. The old hospital site has been redeveloped and turned into a mixed use development with condominiums and retail shops, with the street and property still bearing Louise's name. Although Planters and the peanut industry are not the major defining activity of Suffolk as they once were, the Mr. Peanut character has become quite famous. A statue of the mascot is prominently displayed in downtown Suffolk. Another was a gift to Suffolk's sister city, Oderzo. The Planters Nut and Chocolate Company, now known simply as Planters, is owned by Kraft Foods. It is the Suffolk area's 11th largest employer. References *Hobbs, Kermit; & Paquette, William A.

The book was initially published by David McKay Company in January 1975. Overview He makes three basic arguments. First, he examines the economic impact of slavery, in the United States, the West Indies, and elsewhere. He distinguishes rural slavery from urban slavery, and circumstances in which blacks so predominated that many economic tasks fell to them of necessity, from circumstances in which blacks were punished for initiative and the development of skills. Next, he compares the economic skills, circumstances, and successes of American blacks, other blacks, Puerto Ricans, Chicanos, Jews, Irish, Italians, Scots, and other ethnic groups. He notes statistical quirks; e.g., comparisons of per capita income need to be checked against the median age of the groups concerned. The median age of Russians in the U.S. at the time of the book's publishing (1975) was 47, of the Irish 36, of blacks 23, of Puerto Ricans, 18. Income tends to be higher in higher age cohorts; and unemployment tends to be higher in lower cohorts. If one matches age cohort to age cohort‚Äîthose in their twenties, in their thirties, in their forties, etc., comparisons are considerably more just. He also argues that the stark comparisons between \\"whites\\" and \\"blacks\\" are misleading. His third argument criticizes past governmental and economic policies, and opens up questions for the future. He has criticisms to make of liberals, radicals, and conservatives, each of whom, he finds, protect their favorite illusions with respect to blacks. Race and Economics greatly influenced Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.

Kennedy signing Proclamation 3504, authorizing the naval quarantine of Communist Cuba The Kennedy Doctrine refers to foreign policy initiatives of the 35th President of the United States, John Fitzgerald Kennedy, towards Latin America during his administration between 1961 and 1963. Kennedy voiced support for the containment of communism as well as the reversal of communist progress in the Western Hemisphere.  Inaugural address: \\"Pay any price, bear any burden\\"  In his Inaugural Address on January 20, 1961, President Kennedy presented the American public with a blueprint upon which the future foreign policy initiatives of his administration would later follow and come to represent. In this Address, Kennedy warned \\"Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe, in order to assure the survival and the success of liberty.\\"1 He also called upon the public to assist in \\"a struggle against the common enemies of man: tyranny, poverty, disease, and war itself.\\"1 It is in this address that one begins to see the Cold War, us-versus-them mentality that came to dominate the Kennedy administration.  Cold War containment  A dominant premise during the Kennedy years was the need to contain communism at any cost. In this Cold War environment, Kennedy's \\"call for military strength and unison in the struggle against communism were balanced with... [hopes] for disarmament and global cooperation.\\"2 Another common theme in Kennedy's foreign policy was the belief that because the United States had the ability and power to control events in the international system, they should. Kennedy expressed this idea in his address when he stated, \\"In the long history of the world only a few generations have been granted the role of defending freedom from its hour of maximum danger. I do not shrink from this responsibility ‚Äì I welcome it.\\"1  Historical background  The Kennedy Doctrine was essentially an expansion of the foreign policy prerogatives of the administrations of Dwight D. Eisenhower and Harry S. Truman. The foreign policies of these presidents all revolved around the threat of communism and the means by which the US would try containing the spread of it. The Truman Doctrine focused on the containment of communism by providing assistance to countries resisting communism in Europe. The Eisenhower Doctrine was focused upon providing both military and economic assistance to nations resisting communism in the Middle East, and by increasing the flow of trade from the US into Latin America. The Kennedy Doctrine was based on these same objectives, but was more concerned with the spread of communism and Soviet influence in Latin America following the Cuban revolution that brought Fidel Castro to power under Eisenhower.  Alliance for Progress  In his inaugural address, Kennedy talks of an alliance for progress with countries in Latin America. In his Alliance for Progress address for Latin American Diplomats and Members of Congress on March 13, 1961 he expanded on his promises from his inaugural speech. \\"I have called on all the people of the hemisphere to join in a new Alliance for Progress ‚Äì alianza para el Progreso ‚Äì a vast cooperative effort, unparalleled in magnitude and nobility of purpose, to satisfy the basic needs of the American people for homes, work and land, health and schools ‚Äì techo, trabajo y tierra, salud y escuela.\\"3 In the address, Kennedy reaffirmed the United States' pledge of coming to the defense of any nation whose independence was endangered, promised to increase the food-for-peace emergency program and to provide economic aid to nations in need. He requested that Latin American countries promote social change within their borders and called upon all American nations to move towards increased economic integration. \\"To achieve this goal political freedom must accompany material progress. Our Alliance for Progress is an alliance of free governments ‚Äì and it must work to eliminate tyranny from a hemisphere in which it has no rightful place. Therefore let us express our special friendship to the people of Cuba and the Dominican Republic ‚Äì and the hope they will soon rejoin the society of free men, uniting with us in our common effort.\\"3  Debate over international role of United States  Many have questioned whether Kennedy's Inaugural Address, and the foreign policy stemming from the vision he expressed in it \\"describes an appropriate, rational, and prudent role for the United States in the world; whether it is an outline for an era of negotiation and accommodation and friendship; or whether it is a prescription for an untenable globalism, leading inevitably to increased areas of conflict, to a heightening of the arms race, and to American concern with and involvement, to one degree or another, in the affairs of almost every country in the world.\\"4 What remains clear is that Kennedy was deeply involved and committed to every aspect of the foreign policy under his administration. W. Averell Harriman served in and on behalf of Kennedy's Administration in several capacities, and noted, \\"President Kennedy was the first President, that I know of, who was really his own secretary of state. He dealt with every aspect of foreign policy, and he knew about everything that was going on.\\"5  Derived events  Some of the most notable events that stemmed from tenets of JFK's foreign policy initiatives in regard to Latin America and the spread of communism were:6 * The Bay of Pigs Invasion, April 17, 1961. * Increase of U.S. involvement in Vietnam War, 1962. * Cuban Missile Crisis, October 1962. * Ratification of Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, July 1963.

Its three hospital campuses are located in Berkeley (Alta Bates Campus, Herrick Campus) and Oakland (Summit Campus). Alta Bates Summit is a non-profit community-based medical center and is part of Sutter Health. History=Alta Bates Campus The flagship Berkeley campus of the medical center was named after Alta Miner Bates, the nurse who founded the hospital in 1905. Bates was a prominent early California nurse anesthetist. The first graduate of a nurse training program in Eureka, California, she was among the first female anesthetists in the San Francisco Bay Area, administering over 14,000 anesthetics during her career. Until her retirement in 1949, Bates served as the hospital's director and was president of its board. Alta Bates Hospital, later renamed Alta Bates Medical Center until its merger with Summit Medical Center in 1999, is now known as the Alta Bates Campus of Alta Bates Summit Medical Center. Herrick Campus In 1904, Dr. LeRoy Francis Herrick, a graduate of the Kentucky College of Medicine (1893), purchased a Berkeley mansion known as the Hume House, located on the same block upon which the current Herrick Campus is situated, between Dwight and Channing Ways, and Milvia and Grove (now Martin Luther King Way). He converted the large home into a 25-bed hospital which he chose to name for President Theodore Roosevelt whom he admired. (President Roosevelt was an early proponent of a government-supported national public health system.) The Roosevelt Hospital was expanded to 50 beds by 1924, and renamed Berkeley General Hospital. In 1932, Dr. Herrick died, and his heirs converted the hospital into a non-profit corporation. By 1934, the hospital had 100 beds. The original Roosevelt Hospital building was demolished to accommodate additional wings and facilities which were added over time. In 1945, the hospital was again renamed Herrick Memorial Hospital, in honor of its founder.\\"The Hospital Story\\", The Herrick Hospitaler, June 1951, p.2 Further improvements and expansions continued through the ensuing decades. Herrick Memorial Hospital formally affiliated with Alta Bates Hospital in 1984 and fully merged in 1988. The joint organization, spanning both sites, was briefly named Alta Bates Herrick Hospital but became Alta Bates Medical Center in 1992. The site is now known as the Herrick Campus of Alta Bates Summit Medical Center.  Summit Campus  The Summit Campus of Alta Bates Summit Medical Center was previously three separately owned and operated facilities located in the same \\"Pill Hill\\" neighborhood, immediately north of downtown Oakland: Providence Hospital (founded in 1904 by the Sisters of Providence), Peralta Hospital (founded by local Oakland doctors in the 1920s) and Samuel Merritt Hospital. Dr. Samuel Merritt (1822‚Äì1890) was a successful San Francisco physician and also the 13th mayor of Oakland, California from 1867-69. In 1867, Merritt donated to the city of Oakland the wetlands now known as Lake Merritt. Merritt left plans for a hospital and nursing school to be built in his name after his death; in 1909 Samuel Merritt College (still in operation as Samuel Merritt University and affiliated with Sutter Health) and Merritt Hospital opened.

After a childhood in Florence and enlistment in the Italian army he enrolled in classes at a local military college in Florence. In 1901 he was promoted to the rank of major. He participated in the Italo-Turkish War and during the First World War held various posts until he was badly wounded and captured in the battle of Caporetto.L'eccidio Tellini.

Assassination In 1923 Tellini was part of an Italian delegation sent by the League of Nations to survey the disputed border between Greece and Albania. He was shot and killed, along with four companions, when the car he was driving in was stopped by a fallen tree across the road that ran along the disputed border near the town of Ioannina on the way to the Albanian border. The responsible persons were never found. The incident occurred close to the disputed border and could have been carried out by either side. However, the Italians under Benito Mussolini, blamed the Greek side. The Greek side refused any responsibility. The Italians claimed Greece as responsible and there were anti-Greek retaliations in the country. The Greek government denied responsibility and blamed Albanian bandits in the area. Benito Mussolini demanded 50 million lira in reparations from Greece and the execution of the assassins.

History The name Pembrey is an Anglicisation of the Welsh, Pen-bre. \\"Pen\\" is a Welsh word meaning head or top, and \\"bre\\" is an old Celtic word for a promontory. The coastline began its retreat from the foot of Pembrey Mountain some 6,000 years ago, revealing land which shows human occupation since the Iron Age, with hill forts dating from around 400 BC. The population of the region was known to the Romans as Demetae. Roman pottery remains have been unearthed in the oldest parts of the village. Later, the village was part of the Welsh principality of Deheubarth. Evidence of an early Norman motte-and-bailey castle has been suggested close to the village square and buildings remain in the village from later Norman times. St Illtyd's church The village was home to Arnold le Boteler, a Norman squire of the 12th century. His manor, Court Farm, Pembrey, subsequently extended into a Jacobean manor house and then a farm, is now derelict. The le Boteler (Butler) crest can be seen in the village church of St. Illtud, established during le Boteler's lifetime with its saint's name connected to his other estate of Dunraven, Southerndown, near Llantwit Major, Bridgend. St Illtyd's is a grade II* listed building. Most of the village was created during the 18th and 19th century coal mining boom, when Pembrey was a port. Pembrey Mountain (Welsh: Mynydd Penbre) was thoroughly mined by both Welsh and English companies for about 100 years and some reserves are said to remain underground. Pembrey's harbour was prone to silting and was abandoned in favour of Pembrey New Harbour - soon renamed Burry Port Harbour, just a mile further upstream on the Burry Estuary. The original harbour is now known as Pembrey Old Harbour. Pembrey's mountain and beach Cefn Sidan are reputed to have provided some villagers with careers as wreckers, known locally as Gwyr- y-Bwelli Bach (translated as People with Little Hatchets) - attracting sailing ships with fires purporting to be beacons, then raiding them when they foundered. However, no firm evidence of wrongdoing such as booty has ever been discovered. Nevertheless, a number of vessels were certainly lost around Pembrey, including \\"La Jeune Emma\\" bound from the West Indies to France and blown badly off course in 1828. 13 of the 19 on board drowned, including Adeline Coquelin, the 12-year-old niece of Napoleon Bonaparte's divorced wife Josephine de Beauharnais. She is buried at St. Illtyds Church, Pembrey. The last large ship to be lost was the four-masted windjammer, the SS Paul, carrying a cargo of timber and grounding in a storm in 1925. Manor families From the days of le Boteler to the early 20th century, Pembrey was generally dominated by at least one leading family. Latest of these was the Ashburnham family (Earl of Ashburnham) who lived until the 1920s at Pembrey House, lost to fire some 50 years ago. The Ashburnham Golf Club championship course is the area's main sporting attraction, Ashburnham Road is one of the village's two main thoroughfares and the Ashburnham Hotel one of its hostelries. Military and RAF Pembrey Military connections include the past use of areas of the Ashburnham estate as a firing range. In the 20th century, a RAF station, RAF Pembrey was situated in Pembrey and played a role in Britain's defences as home to both fighter and bomber aircraft. Close by, a Royal Ordnance Factory, ROF Pembrey, provided high explosives for Britain's war effort. Both these facilities attracted a number of Luftwaffe raids over the village during World War II. One airman based and living in Pembrey, Wing Commander Guy Gibson, went on to lead the Dambusters. Flying ace Robert Stanford Tuck was at Pembrey with 92 Squadron in 1940. An attempt to establish a munitions testing range in Pembrey was made during the 1960s but was resisted by villagers, who mounted a SOS (Save Our Sands) campaign. The opposition proved successful, leading to the establishment of Pembrey Country Park instead. Royal Air Force training continues on a bombing range to the west of Pembrey Country Park near Kidwelly. The RAF Red Arrows aerobatics display team performed over Kidwelly's carnival, with many of their stunts taking place over the village of Pembrey itself. Today Today, the village has lost most of its former sources of employment and is largely a dormitory for the nearby urban areas of Llanelli and Carmarthen. Tourism has been successfully developed at the Country Park, along the Millennium Coastal Path and at nearby Burry Port although accommodation is limited to caravanning,a few bed & breakfasts and the Ashburnham Hotel. In August/September 2006, Court Farm appeared in the first round of BBC2's Restoration Village programme. Experts agreed that the building mainly requires a new roof and could be restored to form a cultural centre. The manor did not progress through the competition and has subsequently been passed to the Cadw Sir Gaerfyrddin Cyf. (Carmarthenshire Building Preservation Trust) who, along with The Friends Of Court Farm, are actively seeking funds to restore the building; an in- principle Cadw grant of 40% has been awarded for consolidation works to start the restoration project. Pembrey Burrows and Cefn Sidan are now part of extensive leisure areas run by local authorities. Attractions include the Millennium Coastal Path, Ski Pembrey, an artificial ski centre and toboggan ride, St. Illtyd's Church and village square, mountain walks and picnic areas, the traditional links golf course, Pembrey Old Harbour, Pembrey Country Park, the Pembrey Circuit - the National Motorsport Centre of Wales, horse-riding, a working airfield and flying club at Pembrey Airport, and St. Illtyds Church. The Camarthenshire Land Sailing Club is allowed to use the beach for wind traction activities, including Land sailing, kite buggying and Kite landboarding. On entering the country park, several abandoned bunkers are visible, these being the remains of the former Royal Ordnance Factory that closed in 1965. The woods and bunkers provided a focus point for an episode of Living TV's Most Haunted, which was aired in April 2008. The village's name has also been applied to Pembrey, Delaware in the United States, a short drive from Philadelphia. Transport Actually located in Burry Port, Pembrey and Burry Port railway station is on the West Wales line with regular services to Milford Haven and Manchester via Cardiff as well as twice-daily to London. Between 1909 and 1953 Pembrey station on the Burry Port and Gwendraeth Valley Railway served the village. The village is served by bus on routes from Carmarthen and Swansea. The nearest motorway is the M4. Pembrey Airport has no scheduled services but provides facilities for visiting private and corporate aircraft, including executive jets, Pembrey Airfield is one of the most military active civil airports in Britain so PPR is often needed, Pembrey Airfield does offer facilities for passenger aircraft but only as charter flights.

Rijeka: Adamic, 1998. Male inmate at the Rab concentration camp. Conditions at the camp were described as appalling: \\"filthy, muddy, overcrowded and swarming with insects\\". Slovene writer Metod Milaƒç, an inmate at the camp, described in his memoirs how prisoners were quartered six to a tent and slowly starved to death on a daily diet of thin soup, a few grains of rice and small pieces of bread. Prisoners fought with each other for access to the camp's meager water supply, a single barrel, while many became infested with lice and wracked with dysentery caused by the unhygienic conditions. Part of the encampment was washed away by flash flooding. Some Italian authorities eventually acknowledged that the treatment of the inmates was counterproductive; in January 1943, the commanding officer of the 14th Battalion of Carabinieri complained: :\\"In the last few days some internees have returned from the concentration camp in such a state of physical emaciation, a few in an absolutely pitiful condition, that a terrible impression has been created in the general population. Treating the Slovene population like this palpably undermines our dignity and is contrary to the principles of justice and humanity to which we make constant reference in our propaganda.\\"Steinberg, Jonathan. All Or Nothing: The Axis and the Holocaust, 1941-1943, pp. 131-33. Routledge, 2002; Jewish internees at Rab By 1 July 1943, 2,118 Yugoslav Jews were recorded having been interned by the Italian army. Starting in June 1943, they were moved into a newly constructed section of the Rab concentration camp, alongside the Slovenian and Croatian section. Unlike the Slovene and Croatian prisoners, the Jewish ones were provided with better accommodation, sanitation and services; they were provided with wooden and brick barracks and houses in contrast to the overcrowded tents sheltering the Slavic prisoners. Historian Franc Potoƒçnik, also an inmate in the Slavic section of the camp, described the much better conditions in the Jewish section: > \\"The [Slavic] internees in Camp I could watch through the double barriers of > barbed wire what took place in the Jewish camp. The Jewish internees were > living under conditions of true internment for their 'protection', whereas > the Slovenes and Croats were in a regime of 'repression'. . . . They brought > a lot of baggage with them. Italian soldiers carried their luggage into > little houses of brick destined for them. Almost every family had its own > little house.... They were reasonably well dressed; in comparison, of > course, to other internees.\\" The difference in treatment was the consequence of a conscious policy by the Italian military authorities. In July 1943, the Civil Affairs Office at the 2nd Army HQ issued a memorandum on \\"The Treatment of Jews in the Rab Camp\\", which was enthusiastically approved by chief of the office and the 2nd Army's chief of staff. The memorandum's author, a Major Prolo, urged that the infrastructure of the camp must be: :\\"...comfortable for all internees without risk to the maintenance of order and discipline. Inactivity and boredom are terrible evils which work silently on the individual and collectivity. It is prudent that in the great camp of Rab those concessions made to the Jews of Porto Re [Kraljevica] to make their lives comfortable should not be neglected.\\" He concluded with a clear reference to Italian awareness of the massacres of Jews that were ongoing elsewhere in German-occupied Europe: :\\"The Jews (...) have the duties of all civilians interned for protective reasons, and a right to equivalent treatment, but for particular, exceptional political and contingent reasons [emphasis added], it seems opportune to concede, while maintaining discipline unimpaired, a treatment consciously felt to be 'Italian' which they are used to from our military authorities, and with a courtesy which is complete and never half-hearted.\\" Some members of the Italian military also saw humane treatment of the Jews as a way of preserving Italy's military and political honour in the face of German encroachments on Italian sovereignty; Steinberg describes this as \\"a kind of national conspiracy [among the Italian military] to frustrate the much greater and more systematic brutality of the Nazi state.\\" According to the Slovenian Rab survivor, Anton Vratu≈°a, who later became Yugoslavia's ambassador to the United Nations: \\"We were prisoners; they were protected people. We used their assistance.\\" Notable WWII-era prisoners * Thea Altaras (1924‚Äì2004) * Mihael Montiljo (1928‚Äì2006) * Maja Bo≈°koviƒá-Stulli (1922‚Äì2012) * Alfred Pal (1920‚Äì2010) * Ivan Rein (1905‚Äì1943) * Anton Vratu≈°a (1915‚Äì2017) * Jakob Finci (b. 1943) Closure of the camp By mid-1943 the camp's population stood at about 7,400 people, of whom some 2,700 were Jews. The fall of Mussolini in late July 1943 increased the likelihood that the Jews on Rab would fall into German hands, prompting the Italian Foreign Ministry to repeatedly instruct the General Staff that the Jews should not be released unless they themselves requested it. The ministry also began to put in place a mass transfer of the Jews to the Italian mainland. However, on 16 August 1943 the Italian military authorities ordered that the Jews were to be released from the camp, although those that wished could stay.Rodogno, Davide (2006) Fascism's European Empire: Italian Occupation During the Second World War, Cambridge University Press, , pp. 354, 446 The island remained in Italian hands until after the Armistice with Italy was signed on 8 September 1943, when the Germans seized control. About 245 of the Jewish inmates of the camp joined the Rab Brigade of the 24th Division of the People's Liberation Army and Partisan Detachments of Yugoslavia, forming the Rab battalion, though they were eventually dispersed among other Partisan units. Although most of the Jews from the camp were evacuated to Partisan-held territory, 204 (7.5%) of them, the elderly or sick, were left behind and were sent to Auschwitz by the Germans for extermination.Zuccotti, Susan (1996) in: Colombo, Furio.

He also wrote about the relationship between German industry and National Socialism. Biography Born in Neuilly-sur-Seine near Paris, Sohn-Rethel came from a family of painters, his father was painter, Alfred Sohn-Rethel (1875‚Äì1958) and his mother was Anna Julie, n√©e Michels. His mother was a descendant from the noble Oppenheim family and had influential relations with big business. His paternal grandfather was painter, Karl Rudolf Sohn and his paternal grandmother was painter and singer, Else Sohn-Rethel. As his family did not want him also to become a painter, he was brought up by his uncle, the steel industrialist Ernst Poensgen. On Christmas 1915, he expressed a wish for a copy of Karl Marx Capital as a present. He received one and studied it intensively. Thrown out of home, he participated in the anti-war student protest in his first year at Heidelberg University in 1917.Alfred Sohn-Rethel, 'Preface', Intellectual and Manual Labour From 1920 Sohn-Rethel was a friend of the philosopher Ernst Bloch, and he met Walter Benjamin in 1921. He came to live in Positano in 1923‚Äì24, and Naples: philosophy of the broken recorded his fascination with the relaxed Neapolitan attitude to technology.The Ideal of the Broken-Down: On the Neapolitan Approach to Things Technical Between 1924 and 1927 he remained in Italy, \\"mainly in Capri, where Benjamin and Bloch were staying\\", meeting Adorno and Kracauer also at Capri in 1924. Additionally his paternal uncle, Otto Sohn-Rethel lived in Anacapri a city in Capri, whom he visited with. He stayed in contact with different members of the Frankfurt School, to whom his theoretical concerns were close; however, they never established a close working relationship. Sohn-Rethel received his doctorate with the Austrian Marxist Emil Lederer in 1928.Von der Analytik des Wirtschaftcns zur Theorie der Volkswirtschaft: Methodologische Untersuchung mit besonderem Bezug auf die Theorie Schumpeters, 1928. Published 1936. In his thesis he criticized the theory of marginal utility as a petitio principii because it implies the notion of number implicitly. Thanks to Poensgen he found a job as research assistant at the Mitteleurop√§ischer Wirtschaftstag (MWT). The MWT was a lobbying organization of the leading export industries. From 1931 to 1936 he worked 'in the cave of the lion' and watched and analyzed power politics from a very close distance. At the same time he had contacts with socialist resistance groups like Neu beginnen or Der rote Stosstrupp. In 1937 he emigrated via Switzerland and Paris to England. He wrote economic analyses for a circle close to Winston Churchill which were used against Neville Chamberlain's appeasement policy. For a long time after the Second World War Sohn-Rethel was not really able to continue his theoretical work. He made a living teaching French. He joined the Communist Party and despite his disillusionment he was a member until 1972. The 1968 movement created a new interest in his work. At the funeral of Adorno he met the editor Unseld who encouraged him to crystallize his ideas in his major work Intellectual and manual labor. In 1978 Sohn-Rethel was appointed Professor for Social Philosophy at Bremen University. He died in Bremen in 1990. Work Sohn- Rethel's lifelong project was the combination of the epistemology of Kant with Marx's critique of political economy. When people exchange commodities they abstract from the specific goods. Only the value of these goods is important. This abstraction is called 'real abstraction' because it occurs during the physical event of exchange of commodities between two property owners. Sohn- Rethel believed this type of abstraction to be the real basis of formal and abstract thinking. All of Kant's categories such as space, time, quality, substance, accident, movement and so forth are implicit in the act of exchange. Readers of Marx will not be entirely surprised by such a genealogy, since Marx himself suggested that the ideas of freedom and equality, at least as we know them so far, are rooted in the exchange of commodities. Sohn- Rethel's work on the nature of 'real abstraction' has been amplified and extended by the writers of Arena (Australian publishing co-operative), especially the notion that a post-marxist social and historical analysis can be founded on the 'real abstraction' principle. An example of using Sohn- Rethel's idea of commodity occurs in Slavoj Zizek's work The Sublime Object of Ideology. The second domain where Sohn-Rethel made important contributions was the study of the economic policies that favoured the rise of German fascism, much of which is based on first-hand knowledge gained from his time at the MWT. He insisted on the difference between different factions of capitalists, the more prospering industries close to Br√ºning and the less successful industries close to the Harzburger Front (Hugenberg, Hitler) namely coal, construction and steel - with the exception of Krupp. The endorsement of the compromise between industry and big agrarians at the shareholders' meeting of the IG Farben in 1932 paved the way for the dictatorship, according to Sohn- Rethel.

Droughts and famines in the Russian Empire tended to occur fairly regularly, with famine occurring every 10‚Äì13 years and droughts every five to seven years. Golubev and Dronin distinguish three types of drought according to productive areas vulnerable to droughts: Central (the Volga basin, North Caucasus and the Central Chernozem Region), Southern (Volga and Volga-Vyatka area, the Ural region, and Ukraine), and Eastern (steppe and forest-steppe belts in Western and Eastern Siberia, and Kazakhstan).  Pre-1900 droughts and famines  In the 17th century, Russia experienced the famine of 1601‚Äì1603, as a proportion of the population, believed to be its worst as it may have killed 2 million people (1/3 of the population). ( 5 million people estimated to have died in 1920-22 famine). Major famines include the Great Famine of 1315‚Äì17, which affected much of Europe including part of RussiaLucas, Henry S. \\"The great European famine of 1315, 1316, and 1317.\\" Speculum 5.4 (1930): 343-377. as well as the Baltic states. The Nikonian chronicle, written between 1127 and 1303, recorded no less than eleven famine years during that period. One of the most serious crises before 1900 was the famine of 1891‚Äì92, which killed between 375,000 and 500,000 people, mainly due to famine-related diseases. Causes included a large Autumn drought resulting in crop failures. Attempts by the government to alleviate the situation generally failed which may have contributed to a lack of faith in the Czarist regime and later political instability.  List of post-1900 droughts and famines  Starving woman, c. 1921 Three children who are dead from starvation, 1921 Starving children in 1922 The Golubev and Dronin report gives the following table of the major droughts in Russia between 1900 and 2000. * Central: 1920, 1924, 1936, 1946, 1984. * Southern: 1901, 1906, 1921, 1939, 1948, 1995. * Eastern: 1911, 1931, 1991.  1900s  The failed Revolution of 1905 likely distorted output and restricted food availability.  1910s  During the Russian Revolution and following civil war there was a decline in total agricultural output. Measured in millions of tons the 1920 grain harvest was only 46.1, compared to 80.1 in 1913. By 1926 it had almost returned to pre-war levels reaching 76.8.  1920s  The early 1920s saw a series of famines. The first famine in the USSR happened in 1921‚Äì1923 and garnered wide international attention. The most affected area being the Southeastern areas of European Russia (including Volga region, especially national republics of Idel-Ural, see 1921‚Äì22 famine in Tatarstan) and Ukraine. An estimated 16 million people may have been affected and up to 5 million died. Fridtjof Nansen was honored with the 1922 Nobel Peace Prize, in part for his work as High Commissioner for Relief In Russia. Other organizations that helped to combat the Soviet famine were International Save the Children Union and the International Committee of the Red Cross. When the Russian famine of 1921 broke out, the American Relief Administration's director in Europe, Walter Lyman Brown, began negotiating with Soviet deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Maxim Litvinov, in Riga, Latvia. An agreement was reached on August 21, 1921, and an additional implementation agreement was signed by Brown and People's Commisar for Foreign Trade Leonid Krasin on December 30, 1921. The U.S. Congress appropriated $20,000,000 for relief under the Russian Famine Relief Act of late 1921. At its peak, the ARA employed 300 Americans, more than 120,000 Russians and fed 10.5 million people daily. Its Russian operations were headed by Col. William N. Haskell. The Medical Division of the ARA functioned from November 1921 to June 1923 and helped overcome the typhus epidemic then ravaging Russia. The ARA's famine relief operations ran in parallel with much smaller Mennonite, Jewish and Quaker famine relief operations in Russia.See Lance Yoder's \\"Historical Sketch\\" in the online Mennonite Central Committee Photograph Collection See David McFadden et al., Constructive Spirit: Quakers in Revolutionary Russia, 2004 The ARA's operations in Russia were shut down on June 15, 1923, after it was discovered that Russia renewed the export of grain.Charles M. Edmondson, \\"An Inquiry into the Termination of Soviet Famine Relief Programmes and the Renewal of Grain Export, 1922‚Äì23\\", Soviet Studies, Vol. 33, No. 3 (1981), pp. 370‚Äì385  1930s  Areas of most disastrous Soviet famine of 1932‚Äì1933 marked with black  Soviet famine of 1932‚Äì1933  The second major Soviet famine happened during the initial push for collectivization during the 30s. Major causes include the 1932‚Äì33 confiscations of grain and other food by the Soviet authorities which contributed to the famine and affected more than forty million people, especially in the south on the Don and Kuban areas and in Ukraine, where by various estimates millions starved to death or died due to famine related illness (the event known as Holodomor). The famine was perhaps most severe in Kazakhstan where the semi-nomadic pastoralists' traditional way of life was most disturbed by Soviet agricultural ambitions.Gr√°da, C. √ì. (2010). Famine: a short history. Princeton University Press. There is still debate over whether or not Holodomor was a massive failure of policy or a deliberate act of genocide. Robert Conquest held the view that the famine was not intentionally inflicted by Stalin, but \\"with resulting famine imminent, he could have prevented it, but put ‚ÄúSoviet interest‚Äù other than feeding the starving first‚Äîthus consciously abetting it\\". Michael Ellman's analysis of the famine found that \\"there is some evidence that in 1930-33 ... Stalin also used starvation in his war against the peasants\\", which he calls a \\"conscious policy of starvation\\", but concludes that there were several factors, primarily focusing on the leadership's culpability in continuing to prioritize collectivization and industrialization over preventing mass death , due to their Leninist stance of regarding starvation \\"as a necessary cost of the progressive policies of industrialisation and the building of socialism\\", and thus did not \\"perceive the famine as a humanitarian catastrophe requiring a major effort to relieve distress and hence made only limited relief efforts.\\" Similarly, Mark Tauger concludes that the famine was not intentional genocide but the result of failed economic policy: There is also the controversial argument by Douglas Tottle, a Canadian Communist Party member, that the famine was significantly worsened by the actions of the kulaks, a class of peasants who had become wealthy after the Stolypin reform, many of whom burned their crops and killed their livestock rather than give their lands and livestock over to collectivization.Tottle, Douglas \\"Fraud, Famine and Fascism: The Ukrainian Genocide Myth from Hitler to Harvard.\\" Progress Books (1987) Tottle's book has been severely criticised. David Patrikarakos, writing in the New Republic, called it \\"revisionism\\" and compared it to Soviet propaganda.. Former Harvard professor, Frank Sysyn, states that \\"the book was likely compiled in the Soviet Union\\" and Soviet-sponsored as a response to the release of Robert Conquest's book The Harvest of Sorrow which argues that the famine was man-made.  Demographic impact  The demographic impact of the famine of 1932‚Äì1933 was multifold. In addition to direct and indirect deaths associated with the famine, there were significant internal migrations of Soviet citizens, often fleeing famine-ridden regions. A sudden decline in birthrates permanently \\"scarred\\" the long-term population growth of the Soviet Union in a way similar to, although not as severe, as that of World War 2. Estimates of Soviet deaths attributable to the 1932‚Äì1933 famine vary wildly, but are typically given in the range of millions. Vallin et al. estimated that the disasters of the decade culminated in a dramatic fall in fertility and a rise in mortality. Their estimates suggest that total losses can be put at about 4.6 million, 0.9 million of which was due to forced migration, 1 million to a deficit in births, and 2.6 million to exceptional mortality.Vallin, Jacques; Mesl√©, France; Adamets, Serguei; Pyrozhkov, Serhii (2002). A New Estimate of Ukrainian Population Losses during the Crises of the 1930s and 1940s. The long-term demographic consequences of collectivization and the Second World War meant that the Soviet Union's 1989 population was 288 million rather than 315 million, 9% lower than it otherwise would have been. In addition to the deaths, the famine resulted in massive population movements, as about 300,000 Kazakh nomads fled to China, Iran, Mongolia and Afghanistan during the famine.Kokaisl, Petr. \\"Soviet collectivisation and its specific focus on central Asia.\\" AGRIS on-line Papers in Economics and Informatics 5.4 (2013): 121.Thomas, Alun. Kazakh Nomads and the New Soviet State, 1919-1934. Diss. University of Sheffield, 2015. Although famines were taking place in various parts of the USSR in 1932‚Äì1933, for example in Kazakhstan, parts of Russia and the Volga German Republic, the name Holodomor is specifically applied to the events that took place in territories populated by Ukrainians and also North Caucasian Kazakhs.  Legacy  The legacy of Holodomor remains a sensitive and controversial issue in contemporary Ukraine where it is regarded as an act of genocide by the government and is generally remembered as one of the greatest tragedies in the nation's history.Kupfer, Matthew, and Thomas de Waal. \\"Crying Genocide: Use and Abuse of Political Rhetoric in Russia and Ukraine.\\" (2014). The issue of Holodomor being an intentional act of genocide or not has often been a subject of dispute between the Russian Federation and Ukrainian government. The modern Russian government has generally attempted to disassociate and downplay any links between itself and the famine.  1940s  During the Siege of Leningrad by Nazi Germany, as many as one million people died while many more went hungry or starved but survived. Germans tried to starve out Leningrad in order to break its resistance. Starvation was one of the primary causes of death as the food supply was cut off and strict rationing was enforced. Animals in the city were slaughtered and eaten. Instances of cannibalism were reported. The last major famine in the USSR happened mainly in 1947 as a cumulative effect of consequences of collectivization, war damage, the severe drought in 1946 in over 50 percent of the grain-productive zone of the country and government social policy and mismanagement of grain reserves. The regions primarily affected were Transnistria in Moldova and South Eastern Ukraine. Between 100,000 and one million people may have perished.  1947‚Äì1991  There were no famines after 1947. The drought of 1963 caused panic slaughtering of livestock, but there was no risk of famine. After that year the Soviet Union started importing feed grains for its livestock in increasing amounts.  Post-Soviet Russia  Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, there have been occasional issues with hunger and food security in Russia. In 1992 there was a notable decline in calorie intake within the Russian Federation. Both Russia and Ukraine have been subject to a series of severe droughts from July 2010 to 2015. The 2010 drought saw wheat production fall by 20% in Russia and subsequently resulted in a temporary ban on grain exports.

Pembrey has one Hard Runway designated as 22LH/C and 04RH/C. Pembrey airport is situated inside the Royal Air Force danger area D118 known as Pembrey Sands Air Weapons Range. Pembrey is open seven days a week but only licensed at weekends unless a prior booking is made, due to an LOA with the MoD to operate civil and commercial flights during operational hours as long as any visiting aircraft obtain the required PPR from the RAF. The Airport has an NDB on site designated as the PMB. History Construction of the airfield for RAF Flying Training Command started in 1937 and by September 1939, the RAF's No. 2 Air Armament School was the first unit to be stationed at the airfield. By May 1940, the three tarmac runways had been completed. During World War Two Pembrey was an active RAF station and was host to the RAF's Air Gunnery School, after which its activities relaxed a little and it became an air crew holding unit for crews being demobbed. Between 1946 and 1949 RAF Fighter Command was in control of the airfield; work was then put in hand to lengthen Runway 04/22 to take jet aircraft. From 1949 to 1952 21 Wing RAF Regiment (comprising 15 and 63 Squadrons RAF Regiment) were based at Pembrey. With Runway 04/22 extended to nearly 6000 feet, 233 OCU moved in on 1 September 1952, initially with D.H Vampire aircraft and then with Hawker Hunter aircraft. The unit stayed until 13 July 1957. The airfield closed in September 1957. Post 1958 part of former RAF Pembrey airfield was turned over to agriculture and part was used as a motor racing circuit. On Thursday 22 August 1997 Pembrey was officially opened as a civil airfield by Captain Winston Thomas at a cost of 3.5 million pounds and named Pembrey West Wales Airport using a single runway (04/22) with a declared length of 805 metres. On 18 December 2009, Isles of Scilly Skybus operated the first charter flight into the airport.

Regulations are primarily at . Similar procedures are followed in the European Union, Japan, and Canada.  Types  Timeline for drug evaluation * Commercial INDs are filed by companies to obtain marketing approval for a new drug. * Research or investigator INDs are non-commercial INDs filed by researchers to study an unapproved drug or to study an approved drug for a new indication or in a new patient population. * Emergency Use INDs, also called compassionate use or single-patient INDs, are filed for emergency use of an unapproved drug when the clinical situation does not allow sufficient time to submit an IND in accordance with 21 CFR ¬ß¬ß 312.23, 312.24. These are most commonly used for life-threatening conditions for which there is no standard treatment. * Treatment INDs are filed to make a drug available for treatment of serious or immediately life-threatening conditions prior to FDA approval. Serious diseases or conditions are stroke, schizophrenia, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, chronic depression, seizures, Alzheimer's dementia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and narcolepsy. * Screening INDs are filed for multiple, closely related compounds in order to screen for the preferred compounds or formulations. The preferred compound can then be developed under a separate IND. Used for screening different salts, esters and other drug derivatives that are chemically different, but pharmacodynamically similar.  Application  The IND application may be divided into the following categories: # Preclinical testing consists of animal pharmacology and toxicology studies to assess whether the drug is safe for testing in humans. Also included are any previous experience with the drug in humans (often foreign use). # Manufacturing Information includes composition, manufacturer, and stability of, and the controls used for, manufacturing the drug. Used to ensure that the company can adequately produce and supply consistent batches of the drug. # Investigator information on the qualifications of clinical investigators, that is, the professionals (generally physicians) who oversee the administration of the experimental drug to the study subjects. Used to assess whether the investigators are qualified to fulfill their clinical trial duties. # Clinical trial protocols are the centerpiece of the IND. Detailed protocols for proposed clinical studies to assess whether the initial-phase trials will expose the subjects to unnecessary risks. # Other commitments are commitments to obtain informed consent from the research subjects, to obtain review of the study by an institutional review board (IRB), and to adhere to the investigational new drug regulations. An IND must also include an Investigator's Brochure intended to educate the trial investigators of the significant facts about the trial drug they need to know to conduct their clinical trial with the least hazard to the subjects or patients. Once an IND is submitted, the FDA has 30 days to object to the IND or it automatically becomes effective and clinical trials may begin. If the FDA detects a problem, it may place a clinical hold on the IND, prohibiting the start of the clinical studies until the problem is resolved. Experimental drugs under an IND must be labeled \\"Caution: New Drug ‚Äì Limited by Federal (or United States) law to investigational use.\\"  Prevalence  Approximately two-thirds of both INDs and new drug applications (NDAs) are small-molecule drugs. The rest is biopharmaceuticals. About half of the INDs fail in preclinical and clinical phases of drug development.  Examples  The FDA runs a medical marijuana IND program (the Compassionate Investigational New Drug program). It stopped accepting new patients in 1992 after public health authorities concluded there was no scientific value to it, and due to President George H.W. Bush administration's desire to \\"get tough on crime and drugs.\\" As of 2011, four patients continue to receive cannabis from the government under the program. Sanctioned by Executive Order 13139, the US Department of Defense employed an anthrax vaccine classified as an investigational new drug (IND) in its Anthrax Vaccine Immunization Program (AVIP).

Neo-Futurists in theatre were inspired by the Italian Futurist movement from the early 20th century. The Neo-Futurist architects, designers and artists believe in eco- sustainable cities cross-pollinated by arts and technology to provide a better quality of life; the definition of Neo-Futurism in art and architecture came from the reference to the United Nations‚Äô report Our Common Future.World Commission on Environment and Development (1987). Our Common Future. Oxford: Oxford University Press. p. 27. In theater The Neo-Futurist aesthetic demands that everything that transpires in their theater be non-illusory, which is to say that they pretend nothing; actors only play themselves. All plays take place on a stage, specifically, the stage on which they are performed, in the present. If one of the performers reports that something has happened, you can bet that it really happened. Much of their work contains the possibility of failure, a unique theatrical component that keeps them and the audience honest. Their plays are wildly eclectic, touching on all genres and tones; plays may be political, satirical, personal, tragic, comic, abstract, musical, surreal, poetic, and so on. The bottom line is that Neo-Futurism does not buy into the \\"suspension of disbelief\\"‚Äîit does not attempt to take the audience anywhere else at any other time with any other people. The idea is to deal with what is going on right here and now. The Neo-Futurists began with the show Too Much Light Makes the Baby Go Blind: 30 Plays in 60 Minutes, often abbreviated as TMLMTBGB (though many refer to it simply as TML). For the first few years, the Neo-Futurist movement consisted entirely of TMLMTBGB, but then expanded to include \\"prime time productions.\\" These productions began late evening, as opposed to TMLMTBGB late-night starting time (11:30 in Chicago, 10:30 in New York). The Neo-Futurists have published three books of plays from TMLMTBGB - two books of regular plays, and one of plays that use only one actor. They've also released one CD recording of plays from Too Much Light Makes the Baby Go Blind, one video, and a recording of Jokes and their Relation to the Unconscious, a play described as an attempt to destroy comedy by analyzing it to death. In 2008 the New York Neo-Futurists put on (Not) Just a Day Like Any Other, four autobiographical stories woven together with accompanying Bollywood music videos, relationships charted via PowerPoint, and margaritas for all. In 2011, the New York Neo-Futurists produced an original piece, \\"Locker 4173b,\\" wherein Neo-Futurists Joey Rizzolo and Christopher Borg purchased a foreclosed storage locker and, as amateur archaeologists, excavated, catalogued, and chronicled their findings.\\"New York Times article, 'Finding the Drama in What Life Has Left Behind' by Corey Kilgannon\\" New York Times.com, accessed August 6, 2012 The show received critical acclaim and received a New York Innovative Theater Award for Outstanding Performance Art Production in 2011.\\"New York Innovative Theater Awards Listing, '2011 Recipients'\\" nyitawards.com, accessed August 6, 2012 The New York Neo- Futurists were also New York Innovative Theatre Awards recipients for 'Outstanding Performance Art Production' in 2006, 2011, & 2017, 'Outstanding Ensemble' in 2009, and the Caffe Cino Award 2010. They also have been nominated for two Drama Desk awards in 2012 and 2014. In 2009 the New York company won the Village Voice Readers‚Äô Choice poll for Best Performance Art and was named one of the nytheatre.com People of the Year. They ventured into producing short films in under the umbrella of the Neo-Futurist aesthetic in 2007 and in 2020 during the global pandemic started a twice weekly podcast called 'Hit Play'. In November 2016, Greg Allen announced in an emailed press release that he intended to revoke the Chicago company's rights to perform TMLMTBGB. Allen had ceased to be a member of the performing ensemble four years prior, and in his announcement he stated his intention to form a new company to perform the show as a way to \\"combat the Drumpf administration.\\" In a response statement, the Neo-Futurists stated that they were \\"disappointed that it has come to this conclusion,\\" but that \\"throughout our long history with Greg there have been considerable artistic differences and irreconcilable personal conflicts.\\" Additionally, a former artistic director and ensemble member disputed Allen's claim that the split was motivated by external politics, citing instead ongoing personality conflicts. In solidarity with the Chicago company, the New York and San Francisco productions of Too Much Light also closed that December. Subsequently, the Neo-Futurists developed and opened a new weekly late-night show in 2017 titled The Infinite Wrench in all three branches to continue to showcase their two-minute plays. The Chicago ensemble notably reached their 10,000th play on September 29th, 2017.

The mall's primary trade area includes Iowa City, Cedar Rapids, and other parts of eastern Iowa. It is owned and managed by Brookfield Properties Retail Group, which acquired the original developer of the mall, General Growth Properties, in 2018. The mall has a total floor area of 1,187,097 square feet (110,285 m2), with a gross leasable area of 979,415 square feet (90,991 m2). It also features a 1,000-seat food court with Wi-Fi internet access, a large \\"antique\\" carousel, a children's play area, and an NHL regulation-sized ice rink. While the ice rink is primarily used for public skating, the University of Iowa Hawkeyes hockey team plays most of its home games there. The mall's anchor stores are PetSmart, Tuesday Morning, Marshalls, Barnes & Noble, Chico's, Dillard's, Ashley HomeStore, Marcus Cinema, The Iowa Children's Museum, Best Buy, Target, Forever 21, Scheels All Sports, JCPenney, Old Navy, Shoe Dept. Encore, Five Below, Ulta Beauty, and HomeGoods. History Coral Ridge Mall opened on July 29, 1998, with 100% of its floor space leased. It attracted one million visitors in its first 30 days and continues to attract roughly 10 million visitors a year. It also spawned additional retail development at the interchange of I-80 and Iowa Highway 965, now known as Coral Ridge Avenue. Big-box stores such as Kohl's, Lowe's, Dressbarn and a Wal-Mart Supercenter (currently branded as simply Walmart) have opened in the years following Coral Ridge's opening. In 2013 Sears closed. Spirit Halloween has leased vacant anchor spots on a yearly basis In July 2016, the former Sears was demolished to make way for six new stores. In January 2017, Hollister Co. permanently closed at Coral Ridge Mall. It was later announced that Victoria's Secret would expand into the Hollister space. In April 2017, Coral Ridge announced HomeGoods, Marshalls, PetSmart and Ulta Beauty opens in September. On April 18, 2018 it was announced that Younkers will close, as the parent, Bon-Ton Stores, is going out of business. On August 29, 2018 Younkers closed its doors permanently. The mall has four anchors remaining. On January 19, 2019 Iowa's last Abercrombie & Fitch located at Coral Ridge Mall closed permanently. In March 2019 Five Below opens. In November 2019 Ashley HomeStore opens in former Younkers. On February 21, 2020 Tuesday Morning opens. Economic impact When Coral Ridge Mall was planned, Iowa City business owners were concerned that the mall would take business away from them. While taxable sales in Coralville increased from $171.2 million in 1998 to $314.6 million in 1999, sales in Iowa City increased from $701.1 million to $733.3 million in that same period. By 2006 taxable sales in Coralville would grow to $549.7 million while sales in Iowa City grew to $901.4 million. However, a 2000 report by Iowa State University economics professor Kenneth Stone stated that 18 eastern Iowa counties lost over $120 million in retail sales to Johnson County in Coral Ridge's first year. In addition, despite the overall increase in taxable sales, general merchandise and apparel sales in Iowa City declined between 1997 and 2007. Several malls in eastern Iowa, including Old Capitol Mall in downtown Iowa City and Westdale Mall in Cedar Rapids, saw an increased number of store closings after Coral Ridge Mall opened. Most of Coral Ridge Mall's anchors, except for Younkers and Dillard's, relocated from other shopping centers in the Iowa City area; Younkers ran two stores in Johnson County before closing its Old Capitol Mall store in January 2005. By 2008, Old Capitol Mall and Sycamore Mall in Iowa City would rebound to 95 percent occupancy under local ownership while downtown Iowa City merchants began to focus on specialty retail. Coral Ridge Mall was built in a tax increment financing district. The Des Moines Register reported on August 13, 2006, that the city of Coralville was using the $7 million in property taxes generated by the mall to pay off long-term debts on a new hotel and convention center instead of using it for local services. Incidents at Coral Ridge Mall On September 3, 2003, during routine structural checks, officials discovered someone had been secretly growing marijuana near the mall's ceiling. No plants themselves were found but growing lights, gardening pots, and seeds were found in the roof space above one of the tenants. The amount of marijuana that had been grown could not be determined. The perpetrator faced an additional five years to their prison sentence due to the proximity of the Iowa Children's Museum in Coral Ridge Mall. On June 12, 2015, at approximately 7:30PM, a 20-year-old woman who worked at the Iowa Children's Museum was shot at her place of employment near the food court area. She was transported to University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics where she died a short time later. An eyewitness, who worked at a kiosk in the mall, said the shooter was a mall security guard who had allegedly been fired for harassing the victim earlier in the day.

Districts of Woodhouse ward=Woodhouse Woodhouse Village Cross, in the market place Woodhouse () is a former farming and coal-mining village, now a suburb and housing estate in the south-east of Sheffield. It is served by regular buses to Sheffield and has a station on the Sheffield‚ÄìLincoln railway line. The old Cross Daggers public house, the base of the village market cross and the stocks can be seen in the centre of the suburb. Many other old cottages, including a wattle and daub house dating from the fifteenth century, were demolished in the 1960s as part of a major redevelopment.J. Edward Vickers, The Ancient Suburbs of Sheffield, p.14 (1971) An old Quaker Meetinghouse dating to the 17th century was converted into private residences in the 1980s. Woodhouse is home to the Woodhouse Prize Band, a brass band founded in 1853. =History= Woodhouse today bears little resemblance to its humble beginnings. This farming village was, until the advent of coal mining in the area, relatively free of any kind of modern post-industrial revolution influence. The population was invariably engaged in either small-scale farming or farming related sub-industries such as early retail and tanning. Most of the architecture associated with this era has been lost but, luckily, a few reminders survive. Manor Farm Cottage, at the heart of the village, is a sympathetically restored old building and a reminder of Woodhouse's long-lost past. The advent of coal mining attracted an influx of young men and families wishing to capitalise on the various local mining ventures. Woodhouse grew quickly into a mining community with the opening of a number of mines within commuting distance. The village expanded considerably to accommodate the pit workers. Spa Lane, Back Lane and Sheffield Road quickly wound a new and expansive network of pit houses, ensuring that Woodhouse would become a 'pit village'. Woodhouse is home to the Woodhouse Prize Band, a brass band founded in 1853. A detailed history of the life of Woodhouse in 1912 and 1966 is available from Sheffield University library.Clark, David, Community and a Suburban Village, PhD thesis, 1969. =Sport= Woodhouse F.C. and Woodhouse Britannia F.C. represented the village in the FA Cup during the 1910s and 1920s. Woodhouse Mill Woodhouse Mill is generally accepted as the area, within the City of Sheffield, to the east of the former Great Central railway line. This was a farming area on which housing was developed over a period in the 20th century. The Shirtcliff Brook runs through the area but to avoid recurring flooding this has now been culverted.  Woodhouse Washlands Nature Reserve  The Woodhouse Washlands Nature Reserve, managed by the Wildlife Trust for Sheffield and Rotherham is situated in Woodhouse Mill and boasts several species of fish, birds and other wetland creatures. The River Rother runs through the wetlands.  Badger Road  The Badger estate was built in the 1960s as a solution to the severe housing shortage. The houses were supposed to be temporary but, after 50 years, they remain. The estate includes Badger Road, Badger Close, Badger Drive, Badger Place, Goathland Drive, Goathland Place and Station Road.

Overview  It appeared ca. 1700, probably influenced by the central European Theorbo and the Angelique which Cossack mercenaries would have encountered in the Thirty Years' War,N.Prokopenko \\"Kobza & Bandura\\" Kyiv, 1977 although the likelier possibility is that certain Tuliglowski, a paulite monk, was its inventor.Marcin Ludvicki \\"Teorban\\", Warsaw 1999 The Torban was manufactured and used mainly in Ukraine, but also occasionally encountered in neighbouring Poland and Russia (only 3 luthiers could be identified from the surviving instruments).Piotr Kowalcze, \\"Sympozjum: Teorban w polskich zbiorah muzealnych\\" Warsaw 2008 There are about 40 torbans in museums around the world, with the largest group of 14 instruments in St. Petersburg.Roman Turovsky \\"Torban\\" http://torban.org/torban3b.html The term \\"torban\\" was often misapplied in the vernacular in western Ukraine to any instrument of the Baroque Lute type until the early 20th century. The surviving printed musical literature for torban is extremely limited, notwithstanding the widespread use of the instrument in Eastern Europe. It was an integral part of the urban oral culture in Ukraine, both in Russian and Polish (later Austro-Hungarian Empire) controlled parts of the country (after the split). To date the only notated examples of torban music recorded are a group of songs from the repertoire of Franz Widort; collected by Ukrainian composer and ethnographer Mykola Lysenko and published in the \\"Kievskaya Starina\\" journal in 1892, with a collection of songs by Tomasz Padura published in Warsaw in 1844. The multi-strung, expensive in manufacture, stringing, maintenance and technically difficult fretted torban was considered an instrument of Ukrainian gentry,K.Moszinki, \\"Kultura narodowa slowianska\\" (1934) although most of its practitioners were Ukrainians and Jews of low birth, with a few aristocratic exceptions (e.g. Ivan Mazepa, Andrei Razumovsky, Padura, Rzewucki). A few virtuoso players are known by their reputation, such as Andrey Sychra (from Lithuania), and the Widort family, originally from Austria but active in Ukraine since the late 18th century. The Widort family produced three generations of torban players: Gregor Widort, his son Cajetan, and grandson Franz.V.Dutchak \\"Bandura in scientific studies of Polish researchers\\" Such aristocratic associations sealed the instrument's fate in the aftermath of the Russian Revolution: it was deemed insufficiently proletarian and was discouraged. A predecessor of the torban called the kobza (also known sometimes referred to as the bandura) was the instrument of the common folk. It differed from the torban by the absence of a second peg box at the end of the neck and the lack of bass strings, and was closely related in its organology to central European mandora and other instruments descending from the pandura (also see lute). Later in the 20th century, some banduras were often manufactured to imitate the look of the torban, which has also contributed to its misidentification.

It is emerged from the convergence of multiple disciplines that are concerned both with understanding human beings and with the design of computational artifacts. Human-centered computing is closely related to human-computer interaction and information science. Human-centered computing is usually concerned with systems and practices of technology use while human-computer interaction is more focused on ergonomics and the usability of computing artifacts and information science is focused on practices surrounding the collection, manipulation, and use of information. Human-centered computing researchers and practitioners usually come from one or more of disciplines such as computer science, human factors, sociology, psychology, cognitive science, anthropology, communication studies, graphic design and industrial design. Some researchers focus on understanding humans, both as individuals and in social groups, by focusing on the ways that human beings adopt and organize their lives around computational technologies. Others focus on designing and developing new computational artifacts.  Overview = Scope  HCC aims at bridging the existing gaps between the various disciplines involved with the design and implementation of computing systems that support human's activities. Meanwhile, it is a set of methodologies that apply to any field that uses computers in applications in which people directly interact with devices or systems that use computer technologies. HCC facilitates the design of effective computer systems that take into account personal, social, and cultural aspects and addresses issues such as information design, human information interaction, human-computer interaction, human-human interaction, and the relationships between computing technology and art, social, and cultural issues.  HCC topics  The National Science Foundation (NSF) defines the trends of HCC research as \\"a three dimensional space comprising human, computer, and environment.\\" According to the NSF, the human dimension ranges from research that supports individual needs, through teams as goal-oriented groups, to society as an unstructured collection of connected people. The computer dimension ranges from fixed computing devices, through mobile devices, to computational systems of visual/audio devices that are embedded in the surrounding physical environment. The environment dimension ranges from discrete physical computational devices, through mixed reality systems, to immersive virtual environments. Some examples of topics in the field are listed below. = List of topics in HCC field = * Problem-solving in distributed environments, ranging across Internet-based information systems, grids, sensor-based information networks, and mobile and wearable information appliances. * Multimedia and multi-modal interfaces in which combinations of speech, text, graphics, gesture, movement, touch, sound, etc. are used by people and machines to communicate with one another. * Intelligent interfaces and user modeling, information visualization, and adaptation of content to accommodate different display capabilities, modalities, bandwidth and latency. * Multi- agent systems that control and coordinate actions and solve complex problems in distributed environments in a wide variety of domains, such as disaster response teams, e-commerce, education, and successful aging. * Models for effective computer-mediated human-human interaction under a variety of constraints, (e.g., video conferencing, collaboration across high vs. low bandwidth networks, etc.). * Definition of semantic structures for multimedia information to support cross-modal input and output. * Specific solutions to address the special needs of particular communities. * Collaborative systems that enable knowledge-intensive and dynamic interactions for innovation and knowledge generation across organizational boundaries, national borders, and professional fields. * Novel methods to support and enhance social interaction, including innovative ideas like social orthotics, affective computing, and experience capture. * Studies of how social organizations, such as government agencies or corporations, respond to and shape the introduction of new information technologies, especially with the goal of improving scientific understanding and technical design. * Knowledge-driven human- computer interaction that uses ontologies to address the semantic ambiguities between human and computer's understandings towards mutual behaviors * Human- centered semantic relatedness measure that employs human power to measure the semantic relatedness between two concepts  Human-centered systems  Human- centered systems (HCS) are systems designed for human-centered computing. This approach was developed by Mike Cooley in his book Architect or Bee? http://www.spokesmanbooks.com/Spokesman/PDF/131OGrady.pdf  Architect or Bee? The human price of technology drawing on his experience working with the Lucas Plan. HCS focuses on the design of interactive systems as they relate to human activities. According to Kling et al., the Committee on Computing, Information, and Communication of the National Science and Technology Council, identified human-centered systems, or HCS, as one of five components for a High Performance Computing Program. Human-centered systems can be referred to in terms of human-centered automation. According to Kling et al., HCS refers to \\"systems that are: # based on the analysis of the human tasks the system is aiding # monitored for performance in terms of human benefits # built to take account of human skills and # adaptable easily to changing human needs.\\" In addition, Kling et al. defines four dimensions of human-centeredness that should be taken into account when classifying a system: systems that are human centered must analyze the complexity of the targeted social organization, and the varied social units that structure work and information; human centeredness is not an attribute of systems, but a process in which the stakeholder group of a particular system assists in evaluating the benefit of the system; the basic architecture of the system should reflect a realistic relationship between humans and machines; the purpose and audience the system is designed for should be an explicit part of the design, evaluation, and use of the system.  Human-centered activities in multimedia  Wikimania human- centered design visualization, created by Myriapoda. The human-centered activities in multimedia, or HCM, can be considered as follows according to: media production, annotation, organization, archival, retrieval, sharing, analysis, and communication, which can be clustered into three areas: production, analysis, and interaction.  Multimedia production  Multimedia production is the human task of creating media. For instance, photographing, recording audio, remixing, etc. It is important that all aspects of media production concerned should directly involve humans in HCM. There are two main characteristics of multimedia production. The first is culture and social factors. HCM production systems should consider cultural differences and be designed according to the culture in which they will be deployed. The second is to consider human abilities. Participants involved in HCM production should be able to complete the activities during the production process.  Multimedia analysis  Multimedia analysis can be considered as a type of HCM applications which is the automatic analysis of human activities and social behavior in general. There is a broad area of potential relevant uses from facilitating and enhancing human communications, to allowing for improved information access and retrieval in the professional, entertainment, and personal domains.  Multimedia interaction  Multimedia interaction can be considered as the interaction activity area of HCM. It is paramount to understand both how humans interact with each other and why, so that we can build systems to facilitate such communication and so that people can interact with computers in natural ways. To achieve natural interaction, cultural differences and social context are primary factors to consider, due to the potential different cultural backgrounds. For instance, a couple of examples include: face-to-face communications where the interaction is physically located and real-time; live-computer mediated communications where the interaction is physically remote but remains real-time; and non-real time computer-mediated communications such as instant SMS, email, etc.  Human- Centered Design Process  The Human-Centered Design Process is a method to problem-solving used in design. The process involves, first, empathizing with the user to learn about the target audience of the product and understand their needs. Empathizing will then lead to research, and asking the target audience specific question to further understand their goals for the product at hand. This researching stage may also involve competitor analysis to find more design opportunities in the product's market. Once the designer has compiled data on the user and the market for their product design, they will then move on to the ideation stage, in which they will brainstorm design solutions through sketches and wireframes. Wireframing is a digital or physical illustration of a user interface, focusing on information architecture, space allocation, and content functionality. Consequently, a wireframe typically doesn't have any colors or graphics and only focuses on the intended functionalities of the interface. To conclude the Human-Centered Design Process, there are two final steps. Upon wireframing or sketching, the designer will usually turn their paper sketches or low-fidelity wireframes into high-fidelity prototypes. Prototyping allows the designer to explore their design ideas further and focus on the overall design concept. High- fidelity means that the prototype is interactive or \\"clickable\\" and simulates the a real application. After creating this high-fidelity prototype of their design, the designer can then conduct usability testing. This involves collecting participants that represent the target audience of the product and having them walk through the prototype as if they were using the real product. The goal of usability testing is to identify any issues with the design that need to be improved and analyze how real users will interact with the product. To run an effective usability test, it is imperative to take notes on the users behavior and decisions and also have the user thinking out loud while they use the prototype.  Career = Academic programs  As human- centered computing has become increasingly popular, many universities have created special programs for HCC research and study for both graduate and undergraduate students. User interface designer A user interface designer is an individual who usually with a relevant degree or high level of knowledge, not only on technology, cognitive science, human‚Äìcomputer interaction, learning sciences, but also on psychology and sociology. A user interface designer develops and applies user-centered design methodologies and agile development processes that includes consideration for overall usability of interactive software applications, emphasizing interaction design and front-end development. Information architect (IA) Information architects mainly work to understand user and business needs in order to organize information to best satisfy these needs. Specifically, information architects often act as a key bridge between technical and creative development in a project team. Areas of interest in IA include search schemas, metadata, and taxonomy.  Projects = NASA/Ames Computational Sciences Division  NASA Mars Project The Human-Centered Computing (HCC) group at NASA/Ames Computational Sciences Division is conducting research at Haughton as members of the Haughton-Mars Project (HMP) to determine, via an analog study, how we will live and work on Mars. # HMP/Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) Field Robotics Experiments‚ÄîHCC is collaborating with researchers on the HMP/CMU field robotics research program at Haughton to specify opportunities for robots assisting scientists. Researchers in this project has carried out a parallel investigation that documents work during traverses. A simulation module has been built, using a tool that represents people, their tools, and their work environment, that will serve as a partial controller for a robot that assist scientists in the field work in mars. When it comes to take human, computing and environment all into consideration, theory and techniques in HCC filed will be the guideline. # Ethnography of Human Exploration of Space‚ÄîHCC lab is carrying out an ethnographic study of scientific field work, covering all aspects of a scientist's life in the field. This study involves observing as participants at Haughton and writing about HCC lab\`s experiences. HCC lab then look for patterns in how people organize their time, space, and objects and how they relate to each other to accomplish their goals. In this study, HCC lab is focusing on learning and conceptual change.  Center for Cognitive Ubiquitous Computing (CUbiC) at Arizona State University  Note- Taker device with initial inventor David Hayden Based on the principles of human-centered computing, the Center for Cognitive Ubiquitous Computing (CUbiC) at Arizona State University develops assistive, rehabilitative and healthcare applications. Founded by Sethuraman Panchanathan in 2001, CUbiC research spans three main areas of multimedia computing: sensing and processing, recognition and learning, and interaction and delivery. CUbiC places an emphasis on transdisciplinary research and positions individuals at the center of technology design and development. Examples of such technologies include the Note-Taker, a device designed to aid students with low vision to follow classroom instruction and take notes, and VibroGlove, which conveys facial expressions via haptic feedback to people with visual impairments. In 2016, researchers at CUbiC introduced ‚ÄúPerson-Centered Multimedia Computing,\\" a new paradigm adjacent to HCC, which aims to understand a user‚Äôs needs, preferences, and mannerisms including cognitive abilities and skills to design ego-centric technologies. Person-centered multimedia computing stresses the multimedia analysis and interaction facets of HCC to create technologies that can adapt to new users despite being designed for an individual.

His career highlights include selection as a National League (NL) All- Star, playing for the Phillies in the NL Championship Series and World Series, and appearing for the Cubs in the NL Division Series. Early life and career Morandini grew up in the Pittsburgh suburb of Leechburg, Pennsylvania, where he attended Leechburg Area High School. After graduation, Morandini attended Indiana University, where he started his college career as a center fielder, moving to the infield as a third baseman and shortstop after his freshman year. In 1987, he played collegiate summer baseball in the Cape Cod Baseball League (CCBL) for the Yarmouth-Dennis Red Sox, winning the league batting title, and being named league MVP. In 2005, he was inducted into the CCBL Hall of Fame. Morandini declined the option to enter the Major League Baseball draft in 1987, citing his desire to play for the United States national team in the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea. After appearing in one game during the Olympics, he returned to Indiana for his senior season; he was named a second-team All-American for the 1988 season. Morandini graduated as the Indiana University record-holder in several statistical categories, including runs scored (277), doubles (61), triples (29), and stolen bases (127). The Philadelphia Phillies selected Morandini in the fifth round of the 1988 Major League Baseball Draft. Minor leagues After drafting Morandini, the Phillies assigned him to the Spartanburg Phillies, one of their A-level affiliates in Spartanburg, South Carolina. He played in 63 games for Spartanburg in 1989, batting .338 with 19 doubles, earning him a promotion to the high-A Clearwater Phillies. In Florida, he notched 19 hits and 14 runs scored in 63 at-bats; he also batted in four runs. Finishing the season with the AA-level Reading Phillies, Morandini hit 5 home runs in 188 at-bats, posting a .351 average. Morandini won the 1989 Paul Owens Award as the top minor league position player in the Phillies organization. Morandini committed 22 errors in his first professional season as a shortstop and with Dickie Thon playing shortstop at the major league level, the Phillies organization shifted him to his eventual major league position, second base during the 1989 Florida Instructional league season. Morandini spent the majority of the 1990 season with the AAA Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Red Barons. While playing in 139 games, he stole 16 bases and batted in 31 runs in 503 at- bats. He also batted .260 and scored 76 runs. During this season, Morandini was named 41st out of the top 50 prospects in Major League Baseball by Baseball America. The move to second base improved his fielding percentage greatly; Morandini cut his errors in half in only one season, posting 11 with Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. He also earned a short promotion to the major league club; he played in 25 games, hitting 4 doubles and 1 home run in 87 plate appearances. Major league career=1990‚Äì1997: Philadelphia Phillies After a short stint in Scranton to start 1991, Morandini returned to the major leagues for the remainder of his career. He amassed four triples and thirteen stolen bases in his first full season, highlighting his speed. The following season produced one of the most memorable moments of Morandini's career. In a game against the Pittsburgh Pirates on September 20, 1992, he turned an unassisted triple play. In the sixth inning, Morandini caught a line drive off of the bat of Jeff King, touched second base to put out Andy Van Slyke, and tagged out Barry Bonds coming from first base; the Pirates went on to win the game, 3‚Äì2, in extra innings. It was the first unassisted triple play since 1968, and the first in the National League since 1927. Morandini was also the first second baseman in National League history, and the first in the regular season, to turn an unassisted triple play; all previous occurrences were made by first basemen or shortstops. The only other second baseman to achieve the feat prior was Bill Wambsganss, who turned a triple play in the 1920 World Series. The Phillies appeared in the World Series in 1993 with Morandini at the top of the lineup; he batted second in manager Jim Fregosi's batting order more often than any other position. During the season, he turned 48 double plays with infield partner Kevin Stocker. Morandini had a .247 batting average during the season, the lowest among the Phillies' starters; he was second on the team in stolen bases to Lenny Dykstra, and led the team in triples with nine. His triples total was also tied for third-best in the National League. In 1994, Morandini posted the highest on-base plus slugging percentage (OPS) of his career, with a .787 mark. He also walked 34 times in 316 plate appearances, but lost playing time to Mariano Duncan, who appeared at all four infield positions throughout the season. 1995 was arguably Morandini's finest season; he batted .283 with 6 home runs, 7 triples, and 49 RBI. He was also named to the 1995 All-Star team; he appeared in the game, going 0-for-1, and was one of five Phillies to be selected for the team. Morandini racked up the highest stolen base total of his career in 1996, with 26, though it was a down year for him statistically. His batting average was .250, with 3 home runs, 6 triples, and 24 doubles. He struck out 87 times while walking 49, and amassed 135 hits in 606 plate appearances. The following year, his batting average was at its highest point during his career as a Phillie; Morandini hit .295 and slugged .380. He posted a fielding percentage of .990, making only 6 errors while recording 87 double plays; Morandini's defense throughout his career earned him the nickname \\"Dandy Little Glove Man\\". After the 1997 season, Morandini was traded to the Chicago Cubs for outfielder Doug Glanville. 1998‚Äì1999: Chicago Cubs In 1998, Morandini posted a .296 batting average, along with 172 hits, 8 home runs, and 53 RBI, all career highs. He and the Cubs also appeared in the 1998 National League Division Series, but lost to the Atlanta Braves. Morandini made his only appearance in the Most Valuable Player award balloting, tying with Javy L√≥pez for 24th in the voting. Morandini's production declined in 1999, as he hit .241 and scored 60 runs, and he chose free agency after the season, signing with the Montr√©al Expos in January 2000. 2000: Last season and retirement Two months after signing with Montr√©al, the Phillies purchased his rights from the Expos, and he returned to Philadelphia for the 2000 season. After batting .252 and hitting four triples for the Phillies, they traded him to the Toronto Blue Jays in August for Rob Ducey. Morandini played his final two months in the American League, batting at the bottom of the order for the Jays. He had 29 hits in 107 at-bats, good for a .271 average, and stole a base. Career statistics In 1298 games over 11 seasons, Morandini posted a .268 batting average (1222-for-4558) with 597 runs, 209 doubles, 54 triples, 32 home runs, 351 RBI, 123 stolen bases, 437 bases on balls, .338 on-base percentage and .359 slugging percentage. He finished his career with a .989 fielding percentage as a second baseman. In 10 postseason games, he batted .233 (7-for-30) with 3 runs, 1 triple, 3 RBI and 3 walks. Post-player activities Morandini resided in Chesterton, Indiana where the family opened a stationery business. He was the head baseball coach at Valparaiso High School until accepting the manager's position for the Williamsport Crosscutters, one of the Phillies' A-level affiliates, for the 2011 season. On November 21, 2011 he was named the 10th manager of the Philadelphia Phillies A-level Affiliate Lakewood BlueClaws.

At present, the economy of Altea is based on tourism, which started to grow in the 1950s because of its good weather, beaches and the labyrinthine streets with whitewashed house-fronts that characterize the town. Altea is protected on the north by the bluffs of the Serra de B√®rnia, creating an especially mild microclimate. Its seafront esplanade is planted with palms. History The Iberian coastal settlements at the mouth of the Algar river in the wide Bay of Altea were later joined by a Greek marketplace, named Althaia.Althaia, with an implication of curative power, was the name of several nymphs in Greek mythology, and of the mother of Meleager. During the Moorish domination the land around Altea belonged to the Taifa of D√©nia until it was recaptured by the Christians in 1244 under James I of Aragon. The town was quickly fortified, and walls were erected to enclose what is now known as the \\"old town\\" outsiders. Main sights This maze of cobbled narrow and crooked streets with glimpses of the bay is one of the better features of the town. Other sights include the church of La Mare de D√©u del Consol (\\"Our Lady of Solace\\"), easily identifiable by its picturesque blue and white domes, tiled with glazed ceramics. There are numerous quaint restaurants near the church, some with a view over the Mediterranean. Note that, if visiting by car, you will need to park several blocks away from the church area as the immediately surrounding area is either off limits to cars and/or the streets are so narrow and steep (or have stairs) that cars cannot pass.

Twin towns - sister cities Altea is a founding member of the Douzelage, a unique town twinning association of 24 towns across the European Union. This active town twinning began in 1991 and there are regular events, such as a produce market from each of the other countries and festivals.

Fairfields, as it is often known, was a major warship builder, turning out many vessels for the Royal Navy and other navies through the First World War and the Second World War. It also built many transatlantic liners, including record breaking ships for the Cunard Line and Canadian Pacific, such as the Blue Riband- winning sisters RMS Campania and RMS Lucania. At the other end of the scale Fairfields built fast cross-channel mail steamers and ferries for locations around the world. These included ships for the Bosporus crossing in Istanbul and some of the early ships used by Thomas Cook for developing tourism on the River Nile.  John Elder & Co and predecessors = Millwright Randolph & Elliott  Charles Randolph founded the company as Randolph & Co. He had been an apprentice at the Clyde shipyard of Robert Napier, and at William Fairbairn & Sons in Manchester. With the knowledge that he acquired, he started as a millwright in partnership with his cousin Richard S. Cunliff, who managed the commercial side. By 1834 it built engines and machinery in the Tradeston district of Glasgow in 1834. It was the first serious local manufacturer of cog and other large wheels for driving machinery, and soon became famous for accuracy. In 1839 Mr Elliott joined the firm and it became known as Randolph, Elliott & Co. Elliott died shortly after becoming a partner.  Randolph, Elder and Co starts to build ship engines  In 1852 the company became Randolph, Elder and Company when John Elder (1824-1869) joined the business. John Elder had a natural talent for engineering and had worked at the shipyard of Robert Napier. It enabled the company to start diversifying into marine engineering. In this field the company would acquire world fame. Its skills in this field also enabled it to become one of the biggest ship builders of the world. The story is closely connected to the application of the compound steam engine for marine use, in which the firm played a crucial role. With regard to the compound engine two specific phases can be discerned: 'low' pressure compound engines and 'high' pressure compound engines. The compound engine with low (as it would later be called) pressure would give Randolph, Elder and Co its first renown for economic compound engines. The company's attempts centered on trying to prevent energy loss due to friction and due to premature condensation of steam. In July 1854 the screw steamer Brandon was fit with engines by Randolph, Elder & Co. It had a vertical geared compound engine with a patented (January 1853) arrangement of the cylinders. The crankshaft was turned by two opposite cranks (arms). One was driven by the high-pressure cylinder, the other by the low-pressure cylinder, with the pistons always moving in opposite directions. Brandon, a vessel of about 800 tons and 800 ihp made her trials in July 1854. She had a coal consumption of about 3.25 lbs per ihp per hour. At the time the lowest rate of consumption in other steamers was about 4-4.5 lbs per ihp per hour. The merits the engine of Brandon were not enough to persuade others, and from 1854 till about 1866 Randolph, Elder and Co were the only engineers who made compound engines under their various patents. The Pacific Steam Navigation Company did become an enthusiastic customer. In 1855-1856 it operated on the west coast of South America. In that area fuel was imported from Britain and therefore more costly. When the Crimean War broke out, freight tariffs increased to the point that the price of coal almost doubled there. The directors then conferred with the company, resulting in the 'double-cylinder engine'. Inca and Valparaiso were paddle- steamers which got this engine, that got patented in March 1856. Construction of that for Inca was started in May 1856. It had two pairs of cylinders, lying so their piston rods were at a 60-90 degree angle. Each pair consisted of a high- and low-pressure cylinder lying next to each other, so they could easily exchange steam. Their pistons moved in opposite directions, and drove one crank, which was attached to the crankshaft opposite the crank of the other pair. This gave the optimal balance of driving forces that could be attained for this number of cylinders. Furthermore, the cylinders were 'jacketed' at the top and bottom. The jacket heated the cylinder from the outside to prevent condensation in the cylinder. It had been invented by James Watt, but the company was the first to re-apply it, probably because it first understood its purpose. The company then supplied more double-cylinder engines, but with the cylinders completely jacketed. Admiral by Robert Napier, made her trial in June 1858. Another ship with the same engine was Callao built by John Reid in 1858. On trials fuel consumption for these ships was: Inca 2.5 lbs/ihp/h, Callao 2.7 lbs/ihp/h, Valparaiso and Admiral 3 lbs/ihp/h. It amounted to a saving of 30-40 percent, and this was maintained later on. It made it possible to continue steam navigation on the Pacific Ocean with profit. In fact, in 1858 the Pacific Steam Navigation Company had 7‚Äì8 years old traditional machinery removed from three of her large steamers, and replaced by compound engines. It saved 40% in fuel, and saved 30 feet of space amidships a 245 feet long vessel, because less space was needed for coal. From 1854 till about 1866 Randolph, Elder & Co. constructed 18 sets of paddle engines and 30 sets of screw engines, all compound. A highlight was the conversion of the frigate HMS Constance to steam propulsion in 1863, and her race against two frigates with engines by John Penn and Sons and Maudslay, Sons and Field. In 1860 the company started to use surface condensation instead of the jet condenser. In 1862 it increased steam pressure to 40 lbs per square inch.  Starts to build ships  In 1858 the company acquired the Govan Old Shipyard, and diversified into shipbuilding. The first ship was built in 1861 as No 14. Macgregor Laird was built for the African Steamship Company. Other ships soon followed, and the business moved to a new yard at the former Fairfield Farm at the Govan riverside in 1864. From 1861-1866 59 ships were built. The general breakthrough of the compound engine was not effected by Randolph, Elder & Co., but by Alfred Holt. Holt succeeded in getting the Board of Trade to lift the ban on boilers with a pressure higher than 25 lbs per square inch (psi). Use of high pressure steam made the compound engine far more effective, and Randolph, Elder & Co. quickly adjusted. It allowed the construction of a far simpler two-cylinder compound engine that was even more effective than the low pressure compound steam engine. In 1868 Charles Randolph retired from the firm, and John Elder became sole partner.  Vast expansion as John Elder & Co  The company became known as John Elder & Co in 1869. When John Elder died in September 1869 his wife ran the business for a while and renamed it in his honor. In 1869 she sold the company to a new partnership consisting of her brother John Francis Ure (1820-1883), J.L.K. Jamieson (1826-1883) and Sir William Pearce. It kept the name John Elder & Co. William Pearce became sole partner in 1878. The new owners continued the expansion of the shipyard in 1870 and onwards. Important customers in the 1861-1875 time slot were: the Pacific Steam Navigation Company for 40 vessels at 2,500,000 GBP, the African Mail Company and British and African Steam Navigation Company for 16 vessels at 500,000 GBP and Stoomvaart Maatschappij Nederland for 8 vessels at 600,000 GBP. Some qualitative notes further explain the leading position of the company at the time. In 1870 it launched Italy, a vessel of 400 feet, 4,200 tons gross measurement and 600 nominal hp. The largest vessel then afloat except for Great Eastern. In 1870-1871 it built two steamers for the London to Aberdeen line: City of London and Ban Righ were about 20% faster than their predecessors, while their fuel consumption was less than half of theirs. In 1871 Tagus and Moselle were launched for the Royal Mail Company's West India and Brazil trade. Both big steamers almost reached 15 knots on their trials. In 1873 it launched Iberia of 4,820 tons and 650 hp, the second largest merchant steamer then afloat. In 1871 HMS Hydra was launched with engines by John Elder.  Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company and successors  The imposing red sandstone offices of the Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company on Govan Road, which from 2013, has formed the Fairfield Heritage Centre. In 1886 William Pearce converted the firm to a limited company, the Fairfield Shipbuilding & Engineering Co. This also entailed a simultaneous name change to Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company, after the old farm. The area of the farm itself was purchased by Isabella Elder in 1885 and donated to the people of Govan as Elder Park, dedicated to her late husband. The shipyard's imposing red sandstone Drawing Offices were designed by John Keppie of Honeyman and Keppie, with help from a young Charles Rennie Mackintosh, and built 1889‚Äì91. The sculpted figures (The Engineer and the shipwright) flanking the entrance are by James Pittendrigh Macgillivray. John Carmichael was manager of the Fairfield yard in 1894. He had been born in Govan in 1858 and had entered Fairfield as an apprentice in 1873. When his apprenticeship was completed seven years later, Sir William Pearce made him head draughtsman, and later he was promoted to assistant manager. In February 1897 a major fire broke out in the yard.Isle of Man Times, Saturday, February 13, 1897; Page: 5Isle of Man Times, Tuesday, February 09, 1897; Page: 12 The fire spread rapidly and within ten minutes the vast majority of the buildings, covering several acres, were ablaze with the joiner's, pattern, and fitting shops totally destroyed. Various ships under construction were threatened, amongst which were and . The vessels were however separated from the buildings and no significant damage was sustained. The cost of the damage was estimated at ¬£40,000 and caused 4,000 workmen to be thrown idle. Alexander Cleghorn FRSE became the Fairfield manager in 1909. The company also established the Coventry Ordnance Works joint venture with Yarrow Shipbuilders and others in 1905. The Fairfield Titan was built for the yard in 1911 by Sir William Arrol & Co., with a maximum lift capacity of 200 tons. It was acknowledged for many years as the largest crane in the world. It was employed in lifting the engines and boilers aboard ships in the fitting out basin. The crane was a Category B listed building but was demolished in 2007 in yard modernisation works.  Subsidiary of Northumberland Shipbuilding Company  In 1919 the company became part of the Northumberland Shipbuilding Company, with Alexander Kennedy installed as managing director. In 1921 Alexander Kennedy was knighted. Sir Alexander became Fairfield chairman in 1930 and remained so until 1937. The Fairfield West Yard had been added at the outbreak of the First World War for submarine construction, but closed after ten years due to severe recession and was demolished by National Shipbuilders Securities in 1934. The Fairfield West yard site was later used by the United States Army Corps of Engineers in 1944 to build four landing craft. In 1924, the company bought a shipyard at Chepstow on the River Wye in South Wales, previously developed as National Shipyard No.1 in the First World War and then taken over by the Monmouthshire Shipbuilding Company. The works later specialised in assembling bridges and other major structures.  Subsidiary of Lithgows  In 1935 Fairfield was taken over by Lithgows of Port Glasgow after it had become entangled with the insolvency of the Anchor Line In the 1950s the yard underwent a major ¬£4 million modernisation programme which was implemented slowly over a period of ten years to minimise disruption to the yard. In 1963, the Fairfield engine building division merged with another Lithgow subsidiary, David Rowan & Company, to form Fairfield Rowan Ltd. Soon after the decade long shipyard modernisation works were completed, Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Ltd and Fairfield Rowan Ltd were placed into receivership and was subsequently sold by Lithgow's in 1965. Fairfield's Chepstow works was sold to the Mabey Group in 1966. The marine engine building subsidiary Fairfield Rowan was closed in 1966.  Fairfield (Glasgow) Ltd  The former Fairfield shipyard continues in operation as part of BAE Systems Surface Ships. The recently modernised shipbuilding operation was reconstituted as Fairfield (Glasgow) Ltd in 1966. It became known as the famous Fairfield Experiment, into new ways of improving productivity through new reforms to industrial relations and the application of scientific management methods to improve productivity. The era of the Fairfield experiment was captured by Sean Connery in his documentary The Bowler and the Bunnet.  Further decline and nationalization  In 1968 the company was made part of Upper Clyde Shipbuilders, which collapsed in 1971 when a strike and work-in received national press attention. As part of the recovery deal, Fairfields was formed into Govan Shipbuilders in 1972, which was itself later nationalised and subsumed into British Shipbuilders in 1977.  The shipyard as part of BAE  On the break-up of British Shipbuilders under denationalisation in 1988, the former Fairfield yard was sold to the Norwegian Kv√¶rner group and renamed Kvaerner Govan. The yard passed to BAE Systems Marine in 1999 and is now part of BAE Systems Surface Ships. Ships built  Daring-class Destroyer launched at Fairfield in 1950, was the Royal Navy's first all-welded warship. Some of the better-known ships built by Fairfield's include: Two of three Ships that were lost in the Action of 22 September 1914 were built at Fairfield's. These ships alongside HMS Hogue were the first vessels ever to be sunk by a German U Boat SM U9.

The plot centers on the invention of a new non-contaminating power source based on hydrogen and the attempts by the United States Government to prevent the spreading of this technology to other countries. The film was released in the United States on August 2, 1996. Plot Eddie Kasalivich is a machinist working with a team from the University of Chicago to convert hydrogen from water into clean energy. Eddie inadvertently discovers the secret: a sound frequency that enables a perfect stabilization of their process. The project team celebrates with a party at the lab, after which project physicist Dr. Lily Sinclair‚Äôs car will not start. Eddie gets her home by bus. Back in the lab, Drs. Alistair Barkley and Lu Chen are on their computers preparing to upload their discovery to the Internet so they can share the breakthrough with the world. A band of men enter the lab. Eddie returns to the lab to get his motorcycle, where he hears alarms coming from the lab. He runs inside to find Alistair dead with a plastic bag over his head and Chen nowhere to be found. The hydrogen reactor is dangerously unstable and Eddie is unable to shut it down. He speeds away on his motorbike as a concealed detonator triggers a massive hydrogen explosion that destroys the lab and surrounding streets. Eddie is questioned by the FBI. Upon returning with Lily to their homes, they realize that they are being framed, with planted evidence found in both of their houses. The two go on the run to an observatory belonging to Maggie McDermott, an old friend of Eddie's. They contact Paul Shannon, the wealthy man funding the project (secretly backed by DARPA), but they're almost caught in the process and barely manage to escape. As Eddie and Lily are evading more police, Paul meets with Lyman Earl Collier at C-Systems Research complex to discuss the current events. It becomes apparent that the plot to destroy the lab and frame Eddie and Lily for it was orchestrated by Lyman and the CIA. Despite some disagreement, Paul and Lyman decide to continue the hunt for Eddie and Lily, a task made easier when Eddie sends a coded message to Paul arranging a meeting. At their rendezvous, Paul reveals he was involved, but Lyman‚Äôs thugs (the ones who murdered Alistair) capture Lily while Eddie barely escapes. By tracing the license plate on the thug‚Äôs van, Eddie tracks them to the secret C-Systems Research facility where Paul and Lyman are forcing Lily and Chen to replicate the project. Eddie sneaks in during the night and proceeds to \\"fix\\" the system. The next morning, one of the other scientists discovers the working reactor and everyone celebrates. Paul is suspicious, and immediately obtains a download of the working data, and secretly gives it to his assistant, Anita, for safekeeping. He then finds Eddie at a computer in the company boardroom. There, Eddie demands to be let go in exchange for making the reactor work. Paul agrees but Lyman refuses, believing that the process already works, so Eddie sets the reactor to explode while sending proof of his innocence to the FBI and blueprints of the reactor to \\"hopefully a couple thousand\\" international scientists. Lyman responds by shooting Chen dead, then locking in Eddie and Lily to die in the explosion. Paul kills Lyman for overstepping the bounds of the program, leaving the body to be incinerated in the explosion. During his own escape, Paul deactivates the containment system, allowing Eddie and Lily to escape. They are attacked by Lyman's henchmen, but escape moments before a blast wave sweeps through the complex. Eddie and Lily survive the shockwave and are met by FBI agents Ford and Doyle, now convinced of their innocence, who take them to safety. Paul is shown departing the scene via chauffeured limo, and the last scene has him dictating a memo to his secretary Anita, which informs the Director of the CIA that \\"...C-System (is) no longer a viable entity.\\" Cast * Keanu Reeves as Eddie Kasalivich.

In addition, Michael Shannon and Neil Flynn make appearances as a van driver and a Wisconsin State Police Trooper, respectively. Production Large portions of the film were shot on location in and around Chicago, Illinois, including the University of Chicago, Argonne National Laboratory, the Museum of Science and Industry, the Field Museum of Natural History, Michigan Avenue, and the James R. Thompson Center (Atrium Mall). Additional scenes were shot at Yerkes Observatory in Williams Bay, Wisconsin, on Geneva Lake in southern Wisconsin, interiors of the U.S. Capitol were shot at the Wisconsin State Capitol, in Madison, Wisconsin, at Inland Steel (now known as MITTAL Steel) in East Chicago, Indiana, and at a private residence in Barrington Hills, Illinois. Because of the cold Great Lakes winter and filming taking place during record breaking winter weather besides, unique challenges were present for the cast and crew. Morgan Freeman noted that \\"It was difficult for everyone, particularly for me because I'm tropical,\\" he said. \\"I don't do cold weather. This is Chicago...in the winter. I was ill and in bed four days at a crack. It was really rough.\\" Among the extras in the film were then-U.S. Representative (later U.S. Senator) Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) http://glenndeutsch.files.wordpress.com/2007/11/isthmus-keanu-skulks.doc Reception Chain Reaction received negative reviews. It holds an 18% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 33 reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"C+\\" on an A+ to F scale. Roger Ebert gave the film two and a half stars out of four, writing: \\"By movie's end, I'd seen some swell photography and witnessed some thrilling chase scenes, but when it came to understanding the movie, I didn't have a clue.\\" Jeff Millar of the Houston Chronicle wrote: \\"The narrative is very complex, but what's on the screen is little more than generic, non-narrative-specific, guy-being-chased stuff\\". Conversely, Edward Guthmann of the San Francisco Chronicle felt the film was one of the summer's best movies, writing: \\"[Chain Reaction] has better acting, better writing, more spectacular chase sequences and more genuine drama than all of this summer's blockbusters.\\" Chain Reaction and its cast were nominated for one award, with Keanu Reeves being nominated for the Razzie for Worst Actor, which was won by both Tom Arnold and Pauly Shore. Chain Reaction grossed just over USD$60.2 million worldwide. Scientific accuracy In one interpretation of the film's plot, a scientific process supposedly extracts hydrogen from water, then burns the hydrogen to generate power, and leaves only water as a residue, essentially a chemical perpetual motion. The movie never clarifies how the hydrogen is extracted from the water, nor how water is still left over. The character Dr. Shannon makes contradictory statements in the combination of ideas mashed together: one time he says this is accomplished with a laser with millions of degrees, another time he says frequencies of sound and sonoluminescence. In one scene, the movie shows a bubbling container reminiscent of cold fusion electrolytic cells and another references sustained fusion. A character in the film claims that a glass of water could power Chicago for weeks, but no clear explanation is ever given as to whether this is by simply burning hydrogen released by highly efficient means or through nuclear processes. The film's title is also misleading, since \\"chain reaction\\" is related to nuclear fission, not fusion. The film is based around the premise that free energy suppression is real. The main character is told that his discovery is too disruptive: energy would suddenly be cheap, oil would no longer be necessary, oil companies would go bankrupt, and that such sudden economic changes would throw society into chaos. Unfortunately, this is only explained in the last minutes of the film, and it is unlikely that his discovery would have such an effect on the economy. Most of the film revolves around action scenes in the style of 1990s blockbusters, and the topic of conspiracy theories is not adequately explored.

History The PBS Home Video, Inc. company, established in 1977, originally distributed and sold VHS and Betamax tapes simply on their own. In 1994, PBS moved to distribution through Turner Home Entertainment. In 1996, when Turner Home Entertainment's parent company merged with Time Warner, distribution was through Warner Home Video until 2004. From 2004 to 2011 distribution was through Paramount Home Entertainment. PBS Home Video became independent again in 2011, and was renamed PBS Distribution‚ÄîPBSd.

In 2017 independent films produced by PBSd were added for cinema and home video releases. PBS International offers factual content for broadcast, cable, and satellite services internationally. On November 1, 2011, PBS UK was launched on BSkyB. Canadian-born entrepreneur David Lyons and PBS Distribution formed a joint venture to run the channel. Independent films After a backlash from filmmakers over WNET's attempts to move independent documentary series to its secondary station, PBS took feedback from the documentary community and developed an indie film strategy. Through Independent Lens, PBS acquired Stanley Nelson‚Äôs documentary film The Black Panthers: Vanguard of the Revolution. The history of The Black Panthers was especially timely due to the contemporary Black Lives Matter movement's growth. The film was first released in theaters in late 2015, then had a special nationwide public television premiere in late 2016. PBSd expanded its operation to included theatrical distribution of documentary films by hiring Erin Owens as PBS Distribution's Head of Theatrical Distribution; and Emily Rothschild as Director of Theatrical Acquisitions and Marketing. Owens and Rothschild had just worked with PBS on Stanley Nelson's The Black Panthers distribution. The operations expansion of PBSd was announced at the Sundance Film Festival on 19 January 2017. The company plans to get theatrical and non-theatrical rights for up to six feature-length documentaries to release per year. PBSd put British show, Jamestown as a streaming first run on PBS Passport and PBS Masterpiece as of March 23, 2018.

An international co-production between companies from Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States, the film follows a dysfunctional family as secrets come to light at the funeral of the family's patriarch. Plot The film opens with Kate Collins (Zooey Deschanel) walking up to a house. She knocks and a woman answers the door. Kate explains that although she doesn't know her she has a long story to explain. The story begins with the death of her grandfather, Edmund Collins (Rip Torn). The movie then goes on to show how all the family members found out about the death, and how they came together for the funeral. As the Collins family joins their widowed mother/grandmother, Charlotte Collins (Piper Laurie), the family's dysfunctions and idiosyncrasies come to light. Kate's father, Daniel Collins (Hank Azaria), is an \\"obscure foreign film\\" actor whose career peaked at age 8 when he appeared in a peanut butter commercial. Kate's uncle, Skip Collins (Ray Romano), is an overly hormonal father of overly hormonal twin sons (Fred and Ted) who managed to run their mother out of their family. Kate's aunt, Lucy Collins (Kelly Preston), and her girlfriend Judy Arnolds (Famke Janssen) are both criticized throughout the movie because of their relationship. Most of this criticism comes from Kate's other aunt, Alice Collins (Debra Winger). The bossy, intimidating Alice has managed to both raise her three children and drive her husband into submissive silence, because of her persistent talking and badgering. Once they all arrive at the only family home Kate is told by Charlotte that her grandfather wished for her to give the eulogy at the funeral. After a family dinner that goes south when Lucy and Judy announce that they are getting married, tired of the family feuding, Charlotte tries to commit suicide by overdosing on a medication. While the family sits in the waiting room they run into Samantha (Glenne Headly), a nurse at the hospital who is also an old friend of Alice's. After having her stomach pumped and after rejoining the family, Charlotte tries again by jumping out of a moving van on a bridge and although she does not die, she is seriously injured and spends the remainder of the movie in a wheelchair. During the film, Kate continually tries to come up with a eulogy while dealing with a previous romance with Ryan (Jesse Bradford), from whom she ran away after being caught by Ryan's mother who came home while Ryan and Kate were having sex. Kate gets reacquainted with Ryan (after trying to dodge him several times around town) and their relationship reignites. At Edmund's will reading, it is revealed that Edmund has three families that don't know about each other. This explains Edmund's inability to keep names and number of children straight over the years before also dropping the bomb that he was up to his \\"prostate in debt\\". Kate is tasked with finding and telling the other two families of Edmund's demise. Ultimately, per Edmund's will, he is placed in a casket and floated out on a local lake in a boat. Ted and Fred, having previously filled the casket with gasoline, start shooting fiery arrows from a bow at the casket. During this time Kate finally gives her eulogy. One of the arrows eventually hits the casket and a moment later the casket, completely unexpectedly, explodes in a fiery explosion and completely demolishes the boat, body, and casket in a splintery mess. The movie ends with Kate talking to the woman from the beginning of the film. The woman explains she is not actually the person she was looking for but rather her neighbor.

Ronning was born in Fancheng, China, now in Xiangyang, Hubei province, the son of Norwegian American Lutheran missionaries, and graduated from the University of Alberta in 1916 with a B.Sc.. Ronning's family moved from China to the Peace River country of Alberta. Halvor Ronning, Chester's father was instrumental in establishing a Norwegian settlement north-west of Grande Prairie called Valhalla Centre. When Chester Ronning started his studies at the University of Alberta, he travelled by horse from Valhalla Centre to Edmonton along the Edson Trail. This was the only \\"road\\" connecting the Peace country to the provincial capital. In later years the Northern Alberta Railway (now part of Canadian National Railway) was constructed. He returned to China to serve as a missionary from 1922 to 1927 and then returned to Alberta where he took up a position as Principal of the Camrose Lutheran College, a position he held for 15 years. In 1942 he submitted a master's thesis to the University of Alberta's College of Education entitled \\"A study of an Alberta Protestant private school: the Camrose Lutheran College, a residential high school.\\" He was a member of the United Farmers of Alberta and on October 25, 1932, he was elected in a by- election for Camrose. From his entry into the legislature, he was an outspoken adherent of the newly formed Co-operative Commonwealth Federation party.Wetaskiwin Times, March 2, 1933 He was defeated in the 1935 provincial election that wiped out the UFA government. He was leader of the Alberta CCF from 1940 to 1942. The 1940 Alberta election saw no CCFers elected despite winning 11 per cent of the vote. Ronning stepped aside as leader in favour of Elmer Roper, who won a 1942 by-election to become Alberta's first elected CCF MLA. Ronning ran unsuccessfully for the CCF in the 1945 federal election in the riding of Camrose, losing to the Social Credit candidate, James Alexander Marshall. Ronning served in diplomatic posts in China (1945‚Äì1951), Norway (1954‚Äì1957), India (1957‚Äì1964) and the United Nations. He also participated in the international commissions on Korea (1954) and Laos (1961‚Äì62) and undertook special missions to Hanoi (1965‚Äì66) in attempts to mediate the Vietnam War. In 1967 he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada and was promoted to Companion in 1972. He was inducted into the Alberta Order of Excellence in 1983. The legacy of Chester Ronning continues today with the Chester Ronning Centre for the Study of Religion and Public Lifehttps://www.ualberta.ca/augustana/research/centres/crc at the University of Alberta's Augustana Campus in Camrose, Alberta. The Centre exists to facilitate interdisciplinary research, critical teaching, ethical reflection, and public programming on a range of issues in which religious communities, practices and ideas are directly implicated, or on which thoughtful religious perspectives might be brought to bear.

In Scotland (chiefly in the north), the word creel is used to refer to a device used to catch lobsters and other crustaceans. A lobster trap can hold several lobsters. Lobster traps can be constructed of wire and wood, or metal and netting or rigid plastic. An opening permits the lobster to enter a tunnel of netting or other one-way device. Pots are sometimes constructed in two parts, called the \\"chamber\\" or \\"kitchen\\", where there is bait, and exits into the \\"parlour\\", which prevents escape. Lobster pots are usually dropped to the sea floor, one or more at a time, sometimes up to 40 or more, and are marked by a buoy so they can be picked up later. Description The trap can consist of a wood frame surrounded by mesh. The majority of the newer traps found in the Northeast of the US and the Canadian Maritimes consist of a plastic-coated metal frame. A piece of bait, often fish or chum, is placed inside the trap, and the traps are dropped onto the sea floor. A long rope is attached to each trap, at the end of which is a plastic or styrofoam buoy that bears the owner's license number. The entrances to the traps are designed to be one-way entrances only. The traps are checked every other day by the fisherman and rebaited if necessary. One study indicated that lobster traps are very inefficient and allow almost all lobsters to escape.A lobster's life - US News and World Report Automatic rebaiting improves efficiency. History The lobster trap was invented in 1808 by Ebenezer Thorndike of Swampscott, Massachusetts. By 1810, the wooden lath trap is said to have originated in Cape Cod, Massachusetts. New England fishermen in the United States used it for years before American companies introduced it to the Canadian fishery through their Atlantic coast canneries. An 1899 report by the United States Fish Commission on the Lobster Fishery Of Maine, described the local \\"lath pots\\" used by Maine lobster fishers:The Lobster Fishery of Maine by John N. Cobb; Bulletin of the United States Fish Commission, Vol. 19, Pages 241-265, 1899; from Project Gutenberg Safety Lobster fishermen who become entangled in the trap line are at risk of drowning if they are pulled overboard. Best practices have been developed to prevent and reduce entanglement, and to facilitate getting fishermen who have fallen overboard back onto their vessels. Rope-less lobster traps As whales can get entangled in ropes, there is currently research going on into development of rope-less lobster traps. Some designs have already been developed.

It describes Black's life on the road, in prison and his various criminal capers in the American and Canadian west from the late 1880s to early 20th century. The book was a major influence upon William S. Burroughs and other Beat writers. Summary The book tells of Black's experiences in the hobo underworld, freight-hopping around the western United States and Canada, with the majority of incidents taking place from the late 1880s to around 1910. He tells of becoming a thief, burglar, and member of the yegg (safe-cracking) subculture, exploring the topics of crime, criminal justice, vice, addictions, penology, and human folly from various viewpoints, from observer to consumer to supplier, and from victim to perpetrator. Publication You Can't Win originally appeared in serial format in the San Francisco Call-Bulletin under the editorship of Fremont Older. It was so popular that it was reissued in book format by MacMillan and became a best-seller. It has been translated into Russian, Swedish, French, and other languages. After the book's publication, Black spent several years lecturing at women‚Äôs clubs and lived in New York. Black spent his summers in a cabin on Fremont Older's property in California, next to a pool. When MacMillan asked Black to write another book, he was too weak even to swim, according to Mrs. Fremont Older. He didn't write another book. Themes and analysis The main criminal activity of Black's life and of the book is thievery, which leads to discussions of various technical aspects of the thief's \\"trade\\", including casing of prospects (surveillance of targets), safe-cracking, fencing of stolen goods, the disposal of evidence, maintaining aliases and avoiding attention or traceability, the social networks of criminals, the experiences of being arrested, questioned, and tried, and the experience of doing time in jails and prisons. The vices and addictions Black discusses include alcoholism, abuse of opium (hop), gambling, prostitution, and stealing. In his own telling, Black does not seem to have an especial weakness for addictions (for example, he did not become alcoholic himself), but he does describe the addictive allure that gambling and opium held for him in various stages of his life. He expresses an opinion that drug addiction is more psychological than physical; nevertheless, he also admits that breaking himself of a daily opium habit was the toughest battle of his life. Themes that Black explores through anecdotes from his life include: * Doing time in jails and prisons (and sometimes escaping from them) * The criminal justice system, including eluding arrest (and failing to elude it), fixing cases (which can be done from both sides, defense and prosecution).

It is named after nearby Glienicke Palace. The current bridge, the fourth on the site, was completed in 1907, although major reconstruction was necessary after it was damaged during World War II.Structurae [en]: Glienicke Bridge (1907) During the Cold War, as this portion of the Havel River formed the border between West Berlin and East Germany, the bridge was used several times for the exchange of captured spies and thus became known as the Bridge of Spies. Location Glienicke Bridge, looking east The bridge spans the Havel narrows between the Jungfernsee (lake) to the north and the Glienicker Lake to the south. It carries the Bundesstra√üe 1 highway. The Glienicke Palace and Jagdschloss Glienicke are situated (across the highway from each other) near the east (Berlin) end of the bridge. Potsdam tram route 93 from Potsdam main station and Berlin bus route 316 from Wannsee station terminate and interconnect at a tram stop on the Potsdam end of the bridge. The respective Potsdam and Wannsee stations are served by the Berlin S-Bahn and by longer distance trains. History Glienicke Bridge, painting by Franz Xaver Sandmann, 1845 A first wooden bridge across the Havel River at this location was built about 1660, in order to reach the hunting grounds around Stolpe. By the early 1800s, a new, non-wooden bridge was needed to accommodate the massive increase in traffic on the chaussee between the Prussian capital Berlin and the Hohenzollern residence in Potsdam. The architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel designed a brick and wood bascule bridge, which was finished in 1834. By the early 20th century, Schinkel's bridge was no longer able to handle the increased volume in traffic, and operating the moveable sections of the bridge caused delays in steamer traffic on the Havel River. In 1904, the Prussian government held a design competition to replace Schinkel's bridge with a modern, iron bridge. The Johann Caspar Harkort Company of Duisburg submitted the winning design, and the present-day bridge was inaugurated on 16 November 1907. The German film studio UFA shot the film Unter den Br√ºcken (Under the Bridges) at the Glienicke Bridge in 1944 and 1945. At the end of April 1945, an unexploded shell severely damaged the bridge. The reconstruction of the steel bridge was not completed until 1949, after the establishment of West Germany and East Germany. The East German government named it the ‚ÄúBridge of Unity\\" as the border between East Germany and Western Allied-occupied West Berlin ran across the middle of the bridge. Cold War During the early years of the Cold War, the bridge was mainly used by the Allies as a link between their Berlin sections and the military liaison missions in Potsdam. German residents of the two cities more frequently used the S-Bahn suburban rail to travel between Berlin and Potsdam. On 27 May 1952, East German authorities closed the bridge to citizens of West Berlin and West Germany. The bridge was closed to East German citizens after the construction of the Berlin Wall in August 1961. Only allied military personnel and foreign diplomats were allowed to access the bridge at any time. Of all the checkpoints between West Berlin and East Berlin, as well as those between West Berlin and East Germany, the Glienicke Bridge had the uniqueness of being the only such checkpoint of not only having a Soviet presence, but also of being under full Soviet control; all other checkpoints were under East German control, and had no Soviet presence. By the 1970s, the bridge had outlived its projected lifespan and needed significant repairs. The cost of these repairs became a focus of a dispute between the government of West Berlin and the government of East Germany. In 1980 the West Berlin government repaired its half of the bridge, and in 1985 the West Berlin government paid for repairs to the East German half of the bridge in exchange for formally renaming the bridge \\"Glienicke Bridge\\" from \\"Bridge of Unity.\\" On the evening of 10 November 1989, one day after the opening of the Berlin Wall, the Glienicke Bridge was reopened for pedestrians. Border fortifications and barricades were dismantled as a part of German reunification in 1990.

Reporters began calling it the \\"Bridge of Spies.\\"According to James M. Markham of The New York Times, the bridge was one \\"East German Communists call 'the bridge of unity,' but which might better be called 'the bridge of spies.'\\" When this name was later used as the title for various works, it was often taken to be a pun on \\"bridge of sighs\\" a name applied first to the bridge in Venice and then to others. The first prisoner exchange took place on 10 February 1962. The Americans released Rudolf Abel, convicted for spying for the Soviet Union in 1957, in exchange for Gary Powers, the pilot of a U-2 spy plane shot down in 1960. On 12 June 1985, there was a swap of 23 American agents held in Eastern Europe for Polish agent Marian Zacharski and another three Soviet agents arrested in the West. The exchange was the result of three years of negotiation. The final exchange was also the most public. On 11 February 1986 the human rights campaigner (refusenik) and political prisoner Anatoly Shcharansky (now known as Natan Sharansky) and three Western agents were exchanged for Karl Koecher and four other Eastern agents. In popular culture Bridge of Spies (2015) The Glienicke bridge as a venue for prisoner exchange has appeared frequently in fiction, most notably in John Le Carr√©'s novel Smiley's People and the related BBC miniseries, as well as in the 1966 Harry Palmer film, Funeral in Berlin, based on the novel of the same name by Len Deighton. The popular nickname 'Bridge of Spies' was used by the British band T'Pau as the name of the title track on their first album. The usage is metaphorical, referring to a 'walk to freedom' but in the context of a long-dreamt-of relationship. The bridge is referenced in the children's TV series Codename: Kids Next Door, specifically when a bridge in a local mall is used to exchange a spy from the KND in return for a spy from the Teenagers, a parody of real-life prisoner exchanges. There is a brief reference to the bridge in the sixth episode of the first season of Archer, when Mallory Archer and her long-time lover (and head of the KGB) Major Nikolai Jakov mention meeting there \\"one moonlit night\\" when they both worked on covert operations in Berlin, presumably during the Cold War. The 2015 film Bridge of Spies, directed by Steven Spielberg and starring Tom Hanks, features the Powers‚ÄìAbel prisoner exchange on the bridge as a major plot element.

This association would practice a form of communitarian economics called the United Order meant to ensure that all members maintained an acceptable quality of life, class distinctions were minimized, and group unity achieved. While Zion has often been linked with theocracy, the concept of Zion did not theoretically require such a governmental system. In this way, Zion must be distinguished from the ideal political system called theodemocracy, which Latter Day Saints believed would be adopted upon Christ's Second Coming. However, \\"Zion\\" maintains several possible meanings within the Latter Day Saint lexicon. Latter Day Saint usage of \\"Zion\\" Depending on context, \\"Zion\\" can have multiple meanings in the Latter Day Saint movement. Examples include: # Zion retains its Biblical meaning and refers to Jerusalem. (See Zion) # Zion is the name of a physical city founded by the prophet Enoch, also known as the City of Enoch. # Zion refers to the New Jerusalem, a physical, Millennial city expected to be located in Independence, Jackson County, Missouri. # Zion metaphorically refers to any group of people that are unified and \\"pure in heart\\". The City of Enoch is one example of \\"a Zion people\\", and the people described in Fourth Nephi is another. For Zion to be fully realized, the society must be willing to live the law of consecration based on mutual feelings of charity, which is the pure love of Christ. # Zion is the central physical location to which Latter Day Saints have gathered. The term has been applied to: Kirtland, Ohio; Jackson County, Missouri; Nauvoo, Illinois; and the Salt Lake Valley. # Zion is also, according to Joseph Smith, the entirety of the Americas. Smith stated that \\"the whole of America is Zion itself from north to south\\". # Zion is a metaphor for a unified society of Latter Day Saints, metaphorically gathered as members of the Church of Christ. In this sense any stake of the church may be referred to as a \\"stake of Zion.\\"The name \\"stake\\" comes from a passage in Isaiah that compares Zion to a tent that will enlarge as new stakes are planted. See and . Discussion Tower Hill at Adam-ondi-Ahman, Missouri USA In one interpretation, Zion refers to a specific location to which members of the millennial church are to be gathered together to live. Stipulated by what is believed by the Latter-day Saints to be the revelation of Joseph Smith (D&C; 57:1‚Äì5, LDS Church ed.), this is said to be located in Jackson County, Missouri, and its county seat, Independence. The region of Kansas City Metropolitan Area remains important today in the doctrine of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and Community of Christ, as well as many smaller branches and offshoots of the Latter Day Saint movement, who view it as having a crucial role to play in their Christian Millennialist theology. The word \\"Zion\\" appears 53 times in the Book of Mormon, a key part of the Latter Day Saint canon, and 268 times in the LDS Church's version of the Doctrine and Covenants, a part of its canon consisting of what members believe to be modern-day revelation and written down by Smith mostly in the 19th century. Following the disappointments and strife which took place in Missouri during initial attempts to establish a \\"City of the Saints\\" in the region, the concept of Zion evolved to encompass a less geographically- specific idea similar to the orthodox Christian concept of the \\"ekklesia\\" (See Ecclesia (Church)) or community of believers regardless of location. This concept is hinted at in such scriptural passages as the following: \\"Therefore, verily, thus saith the Lord, let Zion rejoice, for this is Zion‚ÄîTHE PURE IN HEART; therefore, let Zion rejoice, while all the wicked shall mourn.\\"D&C; 97:21 (LDS Church ed.). Esoterically considered, \\"Zion\\" as used in this context is a dualistic term connoting a sanctified group of people living according to the commandments and ordinances as revealed to them. Latter Day Saints use the name to signify a group of God's followers, or any location pertaining to where they live. As well as signifying a group and place it is also applied to more than one situation and may be fulfilled at more than one time. Thus, \\"Zion\\" has several related but not necessarily synonymous applications. These applications make reference to the following: 1) The Jerusalem of Judah; 2) The New Jerusalem in America; and 3) The Lord's people and their gathering places around the world. Exoterically (mundanely) considered, a gathering place in the modern Latter Day Saint organizational context refers to wards (basic congregational units), stakes (groups of several wards), and homes or communities where believers are striving to live what is referred to as \\"the fulness of the gospel\\" in righteousness. It is a worldwide movement in which the faithful work towards becoming a pure people, willing to serve God. The community of such faithful church members are referred to metonymically as \\"the pure in heart\\" in their scriptures. The ancient people of Enoch sum it up by saying \\"the Lord called his people Zion, because they were of one heart and one mind, and dwelt in righteousness; and there was no poor among them\\".Moses 7:18 In the Mormon fundamentalism movement, a more literal interpretation of Zion as a specific geographical location is held to more strongly and a more stringent emphasis is placed upon individual and community lifestyle requirements that are considered, to be necessary prerequisites to establishing such a community. These requirements are often referred to as \\"the fulness of the gospel\\" and as \\"ordinances,\\" specific commandments which have long set this movement apart from mainstream Christianity. The two most frequently noted requirements are the United Order (a form of agrarian communalism) and plural marriage, both of which are de- emphasized in the mainstream LDS Church and, in the case of plural marriage, expressly prohibited and denounced. A modern-day proponent of the Mormon fundamentalist movement, Ogden Kraut, summarized the fundamentalist/dissident position on \\"Zion\\" as follows: > The Saints failed to live the higher laws in the center stake of Zion in > Missouri so they were expelled. During the four years at Nauvoo, there was > not even an attempt to live the United Order, for example, so they were > again driven out. They became like the children of Israel in the desert with > only the hope of keeping Zion's laws. But here in the valleys of the Rocky > Mountains we have done worse than in Missouri and Illinois. For a few years > after the pioneers arrived, an attempt was made to live the United Order and > plural marriage, but both leaders and members failed to continue those > important laws. Thus, the Church has gone astray from keeping all the laws > of Zion, and the redemption of Zion is seldom even mentioned. History Joseph Smith wrote of Zion even before the organization of the Latter Day Saint church. In April 1829, he dictated a revelation which urged him and his scribe, Oliver Cowdery, to \\"seek to bring forth and establish the cause of Zion.\\" The attempt to reach that goal became a driving force in early Latter Day Saint history, and remains a powerful influence among Latter Day Saints today. In its broadest sense, Zion is regarded by Latter Day Saints as an association of the \\"pure in heart.\\" Central to Zion's philosophical underpinnings was a sense of community cohesiveness and unity, a concept which seemed to be unraveling in the world of Jacksonian Democracy. Smith taught that the people of Zion would have all things in common (see United Order), and would not allow others in their community to suffer because of the principles of love, unselfishness, and work for the common good which would be imbued in the individuals capable of maintaining such a society. Zion therefore stands in contrast to proverbial Babylon, where wickedness, disunity, and poverty prevail. Soon after the founding of the Latter Day Saint church in April 1830, Smith designated a physical location for the Saints to start to build Zion, which he taught would be the future New Jerusalem. On July 20, 1831, Smith stated that he had received a revelation that designated Missouri as the \\"land which I have appointed and consecrated for the gathering of the saints.\\" The revelation further stated, \\"Behold, the place which is now called Independence is the center place; and the spot for the temple is lying westward...\\" Smith later envisioned the temple as being the starting point for the creation of a New Jerusalem: \\"Verily this is the word of the Lord, that the city New Jerusalem shall be built by the gathering of the saints, beginning at this place, even the place of the temple, which temple shall be reared in this generation.\\" However, mob violence forced the Latter Day Saints from the environs of Missouri by the end of 1833. The local Missourians objected to the Saints' political views (including Mormon support of abolition), their religious beliefs, and their growing population which would soon wrest political power in Jackson County from the \\"old settlers'\\" hands. However, a later revelation through Smith states the belief that the Latter Day Saints were unable to establish Zion in \\"consequence of their transgressions.\\" The revelation says that among the Saints there were \\"jarrings, and contentions, and envyings, and strifes, and lustful and covetous desires among them; therefore by these things they polluted their inheritances.\\" Zion could only be established by those who had spiritually prepared themselves to do so. The Latter Day Saints were finally driven from Missouri in 1838 as a consequence of the Mormon War and Governor Lilburn Boggs' Extermination Order. After this time, Zion maintained its general definition of a society of the righteous, but the concept of Zion as a specific piece of geography (Jackson County, Missouri) began to lose its importance. Zion also became a euphemism for wherever the Saints were gathered, be it Nauvoo, Illinois; Utah; or in many congregations throughout the world.\\"In Missouri and Illinois, Zion had been a city; in Utah, it was a landscape of villages; in the urban diaspora, it was the ward with its extensive programs.\\" Today, Latter Day Saints are still counseled by their leaders to build up the cause of Zion, and prepare themselves to be worthy of such a society. Plat of Zion This one page Plat written in June 1833 by Joseph Smith defines a comprehensive multiple city plan. A comprehensive plat was devised by Smith in 1833, describing the planned city as an organized grid system of blocks and streets, a type of city plan that saw widespread use in Western United States communities. Designed around Latter Day Saint principles of agrarianism order and community, the plan called for 24 temples at the city's center, reflecting the central role played by the church in the community. The temples were to be used for education, administration, cultural events and worship. The plan called for a city of 15,000 to 20,000 people living in a city with agricultural land to be reserved on all sides of the city, enough to supply the city \\"without going too great of a distance\\". The plan did not allow a city to become too large; once a city had reached the 20,000 limit it was envisaged that other cities would be built: \\"When this square is thus laid off and supplied, lay off another in the same way, and so fill up the world.\\" While never utilized, the plat ultimately served as a blueprint for subsequent Mormon settlements in the Mormon Corridor. Zion, the City of Enoch Geographical uses of the name \\"Zion\\" are associated with references in the Book of Moses in the Pearl of Great Price, where Enoch, the son of Jared, founds a city for the righteous descendants of Adam. This city became so righteous and pure that it was translated (taken) from the presence of the earth and brought into the presence of God, leaving behind on earth only Methuselah and his family (including Noah) to repopulate the earth with righteous people. It was described as populated by an organization of people who are common owners of the property and none being richer or poorer. Once this system is also applied to the modern day Zion, it will be referred to as the United Order or the Order of Enoch. The modern-day Zion comes after the Zion of Enoch and the Zion at Jerusalem. Latter Day Saints believe that, at the Second Coming, Zion the City of Enoch will return to the earth from heaven, a belief based on the part of the Scripture that stated this return and that \\"its inhabitants shall join with the New Jerusalem, which shall then be established.\\" It is said that the Zion of America will be reunited with the Zion of Enoch but, first, it must equal to the stature of Enoch's Zion in order to be worthy to join with it.

While there is considerable fluidity among the sources, one guidebook identifies five major districts, corresponding to the four quadrants plus a south central district. These five broad districts, counterclockwise are: Central/downtown, Richmond, Sunset, Upper Market and beyond (south central) and Bernal Heights/Bayview and beyond (southeast). Within each of these five districts are located major neighborhoods, and again there is considerable fluidity seen in the sources. The San Francisco Planning Department officially identifies 36 neighborhoods. Within these 36 official neighborhoods are a large number of minor districts, some of which are historical, and some of which are overlapping. Alamo Square Alamo Square is a subset of the Western Addition neighborhood. Its boundaries are not well-defined, but are generally considered to be Webster Street on the east, Golden Gate Avenue on the north, Divisadero Street on the west, and Oak Street on the south. It is characterized by Victorian architecture that was left largely untouched by the urban renewal projects in other parts of the Western Addition. On a clear day, the Transamerica Pyramid building and the tops of the Golden Gate Bridge and Bay Bridge can be seen from the park's center. San Francisco's City Hall can be seen directly down Fulton Street. A row of Victorian houses facing the park on Steiner Street, known as the painted ladies, are often shown in the foreground of panoramic pictures of the city's downtown area. Anza VistaAshbury Heights Ashbury Heights is a neighborhood on the hill to the south of the Haight- Ashbury neighborhood. It is at the base of Tank Hill and neighboring Cole Valley. Balboa ParkBalboa Terrace Balboa Terrace is a small residential neighborhood in southwestern San Francisco bounded by Junipero Serra Boulevard, Monterey Avenue, Aptos Avenue and Ocean Avenue along the southern edge of the exclusive St. Francis Wood development. Bayview The Bayview stretches along Third Street south of Evans Avenue, west of the Hunters Point neighborhood. The neighborhood library was recently renamed the Linda Brooks-Burton Branch Library after a new and larger building was constructed at the same location on Third Street and Revere. Within a block or two of the library are three urban gardens and public art projects, developed entirely by residents, known as the Quesada Gardens Initiative (the Quesada Garden, Bridgeview Garden, and Latona Garden). The Bayview is known for its friendly and diverse residents, warm weather and inviting vistas, community gardens, independent businesses, artists' community, and rich history as an African American and working-class neighborhood. During the 1950s it was largely an Italian and Maltese neighborhood, centered on St. Paul of the Shipwreck Church and the Maltese American Social Club, both on Oakdale Avenue. The area is served by the T-Third light rail line, and is home to the Bayview Opera House and City College Evans and Southeast Campus. The area is undergoing rapid development as the City tries to meet the demands of population growth and corporate investors have revalued the relatively large amount of buildable land. Hunters Point Shipyard and Candlestick Park areas are primary centers of development in the neighborhood. Despite its diversity, residents have a long history of coming together to create change and protect neighborhood assets. The Bayview Footprints Network maintains the neighborhood's longest-running blog, and the San Francisco Bay View is the local newspaper. Hunters Point Shipyard, a former Superfund site, and a polluting power plant have been focal points for environmental activists. The neighborhood was highly organized during the Civil rights movement, led by social justice advocates such as Julia Commer, Osceola Washington, Ruth Williams, Rosie Williams, Elouise Westbrook, Essie Webb, Espanola Jackson, Shirley Jones, and Alex Pitcher. Sam Jordan, boxing champion and tavern owner, was the first African American to run for Mayor of San Francisco. Belden Place A small neighborhood near the Financial District, being the historical location of the French Quarter in San Francisco. Bernal Heights Bernal Heights is a neighborhood perched on a hill in between the Mission district, Bayview, and the Portola district. The neighborhood is known for its community feeling and progressive vibe. The majority of the neighborhood is white, but there are significant Southern Italian, Latino and African American populations in the area as well. The main shopping area in Bernal Heights is Cortland Avenue, with a variety of storefronts that include a health food store, a community center, a yoga studio, bars, bakeries, and restaurants. Many of the quaint, hilly streets in the neighborhood are so narrow that two cars cannot pass in opposite directions without one car pulling over to the side of the road. Buena Vista The Buena Vista neighborhood surrounds Buena Vista Park, south of the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood. Market Street is to the south, and Corona Heights Park and neighborhood is to the east. Butchertown (Old and New) China Basin and Old Butchertown in 1937 Butchertown (New) (see Islais Creek) is an industrial neighborhood in San Francisco that historically housed the city's slaughterhouses. It is one of the few remaining industrial sectors of San Francisco. Originally, Butchertown extended into the neighborhood now known as Dogpatch. Today's street borders are Cesar Chavez to the north, Interstate 280 to the west, Industrial Street and Oakdale Avenue to the south, and 3rd Street to the east. There are still two meat rendering plants in the neighborhood, and until pollution control measures were taken in 1995 the stench was still quite apparent. Butchertown is also headquarters to San Francisco's only active freight railroad, the San Francisco Bay Railroad,List of California railroads San Francisco Railroads a Class 3 short- line carrier. Old Butchertown was along the shores of Mission Creek on Mission Bay. Mission Bay, was subsequently to become the land-filled Mission Bay neighborhood. CastroCathedral Hill Cathedral Hill is a small area in the Western Addition neighborhood surrounding Saint Mary's Cathedral on Geary Boulevard near Gough Street. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Francisco and Sacred Heart Cathedral Preparatory are located in Cathedral Hill. The Cathedral Hill Hotel, a historic building previously named the Jack Tar Hotel, was closed on October 30, 2009 and was demolished in 2014 to make room for an expansion of the California Pacific Medical Center. Cayuga Terrace Cayuga Terrace, a subset neighborhood of the larger Mission Terrace neighborhood, is bounded by Geneva Avenue, San Jose Avenue, and Alemany Boulevard. It is bordered by the Excelsior, Outer Mission, and Ingleside. The Muni streetcar historic \\"car barn\\" is at one corner of this neighborhood. Cayuga Park is located in this neighborhood. The Cayuga Improvement Association (CIA) covers the area bounded by Interstate 280, Mission Street, Sickles and Onondaga. China Basin Mission Creek, aka China Basin Channel, has a \\"restored\\" water edge along the Mission Bay North frontage beyond the usual riverwalk. The ballpark terminates the view, and houseboats are visible at right. China Basin is a neighborhood built on landfill along the San Francisco Bay. It lies north of Mission Creek and the Mission Bay neighborhood, and includes Oracle Park, home of the San Francisco Giants, numerous restaurants, and the Caltrain railroad station. It borders on the South-of-Market (SOMA) neighborhood to the northwest and the South Beach neighborhood to the north. The term China Basin also refers to the body of water from which the neighborhood takes its name. This inlet where Mission Creek flows into the bay, home to a number of houseboats, was once an active industrial waterfront, though in recent decades the shore has been developed with residential condominiums. The portion of the waterway adjacent to the ballpark is often referred to as McCovey Cove, its unofficial name, which has a small ballfield, open to the public, named after Barry Bonds. The China Basin Heliport (IATA code JCC), used by the SFPD Aero Division until the division was disbanded, was located near the waterfront in the neighborhood. ChinatownCivic CenterClarendon Heights The Clarendon Heights neighborhood is in the central part of San Francisco, to the north of Twin Peaks and east of Mount Sutro. It stretches down to Corbett Avenue or Market Street, and Clarendon Avenue borders the north and west side. Cole Valley Cole Valley is a small neighborhood tucked into a u-shaped valley. Frederick Street is the northern boundary, Stanyan Street on the west, Clayton Street on the east, and the foothill (Belgrave Street) of Twin Peaks on the south. Sometimes referred to as a subsection of the Haight district, Cole Valley's main street is at Cole and Carl streets, where Cole Hardware, Luke's Local and La Boulangerie cafe anchor the neighborhood, with Tank Hill in the southeast corner with its beautiful views toward the ocean, Marin and the eastern half of the city. Corona Heights The Corona Heights neighborhood is a small affluent district in San Francisco that surrounds the Corona Heights hill and park, south of Buena Vista Park and west of the Duboce Triangle. The Randall Museum is located at the end of Museum Way, in Corona Heights Park. It is roughly bordered by Museum Way to the north, Castro to the east, Clayton to the west, and Market to the south. Corona Heights is officially designated as part of District 5 (Central), subdistrict G, also known as neighborhood 5g, by the San Francisco Association of Realtors. The community is in close proximity to The Castro neighborhood. Cow Hollow Cow Hollow is a generally affluent neighborhood located between Russian Hill and the Presidio and bordering the Marina District on one side and Pacific Heights on the other. The land was used for cow grazing (as its name would imply) and a settlement for fishermen (the coastline was much closer to this area than it is now).

Diamond HeightsDogpatchDolores Heights Dolores Heights is a hilly neighborhood named after the eponymous hill within the neighborhood. It borders the Castro to the north, Dolores Park to the east, Noe Valley to the south, and Upper Market to the west. Parts of it are so steep that the Muni Metro J Church line has to be routed through Dolores Park and into the Liberty Hill area before rejoining Church Street in Noe Valley at 22nd street. Many streets within Dolores Heights are dead-end cul de sacs connected by steep staircases with beautiful views. As a result, the area has become a favorite for morning boot camps. It is an affluent and quiet neighborhood with a mixture of Victorians, apartment buildings, and detached houses. In part due to its elevation, Dolores Heights does not have a visible homeless population as much as the Castro and the Mission District. Benefiting from Twin Peaks blocking the strong winds and fog found almost year-round in San Francisco, Dolores Heights remains relatively warm, sunny, and fog-free.

The location of the Mission Dolores was chosen because of proximity to the Yelamu grouping of the Ramaytush band of Ohlone-speaking peoples living in the villages of Chutchui and Sitlintac on Mission Creek which date to approximately A.D. 500. The Ohlone people together with the Coast Miwok served as laborers to build the Mission San Francisco de As√≠s as part of the Spanish colonization.

Particularly noteworthy is its African American community, who migrated there in the 1960s from the Western Addition and Bayview neighborhoods.I am OMI ‚Äì Western Neighborhoods Project ‚Äì San Francisco History. Outsidelands.org (2003-05-26). Retrieved on 2014-05-10. Until the mid-1990s African Americans accounted for over 50% of its residents, many of whom were forced out due to the rising cost of living in San Francisco. Approximately 45,000 people live in the OMI (Oceanview-Merced-Ingleside), and, as of the 2000 United States Census, 45% of the population identifies itself as Asian-American, 25% as African-American, 14% as Latino and 13% as white. The demographic character of the OMI neighborhoods began to change after World War II. Many African-Americans, who had migrated to the Bay Area for work during the war, secured good-paying jobs and settled permanently in new homes in Ingleside, Merced Heights and Oceanview when the war ended. In 1950, African-Americans made up 5% of the population in the Ingleside, Merced Heights and Oceanview census tracts, and by 1970 the percentage had increased to 62%. Fueled by vacant land in Merced Heights and Oceanview, the post-war housing boom, the desire to own their own homes, and the already significant presence of African-Americans in the neighborhoods, the black population exploded from 1950 to 1960. By 1960, African-Americans made up 40% of Merced Heights, 32% of Ingleside and 59% of Oceanview. While some whites moved out, generally to suburban tracts heavily marketed to them, the number of blacks living in OMI increased twelvefold (from 602 in 1950 to 7,273 in 1960), while the citywide black population less than doubled (43,000 in 1950 to 74,000 in 1960). There is anecdotal evidence that African-Americans moved to the OMI after being displaced by the first phase of urban renewal in the Western Addition (the A-1 Project) in the late 1950s. Relocation records, while incomplete, show that the vast majority of displaced residents of the Western Addition found nearby accommodations. Of the 3,700 households of all races (family and single households) living in the project area in 1957, about 2,010 moved without relocation assistance and to unknown whereabouts. Of the remaining 1,602, 67% moved to other parts of the Western Addition and only 2.6%, or 34 households, moved to the West of Twin Peaks area. By 1970, the OMI had matured into a middle-class district of single-family, owner-occupied homes. Seventy-six percent of the land area in the Ingleside, Oceanview, and Merced Heights neighborhoods was residential (100% was residential in Ingleside Terraces), compared with 39% citywide. The housing stock was overwhelming single family (95% vs. 68% citywide) and owner- occupied (72% vs. 31% citywide), while the population was mostly African American (63% compared with 13% citywide). In recent years, the OMI has witnessed an influx of Asian- American and other ethnic groups, making it one of San Francisco's most diverse neighborhoods. The OMI is more Hispanic, Black, and Asian than San Francisco as a whole.

Significant characters *Yossarian Captain John Yossarian is a fictional character in Joseph Heller's novel Catch-22 and its sequel Closing Time, and the protagonist of both books. In Catch-22, Yossarian is a 28-year- old Captain and the bombardier of a North American B-25 Mitchell in the 256th Bombardment Squadron of the Army Air Corps, stationed on the small island of Pianosa off the Italian mainland during World War II. Yossarian's exploits are based on the experiences of the author; Heller was also a bombardier in the Air Corps, stationed on an island off the coast of Italy during World War II. Yossarian is described as a tall, broad, Assyrian man, who frequently causes vast amounts of panic by starting rumors or orchestrating events that either keep him out of direct battle or somehow usurp authority. Examples of these exploits include: poisoning the mess hall with bath soap, accepting an award for his achievements without clothing, and moving the bombing line so his squadron won't have to fly. *Chaplain Tappman Tappman (also called R. O. Shipman in some editions) is a na√Øve Anabaptist minister from Kenosha, Wisconsin. As he is extremely timid and terrified of authority, the chaplain is tormented throughout the novel by his rude, manipulative, atheist assistant, Corporal Whitcomb. Easily intimidated by the cruelty of others, the Chaplain is a kind, gentle, and sensitive man who worries constantly about his wife and children at home. He is described as a man of 32 years of age with tan hair, brown eyes, and a narrow, pale face. His sister is a Master Sergeant in the Marines. *Colonel Cathcart A full colonel, Chuck Cathcart is a group commander at the U.S. Army Air Corps base in Pianosa and is obsessed with becoming a general. As such, he does whatever it takes to please his superiors, in particular, by repeatedly raising the number of missions the men have to fly to complete a tour of duty beyond that normally required by other outfits. Ironically, this provokes no reaction from the generals, who are apathetic to the war efforts, but becomes the bane of Yossarian's and Hungry Joe's lives. He is a 36 year old man with short graying curly hair, a tall yet beefy build, extremely pale skin, and a huge host of self-confidence issues. He is described as mildly conceited, and yet is found to be constantly comparing himself to others, often finding himself displeased with the conclusions he reaches. Cathcart is also obsessed with forging and maintaining a public image of extreme masculinity, most likely due to his apparent insecurity. *Doctor Daneeka Dr. Dan Daneeka is the squadron flight surgeon and a friend of the novel's protagonist, Yossarian. Doc Daneeka's main motivation is for his own welfare, whether that be making money or protecting his own life. He generally forgets his moral duty as a physician except in the most extreme of circumstances. Doc Daneeka feels the military is responsible for him being drafted into the war effort and putting him in harm's way, because they were distrustful of him when he lied on his drafting papers about his health. He is constantly scared of upsetting his superiors who may see fit to then ship him off to the far more dangerous South Pacific. Already he sees it as military cruelty to have been assigned to the Air Corps even though he is scared of flying. His catchphrase could be seen as \\"You think you have it bad? Well what about me?\\" since his self-centeredness ensures his thoughts are constantly centered on himself. *Milo Minderbinder First Lieutenant Milo Minderbinder is the mess officer at the U.S. Army Air Corps base and he becomes obsessed with expanding mess operations and trading goods for the profits of the syndicate (in which he and everyone else \\"has a share\\"). Milo is a satire of the modern businessman, and beyond that is the living representation of capitalism, as he has no allegiance to any country, person or principle unless it pays him and profit is generated. Milo even begins contracting missions for the Germans, fighting on both sides in the battle at Orvieto and bombing his own squadron. He is capable of extreme self- justification by means of his own personal virtues or morals; in a way, his personality is almost sociopathic. *Lieutenant Nately Nately's family originally enlisted him to serve in the Air Corps, believing the war would be over by the time he finished his training and that he would mingle with \\"gentlemen.\\" Therefore, Nately could gain the pride of enlisting without actually having to fight. Instead, he mingled with Yossarian and Dunbar, and was sent overseas. He lives in a tent with McWatt next to Havermeyer's tent. His most notable contribution in the book is his involvement with a whore, \\"Nately's Whore,\\" who is for the most part uninterested in him until he saves her from a sleepless night with generals, thus giving her an opportunity to get some sleep. He is often filled with American optimism, shown by his desire to marry his whore and send her kid sister to a respected college in the United States. He is killed on a mission when Dobbs flies his plane into Nately's. Nately's Whore blames Yossarian and spends the rest of the book trying to murder him. *Orr A bomber pilot in the squadron who is continually being shot down and having to crash land in the sea. Described as \\"a warm- hearted, simple-minded gnome,\\" Orr is the only person in the group considered to be crazier than his good friend Yossarian, with whom he shares a tent. Orr appears to take great joy in thoroughly confounding those around him by being completely nonsensical, however this is later revealed to most likely be a part of his escape plan. He is declared 'missing in action' halfway through the novel after crashing his plane in the Mediterranean, but by the end it's revealed that he had rowed to the neutral zone in Sweden to escape the army. At this point, Yossarian realizes that Orr's constant crashes had been part of his plan and his survival inspires Yossarian to finally flee the army. *Snowden Snowden is a radio-gunner, a member of Yossarian's crew; when their aircraft is hit by anti-aircraft fire and Snowden is wounded, Yossarian attempts to treat his visible wounds, but misses a terrible, fatal, wound hidden by his clothing. This incident is generally referred to in the novel as \\"the death over Avignon\\". Snowden's death acts as the catalyst for the change in Yossarian's mentality. *Captain Aardvaark Captain Aardvaark (called Aarfy) is the navigator in Yossarian's B-25 bomber (but only when Yossarian is flying in the lead ship ‚Äì hence Aarfy's sporadic appearances in the air in the novel). He is oblivious to incoming flak, repeatedly gets lost on missions, and always smokes a pipe. Yossarian comments that Aarfy is just not intelligent enough to be afraid of the war. He befriends Nately in the hope of working for Nately's wealthy father after the war. Aarfy sees himself as moral and protects well-connected women from the sexual advances of other officers, but he ends up raping and murdering the innocent maid Michaela. When asked by Yossarian why he didn't simply hire a prostitute, he repeats his common admonition that \\"Old Aarfy has never paid for it.\\" He shows no remorse for these crimes until he begins to worry that he might be brought to justice for them. * Lieutenant (later Colonel and eventually General) Scheisskopf Scheisskopf is the training unit commander for Yossarian and Clevinger, and takes a particular dislike to Clevinger. Even though Clevinger is just as serious about parades as Scheisskopf, and his ideas help the squadron win multiple parades, Scheisskopf still considers him a \\"wise guy\\", and someone that needs to be \\"brought down a peg or two.\\" He is also described as being at constant odds with his wife's masochistic libido as his severe love for parades leaves him too busy to pay any attention to her. Scheisskopf is an ambitious and humorless man who is absolutely in love with war and is only happy in life when the opposing side is losing. Other characters *Appleby ‚Äì A fair haired, young pilot from Iowa. He is described as being \\"as good at shooting craps as he was at playing ping-pong, and he was as good at playing ping-pong as he was at everything else.\\" Appleby's character appears to represent those who thrive to a certain extent within a bureaucratic system and feel threatened by others who do not play along as much as they would like them to. He follows regulations without question and does everything he is supposed to do, managing to succeed with minimal effort at whatever he does. He believes in God, the Motherhood, and the American Way of Life. *Captain Black ‚Äì Because of the lack of risk involved in not flying missions, Captain Black wanted to take over Major Duluth's position as squadron commander when the Major was killed over Perugia. He was thwarted in this by the appointment of Major Major to the position. Captain Black also constantly mocks his fellow countrymen at the Pianosa airbase when they are faced by dangerous missions, by constantly telling everyone to \\"eat your liver.\\" Since he is the camp's intelligence officer, he is not on combat duty and can therefore maintain his gleeful attitude to the men risking their lives in the air. Black is a paranoid anti-Communist and pressures all the men to take loyalty oaths, but out of personal spite prevents Major Major from taking one. He is also notable for deliberately seeking out Nately's Whore on his visits to Rome, and gleefully describing these meetings to Nately. *Colonel Cargill ‚Äì Before the war, Cargill was a successful, though completely untalented, marketing executive who was well known for being completely terrible at his job. In the Air Force, Colonel Cargill provided his legendary lack of skills as General Peckem's troubleshooter. *Clevinger ‚Äì A highly principled, highly educated man who acts as Yossarian's foil within the story. He is a Harvard graduate whom Yossarian characterises as having \\"lots of intelligence but zero brains\\". Clevinger is very unmoving in his own opinions and is further described as such: excessively philosophical, politically a humanitarian, lacking in social tact, and a person of all facts but no passion. His optimistic view of the world causes Yossarian to consider him to be a \\"dope,\\" and he and Yossarian each believe the other to be crazy. Yossarian also comments that Clevinger crusades against bigotry by balking in its face, proving Clevinger to be an extremely submissive character. During basic training he is brought to trial and found guilty on phony charges by Lt. Scheisskopf. His plane mysteriously vanishes in a cloud and he's never seen again. *Lieutenant Coombs ‚Äì The previous assistant intelligence officer. He also dies in the same plane crash that kills Kraft. *Nurse Cramer ‚Äì Nurse Duckett's best friend. She is a shapely, pretty, young girl who refuses to have any relations with the men at all, so Yossarian dislikes her. After Nurse Duckett starts a relationship with Yossarian, puritanical Nurse Cramer stops speaking to her. *Major Danby ‚Äì The fighting group operations officer. An intellectual college professor with a passive and somewhat melancholic yet serene outlook on life who sees himself as a poor match for the armed services due to his lack of aggression. He briefs the airmen on upcoming missions and often acts as a mediator for disputes between enlisted men and as a confidant to most of the officers. *Mrs. Daneeka Doc Daneeka's wife. When the doctor is mistakenly declared dead after listing himself fraudulently on a flight manifest for a doomed flight, she finds herself suddenly rich and widowed, and moves away, leaving no forwarding address. *Major ‚Äî‚Äî de Coverley ‚Äì Major ‚Äî‚Äî de Coverley has a terrifying visage in the Biblical tradition, so much so that men will do his desires without his even saying a word, and no one dares ask his first name. The exact nature of the Major's duties within the bomber group is uncertain. He is Major Major's executive officer, but at the squadron base in Pianosa his only official duties are pitching horseshoes, renting apartments for the soldiers on rest leave, and kidnapping Italian laborers to help around the base. He also rapidly put an end to Captain Black‚Äôs \\"Glorious Loyalty Oath Crusade\\" by demanding that he be ‚Äúgiven eat‚Äù then demanding that they ‚Äúgive everybody eat‚Äù. His frequent appearance during the fall of major cities makes him an object of interest to intelligence agencies on both sides, neither of which can identify him. *General Dreedle ‚Äì The commander of the U.S. Army Air Corps base in Pianosa, Dreedle is an exceedingly blunt, ill-tempered, simple, no-nonsense man. He is an archetypal no-nonsense military man who does not care what the men under his command do as long as they fight and die unquestioningly when given orders. Despite this, he is generally apathetic to the war effort (having lost all drive after he was made General and he found he had \\"nothing more to aim for\\") and now mostly busies himself with harassing his son-in-law, Colonel Moodus. He despises Moodus simply because he hates weddings and does not wish to attend another one. His arch-rival is General Peckem, head of Special Services in Rome; the two men frequently have their disputes mediated without their knowledge by the desk clerk, ex-P.F.C. Wintergreen. *Dobbs ‚Äì Originally a healthy young man, the effects of excessive combat missions have shot Dobbs' nerves, and when the narration of the book begins he is emotionally unstable and physically spent. He is described as being one of the worst pilots in the corps and his mid-air panic leads him to snatch the controls of the plane away from Huple, when Snowden is killed. He plots to kill Colonel Cathcart but will only do it if Yossarian tells him it's a good idea, which Yossarian never does. He dies in the mid-air crash that kills Nately. *' ‚Äì At the start of the novel Nurse Duckett does not like Yossarian but later on she has a relationship with Yossarian which jeopardizes her friendship with Nurse Cramer. She breaks off her affair with Yossarian when she decides to marry a doctor, and realizes she should not jeopardize her chances by carrying on openly with Yossarian. *Dunbar ‚Äì An airman stationed at the same base as Yossarian, on the island of Pianosa. He and Yossarian seem to have similar personalities, and so they make fast friends. Like Yossarian, Dunbar's chief goal is to prolong his life to whatever extent possible, often by cultivating boredom. He frequently accompanies Yossarian in the hospital, faking injuries to stay out of combat like his friend does. He is later 'disappeared' by the army when he becomes rebellious and unstable. *Major Duluth ‚Äì The previous squadron commander. He was killed over Perugia. *Dori Duz ‚Äì Scheisskopf's wife's close friend. A lively ‚Äútart‚Äù who has relations with all the men in the company once as she refuses to sleep with anyone she finds to be mediocre again. Thus, she sleeps with Yossarian once and he spends a small part of the novel pining after her since he knows she doesn't want him. *Captain Flume ‚Äì Captain Flume is the squadron's public relations officer, until he moves out of the trailer he shares with Chief White Halfoat after Halfoat jokingly threatens to slit Flume's throat open from ear to ear. He spends most of the book living like a hermit in the woods, which gradually drives him insane. *Giuseppe (the soldier who sees everything twice) ‚Äì A delirious soldier who creates a panic in the hospital by shouting, \\"I see everything twice!\\" Yossarian imitates him (by seeing two fingers regardless of whether a doctor holds up one, two, or none) and later impersonates him when he dies. The soldier's family does not notice that Yossarian is not their son. *Gus and Wes ‚Äì Doc Daneeka's two orderlies, whose main activity is to paint airmen's gums and toes purple with gentian violet solution. They are extremely efficient and have a list of steps on determining if someone is sick so that there will be certainty when diagnosing. Daneeka hates them because they refuse to declare him ill so that he can go home. *Havermeyer ‚Äì Havermeyer lives in the tent next to Yossarian's, and according to Colonel Cathcart he is \\"the best damn bombardier we've got.\\" This was because he insists on flying his plane dead straight to, over, and past the target despite any anti- aircraft fire he receives. Yossarian despises him because of his insistence in putting his (Yossarian's) life at stake. He is also slightly unstable and enjoys shooting mice at night with the gun he stole from the dead man in Yossarian's tent. He and Appleby are the most hated enlisted men in the company. However, despite their love of duty, even Havermeyer begins to hate the constant raising of the number of missions and even considers going on strike with Yossarian by the end of the novel. He also shows a dislike of Appleby himself. *Huple ‚Äì A fifteen-year-old pilot who lied about his age to get into the Army. He shares a tent with Hungry Joe on the wrong side of the railway tracks and is shy, nervous but is a thoroughly idealistic patriot, which is why Yossarian feels sorry for him; he feels he'll probably die too young. He has a cat that constantly sleeps on Hungry Joe's face. He is the pilot flying when Snowden dies over Avignon. *Hungry Joe ‚Äì A perverted soldier who is noted for constantly trying to photograph women nude, claiming to be a photographer for Life magazine (which, ironically, he was before the war, although none of his pictures developed correctly). He is the only pilot who consistently finished the required number of missions (but was forced to continue flying as his paperwork was always delayed until the flight limit was elevated) and has screaming nightmares until he's ordered back onto combat status. He enjoys randomly choosing diseases to worry about at will. He dies when he's suffocated by Huple's cat. *Sergeant Knight ‚Äì The turret gunner on Yossarian's plane; he accidentally begins a panic prior to the Bologna operation when he brings extra flak jackets, causing everyone to think the target is deadly. *Corporal Kolodny ‚Äì Captain Black's despised assistant. He erroneously reports that Bologna has been captured by the Allies after Yossarian surreptitiously redraws the lines on the battle map. Kolodny is forced to sign hundreds of loyalty oaths in Black‚Äôs name each day. *Lieutenant Colonel Korn ‚Äì Colonel Cathcart's intellectual assistant and right-hand man. Korn appears along Cathcart throughout the novel and it becomes clear to the reader that Korn does most of the thinking and most of the work for Cathcart, who only takes the credit. Korn is portrayed as much more relaxed and less ostentatious than his superior, but much more sadistic and cynical. Much like Cathcart he has ambitions for higher military ranks but chooses to be below Cathcart and remain outside the limelight so that, if something goes wrong, Cathcart will take the fall instead of him. *Kraft ‚Äì A man killed at the bombing of a bridge at Ferrara. Yossarian blames himself, as he ordered the planes back after they missed the first time. He was a skinny, harmless kid from Pennsylvania that only wanted to be liked. It is later revealed that his death was actually Aarfy‚Äôs fault because he didn‚Äôt accurately navigate them. *Luciana ‚Äì A woman whom Yossarian briefly dates in Rome and whom he spends a great deal of the second half of the book looking for, without success. She refuses to marry Yossarian because she believes he‚Äôs crazy for wanting to marry her at all. *Major Major Major Major ‚Äì The ineffectual squadron commander of the base in Pianosa, who was named Major Major Major by his father as a joke - passing up the lesser possibilities of \\"Drum Major, Minor Major, Sergeant Major, or C Sharp Major\\" - and was later made a Major by an IBM machine with a sense of humor. He is disliked by most of the enlisted men in Pianosa because he was promoted so suddenly and he chooses to remain isolated from the other people at the base, letting Sergeant Towser handle the operations of the base. He doesn't allow people to see him in his office while he is in his office, they can only see him when he isn't there. He utilizes Yossarian's pen name, Washington Irving, to shirk out of official document duties which eventually leads to the terrible fate the chaplain is met with. Major Major is also extremely obedient because he just wants to be well-liked, however he is instead constantly being promoted because nobody actually likes him at all. *McWatt ‚Äì The pilot of Yossarian's plane, one of his closest friends and Nately's roommate as well. A young man who appears to be very calm and serene and whom Yossarian considers to be crazy because he remains sane during the war. He enjoys flying his plane low to scare Yossarian, which eventually leads Yossarian choking him and threatening to murder him during one of their combat training sessions. After this, McWatt seems to realize that Yossarian might actually be going insane. However, he conceals his increasing panic and madness, which eventually erupts after he accidentally kills Kid Sampson by slicing him in half with a plane propeller, driving him to commit suicide by stalling and crashing his plane into a mountain. *Major Metcalf ‚Äì One of the judges presiding over the Action Board during Clevinger's trial. He is extremely cowardly and strongly resembles Clevinger in many ways, inevitably leading to him being shipped away as well at the end of the trial. *Michaela ‚Äì The poor, plain, simple-minded, hard-working young maid who works in the apartments where Yossarian and his unit stay while in Rome. She is a sweet and innocent girl who doesn't speak English and whom the enlisted men mostly leave alone, except when they mock her in English so she can't understand them. She is raped and murdered by Aarfy, who simply dismisses the murder as inconsequential because he's \\"good old Aarfy, who never pays for it\\". *Colonel Moodus ‚Äì General Dreedle's son-in-law, whom the general hates and constantly tries to harass and have demoted. Moodus thinks Dreedle is a know-it-all that cannot take criticism. *Lieutenant Mudd ‚Äì More frequently referred to as \\"the dead man in Yossarian's tent,\\" Mudd was killed in action before officially joining the squadron. Due to the bureaucratic uncertainty over the status of Mudd, no one will accept responsibility for Mudd and his belongings, and Sergeant Towser refuses to accept the man existed at all. *Colonel Nevers ‚Äì The colonel who held Cathcart's position before he was killed on Yossarian's 23rd mission. *General P P Peckem ‚Äì A pompous, pretentious and highly delusional general who desperately wants to take over General Dreedle's post as the superior commanding officer of Pianosa. Because of this ambition, he has a vicious rivalry with Dreedle and constantly tries to undermine him and have him demoted. His attempts are mostly thwarted without his knowledge by desk clerk ex-P.F.C. Wintergreen, who enjoys making Peckem look foolish. *Piltchard and Wren ‚Äì Two captains in charge of squadron operations that are always mentioned in tandem and are in charge of organizing combat crews for missions. They are sympathetic towards Yossarian, despite his desire to avoid missions. Both are described as mild, soft-spoken men who are average in pretty much every aspect and yet, strangely enough, love flying and so, they assign themselves to every single mission. *Corporal Popinjay ‚Äì The clerk present at Clevinger's trial; he is imprisoned for being too specific in his shorthand. *Kid Sampson ‚Äì An underaged soldier killed by the propeller of McWatt's airplane. The event drives McWatt to suicide which in turn causes Doc Daneeka's bureaucratic \\"death\\". *Major Sanderson ‚Äì A neurotic psychiatrist who is convinced that Yossarian is mentally unstable because he acts rationally. *Mrs. Scheisskopf ‚Äì Scheisskopf is always too busy planning parades to fulfill his wife's masochistic sexual fantasies. Instead, she sleeps with Scheisskopf's cadets, so they can all get revenge on her husband and she can get back at him for the lack of attention. She purports to be atheist but is really a devout believer when it comes down to it *Sammy Singer ‚Äì The tailgunner on Yossarian's bomber when Snowden dies. While he is just a minor character in Catch-22, he becomes one of the main characters in the sequel, Closing Time. *Corporal Snark ‚Äì The mess sergeant before Milo Minderbinder. He was demoted for purposely poisoning sweet potatoes with soap chips, giving the squadron diarrhea, which he did at Yossarian's request. Snark is now referred to as Milo's \\"first chef\\". *Dr. Stubbs The doctor in Dunbar's squadron who grounds any pilot who requests it. He falls into an existential crisis after Colonel Korn shuts down his medical tents. *Sergeant Towser ‚Äì Major Major's assistant; he prevents anyone from seeing the Major while he is in his office, and only allows them in when the Major is gone. Due to Major Major's unwillingness to see anyone, Towser is the de facto head of the 256th squadron. He has a lean, angular build, extremely blonde hair, huge teeth, and sunken cheeks. Towser also holds no desire for a promotion or any interest in the war. *Corporal Whitcomb ‚Äì An atheist who constantly antagonizes and looks to usurp Chaplain Tappman, his direct superior. He is openly rude and contemptuous, absolutely detests his seclusion in the woods, and is very easily offended. *Chief White Halfoat ‚Äì An American Indian whose family was forced to move from wherever they settled because oil was always discovered. He is transferred to Pianosa after Wintergreen strikes an oil pipe and nearly drowns. In the army, he works as Captain Black's assistant. He jokingly threatens to slit Captain Flume's throat while he sleeps, which accidentally drives Flume to paranoid madness. After this, he becomes Doc Daneeka's tent mate and terrorizes him as well. During the Siege of Bologna, he decides that he will eventually die of pneumonia, which he ultimately does. *Ex-P.F.C. Wintergreen ‚Äì An ex-P.F.C. because of his constant urge to go AWOL, Wintergreen has been demoted so many times that he entertains hopes of becoming an ex-general. Due to his position in charge of mail distribution, he wields a great amount of power in the novel. By forging documents and destroying mail, he becomes more powerful than the generals. His main concern throughout the novel is humiliating General Peckem because he was the first person to have demoted him. He also frequently butts heads with Milo as they are both in the black market business. Unnamed characters *The C.I.D. Investigators The first CID man is sent to investigate the excessive censoring being done by a soldier named \\"Washington Irving\\", the alias Yossarian made up to supplement his own boredom with mild amusement. He enters the hospital, posing as a patient initially, then ironically comes down with pneumonia and is required to actually stay in the hospital. The second CID man is sent to investigate the continued use of \\"Washington Irving\\"'s name, however this time it was at the hands of Major Major. He goes undercover as a pilot but blows his cover by telling everyone who he is. The two investigators end up pursuing each other instead of making any actual headway in their own cases. *Dreedle's girl Allegedly a nurse, she follows General Dreedle wherever he goes. She is a very attractive woman and Dreedle keeps her around to torment his son-in-law, Colonel Moodus, hoping to catch him in an adulterous situation for which he can punish him. *The maid with the lime-colored panties A woman with whom Yossarian paradoxically falls in love because she is the only woman that Yossarian can't possibly fall in love with. Her charm lies in how willing she is to have relations with anyone who asks her. *Nately's Whore A whore in Rome with whom Nately is deeply in love. She despises Yossarian and is wildly apathetic towards Nately until he allows her to get some sleep. She has a young sister whom Nately is determined to send to college. After Nately dies, Nately's whore blames Yossarian for his fate and spends the rest of the novel attempting to murder him. *Nately's Whore's Kid Sister The young sister of the whore Nately fancies in Rome. *The new recruits (Yo-yo's roomies) A group of new young officer-pilots whom Yossarian hates. They are friends from back home, and are excited to still be able to take part in the war. They practically run Yossarian out of his tent, and throw out all of Mudd's equipment. *The old man in Rome A 107-year-old man who lives in the brothel frequented by Nately. He sides with whomever is in power and mocks Nately's idealism. He reminds Nately uncomfortably of his own father for the reason that the old man is absolutely nothing like his father. *The Soldier in White An unnamed soldier wrapped completely in bandages. He is connected to two bottles of unidentified and similar looking liquid, one of which pumps the liquid through an IV into the soldier, while the other drains the liquid from the soldier through a zinc catheter. When the bottles are respectively empty and full, they are switched around. Dunbar claims there is actually no one under the bandages. It is understood later that the men avoid this soldier because they dislike the fact that he's worse off than they are. He eventually dies without anyone realizing. *The Texan A patriotic soldier who keeps the men from staying in the medical ward to hide out from the war by being overly friendly. He is in the ward when Dunbar and Yossarian enter, attempting to escape their duties in their respective squadrons, but they are eventually chased out by his pleasant demeanor.

The city of Orihuela had a population of 33,943 inhabitants at the beginning of 2013. The municipality has a total area of 367.19 km¬≤, and stretches all the way down to the Mediterranean coast, west of Torrevieja, and had a total population of 92,000 inhabitants at the beginning of 2013. This includes not only the city of Orihuela, but also the coastal tourist centre (urbanizaci√≥n tur√≠stica) of Dehesa de Campoamor with 33,277 inhabitants (2013) and a few other villages. The river Segura flows through Orihuela. The city was settled by Romans who called it Orcelis and subsequently Aurariola. History Orihuela is the capital of the region of the \\"Vega Baja del Segura\\" (natural region of the Segura River); it has been the capital of a province and even of a kingdom. The city was named the first city of the province of Alicante, 11 September 1437. In 576 it was the capital of the Visigothic province of Aurariola, to which it gave its name. In 713 (5 April) the military man and Count Teodomiro, proclaimed himself King of Tudmir. At the end of the 9th century, the city was attacked by the Vikings in the first Viking wave across the Mediterranean (858-861). In 825 the Kingdom of Tudmir, became a dependent kingdom under Umayyad control, and the capital was moved to Murcia. In 910 the Kingdom of Tudmir passed to the Emirate of Cordova. In 1053 the principality of Murcia, part of the Kingdom of Denia, is created. In 1086 the principality of Murcia becomes independent from Denia. In 1212 the area passed to the Kingdom of Murcia. In 1304 Orihuela was considered to be on the border between the kingdoms of Castile and Arag√≥n. In 1366 it passed to the kingdom of Valencia. In 1437, it was declared a city and in 1507, Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor made Orihuela capital of the province of Orihuela. In 1737 Alicante, Elche, Monforte, Jijona, Villajoyosa, Agost, Busot, San Juan or Muchamiel became independent from the province of Orihuela, forming the one of Alicante. 1799 Orihuela was part of the province of Alicante. In 1810, Napoleon made Orihuela part of the Department of Segura with the capital at Murcia. In 1822, Orihuela passed to the province of Murcia. 1833 it became part of the province of Alicante. In 1920 nationalistic movements spoke of Orihuela as belonging to the \\"country of Murcia.\\" Between 1988 and 2006 various research studies from the Universities of Andalusia, Castile and Murcia demonstrated that Orihuela was more culturally part of Murcia than Valencia in terms of phonetics, lexicon, architecture, agriculture, folklore, musical celebrations, instruments, language, burial customs, gastronomy and varieties. In recent years, there has been growing support for the \\"independence\\" of Orihuela Costa (Dehesa de Campoamor) from Orihuela itself. This is due to the perception among the largely foreign born population of Orihuela Costa that they are being unfairly treated by the local government. For example, the Orihuela Costa's share in the 2010-2014 municipal budget was 6x less than that for the city itself, or 4,2% of the 295 million ‚Ç¨ budget, even though the Costa creates around 30% of municipal tax income.

He sits as an independent member of the House of Lords. A Eurosceptic, he has been a staunch supporter of pro-Brexit campaign Leave Means Leave. Early life and career Born in Devizes, the son of John M. and Rosabel C. Pearson ( Moysey), Pearson was educated at Eton College. Prior to entering politics, he had a career in international insurance. During the Cold War, he was a leading critic of totalitarianism in the Soviet Union and supported Soviet dissidents. He worked closely with Russian author and dissident Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn to ensure that funds reached other artists and dissidents working inside the Soviet Union, and hosted Solzhenitsyn on his Rannoch estate. In 1984, Pearson established the Rannoch Charitable Trust, which funded many refugees escaping from the Soviet Union. In recognition of his efforts, Pearson was awarded in 2007 the Senator Henry \\"Scoop\\" Jackson Award For Values and Vision in Politics.Lord Macolm Pearson wins Henry \\"Scoop\\" Jackson Award 2007 Jerusalem Summit. Retrieved 24 March 2010. Pearson was created a life peer on 18 June 1990 as Baron Pearson of Rannoch, of Bridge of Gaur in the District of Perth and Kinross, sitting as a Conservative. He entered the House for services to the insurance industry, particularly his anti-corruption stance on the Savonita affair.\\"Pay up and play the game\\", Investors Chronicle, 15 December 1978 and \\"Unsavoury Savonita\\", The Economist, 16 December 1978 In February 1997, Hugo Gurdon published an interview in The Daily Telegraph with Pearson, discussing his metaphysical and political beliefs and motivations.\\"God's Euro-sceptic\\" The Daily Telegraph, 1 February 1997Daily Telegraph letters \\"Don't bomb Kohl\\". 3 February 1997 Pearson became Treasurer of the degree-awarding body to the polytechnic sector, the Council for National Academic Awards, serving from 1983 to 1992. A daughter from his second marriage, born in 1980, introduced him to the world of learning disabilities for which he has done extensive work and fundraising, in particular for the Camphill movement. Pearson is a Eurosceptic of long standing. In May 2004, he called for voters to back the UK Independence Party (UKIP). Along with three other Conservative peers, he was then expelled by the Conservative Party on 30 May. He subsequently said that he would probably sit as an \\"independent Conservative\\". He threatened to quit the Conservatives to join UKIP, which he did on 7 January 2007,The Times along with Lord Willoughby de Broke. Pearson criticised the Conservative Party's leadership for being \\"silly\\" and argued that they should try to get UKIP members back into the fold by adopting more eurosceptic policies themselves. He has tabled a number of unsuccessful bills in the House of Lords demanding Britain's withdrawal from the European Union. In November 2006, he tabled the European Union (Implications of Withdrawal) Bill, which called for an official cost benefit analysis of UK's EU membership. He joined UKIP on 7 January 2007, citing David Cameron's refusal to tell the British people about the disadvantages they suffer because of Britain's membership of the EU. In February 2009, Lord Pearson and cross-bencher Baroness Cox invited the Dutch Freedom Party leader, Geert Wilders, to show the anti-Islam film Fitna before the House of Lords. Jacqui Smith,The Guardian, \\"Far-right Dutch MP refused entry to UK\\", 12 February 2009 then Home Secretary, subsequently excluded Wilders from entry to the UK. In response, Pearson and Cox accused the then Government of \\"appeasing\\" militant Islam.The Daily Telegraph, \\"Dutch MP Geert Wilders deported after flying to Britain to show anti-Islamic film\\", 12 February 2009 Wilders appealed successfully against his exclusion, and the film was eventually shown in the Lords in 2010.

He won the election and was announced the new leader of UKIP on 27 November 2009. He led the party through the 2010 general election, memorably appearing on BBC News' Campaign Show with Jon Sopel on 19 April 2010. During the interview, to talk about the party's recently launched manifesto, he appeared to have no knowledge of what was in the manifesto, saying that he was not prepared to discuss the \\"minutiae\\" of his party's policies. He added, \\"I haven't remembered it all in great detail. I didn't come on to talk about this sort of thing.\\" In January 2014, Nigel Farage said that \\"Malcolm Pearson, who was leader at the time, was picked up in interviews for not knowing the manifesto. Of course he didn't ‚Äì it was 486 pages of excessive detail. Eighteen months ago I said I want the whole lot taken down, we reject the whole thing ... I didn't read it. It was drivel. It was 486 pages of drivel ...

Expenses Shortly after Pearson's election as UKIP leader in 2009, the Daily Telegraph reported that he had claimed more than ¬£115,000 in Parliamentary expenses between 2001 and 2007, having designated his estate in Scotland as his main residence, although his ¬£3.7m house in London was designated as his principal residence for tax purposes, and he was thus not liable for ¬£275,000 in capital gains tax when he sold his London house in 2006. Previously he had spoken of the disconnect between ordinary people and the political class. In reply, Pearson argued that he spent \\"half the year\\" at his Scottish estate, pointed out that the sum covered several years in expenses and explained that working as a public servant had cost him \\"millions\\" as a result of having to give up salaried work.  Later career  In October 2019, Pearson resigned from UKIP to sit as an independent. He is also the co-founder of pro-free-trade think-tank, Global Britain, which publishes research on the BBC's EU coverage and on the cost of UK membership of the EU. He is active in the pro-hunting Countryside Alliance, serving as chairman of its deerstalking committee. Pearson also serves on the Board of Advisors for the , an NGO that works behind the scenes in crisis areas around the world.  Islam  In November 2013, Pearson was criticised by opponents for his comments about Islam in the United Kingdom, stating, \\"We see Sharia law running de facto in our land and we see a birth rate which is several times ours\\" and \\"These people hate us with frightening religious fervour and we are right to fear them.\\" This was condemned by Sayeeda Warsi, the Minister of State for Faith and Communities, who responded by stating: \\"It points at best to an ignorance about Islam and at worst a deliberate attempt to perpetuate a distorted image of the faith.\\" In June 2014, during a debate on the Trojan Horse Affair ‚Äì \\"What Faith in Our Schools?\\", hosted in Birmingham by the BBC, Lord Pearson asked: \\"Given all that is happening in Africa as well, why do the Government go on intoning that Islam is a religion of peace?\\" In November 2014, Pearson suggested that the Quran had inspired the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby, referring to \\"the violence in the Qur'an ‚Äì and indeed in the life and the example of Muhammad\\". Member of Parliament Yasmin Qureshi called Pearson's words \\"lies\\" and \\"nonsensical rubbish\\", while another MP, Khalid Mahmood, called them Islamophobic and said: \\"Obviously he hasn‚Äôt read the Qur'an. Islam is about submission to the Almighty. It is not about war against anybody else.\\" In March 2018, Pearson invited Tommy Robinson to Parliament.  Personal life  Pearson has been married three times: * firstly to Francesca Frua de Angeli in 1965, with whom he had one daughter, Silvia Lady Le Marchant (b.1966) and whom he divorced in 1970; * secondly to the Hon.

Life Krieger was born to a family of German origins, in the small city of Cerro Largo, in the southernmost state of Brazil, Rio Grande do Sul. In 1946, he moved to Porto Alegre to study medicine at the Medical School of Porto Alegre. There, while he was a student, he began working with Prof. Rubens Maciel at the Cardiology Department and decided to pursue a university career in the clinical area. In 1954, he started a training program for new physiologists, created by CAPES in Porto Alegre under the coordination of Prof. Maciel. Since Brazil had few physiological research labs at the time, the program was partly supervised by Argentine physiologists, under Prof. Bernardo Houssay's leadership (Nobel Prize, 1947). Having made himself noted for his brilliance and dedication, young Eduardo was invited to work on experimental hypertension with Prof. Eduardo Braun-Men√©ndez in Porto Alegre and Buenos Aires, at the famous Instituto de Biolog√≠a y Medicina Experimental created by Houssay. This opportunity represented a major influence on his later professional career. He then completed his training in cardiovascular physiology with Prof. W. Hamilton at the University of Georgia at Augusta, U.S., from 1956 to 1957. Back in Brazil, he was invited to work at the Department of Physiology of the recently created School of Medicine of Ribeir√£o Preto of the University of S√£o Paulo, in the city of Ribeir√£o Preto, state of S√£o Paulo. His sponsor was Prof. Miguel Rolando Covian, the new departmental chairman and an Argentine neurophysiologist who had belonged to Prof. Houssay's group and who became very impressed with Krieger during his formative years in Porto Alegre and Buenos Aires. Covian was not disappointed: Krieger completed his doctoral dissertation at Ribeir√£o Preto under the supervision of Prof. Covian and quickly matured as a strong scientific leader by himself. Besides heading an internationally renowned research group on experimental hypertension, he created the department's cardiovascular physiology group, which became a very influential school for many new physiologists in Brazil. As a result, new laboratories headed by Krieger's former pupils were created in several other universities, in Ribeir√£o Preto, S√£o Paulo, Belo Horizonte, Vit√≥ria, Porto Alegre and Recife. Dr. Krieger retired in 1983 from the Medical School of Ribeir√£o Preto, and since then has been working in hypertension research at the Heart Institute of the Faculty of Medicine of the University of S√£o Paulo, in S√£o Paulo City, having under his direction a multidisciplinary research group, including molecular biologists, physiologists and clinical physicians. He is married and has a son and a daughter, both scientists and research professors. Professor Krieger is Co- President designate of the 2014 World Health Summit. Research Dr. Krieger's main research field is the study of experimental hypertension in animal models and the physiological mechanisms of blood pressure regulation, mainly its neurogenic mechanisms. He described a method for performing the denervation of the sino-aortic baroceptor in the Norwegian rat which is widely used. His studies on the baroreceptor adaptation in hypertension and hypotension are widely recognized and have been published in the main scientific journals of the field. Dr. Krieger is one of the most highly cited Brazilian researchers. He was also a pioneer in using the rat as a model for the study of blood pressure regulation in sleep and exercise, as well as in the neural recording of electrical activity of the sympathetic system in physiological conditions. In collaboration with Prof. S√©rgio Henrique Ferreira in the last phase of the discovery of a new ACE inhibitor extracted from Bothrops venom, he demonstrated experimentally its efficacy in the reversion of experimental hypertension, thus opening the way for the eventual development of a new antihypertensive drug, captopril (trademarked Capoten) by Squibb scientists. Scientific leadership Along with his activities as a professor and researcher, Dr. Krieger has also made great contributions to the development of science and higher education in Brazil. He participated in the university reform at USP from 1968 to 1969, and cooperated with many research grants committees of CNPq (Brazilian National Research and Development Council, Ministry of Education (CAPES) and the S√£o Paulo Foundation for Research Support (FAPESP). He was one of the founders and a President of the Brazilian Society of Physiology (1979-1985), founder and the first President of the Brazilian Federation of Societies of Experimental Biology (FESBE - 1985-1991), and founder and first President of the Brazilian Society of Hypertension (1992-1994). He is one of the three editors who founded and directed the Brazilian Journal of Medical and Scientific Research, one of the best international scientific journals of best quality in the country. He belongs to both the Brazilian Academy of Sciences and to the Brazilian Academy of Medicine (elected 1998). At the international level, Prof. Krieger is a Director of the Committee on Science and Technology in Developing Countries (COSTED) since 1998, and a member of the Third World Academy of Sciences (TWAS) since 1995, and was a President of the Inter-American Society of Hypertension, Dr. Krieger has published more than 120 full papers in international journals. Under his supervision, 19 graduate students got their master's degrees and 23 their doctoral degrees. Among his many prizes and awards, Prof. Krieger holds the national decorations of the National Order of Scientific Merit by the Presidency of the Republic of Brazil (1994) and the Comenda da Legi√£o do M√©rito do Engenheiro Militar (Commend of the Legion of Merit of Military Engineer, 1999), the Lifetime Achievement Award of the Interamerican Society of Hypertension (1997), the Almirante √Ålvaro Alberto em Medicina e Sa√∫de P√∫blica Award (National Science Award) by the National Council of Scientific and Technological Development (1998), and the An√≠sio Teixeira Award by the Ministry of Education (2001).

It was held in Orillia for three years before being banned because of disturbances by festival-goers. After being held in various places in Ontario for a few decades, it returned to Orillia in 2000. Ruth Jones, her husband Dr. Crawford Jones, brother David Major and Pete McGarvey organized the first Mariposa Folk Festival in August 1961. The inaugural event, covered by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, featured all Canadian performers. The festival grew in popularity, size and rowdiness until the popularity of the 1963 festival (with over 8,000 advance tickets sold), and the lack of sufficient security, led to a backlash from town locals. The city of Orillia secured a court injunction to prevent the festival from continuing in the town limits. The first festival held in the Toronto area, in 1964, was at Maple Leaf Stadium. The subsequent three festivals were held at Innis Lake in Caledon, northwest of the city. In the 1970s it was held on the Toronto Islands before shifting to Harbourfront (Toronto) and Bathurst Street and later Molson Park in Barrie. In 2000, the Mariposa Folk Festival was invited back to Orillia by city councilors Tim Lauer and Don Evans. The festival continues to be held in Orillia. As well as folk music, the festival highlights other aspects of folk culture including dance, crafts, storytelling.

The name for the festival was borrowed from Stephen Leacock's Book Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town, which was inspired by the town of Orillia. Mariposa Folk Festival was held for the first time in 1961. In 1964 the festival moved unexpectedly to Toronto. Backlash from Orillia and Medonte township community members prevented the festival from continuing in its original location. Due to these circumstances as well as inclement weather, many people who had bought tickets to the festival did not attend. In 1966 the festival's format changed, under the direction of Estelle Klein. It became more workshop-based and featured multiple stages so that different performances could occur simultaneously. 1968 was the first year that the festival started on a Friday night. It was advertised with a focus on workshops rather than on headlining acts. In 1969 CBC filmed throughout the weekend of the festival, and created a documentary entitled ‚ÄúMariposa: A Folk Festival‚Äù, which aired on September 28, 1969.  1970s  In 1970 the \\"Native People area\\" at the festival was expanded, and was a success with festival visitors. This year also featured workshops investigating instrumental styles, music of specific regions and song exchanges. In 1971 there were no evening concerts or main stage performances. The festival was fully focused on workshops and small stage performances in order to promote smaller acts as well as already well known performers. The 1972 festival experienced heavy rainfall, but that did not affect festival attendance. Some well known musicians came to watch the festival including Joni Mitchell, Neil Young, Gordon Lightfoot, Bob Dylan and Jackson Browne and some of them were interested in performing. The festival organizers were unsure if they should include these performers because the festival was no longer focused on big name acts. Ultimately, Murry McLauchlan offered Joni Mitchell part of his performance time. Bruce Cockburn did the same for Neil Young. The 1973 festival featured musicians from around the world including Bai Konte from West Africa, Martin Carthy from England, Ardoin Family from Louisiana in the United States and the Boys of the Lough from Ulster and North England. 1975 was International Women's year, so the festival added many more female performers. In 1976 the festival received a government grant so that they could include a special group of Indigenous performers from the prairies. In 1977 the festival focused on the origins of North American folk music. The large variety of music was represented under four themes: black, Spanish, francophone and English. The 1979 festival featured a special pavilion of Labrador craftspeople, musicians and storytellers. It also increased its folk music activities for children. 50th anniversary In 2010, Mariposa celebrated its 50th festival by fielding a lineup of classic Mariposa artists and young developing talent. Gordon Lightfoot, Murray McLauchlan, Ian and Sylvia, and The Whiteley Brothers took the main stage on the festival's final day. Three new performers passed an audition to perform via the \\"up and coming showcase\\" program. The 2010 edition also featured Jason Collett and Serena Ryder, who headlined the mainstage on Friday and Saturday respectively. To mark the 50th anniversary of the festival, York University's Clara Thomas Archives and Special Collections launched an online exhibit highlighting a selection of archival material from the 1960s and 1970s. York acquired the Mariposa Folk Fest archives, which includes sound recordings and publicity documents, in 2007.

In addition to this, the year round program \\"Mariposa in the Schools\\" was created in order to bring folk musicians to local Ontario schools for musical programming. The Mariposa in the Schools program ended in 2018. However, the Festival continues to have children's programming on the festival weekend in their Folkplay area.  Publications  In 1977, editors Bill Usher and Linda Page-Harpa published an anthology in celebration of the festival titled \\"For what time I am in this world\\" : stories from Mariposa. In 2013, Sija Tsai published a doctoral thesis on the history of the festival, titled Mariposa Folk Festival: The Sounds, Sights, and Costs of a Fifty-Year Road Trip. In 2017, Michael Hill, the artistic director and the vice-president of Mariposa, and an organizer with the festival since 2000, published a book on the festival.

The Hlinka Guard was preceded by the Rodobrana (Home Defense/Nation's Defense) organization, which existed from 1923 to 1927, when the Czechoslovak authorities ordered its dissolution. During the crisis caused by Hitler's demand for the Sudetenland (in the summer of 1938), the Hlinka Guard emerged spontaneously, and on October 8 of that year, a week after Hitler's demand had been accepted at the Munich conference, the guard was officially set up, with Karol Sidor (1901‚Äì1953) as its first commander. The Hlinka Guard was known for its participation in the Holocaust in Slovakia; its members appropriated Jewish property and rounded up Jews for deportation in 1942. Under one of the Bene≈° decrees, No. 16/1945 Coll., membership of the Hlinka Guard was punishable by 5 to 20 years' imprisonment. Duties The guard was the Hlinka party's military arm for internal security, and it continued in that role under the autonomous government of Slovakia in federated Czecho-Slovakia. The Hlinka Guard were Slovakia's state police and most willingly helped Hitler with his plans. It operated against Jews, Czechs, Hungarians, the Left, and the opposition. By a decree issued on October 29, 1938, the Hlinka Guard was designated as the only body authorized to give its members paramilitary training, and it was this decree that established its formal status in the country. Hlinka guardsmen wore black uniforms and a cap shaped like a boat, with a woolen pompom on top, and they used the raised-arm salute. The official salute was \\"Na str√°≈æ!\\" (\\"On guard!\\"). Membership Until March 14, 1939, when Slovakia declared its independence, the Hlinka Guard attracted recruits from all walks of life. On the following day, March 15, Alexander Mach became its commander, retaining the post up to the collapse of the pro-Nazi regime in Slovakia in 1945. Its functions were laid down in a series of government decrees: it was to be a paramilitary organization attached to the party, fostering love of country, providing paramilitary training, and safeguarding internal security. By assuming these tasks, the guard was meant to counterbalance the army and the police. In 1941 Hlinka Guard shock troops were trained in SS camps in Germany, and the SS attached an adviser to the guard. At this point many of the guardsmen who were of middle-class origin quit, and thenceforth the organization consisted of peasants and unskilled laborers, together with various doubtful elements. A social message was an integral part of the radical nationalism that it sought to impart. Deportation of the Jews In November 1938, the Hlinka Guard participated in the deportation of thousands of Jews. In 1942, the guard was involved in the deportation of almost 60,000 Slovak Jews to occupied Poland. The victims were given only four hours' warning, to prevent them from escaping. Beatings and forcible shaving were commonplace, as was subjecting Jews to invasive searches to uncover hidden valuables. Some guards took advantage of their power to rape Jewish women. Political competition A small group called N√°≈° Boj (Our Struggle), which operated under SS auspices, was the most radical element in the guard. Throughout its years of existence, the Hlinka Guard competed with the Hlinka party for primacy in ruling the country. After the anti-Nazi Slovak National Uprising was crushed in August 1944, the SS took over and shaped the Hlinka Guard to suit its own purposes. Special units of the guard (Hlinka Guard Emergency Divisions ‚Äì POHG) were employed against partisans and Jews. Legacy In the 2010s, the Hlinka Guard's uniforms made a reappearance in Slovakia as the preferred dress of far-right politician Marian Kotleba and his Our Slovakia party. Kotleba's group made minor alterations to the uniforms, as wearing the original uniforms remains illegal in Slovakia.

Since it was known to Irenaeus, a Church Father, it must have been written before around 180 CE. It describes Jesus appearing and giving secret knowledge (gnosis) to John the Apostle. The author describes it having occurred after Jesus \\"has gone back to the place from which he came\\". The book is reputed to bear that revelation. Overview Many Christians in the second century hoped to receive a transcendent personal revelation such as Paul the Apostle reported to the church at Corinth () or that John experienced on the isle of Patmos, which inspired the Book of Revelation.Pagels 2003:97 and bibliography at note 69 As Acts narrates what happened after the time Jesus ascended to heaven, so the Apocryphon of John begins at the same point but relates how Christ reappeared to John. The opening words of the Secret Book of John are, \\"The teaching of the saviour, and the revelation of the mysteries and the things hidden in silence, even these things which he taught John, his disciple.\\" The author John is immediately specified as \\"John, the brother of James‚Äîwho are the sons of Zebedee.\\" The remainder of the book is a vision of spiritual realms and of the prior history of spiritual humanity. There are four separate surviving manuscripts of \\"The Secret Book of John\\". One was purchased in Egypt in 1896 (the Berlin Codex); three were found in the Nag Hammadi codices in 1945. All four versions date to the 4th century. Three of these appear to be independently produced Coptic translations of an original Greek text. Two of the four are similar enough that they probably represent copies of a single source. Although the different versions of the texts have minor variants (the Berlin Codex has many minor differences with Nag Hammadi II and IV), all texts generally agree on the assertion that the main revealing entity was Jesus. History A book called the Apocryphon of John was referred to by Irenaeus in Adversus Haereses, written about 185, among \\"an indescribable number of secret and illegitimate writings, which they themselves have forged, to bewilder the minds of foolish people, who are ignorant of the true scriptures\\"Adversus Haereses 1.20.1.‚Äîscriptures which Irenaeus himself helped to establish (see the canonical four). Among the writings he quotes from, in order to expose and refute them, are the Gospel of Truth, Gospel of Judas, and this secret book of John.Pagels 2003:96 etc. Little more was known of this text until 1945, when a cache of thirteen papyrus codices (bound books) that had been hidden away in the 4th century, was fortuitously discovered at Nag Hammadi in Egypt (CG II). The Apocryphon of John was among the texts, in three Coptic versions translated from the Greek. Two of the versions are very similar and represent one manuscript tradition; they incorporate a lengthy excerpt from a certain Book of Zoroaster appended to the Apocryphon (as chapters 15:29 ‚Äì 19:8f) A shorter version of the Apocryphon found at Nag Hammadi does not contain the interpolation and represents another manuscript tradition. Still another version of this short edition of the text was discovered in an ancient Coptic Codex acquired by Dr. Carl Reinhardt in Cairo in 1896. This manuscript (identified as the \\"Berlin Gnostic Codex\\" or BG 8502) was used along with the three versions found at Nag Hammadi to produce the translations now available. The fact that four manuscript \\"editions\\" of this text survived‚Äîtwo \\"long\\" versions and two \\"short\\" versions‚Äîsuggests how important this text was in early gnostic Christian circles. In the three Nag Hammadi codices the Apocryphon of John appears always in the first version. Influence The Apocryphon, set in the framing device of a revelation delivered by the resurrected Christ to John the son of Zebedee, contains some of the most extensive detailing of classic dualistic Gnostic mythology that has survived; as one of the principal texts of the Nag Hammadi library, it is an essential text of study for anyone interested in Gnosticism. Frederick Wisse, who translated it, asserts that \\"The Apocryphon of John was still used in the eighth century by the Audians of Mesopotamia\\" (Wisse p 104). The Apocryphon of John has become the central text for studying the gnostic tradition of Antiquity. The creation mythology it details has been studied by Carl Jung and Eric Voegelin. Summary of the text and its cosmology There are currently four surviving copies of The Secret Revelation of John. They are largely the same in their basic structure and content. One notable difference between the codices is their individual length. The Berlin Codex and Nag Hammadi Codex III are shorter than the Nag Hammadi Codices I and II. Another point of departure between codices is the portrayal of the Savior/Christ figure. The Berlin Codex generally uses the term ‚ÄúChrist‚Äù more frequently, whereas the Nag Hammadi Codex III narrative often substitutes the term ‚ÄúLord‚Äù or ‚ÄúSavior‚Äù. However, the Nag Hammadi Codex III closes its text with the prayer ‚ÄúJesus Christ, Amen.‚Äù An additional distinction, with regards to the Christian framing of the texts, is that Nag Hammadi Codex III goes into greater detail about the descent of the Christ/Savior figure into the prison-world of Demiurge and his role in facilitating the reawakening and liberation of mankind. These distinctions may represent a certain degree of variation in the way that Gnostic cosmology was woven into a Christian context. The below summary of the Apocryphon is derived from Wisse's translation. The text begins with John describing his own state of grief and bewilderment after Christ's crucifixion. The Savior then appears, takes various forms, and after banishing John's fears, provides the following cosmological narrative. The highest divine principle is the Monad. The Monad is described as a ‚Äúmonarchy with nothing above it‚Äù. He is supreme, absolute, eternal, infinite, perfect, holy and self-sufficient. However, his transcendent ineffability is also emphasized. He is neither quantifiable nor can his qualities ever truly be described. The Monad exists in inconceivable perfection. The Monad produces from his thought a feminine divine entity or principle named Barbelo. She is described as ‚Äúthe first thought‚Äù, and the ‚Äúimage‚Äù of the Monad. While Barbelo is always referred to as a ‚Äòshe‚Äô, she is also described as both the primordial mother and father. She is also regarded as ‚Äúthe first man‚Äù and described in various terms of androgyny. She is the first of a class of beings referred to as the Aeons, and an exchange between herself and the Monad brings the other Aeons into being. Additionally, the properties of Light and Mind are born from the Monad's reflection on Barbelo. Light is synonymous with Christ, also called ‚ÄúChrist the Autogenes‚Äù. The Light and the Mind engage in further creative activity, aided by and glorifying the superior principles of Barbelo and the Monad. Together, they bring forth further Aeons and powers. Eventually, one of the Aeons, Sophia ‚Äúof the Epinoia‚Äù, disrupts the harmony of these processes by engaging in creative activity without the participation or consent of the Spirit of the Monad and without the aid of a male consort. The creative power of her thought produces an entity named Yaltabaoth, who is the first of a series of incomplete, demonic entities called the Archons. Yaltabaoth, whose character is malevolent and arrogant, also has a grotesque form. His head is that of a lion while he possesses a serpentine body. Recognizing the deformed, imperfect nature of her offspring, Sophia attempts to conceal it somewhere where the other Aeons will not discover it. The act of hiding Yaltabaoth also has the result that Yaltabaoth himself remains ignorant of the upper world and the other Aeons. Despite the fact that Yaltabaoth possesses only a single parent and was created without the consent of the Spirit of the Monad, he is powerful enough to mimic the creative processes of the superior Aeons. He creates a whole host of other Archons, each of whom share his own basically deficient character, and creates a world for them to inhabit. This world is fundamentally inferior to the world above. It is fashioned out of darkness, but animated by light stolen from Sophia. The result is a world that is neither ‚Äúlight nor dark‚Äù but is instead ‚Äúdim.‚Äù In his arrogance and ignorance, Yaltabaoth declares himself the sole and jealous God of this realm. Recognizing the imperfection of Yaltabaoth and his counterfeit world, Sophia repents. In forgiveness of her error, the Spirit of the Monad assists the other Aeons and powers in an attempt to redeem Sophia and her bastard creation. During this process Yaltabaoth and his Archons hear the voice of the Monad's Spirit. While they are terrified by the voice, its echo leaves a trace of an image of the Spirit on the ‚Äúwaters‚Äù that form the roof of their realm. Hoping to harness this power for themselves, they attempt to create a copy of this image. The end result of this process is the first human man, Adam. Recognizing an opportunity to retrieve the light imprisoned in the darkness of Yaltabaoth and his world, Sophia and agents of the higher order, referred to variously as the ‚Äòplenoria‚Äô or the ‚ÄòEpinoia‚Äô, and later as the ‚Äòpleroma‚Äô, devise a scheme. They trick Yaltabaoth into blowing his own spiritual essence into Adam. This simultaneously animates Adam and empties Yaltabaoth of the portion of his being derived from Sophia. Seeing the luminosity, intelligence and general superiority of the now animate Adam, Yaltabaoth and the Archons regret their creation and do their best to imprison or dispose of him. Failing to do so, they then attempt to neutralize him by placing him in the Garden of Eden. In this narrative, the Garden of Eden is a false paradise where the fruit of the trees is sin, lust, ignorance, confinement and death. While they give Adam access to the Tree of Life, they conceal the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. According to this narrative, the Tree of Knowledge actually represents the penetration of the positive forces of the higher world and the Epinoia into Yaltabaoth's realm. At this point in the narrative, Christ reveals to John that it was he who caused Adam to consume the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge. Additionally, it is revealed that Eve is a helper sent by agents of the higher order to help liberate the light imprisoned in Yaltabaoth's creation and in Adam. She is created when Yaltabaoth attempts to draw the light out of Adam. This results in the creation of the female body. When Adam perceives her, he sees a reflection of his own essence and is freed from the bewitching power of Yaltabaoth. The narrative then details Yaltabaoth's attempts to regain control over the essence of Light. His primary scheme is to initiate the activity of human reproduction, by which he hopes to create new human bodies inhabited by a counterfeit spirit. This counterfeit spirit allows Yaltabaoth and his agents to deceive the human race, keeping them in ignorance of their true nature, and is the primary means by which Yaltabaoth keeps humanity in subjugation. It is the source of all earthly evil and confusion, and causes people to die ‚Äúnot having found truth and without knowing the God of truth‚Äù. Following this revelation, the narrative then takes the form of a series of questions and answers between John and the Savior. These address a number of subjects, but are largely soteriological in nature. John asks Christ who is eligible for salvation, and Christ responds with the answer that those who come in contact with the true Spirit will receive salvation, while those who are dominated by the counterfeit spirit will receive damnation. Christ also reveals his own role as a liberating agent of the higher realm, in this context. Christ, who describes himself as the ‚Äúremembrance of the Pronoia‚Äù and ‚Äúthe remembrance of the pleroma‚Äù, brings light into the darkness of Yaltabaoth's prison. Here, he rouses the prisoners to wakefulness and remembrance. Those who receive and are woken by Christ's revelation are raised up and ‚Äúsealed‚Ä¶ in the light of the water with five seals‚Äù. They are thus spared from death and damnation. This aspect of Christ's role is elaborated on more fully by Nag Hammadi Codex III, whereas it is omitted from the Berlin Codex. This concludes Christ's message. Finally, the savior states that anyone who shares these revelations for personal profit will be cursed. The Nag Hammadi Codex III version of the text ends with the prayer, ‚ÄúJesus Christ, Amen‚Äù.

Keys to Ascension 2 received mixed reviews from music critics. It reached No. 62 on the UK Albums Chart and No. 169 on the Billboard 200 in the United States. A promotional North American tour was scheduled to start in June 1997, but it was cancelled after Wakeman had already been booked for other projects which led to his departure from the band. The studio material from the Keys to Ascension albums was compiled on Keystudio (2001), and both albums were reissued in their entirety in 1998 and 2010, the latter with the concert video as a bonus disc. Background In mid-1995, guitarist Steve Howe and keyboardist Rick Wakeman returned to the group which had also comprised lead vocalist Jon Anderson, bassist Chris Squire, and drummer Alan White. The five assembled in San Luis Obispo, California to rehearse and record new studio material which included concerts at the city's Fremont Theater from 4‚Äì6 March 1996, the first live performance of this particular line-up since 1979. The first half of their live set from the 1996 shows, plus two new studio tracks, were released as Keys to Ascension in October 1996 by Essential Records. By the time Keys to Ascension was released, the label had expressed a wish for the group to put out roughly 45 minutes of new studio material with the remaining unreleased live tracks from the 1996 concerts as a second instalment of the Keys to Ascension series. The band agreed, and had a deadline to hand over the finished album by the end of November 1996 in exchange for a sum of money from the label that Christmas. Wakeman was \\"heavily against\\" the album's title due to his excitement over the quality of the new songs that Yes had recorded which he thought deserved to be released as a separate album. Production=Live tracks The live tracks were recorded at the Fremont Theater in San Luis Obispo, California Disc one contains the remaining unreleased live tracks from the three shows at the Fremont Theatre in March 1996. This includes material from Time and a Word (1970), The Yes Album (1971), Close to the Edge (1972), and Going for the One (1977). Studio tracks Disc two contains five studio tracks that were recorded in the course of a year from the fall of 1995. After promoting Keys to Ascension the group finalised the arrangements mainly from ideas that Anderson, Squire, and White had already put down and recorded the songs in November 1996. The band leased a building in San Luis Obispo that was once a bank and set up a recording studio inside that was later dubbed Yesworld Studio on the album's sleeve notes. Working with the band was Tom Fletcher, who was only available to oversee production of the live tracks as he commitments with Steve Lukather. This prompted Squire to suggest Billy Sherwood, who had played additional guitars during Yes's 1994 tour, to complete production on the studio material and additional recording, engineering, and mixing. This was the first time Wakeman had worked with Sherwood, and the keyboardist praised Sherwood's attitude and contributions to the album. Wakeman was particularly pleased with the studio tracks on Keys to Ascension 2, rating them \\"light years\\" ahead of the studio material on its predecessor. He reasoned this down to the sense of maturity in the songs and the greater amount of input from the band in terms of what they and other members played, something that had not been done for a long time. \\"Mind Drive\\" was originally a song that was rehearsed by the proposed supergroup XYZ featuring Squire, White, and guitarist Jimmy Page. \\"Children of the Light\\" was originally written by Jon and Vangelis in 1986 as \\"Distant Thunder\\". A demo version was recorded by Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe which was included as a hidden track on the 2011 reissue of Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe (1989). The lyrics to the song was printed on the band's 1991 tour book. The original version of \\"Children of the Light\\" included a keyboard introduction written by Wakeman entitled \\"Lightning\\", but it was removed prior to the album's release. In 1998, Howe said that the introduction was taken off following the group's overall dissatisfaction with it, an opinion that the record company also shared. The section was restored on the 2001 compilation album Keystudio, which combined the studio tracks from both Keys to Ascension albums. The version of \\"Children of the Light\\" on the compilation, however, has a verse removed. Artwork As with its predecessor, Keys to Ascension 2 features cover art by Roger Dean on an outer sleeve that fits around the package. On the sleeve, the image's predominant colour is magenta, but the booklet features the painting in its original blue colouration. Release The studio tracks from this album and Keys to Ascension were rereleased on Keystudio. The whole album was reissued in 2010 along with its earlier companion album Keys to Ascension and the concert video of the same name as part of the Keys to Ascension box set.

As a lawsuit may comprise numerous claims made by and against numerous parties, not every dispositive motion seeks to dispose of the entire lawsuit. In the U.S., the most common type of dispositive motions seeking to dispose of the entire lawsuit are those for summary judgment. Many U.S. state jurisdictions also provide for a \\"partial summary judgment\\" or motion for \\"summary adjudication of issues\\" which only seeks to dispose of part of a lawsuit. See, e.g., California Code of Civil Procedure section 437c(f)(1). Regardless whether the dispositive motion is for summary judgment or adjudication, the motion must be supported by declarations under oath, excerpts from depositions which are also under oath, admissions of fact by the opposing party and other discovery such as interrogatories, as well as a legal argument (points and authorities). The other party may respond with counter-declarations, discovery responses, and legal arguments attempting to show that these issues were \\"triable issues of fact.\\" If there is any question as to whether there is conflict on the facts on an issue, the summary judgment or adjudication must be denied regarding that matter. In many cases, a decision on a dispositive motion is a prerequisite for appellate review. See, e.g., Wash. Rules of Appellate Procedure 2.2. The two principal types of dispositive motions in contemporary American legal practice are the motion to dismiss (sometimes referred to as a demurrer in a minority of U.S. state jurisdictions) and the motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication of issues. A dispositive motion may also be used to request that an indictment be dismissed or quashed, or for judgment on pleadings. At least in some jurisdictions, a corporation's motion to terminate a shareholder's derivative suit is treated as a dispositive motion. See, e.g., Dreiling v. Jain, 151 Wn.2d 900, 93 P.3d 861 (2004).

They only released one demo, Fhtagn nagh Yog-Sothoth (1991), and one album, Stream from the Heavens (1994). Their sound was extremely slow and dirge-like in long pieces, which combined heavy guitar riffs, extremely deep death grunts and sparse lead guitar melodies. The band disbanded a year before the release of the album and its members focused on other projects. Niko Sirki√§ and Jori Sj√∂roos went on to form This Empty Flow, which marked a distinct stylistic departure from Thergothon. The project began as somewhat of a shoegaze band, taking cues from groups like Slowdive, but ended up as more in the area of trip hop. Lately Sj√∂roos has gained reputation for composing songs for popular Finnish pop rock act PMMP. Sirki√§, later known as Niko Skorpio, works as a visual artist and records experimental electronic music. He also used to run a record label called Some Place Else. History The band was founded in 1990 by vocalist Niko Skorpio, drummer Jori Sj√∂roos and guitarist Mikko Ruotsalainen as a death metal band, but soon became a doom metal band. In early 1991, Sami Kaveri was added as a second guitarist. A first demo recorded afterwards titled Dancing in the Realm of Shades was never officially released and the band made a new attempt in November 1991. This demo, titled Fhtagn nagh Yog-Sothoth, was released the same year in a limited edition of 600 copies and was licensed to the USA and Poland. In the spring of 1992, the band gave two concerts in or near Turku, where they played an extremely slow version of Venom's \\"In League with Satan\\". The band itself did not find concerts as an appropriate presentation of the studio material. Preparations for the debut album began in the summer of 1992. Sami Kaveri left the band at that time and the band focused entirely on the role of a studio band, neither playing live nor rehearsing for it. Through this concentration of roles and people, the roles gradually dissolved and the members of the band exchanged their instruments and experimented with new ones. After the band had signed with the Italian label Obscure Plasma Records and began recording Stream from the Heavens in autumn 1992; two of the six songs on it were new recordings of songs from Fhtagn-nagh Yog-Sothoth. After completing the recordings and selecting the cover for the debut, the group decided to disband in spring 1993. The release of the album was delayed until 1994 and it was highly neglected by the music press. With time however, it sold several thousand copies worldwide. In 2009, Russian record label Solitude Productions released a tribute album titled Rising of Yog-Sothoth: A Tribute to Thergothon, which contains contributions from bands such as Worship, Evoken and Asunder, Mournful Congregation, Colosseum and Officium Triste. Musical style Thergothon's music was very slow with extremely deep guttural vocals, using heavy guitar riffs, very deeply tuned guitars and with few lead guitar melodies. In addition to death metal, the band also integrated influences from styles such as gothic rock, ambient and progressive rock.

While never released as a single, \\"Thunder Road\\" is ranked as one of Springsteen's greatest songs and one of the top rock songs in history. It is No. 86 on Rolling Stones 500 Greatest Songs of All Time list, and also the 92nd best ranked song on critics' all-time lists according to Acclaimed Music. Composition and Recording \\"Thunder Road\\" was written by Springsteen while at his living room piano in Long Branch, New Jersey. In October 1974, it existed as a solo recording, \\"Chrissie's Song\\", that included the line, \\"leave what you've lost, leave what's grown cold, Thunder Road\\". By early 1975, Springsteen had combined lyrics from another composition, \\"Walking in the Street\\", forming a new song, \\"Wings For Wheels\\", which he debuted on February 5, 1975, at a benefit for a local club, The Main Point, radio broadcast in the Philadelphia area, and featuring four yet-to-be-released Born to Run songs. Still unsatisfied, he finished dismantling \\"Walking In the Street\\", by importing its main coda into \\"Wings for Wheels\\" as the instrumental ending, now calling it \\"Thunder Road\\". Springsteen stated at a 1978 concert that the name of his song had been inspired by seeing a poster of the 1958 Robert Mitchum film Thunder Road, though he did not see it. On April 13, 1975, music critic and record producer Jon Landau officially joined the album's production team, marking the start of a life-long professional relationship. At Landau's suggestion, production was moved from 914 Sound Studios to Record Plant studios in Manhattan. When sessions began on April 18, Jimmy Iovine, fresh from recording John Lennon's \\"Walls and Bridges\\", replaced Louis Lahav (who returned to Israel in March) as engineer. Bruce later describes as a \\"brilliant imposter\\" and a \\"young studio dog with fastest learning curve I've ever seen\\". After three intensive days (April 18, 19 and 23) working on \\"Thunder Road\\", nothing further was noted in studio logs until July 15 - 16, when final overdubs and mixing were done. In his autobiography, Bruce Springsteen says he loosely envisioned Born to Run as a series of vignettes, following its character throughout the day, with \\"Thunder Road\\" serving as an \\"invitation\\" to the album and opening with a harmonica that suggests the beginning of a \\"new day\\". Springsteen also describes Landau as an \\"astute arranger and editor\\" who \\"guarded against overplaying and guided our record toward a more streamlined sound\\". Speaking to author Brian Hiatt about \\"Thunder Road\\" in 2005, Landau states it \\"was fantastic, but it was a little unwieldy, a little unfocused, a little more like a jam piece. [‚Ä¶] I remember talking with Bruce about a few ideas about how to just reshuffle the deck a little bit, and keep the song building from the very beginning right through the end.\\" Lyrics and music The lyrics to \\"Thunder Road\\" describe a young woman named Mary, her boyfriend, and their \\"one last chance to make it real\\". Musically, the song opens with a quiet piano (Roy Bittan) and harmonica (Springsteen) introduction, meant, as Springsteen said years later in the Wings for Wheels documentary, as a signifier that something was about to happen. The title phrase is not used until the middle section of the song. After the closing line, there is a tenor saxophone and Fender Rhodes duet played by Clarence Clemons and Bittan in the instrumental coda. In this song, Springsteen mentions Roy Orbison \\"singing for the lonely\\" on the radio. Orbison, one of whose best-known songs is \\"Only the Lonely\\" (1960), was a huge influence on Springsteen.Springsteen, Bruce. South By Southwest Keynote Address. Austin, TX. March 15. 2012. Acclaim In 2004, it was ranked No. 1 on the list of the \\"885 All-Time Greatest Songs\\" compiled by WXPN (the University of Pennsylvania's public radio station). The song came in at No. 226 in Q magazine's list of the \\"1001 Greatest Songs Ever\\" in 2003, in which they described the song as \\"best for pleading on the porch\\". Julia Roberts, when asked which song lyric described her most accurately, chose \\"Thunder Road\\"'s \\"You ain't a beauty, but hey, you're alright.\\" The song is featured in the book 31 Songs by British author Nick Hornby. It is ranked No. 86 on Rolling Stones 500 Greatest Songs of All Time list. It is also ranked number 3 on the magazine's list of his best songs. According to Acclaimed Music, it is the 92nd most celebrated song in popular music. Live performance history During the 1974 to 1977 Born to Run tours, \\"Thunder Road\\" was always played by Springsteen accompanied only by Roy Bittan's piano and Danny Federici's glockenspiel, an example of which is found on Hammersmith Odeon London '75. Not until later in the tour did \\"Thunder Road\\" make full-band appearances. In the 1978 tour \\"Thunder Road\\" usually opened with Springsteen telling a story as to why he wrote the song, and it might segue out of some other more dirge- like song such as \\"Racing in the Street\\". In concerts during the 1980s, the coda of the song was stretched out to showcase E Street Band saxophonist Clarence Clemons. Clemons and Springsteen would charge at each other from opposite ends of the stage, with Springsteen sliding into Clemons in an embrace. The early 1990s \\"Other Band\\" Tour performed the song on acoustic guitar with an organ in the background; this arrangement is documented on the 1993 concert video and album In Concert/MTV Plugged. The song then disappeared from Springsteen concerts until emerging again in 1999 in the Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band Reunion Tour, where it was played at a significantly slower tempo than the studio version while Springsteen pointed to people he knew or to females in the front rows. An example of such a performance can be found in the 2001 release Live in New York City. Although played fairly regularly on The Rising Tour as on Live in Barcelona, the song then rarely appeared on the Devils & Dust Tour, this time on piano. The song was not performed during the Sessions Band Tour; it reappeared on 2007‚Äì2008 Magic Tour and continued to be played regularly on the 2009 Working on a Dream Tour. On June 14, 2008, on stage at Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, Springsteen dedicated a performance of the song to political broadcast analyst Tim Russert, a longtime Springsteen fan who had suddenly died the previous day. On June 18, 2008, Springsteen performed the song, with acoustic guitar, for a Russert memorial event in Washington DC via tape-delayed satellite. On November 7, 2016, Springsteen performed the song at a Hillary Clinton presidential election rally in Philadelphia. In 2016 a fan made a video compilation of Springsteen performing \\"Thunder Road\\" over 41 years. The video illustrates how Springsteen's performance of the song has changed over the years.

The CTZ is located within the area postrema, which is on the floor of the fourth ventricle and is outside of the blood‚Äìbrain barrier. It is also part of the vomiting center itself. The neurotransmitters implicated in the control of nausea and vomiting include acetylcholine, dopamine, histamine (H1 receptor), substance P (NK-1 receptor), and serotonin (5-HT3 receptor). There are also opioid receptors present, which may be involved in the mechanism by which opiates cause nausea and vomiting. The blood‚Äìbrain barrier is not as developed here; therefore, drugs such as dopamine which cannot normally enter the CNS may still stimulate the CTZ. Evolutionary significance The CTZ is in the medulla oblongata, which is phylogenetically the oldest part of the central nervous system. Early lifeforms developed a brainstem, or inner brain, and nothing more. This part of the brain is responsible for basic survival instincts and reactions, for example to make an organism turn its head and look where an auditory stimulus was heard. The brainstem is where the medulla is located, and therefore also the area postrema and the CTZ. Then later lifeforms developed another segment of the brain, which includes the limbic system. This area of the brain is responsible for producing emotion and emotional responses to external stimuli, and also is significantly involved in memory and reward systems. Evolutionarily, the cerebral cortex is the most recent development. This area of the brain is responsible for critical thinking and reasoning, and is actively involved in decision making. It has been discovered that a major cause of increased intelligence in species including humans is the increase in cortical neurons in the brain. The emetic response was selected for protective purposes, and serves as a safeguard against poisoning of the body. This response gets toxins and drugs out of the body by summoning control over motor neurons which stimulate muscles in the chest and thoracic diaphragm to expel contents from the stomach. Chemoreception Since the CTZ is located in the area postrema, a sensory circumventricular organ, it does not have a blood‚Äìbrain barrier. This means that large polar molecules, such as emetic toxins, can diffuse through to and reach the CTZ quite easily. This is because the medulla oblongata is located in the area of the brain, the most inferior portion, which does not have a robust and highly developed blood-brain barrier. Without this barrier, emetic drugs and toxins are free to interact with a receptor (biochemistry), or multiple receptors located in the CTZ. These receptors in the CTZ are called chemoreceptors because they interact with different types of chemicals which are usually referred to as neurotransmitters. These neurotransmitters implement their effects on the CTZ receptors by binding to them which sets off a chain of events which produces an action potential. Studies have shown that neurons in the CTZ increase their rate of firing when exposed to emetic substances. The CTZ has many different types of receptors, which are specific to different types of toxins or drugs that might be present in the bloodstream and thus that can affect the CTZ. Types of CTZ receptors include dopamine, serotonin, histamine, substance P, opioid, and acetylcholine receptors. It has been discovered that the cholinergic neurons are actually nicotinic.Hori, N. et al. (2000). Brainstem slice studies of receptor activation in the mouse area postrema. Society for Neuroscience Abstracts. 26(1-2) Abstract No.-716.13. These receptors are meant to monitor the amount of associated neurotransmitter of these receptors in the blood. For instance, the CTZ has opioid receptors that monitor the level of opioids in the blood, and when the amount of opioids in the blood reach a certain level, the opioid receptors in the CTZ will signal to the rest of the vomiting center to initiate vomiting. This is because the CTZ sends the \\"vomit\\" command through action potentials, and these specific action potentials that trigger emesis are only produced when a certain amount of opioids bind to a certain amount of opioid receptors in the CTZ. Neurons in the CTZ, and area postrema in general, actually have two types of receptors: those at the surface of the neuron and those that are located deeper down in the dendrites. The receptors on the surface of the neuron are chemoreceptors that are activated from direct contact of emetic substances in the blood, whereas the receptors that are deeper down on the dendrites are receptors that are activated in response to the activated chemoreceptors on the surface. Communication The vomiting center of the brain refers to the groups of loosely organized neurons in the medulla that include the CTZ within the area postrema and the nucleus tractus solitarii. One of the ways the chemoreceptor trigger zone implements its effects on the vomiting center is by activation of the opioid mu receptors and delta receptors. The activation of these opioid receptors in the CTZ are especially important for patients who take opioid based pain medications on a regular basis. However, opioids do not play a role in communication to the vomiting center of the brain, they only induce communication. Dopamine and serotonin have been found to play the biggest role in communication from the CTZ to the remainder of the vomiting center, as well as histamine. Chemoreceptors in the CTZ relay information about the presence of emetic agents in the blood to the adjacent nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS). The relaying happens by the initiation of an action potential, which is caused by the chemoreceptor causing a change in electric potential in the neuron it is embedded in, which then subsequently causes an action potential. This happens constantly, so the chemoreceptors in the CTZ are continually sending information about how much emetic agents are in the blood, even when emesis is not signaled for. The NTS is organized into subnuclei that direct many different functions relating to swallowing, gastric sensation, laryngeal and pharyngeal sensation, baroreceptor function, and respiration. The NTS directs signals about these functions to a central pattern generator (CPG). This CPG actually coordinates the sequences of physical movements during emesis. The main neurotransmitters involved in communication between the CTZ and remaining vomiting center are serotonin, dopamine, histamine, and endogenous opioids which include endorphins, enkephalins, dynorphin. The CTZ communicates with the other parts of the vomiting center through neurons that contain 5-HT3, D2, H1 and H2 receptors. It has been seen that intraventricular administration of histamine in dogs causes an emetic response. This shows that histamine plays a significant role in signaling for emetic action in the CTZ. Some classes of molecules have been shown to inhibit the emetic response due to histamine, these include mepyramine, burimamide and metiamide. Phosphodiesterases Recent studies have found that phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibitors, such as Rolipram, cause emesis as one of their side effects. It has been found that these PDE4 isoforms are expressed in the CTZ and in the brainstem in general. The mRNA products from genes that code for these PDE4 isoforms are plentiful in the CTZ, and not only located in CTZ neurons, but also in glial cells and blood vessels associated with the CTZ neurons. PDE4 mRNAs are transcribed more in the area postrema and the CTZ than anywhere else in the brainstem. The PDE4 degrades the phosphodiester bonds in the second messenger molecule cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which is one of the ways the brain relays information. By modifying cAMP signaling in the CTZ, it is thought that this could mediate the emetic effects of PDE4 inhibitors in the CTZ. H-channels Most of the neurons located in the CTZ express hyperpolarization-activated cation channels (H-channels). Since the neurons in the CTZ convey information relating to emesis to the other parts of the vomiting center, it was thought that these H-channels might play a role in nausea and the emetic response. Recently, evidence of this notion that H-channels in CTZ neurons play a role in emesis has come to light. It has been found that ZD7288, which is a H-channel inhibitor, inhibited the acquisition of conditioned taste aversion (CTA) in rats and reduced apomorphine-induced c-Fos expression in the area postrema where the CTZ is located. This suggests that the neurons that express H-channels in the CTZ and area postrema are involved in nausea and the emetic response. The vomiting center of the brain This integrates the emetic response. This is the area in which \\"a final decision is made\\" about whether to evoke an emetic response or not. This decision is based heavily on the information which the CTZ relays to the rest of the vomiting center, but also the chemoreceptors in the GI tract, the information sent to the vomiting center by the vestibular system, and higher order centers located in the cortex. The vomiting center is not a discrete or specific place in the brain, but rather an area consisting of many nuclei, axons, and receptors that together cause the physical changes necessary to induce vomiting. Also, emesis can occur by direct neural stimulation of the vomiting center.Encarnacion, H. J. et al. (2009). Vomiting. Compendium- Continuing Education for Veterinarians. 31(3): 122-+. Damage to the CTZ Damage to the CTZ can come via stroke, physical injury, or over-excitation resulting in neuron death. Once the damage has occurred, the effects can cause the emetic response to disappear, or cause the emetic response to heighten, in some cases causing intractable vomiting that leave patients in severe distress. In cases such as these, if the damage is severe enough, little can be done to inhibit an intractable vomiting response because the chemoreceptors in the CTZ are physically damaged or hindered in some way. Recently, it has been discovered that physical changes in the area postrema and CTZ do in fact cause emesis or inhibit it. Specifically, compression of blood vessels which are physically located near in or around the CTZ, and that result in physical compression of the area postrema as a whole, have been found to be the cause of chronic medically intractable emesis and weight loss. Surgical microvascular decompression resulted in postoperative and long-term resolution of emesis. Antiemetic medications Antiemetic medications often target the CTZ to completely inhibit or greatly reduce vomiting. Most of these work by not allowing certain blood-borne drugs (usually pain killers or stimulants) to bind to their respective receptors located in the CTZ. The antiemetic medications can block the binding site on a chemoreceptor in the CTZ, so that the emetic agent cannot bind to it to cause its emetic effects. Another way that antiemetic medications can work is by binding to a chemoreceptor in the CTZ, but instead of initiate vomiting, the medication can cause the receptors to send signals to the other parts of the vomiting center that inhibit emesis. Also, some anti-emetic medications work by lowering the amount of dopamine levels in the brain, which in turn effects how much dopamine comes in contact with dopamine receptors in the CTZ. Other antiemetic medications work similarly by lowering a different substance in the brain that is known to interact with chemoreceptors in the CTZ that cause emesis. Antiemetic drugs coupled with pain relieving medications Oftentimes, doctors will \\"pre-treat\\" patients who might exhibit emetic responses due to drugs they prescribe them. Usually pain relieving drugs such as opioids are co-prescribed with anti- emetic drugs to stop the emetic response due to the pain reliever before it can even mediate its effects on the CTZ. This way, the patient does not have to worry about the doctors prescription to treat their pain causing them to be in severe discomfort via vomiting. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a major cause of emesis, and often can cause severe and frequent emetic responses. This is because chemotherapy agents circulating in the blood activate the CTZ in such a way as to cause emesis. Patients receiving chemotherapy are often prescribed antiemetic medications.

It is a port of a game originally released for the Sharp X68000 home computer in 1993 as Castlevania. The Castlevania Chronicles port adds a number of features, including an Arranged Mode. Castlevania Chronicles is a remake of the original Castlevania for the Nintendo Entertainment System, where the vampire hunter Simon Belmont must defeat Dracula and save Transylvania. It was made available for download via the PlayStation Network as a PSone Classic on December 18, 2008. Gameplay Castlevania (X68000) is a game based on Castlevania, with a new engine designed to take advantage of the Sharp X68000 hardware. The game is updated, including familiar stages that have been redesigned, as well as new stages altogether. It contains all of the special items and sub-weapons from the original game, as well as a rare item known as the herb, which refills six health blocks for 10 hearts. Castlevania Chronicles is notable for its high difficulty level. Like the original Castlevania game, hidden items worth points and hidden 1-ups will appear throughout the game if the player ducks or stands in particular portions of a level. Another notable feature is the multiple loops after the game is completed. Previous Castlevania games had increased difficulty for the game's second playthrough. An increased amount of damage taken from enemies in earlier levels as well as new enemy placement and attack patterns were just a few things to make the second playthrough more difficult. This game, however, has as many as six additional playthroughs with each one becoming much more difficult than the last. Completing \\"Arrange Mode\\" unlocks special features including an art gallery as well as a \\"Time Attack Mode\\". Exclusive to the U.S. and European versions of Chronicles, the art gallery features artwork by Ayami Kojima for Chronicles and Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, as well as an interview with Koji Igarashi (IGA). The \\"Time Attack Mode\\" allows the player to race through any stage, complete with a time meter, to beat their best time. Audio The music for the X68000 game contains a variety of new arrangements of familiar tunes from the series as well as brand new compositions altogether. Before each game, the player is given a choice between three different sound modules: the X68000's FM Synthesizer, MIDI Roland LA (MT-32, CM-32L, CM-64) and MIDI Roland GS (SC-55, SC-33, SC-155, CM-300, CM-500). There is also a hidden General MIDI sound module option that is missing in Castlevania Chronicles. While the soundtrack will remain the same throughout the game regardless of which sound module is chosen, the instrumentation may vary and some songs will be arranged slightly differently. S≈çta Fujimori, staff composer for the Konami Corporation in Japan, performed all new arrangements of the soundtrack for Castlevania Chronicles' \\"Arrange Mode\\". In the Japanese Chronicles, unlike the US and European versions, the sound hardware selection screen automatically appears before starting a game on \\"Original Mode\\" just as it did in Castlevania (X68000). A code must be entered to reach it in either mode in the U.S. and European versions, while the Japanese version only requires one to be entered in \\"Arrange Mode\\". Audio- wise, the Japanese version of Chronicles had slowdown issues with the music playback. These were fixed for the U.S. and European releases. Development The PlayStation re-release, Castlevania Chronicles, expanded much more to the X68000 game. This includes a new rendered intro and ending, with new character designs by Ayami Kojima for Simon Belmont and Dracula, improved graphical effects, enhanced music and sound effects, and a more balanced and adjustable difficulty level. Players can choose to play this \\"Arrange Mode\\" version of the game with all of the new features intact, or play the \\"Original Mode\\" version as it was originally presented on the Sharp X68000. While the \\"Original Mode\\" presented on Chronicles is otherwise identical to the X68000 game, there are a few limitations since it is emulated on different hardware. One noticeable difference is the brief loading times that now appear before boss fights and stages. The other drawback is the lack of an internal clock on the PlayStation. The original game utilized the X68000's internal time and date settings; the time on the clock tower during the boss fight on stage 15 would reflect the X68000's current time and the color scheme used on the painting in stage 21 would reflect one of the four seasons according to the computer's current date. On the PlayStation game, each time the system is turned on, the time and date have to be manually adjusted only after a hidden \\"Extra Option\\" menu is accessed by inputting an altered version of the Konami Code. Reception Castlevania Chronicles has been met with positive reviews. IGN rated the PlayStation release 7.8, saying it was \\"a lot of fun\\". GameSpot gave that same release a 6.1, saying it lacked replay value and was graphically outdated. Game Informers Tim Turi felt that it wasn't the worst option for people who wanted a classic Castlevania. Scott Steinberg reviewed the PlayStation version of the game for Next Generation, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \\"Grade-A smack for Castlevania collectors, and a damn fine experiment in classic gaming for everyone else.\\" NotesReferences Category:1993 video games Chronicles Category:PlayStation Network games Category:PlayStation (console) games Category:Sharp X68000 games Category:Video game remakes Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games scored by Taro Kudo Category:Platform games Category:Single-player video games ","title":"Castlevania Chronicles"},{"id":"1487827","title":"USS Makin Island (LHD-8)"},{"id":"1487828","text":"The Solentiname Islands () are an archipelago towards the southern end of Lake Nicaragua (also known as Lake Cocibolca) in the Nicaraguan department of R√≠o San Juan. They are made up of four larger islands, each a few kilometres across, named, from west to east, Mancarroncito, Mancarr√≥n, San Fernando and La Venada, along with some 32 smaller islands with rocky headlands which afford shelter to numerous aquatic birds. The islands‚Äô origins are volcanic. The highest point in the islands is found on Mancarr√≥n; it is above sea level. The Solentiname Islands are a National Monument. They constitute one of the 78 protected areas of Nicaragua. History There is some confusion over what the archipelago's name means. Some hold that it is from a Nahuatl word that means \\"covey of quail\\", and others say that it comes from the Nahuatl word Celentinametl, which means \\"place of many guests\\". The latter opinion is found in the majority of sources. Geography The Solentiname Islands are tropical in every sense. They are covered in tropical tree species, transitional between wet and dry tropical, and are home to various colourful bird species, including various kinds of parrot and toucans; there are 76 species in all. The waters about the islands contain plentiful fish. There are about 46 species, including tarpon, freshwater sharks, sawfish, and swordfish. The island of La Venada is known for its deer, and also named for them (La Venada is Spanish for \\"The Doe\\"). The yearly rainfall in the islands measures between , with most of it falling between May and December. Solentiname's mean yearly temperature is . The islands‚Äô tranquility and colourfulness are likely what has attracted artists to their shores. Painters and woodcarvers share the islands with farmers and fishermen. The archipelago's population is less than 1000, and its land area is about . Modern amenities, including electricity and running water, are quite rare in the islands. Mancarr√≥n is Solentiname's largest island. It is here that the priest and poet Ernesto Cardenal‚Äôs historical parish is to be found. Father Cardenal arrived in the islands in 1966 and is known for establishing a communal society for artists in the early 1970s which persists to this day. The community developed its own na√Øve art movement based on existing folk forms, and with some help from painter R√≥ger P√©rez de la Rocha. There is a small art gallery where the craftsmen and painters display their works: birds, mobiles featuring the local fauna carved out of balsawood, as well as much sought-after colourful primitivist Solentiname paintings, largely inspired by the islands‚Äô rich wildlife and plant species. Painters resident at the art colony included Asilia Guill√©n. Tourism and economy For these very things, the Solentiname Islands have also been the object of ecotourism in recent years, although currently, they are still a somewhat obscure destination. However, there are now three hotels in the islands, two of which are quite new. There are also important archaeological sites (including petroglyphs on San Fernando featuring images of parrots, monkeys, and people), the Los Guatuzos Wildlife Refuge, a marsh parallel to the lakeshore, home to both monkeys and alligators, and the Solentiname National Monument, which consists of the islands themselves and the lakeshores around them. Solentiname Islands Solentiname's agricultural products include avocado, cotton, sesame, corn, coffee and cacao. Parts of the story \\"Apocalipsis de Solentiname\\" by Julio Cort√°zar are set on the Solentiname Islands. The story features Ernesto Cardenal as a character, as well as the community's small art gallery.

Most notably, GRP stimulates the release of gastrin from the G cells of the stomach. The gene from which GRP is derived encodes a number of bombesin-like peptides. Its 148-amino acid preproprotein, following cleavage of a signal peptide, is further processed to produce either the 27-amino acid gastrin-releasing peptide or the 10-amino acid neuromedin C. These smaller peptides regulate numerous functions of the gastrointestinal and central nervous systems, including release of gastrointestinal hormones, smooth muscle cell contraction, and epithelial cell proliferation.  Function  Gastrin-releasing peptide is a regulatory human peptide that elicits gastrin release and regulates gastric acid secretion and enteric motor function. The post-ganglionic fibers of the vagus nerve that innervate the G cells of the stomach release GRP, which stimulates the G cells to release gastrin. GRP is also involved in the biology of the circadian system, playing a role in the signaling of light to the master circadian oscillator in the suprachiasmatic nuclei of the hypothalamus. Furthermore, GRP seems to mediate certain aspects of stress. This is the reason for the observed fact that atropine does not block the vagal effect on gastrin release.  Gene  The human GRP gene is located on chromosome 18q21. PreproGRP (the unprocessed form of GRP) is encoded in three exons separated by two introns. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.  Synthesis  PreproGRP begins with signal peptidase cleavage to generate the proGRP, which is then processed (by proteolytic cleavages), to form smaller GRP peptides. These smaller peptides are released by the post- ganglionic fibers of the vagus nerve, which innervate the G cells of the stomach and stimulate them to release gastrin. GRP regulates numerous functions of the gastrointestinal and central nervous systems, including release of gastrointestinal hormones, smooth muscle cell contraction, and epithelial cell proliferation.  Clinical significance  Gastrin-releasing peptide and neuromedin C, it is postulated, play a role in human cancers of the lung, colon, stomach, pancreas, breast, and prostate.

The park takes its name from the Latin name for Newfoundland; it is also the original Portuguese name given to the region.Hamilton, William B. (1978): The Macmillan book of Canadian place names, Macmillan of Canada, Toronto, p. 105. Terra Nova's landscape is typical of the northeast coast of Newfoundland, but with remnants of the Appalachian Mountains contributing to widely varied and rugged topography throughout the region. The park's seacoast consists of several rocky \\"fingers\\" jutting into Bonavista Bay along an area stretching from just north of Port Blandford to the vicinity of Glovertown. The coastline varies from cliffs and exposed headlands to sheltered inlets and coves, contributing to Newfoundland's prime recreational boating area. Inland areas consist of rolling forested hills, exposed rock faces, and bogs, ponds and wetlands. Wildlife protected by the park range from small to large land mammals, migratory birds, and various marine life. Terra Nova also protects an area containing remnants of the Beothuk Nation, as well as many of the early pioneer European settlements in the region. Terra Nova National Park was established in 1957 and was the first National Park in Newfoundland and Labrador. Terra Nova protects the Eastern Island Boreal Forest natural region. This region covers most of the island of Newfoundland, east of Deer Lake, and is characterized by black spruce trees with pockets of balsam fir, white pine, mountain ash, tamarack, maple and other deciduous tree species. Challenges Panorama seen from Ochre Hill Terra Nova, like many parks, has challenges in preserving its ecological integrity. Firstly, one of the mechanisms to renew a boreal forest ecosystem is forest fire - something that hasn't happened in the region in over 35 years. As a result, the forest of Terra Nova is mixed. It is mostly old growth forest with trees of roughly the 10‚Äì20 years of age. Forest fire renews the forest and creates new habitat for many boreal creatures. Another challenge facing Terra Nova is introduced species. Newfoundland suffers from \\"the island effect\\". Islands can have very different ecosystems than their mainland counterparts. For example, the island of Newfoundland only has 7 native mammals while neighboring Nova Scotia has over 63. Activities View from Ochre Hill View from Malady Head Visitor's Centre and dock There are two campgrounds that offer front country camping: Newman Sound and Malady Head. There are also a number of backcountry camping areas that you can hike, canoe or kayak to. There are many trails in the park of varying length and difficulty. The main visitor centre is located at Salton's Brook. During the summer there are a number of interpretive programs offered at Terra Nova. Almost every night there is a show at the Evening Theatre about the themes of the Park. Current shows include \\"Go With the Flo\\" and \\"Forest Idol.\\" Previous shows include \\"Forest Feud\\" and \\"The Broad Cove Bachelor\\". Once a week there is also a campfire program at the campfire circle where you can listen to some sounds of Newfoundland while sipping hot chocolate. There are also a number of interpretive hikes that cover themes such as introduced species, forest fire, species at risk, and edible plants. Other summer activities at the park include freshwater swimming and mountain biking. There are a number of activities for kids. One of the more popular programs is the Junior Naturalist Program where children get stamps towards becoming a junior naturalist. There is also a Graduate Naturalist Program where older children get a workbook with many fun activities to complete. Terra Nova also organizes and celebrates a number of special events. Some of the more popular include Canada Day (July 1), Kids day, Newfoundland and Labrador day, Take a Hike Day, Oceans Day (June 8). Winter activities at the park include winter camping, snowshoeing and cross-country skiing. Fauna Animals that inhabit this national park are coyotes, black bears, moose, caribou, black ducks, red foxes, beavers, bald eagles, red squirrels, river otters, lynxes, puffins, snowshoe hares, ospreys, pine martens, and minks. Marine animals that inhabit offshore are humpback whales, minke whales, fin whales, pilot whales, harp seals, orcas and dolphins. Geology The park resides in what is termed the Avalon Zone, named for the Avalon Peninsula, and associated with the Appalachian Orogen. The zone's western boundary is marked by the Dover Fault and the Hermitage Bay Fault. The eastern portion of the park is characterized by the Precambrian Connecting Point Group quartzite, slate, and greywacke. The Precambrian Musgraventown Group reddish sandstone, conglomerate, and argillite are exposed along the Trans Canada Highway, and westernmost portion of the park, sandwiching the Precambrian Love Cove Group sericite and chlorite schists. A Pleistocene ice cap flowed radially across the island, depositing glacial debris in the western part of the park.

It is the natural metric commonly used in a variety of calculations in hyperbolic geometry or Riemann surfaces. There are three equivalent representations commonly used in two-dimensional hyperbolic geometry. One is the Poincar√© half-plane model, defining a model of hyperbolic space on the upper half- plane. The Poincar√© disk model defines a model for hyperbolic space on the unit disk. The disk and the upper half plane are related by a conformal map, and isometries are given by M√∂bius transformations. A third representation is on the punctured disk, where relations for q-analogues are sometimes expressed. These various forms are reviewed below. Overview of metrics on Riemann surfaces A metric on the complex plane may be generally expressed in the form :ds^2=\\\\lambda^2(z,\\\\overline{z})\\\\, dz\\\\,d\\\\overline{z} where Œª is a real, positive function of z and \\\\overline{z}. The length of a curve Œ≥ in the complex plane is thus given by :l(\\\\gamma)=\\\\int_\\\\gamma \\\\lambda(z,\\\\overline{z})\\\\, dz The area of a subset of the complex plane is given by :\\\\text{Area}(M)=\\\\int_M \\\\lambda^2 (z,\\\\overline{z})\\\\,\\\\frac{i}{2}\\\\,dz \\\\wedge d\\\\overline{z} where \\\\wedge is the exterior product used to construct the volume form. The determinant of the metric is equal to \\\\lambda^4, so the square root of the determinant is \\\\lambda^2. The Euclidean volume form on the plane is dx\\\\wedge dy and so one has :dz \\\\wedge d\\\\overline{z}=(dx+i\\\\,dy)\\\\wedge (dx-i \\\\, dy)= -2i\\\\,dx\\\\wedge dy. A function \\\\Phi(z,\\\\overline{z}) is said to be the potential of the metric if :4\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial z} \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial \\\\overline{z}} \\\\Phi(z,\\\\overline{z})=\\\\lambda^2(z,\\\\overline{z}). The Laplace‚ÄìBeltrami operator is given by :\\\\Delta = \\\\frac{4}{\\\\lambda^2} \\\\frac {\\\\partial}{\\\\partial z} \\\\frac {\\\\partial}{\\\\partial \\\\overline{z}} = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\lambda^2} \\\\left( \\\\frac {\\\\partial^2}{\\\\partial x^2} + \\\\frac {\\\\partial^2}{\\\\partial y^2} \\\\right). The Gaussian curvature of the metric is given by :K=-\\\\Delta \\\\log \\\\lambda.\\\\, This curvature is one-half of the Ricci scalar curvature. Isometries preserve angles and arc-lengths. On Riemann surfaces, isometries are identical to changes of coordinate: that is, both the Laplace‚ÄìBeltrami operator and the curvature are invariant under isometries. Thus, for example, let S be a Riemann surface with metric \\\\lambda^2(z,\\\\overline{z})\\\\, dz \\\\, d\\\\overline{z} and T be a Riemann surface with metric \\\\mu^2(w,\\\\overline{w})\\\\, dw\\\\,d\\\\overline{w}. Then a map :f:S\\\\to T\\\\, with f=w(z) is an isometry if and only if it is conformal and if :\\\\mu^2(w,\\\\overline{w}) \\\\; \\\\frac {\\\\partial w}{\\\\partial z} \\\\frac {\\\\partial \\\\overline {w}} {\\\\partial \\\\overline {z}} = \\\\lambda^2 (z, \\\\overline {z}) . Here, the requirement that the map is conformal is nothing more than the statement :w(z,\\\\overline{z})=w(z), that is, :\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial \\\\overline{z}} w(z) = 0. Metric and volume element on the Poincar√© plane The Poincar√© metric tensor in the Poincar√© half-plane model is given on the upper half-plane H as :ds^2=\\\\frac{dx^2+dy^2}{y^2}=\\\\frac{dz \\\\, d\\\\overline{z}}{y^2} where we write dz=dx+i\\\\,dy. This metric tensor is invariant under the action of SL(2,R). That is, if we write :z'=x'+iy'=\\\\frac{az+b}{cz+d} for ad-bc=1 then we can work out that :x'=\\\\frac{ac(x^2+y^2)+x(ad+bc)+bd}{cz+d^2} and :y'=\\\\frac{y}{cz+d^2}. The infinitesimal transforms as :dz'=\\\\frac{dz}{(cz+d)^2} and so :dz'd\\\\overline{z}' = \\\\frac{dz\\\\,d\\\\overline{z}}{cz+d^4} thus making it clear that the metric tensor is invariant under SL(2,R). The invariant volume element is given by :d\\\\mu=\\\\frac{dx\\\\,dy}{y^2}. The metric is given by :\\\\rho(z_1,z_2)=2\\\\tanh^{-1}\\\\frac{z_1-z_2}{z_1-\\\\overline{z_2}} :\\\\rho(z_1,z_2)=\\\\log\\\\frac{z_1-\\\\overline{z_2}+z_1-z_2}{z_1-\\\\overline{z_2}-z_1-z_2} for z_1,z_2 \\\\in \\\\mathbb{H}. Another interesting form of the metric can be given in terms of the cross-ratio. Given any four points z_1, z_2, z_3 and z_4 in the compactified complex plane \\\\hat{\\\\Complex} = \\\\Complex \\\\cup {\\\\infty}, the cross-ratio is defined by :(z_1, z_2; z_3, z_4) = \\\\frac{(z_1-z_3)(z_2-z_4)}{(z_1-z_4)(z_2-z_3)}. Then the metric is given by : \\\\rho(z_1,z_2)= \\\\log \\\\left (z_1, z_2; z_1^\\\\times, z_2^\\\\times \\\\right ). Here, z_1^\\\\times and z_2^\\\\times are the endpoints, on the real number line, of the geodesic joining z_1 and z_2. These are numbered so that z_1 lies in between z_1^\\\\times and z_2. The geodesics for this metric tensor are circular arcs perpendicular to the real axis (half-circles whose origin is on the real axis) and straight vertical lines ending on the real axis. Conformal map of plane to disk The upper half plane can be mapped conformally to the unit disk with the M√∂bius transformation :w=e^{i\\\\phi}\\\\frac{z-z_0}{z-\\\\overline {z_0}} where w is the point on the unit disk that corresponds to the point z in the upper half plane. In this mapping, the constant z0 can be any point in the upper half plane; it will be mapped to the center of the disk. The real axis \\\\Im z =0 maps to the edge of the unit disk w=1. The constant real number \\\\phi can be used to rotate the disk by an arbitrary fixed amount. The canonical mapping is :w=\\\\frac{iz+1}{z+i} which takes i to the center of the disk, and 0 to the bottom of the disk. Metric and volume element on the Poincar√© disk The Poincar√© metric tensor in the Poincar√© disk model is given on the open unit disk :U= \\\\left {z=x+iy:z=\\\\sqrt{x^2+y^2} < 1 \\\\right } by :ds^2=\\\\frac{4(dx^2+dy^2)}{(1-(x^2+y^2))^2}=\\\\frac{4 dz\\\\,d\\\\overline{z}}{(1-z^2)^2}. The volume element is given by :d\\\\mu=\\\\frac{4 dx\\\\,dy}{(1-(x^2+y^2))^2}=\\\\frac{4 dx\\\\,dy}{(1-z^2)^2}. The Poincar√© metric is given by :\\\\rho(z_1,z_2)=2\\\\tanh^{-1}\\\\left\\\\frac{z_1-z_2}{1-z_1\\\\overline{z_2}}\\\\right for z_1,z_2 \\\\in U. The geodesics for this metric tensor are circular arcs whose endpoints are orthogonal to the boundary of the disk. Geodesic flows on the Poincar√© disk are Anosov flows; that article develops the notation for such flows. The punctured disk model J-invariant in punctured disk coordinates; that is, as a function of the nome. J-invariant in Poincare disk coordinates; note this disk is rotated by 90 degrees from canonical coordinates given in this article A second common mapping of the upper half-plane to a disk is the q-mapping :q=\\\\exp(i\\\\pi\\\\tau) where q is the nome and œÑ is the half-period ratio: : \\\\tau = \\\\frac{\\\\omega_2}{\\\\omega_1} . In the notation of the previous sections, œÑ is the coordinate in the upper half-plane \\\\Im \\\\tau >0. The mapping is to the punctured disk, because the value q=0 is not in the image of the map. The Poincar√© metric on the upper half-plane induces a metric on the q-disk :ds^2=\\\\frac{4}{q^2 (\\\\log q^2)^2} dq \\\\, d\\\\overline{q} The potential of the metric is :\\\\Phi(q,\\\\overline{q})=4 \\\\log \\\\log q^{-2} Schwarz lemma The Poincar√© metric is distance-decreasing on harmonic functions. This is an extension of the Schwarz lemma, called the Schwarz‚ÄìAhlfors‚ÄìPick theorem.

Isolecithal cells have two equal hemispheres of yolk. However, during cellular development, normally under the influence of gravity, some of the yolk settles to the bottom of the egg, producing an uneven distribution of yolky hemispheres. Such uneven cells are known as telolecithal and are common where there is sufficient yolk mass. In the absence of a large concentration of yolk, four major cleavage types can be observed in isolecithal cells: radial holoblastic, spiral holoblastic, bilateral holoblastic, and rotational holoblastic cleavage. These holoblastic cleavage planes pass all the way through isolecithal zygotes during the process of cytokinesis. Coeloblastula is the next stage of development for eggs that undergo this radial cleavaging. In mammals, because the isolecithal cells have only a small amount of yolk, they require immediate implantation onto the uterine wall to receive nutrients.

The fraternity is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization incorporated in the state of Pennsylvania, with the purpose of fostering the ideals of scholarship, leadership, and fellowship. Phi Sigma Pi is organized into approximately one hundred and forty collegiate chapters at four-year collegiate institutions and several regionally established alumni chapters and associations serving approximately 50,000 brothers. Although collegiate chapters may fall under the purview of university student governing bodies, Phi Sigma Pi maintains no affiliation with the North American Interfraternity Conference.  Membership  Membership in Phi Sigma Pi is open to students at four-year collegiate institutions who have earned a 3.0 cumulative grade point average (on a 4.00 scale, where 4.00 is equivalent to a grade of \\"A\\") for at least one semester or quarter of collegiate work. Individual Chapters can raise this requirement, for example to a 3.25, but they cannot lower it. However, receiving a bid is competitive, as only a handful are accepted each semester, so meeting the GPA requirement will not guarantee membership.  History  Phi Sigma Pi was founded at State Teachers College at Warrensburg ‚Äì now known as University of Central Missouri ‚Äì on February 14, 1916, by Dr. Eldo L. Hendricks, Dr. Claude A. Phillips, and Dr. Clarence H. McClure. The fraternity became national in 1921 when a Third chapter was founded at Bradley University in Peoria, Illinois. The fraternity has since evolved from an honorary professional fraternity to a professional education fraternity, and then, in 1966, to an honor fraternity for all disciplines. Phi Sigma Pi became coeducational in 1977.  Phi Sigma Pi Formation  Hendricks, Phillips and McClure contacted Phi Beta Kappa and requested permission to establish a chapter. Phi Beta Kappa policy stated that chapters could only be established on campuses of qualified liberal arts colleges and universities, since Warrensburg did not meet this requirement the founding of a chapter was not possible. The Omicron Delta Kappa was also contacted. Omicron Delta Kappa had the same requirements for chapter establishment as Phi Beta Kappa; therefore Warrensburg could not have a chapter. The three also contacted other nationally recognized social fraternities stressing fellowship. They received the same answer. Since no fraternity that would set up a chapter in Warrensburg could be found by Hendricks, Phillips and McClure they founded a new one. On February 14, 1916 Phi Sigma Pi was founded and officially named \\"Phi Sigma Pi Honorary Professional Fraternity\\". Dr. Hendricks was the first person to sign a Phi Sigma Pi rollbook and is therefore known as \\"Alpha 1\\". Dean Phillips' and Professor McClure's signatures follow Hendricks'. Together, Hendricks, Phillips and McClure are known as the founding fathers of the fraternity. The first chapter also consisted of ten undergraduate and honorary members: Fred Thayer, J. A. Leach, R. W. Grinstead, Ray F. Pankins, Wade C. Fowler, Roy G. Bigelow, Arthur Kresse, John A. Doak, Harold Patterson, and Harry Hill. In the next year the chapter inducted twelve new members.  The War Years (1942‚Äì1975)  Due to World War II, all fifteen chapters went inactive in late 1942. Many schools had such low enrollments, that the state legislatures considered closing them permanently. The war also prevented the 1943 Grand Chapter Convention, where the election of new National Officers would have taken place. It was agreed that the current officers would guide the fraternity and its ultimate reorganization until the next Grand Chapter meeting could be held. By the fall of 1946, all but one of the chapters prior to the war were reactivated with the exception of Mu Chapter at State Teachers College, Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania. However, as history would show, it would take decades for the fraternity to recover the momentum that it had gained throughout the 1920s and 30s. Since the fraternity had gone national in 1921, the leaders at the national level had been faculty advisors of the chapters and active alumni. By 1950, not only was contact with alumni critically affected due to the war, but the faculty advisors who guided the fraternity through most of the previous two decades were ready to retire. By 1954, Clair B. Wilson, James M. McCallister, Alpha 33, James K. Stoner, and long time Regional Director Simon S. Shearer, Omicron 20, were gone. Death claimed Beecher Flanagan in 1950 and Sanders P. McComsey, Sigma 17, in 1955. The Regional Director system was retired in order to utilize the leadership of the National Officer positions. Also at this time, The Lampadion ceased publication, leaving the Purple & Gold as the sole communication between the chapters and the National Office. However, at the close of the decade the fraternity was incorporated nationally in Illinois on April 25, 1949. In what was a critical time in Phi Sigma Pi's history, the fraternity was in need of new leadership as the old guard retired‚Äîand it happened. Two of the fraternity's most dedicated National Officers emerged from this era‚Äînamely, Joseph Torchia, Sigma 296, and Richard C. Todd, Sigma 58 and Tau 878. Their leadership and commitment to Phi Sigma Pi carried the fraternity through the next two decades serving in multiple capacities. Torchia was employed at his alma mater as an associate professor of education from 1946 to 1975. Constantly reprising his role as teacher, Torchia did extensive tutoring, including teaching speed reading to individuals and business groups. The Outstanding Chapter Award was created in 1957 and then renamed the Joseph Torchia Outstanding Chapter Award in 1970 to honor Mr. Torchia for his many contributions to Phi Sigma Pi over the course of four decades. As for Dr. Richard Todd, perhaps no man devoted his time and energy to Phi Sigma Pi as much as he had to this point in history. \\"He certainly would fit your mental image of an old-fashioned gentleman,\\" stated past National President Jack Thornton, Tau 862. \\"He and \\"Sweetheart\\" (term of endearment given to wife Clauda Pennock Todd by Dr. Todd) could not have children, instead, every Brother of Tau Chapter became one of their kids. They were always good for a meal, a place to wash and dry clothes, a place to sleep, a few bucks for bus fare home‚Äîwhatever was needed. Usually, the Brothers tried to pay them back, but the Todd's would insist that they do the same for someone else in need.\\" Dr. Todd served as the Tau Chapter advisor for many years, and held virtually every officer position on the National Council. At East Carolina University, Todd was an outstanding history professor and advisor to many undergraduate organizations. Dr. Todd and his wife \\"Sweetheart\\" would establish several scholarships, including Phi Sigma Pi's Richard C. Todd & Clauda Pennock Todd Tripod Scholarship. Todd is described on the East Carolina University website as, \\"‚Ä¶one of the department's most caring and generous professors.\\" With the assistance of Henry W. Olsen, Rho 98; Leroy G. Pulver, Pi 27; Perry McCandless, Alpha 384; and Abram Foster, Sigma 340, Todd and Torchia led the fraternity to the realization that while the fraternity was stable, stagnation was setting in. At the October 1, 1966, Grand Chapter Convention, held in Washington D.C., President Abram Foster said, \\"We have remained stagnant and this is not good. We are losing the opportunity to spread the purposes of Phi Sigma Pi. We must act.\\" At the time, colleges and universities were openly discouraging social fraternities, while promoting honor organizations and scholarship. Seeing that Phi Sigma Pi had always placed exceptional emphasis on scholarship ‚Äì the premise being that good teachers were also good scholars ‚Äì it was suggested that an honor fraternity which stressed scholarship, leadership, and fellowship would preserve the tripod, while creating new opportunities for expansion.  Phi Sigma Pi's Tripod  Phi Sigma Pi's Tripod is explained as: > 1\\\\. The acquisition and dissemination of information and knowledge through > scholarship, 2\\\\. The application of professional skills and the fostering of > leadership qualities by promoting and advancing the welfare of humanity, 3\\\\. > The fostering of non-discriminatory, fraternal fellowship within Phi Sigma > Pi's ranks. Phi Sigma Pi shall constantly endeavor to make these ideals > dynamic in the lives of Phi Sigma Pi's Members. These ideals are often referred to in their abbreviated form: Scholarship, Leadership, and Fellowship.  Publications and Insignia  The fraternity publishes the Purple and Gold magazine for collegiate members and The Lampadion for alumni. Phi Sigma Pi provides an identifying jewel, available to members. The badge is a monogram of the letters Œ¶Œ£Œ† linked diagonally. The Phi may be enhanced with pearls. The Centennial badge allowed for contrasting purple stones on the center stroke of the Phi. Distinguished service keys bearing the coat of arms are awarded to chapter presidents and secretaries who perform their duties faithfully and efficiently by the Grand Chapter. The fraternity's colors are purple and gold.  Philanthropy  The former national philanthropy of Phi Sigma Pi was Teach For America National Philanthropy. Teach For America is the national corps of outstanding recent college graduates who commit two years to teach in urban and rural public schools. Their mission is to build the movement to eliminate educational inequity by enlisting some of our nation's most promising future leaders in the effort. Since 2007, the Chapters of Phi Sigma Pi have collectively donated $67,104.47 and sent 672 to Teach for America regions and schools. In the National Conference of 2014, Phi Sigma Pi decided to drop Teach For America as its national philanthropy in order to pursue greater invested interests in the fields of Education and Public Service. The organization does still support Teach for America but a re-shifting of focus into other pursuits with a strong emphasis on the ideals of Fellowship, Leadership and Scholarship. At the 2014 Grand Chapter Meeting a motion was passed to explore new philanthropic initiatives. Since Phi Sigma Pi‚Äôs history is rooted in the field of education it is encouraged to continue our Founders initiatives during this exploration year. Phi Sigma Pi Members and Chapters can consider supporting: organizations that support under-served schools Brothers who serve as educators local school systems At the 2015 Grand Chapter Meeting, the Vice President of Philanthropy Development provided the Grand Chapter with potential philanthropic partnerships for consideration. They approved a motion allowing the organization to start discussions with Hugh O'Brian Youth Leadership Foundation (HOBY) about a possible partnership. At the 2017 Grand Chapter Meeting, the Vice President of Philanthropy Development made a motion to make Hugh O'Brian Youth Leadership Foundation (HOBY) Phi Sigma Pi's National Philanthropy. The grand chapter voted and passed the motion.  Scholarships = The Richard Cecil Todd and Clauda Pennock Todd Tripod Scholarship  In September 1991, Dr. and Mrs. Richard Todd established the Richard Cecil Todd and Clauda Pennock Todd Tripod Scholarship to promote the future academic opportunity of Phi Sigma Pi brothers who have excelled in embodying the ideals of scholarship, leadership, and fellowship. While both Dr. and Mrs. Todd had died in the 1990s, their memory and innumerable contribution to both Phi Sigma Pi and education will not be forgotten. Eligibility for the Todd Tripod Scholarship is available to all active undergraduate members of Phi Sigma Pi who meet the criteria outlined in the scholarship's charter and award criteria. For the past several years chapter members have been contributing to the Todd Tripod Scholarship. One example of this generosity is through the \\"Miles for Todd\\" campaign. Grand Chapter Conference Delegates have been donating their chapter's mileage reimbursement to have the scholarship to flourish.  Rolla F. Wood Graduate Scholarship  In 1928, Rolla F. Wood became national president, and with his tenure came changes to the brotherhood. Wood made the National Council a more cohesive unit and helped increase expansion. The fraternity grew from four chapters to seven during his presidential term. Following his successful term Wood exemplified true brotherly dedication in ways many don't‚Äîhe continued to serve. He went on to volunteer as part of council for the next six years as vice-president of chapter development (formerly national counselor) for a year, senior vice- president for a year and historian from 1931 through 1935. During his years on council, his push for expansion resulted in a total of 14 new chapters joining the original four. Wood, a brother at Alpha chapter, attended graduate school at Vanderbilt University, where he founded Epsilon Chapter. In honor of Wood's national contributions, dedication and continued pursuit of knowledge, the fraternity now has its graduate scholarship named for him.  Lloyd G. Balfour Fellowships  This program, established in 1985 in honor of Lloyd G. Balfour of Sigma Chi Fraternity, awards financial assistance to full-time students who are enrolled in accredited graduate or professional schools. To be eligible, applicants must be initiated members in good standing of an NIC, NPC, NPHC, or PFA organization. Recipients are determined by consideration of GPA (3.2 minimum), campus and community involvement, and leadership within one's fraternity/sorority.

GDK lies between the display server and the GTK library, handling basic rendering such as drawing primitives, raster graphics (bitmaps), cursors, fonts, as well as window events and drag-and-drop functionality. Like GTK Scene Graph Kit (GSK), GDK is part of GTK and licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL). Software architecture GDK contains back-ends to X11, Wayland, Broadway (HTTP), Quartz and GDI and relies on Cairo for the rendering. Its new scene graph (canvas) is work-in-progress, its arrival should herald GTK 4.0. GTK is implemented on top of an abstraction layer called GDK, freeing GTK from low-level concerns like input gathering, Drag and drop and pixel format conversion. GDK is an intermediate layer which separates GTK from the details of the windowing system. GDK is an important part of GTK's portability. Since low-level cross-platform functionality is already provided by GLib, all that is needed to make GTK run on other platforms is to port GDK to the underlying operating system's graphics layer. Hence, the GDK ports to the Windows API and Quartz are what enable GTK applications to run on Windows and macOS, respectively. Starting with GTK+ 2.8, GDK supports Cairo which should be used with GTK+ 3 instead of GDK's drawing functions.Migrating from GTK+ 2.x to GTK+ 3 - Use cairo for drawing GDK is an intermediate layer which isolates GTK from the details of the windowing system. GDK is a thin wrapper around Xlib. The X Window System comes with a low-level library called Xlib. Almost every function in GDK is a very thin wrapper around a corresponding Xlib function; but some of the complexity (and functionality) of Xlib is hidden, to simplify programming and to make GDK easier to port to other windowing systems, such as Wayland or Microsoft Windows. The concealed Xlib functionality will rarely be of interest to application programmers; for example, many features used solely by window managers are not exposed in GDK. GDK lets you do low level stuff, like e.g. \\"blit this pixmap to the screen\\". GDK provides a layer that is much more portable than say the X protocol, without sacrificing any of the low-level accessibility that systems such as X provide. The true power of this abstraction is that if you choose to use it rather than say, X, your software will automatically render on the Linux Framebuffer and Windows. Having OpenGL (or OpenGL ES) support in GDK, facilitates a slightly better control of the graphics pipeline; OpenGL is well suited for compositing textured data but totally unsuited for drawing. GdkFrameClock GdkFrameClock was added in GTK 3.8 While GTK applications remain mainloop driven (cf. Glib event loop), meaning the application is idle inside this main loop most of the time and just waits for something to happen and then calls the appropriate subroutine when it does, GdkFrameClock adds an additional mechanism, that gives a \\"pulse\\" to the application. It tells the application when to update and repaint a window. The beat rate can be synchronized with the monitor refresh rate. GTK Scene Graph Kit In its history GDK contained and linked with a couple of different Canvases. * https://wiki.gnome.org/Attic/ProjectRidley/CanvasOverview ** https://wiki.gnome.org/Attic/ProjectRidley/CanvasOverview/Canvases * https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GooCanvas Developers were also considering new directions for the library, including removing deprecated API components and adding an integrated scene graph (canvas) system, similar to the Clutter graphics library, effectively integrating GTK with OpenGL and Vulkan.Alberto Ruiz's BlogHavoc Pennington's scene graph proposal * GTK Scene Graph Kit (GSK) GTK+ Scene Graph Kit (GSK) was released as part of GTK+ 3.90 in March 2017. It is the scene graph and rendering API for GTK. GSK has not been further integrated with GDK (which is also part of GTK) but is kept in its own directory. Windowing systems GDK contains back-ends to a couple of windowing systems, namely to the X11 and Wayland protocols, to Quartz and GDI, and even to the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) engine Broadway. With the release of GNOME 3.16 in March 2015, GDK obtained an experimental back-end for the Mir display server protocol. The Mir display server protocol is a product by Canonical for their Ubuntu distribution of Linux, which they intend to compete with the Wayland display server protocol; so far, it is implemented only in Ubuntu. At present, no back-end exists for KMS. To start an application and force this instance of it to use a certain windowing system, you specify the variable GDK_BACKEND: \`GDK_BACKEND=wayland gnome-calculator\` \`GDK_BACKEND=wayland CLUTTER_BACKEND=wayland cheese\` gdk-pixbuf gdk-pixbuf is a toolkit for image loading and pixel buffer manipulation. The library provides image loading and saving facilities, fast scaling and compositing of pixbufs, simple animation loading (i.e. animated GIFs), and rendering the libart image buffer to a GdkDrawable instance. gdk-pixbuf has a fairly large API. The fundamental structure in the gdk-pixbuf library is GdkPixbuf, a private, opaque data structure that mirrors many of the same concepts that ArtPixBuf supports. In fact, most of GdkPixbuf's private data fields have the same names and data types as the corresponding ones in ArtPixBuf. This similarity dates back to the earlier days when gdk-pixbuf was a wrapper around libart. Since that time, the libart dependency has been stripped out, and gdk- pixbuf was merged into the GTK+ 2.0 code base. As such, gdk-pixbuf's days as a standalone library are limited to the GNOME 1.x release. With the release of GTK+ 2.22 on 2010-09-23, gdk-pixbuf has been turned back into a standalone library, after being shipped as part of GTK+ since gtk+ 2.0. This was done in preparation for the transition to GTK+ 3. * https://git.gnome.org/browse/gdk- pixbuf/ The first stand-alone release was 2.22 on 2010-Sep-21, its development started with 2.21.3 on 2010-06-23. The latest release of gdk-pixbuf is gdk- pixbuf 2.36.11 from 2017-Oct-02. The development of 3.36 started with 3.35.1 on 2016-04-26.

Built in AD 224 by King Ardashir I of the Sassanian Empire, it is located two kilometers (1.2 miles) north of the ancient city of Gor, i.e. the old city of Artakhsher Khwarah/Khor Adashir/Gor Adesheer (Glory of [king] Ardasher) in Pars, in ancient Persia (Iran). The ancient city where the palace is located, was renamed \\"Peroz\\" (lit. victorious) after Ardashir established the Sassanian Empire by overthrowing Ardavan, the last Parthian king. After the Arabian conquest, Peroz was called Firuz, and the name remained. The modern city of Firuzabad is hence, of important significance in Persian history. Description Exterior elevation, Palace of Ardashir, at Sarvestan 1905 Interior elevation, Palace of Ardashir, 1905 The structure contains three domes, among other features, making it slightly larger and more magnificent than its predecessor, the nearby castle of Dezh Dokhtar. However, it seems that the compound was designed to display the royalty image of Ardashir I, rather than being a fortified structure for defense purposes. That is why perhaps it would be best to refer to the structure as a \\"palace\\" rather than a \\"castle\\", even though it has huge walls on the perimeters (twice as thick as Ghal'eh Dokhtar), and is a contained structure. From the architectural design, it seems the palace was more of a place of social gathering where guests would be introduced to the imperial throne. What is particularly interesting about this palace is that its architectural design does not exactly fall into that of the Parthians or even Sassanian category; the design is a unique design particular to architects of Fars. The palace was built next to a picturesque pond that was fed by a natural spring, perhaps in connection with the Persian goddess of water and growth, Anahita. The spring is thought to have fed a royal garden, in the same way that Cyrus had his garden (bustan) built at Pasargadae. The pond was tiled on its sides, surrounded by pavement for guests of the royal court to enjoy the evenings by. The structure is 104 m (340 ft) by 55 m (180 ft). The iwan is 18 m (60 ft) high, although it has partially collapsed. The structure was built of local rocks and mortar with plasterwork on the insides. The style of the interior design is comparable to that of Tachara palace at Persepolis. In modern times The Palace of Ardashir Jane Dieulafoy visited the site with her husband, Marcel-Auguste Dieulafoy, and described it in La Perse, la Chald√©e et la Susiane. Robert Byron was there in February 1934, and wrote about his visit in The Road to Oxiana. Byron considered the Palace to include the prototype of the squinch. In his view, buildings such as St. Peter's Basilica and the Taj Mahal would not have existed without the squinch and the pendentive. Iran has tentatively listed the Palace of Ardashir and other sites in and around Firouzabad as a possible UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1997.

VIP is a peptide of 28 amino acid residues that belongs to a glucagon/secretin superfamily, the ligand of class II G protein‚Äìcoupled receptors. VIP is produced in many tissues of vertebrates including the gut, pancreas, and suprachiasmatic nuclei of the hypothalamus in the brain. VIP stimulates contractility in the heart, causes vasodilation, increases glycogenolysis, lowers arterial blood pressure and relaxes the smooth muscle of trachea, stomach and gall bladder. In humans, the vasoactive intestinal peptide is encoded by the VIP gene. VIP has a half-life (t¬Ω) in the blood of about two minutes.  Function = In the body  VIP has an effect on several tissues: In the digestive system, VIP seems to induce smooth muscle relaxation (lower esophageal sphincter, stomach, gallbladder), stimulate secretion of water into pancreatic juice and bile, and cause inhibition of gastric acid secretion and absorption from the intestinal lumen. Its role in the intestine is to greatly stimulate secretion of water and electrolytes, as well as relaxation of enteric smooth muscle, dilating peripheral blood vessels, stimulating pancreatic bicarbonate secretion, and inhibiting gastrin- stimulated gastric acid secretion. These effects work together to increase motility. It also has the function of stimulating pepsinogen secretion by chief cells. VIP seems to be an important neuropeptide during inflammatory bowel diseases since the communication between mast cells and VIP in colitis, as in Crohn's disease, is upregulated. It is also found in the heart and has significant effects on the cardiovascular system. It causes coronary vasodilation as well as having a positive inotropic and chronotropic effect. Research is being performed to see if it may have a beneficial role in the treatment of heart failure. VIP provokes vaginal lubrication in normal women, doubling the total volume of lubrication produced.  In the brain  It is also found in the brain and some autonomic nerves: One region includes a specific area of the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), the location of the 'master circadian pacemaker'. See SCN and circadian rhythm below. VIP in the pituitary helps to regulate prolactin secretion; it stimulates prolactin release in the domestic turkey. Additionally, the growth-hormone-releasing hormone (GH-RH) is a member of the VIP family and stimulates growth hormone secretion in the anterior pituitary gland.  Mechanisms  VIP innervates on both VPAC1 and VPAC2. When VIP binds to VPAC2 receptors, a G-alpha-mediated signalling cascade is triggered. In a number of systems, VIP binding activates adenyl cyclase activity leading to increases in cAMP and PKA. The PKA then activates other intracellular signaling pathways like the phosphorylation of CREB and other transcriptional factors. The mPer1 promoter has CRE domains and thus provides the mechanism for VIP to regulate the molecular clock itself. Then it will activate gene expression pathways such as Per1 and Per2 in circadian rhythm. In addition, GABA levels are connected to VIP in that they are co- released. Sparse GABAergic connections are thought to decrease synchronized firing. While GABA controls the amplitude of SCN neuronal rhythms, it is not critical for maintaining synchrony. However, if GABA release is dynamic, it may mask or amplify synchronizing effects of VIP inappropriately. Circadian time is likely to affect the synapses rather than the organization of VIP circuits.  SCN and circadian rhythm  Suprachiasmatic nucleus is shown in green. The SCN coordinates daily timekeeping in the body and VIP plays a key role in communication between individual brain cells within this region. At a cellular level, the SCN expresses different electrical activity in circadian time. Higher activity is observed during the day, while during night there is lower activity. This rhythm is thought to be important feature of SCN to synchronize with each other and control rhythmicity in other regions. VIP acts as a major synchronizing agent among SCN neurons and plays a role in synchronizing the SCN with light cues. The high concentration of VIP and VIP receptor containing neurons are primarily found in the ventrolateral aspect of the SCN, which is also located above the optic chiasm. The neurons in this area receive retinal information from the retinohypothalamic tract and then relay the environmental information to the SCN. Further, VIP is also involved in synchronizing the timing of SCN function with the environmental light-dark cycle. Combined, these roles in the SCN make VIP a crucial component of the mammalian circadian timekeeping machinery. After finding evidence of VIP in the SCN, researchers began contemplating its role within the SCN and how it could affect circadian rhythm. The VIP also plays a pivotal role in modulating oscillations. Previous pharmacological research has established that VIP is needed for normal light-induced synchronization of the circadian systems. Application of VIP also phase shifts the circadian rhythm of vasopressin release and neural activity. The ability of the population to remain synchronized as well as the ability of single cells to generate oscillations is composed in VIP or VIP receptor deficient mice. While not highly studied, there is evidence that levels of VIP and its receptor may vary depending on each circadian oscillation. The leading hypothesis of VIP function points to the neurons using VIP to communicate with specific postsynaptic targets to regulate circadian rhythm. The depolarization of the VIP-expressing neurons by light appears to cause the release of VIP and co-transmitters (including GABA) that can in turn, alter the properties of the next set of neurons with the activation of VPAC2. Another hypothesis supports VIP sending a paracrine signal from a distance rather than the adjacent postsynaptic neuron.  Signaling pathway  In SCN, there is an abundant amount of VPAC2. The presence of VPAC2 in ventrolateral side suggests that VIP signals can actually signal back to regulate VIP secreting cells. SCN has neural multiple pathways to control and modulate endocrine activity. VIP and vasopressin are both important for neurons to relay information to different targets and affect neuroendocrine function. They transmit information through such relay nuclei as the SPZ (subparaventricular zone), DMH (dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus), MPOA (medial preoptic area) and PVN (paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus). Social behavior Ventromedial hypothalamus (VM), optic chiasm (OC), anterior pituitary (AP), and posterior pituitary (PP) are shown here. VIP neurons located in the hypothalamus, specifically the dorsal anterior hypothalamus and ventromedial hypothalamus, have an effect on social behaviors in many species of vertebrates. Studies suggest that VIP cascades can be activated in the brain in response to a social situation that stimulates the areas of the brain that are known to regulate behavior. This social circuit includes many areas of the hypothalamus along with the amygdala and the ventral tegmental area. The production and release of the neuropeptide VIP is centralized in the hypothalamic and extrahypothalamic regions of the brain and from there it is able to modulate the release of prolactin secretion. Once secreted from the pituitary gland, prolactin can increase many behaviors such as parental care and aggression. In certain species of birds with a knockout VIP gene there was an observable decrease in overall aggression over nesting territory. Pathology VIP is overproduced in VIPoma. In addition to VIPoma, VIP has a role in osteoarthritis (OA). While there is existing conflict in whether down-regulation or up-regulation of VIP contributes to OA, VIP has been shown to prevent cartilage damage in animals.

The brand achieved significant popularity in the 1960s due to the endorsement of the Beatles drummer Ringo Starr. Products manufactured by Ludwig include drum kits and hardware. The company also commercialises other percussion instruments (from the Musser Mallet Company acquired in 1965) such as marimbas, vibraphones, xylophones and bar chimes through its parent company Conn-Selmer.Mallet instruments on Conn-Selmer websiteOur brands on Conn-Selmer website, 11 Nov 2019  History  The Ludwig Drum Company was established in 1909 by William F. & Theobald Ludwig, sons of a German immigrant to the United States. William Jr. had been a professional drummer, playing with circuses and touring vaudeville shows, along with the occasional skating-rink gig. Since this work was irregular, he and his brother, Theobald, opened a drum shop in Chicago; they called it Ludwig & Ludwig. The company started with a concept for the design and manufacture of a functional bass drum pedal. The company added new products to its catalog, such as snare drums and timpani, in 1916. In 1917, Ludwig signed a deal to build rope drums to support World War I. Theobald Ludwig died in 1918, and William continued on his own. By 1923, the factory was the largest drum manufacturer in the world, employing 240 workers. In the late 1920s, the company was sold to the C.G. Conn instrument company. William Ludwig stayed on to run the company for Conn (which also owned the Leedy Drum Co. at this time). Eventually, William Ludwig decided to leave Conn and start a new company of his own. He was unable to use the Ludwig name since that trademark now belonged to Conn who continued to market Ludwig & Ludwig drums. In 1937, William bought a factory building and started The WFL Drum Company (his initials). The company continued producing drums at a small scale for the duration of World War II, but William got back to the idea of making the company a large drum manufacturer after the armistice. WFL was a competitor with Ludwig and Ludwig. Conn combined their two drum brands into one in the early 1950s, forming Leedy & Ludwig, and then decided to quit the drum business altogether. In 1955, William and his son Bill Jr. were able to buy the Ludwig trademark back from Conn, and over the next few years their company and its products transitioned from the WFL brand to being called \\"Ludwig\\" again. Despite initial success, Ludwig's global breakthrough would occur February 9, 1964, when The Beatles made their historic American TV debut on The Ed Sullivan Show.\\"The Beatles on The Ed Sullivan Show on February 9, 1964\\" on Ed Sullivan website\\"The Beatles‚Äô first Ed Sullivan Show\\" on The Beatles Bible The Ludwig logo, displayed on the front of Ringo Starr's bass drum, could be seen by the television audience of about seventy-three million people.\\"The 1960s\\" at Vintage Ludwig Drums\\"The origins of Ludwig drums\\" on The Chicago Reader As it happens, Starr chose that brand upon joining the band simply because he liked the oyster pearl black color of the drum kit he chose. The publicity resulted in Ludwig's sales doubling quickly to $13 million, which prompted production to increase to a 24/7 production as the company became the foremost drum manufacturer in North America for twenty years. Ludwig acquired the \\"Musser Mallet Company\\", a manufacturer of xylophones, marimbas and vibraphones, in 1965. Ludwig was a strong presence in the marching drum market. Their drums along with their Slingerland rivals. During the 1970s, Ludwig's ‚ÄúChallenger‚Äù line of snare drums offered sophisticated tuning and strong build quality. Ludwig drums were used by many leading drum and bugle corp. On 4 November 1981, William F Ludwig II sold the business to the Selmer Company (now Conn-Selmer). Selmer closed the Damen Avenue factory in the ensuing years and moved the drum production business to Monroe, North Carolina, in 1984.Selmer's History, 7 Dec 2011 In 2002, Ludwig merged with Conn-Selmer, becoming a brand of Conn-Selmer, Inc..About: 2000-2009 on Ludwig website The Musser manufacturing facility remained in LaGrange, Illinois, until 2013, and was then moved to Elkhart, Indiana.

He was Minister of the Interior, Overseas Territories and Territorial collectivities. He was previously Minister for Labour, Labour Relations, the Family, Solidarity and Urban Affairs and Minister-Delegate for Local Government at the Ministry of the Interior and was a Member of the European Parliament. Background Hortefeux was born in Neuilly-sur-Seine, Hauts-de-Seine but was raised in Auvergne. He is one of the most loyal political allies, and personal friend, of French president Nicolas Sarkozy. He is the godfather of one of Nicolas Sarkozy's sons. On 18 May 2007, he was appointed as the first Minister of Immigration, Integration, National Identity and Cooperative Development in the government of Prime Minister Fran√ßois Fillon. As such he has boosted the numbers of illegal immigrants forcibly repatriated from France, extended the network of detention centres (established also outside the larger conurbations in smaller cities such as Blois) and modified the rights of individuals and organizations which visit them. He is in favor of controls on immigration. He was the promoter of a law that toughens conditions of political asylum in France. He believes that France has a right to expel or welcome immigrants on a discretionary basis, citing as evidence the high unemployment and criminality rates of foreigners. He also points to the geographical concentration of foreigners in a small number of towns as evidence that they are not integrated in the country. As he declared in the newspaper Le Parisien on 8 November 2007: \\"France has the right to choose which immigrants it can accommodate... Let's muster the courage to face our problems! Do you find it normal that 60% of immigrants are concentrated in only 3 of our 22 regions? That the unemployment rate of these people is 22% and that their children are dropping out of school? No, we will not accept this.\\".Le Parisien, 8 octobre 2007 On M6's TV show Capital, when asked if there were illegal immigrants in France, he replied: \\"If you dream of a country where there are only honest and clean citizens... In reality, it's a constant struggle.\\" The 4 June 2010 a French court has fined him 750 euros for making racist comments about a young party activist of Algerian origin. But the court did not issue a criminal conviction, judging that Hortefeux had not intended the comments to be heard in public. In August 2010 following an earlier fatal incident involving travellers and gendarmerie at Th√©s√©e, near St. Aignan, Loir et Cher, Hortefeux has vigorously pursued a policy of destroying illegal travellers' camps and imposing conditions for voluntary repatriations of Roma (or gypsies) to Romania and Bulgaria, a considerable number of which are in progress. A circular emanating from his office (chef de cabinet: Michel Bart) on 5 August 2010, specifically mentioning an ethnic criterion for these deportations provoked the ire of ministerial colleagues such as Eric Besson and the European commissioner, Viviane Reding. An eirenic exchange with Cardinal Andr√© Vingt-Trois, the President of the French Bishops' Conference, representing contrasting reactions within the Catholic community, also ensued.

Hortefeux in the European institutions He is a member of the Union for a Popular Movement, which is part of the European People's Party. During his time at the European Parliament, he sat on the European Parliament's Committee on International Trade, was a substitute for the Committee on Budgets and was a member of the delegation for relations with the Maghreb countries and the Arab Maghreb Union. Political stances Hortefeux is a supporter of immigrant repatriation from France. He has supported and incentivised voluntary return, in his role as Immigration Minister of France, for immigrant families. In 2007, enhancing the offer to ‚Ç¨6,000 per family to leave the country, he claimed that the French government \\"must increase this measure to help voluntary return\\".  Racism  On 10 September 2009, Le Monde disclosed a video showing Hortefeux at the UMP Summer School in Seignosse, France, on Saturday, 5 September 2009. As he posed for a photograph with a young man of Arabic origin, the following conversation can be heard (translation): > Female voice ‚Äì He is Catholic, he eats pork and drinks beer! > Hortefeux ‚Äì Oh really? Well, he does not match the prototype at all! > Female voice ‚Äì He is one of us... he is our little Arab. > Hortefeux ‚Äì We always need one! When there is only one, it's okay. It's when > there are many that problems begin. In June 2010, a French court found Hortefeux guilty of a racial insult, and fined him 750 euros with an order to donate 2,000 euros to an anti-racism group. Hortefeux' lawyer said that they would appeal the ruling. 2010 cargo plane bomb plot  On 4 November 2010, Hortefeux said that one of the two bombs in the 2010 cargo plane bomb plot was defused just 17 minutes before it was set to explode.

The film is loosely based on a true story about the dog of the same name who helped save children infected with diphtheria in the 1925 serum run to Nome. The film stars Kevin Bacon, Bridget Fonda, Jim Cummings, Phil Collins (in a dual role) and Bob Hoskins, with Miriam Margolyes in the live-action sequences. The live-action portions of the film were shot in New York City's Central Park. Balto was the third and final animated feature produced by Steven Spielberg's UK-based Amblimation studio. Although the film was a major financial disappointment (it was overshadowed by the success of Pixar Animation Studios' first film Toy Story), its subsequent sales on home video led to two direct-to-video sequels: Balto II: Wolf Quest (2002) and Balto III: Wings of Change (2004), though none of the original voice cast reprised their roles. Plot In 1995 New York City, an elderly woman, her granddaughter, and the latter‚Äôs Siberian Husky, Blaze, are walking through Central Park, looking for a memorial. As they seat themselves for a rest, the woman tells her granddaughter a story about Nome, Alaska 70 years earlier in the winter of 1925, shifting the film from live-action to animation. Balto, a young wolfdog, lives in rural Nome with his adoptive uncle (a snow goose named Boris) and two polar bears, Muk and Luk. Being half-wolf, Balto is despised by dogs and humans alike. The only dog and only human in town kind to him are Jenna, a husky who Balto has a crush on, and her owner, Rosy. He is often bullied by champion sled dog Steele, a fierce and arrogant Malamute, who also likes Jenna. One evening, all the children, including Rosy, contract diphtheria and the doctor has no antitoxin. Severe winter weather conditions prevent medicine from being brought from Juneau by air or sea, and the closest rail line ends in Nenana. A dog race is held to determine the best-fit dogs for a sled dog team to get the medicine. Balto enters and wins, but Steele exposes his wolf half, causing his disqualification. The team departs that night with Steele in the lead and picks up the medicine successfully, but on the way back, they end up stranded at the base of an icy hill, with the musher unconscious. When this news reaches Nome, Balto sets out in search of them with Boris, Muk and Luk. On the way, they are attacked by a massive grizzly bear, but Jenna, who followed their marked trail, intervenes. The bear pursues Balto out onto a frozen lake, where he falls through the ice and drowns, while Muk and Luk save Balto from a similar fate. However, Jenna has been injured and cannot continue on. Balto instructs Boris and the polar bears to take her home while he continues on his own. Jenna gives him her bandanna to wear. Balto eventually finds the team, but Steele refuses his help and attacks Balto, only to fall off a cliff. Balto takes charge of the team, but Steele spitefully sabotages Balto's marks and the team loses their way again. While attempting to save the medicine from falling down a cliff, Balto himself falls. Back in Nome, Jenna is explaining Balto's mission to the other dogs when Steele returns, claiming the entire team, including Balto, is dead, using Jenna's bandanna as fake proof. However, Jenna sees through his lies and insists Balto will return with the medicine. Using a trick Balto showed her earlier, she places broken colored glass bottles on the outskirts of town and shines a lantern on them to simulate the Northern Lights, hoping it will help guide Balto home. When Balto regains consciousness, he is ready to give up hope, but when a polar wolf appears and Balto notices the medicine crate still intact nearby, he realizes that his part-wolf heritage is a strength, not a weakness. Balto rallies his confidence and drags the medicine back up the cliff to the waiting team. Using his highly developed senses, Balto is able to filter out the fake marks Steele created. After encountering further challenges and losing only one vial, Balto and the sled team finally make it back to Nome. Steele is exposed as a liar, and the other dogs turn against him, ruining his reputation. Reunited with his friends, Balto earns respect from both the dogs and the humans. He visits a cured Rosy, who thanks him for saving her. Back in the present day, the woman, her granddaughter, and Blaze finally find Balto's memorial, and she explains that Alaska runs the Iditarod dog race over the same path that Balto and his team took. The woman, revealed to be an elderly Rosy, repeats the same line, \\"Thank you, Balto. I would've been lost without you\\", before walking off to join her granddaughter and Blaze. The statue of Balto stands proudly in the sunlight. Cast and characters Kevin Bacon voices Balto *Kevin Bacon as Balto, a young adult male brown-and-grey wolfdog; being a Siberian Husky- Arctic wolf hybrid. Jeffrey James Varab and Dick Zondag served as the supervising animators for Balto. Bacon is succeeded by Maurice LaMarche in the direct-to-video sequels, Balto II: Wolf Quest and Balto III: Wings of Change. *Bob Hoskins as Boris Goosinoff, a Russian snow goose and Balto's caretaker and sidekick. Kristof Serrand served as the supervising animator for Boris. Hoskins is succeeded by Charles Fleischer in the sequels. *Bridget Fonda as Jenna, a female copper-and-white Siberian Husky and Rosy's pet as well as Balto's love interest. Robert Stevenhagen served as the supervising animator for Jenna. Fonda is succeeded by Jodi Benson in the sequels. * Juliette Brewer as Rosy, Jenna's owner and a kind, excitable girl who was the only human in Nome who was kind to Balto. David Bowers served as the supervising animator for Rosy. Rosy makes a brief cameo in Balto III: Wings of Change. *Miriam Margolyes as an old Rosy in the live-action sequences who narrates her story to her granddaughter at the beginning of the film. *Jim Cummings as Steele, a male black-and-white Alaskan Malamute who bullies Balto and also has a crush on Jenna. Sahin Ers√∂z served as the supervising animator for Steele. Brendan Fraser was originally cast to voice Steele, before being replaced by Cummings. *Phil Collins as Muk and Luk, a pair of polar bears. Nicolas Marlet served as the supervising animator for Muk and Luk. Collins is succeeded by Kevin Schon in the sequels. *Jack Angel, Danny Mann and Robbie Rist as Nikki, Kaltag and Star, respectively, the only three prominent members of Steele's team, who later abandon him for Balto. Nikki is a reddish-brown Chow-Chow, Kaltag is a honey-yellow Chinook-esque dog, and Star is a mauve-and-cream blue-eyed Siberian Husky. William Salazar served as the supervising animator for the team. Nikki, Kaltag and Star make brief cameos in Balto III: Wings of Change. *Sandra Dickinson as Dixie, a female Pomeranian and one of Jenna's friends who adores Steele until his lies are exposed by Balto returning with the medicine needed to cure the children. Dickinson also voices Sylvie, a female Afghan Hound who is also Jenna's friend; and Rosy's mother. Patrick Mate served as the supervising animator for Sylvie and Dixie. Sylvie makes a brief cameo in Balto III: Wings of Change. * Lola Bates-Campbell as Rosy's unnamed granddaughter, who appears in the live-action sequences and is accompanied by her dog Blaze, a purebred Siberian Husky. * William Roberts as Rosy's father *Donald Sinden as Doc, an old St. Bernard *Bill Bailey as a butcher *Garrick Hagon as a telegraph operator *Frank Welker (uncredited) as the grizzly bear. Welker later reprises his role as the bear in Balto II: Wolf Quest, being the only voice actor to do so in any sequels. Production Production and development on Balto began in May 1989 at Universal City Studios and Amblin Entertainment in Universal City, California, along with An American Tail: Fievel Goes West (1991) and We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story (1993). Voice- recording sessions took place at The Bridge Facilities in London (now folded into Miloco Studios and renamed The Bridge Writing Studio) between late 1992 and early 1993. Brendan Fraser was originally cast as Steele, because director Simon Wells had envisioned Steele as a school quarterback jock carried away by his sense of importance, and felt that Fraser fitted that personality well. According to Wells, \\"I liked Brendan a great deal, and we did one recording session with him that was terrific.\\" However, executive producer Steven Spielberg wanted a clearer sense of Steele's \\"inherent evil\\", so Fraser was replaced by Jim Cummings. Wells stated that Cummings \\"did a fantastic job, and totally made the character live, so I don't regret the choice.\\" After the actors recorded their voices, animating and filming commenced at Amblimation in London on March 1, 1993. To have a source for the dogs' character animation to be based on, the filmmakers brought in about seven Siberian Huskies and videotaped them walking around in the studio. Although most of the film's animation was hand-drawn, the animators used Toonz to improve the graphics, and also created the snowstorms using an early CGI particle animation system. Additional animation was done by the Danish studio A. Film Production. James Horner composed the film's music, including the film's only song, \\"Reach for the Light\\", sung by Steve Winwood, which plays over the film's closing credits. The film's live-action prologue and epilogue segments were filmed in Central Park in Fall 1994. The role as elderly Rosy's granddaughter's husky, Blaze, was played by two light red blue-eyed Siberian Huskies. Historical differences *The film portrays Balto (1919-March 1933) as a brown-and-gray wolfdog. In reality, Balto was a purebred Siberian Husky and was black and white in color. Balto's colors changed to brown due to light exposure while on display in the Cleveland Museum of Natural History. *In reality, the sled run to retrieve the medicine was actually a relay. Instead of being the leader of the first and only team, Balto was the leader of the 20th and last team to carry the medicine to Nome. The longest and most hazardous distance was traveled by the 18th and third-to-last team, which was led by Togo. *In the film, the reason why Dr. Curtis Welch orders the medicine to be sent to Nome is because his supply has completely run out. In reality, the reason was that his entire batch was past its expiration date and no longer had any effect. *In the film, the medicine is shipped to Nenana from the Alaskan capital of Juneau, but in reality, it was shipped from Anchorage, 800 miles southeast of Nome. *The medicine was transported in a 300,000 unit cylinder. In the film, it is transported in a large square crate. *In the film, the only residents of Nome who contract diphtheria are 18 children, but in reality, many more were infected, including adults. *In the sequels, Balto became a proud father with Jenna and they had a litter of puppies who grew up and moved on with their lives, but in reality, Balto was neutered at 6 months of age, and thus, he never sired a litter. *In reality, none of the mushers were ever knocked unconscious. *Balto was never an outcast street dog as shown by the film, but was instead born in a kennel owned by the famous musher and breeder Leonhard Seppala, who raised and trained him until Balto was deemed fit for pulling a sled as the lead dog. Seppala was also the owner of Togo (1913-1929), whom he personally used to lead his dog team during the relay. Balto was used to lead the team driven by one of Seppala's workers, Gunnar Kaasen. *In the sequels, Balto continued living in Nome along with his family and friends, but in reality, Balto and his team were sent to the Brookside Zoo (now the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo) in 1927 where they spent their last years. Balto rested there until his death on March 14, 1933 at the age of 14. After he died, his body was taxidermied and kept in the Cleveland Museum of Natural History, where it remains today. Release The film was theatrically released in the United States on December 22, 1995 and then international theatres on January 13, 1996 when it first premiered in Brazil. Its release was vastly overshadowed by the release of Disney‚Ä¢Pixar's Toy Story, which premiered a month earlier. Box office The film ranked 15th on its opening weekend and earned $1.5 million from a total of 1,427 theaters. The film also ranked 7th among G-rated movies in 1995. Total domestic gross reach up to $11,348,324. Despite being the biggest box-office disappointment of the year, it was far more successful in terms of video sales. These strong video sales led to the release of two direct-to-video sequels: Balto II: Wolf Quest and Balto III: Wings of Change being created, though neither sequel received as strong a reception as the original film. Critical reception The film received decidedly mixed reviews upon release. According to review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, it holds a 54% rating based on 24 reviews, with an average rating of 5.88/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Balto is a well-meaning adventure with spirited animation, but mushy sentimentality and bland characterization keeps it at paw's length from more sophisticated family fare.\\" Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film a positive review, describing the film as \\"a kids' movie, simply told, with lots of excitement and characters you can care about\\" and praised every thrilling scene. Home video Balto was released on VHS and Laserdisc on April 2, 1996, by MCA/Universal Home Video in North America and CIC Video internationally. The VHS version was made available once more on August 11, 1998, under the Universal Family Features label. The film was released on DVD on February 19, 2002, which includes a game, \\"Where is the Dog Sled Team?\\". This version was reprinted along with other Universal films such as An American Tail, An American Tail: Fievel Goes West and The Land Before Time. It was released in widescreen on Blu-ray for the first time on July 4, 2017, which included a digital HD and UltraViolet copy. Soundtrack Balto: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack is the soundtrack of the film, composed by James Horner. Track listing=Awards The film received 5 Annie award nominations, including Best Animated Film, losing all to Toy Story. Sequels Two fictional direct-to-video sequels of the film followed, made by Universal Cartoon Studios with their animation done overseas by the Taiwanese studio Wang Film Productions, as Amblimation had gone out of business. Due to the sequels being completely fictional and having a completely different crew, Kevin Bacon, Bob Hoskins, Bridget Fonda, and Phil Collins did not reprise their roles in either of them. Instead, Bacon was replaced by Maurice LaMarche as the voice of Balto, Hoskins was replaced by Charles Fleischer as the voice of Boris, Fonda was replaced by Jodi Benson as the voice of Jenna, and Collins was replaced by Kevin Schon as the voices of Muk and Luk. Furthermore, numerous supporting characters from the original (such as Steele, Nikki, Kaltag and Star) either did not return in the sequels or were turned into background characters in them for unstated reasons (possibly because they were either written out by mistake or the writers simply forgot about their existence). The first sequel, Balto II: Wolf Quest, was released in 2002 and follows the adventures of one of Balto and Jenna's pups, Aleu, who sets off to discover her wolf heritage. The second, Balto III: Wings of Change, was released in 2005. The storyline follows the same litter of pups from Balto II: Wolf Quest, but focuses on another pup, Kodi, who is a member of a U.S. Mail dog sled delivery team, and is in danger of getting put out of his job by Duke, a pilot of a mail delivery bush plane. Unlike the original film, neither of the sequels took any historical references from the true story of Balto and contain no live action sequences.

It has also supported many treatments such as nicotine patches and gums, and performed research into AIDS and other drug-related diseases. Its monopoly on the supply of research-grade marijuana has proved controversial. History NIDA's roots can be traced back to 1935, when a research facility (named the Addiction Research Center in 1948) was established in Lexington, Kentucky as part of a USPHS hospital. The Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) and National Household Survey on Drug Abuse (NHSDA) were created in 1972. In 1974 NIDA was established as part of the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Administration and given authority over the DAWN and NHSDA programs. The Monitoring the Future Survey, which surveys high school seniors, was initiated in 1975; in 1991, it was expanded to include 8th and 10th graders. In October 1992, NIDA became part of the National Institutes of Health, United States Department of Health and Human Services. At that time, responsibility for the DAWN and NHSDA programs were transferred to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). NIDA is organized into divisions and offices, each of which is involved with programs of drug abuse research. Nora Volkow, MD, has been the director of NIDA since 2003. According to NIH: The physical/psychological addiction dichotomy is reflected in the Controlled Substances Act's criteria for drug scheduling. Placement in Schedule III, for instance, requires a finding that \\"abuse of the drug or other substance may lead to moderate or low physical dependence or high psychological dependence.\\" The view espoused by former NIDA director Alan I. Leshner, which places more emphasis on the \\"compulsive, uncontrollable\\" aspect of addictive drug use than on physical withdrawal symptoms, explains NIDA's differing treatment of morphine and cannabis. Morphine is physically addictive, and users of heroin and other opiate-derived drugs become physically and psychologically dependent on the high from the opiates, which drives them to seek the drug and perform acts they might not normally engage in (like exchanging drugs for sex acts or sharing needles with another user) . In contrast, marijuana is not physically addictive, though some users do become psychologically dependent on the drug. Jon Gettman and other supporters of removal of cannabis from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act have questioned the legality of basing scheduling decisions on such considerations rather than on physical addiction and physical harm; Gettman stated, \\"If the federal government wants to keep marijuana in schedule 1, or if they believe that placing marijuana in schedule 2 is a viable policy, then we're going to cross-examine under oath and penalty of perjury every HHS official and scientist who claims that marijuana use is as dangerous as the use of cocaine or heroin.\\" NIDA's viewpoint is supported by the fact that the CSA lists not only physical addictiveness but also \\"history and current pattern of abuse\\" and \\"scope, duration, and significance of abuse\\" among the factors to be considered in drug scheduling. Indeed, cannabis' retention in Schedule I has been partly due to findings in these areas by FDA, SAMHSA, and NIDA. The January 17, 2001 document Basis for the Recommendation for Maintaining Marijuana in Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act specifically cites SAMHSA's National Household Survey on Drug Abuse, NIDA's Monitoring the Future survey, SAMHSA's Drug Abuse Warning Network, and NIDA's Community Epidemiology Work Group data. NIDA has supported many treatments for drug addiction. NIDA- supported studies led to the use of nicotine patches and gums for nicotine addiction treatment. NIDA scientists also developed LAAM, which is used for heroin addiction treatment. Other treatments that were the subject of NIDA research include naltrexone and buprenorphine. NIDA states, \\"By conservative estimates, every $1 spent on drug addiction saves society $4 to $7 in criminal justice and health care costs\\", which points to the need for spending funds on effective prevention and treatment programs based on evidence, rather than criminal sanctions that do not impact drug use. NIDA has also conducted research into diseases associated with drug use, such as AIDS and Hepatitis. NIDA views drug treatment as a means of modifying risky behavior such as unprotected sex and sharing needles. NIDA has also funded studies dealing with harm reduction. A NIDA-supported study on pregnant drug users noted, \\"professionals in research and treatment must learn to settle for less because insisting on total abstinence may exacerbate the problem.\\" This study was conducted by Marsha Rosenbaum of the Lindesmith Center, an organization that has been critical of federal drug policies. In the 1990s, NIDA funded research by John W. Huffman that was focused on making a drug to target endocannabinoid receptors in the body; this resulted in the discovery of a variety of substances that are now being sold as Spice, K2, etc. In 2006, NIDA received an annual budget of $1.01 billion. The U.S. government says NIDA funds more than 85 percent of the world's research about the health aspects of drug abuse and addiction. Publications A NIDA educational pamphlet.NIDA Notes is a bimonthly newsletter that has been published since 1985. Its scope covers drug abuse research in the areas of treatment and prevention, epidemiology, neuroscience, behavioral science, health services, and AIDS. NIDA-supported studies are also published in other journals. NIDA publishes educational materials as well which aim to provide pertinent facts to teenagers who will be making drug use decisions and to parents. This literature has sometimes been used by legalization advocates to advance their points, an example being NIDA's admittal that \\"many young people who use marijuana do not go on to use other drugs.\\" Controversial research Drug abuse, in addition to being an area of scientific research, is also a major subject of public policy debate. Accordingly, elected officials have sometimes attempted to shape the debate by introducing legislation in reference to NIDA research. In 2004, Congressman Mark Souder introduced the Safe and Effective Drug Act, calling for a \\"meta- analysis of existing medical marijuana data.\\" It was criticized for being limited to smoked cannabis (rather than vaporizers and other methods of ingestion) and not requiring any new research. In some cases, NIDA has held its ground when its more moderate stances were questioned by legislators favoring a hard-line approach. On April 27, 2004, Souder sent NIH Director Elias A. Zerhouni a letter criticizing needle exchange programs for causing increases in infection rates. The Harm Reduction Coalition responded with its concerns, and NIDA Director Nora Volkow wrote a letter stating: DAWN, or the Drug Abuse Warning Network, is a program to collect statistics on the frequency of emergency department mentions of use of different types of drugs. This information is widely cited by drug policy officials, who have sometimes confused drug-related episodes‚Äîemergency department visits induced by drugs‚Äîwith drug mentions. The Wisconsin Department of Justice claimed, \\"In Wisconsin, marijuana overdose visits in emergency rooms equal to heroin or morphine [sic], twice as common as Valium.\\" Common Sense for Drug Policy called this as a distortion, noting, \\"The federal DAWN report itself notes that reports of marijuana do not mean people are going to the hospital for a marijuana overdose, it only means that people going to the hospital for a drug overdose mention marijuana as a drug they use.\\" The National Survey on Drug Use and Health is an annual study of American drug use patterns. According to NIDA, \\"The data collection method is in‚Äìperson interviews conducted with a sample of individuals at their place of residence. ACASI provides a highly private and confidential means of responding to questions to increase the level of honest reporting of illicit drug use and other sensitive behavior.\\" Sixty-eight thousand people were interviewed in 2003, with a weighted response rate for interviewing of 73 percent. Like DAWN, the Survey often draws criticism because of how the data is used by drug policy officials. Rob Kampia of Marijuana Policy Project stated in a September 5, 2002 press release, NIDA literature and National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) research frequently contradict each other. For instance, in the 1980s and 1990s, NIMH researchers found that dopamine plays only a marginal role in marijuana's psychoactive effects. Years later, however, NIDA educational materials continued to warn of the danger of dopamine-related marijuana addiction. NIDA appears to be backing off of these dopamine claims, adding disclaimers to its teaching packets that the interaction of THC with the reward system is not fully understood. The NIDA also funded the research of John W. Huffman who first synthesized many novel cannabinoids. This compounds are now being sold all around the world as pure compounds or mixed with herbals known as spices. The fact that NIDA has allowed and paid for the synthesis of these new cannabinoids without recommending human consumption research is a topic of concern, especially since some of these JWH substances were recently put into Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act via emergency legislation. Medical marijuana monopoly NIDA has inside the US a government granted monopoly on the production of medical marijuana for research purposes. In the past, the institute has refused to supply marijuana to researchers who had obtained all other necessary federal permits. Medical marijuana researchers and activists claim that NIDA, which is not supposed to be a regulatory organization, does not have the authority to effectively regulate who does and doesn't get to do research with medical marijuana. Jag Davies of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) writes in MAPS Bulletin: NIDA administers a contract with the University of Mississippi to grow the nation's only legal cannabis crop for medical and research purposes, including the Compassionate Investigational New Drug program. A Fast Company article pointed out, \\"Based on the photographic evidence, NIDA's concoction of seeds, stems, and leaves more closely resembles dried cat brier than cannabis\\". An article in Mother Jones describes their crop as \\"brown, stems-and-seeds-laden, low- potency pot‚Äîwhat's known on the streets as \\"schwag\\"\\"aka \\"Bobby Brown\\" United States federal law currently registers cannabis as a Schedule I drug. Medical marijuana researchers typically prefer to use high-potency marijuana, but NIDA's National Advisory Council on Drug Abuse has been reluctant to provide cannabis with high THC levels, citing safety concerns: Speaking before the National Advisory Council on Drug Abuse, Rob Kampia of the Marijuana Policy Project criticized NIDA for refusing to provide researcher Donald Abrams with marijuana for his studies, stating that \\"after nine months of delay, Dr. Leshner rejected Dr. Abrams' request for marijuana, on what we believe are political grounds that the FDA-approved protocol is inadequate.\\" In May 2006, the Boston Globe reported that: Ricaurte's monkeys NIDA has drawn criticism for continuing to provide funding to George Ricaurte, who in 2002 conducted a study that was widely touted as proving that MDMA (ecstasy) caused dopaminergic neurotoxicity in monkeys. His paper \\"Severe Dopaminergic Neurotoxicity in Primates After a Common Recreational Dose Regimen of MDMA ('Ecstasy')\\" in Science was later retracted after it became clear that the monkeys had in fact been injected not with MDMA, but with extremely high doses of methamphetamine. A FOIA request was subsequently filed by MAPS to find out more about the research and NIDA's involvement in it. Effectiveness of anti- marijuana ad campaigns Treatment Art Card. In February 2005, Westat, a research company hired by NIDA and funded by The White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, reported on its five-year study of the government ad campaigns aimed at dissuading teens from using marijuana, campaigns that cost more than $1 billion between 1998 and 2004. The study found that the ads did not work: \\"greater exposure to the campaign was associated with weaker anti-drug norms and increases in the perceptions that others use marijuana.\\" NIDA leaders and the White House drug office did not release the Westat report for a year and a half. NIDA dated Westat's report as \\"delivered\\" in June 2006. In fact, it was delivered in February 2005, according to the Government Accountability Office, the federal watchdog agency charged with reviewing the study. Office of Inspector General (OIG) investigations of NIDA commercial partnerships On the 26 October 2011, the OIG published its results from an audit of a contract between the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) and Charles River Laboratories, Inc., which read in part:  See also  * William Pollin, second director of NIDA, from 1975‚Äì1985 ReferencesExternal links * * National Institute on Drug Abuse: \\"NIDA for Teens\\". * NIH Almanac, NIDA Timelines and organizational structure * The National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), NIDA, 7 February 2003. * Convention on Psychotropic Substances 1971, International Narcotics Control Board. * Breen, Bill: Pipe Dream?: Rick Doblin has a prescription for fixing NIDA's ailing medical-marijuana program: establish an alternative, Issue 79, Feb. 2004. * Drug War Distortions, Common Sense for Drug Policy. * Gettman, Jon: Dopamine and the Dependence Liability of Marijuana, July 11, 1997. * Kampia, Rob: Testimony at the September 19 Meeting of the National Advisory Council on Drug Abuse, 19 September 1995. * MPP Responds to Release of 2001 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse, Marijuana Policy Project, 5 September 2002. * Grim, Ryan: Federal Agency Cleans Up Its Own Wikipedia Entry * Feds Mess with Wikipedia Entry, Again Blog entry about efforts by NIH staff to remove criticism of NIDA from this page Drug Abuse Category:1974 establishments in Maryland Category:Government research ","title":"National Institute on Drug Abuse"},{"id":"1488007","text":"Bowed string instruments are a subcategory of string instruments that are played by a bow rubbing the strings.

It took part in the fighting for the cities of central Germany and the northwestern ports, in addition to participating in the Kapp Putsch. The Brigade was formed from former Naval personnel in the area of Generalkommando des Garde-Korps (Berlin). It was commanded by the conservative Nationalist Hermann Ehrhardt and fought alongside the Freiw. Landessch√ºtzenkorps under General von Roeder in the retaking of Northwest German ports such as Bremen, Cuxhaven and Wilhelmshaven in early 1919. After the defeat of the northern communist forces the Brigade marched to the industrial cities of central Germany (along with the Freiw. Landesj√§gerkorps, I Marine Brigade, Freikorps H√ºlsen, Freikorps G√∂rlitz and Freikorps von Oven) to defeat the local communist uprisings. After the defeat of the uprisings, the Brigade went on to fight the Bavarian Soviet Republic during the spring of 1919. It made up only a small fraction of the total free corps forces, which totaled to around 30,000 men. At the end of April the free corps closed in on Munich. The Red Guards began arresting suspected \\"counterrevolutionaries\\" and on 29 April eight men, including the well-connected Prince Gustav of Thurn and Taxis, were executed as \\"right-wing spies\\". Soon after, on 3 May, the free corps attacked and defeated the communist volunteers after bitter street fights in which over 1,000 communists were killed. About 800 men and women were arrested and executed by the victorious free corps. In August 1919, the Brigade went to Upper Silesia, where Polish nationalists had attempted to forcibly annex the region to Poland. Local free corps, reinforced by groups such as the Brigade and the III Marine Brigade, easily repressed the First Silesian Uprising. Marinebrigade Ehrhardt in the Kapp Putsch, 1920.German Federal Archive image description After the signing of the Treaty of Versailles, the new Weimar Republic had friends neither in the free corps nor the old Imperial army and many conspiracies blossomed. The Marinebrigade Ehrardt was involved in several of them, including the Kapp-L√ºttwitz Putsch. In line with the Treaty of Versailles, which limited the size of the Reichswehr to 100,000 soldiers, the German government, in March 1920, issued orders the disbandment of several free corps, including the Brigade. Its leaders were determined to resist dissolution and appealed for support to General Walther von L√ºttwitz, commander of the Reichswehr in Berlin. L√ºttwitz, an organiser of free corps in 1918-19 and a fervent monarchist, responded by calling on President Friedrich Ebert and Defence Minister Gustav Noske to stop the disbandment. When Ebert refused, L√ºttwitz ordered the Brigade to march on Berlin. It occupied the capital on 13 March. L√ºttwitz, therefore, was the driving force behind the putsch. Its nominal leader, though, was Wolfgang Kapp, an irresolute and indecisive East Prussian civil servant, though a fervent nationalist. The Reichswehr, under orders from General Hans von Seeckt, one of the Reichswehr's senior commanders, did confront the rebels, but their only other support came from some small Freikorps groups, and the only one that made a serious move was the III Marine Brigade, under Von L√∂wenfeld, in Silesia, who took the regional capital, Breslau. The government issued a proclamation calling on Germany's unions to defeat the putsch by means of a general strike. The strike call received massive support and by 18 March the Putsch had been a massive failure. After the coup, the Marinebrigade Ehrhardt was disbanded by General von Seeckt, but its members continued to function under different covers such as Bund ehemaliger Ehrhardtoffiziere, Organisation Consul and Sportverein Olympia.

It is a wholly owned subsidiary of Steinway Musical Instruments and was formed in 2003 by combining the Steinway properties The Selmer Company and United Musical Instruments. The company produces a large variety of instruments itself and through its brands. History=Origins In the late nineteenth century, brothers Alexandre and Henri Selmer graduated from the Paris Conservatory as clarinetists. They were the great-grandchildren of French military drum major Johannes Jacobus Zelmer, grandchildren of Jean-Jacques Selmer, the Army Chief of Music, and two of 16 children in this musical family.Priestly, Brian, Bacon, tony and Trynka, Paul, Selmer (Paris), The Sax and Brass Book, Backbeat Books, 1998, p.100‚Äì113 At the time, musical instruments and accessories were primarily hand made, and professional musicians found it necessary to acquire skills allowing them to make their own accessories and repair and modify their own instruments. Establishing Henri Selmer & Cie. in 1885, Henri began making clarinet reeds and mouthpieces. In 1898 Selmer opened a store and repair shop in Paris and started producing clarinets. Henri Selmer's brother Alexandre joined the Boston Symphony Orchestra that same year. In 1904, Selmer clarinets were presented at the Saint Louis (USA) World's Fair, winning a Gold Medal, and Alexandre Selmer was First Clarinetist with the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra. Alexandre established himself in New York in 1909, opening a shop that sold Selmer clarinets and mouthpieces. The H&A; Selmer (USA) Company grew out of that retail operation. The H&A; Selmer (USA) Company In 1910, Alexandre returned to France and the H&A; Selmer store was managed by George Bundy. The store expanded its product line, selling \\"Selmer\\" branded wind instruments and mouthpieces from manufacturers in the US in addition to Selmer (Paris) products. In 1923, the H&A; Selmer Company was incorporated to expand its retail operations. A 49% share was sold to C. G. Conn Ltd while Selmer (Paris) retained a minority interest. In 1927 Bundy gained full ownership, establishing independence of the company. H&A; Selmer (USA) remained the sole importer of Selmer (Paris) products, including saxophones and brasswinds once exports of such instruments to the USA commenced. In 1936 Selmer changed its distribution strategy, abandoning most retail and becoming a wholesaler of instruments and supplies. Selmer went on to establish itself as a leading distributor of student-grade instruments under its Artley and Bundy brands. In 1939 Selmer financed the startup Artley Flute Company of Elkhart Indiana, which provided flutes, and later clarinets, exclusively to Selmer until 1953. In response to the unavailability of Selmer (Paris) instruments after the German defeat of France in 1940, Selmer sought alternate sources for wind instruments and distributed them under their new student-line Bundy and intermediate Signet brands. In 1950 George Bundy retired and sold his shares to partners Joseph M. Grolimund, Jack Feddersen, Milt Broadhead, and Charles Bickel. Starting in 1952, the Selmer Artist program offered special deals for musicians who agreed to perform and record exclusively with Selmer (Paris) instruments, boosting the reputation of Selmer (Paris) instruments among aspiring professionals. In 1958 Selmer acquired the Harry Pedler and Sons brasswind plant in Elkhart, starting in-house production of Bundy student-line brasswinds. In 1961 Selmer acquired the brasswind manufacturer Vincent Bach Corporation. Selmer moved production from Bach's Mount Vernon, New York facility to Elkhart in 1965 while retaining the premium line Bach Stradivarius. The services of Mr. Vincent Bach were retained for design of student-line brasswinds. In 1963 Selmer acquired ownership of its main supplier of student saxophones, the Buescher Band Instrument Company. Selmer continued distributing identical Bundy and Buescher instruments until it discontinued the Buescher name in 1983. In 1965 Selmer acquired the rights to the Brilhart line of woodwind mouthpieces, with production contracted to the Runyon Company, and in 1966 it acquired the Lesher Woodwind Company, a manufacturer of oboes and bassoons. In 1970 Selmer acquired additional production facilities from C.G. Conn, who were divesting their Elkhart, Indiana operations. In 1977 Selmer acquired the stringed instrument maker Glaesel. Selmer acquired the Ludwig Drum Company in 1981. The era of H&A; Selmer as an independent company ended in 1970, with its purchase by the British electronics firm Magnavox. It was sold to Philips Electronics in 1975, then to the investment firm Integrated Resources in 1989. With the 1993 bankruptcy of Integrated Resources, Selmer was sold to the investment firm Kirkland Messina and reorganized as Selmer Industries, Inc., with The Selmer Company name used for its instrument manufacturing operations. Recent history With the backing of Kirkland Messina, Selmer Industries acquired the Steinway Musical Properties company, the parent company of piano manufacturer Steinway & Sons, in 1995 and changed their own name to Steinway Musical Instruments. The domestically-produced Bundy brand was discontinued shortly afterward, replaced with student wind instruments sourced from Asia and sold as Selmer (USA) woodwinds and Bach brasswinds. In 2000 Steinway acquired United Musical Instruments (owners of Artley, Armstrong, Benge, C.G. Conn, King, Scherl & Roth) then merged it with The Selmer Company to form Conn-Selmer in 2003. Some products were dropped to minimize overlap between Selmer and former UMI products. In 2004 Conn-Selmer acquired the Leblanc Company, gaining their exclusive distribution rights for Yanagisawa saxophones in the US and Canada. Conn-Selmer kept Leblanc in production of clarinets but ended their brasswind production in 2007, discontinuing their Martin brand and moving production of their Holton brand to Elkhart, Indiana. Conn-Selmer retains the North American importation and distribution rights for Selmer (Paris) and Yanagisawa wind instruments formerly held by H&A; Selmer and Leblanc, respectively. Conn-Selmer is the largest manufacturer of band and orchestral instruments in the United States. Now having extensive manufacturing in China, it manufactures instruments in approximately five facilities since 2002. It has been heavily involved in outsourcing manufacturing of brands formerly associated with American manufacturers, including Ludwig drums, Glaesel, Scherl & Roth, and Wm. Lewis and Sons stringed instruments to China and Selmer (USA) wind instruments to various Asian sources. The employees at the Vincent Bach facility in Elkhart, Indiana represented by United Auto Workers Local 364, struck on April 1, 2006, and as of July 30, 2009, the union was decertified. Out of 230 workers that went out on strike approximately 70 returned with the remaining workers having been subject to recall until July 30, 2010. In 2006 calls were made for the American Federation of Musicians to boycott the entire Steinway-Conn-Selmer instrument company due to its permanently replacing union workers at its manufacturing facilities. The employees represented by UAW Local 2359 at the Eastlake Ohio Conn-Selmer manufacturing plant called a strike on July 26, 2011, after working without a contract since February 2011, and settled with the company on October 21, 2011. In 2013 the Paulson & Co.. investment firm acquired Steinway Musical Instruments. *Cleveland, Ohio *Eastlake, Ohio *Elkhart, Indiana *Kenosha, Wisconsin (closed) *La Grange, Illinois (closed) *Monroe, North Carolina Products=Current products *C.G.

Making and distributing such recordings is known as bootlegging. Recordings may be copied and traded among fans without financial exchange, but some bootleggers have sold recordings for profit, sometimes by adding professional-quality sound engineering and packaging to the raw material. Bootlegs usually consist of unreleased studio recordings, live performances or interviews with unpredictable quality. The practice of releasing unauthorised performances had been established before the 20th century, but reached new popularity with Bob Dylan's Great White Wonder, a compilation of studio outtakes and demos released in 1969 using low-priority pressing plants. The following year, the Rolling Stones' Live'r Than You'll Ever Be, an audience recording of a late 1969 show, received a positive review in Rolling Stone. Subsequent bootlegs became more sophisticated in packaging, particularly the Trademark of Quality label with William Stout's cover artwork. Compact disc bootlegs first appeared in the 1980s, and internet distribution became increasingly popular in the 1990s. Changing technologies have affected the recording, distribution, and profitability of the bootlegging industry. The copyrights for the music and the right to authorise recordings often reside with the artist, according to several international copyright treaties. The recording, trading and sale of bootlegs continues to thrive, even as artists and record companies release official alternatives. Definitions The word \\"bootleg\\" originates from the practice of smuggling illicit items in the legs of tall boots, particularly the smuggling of alcohol during the American Prohibition era. The word, over time, has come to refer to any illegal or illicit product. This term has become an umbrella term for illicit, unofficial, or unlicensed recordings, including vinyl LPs, silver CDs, or any other commercially sold media or material. The alternate term ROIO (an acronym meaning \\"Recording of Indeterminate / Independent Origin) or VOI (Video....) arose among Pink Floyd collectors, to clarify the recording source and copyright status was hard to determine. Although unofficial and unlicensed recordings had existed before the 1960s, the very first rock bootlegs came in plain sleeves with the title rubber stamped on it. However, they quickly developed into more sophisticated packaging, in order to distinguish the manufacturer from inferior competitors. With today's packaging and desktop publishing technology, even the layman can create \\"official\\" looking CDs. With the advent of the cassette and CD-R, however, some bootlegs are traded privately with no attempt to be manufactured professionally. This is even more evident with the ability to share bootlegs via the Internet. Bootlegs should not be confused with counterfeit or unlicensed recordings, which are merely unauthorised duplicates of officially released recordings, often attempting to resemble the official product as close as possible. Some record companies have considered that any record issued outside of their control, and for which they do not receive payment, to be a counterfeit, which includes bootlegs. However, some bootleggers are keen to stress that the markets for bootleg and counterfeit recordings are different, and a typical consumer for a bootleg will have bought most or all of that artist's official releases anyway. Who's Zoo compiled early singles and B-sides by The Who, which had not been commercially released in the U.S. Like several Trademark of Quality bootlegs, it featured cover artwork by William Stout. The most common type is the live bootleg, or audience recording, which is created with sound recording equipment smuggled into a live concert. Many artists and live venues prohibit this form of recording, but from the 1970s onwards the increased availability of portable technology made such bootlegging easier, and the general quality of these recordings has improved over time as consumer equipment becomes sophisticated. A number of bootlegs originated with FM radio broadcasts of live or previously recorded live performances. Other bootlegs may be soundboard recordings taken directly from a multi-track mixing console used to feed the public address system at a live performance. Artists may record their own shows for private review, but engineers may surreptitiously take a copy of this, which ends up being shared. As a soundboard recording is intended to supplement the natural acoustics of a gig, a bootleg may have an inappropriate mix of instruments, unless the gig is so large that everything needs to be amplified and sent to the desk. Some bootlegs consist of private or professional studio recordings distributed without the artist's involvement, including demos, works-in-progress or discarded material. These might be made from private recordings not meant to be widely shared, or from master recordings stolen or copied from an artist's home, a recording studio or the offices of a record label, or they may be copied from promotional material issued to music publishers or radio stations, but not for commercial release. A theme of early rock bootlegs was to copy deleted records, such as old singles and B-sides, onto a single LP, as a cheaper alternative to obtaining all the original recordings. Strictly speaking, these were unlicensed recordings, but because the work required to clear all the copyrights and publishing of every track for an official release was considered to be prohibitively expensive, the bootlegs became popular. Some bootlegs, however, did lead to official releases. The Who's Zoo bootleg, collecting early singles of The Who, inspired the official album Odds And Sods, which beat the bootleggers by issuing unreleased material, while various compilations of mid-1960s bands inspired the Nuggets series of albums. History=Pre-1960s According to enthusiast and author Clinton Heylin, the concept of a bootleg record can be traced back to the days of William Shakespeare, where unofficial transcripts of his plays would be published. At that time, society was not particularly interested in who a particular author was, but the \\"cult of authorship\\" became established in the 19th century, resulting the first Berne Convention in 1886 to cover copyright. The US did not agree to the original terms, resulting in many \\"piratical reprints\\" of sheet music being published there by the end of the century. Film soundtracks were often bootlegged; if the officially released soundtrack had been re- recorded with a house orchestra, there would be demand for the original audio recording taken directly from the film. One example was a bootleg of Judy Garland performing Annie Get Your Gun (1950), before Betty Hutton replaced her early in production, but after a full soundtrack had been recorded. The Recording Industry Association of America objected to unauthorised releases and attempted several raids on production. The Wagern-Nichols Home Recordist Guild recorded numerous performances at the Metropolitan Opera House, and openly sold them without paying royalties to the writers and performers. The company was sued by the American Broadcasting Company and Columbia Records (whom at the time held the official rights to recordings made at the opera house), who managed to obtain a court injunction against producing the record. 1960s Kum Back, a collection of recordings by The Beatles in early 1969, appeared before the official release of Let It Be. The first popular rock music bootleg resulted from Bob Dylan's activities between largely disappearing from the public eye after his motorcycle accident in 1966, and the release of John Wesley Harding at the end of 1967. After a number of artists had hits with Dylan songs that he had not officially released himself, demand increased for these recordings, particularly when they started airing on local radio in Los Angeles. Through various contacts in the radio industry, a number of pioneering bootleggers managed to buy a reel to reel tape containing a selection of unreleased Dylan songs intended for distribution for music publishers and wondered if it would be possible to manufacture them on an LP. They managed to convince a local pressing plant to press between 1,000 and 2,000 copies discreetly, paying in cash and avoiding using real names or addresses. Since the bootleggers could not commercially print a sleeve, due to it attracting too much attention from recording companies, the LP was issued in a plain white cover with Great White Wonder rubber stamped on it. Subsequently, Dylan became one of the most popular artists to be bootlegged with numerous releases. The Rolling Stones' Live'r Than You'll Ever Be, released in late 1969, received a rave review in Rolling Stone When The Rolling Stones announced their 1969 American tour, their first in the U.S. for several years, an enterprising bootlegger known as \\"Dub\\" decided to record some of the shows. He purchased a Sennheiser 805 \\"shotgun\\" microphone and a Uher 4000 reel to reel tape recorder specifically for recording the performances, smuggling them into the venues. The resulting bootleg, Live'r Than You'll Ever Be, was released shortly before Christmas 1969, mere weeks after the tour had finished, and in January 1970 received a rave review in Rolling Stone, who described the sound quality as \\"superb, full of presence, picking up drums, bass, both guitars and the vocals beautifully ... it is the ultimate Rolling Stones album\\". The bootleg sold several tens of thousands of copies, orders of magnitude more than a typical classical or opera bootleg, and its success resulted in the official release of the live album Get Yer Ya- Ya's Out! later in the year. \\"Dub\\" was one of the founders of the Trade Mark of Quality (TMOQ or TMQ) bootleg record label. 1970s During the 1970s the bootleg industry in the United States expanded rapidly, coinciding with the era of stadium rock or arena rock. Vast numbers of recordings were issued for profit by bootleg labels such as Kornyfone and TMQ. The large followings of rock artists created a lucrative market for the mass production of unofficial recordings on vinyl, as it became evident that more and more fans were willing to purchase them. In addition, the huge crowds which turned up to these concerts made the effective policing of the audience for the presence of covert recording equipment difficult. Led Zeppelin quickly became a popular target for bootleggers on the strength and frequency of their live concerts; Live on Blueberry Hill, recorded at the LA Forum in 1970, was sufficiently successful to incur the wrath of manager Peter Grant. Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band recorded numerous concerts for radio broadcast in the 1970s, which resulted in many Springsteen bootlegs. The Pink Floyd bootleg The Dark Side of the Moo collected early singles and B-sides. When released, it was the only way to hear the studio version of \\"Astronomy Domine\\" in the U.S, as it was not included on the U.S. issue of The Piper at the Gates of Dawn Some bootleggers noticed rock fans that had grown up with the music in the 1960s wanted rare or unreleased recordings of bands that had split up and looked unlikely to reform. For instance, the release of Golden Eggs, a bootleg of outtakes by The Yardbirds had proven to be so popular that the bootlegger had managed to interview the band's Keith Relf for the sequel, More Golden Eggs. Archive live performances became popular; a 1970 release of Dylan's set with the Hawks (later to become The Band) at the Manchester Free Trade Hall in 1966 (incorrectly assumed to be the Royal Albert Hall for years) was critically and commercially successful owing to the good sound quality and the concert's historical importance. In Los Angeles there were a number of record mastering and pressing plants that were not \\"first in line\\" to press records for the major labels, usually only getting work when the larger plants were overloaded. These pressing plants were more than happy to generate income by pressing bootlegs of dubious legality. Sometimes they simply hid the bootleg work when record company executives would come around (in which case the printed label could show the artist and song names) and other times secrecy required labels with fictitious names. For example, a 1974 Pink Floyd bootleg called Brain Damage was released under the name The Screaming Abadabs, which was one of the band's early names. Because of their ability to get records and covers pressed unquestioned by these pressing plants, bootleggers were able to produce artwork and packaging that a commercial label would be unlikely to issue ‚Äì perhaps most notoriously the 1962 recording of The Beatles at the Star Club in Hamburg, which was bootlegged as The Beatles vs. the Third Reich (a parody of the early US album The Beatles vs. the Four Seasons), or Elvis' Greatest Shit, a collection of the least successful of Elvis Presley's recordings, mostly from film soundtracks. Bootleg collectors in this era generally relied on Hot Wacks, an annual underground magazine listing known bootlegs and information about recent releases. It provided the true information on bootlegs with fictitious labels, and included details on artists and track listings, as well as the source and sound quality of the various recordings. Initially, knowledge of bootlegs and where to purchase them spread by word of mouth. The pioneering bootlegger Rubber Dubber sent copies of his bootleg recordings of live performances to magazines such as Rolling Stone in an attempt to get them reviewed. When Dylan's record company, Columbia Records objected, Rubber Dubber counteracted he was simply putting fans in touch with the music without the intermediary of a record company. Throughout the 1970s most bootleg records were of poor quality, with many of the album covers consisting of nothing more than cheap photocopies. The packaging became more sophisticated towards the end of the decade and continued into the 1980s. Punk rock saw a brief entry into the bootleg market in the 1970s, particularly the bootleg Spunk, a series of outtakes by the Sex Pistols. It received a good review from Sounds Chas de Whalley, who said it was an album \\"no self-respecting rock fan would turn his nose up\\" at. 1980s Black Album by Prince was withdrawn from sale shortly before its official release date in December 1987, becoming a popular bootleg. The 1980s saw the increased use of audio cassettes and videotapes for the dissemination of bootleg recordings, as the affordability of private dubbing equipment made the production of multiple copies significantly easier. Cassettes were also smaller, easier to ship, and could be sold or traded more affordably than vinyl. Cassette culture and tape trading, propelled by the DIY ethic of the punk subculture, relied on an honor system where people who received tapes from fellow traders made multiple copies to pass on to others within the community. For a while, stalls at major music gatherings such as the Glastonbury Festival sold mass copies of bootleg soundboard recordings of bands who, in many cases, had played only a matter of hours beforehand. However, officials soon began to counteract this illegal activity by making raids on the stalls and, by the end of the 1980s, the number of festival bootlegs had consequently dwindled. One of the most critically acclaimed bootlegs from the 1980s is The Black Album by Prince. The album was to have been a conventional major-label release in late 1987, but on 1 December, immediately before release, Prince decided to pull the album, requiring 500,000 copies to be destroyed. A few advance copies had already shipped, which were used to create bootlegs. This eventually led to the album's official release. Towards the end of the 1980s, the Ultra Rare Trax series of bootlegs, featuring studio outtakes of the Beatles, showed that digital remastering onto compact disc could produce a high-quality product that was comparable with official studio releases. 1990s‚Äìpresent Following the success of Ultra Rare Trax, the 1990s saw an increased production of bootleg CDs, including reissues of shows that had been recorded decades previously. In particular, companies in Germany and Italy exploited the more relaxed copyright laws in those countries by pressing large numbers of CDs and including catalogs of other titles on the inlays, making it easier for fans to find and order shows direct. Similarly, relaxed copyright laws in Australia meant that the most serious legal challenge to unauthorised releases were made on the grounds of trademark law by Sony Music Entertainment in 1993. Court findings were in favour of allowing the release of unauthorised recordings clearly marked as \\"unauthorised\\". The updated GATT 1994 agreement soon closed this so-called \\"protection gap\\" in all three aforementioned countries effective 1 January 1995. By this time, the internet had increased in popularity, and bootleg review sites began to appear. The quality control of bootlegs began to be scrutinised, as a negative review of one could adversely harm sales. Bootlegs began to increase in size, with multi-CD packages being common. In 1999, a 4-CD set was released containing three and a half hours of recording sessions for the Beach Boys' \\"Good Vibrations\\", spanning seven months. The tightening of laws and increased enforcement by police on behalf of the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and other industry groups‚Äîoften for peripheral issues such as tax evasion‚Äîgradually drove the distributors of for-profit vinyl and CD bootlegs further underground. Physical bootlegging largely shifted to countries with laxer copyright laws, with the results distributed through existing underground channels, open-market sites such as eBay, and other specialised websites. By the end of the decade, eBay had forbidden bootlegs. The late 1990s saw an increase in the free trading of digital bootlegs, sharply decreasing the demand for and profitability of physical bootlegs. The rise of audio file formats such as MP3 and Real Audio, combined with the ability to share files between computers via the internet, made it simpler for collectors to exchange bootlegs. The arrival of Napster in 1999 made it easy to share bootlegs over a large computer network. Older analog recordings were converted to digital format, tracks from bootleg CDs were ripped to computer hard disks, and new material was created with digital recording of various types; all of these types could now be easily shared. Instead of album-length collections or live recordings of entire shows, fans often now had the option of searching for and downloading bootlegs of songs.Jordan, Keith. \\"T'Internet ‚Äì A Bootleg Fan's Paradise \\" ‚Äì The Past, Present and Future of Bootlegs considering the internet. NPF Magazine. November 2006. Artists had a mixed reaction to online bootleg sharing; Bob Dylan allowed fans to download archive recordings from his official website, while King Crimson's Robert Fripp and Metallica were strongly critical of the ease with which Napster circumvented traditional channels of royalty payments. The rise in popularity of the video sharing website YouTube has made it a major carrier of bootleg recordings. YouTube's owner, Google, believes that under the \\"safe-harbor\\" provision of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), it cannot be held responsible for content, allowing bootleg media to be hosted on it without fear of a lawsuit. As the technology to host videos is open and available, shutting down YouTube may simply mean the content migrates elsewhere. An audience recording of one of David Bowie's last concerts before he retired from touring in 2004 was uploaded to YouTube and received a positive review in Rolling Stone. In 2010, YouTube removed a 15-minute limit on videos, allowing entire concerts to be uploaded. Copyright The Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works has protected the copyrights on literary, scientific, and artistic works since 1886. Article 9 of the Convention states that: Authors of literary and artistic works protected by this Convention shall have the exclusive right of authorising the reproduction of these works, in any manner or form. ... Any sound or visual recording shall be considered as a reproduction for the purposes of this Convention. This means a composer has performing rights and control over how derivative works should be used, and the rights are retained at least 50 years after death, or even longer. Even if a song is a traditional arrangement in the public domain, performing rights can still be violated. Where they exist, performers rights may have a shorter duration than full copyright; for example, the Rome Convention sets a minimum term of twenty years after the performance. This created a market for bootleg CDs in the late 1980s, containing 1960s recordings. In the US, bootlegs had been a grey area in legality, but the 1976 Copyright Act extended copyright protection to all recordings, including \\"all misappropriated recordings, both counterfeit and pirate\\". This meant bootleggers would take a much greater risk, and several were arrested. Bootlegs have been prohibited by federal law (17 USC 1101) since the introduction of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (URAA, PL 103-465) in 1994, as well as by state law. The federal bootleg statute does not pre-empt state laws, which also apply both prior to and since the passage of the federal bootleg statute. The US v. Martignon case challenged the constitutionality of the federal bootleg statute, and in 2004, U.S. District Judge Harold Baer Jr. struck down the port banning the sale of bootleg recordings of live music, ruling that the law unfairly grants a seemingly perpetual copyright period to the original performances. In 2007, Judge Baer's ruling was overruled, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit found that the anti-bootlegging statute was within the power of Congress.US v. Martignon, 492 F. 3d 140 (2d Cir. 2007). Official releases Bruce Springsteen has mixed feelings over bootlegs of his popular live performances. Record companies have described bootlegs as \\"grey area, live recordings\\", describing them as \\"semi-condoned\\". Research into bootleg consumers found that they are committed fans of the artist; a study of Bruce Springsteen fans showed 80% felt some bootlegs were essential purchases despite owning every official release. Springsteen has said he understands why fans buy bootlegs, but dislikes the market due to the lack of quality control and making profit over pleasing fans. Frank Zappa hated bootlegs and wished to control his recordings, so he created the Beat The Boots boxed sets, each containing eight LPs that were direct copies of existing bootlegs. He set up a hotline for fans to report bootlegs and was frustrated that the FBI were not interested in prosecuting. The first set included As An Am Zappa, in which he can be heard complaining about bootleggers releasing new material before he could. Throughout their career, the Grateful Dead were known to tolerate taping of the live shows. There was a demand from fans to hear the improvisations that resulted from each show, and taping appealed to the band's general community ethos. They were unique among bands in that their live shows tended not to be pressed and packaged as LPs, but remained in tape form to be shared between tapers. The group were strongly opposed to commercial bootlegging and policed stores that sold them, while the saturation of tapes among fans suppressed any demand for product. In 1985, the Grateful Dead, after years of tolerance, officially endorsed live taping of their shows, and set up dedicated areas that they believed gave the best sound recording quality. Other bands, including Pearl Jam, Phish and the Dave Matthews Band tolerate taping in a similar manner to the Grateful Dead, provided no profit is involved. Because of the questionable legality of bootlegs, fans have sometimes simply dubbed a bootleg onto tape and freely passed it onto others. Many recordings first distributed as bootleg albums were later released officially by the copyright holder. Provided the official release matches the quality of the bootleg, demand for the latter can be suppressed. One of the first rock bootlegs, containing John Lennon's performance with the Plastic Ono Band at the 1969 Toronto Rock and Roll Revival, was released officially as Live Peace in Toronto 1969 by the end of the year, effectively killing sales of the bootleg. The release of Bob Dylan's 1966 Royal Albert Hall concert on Vol. 4 of his Bootleg Series in 1998 included both the acoustic and electric sets, more than any bootleg had done. In 2002, Dave Matthews Band released Busted Stuff in response to the Internet-fuelled success of The Lillywhite Sessions which they had not intended to release. Queen released 100 bootlegs for sale as downloads on the band's official website, with profits going to the Mercury Phoenix Trust. Although the recording of concerts by King Crimson and its guitarist Robert Fripp is prohibited, Fripp's music company Discipline Global Mobile (DGM) sells concert recordings as downloads, especially \\"archival recordings\\" produced from the recordings from the concerts' mixing consoles. With an even greater investment of sound engineering, DGM has released \\"official bootlegs\\", which are produced from one or more fan bootlegs.: DGM's reverse engineering of the distribution-networks for bootlegs helped it to make a successful transition to an age of digital distribution, \\"unique\\" (in 2009) among music labels. In the 21st century, artists responded to the demand for recordings of live shows by experimenting with the sale of authorized bootlegs made directly from the soundboard, with a superior quality to an audience recording. Metallica, Phish and Pearl Jam have been regularly distributing instant live bootlegs of their concerts. In 2014, Bruce Springsteen announced he would allow fans to purchase a USB stick at concerts, which could be used to download a bootleg of the show. According to a 2012 report in Rolling Stone, many artists have now concluded that the volume of bootlegged performances on YouTube in particular is so large that it is counterproductive to enforce it, and they should use it as a marketing tool instead. Music lawyer Josh Grier has said \\"Most of the artists have kind of conceded to it.\\" Justin Bieber has embraced the distribution of video clips via Twitter in order to increase his fanbase.

He served on the Minnesota Territorial Council, in the Minnesota Constitutional Convention, and on the Minnesota territorial and state supreme courts. He was also an associate justice on the Minnesota Supreme Court. During the Dakota War, Flandrau enlisted in the Union Army and was commissioned as a captain in 1862 to raise a force to defend settlers at New Ulm. Given his success, the governor appointed him to lead the defense of southwest Minnesota, at the rank of colonel. After unsuccessfully campaigning for a couple of positions, Flandrau moved in 1870 to St. Paul, where he had a law partnership with two men until his death in 1903. Early life Flandrau was born in 1828 in New York City. His father was Thomas Hunt Flandrau of New Rochelle, New York, an attorney and law partner of Aaron Burr. His mother was Elizabeth Maria Macomb, a daughter of Alexander Macomb, the wealthy New York merchant, and his wife; and half-sister of Alexander Macomb (1782-1841). Her brother became a career officer, general and hero of the War of 1812; afterward he was appointed as head of the United States Army. The Flandraus were descendants of Jacques Flandreau, a French Huguenot who came to New Rochelle in the 1690s. The spelling of their name was influenced by successive Dutch and English settlement in the region. Flandrau was educated in Georgetown, then a separate community in the District of Columbia, until the age of 13, when he tried to enlist in the Navy. Too young to obtain an appointment, he spent three years as a common sailor under other services. In 1844, tiring of the sea, he worked for three years in the mahogany trade in New York City. He rejoined his family, then living in Whitesboro, New York, and apprenticed to \\"read the law\\" in his father's law practice. Flandrau passed the bar in 1851 and joined his father's firm as partner. Career In 1853, Flandrau relocated to Traverse des Sioux, Minnesota to practice law. During the 1850s, he served on the Minnesota Territorial Council, in the Minnesota Constitutional Convention, and on the Minnesota territorial and state supreme courts. He was also appointed as U.S. Agent for the Sioux in 1856; in this region they were Dakota people. In August 1862, learning of a violent Dakota uprising in the southwestern corner of the state (caused largely by the federal government's failure to deliver annuities in goods and payments on time, and resulting in the Dakota starving), Flandrau enlisted in the Union Army as a captain. He assembled an armed force and quickly went to the defense of settlers at New Ulm. Both Flandrau State Park and the community of Flandreau, South Dakota, are named in his honor, as he was successful in defending the community. Governor Alexander Ramsey appointed Flandrau in charge of the defense of the southwestern frontier of the state, and he served in this capacity at the rank of colonel for two years, simultaneous to his position on the Minnesota Supreme Court. In 1864 Flandrau resigned from both positions and moved to Nevada to practice law. He returned to Minneapolis within a year to practice law with Isaac Atwater. In 1867, he ran as the Democratic candidate for governor but was defeated by William Rainey Marshall. In 1869 he ran for chief justice of the Minnesota Supreme Court, but was again defeated. In 1870 he moved to St. Paul, Minnesota, where he began a legal partnership with Horace R. Bigelow and Greenleaf Clark. He worked with them until his death in 1903. Personal life Judge Flandrau was married twice. His first marriage was on August 10, 1859 to his first cousin, Isabella Dinsmore of Kentucky, the daughter of Martha Macomb and James Dinsmore. The couple had two daughters, Martha Macomb and Sarah Gibson Flandrau, before Isabella died in 1867. Martha married Tilden Russell Selmes; their daughter, Isabella Selmes, became the first female congresswoman from Arizona, known by her married name of Isabella Greenway. Flandrau married again to Rebecca B. Riddle, a widow and daughter of Judge William McClure and his wife of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. They had two sons. Charles Macomb Flandrau became a noted author, writing stories and a novel about college life, as well as short stories published in leading magazines of the day, such as The Saturday Evening Post. Their second son William Blair McClure Flandrau in the early 1900s had a coffee plantation in Mexico. William married Grace Hodgson. She was nineteen when she first met his brother and author Charles, then 38, who served as a mentor when she first started writing. She became a popular author who was financially successful. Grace Flandrau left money in her will to a variety of institutions, including the University of Arizona, which named Flandrau Science Center for her.

The law does not concern private, non-commercial communications, such as non-commercial web publications by private bodies. It does not concern books, films, public speeches, and other forms of communications not constituting commercial activity. However, the law mandates the use of the French language in all broadcast audiovisual programs, with exceptions for musical works and \\"original version\\" films.See Television Regulation in France a 2005 report sponsored by the Open Society Institute. Broadcast musical works are subject to quota rules under a related law whereby a minimum percentage of the songs on radio and television must be in the French language. The law takes its common name from Jacques Toubon, who was Minister of Culture when it was passed, and who proposed the law to the National Assembly of France. A nickname is Loi Allgood - \\"Allgood\\" is a morpheme-for-morpheme translation of \\"Toubon\\" into English (\\"All Good\\" being a translation of \\"Tout bon\\") - as the law can largely be considered to have been enacted in reaction to the increasing usage of English in advertisements and other areas in France. As the law sought to strengthen French as the dominant language within the countries and her territories, the law also ‚Äòcame under considerable attack from the European Commission which regarded its provisions as particularly offensive to the concept of free competition across national borders.‚Äô Provisions of the law One broad provision of the law applying to workplaces is that \\"any document that contains obligations for the employee or provisions whose knowledge is necessary for the performance of one's work must be written in French.\\" Among other things, this means that computer software developed outside France must have its user interface and instruction manuals translated into French to be legally used by companies in France. The law includes an exception that \\"these provisions do not apply to documents coming from abroad\\", but this exception has been interpreted narrowly by the appellate courts. For example, in 2006 a French subsidiary of a US company was given a hefty fine for delivering certain highly technical documents and software interfaces to its employees in the English language only, and this was upheld by the appellate court.Ruling from the Versailles Court of Appeal, 2 March 2006 Another broad provision of the law is that it makes it mandatory for commercial advertisements and public announcements to be given in French. This does not rule out advertisements made in a foreign language: it is sufficient to provide a translation in a footnote. This was justified as a measure for the protection of the consumer. Additionally, product packaging must be in French, though, again, translation in multiple languages can be provided. A similar restriction‚Äîthough implemented by primary legislation regulations and not as application of the Loi Toubon‚Äîapplies to product labeling: product labels should be intelligible and in French, though additional languages may be present.Code de la consommation R112-8 Some linguistic restrictions on product labeling were found to be incompatible with European law,Ruling C-366-98 of 12 September 2000, Court of Justice of the European Communities particularly the directives concerning the freedom of movement of goods within the European Union. The French government then issued interpretation notes and amended regulations in order to comply.Marc Frangi, Le consommateur fran√ßais entre loi Toubon et droit communautaire, Revue internationale de droit √©conomique, De Boeck Universit√©, t. XVII, 1 2003/1, pp. 135-144, , In another provision, the law specifies obligations for public legal persons (government administrations, et al.), mandating the use of French in publications, or at least in summaries of publications. In France, it is a constitutional requirement that the public should be informed of the action of the government. Since the official language of France is French, it follows that the French public should be able to get official information in French. Under the Toubon law, schools that do not use French as the medium of instruction are ineligible for government funding. This excludes the Breton language schools of Brittany.See Breton language for a summary of the Toubon Law's impact on the Breton language.Ruling 238653 of 29 November 2002 from the Council of State: 50/50 French/Breton education cannot be publicly funded. Other restrictions concern the use of French in academic conferences. These are largely ignored by many public institutions, especially in the \\"hard\\" scientific fields.Question from senator Danielle Bidard-Reydet and answer by the Minister of Research Hubert Curien, 1991: the conclusion of a commission of the French Academy of Sciences is that enforcing the use of French in scientific conferences, through the use of simultaneous translations, would be not only costly but useless, and would damage the reputation of France among the international scientific community. The Ministry thus does not envision coercive measures, which would have the result of reducing the number of internal scientific conferences in France. Thus, the use of simultaneous translation is recommended (not impose).2008 Report from the General delegation to French language to Parliament, pp. 33-39. The National Centre for Scientific Research indicates that strict observance of the law would pose considerable problems. Page 39: 78% of research laboratories have organized or co-organized seminars, in France during the 2006-2007 school year. Out of that number, 62% organized sittings that took place essentially in a foreign language: 47% in humanities and social sciences, 71% in exact sciences. The operators indicated that sometimes sittings took place in a foreign language even though all participants were francophone. This situation took place within 35% of relevant laboratories (thus 16% of all laboratories), in approximately the same proportion in exact sciences and humanities and social sciences. The original restrictions on colloquia also applied to private bodies, but that was found unconstitutional prior to enactment,Constitutional Council, 94-345 DC on grounds that they violated freedom of speech, and the final form of the law was modified accordingly. Enforcement against French subsidiaries of US-based organizations In the mid-1990s, soon after the Toubon Law came into force, two French lobbying groups‚Äîthe Association pour la D√©fense de la Langue Fran√ßaise and the L'Avenir de la Langue Fran√ßaise‚Äîfiled a complaint against Georgia Tech Lorraine, the Metz campus of the Georgia Institute of Technology. At the time of the complaint, all classes at this Lorraine school were conducted in English, and all course descriptions on its French Internet web site were in English only. The complaint invoked the Toubon Law to demand that the school's web site must be in French because the web site was effectively a commercial advertisement for the school's courses. Although the case was dismissed by the court on a minor legal technicality, and the lobbying groups chose to drop the matter, the school was moved to offer its French website in the French language in addition to English, although classes continued to be in English only.See Georgia Tech Lorraine website today. In 2006, the French subsidiary of the US company General Electric Medical Systems was fined ‚Ç¨500,000 plus an ongoing fine of ‚Ç¨20,000 per day for not complying with the Toubon law.

More complex versions involve multiple offensive linemen moving with the quarterback to block and multiple false hand offs; one such variation is known as a rollout. After escaping the area behind the offensive line, the quarterback may either throw a pass downfield or run with the ball himself to gain yardage. A bootleg is called to confuse the defense, by moving the quarterback away from where they expect him to be, directly behind the center. The quarterback's motion may also attract the attention of the defensive backs, allowing one of the receivers to become uncovered. The play is typically used by teams with mobile quarterbacks, such as Steve Young, Randall Cunningham and Russell Wilson. Additional variations can be combined with bootleg plays. In the West Coast offense variant designed around quarterback Michael Vick, counter techniques combined with play action bootleg plays served to provide several types of simultaneous misdirection which caused defensive players to freeze after often misjudging the intended direction of the play. These techniques, along with Vick's unusual athleticism, slow down and isolate defenders and provide extra space and time for the quarterback to survey the field and/or run the ball. The bootleg and its variants have become more common in recent years as the rules have been changed to permit a quarterback to avoid a sack by throwing the ball away once he/she is outside the \\"tackle box\\". Since the quarterback in a bootleg usually sets up to throw well outside the tackles, if he/she is in danger of taking a sack he/she can throw the ball safely out of bounds without risking an intentional grounding penalty. The name comes from the fact that on a play action the quarterback often hides the ball from the defense by his thigh to make the run look more convincing. This is similar to the way bootleggers would hide whiskey in their trousers during Prohibition. Pop Warner is given credit for inventing the bootleg play.Powers, Francis J.

A logic error produces unintended or undesired output or other behaviour, although it may not immediately be recognized as such. Logic errors occur in both compiled and interpreted languages. Unlike a program with a syntax error, a program with a logic error is a valid program in the language, though it does not behave as intended. Often the only clue to the existence of logic errors is the production of wrong solutions, though static analysis may sometimes spot them. Debugging logic errors One of the ways to find this type of error is to put out the program's variables to a file or on the screen in order to determine the error's location in code. Although this will not work in all cases, for example when calling the wrong subroutine, it is the easiest way to find the problem if the program uses the incorrect results of a bad mathematical calculation. Examples This example function in C to calculate the average of two numbers contains a logic error. It is missing parentheses in the calculation, so it compiles and runs but does not give the expected answer due to operator precedence (division is evaluated before addition). float average(float a, float b) { return a + b / 2; /* should be (a + b) / 2 */ } See also *Syntax error *Off-by-one error Category:Computer errors Category:Programming language theory bg:–õ–æ–≥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∞ –≥—Ä–µ—à–∫–∞ de:Logischer Fehler ","title":"Logic error"},{"id":"1488084","text":"Sm√°ralind () is a shopping mall located in the Capital Region of Iceland.

The Basilikon Doron is a treatise on government written by King James VI of Scotland (who would later become, as well, James I of England), in 1599. Background Basilikon Doron (ŒíŒ±œÉŒπŒªŒπŒ∫·Ω∏ŒΩ Œî·ø∂œÅŒøŒΩ) means \\"royal gift\\" Ancient Greek and was written in the form of a private letter to James's eldest son, Henry, Duke of Rothesay (1594-1612). After Henry‚Äôs death, James gave it to his second son, Charles, born 1600, later King Charles I. Seven copies were printed in Edinburgh in 1599, and it was republished in London in 1603, when it sold in the thousands. Content This document is separated into three books, serving as general guidelines to follow to be an efficient monarch. The first describes a king‚Äôs duty towards God as a Christian. The second focuses on the roles and responsibilities in office. The third concerns proper behaviour in daily life. As the first part is concerned with being a good Christian, James instructed his son to love and respect God as well as to fear Him. Furthermore, it is essential to carefully study the Scripture (the Bible) and especially specific books in both the Old and New Testaments. Lastly, he must pray often and always be thankful for what God has given him. In the second book, James encouraged his son to be a good king, as opposed to a tyrant, by establishing and executing laws as well as governing with justice and equality, such as by boosting the economy. It is important to invite foreign merchants into the country and to base the currency on gold and silver. Likewise, according to James, * A good monarch must be well acquainted with his subjects and so it would be wise to visit each of the kingdoms every three years. * During war, he should choose old but good captains to lead an army of young and agile soldiers. * In the court and the household, he should carefully select loyal gentlemen and servants to surround him. When the time came to choose a wife, it would be best if she were of the same religion and had a generous estate. However, she must not meddle with governmental politics but perform her domestic duties. * As for inheritance, to ensure stability, the kingdom should be left to the eldest son, not divided among all children. * Lastly, it is most important to James that his son would know well his own craft, which is to properly govern over his subjects. To do so, he must study the laws of his kingdom and actively participate in the Council. * Furthermore, he must be acquainted with mathematics, military purposes and world history for foreign policy. The final portion of the Basilikon Doron focuses on the daily life of a monarch. For instance, James advised his son to eat meat to be strong for traveling, and during wartime. * He must also not drink and sleep excessively. * Furthermore, his wardrobe should always be clean and proper, and he must never let his hair and nails grow long. * In his writing and speech, he should use honest and plain language. All of these guidelines composed an underlying code of conduct to be followed by all monarchs and heads of state to rule and govern efficiently. James assembled these directions as a result of his own experience and upbringing. He, therefore, offered the Basilikon Doron to his son with the hope of rendering him a capable ruler and perhaps to pass it down to future generations. Overall, it repeats the argument for the divine right of kings, as set out in The True Law of Free Monarchies, which was also written by James. It warns against \\"Papists\\" and derides Puritans, in keeping with his philosophy of following a \\"middle path\\", which is also reflected in the preface to the 1611 King James Bible. It also advocates removing the Apocrypha from the Bible. Publication The published Basilikon Doron may well have been intended to portray the king in a favourable light. James Sempill assisted James in composing it. Robert Waldegrave, who was bound to secrecy, printed seven copies at the king's behest. Henry Taylor said that he had printed it on Waldegrave's press. Richard Royston and then William Dugard printed further copies.

The economists Richard Lipsey and Kelvin Lancaster showed in 1956, that if one optimality condition in an economic model cannot be satisfied, it is possible that the next-best solution involves changing other variables away from the values that would otherwise be optimal. Politically, the theory implies that if it is infeasible to remove a particular market distortion, introducing a second (or more) market distortion in an interdependent market may partially counteract the first, and lead to a more efficient outcome. Implications In an economy with some uncorrectable market failure in one sector, actions to correct market failures in another related sector with the intent of increasing economic efficiency may actually decrease overall economic efficiency. In theory, at least, it may be better to let two market imperfections cancel each other out rather than making an effort to fix either one. Thus, it may be optimal for the government to intervene in a way that is contrary to usual policy. This suggests that economists need to study the details of the situation before jumping to the theory-based conclusion that an improvement in market perfection in one area implies a global improvement in efficiency. Application Even though the theory of the second best was developed for the Walrasian general equilibrium system, it also applies to partial equilibrium cases. For example, consider a mining monopoly that is also a polluter: mining leads to tailings being dumped in the river and deadly dust in the workers‚Äô lungs. Suppose in addition that there is nothing at all that can be done about the pollution without also reducing production. However, the government is able to break up the monopoly. The problem here is that increasing competition in this market is likely to increase production (since monopolists restrict production). Because pollution is highly associated with production, pollution will most likely increase. Thus, it is not clear that eliminating the monopoly increases efficiency. Gains from trade in the mined mineral will increase, but externalities from pollution will increase as well, possibly outweighing the gains from trade.

While other art forms, such as architecture and poetry existed in the context of the debate, painting and sculpture were the two art forms that the debate was primarily focused on. The debate extends beyond the fifteenth century and even influences the discussion and interpretation of artworks that may or may not have been influenced by the debate itself. A comparable question, generally posed less competitively, was known as ut pictura poesis (a quote from Horace), comparing the qualities of painting and poetry.  The debate  The debate began around the 15th century. Leonardo da Vinci's treatise on painting, observing the difficulty of painting and supremacy of sight, is a notable example of literature on the subject. Bendetto Varchi further sparked the conversation between well-known artists in 1546 by sending out letters inciting opinions. Painters and sculptors each vied for their respective side in the debate. Michelangelo was notable as the only artist who offered support for both mediums. However, he was also found to be less invested in the discussion despite his contributions. The essence of the debate had many facets. Comparisons of the two mediums ranged from conceptual themes to practices, underscoring the intellectual role of the artist in renaissance society. Geralamo Salvado's Gaston de la Foix Each medium had multiple points in support of it. Much of the debate lacked specific examples of supporting work, though the ideas were extensively discussed. Giorgio Vasari argued that drawing is the father of all arts, and as such, the most important one. Sculpture was typically claimed to be the only method of having several different and faithful views of the same figure by those who found it to be the more superior medium. A counterpoint to this argument was made in paintings which feature reflective objects or surfaces, such as the Portrait of Gaston de la Foix by Gerolamo Savoldo, which featured mirrors surrounding the key figure. This allowed figures not only to be viewed at multiple angles, but for these to be seen at the same time, which is an ability that sculpture is incapable of providing. Many paintings with this concept are brought into the discussion of paragone, but it is unclear how many were actually made as a response to the debate itself. A large portion of the discussion was centered around the idea of imitation of the natural world. Painting was seen to create an inferior imitation because it lacked form. This argument was later championed by the example of a blind man experiencing art. Theoretically, he could gather how a sculpture was structured through touch, but were he to touch a painting he would not be able to construct an image of the work, thus rendering painting an illusionary form of art. Another side of the debate that arose is one of technical skill. Michelangelo did not take a clear side in the debates, but did underscore a component which he believed to be essential to both painting and sculpture, called disegno. Disegno in Renaissance times largely referred to \\"the conception of a work.\\" The understanding and use of the term was also, however, influenced by the idea of drawing as the foundation of art. Vasari and with Benvenuto Cellini, also asserted that the ability to render an accurate contour line were technical skills that benefited both painting and sculpture.

A playground roundabout (or merry-go- round) is a flat disk, frequently about in diameter, with bars on it that act as both hand-holds and something to lean against while riding. The disk can be made to spin by pushing or pulling on its handles, either by running around the outside, or by pulling and re-grabbing as it spins, from a stationary stance. Often found in school playgrounds and public parks, they offer riders (typically children) a dizzying ride when either others spin the wheel, or by spinning it themselves by running around it, and then jumping on. People may take turns between riding and spinning. One type of roundabout which differs significantly in terms of how the rotary motion is provided is a Swedish device called the HAGS Pedal Roundabout, which resembles four small exercise bikes attached to a tubular steel ring, which travel on a circular steel rail on the ground. The ring is attached to a vertical pole in the center by four spokes. There is a driving wheel hidden under the casing of each of the \\"exercise bikes\\" (the casings prevent toes being run over) and the roundabout is turned by the pedaling action of the riders.thumbA simplified drawing of various older types of roundabout to be found in British playgrounds Both \\"roundabout\\" and \\"merry-go-round\\" are also often synonyms for carousel. The playground roundabout is a simplified version of a fairground carousel. The roundabout uses rotary motion, which means it spins around in a circle either clockwise or counter-clockwise. Innovation An inventor, Ronnie Stuiver, devised a pump powered by a turning children's roundabout, which premiered at an agricultural show in KwaZulu-Natal in 1989.http://www.mediaclubsouthafrica.com/land-and-people/549-tapping-into- ingenuity010708 This device is known as the Roundabout PlayPump. There are about 600 PlayPumps in South Africa, intended to provide clean drinking water to about one million impoverished people. Several issues have been raised about the effectiveness of using such a pump as a power source given how consistent the need for water is, thereby turning children into a source of manual labor. Additionally, it has been noted that the problem for water infrastructure is often not the ability to pump ground water that pools close to the surface, but the limited availability of groundwater itself. UNICEF has released a comprehensive report on the current status of the PlayPump project.http://www- tc.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/southernafrica904/flash/pdf/unicef_pp_report.pdf Benefits Roundabout play provides several benefits to children. This equipment can help children with autism increase vestibular stimulation, can increase development of kinaesthetic awareness and can help children develop strength, coordination, and balance.

He oversaw the development of the system from his home in Shizuoka, Japan, where his dojo, the Yoseikan, was often visited by martial arts practitioners from all over the world.  Early life  On April 7, 1907, Mochizuki was born in Shizuoka, Japan. Mochizuki, began by training in kendo at the age of five, at his grandfather's dojo in Shizuoka.  Career  In 1925, Mochizuki began judo and joined the Kodokan where he became an outstanding competitor. Under the tutelage of Jigoro Kano, the founder of judo, as well as the renowned Sanpo Toku, Mochizuki became the youngest member of the Kobudo Kenkyukai ‚Äì an organization for the study, preservation and development of classical martial arts ‚Äì established within the Kodokan.Aikido Journal, Kodokan.

He spent eight years in Mongolia where he was an active educator and entrepreneur of projects to improve communications and irrigation. His idea of combating communism with the application of the principles of \\"mutual welfare and prosperity\\" and of \\"the best use of energy\\" of Jigoro Kano contributed to the development of his region.

The first states that a market in equilibrium under perfect competition will be Pareto optimal in the sense that no further exchange would make one person better off without making another worse off. The requirements for perfect competition are these:http://web.stanford.edu/~hammond/effMktFail.pdf # There are no externalitiesie. firms can‚Äôt pass their costs onto other people without their consent. and no transaction costs, and each actor has perfect information. # Firms take prices ‚Äì ie. behavior is competitive rather than monopolistic. The theorem is sometimes seen as an analytical confirmation of Adam Smith's \\"invisible hand\\" principle, namely that competitive markets ensure an efficient allocation of resources in the short run.That they may fail to do so in the long run is shown by an observation of Harold Hotelling: see below. It supports a case for non-intervention in ideal conditions, saying that if we let the markets do the work, the outcome will be Pareto efficient. However Pareto efficiency is not a true social welfare function. There are many alternative Pareto efficient allocations of resources differing in their desirability, eg. one person may own everything and everyone else nothing. The first theorem suggests that intervention may have a legitimate place in policy. This leads to the second theorem, which tells us that a Pareto optimum can fall short of a given true optimum only in its distributional effects, implying that a true social optimum might be obtained by redistributing income and then letting the market take over. However attempts to correct the distribution may introduce distortions of their own, so full optimality may not be attainable.See the discussion on pp. 556 f of Mas-Colell et al. The theorems can be visualised graphically for a simple pure exchange economy by means of the Edgeworth box diagram.

Edgeworth (1881)  Edgeworth took a step towards the first fundamental theorem in his ‚ÄòMathematical Psychics‚Äô, looking at a pure exchange economy with no production. Almost alone amongst economists he includes imperfect competition in its scope, which appears to be correct for his own limited case.Paul Samuelson backed him up, saying that the locus of Paretian optima can be obtained under multilateral monopoly. ‚ÄòFoundations of Economic Analysis‚Äô (1947), p. 214.

Vilfredo Pareto (1906/9)  Pareto stated the first fundamental theorem in his Manuale (1906) and with more rigour in its French revision (Manuel, 1909).Manuale di Economia Politica con una Introduzione alla Scienza Sociale (1906) / Manuel d‚Äô√âconomie Politique (1909). He was the first to claim optimality under his own criterion or to support the claim by convincing arguments. He defines equilibrium more abstractly than Edgeworth as a state which would maintain itself indefinitely in the absence of external pressuresManuale / Manuel Chap III, ¬ß22. and shows that in an exchange economy it is the point at which a common tangent to the parties‚Äô indifference curves passes through the endowment.¬ß116. His definition of optimality is given in Chap.

The following paragraph gives us a theorem: > For phenomena of type I [ie. perfect competition], when equilibrium takes > place at a point of tangency of indifference curves, the members of the > collectivity enjoy a maximum of ophelimity.

A. Samuelson, ‚ÄòFoundations of Economic Analysis‚Äô (1947), p. 212. Pareto was hampered by not having a concept of the production‚Äìpossibility frontier, whose development was due partly to his collaborator Enrico Barone.Thomas M. Humphrey, ‚ÄòThe Trade Theorist‚Äôs Sacred Diagram: its Origin and Early Development‚Äô (1988). His own ‚Äòindifference curves for obstacles‚Äô seem to have been a false path. Shortly after stating the first fundamental theorem, Pareto asks a question about distribution: > Consider a collectivist society which seeks to maximise the ophelimity of > its members. The problem divides into two parts. Firstly we have a problem > of distribution: how should the goods within a society be shared between its > members? And secondly, how should production be organised so that, when > goods are so distributed, the members of society obtain the maximum > ophelimity? His answer is an informal precursor of the second theorem: > Having distributed goods according to the answer to the first problem, the > state should allow the members of the collectivity to operate a second > distribution, or operate it itself, in either case making sure that it is > performed in conformity with the workings of free competition.This and the > preceding quotation have been condensed from ¬ß53 and ¬ß55 of Chap. VI.  Enrico Barone (1908)  Barone, an associate of Pareto, proved an optimality property of perfect competition,E. Barone, ‚ÄòIl Ministro della Produzione nello Stato Colletivistica‚Äô (1908). namely that ‚Äì assuming exogenous prices ‚Äì it maximises the monetary value of the return from productive activity, this being the sum of the values of leisure, savings, and goods for consumption, all taken in the desired proportions.In fact he divides this value by the price of an arbitrarily chosen item, but since prices are assumed fixed this merely introduces an irrelevant asymmetry. He makes no argument that the prices chosen by the market are themselves optimal. His paper wasn‚Äôt translated into English until 1935. It received an approving summary from SamuelsonP. A. Samuelson, ‚ÄòFoundations of Economic Analysis‚Äô (1947), pp. 214‚Äì217. but seems not to have influenced the development of the welfare theorems as they now stand.  Abba Lerner (1934)  In 1934 Lerner restated Edgeworth‚Äôs condition for exchange that indifference curves should meet as tangents, presenting it as an optimality property. He stated a similar condition for production, namely that the production‚Äìpossibility frontier (PPF, to which he gave the alternative name of ‚Äòproductive indifference curve‚Äô) should be tangential with an indifference curve for the community. He was one of the originators of the PPF, having used it in a paper on international trade in 1932.A. Lerner, ‚ÄòThe Diagrammatical Representation of Cost Conditions in International Trade‚Äô (1932), cited in Thomas M. Humphrey, ‚ÄòThe Trade Theorist‚Äôs Sacred Diagram: its Origin and Early Development‚Äô (1988). He shows that the two arguments can be presented in the same terms, since the PPF plays the same role as the mirror-image indifference curve in an Edgeworth box. He also mentions that there‚Äôs no need for the curves to be differentiable, since the same result obtains if they touch at pointed corners. His definition of optimality was equivalent to Pareto‚Äôs: > If... it is possible to move one individual into a preferred position > without moving another individual into a worse position... we may say that > the relative optimum is not reached... The optimality condition for production is equivalent to the pair of requirements that (i) price should equal marginal cost and (ii) output should be maximised subject to (i). Lerner thus reduces optimality to tangency for both production and exchange, but does not say why the implied point on the PPF should be the equilibrium condition for a free market. Perhaps he considered it already sufficiently well established.Eg. ‚ÄòNothing but prime cost [ie. marginal cost] enters necessarily and directly into the supply price for short periods‚Äô: Alfred Marshall, ‚ÄòPrinciples of Economics‚Äô, V.v.6 (eighth ed. consulted). And cf. Knut Wicksell‚Äôs ‚Äòprovisional conclusion that free competition is normally a sufficient condition to ensure maximization of production‚Äô, ‚ÄòLectures on Political Economy‚Äô I (1906), Eng. tr. (1934), p. 141. If so, he was relying on a fairly strong premise.Arguably stronger than his conclusion. A remarkable feature of his paper is its lack of reference to earlier economists. He ascribes to his LSE colleague Victor Edelberg the credit for suggesting the use of indifference curves. Samuelson surmised that Lerner obtained his results independently of Pareto‚Äôs work.P. A. Samuelson, ‚ÄòFoundations of Economic Analysis‚Äô (1947), p. 217.  Harold Hotelling (1938)  Hotelling put forward a new argument to show that ‚Äòsales at marginal costs are a condition of maximum general welfare‚Äô (under Pareto‚Äôs definition). He accepted that this condition was satisfied by perfect competition, but argued in consequence that perfect competition could not be optimal since some beneficial projects would be unable to recoup their fixed costs by charging at this rate.H. Hotelling, ‚ÄòThe General Welfare Problem in Relation to Problems of Taxation and of Railway and Utility rates‚Äô (1938), Econometrica, pp. 260, 267.  Oscar Lange (1942)  Lange‚Äôs paper ‚ÄòThe Foundations of Welfare Economics‚Äô is the source of the now-traditional pairing of two theorems, one governing markets, the other distribution. He justified the Pareto definition of optimality for the first theorem by reference to Lionel Robbins‚Äôs rejection of interpersonal utility comparisons,‚ÄòAll that part of the theory of Public Finance which deals with ‚ÄúSocial Utility‚Äù goes by the board‚Äô: L. Robbins, ‚ÄòAn Essay on the Nature and Significance of Economic Science‚Äô (1932), p. 125\\\\. J. A. King commented that ‚ÄòThis defence of privilege required an unconvincingly solipsistic approach to the problem of comparing the states of mind of different individuals...‚Äô (‚ÄòNicholas Kaldor‚Äô (2009), quoted in a 2011 review by Harvey Gram). and suggested various ways to reintroduce interpersonal comparisons for the second theorem such as the adjudications of a democratically elected Congress. His reasoning is a mathematical translation (into Lagrange multipliers) of Lerner‚Äôs graphical argument. The second theorem does not take its familiar form in his hands; rather he simply shows that the optimisation conditions for a genuine social utility function are similar to those for Pareto optimality.  Abram Bergson and Paul Samuelson (1947)  Samuelson (crediting Abram Bergson for the substance of his ideas) brought Lange‚Äôs second welfare theorem to approximately its modern form.P. A. Samuelson, ‚ÄòFoundations of Economic Analysis‚Äô (1947), pp. 219‚Äì249. He follows Lange in deriving a set of equations which are necessary for Pareto optimality, and then considers what additional constraints arise if the economy is required to satisfy a genuine social welfare function, finding a further set of equations from which it follows ‚Äòthat all of the action necessary to achieve a given ethical desideratum may take the form of lump sum taxes or bounties‚Äô.p. 245. The term ‚Äòlump-sum‚Äô here is obscure. A lump sum is a one-off payment; a lump sum tax is a per capita tax; but he can mean neither of these things since he says that ‚Äòit is not really easy to devise in practice a tax or subsidy which is of a purely lump-sum character'.p. 247. He seems to understand a lump sum as an impossible hybrid which has the distributional properties of a transfer without any distortionary consequences.  Kenneth Arrow and G√©rard Debreu (separately, 1951)  Arrow‚Äôs and Debreu‚Äôs two papersK. Arrow, ‚ÄòAn Extension of the Basic Theorems of Classical Welfare Economics‚Äô (1951); G. Debreu, ‚ÄòThe Coefficient of Resource Utilization‚Äô (1951). (written independently and published almost simultaneously) sought to improve on the rigour of Lange‚Äôs first theorem. Their accounts refer to (short-run) production as well as exhange, expressing the conditions for both through linear functions. Equilibrium for production is expressed by the constraint that the value of a manufacturer‚Äôs net output, ie. the dot product of the production vector with the price vector, should be maximised over the manufacturer‚Äôs production set. This is interpreted as profit maximisation. A firm‚Äôs maximum output, like that of an economy as a whole, will be attained only if an invisible hand leads employees, each seeking his or her own satisfaction, to promote an end which is no part of their intention; so like Lerner, Arrow and Debreu relied on a powerful premise (in their case embodied in definitions) to do much of the work. Equilibrium for exchange is interpreted as meaning that the individual‚Äôs utility should be maximised over the positions obtainable from the endowment through exchange, these being the positions whose value is no greater than the value of his or her endowment, where the value of an allocation is its dot product with the price vector. The concept of equilibrium is thus recast as meaning optimality along a straight price line. This new meaning is given the special name of ‚ÄòWalrasian‚Äô or ‚Äòcompetitive equilibrium‚Äô, and is not a true equilibrium condition in the sense of being a balance of forces. Arrow‚Äôs and Debreu‚Äôs proofs required a change of mathematical style from the calculus to convex set theory. Arrow motivated his paper by reference to the need to extend proofs to cover equilibria at the edge of the space, and Debreu by the possibility of indifference curves being non-differentiable. Modern texts follow their style of proof.  Mas-Colell, Whinston and Green (1995)  Andreu Mas-Colell, Michael Whinston and Jerry Green wrote a textbookMas-Colell et al., ‚ÄòMicroeconomic Theory‚Äô (1995 and subsequent editions). which is nowadays the standard reference for the fundamental theorems. In it they recast the Bergson‚ÄìSamuelson second theorem into the Arrow‚ÄìDebreu formalism, introducing a requirement that the desired end state should be a ‚Äòcompetitive equilibrium‚Äô ‚Äì a condition previously absent which excludes some Pareto optima in the case that indifference curves may be non-convex.They partially redress this limitation in their Proposition 16.G.1 (for which they give no proof). It relies on yet another definition of equilibrium bringing calculus concepts back into consideration. Their account is notable for its authors‚Äô depreciation of the second theorem (described as serving ‚Äòa cautionary purpose‚Äô Mas-Colell et al, op. cit., p 557.) and the weight they attach to the first: > The first fundamental welfare theorem provides... a formal expression of > Adam Smith‚Äôs ‚Äòinvisible hand‚Äô... Under perfectly competitive conditions... > the only possible welfare justification for intervention in the economy is > the fulfillment of distributional objectives.Mas-Colell et al, op. cit., p > 524.  Proof of the first fundamental theorem  The first fundamental theorem holds under general conditions. A formal statement is as follows: If preferences are locally nonsatiated, and if (\\\\mathbf{X^*},\\\\mathbf{Y^*}, \\\\mathbf{p}) is a price equilibrium with transfers, then the allocation (\\\\mathbf{X^*},\\\\mathbf{Y^*})is Pareto optimal. An equilibrium in this sense either relates to an exchange economy only or presupposes that firms are allocatively and productively efficient, which can be shown to follow from perfectly competitive factor and production markets. Given a set G of types of goods we work in the real vector space over G, \\\\mathbb{R}^{G} and use boldface for vector valued variables. For instance, if G=\\\\lbrace \\\\text{butter}, \\\\text{cookies}, \\\\text{milk} \\\\rbrace then \\\\mathbb{R}^{G} would be a three dimensional vector space and the vector \\\\langle 1, 2, 3 \\\\rangle would represent the bundle of goods containing one unit of butter, 2 units of cookies and 3 units of milk. Suppose that consumer i has wealth w_i such that \\\\Sigma_i w_i = \\\\mathbf{p} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{e} + \\\\Sigma _j \\\\mathbf{p} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{y^*_j} where \\\\mathbf{e} is the aggregate endowment of goods (i.e. the sum of all consumer and producer endowments) and \\\\mathbf{y^*_j} is the production of firm j. Preference maximization (from the definition of price equilibrium with transfers) implies (using >_i to denote the preference relation for consumer i): ::if \\\\mathbf{x_i} >_i \\\\mathbf{x^*_i} then \\\\mathbf{p} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{x_i} > \\\\mathbf{w_i} In other words, if a bundle of goods is strictly preferred to \\\\mathbf{x^*_i} it must be unaffordable at price \\\\mathbf{p}. Local nonsatiation additionally implies: ::if \\\\mathbf{x_i} \\\\geq _i \\\\mathbf{x^*_i} then \\\\mathbf{p} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{x_i} \\\\geq \\\\mathbf{w_i} To see why, imagine that \\\\mathbf{x_i} \\\\geq _i \\\\mathbf{x^*_i} but \\\\mathbf{p} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{x_i} < w_i. Then by local nonsatiation we could find \\\\mathbf{x'_i} arbitrarily close to \\\\mathbf{x_i} (and so still affordable) but which is strictly preferred to \\\\mathbf{x^*_i}. But \\\\mathbf{x^*_i} is the result of preference maximization, so this is a contradiction. An allocation is a pair (\\\\mathbf{X},\\\\mathbf{Y}) where \\\\mathbf{X} \\\\in \\\\Pi_{i \\\\in I} \\\\mathbb{R}^{G} and \\\\mathbf{Y} \\\\in \\\\Pi_{j \\\\in J} \\\\mathbb{R}^{G} , i.e. \\\\mathbf{X} is the 'matrix' (allowing potentially infinite rows/columns) whose ith column is the bundle of goods allocated to consumer i and \\\\mathbf{Y} is the 'matrix' whose jth column is the production of firm j. We restrict our attention to feasible allocations which are those allocations in which no consumer sells or producer consumes goods which they lack, i.e.,for every good and every consumer that consumers initial endowment plus their net demand must be positive similarly for producers. Now consider an allocation (\\\\mathbf{X},\\\\mathbf{Y}) that Pareto dominates (\\\\mathbf{X^*}, Y^*). This means that \\\\mathbf{x_i} \\\\geq _i \\\\mathbf{x^*_i} for all i and \\\\mathbf{x_i} >_i \\\\mathbf{x^*_i} for some i. By the above, we know \\\\mathbf{p} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{x_i} \\\\geq w_i for all i and \\\\mathbf{p} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{x_i} > w_i for some i. Summing, we find: ::\\\\Sigma _i \\\\mathbf{p} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{x_i} > \\\\Sigma _i w_i = \\\\Sigma _j \\\\mathbf{p} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{y^*_j}. Because \\\\mathbf{Y^*} is profit maximizing, we know \\\\Sigma _j \\\\mathbf{p} \\\\cdot y^*_j \\\\geq \\\\Sigma _j p \\\\cdot y_j , so \\\\Sigma _i \\\\mathbf{p} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{x_i} > \\\\Sigma _j \\\\mathbf{p} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{y_j}. But goods must be conserved so \\\\Sigma _i \\\\mathbf{x_i} > \\\\Sigma _j \\\\mathbf{y_j}. Hence, (\\\\mathbf{X},\\\\mathbf{Y}) is not feasible. Since all Pareto-dominating allocations are not feasible, (\\\\mathbf{X^*},\\\\mathbf{Y^*}) must itself be Pareto optimal. Note that while the fact that \\\\mathbf{Y^*} is profit maximizing is simply assumed in the statement of the theorem the result is only useful/interesting to the extent such a profit maximizing allocation of production is possible. Fortunately, for any restriction of the production allocation \\\\mathbf{Y^*} and price to a closed subset on which the marginal price is bounded away from 0, e.g., any reasonable choice of continuous functions to parameterize possible productions, such a maximum exists. This follows from the fact that the minimal marginal price and finite wealth limits the maximum feasible production (0 limits the minimum) and Tychonoff's theorem ensures the product of these compacts spaces is compact ensuring us a maximum of whatever continuous function we desire exists.  Proof of the second fundamental theorem  The second theorem formally states that, under the assumptions that every production set Y_j is convex and every preference relation \\\\geq _i is convex and locally nonsatiated, any desired Pareto- efficient allocation can be supported as a price quasi-equilibrium with transfers. Further assumptions are needed to prove this statement for price equilibria with transfers. The proof proceeds in two steps: first, we prove that any Pareto-efficient allocation can be supported as a price quasi- equilibrium with transfers; then, we give conditions under which a price quasi-equilibrium is also a price equilibrium. Let us define a price quasi- equilibrium with transfers as an allocation (x^*,y^*), a price vector p, and a vector of wealth levels w (achieved by lump-sum transfers) with \\\\Sigma _i w_i = p \\\\cdot \\\\omega + \\\\Sigma _j p \\\\cdot y^*_j (where \\\\omega is the aggregate endowment of goods and y^*_j is the production of firm j) such that: ::i. p \\\\cdot y_j \\\\leq p \\\\cdot y_j^* for all y_j \\\\in Y_j (firms maximize profit by producing y_j^*) ::ii. For all i, if x_i >_i x_i^* then p \\\\cdot x_i \\\\geq w_i (if x_i is strictly preferred to x_i^* then it cannot cost less than x_i^*) ::iii. \\\\Sigma_i x_i^* = \\\\omega + \\\\Sigma _j y_j^* (budget constraint satisfied) The only difference between this definition and the standard definition of a price equilibrium with transfers is in statement (ii). The inequality is weak here (p \\\\cdot x_i \\\\geq w_i) making it a price quasi-equilibrium. Later we will strengthen this to make a price equilibrium. Define V_i to be the set of all consumption bundles strictly preferred to x_i^* by consumer i, and let V be the sum of all V_i. V_i is convex due to the convexity of the preference relation \\\\geq _i. V is convex because every V_i is convex. Similarly Y + {\\\\omega}, the union of all production sets Y_i plus the aggregate endowment, is convex because every Y_i is convex. We also know that the intersection of V and Y + {\\\\omega} must be empty, because if it were not it would imply there existed a bundle that is strictly preferred to (x^*,y^*) by everyone and is also affordable. This is ruled out by the Pareto-optimality of (x^*,y^*). These two convex, non-intersecting sets allow us to apply the separating hyperplane theorem. This theorem states that there exists a price vector p eq 0 and a number r such that p \\\\cdot z \\\\geq r for every z \\\\in V and p \\\\cdot z \\\\leq r for every z \\\\in Y + {\\\\omega}. In other words, there exists a price vector that defines a hyperplane that perfectly separates the two convex sets. Next we argue that if x_i \\\\geq _i x_i^* for all i then p \\\\cdot (\\\\Sigma _i x_i) \\\\geq r. This is due to local nonsatiation: there must be a bundle x'_i arbitrarily close to x_i that is strictly preferred to x_i^* and hence part of V_i, so p \\\\cdot (\\\\Sigma _i x'_i) \\\\geq r. Taking the limit as x'_i \\\\rightarrow x_i does not change the weak inequality, so p \\\\cdot (\\\\Sigma _i x_i) \\\\geq r as well. In other words, x_i is in the closure of V. Using this relation we see that for x_i^* itself p \\\\cdot (\\\\Sigma _i x_i^*) \\\\geq r. We also know that \\\\Sigma _i x_i^* \\\\in Y + {\\\\omega}, so p \\\\cdot (\\\\Sigma _i x_i^*) \\\\leq r as well. Combining these we find that p \\\\cdot (\\\\Sigma _i x_i^*) = r. We can use this equation to show that (x^*,y^*,p) fits the definition of a price quasi-equilibrium with transfers. Because p \\\\cdot (\\\\Sigma _i x_i^*) = r and \\\\Sigma _i x_i^* = \\\\omega + \\\\Sigma _j y_j^* we know that for any firm j: ::p \\\\cdot (\\\\omega + y_j + \\\\Sigma_h y_h^*) \\\\leq r = p \\\\cdot (\\\\omega + y_j^* + \\\\Sigma_h y_h^*) for h eq j which implies p \\\\cdot y_j \\\\leq p \\\\cdot y_j^*. Similarly we know: ::p \\\\cdot (x_i + \\\\Sigma_k x_k^*) \\\\geq r = p \\\\cdot (x_i^* + \\\\Sigma_k x_k^*) for k eq i which implies p \\\\cdot x_i \\\\geq p \\\\cdot x_i^*. These two statements, along with the feasibility of the allocation at the Pareto optimum, satisfy the three conditions for a price quasi-equilibrium with transfers supported by wealth levels w_i = p \\\\cdot x_i^* for all i. We now turn to conditions under which a price quasi-equilibrium is also a price equilibrium, in other words, conditions under which the statement \\"if x_i >_i x_i^* then p \\\\cdot x_i \\\\geq w_i\\" imples \\"if x_i >_i x_i^* then p \\\\cdot x_i > w_i\\". For this to be true we need now to assume that the consumption set X_i is convex and the preference relation \\\\geq _i is continuous. Then, if there exists a consumption vector x'_i such that x'_i \\\\in X_i and p \\\\cdot x'_i < w_i, a price quasi-equilibrium is a price equilibrium. To see why, assume to the contrary x_i >_i x_i^* and p \\\\cdot x_i = w_i, and x_i exists. Then by the convexity of X_i we have a bundle x_i = \\\\alpha x_i + (1 - \\\\alpha)x'_i \\\\in X_i with p \\\\cdot x_i < w_i. By the continuity of \\\\geq _i for \\\\alpha close to 1 we have \\\\alpha x_i + (1 - \\\\alpha)x'_i >_i x_i^*. This is a contradiction, because this bundle is preferred to x_i^* and costs less than w_i. Hence, for price quasi-equilibria to be price equilibria it is sufficient that the consumption set be convex, the preference relation to be continuous, and for there always to exist a \\"cheaper\\" consumption bundle x'_i. One way to ensure the existence of such a bundle is to require wealth levels w_i to be strictly positive for all consumers i.

Life Pega belonged to one of the great noble families of Mercia, the daughter of Penwalh of Mercia. She lived as an anchoress at what is now Peakirk (\\"Pega's church\\") near Peterborough, not far from Guthlac's hermitage at Crowland. When Guthlac realised that his end was near in 714, he invited her to his funeral. For this she sailed down the River Welland, curing a blind man from Wisbech on the way. She inherited Guthlac's psalter and scourge, both of which, it was claimed, she later gave to Crowland Abbey. She went on pilgrimage to Rome and died there c.719. Ordericus Vitalis claimed that her relics survived in an unnamed Roman church in his day, and that miracles took place there. It is said that her heart was returned to Peakirk and was kept as a relic in the church, contained in a heart stone, the broken remains of which, smashed by Cromwell's troops, can be seen in the south aisle window.

According to her late hagiography, she was an Irish nun of the 5th or 6th century who founded a church in Cornwall. The village and civil parish of Breage in Cornwall are named after her, and the local Breage Parish Church is dedicated to her. Traditions Breage Parish Church, dedicated to Saint Breage Breage Church was established by 1170, giving its name to the village and parish of Breage, Cornwall. However, little else is known of Saint Breage or her early cultus. She was the subject of a medieval hagiography, probably written in the 14th or 15th century.Orme, pp. 71‚Äì72. The work is lost, but the English antiquarian John Leland recorded some extracts in his Itinerary around 1540.O'Hanlon, p. 137. The surviving text suggests an initial composition at or for Breage Church, as it contains a number of references to local places and gives Breage precedence over other saints of the region. The narrative is late and replete with stock elements and borrowings from other works, and as such is not considered historical. However, the author was certainly well versed in the hagiographical tradition, drawing from a Life of Brigid of Kildare, and evidently borrowing from Breton traditions of Saint Sithney and Lives of the local saints Elwen, Ia, and Gwinear. According to Leland's text, Breage was born in the region of Lagonia and Ultonia in Ireland, an unclear description perhaps referring to Leinster and Ulster. She became a nun at an oratory founded by Saint Brigid of Kildare at Campus Breace (the Plain of Breague; modern Mag Breg in County Meath). Around 460, she travelled to Cornwall with a company of seven other Irish saints: Germoe, Senanus (Sithney), Mavuanus (perhaps Mawnan), Elwen, Crowan, Helena, and Tecla. They settled at Revyer on the River Hayle, but some were killed by the local ruler Tewdwr Mawr of Penwith, a tyrant appearing regularly in Cornish hagiographical works.The portrayal of Tewdwr in other Tudor-era works such as Beunans Meriasek and Beunans Ke may be a satire against Henry VII Tudor in the wake of his crushing of the Cornish Rebellion of 1497. See Koch, p. 204, 205. Undeterred, Breage travelled through Cornwall, visiting the hill of Pencaire and establishing a church at Trenewith or Chynoweth. After her death the church was moved to its present location, and many miracles occurred at her tomb. Other bits of traditions about Breage have also come down. The chronicler William Worcester wrote in 1478 that Breage's feast day was celebrated on 1 May, and that she was said to be buried at the church dedicated to her. An idiom recorded in nearby Germoe in the 18th century said that while that village's patron Saint Germoe was a king, \\"Breage was a midwife\\". In the 19th century, residents of St Levan held that Breage was the sister of the town's saint Selevan or Salaman. In later times Breage's feast day was celebrated on 4 June, and was evidently once a prominent feast in Cornwall and the Diocese of Exeter in Devon.O'Hanlon, p. 138. A Breage Fair is held on the third Monday in June. Identity Since the traditions about Breage that have come down are late, the veracity of the details are doubted. The hagiography is replete with stock elements: her association with other locally venerated saints as companions, her conflict with a heathen tyrant, and her establishment as a hermit in a remote part of the parish that was later named for her. Her Irish origin is suspect, as in this period in Cornwall it was common to attribute a fabricated Irish connection to obscure saints. In Breage's case it may have been suggested by the similarity between her name and the Campus Breace in the Life of Brigid. As such, the traditions surrounding Breage appear to be later legend attached to a figure whose true history had been lost. There was a saint with a similar name active in the area during the Early Middle Ages, Brioc, whose feast day was 1 May, the same day that William Worcester gave for Breage. Brioc was male, but it is not uncommon for the gender of poorly remembered saints to have been switched over the years. In Brittany there was also a Saint Briac, who gave his name to a number of places in the region. However, all medieval mentions of Breage regard her as female, complicating an identification with similarly named male saints. Later brief accounts of Breage, mostly adapted from Leland, appear in the works of Alban Butler and Sabine Baring-Gould.

Coin's Financial School was an 1894 pamphlet written by lawyer, politician and resort founder William Hope Harvey (1851‚Äì1936). It advocated a return to bimetallism, where the value of a monetary unit is defined as a certain amount of two different kinds of metals, often gold and silver. In the book, Harvey charged that the demonetization of silver caused by the Coinage Act of 1873 led to the Panic of 1893 by halving the supply of available redemption money in the economy. This lowered the prices of goods throughout the country and hurt farmers and small business owners, according to Harvey. Harvey argued that by returning silver to the same monetary status as gold, the American economy would benefit from stabilized prices, resulting in higher revenue, and ease of repayment of debts. The pamphlet sold about 1 million copies, which helped popularized the free silver movement to the public. Harvey would go on to aid Democratic candidate William Jennings Bryan‚Äôs presidential campaign in 1896, which ran on the platform of free coinage of silver. The issue of bimetallism remained controversial throughout the remainder of the 19th century.  Background = The Founding Fathers  The Coinage Act of 1792, passed under president George Washington, established silver and gold as the legal tender of the United States, as gold was to be coined into eagles ($10), half-eagles ($5) and quarter-eagles ($2.50). Silver was to be coined into dollars ($1), half- dollars ($0.50), quarter-dollars ($0.25), dimes ($0.10) and half-dimes ($0.05). While the Coinage Act provided with coinage of copper as cent ($0.01) and half-cent ($0.005), copper was not accepted as legal tender.  The Gold Rush  In 1848, gold was discovered in Sutter's Mill, and the news of this discovery spread throughout the country. This would start a gold rush to the California territory. While merchants made more money than most miners did, it led to a substantial amount of gold flowing into the Treasury. Debate started in Congress on how to utilize the extra gold flowing into the reserves, and whether to abandon bimetallism in favor of the increasing supply of gold.  The Civil War and Beyond  During the American Civil War, Abraham Lincoln‚Äôs administration understood that the federal government would need millions of dollars to finance the war, and as the war dragged on, the government‚Äôs deficit and debt grew. It did not help that the previous administration, led by James Buchanan, left over $20 million budget deficit at the end of Buchanan‚Äôs term in 1861 as a result of a recession in 1857 that persisted throughout Buchanan‚Äôs term. More gold and silver left the nation to finance the war effort, reducing the nation‚Äôs resources in the long run, so Congress had metallic payments suspended in 1861 to stop the outflow. Lincoln and his Secretary of the Treasury, Salmon P. Chase, needed more loans to finance the war, but bankers, as a result of shaken public confidence, charged 24 percent in interests for the loans. As a solution, the government issued ‚Äúdemand notes‚Äù, or federal notes requesting for a certain amount of money to be redeemed in gold or silver. In 1862, the government issued ‚Äúgreenbacks‚Äù, which were unbacked notes that relied on government credit to retain value by themselves without the backing of metal. By the end of the war, gold was worth 1.5 greenback. This, combined with the amount of debt the government already owed, threatened the war-torn economy as it prepared to pay off its war debts. As a response to the growing concerns regarding the amount of paper money used and growing debt of the United States, the Congress passed the Fourth Coinage Act in 1873. This law eliminated silver as the legal tender of the United States by abolishing the rights of the silver holders to have their silver bullions struck into U.S. Dollar coins. Proponents of free silver came to criticize the act as the ‚ÄúCrime of ‚Äò73‚Äù, while proponents of gold standard argued that since most world powers of the time, including England (in 1816) and the German Empire (in 1871), used the gold standard, it would facilitate international commerce. The Panic of 1873 followed shortly after the passage of the act, and another panic followed in 1893, which continued to affect businesses and investors as of the pamphlet's publish date. Banks continued to close as panicked investors and customers made runs on the bank, forcing them to run out of money, while businesses failed as a result of loss of customers and shortage of money. The bank runs dried up the gold reserves in the federal treasury. As a result, then-president Grover Cleveland was forced to borrow $65 million from J.P. Morgan and the Rothschild family. The latest panic restarted a heated debate on the merits of bimetallism and the role of the Fourth Coinage Act on the panics.  Book Summary = Plot summary  Throughout the pamphlet, the audience is introduced to a fictional financier called Coin, who holds financial lectures in Chicago. Over six days, he summarizes the United States‚Äô financial history from the passage of the Coinage Act in 1792 to 1894, when the pamphlet was published. Coin introduces the audience to what he calls the ‚ÄúCrime of 1873‚Äù, or the Fourth Coinage Act, which became controversial as the nation's debt and money supply went into doubt after the Civil War. In between Coin's various lectures, he is interrupted with questions from the audience, which is filled with prominent real-life individuals such as Lyman Gage and Joseph Medill. His school gradually gains more audience and media attention, most mocking him at first, but showing him more respect as they check the facts that Coin presents throughout his lectures. Coin presents U.S. financial history from 1792 to 1894 mostly from the populists and free silver supporters‚Äô point of view. = The First Day = The book's depiction of how silver was \\"killed\\" by an act of law rather than an act of violence. The first pages of the pamphlet introduced the reader to Coin, a young financier who held a financial school in the Art Institute of Chicago. Coin started his first lecture by outlining the financial problems that plagued the nation at the time. Still suffering from the Panic of 1893, the nation's crime rate, government budget deficit and unemployment remained dangerously high. He then introduced his audience to the basics of coinage in the United States, where in 1792, Congress passed the first Coinage Act. The Coinage Act defined a dollar as 371.25 grains of pure silver, as well as 24.7 grains of pure gold. In this case, both silver and gold were accepted as legal tenders of the United States, with a silver to gold exchange ratio of 15 to 1. The ratio was later changed to 16 to 1. Coin states that the Founding Fathers chose silver as the principal money because it was very commonly used among the working class as well as business owners. Gold was seen as the money of the rich, since the working and middle class rarely owned it, let alone handled it. At that point, Joseph Medill, an editor from the Chicago Tribune, asked Coin about why only eight million silver dollars were coined during the bimetal period from 1792 to 1873. Coin corrected Medill by stating that it was not eight million silver dollars that were coined, but rather, it was eight million silver dollars that were coined, in addition to the eighty-nine million dollars in other silver coins, Coin added, there were 97 million dollars coined in halves, quarters and dimes18. Not only that, the United States received about 100 million dollars in foreign silver prior to 1860, further adding to the Treasury‚Äôs silver reserves. Coin then claimed that silver was leaving the country by 1853 as a result of France establishing a ratio of 15.5 silver to 1 gold for its currency. To combat this, Congress lowered the amount of pure silver in its coins to prevent them from being exported. Coin then introduced the audience to the ‚ÄúCrime of 1873‚Äù, when the Fourth Coinage Act was passed. The act demonetized silver, as well as abolished its right to free coinage. Under free coinage, the government purchased and coined any silver that was sold. At the time, most people were using paper money, diminishing the importance of gold and silver coins. This gave the news and the people little reason to care about the demonetization of silver, according to Coin. The law was passed in relative obscurity, as newspapers did not report on it at the time of the law's passage, and then- president Ulysses S. Grant claimed that he did not know that the new law demonetized silver when he signed it into law. Coin concluded his first lesson by criticizing the secrecy that this law was passed with, given the effects it had. = The Second Day = The major newspapers in Chicago were taking note of Coin's first lecture, but all of them dismissed Coin as inconsequential and some others threw insults at the bimetallists such as ‚Äúfraudulent free silverites‚Äù and ‚Äúblatant orators‚Äù. Coin started his second lesson in the Art Institute amid the increased media attention. Right after Coin called for start of the lesson, Lyman Gage, a prominent financier, asked Coin how two different metals can be coined at the same value at a fixed ratio when both metals fluctuate in value over time. Coin replied by noting that while prices are determined by the goods‚Äô supply and demand, the government artificially inflated gold and silver's demand with free coinage. Under free coinage, the government took any gold and silver that came, effectively creating unlimited demand. To keep both metals from becoming infinitely expensive, the government artificially set a value for each metal to be used as units of money. A chart that Harvey gives to show the history of silver's price in proportion to 1 unit of gold from 1687 to 1892. Notice the sharp increase in the amount of silver required to match a unit of gold since 1873, when the Coinage Act of 1873 was passed. This was disrupted by the Coinage Act of 1873, according to Coin, as eliminating free coinage for silver also eliminated the unlimited demand for silver and its status as the legal tender. This made silver much more vulnerable to the market demands as all goods, including silver, was only redeemable in gold now. Coin then presented a chart to demonstrate the falling price of silver in comparison to gold, from hovering in between 15 and 16 silver per gold until 1873 to 23.72 silver per gold by 1892. Coin then claimed that there were $3,727,018,869 in gold and $3,820,571,346 in silver throughout the world. By eliminating silver as a legal tender, the world reduced its redemption money supply by a little over half, Coin concluded. = The Third Day = Even more people showed interest in Coin's financial school, and more bimetallists joined Coin's lessons every day. Coin started off the day's lecture by distinguishing between the two kinds of credit money: paper money, which include bank notes, and token money, which are forms of metal that do not enjoy free coinage. Credit money was used as promises that the government will redeem the owner with the primary money, which in this case was gold. Coin pointed out that by abolishing free coinage of silver, the government turned silver from one of the primary money to a token money, no longer redeemable by itself. This, in turn, reduced the nation's supply of primary money by half. By reducing the nation's primary money supply, the government effectively rendered many checks and greenback bank notes more volatile, since they were no longer backed by properties, but by speculation and federal government's credit. Coin then defined the three main forms of credit: credit, checks and bonds. Coin defined credit as paper bills and token money redeemable in primary money, checks as forms of paper payable on demand, and bonds as credit payable at some point in the future. Ideally, one would prefer to keep the amount of the three forms of credit as same as the amount of primary money backing them up. Coin explained that during a period of prosperity, more and more businessmen and entrepreneurs took debts to further investments in their businesses. When too much of the credit money was purchased compared to the available supply of redemption money, this created a loss of confidence in the banks as more and more buyers run to the bank to collect their money and debt payments before the banks run out of money. This, combined with the halved supply of primary money from silver losing its free coinage, made new debt all the riskier. As silver began to depreciate in value in comparison to gold, and many properties lost their value in proportion to gold, debts became harder to repay through revenue alone, so more businessmen and farmers had to take on more debt to pay off existing loans, and so on and so forth. Eventually, the collective debt reached over $40 billion, then an unprecedented sum. Farms and cities were mortgaged to pay off the debt, more and more businesses and farms went out of business, and so began the Panic of 1893. = The Fourth Day = The school continued to gain more attention and popularity as more newspapers began to cover the lessons, this time with more positive enthusiasm. It got to the point where Coin had to start charging the audience for admission, and donate the proceedings to charity. Among the first questions directed at Coin involved why the metals were chosen as money in the first place. Coin claimed out that silver in particular was considered more than valuable enough to be money because it can be used in many other settings. Therefore, it had enough intrinsic value that even if the financial system was to collapse, silver would still have value, and money backed by silver continues to retain some of its value should such a thing happen. Coin was then asked about silver costing about 50 cents an ounce to mine, and how cost of production often dictated a property's value. Coin replied by noting that not all mines struck rich in their operations, and many mines failed as a result of silver sales not keeping up with the cost of machinery and labor. Another member of the audience asked Coin about the potential of a greenback system. Coin replies that a greenback system, which would rely entirely on a limited supply of paper notes printed by U.S. Mint, could work as long as there is confidence in government credit. With any collapse in confidence, however, the value of each greenback would collapse as well, rendering the system very unstable. While in wartime, people used greenbacks as a result of precious metal being used for the war effort, they avoided financial damage by storing their good money for use later. In this case, it would help to have a currency backed by some kind of commodity more reliable, since the government's credit may not survive the war unscathed. James Sovereign, Master Workman of the Knights of Labor, asked Coin if instead a currency system based on labor instead of commodity may work just as well. Coin replied that it would work similarly to a greenback system, based on government credit and confidence as well, using postage stamps as an example. When another man asked Coin on whether abolishing tariffs drove down the prices as a result of increased foreign competition, Coin pointed out that since the rest of the world is experiencing the same financial difficulties, United States would gain nothing by charging extra tariffs on foreign goods. In a time of financial crisis, no nation would want its trade restricted by high tariffs. Coin then went on to explain how silver depreciating in value in comparison to gold had deleterious effects on international trade as well. Most South American countries have used silver more commonly than gold up to that point, while England had abandoned silver as legal tender in 1816. Since then, England demanded all debts to be paid in gold, or redeemable to gold. With silver depreciating against gold, more and more silver would leave South American nations who had much more silver than gold in their treasuries. United States was paying England $200 million in interests annually by the 1890s, all in gold or some commodity that must be redeemed in gold. At this point, England had become the creditor nation of the world, and silver nations were finding it harder to repay their loans and bonds as a result of silver values falling against the gold. = The Fifth Day = Coin demonstrating the size of all the property in the world compared to all the debt in the world. Coin began his next lecture with three globes on the platform, of varying sizes. He explained that the largest globe represented all the property in the world, which he valued at $450 billion. The smaller two globes represented the combined value of silver and gold in the world, and the amount of gold alone. As Coin has noted before, abolishing free coinage for silver had reduced the amount of the money supply in the world by half. Because of the shrinking supply of money, the price of gold went up, and since every property was now measured in gold, property values dropped against the gold. Coin claimed that as the strongest nations in the world, such as Britain and United States, traded only in gold as of the 1890s, they compelled other nations to either drop their silver standards or trade their silver in their diminished rates. To demonstrate the unsustainability of the international gold standard, Coin measured up all the gold in the world. The value of all the gold in the world, as Coin cited the latest U.S. Mint estimates, was around $3.9 billion as of 1894. There were 1.4 billion people as of 1894, which meant that the world's gold supply divided up to $2.50 per capita. Coin also shows, with a measuring tape, that $3.9 billion of gold could be measured in a room with a dimension of 22 x 22 x 22 feet, and still have 852 ft3 left. The total quantity of silver, on the other hand, was measured as 66 x 66 x 66 feet, which would add a tremendous amount of money to the world's money supply. Coin remarked that there is no wonder that commodity prices are so low with so little metal to be used as the world's measure of money. Coin then reminded the audience that it was not the price of commodities that were falling, but rather the prices of commodities were standing still while the value of gold continued to climb. After all, all the properties in the United States were redeemable by gold, meaning that their values were measured by the increasingly expensive gold. To further demonstrate what happened to the value of silver in comparison to gold, Coin cited a hypothetical situation where diamond became the sole legal tender of the United States. A carat of diamond was worth $50.00 in gold in 1894, meaning that should diamond become the main legal tender, all the values in the nation would plummet to 1/50th of their current value. Due to lessening demand and increasing supply of gold, its value would start to fluctuate along with silver in relation to the diamond. Coin pointed out that while the property of commodities plummeted, the amount of debt owed did not, and the lower prices made the collective debt harder to pay off. He illustrated the point with an example of a wheat farmer. The farmer has seen the price of wheat fall from $1.40 per bushel in 1873 to $0.50 per bushel in 1893, while the prices of fares, hotel, coffee and even interests the same as before as he tries to file his taxes in the big city. = A Parable = Before the sixth lecture, the author included a little tale of a family of quails living in a wheat field. When the wheat was ready to be harvested, the mother quail told her children to wait. When the wheat grew riper, and the farmer suggested that he will bring some friends to cut the wheat, the mother once again told her children to wait. Only when the wheat was so ripe that it was ready to fall does the farmer decide to cut the wheat himself, and this prompted the mother quail to move the family elsewhere.A giant octopus, representing the Rothschild banking family of England, engulfing the world with its control over gold. = The Sixth Day = Coin's demonstration of the size of all the gold in the world gained attention throughout the city, and prominent newspapers confirmed his report as true. Before a crowd of thousands gathering in the Art Institute, Coin began a fiery speech on the ills brought upon by the abandonment of bimetallism, and lamented the role England has had regarding America's switch to the gold standard. From there, he called for a war with England over the issue, charging that America was forced to pay $200 million in interests to England every year, an amount that is becoming harder to pay off as a result of the Panic of 1893. He also criticized the proponents of the gold standard within the United States, who believe England will return to bimetallism on its own. That was despite the fact that England raked in major profits by forcing other nations to make transactions redeemable in gold only. In making these points, Coin called for a trade war with England, with promises of the backing of fellow silver nations such as France, most of South America, India and Mexico. In this trade war, Coin proposed that United States use its position as England's leading trade partner to raise tariffs and force England to switch back to bimetallism if they want American money back to its economy. Coin rallied the crowd to back a trade war with England, and lobby Congress for bimetallism for the good of the U.S. economy. With that, Coin concluded his financial school.  Reception  An illustration from Stanley Wood's Answer to Coin's Financial School mocking the absurdity of Coin's claims and suggestions. The pamphlet sold around a million copies since 1894, and was instrumental in aiding William Jennings Bryan's 1896 presidential campaign. It would become the most popular advocate of bimetallism in the United States, but this also meant that it received plenty of criticism from gold standard advocates. Willard Fisher, an economist, summed up the criticism for Coin with connecting the Fourth Coinage Act and the two panics that happened afterwards. Panics of similar scope had happened under bimetallism as well, notably Panics of 1819 and 1837, so the connection to the Fourth Coinage Act and the panics were shaky, according to Fisher. Chicago banker Stanley Wood pointed out that prices of commodities fell not because of the rising gold prices, but because of the advancements in technology and equipment that drove down production costs. He also questioned how falling of prices could be bad for the economy, since lower prices are good for consumers, allowing them to invest in their businesses and households better. As for the debt crisis, he argued that the United States actually had less debt per capita compared to other leading nations: according to his sources, France's debt per capita is $200, Great Britain‚Äôs $84, and the United States‚Äô $16 as of 1895, when Wood published his pamphlet. Not only is the country not in middle of a crisis, but given United States‚Äô strong economic ties with Britain ‚Äì Britain comprised 47% of America's exports at the time ‚Äì it would be foolish to declare a trade war with Britain. Michigan Banker and editor Edward Wisner made similar comments in his own response, ‚ÄúCash vs. Coin‚Äù, where he created a fictional financier, ‚ÄúCharley Cash‚Äù to serve as Coin's opponent. Through Cash, Wisner also points out that simply reestablishing silver as legal tender would not create value by itself ‚Äì the government would have to buy all that silver using tax money. He also cites the 70 columns of Senate reports and 80 columns of House of Representatives reports to show that the Fourth Coinage Act was not passed in secret, as Coin had charged. He also differed on the primary cause of the Panic of 1893, claiming that it was in fact, silver proponents themselves who caused the loss of confidence in the dollar because of the government buying up too much overvalued, useless silver. By sticking to money that rest of the world no longer accepted, argued Wisner, the United States would cut the Dollar's value as it adds a bunch of useless money into the supply. This, in turn, would turn away foreign investors who fear that a dollar backed by less stable metal will struggle to hold its value. In his ‚ÄúLesson for Coin‚Äù, lawyer and American Bar Association founder Everett Wheeler cited that even under free coinage of silver, rates of silver fluctuated from nation to nation according to their demands and supply, and that even before 1873, there was not an unlimited demand for silver, as silver was too bulky to use. Most people preferred paper notes and checks. He, like most of Coin's critics, spoke out against Coin's anti-British stance, pointing out Britain's position as America's leading trade partner, as well as its cultural ancestor.  Aftermath  Harvey would go on to assist William Jennings Bryan's campaign in his home state of Arkansas, where Bryan won easily. Bryan would sweep the South and the Rockies, but William McKinley, who adopted gold standard, would sweep the more populous Northeast as well as the Great Lakes. McKinley won the election, 271‚Äì176. At that point, the United States had emerged from the Panic of 1893, and the debate over bimetallism was calming. McKinley's administration passed the Gold Standard Act in 1900, establishing the dollar as 23.22 grains of pure gold, and the law would stay in place until the Great Depression.

Although it is possible to sue law enforcement officials for false arrest, the usual defendants in such cases are private security firms.  United Kingdom  In the United Kingdom, a police officer may arrest a person under if they are executing a warrant, if they have a \\"reasonable belief\\" that someone is involved in a criminal offence, or if they have a reasonable belief that someone is about to be involved in a criminal offence and it is necessary to arrest that person. Proof of wrongful arrest depends on proving that an officer did not have a reasonable belief and that it was not necessary to arrest someone. Most cases where unlawful arrest was determined emerge from a claim that an arrest was unnecessary. The specific legislation governing, in England and Wales, the reasons for which a police officer may arrest a person are in section 24 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. Damages for unlawful arrest depend primarily on the time in custody and can be aggravated if the police acted maliciously.  United States  After an arrest, if the charges are dropped, a person will sometimes file legal action or a complaint against the appropriate arresting agency. In most jurisdictions, the arrest powers of police and police agents are in excess of those afforded to ordinary citizens (see citizen's arrest). However, the powers of police officers to arrest are not unlimited. Generally speaking: #Anyone may arrest a person if in possession of an arrest warrant issued by an appropriate court. In the United States, this includes bounty hunters (agents of bail bondsmen) acting under the authority of a bench warrant to bring a criminal defendant who has skipped bail to court for trial. #A police officer, or a person authorized by a jurisdiction's police powers act, may arrest anyone whom the officer has probable cause to believe has committed any criminal offence. However, in the case of a misdemeanour, summary conviction offence, or non-criminal offence (such as a municipal by-law offence) the officer may arrest the suspect only long enough to identify the suspect and give the suspect a summons to appear in court, unless there is reason to believe they will not appear in answer to the summons. #Any person may arrest someone suspected of committing a felony or indictable offence, as long as the arresting person believes the suspect is attempting to flee the scene of the felony. A person cannot be arrested on suspicion of committing a felony well after the fact unless the arresting officer possesses an arrest warrant. Citizens and businesses Most cases of false arrest involve accusations of shoplifting, and are brought against security guards and retail stores. A guard cannot arrest someone merely on the suspicion that person is going to commit a theft. In most jurisdictions, there must be some proof that a criminal act has actually been committed. For example, a guard does not have reasonable and probable cause if a shopper has not yet paid for merchandise they are carrying in the belief that the person intends to leave without making payment. Instead, there must be an actual act committedthe person must make an actual attempt to leave the store without paying for the merchandise. Police officers In the United States and other jurisdictions, police officers and other government officials are liable for clear deprivation of rights, but are partially shielded from false arrest lawsuits through the doctrine of qualified immunity, when such a violation qualifies as \\"not obvious,\\" by a US Supreme Court test. This doctrine can protect officials from liability when engaged in legal grey areas including qualifying discretionary actions in the arrests of suspects. However, the officer's actions must still not violate \\"clearly established law,\\" or this protection is void. This includes executing an arrest warrant against the wrong person. False statements by public servants to justify or cover up an illegal arrest are another violation of federal law. An example of this doctrine being tested is Sorrell v. McGuigan (4th Cir. 2002). A police officer (McGuigan) detained a man shopping at a mall (Sorrell) based on the description of a suspect who had committed a theft at a store nearby, and proceeded to do a routine search for weapons. The store owner who reported the theft arrived at the scene and stated Sorrell and his friends were not the ones who had stolen from him. However, the officer still arrested Sorrell for possession of a concealed weapon, because he was carrying a folding knife with a 3 inch long blade in his pocket. In Maryland, non-automatic folding knives are not considered weapons under state law regardless of their length, and the lack of length limit had been upheld multiple times in the state's highest court. However, the officer erroneously believed the knife to be a weapon. Sorrell was released immediately after booking and was never prosecuted as there was technically no crime, and sued the police officer for false arrest. The officer's qualified immunity was denied by the court, and this decision was upheld in the US Court of Appeals. Bounty hunters Bounty hunters have been subject to suits for false arrest after attempting to execute bench warrants outside of the United States ‚Äî where they have no extra powers beyond those of ordinary citizens and only police officers may execute warrants. In at least two prominent cases, bounty hunters were charged with kidnapping after taking custody of a bail jumper outside of the United States and bringing them back to the court that issued the warrant. One of them, Daniel Kear, was extradited from the US and convicted. There have been some cases where police officers or bounty hunters have executed valid arrest warrants against the wrong person. Although many false arrest suits result in only nominal damages, such mistakes usually result in large awards against the arresting officers. Resisting unlawful arrest Individuals who realize that they are the target of false arrest might attempt to resist or flee. Fourteen U.S. states recognize the target's right of self-defense so as to resist unlawful arrest. Typically, this only applies when: * the arresting officer used more force than necessary to effect the arrest, and * the resistance is only to such an extent as necessary to protect oneself from great bodily harm or death. In such jurisdictions ‚Äì and under the narrowly- defined circumstances described above ‚Äì resisting unlawful arrest may be used as a justification for such resistance where it would otherwise be a crime (i.e. resisting arrest, flight to avoid prosecution, assault, etc). There are rare cases in which a murder charge had been reduced to manslaughter for this reason. Justification for such action is often hard to prove in court, and only justified in certain circumstances. Simple mistake of fact situations would generally not warrant attempting to elude law enforcement. However, there are some that would, such as: *the person making the arrest never identifying themselves, causing the defendant to believe they are the target of kidnapping or robbery. *the reasonable belief that the person making the arrest is an impersonator with the intent of victimizing the defendant.

Control of the town was at the centre of the Eritrean‚ÄìEthiopian border conflict, which lasted from the end of the Eritrean‚ÄìEthiopian War in 1998 to the signing of a joint statement at the Eritrea‚ÄìEthiopia summit in 2018, 20 years after the conflict started.  Disputed territory  The boundaries of Ethiopia and Eritrea follow a frontier defined by the Treaty of Addis Ababa between Ethiopia and Italy, which ruled Eritrea as a colony at the time. However, the frontier near Badme was poorly defined in the treaty, and since Eritrea became a separate nation in 1993, each nation has disputed where the boundary actually runs. The town of Badme was ceded by the TPLF (the predecessor of the EPRDF, Ethiopia's currently ruling party) to the EPLF (the predecessor of the PFDJ, Eritrea's ruling organization) in November 1977. In 2000, Eritrea and Ethiopia signed the Algiers Agreement, which forwarded the border dispute to a Hague boundary commission. In the agreement, both parties agreed in advance to comply with the ruling of the border commission. In 2002, the commission ruled on where the boundary ran, placing Badme inside Eritrean territory. Despite initially agreeing to abide by the terms of the Algiers Agreement, Ethiopia refused to withdraw to the border established by the Eritrea‚ÄìEthiopia Boundary Commission and rejected its ruling. As a result, thousands of internally displaced people have remained in refugee camps and the threat of renewed war continues. Other disputed areas along the Eritrean‚ÄìEthiopian border include Tsorona-Zalambessa and Bure. Ethiopian withdrawal In June 2018, following a meeting of the executive council of the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF), the ruling party in Ethiopia, the government of Ethiopia announced plans to withdraw from Badme and cede it to Eritrea.

This colorless deliquescent salt has a wide range of uses. Applications=Biotechnological Sodium acetate is used as the carbon source for culturing bacteria. Sodium acetate is also useful for increasing yields of DNA isolation by ethanol precipitation. Industrial Sodium acetate is used in the textile industry to neutralize sulfuric acid waste streams and also as a photoresist while using aniline dyes. It is also a pickling agent in chrome tanning and helps to impede vulcanization of chloroprene in synthetic rubber production. In processing cotton for disposable cotton pads, sodium acetate is used to eliminate the buildup of static electricity. Concrete longevity Sodium acetate is used to mitigate water damage to concrete by acting as a concrete sealant, while also being environmentally benign and cheaper than the commonly used epoxy alternative for sealing concrete against water permeation. Food Sodium acetate may be added to food as a seasoning, sometimes in the form of sodium diacetate, a one-to-one complex of sodium acetate and acetic acid, given the E-number E262. It is often used to give potato chips a salt and vinegar flavor. Sodium acetate (anhydrous) is widely used as a shelf-life extending agent, pH control agent It is safe to eat at low concentration. Buffer solution A solution of sodium acetate (a basic salt of acetic acid) and acetic acid can act as a buffer to keep a relatively constant pH level. This is useful especially in biochemical applications where reactions are pH- dependent in a mildly acidic range (pH 4‚Äì6). Heating pad A hand warmer containing a supersaturated solution of sodium acetate which releases heat upon crystallization Sodium acetate is also used in heating pads, hand warmers, and hot ice.

When they are heated past the melting point and subsequently allowed to cool, the aqueous solution becomes supersaturated. This solution is capable of cooling to room temperature without forming crystals. By pressing on a metal disc within the heating pad, a nucleation center is formed, causing the solution to crystallize back into solid sodium acetate trihydrate. The bond-forming process of crystallization is exothermic. The latent heat of fusion is about 264‚Äì289 kJ/kg.Ibrahim Dincer and Marc A. Rosen. Thermal Energy Storage: Systems and Applications, page 155 Unlike some types of heat packs, such as those dependent upon irreversible chemical reactions, a sodium acetate heat pack can be easily reused by immersing the pack in boiling water for a few minutes, until the crystals are completely dissolved, and allowing the pack to slowly cool to room temperature. Preparation A crystal of sodium acetate trihydrate (length 1.7 centimetres) For laboratory use, sodium acetate is inexpensive and usually purchased instead of being synthesized. It is sometimes produced in a laboratory experiment by the reaction of acetic acid, commonly in the 5‚Äì8% solution known as vinegar, with sodium carbonate (\\"washing soda\\"), sodium bicarbonate (\\"baking soda\\"), or sodium hydroxide (\\"lye\\", or \\"caustic soda\\"). Any of these reactions produce sodium acetate and water. When a sodium and carbonate ion-containing compound is used as the reactant, the carbonate anion from sodium bicarbonate or carbonate, reacts with hydrogen from the carboxyl group (-COOH) in acetic acid, forming carbonic acid. Carbonic acid readily decomposes under normal conditions into gaseous carbon dioxide and water. This is the reaction taking place in the well-known \\"volcano\\" that occurs when the household products, baking soda and vinegar, are combined. :CH3COOH + NaHCO3 ‚Üí CH3COONa + : ‚Üí + Industrially, sodium acetate trihydrate is prepared by reacting acetic acid with sodium hydroxide using water as the solvent. :CH3COOH + NaOH ‚Üí CH3COONa + H2O Reactions Sodium acetate can be used to form an ester with an alkyl halide such as bromoethane: : CH3COONa + BrCH2CH3 ‚Üí CH3COOCH2CH3 \\\\+ NaBr Sodium acetate undergoes decarboxylation to form methane (CH4) under forcing conditions (pyrolysis in the presence of sodium hydroxide): : CH3COONa + NaOH ‚Üí CH4 \\\\+ Na2CO3 Calcium oxide is the typical catalyst used for this reaction.

Royal Navy Dockyards (more usually termed Royal Dockyards) were state-owned harbour facilities where ships of the Royal Navy were built, based, repaired and refitted. Throughout its history, the Royal Navy has made extensive use of private shipyards, both at home and abroad; but at the same time (from the reign of Henry VII up until the 1990s) it also had a policy of establishing and maintaining its own dockyard facilities. Portsmouth was the first (dating from the late 15th century); it was followed by Deptford, Woolwich, Chatham and others. By the 18th century, Britain had a string of these state-owned naval dockyards, located not just around the country but across the world; each yard was sited close to a safe harbour or anchorage used by the fleet. Most Royal Dockyards had a dual function, providing for both ship building and ship maintenance (most yards provided for both but some specialised in one or the other). Over time, they accrued additional on-site facilities for the support, training and accommodation of naval personnel. For centuries, in this way, the name and concept of a Royal Dockyard was largely synonymous with that of a naval base. In the early 1970s, following the appointment of civilian Dockyard General Managers with cross-departmental authority, and a separation of powers between them and the Dockyard Superintendent (commanding officer), the term 'Naval Base' began to gain currency as an official designation for the latter's domain. 'Royal Dockyard' remained an official designation of the associated shipbuilding/maintenance facilities until 1997, when the last remaining Royal Dockyards (Devonport and Rosyth) were fully privatised. Function Careening wharf and storehouses built by the Royal Navy in the 1760s, Illa Pinto, Port Mahon, Menorca. Most Royal Dockyards were built around docks and slips. Traditionally, slipways were used for shipbuilding, and dry docks (also called graving docks) for maintenance; (dry docks were also sometimes used for building, particularly pre-1760 and post-1880). Regular hull maintenance was important: in the age of sail, a ship's wooden hull would be comprehensively inspected every 2‚Äì3 years, and its copper sheeting replaced every 5.English Heritage: Thematic Survey of Naval Dockyards in England Dry docks were invariably the most expensive component of any dockyard (until the advent of marine nuclear facilities). Where there was no nearby dock available (as was often the case at the overseas yards) ships would sometimes be careened (beached at high tide) to enable necessary work to be done. In the age of sail, wharves and capstan-houses were often built for the purpose of careening at yards with no dock: a system of pulleys and ropes, attached to the masthead, would be used to heel the ship over giving access to the hull. 18th-century storehouse, 19th-century dry dock and 20th-century warship preserved at Chatham In addition to docks and slips, a Royal Dockyard had various specialist buildings on site: storehouses, sail lofts, woodworking sheds, metal shops and forges, roperies (in some cases), pumping stations (for emptying the dry docks), administration blocks and housing for the senior dockyard officers. Wet docks (usually called basins) accommodated ships while they were being fitted out. The number and size of dockyard basins increased dramatically in the steam era. At the same time, large factory complexes, machine-shops and foundries sprung up alongside for the manufacture of engines and other components (including the metal hulls of the ships themselves). coaling wharf at Devonport One thing generally absent from the Royal Dockyards (until the 20th century) was the provision of naval barracks. Prior to this time, sailors were not usually quartered ashore at all, they were expected to live on board a ship (the only real exception being at some overseas wharves where accommodation was provided for crews whose ships were being careened). When a ship was decommissioned at the end of a voyage or tour of duty, most of her crew were dismissed or else transferred to new vessels. Alternatively, if a vessel was undergoing refit or repair, her crew was often accommodated on a nearby hulk; a dockyard often had several commissioned hulks moored nearby, serving various purposes and accommodating various personnel, including new recruits. Things began to change when the Admiralty introduced more settled terms of service in 1853; nevertheless, thirty years were to pass before the first shore barrack opened, and a further twenty years before barracks at all three of the major home yards were finally completed. Through the course of the 20th century these barracks, together with their associated training and other facilities, became defining features of each of these dockyards. In 1985 Parliament was given the following description of the functions of the two then remaining Royal Dockyards: \\"The services provided by the royal dockyards at Devonport and Rosyth to the Royal Navy fall into five main categories as follows: (a) Refit, repair, maintenance and modernisation of Royal Navy vessels; (b) Overhaul and testing of naval equipments, including those to be returned to the Director General of Stores and Transport (Navy) for stock and subsequent issue to the Royal Navy; (c) Installation and maintenance of machinery and equipment in naval establishments; (d) Provision of utility services to Royal Navy vessels alongside in the naval base and to adjacent naval shore establishments; and (e) manufacture of some items of ships' equipment\\". Nomenclature Woolwich Dockyard, pictured in 1790. Ships under repair and construction are prominently seen on the yard's two docks and three slips; shipbuilding timber is stacked in every available open space across the site. For a long time, well into the eighteenth century, a Royal Dockyard was often referred to as The King's Yard (or The Queen's Yard, as appropriate). In 1694, Edmund Dummer referred to \\"His Majesty's new Dock and Yard at Plymouth\\"; from around that time, HM Dock Yard (or HM Dockyard) increasingly became the official designation. While, as this phrase suggests, the primary meaning of 'Dockyard' is a Yard with a Dock, not all dockyards possessed one; for example, at both Bermuda and Portland dry docks were planned but never built. Where a dock was neither built nor planned (as at Harwich, Deal and several of the overseas yards) the installation was often designated HM Naval Yard rather than 'HM Dockyard' in official publications (though the latter term may have been used informally); they are included in the listings below. While the term 'Royal Dockyard' ceased in official usage following privatisation, at least one private-sector operator has reinstated it: Babcock International, which in 2011 acquired freehold ownership of the working North Yard at Devonport from the British Ministry of Defence, reverted to calling it Devonport Royal Dockyard. Historical overview Portsmouth: surviving dry-docks at No. 1 Basin (one of which dates from 1698). The origins of the Royal Dockyards are closely linked with the permanent establishment of a standing Navy in the early sixteenth century. The beginnings of a yard had already been established at Portsmouth with the building of a dry dock in 1496; but it was on the Thames in the reign of Henry VIII that the Royal Dockyards really began to flourish. Woolwich and Deptford dockyards were both established in the early 1510s (a third yard followed at Erith but this was short-lived as it proved to be vulnerable to flooding). The Thames yards were pre-eminent in the sixteenth century, being conveniently close to the merchants and artisans of London (for shipbuilding and supply purposes) as well as to the Armouries of the Tower of London. They were also just along the river from Henry's palace at Greenwich. As time went on, though, they suffered from the silting of the river and the constraints of their sites. Covered slip no. 1, Devonport: the only complete surviving eighteenth-century slip on a Royal Dockyard. By the mid-seventeenth century, Chatham (established 1567) had overtaken them to become the largest of the yards. Together with new Yards at Harwich and Sheerness, Chatham was well-placed to serve the Navy in the Dutch Wars that followed. Apart from Harwich (which closed in 1713), all the yards remained busy into the eighteenth century ‚Äì including Portsmouth (which, after a period of dormancy, had now begun to grow again). In 1690, Portsmouth had been joined on the south coast by a new Royal Dockyard at Plymouth; a hundred years later, as Britain renewed its enmity with France, these two yards gained new prominence and pre-eminence. Furthermore, Royal Dockyards began to be opened in some of Britain's colonial ports, to service the fleet overseas. Yards were opened in Jamaica (as early as 1675), Antigua (1725), Gibraltar (1704), Canada (Halifax, 1759) and several other locations. In the wake of the Seven Years' War a large-scale programme of expansion and rebuilding was undertaken at the three largest home yards (Chatham, Plymouth and Portsmouth). These highly significant works (involving land reclamation and excavation, as well as new docks and slips and buildings of every kind) lasted from 1765 to 1808, and were followed by a comprehensive rebuilding of the Yard at Sheerness (1815‚Äì23). HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales under construction at Rosyth, 2013. Through the Napoleonic Wars all the home yards were kept very busy, and a new shipbuilding yard was established at Pembroke in 1815. Before very long, new developments in shipbuilding, materials and propulsion prompted changes at the Dockyards. Construction of marine steam engines was initially focused at Woolwich, but massive expansion soon followed at Portsmouth, Plymouth and Chatham. Portland Harbour was built by the Admiralty in the mid-19th century to help protect ships taking coal on board; because of its key position, midway between Devonport and Portsmouth in the English Channel, Portland was developed as a maintenance yard. A new maintenance yard was also opened on Haulbowline Island in Cork Harbour. Meanwhile, the Thames-side yards, Woolwich and Deptford, could no longer compete, and they finally closed in 1869. The massive naval rebuilding programme prior to the First World War saw activity across all the yards, and a new building yard opened at Rosyth. In contrast, the post-war period saw the closure of Pembroke and Rosyth, and the handover of Haulbowline to the new Irish government ‚Äì though the closures were reversed with the return of war in 1939. A series of closures followed the war: Pembroke in 1947, Portland and Sheerness in 1959/60,Copy of government briefing paper then Chatham and Gibraltar (the last remaining overseas yard) in 1984. At the same time, Portsmouth's Royal Dockyard was downgraded and renamed a Fleet Maintenance and Repair Organisation (FMRO). In 1987 the remaining Royal Dockyards (Devonport and Rosyth) were part- privatised, becoming government-owned, contractor-run facilities (run by Devonport Management Limited and Babcock Thorn, respectively); full privatisation followed ten years later (1997). The following year Portsmouth's FMRO was sold to Fleet Support Limited. As of 2019, all three (along with other privately-owned shipyards) continue in operation, to varying degrees, as locations for building (Rosyth) and maintaining ships and submarines of the Royal Navy. Organisation=Senior personnel Commissioner's House, Chatham (1703: the oldest intact building in any Royal Dockyard).Listing text Part of the 17th-century Officer's Terrace survives in Devonport, but it was mostly destroyed in the Blitz Management of the yards was in the hands of the Navy Board until 1832. The Navy Board was represented in each yard by a resident commissioner (though Woolwich and Deptford, being close to the City of London, were for some time overseen directly by the Navy Board). The resident commissioners had wide-ranging powers enabling them to act in the name of the board (particularly in an emergency); however, until 1806 they did not have direct authority over the principal officers of the yard (who were answerable directly to the board). This could often be a source of tension, as everyone sought to guard their own autonomy.J. D. Davies, Pepys's Navy: ships, men and warfare 1649‚Äì89, Seaforth Publishing 2008. The principal officers varied over time, but generally included: * the Master-Shipwright (in charge of shipbuilding, ship repair/maintenance and management of the associated workforce) * the Master Attendant (in charge of launching and docking ships, of ships 'in ordinary' at the yard, and of ship movements around the harbour) * the Storekeeper (in charge of receiving, maintaining and issuing items in storage) * the Clerk of the Cheque (in charge of pay, personnel and certain transactions) * the Clerk of the Survey (in charge of maintaining a regular account of equipment and the transfer of goods) (In practice there was a deliberate overlap of responsibilities among the last three officials listed above, as a precaution against embezzlement). The Principal Officers of a Dockyard were customarily housed in a terrace of houses, as seen here at Sheerness The next tier of officers included those in charge of particular areas of activity (the Master-Caulker, Master-Ropeworker, Master-Boatbuilder, Master-Mastmaker, etc.). In Dockyards where there was a ropewalk (viz Woolwich, Chatham, Portsmouth and Plymouth) there was an additional officer, the Clerk of the Ropeway, who had a degree of autonomy, mustering his own personnel and managing his own raw materials. Ships in commission (and along with them the majority of Naval personnel) were not under the authority of the Navy Board but rather of the Admiralty, which meant that they did not answer to any of the above officers, but rather to the Port Admiral. =After 1832= With the abolition of the Navy Board in 1832, the Admiralty took over the dockyards and the commissioners were replaced by Admiral-Superintendents. The Clerk of the Survey post had been abolished in 1822. The office of Clerk of the Cheque was likewise abolished in 1830 (its duties reverting to the Storekeeper), but then revived as the Cashier's Department in 1865. With the development of steam technology in the 1840s came the senior Dockyard appointment of Chief Engineer. In 1875, the Master-Shipwrights were renamed Chief Constructors (later styled Manager, Constructive Department or MCD). In the latter half of the 19th century, those being appointed as Master Attendants (in common with their namesakes the sailing Masters) began to be commissioned. They began to be given the rank and appointment of \\"Staff Captain (Dockyard)\\" (modified in 1903 to \\"Captain of the Dockyard\\"). In several instances, the appointment of Master Attendant or Captain of the Dockyard was held in common with that of King's or Queen's Harbour Master. For much of the twentieth century, the principal Dockyard departments were overseen by: * Captain of the Dockyard * Manager, Constructive Department (MCD) * Manager, Engineering Department (MED) * Senior Electrical Engineer (SEE) * Senior Naval Stores Officer (SNSO) Associated establishments View from the Commissioner's house in Bermuda: Ordnance Yard, Victualling Yard, Dockyard, Barracks. Ships' ordnance (guns, weapons and ammunition) was provided independently by the Board of Ordnance, which set up its own Ordnance Yards alongside several of the Royal Dockyards both at home and abroad. Similarly, the Victualling Board established Victualling Yards in several Dockyard locations, which furnished warships with their provisions of food, beer and rum. In the mid-eighteenth century the Sick and Hurt Board established Naval Hospitals in the vicinity of Plymouth Dock and Portsmouth; by the mid-nineteenth century there were Royal Naval Hospitals close to most of the major and minor Naval Dockyards in Britain, in addition to several of them overseas (the oldest dating from the early 1700s). As the age of steam eclipsed the age of sail, Coaling Yards were established alongside several yards, and at strategic points around the globe. In addition to naval personnel and civilian workers, there were substantial numbers of military quartered in the vicinity of the Royal Dockyards. These were there to ensure the defence of the yard and its ships. From the 1750s, naval yards in Britain were surrounded by 'lines' (fortifications) with barracks provided for the soldiers manning them. A century later these 'lines' were superseded by networks of Palmerston Forts. Overseas yards also usually had some fort or similar structure provided and manned nearby. Moreover, the Royal Marines, from the time of the Corps' establishment in the mid-18th century, were primarily based in the dockyard towns of Plymouth, Portsmouth and Chatham (and later also in Woolwich and Deal) where their barracks were conveniently placed for duties on board ship or indeed in the Dockyard itself.  United Kingdom dockyards  A lively depiction of Deptford Dockyard in the mid-eighteenth century (John Cleveley the Elder, 1755). Royal Dockyards were established in Britain and Ireland as follows (in chronological order, with date of establishment): 15th century * Portsmouth Dockyard (1496) Rose to prominence during the wars with France, late 18th century. Expanded significantly in the nineteenth century with new facilities for steam engineering and ironclad shipbuilding. Privatised 1993. In November 2013 the operator BAE Systems announced that it was closing its shipbuilding facility at Portsmouth; part of the shipyard will remain open for repair/maintenance.BBC news report 16th century Shipbuilding slips at Chatham * Woolwich Dockyard (1512) Important shipbuilding centre, 16th‚Äì17th centuries. Became a specialist steam yard 1831. Closed 1869. * Erith Dockyard (1512) Erith Dockyard was used as an advance base for routine maintenance before ships were transferred to Deptford Dockyard. It closed due to persistent flooding in 1521. However, according to naval historian Nicholas A. M. Rodger although Erith dockyard closed it was an important center of naval administration of the English Navy from 1514 into the 1540s. * Deptford Dockyard (1513) Important shipbuilding centre, 16th-17th centuries. Experimental yard for new technology, early nineteenth century. Closed 1869. (The adjacent victualling yard, which supplied the Thames and Medway yards, remained open for a further 98 years.) * Chatham Dockyard (1567) The leading Royal Dockyard during the 16th‚Äì17th centuries, when the Fleet was principally based in and around the River Medway.Naval Dockyards Society Began to suffer from silting in the eighteenth century, but remained active. During the nineteenth century, other more accessible yards led on fleet repairs and maintenance, while Chatham focused more on shipbuilding. The following century, it specialised in building submarines. In 1960 the adjacent Royal Navy barracks and facilities were closed; the Dockyard itself closed in 1984. (Today the site is preserved as Chatham Historic Dockyard.) 17th century Royal Navy Dockyard, Pembroke, 1860 HMS Westminster undergoing refit in a covered dry-dock at Devonport, 2009. * Kinsale Dockyard (1647) Served as a supply and repair base (with some evidence of shipbuilding) for the Royal Navy's Irish Squadron, and later as a cruizer base. Closed by 1812, its facilities having relocated to Haulbowline (see below). * Harwich Dockyard (1652) Active during the Anglo-Dutch Wars; closed 1713 (a small Naval yard remained on site, with refit/stores facilities, until 1829.) * Sheerness Dockyard (1665) Originally built for storing and refitting; for much of its history served as a support yard for Chatham. Shipbuilding began in 1720 (mostly smaller ships). Entire dockyard rebuilt to a single design by John Rennie Jnr in 1815‚Äì26. Closed 1960 (site taken over as a commercial port). * Deal Naval Yard (1672) Provided basic repair and supply facilities for ships at anchor nearby in the Downs (albeit without the possibility of ships approaching the shore). Closed in 1864. * Plymouth Dockyard (1690) Pre- eminent, alongside Portsmouth, during the wars with France (1793 onwards). Known as Devonport since 1843.History of the South Yard. (The town of Plymouth Dock had already been renamed Devonport on 1 January 1824). Significant expansion for steam engineering, 1844‚Äì53 and 1896‚Äì1907. Shipbuilding ceased in 1971, but the Yard remains active as a maintenance and repair facility.local news report 19th century * Pembroke Dockyard (1815) Unlike all the previous yards, Pembroke was built purely for shipbuilding rather than for repair and maintenance. It was successor to a yard at Milford Haven leased by the Navy Board for shipbuilding since the late eighteenth century.Pembroke Dock: History Active through to the end of World War One, the yard was closed temporarily in 1923, reopened in the 1930s and closed permanently in 1947. (A small naval base remained on the site until 2008.) * Portland Dockyard (1845) Previously in use as an anchorage, a yard was established here to provide coal for the new steam-powered ships of the Navy. In the 1850s there were plans for dry-docks and building slips, but these were not carried through. Very active through two World Wars, the Dockyard closed in 1959; site taken over as a commercial port. (Adjacent Naval Base and RN Air Station closed in 1995‚Äì99). Naval Storehouses (c.1820) at Haulbowline (now Republic of Ireland) * Haulbowline Dockyard (1869) Haulbowline Island in Cork Harbour was established as a Naval Victualling Yard in 1811 (in succession to an earlier base at Kinsale further along the coast). It was extended in 1869 in order to create a sizeable Royal Navy Dockyard, specialising in ship repair and maintenance. In 1923 the island was handed over to the Irish government; Haulbowline remains the principal Naval base of the Republic of Ireland. A steelworks was established on the site of the Dockyard in 1938.local history site 20th century * Rosyth Dockyard (1909) Built with a strategic view to countering the threat from Germany. Closed after World War One, reopened 1939, and has remained open since. Privatized in 1993, but continues to build and maintain Britain's warships. * Dover Dockyard (1913) In 1847 the government began construction on Dover's Admiralty Pier, envisaged as forming the western arm of a protected haven. This project was only completed after work began on the eastern pier in 1898; the Admiralty Harbour was formally opened in 1909. During both World Wars Dover served as a ship repair station and was listed as a Naval Dockyard. * Invergordon Dockyard (1916) Fully staffed dockyard through World War I, serving the fleet's anchorage in Cromarty Firth. A floating dry dock was towed here from Portsmouth in 1914 and was in use for the duration of the war. Closed after the war, but the Navy maintained the site as an oiling station during World War II, finally withdrawing in 1993. * Scapa Flow Dockyard (1939) Established at Lyness Naval Base and operational through World War II. Other Other, minor yards (with some permanent staff and basic repair/storage facilities) were established in a number of locations over time, usually to serve a nearby anchorage used by Naval vessels. For example, during 18th century a small supply base was maintained at Leith, for ships on Leith Station; but there was no strategic impetus to develop it into a full- blown Dockyard. Similar bases were established during the Napoleonic Wars at Falmouth (for vessels in Carrick Roads) and Great Yarmouth (for vessels in Yarmouth Roads); but both were relatively small-scale and short-lived. A different (and, within the UK, unique) establishment was Haslar Gunboat Yard. Gunboats were small, shallow-draft vessels, developed after the Crimean War, which benefitted from being stored ashore rather than left afloat, to help preserve their light wooden hulls. From 1856 Haslar provided the means to house, launch and haul them ashore by means of a steam-driven traverse system. Overseen by a Master-Shipwright, the Yard stayed in use until 1906, after which it remained in Naval hands as a base for coastal craft until 1973.  Overseas dockyards  Part of Nelson's Dockyard in Antigua * Antigua (1728) Antigua Naval Dockyard was established at English Harbour, which had been used by the Navy since 1671 as a place for shelter and maintenance. A number of buildings were constructed, and several remain (mostly from the 1780s). It served as Admiral Nelson's base in the West Indies during the Napoleonic Wars. The yard closed in 1882 and left abandoned until 1951, but has since been restored and is open to the public as a cultural centre and public marina called Nelson's Dockyard. * Ascension Island (1816) Ascension Dockyard and naval base was established in Georgetown following Napoleon's imprisonment on Saint Helena; it went on to serve as a victualling, repair and supply station for the West Africa Squadron. A Naval Hospital was established on site in 1832, and new facilities for servicing steam warships were added in the 1860s. Naval activity had substantially decreased by the end of the 19th century, but the island remained under Admiralty control until 1922. Still partially supports Falklands' Garrison at Mare Harbour since the 1980s. *Aden (1839) HM Naval Base, Aden was established at Steamer Point the base had been in use from at least 1839 and remained in use by the Royal Navy until 1966. It served as the headquarters of the Naval Officer-in-Charge, Aden, and was a base for the Red Sea Force during World War II. Base closed after independence and now home to civilian dockyards. The floating dry dock Bermuda at HM Dockyard Bermuda Dockyard Commissioner's House in Bermuda (1823‚Äì31) * Bermuda (1795) Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda on Ireland Island was opened in 1809 on land purchased following US Independence. The Royal Navy had previously operated from St. George's Town after a dozen years spent charting the barrier reef, locating an adequate channel by which large naval vessels could reach the Northern Lagoon and the West End of Bermuda. This channel was first used in 1795, enabling the North American fleet to use Murray's Anchorage, with Admiralty House first in St. George's, then Bailey's Bay. Convict Bay, beside St. George's Town became the first base, with other properties at the East End leased or acquired to support it. The blockade of US Atlantic ports during the American War of 1812 was orchestrated from Bermuda, as was the Chesapeake Campaign. Admiralty House moved to Spanish Point in 1816, with the move of the anchorage and shore facilities to the West End. Bermuda became, first the winter location, and then the permanent location of the Admiralty for North America and the West Indies, as well as the base for a naval squadron. After the Second World War the dockyard was no longer deemed relevant to Royal Navy operations and was closed between 1951 (when a floating drydock was removed, and the yard status changed to a base) and 1958, when most of the dockyard, along with other Admiralty and War Office land in Bermuda was sold to the Colonial Government. However, a small base, HMS Malabar, continued to operate from the South Yard throughout the Cold War. This base was finally closed in 1995, 200 years after the establishment of permanent Royal Navy forces in Bermuda. Site re-developed and now include Bermuda Maritime Museum, pedestrian mall and cruise ship dock. Canada: former Naval Storehouse (c.1815), Kingston, Ontario * Canada ** Esquimalt Royal Navy Dockyard, Esquimalt, Canada. In 1865, the Royal Navy relocated its Pacific Station headquarters from Valpara√≠so, Chile, to Esquimalt Harbour (site of a small naval hospital and coaling station since the mid-1850s). In 1887, a naval base was located at Work Point. In 1905, the Royal Navy abandoned its base, but the Pacific Fleet headquarters of the new Royal Canadian Navy replaced it in 1910. Partially home to Pacific Command of the RCN, historic buildings are now preserved. ** Royal Naval Dockyard, Halifax, Canada (1759). Operated as HM Dockyard from 1759 to 1905 and sold to Canada in 1907. It became a RCN facility in 1910 and is now known as HMC Dockyard and is a component of CFB Halifax. ** The Great Lakes, as largely self-contained bodies of water, required their own dockyards to service the Provincial Marine. Several substantial ships were built at these yards during the time of the Napoleonic Wars. *** Amherstburg Royal Naval Dockyard, Amherstburg, Ontario operated from 1796 to 1813. Preserved as national historic site and municipal park. *** Grand River Naval Depot, Port Maitland, Ontario ‚Äì planned facility was never built and now site of Port Maitland Sailing Club. *** √éle aux Noix, operated from 1812 to 1834, the principal yard for Lake Champlain (replacing an earlier establishment at St- Jean). Gunboats were built here. Fort Lennox historic site is now preserved. Rest of island is naturalised as parkland. *** Kingston Royal Naval Dockyard, Kingston, Canada. The RN dockyard operated at Point Frederick from 1789 to 1853; the site was expanded during the War of 1812. It is now closed, this yard was near where the Royal Military College of Canada is now situated. *** Navy Island Royal Naval Shipyard on Navy Island near Niagara Falls, Ontario (1763‚Äì1813). Island has naturalised and now owned by Parks Canada. Not open to public. *** Penetanguishene Naval Yard, Penetanguishene, Ontario operated from 1813 to 1834; transferred to British Army until 1856. Now site preserved as Discovery Harbour. *** Naval Shipyards, York (Upper Canada) from 1798 to 1813. Later became commercial hub for shipyards and wharfs. Since filled in and re- developed as retail and residential neighbourhood. * Ceylon (1813) The naval dockyard at Trincomalee began as a simple careening wharf, with a capstan house and storehouse. It gradually grew, though the Admiralty was also investing in commercial facilities in Colombo. Trincomalee was threatened with closure in 1905 as the Admiralty's focus was on Germany, but it remained in service, and was headquarters of the Eastern Fleet for a time during World War II. In 1957 it was handed over to the Royal Ceylon Navy; today it is the SLN Dockyard of the Sri Lanka Navy. Former Royal Dockyard, Gibraltar * Gibraltar (1704) A small base served the Royal Navy in this strategically important location throughout the 18th and 19th centuries. At the start of the 20th, HM Dockyard, Gibraltar was dramatically expanded and modernised, with the addition of three dry docks (one an unprecedented in length). HM Dockyard was closed in 1984. It is now operated as a commercial facility by Gibdock, although there is still a Royal Navy presence, which provides a maintenance capability. Gibraltar's naval docks are an important base for NATO. British and US nuclear submarines frequently visit the Z berths at Gibraltar.Hansard (A Z berth provides the facility for nuclear submarines to visit for operational or recreational purposes, and for non-nuclear repairs.) * Hong Kong (1859) There was an RN Dockyard from 1859 to 1959 on Hong Kong Island, established on the site of an earlier victualling yard. The base was later known as HMS Tamar; Tamar remained operational after the closure of the dockyard (albeit on a smaller scale) until the year before the Handover. (It then relocated briefly to Stonecutters Island, before closing in 1997). The RN also operated at the Kowloon Naval Yard from 1901 to 1959 (which is different from the Hong Kong & Whampoa dockyard at Hung Hom, known as the Kowloon Dockyard); this was primarily a coaling station. Part of the base is now part of the People's Liberation Army Hong Kong Garrison since 1997 and rest became the Tamar Complex Central Government Complex (Hong Kong). Dockyard building of 1807, Mumbai * India During the Napoleonic Wars the Royal Navy took over Madras Dockyard (1796) and Bombay Dockyard (1811), both of which had been dockyards of the East India Company long before the Navy took charge. Several warships were built under contract in these yards in the early eighteenth century, as was HMS Trincomalee (launched in 1817 and still afloat). Naval Dockyard, Mumbai, is now in the custody of the Indian Navy; the Madras yard closed in 1813, transferring to Ceylon (q.v.). There is also the substantial British built naval base at Cochin. Other facilities were located in Calcutta, and several other places in the Indian Empire ‚Äì e.g. Aden. * Jamaica (1675) Jamaica Dockyard a naval official was stationed in Port Royal from the seventeenth century, and Naval vessels were careened there for maintenance from that time. Following the Port Royal earthquake of 1692, and a succession of damaging hurricanes, a concerted attempt was made from 1729 to relocate Jamaica's naval yard to Port Antonio, an unsettled bay on the opposite side of the island; the climate there was not agreeable, however, there were high levels of sickness and the Navy abandoned Port Antonio in 1749. From 1735 wharves, storehouses and other structures were built anew at Port Royal, and these were updated through the nineteenth century. The yard closed in 1905. Now Naval Heritage Center. * Malta (1800) Malta Dockyard in Valletta, previously operated by the Knights of Malta, became the main base for the Royal Navy's Mediterranean Fleet. The Royal Dockyard closed in 1959; a private yard operated on site thereafter. * Menorca (1708) The Port Mahon Dockyard was established at Port Mahon, one of the world's deepest natural harbours. It was the Royal Navy's principal Mediterranean base for much of the eighteenth century; however the territory changed hands more than once in that time, before being finally ceded to Spain in 1802. The yard is still used by the Spanish Navy. One of the first Royal Naval Hospitals was established here in 1711. Naval Storehouse, c.1890, Garden Island, NSW, Australia * New South Wales, Australia (1859) In 1858 the Admiralty acquired land on Garden Island in Sydney Harbour, and established a small naval base there. In the 1880s it was substantially expanded (though no dry docks were built, as the Navy had use of the facilities at nearby Cockatoo Island Dockyard operated by the Government of New South Wales). In 1913 HM Naval Yard, Garden Island was handed over to the nascent Royal Australian Navy which is based there to this day. * New Zealand (1892) Devonport Dockyard began in the 1890s as a small complex of wooden storehouses; since 1913 it has served as the principal base of the Royal New Zealand Navy. * Singapore (1938) HMNB Singapore was established in the 1930s at Sembawang. It was built around the King George VI Graving Dock (which when opened was the world's largest dry dock). The Naval Base and Dockyard fell into Japanese hands during World War II, and became the target of Allied bombing raids. The base was transferred to the Singapore government in 1971, but is no longer in use by the Singapore Navy (who have since built 2 more modern bases in the island nation); there is, however, a continuing RN presence, along with the RAN and RNZN, under the auspices of the Five Power Defence Arrangements. The US Navy also has a presence at the base: one of the adjacent barracks, formerly known as , is now the main recreation and welfare centre for US Navy personnel, known as the 'Terror Club'. Former mast house and sail loft of 1815 at Simon's Town; now the South African Naval Museum * South Africa (1796) In 1795 Britain inherited two small Dutch East India Company dockyards in Cape Town and nearby Simon's Town, and opted to develop the latter as a naval base. Naval Base Simon's Town is now in the custody of the SANDF. * Wei Hai Wei (1898) The Royal Navy inherited a small dockyard on Liugong Island when this territory was leased from China at the end of the nineteenth century. The yard was expanded, and served as a regular summer anchorage up until the Second World War (though the territory, and with it control of the base, was returned to China in 1930). Used by Japanese forces during World War II and after by People's Liberation Army, some historic buildings remains today.

Akerra means male goat in the Basque language. Witches' sabbaths were envisioned as presided over by a goat. The word has been loaned to Castilian Spanish (which uses the spelling Aquelarre). It has been used in Castilian Spanish since the witch trials of the 17th century. The word is most famous as the title of the witchcraft painting by Goya in the Museo del Prado, which depicts witches in the company of a huge male goat. Witches around the caldron Akelarre in Zugarramurdi. 1998. Pablo S. Quiza Etymology Akelarre (1798), by Francisco Goya. Akelarre, by Francisco Goya The most common etymology proposed is that meaning meadow (larre) of the male goat (aker \\"buck, billy goat\\"). The Spanish Inquisition accused people of worshipping a black goat, related to the worship of Satan. An alternative explanation could be that it originally was alkelarre, alka being a local name for the herb Dactylis hispanica. In this case, the first etymology would have been a manipulation of the Inquisition,J. Dueso, Brujer√≠a en el Pa√≠s Vasco. Orain, 1996. the fact being that the Basques did not know during the 1609-1612 persecution period or later what the \\"akelarre\\" referred to by the inquisitors meant. The word \\"aquelarre\\" is first attested in 1609 in a Spanish language inquisitorial briefing, as synonym to junta diab√≥lica, meaning 'diabolic assembly'. Basque terms, transcribed into Spanish texts often by monolingual Spanish language copyists, were fraught with mistakes. Nevertheless, the black he-Goat or Akerbeltz is known in Basque mythology to be an attribute of goddess Mari and is found in a Roman age slab as a votive dedication: Aherbelts Deo (\\"to the god Aherbelts\\") (see: Aquitanian language)..  Places called Akelarre  *Akelarre: a field of Ma√±aria (Biscay). *Akelarrenlezea: a large cave of Zugarramurdi, (Navarre). The witches met actually outside the cave in the place of Berroskoberro. Some say that the goat talked to its worshippers from a hole in the stone outside the cave. Inside the cave, the widest part measures 120 metres. The river of \\"hell\\" crosses along the centre of the cave. It has been eroding the floor of the cave for centuries, the ceiling of the cave is already 12 metres high. A limestone oven from the eighteenth century remains inside the biggest cave. Farmers found it useful to take more harvest out of the limestone oven. We can access another cave from the biggest cave: the cave of the Akelarre. The name of the cave derives from the meadow at the entrance of the cave. Akelarre used to be celebrated there. Further the river follows a deep gorge called \\"the cave of the witches\\". Other expressive names used for sabbat meeting places in Basque culture include: *Eperlanda: Partridges' field, in Muxika, (Biscay). *Dantzaleku: Dancing place, between Ataun and Idiazabal (Gipuzkoa). *Mandabiita: in Ataun (Gipuzkoa). *Sorginzulo: Witches' hole, in Zegama and another one in Ataun, (both in Gipuzkoa). *Bekatu-larre: Sinful meadow, in Ziordia (Navarre). *Sorgintxulo: Witches' hole, a cave in Hernani (Gipuzkoa). *Atsegin Soro: Pleasure orchard. This was the name by which witches themselves called the field of Matxarena in Errenteria (Gipuzkoa), according to inquisitorial records. *Basajaunberro: Site of Basajaun (the wild man of the woods), in Auritz (Navarre). *Sorginerreka: Witches' creek, in Tolosa (Gipuzkoa). *Edar Iturri: Beautiful Spring, in Tolosa (Gipuzkoa). *Sorginetxe: Witches' house, in Aia (Gipuzkoa). *Akerlanda: Goat's meadow, in Gautegiz Arteaga (Biscay). *Anboto: in Durango (Biscay). *Garaigorta: in Orozko (Biscay). *Petralanda: in Dima (Biscay). *Urkitza: in Urizaharra (Alava). *Abadelaueta: in Etxaguen (Zigoitia, Alava). *Irantzi, Puilegi, Mairubaratza: in Oiartzun (Gipuzkoa). * Larrun mountain: Witches from Bera (Navarre), Sara and Azkaine (Lapurdi) gathered. * Jaizkibel mountain: in Hondarribia (Gipuzkoa). The inquisition heard they celebrated Akelarre near the church of Santa Barbara. Local sayings believe that there were Akelarres in the bridges of Mendelu, Santa Engrazi and Puntalea.  History  From the point of view of anthropology, akelarres would be the remains of pagan rites that were celebrated in clandestinity due to its banning by religious authorities at that time. Although some say the first Akelarres were held in Classical Greece when women, naked and drunk, went up the mountain to celebrate parties without men, this identification is wrong, since they worshipped the God Dionysus and they were not witches. Gossip about sorcerers' meetings spread in the middle ages. However, they probably referred to common women who had knowledge on properties of medicinal herbs. The herb Atropa belladonna has had an important meaning in the legend and symbology of the Akelarre. Hallucinogens were commonly used during the rite in order to achieve ecstasy. It was dangerous to calculate the right dose when the used quantities approached the lethal quantity, and that is why some substances started being applied as an ointment in the vagina or in the anus. That could have given the origin to the legends of sexuality in witches' covens or the use of caldrons to fix the potion. It is possible that they applied the ointment in the vagina with a brush. That would be the explanation of the graphical representation of witches flying with a broomstick between their legs. Some species of toad are poisonous if they come in contact with our skin. The toad's skin is also a hallucinogen, and they also appear in popular beliefs. The same could happen with poisonous mushrooms, such as amanita muscaria.  Zugarramurdi witch-hunt  In 1610, the Spanish Inquisition tribunal of Logro√±o initiated a large witch-hunt in Zugarramurdi and villages around Navarre that resulted in 300 people being accused of practising witchcraft. They took 40 of them to Logro√±o and burnt at the stake 12 supposed witches in Zugarramurdi (5 of them symbolically, as they had been killed by torture earlier). Julio Caro Baroja in his book The World of the Witches explains that Basque witchcraft is known due to this witch-hunt, being one of the most infamous between the European witch-hunts. It was possibly as a result of these major trials that the term akelarre became synonymous with the word \\"witch's sabbath\\" and spread into common parlance in both Basque and Spanish.  Similar celebrations  Similar celebrations spread over the Pyrenees mountains in the Basque Country, Aragon, Catalonia and Occitania. Shepherds brought these beliefs on the way of their annual migration of sheep (transhumance) from mountains to the flatlands. * \\"Ajunt de Bruixes\\", in Catalonia, the most famous of all being celebrated in Canigou mountain, origin of the storms that witches sent to the plain. * Turbon mountain, in Huesca. * The mountains on top of the village Pals, in Andorra. * Macizo de Anaga in Tenerife, Canary Islands. * Salamanca cave, in Salamanca.

The original, opened in 1891 and used until it was replaced by a new larger tunnel in 1995, was the first full-size subaqueous tunnel built in North America. (By full-size it is meant that it allowed a railroad to run through it.) It is a National Historic Landmark of the United States, and has been designated a civil engineering landmark by both US and Canadian engineering bodies. First tunnel (1891-1995) The first underwater rail tunnel in North America was opened by the St. Clair Tunnel Company in 1891. The company was a subsidiary of the Grand Trunk Railway (GTR), which used the new route to connect with its subsidiary Chicago and Grand Trunk Railway, predecessor to the Grand Trunk Western Railroad (GTW). Before the tunnel's construction, Grand Trunk was forced to use time-consuming rail ferries to transfer cargo. The tunnel was an engineering marvel in its day and designed by Joseph Hobson. The development of original techniques were achieved for excavating in a compressed air environment. The Beach tunnelling shield, designed by Alfred Ely Beach, was used to assist workmen in removing material from the route of the tunnel and left a continuous iron tube nearly long. Freight trains used the tunnel initially with the first passenger trains using it in 1892. The tunnel measured from portal to portal. The actual width of the St. Clair River at this crossing is only . The tube had a diameter of and hosted a single standard gauge track. It was built at a cost of $2.7 million. Locomotives Electric-powered St. Clair locomotive, at Port Huron. Steam locomotives were used in the early years to pull trains through the tunnel, however concerns about the potential dangers of suffocation should a train stall in the tunnel led to the installation of catenary wires for electric-powered locomotives by 1907. The first use of electric locomotives through the tunnel in regular service occurred on May 17, 1908. The locomotives were built by Baldwin-Westinghouse. In 1923, the GTR was nationalized by Canada's federal government, which then merged the bankrupt railway into the recently formed Canadian National Railway. CN also assumed control of Grand Trunk Western as a subsidiary and the tunnel company and continued operations much as before. The electric-powered locomotives were retired in 1958 and scrapped in 1959 after CN retired and scrapped its last steam-powered locomotives on trains passing through the tunnel. New diesel- powered locomotives did not cause the same problems with air quality in this relatively short tunnel. Freight cars After the Second World War, railways in North America started to see the dimensions of freight cars increase. Canadian National (identified as CN after 1960) was forced to rely upon rail ferries to carry freight cars, such as hicube boxcars, automobile carriers, certain intermodal cars and chemical tankers, which exceeded the limits of the tunnel's dimensions. Recognition The tunnel was designated a Civil Engineering Landmark by both the Canadian and the American Societies of Civil Engineers in 1991. The tunnel was declared a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 1993. (includes diagrams) and The construction of the tunnel has also been recognized as National Historic Event by Parks Canada since 1992, with a plaque at the site. Second tunnel (1995-present) left The second tunnel was built to handle intermodal rail cars with double-stacked shipping containers, which could not fit through the original tunnel or the Michigan Central Railway Tunnel in Detroit. By the early 1990s, CN had commissioned engineering studies for a replacement tunnel to be built adjacent to the existing St. Clair River tunnel. In 1992, new CN president Paul Tellier foresaw that CN would increase its traffic in the Toronto‚ÄìChicago corridor. The Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement was implemented in 1989 and discussions for a North American Free Trade Agreement between Canada, the United States and Mexico discussions were underway at that time (NAFTA was implemented in 1994). It was only logical that import/export traffic on CN's corridor would increase dramatically. In 1993, CN began construction of the newer and larger tunnel. Tellier declared at the ceremonies: > \\"[the] tunnel will give CN the efficiencies it needs to become a strong > competitive force in North American transportation\\" Unlike the first tunnel, which was hand dug from both ends, an earth boring machine called the Excalibore made by the Lovat Tunnel Equipment Inc. was used. It started on the Canadian side and dug its way to the U.S. The tunnel opened later in 1994 whereupon freight and passenger trains stopped using the adjacent original tunnel, whose bore was sealed. The new tunnel was dedicated on May 5, 1995 and measures from portal to portal with a bore diameter of with a single standard gauge track. It could accommodate all freight cars currently in service in North America, thus the rail ferries were also retired in 1994 at the time of the tunnel's completion and opening for service. On November 30, 2004, CN announced that the new St. Clair River tunnel would be named the Paul M. Tellier Tunnel in honour of the company's retired president, Paul Tellier, who foresaw the impact the tunnel would have on CN's eastern freight corridor. A sign now hangs over each tunnel portal with this name.

The identity and nature of the poison has been a source of speculation for centuries.  Shakespeare's Usage  Hebenon is the agent of death in Hamlet's father's murder; it sets in motion the events of the play. It is spelled hebona in the Quartos and hebenon in the Folios. This is the only mention of hebona or hebenon in any of Shakespeare‚Äôs plays. ::Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole, ::With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial, ::And in the porches of my ears did pour ::The leperous distilment; whose effect ::Holds such an enmity with blood of man ::That, swift as quicksilver, it courses through ::The natural gates and alleys of the body; ::And with a sudden vigour it doth posset ::And curd, like eager droppings into milk, ::The thin and wholesome blood; so did it mine; ::And a most instant tetter bark'd about, ::Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust ::All my smooth body. ::Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand, ::Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd: :::-Ghost (King Hamlet, Hamlet's Father) spoken to Hamlet ::::::::::[Act I, scene 5] Identity of the poison Writers from Shakespeare's time to the present have speculated about the identity of hebenon. It may be different from hemlock, as hemlock is explicitly mentioned in several other writings of his (including King Lear, Macbeth and Henry V). In favor of it being yew are the familiarity of yew as a poison and the similarity in symptoms. Edmund Spenser wrote of \\"the deadly heben bow\\"Seymour, Mirinda (2000, May 20). \\"Country & Garden: Herbs - no 22: Henbane\\", The Independent. ProQuest document ID 311652931 (\\"heben\\" being a word for ebony, from Latin hebenus). In favor of ebony (specifically, guaiac) is the fact that ebony was sometimes written with an h, but arguing against it is the low toxicity of guaiac. In favour of henbane is its toxic nature and the possible origin of hebenon as metathesis from henbane. Other authors question whether there is sufficient evidence to resolve the issue, or even whether Shakespeare's attention to botany and pharmacology was sufficient to say he meant a specific plant.

Launched in June 2005 as a sister magazine for Shonen Jump, it featured serialized chapters from six manga series, as well as articles on Japanese culture, manga, anime, fashion and beauty. After its initial launch, Shojo Beat underwent two redesigns, becoming the first English anthology to use the cyan and magenta ink tones common to Japanese manga anthologies. Viz launched a related imprint of the same name for female-oriented manga, light novels and anime. Targeted at women ages 16‚Äì18, the first issue of Shojo Beat launched with a circulation of 20,000. By 2007, the average circulation was approximately 38,000 copies, with half coming from subscriptions rather than store sales. It was well received by critics, who praised its mix of manga series and the inclusion of articles on Japanese culture, though some critics found the early issues boring and poorly written. In May 2009, Viz announced that it was discontinuing the magazine; the July 2009 issue was the last released. Fans were disappointed at the sudden news. Industry experts felt its loss would leave female comic fans without a magazine of their own, but praised Viz for its choice to continue using the \\"Shojo Beat\\" imprint and branding for its sh≈çjo manga and anime releases. History In February 2005, Viz Media announced the creation of a new manga anthology, Shojo Beat. Marketed as a sister publication of Viz's existing Shonen Jump, the magazine started with six manga titles: Crimson Hero, Kaze Hikaru, Baby & Me, Godchild, Nana, and Absolute Boyfriend. Of the six titles, two each came from Japanese publishers Shueisha, Shogakukan, and Hakusensha. The first issue, released in June 2005, featured Nana Komatsu of Nana on its July cover. Yumi Hoashi was the publication's original editor-in-chief. In November 2006, Hoashi left Viz, and Marc Weidenbaum replaced him as the magazine's editor-in-chief. Weidenbaum remained the magazine's editor until February 13, 2009, when Viz announced that he had left the company, though the magazine continued to list his name in the role through the May 2009 issue. Starting with the June 2009 issue, publisher Hyoe Narita was listed as the editor-in-chief. The magazine's panda mascot, Moko, was first introduced in the October 2005 issue, though he remained nameless until the July 2006 issue. He later was given his own MySpace account run by Viz. With the July 2007 issue, a new mascot, Beat Girl, was introduced. Included in each issue on the \\"Editor's Letter\\" page as the magazine's \\"illustrated spokesperson,\\" she was drawn by different artists each time. A third mascot, a star-shaped figure named Hoshiko, was introduced with the March 2008 issue as a friend for Moko. With the magazine's first anniversary issue, dated July 2006, Shojo Beat switched to using cyan and magenta ink tones for the manga pages rather than black-and-white. Though this mirrors the format of Japanese manga anthologies, it was a first for manga anthologies published in North America. Shojo Beat launched another redesign with the January 2007 issue. The new design included more vivid color schemes and fonts and introduced a new \\"Girl Hero\\" column to spotlight women Viz felt were charitable and selfless and who would inspire readers. The existing columns were also expanded. In May 2009, the magazine stopped accepting new subscriptions and ceased publication with the release of the July issue. Existing Shojo Beat subscriptions were transferred to Viz's Shonen Jump magazine. With the first copy of Shonen Jump sent to former subscribers, a letter informed them of the transfer and how to request a refund for the unfilled portion of their subscriptions if they would prefer. In a press release, Viz stated that the \\"difficult economic climate\\" was behind the magazine's cancellation. Features As a manga anthology, the bulk of Shojo Beat's content was its manga chapters. Additional features included a letter from the editor, manga related news, a preview chapter from another Viz manga title being published under the \\"Shojo Beat\\" imprint, and articles on Japanese culture, current trends in Japan, and fashion and beauty. Sections toward the back of the magazine featured fan-related material, including fan art, letters from readers, manga drawing lessons, and cosplay how-to guides and highlights. The magazine's official website included additional articles, downloads of templates for dressing up the magazine's panda mascot \\"Moko\\", and online previews of many of the manga series being published under the \\"Shojo Beat\\" label. Series Shojo Beat contained chapters from six Japanese manga series licensed and translated to English by Viz. During its run, the magazine featured fourteen series, of which seven ended their runs and were replaced by other series. Only four of those replacements remained in the magazine until all of their chapters had been published. Each title serialized in the magazine was also published in tank≈çbon volumes under Viz's \\"Shojo Beat\\" label. Viz noted that it periodically removed incomplete series from the magazine to help \\"keep the magazine fresh\\" and to allow it to speed up publication of the individual volumes. This is a complete list of all titles that were serialized in Shojo Beat. It does not include preview chapters. The titles that were running in the magazine when it was discontinued are highlighted. Imprints With the launch of the Shojo Beat magazine, Viz Media created new imprints for its manga and fiction lines. The \\"Shojo Beat\\" imprint included series featured in the magazine as well as other sh≈çjo manga titles licensed by Viz after the magazine's conception. Viz began releasing a few Japanese light novels under a \\"Shojo Beat Fiction\\" imprint that were related to its \\"Shojo Beat\\" manga titles. In February 2006, Viz launched the \\"Shojo Beat Home Video\\" line for releasing anime titles primarily designed for female viewers. The first title under the new imprint was Full Moon o Sagashite, the anime adaptation of the same titled manga that was also released by Viz. To promote the new anime line, Viz included a preview disc of the first volume of Full Moon in the June 2006 issue of Shojo Beat. Though the magazine itself has been canceled, Viz stated in May 2009 that it will continue releasing both existing and new series under the \\"Shojo Beat\\" manga and anime imprints. Circulation and audience When Shojo Beat launched, it had a circulation of 20,000. In 2006, its average circulation had increased to 35,000, of which 41% were distributed through subscriptions, and the rest sold in newsstands and stores. In 2007, the circulation grew to 38,000, and subscriptions increased to 51%. The magazine's audience was overwhelmingly female, comprising 91% of its readers. Targeted towards \\"young women\\", Shojo Beats \\"core audience\\" was between the ages of 13 and 19 and made up 61% of its readers; 47% of readers were 12‚Äì17 and 45% were 18‚Äì34. Reception Shojo Beat was nominated for a 2008 Society for the Promotion of Japanese Animation Award in the category of \\"Best Publication\\", but lost to Japan's Newtype. In reviewing the premiere release of Shojo Beat, IGN's Jessica Chobot sharply criticized the magazine. She felt it looked and read \\"like a teenie-bopper magazine\\" and referred to the issue's cover as a \\"bright, hot-pink, migraine- inducing, bubble-lettered spectacle\\". She considered the contents boring, and disagreed with Viz's selection of series, noting, \\"it's as if Viz had taken everything from their backed-up reject pile and tried to pull one over on the female populace. 90% of what I was reading was either poorly drawn or poorly written (more often than not, it was both).\\" Comic World News' David Welsh disagreed, as he felt that the magazine had several good series, and he praised Nana, Absolute Boyfriend and Crimson Hero as the top three series of the initial issue. Greg McElhatton, co-founder of Wizard: The Guide to Comics and former reviewer for iComics.com, praised the magazine's mainstream appearance, calling it a \\"smart\\" decision, as it would draw in its target audience by visually showing them that it's a magazine for teenage girls. While he felt that two of the manga titles in the premiere issue had weak openings, he found that the magazine was \\"off to a good, if not great start\\". After its cancellation, Publishers Weeklys Heidi MacDonald reported that the common response she saw from fans was that \\"everyone liked it but nobody paid for it\\". She noted that many fans expressed sorrow over the magazine's demise while indicating that they did not subscribe to it. Katherine Dacey, the former senior manga editor for PopCultureShock, remarked that the magazine had offered \\"just the right mixture of new stories, continuing series, and articles\\" and praised it for having a \\"funky, DIY vibe\\". The staff of the School Library Journal called the magazine \\"one of a kind\\" and felt that its loss would leave a void for female fans, a generally under-acknowledged group of comic and manga readers. Staff member Brigid Alverson felt Shojo Beat was a great overall package that \\"featured intelligent articles that allowed the reader to be enthusiastic about Japanese pop culture without being geeky\\" making it distinct from other magazines for girls that were normally \\"filled with brainless celebrity stories or service articles tied to commercial products\\". Other participants praised the magazine's fashion articles for its educational articles on Japanese culture and for featuring girls of a variety of body types wearing affordable fashions. Two staffers questioned Viz's decision to drop the magazine and wondered if the company had unrealistically expected the magazine to have the same circulation numbers as Shonen Jump.

Localized application of heat causes the blood vessels in that area to dilate, enhancing perfusion to the targeted tissue. Types of heating pads include electrical, chemical and hot water bottles. Specialized heating pads (mats) are also used in other settings. Heat mats in plant propagation stimulates seed germination and root development; they operate at cooler temperatures. Heat mats also are available in the pet trade, especially as warming spots for reptiles such as lizards and snakes. Types An electric heating pad Electrical Electric pads usually operate from household current and must have protection against overheating. A moist heating pad is used dry on the user's skin. These pads register temperatures from and are intended for deep tissue treatment and can be dangerous if left on unattended. Moist heating pads are used mainly by physical therapists but can be found for home use. A moist cloth can be added with a stupe cover to add more moisture to the treatment. An electric heating pouch is similar in form to an electric heating pad, but is curved to wrap around a joint. Chemical A sodium acetate heat pad Disposable chemical pads employ a one-time exothermic chemical reaction. One type, frequently used for hand warmers, is triggered by unwrapping an air-tight packet containing slightly moist iron powder and salt or catalysts which rusts over a period of hours after being exposed to oxygen in the air. Another type contains separate compartments within the pad; when the user squeezes the pad, a barrier ruptures and the compartments mix, producing heat such as the enthalpy change of solution of calcium chloride dissolving. The most common reusable heat pads contain a supersaturated solution of sodium acetate in water. Crystallization is triggered by flexing a small flat disc of notched ferrous metal embedded in the liquid. Pressing the disc releases very tiny adhered crystals of sodium acetate into the solution which then act as nucleation sites for the crystallization of the sodium acetate into the hydrated salt (sodium acetate trihydrate, CH3COONa¬∑3H2O). Because the liquid is supersaturated, this makes the solution crystallize suddenly, thereby releasing the energy of the crystal lattice. The use of the metal disc was invented in 1978.Reusable heat pack containing supercooled solution and means for activating same. US Patent 4,077,390 (1978) The pad can be reused by placing it in boiling water for 10‚Äì15 minutes, which redissolves the sodium acetate trihydrate in the contained water and recreates a supersaturated solution. Once the pad has returned to room temperature it can be triggered again. Triggering the pad before it has reached room temperature results in the pad reaching a lower peak temperature, as compared to waiting until it had completely cooled. High specific-heat capacity materials Heating packs can also be made by filling a container with a material that has a high specific heat capacity, which then gradually releases the heat over time. A hot water bottle is the most familiar example of this type of heating pad. A microwavable heating pad is a heating pad that is warmed by placing it in a microwave oven before use. Microwavable heating pads are typically made out of a thick insulative fabric such as flannel and filled with grains such as wheat, buckwheat or flax seed. Due to their relative simplicity to make, they are frequently sewn by hand, often with a custom shape to fit the intended area of use. Often, aromatic compounds will also be added to the filler mixture to create a pleasant or soothing smell when heated. The source of these can vary significantly, ranging from adding essential oils to ground up spices such as cloves and nutmeg, or even dried rose petals. Phase- change materials Phase change materials can be used for heating pads intended to operate at a fixed temperature. The heat of fusion is used to release the thermal energy. This results in the pad heating up.  Function  Many episodes of pain come from muscle exertion or strain, which creates tension in the muscles and soft tissues. This tension can constrict circulation, sending pain signals to the brain. Heat application eases pain by: * dilating the blood vessels surrounding the painful area. Increased blood flow provides additional oxygen and nutrients to help heal the damaged muscle tissue. * stimulating sensation in the skin and therefore decreasing the pain signals being transmitted to the brain * increasing the flexibility (and decreasing painful stiffness) of soft tissues surrounding the injured area, including muscles and connective tissue. As many heating pads are portable, heat may be applied as needed at home, at work, or while traveling. Some physicians recommend alternating heat and ice for pain relief. As with any pain treatment, a physician should be consulted prior to beginning treatment.

Commonly this person is identified as \\"John Doe\\" or \\"Jane Doe\\". As the statute of limitations for many torts such as medical malpractice is generally very short, plaintiffs under pressure to issue an originating process such as a statement of claim often use contrived names such as John Doe in the title of proceedings and identify the person's role in the lawsuit in the body of the pleading. Generally, this tactic preserves the limitation period and, with leave of the court, the plaintiff can later substitute the real name of the defendant once it is learned during the discovery process. For example, in a medical malpractice case, the plaintiff may have been treated by doctors and nurses he or she may have seen, but did not know the names of at the time. This is particularly true of plaintiffs who may have been unconscious during long periods of their treatment. At the beginning of the lawsuit, it may be impossible to determine which medical professional was negligent, so all persons who treated the plaintiff must be sued. However, the hospital records available to the plaintiff may be limited or unintelligible, and the hospital that does have the records may refuse to release them unless litigation is pending. Typically, the plaintiff will plead as follows: In the case of John Smith vs. Jones Memorial Hospital and Dr. John Doe. # Jones Memorial Hospital is a hospital in the city of Anytown, USA. # Dr. John Doe is a doctor employed by Jones Memorial, and at all relevant times was the plaintiff's treating physician. The identity of the treating physician is unknown to the plaintiff despite the plaintiff's best efforts to identify the doctor. Once the originating pleading is issued, the plaintiff is usually required to work with all deliberate speed to determine the names of the fictitious defendants through discovery of the defendants it is aware of. If the plaintiff delays too long, the court generally will not allow amendment of the claim to substitute the names of the appropriate party, and any valid claims against those defendants may become statute barred. However, the plaintiff may not, through the action of the fictitious defendants or the other defendants to the lawsuit, be prejudiced by any delay caused by obstruction or refusal to reveal the identities of the fictitious witnesses.

Unlike the chain store business model, IGA operates as a franchise through stores that are owned separately from the brand. Many of these stores operate in small town markets and belong to families that manage them. It was founded in the United States as the Independent Grocers Alliance in 1926. The headquarters is in Chicago, Illinois. United States IGA was started in May 1926 when a group of 100 independent retailers in Poughkeepsie, New York, and Sharon, Connecticut, led by J. Frank Grimes, organized themselves into a single marketing system. Guidance from the IGA management came in the form of marketing and access to a consistent supply chain. After a few years, the company began making its own canned food brand. By the end of its first year, the group had expanded to include more than 150 retailers. In 1930, there were over 8,000 grocery stores using the IGA name. William Olsen was the company CEO until 1988, when he was replaced by Thomas Haggai. Haggai retired in 2016. The company uses the \\"Hometown Proud Supermarkets\\" slogan. Today, many IGA grocery stores are still located in smaller cities and towns throughout the United States. The stores in the alliance remain independently owned and operated. The alliance oversees several resources shared among the member stores. These include, most visibly, the IGA store brand products and the logistical network that distributes them. The alliance also provides training and assessment programs and an online advertising platform. It regularly coordinates promotional events and charity fundraising events that benefit store communities. Canada Logo used in Quebec markets since January 1990. Prior to that, the international IGA logo was used. IGA store (left) on Dundas Street in Toronto, September 1957. In Canada (apart from British Columbia), IGA is a group of independent grocers supplied by Sobeys, which franchises the name. Acquired by Sobeys as part of its purchase of the Oshawa Group Ltd., it now operates primarily in Quebec. The IGA operations in Atlantic Canada were sold to Loblaw Companies Limited (except for Edmundston, New Brunswick) and were restructured under its existing brands. The company-owned stores west of Quebec now mainly operate under the Sobeys banner. In Ontario, Sobeys announced the closure of the IGA program in Ontario, forcing franchise-owned IGA stores to convert to the Foodland banner in order to remove control of independently owned stores from their respective operators and impose Sobeys' own policies for their operation. There are, however, many IGA stores still operating in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta, with one opening in Emerald Park, Saskatchewan in 2016. IGA Extra locations are larger and carry a wider variety of general merchandise, more akin to the hypermarket model. They include a pharmacy, large bakery, a bank, a bistro, a post office and a larger selection of food items. IGA Extra launched in the early 2000s to take the place of Sobeys locations in the Quebec City and Montreal areas. In 2015, several COOP Atlantic stores became IGA stores supplied by Sobeys Quebec after COOP decided to exit the grocery store business. In Quebec, IGA also operates smaller supermarkets. These include Bonichoix and Tradition (a brand introduced in 1999). In British Columbia, IGA stores (previously Marketplace IGA) are, for the most part, independently owned and are operated by Georgia Main Food Group.H.Y. Louie Co.

Australia The IGA brand in Australia is owned by Metcash, an Australian retailer and wholesaler. This company supplies groceries, promotional materials and other things to a large number of locally owned Australian supermarkets, and a few smaller chains. Collectively, they are the third biggest competitor in major Australian supermarkets, after Coles and Woolworths. There are 1,400 independently owned IGA stores throughout Australia, each running their own IGA Community Chest, which raises funds to support local communities and charities. In Western Australia On May 1, 2006, IGA grew to include Dewsons, Action, Advantage, Four Square and SupaValu after Western Australia's largest independent retailer Foodland Associated Limited had sold all of its supermarkets and distribution networks to Metcash IGA Distribution Pty Ltd and Woolworths Limited.

Its population in 2014 was 6,367. The town received some notice in July 2008 in the nationally syndicated American comic strip Gil Thorp as the place to which Milford High baseball player ‚Äî and illegal immigrant ‚Äî Elmer Vargas is deported.  History  The region was inhabited by Otomi, head Indians. The spiritual conquest was mainly carried out by the Franciscan Juna de Padilla. The town was first in the place called Jaconoxtle and in the first half of the eighteenth century settled on the current site. With the conquest, Atemajac was nestled among the towns of the so-called Province of √Åvalos and subsequently the provinces attached to Nueva Galicia were left. On November 22, 1824, by Art. 9 (which adds the articles of the State Provisional Division Plan) it was decreed: The towns of Atemajac and Juanacatl√°n will be added to the department of Zacoalco. It belonged to the fourth canton of Sayula and third department of Zacoalco. On April 25, 1903, by decree 997, the State Congress issued a decree that says: The population of Atemajac de las Tablas, from the 4th Canton of the state, will be referred to as Atemajac de Brizuela. Such designation was in honor of Colonel Miguel Brizuela. Atemajac de Brizuela exists as a municipality since 1884, by decree of April 4 called before Atemajac de las Tablas.  Location  Atemajac de Brizuela is located south of the state at coordinates 20¬∫05'00 \\"at 20¬∫16'30\\" north latitude, and 103¬∫35'00 \\"at 103¬∫57'20\\" west longitude, at a height of 2,250 meters above the level from sea. The municipality of Atemajac de Brizuela borders to the north with the municipalities of Cocula, Villa Corona, Zacoalco de Torres; to the east with the municipalities of Zacoalco de Torres, Techaluta de Montenegro; to the south with the municipalities of Techaluta de Montenegro, Tapalpa and Chiquilistl√°n; to the west with the municipalities of Chiquilistl√°n, Tecolotl√°n and Cocula.  Orography  The rugged areas (53%) predominate with heights ranging from 2,250 to 2,600 meters above sea level in some of the foothills of the Sierra de Tapalpa. There are also flat areas (30%) with heights of 2,200 to 2,250 meters above sea level and semi-flat areas (17%).  Terrain  The territory is made up of land belonging to the tertiary period. The composition of the soils is of predominant types Feozem H√°plico, Cambisol Chromic and Andosol M√≥lica. The municipality has a territorial area of 19,157 ha, of which 5,229 are used for agricultural purposes, 3,394 in livestock, 10,361 are for forest use and 173 hectares are urban land. As far as the property is concerned, an extension of 10,604 hectares is private and another of 8,553 hectares is ejidal; There is no communal property.  Hydrography  The hydrological resources available to the municipality are: the Carrizal River; the streams: Agua Prieta, San Juan and El Salto; there are also some water eyes and several springs.  Weather  The climate is semi-dry, with dry winter, and mild, with mild winter. The average annual temperature is 19 ¬∞ C, with a maximum of 26 ¬∞ C and a minimum of 0 ¬∞ C. The rainfall regime is recorded in the months of June and July, with an average rainfall of 814.5 millimeters. The annual average of days with frosts is 39.

Each cerebral hemisphere contains a lateral ventricle, known as the left or right ventricle, respectively. Each lateral ventricle resembles a C-shaped cavity that begins at an inferior horn in the temporal lobe, travels through a body in the parietal lobe and frontal lobe, and ultimately terminates at the interventricular foramina where each lateral ventricle connects to the single, central third ventricle. Along the path, a posterior horn extends backward into the occipital lobe, and an anterior horn extends farther into the frontal lobe. Structure Lateral ventricles and horns The lateral ventricles connected to the third ventricle by the interventricular foramina Each lateral ventricle takes the form of an elongated curve, with an additional anterior-facing continuation emerging inferiorly from a point near the posterior end of the curve; the junction is known as the trigone of the lateral ventricle. The centre of the superior curve is referred to as the body, while the three remaining portions are known as horns (cornua in Latin); they are usually referred to by their position relative to the body (anterior, posterior, or inferior), or sometimes by the lobe of the cerebral cortex into which they extend. Though somewhat flat, the lateral ventricles have a vaguely triangular cross-section. Ependyma, which are neuroepithelial cells, line the ventricular system including the lateral ventricles. Between the inferior horn and the main body of the ventricle is the putamen, which emerges from the head of the caudate nucleus, and sits above the tapetum; a small number of further connections passing through the occipital tapetum to join the putamen to portions of the caudate nucleus tail adjoining the anterior horn. Below the putamen sits the globus pallidus, with which it connects. These structures bounding the lateral ventricles form a frame curving around the thalamus, which itself constitutes the main structure bounding the third ventricle. Were it not for the choroid plexus, a cleft-like opening would be all that lay between the lateral ventricle and the thalamus; this cleft constitutes the lower part of the choroid fissure. The thalamus primarily communicates with the structures bounding the lateral ventricles via the globus pallidus, and the anterior extremities of the fornix (the mamillary bodies). Anterior horn of lateral ventricle Anterior horn shown in red. The anterior horn of the lateral ventricle is also known as the frontal horn as it extends into the frontal lobe. The anterior horn connects to the third ventricle, via the interventricular foramen. This portion of the lateral ventricle impinges on the frontal lobe, passing anteriorly and laterally, with slight inclination inferiorly. It is separated from the anterior horn of the other lateral ventricle by a thin neural sheet - septum pellucidum, which thus forms its medial boundary. The boundary facing exterior to the ventricle curvature is formed by the corpus callosum - the floor at the limit of the ventricle is the upper surface of the rostrum (the reflected portion of the corpus callosum), while nearer the body of the ventricle, the roof consists of the posterior surface of the genu. The remaining boundary - that facing interior to the ventricle curvature - comprises the posterior edge of the caudate nucleus. Body of the lateral ventricle Body of lateral ventricle shown in red. The body of the lateral ventricle, or central part is the part of the ventricle between the anterior horn and the trigone. Its roof is bound by the tapetum of the corpus callosum - and is separated medially from the other lateral ventricle by the septum pellucidum. The tail of the caudate nucleus forms the upper portion of the lateral edge, but it is not large enough to cover the whole boundary. Immediately below the tail of the caudate nucleus, the next portion of the lateral edge is formed by the comparatively narrow stria terminalis, which sits upon the superior thalamostriate vein. The main part of the fornix of the brain forms the next narrow portion of the lateral boundary, which is completed medially by a choroid plexus, which serves both ventricles. Trigone of lateral ventricle Trigone of lateral ventricle shown in red. The trigone of the lateral ventricle is the area where the part of the body forms a junction with the inferior horn and the posterior horn. This area is referred to as the atrium of the lateral ventricle, and is where the choroid plexus is enlarged as the choroid glomus. As a triangular surface feature of the floor of this part of the lateral ventricle it is known as the collateral trigone. Posterior horn of lateral ventricle Posterior horn shown in red. The posterior horn of lateral ventricle, or occipital horn, impinges into the occipital lobe in a posterior direction, initially laterally but subsequently curving medially and lilting inferiorly on the lateral side. The tapetum of the Corpus Callosum continues to form the roof, which due to the lilt is also the lateral edge. However, the posterior and anterior ends of the Corpus Callosum are characterised by tighter bundling, known as forceps (due to the resulting shape), to curve around the central sulci; the edge of these forceps form the upper part of the medial side of the posterior horn. The remainder of the medial edge of the ventricle is directly in contact with white matter of the cortex of the occipital lobe. Inferior horn of lateral ventricle Inferior horn shown in red. The inferior horn of the lateral ventricle, or temporal horn, is the largest of the horns. It impinges on the temporal lobe in a lateral and anterior direction, initially inferiorly, until it comes within 2.5 cm. of the lobe's apex; its direction is fairly well indicated on the brain surface by the superior temporal sulcus. The horn lilts inferiorly towards its lateral edge. As a continuation of the interior side of the ventricular curve, the floor of the body of the ventricle becomes the roof of the inferior horn, hence the tail of the caudate nucleus forms the lateral edge of the inferior horn's roof, until, at the extremity of the ventricle, the caudate nucleus becomes the amygdala. The stria terminalis forms the remainder of the roof, which is much narrower than at the body - the choroid plexus moves to the medial wall. The tapetum for the temporal lobe comprises the lateral boundary of the inferior horn, on its way to join the main tapetum above the body of the ventricle (passing over the Caudate Nucleus as it does so). The majority of the inferior horn's floor is formed by the fimbria hippocampi (from which the fornix emerges), and then, more anteriorly, by the hippocampus itself. As with the posterior horn, the remainder of the boundary - in this case the lateral side of the floor - is directly in contact with the white matter of the surrounding lobe.  Development  The lateral ventricles, similarly to other parts of the ventricular system of the brain, develop from the central canal of the neural tube. Specifically, the lateral ventricles originate from the portion of the tube that is present in the developing prosencephalon, and subsequently in the developing telencephalon. During the first three months of prenatal development, the central canal expands into lateral, third, and fourth ventricles, connected by thinner channels. In the lateral ventricles, specialized areas ‚Äì choroid plexuses ‚Äì appear, which produce cerebrospinal fluid. The neural canal that does not expand and remains the same at the level of the midbrain superior to the fourth ventricle forms the cerebral aqueduct. The fourth ventricle narrows at the obex (in the caudal medulla), to become the central canal of the spinal cord. During development, pressure from exterior structures causes a number of concave bulges to form within the lateral ventricles, which can be extremely variable in their degree of development; in some individuals they are ill- defined, while in others they can be prominent: *from the forceps against the posterior horn - creating the bulb of the posterior cornu on the upper medial side of the horn *from the calcarine sulcus against the posterior horn - creating the calcar avis (historically called the hippocampus minor, for visual reasons) on the lower medial side of the horn *from the hippocampus against the inferior horn (on the medial floor of the horn) *from the collateral sulcus against the inferior horn - creating the Collateral eminence on the lateral floor of the horn. Fetal lateral ventricles may be diagnosed using linear or planar measurements.  Clinical significance  The volume of the lateral ventricles are known to increase with age. They are also enlarged in a number of neurological conditions and are on average larger in patients with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder,Kempton, M.J., Geddes, J.R, Ettinger, U. et al. (2008). \\"Meta-analysis, Database, and Meta-regression of 98 Structural Imaging Studies in Bipolar Disorder,\\" Archives of General Psychiatry, 65:1017‚Äì1032 see also MRI database at www.bipolardatabase.org. major depressive disorder see also MRI database at www.depressiondatabase.org and Alzheimer's disease. Asymmetry as an anatomical variation, in the size of the lateral ventricles is found in about 5‚Äì12% of the population. This has been associated with handedness, where right-handed people have been found to have a larger right lateral ventricle and a longer left posterior horn, whereas left-handed people have been found to have longer right posterior horns. A severe asymmetry, or an asymmetry with midline shift or diffuse enlargement, may indicate brain injury early in life, particularly in cases of a longer right posterior horn. If the production of cerebrospinal fluid is bigger than its reabsorption, or if its circulation is blocked ‚Äì the ventricles may enlarge and cause hydrocephalus. Calcification of the choroid plexus can occur, usually in the atrium.  Additional images  File:Lateral ventricle small.gifPosition of lateral ventricles (shown in red).

The theorem is important because, in quantum mechanics, quantum entanglement is an effect by which certain widely separated events can be correlated in ways that suggest the possibility of instantaneous communication. The no-communication theorem gives conditions under which such transfer of information between two observers is impossible. These results can be applied to understand the so-called paradoxes in quantum mechanics, such as the EPR paradox, or violations of local realism obtained in tests of Bell's theorem. In these experiments, the no-communication theorem shows that failure of local realism does not lead to what could be referred to as \\"spooky communication at a distance\\" (in analogy with Einstein's labeling of quantum entanglement as requiring \\"spooky action at a distance\\" on the assumption of QM's completeness). Informal overview The no-communication theorem states that, within the context of quantum mechanics, it is not possible to transmit classical bits of information by means of carefully prepared mixed or pure states, whether entangled or not. The theorem disallows all communication, not just faster-than-light communication, by means of shared quantum states. The theorem disallows not only the communication of whole bits, but even fractions of a bit. This is important to take note of, as there are many classical radio communications encoding techniques that can send arbitrarily small fractions of a bit across arbitrarily narrow, noisy communications channels. In particular, one may imagine that there is some ensemble that can be prepared, with small portions of the ensemble communicating a fraction of a bit; this, too, is not possible. The theorem is built on the basic presumption that the laws of quantum mechanics hold. Similar theorems may or may not hold for other related theories,S. Popescu, D. Rohrlich (1997) \\"Causality and Nonlocality as Axioms for Quantum Mechanics\\", Proceedings of the Symposium on Causality and Locality in Modern Physics and Astronomy (York University, Toronto, 1997). such as hidden variable theories. The no-communication theorem is not meant to constrain other, non-quantum-mechanical theories. The basic assumption entering into the theorem is that a quantum-mechanical system is prepared in an initial state, and that this initial state is describable as a mixed or pure state in a Hilbert space H. The system then evolves over time in such a way that there are two spatially distinct parts, A and B, sent to two distinct observers, Alice and Bob, who are free to perform quantum mechanical measurements on their portion of the total system (viz, A and B). The question is: is there any action that Alice can perform on A that would be detectable by Bob making an observation of B? The theorem replies 'no'. An important assumption going into the theorem is that neither Alice nor Bob is allowed, in any way, to affect the preparation of the initial state. If Alice were allowed to take part in the preparation of the initial state, it would be trivially easy for her to encode a message into it; thus neither Alice nor Bob participates in the preparation of the initial state. The theorem does not require that the initial state be somehow 'random' or 'balanced' or 'uniform': indeed, a third party preparing the initial state could easily encode messages in it, received by Alice and Bob. Simply, the theorem states that, given some initial state, prepared in some way, there is no action that Alice can take that would be detectable by Bob. The proof proceeds by defining how the total Hilbert space H can be split into two parts, HA and HB, describing the subspaces accessible to Alice and Bob. The total state of the system is assumed to be described by a density matrix œÉ. This appears to be a reasonable assumption, as a density matrix is sufficient to describe both pure and mixed states in quantum mechanics. Another important part of the theorem is that measurement is performed by applying a generalized projection operator P to the state œÉ. This again is reasonable, as projection operators give the appropriate mathematical description of quantum measurements. After a measurement by Alice, the state of the total system is said to have collapsed to a state P(œÉ). The goal of the theorem is to prove that Bob cannot in any way distinguish the pre-measurement state œÉ from the post-measurement state P(œÉ). This is accomplished mathematically by comparing the trace of œÉ and the trace of P(œÉ), with the trace being taken over the subspace HA. Since the trace is only over a subspace, it is technically called a partial trace. Key to this step is the assumption that the (partial) trace adequately summarizes the system from Bob's point of view. That is, everything that Bob has access to, or could ever have access to, measure, or detect, is completely described by a partial trace over HA of the system œÉ. Again, this is a reasonable assumption, as it is a part of standard quantum mechanics. The fact that this trace never changes as Alice performs her measurements is the conclusion of the proof of the no-communication theorem.  Formulation  The proof of the theorem is commonly illustrated for the setup of Bell tests in which two observers Alice and Bob perform local observations on a common bipartite system, and uses the statistical machinery of quantum mechanics, namely density states and quantum operations. Alice and Bob perform measurements on system S whose underlying Hilbert space is : H = H_A \\\\otimes H_B. It is also assumed that everything is finite-dimensional to avoid convergence issues. The state of the composite system is given by a density operator on H. Any density operator œÉ on H is a sum of the form: : \\\\sigma = \\\\sum_i T_i \\\\otimes S_i where Ti and Si are operators on HA and HB respectively. For the following, it is not required to assume that Ti and Si are state projection operators: i.e. they need not necessarily be non-negative, nor have a trace of one. That is, œÉ can have a definition somewhat broader than that of a density matrix; the theorem still holds. Note that the theorem holds trivially for separable states. If the shared state œÉ is separable, it is clear that any local operation by Alice will leave Bob's system intact. Thus the point of the theorem is no communication can be achieved via a shared entangled state. Alice performs a local measurement on her subsystem. In general, this is described by a quantum operation, on the system state, of the following kind : P(\\\\sigma) = \\\\sum_k (V_k \\\\otimes I_{H_B})^* \\\\ \\\\sigma \\\\ (V_k \\\\otimes I_{H_B}), where Vk are called Kraus matrices which satisfy : \\\\sum_k V_k V_k^* = I_{H_A}. The term :I_{H_B} from the expression :(V_k \\\\otimes I_{H_B}) means that Alice's measurement apparatus does not interact with Bob's subsystem. Supposing the combined system is prepared in state œÉ and assuming, for purposes of argument, a non-relativistic situation, immediately (with no time delay) after Alice performs her measurement, the relative state of Bob's system is given by the partial trace of the overall state with respect to Alice's system. In symbols, the relative state of Bob's system after Alice's operation is :\\\\operatorname{tr}_{H_A}(P(\\\\sigma)) where \\\\operatorname{tr}_{H_A} is the partial trace mapping with respect to Alice's system. One can directly calculate this state: : \\\\operatorname{tr}_{H_A}(P(\\\\sigma)) = \\\\operatorname{tr}_{H_A} \\\\left(\\\\sum_k (V_k \\\\otimes I_{H_B})^* \\\\sigma (V_k \\\\otimes I_{H_B} )\\\\right) :::: = \\\\operatorname{tr}_{H_A} \\\\left(\\\\sum_k \\\\sum_i V_k^* T_i V_k \\\\otimes S_i \\\\right) :::: = \\\\sum_i \\\\sum_k \\\\operatorname{tr}(V_k^* T_i V_k) S_i :::: = \\\\sum_i \\\\sum_k \\\\operatorname{tr}(T_i V_k V_k^*) S_i :::: = \\\\sum_i \\\\operatorname{tr}\\\\left(T_i \\\\sum_k V_k V_k^*\\\\right) S_i :::: = \\\\sum_i \\\\operatorname{tr}(T_i) S_i :::: = \\\\operatorname{tr}_{H_A}(\\\\sigma). From this it is argued that, statistically, Bob cannot tell the difference between what Alice did and a random measurement (or whether she did anything at all).  Some comments  *If the density operator P(\\\\sigma) is allowed to evolve under the influence of non-local interactions between A and B, then in general the calculation in the proof no longer holds, unless suitable commutation relations are assumed. *The no-communication theorem thus says shared entanglement alone cannot be used to transmit any information. Compare this with the no-teleportation theorem, which states a classical information channel cannot transmit quantum information. (By transmit, we mean transmission with full fidelity.) However, quantum teleportation schemes utilize both resources to achieve what is impossible for either alone. * The no-communication theorem implies the no-cloning theorem, which states that quantum states cannot be (perfectly) copied. That is, cloning is a sufficient condition for the communication of classical information to occur. To see this, suppose that quantum states could be cloned. Assume parts of a maximally entangled Bell state are distributed to Alice and Bob. Alice could send bits to Bob in the following way: If Alice wishes to transmit a \\"0\\", she measures the spin of her electron in the z direction, collapsing Bob's state to either z+\\\\rangle_B or z-\\\\rangle_B. To transmit \\"1\\", Alice does nothing to her qubit. Bob creates many copies of his electron's state, and measures the spin of each copy in the z direction. Bob will know that Alice has transmitted a \\"0\\" if all his measurements will produce the same result; otherwise, his measurements will have outcomes z+\\\\rangle_B or z-\\\\rangle_B with equal probability. This would allow Alice and Bob to communicate classical bits between each other (possibly across space-like separations, violating causality). * The version of the no-communication theorem discussed in this article assumes that the quantum system shared by Alice and Bob is a composite system, i.e. that its underlying Hilbert space is a tensor product whose first factor describes the part of the system that Alice can interact with and whose second factor describes the part of the system that Bob can interact with. In quantum field theory, this assumption can be replaced by the assumption that Alice and Bob are spacelike separated. This alternate version of the no- communication theorem shows that faster-than-light communication cannot be achieved using processes which obey the rules of quantum field theory. * The proof of the no-communication theorem assumes that all measurable properties of Bob's system can be calculated from its reduced density matrix, which is true given the Born rule for calculating the probability of making various measurements. But this equivalence with the Born rule can also essentially be derived in the opposite direction, in that it's possible to show that the Born rule follows from the assumption that space-like separated events cannot violate causality by affecting each other.Zurek, Wojciech Hubert. \\"Environment - Assisted Invariance, Causality, and Probabilities in Quantum Physics.\\" https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0211037  See also * No-broadcast theorem * No-cloning theorem * No-deleting theorem * No-teleportation theorem  References   Category:Quantum measurement Category:Quantum information science Category:Physics theorems Category:Statistical mechanics theorems ","title":"No-communication theorem"},{"id":"1488322","text":"Jer√≥nimo Julio Arango Arias (1927 ‚Äî 4 April 2020) was a Mexican billionaire businessman, co-founder of the Aurrer√° supermarket chain, with his younger brothers, Manuel and Pl√°cido, known for a long time as three of Mexico's wealthiest men.

City The city of Tocaima was founded on March 20, 1544 by the Spanish explorer Hern√°n Venegas Carrillo. This small city is most well known for being a warm vacation site during religious holidays, especially for college students from Bogot√° and other surrounding areas. The town is crossed by the Pati River, which sometimes floods the town. History Before Spanish colonization, the area was home to the Guacana, an Amerindian tribe belonging to the Panche Amerindian Nation. Tocaima was named in honor of a legendary warrior from this tribe, during the ruling period of the Cacica Guacana. It is believed that Tocaima is the only city in the Cundinamarca Department that presently has a royal title and coat of arms issued by the Spanish Monarchy. Charles V issued the royal title and coat of arms on February 7, 1549, in appreciation of the city's loyalty and fame for being a powerful and wealthy region. In 1581, the city was completely destroyed by an exceptionally devastating flood of the Pati River. President Juan de Borja sent Captain Martin de Ocampo to refound the city, which he did on March 18, 1621 by constructing the Convent of San Jacinto and its contiguous chapel. During the decolonization of Colombia from Spain in 1810, Tocaima was represented in the electoral and constitutional college by jurist Miguel de Tobar y Zerrato and Don Juan Salvador Rodriguez de Lago. The Cabildo, or colonial administrative council, was re-established that same year. The new Constitution of Cundinamarca, created in 1815, divided the nation into cantons, which provoked a confrontation between the Tocaima Canton and the neighboring Canton of La Mesa. In 1816, Spain re-conquered the colonies and subsequently repressed the newly created government. After finally defeating the Spanish in 1819, the colonists declared total independence from Spain and created the Republic of Gran Colombia, which‚Äîled by General Santander in 1822‚Äîre-established the Tocaima Canton. In 1906, Tocaima was notable for its gold and copper mines, but neither mineral was mined there by 1920.

The water may enter via the perimeter drains of a basement waterproofing system, funneling into the basin or because of rain or natural ground water, if the basement is below the water table level. Sump pumps are used where basement flooding happens regularly and to solve dampness where the water table is above the foundation of a home. Sump pumps send water away from a house to any place where it is no longer problematic, such as a municipal storm drain or a dry well. Pumps may discharge to the sanitary sewer in older installations. Once considered acceptable, this practice may now violate the plumbing code or municipal bylaws, because it can overwhelm the municipal sewage treatment system. Municipalities urge homeowners to disconnect and reroute sump pump discharge away from sanitary sewers. Fines may be imposed for noncompliance. Many homeowners have inherited their sump pump configurations and do not realize that the pump discharges into the sewer. Usually hardwired into a home's electrical system, sump pumps may have a battery backup. The home's pressurized water supply powers some pumps, eliminating the need for electricity at the expense of using potable water, potentially making them more expensive to operate than electrical pumps and creating an additional water disposal problem. Since a sump basin may overflow if not constantly pumped, a backup system is important for cases when the main power is out for prolonged periods of time, as during a severe storm. There are generally two types of sump pumps‚Äîpedestal and submersible. In the case of the pedestal pump, the motor is mounted above the sump‚Äîwhere it is more easily serviced, but is also more conspicuous. The pump impeller is driven by a long, vertical extension shaft and the impeller is in a scroll housing in the base of the pump. The submersible pump, on the other hand, is entirely mounted inside the sump, and is specially sealed to prevent electrical short circuits. There is debate about which variety of sump pump is better. Pedestal sump pumps usually last longer (25 to 30 years) if they are installed properly and kept free of debris. They are less expensive and easier to remove. Submersible pumps will only last 5 to 15 years. They are more expensive to purchase but can take up debris without clogging. Sump pump systems are also utilized in industrial and commercial applications to control water table-related problems in surface soil. An artesian aquifer or periodic high water table situation can cause the ground to become unstable due to water saturation. As long as the pump functions, the surface soil will remain stable. These sumps are typically ten feet in depth or more; lined with corrugated metal pipe that contains perforations or drain holes throughout. They may include electronic control systems with visual and audible alarms and are usually covered to prevent debris and animals from falling in. Components Modern sump pump components in the United States are standardized. They consist of: * A plastic, metal, or concrete container forming a sump basin, approximately 2 feet (0.6 m) across and 2 to 3 feet (0.6 to 1 m) deep, 15 to 25 U.S. gallons (60 to 100 litre) capacity; * A sump pump, either 1/3 or 1/2 horsepower (200 or 400 W), either battery or mains powered (or both). Pump selection Selection of a sump pump may consider: * Automatic vs. manual operation ‚Äì pump may be controlled automatically by a level switch. * Power ‚Äì Sump pump motive power will vary from 1/4 horsepower to multiple horsepower. * Head pressure ‚Äì The hydraulic head pressure of a sump pump describes the maximum height that the pump will move water. For instance, a sump pump with a 15 feet (4.6 m) maximum head (also called a shutoff head) will raise water up 15 feet (4.6 m) before it completely loses flow. * Power cord length ‚Äì Running a more powerful electrical motor a long distance from the main service panel will require heavier gauge wiring to assure sufficient voltage at the motor for proper pump performance. * Phase and voltage ‚Äì Sump pumps powered from the AC mains are available with single-phase or three-phase induction motors, rated for 110‚Äì120, 220‚Äì240, or 460 volts. Three-phase power is typically not available in residential locations. * Water level sensing switch type ‚Äì Pressure switches are fully enclosed, usually inside the pump body, making them immune to obstructions or floating debris in the sump basin. Float switches, particularly the types attached to the end of a short length of flexible electrical cable, can get tangled or obstructed, especially if the pump is prone to movement in the basin due to torque effects when starting and stopping. Pressure switches are typically factory set and not adjustable, while float switches can be adjusted in place to set the high and low water levels in the sump basin. There is a solid state switch utilizing field-effect technology, which will turn on and off the pump through use of an internal switch and a piggyback plug. * Backup system and alarm for critical applications. Backup components A secondary, typically battery-powered sump pump can operate if the first pump fails. A battery-powered secondary pump will have a separate battery and charger system to provide power if normal supply is interrupted. Alternative sump pump systems can be driven by municipal water pressure. Water-powered ejector pumps have a separate pump, float and check valve. The float controlling a backup pump is mounted in the sump pit above the normal high water mark. Under normal conditions, the main electric powered sump pump will handle all the pumping duties. When water rises higher than normal for any reason, the backup float in the sump is lifted and activates the backup sump pump. An ejector pump can also be connected to a garden hose to supply high-pressure water, with another hose to carry the water away. Although such ejector pumps waste water and are relatively inefficient, they have the advantage of having no moving parts and offer the utmost in reliability. If the backup sump system is rarely used, a component failure may not be noticed, and the system may fail when needed. Some battery control units test the system periodically and alert on failed electrical components. A simple, battery-powered water alarm can be hung a short distance below the top of the sump to sound an alarm should the water level rise too high. Maintenance Illustration of a typical pedestal-type sump pump. Sump basins and sump pumps must be maintained. Typical recommendations suggest examining equipment every year. Pumps running frequently due to higher water table, water drainage, or weather conditions should be examined more frequently. Sump pumps, being mechanical devices, will fail eventually, which could lead to a flooded basement and costly repairs. Redundancy in the system (multiple/secondary pumps) can help to avoid problems when maintenance and repairs are needed on the primary system. When examining a sump pump and cleaning it, dirt, gravel, sand, and other debris should be removed to increase efficiency and extend the life of the pump. These obstructions can also decrease the pump's ability to drain the sump, and can allow the sump to overflow. The check valve can also jam from the debris. Examine the discharge line opening, when applicable, to ensure there are no obstructions in the line. Even a partially obstructed discharge line can force a sump pump to work harder and increase its chance of overheating and failure.Author unknown (Date unknown). Basement Troubleshooting Guide: Failing Sump Pumps. Sunday, 21 July 2019 Float switches are used to automatically turn the sump pump on when water rises to a preset level. Float switches must be clear of any obstructions within the sump. A float guard can be used to prevent the float switch from accidentally resting on the pump housing, and remaining on. As mechanical float switches can wear out, they should be periodically tested by actuating them manually to assure that they continue to move freely and that the switch contacts are opening and closing properly. If left in standing water, pedestal pumps should be manually run from time to time, even if the water in the sump isn't high enough to trip the float switch. This is because these pumps are incapable of removing all the water in a sump and the lower bearing or bushing for the pump impeller shaft tends to remain submerged, making it prone to corrosion and eventually freezing the drive shaft in the bearing. In the alternative, a pedestal pump that is expected to remain idle for an extended time should be removed from the sump and stored out of water, or the sump should be mopped out to bring the level of the remaining water well below the lower shaft bearing.

Background General Winfield Scott had a series of garrisons posted along the route from Veracruz to Mexico City to protect his supply lines. One of these garrisons was posted at the city of Puebla, roughly two-thirds of the way to Mexico City from the coast. The garrison was commanded by Major Thomas Childs, serving as a brevet colonel.Bauer, K.J., 1974, The Mexican War, 1846-1848, New York: Macmillan, Childs had 500 soldiers to guard the city.

In 1983, HRFA hired John Cronin, the first full-time Hudson Riverkeeper, to patrol the river, protect it from polluters, and enforce environmental laws. In 1986, the group officially changed its name to Riverkeeper, making it the first \\"keeper\\" group to be founded. Their movement motivated the formation of \\"keeper\\" groups across the world, protecting rivers, bays, lakes, and coastal waterways. In 1999, the Waterkeeper Alliance, was created as an umbrella organization to unite and support \\"keeper\\" organizations. Two decades later, in December 2019, the network had grown to 350 members in 46 countries, with half the membership outside the U.S.; the alliance had added 200 groups in the last five years. Riverkeeper's mission is \\"to protect the environmental, recreational and commercial integrity of the Hudson River and its tributaries, and safeguard the drinking water of nine million New York City and Hudson Valley residents\\". It uses litigation, science, patrolling, citizen engagement, and legislation to accomplish its goals. Paul Gallay serves as the Riverkeeper and president of the organization.  Preface  Abandoned Industrial Facilities on the Hudson River The Hudson Valley has long been considered the birthplace of the modern American environmental movement. In the 1960s a small group of scientists, fishermen and concerned citizens led by Robert H. Boyle, author of The Hudson River, A Natural and Unnatural History and a senior writer at Sports Illustrated, were determined to reverse the decline of the then-polluted Hudson River by confronting the polluters through advocacy and citizen law enforcement. Riverkeeper grew out of \\"a blue-collar coalition of commercial and recreational fishermen\\" who organized to reclaim the Hudson River from polluters. While Riverkeeper aids national and international networks guard local waterways, their grassroots actions are unique. Where many local efforts use protests and high-risk defiance of authority, Riverkeeper seeks citizen empowerment in environmental law. After filing claims with government agencies such as the Army Corps of Engineers, this mobilized body politic saw how business interests clouded government actions. They believe ordinary people should be able to defend public resources from abuse and it was by such actions to protect communal watershed quality that legal standing was given to United States' citizens in environmental disputes.Cronin and Kennedy, p.33.  Origins = Scenic Hudson  Prior to Riverkeeper's predecessor organization, the Hudson River Fishermen's Association (HRFA), a few activists strove to mobilize the Hudson Valley politic. Of note was Robert H. Boyle, a fisherman and a sportswriter for Sports Illustrated.Cronin and Kennedy, p.24. Boyle moved to the area in the 1960s and, upon fishing the Hudson and its tributaries, grew fond of the region. He became familiar with residents that he found knew most about the river, the fishermen. Soon after, he began to research the river and published articles rebuking wild land conservation as ignorant of community environmental issues. Boyle's support was crucial to the litigation between local environmentalists, organized under the Scenic Hudson Preservation Conference (Scenic Hudson), and Consolidated Edison (Con Ed), New York's chief electric utility in the case Scenic Hudson Preservation Conference v. Federal Power Commission. The case involved Con Ed's proposal to build a hydropower facility on Storm King Mountain in the Hudson Highlands.Cronin and Kennedy, p.27 Scenic Hudson, joined by the Nature Conservancy, filed a complaint against the plant, but the Federal Power Commission (FPC) approved it, ignoring likely ecological harm. Boyle studied this case and found that a New York Fish and Game Journal article identified this part of the Hudson as a key spawning ground for striped bass. He informed Scenic Hudson of this result.Cronin and Kennedy, p.29 The FPC rejected this data due to testimony of a former New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) biologist. Indian Point Energy Center Boyle met with the article's authors and found not only was this biologist aware of the study, he hired them to perform it.Cronin and Kennedy, pp.29-30 Boyle then tried to link other activities to striped bass populations, mainly Con Ed's Indian Point nuclear power plant. Local fishermen long asserted that thousands of fish were killed by the plant's intake pipes and Dominick Pirone of the Long Island League of Salt Water Sportsmen alleged he was shown photos of a dead fish pile twelve feet high.Cronin and Kennedy, p.30 Boyle later found that DEC gathered this proof and hid it, claiming the plant killed no fish. Infuriated, he tried to tie fish kills to the future Storm King plant. With testimony from a fisheries biologist of the United States Marine Gamefish Laboratory, Boyle undermined the DEC's faulty data, proving the site as critical bass spawning habitat.Cronin and Kennedy, pp.30-31 In spite of this victory, local citizens continued to battle the FPC. Yet by 1965, due in part to Boyle's articles relating the case to local fishery impacts and by unearthing the fish kill photos the DEC had stifled, the Hudson Valley politic was aroused. Scenic Hudson also began receiving donations from thousands of people from forty- eight states.  Storm King Doctrine  In December 1965, the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals reversed FPC's dismissal of the petitions against the plant, \\"holding that injury to aesthetic or recreational values was sufficient to provide an aggrieved party with constitutional \\"standing\\"\\".Cronin and Kennedy, pp.32-33 This result, known as the Storm King Doctrine, was the first time environmentalists were given standing to object to scenic or recreational injury without showing tangible economic harm.Cronin and Kennedy, pp.33, 37 Though this fight lasted for fifteen more years, community concerns for environmental quality now held weight in future litigation. Thus, despite Con Ed and FPC efforts to evade additional hearings and their later release of faulty impact assessments, a new group, the HRFA, swayed the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) to consider fish kills in relicensing Con Ed's current plant at Indian Point.Cronin and Kennedy, pp.34-35 The HRFA, founded by Boyle, united recreational and commercial fishermen who valued the Hudson River as public property and saw its safety as linked to the protection of democratic ideals. They cared for the valley because the river supported their livelihoods and offered them a sense of place. It was \\"our Monte Carlo, our Riviera\\" as one fisherman stated.Cronin and Kennedy, pp.39-40 The inclusion of fish kills at Indian Point caused the Second Circuit Court of Appeals to order the FPC to revive the fish mortality issue at Storm King. With the environmentalists' new constitutional standing, Con Ed envisioned costly litigation ahead. In 1980, Con Ed sought a settlement accord, resulting in the Hudson River Peace Treaty. This agreement cancelled the hydropower plant, mandated the land become a park and forced Con Ed to donate $12 million to endow a Hudson River Foundation to study the river. Con Ed was spared costs of constructing infrastructure at Indian Point to solve the fish intake problem, but had to research alternative solutions to reduce fish kills.Cronin and Kennedy, pp.36-37 The Storm King Doctrine set precedents for environmental law including citizens' claims to bring an environmental dispute before a court. This right was included in the National Environmental Policy Act and expanded citizen participation in the environmental movement. Successful closure of Indian Point plant is expected to generate a $15m fund for \\"community and environmental project\\", half of which Riverkeeper believes it should receive, subject to a dispute with local community who lost significant source of income with closure of the plant.  Citizen environmental enforcement  While empowerment swept across the region, forgotten legislation was about to reshape citizen efforts by placing them on the offensive. The Refuse Act of 1899 set up fines from $500 to $2,500 for pollutant discharges to the navigable waters of the United States. Moreover, half the fine was afforded to whoever aided in alerting the public of the violation and allowed citizens to enforce its provisions if government failed to do so. This Act caused a surge in public interest over water pollution in the early 1970s, stirring many citizens to enforce civil (and potentially criminal) violations of a federal statute, and placing pressure on the national government to create effective water protection policy. The HRFA was one of the first groups to rediscover this Act and successfully apply it. Once Boyle familiarized himself with the Refuse Act, he noted its value to the community at once. When the HRFA held their first public meeting, drawing a standing-room only gathering of Hudson Valley masons, commercial fishermen, carpenters and other local laborers at an American Legion Hall, Boyle found an audience to hear his new tactics for citizen empowerment.Cronin and Kennedy, pp.42-43 Of note was the presence of Congressman Richard Ottinger, who was so moved by the turnout of working-class environmentalists who sought redress for the social and environmental inequities in their towns that he cancelled his agenda to discuss these problems.Cronin and Kennedy, p.43 Ottinger was key to the political support structure of HRFA's initial growth. He and others at this meeting heard from fishermen plagued by buyer disdain for Hudson River fish, as well as local factory and construction workers who reported personal observations of pollutant discharges by their employers.Cronin and Kennedy, p.44 Their first target was Penn Central Railroad, which for years released petroleum products into the Croton River, a tributary of the Hudson. HRFA notified the Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Attorney by written letters and phone calls to enforce the Refuse Act, but were ignored. In 1968, HRFA and Congressman Ottinger sued Penn Central, the Army Corps of Engineers and the Secretary of the Army. This caught the U.S. Attorney's interest, causing them to join the suit against Penn Central. The railroad lost the suit and provided the first bounty afforded to a private organization from a polluter since the Act's enactment. HRFA, now emboldened, distributed thousands of copies of the Refuse Act on \\"Bag a Polluter\\" postcards for citizens to fill in polluters' names and to send back to the HRFA. This effectively found many violators liable for their actions.Cronin and Kennedy, p.45 The HRFA was growing and many members now spread its message to communities and public officials. Richie Garrett, HRFA's president, was a local grave-digger from Ossining, NY who had grown up along the Croton River, fishing and living by means of this waterbody. By his involvement in the HRFA, he grew as an activist by writing letters and presenting slide shows of fish kills and pollution at venues from garden club meetings to Knights of Columbus halls. He became so well known that he testified in front of the U.S. House of Representative's Subcommittee on Fisheries, Wildlife and Conservation over Governor Rockefeller's idea for a Hudson River expressway, describing his efforts not as radical, but as American in disposition. Garrett urged his audiences to forgo trying to resolve all the issues facing Earth, but to find a part of the world meaningful to them, and protect it. He found such an advocate in Fred Danback in one of HRFA's largest cases yet.Cronin and Kennedy, p.46 Danback worked as a janitor for Anaconda Wire and Cable Company at Hastings-on-Hudson, NY. On his first day of employment, he discovered that the company released oils and solvents through floor drains that led directly into the river. Danback had grown up along the waterfront and had often heard complaints that Hudson shad tasted of oil. He now had proof of such pollution. After an unresponsive complaint to Anaconda, he contacted the United States Coast Guard to intervene. Yet, one afternoon he found company representatives dining with Coast Guard officials; appearing quite amicable. It was then Danback knew he could not rely on government and had to find other ways to address the issue.Cronin and Kennedy, pp.46-47 In 1969, Danback quit Anaconda and joined the HRFA. He brought evidence and analysis before the U.S. Attorney's office and badgered the agency until 1971, when they charged Anaconda with one hundred counts of violating the Refuse Act.Cronin and Kennedy, p.47  Growth of the organization  These victories raised citizen empowerment and provided new funding to expand HRFA influence along the Hudson. Robert Boyle had called for a \\"Riverkeeper\\" in a book, arguing for someone \\"on the river the length of the year, nailing polluters on the spot...giving a sense of time, place and purpose to people who live in or visit the valley\\".Cronin and Kennedy, p.69 Thus, he was inspired in meeting John Cronin, an area local who had worked aboard the Clearwater, a replica of the Hudson River sloop that fostered education and the restoration of the Hudson.Cronin and Kennedy, p.54 Cronin worked in the Clearwater Pipewatch project, inspecting companies for Clean Water Act (CWA) violations. His first assignment entailed an adhesive tape manufacturing company. As a result, the company was convicted of twelve violations of the 1972 CWA. Initially uninspired by citizen participation in environmental fields, Cronin was transformed by this outcome. \\"I wasn't a scientist. I wasn't a lawyer. As just an average, everyday citizen, I was able to get a polluter charged\\". After his legal forays, Cronin became a lobbyist at the Center for the Hudson River Valley and then worked as a political aide; educating himself on government structure. Still, he did not forget the Hudson and after a couple years returned to the river to become a commercial fisherman.Cronin and Kennedy, pp.63-64 Cronin boated much of the Hudson and fostered an admiration for the river from his experiences with local fishermen. After facing multiple struggles as a fisherman, he found love in the river's beauty and bounty, but also hardship in its daily trials. His passion developed beyond simple environmentalism to encompass a deeper respect for a mutual coexistence between himself and the river.Cronin and Kennedy, p.66 Boyle found his Riverkeeper in John Cronin and Cronin found his calling in this new organization. Only after Cronin's first acts as Riverkeeper did it grow in popularity. Upon taking on his role as Riverkeeper in 1983, Cronin was tipped off by a state trooper that oil tankers were rinsing contents into the Hudson. He quickly engaged the issue and often anchored near the advised area to listen to the captains' discussions over the radio at night. When he learned ships were flushing out jet fuel residue and filling up with river water to take to an Exxon refinery, Cronin started collecting water samples. Over two years, he recorded one hundred seventy-seven Exxon tankers discharge into the river and take up clean water. Cronin's proof was so thorough that Exxon settled, paying $1.5 million to New York State for a private river management fund and $500,000 to HRFA; half of which went to Riverkeeper and the other half towards environmental projects on the Hudson.Cronin and Kennedy, p.76 This case afforded Riverkeeper local and national regard. In 1986, HRFA joined Riverkeeper as one group to protect the river, to retract it from corporate abuse and to return it to public use.Cronin and Kennedy, pp.48-49, 76 Cronin saw Riverkeeper's new mission as not just to hunt polluters, but to prove itself to the community and empower those who felt the social disruption of the ecological misuse of the Hudson.Cronin and Kennedy, p.77 In essence, Riverkeeper is an environmental \\"neighborhood watch\\" group maintained by concerned citizens.Cronin and Kennedy, p.135 Its constituents are not public officials and are not swayed by politics, but include members who defend the public use and restrict the private alienation of the river's benefits.Cronin and Kennedy, pp.135-136 Thus, Riverkeeper has engaged environmental justice issues, such as community park access. For example, around 1990, the City of New York Parks Commissioner restricted greenspace access by banning bus and subway transit, frequented modes of transport for African Americans, from reaching certain parks.Cronin and Kennedy, p.165 Riverkeeper sued Westchester County and forced it to reopen six county parks that were closed to meet the budget, but due to their proximity to a railway, were mainly used by minority communities. The County had not closed any golf courses used by affluent residents, even though they were greater strains on County funds than parks that offered some minorities their only access to the river. This was not the only occasion where land use policies threatened the health of the Hudson River watershed as a public resource. In 1990, a team of Riverkeeper attorneys took on developers and lackluster enforcement agencies to protect the reservoirs and streams that constitute the water supply for nine million New York City and Westchester County residents. Riverkeeper also united with a chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored Peoples (NAACP), in Ossining. During the 1960s, this oldest stable African American residential community in the Hudson Valley was rezoned industrial and has suffered social decline ever since. In 1991, Riverkeeper and the Ossining NAACP effectively sued the Ossining Planning Board to repeal an expansion of a construction debris processing plant that would have worsened diesel fumes and house vibrations at adjacent households.Cronin and Kennedy, pp.165-166 The Riverkeeper movement has redefined grassroots forces by democratizing resources for communities and has afforded a constant medium of participation for neighborhoods whose episodic battles can exhaust their passion. Local waterways are protected by citizen-led efforts to confront pollution in the courts, the media, and the political system with the aid of a network of local knowledge to prevent the failure of democratic processes by politically endowed industries.Cronin and Kennedy, pp.169-170 This movement restored communal ownership and control to the lives of its participants, many of which were transformed by efforts to embrace democratic rights to clean water and the redress of regulatory failures. Diana Leicht, a quiet mother from Newburgh, N.Y. turned irate when her municipal water supply became so polluted that it sickened her child.Cronin and Kennedy, p.173 She contacted Riverkeeper, which informed her of her legal rights to clean water. They discovered her timidity had grown from a desire to be a good citizen and not for fear of conflict. With the aid of Riverkeeper, she organized sixty mothers to learn their rights under legislation such as the CWA and the Safe Drinking Water Act. They gained media interest, contacted state agencies directly and at hearings, sued the town of Newburgh, won their claims and forced the payment of damages. By empowering citizens to embrace their democratic rights, Riverkeeper helped stir the passion of two hundred residents to confront the town board at a local meeting resulting in the board's public statement to become more alert to local needs.  Importance  The American environmental movement spans several centuries and has been affected by past beliefs and modern ideologies.Gottlieb, pp.20-24 While first focused on wild lands outside of civilization, this movement now includes urban centers, production activities, and human health.Gottlieb, pp.35-36 Still, further cooperation is needed to unite mainstream and community-based concerns. Mainstream groups have been critiqued as elitist and overly Caucasian, and tend to focus on the current system of governance instead of alternative means to embrace issues of race, gender, class and social health.Gottlieb, p.269 These organizations have become fixated on policy-making processes, forcing them to allow concessions on issues vital to alternative groups to create a cordial dialogue with industry and government.Gottlieb, pp.182-183 Grassroots activism has begun to fill the void left by the institutionalization of the environmental movement. These groups foster mediums for environmental change, rely on voluntary action and stress citizen empowerment as well as pollution prevention instead of only technical controls.Gottlieb, p.227 Their origins are distinct from mainstream groups and often appear to be descendent from earlier urban and industrial movements linked to the mobilization of concerned citizens, the growth of networks and a meaningful sense of place. The public trust doctrine separates private ownership from resources held in common by the public. This legal right, recognized in New York's Constitution, holds that the people own the Hudson River and all citizens have a right to its use, but none can abuse this privilege to degrade its use by others.Kennedy, p.306 This democratic value was offset during the Industrial Revolution when courts and legislatures overlooked the public trust and gave more power to industry.Kennedy, p.307 A similar erosion of another common law, nuisance law, occurred in the same era. Nuisance law bars private land uses that injure the community or disrupt the rights of others to enjoy their property. In response, millions of Americans demanded greater protection for environmental and community health. As such, these rights were rewritten with greater emphasis in our federal statutory system. They declare no one has the right to pollute public resources and everyone has the right to a clean environment. Only by democratic representation has industry been given permits to pollute so long as the activity benefits society and causes no harm. This created the field of risk assessment and questions what society risks in allocating our common rights to industry.Kennedy, pp.307-308 The origins and propagation of the Riverkeeper movement involve citizen ownership and empowerment. Democracies can be assessed by how fairly they distribute natural wealth and whether the bodies politic have equal access to it.Kennedy, p.309 When government fails to secure these goals, our legal structure offers ways to reassert our claims as citizens. Right-to-know laws such as the Freedom of Information Act afford citizens the power to demand knowledge of government and corporate activity in their communities. If these acts violate environmental laws, they can prosecute polluters in the place of the U.S. Attorney General under citizen- suit provisions that are part of every major federal environmental statute. These laws give the public democratic rights to regain ownership over their neighborhoods. Riverkeeper's success stirred other citizens to defend their own waterways. Such groups work across the nation and emulate Riverkeeper's tactics of empowerment by the enforcement of democratic rights and ecological quality.Cronin and Kennedy, pp.131-132 Riverkeeper was joined by Pace University Law School in its struggles, providing it and the Hudson Valley legal resources to combat corporate power. Many law schools have forged similar alliances; becoming arsenals for citizen enforcement suits for Keeper organizations. This has educated communities, giving them a means to exercise their rights, and has taught new generations of law students the value of community-based activism in environmental law.Cronin and Kennedy, p.132 Not long after these new groups began to take shape, Riverkeeper was offered funding to become a national organization with local chapters around the nation. Riverkeeper declined the offer since it believed in grassroots action as a means to empower the disenfranchised from the bottom-up, instead of by national forces. In 1992, the current set of Keeper programs created the National Alliance of River, Sound and Baykeepers, led by Riverkeeper. This organization became \\"a national community of Keepers\\" where members network, share resources, and license new groups as accredited Keeper programs. Controversy In 2000, eight of the 22 members of Riverkeeper's board resigned after Kennedy insisted on rehiring William Wegner, a scientist whom the organization's then-president, Boyle, had fired as soon as he had learned Wegner had been hired six months earlier. In 1995, Wegner had been convicted of smuggling rare bird eggs from Australia and had also pled guilty to tax evasion. Boyle and the board members who resigned believed it was not right for an environmental organization to hire someone convicted of environmental crimes, especially since critics would not hesitate to publicize that fact to gain a publicity advantage. Treasurer John Fry, who also resigned, felt it would hurt the organization's fundraising. Boyle was also further displeased that Kennedy had made an employment decision, since that was solely his responsibility within the organization. Kennedy, who had hired Wegner to work for him personally after Boyle had fired him, said Wegner had done \\"terrific work\\" for Riverkeeper and no one, even those who had resigned over the hiring, disputed that. \\"We all make mistakes in our lives,\\" he told The New York Times. \\"Where would any of us be if we didn't get a second chance?\\" As of 2017 Wegner remains employed by Riverkeeper.  Recent activities and cases  Today, these organizations have built a global network, the Waterkeeper Alliance, and include more than one hundred eighty Keepers, modeled after and supported by Riverkeeper. Despite the national and global transformation of the Keeper movement, Riverkeeper's mission remains local. Their efforts still focus on reducing fish kills and water pollution, maintaining the quality of New York City's drinking water, and increasing public access and appreciation for the Hudson River. At any given time, Riverkeeper is involved in many actions to protect the integrity of the river, its tributaries, the Croton watershed, or other waters that affect New York City's water supply. These actions take the form of litigation; investigations; environmental review of development projects; citizen empowerment projects; regulatory review and comment; and local, state, and federal policy issues. Riverkeeper maintains a 36-foot (11-m) wooden patrol and research vessel, the R. Ian Fletcher, operated by Boat Captain, John Lipscomb. Riverkeeper's full-time presence on the river enables it to respond to and investigate new reports of illegal discharges, facilitate scientific research on the Hudson, and provide access to the river to its members, public officials, students and the media. Keeper programs not only defend natural lands for their own sake, but preserve the quality of these environments for the cultural and social enrichment of those that call these locales home, and importantly, for those who will do so in the future.Cronin and Kennedy, p.275 Riverkeeper reveals the value of not only engaging in environmental conflicts over broad national or international issues, but also in those occurring in our own backyards. By reasserting public ownership of common resources and that any harm incurred to them is an act of thievery against every community member; Riverkeeper protects Hudson Valley communities, its environment and the democratic rights of its citizens.Cronin and Kennedy, p.277 Through outreach as well as active citizen enforcement of legal standards, Riverkeeper has empowered individuals to oppose corporate control. These citizens have retaken control of their lives by reestablishing the core principles of democratic environmental governance in their communities.Cronin and Kennedy, p.264 See also *List of environmental and conservation organizations in the United States  References = Notes  Bibliography  * Cronin, John Jr., and Robert F.

The company was founded by Wang Yung-ching and his brother Wang Yung-tsai and is chaired by Lee Chih-tsuen. Despite its name, its holdings include several companies prominent in the high tech electronics sector, including VIA Technologies and Nanya Technology Corporation. History Formosa Plastics Group was formed in 1958 to reflect vertical integration of the PVC manufacturing process by the Formosa Plastics Corporation (FPC). Nan Ya Plastics Processing Corp. was formed to purchase PVC resins produced by FPC. A third member of the group, New Eastern Plastics Product, was formed to manufacture those processed resins into consumer goods. Nan Ya and New Eastern were later merged into a single entity, Nan Ya Plastics Corp., and upstream integration was achieved in the 1990s through the construction of an ethylene-producing naphtha cracking plant and a coal- burning power plant. In Taiwan, FPG has also diversified into many other fields, including textiles, electronics, medicine, skin care, automobile manufacturing, gasoline retail and petroleum refining. FPG's overseas expansion has focused primarily on the United States and mainland China. The group has purchased or constructed many PVC factories and chemical production facilities in both countries. American holdings also include Texas properties containing over 200 oil wells and lands rich in natural gas, pipeline and production firms, and an ethylene plant in Point Comfort, Texas that was constructed in 1988. Chinese expansion has included a power plant in Zhuangzhou, Fujian Province and at least 40 FPG-built factories across the country. FPG's non-manufacturing operations include the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, named after the late father of the FPG chairman, Wang Chang-gung. Since its founding in 1976, the non-profit hospital has expanded to 5 cities in Taiwan. In 1984, the Linkou branch undertook the first liver transplant operation in Asia. In the early 2010s the group became the primary backer of the Formosa Ha Tinh Steel Corporation, a large iron and steel works in Vietnam. FPG was responsible for a serious discharge of toxic pollution from one of its steel complexes. The release resulted in an estimated 115 tons of dead fish washing ashore in Vietnam. The environmental pollution negatively affected the livelihood of 200,000 people including local fishers. In July 2016, FPG pledged to pay compensation to Vietnamese impacted by the environmentally toxic discharge in the amount of $500 million. In February 2018 Hoang Duc Binh was jailed for 14 years for live streaming fisherman travelling to file a lawsuit over the plant's pollution Formosa Plastics has planned the construction of a 9.4 billion dollar fossil fuel plant entitled \\"The Sunshine Project\\" in an area of Louisiana that has already been dubbed as \\"Cancer Alley\\" due to illnesses caused by pollutants in the environment leaked from existing fossil fuel plants. Naphtha Cracker #6 (ÂÖ≠Ëºï) Formosa Petrochemical Oil Tanker FPG's naphtha cracker - the sixth petrochemical processing plant of that kind in Taiwan - was first proposed in 1973, but the ruling KMT government still imposed a monopoly at that time and denied permission. Permission was granted in 1986, as President Chiang Ching-kuo instituted reforms to loosen the authoritarianism instituted by his father, Chiang Kai-shek. At that time, FPG proposed a NT$90 billion complex that would be located in the Litzu Industrial Zone of Ilan County. Local residents opposed this plan on the basis of its environmental impact and, led by County Magistrate Chen Ding-Nan (Èô≥ÂÆöÂçó), formed the Alliance against Sixth Naphtha Cracker. After a successful campaign, including a televised debate between Chen and FPG Chairman Wang, they eventually forced the company to look elsewhere. The second site proposed by FPG, in Taoyuan County's Kuanyin Industrial Zone, generated similar opposition from local residents. FPG shelved these proposals in 1989 and Chairman Wang Yung-ching traveled secretly to mainland China to find a solution there. In 1990, he announced his intention to develop the complex on the People's Republic of China-controlled island of Haitsang, in Fujian Province. The Nationalist government condemned the project and in 1992 secured an offshore site near Mailiao, in Taiwan's impoverished Yunlin County, where local administrators welcomed the investment. Total investment in the complex, after four \\"phases\\" of construction throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, came to NT$650 billion and included the following major features: *an oil refinery: 450,000 barrels (72,000 m¬≥) per day *a naphtha cracking plant (production capacity: 1.35 million tons ethylene per year) *a coal-burning power plant (capacity: 3 GW) *Taiwan's first wind power plant (total combined capacity of the four turbines: 2,640 kW). This project provoked intense opposition, just as Chiang Ching-kuo's reforms allowed tolerance for public expressions of dissatisfaction. The environmentalists' public protests, including a 3000-person rally at the Ministry of Economic Affairs in 1990, reflected the island's gradual transformation from authoritarianism to democracy. Beyond environmental concerns, protesters and newly legalized opposition parties denounced the cronyism they saw in the expedited approvals, extended tax holiday, subsidized loans, extremely low land prices for the land, and special allowance for a private port. During the construction of Naphtha Cracker #6, further trouble arose when 200 to 300 Thai and Filipino workers fought on 5 September 1999. The brawl was reported to have lasted eight hours. Despite these complications, the plant proceeded as scheduled and continues to enjoy government support. Subsidiaries Formosa Plastics Group plant at the Mailiao Industrial Complex, Yunlin County.

Sebold (Gottlieb Adolf Wilhelm Sebold Acccording to the birth certificate provided by the City Archives of M√ºlheim; March 10, 1899 in M√ºlheim, Germany ‚Äì February 16, 1970 in Napa, California) was a United States citizen who was coerced into becoming a spy when he visited Germany after being pressured by several high-ranking Nazi members. He informed the American Consul General in Cologne before leaving Germany and became a double agent for the FBI. With the assistance of another German agent, Fritz Duquesne, he recruited 33 agents that became known as the Duquesne Spy Ring. In June 1941, the Federal Bureau of Investigation arrested all of the agents. They were convicted and sentenced to a total of 300 years in prison.  Early life  Sebold served in the German army engineering corps during World War I. After emigrating to the United States in 1922, he married and worked in industrial and aircraft plants throughout the United States and South America. On February 10, 1936, he became a naturalized citizen of the United States. He returned to Germany in February 1939 to visit his mother in M√ºlheim. Upon his arrival in Hamburg, Germany, he was approached by a Gestapo agent who said that Sebold would be contacted in the near future due to the knowledge he obtained while working in United States aircraft factories. Sebold proceeded to M√ºlheim where he obtained employment.  Coerced into spying  Surveillance photographs of Sebold and Duquesne In September 1939, a Dr. Gassner visited Sebold in M√ºlheim and interrogated him regarding military planes and equipment in the United States. He also asked Sebold to return to the United States as an espionage agent for Germany. Gassner and another man, a \\"Dr. Renken\\", told him that they would expose information that he had omitted from his U. S. citizenship application about serving time in a German jail unless he agreed to assist them. Renken was in fact Major Nickolaus Ritter of the Abwehr. After the threats to his family, his life, and his citizenship, Sebold agreed to cooperate with the Nazis. He was then sent to a seven-week training program in Hamburg, Germany, where he learned to operate a clandestine shortwave radio, which he would set up when he returned to the United States. Ritter gave Sebold final instructions before he left for the United States, including shortwave radio codes and the use of microphotographs. Sebold was given the alias \\"Harry Sawyer\\", the code name TRAMP, and Abwehr number A.3549. Sebold was tasked to meet with various spies, pass along instructions to them from Germany, receive messages in return, and transmit them back in code to Germany. The intention was to pull off the efforts of spies who were passing technological secrets to the Germans during World War II.  Contacts U.S. embassy  Before leaving Germany, Sebold visited the U.S. Consulate in Cologne, Germany, and insisted on speaking with the Consul General. He told the Consul that he had been blackmailed into becoming a German spy but that he was a loyal American citizen and wanted to cooperate with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in the United States. The U.S. government agreed. Sebold sailed from Genoa, Italy, and arrived in New York City on February 8, 1940. There, Sebold (with secret help from the FBI) set himself up as a consulting diesel engineer, with an office in Times Square in Manhattan.  Duquesne Spy Ring  With the assistance of the FBI, \\"Harry Sawyer\\" was able to obtain an office in Times Square for a company under the name \\"Diesel Research Company\\". This office provided a seemingly safe space where Nazi spies felt comfortable meeting with and discussing their plans with Sebold. The office also allowed spies to send letters to manufacturers like Consolidated Aircraft Corporation, where they would then receive letters back such as \\"Development of Diesel Engines.\\" The spies came to the office to deliver blueprints, wartime information, and other sensitive information regarding the United States. However, the office was outfitted with hidden microphones and two-way mirrors, so FBI agents would be able to film the meetings for future use. Using the office, the FBI were able to obtain countless hours of incriminating footage. For example, the group's leader Fritz Joubert Duquesne was caught discussing how fires could be started at industrial plants to slow production, and showed photographs of blueprints for a new bomb being built in the United States. In different footage, a spy explains his plan to bomb a building, going as far as bringing dynamite and detonation caps to Sebold's office. Mugshots of Duquesne Spy Ring members. In his office and with cameras secretly rolling, Sebold met with a string of Nazis who wished to pass secret and sensitive national defense and wartime information to the Gestapo. Sebold was instructed by the Abwehr to contact Fritz Joubert Duquesne, code-named DUNN, a German spy in New York. Duquesne had been a spy for Germany since World War I; before that, he had been a Boer spy in the Second Boer War. In the United States, Duquesne had been a New York Herald journalist and was the \\"master coordinator\\" of the Nazi spies operating in the United States. He contacted aircraft and other technology companies and requested information that he claimed he would use for his lectures. Any plans or photos that he received were sent to the Wehrmacht. At their first meeting, Duquesne was extremely worried about the possibility of listening devices in Sebold's office. He gave Sebold a note suggesting that they should talk elsewhere. After relocating to an Automat, the two men exchanged information about members of the German espionage system with whom they had been in contact. In his office and with cameras secretly rolling, Sebold met with a string of Nazis who wished to pass secret and sensitive national defense and wartime information to the Gestapo. Duquesne provided Sebold with information for transmittal to Germany during subsequent meetings, and the meetings which occurred in Sebold‚Äôs office were filmed by FBI Agents. Duquesne, who was vehemently anti-British, submitted information dealing with national defense in America, the sailing of ships to British ports, and technology. He also regularly received money from Germany in payment for his services. On one occasion, Duquesne provided Sebold with photographs and specifications of a new type of bomb being produced in the United States. He claimed that he secured that material by secretly entering the DuPont plant in Wilmington, Delaware. Duquesne also explained how fires could be started in industrial plants. Much of the information Duquesne obtained was the result of his correspondence with industrial concerns. Representing himself as a student, he requested data concerning their products and manufacturing conditions. In May 1940, FBI agents on Long Island set up a shortwave radio station, and established contact with the Abwehr's radio station in Germany, posing as part of Sebold's spy ring. For 16 months this radio station was a main channel of communication between German spies in New York City and the Abwehr. During this time, the FBI's radio station transmitted over 300 messages containing falsified or useless information to Germany, and received 200 messages from Germany. Through Sebold, the U.S. identified dozens of German agents in the United States, Mexico and South America. In June 1941, the FBI arrested 33 German agents that were part of Sebold's network. Nineteen of the agents arrested pleaded guilty. The remainder were tried in Federal District Court, Brooklyn, New York, beginning 3 September 1941. The jury found all 14 guilty on 13 December 1941. The 33 members of the Duquesne Spy Ring were sentenced to serve a total of over 300 years in prison. Duquesne was sentenced to 18 years in prison. The Duquesne Spy Ring remains the largest espionage case in U.S. history that ended in convictions. As a result of the massive investigation, when America entered the war the FBI was confident that there was no major German espionage network hidden in U.S. society. When the trial ended, Sebold disappeared. He entered a government witness protection program and moved to California under another assumed identity. He had countless jobs, even trying to be a chicken farmer, but could never hold down a job and was constantly plagued by bad health. Additionally, letters from his family back in Germany explained that the Nazis still wanted to exact their revenge, leaving him in a constant state of fear. Sebold was diagnosed with manic depression and committed to Napa State Hospital in 1965. Five years later he suffered a heart attack and died.

Each tone has its own name not repeated in different octaves, unlike systems featuring octave equivalency. The lowest tone is named yakah and is determined by the lowest pitch in the range of the singer. The next higher octave is nawa and the second tuti.Touma, Habib Hassan (1996). The Music of the Arabs, p.17-18, trans. Laurie Schwartz. Portland, Oregon: Amadeus Press. . However, from these twenty-four tones, seven are selected to produce a scale and thus the interval of a quarter tone is never used and the three- quarter tone or neutral second should be considered the characteristic interval.Touma (1996), p.23. Quarter tone scale on C ascending and descending. By contrast, in the European equally tempered scale the octave is divided into twelve equal divisions, or exactly half as many as the Arab system. Thus the system is written in European musical notation using a slashed flat for quarter flat (some systems use a reversed flat sign instead), a flat for half- tone flat, a slashed flat and a flat for three-quarter tone flat, sharp with one vertical line for quarter sharp, sharp (‚ôØ) for half-step sharp, and a half sharp and a sharp for three-quarter sharp. A two octave range starting with yakah arbitrarily on the G below middle C is used.Touma (1996), p.24. In practice far fewer than twenty-four tones are used in a single performance. All twenty-four tones are individual pitches differentiated into a hierarchy of important pitches‚Äîpillars‚Äîwhich occur more frequently in the tone rows of traditional music and most often begin tone rows, and scattered less important or seldom occurring pitches (see tonality).Touma (1996), p.24-25 The specific notes used in a piece will be part of one of more than seventy modes or maqam rows named after characteristic tones that are rarely the first tone (unlike in European-influenced music theory where the tonic is listed first). The rows are heptatonic and constructed from augmented, major, neutral, and minor seconds. Many different but similar ratios are proposed for the frequency ratios of the tones of each row and performance practice, as of 1996, has not been investigated using electronic measurements.Touma (1996), p.18. The current tone system is derived from the work of Farabi (d. 950 CE) (heptatonic scales constructed from seconds), who used a 25-tone unequal scale (see tetrachord), and Mikha'il Mishaqah (1800‚Äì1888) who first presented the 24-tone equal-tempered division.Touma (1996), p.19.

He invented the first Soviet pulse jet engine and was responsible for the development of the world's first anti-ship cruise missiles and ICBM complexes like the UR-100, UR-200, UR-500 and UR-700. Early life Chelomey was born in Siedlce, Lublin Governorate, Russian Empire (now Poland). At the age of three months, his family fled to Poltava, when the Eastern Front of World War I came close to Siedlce. When Vladimir was twelve years old, the family moved again to Kiev. In 1932, Chelomey was admitted to the Kiev Polytechnic Institute (later the basis of Kiev Aviation Institute), where he showed himself as a student with outstanding talent. In 1936, his first book Vector Analysis was published. Studying at the institute, Chelomey also attended lectures on mathematical analysis, theory of differential equations, mathematical physics, theory of elasticity and mechanics in the Kiev University. He also attended lectures by Tullio Levi-Civita in the Ukrainian SSR Academy of Sciences. Namely in this time Chelomey became interested in mechanics and in the theory of oscillations and remained interested the rest of his life. In 1937, Chelomey graduated from the institute with honours. After that he worked there as a lecturer, defending a dissertation for the Candidate of Science (in 1939). World War II From the beginning of the Great Patriotic War in 1941, Chelomey worked at the Baranov Central Institute of Aviation Motor Building (TsIAM) in Moscow, where he created the first Soviet pulsating air jet engine in 1942, independently of similar contemporary developments in Nazi Germany. In the summer of 1944, it became known that Nazi Germany used V-1 cruise missiles against Southern England. On 9 October 1944, following a decision by the USSR State Defense Committee and People's Commissar for Aviation Industry Alexey Shakhurin, Chelomey was appointed the Director and Chief Designer of Plant N51 (its previous director Nikolay Polikarpov having died a short time before). Chelomey was to design, build, and test the first Soviet cruise missile at the earliest possible date. As early as December 1944, the missile, code-named 10Kh, was test fired from Petlyakov Pe-8 and Tupolev Tu-2 aircraft. OKB-52 and academic career Following his success with the 10Kh, the USSR Special Design Bureau on designing pilot-less aircraft (OKB-52) was established under Chelomey's leadership. In 1955, Chelomey was appointed the Chief Designer of the OKB-52, where he continued to work on cruise missiles. Chelomey continued his scientific research, earning a doctorate in science from Bauman Moscow Higher Technical School. After his dissertation defense in 1951, he became a professor at the School in 1952. In 1958, OKB-52 put forward a proposal for a multi-stage Intercontinental ballistic missile. Although their UR-200 rocket design was rejected in favour of Mikhail Yangel's R-36 (NATO designation SS-9 Scarp), their UR-100 design was accepted. Chelomey's OKB was part of the General Machine-Building Ministry headed by Sergey Afanasyev. Spacecraft In 1959, Chelomey was appointed the Chief Designer of Aviation Equipment. OKB-52, along with designing ICBMs, started to work on spacecraft, and in 1961 began work on a design for a much more powerful ICBM, the UR-500, although it was rather quickly rejected as impractical to use as a missile. In 1962, Chelomey became an Academician of the USSR Academy of Sciences, Mechanics Department. Chelomey became Sergey Korolev's internal competitor in the \\"Moon race\\". Chelomey proposed that the powerful UR-500 be used to launch a small two-man craft on a lunar flyby, and managed to gain support for his proposal by employing members of Nikita Khrushchev's family. He also claimed the UR-500 could be used to launch a military space station. Korolev aggressively opposed the UR-500 due to its use of extremely toxic nitrogen tetroxide and UDMH propellants. Following Khrushchev's removal, Chelomey's and Korolev's projects were combined, and the Soviet Lunar program continued. The first launch of the UR-500 (also known as Proton) took place in early 1965. Although it was never used to send cosmonauts to the Moon as Chelomey had hoped, Proton became the staple heavy lift launch vehicle of the Soviet/Russian fleet and would be used over the years for planetary probes, space stations, geosynchronous satellites, and more. The Earth satellites such as Polyot were also designed by Chelomey's OKB. Unlike earlier such craft, even Chelomey's first satellites Polyot-1 (1963) and Polyot-2 (1964) were able to change their orbits themselves. He also headed the development of the Proton satellite. In the 1970s Chelomey's OKB proposed non-realised Proton-based 20-ton LKS (Kosmolyot) spaceplane and worked on the Almaz military orbital stations (flown as Salyut 2, Salyut 3 and Salyut 5) which also became the basis for the Salyut, Mir and Zvezda civil space stations. To support his Almaz stations, Chelomey designed the TKS, as a large alternative to Soyuz. The TKS never flew manned as planned but derivatives flew as modules on Salyut 7 and Mir. In the 1980s Chelomey's OKB proposed non-realised 15-ton Uragan spaceplane based on Zenit-2 launcher. Anti-ship missiles He is reported to have led the construction of the P-80 Zubr anti-ship missile, and it may be presumed that he was involved in the related P-100 Oniks missile.

Miners striked for higher wages, shorter workdays, and the recognition of their union. The strike threatened to shut down the winter fuel supply to major American cities. At that time, residences were typically heated with anthracite or \\"hard\\" coal, which produces higher heat value and less smoke than \\"soft\\" or bituminous coal. The strike never resumed, as the miners received a 10% wage increase and reduced workdays from ten to nine hours; the owners got a higher price for coal and did not recognize the trade union as a bargaining agent. It was the first labor dispute in which the U.S. federal government intervened as a neutral arbitrator. The 1899 and 1900 strikes The United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) had won a sweeping victory in the 1897 strike by the soft-coal (bituminous coal) miners in the Midwest, winning significant wage increases. It grew from 10,000 to 115,000 members. A number of small strikes took place in the anthracite district from 1899 to 1901, by which the labor union gained experience and unionized more workers. The 1899 strike in Nanticoke, Pennsylvania, demonstrated that the unions could win a strike directed against a subsidiary of one of the large railroads.Blatz 1991 upright It hoped to make similar gains in 1900, but found the operators, who had established an oligopoly through concentration of ownership after drastic fluctuations in the market for anthracite, to be far more determined opponents than it had anticipated. The owners refused to meet or to arbitrate with the union; the union struck on September 17, 1900, with results that surprised even the union, as miners of all different nationalities and ethnicities walked out in support of the union. Republican Party Senator Mark Hanna from Ohio, himself an owner of bituminous coal mines (not involved in the strike), sought to resolve the strike as it occurred less than two months before the presidential election. He worked through the National Civic Federation which brought labor and capital representatives together. Relying on J. P. Morgan to convey his message to the industry that a strike would hurt the reelection of Republican William McKinley, Hanna convinced the owners to concede a wage increase and grievance procedure to the strikers. The industry refused, on the other hand, to formally recognize the UMWA as the representative of the workers. The union declared victory and dropped its demand for union recognition.Robert J. Cornell, The Anthracite Coal Strike of 1902 (1957) p 45 The anthracite coal strike John Mitchell, President of the UMWA, takes the bull (coal trusts) by the horns. The issues that led to the strike of 1900 were just as pressing in 1902: the union wanted recognition and a degree of control over the industry. The industry, still smarting from its concessions in 1900, opposed any federal role. The 150,000 miners wanted their weekly pay envelope. Tens of millions of city dwellers needed coal to heat their homes. John Mitchell, President of the UMWA, proposed mediation through the National Civic Federation, then a body of relatively progressive employers committed to collective bargaining as a means of resolving labor disputes. In the alternative, Mitchell proposed that a committee of eminent clergymen report on conditions in the coalfields. George Baer, President of the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad, one of the leading employers in the industry, brushed aside both proposals dismissively: > Anthracite mining is a business, and not a religious, sentimental, or > academic proposition.... I could not if I would delegate this business > management to even so highly a respectable body as the Civic Federation, nor > can I call to my aid . . . the eminent prelates you have named.Edmund > Morris, Theodore Rex (2001) p. 133 On May 12, 1902, the anthracite miners voting in Scranton, Pennsylvania, went out on strike. The maintenance employees, who had much steadier jobs and did not face the special dangers of underground work, walked out on June 2. The union had the support of roughly eighty percent of the workers in this area, or more than 100,000 strikers. Some 30,000 left the region, many headed for Midwestern bituminous mines; 10,000 men returned to Europe. The strike soon produced threats of violence between the strikers on one side and strikebreakers, the Pennsylvania National Guard, local police, and hired detective agencies on the other.Edmund Morris, Theodore Rex 2001 p. 134 Federal intervention On June 8, President Theodore Roosevelt asked his Commissioner of Labor, Carroll D. Wright, to investigate the strike. Wright investigated and proposed reforms that acknowledged each side's position, recommending a nine-hour day on an experimental basis and limited collective bargaining. Roosevelt chose not to release the report, for fear of appearing to side with the union. Charles Ledererupright The owners, for their part, refused to negotiate with the union. As George Baer wrote when urged to make concessions to the strikers and their union, the \\"rights and interests of the laboring man will be protected and cared for--not by the labor agitators, but by the Christian men to whom God in His infinite wisdom has given the control of the property interests of the country.\\"H. W. Brands, T. R.: The Last Romantic (1998) p. 457 The union used this letter to sway public opinion in favor of the strike. Roosevelt wanted to intervene, but he was told by his Attorney General, Philander Knox, that he had no authority to do so. Hanna and many others in the Republican Party were likewise concerned about the political implications if the strike dragged on into winter, when the need for anthracite was greatest. As Roosevelt told Hanna, \\"A coal famine in the winter is an ugly thing and I fear we shall see terrible suffering and grave disaster.\\"Herbert Croly, Marcus Alonzo Hanna (1912) p. 399 Roosevelt convened a conference of representatives of government, labor, and management on October 3, 1902. The union considered the mere holding of a meeting to be tantamount to union recognition and took a conciliatory tone. The owners told Roosevelt that strikers had killed over 20 men and that he should use the power of government \\"to protect the man who wants to work, and his wife and children when at work.\\" With proper protection, the owner said that they would produce enough coal to end the fuel shortage; they refused to enter into any negotiations with the union. The governor sent in the National Guard, who protected the mines and the minority of men still working. Roosevelt attempted to persuade the union to end the strike with a promise that he would create a commission to study the causes of the strike and propose a solution, which Roosevelt promised to support with all of the authority of his office. Mitchell refused and his membership endorsed his decision by a nearly unanimous vote.Henry F. Pringle, Theodore Roosevelt: A Biography (2002) p, 190 The economics of coal revolved around two factors: most of the cost of production was wages for miners, and if the supply fell, the price would shoot up. In an age before the use of oil and electricity, there were no good substitutes. Profits were low in 1902 because of an over supply; therefore the owners welcomed a moderately long strike. They had huge stockpiles which increased daily in value. It was illegal for the owners to conspire to shut down production, but not so if the miners went on strike. The owners welcomed the strike, but they adamantly refused to recognize the union, because they feared the union would control the coal industry by manipulating strikes.Frederick Saward and Sydney A. Hale, The Coal Trade (1920) p. 71 Roosevelt continued to try to build support for a mediated solution, persuading former president Grover Cleveland to join the commission he was creating. He also considered nationalizing the mines under the leadership of John M. Schofield.Theodore Roosevelt, a Civil War General, and the Battle for Labor Peace This would put the U.S. Army in control of the coalfieldsAutobiography of Theodore RooseveltTheodore Roosevelt and His Times: A Chronicle of the Progressive Movement to \\"run the mines as a receiver\\", Roosevelt wrote.The role of federal military forces in domestic disorders, 1877-1945 J.P. Morgan intervenes Theodore Roosevelt and J.P. Morgan have a meeting where they agree on a resolution for the strike. J.P. Morgan, the dominant figure in American finance, had played a role in resolving the 1900 strike. He was deeply involved in this strike as well: his interests included the Reading Railroad, one of the largest employers of miners. He had installed George Baer, who spoke for the industry throughout the strike, as the head of the railroad.Jean Strouse, Morgan: American Financier (2000) pp 449-51 At the urging of Secretary of War Elihu Root, Morgan came up with another compromise proposal that provided for arbitration, while giving the industry the right to deny that it was bargaining with the union by directing that each employer and its employees communicate directly with the commission. The employers agreed on the condition that the five members be a military engineer, a mining engineer, a judge, an expert in the coal business, and an \\"eminent sociologist\\". The employers were willing to accept a union leader as the \\"eminent sociologist,\\" so Roosevelt named E. E. Clark, head of the railway conductors' union, as the \\"eminent sociologist.\\" After Catholic leaders exerted pressure, he added a sixth member, Catholic bishop John Lancaster Spalding, and Commissioner Wright as the seventh member.James Ford Rhodes, The McKinley and Roosevelt Administrations, 1897-1909 (1922) p 246 Anthracite Coal Strike Commission The anthracite strike ended, after 163 days, on October 23, 1902. The commissioners began work the next day, then spent a week touring the coal regions. Wright used the staff of the Department of Labor to collect data about the cost of living in the coalfields. Commission appointed by Roosevelt to resolve the dispute, photographed by left The commissioners held hearings in Scranton over the next three months, taking testimony from 558 witnesses, including 240 for the striking miners, 153 for nonunion mineworkers, 154 for the operators, and eleven called by the Commission itself. Baer made the closing arguments for the coal operators, while lawyer Clarence Darrow closed for the workers. Although the commissioners heard some evidence of terrible conditions, they concluded that the \\"moving spectacle of horrors\\" represented only a small number of cases. By and large, social conditions in mine communities were found to be good, and miners were judged as only partly justified in their claim that annual earnings were not sufficient \\"to maintain an American standard of living.\\" Baer said in his closing arguments, \\"These men don't suffer. Why, hell, half of them don't even speak English\\".Walter T. K. Nugent, Progressivism: A Very Short Introduction (2010) p. 38 Darrow, for his part, summed up the pages of testimony of mistreatment he had obtained in the soaring rhetoric for which he was famous: \\"We are working for democracy, for humanity, for the future, for the day will come too late for us to see it or know it or receive its benefits, but which will come, and will remember our struggles, our triumphs, our defeats, and the words which we spake.\\"John A. Farrell, Clarence Darrow: Attorney for the Damned (2011) p, 116 In the end, however, the rhetoric of both sides made little difference to the Commission, which split the difference between mineworkers and mine owners. The miners asked for 20% wage increases, and most were given a 10% increase. The miners had asked for an eight-hour day and were awarded a nine-hour day instead of the standard ten hours then prevailing. While the operators refused to recognize the United Mine Workers, they were required to agree to a six-man arbitration board, made up of equal numbers of labor and management representatives, with the power to settle labor disputes. Mitchell considered that de facto recognition and called it a victory.Wiebe, 1961, p 249-51 Aftermath of the strike John Mitchell wrote that eight men died during the five months, \\"three or four\\" of them strikers or sympathizers. During the extensive arbitration testimony, after company owners made claims that the strikers had killed 21 men, Mitchell disagreed strongly and offered to resign his position if they could name the men and show proof. upright The first casualty occurred July 1. An immigrant striker named Anthony Giuseppe was found fatally shot near a Lehigh Valley Coal Company colliery in Old Forge; it was thought the Coal and Iron Police guarding the site shot blindly through a fence. Street fighting in Shenandoah, Pennsylvania on July 30 between a mob of 5,000 striking miners versus police resulted in the beating death of Joseph Beddall, a merchant and the brother of the deputy sheriff. Contemporary reporting describes three other deaths and widespread shooting injuries among strikers and Shenandoah police. On October 9, a striker named William Durham was shot and killed in Brownsville, Pennsylvania, near Shenandoah. He'd been loitering near the half-dynamited house of a non-union worker and disobeyed an order to halt. The legality of that killing under martial law became a case, Commonwealth v. Shortall, that was taken to the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. The behavior and private role of the Coal and Iron Police during the strike led to the formation of the Pennsylvania State Police, on May 2, 1905 as Senate Bill 278 was signed into law by Governor Samuel W. Pennypacker.PHMC: Governors of Pennsylvania The two forces operated in parallel until 1931. Organized labor celebrated the outcome as a victory for the UMWA and American Federation of Labor unions generally. Membership in other unions soared, as moderates argued they could produce concrete benefits for workers much sooner than radical Socialists who planned to overthrow capitalism in the future. Mitchell proved his leadership skills and mastery of the problems of ethnic, skill, and regional divisions that had long plagued the union in the anthracite region. By contrast the strikes of the radical Western Federation of Miners in the West often turned into full-scale warfare between strikers and both employers and the civil and military authorities. This strike was successfully mediated through the intervention of the federal government, which strove to provide a \\"Square Deal\\"--which Roosevelt took as the motto for his administration--to both sides. The settlement was an important step in the Progressive era reforms of the decade that followed. There were no more major coal strikes until the 1920s.Wiebe 1961 See also *History of coal miners *History of coal mining *History of coal mining in the United States *Lackawanna County Courthouse and John Mitchell Monument *List of worker deaths in United States labor disputes *Presidency of Theodore Roosevelt ReferencesBibliography *Akin, William E. \\"The Catholic Church and Unionism, 1886-1902: A Study of Institutional Adjustment.\\" Studies in History and Society. 3:1 (1970): 14-24. *Aurand, Harold W.

It is a medium-sized spitz-type dog. Appearance The Thai Bangkaew Dog is compactly built and square in profile. It is well proportioned, with a smooth gait. The double coat consists of a short undercoat, with longer guard hairs growing through it forming the outer coat. The coat is thicker and longer around the neck, chest, and back forming a lion-like ruff, which is more noticeable on male dogs than on female dogs. The plumed tail is carried with moderate upward curve over the back. The breed comes in white with shades of red, gray, brown, and black in a wide variety of patterns. There are some that have white coats. History Bangkaew is a village located in the Bang Rakam District, Phitsanulok Province in the central region of Thailand. In this district, near the Yom River, a Buddhist abbot's local black and white female dog was crossed with a now extinct wild dog, producing the first of the breed. Since 1957, selective breeding from their single litters produced today's breed.FCI Breed Standard Health and temperament This is an intelligent, athletic, agile and robust breed. It will be a loyal and protective family companion as well as an excellent watchdog. The Thai Bangkaew Dog is a loving, intelligent and alert dog that makes an excellent and devoted family companion as well as a good working and hunting dog. This breed will be affectionate with its family, will get along well with children and a properly socialized dog will be gentle with smaller children. The Thai Bangkaew Dog is not an aggressive breed but can be aloof with strangers and is very territorial and protective. However, this breed is more likely to threaten than bite and attack. It makes a great guardian and watchdog that will loudly announce arrival of any visitor (friend or stranger). The Thai Bangkaew Dog is a breed that is known to be very aggressive towards other dogs. With other animals your dog will get along well if you start socialization from a very young age. This breed is definitely for an experienced owner. The Thai Bangkaew Dog is an intelligent breed, but is independent and can be stubborn. Therefore, it's not always easy to train. This breed needs consistent training in short sessions with many rewards such as treats or praise. Avoid repetitive tasks, as this dog gets bored quickly. In summary, the Thai Bangkaew Dog needs a confident and experienced owner who can earn the dog's trust and respect. Socialization must start from a very young age.

This diversification of the farming system initiates an agroecological succession, like that in natural ecosystems, and so starts a chain of events that enhance the functionality and sustainability of the farming system. Trees also produce a wide range of useful and marketable products from fruits/nuts, medicines, wood products, etc. This intentional combination of agriculture and forestry has multiple benefits, such as greatly enhanced yields from staple food crops, enhanced farmer livelihoods from income generation, increased biodiversity, improved soil structure and health, reduced erosion, and carbon sequestration. Agroforestry practices are highly beneficial in the tropics, especially in subsistence smallholdings in sub- Saharan Africa and have been found to be beneficial in Europe and the United States. Agroforestry shares principles with intercropping but can also involve much more complex multi-strata agroforests containing hundreds of species. Agroforestry can also utilise nitrogen-fixing plants such as legumes to restore soil nitrogen fertility. The nitrogen-fixing plants can be planted either sequentially or simultaneously. Agroforestry contour planting integrated with animal grazing on Taylors Run farm, Australia As a science According to Wojtkowski, the theoretical base for agroforestry lies in ecology, or agroecology. Agroecology encompasses diverse applications such as: improved nutrient and carbon cycling; water retention of soils; biodiverse habitats; protection from pest, disease and weed outbreaks; protection of soils from water and wind erosion, etc.Wojtkowski, P. (2019) Agroecology: Simplified and Explained, Springer, 420p. From this perspective, agroforestry is one of the three principal agricultural land-use sciences. The other two are agriculture and forestry. Benefits Agroforestry systems can be advantageous over conventional agricultural and forest production methods. They can offer increased productivity; social, economic and environmental benefits, as well as greater diversity in the ecological goods and services provided. Consequently, it has been proposed by Roger Leakey as a means to 'reboot' tropical agriculture. Biodiversity Biodiversity in agroforestry systems is typically higher than in conventional agricultural systems. Two or more interacting plant species in a given area create a more complex habitat that can support a wider variety of fauna. Agroforestry is important for biodiversity for different reasons. It provides a more diverse habitat than a conventional agricultural system in which the tree component creates ecological niches for a wide range of organisms both above and below ground. The life cycles and food chains associated with this diversification initiates an agroecological succession that creates functional agroecosystems that confer sustainability. Tropical bat and bird diversity for instance can be comparable to the diversity in natural forests. Although agroforestry systems do not provide as many floristic species as forests and do not show the same canopy height, they do provide food and nesting possibilities. A further contribution to biodiversity is that the germplasm of sensitive species can be preserved.Jose, S. (2009). Agroforestry for ecosystem services and environmental benefits: an overview. Agroforestry Systems, 76(1), 1‚Äì10. doi:10.1007/s10457-009-9229-7 As agroforests have no natural clear areas, habitats are more uniform. Furthermore, agroforests can serve as corridors between habitats. Agroforestry can help to conserve biodiversity having a positive influence on other ecosystem services. Soil and plant growth Depleted soil can be protected from soil erosion by groundcover plants such as naturally growing grasses in agroforestry systems. These help to stabilise the soil as they increase cover compared to short-cycle cropping systems. Soil cover is a crucial factor in preventing erosion. Cleaner water through reduced nutrient and soil surface runoff can be a further advantage of agroforestry. The runoff can be reduced by decreasing its velocity and increasing infiltration into the soil. Compared to row-cropped fields nutrient uptake can be higher and reduce nutrient loss into streams. Further advantages concerning plant growth: * Bioremediation * Drought resistance * Increased crop stability  Contribution to sustainable agricultural systems  * Reduced poverty through increased production of wood and other products * Increased food security by restored soil fertility for food crops * Multifunctional site use, e.g., crop production and animal grazing * Reduced global warming and hunger risk by increasing the number of drought-resistant trees and the subsequent production of fruits, nuts and edible oils * Reduced deforestation and pressure on woodlands by providing farm-grown fuelwood * Reduced need for toxic chemicals (insecticides, herbicides, etc.) * Improved human nutrition through more diverse farm outputs * Growing space for medicinal plants e.g., in situations where people have limited access to mainstream medicines Other environmental goals Carbon sequestration is an important ecosystem service. Agroforestry practices can increase carbon stocks in soil and woody biomass. Trees in agroforestry systems, like in new forests, can recapture some of the carbon that was lost by cutting existing forests. They also provide additional food and products. The rotation age and the use of the resulting products are important factors controlling the amount of carbon sequestered. Agroforests can reduce pressure on primary forests by providing forest products. Agroforestry practices may realize a number of environmental goals, such as: * Odour, dust and noise reduction * Green space and visual aesthetics * Enhancement or maintenance of wildlife habitat Adaptation to climate change Tree cover accounts for more than 75% of global carbon pool. Agroforestry can significantly contribute to climate change mitigation along with adaptation benefits. A case study in Kenya found that the adoption of agroforestry drove carbon storage and increased livelihoods simultaneously among small-scale farmers. In this case, maintaining the diversity of tree species, especially land use and farm size are important factors. Especially in recent years, poor smallholder farmers turned to agroforestry as a mean to adapt to climate change. A study from the CGIAR research program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS) found from a survey of over 700 households in East Africa that at least 50% of those households had begun planting trees in a change from earlier practices. The trees were planted with fruit, tea, coffee, oil, fodder and medicinal products in addition to their usual harvest. Agroforestry was one of the most widespread adaptation strategies, along with the use of improved crop varieties and intercropping. Applications=Tropical Agroforestry Research with Faidherbia albida in Zambia showed maximum maize yields of 4.0 tonnes per hectare using fertilizer and inter-cropped with these trees at densities of 25 to 100 trees per hectare, compared to average maize yields in Zimbabwe of 1.1 tonnes per hectare. =Hillside systems= A well-studied example of an agroforestry hillside system is the Quesungual Slash and Mulch Agroforestry System (QSMAS) in Lempira Department, Honduras. This region was historically used for slash and burn subsistence agriculture. Due to heavy seasonal floods, the exposed soil was washed away, leaving infertile barren soil exposed to the dry season. Farmed hillside sites had to be abandoned after a few years and new forest was burned. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) helped introduce a system incorporating local knowledge consisting of the following steps: # Thin and prune Hillside secondary forest, leaving individual beneficial trees, especially nitrogen-fixing trees. They help reduce soil erosion, maintain soil moisture, provide shade and provide an input of nitrogen-rich organic matter in the form of litter. # Plant maize in rows. This is a traditional local crop. # Harvest from the dried plant and plant beans. The maize stalks provide an ideal structure for the climbing bean plants. Bean is a nitrogen-fixing plant and therefore helps introduce more nitrogen. # Pumpkin can be planted during this time. Its large leaves and horizontal growth provide additional shade and moisture retention. It does not compete with the beans for sunlight since the latter grow vertically on the stalks. # Every few seasons, rotate the crop by grazing cattle, allowing grass to grow and adding soil organic matter and nutrients (manure). The cattle prevent total reforestation by grazing around the trees. # Repeat. =Shade crops= With shade applications, crops are purposely raised under tree canopies within the shady environment. The understory crops are shade tolerant or the overstory trees have fairly open canopies. A conspicuous example is shade-grown coffee. This practice reduces weeding costs and improves coffee quality and taste. =Crop-over-tree systems= Crop-over-tree systems employ woody perennials in the role of a cover crop. For this, small shrubs or trees pruned to near ground level are utilized. The purpose is to increase in- soil nutrients and/or to reduce soil erosion. =Intercropping and alley cropping= With alley cropping, crop strips alternate with rows of closely spaced tree or hedge species. Normally, the trees are pruned before planting the crop. The cut leafy material is spread over the crop area to provide nutrients. In addition to nutrients, the hedges serve as windbreaks and reduce erosion. In tropical areas of North and South America, various species of Inga such as I. edulis and I. oerstediana have been used for alley cropping. Intercropping is advantageous in Africa, particularly in relation to improving maize yields in the sub-Saharan region. Use relies upon the nitrogen-fixing tree species Sesbania sesban, Tephrosia vogelii, Gliricidia sepium and Faidherbia albida. In one example, a ten-year experiment in Malawi showed that, by using the fertilizer tree Gliricidia (Gliricidia sepium) on land on which no mineral fertilizer was applied, maize yields averaged 3.3 tonnes per hectare as compared to one tonne per hectare in plots without fertilizer trees or mineral fertilizers. =Taungya= Taungya is a system originating in Burma. In the initial stages of an orchard or tree plantation, trees are small and widely spaced. The free space between the newly planted trees accommodates a seasonal crop. Instead of costly weeding, the underutilized area provides an additional output and income. More complex taungyas use between-tree space for multiple crops. The crops become more shade tolerant as the tree canopies grow and the amount of sunlight reaching the ground declines. Thinning can maintain sunlight levels. Itteri Agroforestry Itteri agroforestry systems is a traditionally evolved in Tamil Nadu since from time immemorial. It involves the deliberate management of multipurpose trees and shrubs grown in intimate association with herbaceous species. It often occurs along the village/ farm roads, small gullies, and also along the boundaries of the agricultural field. Temperate Agroforestry Although originally a concept used in tropical agronomy, the USDA distinguishes five applications of agroforestry for temperate climates. =Alley cropping and Strip cropping= Alley cropping corn fields between rows of walnut trees Alley cropping (see above) can also be used in temperate climates. Strip cropping is similar to alley cropping in that trees alternate with crops. The difference is that, with alley cropping, the trees are in single row. With strip cropping, the trees or shrubs are planted in wide strip. The purpose can be, as with alley cropping, to provide nutrients, in leaf form, to the crop. With strip cropping, the trees can have a purely productive role, providing fruits, nuts, etc. while, at the same time, protecting nearby crops from soil erosion and harmful winds. =Fauna- based systems= Silvopasture over the years (Australia) Trees can benefit fauna. The most common examples are silvopasture where cattle, goats, or sheep browse on grasses grown under trees. In hot climates, the animals are less stressed and put on weight faster when grazing in a cooler, shaded environment. The leaves of trees or shrubs can also serve as fodder. Similar systems support other fauna. Deer and hogs gain when living and feeding in a forest ecosystem, especially when the tree forage nourishes them. In aquaforestry, trees shade fish ponds. In many cases, the fish eat the leaves or fruit from the trees. The dehesa or montado system of silviculture are an example of pigs and bulls being held extensively in Spain and Portugal.Fra. Paleo, Urbano. (2010). \\"The dehesa/montado landscape\\". pp. 149‚Äì151 in Sustainable Use of Biological Diversity in Socio-ecological Production Landscapes, eds. B√©lair, C., Ichikawa, K., Wong, B.Y.L. and Mulongoy, K.J. Montreal: Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity. Technical Series no. 52. =Boundary systems= A riparian buffer bordering a river in Iowa * A living fence can be a thick hedge or fence wire strung on living trees. In addition to restricting the movement of people and animals, living fences offer habitat to insect-eating birds and, in the case of a boundary hedge, slow soil erosion. * Riparian buffers are strips of permanent vegetation located along or near active watercourses or in ditches where water runoff concentrates. The purpose is to keep nutrients and soil from contaminating the water. * Windbreaks reduce wind velocity over and around crops. This increases yields through reduced drying of the crop and/or by preventing the crop from toppling in strong wind gusts. =Agroforestry in Switzerland= Since the 1950s, 4/5 of Swiss hochstammobstg√§rten (traditional orchards with tall trees) have disappeared. An agroforestry scheme was tested here with hochstamm trees together with annual crops. Trees tested were walnut tree (Juglans regia) and cherry tree (Prunus avium). Forty to seventy trees per hectare were recommended, yields were somewhat decreasing with increasing tree height and foliage. However, the total yield per area is shown to be up to 30 percent higher than for monocultural systems. Another set of tests involve growing Populus tremula for biofuel at 52 trees a hectare and with grazing pasture alternated every two to three years with maize or sorghum, wheat, strawberries and fallowing between rows of modern short-pruned & grafted apple cultivars ('Boskoop' & 'Spartan') and growing modern sour cherry cultivars ('Morina', 'Coraline' und 'Achat') and apples, with bushes in the rows with tree (dogrose, Cornus mas, Hippophae rhamnoides) intercropped with various vegetables.  Historical use  Similar methods were historically utilized by Native Americans. California Indians periodically burned oak and other habitats to maintain a 'pyrodiversity collecting model'. This method allowed for greater tree health and improved habitat in general. Challenges Although agroforestry systems can be advantageous, they are not widespread in the US as of 2013. As suggested by a survey of extension programs in the United States, obstacles (ordered most critical to least critical) to agroforestry adoption include: Some solutions to these obstacles have been suggested.

The series was known for bringing to life characters from Harvey Comics, such as Casper the Friendly Ghost, Wendy the Good Little Witch, Herman and Katnip, Little Audrey, and Baby Huey. All shorts from Baby Huey and Little Audrey are included. It was the successor to the series Color Classics produced by Fleischer Studios (indeed, several Noveltoons feature characters which originated in Color Classics). This series was also similar to the two series from Warner Bros., Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies, in that it features several recurring characters with one general title. The pre-October 1950 Noveltoons were sold to television distributor U.M. & M. TV Corporation in 1956. National Telefilm Associates acquired them soon afterward, eventually to be returned to Paramount via various transactions over the intervening decades (and today part of the Melange Pictures holdings formerly held by predecessor company Republic). Paramount sold the rest of the Noveltoons to Harvey Comics, which was in turn sold to Classic Media, now owned by DreamWorks Animation, a subsidiary of Comcast's NBCUniversal and currently distributed by Universal Television. Until 1962, newly-produced Noveltoons were also sold to Harvey. Paramount still owns the remaining Noveltoons, but a number of them have entered the public domain.

The International Law Commission (ILC) is a body of experts responsible for helping develop and codify international law. It is composed of 34 individuals recognized for their expertise and qualifications in international law, who are elected by the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) every five years. The ideological roots of the ILC originated as early as the 19th century, when the Congress of Vienna in Europe developed several international rules and principles to regulate conduct among its members. Following several attempts to develop and rationalize international law in the early 20th century, the ILC was formed in 1947 by the UNGA pursuant to the Charter of the United Nations, which calls on the Assembly to help develop and systematize international law. The Commission held its first session in 1949, with its initial work influenced by the Second World War and subsequent concerns about international crimes such as genocide and acts of aggression. The ILC has since held annual sessions at the U.N. Office at Geneva to discuss and debate various topics in international law and develop international legal principles accordingly. It is responsible for several foundational developments in international law, including the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, which establishes a framework for forming and interpreting treaties, and the International Criminal Court, the first permanent tribunal tasked with adjudicating offenses such as genocide and crimes against humanity. Origin Several attempts were made throughout history to codify international law. The work that led to the International Law Commission was begun in the Resolution of the Assembly of the League of Nations of 22 September 1924, which established the Committee of Experts for the Progressive Codification of International Law, consisting of 17 members, for the purpose of making recommendations as to which issues required to be addressed in international law and the steps desirable to that end. The Committee's work led to the League of Nations Codification Conference of 1930, which dealt mainly with the issues of nationality laws, territorial waters and state responsibility to damage caused to foreign nationals. Many concepts of the 1930 conference were adopted in the Charter of the United Nations, which established the successor organization to the League. Article 13, Paragraph 1 therein states: > \\"1. The General Assembly shall initiate studies and make recommendations for > the purpose of: a. ... encouraging the progressive development of > international law and its codification.\\" Pursuant to this provision, on December 11, 1946, the General Assembly passed Resolution 94, which called to establish a committee of legal experts to make recommendations to the UN Secretary-General on the ways the General Assembly could encourage the progressive development of international law and its codification. The committee of experts consisted of 17 members and convened from May 12 to June 17, 1947. It recommended to establish a permanent UN commission to promote these objectives. On November 21, 1947, the UN General Assembly passed Resolution 174, which provided for the creation of an \\"International Law Commission\\" in order to fulfill the obligations of the Charter. To the resolution was attached the statute of the Commission, which defined its purposes as being: * Promoting the codification of international law. * Solving problems within both public and private international law. Working procedures for the Commission were elaborated in articles 16-26. Working procedures of the ILC The work of the Commission is regulated by its statute, which was initially approved by the General Assembly on November 21, 1947, and amended on December 12, 1950, December 3, 1955, and November 18, 1981. It consists of 34 members (originally 15) who all must be experts on international law, elected to the position by the General Assembly from a list of candidates nominated by governments of member states in the UN. Members act as individuals and not as officials representing their respective states. One venue of action for the commission in the codification of principles of international law is when requested to do so by the General Assembly. In that case, the commission appoints one of its members as Special Rapporteur on that subject and prepares a plan of work regarding the issue in question. Governments are requested to submit to the commission their written opinions on the issue in question, as specified in the plan of work. The rapporteur then writes a report of his or her recommendations on the subject under discussion and the report must be approved by the rest of the commission as well as by the UN Secretary-General before it becomes an official commission document. The commission then reconsiders the report after receiving additional written opinions from governments, and the report is being submitted to the General Assembly for approval. Another venue of action is when the commission is requested either by a government, an inter-governmental organization or a UN agency to draft proposals for international conventions on various issues. In that case, the commission formulates a plan of work and receives written opinions from governments on the issue in question. The final draft is also submitted to the General Assembly. The commission also works independently of external requests by its regular work of considering questions of international law. Also in these cases, all recommendations for actions are submitted to the General Assembly for final approval. The commission's independent deliberations usually take place in its annual sessions. Annual sessions of the commission The commission's main function since its establishment has been its annual sessions, starting from 1949. At first, the proceedings of these sessions were kept in a mimeograph form and were not available to the public, but on December 3, 1955, the General Assembly passed resolution 987, which required the publication of a summary of the proceedings of these meetings in a special yearbook designated for this purpose, and this in order to make the information available to both public and governments. For the 1st session, proceedings have been published in one volume, but starting from the 2nd session, proceedings have been published in two volumes ‚Äì the first containing summary of the deliberations and the second containing documents adopted at that session. At the beginning of each session, the commission elects one of its members to serve as its chairman until the next session. 1st session, 1949 The agenda for the first session was prepared by the General Assembly throughout 1947‚Äì1948. In resolution 177 (November 21, 1947), the Assembly charged the commission with formulating principles based on the judgement of the Nuremberg Tribunal and drafting a new code of offences against the peace of mankind. Resolution 178 (of the same day) charged the commission with preparing a document on the rights and duties of states in international law. Resolution of 260 (December 9, 1948) instructed the commission to consider the establishing of a criminal chamber within the International Court of Justice, for prosecuting political leaders guilty of crimes against international law. Election of the 15 commission members by the General Assembly took place on November 3, 1948. The 1st session of the commission was held in Lake Success, New York, US, from April 12 to June 9, 1949. The agenda for the session consisted of 6 items: * Making a general survey of topics of international law that require codification into treaties and conventions. * The rights and duties of states. * The Nuremberg Principles and the definition of crimes against the peace of mankind. * Possibility of establishing a judicial body to prosecute leaders guilty of genocide. * Finding ways to make the rules and documents of international law more available to the public and scholars. * Cooperation by the ILC with other UN agencies. At the very first meeting, US commission member Manley O. Hudson was elected chairman of the commission for the duration of that session, while the Soviet member Vladimir Koretsky was elected first vice-chairman and Indian member Benegal Rau was elected second vice-chairman. During that session, disagreement arose between the members as to whether the commission was entitled to include a topic on its agenda without prior consent of the General Assembly. On this issue, the commission decided that it was competent to do so, by a vote of 10 to 3.Yearbook of the ILC, 1949, p. 32 Regarding the range of issues to be included in the agenda for codification of international law, the commission decided to start working on a limited number of subjects at first. For that reason, it was decided to exclude at the time the issue of laws of war from the commission's discussions. Highest priority was given to the topics of law of treaties, arbitration, and regime of the sea, and rapporteurs were elected accordingly. Another topic under discussion was the declaration on the rights and duties of states. It was decided to exclude the issue of right of asylum from the proposed draft, and to discuss the matter further at the 2nd session. Other issues postponed until the 2nd session were: * The formulation of the Nuremberg Principles and the list of offenses against the peace of mankind. * The issue of universal criminal jurisdiction. * Making texts of international law more available. * Cooperation with governments and UN agencies. The commission approved a Draft Declaration on the Rights and Duties of States, which was the main legal document adopted at that session.Draft Declaration on Rights and Duties of States, 1949 A large portion of the work on this issue was done by the Panamanian representative Ricardo Joaqu√≠n Alfaro Jovan√©. The draft declaration was referred to the General Assembly for further deliberations, but in its resolution 596 of Dec. 7, 1951, the Assembly decided to postpone any further discussions on the document. The commission also decided about the time and place of the 2nd session to be held . It was decided to hold it in Geneva, starting from May 1950, for a maximum period of 10 weeks. 2nd session, 1950 The 2nd session was held in Geneva from June 5 to July 29, 1950. The chairman of that session was Georges Scelle. The agenda and the final resolutions of the session were as follows: * Original Item: Report of the 1st session and the draft declaration on the rights and duties of states, both of which were now approved by the General Assembly - Decision: the commission took note of that without taking further action. * Original Item: The General Assembly recommendation to give priority to the issue of territorial waters - Decision: the commission accepted the recommendation. * Original Item: Formulation of the Nuremberg Principles and the draft code of crimes against the peace and security of mankind - Decision: the commission formulated a set of seven principles to be referred to as \\"Nuremberg Principles\\". * Original Item: The desirability and possibility of establishing an international court to try political leaders guilty of genocide - Decision: the commission passed resolutions to the effect that the creation of such a court was desirable and possible. However, the creation of such a court was postponed until further discussions. * Original Item: Law of treaties - Decision: the commission postponed decisions until further study. * Original Item: Arbitral procedure between states - Decision: the commission was unable to reach agreement on compulsory arbitration procedures, and the issue was postponed until further considerations. * Original Item: Regime of the high seas - Decision: the commission determined that every ship on the high seas must have only one nationality flag for identification purposes. However, it was unable to agree on the rest of the issues relating to the regime of the high seas. * Original Item: Ways of making texts of international law more available - Decision: the commission recommended that wide distribution be made of UN publications on international law and that the UN begin publications of documentary series on international tribunals and national laws and constitutions of various states. In addition, the commission recommended to the General Assembly to formulate an international convention to regulate the exchange of legal publications between governments. * Original Item: Right of asylum - Decision: the commission decided to postpone any deliberations on the subject, since the issue was under discussion by the International Court of Justice. * Original Item: Cooperation of the commission with other UN agencies, governments and other national and international organizations. * Original Item: Date and place of the 3rd session - Decision: the commission decided it shall be held in Geneva for a maximum period of 12 weeks starting from May 1951. The conduct of the 2nd session was influenced by the East-West rift resulting from the Cold War. Already at the first meeting of that session, the Soviet member Koretsky protested that the People's Republic of China was not represented on the commission, claiming it represented the Chinese people and not the Republic of China, now ruling in Taiwan only. He demanded the Chinese member of the commission be replaced by a member from mainland China. Commission chairman Scelle opposed the Soviet demand, claiming that each member represented his own legal views rather than any government position. The commission accepted Hudson's position by a vote of 10 to 1, and Koretsky in protest left the session without attending any further meetings.Yearbook of the ILC, 1950, vol. 1, pp. 1-2 A letter of protest by the government of the People's Republic of China against the representation of Taiwan at the commission was presented to the commission on June 8, but no further action was taken in that regard. 3rd session, 1951 The 3rd session was held in Geneva from May 16 to July 27, 1951. The agenda of the session was as follows: * Item: General Assembly recommendations for revisions of the commission's statute - Decision: the commission made a partial report on the matter. * Item: The draft code of offenses against the peace of mankind - Decision: the commission formulated a draft. * Item: Duties of states in the event of the outbreak of hostilities - Decision: the commission decided to proceed with a definition of aggression in general terms. * Item: Law of treaties - Decision: the commission made a series of recommendations regarding the acceptance of reservations to multilateral treaties. * Item: Arbitral procedure. * Item: Regime of the high seas - Decision: the issue was postponed until further study. * Item: Date and place of the 4th session - Decision: the commission decided to hold the next session in Geneva for a period of ten weeks, starting from around June 1. * Item: Draft international convention or conventions for the elimination of statelessness - Decision: the issue was postponed until further study. * Item: Cooperation by the commission with other bodies - Decision: no definite decision was made. * Item: Development of a 20-year program for achieving peace through the United Nations - Decision: no definite decision was made. * Item: General Assembly comments on the report of the 2nd session. The conduct of the session was influenced by other international events, as the Syrian representative Faris El-Khouri was absent from the early meetings due to UN deliberations of Syrian complaints against Israel. 4th session, 1952 The 4th session was held in Geneva from June 4 to August 8, 1952. Much of the session was dedicated to the issue of arbitral procedure, on which the commission adopted a preliminary draft, consisting of 32 articles. 5th session, 1953 The 5th session was held in Geneva from June 1 to August 14, 1953. As was done at the opening meeting of the 2nd session, also at this session, the Soviet representative Feodor I. Kozhevnikov demanded to dismiss the representative of Taiwan and appoint a representative of the People's Republic of China in his place. The motion was denied this time as well, but the Soviet member did not walk out on the session as was done in 1950. The commission began work on drafting a convention to reduce the problem of statelessness. 6th session, 1954 The 6th session was held in Paris from June 3 to July 28, 1954. At the opening of the session, the chairman of UNESCO expressed greeting to the commission for holding a session at the seat of the organization. The commission formulated a draft convention for the reduction of statelessness and a draft code of crimes against the peace of mankind. 7th session, 1955 The 7th session was held in Geneva from May 2 to July 8, 1955. The commission adopted Provisional articles concerning the regime of the high seas. It also decided to request the UN Secretary General to start regular publication of the commission's sessions in order to make them available for the public. This decision led to General Assembly resolution 987, which paved the way to orderly publication of the commission's yearbook.Yearbook of the ILC, 1949, p. v 8th session, 1956 The 8th session was held

Achievements The International Law Commission's work has led to the creation of a number of treaties and other works of international law that are key to the present international legal order (see generally ), for example: * The Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties * The Vienna Convention on Succession of States in respect of Treaties * The Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations * The Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts * The International Criminal Court, first proposed in December 1948 at the request of the UN General Assembly. Criticism One of the problems regarding the work of the commission is the capability of governments to ignore its conclusions and refrain from accepting its recommendations when formulating conventions. At the 63rd meeting on July 7, 1950, chairman Georges Scelle complained that governments tended to ignore questions addressed to them by the commission out of lack of interest in its work.Yearbook of the ILC, 1950, vol. 1, p. 183 One criticism sounded about the work of the commission is that the brevity of its annual sessions (10 to 12 weeks) does not allow thorough study of the problems under discussion. Already at the 83 meeting of the commission, held on May 17, 1951, commission member Georges Scelle suggested the only way to fix the problem was by reforming the commission so that it would meet more often and whenever the Secretary General desired so.Yearbook of the ILC, 1951, vol. 1, p. 9. Another criticism sounded already at the early history of the commission was made by Colombian delegate Jose Maria Yepes that the commission refrained from formulating principles on new issues and thus presents itself as incompetent.Yearbook of the ILC, 1950, vol. 1, p. 217 See also *United Nations Office of Legal Affairs * United Nations General Assembly Sixth Committee (Legal) ReferencesFurther reading * Shabtai Rosenne, \\"The International Law Commission 1940-59\\", British Yearbook of International Law, vol. 36 (1960) * H.W.

Caracas: Published by the author. is a cartographic approach to biogeography that basically plots distributions of a particular taxon or group of taxa on maps and connects the disjunct distribution areas or collection localities together with lines called tracks. Tracks Panbiogeographic tracks of the ratite birds, the southern beech Nothofagus, and the New Zealand frog Leiopelma A track is a representation of the spatial form of a species distribution and can give insights into the spatial processes that generated that distribution. Crossing of an ocean or sea basin or any other major tectonic structure (e.g. a fault zone) by an individual track constitutes a baseline. Individual tracks are superimposed, and if they coincide according to a specified criterion (e.g. shared baselines or compatible track geometries), the resulting summary lines are considered generalized (or standard) tracks. Generalized tracks suggest the pre-existence of ancestral biotas, which subsequently become fragmented by tectonic and/or climate change. The area where two or more generalized tracks intersect is called node. It means that different ancestral biotic and geological fragments interrelate in space/time, as a consequence of terrain collision, docking, or suturing, thus constituting a composite area. A concentration of numerical, genetical or morphological diversity within a taxon in a given area constitutes a main massing. Over the last two decades, panbiogeography as first conceived by CroizatCroizat (1958)Croizat (1964) and further developed by researchers in New Zealand and Latin AmericaCraw, R.C., Grehan, J.R. & Heads, M.J. (1999). Panbiogeography: Tracking the History of Life. Oxford University Press, New York. became established as a productive research programme in historical biogeography. Panbiogeography provides a method for analyzing the geographic (spatial) structure of distributions in order to generate predictions about the evolution of species and other taxa in space and time. Panbiogeographic key concepts of track, node, baseline, and main massing have shown to be powerful analytical tools, especially following the mathematical formalization of these concepts with the development of quantitative panbiogeography.Craw et al. (1999) Such developments were based on the application of concepts and methods from graph theory, for example minimum spanning trees to depict individual tracks in a more rigorous way, clique analysis to identify standard tracks, and nodal analysis to determine the precise location of panbiogeographic nodes. Panbiogeography emphasizes the analysis of raw locality and broader distribution data for taxa and may thus benefit from modern technological advances for the collection, storage, and analysis of such data as online biodiversity databases of georeferenced records, the Global Positioning System (GPS) and Geographic Information Systems (GIS). technology. Furthermore, besides its academic interest and scientific relevance as a method for the analysis of earth/life historical relationships, panbiogeographic concepts may also be useful to address the critical issue of global biodiversity conservation in a potentially fast and cost-effective way.

The temple has been a place for pilgrimage for centuries, and is designated as both a Place of Scenic Beauty and as a National Historic Site It is located within the borders of the Za≈ç Quasi-National Park. The temple buildings clinging to the steep, forested, rocky hillsides are picturesque and unusual. History According to temple tradition, it was founded in 860 AD by the priest Ennin, who is better known by his posthumous name, . In 847 AD Ennin returned to Japan from studies in Tang Dynasty China and in 854 AD he became the chief priest of the Tendai sect at Enryaku-ji on Mt. Hiei near Kyoto. Risshaku-ji was founded as a branch temple of Enryaku-ji by the order of Emperor Seiwa, and to this day the ritual fire brought from Enryaku-ji is still burning in the main temple. The exact date and circumstances of the foundation of the temple are uncertain, but it dates to at least the early Heian period based on dating of the oldest of its surviving wooden statuary. The temple has a long standing tradition that it houses the grave of Ennin in a cave within the temple grounds. Although Enning died on Mount Hiei in 864 AD, and there is no record that his remains were transferred here, Ann archaeological investigation in 1948 found a gold-leaf encrusted casket containing five sets of human remains and fragments of a Heian period wooden statue of Ennin within the cave. The temple developed into the major Heian period center for Buddhism in Dewa Province (now Yamagata and Akita prefectures).Kodansha Encyclopedia of Japan vol. 6 p. 320 and 321, 1983 The temple was patronized by the Kamakura shogunate and grew in territory. It was rebuilt after a fire in the mid-13th century and was converted to Zen Buddhism. The current Min Hall, known here as the Konpon-ch≈´d≈ç was rebuilt in 1356 by Shiba Kaneyori, lord of Yamagata Castle, who also returned it to the Tendai sect. It was visited by the artist Sessh≈´ T≈çy≈ç in 1482, who made many sketches of its precincts. The temple was burned down again during the wars of the Sengoku period, bu was restored by the Date clan and the Mogami clan.

The clerk's office, dating from the 1780s, is the oldest extant government office building in West Virginia. The kitchen building (c. 1750) is the oldest extant component of the Wilson‚ÄìWodrow‚ÄìMytinger House and the oldest extant building in Romney. Throughout the course of its history, the Wilson‚ÄìWodrow‚ÄìMytinger House has also been known as the Andrew Wodrow House, the Mytinger Family Home, and the Mytinger House. The earliest recorded person residing on Lot Number 48 in Romney was Hugh Murphy. In 1763, Colonel George William Wilson received a patent to Lot Number 48 from Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron to purchase the lot from Murphy. Wilson served as major of the Hampshire County militia during the French and Indian War. Wilson relocated to Pennsylvania, and in 1770, George Washington spent the night in a log cabin on the northeastern corner of Lot Number 48. Andrew Wodrow arrived in Hampshire County during the latter phase of the American Revolutionary War or shortly after its close, and in 1782, he was named clerk of court for Hampshire County. Wodrow completed the clerk‚Äôs office building in the 1780s, and the complex assumed its current composition by 1790. Wodrow served as Clerk of Court for Hampshire County until his death in 1814, after which ownership passed to Wodrow‚Äôs son-in-law John McDowell, a Dr. McClinoch, and the Mytinger family. who retained the property for about 100 years. Manning H. Williams purchased the house, and restored it in 1962. The Wilson‚ÄìWodrow‚ÄìMytinger House was purchased by Dr. Herbert P. Stelling in 1973, and it was opened as a museum and an arts and handicrafts shop known as Colonial Craftsmen. While under Stelling family ownership, the house was listed to the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. In 1985, the Wilson‚ÄìWodrow‚ÄìMytinger House was purchased by its current owners, Old Hampshire, Ltd.  Geography and setting  The Wilson‚ÄìWodrow‚ÄìMytinger House property is located at 51 West Gravel Lane near the center of Romney, West Virginia, within the eastern section of town Lot Number 48 and the western section of Lot Number 58. Taggart Hall, a late 18th-century residence, is located to the property's immediate east, and serves as the headquarters for the Fort Mill Ridge Foundation, the Hampshire County Convention and Visitors Bureau, and the Hampshire County Chamber of Commerce. Across West Gravel Lane to the immediate south of the Wilson‚ÄìWodrow‚ÄìMytinger House is the parking lot of the Romney Volunteer Fire Department, which was formerly the location of the town's Old Presbyterian Church and Cemetery on Lots No. 59 and 60.  History = Background  Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron The land upon which the Wilson‚ÄìWodrow‚ÄìMytinger House is located was originally part of the Northern Neck Proprietary, a land grant that the exiled Charles II awarded to seven of his supporters in 1649 during the English Interregnum. Following the Restoration in 1660, CharlesII finally ascended to the English throne. He renewed the Northern Neck Proprietary grant in 1662, revised it in 1669, and again renewed the original grant favoring original grantees Thomas Colepeper, 2nd Baron Colepeper, and Henry Bennet, 1st Earl of Arlington, in 1672. In 1681 Bennet sold his share to Lord Colepeper, who received a new charter for the entire land grant from James II in 1688. Following the deaths of Lord Colepeper, his wife Margaret, and his daughter Katherine, the Northern Neck Proprietary passed to Katherine's son Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron, in 1719. The area surrounding present-day Romney remained sparsely populated by European settlers until the middle of the 18th century, when tensions with Native Americans began to alleviate. Around this time, Lord Fairfax desired to have the lands of his Northern Neck Proprietary utilized and enticed European settlers to relocate there. This initiative by Lord Fairfax led to the establishment of population centers, such as Romney. After Lord Fairfax settled at Greenway Court near Winchester, he personally oversaw the selling and settling of his proprietary lands. One of his surveyors, George Washington, noted in 1748 that a number of people were living in the vicinity of present-day Romney. County records also indicated that Lord Fairfax began selling land within present-day Hampshire County in 1749. However, the name of the first person to own or build on the lot on which the Wilson‚ÄìWodrow‚ÄìMytinger House stands is not currently known. By 1754, Hampshire County was formed from parts of Frederick and Augusta counties. Gravel Lane, the present-day street upon which the Wilson‚ÄìWodrow‚ÄìMytinger House is located, is aligned to an old trail utilized by Native Americans prior to the arrival of European settlers. Gravel Lane was Romney's original main street, and according to the Federal Writers' Project in its Historic Romney 1762‚Äì1937 (1937), Gravel Lane \\"is the most historic lane in the town‚Äîand perhaps in the Northern Neck.\\"  Wilson family  The earliest known person to own Lot Number 48, on which the Wilson‚ÄìWodrow‚ÄìMytinger House is located, was Hugh Murphy. In 1763, Colonel George William Wilson received a patent to Lot Number 48 from Lord Fairfax and purchased the lot from Murphy. Wilson arrived in Romney sometime between 1761 and 1763. According to a report by George Washington to the Virginia House of Burgesses in November 1764, Wilson served as major of the Hampshire County militia during the French and Indian War. Washington praised Wilson for his earnestness and courage. Wilson's residency in Romney was brief, and sometime between 1764 and 1768, he relocated to Pennsylvania. Colonel George Washington, by alt=Painting of Washington, by Charles Wilson Peale, standing in a formal pose, in a colonel's uniform, right hand inserted in shirt. On the night of October 9, 1770, George Washington purportedly stayed the night in an old log house at the northeastern corner of Lot Number 48. This night was his final visit to Romney. In his diary, Washington wrote: Wilson became a justice of the peace for newly established Bedford County, Pennsylvania in 1771. Wilson was involved with the Pennsylvania‚ÄìVirginia boundary dispute, and was also selected by the Pennsylvanian faction at Fort Pitt to supervise the election of delegates to the constitutional convention from Pennsylvania. He encouraged support for the American Revolution and became the lieutenant colonel of the 8th Pennsylvania Regiment during the American Revolutionary War. He died of illness during the regiment's march to join Washington in New Jersey in January 1777. Wilson's daughter Mary Ann married Andrew Wodrow, and following Wilson's death, the Wilson‚ÄìWodrow‚ÄìMytinger House passed to his son-in-law Wodrow.  Wodrow family  Andrew Wodrow was born in Scotland, possibly in Glasgow, in 1752. Wodrow was descended from a family of scholars and professors. His father Robert Wodrow was a historian of the Church of Scotland with a \\"national reputation\\" and published his history in 1752, the same year as Wodrow's birth. Wodrow immigrated to the Colony of Virginia in 1768. During the 1770s, he established and expanded what became a thriving import business in Fredericksburg. Following the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War, he abandoned his business rather than import and sell goods from the Kingdom of Great Britain. Following the cessation of his import business, Wodrow was appointed to serve in the political post of clerk for the Revolutionary Committee for King George County on May 6, 1775. Wodrow arrived in Hampshire County during the latter phase of the American Revolutionary War or shortly after its close, and in 1782, he was named clerk of court for Hampshire County. Although he was the third person to hold this office, Wodrow was the first clerk to reside in the county. As a key official, Wodrow played an important role in the conveying and settling of lands and was a prosperous landholder in his own right. Wodrow is credited with giving the Wilson‚ÄìWodrow‚ÄìMytinger House complex its current form. He completed the grouping of the three sections of the Wilson‚ÄìWodrow‚ÄìMytinger House and his association with the property lent the complex significance for its listing in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). In the 1780s, Wodrow built the frame structure (the last of the house's three structures) on the property for use as a clerk's office. At that time, Gravel Lane was the main street of Romney and the function and architectural beauty of the clerk's office made it a center of activity in the town. According to West Virginia Antiquities Commission research assistant Phillip R. Pitts and historian James E. Harding, the clerk's office \\"might have served as a sign that [the Romney community] was developing in a manner indicative of the end of a frontier existence and the start of an established position.\\" By the beginning of the 19th century, Romney and Hampshire County had become a settled area with an agriculturally based economy that maintained a fairly constant growth. By 1790, the three structures constituting the Wilson‚ÄìWodrow‚ÄìMytinger House probably assumed their present arrangement. In 1790, the trustees of the Town of Romney commissioned John Mitchel to draft a cadastral survey map of Romney. Prior to this survey, Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron had commissioned a similar cadastral survey of the town sometime before its incorporation on December 23, 1762. On June 30, 1790, Mitchel submitted to the trustees a \\"Plan of the Town of Romney\\" that divided the town into 100 land lots of equal size, including the two lots on which the Wilson‚ÄìWodrow‚ÄìMytinger House was located (Lots Number 48 and 58). Wodrow remained in his post as Clerk of Court for Hampshire County until his death in 1814. Successive owners included Wodrow's son-in-law John McDowell, Dr. McClinoch who was one of Romney's first physicians, and the Mytinger family, in whose hands the property remained for about 100 years. Mytinger family Tobias Mytinger acquired the Wilson‚ÄìWodrow‚ÄìMytinger House property in 1861. The Mytinger family possessed the house among its members for the longest period of any of the house's owning families, for almost 100 years. Manning H. Williams purchased the house from the Mytinger family in 1959.  Williams family and restoration  The effort to restore the Wilson‚ÄìWodrow‚ÄìMytinger House complex began in 1962 while it was under the ownership of Manning H. Williams. Up until that time, much of the structures' original building materials and architectural details remained extant, although in a state of deterioration. Modern conveniences, including electricity, plumbing, and a central heating system, had not been installed. The restoration project commenced with the clerk's office in June 1962. During the restoration of the clerk's office, the structure's doors, woodwork, stairs, floors, and the majority of its plaster were retained. Replicas of the second story windows were fabricated, and old glass was collected from around the area and placed in the wooden sashes of the replica windows. Some of the structure's weatherboards were also replaced, and afterward, the exterior of the clerk's office was painted white. Ceilings with radiant electric heating were installed, and insulation was building insulation was added between the walls. During the painting of the structure's walls and woodwork, a concerted effort was made to duplicate the original or period paint colors. The residential structure, also known as \\"the dwelling,\\" required more extensive rehabilitation. Its floor beams were completely rebuilt, its rafters were replaced, and a new roof of red cedar (Juniperus virginiana) roof shingles were installed. Much of the brickwork of the residential structure's double chimneys had to be repaired. A section of the interior eastern wall of the largest first floor room was removed to unmask the half-timber construction, and another section was opened to expose the hand-riven lath. The structure's northern elevation retained some of its original siding, due to its protection by the porch, so it's siding was duplicated around the remainder of the exterior and painted white. The rear kitchen building was cleaned, repaired, and covered with new weatherboards, both its interior and exterior were painted white, and it was topped with cedar shakes. All the surrounding porches were rebuilt and roofed with cedar shingles, a brick walk was placed along the western (front) side of the clerk's office and around the residential structure to the rear of the property, and a white picket fence was built around the property.  Stelling family and Colonial Craftsmen  The Wilson‚ÄìWodrow‚ÄìMytinger House was purchased by Dr. Herbert P. Stelling of Barre, Massachusetts in May 1973. In October 1973, the house was opened as a museum and an arts and handicrafts shop known as Colonial Craftsmen. The museum and store were operated by four proprietors: Stelling's daughters Rebecca Stelling, Deborah Stelling, and Rhetta Stelling, and Gary Winkles. Colonial Craftsmen featured demonstrations of old craft skills and the sale of traditional craftsmen wares. While under Stelling family ownership, the Wilson‚ÄìWodrow‚ÄìMytinger House was listed to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) on August 22, 1977. It was only the second historic property in Hampshire County to be listed on NRHP after the Sloan‚ÄìParker House. Old Hampshire, Ltd. In October 1985, the Wilson‚ÄìWodrow‚ÄìMytinger House was purchased by Old Hampshire, Ltd., which consisted of Bob and Estelle Odle, Tom Stump, Lowell Hott, and Dottie Eddis. Hott and Eddis originally planned to convert the complex into a bed and breakfast; however, since 1988, they have utilized the residential house as the Romney satellite office for their Augusta Animal Hospital veterinary clinic. Hott and Eddis have continued to maintain and restore the Wilson‚ÄìWodrow‚ÄìMytinger House, and have completed large construction projects, including a renovation of the kitchen building's crumbling stone chimney and a replacement of the roof's shingles from the 1962 restoration in December 2019. In a 2019 interview with the Hampshire Review regarding their continued maintenance and restoration of the property, Hott remarked, \\"It's really been a labor of love for us.\\"  Old Presbyterian Church and Cemetery  Headstones relocated to Indian Mound Cemetery from the Old Presbyterian Cemetery Immediately south of the Wilson‚ÄìWodrow‚ÄìMytinger House, across East Gravel Lane, is the former location of Romney's Old Presbyterian Church and Cemetery. The church and cemetery were associated with the Wilson‚ÄìWodrow‚ÄìMytinger House, as Andrew Wodrow was a dynamic and influential member of the Presbyterian Church and granted Lots No. 59 and 60 in his will for the construction of the church and the establishment of the cemetery. Wodrow's executor, James Dailey, deeded the two land lots on April 1, 1816, to Mount Bethel Congregation trustees James Beach, William Inskeep, Adam Hare, and John Lawson for these purposes. Wodrow was interred in this cemetery, which was located atop the hill of the two lots. The Presbyterian church was built near the corner of West Gravel Lane and South High Streets between 1812 and 1816. The Old Presbyterian Cemetery fell into neglect by the late 19th century and was destroyed around 1940 when the hill on which it was located was cut away and leveled for the construction of a factory. Although some human remains and headstones were relocated to Indian Mound Cemetery, Wodrow's remains were likely lost during the destruction of the cemetery.  Architecture  The Wilson‚ÄìWodrow‚ÄìMytinger House is a complex composed of three independent structures varying in size, type of construction, building orientation, and purpose. Architectural historian S. Allen Chambers characterized the Wilson‚ÄìWodrow‚ÄìMytinger House complex as, \\"a charmingly informal assemblage\\" and \\"wonderfully forthright.\\" The three component structures were built between the 1740s and the 1780s, and consist of the one and one-half-story kitchen structure (c. 1750), the one and one-half-story residential structure, and the two and one-half-story clerk's office (1780s). The kitchen structure is the rear (northern) component of the Wilson‚ÄìWodrow‚ÄìMytinger House, the residential structure is the middle component, and the clerk's office is located to the front (southern end) of the property along West Gravel Lane. All three structures are positioned in close proximity to one other and have been connected by a series of one-story porches throughout the majority of their existence, which has facilitated their use as a single building. According to West Virginia Antiquities Commission research assistant Phillip R. Pitts and historian James E. Harding, the Wilson‚ÄìWodrow‚ÄìMytinger House represents \\"a sophistication in building style and design that was unusual, if not unique, in the frontier environment of the area during the second half of the eighteenth century.\\" Pitts and Harding further stated that the architecture of the three contributing structures is \\"representative of a time period spanning much of the early history and development of Romney and what is now eastern West Virginia.\\"  Kitchen structure (c. 1750)  alt=A one and one-half-story white wooden building The rear (northern) structure contributing to the Wilson‚ÄìWodrow‚ÄìMytinger House dates from around 1750, and is thought to be the oldest extant building on the property and in Romney. It is assessed to have been utilized as a kitchen throughout the majority of its existence. The kitchen structure is one and one-half stories in height and measures by . It is constructed of hand-hewn logs, its exterior is sheathed in white-painted beaded weatherboard siding, and its gable roof is topped by red cedar (Juniperus virginiana) roof shingles. The kitchen structure is accessible by a single entryway situated on its southern fa√ßade, which is connected to the adjacent residential structure of the Wilson‚ÄìWodrow‚ÄìMytinger House by a covered porch. A large stone chimney dominates the kitchen structure's northern side, directly opposite the entryway on its southern side. One single six-over-three-light wooden sash window is located in the center of each of the building's long sides on the ground floor, and two four-light wooden sash windows are located in the southern gable opposite the fireplace to provide light to the upper story. An enclosed stairway provides access to the upper story and is situated opposite the fireplace side of the building. The interior walls of the kitchen structure are painted white. Between 2009 and 2014, the kitchen building's stone chimney began to crumble, and it was rebuilt using some of the original stones. In addition, the cedar shingles from the 1962 restoration were replaced in December 2019.  Residential structure  The residential structure or \\"the dwelling\\" of the Wilson‚ÄìWodrow‚ÄìMytinger House is located immediately in front of the rear kitchen structure. The residential structure is one and one-half stories in height and measures by . It is built of frame construction with brick nogging, and its exterior is sheathed in white-painted beaded weatherboard siding. The structure is topped by a gable roof. Its exterior is symmetrically arranged, with the exception of the prominent double brick chimneys situated on its western side, which are connected by a pent on the ground floor. Central entryways are positioned on both the rear (northern) and front (southern) fa√ßades, with six-over-six-light wooden sash windows positioned on either side of each respective doorway. The upper level of the residential structure is illuminated by wooden sash windows located in both its east and west gables. The two windows on the western gable with the double chimneys are small four- light wooden sash windows, and the two windows on the eastern gable are six- over-six-light wooden sash windows. alt=A one and one-half-story white wooden building with double brick chimneys. The residential structure consists of four rooms: two traversing the ground level lengthwise and two traversing the upper level lengthwise. The front room on both the ground and upper levels is long and narrow in shape. The double chimneys on the structure's western side allow for fireplaces in each of the four rooms. The western fireplace walls in each of the four rooms are enveloped by raised wooden panelling. West Virginia Antiquities Commission research assistant Phillip R. Pitts and historian James E. Harding stated that the raised-panel fireplace walls \\"give the building a far more residential quality than the log structure behind it.\\" The raised panelling of the western walls is modest in design and includes a pent closet flanking the left side of the segmental-arched fireplace opening in each of the four rooms. A bolection molding frames the segmental-arched fireplace opening, however, there is no mantel shelf. A simple cornice with a cavetto molding runs the length of the raised panelling. With the exception of the fireplace wall, the interior walls of the ground floor rooms are made of painted plaster and the second floor rooms' walls are made of painted flush boards. The structure's upper level is accessed by an enclosed stairway along the eastern wall of the larger rear rooms opposite the paneled fireplace walls. According to Pitts and Harding, the architectural style and construction pattern of the residential structure were similar to buildings in Tidewater Maryland built in a period before 1730. They averred that regardless of the structure's origin, it would have been \\"an expensive and pretentious structure\\" for the Romney area during that period of time. The half-timber construction with brick nogging, the Wilson‚ÄìWodrow‚ÄìMytinger Housedouble brick chimneys with a connecting pent, and the medieval floor plan are features generally not associated with present-day West Virginia. The residential structure was possibly constructed for Lord Fairfax or his land agent. However, it is not known whether the kitchen structure was a preexisting pioneer home or a contemporary kitchen. Pitts and Harding theorized that if Lord Fairfax constructed the residential structure, he did so \\"to encourage development of the area by emphasizing that the Indian menace had abated and the location was suitable to a settled and prosperous existence.\\"  Clerk's office (1780s)  The largest and most imposing structure contributing to the Wilson‚ÄìWodrow‚ÄìMytinger House complex is the two and one-half-story \\"clerk's office.\\" This building is the oldest extant public office building in the state of West Virginia. It is built of wooden frame construction and measures by , with its southern gable facing perpendicular toward Gravel Lane and its main entryway positioned on the structure's western (front) elevation. Both the front (western) and rear (eastern) fa√ßades are three bays wide, with nine- over-nine-light wooden sash windows in the ground floor bays, and six-over- six-light wooden sash windows in the second floor bays. The symmetry of the front fa√ßade's windows is interrupted with the placement of the main entryway in the most southern of the three bays, which is spaced slightly further to the right of the above bay. The structure's main fa√ßade is adjoined with a one-story shed-roofed porch supported by chamfered wooden columns. On the structure's eastern fa√ßade, the six bays are symmetrically placed with three six-over-six-light wooden sash windows on the second story and three nine- over-nine-light wooden sash windows on the ground floor. alt=A two-story white wooden house viewed from the street According to Pitts and Harding, the placement of the window bays and the front entryway bay are \\"a rather sophisticated indication of the interior room arrangement.\\" Each of the structure's floors is divided between a large room and a narrow stair hall (in a side-hall plan), which connects the two stories by an open dog-leg stairway. The large room on each floor has a paneled fireplace wall on its northern end. On the first floor of the clerk's office, the segmental-arched fireplace opening is bordered by a single crossette architrave. Pitts and Harding describe the wooden panelling on the fireplace wall as being \\"exceptional.\\" The fireplace mantel's shelf support exhibits moldings identical to the cornice, including a \\"wall of Troy\\" motif. The fireplace wall is separated into three sections by fluted pilasters; the sections consist of the segmental-arched fireplace with mantelpiece and the end segments of raised wooden panelling on either side of the fireplace. On the second floor, the wooden panelling is more simple in design, and the fireplace wall is divided into three segments with raised wooden panels. The fireplace wall is only adorned with a mantelpiece containing a \\"wall of Troy\\" motif and a cornice with dentils. All other interior walls within the clerk's office structure are painted plaster.  Old log house  The Wilson‚ÄìWodrow‚ÄìMytinger House property formerly contained an old log house where George Washington purportedly stayed in 1770 during his final visit to Romney. The house stood at the northeastern corner of Lot Number 48 until it was demolished in 1932.

Its name comes from the 1927 novel Steppenwolf by Hermann Hesse which original member Rick Argosh was reading during the company's inaugural production, And Miss Reardon Drinks a Little, in January 1974. History The name Steppenwolf Theatre Company was first used in 1974 at a Unitarian church on Half Day Road in Deerfield The company presented And Miss Reardon Drinks a Little by Paul Zindel, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead by Tom Stoppard, and The Glass Menagerie by Tennessee Williams, with Rick Argosh directing, and Grease by Jim Jacobs and Warren Casey, with Gary Sinise directing. The founding members are Terry Kinney, Jeff Perry, and Gary Sinise. The founders recruited six additional members: H.E. Baccus, Nancy Evans, Moira Harris, John Malkovich, Laurie Metcalf, and Alan Wilder. In 1975, Steppenwolf incorporated as a nonprofit organization, saving money by taking the name of a failed theater company that had already incorporated.https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/21/magazine/laurie- metcalf-lady-bird-roseanne.html In the summer of 1976, Steppenwolf took up residence in a vacant basement space of the Immaculate Conception Catholic Church in Highland Park, Illinois and produced its first full season of plays. In 1980, the theater company moved into a 134-seat theater at the Jane Addams Hull House Center on Broadway Avenue in Chicago. Two years later, the company moved to a 211-seat facility at 2851 N. Halsted Street, which was their home until 1991, when construction was completed on the current theater complex at 1650 N. Halsted Street (with administrative offices at 1700 N. Halsted Street.) The theatre has three theatres: the Downstairs Theatre that seats 515; the Upstairs Theatre that seats 299; and, the 1700 Theatre a casual, intimate and flexible theatre that seats 80.Theatres - Steppenwolf website In 1982, the Sam Shepard play True West, starring Sinise and John Malkovich, was the first of many Steppenwolf productions to travel to New York City. In 1994, the company made its Los Angeles debut with Steve Martin's first play, Picasso at the Lapin Agile. In 1996, after successful runs in Chicago and New York, Lyle Kessler's Orphans, directed by Gary Sinise, was the first Steppenwolf production to go international, debuting in London. The MacArthur Foundation awarded Steppenwolf Theatre Company $2.26 million between 1978 and 2017, in support of general operations, and growth of artistic and educational programs.

In 2000 Steppenwolf presented the world premiere of Austin Pendleton's Orson's Shadow, which subsequently was staged off-Broadway and by regional theatres throughout the country. Tracy Letts' Broadway drama August: Osage County (2007) was ranked number one in Time's Top Ten Theatre Performances of 2007. After moving from the Imperial Theatre next door to The Music Box Theatre for an open-ended run, August: Osage County won five Tony Awards including Best Play of 2007, Best Director (Anna D.

It is the preeminent association in the field, and publishes a journal, Transactions of the American Philological Association (TAPA). The APA is currently based at the University of Pennsylvania, in Philadelphia. History The APA was inaugurated by William D. Whitney, of Yale, at Poughkeepsie, New York, in 1869 as an outgrowth of the Classical Section of the Oriental Society. Of the 151 inaugural members, just 8 were women, including Alice Robinson Boise Wood, the first woman to study (informally) at the University of Michigan and to graduate with a B.A. from the Old University of Chicago. Originally its members studied a great variety of texts and languages, but as disciplines such as linguistics and modern languages have created their own societies, the APA came to be concerned with classical antiquity and fields closely related to the study of antiquity, while the definition of \\"philology\\" broadened to include many approaches to understanding the ancient world. Convention The Society holds its annual convention in January, meeting jointly with the Archaeological Institute of America. About 400 scholarly papers are delivered at the Society's meeting, which is also the site for interviewing for college and university positions and for the meetings of the many committees and affiliated groups. It is also the occasion for the presentation of Society awards for teaching at both pre- collegiate and collegiate level, for projects that bring classics to a wider public (outreach), and of the Goodwin Award of Merit, which recognizes a recently published book. At every meeting, an Outreach Division conducts two events that are open to the general public. One is a special panel that is of interest to non-specialists. Topics have included the movie Troy, Classics and Contemporary Fiction and the HBO series Rome and Classics and Comics. The second is the staged reading of a classical or classically themed play, by the Committee on Ancient and Modern Performance. The productions have been: The Invention of Love (Tom Stoppard, directed by Mary-Kay Gamel, produced by Judith Hallett), The Heavensgate Deposition (based on Apocolocyntosis by Seneca the Younger, adapted by Douglass Parker, directed by Amy R. Cohen, produced by Thomas Jenkins), The Golden Age (by Thomas Heywood, directed by C. W. Marshall), Iran Man (based on Persa by Plautus, directed by Mary-Kay Gamel), Thespis (by W. S. Gilbert and A. S. Sullivan, with new music by Alan Riley Jones, directed by John Starks, produced by John Given), The Birds (by Aristophanes, directed by Thomas Talboy), Cyclops (by Euripides, directed by Laura Lippman and Mike Lippman), Thersites (perhaps by Nicholas Udall, directed by C. W. Marshall), Thesmophoriazusae (by Aristophanes, directed by Bella Vivante), The Jurymen (by Katherine Janson, directed by Amy R. Cohen) and Alcestis (by Euripides, translated by Mary-Kay Gamel, directed by Gamel and Mark Damen). Activities Through its divisions of Research, Education, Publications, Professional Matters, and Program, the Society conducts a variety of activities to support and disseminate knowledge of the ancient Greek and Roman worlds. For example, it operates a Placement Service, gathers statistical information about the demographics of classicists, hears complaints of violations of professional ethics, provides advice and funding for major research projects (such as the Barrington Atlas of the Greek and Roman World), and publishes monographs, textbooks and software. The Outreach Division produces a newsletter, Amphora, for non-specialists, and the electronic newsletter The Dionysiac, which gives information about performances of classical plays and other events related to ancient performance. Scholars Many notable scholars served as executives of the APA, including Basil Lanneau Gildersleeve, William Watson Goodwin, Herbert Weir Smyth, Paul Shorey, Lily Ross Taylor, Berthold Ullman, Thomas Robert Shannon Broughton, Gerald Else, Helen F. North, Bernard Knox, Charles Segal, and Emily Vermeule. Change of Name In 2013 the American Philological Association elected to change its name to the Society for Classical Studies.

It was originally released in 1999 for Microsoft Windows and PlayStation, and is now also available for macOS, FreeBSD, AmigaOS 4, AROS, MorphOS, Linux, NetBSD and OpenBSD. While was developed and released as a proprietary commercial video game, on December 6, 2004, the source code and most of its data was released under the GNU General Public License version 2; the rest of the data followed on June 10, 2008.  Story  In the late 21st century, the world's civilizations are wiped out by a series of nuclear strikes, seemingly caused by a massive malfunction of the new NASDA (North American Strategic Defense Agency) strategic defense system. While most of the survivors form scavenger bands to survive, the player is a member of a group named \\"The Project\\", that is more organised and seeks to rebuild civilization using pre-war technology. The game begins with The Project sending three teams (Alpha, Beta, and Gamma) to gather technology that would help with reconstruction; the player assumes command of Team Alpha in Arizona. While gathering said \\"artifacts\\", the Project fends off attacks from an organization called the New Paradigm, another major survivalist organisation, which is more advanced than the player's forces. Later however, it is discovered that a self-aware computer virus named 'Nexus' is actually controlling the New Paradigm. After the player defeats the New Paradigm, he is assigned to Team Beta, which is based in Chicago and under attack by a faction called 'The Collective'. Again, the player starts out less advanced than 'The Collective' and it is discovered that Nexus is controlling this faction too. At the end of the campaign, Nexus launches nuclear missiles at Alpha and Beta bases, prompting the player to abandon the facility and move to the Gamma base. Upon arriving at Gamma base, the player is immediately ambushed by the Gamma forces, which have already been taken over by Nexus. After the player survives the ambush and develops countermeasures to 'Nexus' infection, Nexus takes control of the remaining NASDA satellites and attempts to destroy the player. However, before he can succeed, the Project captures a NASDA missile site, and shoots down the orbiting laser weapons. It is learned that the scientist Dr. Reed, who was bankrupted by the US military, transformed himself into the Nexus virus and was responsible for the nuclear holocaust by infiltrating the 'NASDA' systems. At this point, the survivors of the Alpha and Beta bases arrive, and the three Project teams launch a full-scale assault on Nexus. The Project destroys Nexus and can begin rebuilding civilization. A base and some units in campaign mode (2019) build 3.2.3 - campaign mode (2019)  Gameplay  Videos frequently appear during gameplay. This image depicts a dropship transporting the player's forces towards the campaign's first Away mission. The game is fully 3D, based on the iViS 3D graphics engine developed by Sam Kerbeck of Eidos Interactive. The game world is mapped by a grid; vehicles tilt to meet hilly terrain, and projectiles can be realistically blocked by steep mountains or buildings. The camera is free-moving and can zoom in and out, rotate, and pan up or down while navigating the battlefield. In the game, units of different factions are painted different colors. The New Paradigm, the Collective, and Nexus are the enemies of the Project in the campaign, and they can be seen attacking Project forces as well as Scavengers, survivors of the nuclear fallout. Units can all be customized according to: chassis (which, for example, takes weight and power into account); drive system (such as wheels or tracks); and mounted object (such as a weapon, or one of various support tools). Units can earn experience. Earning experience cause units to level up from ranks such as Rookie to Trained and Professional. places an emphasis on sensors and radar to detect units and to coordinate ground attacks. Counter-battery sensors detect enemy artillery by sensing their projectiles and firing arcs and pinpointing their location to coordinate artillery strikes against enemy artillery. VTOL (Vertical Take-Off and Landing) sensors work like basic sensors, only they coordinate VTOL airstrikes. VTOL counter-battery sensors coordinate VTOLs to find and destroy enemy artillery batteries. There is an emphasis on artillery: although many direct- and close-combat weapons and anti-air weapons can be researched and deployed, artillery is a staple of assault on enemy bases and outposts. While the technology tree is clearly defined and consistent, it never appears in- game and, therefore, the player can be left guessing as to what technology is next in the tree. Technology can be acquired by gathering artifacts left behind by certain destroyed enemy structures or units. Researching is composed of largely small and incremental advancements over existing weapons, armor, and chassis types. Some levels require the player to achieve the objective within a time limit whilst some without these limits can be used to gather \\"power\\". In Away missions, the player must select a limited group of units to transport to a territory completely removed from the original base. All of the terrain throughout the campaign is essentially composed of three areas, with different sectors for Away missions and other such levels; upon progression, previous maps simply expand and the player's original bases from past levels are maintained. Also, its resource system is quite different from mainstream RTS games; Oil Derricks are established over specific, scarce locations which constantly provide a slow, fixed rate of income. Combined with a mission time limit, this resource method makes it generally infeasible for players to utilize certain traditional RTS tactics such as \\"turtling\\" (fortifying one or more bases against enemy attack, while stockpiling resources with which to produce a massive army). However, there are certain missions throughout the game that do not have a time limit, and in these missions it is possible to use more traditional RTS tactics to prepare for subsequent timed missions. mortar weapons bombard Scavenger-occupied shacks from afar. map editor (EditWorld) map editor (EditWorld)  History  was originally developed by Pumpkin Studios and published by Eidos Interactive. In 1999 it was originally released for Microsoft Windows and PlayStation. After having released patch 1.10 final in November 1999, Pumpkin Studios ended their support for Warzone 2100 at January 5, 2000. On March 15, 2000, Pumpkin Studios was closed down by Eidos Interactive. Pumpkin Studios later reformed as Pivotal Games.  End of support and fan patch  After the official support ended with the dissolution of Pumpkin Studios, a third-party group of game enthusiasts, N.E.W.S.T., tried to continue the support in October 1999. Starting in November 2000, the group released unofficial patches which fixed many of the game's remaining problems. In February 2003 Pumpkin-2, the renamed N.E.W.S.T. group, sent a petition to copyright holder Eidos Interactive, asking for permission to get and use the source code and art content.  Open sourcing  On December 6, 2004 Warzone's source code was uploaded to Radiosity's FTP server by Alex McLean of Pivotal Games. Source code and artwork (beside the movies) of Warzone were placed under the GPLv2 license, making the game free and open-source. On June 10, 2008 the license of the game was clarified; distribution of movies and soundtrack was now permitted, too.  Community driven development  Following the release, the game's community started a revival project, based on the available source code and assets: originally called \\"Warzone Re-Development Project\\", it was later renamed to the \\"Warzone 2100 Resurrection Project\\", and then to the \\"Warzone 2100 Project\\". On June 11, 2005, version 0.1 of the \\"Warzone 2100 Project\\" was released, with all proprietary technology replaced by free and open-source alternatives. As of 2020 the community development continues. On February 18, 2020 the open source community version 3.3.0 of Warzone 2100 was released on the Steam gaming platform as a completely free product. Underdone Gaming has published only a Windows version of the game, with questions about other platforms left unanswered. The reception of the community to this release is generally negative and it is unlikely that community developers will aid technical support for the Steam version.  Reception  The game's new additions to the real-time strategy genre were positively noted, such as its create-a-unit feature, persistent world, 3D environments with control over a zoomable and rotatable floating camera, variety of terrain and environments, animated units, diverse colors, night-and-day mechanic, and numerous features. GameSpot gave the PlayStation version a 6.5, and the PC version a 7.6. GameSpot praised the game for its high level of customizability and concluded, \\" highly navigable 3D engine, unique campaign structure, and multiplayer gameplay should please most real-time strategy fans.\\" IGN shared similar sentiments, rating the PC version 8.0, and the PlayStation version 7.5. IGN praised the PlayStation version for being one of the few RTS games on the system, \\"In the end the weird truth is that is one of the best RTS on the system.\\" In their PC review, the author expressed disappointment with the lack of innovation, but praised it nonetheless, \\"Mostly it boils down to taking great ideas found in other RTS titles and combining them into one. Pumpkin Studios did a fantastic job with that task and this one is certainly worth playing all the way through.\\" GameRevolution noted problems in the presentation, such as the \\"uninspiring\\" audio and \\"fuzzy graphics,\\" and the lack of being able to save during gameplay. The Playstation port was criticized for keeping the interface of the PC version, which was unsuitable for the Playstation controller.

They took their name from the 1974 TV movie, directed by Jerry London, itself based on a Theodore Sturgeon short story. They released their first album, Intellectuals are the Shoeshine Boys of the Ruling Elite, in the same year. The band split in 1990 but reformed in 1993, losing guitarist Bill Hobson and gaining Paul Zagoras, and continued until they split up in 1996. Their farewell tour was officially titled \\"Fuck You, We Quit!\\", and included Erik Tunison of Die Kreuzen in place of Dan Hobson on drums and Jeff Ditzenberger on additional guitar. The band released nine albums, including a post-breakup live CD, The Last Waltz. Killdozer was notable for its slow, grinding song structures and blackly humorous lyrics, growled ominously by singer/guitarist Michael Gerald at the top of his lungs. Many of their songs were disturbing narratives of small-town life gone awry, and later had a jaded, left-wing political perspective. Killdozer is regarded by many to have helped set the foundation for grunge music, despite that genre's association with the city of Seattle. The band also became famous for its cover songs, an example being Don McLean's \\"American Pie\\". A version exists on their 1989 all-covers album For Ladies Only. Gerald also did a cover of Jessi Colter's \\"I'm Not Lisa\\" for the band's 1986 EP Burl, dedicated \\"in loving memory of\\" the then-living Burl Ives. The EP in its entirety can be found on the CD version of their 1994 album Uncompromising War on Art Under the Dictatorship of the Proletariat. History The band recorded under the Touch and Go Records label during the 1980s and 1990s and they often toured with or played alongside label mates such as Butthole Surfers, Scratch Acid and Big Black. The band frequently recorded with producer and fellow Madisonian Butch Vig. Steve Albini (Big Black) recorded Killdozer's 1995 album God Hears Pleas of the Innocent. Twelve Point Buck was the album that brought Butch Vig to the attention of Kurt Cobain and Billy Corgan. Michael Gerald Killdozer played with all original members at Touch and Go Records' 25th anniversary celebration in Chicago, Illinois on September 9, 2006. To promote the event, flyers declared \\"Fuck You, We Reunite!\\", harkening back to the name of their farewell tour (\\"Fuck You, We Quit!\\"). Subsequently, in response to the audience at the concert \\"pleading for more Killdozer\\", Touch and Go announced a handful of U.S. tour dates for the fall of 2008. Meanwhile, drummer Dan Hobson has remained active in the Madison music scene, playing in several bands, including Cement Pond with Tim Sullivan (of Drug Induced Nightmare No. 4) on guitar, Steve Burke (of The Gomers) on guitar and vocals, and Gordon Ranney (also of The Gomers) on bass and vocals. The group has released one album entitled Vanilla Guerilla on the independent Corporate Hell Inc. record label in 2005. Michael Gerald is a lawyer in Los Angeles, California. In 2007, he lent his voice to the New Jersey band Hunchback, for their cover of the Christina Aguilera hit \\"Beautiful\\", released on their album Pray For Scars (Don Giovanni Records, 2008). Bill Hobson is a grip in the Los Angeles area. A 28-track double-disc tribute album, We Will Bury You, was released in 2006 by indie labels -ismist Recordings and Crustacean Records.

A comic book adaptation appeared the same year, in Marvel Comics' Worlds Unknown #6 (April 1974). The film has since gained a cult following. Plot A meteorite crashes onto the Earth's surface on an island off the coast of Africa. Countless years later, after natural forces have buried it and restored the local environment, six construction workers are boated to the island to begin work building an airstrip for an oil drilling company at the crash site on the uninhabited island. Foreman Kelly (Clint Walker) and bulldozer driver Mack (Robert Urich) uncover the meteorite (though they do not know what it is), which emits a strange sound. When the bulldozer (a Caterpillar D9 in the movie, a Caterpillar D7 in the novella) is used to try to shift the meteorite, it emits a blue light that moves to, and seems to possess, the bulldozer. Mack, standing nearby as this occurs, falls ill and then dies some hours later. Chub (Neville Brand), the team's mechanic, cannot find anything wrong with the inoperative bulldozer, but can hear the odd sound from the blade. Kelly orders that the bulldozer not be used. Beltran (James A. Watson, Jr.) ignores the prohibition and starts the bulldozer, bringing it to malevolent life. It destroys the camp's only two-way radio and begins a rampage, killing the workers one by one. It seems to run indefinitely in spite of a limited fuel capacity. The machine has some rudimentary intelligence and guile and hunts down the men. The crew is soon reduced to just Kelly and Dennis (Carl Betz). Running out of options, with the expected relief crew not due to arrive just yet, they amuse themselves by convicting the bulldozer of murder, then consider methods of \\"execution\\": too heavy to hang, too big for the gas chamber...until they realize it might be able to be electrocuted. They lure it to a trap consisting of steel Marston Matting (used for constructing temporary runways during World War II) connected to a generator. As the bulldozer is electrified, the alien entity emerges as an aura around the machine, then finally fades. The men shut down the power and check the blade: no sound. Though Kelly realizes his story will not be believed as he is a recovering alcoholic, and this job was his last chance to redeem himself, he intends to tell the truth. Cast *Clint Walker as Lloyd Kelly *Carl Betz as Dennis Holvig *Neville Brand as Chub Foster *James Wainwright as Dutch Krasner *James A. Watson, Jr. as Al Beltran *Robert Urich as Mack McCarthy Release=Home media Killdozer! was released for the first time on DVD by Willette Acquisition Corporation on July 1, 2014. Reception Killdozer! received mostly negative reviews upon its release, with criticism directed towards the film's 'outlandish' premise. Charleston Picou from HorrorNews.net gave the film a mixed review, writing, \\"While the movie itself is well made for a ‚Äò70s TV flick, with decent acting and directing, it‚Äôs ultimately undone by the overall ridiculousness. The titular killdozer is never really that frightening and is sometimes kind of silly looking.\\" Regardless, Picou stated the film 'still manages to be entertaining'. Jon Condit from Dread Central panned the film, awarding the film a score of 0.5 out of 5. In his review, Condit criticized the film's ridiculous premise, sluggish pace, \\"one-dimensional\\" characters, and overall lack of suspense. Andrew Smith from the British film review website Popcorn Pictures gave the film an abysmal score of 0 out of 10, writing, \\"Killdozer is dreadful fare which should have been left to rust on the seventies scrap heap. It‚Äôs hard trying to find positives to say about it. Even its short running time drags out for an eternity.\\" However, not all reviews for the film were negative. The Terror Trap rated the film a score of 2.5 out of 4 stars, stating that the film \\"comes off fairly well thanks to its straightforward, sci-fi approach\\", while also noting its strange premise. The rock band Killdozer was named after the film. Legacy In spite of receiving largely negative reviews from both critics and audience members, Killdozer! has acquired a cult following over the years and is now considered a cult classic.

As of March 2016, it has an average weekday circulation of 134,537 and Sunday circulation of 253,261. In 2016 its website received roughly six million monthly unique visitors generating more than 13 million page views, according to comScore. Ownership The Post was the flagship newspaper of MediaNews Group Inc., founded in 1983 by William Dean Singleton and Richard Scudder. MediaNews is today one of the nation's largest newspaper chains, publisher of 61 daily newspapers and more than 120 non-daily publications in 13 states. MediaNews bought The Denver Post from the Times Mirror Co. on December 1, 1987. Times Mirror had bought the paper from the heirs of founder Frederick Gilmer Bonfils in 1980. Since 2010, The Denver Post has been owned by hedge fund Alden Global Capital, which acquired its bankrupt parent company, MediaNews Group. In April 2018, a group called \\"Together for Colorado Springs\\" said that it was raising money to buy the Post from Alden Global Capital, stating: ‚ÄúDenver deserves a newspaper owner who supports its newsroom.‚Äù History The newspaper's former building & newsroom in downtown Denver In August 1892, The Evening Post was founded by supporters of Grover Cleveland with $50,000. It was a Democratic paper used to publicize political ideals and stem the number of Colorado Democrats leaving the party. Cleveland had been nominated for president because of his reputation for honest government. However, Cleveland and eastern Democrats opposed government purchase of silver, Colorado's most important product, which made Cleveland unpopular in the state. Following the bust of silver prices in 1893, the country and Colorado went into a depression and The Evening Post suspended publication in August 1893. A new group of owners with similar political ambitions raised $100,000 and resurrected the paper in June 1894. On October 28, 1895, Harry Heye Tammen, former bartender and owner of a curio and souvenir shop, and Frederick Gilmer Bonfils, a Kansas City real estate and lottery operator, purchased the Evening Post for $12,500. Neither had newspaper experience, but they were adept at the business of promotion and finding out what people wanted to read. Through the use of sensationalism, editorialism, and \\"flamboyant circus journalism\\", a new era began for the Post. Circulation grew and eventually passed the other three daily papers combined. On November 3, 1895 the paper's was name changed to Denver Evening Post. On January 1, 1901 the word \\"Evening\\" was dropped from the name and the paper became The Denver Post.  20th and early 21st centuries  Among well-known Post reporters were Gene Fowler, Frances Belford Wayne, and \\"sob sister\\" Polly Pry. Damon Runyon worked briefly for the Post in 1905-1906 before gaining fame as a writer in New York. After the deaths of Tammen and Bonfils in 1924 and 1933, Helen and May Bonfils, Bonfils' daughters, became the principal owners of the Post. In 1946, the Post hired Palmer Hoyt away from the Portland Oregonian to become editor and publisher of the Post and to give the paper a new direction. With Hoyt in charge, news was reported fairly and accurately. He took editorial comment out of the stories and put it on an editorial page. He called the page The Open Forum and it continues today. In 1960, there was a takeover attempt by publishing mogul Samuel I. Newhouse. Helen Bonfils brought in her friend and lawyer Donald Seawell to save the paper. The fight led to a series of lawsuits as Post management struggled to maintain local ownership. It lasted 13 years and drained the paper financially. When Helen Bonfils died in 1972, Seawell was named president and chairman of the board. He was also head of the Denver Center for the Performing Arts (DCPA). The Center was established and financed primarily by the Frederick G. and Helen G. Bonfils foundations, with aid from city funds. The majority of the assets of the foundations came from Post stock dividends. By 1980, the paper was losing money. Critics accused Seawell of being preoccupied with building up the DCPA. Seawell sold the Post to the Times Mirror Co. of California for $95 million. Proceeds went to the Bonfils Foundation, securing the financial future of the DCPA. Times Mirror started morning publication and delivery. Circulation improved, but the paper did not perform as well as required. Times Mirror sold The Denver Post to Dean Singleton and MediaNews Group in 1987. In January 2001, MediaNews and E.W. Scripps, parent company of the now defunct Rocky Mountain News, entered into a joint operating agreement (JOA), creating the Denver Newspaper Agency, which combined the business operations of the former rivals. Under the agreement, the newsrooms of the two newspapers agreed to publish separate morning editions Monday through Friday, with the Post retaining a broadsheet format and the News using a tabloid format. They published a joint broadsheet newspaper on Saturday, produced by the News staff, and a broadsheet on Sunday, produced by the Post staff. Both newspapers' editorial pages appeared in both weekend papers. The JOA ended on February 27, 2009, when the Rocky Mountain News published its last issue. The following day, the Post published its first Saturday issue since 2001. The Post launched a staff expansion program in 2001, but declining advertising revenue led to a reduction of the newsroom staff in 2006 and 2007 through layoffs, early-retirement packages, voluntary- separation buyouts and attrition. The most recent round of announced buyouts occurred in June 2016. In 2013, just before legalization in Colorado, The Denver Post initiated an online media brand ' to cover cannabis-related issues. First led by Editor in Chief Ricardo Baca, the online publication has surged in popularity, beating the industry veteran High Times in September 2016. Thirty layoffs were announced for The Post in March 2018, according to the Denver Business Journal.  Management by Digital First Media  On September 7, 2011, John Paton ‚Äì the CEO of Journal Register Company ‚Äì was appointed CEO of MediaNews Group, replacing Singleton, who stayed on as the Posts publisher and CEO of MediaNews until his retirement in 2013. He remains non-executive chairman of the organization. With the move, the Post also entered into an agreement with the newly created Digital First Media, led by Paton, that would provide management services and lead the execution of the company's business strategy in conjunction with Journal Register. Paton stepped down as CEO of Digital First in June 2015, and was succeeded by longtime MediaNews executive Steve Rossi. In the same announcement, the company said that it would no longer be seeking a sale. In 2017, The Denver Post announced that its headquarters were moving to its printing plant in North Washington, Adams County. Newsroom cuts & criticism The operation of The Denver Post by Digital First Media, under the ownership of Alden Global Capital, has come under extensive criticism from workers at the newspaper and outside the organization. The hedge fund has made \\"relentless cost cuts\\" since taking ownership in 2010, despite the reported profitability of the Post, principally by laying off the newspaper's staff. Margaret Sullivan of The Washington Post called Alden Global Capital \\"one of the most ruthless of the corporate strip-miners seemingly intent on destroying local journalism.\\" Under Digital Media First, the number of journalists in the newsroom was reduced by almost two-thirds by April 2018, to around 70 people. This represents a drastic fall from the over 250 journalists which The Denver Post employed before 2010, when it was purchased by Alden Media Group. At one point before 2009, the joint-operating agreement between The Denver Post and The Rocky Mountain News boasted a 600-strong staff of journalists, before the bankruptcy of the Rocky Mountain News that year. The announcement of 30 more layoffs in March 2018, which reduced the paper's newsroom from 100 to around 70 people, prompted a denunciation of its owners from the editorial board of The Denver Post. The editorial decried Alden Global Capital as \\"vulture capitalists\\" who were \\"strip-mining\\" the newspaper; it concluded that \\"Denver deserves a newspaper owner who supports its newsroom. If Alden isn't willing to do good journalism here, it should sell the Post to owners who will.\\" The editorial board pointed out that the cuts were hamstringing the ability of the Post to provide quality coverage of the fast-growing Denver region, and compared the size of its newsroom unfavorably to those of other newspapers in cities of comparable or smaller size to Denver. Alden's \\"harvesting strategy\\" is what prompted Greg Moore, editor of The Denver Post from 2002 to 2016, to step down. The \\"open revolt\\" of the Denver Post against its owners garnered support and praise from other newspapers and journalists, including Mitchell Landsberg of the Los Angeles Times and Joe Nocera of Bloomberg View.

Controversies In February 2014, The Denver Post began publishing a section entitled \\"Energy and Environment\\", funded by Coloradans for Responsible Energy Development (CRED), a pro‚Äìnatural gas group. The stories in the section are written by outsiders, not by DP reporters. A banner across the top of the section reads \\"This Section is Sponsored by CRED\\". Nevertheless, critics express concern that the section risks confusing readers about the distinction between advertising and reporting. Another controversy arose in late January 2020, when Jon Caldara of the Denver-based Independence Institute, who had long written a weekly column for the Denver Post, was fired after publishing two conservative articles on sex and gender. In a column arguing for greater openness in public affairs, excoriating the Colorado legislature for avoiding the legally required referendum on a new state tax by repackaging it as a ‚Äúfee‚Äù ‚Äî and then prohibiting hospitals from listing the fee on patients‚Äô bills. On the same theme, he criticized the state‚Äôs educational authorities for imposing a speech code forbidding speech considered ‚Äústigmatizing‚Äù. ‚ÄúIn case you hadn‚Äôt noticed,‚Äù he wrote, ‚Äújust about everything is stigmatizing to the easily triggered, perpetually offended.‚Äù Continuing on his theme of transparency, he also complained that the schools were not doing enough to make parents aware of the contents of their sex-ed curricula. While Caldara believes his \\"insistence\\" on the existence of only two sexes was \\"the last straw\\" for his column, he emphasizes \\"the reason for my firing is over a difference in style.\\" He was officially fired for failing to use \\"respectful language\\" and the lack of a \\"collaborative and professional manner.\\"  See also  * * References * History of Denver, by Jerome C.

The train was considered an \\"important character\\" by the show's producers, and producer Paul Henning hired railroad historian Gerald M. Best to make sure that the locomotive sounds used on the show were authentic to a train of the same type and age. The 1890s-style train with a whimsical schedule gave the otherwise fanciful show a degree of authenticity; Henning said that \\"the train's weekly appearances on TV might set the space age back 50 years and drive train buffs insane with delight, but without it our show would lose its character image.\\" Later, Henning admitted, \\"When I started Petticoat Junction, I had one aim. If people thought to themselves, 'Gee, I'd like to spend a few days at that beat-up hotel' or 'I'd like to ride that funny little railroad,' I knew we would make it.\\"  Petticoat Junction  The most unusual \\"character\\" in the Petticoat Junction cast is the Hooterville Cannonball, an abbreviated 1890s vintage train consisting of a steam locomotive and a single combination car (with a baggage and passenger section). The train is operated more like a taxi service by engineer Charley Pratt (Smiley Burnette) and fireman/conductor Floyd Smoot (Rufe Davis). It operates on a long forgotten spur between Hooterville and Pixley that was disconnected from the railway's main line after the demolition of a trestle twenty years before the start of the series. It is not uncommon for the Cannonball to make an unscheduled stop in order to go fishing or to pick fruit for Kate Bradley's menu at the Shady Rest Hotel. Occasionally, Betty Jo Bradley can be found with her hand on the Cannonball's throttle, as running the train home from trips into town is one of her favorite pastimes. With cast changes, Smiley Burnette's death at the end of Season 4 was the basis for writing Charley's death into the story line in Season 5 and having Floyd run the train alone as engineer/conductor. He was replaced in Season 6 by Byron Foulger as Wendell Gibbs. Due to Mr. Foulger's failing health, the train engineer was no longer a main character in most episodes of Season 7. However, Rufe Davis appeared as Floyd in two guest appearances, and was addressed once off-screen as an invisible character. J. Homer Bedloe (played by Charles Lane) is vice president of the C&FW; Railroad, the owner of the Cannonball. Bedloe is a mean-spirited executive, and he periodically visits the Shady Rest Hotel and attempts to end the train service of the Hooterville Cannonball (and never succeeds). In Episode 31 of Season 1, \\"Charley Abandons The Cannonball,\\" engineer Charley Pratt picks up his guitar and sings an ode to the train. The lyrics are sung roughly to the tune of \\"Wabash Cannonball\\".  Production  Henning said that the train was based on his memories of growing up in Independence, MO, which was serviced by the Air Line Railroad: \\"Every morning, the little old wood-burning train chugged into town. Every afternoon, it chugged out. Where did it go? We weren't quite sure, but we dreamed about climbing aboard some day, in search of adventure. Its low, mournful whistle was a siren song.\\" Two Hooterville Cannonball trains used were for filming. The working model was the Sierra No. 3 locomotive, and it was used to film all the exterior \\"long shots\\", including the show's opening and closing credits. ‚Äî via ProQuest The train was built in 1923 by the Bingham-Willamette Company of Portland, Oregon. ‚Äî via ProQuest This locomotive is still operational at Railtown 1897 State Historic Park in California, after a complete restoration that was finished in 2010.\\"Railtown 1897 in Jamestown Resumes Steam Train Rides Behind Historic Sierra No. 3 Beginning on Saturday, April 4\\" Sierra Sun Times March 11, 2015 retrieved October 25, 2015 Clint Eastwood was part of a fundraiser for the restoration. He was familiar with the Sierra No. 3 from his days on the western television show Rawhide, and he used it in his films Pale Rider and Unforgiven. A full-scale prop locomotive was used for studio sound stage scenes. It was built in 1950 by 20th Century Fox for a movie called A Ticket to Tomahawk, starring Dan Dailey, Walter Brennan, Rory Calhoun and Marilyn Monroe. Built of wood, fiberglass and metal, it was a replica of a Rio Grande Southern #20, which starred in the film as a fictional locomotive called the Emma Sweeny (the Emma Sweeny is actually referenced in the fourth episode of the show when a spare part is needed to repair the Cannonball). RGS #20 was used for scenes in the film when the locomotive ran normally on the track, and the model was used for the scenes where it was off the track and being pulled by mules. The original 1950 cost of the elaborate studio mock-up was $40,000. Later in the 1950s, Fox sold the locomotive replica to Harvey Dick, who used it for the d√©cor of the Barbary Coast Lounge in the lobby of his Hoyt Hotel, an 1890s style gas-light hotel in Portland, Oregon.LaMarche, Bill \\"Petticoat Junction\\" star Linda Kaye Henning to Attend Oregon Zoo's Train Party\\" May 30, 2009 retrieved October 8, 2015 Harvey Dick loaned the replica to the producers of Petticoat Junction in exchange for the prominent screen credit seen at the end of each episode, \\"Train furnished by Barbary Coast, Hoyt Hotel, Portland, Oregon\\". It was also used in the show The Wild Wild West for scenes of the engine and tender. The model can easily be distinguished on screen from Sierra #3 by its driving wheels - the model has evenly spaced driving wheels, like RGS #20, while Sierra #3 has a large gap between the second and third driver axles. The model is also considerably smaller than Sierra #3, since RGS #20 is a narrow gauge locomotive. In the 1970s, the locomotive replica was purchased by Sacramento restaurateur/collector Sam Gordon. Gordon displayed it in the parking lot of his Sam's Stage Coach Inn (Sam's Town) along Highway 50 in Cameron Park, California, about 30 miles east of Sacramento. The replica fell into disrepair. In 1979, it was purchased by John Queirolo and Rick Stevenson, who later gave it to the Amador County Museum in Jackson, California, where it was restored and displayed. In August 2011, the Amador County museum sold the locomotive replica to the Durango Railroad Historical Society in Durango, Colorado, which planned to restore it to its original state as the Emma Sweeny.

History In 1980, airline industry entrepreneur Frank Lorenzo created a holding company for his Texas International Airlines called Texas Air Corporation. In the autumn of 1980, Texas Air created a new airline called New York Air (NYA), the second of America's post-deregulation airlines after Midway Airlines, which had been founded a year earlier in 1979 (see Airline Deregulation Act of 1978). Based at New York's LaGuardia Airport, New York Air challenged the expensive and near-monopoly Eastern Air Lines Shuttle, and provided cheaper and equally frequent (hourly) flights between New York, Boston and Washington National Airport. DC-9-32 of New York Air Founding New York Air president, Neal F. Meehan, had been a senior manager at both Continental Airlines and at Texas International Airlines (TI). In September, 1980, he assembled a team of airline managers; within 90 days it had hired, trained, uniformed, and drilled New York Air's flight crew, flight attendants, dispatchers, terminal, ramp and reservations personnel. Office and maintenance facilities in the hangar which had originally housed American Airlines headquarters at LaGuardia in the 1930s were thrown up rapidly, and the carrier obtained FAA certification as an adjunct to TI's certificate. In one notable vignette, New York Air managers interviewed over a thousand candidates for flight attendant, reservations, and airport jobs in one day of group interviews held at New York's famed Town Hall Theater, in November 1980. The Airline Pilots Association (ALPA) pilots' union fought New York Air vigorously, running picket lines at LaGuardia and Washington National and taking out critical ads in the New York newspapers. Suspected acts of vandalism, interference, and prohibited aircrew operations were also reported by New York Air flight crews and managers. New York Air's representatives to the Airline Scheduling Committees (CAB-authorized committees of airline representatives that allocated takeoff and landing slots at capacity-controlled airports in New York, Washington, and Chicago) were stonewalled for months as they sought to get the necessary 'slots' for New York Air to operate their shuttle services between New York, Washington, and Boston. Eventually, however, the airline succeeded in overcoming all obstacles. New York Air service commenced on 19 December 1980 with shuttle operations between New York LaGuardia, Washington National, and Boston Logan airports. A moribund U.S. economy and the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization (PATCO) strike badly hurt New York Air's first 15 months of operation. The strike particularly affected the New York, Boston, and Washington, the airports where NYA operated the majority of their flights. Passenger traffic began to build substantially in 1982 after President Ronald Reagan intervened against PATCO strikers, and the U.S. economy began to recover. A new CEO, Michael E. Levine, was brought aboard in 1982 to restructure the airline. Levine first shrunk NYA, then doubled it in size by 1984 at which time NYA was solidly profitable. Levine left NYA in the spring of 1984. At its operational peak, New York Air employed over 2,000 people before Texas Air combined NYA and other airlines they owned with Continental Airlines on February 1, 1987. The New York Air image and livery disappeared as NYA was integrated into Continental mainline operations during 1987, consolidating their New York operations to Newark-Liberty and moving their DC-9s and MD-80s to other hubs, including PTI (Piedmont Triad International Airport). New York Air was well known for its onboard bagged snacks, known as \\"The Flying Nosh.\\" New York Air Connection By 1986, Beechcraft Model 99's, Beech 1900s, and Shorts 330s aircraft were operating upon regional routes feeding New York Air as New York Air Connection. These flights were conducted by the original Colgan Air, prior to their merger with Presidential Airways. The aircraft were completely painted in the New York Air aircraft livery but with the word Connection applied next to the mainline's brand name.

It was held at the University of Massachusetts Boston in Boston, Massachusetts in the United States from July 23-25, 2004, and coordinated by the Boston-based labor-community network, the Campaign on Contingent Work (later renamed Massachusetts Global Action). CCW executive director Jason Pramas was the lead organizer of the forum. Over 5,000 people from over 300 community organizations and labor unions participated in more than 550 workshops, plenary sessions, and convocations at the event--which was timed to take place just before the 2004 Democratic National Convention, also being held in Boston. The majority of attendees came from the Northeast of the United States, but a large minority came from around North America, and there were delegations from over a dozen other countries (with simultaneous translation available in as many languages). Numerous cultural events were also part of the proceedings, the largest being a show at the famed Middle East Restaurant in nearby Cambridge featuring UK punk troubadour Billy Bragg, actor Chris Cooper, filmmaker John Sayles, and nearly 30 other acts and featured guests. In the leadup to the forum, singer Michelle Shocked, comedians Jimmy Tingle and Barry Crimmins, and many other artists and performers lent their talents to the effort--as did noted historian Howard Zinn and linguist Noam Chomsky. Simultaneously a local and a regional social forum within the World Social Forum process, the Boston Social Forum was a place for left-wing activists to strategize and network with (and educate) each other across the spectrum of human knowledge in a convivial environment-- united in the belief that \\"Another World is Possible\\". According to its organizers: > [the Boston Social Forum] was called to help progressive activists to begin > to answer some very basic questions: What kind of future do we want for > Boston? For our region? For our nation? For the world? What is our vision of > a better society? Through a series of workshops, cultural events, plenary > sessions, and giant convocations of the entire forum, we encouraged > progressive organizations of all kinds to showcase their best analysis of > the present, and their best ideas for the future, across the breadth of > human knowledge‚Äîpolitics, economics, science and technology, culture and > faith‚Äîin the context of corporate globalization. The goals of the event were > simple: encourage various social movements to exchange information, network > with one another, form new alliances, and push our movements forward a bit > more towards the next stage of our development.'' We wanted to do our part > to help progressives seize the high ground of ideas in this society, and > then, having captured people's imaginations, move forward to become a more > significant political force. Like their counterparts at sibling social forums, the Boston Social Forum organizers subscribed to the idea that the corporate-driven neoliberal ideology of runaway capitalism in the economic realm coupled with growing restrictions on democracy in the political realm were quite literally destroying the planet (at least for human life. . .). They also believed that the left-wing has important ideas in politics, economics, science and technology, culture and faith that could help save the planet, and build a human-centered, democratic and ecological society that will be capable of taking our species to the next phase of our evolution. By bringing together a broad array of left-wing activists and interested members of the public just before a large gathering of the Democratic Party--one of the two major political parties in the United States--organizers believed that the Boston Social Forum would demonstrate that the left-wing was a growing political force in the United States and worldwide, that it had good ideas, and that politically uncommitted people should consider joining its ranks. Critics within the World Social Forum process had previously thought that it would not be possible to hold a significant social forum in the United States given its history of American Exceptionalism and because they thought that the United States, as the main imperialist power of its day, did not have large enough social movements to provide a grassroots base for a major social forum. Boston Social Forum organizers believe they proved their critics wrong, and that their forum's success showed that the World Social Forum process could and should flower in the United States (and Canada).

He wrote a column and occasional articles for Time for 19 years until 2017. Early life Stein grew up in Edison, New Jersey, the son of a salesman. He is Jewish. Stein attended J.P. Stevens High School, where he was a writer and entertainment editor for Hawkeye, the student newspaper. He majored in English at Stanford University and wrote a weekly column for the school's student newspaper, The Stanford Daily. He graduated in 1993 with a BA and an MA and moved to New York City, and then to Los Angeles in 2005. Career Stein's career began as a writer and researcher for Martha Stewart Living. He worked a year for Stewart and later quipped that she had fired him twice in the same day. Stein did fact-checking at various publications before becoming a sports editor and columnist for Time Out New York, where he stayed for two years. While working at Time Out New York, he was a contestant on MTV's short-lived game show Idiot Savants. Stein joined Time in August 1997 and his last column for the magazine appeared on November 16, 2017. In signing off, he began, \\"Since my first column, 19 years ago, readers and co-workers have clamored to have me fired.\\" He concluded, \\"There are times when society needs a punk who doesn‚Äôt care. There are far fewer times when society needs a 46-year-old punk who doesn‚Äôt care. I‚Äôve always been guilty of hanging on too long out of fear of graduating college, ending relationships and transitioning from democracy to authoritarianism. I look forward to a future columnist who makes me laugh about that.\\" Stein sometimes appears as a commentator on television programs such as I Love the '80s. He also co-produced three TV pilots: an animated series for VH1 and two for ABC. The animated show, titled Hey Joel, aired in Canada and later in South Africa, while the other two were never picked up. He was a writer and producer for the sitcom Crumbs. Stein taught a class on humor writing at Princeton University before moving to Los Angeles in early 2005 to write for the Los Angeles Times. In 2012, he published a book, Man Made: A Stupid Quest for Masculinity (). Notable columns On January 24, 2006, the Los Angeles Times published a column by Stein under the headline \\"Warriors and Wusses\\" in which he wrote that it is a cop-out to oppose a war and yet claim to support the soldiers fighting it. \\"I don't support our troops. ... When you volunteer for the U.S. military, you pretty much know you're not going to be fending off invasions from Mexico and Canada. So you're willingly signing up to be a fighting tool of American imperialism ...\\". He prefaced his argument by stating that he does not support the troops in Iraq despite supporting the troops being \\"a position that even Calvin is unwilling to urinate on.\\" Stein states he did three interviews about the column on the Hugh Hewitt radio show, with Tony Snow, and with a \\"liberal\\" in Oregon. Mark Steyn wrote in a New York Sun opinion piece that Stein was to be congratulated for the consistency of his position: \\"Stein is a hawkish chicken, disdaining the weasel formulation too many anti-war folks take refuge in.\\" Warrant Officer Michael D. Fay wrote in The New York Times that Stein's comments made him feel \\"sad because they're so mistaken, sad because their voices are granted a modicum of credence in the public forum, and sad because they leave me feeling a little less at home.\\" In 2008, Stein wrote an article for the Los Angeles Times titled \\"Who runs Hollywood? C'mon\\", which mocked the canard of Jew controlling Hollywood by feigning outrage over declining acceptance of the stereotype. In July 2010, Stein wrote a humor column for Time in which he expressed his discomfort at the impact immigration of Indians has had on his hometown of Edison, New Jersey. Time and Stein subsequently publicly apologized for the article. Stein's apology read: \\"I truly feel stomach-sick that I hurt so many people. I was trying to explain how, as someone who believes that immigration has enriched American life and my hometown in particular, I was shocked that I could feel a tiny bit uncomfortable with my changing town when I went to visit it. If we could understand that reaction, we'd be better equipped to debate people on the other side of the immigration issue.\\" United States Senator from New Jersey Bob Menendez submitted a letter to Time stating that the column \\"not only fell terribly flat but crossed the lines of offensiveness toward a particular community that has dealt with violent hate crimes in the past. Mr. Stein's mocking allusions to revered deities in the Hindu religion are particularly reprehensible.\\" Kal Penn, actor and former associate director in the White House Office of Public Engagement, also criticized the column for its portrayal of Indian Americans. Slate magazine writer Tom Scocca wrote of the column, \\"To a charitable reader, it's clear that the piece was trying not to be offensive. Stein's description of his childhood small-town idyll before the mass immigration is deliberately fake-sentimental, describing lowlife white kids stealing things and getting drunk. He was trying to make more fun of white people than he made of Indian people.\\" Nonetheless, Scocca wrote, many Indian-Americans received the column \\"as an unironic anti-immigrant rant.\\" In May 2013, Stein penned a Time cover story titled \\"The Me Me Me Generation\\" about the narcissistic and immature tendencies of millennials, but how they will also \\"save us all.\\" The New Republic, The Atlantic, New York, and The Nation, criticized Stein for selective use of evidence, for making sweeping generalizations about the behavior of millennials, and for repeating claims that prior generations had made about the young people in their times. Assessments \\"I think he‚Äôs got the quirkiest sense of humor I see today,\\" Walter Isaacson, the chairman and CEO of CNN News Group told Stanford Magazine. \\"Joel's honed that self-effacing self-indulgence to a great art form.\\"https://stanfordmag.org/contents/it-s-all-about-joel \\"Stein can occasionally be funny,\\" wrote Variety TV columnist Brian Lowry when Stein was writing his column for the Los Angeles Times. \\"But what really bothers me about his work is that none of the ideas seem to have the weight to sustain a column. They're more like random musings str-et-ch-ed to column length ... Somehow, every column keeps cycling back to Stein's favorite subject‚ÄîJoel Stein, and finding employment opportunities for Joel Stein.\\" Stein \\"is not funny,\\" wrote Tom Scocca in Slate, arguing that his \\"lack of funniness is the key to understanding any phenomenon involving Joel Stein. He is a bad and incompetent humor writer, a writer who lacks the basic ability to control his tone and persona. I know no one under 50 who does not hate him because of this.\\" Scocca concluded, \\"Joel Stein is a soft writer in a soft gig, dressed up in an older generation's clothing, with an expired comic license in his pocket.\\" \\"In a magazine whose regular essayists include such deep thinkers as Charles Krauthammer, Margaret Carlson and Roger Rosenblatt, Stein's column is decidedly lightweight,\\" wrote the Stanford alumni magazine in fall 2001. \\"No one would call Stein's commentary sophisticated.\\" Stein acknowledged, \\"My whole goal is to use Time magazine to make important people do stupid things.\\" In an online column for Vanity Fair, Juli Weiner characterized Stein as a \\"forgettable I Love the '80s participant and Time magazine humor (?) columnist.\\" \\"I don't think I am a real journalist,\\" Stein told Alex Kuczynski for The New York Times in 2000. \\"I feel like I am, well, whatever we all are now: I am a celebrity journalist.\\" Kuczynski wrote that Stein's columns were marked by \\"bawdy humor, tasteless one-liners and something that can best be described as a sort of polished vulgarity.\\" Depictions in popular culture In 2000, The Onion spoofed Stein's persona in a satire whose headline was \\"Cocktail-Party Guest Cornered by Joel Stein.\\" In 2014, Stein played himself on an episode of The Neighbors along with Lawrence O'Donnell and Bill Nye.

Such large plates, for display rather than use, take slip-trailing to an extreme, building up lattices of thick trails of slip. Slipware is pottery identified by its primary decorating process where slip is placed onto the leather-hard clay body surface before firing by dipping, painting or splashing. Slip is an aqueous suspension of a clay body, which is a mixture of clays and other minerals such as quartz, feldspar and mica. The slip placed onto a wet or leather-hard clay body surface by a variety of techniques including dipping, painting, piping or splashing.Osborne, 746-747 Principal techniques include slip-painting, where the slip is treated like paint and used to create a design with brushes or other implements, and slip-trailing, where the slip, usually rather thick, is dripped, piped or trailed onto the body, typically from some device like the piping bag used to decorate cakes. The French term for slip is barbotine, and this term may be used for both techniques, but usually from different periods.Osborne, 746-747 Often only pottery where the slip creates patterns or images will be described as slipware, as opposed to the many types where a plain slip is applied to the whole body, for example most fine wares in Ancient Roman pottery, such as African red slip ware (note: \\"slip ware\\" not \\"slipware\\"). Decorative slips may be a different colour than the underlying clay body or offer other decorative qualities. Selectively applying layers of colored slips can create the effect of a painted ceramic, such as in the black-figure or red-figure pottery styles of Ancient Greek pottery. Slip decoration is an ancient technique in Chinese pottery also, used to cover whole vessels over 4,000 years ago.Vainker, 17, 22-23  Techniques  A coating of white or coloured slip (sometimes called by the French term engobe in American English) can be applied to the whole body of the article, or just one part, such as outside or inside of a cup or jug, to improve its appearance, to give a smoother surface to a rough body, mask an inferior colour or for decorative effect. Slip can also be applied by painting techniques, in isolation or in several layers and colours. Sgraffito (or \\"sgraffiato\\") involves scratching through a layer of coloured slip to reveal a different colour or the base body underneath. Several layers of slip and/or sgraffito can be done while the pot is still in an unfired state. One colour of slip can be fired, before a second is applied, and prior to the scratching or incising decoration. This is particularly useful if the base body is not of the desired colour or texture.Osborne, 746-747 Chinese pottery also used techniques where patterns, images or calligraphy were created as part-dried slip was cut away to reveal a lower layer of slip or the main clay body in a contrasting colour. The latter of these is called the \\"cut-glaze\\" technique.Vainker, 116-117 Slipware may be carved or burnished to change the surface appearance of the ware. Specialized slip recipes may be applied to biscuit ware and then refired.  History  Many prehistoric and historic cultures used slip as the primary decorating material on their ware, especially in early periods. These include most prehistoric cultures of the Middle East and much later Islamic pottery, cultures in many areas of Africa, most pottery-making cultures in the Americas, early Japanese (and later Onta ware) and much Korean pottery. Much Mycenean ware, Ancient Greek pottery and Ancient Roman pottery used slip, as did pre-industrialized potters in many areas of Europe, including Great Britain, most notably Thomas Toft in the Staffordshire Potteries.Osborne, 746-747 Later potters mostly combined or replaced the use of slip with ceramic glazes and pigments offering a tougher finish and a wider range of colours. But a variety of slipware techniques were revived by various studio pottery movements from the 19th century on. In England Bernard Leach and in America Mary Louise McLaughlin were among the leaders of these revivals.Osborne, 747 Gallery File:Roman pottery barbotine cup (cropped).JPGSimple slip-trailing in thick blobs, Roman Egypt, 0-200 AD File:Bowl with strutting bird, Sultanabad ware, Iran, Ilkhanid period, first half of 14th century, earthenware with gray englobe and underglaze painting in blue, black, white slip - Cincinnati Art Museum - DSC04054.JPGBowl with strutting bird, Sultanabad ware, Iran, Ilkhanid period, first half of 14th century, earthenware with gray englobe and underglaze painting in blue, black, white slip File:Korean punch'ong ware pear-shaped wine bottle, Choson dynasty, second half of 15th century, stoneware with glaze and white slip decoration, HAA.JPGKorean punch'ong ware pear-shaped wine bottle, Choson dynasty, second half of 15th century, stoneware with glaze and white slip decoration File:Mug LACMA M.89.124.jpgEnglish Slipware mug, ca. 1740 File:Ashiwi Polychrome Water Jar, 1700-1750,03.325.4739.jpgAshiwi slip- painted jar, She-we-na Zuni Pueblo, 1700-1750 File:Sugar bowl with combed, slip-marbled decoration, China, c. 1795, porcelain - Concord Museum - Concord, MA - DSC05753.JPGSugar bowl with combed, slip-marbled decoration, China, c. 1795, porcelain File:Tile, late 19th-early 20th century, X1047.7.jpgTile, Hopi Pueblo, late 19th-early 20th century File:Thrown, Slip Trailed Bowl by Takeshi Yasuda (YORYM-2004.1.1534).JPGModern slip-trailed bowl by Takeshi Yasuda See also *Culture of Korea *History of pottery in Palestine *Native American pottery *Pottery of Ancient Greece *Harvest jug NotesReferences * Eden, Victoria and Michael.

Beanland was founded in Oxford in 1985 by guitarists Bill McCrory and George McConnell, with Adam Stoll on drums and harmonica. After some early shuffling, the band's line-up consisted of McConnell and McCrory on guitar, John \\"JoJo\\" Hermann on keyboards, Ron Lewis on bass, and Harry Peel on drums. The band recorded a self-titled debut album in 1991 and toured extensively, mainly around the South and Southwest, playing blues-oriented rock as part of the nascent early-1990s jamband renaissance. Shortly after the album's release, keyboardist John \\"JoJo\\" Hermann left Beanland to join Widespread Panic. McConnell kept Beanland alive briefly as a four-piece with a much-altered line-up, and recorded a follow-up album in 1992, but the band dissolved soon after. George McConnell later joined JoJo Hermann in Widespread Panic, serving as that band's lead guitarist from 2002-2006. The Beanland songs \\"Sellin' The Rain\\" and \\"Doreatha\\" from the debut album garnered some airplay on college radio stations throughout the Southeastern United States. The band has a moderate cult following.

He served as a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors and in the California State Senate. Kopp ran unsuccessfully for Mayor of San Francisco in 1979 against Dianne Feinstein. Kopp advocated for the extension of BART to SFO which was completed in 2003.  Early life  Kopp was born in 1928 in Syracuse, New York. His second son, Brad, is a musician who goes by the name Stark Raving Brad and lives in San Francisco. His daughter Jennifer is the executive director of the Napa Valley Grape Growers Association. Kopp was elected to a political office as an independent politician, rather than as a member of a political party. For a time, Kopp held a time slot as a radio talk show host on KGO-AM, a popular talk radio station.  Political career  Kopp was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1971 and served until 1986, representing the West Portal neighborhood. In 1979, Kopp ran for mayor against Dianne Feinstein, but lost in a runoff election. This election also featured Jello Biafra (singer for the punk band Dead Kennedys). In 1986, Kopp ran for California State Senate as an independent in a heavily Democratic district straddling south San Francisco and northern San Mateo counties. Republican distaste for the Democratic nominee (then Assemblyman Lou Papan)California Journal Vol. XXI, No.5 (May 1990) \\"Complete District-by- district Analysis\\". StateNet Publications, May 1990. led them to financially support Kopp, who went on to win by one percentage point. He won reelection in 1990 and 1994. Term limits prevented Kopp from seeking reelection in 1998. In 1998, Republican then-Governor Pete Wilson appointed Kopp to a judgeship in San Mateo County. He served in that capacity until his retirement in 2004. During his time in the California State Senate, and afterward, Kopp, together with Mike Nevin, helped push through the BART extension to San Francisco International Airport with an airport station. In 1994, Kopp qualified an advisory ballot measure in San Francisco, Measure I, which advocated for a station inside the International Terminal. This resulted in the BART extension being built as a triangle, with the vertices being the San Bruno station at Tanforan Shopping Center, and not on the Caltrain Right-of-Way, Millbrae (Caltrain terminal) and SFO International Terminal. To get to all the stations on the extension, the BART train has to reverse at least once. The alternative rejected by Kopp was single station at San Bruno, California where the SFO People mover, BART and Caltrain would share a common station. The extension of the SFO People Mover across to the station was to be paid for as part of the traffic mitigation for the new International Terminal.  California High Speed Rail Authority  Kopp served as a member of the California High-Speed Rail Authority (CHSRA).High Speed Rail Authority Web Site, About Page, Retrieved September 22, 2008. As Chairman he worked to lead statewide efforts to develop an 800-mile high speed train network linking northern and southern California with fast, reliable, and environmentally friendly trains capable of traveling at up to . To help fund the project, Kopp led efforts to pass Proposition 1A in November 2008 - a $9.95 billion bond that has created the momentum that has led to the project receiving billions in federal funds. On 28 January 2009, without informing the CHSRA board, and without any vote, Kopp sent a list on Rail Authority letterhead to U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein of \\"projects that CHSRA has identified...which can currently be commenced.\\" The list omitted any requests for funds for two shovel ready projects: The Anaheim Station and Transbay Terminal extension in San Francisco, which would also serve as a key connection for transit riders arriving from the East Bay, following the decision to align the rail line through the South Bay and Pacheco Pass rather than the East Bay and Altamont Pass. Both the Anaheim Station and Transbay terminal projects had environmental review work completed based on input from the Authority. At the 5 March 2009 board meeting of the Rail Authority in Sacramento, when it became clear that another rail authority board member had obtained a copy of Kopp's letter, Kopp tried to hastily cure the record. He departed from the Board's meeting agenda and attempted to conduct an ad hoc vote of those board members in attendance regarding a project list which was never provided to the public and without any advance notice, a maneuver that the Train Riders Association of California (TRAC) considers a clear and egregious violation of the Brown Act.  Later life  Interstate 380 in San Mateo County, a short, urban freeway connector, was renamed the \\"Quentin L. Kopp Freeway\\". The road was previously named the Portola Freeway by California's State Legislature, after Gaspar de Portol√†. Kopp sent a letter to NPR correspondent Tamara Keith dated February 17, 2016 in which he described greetings exchanged between herself and fellow NPR host Audie Cornish as reminiscent of a \\"moronic schoolgirl\\" and that Cornish \\"debases a once respected profession with her flippant greeting.\\" Keith posted two photos of the letter on her Twitter on March 8, 2016.

Organ shoes are shoes worn by organists, designed to facilitate playing of the organ pedal keyboard. Also, since organ shoes are worn only at the organ, the use of special footwear avoids picking up grit or grime that could scar or stain the pedal keys. Shoes are not always used; some famous organists like Rhoda Scott play with bare feet. Description Organ shoes are typically as narrow as comfortably possible, so as to prevent accidental playing of more than one pedal key at a time. They usually have both leather soles and leather heels that are glued into place (rather than stitched), which allow the organist to slide the feet along and across the pedals easily. The soles should be thin enough to feel the pedal key surfaces reasonably easily, but sufficiently stiff for solid and secure playing contact with the pedal keys. Organ shoes typically have a slightly higher heel of about one inch - to ease playing with the heel, and to allow non-adjacent notes to be played at once by one foot.

It has a population of 2,126 people as of March 2014. The formation of the village, as known today, goes back to the Punic-Roman period. The village of ƒ¶al Safi is surrounded by four other major villages. Farmers and peasants used to interact on their way back home from work. After a niche was erected, people began to settle, a new village started to form and expanded over the years. In 1417, the village was already recorded as being named ƒ¶al Safi. According to 1419 records of the Standing Army (id-Dejma), counting between eighty and ninety people, were considered as village residents. The job occupations of the period were based on primary economy, mainly raising animal and agriculture. The origin of the village's name is uncertain. Some historians believe that the name derived from the pure () air of the area, others insist it is due to its similarity to the City of Safi in Morocco, and others say since none of the residents were contaminated during an epidemic infection that hit vast zones in Malta. The coat-of-arms, a horizontal light- blue stripe on a silver background, and the motto, Sine Macula, emphasize the meaning of the village. Declaration of the village as a parish For several years ƒ¶al Safi formed part of Bir Miftuƒß. However, the residents were not happy with this, mostly because of the distance between the two villages. Instead they wished to at least form part of ≈ªurrieq, which was much nearer. In 1575 when Monsignor Pietro Dusina visited ƒ¶al Safi, the residents put their wish forward, but nothing came out of it. At last, in 1592, Bishop Gargallo decided to separate ƒ¶al Safi, Imqabba and ƒ¶al Kirkop from Bir Miftuƒß. He amalgamated the three villages into one Parish. Father Carl Taliana from Luqa was appointed as its Parish Priest. ƒ¶al Safi residents were still not satisfied because they had to walk long distances when visiting the church dedicated to Saint James at ƒ¶al Kirkop for the celebration of sacraments such as Holy Communion and Funerals. When ƒ¶al Safi residents got to know that a new church was going to be built at ƒ¶al Kirkop, they were not keen on donating money for the project. In 1598, a delegation of twelve men from ƒ¶al Safi paid a visit to Bishop Gargallo. In the name of all ƒ¶al Safi residents, they filed a petition requesting that the village of two hundred and ten residents become a Parish. This time the Bishop accepted their request. So, in April 1598, a contract to this effect was drawn up in front of Notary Debono. According to the agreement, ƒ¶al Safi residents had to pay the Parish Priest an annual sum of money, precisely on the feast of the Conversion of Saint Paul. The administration of this new Parish was assigned to Dun Gwann Mizzi. After three months, Dun Gwann Mizzi was appointed Parish Priest of Imqabba. Dun Mattew Xiriha was put in his stead on a temporary basis. The Dejma cross, and the chapel of St Mary (left) In those years, there were five chapels in ƒ¶al Safi. The largest one, which was dedicated to Saint Paul, was chosen to serve as the Parish Church. As a commemoration of the foundation of the Parish, a church bell was bought. An image of Saint Peter and another one of Saint Paul together with the following inscription \\"Sancte Paule Ora Pro Nobis\\" were engraved in it. The other four chapels were dedicated to: St. Agatha, the Assumption of the Virgin Mary, and two to the Birth of the Virgin Mary. The only one still in existence is that dedicated to the Assumption of the Virgin Mary, which was re-built in 1761. Feast Back in 1575, a small feast in honour of Saint Paul was already being celebrated in church. Then, in 1725, external celebrations were added on. A procession with the relic of St. Paul was first held in 1732. In 1840, a statue of St. Paul, sculptured in wood by Xandru Farrugia of Zejtun, was introduced and paraded during the procession. That year, feast celebrations were organised to their very best. These included ground fireworks, petards, band services and liturgical ceremonies. From that year onwards, band services became a fixed contribution and in 1874 a stage was constructed purposely for the band. Since feast celebrations were expanding year after year, a feast club (St. Paul's Club) was set up in 1929 to help with the feast's organization. Another statue of St. Paul, in Safi, in front of the band club Four outstanding feasts were celebrated in 1960, in 1984, in 1998 and in 2008. The first one commemorated the arrival of Saint Paul on our island; the one celebrated in 1984 commemorated the 200th anniversary of the Consegration of ƒ¶al Safi Parish Church; the third one commemorated the 400th anniversary of ƒ¶al Safi Parish, whilst the fourth commemorated \\"Is-Sena Pawlina\\". Pilgrimages, sermons, choir participation, band services and fireworks were organised to commemorate each anniversary. Up till the year 1959, the feast in honour of St. Paul was held on 25 January. From 1960 onwards, mainly due to January‚Äôs bad weather, this feast was diverted to the last Sunday of August . In the year 1971, a new feast hymn was composed by Mro. A. Muscat Azzopardi to lyrics written by Paul Callus. Then in 1981, another hymn was written, this time by J. Zerafa and composed by Mro. E. Bugeja. A major hymn called \\"Is-Sejha\\", written by Paul Callus and composed by Mro. Ray Sciberras came into being in 2002. When Fr. Michael Agius took up office as Parish Priest, feast activities rapidly increased. On the initiative of Saint Paul‚Äôs Club, two band marches were added to the programme - one on Friday evenings and another on Sunday mornings. Moreover, persons in charge of fireworks organized another band march on Sunday night, right after the procession. Likewise, decorations, such as lights and banners, in preparation for this religious feast were also increased especially in several roads and in the main square. The day following the feast of Saint Paul is considered a holiday by all the residents. The majority of them go on the ‚Äòxalata‚Äô to Armier where they spend the day on the beach. Band  St Paul Band Club building St. Paul's Band (L-Gƒßaqda Mu≈ºikali San Pawl) was formed in 1989, and it falls under the auspices of St. Paul's Club, ƒ¶al Safi. Culture In the past, the most common job occupied by ƒ¶al Safi residents was in the agriculture sector. Others were soldiers employed by the Standing Army. Some others were sailors, builders, stonemasons, white-washers and quite a number of residents were street hawkers. Soon after the Second World War, many farmers left their fields to join the government sector. Nowadays, the work force is vaster and includes employees in the government sector, private sector, dry docks, factories. In addition, one can find several self-employed persons and contractors. Lately, the trend has changed and the number of University qualified people is always increasing earning high-profile jobs such as doctors, lawyers, teachers, accountants and management personnel. Farming is now mostly done as part-time and to some extent more as a hobby than as a means of making a living. Early 20th-century Villa Dun Gwann, now a convent, was damaged during the war. By the end of the Second World War, the street lanterns and the drinking fountains became obsolete, and instead, improved services such as electricity, sewage, postage mail, telecommunication, water and other services were introduced. In 1962, the construction of a new and modern school was initiated to replace the one situated in St. Paul‚Äôs Street. In the 80‚Äôs a playing field adjacent to the school was inaugurated, later refurbished with synthetic turf in 2000. In 1986, a public health clinic started to operate in Saint George Street. Moreover, the number of houses and consequently the number of residents is always increasing. In fact, from latest statistics, the population of ƒ¶al Safi has reached one thousand and eight hundred persons. Furthermore, the number of retail outlets multiplied in the last few years. The most two common surnames in the village are Busuttil and Zammit. The village roads can be divided into two: the old ones, which formed part of the old village and the newly constructed ones. The older ones were all named after various saints, but on the other hand the recent ones were named using several other criteria. The climax of the social life is the celebration of the village festa, celebrated through the last week of August. The patron Saint of ƒ¶al Safi is St. Paul. Like most villages, ƒ¶al Safi residents had nobody representing them in central government. Since 1994, ƒ¶al Safi has had its own Local Council which contributed in no small way to increasing the number of projects created for the benefit of ƒ¶al Safi residents. Nationalist Party There are few social clubs which happen to be frequented by the locals in the early evening hours. Passing through ƒ¶al Safi one can remark the lack of social activity where the empty tranquil roads are often associated to a Gozitan village.

Route description The Moonie Highway is part of two of the many practicable routes from the south-east of Queensland to the south-east of South Australia. It is also on the shortest route to St George and Cunnamulla from any locality on or near the Queensland coast from Bundaberg to Coolangatta. Dalby to Moonie The highway leaves Dalby via Nicholson and Loudoun Streets. After about 7.8 km it crosses Myall Creek just south of its junction with the Condamine River. After a further 1.7 km it crosses the Condamine. It runs through rich farming land until it reaches the locality of Kumbarilla near the intersection with the Surat Developmental Road. Kumbarilla is located on a ridge (Kumbarilla Ridge) which divides the Surat Basin from the Clarence-Moreton Basin to the east.

It ends at the Carnarvon Highway, about 9.1 km from the centre of St George. History The first recorded European settlement in the Moonie district was in about 1849 when land at the head of the Moonie River was formed into a station and named \\"Weranga\\". The current locality of Weranga, the Weranga railway station, and the Weranga State Forest are all in the area once occupied by the station. As further stations were formed along the Moonie River a road to access them was developed, generally following the course of the main channel of the river. This road still exists as Old Moonie Road.

Events  On 13 December 2004, Rodrigo Granda, a member (the \\"foreign minister\\") of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia, or \\"FARC\\"), was captured by individual Venezuelan officials in Caracas, Venezuela, and transferred to C√∫cuta, Colombia (a departmental capital on the two nations' common border), where he was arrested by the Colombian authorities on 14 December. Granda had been an uninvited attendant to the Second Bolivarian People's Congress in Caracas, an international gathering of supporters of the Bolivarian Revolution in Venezuela. . Colombia admitted that it offered and paid a reward for Granda's capture, although it initially denied that he had been captured in Caracas and transported to C√∫cuta, only stating that he had been officially arrested by authorities in C√∫cuta. The FARC issued a statement claiming that the Venezuelan state should have protected Granda during his visit, and Granda's lawyer said that Granda held dual Venezuelan and Colombian citizenship. The Venezuelan interior ministry dismissed the FARC's claims, stated that Granda's Venezuelan identification card had been obtained through the use of forged documents and, in addition, that Venezuela had been unaware of Granda's visit and therefore had never decided for or against protecting him. Venezuelan authorities stated that their country would have cooperated with Colombian authorities through official channels, but rejected what they considered an undue violation of their sovereignty.  Diplomatic tensions  This event set off a series of diplomatic tensions, with Colombia questioning Venezuela's lack of cooperation in law enforcement actions against guerrillas in its territory, the United States supporting Colombia's position and outright accusing Venezuela of harboring these guerrillas, Venezuela accusing Colombia of violating its sovereignty, and the FARC accusing Venezuela of doing too little to protect its members. Venezuela demanded an apology from Colombia, recalled its ambassador for consultations, and suspended bilateral (government-to-government) commercial agreements. Individuals and enterprises in both countries suffered, but Colombian border regions were especially affected by the crisis. On 15 February 2005, Venezuelan President Hugo Ch√°vez and Colombian President √Ålvaro Uribe held a summit meeting that they both said resolved the diplomatic tensions. Both presidents stated that their nations and governments would henceforth avoid discussing similar issues through the media, and instead they would communicate directly through official diplomatic channels, in order to cooperate more effectively in matters of their mutual interest. They both credited Cuba, Peru, and Brazil for helping with mediation, while Ch√°vez blamed the United States for precipitating the crisis and trying to prevent its resolution. Commercial relations and agreements were fully restored.

It was founded in 1906 by Grace Eliza McCallie, Tommie Payne Duffy, and Eula Lea Jarnagin. GPS enrolls students in grades 6-12. These students are taught by GPS's 66 faculty members, over 80% of whom hold advanced degrees. Since 2006, Girls Preparatory School has won 20 state championships in various sports. In addition, the school has graduated 49 National Merit Semifinalists in the past 13 years. For the 2019‚Äì20 school year, GPS enrolled 560 girls from 28 zip codes, with 210 in Middle School and 350 in Upper School. Its brother school, The McCallie School, was founded a year earlier by McCallie's brothers. GPS's Interim Head of School is Dr. Kirk Walker, former headmaster at The McCallie School. History= Origins  In 1906, Duffy and Jarnagin, two public school teachers, asked the city school board to provide a fourth year of high school studies, including modern language and a lab science, so that girls, as well as boys, would apply for college. When their request was denied, they decided to create an independent school to prepare girls for higher education and convinced their friend Grace McCallie to join them. In 12 weeks, they converted McCallie's former home to a school. The three founders pooled all of their money, $300, to equip and launch the school. The school opened on September 12, 1906, in a four-room schoolhouse at 106 Oak Street, which had formerly been McCallie's home. The ground floor contained classrooms with second-hand desks. There was also an alcove library and cloakroom. The school welcomed 45 enrolled students on the first day of classes on September 12, 1906. Each girl paid $80 tuition per year, and at the end of the first year one of the students was accepted to and enrolled in Randolph-Macon Woman's College. In 1915, the school relocated to a larger brick building at 611 Palmetto Street. In 1947, GPS again moved, this time to its current home on Island Avenue, with 14 classrooms, a study hall, library and dining hall. Since the move, the campus has been significantly added on to and revitalized, with the addition of a separate middle school and high school, an 800-seat theater, and a new student center, among other facilities. Girls Preparatory School celebrated its 100th anniversary during the 2005‚Äì2006 school year.  Milestones  * 1907: The tradition of Cat-Rat begins with seniors welcoming new students. Girls learning to support one another is a tradition that continues today. * 1909: GPS spearheads the establishment of the city's first girls basketball league. * 1914: The first May Day celebration was a picnic with a Greek theme. Today's spring tradition honors the seniors and their May Court with dances and a winding of the May Pole. * 1915: GPS moves to a new building on Palmetto St., adding a science lab, study hall, and multi-purpose space. An additional lot provides space for P.E. classes. * 1918: On March 10, Grace McCallie dies. In her honor, the Grace McCallie Scholarship is awarded. * 1924: The regulation uniform is a linen dress with tucks, two pockets, and large black bow.

Partnerships in the Community (PIC)  A broad spectrum of community organizations and components of local governments are part of PIC: East Side Elementary School and Chattanooga Girls Leadership Academy; City of Chattanooga Office of Multicultural Affairs and the Northside Neighborhood House; Habitat for Humanity of the Greater Chattanooga Area and the Chattanooga Area Food Bank.  Tucker River Fellows  At the retirement of former longtime headmaster Randy Tucker, the GPS Board of Trustees and friends of the school joined together to honor his tenure with the establishment of the Tucker Fellows Program, a two-year student study of the Tennessee River. The mission of the program, which began in the summer before the 2014‚Äì15 school year, is to prepare future leaders to have an effect on the conservation of the Tennessee River. Fellows, selected prior to their freshman year, spend part of the summer and following academic year engaged in interdisciplinary scholarship and experiential learning about the many issues impacting their local watershed as well as learning about the historical, ecological, political, economic and aesthetic significance of the Tennessee River. During the second year in the program, fellows focus on leadership skills while continuing to learn about the river and watershed. They read and discuss the works of current and historic environmental thinkers. They choose a focus and work with local experts, scientific literature, and policy to become more knowledgeable about their chosen topic. They then collect, analyze, and publish data. Throughout the program, fellows become familiar with the various entities that implement, enforce, and monitor watershed policy. By the end of the program, fellows propose solutions to watershed problems and become lifelong advocates for clean, healthy watersheds in the Chattanooga area and beyond.  Traditions  GPS upholds many traditions that are celebrated throughout the school year, with many including community service opportunities.  May Day  While most traditions are school-wide, some focus on certain grades. One such tradition is May Day, a pageant that combines the old traditions of a May Day from the Renaissance and a debutante pageant. The senior class is presented in colorful dresses, one by one, with a May Court and May Queen introduced separately; the May Queen is the last presented. The May Queen and Court are nominated by the senior class and then chosen by the student body and faculty based upon personality and embodiment of a true GPS girl. After the class is introduced, festivities are held on the school's front lawn, and seniors, guests, and the student body watch as different grades dance to music chosen to match that year's theme. The last dance is the May Pole ceremony, in which sophomores wrap three traditional May Poles for the Queen to walk under, ending the ceremony.  Senior Chapel Talks  Another tradition is that of senior Chapel Talks. Each senior gives a three- to seven-minute talk about a subject of her choosing to her peers and invited guests during a schoolwide assembly, also called Chapel, which occurs several times a week.  Cat-Rat  Another highly celebrated tradition is that of Cat-Rat, a pairing of a senior with a new sixth-grader. In this tradition the senior Cat acts as a mentor and friend to the sixth grader, her Rat. Cats decorate their Rats‚Äô lockers prior to the start of school, and the revealing of the newly decorated locker is a key part of the Cat-Rat Reveal (which also takes place just before the start of school). In addition, during the Cat-Rat Reveal, the sixth grade Rats take part in a random drawing which determines the order of their Cats‚Äô Chapel Talks. Several parties, activities, and celebrations help the girls get to know each other better and allow the senior girl to guide the younger student through her school year. The long- standing tradition has been known to bond students as friends and even business partners well into adulthood.  Robin Hood  Formerly, a weeklong festival was planned each year by an elected committee of students, known as Robin Hood. In the festival, any school-recognized club or team is able to open a booth and sell a craft or food for a charity of their choice. The committee itself could also operate a booth, which would benefit the overall goal of that year's Robin Hood. In the past, the main goal has been to gift Greg Mortenson, author of Three Cups of Tea: One Man's Mission To Promote Peace... One School At A Time and the founder of Central Asia Institute, with the money to endow a girls' school in Pakistan. Another year it was to help assist a like-minded Chattanooga school with a contribution to Chattanooga Girl's Leadership Academy, an all girls college preparatory charter school focusing on STEM education, the first public single-gender school in Tennessee. This long-standing tradition, however, was phased out by 2014.  MBD: Girl Edition  One of GPS's newer traditions, MBD: Girl Edition, is an entrepreneurial opportunity for girls in and around the Chattanooga area to seek knowledge and support from local professionals. It debuted in 2015 as a women's and girls' symposium, Mad Bad and Dangerous, and has hosted such notable guest speakers as Lori Greiner, prolific inventor and \\"Shark Tank\\" star. The most recent installment features a one-day Girls Marketplace, where girls can sell products and services, and a 24Hour Generator, which pairs students with mentors to help them solve real-world business problems as they compete for a cash prize. The event relies heavily on volunteers and financial support of businesses and community organizations.  Other  The onsite garden is maintained and cultivated by the environmental science class, a junior and senior science elective. The crops grown in the garden are chosen and raised by the students, harvested, and taken to the Chattanooga Area Food Bank, or included in the school's lunch menu. There are many other traditions as well, such as a long-standing partnership with Habitat for Humanity, and leadership summer camps.

The farms in the region produce sugarcane, subtropical fruit and winter vegetables. The town was proclaimed in 1949 after which it was named. The origin of the name is disputed but was corrupted from the swazi. Either the expression \\"eMlalani\\" which means place of the palms, or the expression \\"lala\\" which means to sleep are accepted origins of the name. The town started as the first rest-stop between Louren√ßo Marques and Pretoria. As of July 2007 the town was officially renamed from \\"Malelane\\" to \\"Malalane\\" as part of the governments renaming scheme by the South African Geographical Names Council. History One of Malelane's earliest pioneers was Captain GJ (Mkonto) Elphick. After having fought in the Anglo-Boer War (1899-1902), Elphick bought the old Malelane farm and successfully planted tomatoes, cotton, mangos, oranges and pawpaws. Elphick also pioneered the commercial aspect of Malelane by opening the first store in the vicinity.Marius Bakkes, Corridor Gazette, Thursday 14 January 2016 One of the tombstones erected for GJ Elphick at the Malalane cemetery Despite Elphick's operations, the Onderberg area was predominantly a bush area and formed part of The Kruger Shooting Concession. Leopard, lion and buffalo were often shot as a sport. In 1926 the area was proclaimed as The Kruger National Park and hunting stopped. The effect of this was minimal as visitors to the area now visited to see the game instead of hunting it. With the formation of the national park a barbed wire fence was erected. This had little effect on the agricultural sector of the region except that animals were now more controlled and were limited in roaming onto farmers crops, although larger game such as buffalo and elephant still strayed onto farms. In 1942 the government of the Transvaal commissioned a dirt road through the area for military use, that was later tarred. The road increased traffic through the area, however this had little effect on the local economy as the traffic was primarily passing through to Louren√ßo Marques (now Maputo). The odd traveller may have stopped at a local shop but the increase in trade had no real impact. In 1963 the fence bordering the Kruger National Park was upgraded to meet international standards and was proclaimed proficient against the threat of foot and mouth disease in the park. The migration of larger game was severely restricted. Elephant, buffalo, lion and hippo now had extremely limited access to crops and farmers could invest more into their produce as the threat of them being destroyed by wild animals was minimal. Cattle were a popular choice as the threat of them being eaten by predators was now much less than before (although it still occurred). 1965 saw the upgrade of the foot and mouth fence. It was electrified and known as the Snyman fence. It also saw the construction of the Transvaal Suiker Beperk (TSB) sugar mill near the Malalane entrance of the Kruger National Park. Naturally this had the effect of mass planting of sugar cane in the area. The area soon began to flourish and was characterised by good sugar production and tourism. The mill still runs to this day and serves local farmers. The military road was upgraded again the meet the needs of the area but also to service Eskom operations in the area. This meant easier access for tourists to enter the region and to travel to Mozambique. The upgrade never saw any tangible benefit to farmers except that goods could be transported more easily. Economy and tourism A trend of growth was experienced until 1998 when the road servicing the area was upgraded yet again to a national road status. The road was named the ‚ÄòN4‚Äô and became a toll road. A government project was launched which saw significant growth in the area. This was known as the Maputo Corridor. Malelane Gate was then named as one of the main entrances to the Kruger National Park. This led to a drastic increase in tourism in the area and many lodges were established. These include: Malelane Lodge, Pestana Lodge and some bed and breakfasts. The area also saw the establishment of Riverview Primary and Laerskool Malelane Primary. Due to the growth big corporations came to the area. Sun International bought Malelane lodge and Spar and Pick 'n Pay also invested in branches of their retail shops in the area. The effect of this was very beneficial to the area but in particular the agricultural sector. Rather than buying goods from far away suppliers Spar and Pick 'n Pay bought from local farmers. This had an added benefit that farmers now had a stable market where their goods could be sold or bought. Unsurprisingly tourists of the area also bought goods from the new shops rather than bringing in their own goods from afar. Due to the increase of tourist activities in the area, many contractors were brought in to meet the demands of new developments in the area. The growth of Malalane town was now at a peak as many people were now living in the town or nearby because their jobs entailed them working at lodges or similar establishments in the immediate area. This boosted the local economy greatly and local shops benefited greatly from the new influx of trade. More trade also came from Mozambique after the civil war. Future developments saw sections of the Kruger National Park being outsourced to large companies and corporations. This had both negative and positive effects on the region. By outsourcing sections of the Kruger National Park the companies involved could attract more foreign tourists. The bonus of this was that the tourists injected large amounts of foreign exchange into the area's economy. This did have a bump-on effect though. Local companies lost out in trade to the corporations and consequently some local businesses suffered. The National Parks Board also declared a policy of no more peripheral development (i.e. no new camps, lodges or developments were to be built in the park). Together with the deregulation of open top game vehicles the park saw entrance admissions previously unheard of. The development of the Leopard Creek Golf Club and housing estate aided in giving the local economy a boost. An added bonus to this was the revenue brought in from golf tournaments, such as the Sunshine Tour's Alfred Dunhill Championship, and was beneficial to the town. Other lodges and B&B;'s were also built in the area.

CMS College Kottayam is also one of the first colleges established in India. Overview The college now has fourteen departments teaching 47 courses. There are six research centres in the college. Research work leading to the degree of Doctor of Philosophy is conducted in the departments of Botany, Zoology, Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, English, and Commerce. History The great hall CMS College Kottayam was founded by the Church Missionary Society of England, in 1815 when no institution existed in what was then the princely state of Travancore to teach English. CMS College Kottayam was patronised by Col. John Munro, the East India Company Resident, and Dewan of Travancore. The Rev. Benjamin Bailey was the first principal. Apart from English, Greek and Latin were taught. The government of India welcomed the college as \\"a place of general education hence any demands of the state for officers to fill all the departments of public service would be met\\". In the early years of the Old Seminary (Orthodox Pazhaya Seminary), the curriculum included the study of Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Mathematics, History, and Geography besides English, Malayalam, Sanskrit, and Syriac. In 1838, the college moved to a wooded hillock ‚Äî the present site ‚Äî commanding views of the distant Western Ghats. One of the oldest buildings in the campus is Room 52, or the \\"Grammar School\\", as it was originally called. A college magazine in Malayalam was started in 1864 by Principal Richard Collins, after whom the college library is named. In 1857 the college was affiliated to Madras University soon after its incorporation, and the college began to present students for the Matriculation examination. It provided free education to all its students until 1855 when the fee of one Rupee per month per student was collected. The number of students in 1870 was 129. In 1880, Visakham Thirunal, Maharaja of Travancore, observed on a visit to the college: \\"Long before the state undertook the humanizing task of educating the subjects, the Christian Missionaries had raised the beacon of knowledge in the land\\". In 1840, the number of students in the College was 220. In 1890, two-year classes were started, and the first batch of students, initially all men, was presented for the F.A. Examination in 1892. Female students were not admitted to the college until 1938. In 1950, Degree classes were started, and by 1960 the number of students in the college had risen to 1,250. Postgraduate classes were started in 1959. The college is now affiliated to Mahatma Gandhi University, Kottayam. In 1981, the Synod of the Church of South India transferred the management of the college to the C. S. I. Madhya Kerala Diocese. In 1999 the college was accredited by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council with five-star status. In 2004 the University Grants Commission accorded it the status of College with Potential for Excellence. In 2009, the CMS English department celebrated the Golden Jubilee of the introduction of a postgraduate programme. Notable alumni * K. R. Narayanan, former President of India * K. P. S.

For aircraft, this air is usually bled off from the gas turbine engines at the compressor stage, and for spacecraft, it is carried in high-pressure, often cryogenic tanks. The air is cooled, humidified, and mixed with recirculated air if necessary, before it is distributed to the cabin by one or more environmental control systems. The cabin pressure is regulated by the outflow valve. While the first experimental pressurization systems saw use during the 1920s and 1930s, it was not until 1938 that the Boeing 307 Stratoliner, the first commercial aircraft to be equipped with a pressurized cabin, was introduced. The practice would become widespread a decade later, particularly with the introduction of the British de Havilland Comet in 1949, the world's first jetliner. While initially a success, two catastrophic failures in 1954 temporarily grounded the worldwide fleet; the cause was found to be a combination of progressive metal fatigue and aircraft skin stresses, both of which aeronautical engineers only had a limited understanding of at the time. The key engineering principles learned from the Comet were applied directly to the design of all subsequent jet airliners, such as the Boeing 707. Certain aircraft have presented unusual pressurization scenarios. The supersonic airliner Concorde had a particularly high pressure differential due to flying at unusually high altitude (up to while maintaining a cabin altitude of . This not only increased airframe weight, but also saw the use of smaller cabin windows than most other commercial passenger aircraft, intended to slow the decompression rate if a depressurization event occurred. The Aloha Airlines Flight 243 incident, involving a Boeing 737-200 that suffered catastrophic cabin failure mid-flight, was primarily caused by its continued operation despite having accumulated more than twice the number of flight cycles that the airframe was designed to endure. For increased passenger comfort, several modern airliners, such as the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and the Airbus A350 XWB, feature reduced operating cabin altitudes as well as greater humidity levels; the use of composite airframes has aided the adoption of such comfort- maximising practices. Need for cabin pressurization The pressurization controls on a Boeing 737-800 Pressurization becomes increasingly necessary at altitudes above above sea level to protect crew and passengers from the risk of a number of physiological problems caused by the low outside air pressure above that altitude. For private aircraft operating in the US, crew members are required to use oxygen masks if the cabin altitude (a representation of the air pressure, see below) stays above 12,500 ft for more than 30 minutes, or if the cabin altitude reaches 14,000 ft at any time. At altitudes above 15,000 ft, passengers are required to be provided oxygen masks as well. On commercial aircraft, the cabin altitude must be maintained at or less. Pressurization of the cargo hold is also required to prevent damage to pressure-sensitive goods that might leak, expand, burst or be crushed on re- pressurization. The principal physiological problems are listed below. ; Hypoxia : The lower partial pressure of oxygen at high altitude reduces the alveolar oxygen tension in the lungs and subsequently in the brain, leading to sluggish thinking, dimmed vision, loss of consciousness, and ultimately death. In some individuals, particularly those with heart or lung disease, symptoms may begin as low as , although most passengers can tolerate altitudes of without ill effect. At this altitude, there is about 25% less oxygen than there is at sea level. ‚Äì Online interactive altitude oxygen calculator : Hypoxia may be addressed by the administration of supplemental oxygen, either through an oxygen mask or through a nasal cannula. Without pressurization, sufficient oxygen can be delivered up to an altitude of about . This is because a person who is used to living at sea level needs about 0.20 bar partial oxygen pressure to function normally and that pressure can be maintained up to about by increasing the mole fraction of oxygen in the air that is being breathed. At , the ambient air pressure falls to about 0.2 bar, at which maintaining a minimum partial pressure of oxygen of 0.2 bar requires breathing 100% oxygen using an oxygen mask. : Emergency oxygen supply masks in the passenger compartment of airliners do not need to be pressure-demand masks because most flights stay below . Above that altitude the partial pressure of oxygen will fall below 0.2 bar even at 100% oxygen and some degree of cabin pressurization or rapid descent will be essential to avoid the risk of hypoxia. ; Altitude sickness : Hyperventilation, the body's most common response to hypoxia, does help to partially restore the partial pressure of oxygen in the blood, but it also causes carbon dioxide (CO2) to out-gas, raising the blood pH and inducing alkalosis. Passengers may experience fatigue, nausea, headaches, sleeplessness, and (on extended flights) even pulmonary oedema. These are the same symptoms that mountain climbers experience, but the limited duration of powered flight makes the development of pulmonary oedema unlikely. Altitude sickness may be controlled by a full pressure suit with helmet and faceplate, which completely envelops the body in a pressurized environment; however, this is impractical for commercial passengers. ; Decompression sickness : The low partial pressure of gases, principally nitrogen (N2) but including all other gases, may cause dissolved gases in the bloodstream to precipitate out, resulting in gas embolism, or bubbles in the bloodstream. The mechanism is the same as that of compressed- air divers on ascent from depth. Symptoms may include the early symptoms of \\"the bends\\"‚Äîtiredness, forgetfulness, headache, stroke, thrombosis, and subcutaneous itching‚Äîbut rarely the full symptoms thereof. Decompression sickness may also be controlled by a full-pressure suit as for altitude sickness. ; Barotrauma : As the aircraft climbs or descends, passengers may experience discomfort or acute pain as gases trapped within their bodies expand or contract. The most common problems occur with air trapped in the middle ear (aerotitis) or paranasal sinuses by a blocked Eustachian tube or sinuses. Pain may also be experienced in the gastrointestinal tract or even the teeth (barodontalgia). Usually these are not severe enough to cause actual trauma but can result in soreness in the ear that persists after the flight and can exacerbate or precipitate pre-existing medical conditions, such as pneumothorax. Cabin altitude An empty bottle, sealed at , is crushed on descent to sea level, compared with one in its original state. The pressure inside the cabin is technically referred to as the equivalent effective cabin altitude or more commonly as the cabin altitude. This is defined as the equivalent altitude above mean sea level having the same atmospheric pressure according to a standard atmospheric model such as the International Standard Atmosphere. Thus a cabin altitude of zero would have the pressure found at mean sea level, which is taken to be . Aircraft In airliners, cabin altitude during flight is kept above sea level in order to reduce stress on the pressurized part of the fuselage; this stress is proportional to the difference in pressure inside and outside the cabin. In a typical commercial passenger flight, the cabin altitude is programmed to rise gradually from the altitude of the airport of origin to a regulatory maximum of . This cabin altitude is maintained while the aircraft is cruising at its maximum altitude and then reduced gradually during descent until the cabin pressure matches the ambient air pressure at the destination. Keeping the cabin altitude below generally prevents significant hypoxia, altitude sickness, decompression sickness, and barotrauma. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations in the U.S. mandate that under normal operating conditions, the cabin altitude may not exceed this limit at the maximum operating altitude of the aircraft. This mandatory maximum cabin altitude does not eliminate all physiological problems; passengers with conditions such as pneumothorax are advised not to fly until fully healed, and people suffering from a cold or other infection may still experience pain in the ears and sinuses. The rate of change of cabin altitude strongly affects comfort as humans are sensitive to pressure changes in the inner ear and sinuses and this has to be managed carefully. Scuba divers flying within the \\"no fly\\" period after a dive are at risk of decompression sickness because the accumulated nitrogen in their bodies can form bubbles when exposed to reduced cabin pressure. The cabin altitude of the Boeing 767 is typically about when cruising at . This is typical for older jet airliners. A design goal for many, but not all, newer aircraft is to provide a lower cabin altitude than older designs. This can be beneficial for passenger comfort. For example, the Bombardier Global Express business jet can provide a cabin altitude of when cruising at . The Emivest SJ30 business jet can provide a sea-level cabin altitude when cruising at .Flight Test: Emivest SJ30 ‚Äì Long- range rocket Retrieved 27 September 2012.SJ30-2, United States of America Retrieved 27 September 2012. One study of eight flights in Airbus A380 aircraft found a median cabin pressure altitude of , and 65 flights in Boeing 747-400 aircraft found a median cabin pressure altitude of . Before 1996, approximately 6,000 large commercial transport airplanes were assigned a type certificate to fly up to without having to meet high-altitude special conditions. In 1996, the FAA adopted Amendment 25-87, which imposed additional high-altitude cabin pressure specifications for new-type aircraft designs. Aircraft certified to operate above \\"must be designed so that occupants will not be exposed to cabin pressure altitudes in excess of after any probable failure condition in the pressurization system\\". In the event of a decompression that results from \\"any failure condition not shown to be extremely improbable\\", the plane must be designed such that occupants will not be exposed to a cabin altitude exceeding for more than 2 minutes, nor to an altitude exceeding at any time. In practice, that new Federal Aviation Regulations amendment imposes an operational ceiling of on the majority of newly designed commercial aircraft. Aircraft manufacturers can apply for a relaxation of this rule if the circumstances warrant it. In 2004, Airbus acquired an FAA exemption to allow the cabin altitude of the A380 to reach in the event of a decompression incident and to exceed for one minute. This allows the A380 to operate at a higher altitude than other newly designed civilian aircraft. Spacecraft Russian engineers used an air-like nitrogen/oxygen mixture, kept at a cabin altitude near zero at all times, in their 1961 Vostok, 1964 Voskhod, and 1967 to present Soyuz spacecraft. This requires a heavier space vehicle design, because the spacecraft cabin structure must withstand the stress of 14.7 pounds per square inch (1 bar) against the vacuum of space, and also because an inert nitrogen mass must be carried. Care must also be taken to avoid decompression sickness when cosmonauts perform extravehicular activity, as current soft space suits are pressurized with pure oxygen at relatively low pressure in order to provide reasonable flexibility.Gatland, p. 134 By contrast, the United States used a pure oxygen atmosphere for its 1961 Mercury, 1965 Gemini, and 1967 Apollo spacecraft, mainly in order to avoid decompression sickness. Mercury used a cabin altitude of ();Gatland, p. 264 Gemini used an altitude of ();Gatland, p. 269 and Apollo used ()Gatland, p. 278, 284 in space. This allowed for a lighter space vehicle design. This is possible because at 100% oxygen, enough oxygen gets to the bloodstream to allow astronauts to operate normally. Before launch, the pressure was kept at slightly higher than sea level at a constant above ambient for Gemini, and above sea level at launch for Apollo), and transitioned to the space cabin altitude during ascent. However, the high pressure pure oxygen atmosphere proved to be a fatal fire hazard in Apollo, contributing to the deaths of the entire crew of Apollo 1 during a 1967 ground test. After this, NASA revised its procedure to use a nitrogen/oxygen mix at zero cabin altitude at launch, but kept the low-pressure pure oxygen atmosphere at in space. After the Apollo program, the United States used standard air-like cabin atmospheres for Skylab,0.3 atm air-like: the Space Shuttle orbiter, and the International Space Station.1 atm Mechanics Pressurization is achieved by the design of an airtight fuselage engineered to be pressurized with a source of compressed air and controlled by an environmental control system (ECS). The most common source of compressed air for pressurization is bleed air extracted from the compressor stage of a gas turbine engine, from a low or intermediate stage and also from an additional high stage; the exact stage can vary depending on engine type. By the time the cold outside air has reached the bleed air valves, it is at a very high pressure and has been heated to around . The control and selection of high or low bleed sources is fully automatic and is governed by the needs of various pneumatic systems at various stages of flight. The part of the bleed air that is directed to the ECS is then expanded to bring it to cabin pressure, which cools it. A final, suitable temperature is then achieved by adding back heat from the hot compressed air via a heat exchanger and air cycle machine known as a PAC (Pressurization and Air Conditioning) system. In some larger airliners, hot trim air can be added downstream of air conditioned air coming from the packs if it is needed to warm a section of the cabin that is colder than others. Boeing 737-800 At least two engines provide compressed bleed air for all the plane's pneumatic systems, to provide full redundancy. Compressed air is also obtained from the auxiliary power unit (APU), if fitted, in the event of an emergency and for cabin air supply on the ground before the main engines are started. Most modern commercial aircraft today have fully redundant, duplicated electronic controllers for maintaining pressurization along with a manual back-up control system. All exhaust air is dumped to atmosphere via an outflow valve, usually at the rear of the fuselage. This valve controls the cabin pressure and also acts as a safety relief valve, in addition to other safety relief valves. If the automatic pressure controllers fail, the pilot can manually control the cabin pressure valve, according to the backup emergency procedure checklist. The automatic controller normally maintains the proper cabin pressure altitude by constantly adjusting the outflow valve position so that the cabin altitude is as low as practical without exceeding the maximum pressure differential limit on the fuselage. The pressure differential varies between aircraft types, typical values are between and . At , the cabin pressure would be automatically maintained at about ( lower than Mexico City), which is about of atmosphere pressure. Some aircraft, such as the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, have re-introduced electric compressors previously used on piston-engined airliners to provide pressurization. The use of electric compressors increases the electrical generation load on the engines and introduces a number of stages of energy transfer;\\"Boeing 787 from the Ground Up\\" therefore, it is unclear whether this increases the overall efficiency of the aircraft air handling system. It does, however, remove the danger of chemical contamination of the cabin, simplify engine design, avert the need to run high pressure pipework around the aircraft, and provide greater design flexibility. Unplanned decompression Passenger oxygen mask deployment Unplanned loss of cabin pressure at altitude/in space is rare but has resulted in a number of fatal accidents. Failures range from sudden, catastrophic loss of airframe integrity (explosive decompression) to slow leaks or equipment malfunctions that allow cabin pressure to drop. Any failure of cabin pressurization above requires an emergency descent to or the closest to that while maintaining the Minimum Safe Altitude (MSA), and the deployment of an oxygen mask for each seat. The oxygen systems have sufficient oxygen for all on board and give the pilots adequate time to descend to below . Without emergency oxygen, hypoxia may lead to loss of consciousness and a subsequent loss of control of the aircraft. Modern airliners include a pressurized pure oxygen tank in the cockpit, giving the pilots more time to bring the aircraft to a safe altitude. The time of useful consciousness varies according to altitude. As the pressure falls the cabin air temperature may also plummet to the ambient outside temperature with a danger of hypothermia or frostbite. For airliners that need to fly over terrain that does not allow reaching the safe altitude within a minimum of 30 minutes, pressurized oxygen bottles are mandatory since the chemical oxygen generators fitted to most planes cannot supply sufficient oxygen. In jet fighter aircraft, the small size of the cockpit means that any decompression will be very rapid and would not allow the pilot time to put on an oxygen mask. Therefore, fighter jet pilots and aircrew are required to wear oxygen masks at all times. On June 30, 1971, the crew of Soyuz 11, Soviet cosmonauts Georgy Dobrovolsky, Vladislav Volkov, and Viktor Patsayev were killed after the cabin vent valve accidentally opened before atmospheric re-entry.

In the late 1910s, attempts were being made to achieve higher and higher altitudes. In 1920, flights well over were first achieved by test pilot Lt. John A. Macready in a Packard-Le P√®re LUSAC-11 biplane at McCook Field in Dayton, Ohio. The flight was possible by releasing stored oxygen into the cockpit, which was released directly into an enclosed cabin and not to an oxygen mask, which was developed later. With this system flights nearing were possible, but the lack of atmospheric pressure at that altitude caused the pilot's heart to enlarge visibly, and many pilots reported health problems from such high altitude flights. Some early airliners had oxygen masks for the passengers for routine flights. In 1921, a Wright- Dayton USD-9A reconnaissance biplane was modified with the addition of a completely enclosed air-tight chamber that could be pressurized with air forced into it by small external turbines. The chamber had a hatch only in diameter that would be sealed by the pilot at . The chamber contained only one instrument, an altimeter, while the conventional cockpit instruments were all mounted outside the chamber, visible through five small portholes. The first attempt to operate the aircraft was again made by Lt. John A. McCready, who discovered that the turbine was forcing air into the chamber faster than the small release valve provided could release it. As a result, the chamber quickly over pressurized, and the flight was abandoned. A second attempt had to be abandoned when the pilot discovered at that he was too short to close the chamber hatch. The first successful flight was finally made by test pilot Lt. Harrold Harris, making it the world's first flight by a pressurized aircraft. The first airliner with a pressurized cabin was the Boeing 307 Stratoliner, built in 1938, prior to World War II, though only ten were produced. The 307's \\"pressure compartment was from the nose of the aircraft to a pressure bulkhead in the aft just forward of the horizontal stabilizer.\\"William A. Schoneberger and Robert R. H. Scholl, Out of Thin Air: Garrett's First 50 Years, Phoenix: Garrett Corporation, 1985 (), p. 275. World War II era flying helmet and oxygen mask World War II was a catalyst for aircraft development. Initially, the piston aircraft of World War II, though they often flew at very high altitudes, were not pressurized and relied on oxygen masks.Some extremely high flying aircraft such as the Westland Welkin used partial pressurization to reduce the effort of using an oxygen mask. This became impractical with the development of larger bombers where crew were required to move about the cabin and this led to the first bomber with cabin pressurization (though restricted to crew areas), the Boeing B-29 Superfortress. The control system for this was designed by Garrett AiResearch Manufacturing Company, drawing in part on licensing of patents held by Boeing for the Stratoliner. Post-war piston airliners such as the Lockheed Constellation (1943) extended the technology to civilian service. The piston engined airliners generally relied on electrical compressors to provide pressurized cabin air. Engine supercharging and cabin pressurization enabled planes like the Douglas DC-6, the Douglas DC-7, and the Constellation to have certified service ceilings from to . Designing a pressurized fuselage to cope with that altitude range was within the engineering and metallurgical knowledge of that time. The introduction of jet airliners required a significant increase in cruise altitudes to the range, where jet engines are more fuel efficient. That increase in cruise altitudes required far more rigorous engineering of the fuselage, and in the beginning not all the engineering problems were fully understood. The world's first commercial jet airliner was the British de Havilland Comet (1949) designed with a service ceiling of . It was the first time that a large diameter, pressurized fuselage with windows had been built and flown at this altitude. Initially, the design was very successful but two catastrophic airframe failures in 1954 resulting in the total loss of the aircraft, passengers and crew grounded what was then the entire world jet airliner fleet. Extensive investigation and groundbreaking engineering analysis of the wreckage led to a number of very significant engineering advances that solved the basic problems of pressurized fuselage design at altitude. The critical problem proved to be a combination of an inadequate understanding of the effect of progressive metal fatigue as the fuselage undergoes repeated stress cycles coupled with a misunderstanding of how aircraft skin stresses are redistributed around openings in the fuselage such as windows and rivet holes. The critical engineering principles concerning metal fatigue learned from the Comet 1 program were applied directly to the design of the Boeing 707 (1957) and all subsequent jet airliners. For example, detailed routine inspection processes were introduced, in addition to thorough visual inspections of the outer skin, mandatory structural sampling was routinely conducted by operators; the need to inspect areas not easily viewable by the naked eye led to the introduction of widespread radiography examination in aviation; this also had the advantage of detecting cracks and flaws too small to be seen otherwise.Jefford, C.G., ed. The RAF and Nuclear Weapons, 1960‚Äì1998. London: Royal Air Force Historical Society, 2001. pp. 123‚Äì125. Another visibly noticeable legacy of the Comet disasters is the oval windows on every jet airliner; the metal fatigue cracks that destroyed the Comets were initiated by the small radius corners on the Comet 1's almost square windows.Davies, R.E.G. and Philip J. Birtles. Comet: The World's First Jet Airliner. McLean, Virginia: Paladwr Press, 1999. . pp. 30‚Äì31.Munson, Kenneth. Civil Airliners since 1946. London: Blandford Press, 1967. p. 155. The Comet fuselage was redesigned and the Comet 4 (1958) went on to become a successful airliner, pioneering the first transatlantic jet service, but the program never really recovered from these disasters and was overtaken by the Boeing 707.Faith, Nicholas. Black Box: Why Air Safety is no Accident, The Book Every Air Traveller Should Read. London: Boxtree, 1996. . p. 72. Even following the Comet disasters, there were several subsequent catastrophic fatigue failures attributed to cabin pressurisation. Perhaps the most prominent example was Aloha Airlines Flight 243, involving a Boeing 737-200. In this case, the principal cause was the continued operation of the specific aircraft despite having accumulated 35,496 flight hours prior to the accident, those hours included over 89,680 flight cycles (takeoffs and landings), owing to its use on short flights;Aloha Airlines Flight 243 incident report - AviationSafety.net, accessed July 5, 2014. this amounted to more than twice the number of flight cycles that the airframe was designed to endure. Aloha 243 was able to land despite the substantial damage inflicted by the decompression, which had resulted in the loss of one member of the cabin crew; the incident had far-reaching effects on aviation safety policies and led to changes in operating procedures. The supersonic airliner Concorde had to deal with particularly high pressure differentials because it flew at unusually high altitude (up to ) and maintained a cabin altitude of . Despite this, its cabin altitude was intentionally maintained at . This combination, while providing for increasing comfort, necessitated making Concorde a significantly heavier aircraft, which in turn contributed to the relatively high cost of a flight. Unusually, Concorde was provisioned with smaller cabin windows than most other commercial passenger aircraft in order to slow the rate of decompression in the event of a window seal failing. The high cruising altitude also required the use of high pressure oxygen and demand valves at the emergency masks unlike the continuous-flow masks used in conventional airliners. The FAA, which enforces minimum emergency descent rates for aircraft, determined that, in relation to Concorde's higher operating altitude, the best response to a pressure loss incident would be to perform a rapid descent. The designed operating cabin altitude for new aircraft is falling and this is expected to reduce any remaining physiological problems. Both the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and the Airbus A350 XWB airliners have made such modifications for increased passenger comfort. The 787's internal cabin pressure is the equivalent of altitude resulting in a higher pressure than for the altitude of older conventional aircraft; according to a joint study performed by Boeing and Oklahoma State University, such a level significantly improves comfort levels. Airbus has stated that the A350 XWB provides for a typical cabin altitude at or below , along with a cabin atmosphere of 20% humidity and an airflow management system that adapts cabin airflow to passenger load with draught-free air circulation. The adoption of composite fuselages eliminates the threat posed by metal fatigue that would have been exacerbated by the higher cabin pressures being adopted by modern airliners, it also eliminates the risk of corrosion from the use of greater humidity levels.

It holds that the Declaration is a natural law document and so that natural law has a place within American jurisprudence. Its main proponents include Harry V. Jaffa and other members of the Claremont Institute. Some proponents claim that Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas is a follower of this school of thought; however, Thomas is more widely considered a member of the strict constructionist school. In Cotting v. Godard, 183 U.S. 79 (1901), the United States Supreme Court stated: :The first official action of this nation declared the foundation of government in these words: \\"We hold these truths to be self evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\\" While such declaration of principles may not have the force of organic law, or be made the basis of judicial decision as to the limits of right and duty, and while in all cases reference must be had to the organic law of the nation for such limits, yet the latter is but the body and the letter of which the former is the thought and the spirit, and it is always safe to read the letter of the Constitution in the spirit of the Declaration of Independence. No duty rests more imperatively upon the courts than the enforcement of those constitutional provisions intended to secure that equality of rights which is the foundation of free government.\\" Proponents claim that the concept is derived from the philosophical structure contained in the Declaration of Independence and assertion that it was the Declaration that revealed the United States as a new emergent nation, the Constitution creating only the federal government. According to this view, the authority to create the Constitution derives from the prior act of nation-creation accomplished by the Declaration. The Declaration declares that the people have a right to alter or abolish any government once it becomes destructive of their natural rights. The turn away from the Articles of Confederation with the ratification of the Constitution was an action of this sort and so the Constitution's authority exists within the legal framework established by the Declaration. The Constitution cannot, then, be interpreted as though it were the foundation of constitutional law, in the absence of principles derived from the Declaration. Though philosophically conservative, Declarationists such as Jaffa have been outspoken critics of originalist construction jurists including Robert Bork, Antonin Scalia, and William Rehnquist, likening them to legal positivists. Bork and legal scholar Lino Graglia have, in turn, critiqued the Declarationist position, retorting that it is single-mindedly obsessive over the Dred Scott decision and resembles a theology rather than a legal doctrine.

Huancavelica () or Wankawilka in Quechua is a city in Peru. It is the capital of the department of Huancavelica and according to the 2017 census had a population of 49,570 people. The city was established on August 5, 1572 by the Viceroy of Peru Francisco de Toledo. Indigenous peoples represent a major percentage of the population. It has an approximate altitude of 3,676 meters; the climate is cold and dry between the months of February and August with a rainy season between September and January. It is considered one of the poorest cities in Peru. Geography The Huancavelica area features a rough geography with highly varied elevation, from 1,950 metres in the valleys to more than 5,000 metres on its snow-covered summits. These mountains contain metallic deposits. They consist of the western chain of the Andes, which includes the Chunta mountain range, formed by a series of hills, the most prominent of which are: Sitaq (5,328m), Wamanrasu (5,298m) and Altar (5,268m). Among the rivers of the region there are the Mantaro, the Pampas, the Huarpa and the Churcampa. The Mantaro River penetrates Huancavelica, forming Tayacaja's Peninsula. Another river that shapes the relief is the Pampas River which is born in the lakes of the high mountains of Huancavelica, Chuqlluqucha and Urququcha. History At the time of Spanish conquest, Huancavelica was known as the Wankawillka region or \\"sacred stone\\". The city itself was established on August 5, 1572. The deposits of Huancavelica were disclosed in 1564, or 1566, by the Indian Nahuincopa to his master Jer√≥nimo Luis de Cabrera. The Spanish Crown appropriated them in 1570 and operated them until Peruvian independence in 1821. Considered the \\"greatest jewel in the crown\\", they eliminated the need to ship mercury from Almad√©n. A miners guild, Gremio de Mineros, administered the mines from 1577 until 1782. Production stopped from 1813 through 1835. In 1915 E.E. Fernandini took over ownership. The area was the most prolific source of mercury in Spanish America, and as such was vital to the mining operations of the Spanish colonial era. Mercury was necessary to extract silver from the ores produced in the silver mines of Peru, as well as those of Potos√≠ in Alto Per√∫ (\\"Upper Per√∫,\\" now Bolivia), using amalgamation processes such as the patio process or pan amalgamation. Mercury was so essential that mercury consumption was the basis upon which the tax on precious metals, known as the quinto real (\\"royal fifth\\"), was levied. The extraction of the quicksilver in the socavones (tunnels) was extremely difficult. Every day before the miners came down, a mass for the dead was celebrated. Due to the need of numerous hand-workers and the high rate of mortality, the Viceroy of Peru Francisco de Toledo resumed and improved the pre-Columbian mandatory service of the mita. The allotted concession were rectangular, about 67x33m. Miners were divided in carreteros and barreteros. Due to the discovery and then the extraction of the azogue (mercury) in a hill close to the actual location of the city, the Santa Barbara mine became famous in the new world and its activity led to the Viceroy of Peru, Francisco de Toledo, to establish the city in 1572 with the name of Villa Rica de Oropesa. In 1648 the Viceroy of Peru, declared that Potos√≠ and Huancavelica were \\"the two pillars that support this kingdom and that of Spain.\\" Moreover, the viceroy thought that Spain could, if necessary, dispense with the silver from Potos√≠, but it could not dispense with the mercury from Huancavelica.Arthur Preston Whitaker, The Huancavelica Mercury Mine: A Contribution to the History of the Bourbon Renaissance in the Spanish Empire, Harvard Historical Monographs 16 (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1941). In the modern times, due to different political and economical events, the city went through a period of decades of lack of progress from the rest of the country. Now, this situation appears to change due to the attention of the recent government administrations. A 1977 recording of a wedding song sung by a young girl from this region was included on the Golden Record carried on board the Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 probes. Geology The principal ore mineral is cinnabar, which occurs within the Cretaceous Gran Farall√≥n sandstones, and fractures found in the Jurassic Pucara and Cretaceous Machay limestones and igneous rocks. Other sulfide minerals occurring with these deposits include pyrite, arsenopyrite and realgar. Caving became top to bottom in 1806 in order to avoid several disasters in previous years. The most infamous one being the Marroquin caving in 1786, which took the lives of over two hundred Indians. Most of the quicksilver was produced from 1571 until 1790, amounting to more than 1,400,000 flasks.  Transportation  Buses run from Huancavelica to Huancayo and Lima by a paved road. There is another road that connects it with the city of Pisco in the coast. Buses depart from the terminal terrestre located in the west side of the city. Huancavelica is serviced by a train which runs between it and Huancayo known as \\"el Tren Macho\\". According to popular saying, this train ‚Äúleaves when it wants and arrives when it can...‚Äù. In 2009, the line between the break-of-gauge at Huancayo to Huancavelica was being converted from gauge to gauge.Trains (magazine), March 2009, p68 By October 2010 it was finished and it is now in service.  Education  Huancavelica is home of the local university, the National University of Huancavelica, which has branches in other cities in the region.http://www.unh.edu.pe/ The region is also home to the University for Andean Development (Universidad para el Desarrollo Andino) located in Lircay, which is a city one hour far from Huancavelica. There are other technical institutes like the Technological High Institute (Instituto Superior Tecnologico) and the Instituto Superior Pedagogico.  Health  The city has one hospital; the Hospital General, that serves the city and the nearby towns. Close to the hospital there is a clinic; the Policlinico EsSalud.  Places of interest  The city has monuments from the times of the colony, most of them are churches in a number of eight, located in different parts of the city, of which the most important is the cathedral located at the main square. Another important site is the former Santa Barbara mine, located about three km. from the city on an ancient road that was famous during colonial times for the extraction of mercury.

(1899). Yale, Her Campus, Class-rooms, and Athletics, p. 445. Early life Day was the son of Rev. Jeremiah and Abigail (Noble) Osborn Day, who were descendants of Robert Day, who came from Ipswich, England in 1634, settled in Newtown Cambridge, Massachusetts, and later became one of the original proprietors of Hartford, Connecticut. He was born in the parish of New Preston, Connecticut, then a part of New Milford, but since 1779, of Washington, where his father was pastor of the Congregational Church.For biography of Jeremiah Day, Sr., see W.B. Sprague's Annals of the American Pulpit, 1857, I, 688 One of the latter's theological pupils, David Hale, brother of Nathan, first instructed Day, and later he continued his preparation for college under John Kingsbury of Waterbury, Connecticut. He entered Yale College in 1789, left because of pulmonary trouble in 1791, reentered in 1793, having taught school in the meantime, and graduated in 1795. While at Yale, he was a member of the Linonian Society. Career Jeremiah Day, Theodore Dwight Woolsey and Benjamin Silliman, left to right, Commencement Day, Yale College, 1860. Steel engraving by John Sartrain Day then succeeded Timothy Dwight IV [q.v.], as principal of the academy which the latter had established at Greenfield Hill, Connecticut, but soon left there to become tutor at Williams College. Two years later Day accepted a similar position at Yale. On 3 June 1800, he was licensed to preach by the New Haven West Association of Ministers. During all this time Day had been suffering from tuberculosis, and in July 1801 a hemorrhage brought on by the exertion of preaching caused him to go to Bermuda where he spent nearly a year. Upon his return Day went to his father's home with little expectation of recovery, but life among the Connecticut hills arrested the disease, and in the summer of 1803 he undertook the duties of the professorship of mathematics and natural philosophy at Yale to which he had been elected shortly after his departure for Bermuda. On 14 January 1805, Day married Martha, the daughter of the Hon. Roger Sherman and Rebecca Minot Prescott, they had one son child Sherman Day and she died in 1806; and on 24 September 1811, Olivia, daughter of Major Daniel and Olive (Tinker) Jones of Hartford, Connecticut. Day was elected an Associate Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1813. For sixty-nine years Day was officially connected with Yale College. On 22 April 1817, he was appointed president, succeeding Timothy Dwight, and was both installed and ordained to the ministry on 23 July. In his seventy-fourth year Day insisted on resigning, but was immediately elected a member of the Corporation, in which office he served until a month before his death, which occurred just after the completion of his ninety-fourth year. In 1835, Day had been urged to become head of Andover Theological Seminary, but had declined. Never strong, and after 1836 subject to attacks of angina pectoris, Day prolonged his life by self-knowledge and moderation in all things. He was a man of dignity and extreme reserve. Although, as described by Timothy Dwight V, the younger, \\"he was a wise disciplinarian, a judicious governor, a thorough and accurate scholar, a valuable teacher, and a man of intelligent and penetrative mind,\\" his influence was due chiefly to his goodness and his reputation for deep wisdom. Day combined serenity, self-control, modesty, and unselfishness in such a degree that all of the 2,500 students who had been under him, according to President Theodore Dwight Woolsey, would have unquestionably declared him the best man they had ever known. As president, Day built slowly on the foundation laid by his predecessor. Stability, conservatism, and great caution were his conspicuous characteristics. Improvements that were made were generally suggested by others. Outside of Connecticut he was known principally through his textbooks. Rockwood. In 1814, Day published An Introduction to Algebra, which went through many editions. This was followed by works on trigonometry, geometry, and the mathematical principles of navigation and surveying. After 1820, Day taught mental and moral philosophy, and in 1838 published An Inquiry Respecting the Self-determining Power of the Will and A Course of Mathematics containing The Principles of Plane Trigonometry, Mensuration, Navigation and Surveying; and in 1841 An Examination of President Edwards's _Inquiry on the Freedom of the Will_. He also contributed numerous articles to periodicals, and published a few sermons. Dat was responsible for the publication of \\"The Yale Report of 1828\\" defending the classical curriculum.

Delany. Nominally space opera, it explores the politics and culture of a future where cyborg technology is universal (the novel is one of the precursors to cyberpunk), yet making major decisions can involve using tarot cards. It has strong mythological overtones, relating to both the Grail Quest and Jason's Argonautica for the golden fleece. Nova was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1969. David Pringle lists it as one of the 100 best science- fiction novels written since World War II. After Delany completed Nova at the age of 25, his published output stopped for several years, although his writing continued. Delany completed the first draft of Tides of Lust (author's title, Equinox) in September 1968 (it appeared in 1973). He first completed Hogg in June 1969 (though the novel itself would not appear until 1995). With the publication of his next major novel, Dhalgren (1975), however, his style had moved on in experimental directions notably different from that of his earlier work. Synopsis By the year 3172, political power in the galaxy is split between two factions: the older Earth-based Draco and the historically younger Pleiades Federation. Both have interests in the even newer Outer Colonies, where mines produce trace amounts of the prized power source Illyrion, the superheavy material essential to starship travel and terraforming planets. Caught in a feud between aristocratic and economically powerful families, a scarred and obsessed captain from the Pleiades, Lorq Von Ray, recruits a disparate crew of misfits to aid him in the race with his arch-enemy, Prince Red from Draco's Red Shift Ltd., to gain economic leadership by securing a vastly greater amount of Illyrion directly from the heart of a stellar nova. In doing so, Von Ray will shift the balance of power of the existing galactic order, which will bring about the downfall of the Red family as well as end Earth's dominance over interstellar politics. As the title indicates, the central metaphor for the novel is a nova: the destructive implosion/explosion of an entire sun, which, paradoxically, while it destroys most of a solar system, also creates new elements. In the book, at the eruption of a nova, not only do the laws of physics break down, but so do the laws of politics and psychology. This idea permeates the entire plot and storyline. The characters follow a quest plot line, in which they visit several worlds to gain information necessary to achieve their goal, all the while pursued by the Red family. Although the novel does not indulge the literary experimentation found in Delany's later books, it maintains a high level of innovation. Some chapters end or begin in mid-sentence. Also, the point of view regularly shifts between Lorq, Katin, and the Mouse. Each page in the book carries a header that gives the year and location of the scene on the page itself (e.g., \\"Draco, Earth, Paris, 3162\\"). This is useful because of the flashbacks in the long journey around the galaxy. Reception Algis Budrys, describing Delany as \\"the best science-fiction writer in the world,\\" praised Nova as \\"highly entertaining to read\\" and commended Delany's integration of his sociopolitical extrapolation into his story, his accomplished characterization, and his \\"virtuosity\\" in presenting the novel's \\"classically posed scientific puzzle.\\"\\"Galaxy Bookshelf\\", Galaxy Science Fiction, January 1969, p.189-92. Characters * Lorq Von Ray. Lorq is the scion of the wealthy Von Ray family, the most powerful clan in the Pleiades Federation. Originally a carefree playboy, Lorq is drawn into his family's feud with the Reds and, as a result, becomes obsessed with finding Illyrion. When Prince Red attacks him at a fabulously opulent party in Paris, he scars Lorq's face badly; but Lorq refuses to remove the scarring and as a result carries an air of menace. As the book unfolds, Lorq learns that his family was founded by pirates, who killed members of the Red family in previous generations in order to keep the Pleiades free of Earth-based corporations, although Lorq's ancestors did so with the support of the Pleiades' citizens. The Reds, however, still carry a grudge. Although Lorq Von Ray is described as looking between forty-five and fifty years old, according to the dates in the book he is barely thirty. This may have been a mathematical mistake on Delany's part: in the book's first edition there are several such errors, such as the numbering of the centuries: the year 1850 is in the middle of the nineteenth century, not the eighteenth. The year 2375 is in the middle of the twenty-fourth century, not the twenty-third. But these mistakes have been corrected in more recent editions. A possible explanation for Lorq's age is the Mouse's speculation that Lorq is \\"aged, not old\\". He has a Norwegian father and a Senegalese mother from Earth. * The Mouse. This is the nickname for Pontichos Provechi, a young Gypsy from Earth, who, by age 18, has led an extremely varied life, and is just beginning to work in a starship navigation crew. He also entertains people by creating illusions and music with his \\"sensory syrynx\\" (a sound, scent, and hologram projector). * Katin Crawford. Katin is an intellectual from Earth's moon, who received a liberal arts education at Harvard University and who has worked till now at a series of unfulfilling clerical positions. Katin is a loner. His passion is to explore various moons across the Solar System. He also aspires to write a novel, for which he constantly records notes, although the form is obsolete by the time Nova takes place. The word \\"novel\\" is, incidentally, etymologically related to the word \\"nova.\\" Both come from the Latin novum, which means \\"something new.\\" Sometimes Katin annoys his colleagues by going off on long lectures on any number of topics; in this capacity, he is sometimes comic, even while acting as the novel's expository voice. * Sebastian and Ty√ø. This wandering, working couple consists of Sebastian, a powerful-looking man who is nonetheless gentle‚Äîhe keeps a number of unusual pets with him, his \\"flapping black gillies\\"‚Äîand his companion, Ty√ø, a quiet mysterious woman and tarot-card reader. Like many of Delany's characters, Sebastian is racially mixed: Although he has Asian features, his hair is naturally blond. Both are from the Pleiades and consider it an honor to work for the Von Ray family. * Lynceos and Idas. These twin brothers are of African descent, but one is an albino. Eventually we learn they are two members of a set of triplets. Having been born and grown up in the Outer Colonies, all three brothers had a tendency to use drugs and make mischief. As a result of one of their pranks, they ended in a type of indentured servitude and were forced to work in the colonies' Illyrion mines. (Such arrangements are common at that time to \\"recruit\\" workers for the mines.) The two talk in tandem. Jokingly Katin calls them a pair of \\"glorified salt and pepper shakers.\\" Their names come from the twins who were among Jason's crew in his ancient quest for the fleece. Lynceos means lynx-like, i.e., sharp-eyed. Idas suggests someone from the pleasant fields of Mt. Ida. * Prince Red. The scion of the Earth- based Red family, Prince was born with only one arm. In place of the other, he wears an artificial limb, which has unnatural strength. Its grip can compress sand into quartz crystals, which he can throw with the force of bullets. A troublemaker from birth (in his youth, he was forced constantly to shift schools because of discipline problems), he detests Lorq for numerous reasons, some of which he is not consciously aware of. Because of the power his artificial arm gives him, Prince can become extremely violent if anyone so much as mentions his deformity. As a little boy he sprains Lorq's mother's wrist when, innocently, she asks for his hand to take him home when he has gotten into mischief after dark with the other children. * Ruby Red. Prince's younger sister, Ruby, is a quiet-spoken woman, who appears to be completely under Prince's control. As an adolescent, Lorq falls in love with her, but she rebuffs him because of their families' hostile histories. Prince appears to have an unhealthy attachment to his sister‚Äîwhich, often, she seems to reciprocate. While their father, Aaron, is still alive at the time of the novel and in charge of the Red's vast industrial holdings, Prince and Ruby are the most visible members of the Red clan. * Dan. An Australian drifter whom Lorq first meets while the man is hitchhiking, Dan is the first to suggest to Lorq how a nova might be a source for Illyrion. Unfortunately, by the beginning of the novel, an accident on the first mission has damaged his senses and probably his sanity. He kills himself soon into the book, and most of his appearances take place in flashbacks. The book's third chapter (of seven) is basically a long flashback that shows Lorq and Prince's childhoods and the political background against which the story takes place. Lorq first meets Prince and Ruby when they are all youngsters, during an attempt by their parents to end the feud between the families. The meeting ends, however, in disaster and embarrassment, and the fundamentally cruel natures of both Prince and his father Aaron‚Äîas well as the senior Von Ray's innate love of violence‚Äîbecome clear. Motifs Nova has a number of character motifs in common with Delany's later literary and literary-pornographic works: the Mouse, a damaged artist who wears one shoe as does the Kid in the later Dhalgren; Katin, an intellectual and writer who attempts to record the events around him; the twins Lynceos and Idas, one black, the other albino; and Dan, a barefoot derelict, with a rope holding up his pants. The novel, storyline, and themes of Nova are multilayered and complex, and lend themselves to numerous interpretations. As the critic Judith Merrill wrote at the book's publication: ::Here are (at least some of) the ways you can read Nova: As fast-action far-flung interstellar adventure; as archetypal mystical/mythical allegory (in which the Tarot and the Grail both figure prominently); as modern myth told in the SF idiom . . . The reader observes, recollects, or participates in a range of personal human experience including violent pain and disfigurement, sensory deprivation and overload, man-machine communion, the drug experience, the creative experience ‚Äì and interpersonal relationships which include incest and assassination, father-son, leader-follower, human- pet, and lots more.‚Äô‚ÄôJudith Merril, \\"Books\\", F&SF;, November 1968, p. 43-46.(Judith Merril, 1968). Space opera Nova takes place in a standard space opera setting with many of the features and tropes peculiar to the genre. Conscientiously the novel emulates many earlier and popular science fiction works. Delany makes an offhand reference to Isaac Asimov's Foundation trilogy (a random planet is named \\"Trantor\\"). Additionally, in one scene, a character has a false tooth with poison hidden in it, a classical trope from many espionage stories, which Frank Herbert's Dune had employed three years before. (Unlike in Dune, in Nova it doesn't work.) There is also a strong similarity in names between the scientist, Ashton Clark, who, in Nova, has invented the cyborg plugs and sockets centuries before, which pervade the novel, and the name of the fantasy and science fiction writer from the 'thirties and 'forties, Clark Ashton Smith. Prince's ability to squeeze sand into glass and quartz fragments strongly parallels the power of many action heroes (most notably Superman), and the idea of aristocratic families feuding in space is found in numerous other space opera novels. The character of Katin is partially written to resemble the classic \\"bore\\" in science fiction literature‚Äîa character who constantly gives lectures and explanations to describe the universe of the book. In Nova, however, Katin is constantly ridiculed for filling this role and on occasion is used for comic relief. In keeping with this sort of game-playing, in a scene that takes place in a vast museum, the Alkane, in the city of Phoenix on the planet Vorpis, at one point Lorq and Katin hurry through the \\"FitzGerald Salon,\\" clearly based on the actual \\"Rubens Salon\\" in the Louvre Museum in Paris‚Äîafter the \\"Mona Lisa\\" and the \\"Raft of the Medusa,\\" probably the Louvre's most impressive holdings. The artist Russell FitzGerald was a good friend of Delany's and did a number of book and magazine covers for him (including the cover for the first edition of Nova and the cover for the Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction edition of \\"We, in Some Strange Power's Employ, Move on a Rigorous Line\\" [1968]) and the three covers for the English paperback edition of the three volumes of Delany's Fall of the Towers trilogy. He is thanked at the beginning of Nova, along with their mutual friend, the poet Helen Adam, for helping with \\"Grail and Tarot lore.\\" FitzGerald had a basement studio on East 2nd Street in New York City's East Village, modeled after a similar studio used by the Victorian artist and illustrator Aubrey Beardsley and known to FitzGerald's friends as \\"the Black Studio.\\" There FitzGerald worked on a series of large canvases similar in size to the ones by Rubens that line the walls of the Rubens Salon. Delany often visited the Black Studio and even worked there on Nova in his notebook, while FitzGerald worked on his great hyperreal paintings, the two of them drinking white wine together. The museum lamp in Nova that allows paintings to be viewed under the same order of light in which they were created grew out of their studio conversations. Eventually FitzGerald did an entire tarot deck, which his friends referred to as \\"the Nova tarot.\\" FitzGerald and \\"the Black Studio\\" are the model for the character \\"Proctor\\" and his studio‚Äîand the art objects contained in it‚Äîin Delany's novel Equinox (1973). For many years Delany hoped that a FitzGerald painting called G√∂tterd√§marung, which he'd painted over the same months as Delany wrote Nova, would eventually make a color cover for the novel. Alas, it never happened. Those interested in FitzGerald's colorful bisexual life can learn more about him in the biography of the San Francisco poet Jack Spicer, Poet Be Like God (Weslyan University Press; Hanover: 1998), by Lewis Ellingham and Kevin Killian. By the time FitzGerald and his wife and family left New York for Vancouver, B.C., the building housing the Black Studio had been taken over by the New York chapter of the Hells Angels (with whom FitzGerald was on good terms), who stayed on there for many years afterward. The tarot and the grail Within the future society, reading the Tarot is considered both scientific and accurate. The Mouse is actually ridiculed as old-fashioned and uneducated for his skepticism about such things. Much of the story revolves around a tarot reading Ty√ø gives Lorq at the beginning of the second mission, in which she rather successfully predicts the stakes and outcome. For example, The Tower appears, indicating that a powerful family (presumably the Reds or Von Rays) will fall, and the large number of pentacles indicates wealth. Prince and Ruby are represented by the King of Swords and the Queen of Swords, respectively. An anomaly in the reading, however, occurs when Ty√ø drops The Sun‚Äîwhich Lorq considered to represent a nova‚Äîand the Mouse pockets it, thus making it impossible for Ty√ø's reading to include this card. Smaller Tarot readings dot the rest of the novel. As a young child, Lorq receives a reading indicating a death in his family: within a month, his Uncle Morgan is assassinated. Likewise, Lorq's Aunt Cyana (Morgan's widow) has Lorq choose a single Tarot card for insight: it is The Hanged Man, reversed, indicating that Lorq will succeed in his quest, but at a very high price. Delany makes it clear that the Tarot should not be used for outright prediction. As Katin tells the highly skeptical Mouse: \\"[T]he cards don't actually predict anything. They simply propagate an educated commentary on present situations[.]\\" (Nova, 112). \\"[Tarot cards] only become superstitious when they are abused, employed to direct rather than guide and suggest.\\" (Nova, 113) But, as the plot develops, sometimes it's difficult to distinguish clearly between useful \\"guiding\\" and abusive (superstitious) \\"directing.\\" The story of scarred Captain Von Ray's obsessive quest for a nova with his crew of outcasts recalls Melville's tale of wounded Captain Ahab's search for the white whale in Moby-Dick. (In a 1971 article about the current state of Science Fiction, Time Magazine writer R. Z. Shepherd wrote, \\"[Nova] suggests Moby-Dick at a strobe-light show.\\") In Nova, the events are interpreted by Katin as a quest for the Holy Grail, with Illyrion playing the part of the Grail itself. As in the Grail story, there is a failed attempt to gain it, and someone must make a major self-sacrifice (in Nova, his sanity and senses) in order to succeed. Katin is constantly trying to find a plot for his novel, and finally decides to use Lorq's adventures with Prince and Ruby‚Äîimmediately noticing the correspondences with the Grail archetype. By the end of the novel, it becomes clear that Nova is the book Katin will eventually write. Creativity, art, change, and stagnation Although the novel takes place in the 32nd century, the society within it is described as highly stagnant, even taking into account the spread of interstellar travel and cyborging. Often, however, the book suggests that those minor characters who repeatedly make this judgment are simply looking for symptoms of change and vitality in the wrong parts of society‚Äîa theme Nova shares with Alfred Bester's The Stars My Destination. Cyana Von Ray Morgan, who is Lorq's aunt and a curator at humanity's largest museum, remarks that one-fourth of the displays at her museum are devoted to the Twentieth century, much the way major museums in Europe and the United States for the last hundred or so years might seem‚Äîto some‚Äîto have devoted a disproportionate amount of their space to Greek and Roman artifacts. She justifies this by saying that, despite all the progress made by mankind, the Twentieth Century encompasses the greatest change in humanity's fundamental situation: \\"At the beginning of that amazing century, mankind was many societies living on one world; at its end, it was basically what we are now: an informatively unified society that lived on several worlds.\\" (Nova, 156) In short, within the fictional future of Nova, humanity began to colonize space by the end of the Twentieth Century. A few centuries later, and cyborg implants were invented. The combination of increasingly cheaper Illyrion (the fuel of starships) and universally adaptable implants has created, by the time of the novel, a highly mobile and transient work force and population. This mobile population has a drawback, however. In a pseudo-intellectual argument raised throughout the novel, characters make reference to a \\"lack of cultural solidarity\\" (a concept that vaguely resembles the idea of cultural capital). Because the population is constantly on the move, there is no shared culture, nor have there been any successful attempts to create new broad-based artistic and cultural movements since the end of the Twentieth Century. Characters make frequent references to 20th century culture: at Prince's party in Paris (which takes place in the year 3162), a group of entertainers start performing a song by The Mamas & the Papas. Katin makes an offhand remark that indicates the board game Monopoly (which was invented during the early 20th century) is still in existence, and has even been adapted to the future society. When he needs to name a \\"Renaissance Man,\\" Katin mentions Bertrand Russell, despite the passage of more than a millennium since Russell died. In Cyana Morgan's museum, in addition to the predominance of Twentieth Century-based exhibits, within a hall of paintings, Katin notices that many of the works share the same subjects‚Äîand, in many cases, the same names‚Äîeven though the tags clearly indicate the paintings were created centuries apart, and on different planets. The most famous art collection in the museum is actually a forgery of an existing set of works, and the forgeries are considered more popular and valuable than the originals. A main interest of the book‚Äîunusual for a science fiction novel‚Äîis the two approaches to art characterized by the Mouse and Katin. In playing on his sensory syrynx, the Mouse is spontaneous, improvisatory, highly personal and immediately emotional. While he uses whatever material is around him as the basis for his art, the Mouse's creations on his syrynx are, however beautiful, ephemeral and disposable. In Nietzsche's terms, he is a Dionysian artist. Katin on the other hand is (again in Nietzsche's terms) an Apollonian artist. He is deeply intellectual, highly theoretical, largely impersonal, and concerned with the richness and complexity of the statement his artwork will make in terms of history. The irony of his approach is that, for all the hundreds of thousands of words he has dictated into his recorder about his theory of what the novel should be and do, he is still looking for a subject‚Äîa story‚Äîthat is important enough in historical terms to stand up under all his theorizing. When the Mouse's approach gets out of control, as the novel dramatizes in one climactic sequence, the instruments of art become murderous weapons. When Katin's approach gets out of hand, the result is paralysis and silence. The conclusion the Mouse arrives at to Katin's problem‚Äîand for the reader appreciating the book on this level, it should be no surprise‚Äîis that Lorq's quest itself, which will revise the power structure of the entire galaxy, is the historically proper subject for Katin's novel, at the same time that Katin realizes he must learn how to employ some of the Mouse's immediacy, spontaneity, and energy. It does not hurt that, by the end of Nova, Lorq's quest has achieved the shape of a classical tragedy: Lorq has had to sacrifice his senses in the same way that Dan‚Äîat the start of the book‚Äîhas already lost his; and in the way that the Mouse has been so afraid might happen to him. In many ways the novel is about perception itself‚Äîits value, its pleasures, the information it allows us to access, the sense it allows us to make of the rich and colorful social universe. The novel refers repeatedly to a historic \\"Vega Republic,\\" presumably among the worlds circling the star Vega, which flourished several centuries prior to the novel's beginning. At one point, apparently, the Republic staged an uprising and attempted to declare both political and cultural autonomy from Earth. During those years the Vegans created a new and different style in furniture, fabrics, and architecture. Many of their artists, musicians, and writers produced highly distinctive work that, in later years, caught the imagination of intellectuals in both Draco and the Pleiades. Before Nova begins, however, the Vega Republic uprising was violently suppressed, and Katin claims that the ability to identify remnants of Vegan culture has become nothing but an intellectual \\"parlor game.\\" As the quest continues, soon Lorq drops the rationalizations for the Red/Von Ray vendetta, except for the fact that his actions, for better or worse, will produce a major cultural shift in humanity, even though nobody can tell what that change will be, or if it will be a positive or negative one. Race The story's main character, Lorq, is Afropean. His father is of Norwegian descent, and his Earth-born mother is Senegalese. The residents of the Pleiades Federation (and the Outer Colonies) overall are an extremely mixed racial population. In addition to appearances, characters from the Pleiades sometimes have names that indicate a mixed racial heritage. For example, one of Lorq's childhood friends is named ‚ÄúYorgos Satsumi,‚Äù which contains a clearly Japanese last name, but a first name that is decidedly Greek. This is in sharp contrast to the Earth-centered Draco society, where the leaders tend to be uniformly Caucasian. Individuals from Earth also tend to have extremely \\"WASPish\\" names. For example, a character named \\"Brian\\" is eventually revealed (at least, in the 2002 edition) to have the full name \\"Brian Anthony Sanders.\\" Moreover, according to the Mouse, Earth still has problems with racism: he recalls seeing Gypsies lynched when he was younger. Ironically, although this racial diversity is considered one of the novel's most innovative features, at the time of its first publication (1968), the inclusion of minority characters proved to be a liability due to the racism ingrained in American culture at the time (see Publishing Status below). Man and machine, society and alienation The society of Nova is in a pre-revolutionary state. Economic tensions have created a feud between the \\"new money\\" Von Ray family and the \\"old money\\" Red family, both of whom have a large stake in intergalactic transportation. Shortly before the novel's events (within the lifetime of Lorq's father), the Pleiades region achieved political autonomy from Earth/Draco, and is now an independent federation. At the time of the novel, citizens of the Outer Colonies are beginning to support the idea of independence as well. In a passage in Chapter Three, the elder Von Ray interprets the tensions in terms of social class, with each major galactic region representing one of the three traditional social classes: * The Draco Empire, centered on Earth, was the earliest area to be colonized. As such, this colonization was largely controlled and subsidized by large governments and corporations from Earth (most notably, Red Shift Ltd.). Because of this, Draco is largely controlled by the upper class, which retains strong cultural and economic ties to Earth. * The Pleiades Federation was founded, according to Lorq's father, by a \\"comparatively middle class\\" movement, primarily individuals and small businesses that wished to cut ties from Earth and maintain their independence. The main reason for this was that, although the region as a whole was far from Draco, its many habitable planets are located relatively close to each other, resulting in much cheaper transportation costs. The citizens were so dedicated to keeping out Earth influence that they hired Lorq's great-great grandfather (the founder of the Von Ray clan) to kill any representative of Earth-based megacorporations who tried to stake a claim. As a result, the Pleiades remained distant from Draco, and eventually declared independence without much Earth-based interference. * The Outer Colonies were colonized solely because of the prospects of Illyrion mining, as the worlds within the region are not particularly hospitable to human habitation. Because of this, large companies subsidized the migration of mine workers to the region, often using trickery, dubious legal measures, and false promises. As a result, the Outer Colonies are almost entirely populated by men and women from the working class and lower classes, who had few other prospects. One thing all characters have in common is their cyborging. Individuals who cannot or will not accept these implants are effectively removed from society. The Mouse, for instance, mentions that his people (the Gypsies) refused the implants and, as a result, were treated with intolerance and even killed on Earth. Prince's anger over his artificial arm, while irrational on the surface, is eventually hypothesized to have been caused by its effect on his ability to cyborg. Generally, a person has a total of five implants, two of which are located in the wrists. Since Prince was born with only one arm, he cannot fully connect himself with a machine. Although the society seems on the edge of a revolution (or some other unspecified major change), the future of the novel is optimistic. As Katin reveals in one of his expository monologues, the problem of labor alienation has been overcome through the use of technology: practically all humans have cyborg socket implants that allow them to interface directly with the machines they use. These sockets are highly adaptable. Characters plug them into everything from small vacuum cleaners to the navigational systems of starships. By directly interfacing with the machines, workers are able to identify with their work, and the result is greater psychological wellbeing and less labor alienation. Sex and incest Nova was written prior to Delany's turn to sexuality as a major focus of his work.Samuel R. Delany#Themes Nevertheless, the novel suggests several sexual subtexts. In the same way that a homoerotic current informs the relationship Melville describes between Captain Ahab and the cabin boy Pip in Moby-Dick, a similar undercurrent vibrates through the scenes between Captain Von Ray and the Mouse. Throughout the novel, the intelligent and beautiful Ruby remains both loyal and subservient to her brother, Prince, even to the extent of going against her own feelings. Their relationship strongly suggests an incestuous nature. Prince refuses to allow her to interact with Lorq. In turn, Ruby maintains a close emotional attachment to Prince, one that, in a suggestive scene near the novel's end, proves disastrous. Assassination, pain, and violence In Nova, a culturally iconic political assassination has taken place. The advanced technology at the time allowed millions of people throughout the universe to experience the sensations and emotions of the victim (Secretary Morgan, the leader of the Pleiades Federation) as he died‚Äîand, directly afterwards, the emotions of his widow (and Lorq Von Ray's aunt), Cyana Von Ray Morgan. The murder was brutal: Morgan was publicly garroted at his second inauguration, and almost decapitated. Although the assassination was eventually revealed to be the work of a single man, (\\"Underwood\\"), for a period of time afterwards, many popular conspiracy theories were developed. To deal with her grief‚Äîand that of Pleiades citizens‚ÄîCyana Morgan adopted an extremely stoic posture and slowly retreated from the public eye. This death is clearly a dramatic rewriting of the November 1963 \\"televised\\" assassination of President John F. Kennedy in Dallas, Texas, which had taken place only five years before Nova was published. Cyana Von Ray Morgan, the widow, strongly resembles Kennedy's wife Jacqueline Bauvier Kennedy in her responses, her appearance, and her interest in art. Lorq, Prince, and Ruby‚Äîall heirs of wealthy clans who grew up in luxury‚Äîlive what Lorq refers to as \\"meaningless\\" lives, indulging in sex, expensive hobbies (e.g. space-yacht racing), and partying. Lorq's transformation begins when, in a physical fight, Prince scars Lorq's face deeply with his artificial hand. Later in the novel, both Lorq and the Mouse attack Prince and Ruby, causing them great pain. As the novel nears completion, Ruby remarks that, prior to that event, neither she nor her brother had a true concept of what pain was really like; neither of them truly fathomed the importance of their actions and the feud until they were personally hit by it. Practically all the socially powerful characters have violent natures, which often they try to hide or repress. Despite the elder Von Rays' attempts to end the feud, make peace with Aaron Red, and have their children become friends, the Von Rays cannot escape the fact that the family wealth and status were based on piracy and murder. Although outwardly Aaron Red appears harmless (he is described as bald, portly, and easily embarrassed) and he seems to be friends with members of the Von Ray family, events can bring out his natural violence and reveal him as an abusively indulgent father. The novel hints at these buried emotions, when, for example, the Von Ray and Red families meet in the Outer Colonies at a reconciliatory reception. Seven-year-old Prince uses his artificial arm and its strength to kill Lorq's mother's pet bird in front of Lorq and Ruby. Later that night, the adults leave to watch the future equivalent of a cock fight, but with winged reptiles rather than roosters. The novel's violence gathers force in an unexpected eruption from Prince against Lorq at his party in Paris; much of the novel tries to explain the origins of this rage. Both rage and pain are eventually recognized by the mature characters to have been a necessary component of their lives. Lorq realizes that, without Prince's attack to 'wake him up,' he would have gone on with a carefree life; he maintains his scar as a reminder of this. The successful completion of Lorq's quest has an extremely painful outcome for Lorq personally. As well, now that the need for Illyrion mines is gone, we know, the Outer Colonies will collapse socially and economically. The Red heirs fought for the status quo; only near the end of the novel do they experience the pain that goes along with the realization of what Lorq is trying to do. Nova's influence Nova is considered one of the major forerunners of the cyberpunk movement. It prefigures, for instance, cyberpunk's staple trope of human interfacing with computers via implants. While the New Wave of science fiction was concentrating on near-future science fiction stories and the highly subjective exploration of \\"inner space,\\" in 1968, the year it was published, Nova seemed a deliberate throw-back to traditional space opera‚Äîand space opera at its grandest and most operatic. While reviews in the American professional science fiction magazines, The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction and Galaxy, by Judith Merril and Algis Budrys, respectively, were highly praiseful, the review in the New Wave outlet, England's New Worlds, by M. John Harrison, while acknowledging the skill and energy with which it had been written, called the book a \\"waste of time and talent.\\" The novel has always been popular with readers, many of whom have found it, for all its social subtleties, a roller-coaster of a read; but it took a decade-and-a-half for cyberpunk writers and readers to begin praising its handling of drugs, tarot cards, and its off-hand presentation of racial variety, its narrative energy and sense of historical sweep, and finally its exploration of the relationship between politics and art‚Äîindeed, for the cyberpunk writers it soon became an iconic text. Characters like the Mouse, Lynceos, Idas, Ty√ø, Sebastian, and even Katin can be seen as hippies, with itinerant lifestyles and drugs. As well, the design and effect of the Mouse's sensory syrynx has an overall feel of an expanded 1960s light show, of the sort that had then begun to accompany traditional rock concerts. Writer William Gibson claimed to be greatly influenced by Delany, and his novel Neuromancer includes allusions to Nova. While Delany's vision of the future is optimistic, however, the cyberpunk movement has a distinctly dystopic outlook. Gibson's novel includes a character, Peter Riviera, introduced (like the Mouse) in Istanbul, with the same holographic projection powers (although via implants) as the Mouse in Nova; but Gibson's character is a psychopath. Likewise, Gibson includes a character who awkwardly wears only one shoe; this character (Ashpool) is an insane killer. Several episodes of \\"Futurama\\" feature the \\"holophoner,\\" a musical instrument that is very difficult to play, and projects holographic imagery to accompany the music. Publishing status Cover of 2002 paperback edition. Despite its status, reputation, and influence on science-fiction as a genre, for a dozen years after 1990 (the date of Bantam Books' final 14th printing), Nova was out of print. Hardcover copies were highly prized. Not until 2002 did Vintage Books rerelease it. Over the years before Nova appeared, Delany had already won the Nebula Award twice for best science fiction novel of the year: Babel-17 had gained the award in 1967 (in a tie for best novel of 1966 with Daniel Keyes's Flowers for Algernon, a.k.a. Charly). The Einstein Intersection won him the award the following year in 1968 (for best novel of 1967). While awaiting publication by Doubleday, Nova was submitted to Analog editor John W. Campbell for potential serialization. Campbell rejected the novel, saying in a telephone conversation with Delany's agent that, though he'd enjoyed the book, he did not feel his magazine's readership \\"would be able to relate to a black main character.\\"\\"Racism and Science Fiction\\", Samuel R. Delany, The New York Review of Science Fiction, August 1998 Because there was no magazine serialization, however, in its first six months the novel did not get the initially wide exposure to readers that might have helped gain it a Hugo Award‚Äîthough it was nominated and soon regularly referred to as \\"the perfect science fiction novel\\". In the pages of Galaxy Magazine (Analog's rival), the August after it appeared, resident critic Algis Budrys would write, \\"Samuel R. Delany, right now, as of this book, Nova, not as of some future book or some accumulated body of work, is the best science-fiction writer in the world, at a time when competition for that status is intense. I don't see how a writer can do more than wring your heart while explaining how it works. No writer can\\"‚Äîheady praise for the work of a young man completed before his twenty-sixth birthday. The Vintage edition of the novel corrects some minor mistakes in the original version. It also adds an entire passage that does not appear in any of the older published versions. In the Vintage edition, Delany includes a passage in which Prince Red brags about how he is responsible for the death of Brian, a character who disappears, in earlier editions, after a single chapter. In the Vintage edition, toward the end of the book Prince describes how, using his wealth and power, and with no more provocation than a careless comment Brian once made about Prince's arm, Prince systematically destroyed Brian's life, until Brian became homeless and died of exposure. Prince claims that he has killed some two dozen others in a similar manner for similar reasons. This passage significantly alters Prince's characterization. In earlier editions, the worst that could be said of Prince is that he had been \\"spoiled\\" and had a violent temper. The new material turns him into a remorseless murderer and adds a moral component to Lorq's quest absent in the earlier versions. If Prince defeats Lorq, the most powerful man in the galaxy will be a psychopathic killer. The above passage is in the original typescript of Nova, however. It is also in Delany's handwritten version of the novel in his notebooks from 1967. Both are in the Delany Holdings on store in the Howard Gottlieb Archives at the Mugar Memorial Library of Boston University. Initially the writer omitted it before publication of the first edition, when a friend who had read the manuscript found that section too extreme. In later years Delany decided to return it to the novel, because he felt readers needed to know what happened to Brian, after he seems to vanish from the book. Additionally, in the first edition of Nova it is unclear whether or not Lorq's parents are still alive by the time the novel ends: When Lorq begins his quest, his mother is already dying of a degenerative disorder, but at the end he makes no mention of them, nor does he try to contact them. However, in another (much briefer) passage added in the Vintage Books edition, related to the above, Lorq has a memory that implies both of his parents and Aaron Red (as did Dan and Brian) died during the past ten years. This is in neither the original typescript nor in the notebook version, and is a true addition.

It is the capital of the Tumbes Region, as well as of Tumbes Province and Tumbes District. Located near the border with Ecuador, Tumbes has 111,595 inhabitants as of 2015. It is served by the Cap. FAP Pedro Canga Rodriguez Airport. It is located on the Gulf of Guayaquil along with Zorritos. History Tumbes Cathedral Tumbes has its origins back in pre-Inca times when it was inhabited by a cultural group of natives called Tumpis. At its peak, its population is estimated to have reached 178,000. After 1400, Inca Pachacuti ruled over Tumbes and the territory became an important political stronghold during the Inca Empire. Later Inca emperor Huayna Capac expanded Tumbes by ordering the construction of roads, houses and palaces. Spanish invasion Tumbes was first visited by Spanish conquistador Francisco Pizarro during the start of the Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire in 1528.Prescott, W.H., 2011, The History of the Conquest of Peru, Digireads.com Publishing, Molina noted that Tumbes was a well organized town. Pizarro made a second expedition in 1532 during which he encountered resistance from the curaca (chieftain) Chilimaza in what became known as the Battle of the Manglares. Pizarro was eventually successful and is said to have planted a cross in the invaded territory as a sign of Hispanic victory. Felipillo and Yacan√©, the first South American Indigenous interpreters who later aided Pizarro and his followers during the conquest of Peru, were born in Tumbes. Colony and independence Port Pizzarro During its colonial period, Tumbes was sparsely populated and formed a part of the Audiencia of Quito through an unmodified Cedula of 1563 and Cedula of 1740. When Tumbes declared its independence from Spain, it opted to join Peru believing in the right of free determination of peoples. First, the Republic of the Gran Colombia challenged that right and then Ecuador claiming de jure rights through unmodified colonial Royal Decrees ( Real C√©dulas ), but to no avail. The Protocol of Rio de Janeiro signed in 1942 with Ecuador legally confirmed Peru's previously de facto rights over Tumbes after a victorious war. However, lasting peace between both countries was not achieved until 1998, after a final conflict in 1995. Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori and Ecuadorian Presidente Jamil Mahuad signed a final document in which Ecuador accepted Per√∫'s right over Tumbes and other territories claimed by Ecuador until then. Geography=Climate The city has a warm semi- arid climate, with an average annual precipitation of 307.5 mm (12.1 in).

They are commonly referred to as the Vogels. Name Sir Julius Vogel, 8th Prime Minister of New Zealand. The awards are named for Sir Julius Vogel, a prominent New Zealand journalist and politician, who was Premier of New Zealand twice during the 1870s. He also, in 1889, wrote what is widely regarded as New Zealand's first science fiction novel, Anno Domini 2000, or, Woman's Destiny.\\"Curiosities: Anno Domini 2000; or Woman's Destiny by Julius Vogel\\" by Lucy Sussex, Fantasy and Science Fiction, December 2008, page 162. The book, written and published in Great Britain after Vogel had moved from New Zealand, pictured a New Zealand in the year 2000 where most positions of authority were held by women‚Äîat the time of writing, a radical proposition. In 2000, New Zealand's Head of State, Governor General, Prime Minister, Chief Justice and Attorney General were all women, as was the CEO of one of the country's largest companies, Telecom. History National awards have been presented annually since 1989, but were initially simply known as the New Zealand Science Fiction Fan Awards, and were originally aimed primarily at fandom rather than at professional science fiction. In these early years the awards were organised on an ad-hoc basis by the organising committees of the national conventions, though with the support of the former national fan organisation, the National Association for Science Fiction which nominally ran the awards from 1993. In the early 1990s the awards were briefly known as the Edmund Bayne Awards, after a well-known Wellington fan who had been killed in a road accident, but this name was never formalised. In 2002 the awards were revamped and reorganised, and since that time have been aimed more at the professional science fiction and fantasy community. The current name also dates to 2002. These changes accompanied a change in the organisation of the awards, which are now formally run by national organisation SFFANZ (the Science Fiction and Fantasy Association of New Zealand). Categories change to some extent on an annual basis, but generally include professional awards for best novel, short story, dramatic presentation, and services to science fiction, as well as equivalent fan awards. Due to the size of New Zealand's science fiction, fantasy, and horror fiction communities, the awards cover all three of these frequently intertwined genres and attempt to treat each equally.

It was previously classified in the bunting and American sparrow family, Emberizidae. It breeds from southern Mexico through Central America, and South America as far as northern Chile, Argentina and Paraguay, and on Trinidad and Tobago. It is the only member of the genus Volatinia.  Description  Adult blue-black grassquits are long and weigh . They have a slender conical black bill. The male is glossy blue-black, with a black tail and wings; the white inner underwing is visible in flight or display. Female and immature birds have brown upperparts and dark-streaked buff underparts.  Behavior  Social monogamous, extra-pair fertilizations, intraspecific parasitism, and quasi-parasitism are commonly found. During the breeding season, males defend small territories, about 13,0 - 72,5 m2, dominant males are normally lighter. The male has a jumping display, often performed for long periods, which gives rise to the local name \\"johnny jump-up\\". This is accompanied by a persistent wheezing jweeee call, jumping several times in a minute. The extravagant display also has a cost of call attention of predator, thus displays increase the nest predation. Predation are the main cause of breeding failure, and predator vocalizations can cause immune-related reaction to this species. Nests are small cups of rootlets (diameter about 7.5 cm) found at herbaceous vegetation 10‚Äì50 cm high, clustered at landscape, and placed preferably at high complex habitat spots. Nests are built by both sexes.

The company's main product is Nero 2019, a piece of software that comprises burning, file conversion, media management, and video editing functions and is updated on an annual basis. History Richard Lesser founded the company as Ahead Software GmbH in 1995. The company changed its name (and legal form) to Ahead Software AG in 2001 and again to Nero AG in 2005. The Nero Group includes foreign subsidiaries in Glendale, California, United States (Nero Inc., founded in 2001), in Yokohama, Japan (Nero K.K., founded in 2004), and Hangzhou, China (Nero Ltd., founded in 2007). The USA and Japan operations are sales offices, while the Chinese subsidiary operates exclusively to provide internal development services for the company. In May 2007, it was announced that the Luxembourg-based firm Agrippina International S√†rL owned more than 25% of Nero AG shares In 2009, the company established two additional subsidiaries in Germany: Nero Development and Services GmbH and Nero EMEA Sales GmbH. In 2014, the company moved the operations and headquarters of Nero AG, as well as of the two group companies Nero Development and Services GmbH and Nero EMEA Sales GmbH, to Karlsruhe. Products From its beginnings selling a single software application for burning, the company says it has become a \\"leader in digital media technologies\\" that now sells a wide range of products. Nero sells its products directly as well as via hardware manufacturers that bundle them on PCs, hard disks, camcorders and other devices. Other companies also use Nero multimedia codecs, SDKs and programming interfaces. In 2008, Nero expanded its product range for the first time beyond the well-known burning software. With Nero Move it, users were able to transfer photos, videos, and music from one device to another or to online communities like YouTube, Myspace, and the company's own multimedia community My Nero. With the Nero 9 multimedia suite, they could create, rip, burn, edit, save, and upload their music, video, and photo files. In June 2009, the company launched its Nero BackitUp & Burn product, which saved, burned, and restored data and helped protect users' digital content. The company extended the product with additional functions in the years following its launch and gave the user navigation around the various program elements a more unified look and feel. As a product, Nero evolved from a pure burning program (Nero Burning ROM) to a multimedia software package. The software includes programs: * for burning and packet writing (Nero Burning ROM) * for ripping and converting multimedia content (Nero Recode) * for displaying, managing, and streaming photos and multimedia content (Nero MediaHome) and * for creating, editing, and transcoding video content and for burning video content to video discs with menus (Nero Video) Along with Nero, Nero AG also developed SecurDiscs process, as well as the MPEG-4 compression technique Nero Digital together with Ateme corporation. The backup solution Nero BackItUp, which was initially included in the Nero suite of programs, was spun off in 2012 and is now available together with cloud-based storage as a subscription model. Android, iOS and Windows Phone apps are available for Nero BackItUp. Along with BackItUp, Nero provides additional applications for mobile devices. These include NeroKwik for managing photo files, Nero AirBurn for burning files wirelessly, Nero MediaHome Receiver for streaming media from a PC to mobile devices, and Nero MediaHome WiFi Sync for wireless data synchronization. Since the release of Version 11, Nero Cover Designer (for creating covers), Nero WaveEditor (for editing music files) and Nero SoundTrax (for mixing and digitalizing music tracks) are no longer included in the suite but can be downloaded free of charge from the company's website. Some of the products in the suite can also be downloaded separately. These include Nero Burning ROM and Nero Video. Nero has also launched a number of free mobile Nero Suite companions apps for iOS and Android like Nero AirBurn, Nero Streaming Player. The latest app is Nero KnowHow app a digital learning guide for users, available for iOS, Windows 10 and Android.

It should not be used in those in whom Clostridioides difficile infection is a concern. It is taken by mouth. Onset is typically within an hour. Side effects may include abdominal pain, angioedema, glaucoma, heart problems, feeling tired, dry mouth, and trouble seeing. It is unclear if use in pregnancy is safe and use when breastfeeding may result in side effects in the baby. It works by decreasing contractions of the bowel. The combination was approved for medical use in the United States in 1960. It is available as a generic medication and over the counter. In the United States the wholesale cost per is dose is US$0.31. In 2017, it was the 353rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 700thousand prescriptions. It is sold under the brand name Lomotil among others. The medication is in Schedule V in the United States. Contraindications Absolute contraindications are: * Allergy to diphenoxylate or atropine * Diarrhea associated with pseudomembranous enterocolitis, diarrhea caused by antibiotic treatment, or diarrhea caused by enterotoxin-producing bacteria. * Presence of jaundice Side effects The drug combination is generally safe in short-term use and with recommended dosage. In doses used for the treatment of diarrhea, whether acute or chronic, diphenoxylate has not produced addiction. It may cause several side-effects, such as dry mouth, headache, constipation and blurred vision. Since it may also cause drowsiness or dizziness, it should not be used by motorists, operators of hazardous machinery, etc. It is not recommended for children under two years of age. Interactions Interactions with other drugs: * Antidepressants (e.g. Elavil, Prozac) * Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (e.g. Nardil, Parnate) * Opioid analgesics * Sedatives (e.g. Ambien, Sonata) Diarrhea that is caused by some antibiotics such as cefaclor, erythromycin or tetracycline can worsen. Toxicity It may cause serious health problems when overdosed. Signs and symptoms of adverse effects may include any or several of the following: convulsions, respiratory depression (slow or stopped breathing), dilated eye pupils, nystagmus (rapid side-to-side eye movements), erythema (flushed skin), gastrointestinal constipation, nausea, vomiting, paralytic ileus, tachycardia (rapid pulse), drowsiness and hallucinations. Symptoms of toxicity may take up to 12 hours to appear. Treatment of overdose must be initiated immediately after diagnosis and may include the following: ingestion of activated charcoal, laxative and a counteracting medication (narcotic antagonist).  Mechanism of action  Diphenoxylate is anti- diarrheal and atropine is anticholinergic. A subtherapeutic amount of atropine sulfate is present to discourage deliberate overdosage. Atropine has no anti- diarrheal properties, but will cause tachycardia when overused. The medication diphenoxylate works by slowing down the movement of the intestines. In some cases it has been shown to ease symptoms of opiate withdrawal. Society and culture=Names The UK BAN generic name for diphenoxylate and atropine is co-phenotrope. As of 2018, the combination drug is marketed in the US and some other countries under the following brands: Atridol, Atrolate, Atrotil, Co-Phenotrope, Dhamotil, Dimotil, Intard, Logen, Lomanate, Lomotil, Lonox, and Reasec.

Wise (born 1952) is an American legal scholar who specializes in animal protection issues, primatology, and animal intelligence. He teaches animal rights law at Harvard Law School, Vermont Law School, John Marshall Law School, Lewis & Clark Law School, and Tufts University School of Veterinary Medicine. He is a former president of the Animal Legal Defense Fund, and founder and president of the Nonhuman Rights Project.\\"About the author\\" , Steven Wise's home page. The Yale Law Journal has called him \\"one of the pistons of the animal rights movement.\\" Wise is the author of An American Trilogy (2009), in which he tells the story of how a piece of land in Tar Heel, North Carolina, was first the home of Native Americans until they were driven into near-extinction, then a slave plantation, and finally the site of factory hog farms and the world's largest slaughterhouse. Though the Heavens May Fall (2005), recounts the 1772 trial in England of James Somersett, a black man rescued from a ship heading for the West Indies slave markets, which gave impetus to the movement to abolish slavery in Britain and the United States (see Somersett's Case). Drawing the Line (2002), which describes the relative intelligence of animals and human beings. And Rattling the Cage (2000), in which he argues that certain basic legal rights should be extended to chimpanzees and bonobos. The documentary Unlocking the Cage (2016) follows Wise on parts of his struggle for chimpanzees. Background Wise received his undergraduate education in chemistry at the College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia. Wise first became interested in politics through his involvement in the anti-Vietnam War movement while at William & Mary. Wise studied law at Boston University and was awarded his J.D. there in 1976, then became a personal injury lawyer. He was inspired to move into the area of animal rights after reading Peter Singer's Animal Liberation (1975),Gale, \\"Biography\\". often referred to as 'the bible of the animal liberation movement'. A practicing animal protection attorney, he is president of the nonprofit Nonhuman Rights Project, where he directs its Nonhuman Rights Project, the purpose of which is to obtain basic common law rights for at least some nonhuman animals. He lives in Coral Springs, Florida, with his children Chris and Siena. Animal personhood Wise's position on animal rights is that some animals, particularly primates, meet the criteria of legal personhood, and should therefore be awarded certain rights and protections. His criteria for personhood are that the animal must be able to desire things, to act in an intentional manner to acquire those things, and must have a sense of self i.e. the animals must know that s/he exists. Wise argues that chimpanzees, bonobos, elephants, parrots, dolphins, orangutans, and gorillas meet these criteria. Wise argues that these animals should have legal personhood bestowed upon them to protect them from \\"serious infringements upon their bodily integrity and bodily liberty.\\" Without personhood in law, he writes, one is \\"invisible to civil law\\" and \\"might as well be dead.\\"Sunstein, Cass R. \\"The Chimps' Day in Court\\", New York Times Book Review, February 20, 2000. He writes in \\"The Problem with Being a Thing\\" in Rattling the Cage: In Rattling the Cage, Wise offers examples of primates who he believes have suffered unjustifiably. He writes about Jerom, a chimpanzee who lived alone in a small cage in the Yerkes Regional Primate Research Center, with no access to sunlight, after being infected with one strain of HIV when he was three, another at the age of four, and a third at the age of five, before dying in 1996 at the age of 14. Wise also tells the story of Lucy Temerlin, a six-year- old chimpanzee who learned American Sign Language from Roger Fouts, the primatologist, and was raised by Maurice K. Temerlin and Temerlin Mcclain. Fouts would arrive at Lucy's home at 8:30 every morning, when Lucy would greet him with a hug, go to the stove, take the kettle, fill it with water from the sink, find two cups and tea bags from the cupboard, and brew and serve the tea. When she was 12, the Temerlins were no longer able to care for her. She was sent to a chimpanzee rehabilitation center in Senegal, then flown to Gambia, where she was shot and skinned by a poacher, and her feet and hands hacked off for sale as trophies. Seminars Wise has been profiled in Who's Who in the World as well as other editions of Who's Who since 2005. He is a frequent guest on a wide variety of television and radio news and talk shows throughout Europe, Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and North America. Wise speaks frequently on topics related to animal rights law at law schools, legal conferences, and universities throughout North and South America, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and Africa including Harvard Law School, Monash University Law School, Australia, and the University of Stellenbosch among others. He has taught Animal Rights Law or Animal Rights Jurisprudence at the Harvard, Vermont, Lewis and Clark, University of Miami, St. Thomas, and John Marshall Law Schools.

He became a Methodist preacher in Indiana near where his family had settled and became an advocate of abolitionism and colonization. In 1848 Mitchell took the job of Secretary of the American Colonization Society of Indiana, and first met Abraham Lincoln in that capacity. Lincoln appointed Mitchell Commissioner of Emigration on August 4, 1862.History cooperative. In this capacity he was to oversee the establishment of one or more colonies abroad for freed slaves. Mitchell organized Lincoln's infamous August 14, 1862, address to a \\"Deputation of Negroes\\" at the White House, where Lincoln proclaimed \\"You and we are different races. We have between us a broader difference than exists between almost any other two races. Whether it is right or wrong I need not discuss, but this physical difference is a great disadvantage to us both, as I think your race suffer very greatly, many of them by living among us, while ours suffer from your presence.\\" After the Civil War, Mitchell returned to the ministry in the Methodist church.

Early life Ry≈´ was born in Tamamizu Village, Tamana County, a rural area of Kumamoto Prefecture in Kyushu, the most southerly and westerly of the four main islands of Japan. His father was chief priest of Raish≈çji (Êù•ÁÖßÂØ∫), a temple of the Honganji School of Pure Land Buddhism. Ry≈´ attended the village elementary school and a prefectural middle school before entering the Department of Indian Philosophy and Ethics at T≈çy≈ç University to study Buddhism. His parents hoped he would succeed his father as priest of Raish≈çji, but Ry≈´ had no wish to do so and in 1925 dropped out of university and enrolled in the acting academy of the Sh≈çchiku motion picture company's Kamata Studios. Shortly afterwards, his father died and Ry≈´ returned home to take on the role of priest. Within half a year or so, however, he passed the office to his older brother and returned to Kamata. Career For about ten years, he was confined to walk-on parts and minor roles, often uncredited. During this time he appeared in fourteen films directed by Yasujir≈ç Ozu, beginning with the college comedy Dreams of Youth (1928). His first big part was in Ozu's College is a Nice Place (1936) and he made his mark as an actor in Ozu's The Only Son (also 1936), playing a failed middle- aged school-teacher in spite of the fact that he was only 32. This was his break-through role, and he now began to get major parts in other directors' films. He first played the lead in Torajir≈ç Sait≈ç's Aogeba t≈çtoshi (‰ª∞„Åí„Å∞Â∞ä„Åó 1937). His first leading role in an Ozu film was in the There Was a Father (Áà∂„ÅÇ„Çä„Åç 1942). This was another \\"elderly\\" part: he played the father of Sh≈´ji Sano, who was only seven years his junior. He was by now undoubtedly Ozu's favourite actor: he eventually appeared in 52 of Ozu's 54 films. He had a role (not always the lead) in every one of Ozu's post-war movies, from Record of a Tenement Gentleman (1947) to An Autumn Afternoon (1962). He played his most famous \\"elderly\\" role in Tokyo Story (1953). Ry≈´ appeared in well over 100 films by other directors. He was in Keisuke Kinoshita's Twenty-four Eyes (1954) and played wartime Prime Minister Kantar≈ç Suzuki in Kihachi Okamoto's Japan's Longest Day (1967). From 1969 until his death in 1993, he played a curmudgeonly but benevolent Buddhist priest in more than forty of the immensely popular It's Tough Being a Man (Otoko wa tsurai yo) series starring Kiyoshi Atsumi as the lovable pedlar/conman Tora-san. Ry≈´ parodied this role in J≈´z≈ç Itami's comedy The Funeral (1984). Ry≈´'s last film was It's Tough Being a Man: Torajir≈ç's Youth (Áî∑„ÅØ„Å§„Çâ„ÅÑ„Çà ÂØÖÊ¨°ÈÉé„ÅÆÈùíÊò•: Otoko wa tsurai yo: Torajir≈ç no seishun 1992). Between 1965 and 1989 he appeared in about 90 TV productions. Accent Ry≈´ retained the rural Kumamoto accent of his childhood throughout his life. It may have held him back early in his career, but became part of his screen persona, denoting reliability and simple honesty. When the columnist Natsuhiko Yamamoto published a deliberately provocative piece called \\"I Can't Stand Chish≈´ Ry≈´\\", in which he derided Ry≈´'s accent, there was a furious reaction, and his magazine Sh≈´kan Shinch≈ç (ÈÄ±ÂàäÊñ∞ÊΩÆ) was inundated with letters of protest.

The group's interests span newspaper and magazine publishing, Internet, subscription television, market research, DVD and film distribution, and film and television production trading assets. News Pty Limited (formerly News Limited) is the holding company of the group. News Corp Australia owns approximately 142 daily, Sunday, weekly, bi-weekly and tri-weekly newspapers, of which 102 are suburban publications (including 16 in which News Corp Australia has a 50% interest). News Corp Australia publishes a nationally distributed newspaper in Australia, a metropolitan newspaper in each of the Australian cities of Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Hobart and Darwin and groups of suburban newspapers in the suburbs of Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, Brisbane and Perth. The company publishes a further thirty magazine titles across Australia. According to the Finkelstein Review of Media and Media Regulation, in 2011 the group accounted for 23% of the newspaper titles in Australia. With interests in digital media, the company's sites include news.com.au, Business Spectator and Eureka Report, Kidspot.com.au, taste.com.au and homelife.com.au. It has 50% stakes in CareerOne.com.au and had a 55% stake in carsguide.com.au which was sold in 2016, a share in REA Group that operates www.realestate.com.au, as well as websites for most newspaper and magazine titles. The company's other Australian assets include Australian News Channel, 65% ownership of subscription television provider Foxtel, (which in turn owns Fox Sports Australia) and shares in the Brisbane Broncos NRL team. Until the formation of News Corporation in 1979, News Limited was the principal holding company for the business interests of Rupert Murdoch and his family. Since then, News Limited had been wholly owned by News Corporation. In 2004, News Corporation announced its intention to reincorporate to the United States. On 3 November News Corp Limited ceased trading on the Australian Stock Exchange; and on 8 November, News Corporation began trading on the New York Stock Exchange. On 28 June 2013, News Corporation was split into two separate companies. Murdoch's newspaper interests became News Corp, which was the new parent company of News Limited. The group adopted the new News Corp Australia name following the listing of the new News Corp on 1 July 2013. History=Early days News Limited was established in 1923 by James Edward Davidson, when he purchased the Broken Hill Barrier Miner and the Port Pirie Recorder. He went on to purchase Adelaide's weekly Mail and to found The News, a daily newspaper in Adelaide, South Australia. Murdochs Sir Keith Murdoch acquired a minority interest in the company in 1949. Following the death of his father, Sir Keith, in 1952, Rupert Murdoch inherited The News, which has been described by Murdoch biographer Bruce Page as the \\"foundation stone\\" of News Limited (and News Corporation). Over the next few years, Murdoch gradually established himself as one of the most dynamic media proprietors in Australia, quickly expanding his holdings by acquiring a string of daily and suburban newspapers in most capital cities, including the Sydney afternoon paper, The Daily Mirror, as well as a small Sydney-based recording company, Festival Records. His acquisition of the Mirror proved crucial to his success, allowing him to challenge the dominance of his two main rivals in the Sydney market, the Fairfax Newspapers group, which published the hugely profitable The Sydney Morning Herald, and the Consolidated Press group, owned by Sir Frank Packer, which published the city's leading tabloid paper, The Daily Telegraph. In 1964, News Limited made its next important advance when it established The Australian, Australia's first national daily newspaper, based initially in Canberra and later in Sydney. The Australian, a broadsheet, gave News Limited a new respectability as a quality newspaper publisher, and also greater political influence since The Australian has always had an elite readership, if not always a large circulation. Also in 1964, News Limited made Rupert Murdoch's first overseas newspaper investment ‚Äì a 29.57 percent stake in the Wellington Publishing Company, subsequently part of Independent Newspapers Limited, INL, New Zealand's largest publishing group. The News Limited holding in INL fluctuated over the years and was just over 49 percent in 1997. The INL business was bought by News Limited's main rival in 2003 ‚Äì Fairfax Media. In 1972, News Limited acquired The Daily Telegraph from Sir Frank Packer, making Murdoch one of the \\"big three\\" newspaper proprietors in Australia, along with Fairfax Media in Sydney and his father's old Herald and Weekly Times Ltd in Melbourne. In the 1972 elections, Murdoch swung his newspapers' support behind Gough Whitlam and the left wing Australian Labor Party, but by 1975 he had turned against Labor, and since then has almost always supported the rightist Liberal Party. Over the next ten years, as his press empire grew, Murdoch established a hugely lucrative financial base, and these profits were routinely used to subsidise further acquisitions. In his early years of newspaper ownership Murdoch was an aggressive, micromanaging entrepreneur. His standard tactic was to buy loss-making Australian newspapers and turn them around by introducing radical management and editorial changes and fighting no-holds-barred circulation wars with his competitors. By the 1970s, this power base was so strong that Murdoch was able to acquire leading newspapers and magazines in both London and New York, as well as many other media holdings. To gain subscriptions for its new pay television business, News Ltd recruited rugby league football administrators, clubs and players to form a new competition, sparking the mid-1990s Super League war. On 12 July 2006, News Limited announced the creation of a new division, News Digital Media to manage the operations of the news site news.com.au; the online marketplace sites, carsguide.com.au, truelocal.com.au and careerone.com.au as well as the partly owned realestate.com.au, foxsports.com.au and related activities involving Foxtel and the company's newspapers and the Australian versions of Fox Interactive Media sites Myspace and IGN. Chairman and chief executive of News Limited, John Hartigan, announced the appointment of Richard Freudenstein as chief executive of the division.http://finance.news.com.au/story/0,10166,19765546-31037,00.html In February 2018, News Corp Australia announced a partnership with Taboola to launch an integrated native content creation, booking and distribution platform. The Taboola Feed will be implemented on desktop, mobile, web and in- app across the News Corp Australia digital network. Editorial conduct issues In the wake of the News International phone hacking scandal in the United Kingdom, in July 2011 News Limited announced a review of all payments in the previous three years. On 22 July it was reported that two retired Victorian Supreme Court judges, Frank Vincent AO QC and Bernard Teague AO, were appointed to act as independent assessors of the conduct of the review and also assess the outcome. The editorial and financial review concluded in early November and found no evidence of phone hacking or payments to public officials, with Vincent and Teague declaring that the review process did not bring \\".....to light any systemic issues with respect to the making of payments to third parties and any substantial amounts paid to individuals in respect of illegitimate activities.\\" Despite this the Australian division of News Corp has not entirely escaped scandal with allegations in 2012 that News Corp subsidiary, News Datacom Systems (NDS) had used hackers to undermine pay TV rivals around the world, including Australia. Some of the victims of the alleged hacking, such as Austar were later taken over by News Corp and others such as Ondigital later went bust. NDS had originally been set up to provide security to News Corp's pay TV interests but emails obtained by Fairfax Media revealed they had also pursued a wider agenda by distributing the keys to rival set top box operators and seeking to obtain phone records of suspected rivals.Chenoweth, Neil Pay TV Piracy Hits News, The Financial Review 28 March 2012, online Retrieved 4 May 2012 The emails were from the hard drive of NDS European chief, Ray Adams. It was also revealed that Australian Federal police were working with UK police to investigate hacking by News Corp.Tingle, Laura & Daley, Gemma \\"Federal Police Join News Probe\\", The Financial Review 28 March 2012, online Retrieved 4 May 2012 Corporate changes On 28 June 2013, News Corporation split into two publicly traded companies focused on publishing, and broadcasting/media respectively. At this time News Limited was renamed News Corp Australia and became part of the publishing company, News Corp, with Wall Street Journal editor Robert Thomson replacing Rupert Murdoch as CEO. Murdoch remains a chairman and major shareholder for both companies. On 9 August 2013 it was announced that Julian Clarke would replace Kim Williams as the CEO of News Corp Australia. Williams had replaced John Hartigan, who served as CEO between 2000 and 2011, who had in turn succeeded Lachlan Murdoch. On 9 June 2015, it was announced that Peter Tonagh would replace Julian Clarke as the CEO of News Corp Australia with Michael Millar to be appointed to the role of Executive Chairman. Peter Tonagh and Michael Millar's first day in their new roles was 16 November 2015 Influence in Australia Murdoch's desire for dominant cross-media ownership manifested in early 1961 when he bought an ailing Australian record label, Festival Records, and within a few years it had become the leading local recording company . He also bought a television station in Wollongong, New South Wales, hoping to use it to break into the Sydney television market, but found himself frustrated by Australia's cross-media ownership laws, which prevented him from owning both a major newspaper and television station in the same city. Since then he has consistently lobbied, both personally and through his papers, to have these laws changed in his favour. This occurred in 2006 when the Liberal-National Coalition Government, having gained control of both houses of the Australian Parliament, introduced reforms to cross-media ownership and foreign media ownership laws. The laws came into effect in early 2007, with further changes in 2017 abolishing 'two out of three' restrictions that had previously prevented news companies from owning newspaper, radio, and television services within the same city. News Corp Australia has nearly three-quarters of daily metropolitan newspaper circulation and so maintains great influence in Australia. Internal News Corp Australia documents reveal a brazen offer during the 2001 federal election campaign to promote the policies of a major party in its best-selling newspapers nationwide for almost A$500,000. Other documents include a marginal seats guide written by a senior business manager for internal use. It evidences a corporate strategy to target marginal seats at the 2004 election. Some of the documents appeared on Media Watch. Murdoch wanted a way to influence politics in his native land. He saw a way to do that through the News Corp publication The Australian. The national daily has been used to support Murdoch's political interests over time, such as John McEwen with the National Party of Australia and Gough Whitlam with the Australian Labor Party. Acquisitions=Britain Murdoch moved to Britain and rapidly became a major force there after his acquisitions of the News of the World, and The Sun in 1969 and The Times and The Sunday Times in 1981, which he bought from the Thomson family. Both takeovers further reinforced his growing reputation as a ruthless and cunning business operator. His takeover of The Times aroused great hostility among traditionalists, who feared he would take it \\"downmarket.\\" This led directly to the founding of The Independent in 1986 as an alternative quality daily. United States Murdoch made his first acquisition in the United States in 1973, when he purchased the San Antonio News. Soon afterwards he founded the National Star, a supermarket tabloid, and in 1976 he purchased the New York Post. Subsequent acquisitions were undertaken through News Corporation. Australia News Limited expanded its newspaper holdings in 1987 when it acquired The Herald and Weekly Times, which published two newspapers in Melbourne (in 1990 these papers would be combined to form the Herald Sun) as well as large stakes in several other newspaper publishers. News Limited went on to acquire the remaining shares of Brisbane's Queensland Newspapers (owner of The Courier- Mail), Adelaide's Advertiser Newspapers (owner of The Advertiser) and Hobart's Davies Brothers (owner of The Mercury). In 1991, News Limited spun off its longtime magazine house, Southdown Press, as Pacific Magazines and Printing, and sold the former Advertiser magazines, renamed Murdoch Magazines, to Matt Handbury. News Limited re-entered the magazine market in 2000 with the start of News Magazines. In 2006, News Limited returned to being a major player in the Australian magazine business with the purchase of Independent Print Media Group's FPC Magazines (Delicious, Super Food Ideas, Vogue Australia).

They differ from modern machine guns in that they lack automatic loading and automatic fire and are limited by the number of barrels bundled together. In practice, large volley guns were not particularly more useful than a cannon firing canister shot or grapeshot. Since they were still mounted on a carriage, they could be as hard to aim and move around as a cannon, and the many barrels took as long or longer to reload.Matthew Sharpe \\"Nock's Volley Gun: A Fearful Discharge\\" American Rifleman December 2012 pp.50-53 They also tended to be relatively expensive since they were more complex than a cannon, due to all the barrels and ignition fuses, and each barrel had to be individually maintained and cleaned.  15th-century volley guns  Polish 20-barrel artillery piece. The barrels are designed to enable the shot to spread out and cause maximum damage The Ribauldequin was a medieval version of the volley gun. It had its barrels set up in parallel. This early version was first employed during the Hundred Years' War by the army of Edward III of England, in 1339. Later on, the late Swiss army employed it. Ottoman Empire volley gun with 9 barrels, early 16th century Multi-barreled artillery pieces continued in use during the 16th and 17th century. A double-barreled cannon called Elizabeth-Henry, named after Charles I's youngest children, was used by the Cavaliers during the English Civil War and fired 2oz charges. It could also fire grapeshot. The barrels were wrapped in leather to prevent rusting. On the continent, 16th century Aragon developed a 15-barrel volley gun; German and Polish gunsmiths invented handheld multi-barrel guns. These were sometimes combination sword and axe pistols such as Henry VIII's Walking Staff, a 3-barreled gun and battle mace. Henry VIII also owned a multi-barreled German wheel lock rifle capable of firing a superimposed charge.Howard Ricketts, Firearms, (London,1962) p.29.  18th-century volley guns  Duckfoot pistol made during the reign of George III. The Nock gun resembled a conventional flintlock musket with seven barrels hexagonally brazed around a central barrel. All seven .46 caliber (12 mm) barrels were connected to the single flintlock pan in a manner intended to produce simultaneous discharge through row ignition, but one or more barrels frequently failed to fire. The gun was invented by James Wilson in 1779 and manufactured by Henry Nock for use through the Napoleonic Wars. Five hundred Nock guns were produced for the Royal Navy intended for use in repelling boarders or to clear an enemy deck in advance of friendly boarding parties. Admiral Howe's fleet was issued twenty guns for each ship of the line and twelve guns for each frigate. Recoil of the 13-pound (5.9 kg) Nock gun caused dislocated shoulders and clavicle fractures among the sailors firing Nock guns; and the muzzle flash from simultaneous discharge of multiple barrels could ignite canvas sail when fired from positions in the rigging. The Nock volley gun was considered obsolete by 1805, but a surviving weapon was carried by Richard Widmark in the 1960 movie The Alamo. The Nock gun was recently brought to public attention by its inclusion in Bernard Cornwell's Sharpe novels where it was wielded by both Sharpe and his friend and colleague Sergeant Patrick Harper. A breech-loading volley gun that was reloaded using multiple breech pieces, similar to the later mitrailleuse, was developed in France in 1775 by a Du Perron.Nouveau R√®glement pour la filature des soies, (no publisher name or imprint), page 25, 1775  19th-century volley guns  Three-barrel tap-action pocket pistol capable of firing all barrels simultaneously or sequentially using a rotating block in the pan. Fieschi's , (2012) Two notable artillery-sized volley guns were developed in the mid-19th century, although neither was particularly successful in practice. Developed in the 1860s and based on an 1850s design by a captain Fafschamps, the French is an example of a multi-barreled volley gun that could fire all of its barrels simultaneously or sequentially over a short period of time. Also developed in the 1860s, General Origen Vandenburgh of the New York State Militia designed a weapon that had eighty-five parallel .50 caliber rifle barrels. After failing to sell the weapon to the United Kingdom, he reportedly sold a small number to the Confederate States of America, although there is no record that they were actually used. One Vandenburgh gun was located at Fort Fisher, North Carolina, and another reportedly at Salisbury, NC. A few hand-held volley guns were also developed during the 18th and 19th centuries. One of the most distinctive was the \\"duck's foot\\" volley gun, a pistol with multiple barrels arranged in a splayed pattern, so that the firer could spray a sizable area with a single shot.Pistols by Jeff Kinard The principle behind this type of pistol is one of confrontation by one person against a group; hence, it was popular among bank guards, prison wardens and sea captains in the early 19th century. Country LifeAmerican shooter In July 1835, used a home-made, 25-barrel volley gun to attempt the assassination of King Louis Philippe I in Paris. He fired the weapon from a third-floor window while the king and his entourage were passing in the street below. Although 18 people were killed, the king only received a minor wound. The gun barrels had been sold as scrap by a government arsenal after being labelled as defective and four of them burst when fired. was badly injured and was quickly captured. He and two others involved in the plot were condemned to death and guillotined in 1836. His volley gun, known as the Infernal machine (weapon), is preserved at the in Paris.  Modern connection  A number of designs of electronically fired explosive-propulsion projectile weapons and non-explosive projectile weapons were developed by Metal Storm Limited which had some similarities to 18th-century volley guns, particularly in that they use many barrels which can be fired all at once or in sequence such as the Nordenfelt gun. These designs met with little commercial interest and Metal Storm Limited entered administration in 2012. The Spanish Navy uses a volley gun system, the Meroka, which consists of twelve Oerlikon 20 mm cannons mounted in a tight cluster with an externally powered automatic loading system. It delivers an exceptionally high rate of fire for a very short burst, and reloads in less than 0.3 seconds. This makes it suitable for close-range defense against missiles, aircraft and small boats. In 2019, Standard Manufacturing introduced the S333 Thunderstruck, a double-barreled revolver which fires two rounds with each pull of the trigger.

The channel was launched in 1994 as the licence-exempt service Sportscope, which featured a display of sports news and scores. In 1997, the network was re-launched under Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) licensing as Headline Sports, adding anchored segments to its rolling sports news programming. In 2000, the network gained the ability to air occasional broadcasts of live sporting events, and was re-launched as The Score. In 2012, the network's parent company Score Media announced that it would sell the network to Rogers Communications, which owns the competing Sportsnet family of sports television networks; in 2013, the network was re- branded as Sportsnet 360. The channel primarily broadcasts automated blocks of sports news and highlights, a television simulcast of CJCL's syndicated sports radio show Prime Time Sports, along with live event sports coverage as an overflow channel for Sportsnet's national programming. The channel is also the main Canadian broadcaster of WWE professional wrestling programs, airing both WWE Raw and SmackDown, along with other ancillary programs. Sportsnet 360 runs an expanded ticker outside of live sports programming, which displays sports news, scores, and statistics. As of 2014, Sportsnet 360 is available in 5.8 million Canadian homes.  History = Sportscope  Screenshot of Sportscope logo. In a small building on Main Street West in Hamilton, Ontario, the channel was launched 1994 as Sportscope, the channel began as a network focusing on providing sports scores, airing in seven Canadian provinces. Sportscope's \\"programming\\" consisted solely of an alphanumeric text rotation of sports scores, news, and sports betting information, which aired alongside local and national advertising slides. As it did not include any video content, it did not require a CRTC licence.  Headline Sports  First logo, during the Headline Sports era. Sportscope was granted an English- language specialty channel licence by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission on September 4, 1996, provisionally titled \\"Sportscope Plus\\". The channel was launched in May 1997 as Headline Sports and was a national 24-hour anchor-at-desk sports information service operating on a rotating 15-minute newswheel of sports news, highlights, and scores. Advertising was also introduced, something that did not exist during the Sportscope era. The oldies music was replaced by modern stock music during text rotation of sports scores and news. The channel also contained a constantly updated ticker at the bottom of the screen, providing sports news and scores, as it still does today, per its CRTC licence requirements. There were plans to air different tickers in each region of the country and additional streams of alphanumeric data (perhaps via an alternate channel) when the channel was launched, but those plans were abandoned.  The Score  Logo as The Score (2002‚Äì2013) In March 2000, Headline Sports' licence was amended by the CRTC to allow live sports programming, under the conditions that the channel display the ticker and that breaks away from live coverage occur at least once every 15 minutes to present video highlights. As a result of this ‚Äì as well as legal issues with U.S. cable news channel CNN Headline News, which had its own \\"Headline Sports\\" segmentCanadian Trade-mark Database record for application no. 0832430, \\"Headline Sports\\", filed by Sportscope Television Network Ltd. and opposed by Cable News Network Inc. ‚Äì the channel was rebranded as The Score Television Network that year. On June 6, 2006, The Score launched a high definition simulcast. On September 3, 2008, the channel began broadcasting from a new studio on the corner of King and Peter in Downtown Toronto.Grand Opening of The Score's new head office , City of Toronto, September 20, 2008. For the 2007‚Äì08 season, The Score acquired the Canadian television rights to the Premier League. The network only chose to broadcast a single match on Sunday mornings, and sub-licensing the remainder of the rights to Rogers Communications‚Äîwho placed one Saturday match on long- time rightsholder Rogers Sportsnet, and the rest on its newly-launched premium service Setanta Sports Canada. The Score also launched a bi-weekly studio program covering soccer, The Footy Show. On September 20, 2011, Score Media announced that it would put The Score Television Network up for sale.Specialty sports channel The Score for sale, The Globe and Mail, September 20, 2011.  Purchase by Rogers, relaunch as Sportsnet 360  Reports surfaced on August 24, 2012 that Rogers Media, owners of the competing network Sportsnet, would acquire The Score's parent company. The following day, Rogers Media announced that it acquired Score Media in a transaction valued at $167 million. Pending CRTC approval, Rogers acquired Score Media's television business which included the closed captioning service Voice to Visual Inc., mixed martial arts promotion The Score Fighting Series, and The Score Television Network.Rogers Media to Acquire theScore Television Network CNW press release 2012-08-25 The acquisition closed on October 19, 2012, at which point Score Media's digital assets (the website theScore.com and associated mobile apps) were spun off into another company primarily owned by Score Media's previous shareholders, theScore Inc., in which Rogers Media retained a 10% interest. Score Media's television properties were immediately placed into a blind trust, under trustee Peter Viner, pending final CRTC approval. The operations of the digital properties and the television channel were separated at this point, with the latter operating a separate website (theScoreTV.ca) for the interim period until the Rogers deal was approved. As part of CRTC requirements to spend 10% of the value of an acquisition on initiatives to strengthen the broadcasting industry, Rogers planned to fund the production of the Sportsnet Winter Games (which would have been an annual winter sports competition) and provide funding for the production of amateur sports programming. While Rogers planned to continue running The Score as a sports news service, it also requested that the CRTC ease some of the restrictions that were placed on the network in order to allow it to be more competitive with other Canadian sports channels. Namely, Rogers requested that it only be required to air one sports news update per-hour during live programming. The CRTC approved the acquisition of The Score by Rogers, as well as Rogers' proposal to only require a sports update once per hour during live programming on April 30, 2013 (but rejected its proposal to spend its tangible benefits on the Sportsnet Winter Games). Immediately following the approval, it was announced that The Score would begin airing Hockey Central Playoff Extra (a spin-off of Sportsnet's NHL news program) nightly during the 2013 Stanley Cup playoffs, and the network replaced its afternoon programming with a simulcast of Tim & Sid, a radio show on Rogers-owned CJCL hosted by former The Score personalities Tim Micallef and Sid Seixeiro. On June 4, 2013, Rogers announced that it would relaunch The Score under the Sportsnet brand as Sportsnet 360 on July 1, 2013; it was launched with a simulcast of a Toronto Blue Jays baseball game, followed by the premiere of a new post-game show, Blue Jays Xpress. Alongside the rebranding, an updated version of The Score's on-screen sports ticker was introduced. Rogers stated that the network would continue to target its programming towards \\"hardcore\\" sports fans with \\"a vast breadth of premium sports content in a fast-paced, energetic and entertaining manner\\".  Programming  Sportsnet 360's schedule consists of automated blocks featuring sports news and highlights (primarily during the morning and overnight periods, and on weekend afternoons), alongside other full-length programs, and overflow and simulcasted sports programming from other Sportsnet channels. The network's daytime lineup features television simulcasts of the afternoon lineup of co-owned sports radio station CJCL, including Hockey Central and Writer's Bloc. The network formerly aired a simulcast of CJCL's Tim & Sid from the acquisition of The Score by Rogers in 2013 until March 27, 2015, when the show relaunched on Sportsnet with a television-oriented format. The network then began simulcasting their replacement Brady & Walker (which had moved from mornings) until February 2016, after Greg Brady was fired from the station. Prime Time Sports also aired on Sportsnet 360 until the show's end in October 2019; the station has since joined the main Sportsnet channels in simulcasting Tim & Sid once again, after the show was given an audio simulcast on CJCL as a replacement for Prime Time Sports. Sportsnet 360 is the exclusive Canadian broadcaster of WWE programs; the programs have been mainstays of the network since its period as The Score. As of January 2020, WWE programming includes Raw, SmackDown, Main Event, a condensed version of NXT, This Week in WWE, and the in-house studio show Aftermath. Rogers' current contract with WWE began in 2014 and runs through 2024; the contract also gave Rogers exclusive Canadian distribution rights to WWE Network. Sportsnet 360 formerly broadcast regular season events in U Sports football and basketball. In August 2014, Sportsnet announced that it would not renew its Ontario University Athletics conference television contracts for the 2014 season because of low viewership and the resulting high cost-per-viewer of producing the game broadcasts.

This would also prove to be the league's final indoor campaign before suspending operations following the 1984 outdoor season. The arena was more famously used by the National Hockey League's Tampa Bay Lightning during the team's inaugural season of 1992-1993. The facility's seating capacity of 10,425 proved too small for the Lightning, and the team relocated to the ThunderDome in St. Petersburg for three seasons, until their permanent home, Amalie Arena, was built in downtown Tampa.

Its operator is the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA), which is controlled by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) of New York. In 2016, an average of 5.66 million passengers used the system daily, making it the busiest rapid transit system in the United States and the seventh busiest in the world. The first underground line opened on October 27, 1904, almost 35 years after the opening of the first elevated line in New York City, which became the IRT Ninth Avenue Line. By the time the first subway opened, the lines had been consolidated into two privately owned systems, the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT, later Brooklyn‚ÄìManhattan Transit Corporation, BMT) and the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT). After 1913, all lines built for the IRT and most lines for the BRT were built by the city and leased to the companies. The first line of the city-owned and operated Independent Subway System (IND) opened in 1932; this system was intended to compete with the private systems and allow some of the elevated railways to be torn down. However, it was kept within the core of the city because of the low amount of startup capital provided to the municipal Board of Transportation by the state. This required it to be run \\"at cost\\", necessitating fares up to double the five-cent fare popular at the time. In 1940, the city took over running the previously privately operated systems. Some elevated lines closed immediately while others closed soon after. Integration was slow, but several connections were built between the IND and BMT, which now operate as one division called the B Division. Since IRT infrastructure is too small for B Division cars, the IRT remains its own division, the A Division. The NYCTA, a public authority presided over by New York City, was created in 1953 to take over subway, bus, and streetcar operations from the city. The NYCTA was under control of the state-level MTA in 1968. Soon after the MTA took control of the subway, New York City entered a fiscal crisis. It closed many elevated subway lines that became too expensive to maintain. Graffiti and crime became common, and equipment and stations fell into decrepit condition. The New York City Subway tried to stay solvent, so it had to make many service cutbacks and defer necessary maintenance projects. In the 1980s an $18 billion financing program for the rehabilitation of the subway began. The September 11 attacks resulted in service disruptions, particularly on the IRT Broadway‚ÄìSeventh Avenue Line, which ran directly underneath the World Trade Center. Sections of the tunnel, as well as the Cortlandt Street station, which was directly underneath the Twin Towers, were severely damaged and had to be rebuilt, requiring suspension of service on that line south of Chambers Street. Ten other nearby stations were temporarily closed. By March 2002, seven of those stations had reopened. The rest (except for Cortlandt Street on the IRT Broadway‚ÄìSeventh Avenue Line) reopened on September 15, 2002, along with service south of Chambers Street.Brian Abbott.

However, at the same time, under-investment in the subway system led to a transit crisis that peaked in 2017. Precursors=Steam railways Greenwich Street in 1867 Even though there was an earlier, underground railroad called the Atlantic Avenue Tunnel since 1844, it had no underground subway stops.Citynoise: Oldest Subway Tunnel in the World . Retrieved April 8, 2009. Construction of this tunnel, which was built mainly to create a grade-separated right of way for the Brooklyn and Jamaica Railroad (now the Long Island Rail Road's Atlantic Branch), began in May 1844, and the tunnel was open by December 1844. This led to South Ferry at the foot of Atlantic Avenue, where passengers could catch ferries to Manhattan. This extension, running under Cobble Hill, was closed by 1861. The tunnel was reopened for tourism in 1982,Multiple sources:   * and closed again in 2010. The beginnings of the actual Subway came from various excursion railroads to Coney Island and elevated railroads in Manhattan and Brooklyn. At that time, New York County (Manhattan Island and part of the Bronx), Kings County (including the cities of Brooklyn and Williamsburg), and Queens County were separate municipal entities. Competing steam-powered elevated railroads were built over major avenues. The first elevated line was constructed in 1867-1870 by Charles Harvey and his West Side and Yonkers Patent Railway company along Greenwich Street and Ninth Avenue (although cable cars were the initial mode of transportation on that railway). More lines were built on Second, Third and Sixth Avenues. None of these structures remain today, but these lines later shared trackage with subway trains as part of the IRT system. In Kings County, elevated railroads were built by several companies, over Lexington, Myrtle, Third and Fifth Avenues, Fulton Street and Broadway. These also later shared trackage with subway trains operated by the BRT and BMT. Most of these structures have been dismantled, but some have been rebuilt and upgraded. These lines were linked to Manhattan by various ferries and later the tracks along the Brooklyn Bridge (which originally had their own line and were later integrated into the BRT/BMT). Also in Kings County, six steam excursion railroads were built to various beaches in the southern part of the county; all but one (the Manhattan Beach Line) eventually fell under BMT control. Beach Pneumatic Transit Beach Pneumatic Transit The Beach Pneumatic Transit was the first attempt to build an underground public transit system in New York City. In 1869, Alfred Ely Beach and his Beach Pneumatic Transit Company of New York began constructing a pneumatic subway line beneath Broadway. Funneled through a company he set up, Beach put up $350,000 of his own money to bankroll the project.\\"Inventor of the Week - Alfred Beach\\" (MIT) Built in only 58 days, its single tunnel, long, in diameter, was completed in 1870 and ran under Broadway from Warren Street to Murray Street. It remained little more than a curiosity, running only a single car on its one-block-long track to a dead-end at its terminus. Passengers would simply ride out and back, to see what the proposed subway might be like. During its first two weeks of operation, the Beach Pneumatic Transit sold over 11,000 rides, with 400,000 rides provided during its first year of operation.\\"The Secret Subway\\" (PBS) Although the public showed initial approval, Beach was delayed in getting permission to expand it. By the time he finally gained permission in 1873, public and financial support had waned, and the subway was closed down. The final blow to the project was a stock market crash in 1873 which caused investors to withdraw support.\\"Beach Pneumatic Transit - The Interborough Rapid Transit subway\\" (plrog.org) After the project was shut down, the tunnel entrance was sealed, and the station, built in part of the basement of the Rogers Peet Building, was reclaimed for other uses. The entire building was lost to fire in 1898. In 1912, workers excavating for the present-day BMT Broadway Line dug into the old Beach tunnel; today, no part of this line remains as the tunnel was completely within the limits of the present day City Hall Station under Broadway.nycsubway.org‚ÄîBeach Pneumatic Transit Beginnings and rapid expansion=The first subwaysIRT= Political cartoon critical of IRT service in 1905. The IRT is labeled as the \\"Interborough Rattled Transit\\". In 1898, New York, Kings and Richmond Counties, and parts of Queens and Westchester Counties and their constituent cities, towns, villages, and hamlets, were consolidated into the City of Greater New York. During this era the expanded City of New York resolved that it wanted the core of future rapid transit to be underground subways but realized that no private company was willing to put up the enormous capital required to build beneath the streets. Planning for the system began with the Rapid Transit Act, signed into law on May 22, 1894, which created the Board of Rapid Transit Railroad Commissioners. The act provided that the commission would lay out routes with the consent of property owners and local authorities, either build the system or sell a franchise for its construction, and lease the operation to a private firm. A line through Lafayette Street (then Elm Street) to Union Square was considered, but at first a more costly route under lower Broadway was adopted. A legal battle with property owners along the route led to the courts denying permission to build through Broadway in 1896. The Elm Street route was chosen later that year, cutting west to Broadway via 42nd Street. This new plan, formally adopted on January 14, 1897, consisted of a line from City Hall north to Kingsbridge and a branch under Lenox Avenue and to Bronx Park, to have four tracks from City Hall to the junction at 103rd Street. The \\"awkward alignment...along Forty-Second Street\\", as the commission put it, was necessitated by objections to using Broadway south of 34th Street. Legal challenges were finally resolved in 1899.James Blaine Walker, Fifty Years of Rapid Transit, 1864-1917, published 1918, pp. 139-161 Subway construction in the Bowery, 1901 The city decided to issue rapid transit bonds outside of its regular bonded debt limit and build the subways itself; it contracted with the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (which by that time ran the elevated lines in Manhattan) to equip and operate the subways, sharing the profits with the city and guaranteeing a fixed five-cent fare.nycsubway.org ‚Äî The Dual System of Rapid Transit (1912) =BRT= Starting in 1899, the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT; 1896‚Äì1923) and Brooklyn‚ÄìManhattan Transit Corporation (BMT; 1923‚Äì1940) operated rapid transit lines in New York City ‚Äî at first only elevated railways and later also subways. The BRT was incorporated January 18, 1896, and took over the bankrupt Long Island Traction Company in early February, acquiring the Brooklyn Heights Railroad and the lessee of the Brooklyn City Rail Road. It then acquired the Brooklyn, Queens County and Suburban Railroad. The BRT took over the property of a number of surface railroads, the earliest of which, the Brooklyn, Bath and Coney Island Railroad or West End Line, opened for passenger service on October 9, 1863, between Fifth Avenue at 36th Street at the border of Brooklyn City and Bath Beach in the Town of Gravesend, New York. A short piece of surface route of this railroad, the BMT West End Line (today's ) on the west side of the Coney Island Complex north of the Coney Island Creek, is the oldest existing piece of rapid transit right-of-way in New York City and in the U.S., having opened on June 8, 1864.The Third Rail Online - Gunther and His Railroad On January 30, 1899, the Brooklyn Union Elevated Railroad was incorporated; it acquired the property of the bankrupt Brooklyn Elevated Railroad on February 17. The BRT gained control a month later, on March 25, and leased the elevated company to the Brooklyn Heights Railroad, which was until then solely a street railway company. The other elevated company in Brooklyn, the Kings County Elevated Railway, was sold under foreclosure to the BRT on July 6, 1899. Initially the surface and elevated railroad lines ran on steam power, but between 1893 and 1900 the lines were converted to run on electricity. An exception was the service on the Brooklyn Bridge. Trains were operated by cables from 1883 to 1896, when they were converted to electric power.\\"Early Rapid Transit in Brooklyn, 1878 to 1913\\", nycsubway.org Routes in 1897 By 1900, The BRT had acquired virtually all of the rapid transit and streetcar operations in its target area. Only the Coney Island and Brooklyn Railroad and the short Van Brunt Street and Erie Basin Railroad remained independent; the former was acquired in 1913 or 1914.1914 Moody's Manual: Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company The incorporated lines were: * Sea Beach Railway, acquired in November 1897 and leased to the BHRR * Sea View Railroad (Coney Island Elevated), acquired in November 1897 and leased to the BHRR * Nassau Electric Railroad (lessee of the Atlantic Avenue Railroad, Brooklyn, Bath and West End Railroad, Coney Island and Gravesend Railway, and South Brooklyn Railway), acquired in November 1898 and leased to the BHRR in April 1899 * Brooklyn Elevated Railroad, acquired in March 1899 and leased to the BHRR in April 1899 * Brooklyn and Brighton Beach Railroad (Brighton Beach Line), acquired in March 1899 * Kings County Elevated Railroad (Fulton Street Line), acquired in November 1899 and merged into the Brooklyn Union Elevated on May 24, 1900 * Prospect Park and Coney Island Railroad (Culver Line), leased to the BHRR on June 18, 1899 The BRT became bankrupt by 1918. The New York Consolidated Railroad and New York Municipal Railway were merged in June 1923, the same month that the BRT was reorganized as the Brooklyn‚ÄìManhattan Transit Corporation, to form the New York Rapid Transit Corporation. ContractsOriginal IRT contracts= 1906 IRT map A contract, later known as Contract 1, was executed on February 21, 1900, between the commission and the Rapid Transit Construction Company, organized by John B. McDonald and funded by August Belmont, for the construction of the subway and a 50-year operating lease from the opening of the line. Ground was broken at City Hall on March 24. A plan for an extension from City Hall to the Long Island Rail Road's Flatbush Avenue terminal station (now known as Atlantic Terminal) in Brooklyn was adopted on January 24, 1901, and Contract 2, giving a lease of 35 years, was executed between the commission and the Rapid Transit Construction Company on September 11, with construction beginning at State Street in Manhattan on November 8, 1902. Belmont incorporated the IRT in April 1902 as the operating company for both contracts; the IRT leased the Manhattan Railway, operator of the four elevated railway lines in Manhattan and the Bronx, on April 1, 1903. Operation of the subway began on October 27, 1904, with the opening of all stations from City Hall to 145th Street on the West Side Branch. Service was extended to 157th Street on November 12, 1904. The West Side Branch was extended northward to a temporary terminus of 221st Street and Broadway on March 12, 1906.New York Times, Farthest North in Town by the Interborough, January 14, 1907, page 18 This extension was served by shuttle trains operating between 157th Street and 221st Street.https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/1906_IRT_map_north.png The original system as included in Contract 1 was completed on January 14, 1907, when trains started running across the Harlem Ship Canal on the Broadway Bridge to 225th Street, meaning that 221st Street could be closed. Once the line was extended to 225th Street, the structure of the 221st Street was dismantled and was moved to 230th Street for a new temporary terminus. Service was extended to the temporary terminus at 230th Street on January 27, 1907. An extension of Contract 1 north to 242nd Street at Van Cortlandt Park was approved in 1906James Blaine Walker, Fifty Years of Rapid Transit, 1864-1917, published 1918, p. 204 and opened on August 1, 1908.New York Times, Our First Subway Completed at Last, August 2, 1908, page 10 (The original plan had been to turn east on 230th Street to just west of Bailey Avenue, at the New York Central Railroad's Kings Bridge station.Burroughs and Company, the New York City Subway Souvenir, 1904) When the line was extended to 242nd Street the temporary platforms at 230th Street were dismantled, and were rumored to be brought to 242 Street to serve as the station's side platforms. There were two stations on the line that opened later; 191st Street and 207th Street. 191st Street was not open until January 14, 1911, because the elevators and other work had not yet been completed. 207th Street was completed in 1906, but since it was located in a sparsely occupied area, the station was opened in 1907. The initial segment of the IRT White Plains Road Line opened on November 26, 1904, between East 180th Street and Jackson Avenue. Initially, trains on the line were served by elevated trains from the IRT Second Avenue Line and the IRT Third Avenue Line, with a connection running from the Third Avenue local tracks at Third Avenue and 149th Street to Westchester Avenue and Eagle Avenue. Once the connection to the IRT Lenox Avenue Line opened on July 10, 1905, trains from the newly opened IRT subway ran via the line. Elevated service via this connection was resumed on October 1, 1907, when Second Avenue locals were extended to Freeman Street during rush hours. The line was then extended to Fulton Street on January 16, 1905, to Wall Street on June 12, 1905, and to Bowling Green and South Ferry on July 10, 1905. In order to complete Contract 2, the subway had to be extended under the East River to reach Brooklyn. The tunnel was named the Joralemon Street Tunnel, which was the first underwater subway tunnel connecting Manhattan and Brooklyn, and it opened on January 9, 1908, extending the subway from Bowling Green to Borough Hall. On May 1, 1908, the construction of Contract 2 was completed when the line was extended from Borough Hall to Atlantic Avenue near the Flatbush Avenue LIRR station. When the IRT extension to Brooklyn opened, riders on the BRT's elevated and trolley lines over the Brooklyn Bridge began using the new subway. =Electrification= IRT main powerhouse in 1904 The subway system began during the war of the currents when Thomas Edison and his opponent, George Westinghouse, struggled over acceptance of direct current or alternating current as the standard way to deliver electricity. Alternating current became the standard for non-railroad purposes, but New York City Subway adopted direct current as more suitable for urban railroad purposes. The companies built their own power stations to generate their DC. To this day, the New York City Transit Authority converts alternating current to 600 V DC third rail to power the trains, as do most transit railways around the world. (The A Division uses 625 V DC third rail.) =Triborough plan= 1918 IRT map, after Contracts 1 and 2 were signed 1924 BMT map After the statutory debt ceiling for the now-united city of New York had been raised, there were more plans for subway construction until 1908. The Triborough plan comprised three new lines: * An IRT line from South Ferry‚ÄìWhitehall Street in Manhattan, with the IRT Lexington Avenue Line to Pelham Bay Park and Woodlawn in the Bronx * The BRT Nassau Street Loop, later the BMT Nassau Street Line. The BRT's track went over the Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Williamsburg Bridges; the Nassau Street Line was to connect to the Brooklyn Bridge, but never did. The connections to the other two bridges were built, but with the 1967 opening of the Chrystie Street Connection, the Manhattan Bridge connection was eliminated. * A BRT subway under Fourth Avenue in Brooklyn, leading to Bay Ridge and Coney Island. This corresponded to today's Fourth Avenue and Sea Beach lines. The BRT lines were built to wider profiles because the BRT did not want to use IRT trackage, which was narrower by comparison and carried far fewer passengers per hour. The design was inspired by the cars built for the Cambridge subway (MBTA Red Line) which were designed after studies were conducted on the design and operation of a subway car that could carry the most passengers the most efficiently. The rolling stock, however, had to be the same track gauge so the trains could interoperate under the Dual Contracts. The Fourth Avenue and Sea Beach lines were opened on June 19, 1915, after years of delays for building of these lines and the Nassau Street Line. The first BRT section, however, had opened on September 16, 1908, from Essex Street across the Williamsburg Bridge, but using narrow-width cars. Until the completion of the Fourth Avenue Line, there was a tram across the Manhattan Bridge which did not connect to any tracks in the New York City Subway. The track was called \\"Manhattan Bridge Three Cent Line\\" because the fare was three cents. Along with the Brooklyn and North River Railroad, the two streetcar companies began operations on those tracks. When trackage was connected to the bridge in 1915, the trolleys were moved to the upper level roadways until 1929, when service was discontinued. =Dual Contracts= The BRT, which just barely entered Manhattan via the Brooklyn Bridge, wanted the opportunity to compete with the IRT, and the IRT wanted to extend its Brooklyn line to compete with the BRT. This led to the city's agreement to contract for future subways with both the BRT and IRT. The expansion of rapid transit was greatly facilitated by the signing of the Dual Contracts on March 19, 1913. Contract 3 was signed between the IRT and the city; the contract between the BRT and the city was Contract 4. The majority of the present-day subway system was either built or improved under these contracts. The Astoria Line and Flushing Line were built at this time and were for some time operated by both companies. Under the terms of Contracts 3 and 4, the city would build new subway and elevated lines, rehabilitate and expand certain existing elevated lines, and lease them to the private companies for operation. The cost would be borne more-or-less equally by the city and the companies. The city's contribution was in cash raised by bond offerings, while the companies' contributions were variously by supplying cash, facilities, and equipment to run the lines. Queensboro Plaza was complex because the Contracts necessitated two different types of rolling stock and two different fare control areas. As part of the contracts, the two companies were to share lines in Queens: a short line to Astoria called the Astoria Line; and a longer line reaching initially to Corona, and eventually to Flushing, called the Corona Line. The lines operated jointly and began from Queensboro Plaza. The IRT accessed the station both from the 1907 Steinway Tunnel and an extension of the Second Avenue Elevated from Manhattan over the Queensboro Bridge. The BRT fed the Queens lines from a new tunnel from the 60th Street Tunnel to Manhattan. Technically the line was under IRT ownership, but the BRT/BMT was granted trackage rights in perpetuity, essentially making it theirs also. However, both lines were built to IRT specifications. This meant that IRT passengers had a one-seat ride to Manhattan destinations, whereas BRT passengers had to make a change at Queensborough Plaza. This came to be important when service was extended for the 1939 World's Fair, as the IRT was able to offer direct express trains from Manhattan, and the BRT was not. This practice lasted well into the municipal ownership of the lines and was not ended until 1949. Several provisions were imposed on the companies: the fare was limited to five cents, and this led to financial troubles for the two companies after post-World War I inflation; the city had the right to \\"recapture\\" any of the lines it built and run them as its own; and the city was to share in the profits. This eventually led to their downfall and consolidation into city ownership in 1940. As part of the Dual Contracts, the operations of the original IRT system changed drastically. Instead of having trains go via Broadway, turn onto 42nd Street, and finally turn onto Park Avenue, there were two trunk lines connected by the 42nd Street Shuttle. The system was changed from a \\"Z\\" system to an \\"H\\" system. The first trunk line, the Lexington Avenue Line assumed the portion of the original IRT system south of Grand Central. The line was extended northward with a new station at Grand Central and turned onto Lexington Avenue, where the line remained as four tracks. The line had connections to the new IRT Pelham Line and IRT Jerome Avenue Line in the Bronx, in addition to a new connection to the IRT White Plains Road Line. The second trunk, the Broadway‚ÄìSeventh Avenue Line assumed the portion of the original IRT system north of Times Square, and it extended southward with a new station at Times Square, running down Seventh Avenue, Varick Street and West Broadway. It was predicted that the subway extension would lead to the growth of the Lower West Side, and to neighborhoods such as Chelsea and Greenwich Village. South of Chambers Street, two branches were constructed. The first branch ran to the Battery via Greenwich Street, while the second branch turned eastward under Park Place and Beeckman Street and down William Street, running under the East River through a tunnel before running under Clark Street and Fulton Street until it reached a junction at Borough Hall with the existing Contract 2 IRT Brooklyn Line. On June 3, 1917, the first portion of the Broadway‚ÄìSeventh Avenue Line south of Times Square‚Äì42nd Street, a shuttle to 34th Street‚ÄìPenn Station, opened; a separate shuttle service, running between 42nd and 34th Streets, was created. This short extension was opened even though the rest of the route was not yet completed in order to handle the mass of traffic to and from Pennsylvania Station. Only the northern part of the station was opened at this time, and piles of plaster, rails, and debris could be seen on the rest of the platforms. This shuttle was extended south to South Ferry, with a shorter shuttle on the Brooklyn branch between Chambers Street and Wall Street, on July 1, 1918. The new portion of the Lexington Avenue Line from Grand Central to 125th Street opened on July 17, 1918. However, until the evening of August 1, 1918, it ran as a shuttle on the local tracks only, terminating at 42nd Street and at 167th Street on the IRT Jerome Avenue Line (where the connection from the elevated IRT Ninth Avenue Line merged). Finally, the new \\"H\\" system was implemented on August 1, 1918, joining the two halves of the Broadway‚ÄìSeventh Avenue Line, and the two halves of the Lexington Avenue Line. An immediate result of the switch was the need to transfer using the 42nd Street Shuttle. The completion of the \\"H\\" system doubled the capacity of the IRT system. The local tracks ran to South Ferry, while the express tracks used the Brooklyn Branch to Wall Street, extended into Brooklyn to Atlantic Avenue via the Clark Street Tunnel on April 15, 1919. The Dual Contracts resulted in the expansion of New York City; people moved to the newly built homes along the newly built subway lines. These homes were affordable, about the same cost as the houses in Brooklyn and Manhattan. The Dual Contracts were the key to dispersion of the city's congested areas. They helped alleviate densely population areas and probably helped save lives as people were no longer living in heavily diseased areas. The population in Manhattan below 59th Street decreased between the years of 1910 and 1920. People were allowed to move to better parts at the same cost and could have a better and more comfortable life in the suburbs. Independent System Mayor John F. Hylan was a strong advocate of public operation of the subway. He was fired from the BRT after working as a motorman for some time, and he wanted to avoid having to spend more money to recapture the IRT and BRT, so he tried to push the two operators out of business. To that end, Hylan had denied allocating money for the BRT by refusing to build new lines, refusing to raise fares (thereby putting the BRT in more debt), denied building permits so that some major building work lasted longer than planned, and even refused to build a new subway yard for the BRT. The Malbone Street Wreck in 1918 contributed to the losses incurred by the two companies, which led to the bankruptcy of the BRT in 1918. The BRT, however, was reorganized into the BMT. The IRT was almost bankrupt, but managed to complete the line to Flushing by 1928. Subsequently, Hylan drew up plans for a third subway network that would be city-built and -operated, in contrast to the existing subway lines, which were privately operated. On the other hand, New York City had grown to over five and a half million inhabitants and urgently needed new subway lines. The dual system could not keep pace with this ever-increasing ridership. So, a compromise solution was finally found that would allow Hylan's plans as well as the interests of private operators to be considered. However, the city's and Hylan's long-term goal was the unification and consolidation of the existing subway, with the city operating a unified subway system. The city, bolstered by political claims that the private companies were reaping profits at taxpayer expense, determined that it would build, equip and operate a new system itself, with private investment and without sharing the profits with private entities. This led to the building of the Independent City-Owned Subway (ICOS), sometimes called the Independent Subway System (ISS), the Independent City-Owned Rapid Transit Railroad, or simply The Eighth Avenue Subway after the location of its premier Manhattan mainline. After the city acquired the BMT and IRT in 1940, the Independent lines were dubbed the IND to follow the three-letter initialisms of the other systems. The original IND system, consisting of the Eighth Avenue mainline and the Sixth Avenue, Concourse, Culver, and Queens Boulevard branch lines, was entirely underground in the four boroughs that it served, with the exception of the Smith‚ÄìNinth Streets and Fourth Avenue stations on the Culver Viaduct over the Gowanus Canal in Gowanus, Brooklyn. =Lines= As the first line neared completion, New York City offered it for private operation as a formality, knowing that no operator would meet its terms. Thus the city declared that it would operate it itself, formalizing a foregone conclusion. The first line opened without a formal ceremony. The trains began operating their regular schedules ahead of time, and all stations of the Eighth Avenue Line, from 207th Street in Inwood to Hudson Terminal (now World Trade Center), opened simultaneously at one minute after midnight on September 10, 1932. On January 1, 1936, a second trunk line‚Äîthe Sixth Avenue Line‚Äîopened from West Fourth Street (where it splits from the Eighth Avenue Line) to East Broadway. The new subway line's construction required the suspension of streetcars on the avenue. The city, wanting to save money by not having to underpin the IRT Sixth Avenue Line before the elevated line was closed, bought the line for $12.5 million and terminated operations on December 5, 1938. To help compensate for the loss in service, service on the Ninth Avenue Elevated was increased. The first section of the Queens Boulevard Line, west from Roosevelt Avenue to 50th Street, opened on August 19, 1933. ' trains ran local to Hudson Terminal (today's World Trade Center) in Manhattan, while the (predecessor to current G' service) ran as a shuttle service between Queens Plaza and Nassau Avenue on the IND Crosstown Line. An extension east to Union Turnpike opened on December 31, 1936. The line was extended to Hillside Avenue and 178th Street, with a terminal station at 169th Street on April 24, 1937. That day, express service began on the Queens Boulevard Line during rush hours, with E trains running express west of 71st‚ÄìContinental Avenues, and GG trains taking over the local during rush hours. The initial headway for express service was between three and five minutes. 23rd Street‚ÄìEly Avenue station opened as an in-fill station on August 28, 1939. Upon its extension into Jamaica, the line drew Manhattan- bound passengers away from the nearby BMT Jamaica Line subway and the Long Island Rail Road. On July 1, 1937, a third trunk line, the Crosstown Line, opened from Nassau Avenue to Bergen Street. Two years later, on December 15, 1940, local service was begun along the entire IND Sixth Avenue line, including its core part through Midtown Manhattan. Meanwhile, on the East Side, the need for the IND Second Avenue Line had been evident since 1919, when the New York Public Service Commission launched a study at the behest of engineer Daniel L. Turner to determine what improvements were needed in the city's public transport system. The Great Depression resulted in soaring costs, and the expansion became unmanageable, so it was not built along with the other three IND trunk lines. Construction on the first phase of the IND was already behind schedule, and the city and state were no longer able to provide funding. A scaled-down proposal including a turnoff at 34th Street and a connection crosstown was postponed in 1931. Further revision of the plan and more studies followed. By 1939, construction had been postponed indefinitely, and Second Avenue was relegated to \\"proposed\\" status. The 1939 plan for subway expansion took the line not only into the Bronx (by now as a single line to Throggs Neck) but also south into Brooklyn, connecting to the stub of the IND Fulton Street Line at Court Street. Construction of the line resumed in 1972 but was ended during the 1975 fiscal crisis, and work was again restarted in 2007. Expansion plans Since the opening of the original New York City Subway line in 1904, various official and planning agencies have proposed numerous extensions to the subway system. One of the better known proposals was the \\"Second System,\\" which was part of a plan by the Independent Subway to construct new subway lines in addition and take over existing subway lines and railroad right-of-ways. Though most of the routes proposed over the decades have never seen construction, discussion remains strong to develop some of these lines, to alleviate existing subway capacity constraints and overcrowding, the most notable being the Second Avenue Subway. Plans for new lines date back to the early 1910s. On August 28, 1922, Mayor John Francis Hylan announced that his new system would comprise of currently operating routes and another 100 miles of new routes, to be completed by December 31, 1925, and in competition with the IRT and BMT. In 1926, a loop subway service was planned to be built to New Jersey.nycsubway.org‚ÄîExtensive Rapid Transit Plan Proposed for North Jersey (1926-1927) The most grandiose plan, conceived in 1929, was to be part of the city-operated IND. By 1939, with unification planned, all three systems were included. As this grandiose expansion was not built, the subway system is only 70% of what it was planned to be. Magnificently engineered, almost entirely underground, with platforms and flying junctions throughout, the IND system tripled the city's rapid transit debt, ironically contributing to the demise of plans for an ambitious expansion proposed before the first line of the first system was even opened. Because of this debt, after the IND Sixth Avenue Line was completed, only 28 new stations were built. Five stations were on the abandoned NYW&B-operated; IRT Dyre Avenue Line, fourteen stations were on the abandoned LIRR Rockaway Beach Branch (now the IND Rockaway Line), six were on the Archer Avenue Lines and 63rd Street Lines (built as part of a 1968 plan), two stations (57th Street and Grand Street) were part of the Chrystie Street Connection, and the Harlem‚Äì148th Street terminal. Four MTA Capital Construction-funded stations (the 34th Street station on the 7 Subway Extension and the three stations on the Second Avenue Subway) have been constructed with up to 14 more planned. However, the four MTA Capital Construction stations cost , reflecting the scale of the debt that the IND brought the city into. Unification The IRT Second Avenue Line, being demolished shortly after unification In June 1940, the IND's operator the New York City Board of Transportation took over the transportation assets of the IRT and BMT. In June 1953, the New York City Transit Authority, a state agency incorporated for the benefit of the city, now known to the public as MTA New York City Transit, succeeded the BoT. A combination of factors had this takeover coincide with the end of the major rapid transit building eras in New York City. The city immediately began to eliminate what it considered redundancy in the system, closing several elevated lines including the IRT Ninth Avenue Line and most of the IRT Second Avenue Line in Manhattan, and the BMT Fifth and Third Avenue Lines and most of the BMT Fulton Street LineB.M.T.

Division differences Despite the unification, a distinction between the three systems survives in the service labels: IRT lines (now referred to as A Division) have numbers and BMT/IND (now collectively B Division) lines use letters.nycsubway.org‚ÄîSubway FAQ: Letter, Number, and Color Designation Systems There is also a physical and less widely noticed difference, as A Division cars are narrower than those of B Division by and shorter by to .Observed Customer Seating and Standing Behaviors and Seat Preferences Onboard Subway Cars in New York City by Aaron Berkovich, Alex Lu, Brian Levine, and Alla V. Reddy. Because the A Division lines are of lower capacity for a given capital investment, all new extensions and lines built between World War II and 2007 have been for the B Division. A Division cars can travel on B Division lines when necessary but are not used for passenger service on those lines because of the dangerously wide gap between the car and the station platform. This stems from the IRT and BRT's long-standing disagreement where the BRT intentionally built cars that were too wide for the IRT. The interior of an IRT Third Avenue Line car before the line's demolition in the 1950s. The original IRT subway lines (those built before the Dual Contracts) were built to modified elevated line dimensions. Whereas the IRT lines were originally equipped with cars that were long, the cars designed for the IRT subway measure long. Both sets of lines did not permit cars wider than . The clearances and curves on these lines are too narrow and too sharp for any IND or BMT equipment. The later extensions of the IRT, constituting the bulk of the IRT system, were built to wider dimensions, and so are of a profile that could support the use of IND/BMT sized equipment. In other words, B Division equipment could operate on much of A Division if station platforms were trimmed and trackside furniture moved, thus letting A Division service carry more passengers. However, there is virtually no chance of this happening because the older, narrower portions of A Division are centrally situated, such that it would be impossible to put together coherent through services. The most that can be reasonably hoped for is that some branch lines of Division A might be resized and attached to B Division lines. This was done with the BMT Astoria Line in Queens (which had formerly been dual-operated with normal IRT trains and special narrow BMT shuttles). Post-unification expansion and reorganization New York hoped that the profits from the remaining formerly privately operated routes would support the expensive and deficit-ridden IND lines and simultaneously be able to repay the systems' debts, without having to increase the original fare of five cents. But during World War II, which gave a reprieve to the closure of most rail transit in the U.S., some closures continued, including the remainder of the IRT Second Avenue Line in Manhattan (1942) and the surviving BMT elevated services over the Brooklyn Bridge (1944).Cudahy, Brian (2002). How We Got to Coney Island: The Development of Mass Transportation in Brooklyn and Kings County. Fordham University Press The Second World War also caused renewed inflation, which finally caused a fare increase to ten cents in 1947 and six years later to 15 cents. Ridership skyrocketted during the late 1940s, and on December 23, 1946, the system-wide record of 8,872,249 fares was set. Because the consolidation dragged in the first years after unification, some improvements in operational processes were rather slow, and soon the question of organization was raised. The outsourcing of subway operations to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey was favored at one point. On June 15, 1953, the NYCTA was founded with the aim of ensuring a cost-covering and efficient operation in the subways. There was a need to overhaul rolling stock and infrastructure of the once-private routes, especially for the IRT, where nearly all of the infrastructure was aged. The oldest cars came there from the time the subway opened in 1904, and the oldest subway cars of BMT in 1953 dated from the system's first years, in 1913. Therefore, a total of 2,860 cars for the A Division were delivered between 1948 and 1965, which constituted the replacement of almost the entire prewar IRT fleet. On the B Division, 2,760 cars were ordered. Platforms were doubled in length systemwide. At some stations, gap fillers were installed because the station extensions were curved. Also in this period, the BMT replaced their signals. The Main Line R36 cars were the first equipment to be equipped with two-way radio as delivered standard equipment in 1965, with the first use of radio in the subway system on the IRT Lexington Avenue Line in May 1965, and the first successful air conditioned train (R38) was placed into service July 19, 1967.\\"New York City Transit Authority: Facts & Figures 1979\\", New York City Transit Authority, 1979., pg. 17 (PDF) http://www.laguardiawagnerarchive.lagcc.cuny.edu/FileBrowser.aspx?LinkToFile=FILES_DOC/WAGNER_FILES/06.021.0058.060284.11.PDF In 1946, Mayor William O'Dwyer initiated a program to lengthen station platforms to accommodate ten-car trains. The first contract, which was completed on August 8, 1946, extended the platforms at 125th Street, 207th Street, 215th Street, 225th Street, 231st Street and 238th Street on the IRT Broadway‚ÄìSeventh Avenue Line for $423,000. Additional platform extensions were completed on the Broadway‚ÄìSeventh Avenue LIne on October 18, 1946. On this date the platform extensions at 103rd Street, 110th Street, 116th Street, 137th Street, 145th Street, 157th Street, 168th Street, 181st Street, 191st Street and Dyckman Street were completed. This project cost $3.891 million. The platform extensions at the Hoyt Street station on the IRT Eastern Parkway Line opened on November 15, 1946, being completed for $733,200. Stations along the IRT Lexington Avenue Line were next to receive the improvements. On January 24, 1947, the 23rd Street, 28th Street and 33rd Street platform extensions were completed, costing $4.003 million. Work was subsequently completed at the Bleecker Street and Spring Street stations for $1.97 million. The $1.992 million contract to lengthen the platforms at the Canal Street and Worth Street stations to the south was completed on April 26, 1947. On September 4, 1947, a contract extending the platforms for stations in the Bronx was completed. The first stage of the plan was completed on June 13, 1949, lengthening the platforms at Prospect Avenue, Jackson Avenue, Intervale Avenue, Simpson Street, Freeman Avenue, 174th Street and 177th Street on the IRT White Plains Road Line for $315,000. On September 14, 1949, the Chairman of the Board of Transportation, William Reid, announced that the program to lengthen 32 IRT stations had been completed for $13.327 million. Reid also announced that the Board had created a five-year plan to lengthen all remaining BMT and IRT stations to accommodate ten-car trains. A train on the IND Rockaway Line, opened in 1956 as one of two major expansions of the system in the mid-20th century Only two new lines were opened in this era, the IRT Dyre Avenue Line in 1941 and the IND Rockaway Line in 1956, with an extension of the latter to Far Rockaway‚ÄìMott Avenue in 1958. Both of these lines were rehabilitations of existing railroad rights-of-way rather than new construction. The former line was the City portion of the New York, Westchester and Boston Railway, an electrified commuter line closed in 1937, and the latter a line obtained from the Long Island Rail Road. While the latter is a long and substantial line, it consists mostly of a long right-of- way crossing Jamaica Bay with a single station on Broad Channel island and two branches on a peninsula that is only several city blocks wide. For a time, the IND Rockaway Line was considered its own subway division. The 169th Street station on the IND Queens Boulevard Line provided an unsatisfactory terminal setup for a four track line, and this required the turning of F trains at Parsons Boulevard, and no storage facilities were provided at the station. Therefore, the line was going to be extended to 184th Place with a station at 179th Street with two island platforms, sufficient entrances and exits, and storage for four 10-car trains. The facilities would allow for the operation of express and local service to the station. Construction on the extension started in 1946 with planned completion in 1949. The extension was completed later than expected and opened on December 11, 1950. This extension was delayed due to the Great Depression and World War II. Both E and F trains were extended to the new station. Decline The Culver Ramp was completed in 1954 Soon after the Culver Ramp was completed, parts of the ex-BMT Culver Line were demolished. This is a stub to the former line The originally planned IND system was built to the completion of its original plans after World War II ended, but the system then entered an era of deferred maintenance in which infrastructure was allowed to deteriorate. In 1951 a half-billion dollar bond issue was passed to build the Second Avenue Subway, but money from this issue was used for other priorities and the building of short connector lines, namely a ramp extending the IND Culver Line over the ex-BMT Culver Line at Ditmas and McDonald Avenues in Brooklyn (1954), allowing IND subway service to operate to Coney Island for the first time, the 60th Street Tunnel Connection (1955), linking the BMT Broadway Line to the IND Queens Boulevard Line, and the Chrystie Street Connection (1967), linking the BMT line via the Manhattan Bridge to the IND Sixth Avenue Line. By January 1955, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority could theoretically raise $1.25 billion effective immediately (). In his 1974 book The Power Broker, Robert A. Caro estimated that this amount of money could modernize both the Long Island Rail Road for $700 million and the Hudson & Manhattan Railroad for $500 million, with money left over to build the Second Avenue Subway as well as proposed extensions of subway lines in Queens and Brooklyn. However, Robert Moses, the city's chief urban planner at the time, did not allow funding for most mass transit expansions in the New York City area, instead building highways and parkways without any provisions for mass transit lines in the future. Caro noted that the lack of attention to mass transit expansions and routine maintenance contributed to the decline of the subway: \\"When Robert Moses came to power in New York in 1934, the city's mass transportation system was probably the best in the world. When he left power in 1968 it was quite possibly the worst.\\" Soon after, the city entered a fiscal crisis. Closures of elevated lines continued. These closures included the entire IRT Third Avenue Line in Manhattan (1955) and the Bronx (1973), as well as the BMT Lexington Avenue Line (1950), much of the remainder of the BMT Fulton Street Line (1956), the downtown Brooklyn part of the BMT Myrtle Avenue Line (1969), and the BMT Culver Shuttle (1975), all in Brooklyn, and the BMT Jamaica Line in Queens starting in 1977. The BMT Archer Avenue Line was supposed to replace the BMT Jamaica Line's eastern end, but it was never completed to its full extent, and opened in 1988 as a stub-end line, terminating at Jamaica Center. Much of the BMT Myrtle Avenue Line in Brooklyn was demolished. Pictured is the remaining portion in 1974 In addition, construction and maintenance of existing lines was deferred, and graffiti and crime were very common. Trains frequently broke down, were poorly maintained, and were often late, while ridership declined by the millions each year. As in all of the city, crime was rampant in the subway in the 1970s. Thefts, robberies, shootings and killings became more frequent. The rolling stock was very often graffiti-painted or vandalism-damaged both inside and outside. As the New York City Police Department was completely overwhelmed, the public reacted with unease, and the subway was deliberately avoided. Around 1980, the reliability of the vehicles was a tenth of their reliability in the 1960s, and 40 percent of the network required speed restrictions. Because there had been no further studies of the subway since 1975, one third of the fleet was out of use during rush hours due to serious technical defects. In addition, signs were fitted incorrectly, and spare parts were missing or were bought in too large quantities, could not be found, or could not be installed due to lack of repairmen. The New York City Subway tried to keep its budget balanced between spending and revenue, so deferred maintenance became more common, which drew a slow but steady decline of the system and rolling stock. Furthermore, the workers were consolidated into the Transport Workers Union in 1968. A pension was set up, and workers were allowed to retire after 20 years of service without any transitional period. About a third of the most highly experienced staff immediately retired, resulting in a large shortage of skilled workers. Rehabilitation started in the 1980s as part of a $18 billion financing program. Between 1985 and 1991 over 3,000 subway cars were overhauled and fitted with air conditioning to increase comfort, reliability and durability while deferring car purchases The TA only replaced the oldest cars each division, so it bought only 1,350 new vehicles. Increased patrols and fences around the train yards offered better protection against graffiti and vandalism. At the same time, the TA began an extensive renovation of the routes. Within ten years the tracks were thereby renewed almost systemwide. The Williamsburg Bridge and the Manhattan Bridge, which had strong corrosion damage, were refurbished over the years. The renovation of the stations was initially limited to security measures, fresh paint, new lighting and signs, but the TA also tried to improve the service that had been neglected. This ranged from new uniforms and training for the staff to correct destination signs on the rolling stock. Some subway services were also adapted to the changing needs of customers. Another stated goal was to reduce crime or at least an improvement in the subjective sense of security. At night, the railway police and members of the citizens' initiative Guardian Angels, formed in 1979, patrolled in the subway trains. In the 1990s, the crime in the city and its subway declined significantly.  Late 1950s and early 1960s  In 1956, the NYCTA chairman, Charles Patterson, proposed removing the seats from the trains on the 42nd Street Shuttle to increase the passenger load. On May 1, 1957, a standard maximum interval of 20 minutes between trains was put into place during late nights, with the exception of the Rockaway lines where it was 24 minutes. Some lines had service run as infrequently as 30 minutes. Also on this date, BMT express service was extended to 57th Street from 42nd Street. Earlier in 1957, local service on the BMT Jamaica Line was extended to Crescent Street from Eastern Parkway, and rush hour service was increased to run every 5 minutes. Under a $100 million rebuilding program, increased and lengthened service was implemented during peak hours on the 1 train. Switching at a junction north of 96th Street, delayed service as trains from the Lenox Avenue Line which ran local switched from the express to the local, while trains from the Broadway Branch that ran express switched from the local to the express. This bottleneck was removed on February 6, 1959. All Broadway trains were locals, and all Lenox Avenue trains were expresses, eliminating the need to switch tracks. All 3 trains began to run express south of 96th Street on that date running to Brooklyn. 1 trains began to run between 242nd Street and South Ferry all times. Trains began to be branded as Hi-Speed Locals, being as fast as the old express service was with 8-car trains consisting of new R21s and R22s on the line. On November 15, 1962, the express platforms at Lexington Avenue‚Äì59th Street opened to reduce transfer congestion at Grand Central‚Äì42nd Street, and to allow transfers between the express trains and BMT trains to Queens. Even before the express platforms were added, this station was the busiest on the line.* \\"IRT Will Open Express Station at Lexington and 59th Thursday\\", New York Times; November 9, 1962; page 37 * \\"IRT Express Stop Opens at 59th St.\\", New York Times; November 16, 1962; page 22 Construction on the express station had begun on August 10, 1959. Program for Action A Second Avenue Subway tunnel In the mid-1960s, was made available to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) of New York City for a large subway expansion proposed by then-Mayor John Lindsay. About $1.23 billion was spent to create three tunnels and a half-dozen holes as part of construction on the Second Avenue and 63rd Street Lines. Construction for the lines stopped in 1975 because the city almost went bankrupt, yet none of the lines were done when federal payments were suspended in 1985. The two-phase Program for Action was funded as follows: * Phase I was to cost $1.6 billion and be completed over the span of a decade. * Phase II came after Phase I and cost $1.3 billion. Phase II was composed of mostly extensions of existing lines and Phase I-built lines. The Program for Action also called for supplanting elevated structures with new subways. The eastern end of the BMT Jamaica Line was to be replaced with the BMT Archer Avenue Line, while the IRT Third Avenue Line was to be demolished to make way for a subway route parallel to the Metro-North tracks at Park Avenue. Deferred maintenance Because the early subway systems competed with each other, they tended to cover the same areas of the city, leading to much overlapping service. The amount of service has actually decreased since the 1940s as many elevated railways were torn down, and finding funding for underground replacements has proven difficult. The subway's decline began in the 1960s and continued through the late 1980s. =Graffiti= Fast food stands operated in stations until the 1980s A typical graffiti-tagged car in 1979 A graffitied car on the IRT Lexington Avenue Line (1973) In 1973, the city's graffiti epidemic surged so that nearly every subway car was tagged with graffiti.David Grazian, \\"Mix It Up\\", W W Norton & Co Inc, 2010, , p.14 It was worsened by the budgetary restraints on New York City, which limited its ability to remove graffiti and perform transit maintenance. Mayor John Lindsay declared the first war on graffiti in 1972, but it would be a while before the city was able and willing to dedicate enough resources to that problem to start impacting the growing subculture. The MTA tried rubbing the graffiti off with an acid solution, but maintaining the cars to keep them relatively graffiti-free was costing them around $1.3 million annually. In the winter of 1973, the car-washing program was stopped. Attempts to wash cars with an acid solution in September 1974 were detrimental to the fleets' upkeep. As graffiti became associated with crime, many demanded that the government take a more serious stance toward it, particularly after the popularization of the Fixing Broken Windows philosophy in 1982. By the 1980s, increased police surveillance and implementation of increased security measures (razor wire, guard dogs) combined with continuous efforts to clean it up led to the weakening of the New York's graffiti subculture. An extensive car-washing program in the late 1980s ensured the elimination of graffiti throughout the system's rolling stock. In 1984 the NYCTA began a five-year program to eradicate graffiti. The years between 1985 and 1989 became known as the \\"die hard\\" era. A last shot for the graffiti artists of this time was in the form of subway cars destined for the scrap yard. With the increased security, the previous elaborate \\"burners\\" on the outside of cars were now marred with simplistic marker tags which often soaked through the paint. By mid-1986 the NYCTA were winning their \\"war on graffiti\\". On May 10, 1989, the rolling stock was made 100% graffiti-free, with the washing of the last train in the subway system that still had graffiti.About New York City Graffiti, part 2 As the population of artists lowered so did the violence associated with graffiti crews and \\"bombing\\".About New York City Graffiti, part 1 =Ridership and service cuts= Ridership in 1975 had decreased to a point last seen in 1918, with ridership decreasing by 25 million per year. The MTA reduced the length of trains during off-peak periods, and canceled work on several projects being built as part of the Program for Action, including the Second Avenue Subway and an LIRR line through the 63rd Street Tunnel to a Metropolitan Transportation Center in East Midtown, Manhattan. Ridership kept dropping rapidly, having decreased by 25 million passengers between June 30, 1976, and June 30, 1977; in the previous eight years, 327 million passengers had stopped using the subway. Additionally, the proportion of the fleet that was in service during the morning peak period was reduced, and train headways were increased: on four local services, trains were reduced from once every four minutes to once every five minutes. On May 27, 1975, the NYCTA announced that in September of that year 94 daily IRT trips would be discontinued, accounting for 4 percent of then-existing service on the IRT. The trips were to be discontinued to cut operating deficits. Express service on the 7 was to be discontinued between the hours of 9:30 a.m. and 3:30 p.m. and was to be replaced by more frequent local service. Also, during the same month, the NYCTA was considering making the A train a local at all times except rush hours, when it would remain an express. On December 17, 1975, the MTA announced that a 4.4 percent cutback of rush hour train service would take place on January 18, 1976. The cutbacks, the third of the year, trimmed 279 train runs from the previous 6,900. Service was most drastically reduced on the Lexington Avenue Line, with seven fewer southbound express trains during the morning rush hours. The cuts were the first of a three-phase program that was put in effect between January and July 1976. The cuts permitted a savings of $12.6 million a year for the NYCTA, which had an increasing deficit. Other subway services were changed or discontinued as part of the plan. On January 19, F trains were planned to stop running express in Brooklyn, and the GG was to be cut back to Smith‚ÄìNinth Streets. In April it was planned that all rush hour 1 trains would begin running to 242nd Street; these runs had previously terminated at 137th Street. During midday hours, trains on the 1 were to be shortened to five cars. In July, it was planned that the EE would be discontinued; N trains were to have been extended to Continental Avenue via the Queens Boulevard Line to replace it. Manhattan-bound N trains were to continue running express, while in the opposite direction they would run local. N trains would alternate between terminating at Whitehall Street or Coney Island during rush hours. CC trains, in July, were planned to be extended from Hudson Terminal to Rockaway Park replacing the E, which was to have been cut back to Hudson Terminal. The K was planned to be discontinued in July. The changes that were supposed to take place in July instead took effect on August 30. 215 more runs were eliminated on that date. In 1967 there were 8,200 daily trips, and on August 30, 1976, there were 6,337 daily trips. On December 14, 1976, the NYCTA proposed another package of service cuts. The cuts, planned to take effect in January 1977, would have eliminated service on the Bowling Green‚ÄìSouth Ferry Shuttle, the Franklin Avenue Shuttle, and AA service, which would be replaced by the A during late nights. GG service would be truncated to Queens Plaza during late evenings and late nights. B and N service would have been cut back to shuttles, running between 36th Street and Coney Island on their respective lines. It was also proposed that during off-peak hours 10-car trains would be cut to eight, six or four car trains. =Infrastructure= The BMT Sea Beach Line. Note the single express track; the other express track was removed in the 1980s due to deferred maintenance R46s, the newest cars in the system in 1976, broke down the most due to their cracked trucks The subway had been gradually neglected since the 1940s, and its situation had been exacerbated by the low fare. On May 20, 1970, two people died at the Jackson Heights‚ÄìRoosevelt Avenue station in the worst subway collision since the 1928 Times Square derailment. Following the 1970 accident, New York Magazine highlighted the subway system's condition in a lengthy expose. Even though each of the approximately 7,200 subway cars were checked once every six weeks or of service, four or five dead motors were allowable in a peak-hour 10-car train, according to some transit workers' accounts. About 85.8% of trains were on schedule in 1970, with 1,142 equipment-related delays in April 1970. However, issues such as broken lights, fans, and signs; defective doors, wheels, and brakes; and subway cars that often became uncoupled or \\"pulled apart\\", were still prevalent. One out of three IRT stations did not have running water in case of emergency. In addition, the system's staff were leaving in massive numbers, with 5,655 workers having retired or quit from early 1969 to mid-1970. The system also had many slow-speed areas because of obstacles that could cause derailments, and every subway car had graffiti; fleet availability during rush hours declined from 5,557 in 1976 to 5,025 in 1977, and to 4,900 in May 1978. Mean Distance Between Failures (MDBF) rates were at all time lows, as the MDBF rate system-wide was 6,000 miles by 1980. In 1979, 200 retired R16 cars were reactivated because the newest rolling stock in the system, the R46, had cracked trucks, and were only allowed to operate during rush hours while they were sent for rehabilitation. At the height of the transit crisis in 1983, on-time performance dropped below 50%. Hundreds of trains never made it to their destination and in 1981, 325 train runs were abandoned on a typical day. Additionally, cars caught fire 2,500 times every year. In December 1978 a New York Daily News article highlighted the worst parts of the subway. The Grand Central‚Äì42nd Street station was the worst underground station and the Middle Village‚ÄìMetropolitan Avenue station was the worst elevated station. The subway cars in the worst condition were the R10s. The subway line with the worst signals was the IRT Broadway‚ÄìSeventh Avenue Line, so the signals were upgraded in the 1980s. The BMT Sea Beach Line had the worst track; its infrastructure had not been upgraded since its opening in 1915. Despite $800 million being allocated by the state in 1978, the TA had spent less than half of the $600 million allocated in 1967. The agency made some infrastructure improvements, though because they were not cosmetic improvements, the public still assumed that the subway had high crime, even during periods of decreased crime. Due to deferred maintenance, the condition of the subway system reached dangerous conditions in the early 1980s, and the TA considered abandoning the Archer Avenue and 63rd Street projects. Structural defects were found in elevated structures systemwide and on the Manhattan and Williamsburg Bridges, causing frequent closures or delays on many subway lines during the 1980s. Reroutes from both bridges were necessitated; while the Manhattan Bridge, between 1986 and 2004, had two of its four tracks closed at a time for construction, the Williamsburg Bridge needed a shutdown from April to June 1988 for emergency structural repairs to be made. Federal funding for the repair of the BMT Jamaica Line was deferred throughout the 1980s due to the extremely bad state of the Williamsburg Bridge. Pigeon droppings corroded the bridge's steel, there were over 200 broken suspender cables, and concrete in the bridge began to come off and leave large holes. Due to low ridership and the increasing shabbiness of the subway, parts or most of several lines‚Äîthe BMT Canarsie Line; the IND Crosstown Line; the IRT Jerome Avenue Line or IND Concourse Line north of 161st Street‚ÄìYankee Stadium; and the BMT Jamaica Line east of either Broadway Junction or Cypress Hills‚Äîwere proposed for closure and abandonment in 1981. Other lines proposed for closure included the remaining part of the IND Culver Line, the BMT West End Line, the IRT Dyre Avenue Line, part of the IND Rockaway Line, part of the IRT White Plains Road Line, and the remaining part of the BMT Myrtle Avenue Line. The BMT Jamaica Line was demolished, mainly as part of the Program for Action, but also due to low ridership. Officials also proposed shutting the subway at night between midnight and 6 a.m. in order to reduce crime. Off-peak train trips, as well as trips on the branches outside the city's core, were reduced sharply. Operations in 1981 had deteriorated so that: * One day in January saw of the fleet out of service, and the first two weeks had 500 canceled trips per day * A 10-minute trip in 1910 took 40 minutes in 1981. * The previous year, there had been 30 derailments. * The A Division's fleet of 2,637 cars had never been renovated, and BDFM rates were a quarter of that in 1970. * The newest fleet, the R44s and R46s, made up of the B Division's fleet of 4,178 cars, and constantly broke down. * Furthermore, a sample of 50 cars in 1980 showed that half had serious maintenance problems, such as a flammable undercoat of metal film, flattened wheels, burned out lights, and defective/missing emergency switches. In 1986, the MTA and Regional Plan Association again considered closing of above-ground lines to follow population shifts. They included the Jerome Avenue, Dyre Avenue, Franklin Avenue, Crosstown, and Rockaway lines, as well as parts of the Myrtle and Jamaica lines. The south end of the Culver Line and the north ends of the IRT Broadway‚ÄìSeventh Avenue and White Plains Road Lines were also proposed for closure, as was all of the BMT Sea Beach Line. However, unlike the 1981 proposal, this plan called for a net expansion of the subway system, as of new underground and surface lines would also be built. =Crime= In the 1960s, mayor Robert Wagner ordered an increase in the Transit Police force from 1,219 to 3,100 officers. During the hours at which crimes most frequently occurred (between 8:00 p.m. and 4:00 a.m.), the officers went on patrol in all stations and trains. In response, crime rates decreased, as extensively reported by the press. Due to another crime increase in the subway, the rear cars of subway consists were shut at night beginning in July 1974. However, during the subway's main era of decline following the city's 1976 fiscal crisis, there were daily reports of crime. Two hundred were arrested for possible subway crimes in the first two weeks of December 1977 under an operation dubbed \\"Subway Sweep\\". Further compounding the issue, on July 13, 1977, a blackout cut off electricity to most of the city and to Westchester. Violence on the subway increased drastically in the last week of 1978, and six murders occurred in the first two months of 1979, compared to nine during the entire previous year. The IRT Lexington Avenue Line was known to frequent muggers, so in February 1979, Curtis Sliwa's Guardian Angels group began patrolling the train during the night. By February 1980, there were 220 Guardian Angels across the system. To attract passengers, in September 1978 the TA introduced the ‚ÄúTrain to the Plane‚Äù, a premium-fare service that provided limited stops along Sixth Avenue in Manhattan from 57th Street to Howard Beach, where passengers could transfer to a shuttle bus to JFK Airport. The service was staffed by a transit police officer, and the additional fare was paid on board. This was discontinued in 1990 due to low ridership and the high cost of its operation. The increase of crime in the subway led to the firing of Transit Police Chief Sanford Garelik. There were about 250 felonies occurring in the system every week by September 1979, around 250 felonies per week (or about 13,000 that year) were being recorded on the subway; some police officers had to stop patrolling quality of life crimes and look only for violent crimes. Among other problems included: While daily felonies were nearly halved between 1979 and 1980, decreasing from 261 to 154, overall crime increased by 70% in the same period. A series of window-smashing incidents on subway cars started in 1980 on the IRT Pelham Line and spread throughout the rest of the system, causing delays when damaged trains needed to be taken out of service. Over a thousand pieces of damaged windows were replaced between January 27 and February 2, 1985. Other actions included increasing the 60-cent fare to 65 cents to pay the salaries of additional transit police; putting a subway-crimes court in the Times Square station; and stationing a police officer in each car during night hours.\\"Cops Are Night Riders\\", New York Daily News, front page picture caption, June 6, 1985. Richard Ravitch, chairman of the MTA, said that even he was scared of going on the subway. Despite the MTA discussing methods to increase ridership, the 1982 figures fell to levels last seen in 1917. Within less than ten years, the MTA had lost around 300 million passengers, mainly because of fears of crime. In July 1985, the Citizens Crime Commission of New York City published a study showing this trend, fearing the frequent robberies and generally bad circumstances. As a result, the Fixing Broken Windows policy, which proposed to stop large-profile crimes by prosecuting quality of life crimes, was implemented. Along this line of thinking, the MTA began a five-year program to eradicate graffiti from subway trains in 1984, and hired one of the original theorists of Broken Windows policing, George L. Kelling, as a consultant for the program in 1985. In the early afternoon of December 22, 1984, Bernhard Goetz shot four young African American men from the Bronx on a New York City Subway train; the incident got nationwide media coverage. That day, the men‚ÄîBarry Allen, Troy Canty, Darrell Cabey (all 19), and James Ramseur (18)‚Äîboarded a downtown train (Broadway ‚Äì Seventh Avenue Line express) carrying screwdrivers, apparently on a mission to steal money from video arcade machines in Manhattan. When the train arrived at the 14th Street station in Manhattan, 15 to 20 other passengers remained with them in R22 subway car 7657,Photo ‚Äì interior of similar model car, an R-17, New York Transit Museum ‚Äì Goetz car was an R-22 with fiberglass seating the seventh car of the ten-car train. At the 14th Street station, Goetz entered the car through the rearmost door, crossed the aisle, and took a seat on the long bench across from the door. After Canty asked Goetz how he was, Goetz replied affirmatively, at which point the four boys supposedly moved over to the left of Goetz, blocking Goetz off from the other passengers in the car. They then asked Goetz for money. He fired five shots, seriously wounding all four men. Nine days later he surrendered to police and was eventually charged with attempted murder, assault, reckless endangerment, and several firearms offenses. A jury found him not guilty of all charges except for one count of carrying an unlicensed firearm, for which he served eight months of a one-year sentence. The incident sparked a nationwide debate on race and crime in major cities, the legal limits of self-defense, and the extent to which the citizenry could rely on the police to secure their safety. Although Goetz, dubbed the \\"Subway Vigilante\\" by New York City's press, came to symbolize New Yorkers' frustrations with the high crime rates of the 1980s, he was both praised and vilified in the media and public opinion. The incident has also been cited as a contributing factor to the groundswell movement against urban crime and disorder, and the successful National Rifle Association campaigns to loosen restrictions on the concealed carrying of firearms. In 1989, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority asked the transit police (then located within the NYCTA) to focus on minor offenses such as fare evasion. In the early nineties, the NYCTA adopted similar policing methods for Penn Station and Grand Central Terminal. When in 1993, Mayor Rudy Giuliani and Police Commissioner Howard Safir were elected to official positions, the Broken Windows strategy was more widely deployed in New York City under the rubrics of \\"zero tolerance\\" and \\"quality of life\\". Crime rates in the subway and city dropped, prompting New York Magazine to declare \\"The End of Crime as We Know It\\" on the cover of its edition of August 14, 1995. Giuliani's campaign credited the success to the zero tolerance policy. The extent to which his policies deserve the credit is disputed.Levitt, Steven D.: \\"Understanding Why Crime Fell in the 1990s: Four Factors that Explain the Decline and Six that Do Not\\", Journal of Economic Perspectives, 18(1), 163‚Äì190 Incoming New York City Police Department Commissioner William J. Bratton and author of Fixing Broken Windows, George L. Kelling, however, stated the police played an \\"important, even central, role\\" in the declining crime rates. On April 2, 1995, the New York City Police Department and the Transit Police Department merged. =Effects of the Program for Action= The IRT Third Avenue Line in the Bronx was a casualty of the Program for Action Ironically, the Program for Action forced the closure of a large number of subway lines. The Bronx remnant of the IRT Third Avenue Line closed in 1973, to be provisionally replaced by a new subway under the Metro-North Railroad tracks on Park Avenue, one block to the west. The single-tracked Culver Shuttle between Ditmas Avenue and Ninth Avenue, once a three-tracked line, closed on May 11, 1975.New York Times, Brooklyn's Culver Shuttle Makes Festive Final Run, May 12, 1975, page 20 On August 27, 1976, the service was truncated from Church Avenue to Smith‚ÄìNinth Streets, while service was discontinued on the K and EE routes. On December 15, 1976, GG service at the other terminal was shortened to Queens Plaza. The BMT Jamaica Line was truncated from 168th Street to 121st Street between September 11, 1977, and the early 1980s, replaced by the BMT Archer Avenue Line in 1988. =Debris falling from and on the tracks= Existing elevated structures posed a large danger; the New York Post published a story that featured debris that had fallen from the BMT Astoria Line. Debris from the IRT Pelham Line nearly killed a passerby, and debris from the BMT West End Line led to a lawsuit against the MTA. Concrete falling on the BMT Brighton Line near the Beverley Road station caused a months-long service disruption between November 1976 and February 1977. =Fare evasion= Fare evasion seemed a small problem compared to the graffiti and crime; however, fare evasion was causing the NYCTA to lose revenue.Weidner, Robert R. Target Hardening at a New York City Subway Station: Decreased Fare Evasion ‚Äì at What Price? In Crime Prevention Studies, Vol. 6, Criminal Justice Press, Monsey, N.Y., 1996. NYCTA's strategy for restoring riders' confidence took a two-pronged approach. In 1981, MTA's first capital program started system's physical restoration to a State-of-Good-Repair. Improving TA's image in riders' minds is as important as overcoming deferred maintenance. Prompt removal of graffiti Rivera, Joseph.

Similarly, fare evasion was taken seriously. The NYCTA began formally measuring evasion in November 1988. When TA's Fare Abuse Task Force (FATF) was convened in January 1989, evasion was 3.9%. After a 15-cent fare increase to $1.15 in August 1990, a record 231,937 people per day, or 6.9%, didn't pay. The pandemonium continued through 1991.Sims, Calvin. Despite Curbs, Fare Beating Is Surging Again in Subways. In the New York Times, August 16, 1991. To combat the mounting problem, FATF designated 305 ‚Äútarget stations‚Äù with most evaders for intensive enforcement and monitoring. Teams of uniformed and undercover police officers randomly conducted ‚Äúmini-sweeps‚Äù, swarming and arresting groups of evaders.Bratton, William and P. Knobler. Ch. 9. In The Turnaround: How America's Top Cop Reversed the Crime Epidemic. Random House, New York, N.Y., 1998.

In New York Times, February 18, 1991. Fare abuse agents covered turnstiles in shifts and issued citations. Plainclothes surveyors collected data for five hours per week at target locations, predominantly during morning peak hours. Finally, in 1992, evasion began to show a steady and remarkable decline, dropping to about 2.7% in 1994.Hom, Keith J. Reinventing Transit: the Twenty-Year ‚ÄúOvernight‚Äù Success Story of NYC Transit. Presented at the Metropolitan Conference on Public Transportation Research, Chicago, Ill., June 11, 1999. The dramatic decrease in evasion during this period coincided with a reinvigorated Transit Police, a 25% expansion of City police, and a general drop in crime in U.S. cities. In the city, crime rate decline begun in 1991 under Mayor David Dinkins and continued through next two decades under Mayors Rudolph Giuliani and Michael Bloomberg. Some observers credited the ‚Äúbroken windows‚Äù approach of law enforcement Kelling, George L., and J. Q. Wilson. Broken Windows: The Police and Neighborhood Safety.

Regardless of causality, evasion checks resulted in many arrests for outstanding warrants or weapons charges, likely contributing somewhat to public safety improvements. Arrests weren't the only way to combat evasions, and by the early 1990s NYCTA was examining methods to improve fare control passenger throughputs, reduce fare collection costs, and maintain control over evasions and general grime. The AFC system was being designed, and evasion-preventing capability was a key consideration. TA's queuing studies concluded that purchasing tokens from clerks was not efficient. Preventing 'slug' use required sophisticated measures like tokens with metal alloy centers and electronic token verification devices. To provide better access control, the NYCTA experimented with floor-to-ceiling gates and ‚Äúhigh wheel‚Äù turnstiles. Prototypes installed at 110th Street/Lexington Avenue station during a ‚Äútarget hardening‚Äù trial reduced evasions compared to nearby ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù stations.Weidner, Robert R. Target-Hardening at a New York City Subway Station: Decreased Fare Evasion ‚Äì at What Price? In Crime Prevention Studies, Vol. 6, Criminal Justice Press, Monsey, N.Y., 1996. However, controls consisting entirely of ‚Äúhigh-wheels‚Äù created draconian, prison-like environments, with detrimental effects on station aesthetics. Compromises with more secure low-turnstile designs were difficult, as AFC did not prevent fare evasion.Strom, Stephanie. Cheats Outfox New Turnstile For Subways. In New York Times, May 16, 1991. Production Automated Fare Collection (AFC) implementation began in 1994. New turnstiles, including unstaffed high wheels, and floor-to- ceiling service gates, featured lessons learned from trials. As AFC equipment was rolled out, evasion plummeted. Fare abuse agents, together with independent monitoring, were eliminated. Rehabilitation and rising trend The BMT Franklin Avenue Line (at Botanic Garden) in the 1970s was in a state of rapid degradation Ridership increased 4% between 1978 and 1979, mainly because of the improving economy.The Bulletin, New York Division Electric Railroaders' Association, January 1987, page 5. Numerous improvements were touted in a 1979 Daily News report, including air conditioning and closed- circuit television. As part of the Urban Mass Transit Act, $1.7 billion would be provided by the state and the Port Authority. Aesthetics chairperson Phyllis Cerf Wagner announced a program called \\"Operation Facelift\\", which entailed aesthetic improvements such as repainting and relighting the platforms, quicker replacement processes for windows and doors, and expanding the number of seats on platforms. During the mid-1980s, reconstruction began. Stations were refurbished and rolling stock was repaired and replaced. \\"Neighborhood maps\\" for wayfinding were added in subway stations starting in 1985. Maintenance of the subway began to improve: while 21 trains derailed while in passenger service during 1983, there were 15 such incidents in 1984 and three in 1985. \\"Red tag\\" areas, where trains reduced speed to 10 mph due to dangerous maintenance conditions, were almost entirely eliminated by 1986.\\"Wheels of Fortune: Case in Point 1 ‚Äì Looking for Mr. Goodcar\\", New York Daily News Magazine, March 23, 1986, page 26. The 325 R62 cars had a MDBF rate of 50,000 miles, more than five times higher than the other fleet, with the newly overhauled World's Fair R36 equipment on the Flushing Line averaging over 30,000 miles in 1986‚Äì87.\\"R36 MDBFs\\", R36 Preservation, Inc. http://www.coronayard.com/r36preservation/r36mdbf.html The MDBF of many rolling stock increased from 6,000 miles in 1980 to 10,000 miles in September 1986, and hundreds cars were overhauled or cleaned of graffiti. Speedometers were also installed on existing and new rolling stock. On January 1, 1982, the MTA implemented the first of its five-year Capital Improvement programs to repair the existing system. Scheduled Maintenance Services were formed to proactively replace components, and the MTA conducted general overhauls of the R26 through R46 fleets. Older equipment (any car classes with contract numbers below R32s on the B Division and R26s on the A Division) were retrofitted with air conditioning. The red tag areas were incrementally repaired and replaced with welded rail. At the end of the century, the MDBF rates for the entire system were at record highs and steadily increasing. The Franklin Avenue Shuttle, however, was worse in 1989 than it was in 1980, and necessitated a complete renovation by 1998, because the MTA planned to abandon the line by the end of the century. Projects during this time Atlantic Avenue ‚Äì Barclays Center transfer Starting in the early 1970s, there were plans for improving the subway system. In 1976, the MTA proposed abandoning the Franklin Avenue Shuttle to save money, but dropped the plan due to community pushback. The possibility of the discontinuation was revisited again in 1998, but again, fierce community opposition to it forced the MTA to rehabilitate the line. In 1977, the Linden Shops opened in Brooklyn, enabling the MTA to build track panels indoors throughout the year, among other objects. On January 16, 1978, the MTA opened three transfer stations: * Between the 14th Street station on the IRT Broadway‚ÄìSeventh Avenue Line and the previously-connected stations on the BMT Canarsie Line and IND Sixth Avenue Line * Between the IRT Lexington Avenue Line at Canal Street and the local platforms of the BMT Broadway Line * Between the BMT Brighton Line the BMT Fourth Avenue Line, and the IRT Eastern Parkway Line at Atlantic Avenue‚ÄìBarclays Center In April 1981, the following projects were considered by the MTA: * Switching the northern ends of the and trains * Adding a service via the BMT West End Line, running between the Financial District and Bay Parkway * Extending trains to 168th Street and eliminating service * Adding a K service via the Chrystie Street Connection from Canarsie to midtown Manhattan * Adding a non-stop express from 59th Street and the World Trade Center, which was ultimately untenable because of capacity constraints In 1981, the MTA began installing welded rails on a few underground portions of the system. In June 1983, the following projects were considered by the MTA: * The JFK Express would be extended to Rockaway Park‚ÄìBeach 116th Street, and the $5 fare and the special guard would be eliminated, making it like any other subway line. Trains would be 8 cars long instead of 4 cars long, and the headway between trains would be 18 minutes, instead of 20 minutes. * During rush hours, the CC would terminate at Euclid Avenue, instead of serving the Rockaways. * B train service would run all day from Coney Island to 168th Street, instead of terminating at 57th Street during non-peak hours. * AA service, which operated during non-rush hours, would be eliminated. * A new shuttle service, named H, would run between 57th Street and World Trade Center. On March 25, 1986, the Regional Plan Association (RPA) proposed several changes. A major part of the plan was eliminating parts of the system and expanding the system to reflect population shifts. The plan called for eliminating 26 miles of elevated lines and building 17 miles of new subway lines, and 20 miles of new surface lines. The RPA also suggested buying new subway cars; implementing One Person Train Operation outside of rush hours; giving reduced fares to city residents using the Long Island Rail Road or Metro-North Railroad to travel to Midtown Manhattan; adding premium-fee express services; closing 10% of stations; and doubling off-peak services. The RPA also suggested: * Extending the IND 63rd Street Line to southeast Queens * Building the Second Avenue Subway * Restoring the Rockaway Beach Branch * Building a subway line under Jewel Avenue in Queens, to branch off the IND Queens Boulevard Line * Building a tunnel under the Hudson River to extend the IRT Flushing Line to New Jersey * Complete the LIRR tunnel to Midtown * Provide the East Side Access to Grand Central Terminal via the lower level of the 63rd Street Line at a cost of $1.4 billion (to be completed in the early 2020s) * Purchase 500 new subway cars at a cost of $500 million. In April 1986, the New York City Transit Authority began to study the possibility of eliminating sections of 11 subway lines because of low ridership. The segments are primarily located in low-income neighborhoods of the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens, with a total of 79 stations, and 45 miles of track, for a total of 6.5 percent of the system. The lines were first identified in the first part of a three-year project, the Strategic Plan Initiative, which started in April 1985, by the MTA to evaluate the region's bus, subway, and commuter rail systems. The eleven segments all had low ridership, needed expensive rebuilding, and duplicated service on parallel lines. The lines being studied included the following lines: * The IRT Broadway‚ÄìSeventh Avenue Line from 215th Street to 242nd Street, which was duplicated by buses. * The IRT White Plains Road Line from East 180th Street to 241st Street, which was duplicated by buses. * The entire IRT Dyre Avenue Line, which was duplicated by buses. * The IRT Jerome Avenue Line from 167th Street to Woodlawn, which was paralleled by the IND Concourse Line. * The entire IND Rockaway Line south of Howard Beach, due to low ridership. * The IND Culver Line south of Avenue U, due to low ridership and duplication by buses. * The entire IND Crosstown Line, due to low ridership and duplication by buses. * The BMT Jamaica Line between Crescent Street and 121st Street, due to low ridership and duplication by buses. * The entire BMT Myrtle Avenue Line, which was duplicated by buses. * The entire BMT Sea Beach Line, which ran close to the BMT West End Line. * The entire BMT Franklin Avenue Line, due to major deterioration. Broadway ‚Äì Lafayette Street station to the northbound IRT Lexington Avenue Line at Bleecker Street By August 1989, the MTA was considering these projects:The Bulletin, New York Division Electric Railroaders' Association, August 1989, page 1. * Connecting the IND 63rd Street Line to the IND Queens Boulevard Line * Adding signals to the Queens Boulevard Line's express tracks so that trains could operate in both directions, and adding 250 subway cars * Completing the Second Avenue Subway * A connection from Parkside Avenue on the BMT Brighton Line to Seventh Avenue on the IND Culver Line, due to the Manhattan Bridge subway closures * 700 subway cars for the IRT * Three storage yards, two in Brooklyn and one in Queens * Expanding the terminal tracks at Flatbush Avenue‚ÄìBrooklyn College station * Building a 10-car platform for South Ferry station (IRT Broadway‚ÄìSeventh Avenue Line) * Building transfer stations ** The Broadway ‚Äì Lafayette Street station to the northbound IRT Lexington Avenue Line at Bleecker Street (done in September 2012) ** A connection between the South Ferry, Bowling Green and Whitehall Street stations (done between South Ferry and Whitehall Street in March 2009) ** Botanic Garden on the Franklin Avenue Shuttle with the Franklin Avenue station on the IRT Eastern Parkway Line (done in 1999) ** Closing the Hewes Street and Lorimer Street stations on the BMT Jamaica Line, and building a new intermediate station that connected with Broadway on the IND Crosstown Line. 21st Street ‚Äì Queensbridge, opened on October 29, 1989 In December 1988, three transfers were opened between existing stations, and three brand-new stations were opened. They were: * Lexington Avenue / 53rd Street and 51st Street stations * Long Island City ‚Äì Court Square and 23rd Street ‚Äì Ely Avenue stations (now known as Court Square and Court Square ‚Äì 23rd Street, respectively) * 42nd Street ‚Äì Port Authority Bus Terminal and Times Square ‚Äì 42nd Street stations The new stations were Sutphin Boulevard ‚Äì Archer Avenue ‚Äì JFK Airport, Jamaica Center ‚Äì Parsons/Archer, and Jamaica ‚Äì Van Wyck. Other service changes were implemented that day. Skip-stop service on the J/Z trains was also started on December 11, 1988. Additionally, IND Fulton Street Line express service was extended from weekdays only to all times except late nights. Discontinuous services on the , , and trains over the Manhattan Bridge were replaced by continuous services. New subway cars were also purchased: the R62 and R62A fleets for the A Division and the R68 and R68A fleets for the B Division. The R62 in particular was the first New York City Subway car class built by a foreign manufacturer. These were all delivered between 1983 and 1989. The R10, R14, R16, R17, R21, and R22 car classes all were retired with the deliveries of the R62/As and R68/As. On May 10, 1989, the last train with graffiti was taken out of service; the subway has been mostly graffiti-free since this point. On October 29, 1989, the IND 63rd Street Line was opened. It was nicknamed the \\"tunnel to nowhere\\" due to its stub end at 21st Street‚ÄìQueensbridge, and also due to the fact that the three-station extension lay dormant for over a decade after completion. The 3.2 mile line included three new stations and cost a total of $868 million. The line was viewed as an enormous waste of money. Revitalization and recent history= 1990s  Subway ridership increased through the 1990s. Throughout David Dinkins's mayoralty from 1989 to 1993, the city went from being in debt to having a $200 million surplus, which was achieved by raising taxes. However, Dinkins's tax plans were unpopular, and he lost the 1993 election to Rudy Giuliani. Giuliani wanted to demonstrate that he could successfully run New York City without raising taxes, so he eliminated $400 million from the MTA's capital budget in 1994. He did not suggest any transit improvements, however. State lawmakers also reduced MTA funding in the 1990s, which remained mostly unchanged through the 2000s.  September 11, 2001  Cortlandt Street was heavily damaged in the September 11 attacks and needed to be demolished. The September 11 attacks resulted in service disruptions on lines running through Lower Manhattan. Tracks and stations under the World Trade Center were shut down within minutes of the first plane crash. All remaining New York City Subway service was suspended from 10:20am to 12:48pm. Immediately after the attacks and more so after the collapses of the Twin Towers, many trains running in Lower Manhattan lost power and had to be evacuated through the tunnels. Some trains had power, but the signals did not, requiring special operating procedures to ensure safety. The IRT Broadway‚ÄìSeventh Avenue Line, which ran below the World Trade Center between Chambers Street and Rector Street was the most destroyed. Sections of the tunnel as well as Cortlandt Street were badly damaged and had to be rebuilt. Service was immediately suspended south of Chambers Street and then cut back to 14th Street. There was also subsequent flooding on the line south of 34th Street‚ÄìPenn Station. After the flood was cleaned up, express service was able to resume on September 17 with trains running between Van Cortlandt Park‚Äì242nd Street and 14th Street, making local stops north of and express stops south of 96th Street, while and trains made all stops in Manhattan (but bypassed all stations between Canal Street and Fulton Street until October 1). 1/9 skip-stop service was suspended. After a few switching delays at 96th Street, service was changed on September 19. The train resumed local service in Manhattan, but was extended to New Lots Avenue in Brooklyn (switching onto the express tracks at Chambers Street) to replace the 3, which now terminated at 14th Street as an express. The train continued to make local stops in Manhattan and service between Chambers Street and South Ferry as well as skip- stop service remained suspended. Normal service on all four trains was restored September 15, 2002. The Cortlandt Street station needed extensive reconstruction, and after a total rebuild costing $158 million, it reopened on September 8, 2018. Service on the BMT Broadway Line was also disrupted because the tracks from the Montague Street Tunnel run adjacent to the World Trade Center and there were concerns that train movements could cause unsafe settling of the debris pile. Cortlandt Street station, which sits under Church Street, sustained significant damage in the collapse of the towers. It was closed until September 15, 2002, for removal of debris, structural repairs, and restoration of the track beds, which had suffered flood damage in the aftermath of the collapse. Starting September 17, 2001, and service was suspended and respectively replaced by the (which was extended to Coney Island‚ÄìStillwell Avenue via the BMT Montague Street Tunnel, BMT Fourth Avenue Line, and BMT Sea Beach Line) and the (also extended via Fourth Avenue to Bay Ridge‚Äì95th Street). In Queens, the replaced the while the replaced the . All service on the BMT Broadway Line ran local north of Canal Street except for the Q, which ran normally from 57th Street to Brighton Beach via Broadway and Brighton Express. J/Z skip-stop service was suspended at this time. Normal service on all seven trains resumed on October 28. The only subway line running between Midtown and Lower Manhattan was the IRT Lexington Avenue Line, which was overcrowded before the attacks and at crush density until the BMT Broadway Line reopened. Wall Street was closed until September 21. The IND Eighth Avenue Line, which has a stub terminal serving the train under Five World Trade Center was not damaged, but covered in soot. E trains were extended to Euclid Avenue, Brooklyn, replacing the then suspended train (the and trains replaced it as the local north of 59th Street‚ÄìColumbus Circle on nights and weekends, respectively. The train, which ran normally from 145th Street or Bedford Park Boulevard to 34th Street‚ÄìHerald Square via Central Park West Local, also replaced C trains on weekdays). Service was cut back to Canal Street when C service resumed on September 21, but Chambers Street and Broadway‚ÄìNassau Street remained closed until October 1. World Trade Center remained closed until January 2002. Later 2000s With many parts of the system approaching or exceeding 100 years of age, general deterioration can be seen in many subway stations. =Ridership increases= Generally, ridership kept rising as the subway system improved in its maintenance, cleanliness, frequency, and on-time ratio; ridership started to increase as graffiti and crime rates dropped heavily after 1989. From 1995 to 2005, ridership on city buses and subways grew by 36%, compared with a population gain in the city of 7%. With dramatic increases in fuel prices in 2008, as well as increased tourism and residential growth, ridership on buses and subways grew 3.1% up to about 2.37 billion trips a year compared to 2007. This is the highest ridership since 1965. By 2013, ridership had reached 1.7 billion riders per year (despite closures related to Hurricane Sandy), a level not seen since 1949.mta.info‚Äî2013 Ridership Reaches 65-Year High In April 2013, New York magazine reported that the system was more crowded than it had been in the previous 66 years. The subway reached a daily ridership of 6 million for 29 days in 2014, and was expected to record a similar ridership level for 55 days in 2015; by comparison, in 2013, daily ridership never reached 6 million. = Expansions = Several expansions started construction or were opened during the mayoralty of Michael Bloomberg from 2001 to 2013. The IND 63rd Street Line's connection to the IND Queens Boulevard Line was first, opened on December 16, 2001. To serve the new connection, the F train was rerouted via the 63rd Street Line, and to replace the F along 53rd Street, a new V train was created‚Äìrunning between Forest Hills‚Äì71st Avenue and Second Avenue via the Queens Boulevard and Sixth Avenue local tracks. The G, to allow for room to operate the V, was cut back to Court Square. Two out-of-system transfers were put into place; the first was to allow F passengers to continue to have a free transfer to the Lexington Avenue Line, which was lost when the line was rerouted‚Äìthe transfer connects the Lexington Avenue/59th Street station and the Lexington Avenue‚Äì63rd Street stations. The second one connected the Court Square station with the 45th Road‚ÄìCourt House Square station. In 2003, money was allocated for the construction of a new station at South Ferry, and in 2005, construction commenced on the new station. Initially, the station's construction had been opposed because of the high cost and low perceived time savings. The South Ferry loop station only accommodates the first five cars of a train, so that the rear five cars of a 10-car 1 train cannot load or unload. Because of the curve at the station gap fillers are required, and as a result the new station was built as a two-track, full (10-car)-length island platform on a less severe curve, permitting the operation of a typical terminal station. The MTA claimed that the new station saved four to six minutes of a passenger's trip time and increased the peak capacity of the 1 service to 24 trains per hour, as opposed to 16 to 17 trains per hour with the loop station. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, talk began to circulate about taking up the construction of the Second Avenue Subway. Most New Yorkers regarded these plans with cynicism, since citizens were promised the line since well before the Third Avenue elevated was torn down in 1955. Funds have been set aside and environmental impact reports have been completed. A tunnelling contract was awarded to the consortium of Schiavone/Shea/Skanska (S3) by the MTA on March 20, 2007.MTA Press Release March 20, 2007‚ÄîFirst Construction Contract Signed for Second Avenue Subway; Work to Begin in April This followed preliminary engineering and a final tunnel design completed by a joint venture between AECOM and Arup. A ceremonial groundbreaking for the subway was held on April 12, 2007, and contractor work to prepare the project's initial construction site at 96th Street and Second Avenue began on April 23, 2007. 7 Subway Extension construction in June 2011 In October 2007, the 7 Subway Extension construction contract was awarded, extending the IRT Flushing Line to 34th Street. Groundbreaking began in June 2008 and the tunnels were completed by 2010. The project, which was the first one funded by the city in over 60 years, was intended to aid redevelopment of Hell's Kitchen around the West Side Yard of the Long Island Rail Road. =Budget cuts= The MTA faced a budget deficit of US$1.2 billion in 2009. This resulted in fare increases (three times from 2008 to 2010) and service reductions (including the elimination of two part-time subway services, the and ). Several other routes were modified as a result of the deficit. The was made a full-time local in Manhattan (in contrast to being a weekend local/weekday express before 2010), while the was extended nine stations north to Astoria‚ÄìDitmars Boulevard on weekdays, both to cover the discontinued W. The was combined with the , routing it over the Chrystie Street Connection, IND Sixth Avenue Line and IND Queens Boulevard Line to Forest Hills‚Äì71st Avenue on weekdays instead of via the BMT Fourth Avenue Line and BMT West End Line to Bay Parkway. The was truncated to Court Square full-time. Construction headways on eleven routes were lengthened, and off-peak service on seven routes were lengthened. 2010s and 2020sHurricane Sandy damage= South Ferry loop station closed between March 16, 2009, and April 4, 2013. It closed permanently in June 2017. Hurricane Sandy caused serious damage to the IND Rockaway Line and isolated one part of the line from the rest of the system, requiring the NYCTA to truck in 20 subway cars to the line to provide some interim service in the Rockaways. This shows one of the cars being loaded onto a flatbed to be carried to the Rockaways. On October 28, 2012, a full closure of the subway was ordered the day before the arrival of Hurricane Sandy. All services on the subway, the Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North were gradually shut down that evening. The storm caused serious damage to the system, especially the IND Rockaway Line, which had many sections between Howard Beach‚ÄìJFK Airport and Hammels Wye on the Rockaway Peninsula heavily damaged, leaving it essentially isolated from the rest of the system. This required the NYCTA to truck in 20 R32 subway cars to the line to provide some interim service, which was temporarily designated the . The H ran between Beach 90th Street and Far Rockaway‚ÄìMott Avenue, where passengers could transfer to a free shuttle bus. The line reopened on May 30, 2013, with a new retaining wall along the line to prevent against future storm surges. Several of the system's tunnels under the East River were flooded by the storm surge. The South Ferry suffered serious water damage, and on April 4, 2013, the older loop-configured station reopened to provide temporary service. The first tunnel to be repaired, the Greenpoint Tube under Newtown Creek, was fixed during a series of weekend closures in 2013 and a full closure during summer 2014. The second tunnel, the Montague Street Tunnel, was closed completely from August 2013 to September 2014. Hurricane Sandy also damaged the Clark Street Tubes, necessitating a full closure on weekends between June 2017 and June 2018, thus affecting 2, 3, 4, and 5 service. The new South Ferry station reopened on June 27, 2017, in time to accommodate the Clark Street closures. A week after South Ferry reopened, the MTA closed the BMT Myrtle Avenue Line for ten months to rebuild two of the line's viaducts, the approaches to the line's junction with the BMT Jamaica Line and Fresh Pond Bridge over the Montauk Branch in Queens. This was in preparation for a reconstruction of the BMT Canarsie Line tunnels under the East River. The MTA also planned to completely close the BMT Canarsie Line west of Bedford Avenue for 18 months between early 2019 and mid-2020. In April 2017, the shutdown was shortened to 15 months. The closure was changed to a night and weekend shutdown in January 2019. Other rehabilitation projects included: * Covering over 3,200 openings at ground level. , there are 19 contracts in progress and 11 contracts pending. In addition, a preventive measure, 68 subway entrances in Lower Manhattan are also receiving fabric plugs that are intended to keep flood water out. In 2017, waterproof doors and curtains were installed in 24 Lower Manhattan locations at a cost of $30,000 each. * Adding flood mitigation measures, like barriers, to the Coney Island, 207th Street, and Lenox subway yards * Adding flood mitigation measures to the IND Rockaway Line * Rebuilding other tubes. , the Steinway, 53rd Street, Cranberry, and Joralemon tunnels had been repaired, in addition to the Crosstown, Montague Street, and Clark Street tunnels. The Rutgers Street Tunnel was pending repairs. =Expansions open= Originally budgeted at $400 million, the new South Ferry station opened in 2009 at a total of $530 million, with most of the money being a grant from the Federal Transit Administration earmarked for World Trade Center reconstruction. In January 2009, the opening was delayed because the tracks were too far from the edge of the platform. Other delays were attributed to leaks in the station. The problem was corrected and the station opened on March 16, 2009. With the opening of the new station, a transfer was available to the Whitehall Street station with a new connecting passageway.NEW AND OLD DOWNTOWN: Wall Street and South Ferry. Forgotten NY. Retrieved June 11, 2014.South Ferry Station To Open Next Week On December 20, 2013, Mayor Michael Bloomberg took a ceremonial ride on a train to the new 34th Street terminal of the IRT Flushing Line, celebrating a part of his legacy as Mayor, during a press tour of the uncompleted station. The project was 90% complete in 2013, and was expected to open in 2014, but did not open until September 13, 2015. According to The New York Times, the delay in the extension's opening was due to the installation of custom-made incline elevators that kept malfunctioning. A December 2014 New York Post article also attributed the delay to Hudson Yards' developer, The Related Companies', need to dig caissons for the foundations, just above the subway station; the foundation work needed to be complete before the MTA could proceed with opening the station. The Fulton Center building opened to the public on November 10, 2014, completing a decade-long refurbishment of the Fulton Street station in lower Manhattan. It was controversially funded as part of the post-9/11 rebuilding project. 86th Street As part of the Second Avenue Subway's opening, W service, which had not run since 2010, was restored on November 7, 2016. On January 1, 2017, the Second Avenue Subway was opened, with stations crowded with passengers seeking to check out the new line. About 48,200 passengers entered the new stations on that day, excluding passengers who toured the line by entering at a station in the rest of the system. = 2017 state of emergency = Underlying the fanfare of expansions, however, there was a gradual decline in maintenance of the subway, and consequently, fewer trains started arriving to their destinations on time. Maintenance spending declined before rising again from the 1990s to 2012, but on-time performance slowly eroded during that same time period. By 2017, only 65% of weekday trains reached their destinations on time, the lowest rate since the transit crisis of the 1970s. In the summer of that year, the subway system was officially put in a state of emergency after a series of derailments, track fires, and overcrowding incidents. To solve the system's problems, the MTA officially announced the Genius Transit Challenge on June 28, 2017, where contestants could submit ideas to improve signals, communications infrastructure, or rolling stock. On July 25, 2017, Chairman Joe Lhota announced a two-phase, $9 billion New York City Subway Action Plan to stabilize the subway system and to prevent the continuing decline of the system. *See also: The first phase, costing $836 million, consisted of five categories of improvements in Signal and Track Maintenance, Car Reliability, System Safety and Cleanliness, Customer Communication, and Critical Management Group. The $8 billion second phase would implement the winning proposals from the Genius Transit Challenge and fix more widespread problems. Six winning submissions for the Genius Transit Challenge were announced in March 2018. In October 2017, city comptroller Scott Stringer released an analysis of the effect of subway delays on the economy and on commuters. The study found that based on a normal wait time of 5 minutes and an average wage of $34 per hour in 2016, \\"worst-case\\" subway delays of more than 20 minutes could cost up to $389 million annually in lost productivity. By comparison, \\"mid-case\\" delays of between 10 and 20 minutes could cost $243.1 million per year, and \\"best- case\\" delays of between 5 and 10 minutes could cost $170.2 million per year. In November 2017, The New York Times published its investigation into the crisis. It found that the crisis had arisen as a result of financially unsound decisions by local and state politicians from both the Democratic and Republican parties. By this time, the subway's 65% average on-time performance was the lowest among all major cities' transit systems, and every non-shuttle subway route's on-time performance had declined in the previous ten years. Several improvements were made in response to the transit crisis. In the short term, signals, trains, and tracks were improved under the \\"Fast Forward\\" program. Further, the MTA's 2020-2024 capital plan called for adding elevators and ramps to 66 subway stations and adding modern signaling systems to parts of six more physical lines, to be funded by congestion pricing in Manhattan. Additionally, several other changes were proposed to improve service. For instance, in February 2019, several politicians wrote a letter to the MTA, asking the agency to consider splitting the R train in half to increase reliability. In January 2020, Stringer sent a letter to NYCTA president Andy Byford stated that the \\"abundance\\" of shuttered entry points along subway routes was contributing to severe overcrowding and longer commute times, and requested that the MTA develop and publicize plans for restoring closed entry points. = Planning = There are several lines being planned. This includes a subway line under Utica Avenue in Brooklyn; an outer-borough circumferential line, the Triboro RX; a reuse of the northern part of the Rockaway Beach Branch; and a line to LaGuardia Airport. In November 2016, the MTA requested that the Second Avenue Subway's Phase 2 project be entered into the Project Development phase under the Federal Transit Administration's New Starts program. The FTA granted this request in late December 2016. Under the approved plan, the MTA would complete an environmental reevaluation by 2018, receive funding by 2020, and open Phase 2 between 2027 and 2029. Funding for Phase 2 was later included in the 2025-2029 MTA capital plan. The line will eventually comprise four phases, running as far north as 125th Street in East Harlem during Phase 2, and south to Hanover Square in Lower Manhattan in Phases 3 and 4. =COVID-19 pandemic= The spread of the COVID-19 pandemic to New York state, and thus to the New York City area, in March 2020 resulted in mass closures of gathering spaces. After the MTA recommended that only essential workers use the New York City Subway, ridership started to decrease. Part-time services were temporarily suspended. Starting on May 6, 2020, stations were closed overnight for cleaning, in what became the first planned overnight closure in the subway's history. The overnight closures would be a temporary measure that would be suspended once the pandemic was over, and during the overnight closures, bus service was added. Incidents and accidents=Train accidents Many train accidents have been recorded since 1918, when a train bound for South Ferry smashed into two trains halted near Jackson Avenue on the IRT White Plains Road Line in the Bronx.

Additionally, in an accident recorded before 1918, a derailment happened on the Ninth Avenue Elevated in Manhattan on September 11, 1905, resulting in 13 deaths and 48 serious injuries.Robert C. Reed, The New York Elevated, South Brunswick, NJ and New York: Barnes, 1978, , p. 138.\\"Catastrophe on New York 'L': Worst Accident in its History\\", The Summary, Elmira, NY, September 16, 1905. Other disasters Other accidents in the history of the subway do not involve trains; several people have been fatally electrocuted by the subway's third rails, and yet others have been fatally pushed onto the tracks. In 1960, someone nicknamed the Sunday Bomber set off a series of bombs in the New York City Subway and ferries during Sundays and holidays, killing one woman and injuring 51 other commuters.

It is located in Melbourne, Victoria, and covers an area at the mouth of the Yarra River, downstream of Bolte Bridge, which is at the head of Port Phillip, as well as several piers on the bay itself. Since 1 July 2003, the Port of Melbourne has been managed by the Port of Melbourne Corporation, a statutory corporation created by the State of Victoria. Most of the port is in the suburb of West Melbourne and should not be confused with the Melbourne suburb of Port Melbourne although Webb Dock and Station Pier, parts of the Port of Melbourne, are in Port Melbourne. Port Melbourne (or Sandridge as it was known until 1884) was a busy port early in the history of Melbourne, but declined as a cargo port with the development of the Port of Melbourne in the late 19th century. It retains Melbourne's passenger terminal however, with cruise ships and ferries using Station Pier. Infrastructure Victoria estimate that the Port of Melbourne will reach its capacity in 2055. In September 2016, the port‚Äôs commercial operations were leased to the Lonsdale Consortium, comprising the Australian Government Future Fund, Queensland Investment Corporation, Global Infrastructure Partners and Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System, for a term of 50 years for more than $9.7 billion. Facilities The Port of Melbourne consists of several major man-made docks on the Yarra River and Port Melbourne, including (from upstream to downstream): * Victoria Dock * Appleton Dock * South Wharves * Swanson Dock * Maribyrnong Berth * Yarraville Wharves * Holden Oil Dock * Webb Dock * Station Pier History In Melbourne's early days, large ships were unable to navigate the Yarra River, so cargo destined for Melbourne had to be unloaded at either Hobsons Bay (now Williamstown) or Sandridge (now Port Melbourne) and transferred either by rail or by cargo lighter to warehouses which were concentrated around King Street. This was an expensive and inefficient process. In 1877, Victoria's government resolved to make the Yarra more navigable and engaged English engineer Sir John Coode to devise a solution. His solution was to change the course of the river by cutting a canal south of the original course of the river. This shortened it by a mile and made it much wider. It also created Coode Island, a name still used today although the northern course of the river has long since disappeared. With these works, ships were now able to sail as far up the river as Queensbridge where a turning basin was constructed. Coode also oversaw the construction of Victoria Dock in swampland to the west of the city. This opened in 1889. Over time the docks moved progressively downstream as ships became larger and road bridges were built across the Yarra. The construction of the Spencer Street Bridge in 1928 and the Charles Grimes Bridge in 1975 each closed access to docks to the east. The barque Polly Woodside lying in the old Duke and Orr drydock, the warehouses of South Wharf and the Mission to Seafarers building are now the only reminders of the maritime history of this area. Expansion Three container ships berthed at Swanson Dock West Train loaded with containers at Swanson Dock East Development slowed during the Great Depression and World War II but resumed after the war with construction of Appleton Dock (1956), Webb Dock (1960) at the mouth of the Yarra and Swanson Dock, the first container terminal, on what was Coode Island. Eventually Victoria Dock became too small to handle large container ships and was closed. Its fate was permanently sealed by the construction of the Bolte Bridge, part of CityLink, across its entrance in 1999. It now forms the centrepiece of the Melbourne Docklands redevelopment. In 1991 a large fire at the Coode Island bulk liquid handling facility blanketed much of Melbourne in toxic fumes. The public outrage forced the government to investigate relocating the facility. Point Lillias near Geelong was considered. However, due to the high cost involved and local opposition the facility has remained at Coode Island. The Port of Melbourne was also the scene of a watershed industrial battle in 1998 between Patrick Corporation and the Maritime Union of Australia (MUA). Recently further controversy has resulted from plans to dredge Port Phillip to deepen shipping channels to allow larger ships into the Port of Melbourne. This process commenced in 2008 and was completed in November 2009. It involved removing more than 22 million cubic metres of sand and silt to provide a minimum 14-metre draught at all times. Opposition to this project stems from potential environmental damage due to silting and loss of amenity for bayside residents due to the noise produced by the dredges. The project was subject to the strictest environmental testing and monitoring requirements in the world at the time. These activities will continue on for many years to help protect the Port Phillip Bay ecosystems. In the future the Victorian Government will redevelop the Port of Melbourne to better integrate it with other modes of transport. The Melbourne wholesale fruit and vegetable market was relocated to Epping in 2013. Footscray Road is planned to be raised so that port users will have improved access to the rail facilities at South Dynon.

From May 2003 till May 2004, approximately 3,400 ships from 42 different lines called at the Port of Melbourne. The port handled 64.4 million tonnes of cargo, including a throughput of of cargo. In 2006-07 it became the first Australian port to handle two million TEU in a year. Rail access Railway goods sidings serve both Swanson Dock East and West, permitting the transfer of shipping containers between sea and rail transport. Originally provided in the 1960s with the development of the port, they were later removed and not restored until 2003 as a 1500 metre long siding. Rail sidings at Appleton Dock reopened in 2000 to serve a new export grain terminal at the port. Dual gauge access is provided to the majority of sidings in the area. Extensive sidings once served the Victoria Dock area, as well as Webb Dock which had a dedicated line.

It is also one of the largest art museums in the world with total area over 30 hectares. Creation The museum was established on April 13, 1895, upon enthronement of the emperor Nicholas II to commemorate his father, Alexander III. Its original collection was composed of artworks taken from the Hermitage Museum, Alexander Palace, and the Imperial Academy of Arts. The task to restructure the interiors according to the need of future exposition was imposed on Vasily Svinyin. The grand opening took place on the 17 of March, 1898. After the Russian Revolution of 1917, many private collections were nationalized and relocated to the Russian Museum. These included Kazimir Malevich's Black Square. Architecture The main building of the museum is the Mikhailovsky Palace, the Neoclassical former residence of Grand Duke Michael Pavlovich, erected in 1819‚Äì25 to a design by Carlo Rossi on Square of Arts in St Petersburg. Upon the death of the Grand Duke the residence was named after his wife as the Palace of the Grand Duchess Elena Pavlovna, and became famous for its many theatrical presentations and balls. Some of the halls of the palace retain the Italianate opulent interiors of the former imperial residence.Italianate opulent interiors , Russian Museum, Russia. Other buildings and locations, assigned to the Russian museum, include the Summer Palace of Peter I (1710‚Äì14) with the Summer Garden, the Marble Palace of Count Orlov (1768‚Äì85), St Michael's Castle of Emperor Paul (1797‚Äì1801), the cabin of Peter the Great, and the Rastrelliesque Stroganov Palace on the Nevsky Prospekt (1752‚Äì54). The project of Benois Building (or 'Corpus Benua') was developed in 1910-1912 by the famous Russian architect Leon Benois. The construction started in 1914, but was interrupted by the First World War. After Russian revolution, in 1919 the Benois Building was completed. In 1930s it was assigned to the Russian museum. Collection Today the collection shows Russian art from the 10th century up to the 21st century, covering all genres from the old Russian icon painting to contemporary art. Exhibits The Russian Museum of Ethnography The Ethnographic Department was originally set up in a building specially designed by Vladimir Svinyin in 1902.Russian Museum. Accessed 8 July 2008. The museum soon housed gifts received by Emperor's family from representatives of peoples inhabiting various regions of the Russian Empire. Further exhibits were purchased by Nicholas II and other members of his family as State financing was not enough to purchase new exhibits. In 1934, the Ethnographic Department was given the status of an independent museum: the Russian Museum of Ethnography. M√°laga branch The city of M√°laga, home to thousands of Russian expats, has signed an agreement to host the first overseas branch of the State Russian Museum. Works displayed in Malaga will range from Byzantine- inspired icons to social realism of the Soviet era.

It is now the only extant species in the genus Nephrops, after several other species were moved to the closely related genus Metanephrops. It lives in the north-eastern Atlantic Ocean, and parts of the Mediterranean Sea, but is absent from the Baltic Sea and Black Sea. Adults emerge from their burrows at night to feed on worms and fish. Description Nephrops norvegicus has the typical body shape of a lobster, albeit narrower than the large genus Homarus. It is pale orange in colour, and grows to a typical length of , or exceptionally long, including the tail and claws. A carapace covers the animal's cephalothorax, while the abdomen is long and segmented, ending in a broad tail fan. The first three pairs of legs bear claws, of which the first are greatly elongated and bear ridges of spines. Of the two pairs of antennae, the second is the longer and thinner. There is a long, spinous rostrum, and the compound eyes are kidney-shaped, providing the name of the genus, from the Greek roots (nephros, \\"kidney\\") and ops (\\"eye\\"). Distribution Nephrops norvegicus is found in the north-eastern Atlantic Ocean and North Sea as far north as Iceland and northern Norway, and south to Portugal. It is not common in the Mediterranean Sea except in the Adriatic Sea, notably the north Adriatic. It is absent from both the Black Sea and the Baltic Sea. Due to its ecological demands for particular sediments, N. norvegicus has a very patchy distribution, and is divided into over 30 populations. These populations are separated by inhospitable terrain, and adults rarely travel distances greater than a few hundred metres. Ecology A Norway lobster in its burrow, at the Oceanographic Museum in Monaco Nephrops norvegicus adults prefer to inhabit muddy seabed sediments, with more than 40 percent silt and clay. Their burrows are semi-permanent, and vary in structure and size. Typical burrows are deep, with a distance of between the front and back entrances. Norway lobsters spend most of their time either lying in their burrows or by the entrance, leaving their shelters only to forage or mate. Diet Nephrops norvegicus is a scavenger and predator that makes short foraging excursions, mainly during periods of subdued light. They feed on active prey, including worms and fish, which they capture with their chelipeds and walking legs, and food is conveyed to the mouth using the anterior walking legs, assisted by the maxillipeds. There is evidence that Nephrops norvegicus is a major eater of jellyfish.Sci Rep. 2017 Dec 12;7(1):17455. doi: 10.1038/s41598-017-17557-x. Direct evidence of an efficient energy transfer pathway from jellyfish carcasses to a commercially important deep-water species. Dunlop KM1,2,3, Jones DOB4, Sweetman AK5. Parasites and symbionts Nephrops norvegicus is the host to a number of parasites and symbionts. A number of sessile organisms attach to the exoskeleton of N. norvegicus, including the barnacle Balanus crenatus and the foraminiferan Cyclogyra, but overall Nephrops suffers fewer infestations of such epibionts than other decapod crustaceans do. In December 1995, the commensal Symbion pandora was discovered attached to the mouthparts of Nephrops norvegicus, and was found to be the first member of a new phylum, Cycliophora, a finding described by Simon Conway Morris as \\"the zoological highlight of the decade\\". S. pandora has been found in many populations of N. norvegicus, both in the north Atlantic and in the Mediterranean Sea. Individuals may be found on most segments of the lobster's mouthparts, but are generally concentrated on the central parts of the larger mouthparts, from the mandible to the third maxilliped. The most significant parasite of N. norvegicus is a dinoflagellate of the genus Hematodinium, which has caused epidemic infection in fished populations of N. norvegicus since the 1980s. Hematodinium is a genus that contains major pathogens of a wide variety of decapod crustaceans, although its internal taxonomy is poorly resolved. The species which attacks N. norvegicus causes a syndrome originally described as \\"post-moult syndrome\\", in which the carapace turns opaque and becomes highly pigmented, the haemolymph becomes milky white, and the animal appears moribund. Other parasites of N. norvegicus include the gregarine protozoan Porospora nephropis, the trematode Stichocotyle nephropis and the polychaete Histriobdella homari. Life cycle Adult female N. norvegicus with eggs The typical life span of N. norvegicus is 5‚Äì10 years, reaching 15 years in exceptional cases. Its reproductive cycle varies depending on geographical position: \\"the periods of hatching and spawning, and the length of the incubation period, vary with latitude and the breeding cycle changes from annual to biennial as one moves from south to north\\". Incubation of eggs is temperature-dependent, and in colder climates, the duration of the incubation period increases. This means that, by the time hatching occurs, it may be too late for the females to take part in that year's breeding cycle. In warmer climates, the combined effects of recovery from moulting and ovary maturation mean that spawning can become delayed. This, in turn, has the effect of the female missing out a year of egg carrying. Adult male Nephrops norvegicus moult once or twice a year (usually in late winter or spring) and adult females moult up to once a year (in late winter or spring, after hatching of the eggs). In annual breeding cycles, mating takes place in the spring or winter, when the females are in the soft, post-moult state. The ovaries mature throughout the spring and summer months, and egg-laying takes place in late summer or early autumn. After spawning, the berried (egg-carrying) females return to their burrows and remain there until the end of the incubation period. Hatching takes place in late winter or early spring. Soon after hatching, the females moult and mate again. During the planktonic larval stage (typically 1 to 2 months in duration) the nephrops larvae exhibit a diel vertical migration behaviour as they are dispersed by the local currents. This complex biophysical interaction determines the fate of the larvae; the overlap between advective pathway destination and spatial distributions of suitable benthic habitats must be favourable in order for the larvae to settle and reach maturity. Fisheries Freshly caught Nephrops norvegicus in Scotland The muscular tail of Nephrops norvegicus is frequently eaten, and its meat is known as scampi. The N. norvegicus is eaten only on special occasions in Spain and Portugal, where it is less expensive than the common lobster, Homarus gammarus. N. norvegicus is an important species for fisheries, being caught mostly by trawling. Around 60,000 tonnes are caught annually, half of it in the United Kingdom's waters. Besides the established trawling fleets, a significant number of fleets using lobster creels have developed. The better size and condition of lobsters caught by this method yield prices three to four times higher than animals netted by trawling. Creel fishing was found to have a reduced impact on the seafloor, require lower fuel consumption, and allow fishermen with smaller boats to participate in this high-value fishery. It has therefore been described as a reasonable alternative to demersal towed gears, and the allocation of additional fishing rights for this type of take has been suggested. The North East Atlantic individual biological stocks of Nephrops are identified as functional units. A number of functional units make up the sea areas over which a total allowable catch (TAC) is set annually by the EU Council of Ministers. For example, the TAC set for North Sea Nephrops is based on the aggregate total tonnage of removals recommended by science for nine separate functional unit areas. This method has attracted criticism because it can promote the overexploitation of a specific functional unit even though the overall TAC is under-fished. In 2016, the UK implemented a package of emergency technical measures with the cooperation of the fishing industry aimed at reducing fishing activity to induce recovery of the Nephrops stock in the Farn(e) Deeps off North East England which was close to collapse. A stock assessment completed in 2018 by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) shows that fishing pressure has been cut and this stock is now below FMSY and that stock size is above MSY Btrigger meaning that the Farne Deeps nephrops stock is being fished at a sustainable level. However, ICES also warn that any substantial transfer of the current surplus fishing opportunities from other functional units to the Farne Deeps would rapidly lead to overexploitation. This suggests that controls on fishing effort should continue at least until the biomass reaches a size that is sustainable when measured against the level of fishing activity by all fishermen wanting to target the stock. Discards from Nephrops fishery may account for up to 37% of the energy requirements of certain marine scavengers, such as the hagfish Myxine glutinosa. Boats involved in Nephrops fishery also catch a number of fish species such as plaice and sole, and it is thought that without that revenue, Nephrops fishery would be economically unviable. Taxonomic history Nephrops norvegicus was one of the species included by Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 10th edition of ', the starting point for zoological nomenclature. In that work, it was listed as ', with a type locality of ' (\\"in the Norwegian sea\\"). In choosing a lectotype, Lipke Holthuis restricted the type locality to the Kattegat at the Kullen Peninsula in southern Sweden (). Two synonyms of the species have been published ‚Äì \\"Astacus rugosus\\", described by the eccentric zoologist Constantine Samuel Rafinesque in 1814 from material collected in the Mediterranean Sea, and \\"Nephropsis cornubiensis\\", described by Charles Spence Bate and Joshua Brooking Rowe in 1880. As new genera were erected, the species was moved, reaching its current position in 1814, when William Elford Leach erected the genus Nephrops to hold this species alone. Seven fossil species have since been described in the genus. Populations in the Mediterranean Sea are sometimes separated as \\"Nephrops norvegicus var. meridionalis Zariquiey, 1935\\", although this taxon is not universally considered valid.  North American transplant  The Norway lobster has reportedly been transplanted and released in North America by Erik Jensen. Jensen procured 300-500 fertilized eggs and proceeded to introduce Puget Sound salt water each time a batch molted from the larvae stage. After two months in a salt tank, the Norway lobsters were released into Filucy Bay in Puget Sound near Longbranch, Washington.. The ethics and legality of this has been controversial.

The Chinese Eastern Railway (CER) was a railway in northeastern China (Manchuria). It connected China and the Russian Far East. The southern branch of the CER, known in the West as the South Manchuria Railway, became the locus and partial casus belli for the Russo-Japanese War and subsequent incidents, leading to the Second Sino-Japanese War and Soviet-Japanese border conflicts. Larger incidents included the Sino-Soviet conflict of 1929 and the Mukden Incident between Japan and China in 1931. The Battle of Lake Khasan was fought between two powers which had long mistrusted each other. Starting in the lead up to the battle a wave of purges in the far eastern front had caused many officers in the Soviet army to be new inexperienced officers who feared to take the initiative, in July alone four and a half times as many people were purged from the front as in the previous twelve months. This in combination with a lack of infrastructure, the overburdening of the front's commander, Marshal Vasily Blyukher (or Bl√ºcher), a shortage of equipment, and poor organization led to the front being in poor shape. The confrontation was triggered when the Soviet Far East Army and Soviet State Security (NKVD) Border Guard reinforced its Khasan border with Manchuria. This was prompted in part by the defection one month before, of Soviet General G. S. Lyushkov, in charge of all NKVD forces in the Soviet Far East at Hunchun, in the Tumen River Area. He provided the Japanese with intelligence on the poor state of Soviet Far Eastern forces and the purge of army officers.Regional CO-Operation in Northeast Asia The Tumen River Area Development Program, 1990-2000: In Search of a model for regional economic co-operation in Northeast Asia Build-up Camouflaged Soviet tanks On 6 July 1938, the Japanese Kwantung Army decoded a message sent by the Soviet commander in the Posyet region to Soviet headquarters in Khabarovsk. The message recommended that Soviet soldiers be allowed to secure unoccupied high ground west of Lake Khasan, most notably the disputed Changkufeng Heights, because it would be advantageous for the Soviets to occupy terrain which overlooked the Korean port-city of Rajin, as well as strategic railways linking Korea to Manchuria.Alvin Coox, Nomonhan (Stanford University Press, 2003), p. 124 In the next two weeks, small groups of Soviet border troops moved into the area and began fortifying the mountain with emplacements, observation trenches, entanglements and communication facilities. At first, the Japanese Korean Army, which had been assigned to defend the area, disregarded the Soviet advance. However, the Kwantung Army, whose administrative jurisdiction overlapped Changkufeng, pushed the Korean Army to take more action, because it was suspicious of Soviet intentions. Following this, the Korean Army took the matter to Tokyo, recommending that a formal protest be sent to the Soviet Union. The conflict started on 15 July, when the Japanese attach√© in Moscow demanded the removal of Soviet border troops from the Bezymyannaya (—Å–æ–ø–∫–∞ –ë–µ–∑—ã–º—è–Ω–Ω–∞—è, Chinese name: Shachaofeng) and Zaozyornaya (—Å–æ–ø–∫–∞ –ó–∞–æ–∑—ë—Ä–Ω–∞—è, Chinese name: Changkufeng) Hills to the west of Lake Khasan in the south of Primorye not far from Vladivostok, claiming this territory by the Soviet‚ÄìKorea border; the demand was rejected. Battle The Japanese 19th Division along with some Manchukuo units took on the Soviet 39th Rifle Corps under Grigori Shtern (eventually consisting of the 32nd, 39th and 40th Rifle Divisions, the 2nd Mechanised Brigade and two tank battalions).John Erickson (historian), The Soviet High Command, MacMillan & Co. Ltd, 1962, pp. 497‚Äì8 One of the Japanese Army Commanders at the battle was Colonel Kotoku Sato, the commander of the 75th Infantry Regiment. Lieutenant General Suetaka Kamezo gave Sato an order: \\"You are to mete out a firm and thorough counterattack without fail, once you gather that the enemy is advancing even in the slightest\\". The hidden meaning of this was that Sato had been ordered to expel the Soviets from Changkufeng.Alvin Coox, Nomonhan (Stanford University Press, 2003), p. 133 On 31 July, Sato's regiment launched a night sortie on the fortified hill. In the Changkufeng sector, 1,114 Japanese engaged a Soviet garrison of 300, eliminating them and knocking out 10 tanks, with casualties of 34 killed and 99 wounded. In the Shachofeng sector, 379 Japanese surprised and routed another 300 Soviet troops, while knocking out 7 tanks, for 11 killed and 34 wounded.Alvin Coox, Nomonhan (Stanford University Press, 2003), p. 133-134 Thousands more Japanese soldiers from the 19th Division arrived, dug in, and requested reinforcements. High Command rejected the request, as they knew General Suetaka would use these forces to assault vulnerable Soviet positions, escalating the incident. Japanese troops defended the disputed area.Alvin Coox, Nomonhan (Stanford University Press, 2003), p. 137 In 1933, the Japanese had designed and built a \\"Rinji Soko Ressha\\" (Special Armoured Train). The train was deployed at \\"2nd Armoured Train Unit\\" in Manchuria and participated in the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Changkufeng conflict against the Soviets, transporting thousands of Japanese troops to and from the battlefield, displaying to the west the capability of an Asian nation to implement western ideas and doctrine concerning rapid infantry deployment and transport. On 31 July, People's Commissar for Defence Kliment Voroshilov ordered combat readiness for 1st Coastal Army and the Pacific Fleet. The Soviets gathered 354 tanks and assault guns at Lake Khasan, including 257 T-26 tanks (with 10 KhT-26 flame-throwing tanks), 3 ST-26 bridge-laying tanks, 81 BT-7 light tanks and 13 SU-5-2 self-propelled guns.Baryatinsky, Mikhail. Legkiy tank T-26 (Light Tank T-26). Modelist- Konstruktor. Special Issue No. 2 (2003), pp. 45‚Äì46 The chief of the Far East Front, Vasily Bl√ºcher, arrived at the front line on 2 August 1938. Under his command, additional forces were moved up and from August 2‚Äì9, the Japanese forces at Changkufeng were attacked. Such was the disparity of forces that one Japanese artillery commander observed that the Soviets fired more shells in one day than the Japanese did in the two-week affair.Alvin Coox, Nomonhan (Stanford University Press, 2003), p. 135 Despite this, the Japanese defenders organized an anti-tank defense, with disastrous results for the poorly coordinated Soviets, whose attacks were defeated with many casualties. Thousands of Soviet troops were killed or wounded and at least 46 (or 45 unoperational because of gun fire and getting stuck in the marshes or damaged or 80 of which 24 completely destroyed) tanks were knocked out, with another 39 damaged to varying degrees.Baryatinsky, Mikhail. Legkiy tank T-26 (Light Tank T-26). Modelist-Konstruktor. Special Issue No. 2 (2003), pp. 45‚Äì46. The only tank losses listed were T-26s; casualties to other Soviet tank types are unknown. Of the 9 total losses and 76 damaged tanks, 39 were repaired by their units and the other 37 were repaired in workshops. After the Japanese pushed the Soviet border security unit, later reinforced by the 40th rifle division, from the hill and other positions the Japanese dug in while the Soviets reinforced their troops. Unlike the Japanese the Soviets didn't have a railway close to the battlefield but instead a single unpaved road so when Soviet reinforcements got to the battlefield the Japanese were already well entrenched. The Soviets had attacked Japanese positions by air during the preparations for a ground attack. On the morning before the Soviet attack, thirteen Soviet aircraft attacked the hill and twelve the rear of the Japanese forces, even though this isn't documented by all sources. This was followed by an attack of three Soviet infantry regiments however this attack didn't have artillery or air support, either because of poor preparations or in the case of air support possibly fog. Some sources however do claim that two artillery batteries supported the attack. The attack was supported by a tank regiment but regardless it soon stalled. This was largely due to the low preparedness of the Soviet troops. Some of the artillery was not ready, little was known of the Japanese dispositions, communications had not fully been set up and the left wing was not ready to start the attack at the appointed time. Despite the poor state of the Soviet force and the knowledge that the enemy was well entrenched the attack was ordered to go ahead. The tank crews had not been prepared for the hostile terrain so they weren't able to keep up the momentum. During the attack a number of commanders including the commander of the 40th rifle division's tank battalion abandoned their troops. On August 6 the Soviets renewed their attack. First multiple waves of bombers attacked the Japanese positions. This attack was delayed either because of fog or poor preparations. After the bombers an assault by tanks and infantry, including mechanized troops, supported by artillery was made. In the difficult terrain the tanks suffered heavy losses, only individual tanks made it to their objectives, all of which were destroyed or retreated later. During the attack an outflanking movement was made. The Soviets pushed back the Japanese after heavy fighting, the subsequent days the Japanese counterattacked but were unable to recapture their positions. The Japanese were pushed back by the Soviet attacks but were still on the battlefield. Despite not being forced off the battlefield, it was clear that the local Japanese units would not be able to keep Changkufeng without widening the conflict. On 10 August, Japanese ambassador Mamoru Shigemitsu asked for peace.–•–∞—Å–∞–Ω // –°–æ–≤–µ—Ç—Å–∫–∞—è –≤–æ–µ–Ω–Ω–∞—è —ç–Ω—Ü–∏–∫–ª–æ–ø–µ–¥–∏—è (–≤ 8 —Ç–æ–º–∞—Ö) / –ø–æ–¥ —Ä–µ–¥. –ê. –ê. –ì—Ä–µ—á–∫–æ. —Ç–æ–º 8. –ú.: –í–æ–µ–Ω–∏–∑–¥–∞—Ç, 1976. —Å—Ç—Ä.366‚Äî367–ê. –ê. –ö–æ—à–∫–∏–Ω. ¬´–ö–∞–Ω—Ç–æ–∫—É—ç–Ω¬ª ‚Äî ¬´–ë–∞—Ä–±–∞—Ä–æ—Å—Å–∞¬ª –ø–æ-—è–ø–æ–Ω—Å–∫–∏. –ü–æ—á–µ–º—É –Ø–ø–æ–Ω–∏—è –Ω–µ –Ω–∞–ø–∞–ª–∞ –Ω–∞ –°–°–°–†. –ú., ¬´–í–µ—á–µ¬ª, 2011. —Å—Ç—Ä.51-57 Satisfied that the incident had been brought to an \\"honourable\\" conclusion, on 11 August 1938, at 13 hours 30 minutes local time the Japanese stopped fighting and Soviet forces reoccupied the heights.–û —Å–æ–±—ã—Ç–∏—è—Ö –≤ —Ä–∞–π–æ–Ω–µ –æ–∑–µ—Ä–∞ –•–∞—Å–∞–Ω // \\"–ò–∑–≤–µ—Å—Ç–∏—è\\", ‚Ññ 187 (6654) –æ—Ç 12 –∞–≤–≥—É—Å—Ç–∞ 1938. —Å—Ç—Ä.1 Consequences Red Army soldiers celebrate after the Battle of Lake Khasan.

Soviet armoured losses were significant, with dozens of tanks being knocked out or destroyed and hundreds of \\"tank troops\\" becoming casualties. Japanese casualties, as revealed by secret Army General Staff statistics, were 1,439 casualties (526 killed or missing, 913 wounded); the Soviets claimed Japanese losses of 3,100, with 600 killed and 2,500 wounded.Alvin Coox, Nomonhan (Stanford University Press, 2003), p. 136 The Soviets concluded that this was because of poor communications infrastructure and roads as well as the loss of unit conference due to poor organization, headquarters and commanders and a lack of combat supply units. The faults in the Soviet army and leadership at Khasan were blamed on the incompetence of Marshal Blyukher. Vasily Blyukher, apart from leading the troops into action at Khasan, was also supposed to oversee the trans-Baikal military district's and the far eastern fronts move to combat readiness using an administrative apparatus that delivered army group, army and corps level instructions to the 40th rifle division by accident. On 22 October, he was arrested by the NKVD and is thought to have been tortured to death.Great Russian Encyclopedia (2005), Moscow: Bol'shaya Rossiyskaya enciklopediya Publisher, vol. 3, p. 618. The Japanese military, while seriously analyzing the results of the battle, engaged with the Soviets once more, with disastrous results, in the more extensive Battle of Khalkhin Gol (Nomonhan) in the Soviet-Japanese border conflict of 1939. This second engagement resulted in the defeat of the Japanese Sixth Army. After World War II, at the International Military Tribunal for the Far East in 1946, thirteen high-ranking Japanese officials were charged with crimes against peace for their roles in initiating hostilities at Lake Khasan.

Ogyen Trinley Dorje has been recognized and enthroned as the 17th Gyalwang Karmapa. The Karmapa is head of the Karma Kagyu school, the primary sub-school of the Kagyu school, one of the four main schools of Tibetan Buddhism. Ogyen Trinley Dorje left China in 1999, relocated to India in 2000, and is currently traveling and residing in the United States.  Biography =Birth Known as Apo Gaga, Ogyen Trinley Rinpoche was born in 1985 in Lhatok Township, Chamdo County, Tibet Autonomous Region, China, to nomadic parents. Prediction letter and recognition In March 1992, a prediction letter in verse written by the 16th Karmapa was located in an amulet given to Tai Situ Rinpoche. It said, \\"In the east of the land of snow Is a country where divine thunder spontaneously blazes. In a beautiful nomad's place with the sign of a cow, The method is Dondrup and the wisdom is Lolaga. Born in the year of the one used for the earth.\\" Afterwards, the 3rd Jamgon Kongtrul Rinpoche was put in charge of the search committee that included Tai Situ Rinpoche, Gyaltsap Rinpoche, and Kunzig Shamar Rinpoche. On 26 April 1992, Jamgon Kongtrul Rinpoche died in a car crash in India. Shamar Rinpoche left for the United States, and Tai Situpa then led the search committee. A group of monks from Tsurphu Monastery was dispatched to eastern Tibet to search for a nomad child born in the year of the ox, whose parents were named Lolaga and Dondrup.Enlightened Heart, \\"Tibet's Kagyu Buddhists face a leadership battle\\", 24 March 1999, https://www.karmapa.org.nz/news/15/64/Tibet-s-Kagyu-Buddhists- face-a-leadership-battle/ On 07 June 1992, Ogyen Trinley Dorje was seven years old when his recognition was confirmed, after the monks found him and the 14th Dalai Lama was shown the prediction letter by Tai Situpa and Gyaltsap Rinpoche. On 17 June 1992, Shamar Rinpoche sent a letter from Sikkim in agreement with the Dalai Lama's recognition of Ogyen Trinley Rinpoche. Shamar Rinpoche also withdrew requests for examinations of the prophetic letter on 17 June and again on 18 July.The Karmapa, Kagyu Office, [1992 Shamar Rinpoche Letters], https://kagyuoffice.org/confirmation-by-the-dalai-lama/sharmar- rinpoche-letter/ The 14th Dalai Lama issued an official statement of recognition and confirmation of the 16th Karmapa's reincarnation as Ogyen Trinley Dorje, on 30 June 1992. Ogyen Trinley Dorje was enthroned as the 17th Karmapa on 27 September 1992 at Tsurphu Monastery (), the traditional seat of the Karmapa in Tibet. He received the official sanction of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, who declared him to be a \\"living Buddha\\", the first time People's Republic of China has officially confirmed a tulku. A year later, the Chinese announced during the UN World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna they would train him in Tsurphu for his future task as the successor of the Dalai Lama.\\"Die Presse\\", 17 June 1993, page 2: \\"Am Rande der Konferenz\\". Escape from Tibet In 1999, at the age of 14, the Karmapa escaped Chinese-controlled Tibet during the winter, traveling to India through Nepal, arriving at the Tibetan exile quarters at McLeod Ganj on 5 January 2000. Ogyen Trinley Dorje stated he was unable to obtain in China the specialized instruction he needed to complete his studies and to realize his full spiritual authority. He has reside at Gyuto Monastery in Sidhbari, near Dharamshala up to 2017.https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/dharamsala- monastery-of-karmapa-closed-due-to-coronavirus-threat-53079 First trip to the US From May 15-June 2, 2008, the Karmapa made his first trip to the US, visiting New York City, Boulder, Colorado, and Seattle and was formally enthroned in the North American seat of the Gyalwang Karmapa at Karma Triyana Dharmachakra monastery in Woodstock, New York. He gave multiple teachings on compassion and the environment, gave the reading transmission for a new form of ng√∂ndro, and bestowed several empowerments, including those of Avalokite≈õvara and Padmasambhava. He also spoke about the special challenges of the rapid pace of modern society, and the virtues of the Internet as a tool for the study and practice of Buddhism. India denying permission to visit monasteries In July 2008, he requested permission to visit monasteries in Lahaul and Spiti district in Himachal Pradesh and in Ladakh in Jammu and Kashmir. The Government of India initially refused to allow these visits without giving a reason. It was speculated it was because these areas are close to the border with China and that the 2008 Summer Olympics was approaching even though the Karmapa had made it clear that he does not promote Tibetan independence and has no political stance on China.Tibetan spiritual leader not allowed to go near China border India eventually allowed his tour, which began in Ladakh, followed by Lahaul and Spiti, including the Tabo Monastery. Ogyen Trinley Dorje at age 14 Revisiting United States and visiting Europe Requests to revisit the United States and to visit Europe in 2010 were denied by the Indian government. On 9 July 2011, Ogyen Trinley Dorje returned to the United States for his second visit. From 9 to 17 July, he participated in the Kalachakra initiation bestowed by the 14th Dalai Lama in Washington, D.C., then traveled by train to his seat at Karma Triyana Dharmachakra and also visited his centers in both New Jersey and at Hunter College in New York City, returning to India on 4 August. During his visit, he taught extensively on compassion, gave Refuge, and bestowed the empowerments of both the Four-Armed and Thousand-Armed forms of Avalokite≈õvara. He also granted an interview with Laurie Goodstein of The New York Times, which was published on 28 July 2011. Residing in US and becoming citizen of a Caribbean nation , Ogyen Trinley Dorje was residing in the United States https://www.buddhistdoor.net/news/karmapa-extends-stay-in-us-health-concerns- cited and had been outside of India continuously since May 2017. In 2018, to facilitate travel abroad, he became a citizen of the Caribbean nation Dominica https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/karmapa-now-a-dominican- citizen/695631.html] through a provision widely used which allows citizenship through investment.[https://www.imidaily.com/caribbean/likely-successor-to- dalai-lama-gets-dominica-citizenship-by-investment/  Reconciliation = 2018 On 10 and 11 Oct 2018, in rural France, Ogyen Trinley Dorje (OTD) and Trinley Thaye Dorje (TTD) met each other in person for the first time. Trinley Thaye Dorje had been recognized and enthroned in 1994 as the Karmapa in a separate ceremony, by Shamar Rinpoche, two years after Ogyen Trinley Dorje was enthroned as the Karmapa. A joint statement by OTD and TTD was released on 11 October 2018, via their respective websites, and was circulated using social media outlets. The event was reported by numerous Buddhist and secular media sources. The event prompted several reactions, including statements of support from Gyalwang Drukpa, Goshir Gyaltsap Rinpoche, Jamgon Kongtrul Rinpoche, Beru Khyentse Rinpoche, and Zurmang Gharwang Rinpoche. On 28 October 2018, during a webcasted video address, Ogyen Trinley Dorje gave a further explanation about his recent meetings with Trinley Thaye Dorje in France and his reason and motivation for doing so.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_E4X0sh2mQ&t;=1846 OTD expressed how the Karma Kamtsang forefathers and disciples maintained and propagated the teachings through study, teaching, and practice; thus, generations of disciples were ripened through their wisdom, love, and power. Furthermore, OTD emphasized that whether reconciliation goes well or not does not depend upon only the two claimants, OTD and TTD. It depends on all the followers and the whole community of the Karma Kamtsang.  2019  On 27 October 2019, Ogyen Trinley Dorje and Trinley Thaye Dorje released a co- authored long-life prayer for Kunzig Shamar Rinpoche‚Äôs reincarnation. This composition was published on OTD's and TTD's respective websites, and circulated via various websites and social media outlets. The unprecedented joint composition was widely circulated, and garnered the support of various Kagyu teachers and communities, including Drikung Kyabgon, Rumtek Monastery, and Karma Drubdey Nunnery.  2020 In February 2020, the Karmapa Ogyen Trinley Dorje issued a statement at the 37th Kagyu Monlam in Bodh Gaya on the joint effort to search for and recognize the reincarnation of Shamar Rinpoche: \\"It is extremely important that Shamar Rinpoche‚Äôs reincarnation be recognized without any mistake or confusion, without any 'our side' or 'their side'. Having a unanimous recognition is absolutely crucial for Buddhism in general and our lineage in particular, and with this in mind, Gyalwa Thaye Dorje and I intend to cooperate in the search and recognition\\". The Karmapa added, \\"I see the reincarnation of Shamar Rinpoche as a crucial point for bringing unity to the Kamtsang, and am putting effort into it. If the reincarnation of Shamar Rinpoche is disputed, in the future, all the Kamtsang high lamas will be disputed and the Kamtsang will be completely split\\", and \\"The attachment and hatred will be the same as in a feud that lasts for generations. If we fall under its power, all the majesty and power of over nine hundred years of history will be destroyed.\\"Tenzin Dharpo, Phayul Newsdesk, 10 February 2020, \\"Two claimants to Karmapa title to jointly search for reincarnation of Shamar Rinpoche\\", http://www.phayul.com/2020/02/10/42570/  Dharma digitization  The Gyalwang Karmapa has undertaken the important and long-term task of digitizing Buddhist texts so that as many scriptures, commentaries, etc. are available in digital format as possible for future generations, students, scholars and monasteries around the world. There are four main websites ‚Äì https://dharma-treasure.org Dharma Treasure, https://adarsha.dharma- treasure.org Adarsha, https://digital-toolbox.dharma-treasure.org Ketaka, and http://dharmaebooks.org Dharma Ebooks ‚Äì each one dealing with a different format, tool, or translation. Adarsha, for example, makes the Kangyur, Tengyur, and Tibetan masterpieces available in digital format and has been catalogued under the guidance of the Gyalwang Karmapa. Tibetan culture, unity, language and literacy  For many years Gyalwang Karmapa has emphasized the importance of preserving Tibetan culture, unity, language, and literacy; underlining the importance of sustaining written and spoken the Tibetan language, because it is the very root of the Dharma in Tibet and its culture. Tibetan language is the lifeline that links Tibetans to their culture, arts, and spirituality. Tibetan culture, he states, is the mind and life force of the Tibetan people. Stressing the importance of Tibetan harmony and unity, Gyalwang Karmapa has implored all Tibetans to exercise religious tolerance, stating that all Buddhist traditions in Tibet come from one source, the Buddha, so the differences between them are not great. He has warned that it is a huge mistake to inflate small distinctions into a basis for attachment and hatred, asserting one‚Äôs own tradition to be better than another‚Äôs. He has said that the reason for any future decline of the Buddha‚Äôs Dharma would not come from outside, but from within, from disputes between the holders of his teachings. Therefore, Gyalwang Karmapa has reiterated time and time again that the differences between lineages and factions are minor in terms of view, meditation, and conduct, and has urged everyone to keep a broader non-partisan perspective in mind.  108 Translations  108 Translations was initiated in 2015 by H.H. Karmapa Orgyen Trinley Dorje. Born of a concept developed during a translators‚Äô workshop held at Latse and presided over by Gyalwang Karmapa, the aim of the 108 Translations project is to produce a needed body of reading material that can promote the reinvigoration of Tibetan language. Rather than focussing on translating a few famous works that match the interests of a small group of well-educated readers (which has been the case for translations into Tibetan up to the present), 108 Translations aims to provide a plethora of good and easily accessible reading materials for average Tibetan readers. In his Statement of Purpose, Gyalwang Karmapa expressed that we are currently inhabiting a time where there is great concern that the Tibetan language will go extinct. He has said that we have come to the point where we need to take responsibility for the survival of the Tibetan language, and we are in a situation where there is very little reading material that matches the interests of the ordinary Tibetan reader. The main criteria for the 108 Translations is that they don't lose the meaning and feeling (or \\"flavour\\") of the original, the translations must be easy to understand and pronounce in Tibetan, and the selected works need to meet the interests of the readership. For example, translations of famous literary works that have low readership are examples of unsuccessful translations. 108 Translations must not only consider how well known the works are, they must also examine how they have sold, how many other languages they have been translated into, and so forth. Works with low sales are not selected, even if they are renowned. Over time, the hope is that future translations will grow ever closer to the interests of the readership. 108 Translations aims to nurture literacy in the Tibetan language, while giving Tibetan readers greater access to world literature. It is a project of Latse and is managed by the 108 Translations Management Team, whose combined skills and experience ensure the highest quality of translation. This project is also generously supported by Dharma Treasure and the ebooks will be published on dharmaebooks.org as well latse.org/program/108-translations.  Supporting the female Buddhist community  The Karmapa has taken a deep interest in the welfare of the female Buddhist community, as well as being a voice that regularly encourages equal rights and opportunities for women practitioners. He has, in particular, taken the responsibility to restore full ordination for Tibetan nuns. Each year the Karmapa hosts the dharma winter gathering where nuns receive special teachings, instructions and gather to debate Buddhist philosophy so as to further increase their opportunities for a traditional education.Arya Kshema  2013 On 14 September 2013, at the International Buddhist Confederation in New Delhi, Gyalwang Karmapa participated in a discussions with the Full Nun‚Äôs Ordination Working Group, joining Co-Chairs Jetsunma Tenzin Palmo, Abbess of Dongyu Gatsal Ling Nunnery in India, and Ven. Dhammananda, Abbess of Wat Songkhammakalayani Temple in Thailand.  2015 On 24 January 2015, during the Second Arya Kshema Winter Dharma Gathering the Gyalwang Karmapa made the historical announcement that beginning next year [which was later changed to 2017 for astrological reasons], he would take concrete stepsGyalwang Karmapa explained that: \\"over the last ten or twenty years, led by His Holiness the Dalai Lama, many of the masters of Tibetan Buddhism, including many high lamas, geshes, and khenpos, have engaged in discussions with good intentions. There have been many discussions, and people have put great effort into this‚ÄîI have seen and experienced this for myself. We‚Äôve had a lot of talk and research into the words of the Buddha, the treatises by Indian masters, as well as the Tibetan scriptures. It sometimes seems that over the past twenty years we‚Äôve only had talk and research, but we haven‚Äôt actually put anything into practice. It‚Äôs been like this for a long time.\\" towards restoring nuns‚Äô vows in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition.  2016  22 January 2016, during the eighth day of teaching at the Arya Kshema Winter Dharma Gathering, the Gyalwang Karmapa discussed questions related to giving bhikshuni ordination to nuns.  2017 In a video address, Gyalwang Karmapa gave a brief summary of the history of buddhist nuns' ordination and in particular in the Tibetan buddhist tradition. The talk was part of the 4th annual Arya Kshema which took place in Bodhgaya, India.video address 10 March 2017, at the Mahabodhi Stupa, Bodhgaya, Bihar, India, eighteen women took the shramaneri vows. One additional woman would take the vows several days later on the auspicious fifteenth day of the Month of Miracles.  Buddhist vegetarianism  \\"Gyalwa Karmapa\\" (Ogyen Trinley Dorje), by painter Claude-Max Lochu, exhibition for the project of Temple for Peace in France, 2008 On January 3, 2007, Ogyen Trinley Dorje mandated a purely vegetarian diet in all his monasteries and centers and strongly urged vegetarianism among all his students, saying that generally, in his view, it was very important in the Mahayana not to eat meat and that, even in Vajrayana, it is preferable for students and practitioners not to eat meat.Talk on Vegetarianism, by Orgyen Trinle Dorje, Karmapa XVII, As Translated Simultaneously by Ringu Tulku Rinpoche 3 January 2007, Full Moon Day, During the 24th annual Great Kagyu Monlam, Bodhgaya, India  Buddhist environmentalism  Commenting on the Buddhist tradition of life release, where animals destined for slaughter are bought, blessed and natively released, Orgyen Trinley Dorje said the meaning of this concept was broad and that practitioners should use their intelligence to expand the tradition. Similarly, when addressing the 2007 Kagyu Monlam Chenmo, he indicated that planting a single tree can be more beneficial than performing life release for many beings; recommending that monasteries should plant one to two thousand trees. In addition he urged monks to practise restraint when sponsors offer technology upgrades.kagyumonlam.org: Kagyu Monlam Chenmo -- Teachings -- More Words on the Environment (2007/12/27) On Earth Day, on 22 April 2009, Orgyen Trinley Dorje gave 108 instructions on protecting the environment. At the second conference on environmental protection (3 to 8 October 2009, Gyuto Monastery), he stated \\"For too long, people have behaved thoughtlessly and ignored the damage to the environment that they are creating and, if this continued there was a great danger that it would be too late to do anything.\\" On 24 October 2009, Ogyen Trinley Dorje supported international climate action day at a gathering at McLeod Ganj in northern India. In recent years, Khoryug, a network of Tibetan Buddhist monasteries and centers that work on environmental protection in the Eastern Himalayas, was developed under the auspices of Ogyen Trinley Dorje as part of the World Wildlife Fund's Sacred Earth: Faiths for Conservation program. In his April 2015 interview with Yale Environment 360, he said, \\"The environmental emergency that we face is not just a scientific issue, nor is it just a political issue, it is also a moral issue. And therefore all of us approaching this issue have to pick up our share of the responsibility to find and implement solutions. The scientific aspect of it, of course, is the supply of information ‚Äî the creation of models and predictions and the introduction of techniques that we can use to remedy this. But our share of this responsibility is to take what scientists teach us to heart, so we actually transform our way of life into one that is sustainable.‚Äù\\"For Buddhist Leader, Religion And the Environment Are One\\" Interview with H.H. The Karmapa by Roger Rohn, Yale Environment 360, 16 April 2015.  Controversy  Mipham Chokyi Lodro, 14th Shamarpa (the second-longest recognized tulku lineage in the Karma Kagyu tradition, and who in previous incarnations is said to have held and transmitted the Kagyu lineage between Karmapas, did not recognize Ogyen Trinley Dorje and instead proclaimed Trinley Thaye Dorje (), whom he purportedly identified a few years earlier than the recognition of Orgyen Thrinley Dorje in a dream as the true Karmapa. Shamarpa's camp argue until the reincarnation line of the Shamarpas was forbidden by the government of the Dalai Lama,see: Shamarpa#Controversy the successive Shamarpas were the persons in charge to recognize the Karmapas, whereas the Dalai Lamas played no role in the recognition.Prof. Geoffrey Brian Samuel in: ‚ÄúAffirmation of Geoffrey Brian Samuel,‚Äù Lama vs. Hope and Ors, CIV-2004404-001363, High Court of New Zealand Auckland Registry, 11 November 2004. Many of the previous Karmapas have left a letter stating the details of their rebirth to assist in the recognition of their future incarnation, and thus the Shamarpa's recognition through a dream has come under scrutiny. Shamarpa questioned the authenticity of the \\"prophecy letter\\" which the 16th Karmapa allegedly had written, and asked Situ Rinpoche for a forensic test of the letter, which Situ Rinpoche refused. Ogyen Trinley Dorje is supported by the majority of the Kagyu hierarchy, including two lamas who have played a role in finding previous Karmapas: Tai Situpa and Goshir Gyaltsab. A fourth such lama, the 3rd Jamgon Kongtrul, died early on during the controversy. Ogyen Trinley Dorje was enthroned at Tsurphu Monastery. Other high Kagyu lamas who support Ogyen Trinley Dorje include the 9th Thrangu Rinpoche; the 7th Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche and his Nalandabodhi organization; the 12th Surmang Choseng Trungpa; the 7th Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche; the 3rd Tenga Rinpoche; Khenpo Karthar Rinpoche (abbot of Karma Triyana Dharmachakra); Sakyong Mipham and his organization, Shambhala Buddhism; Drupon Rinpoche and Lama Norlha Rinpoche. He is also recognized as Karmapa by both the current 14th Dalai Lama and the government of China.  2011 police raid  In January 2011, the Himachal Pradesh Police seized money in currencies of 25 countries including China, valued at over 60 million, during raids on the offices of a trust backed by Ogyen Trinley Dorje. They also seized several traveler's cheques and land deal documents, suspecting a hawala scam. Initially, the police suspected the money was being used to spread Chinese influence in India, and that the Karmapa was a Chinese agent helping the Chinese government control Buddhist monasteries in India. They said even if the Karmapa was able to explain the source of the money recovered, he might be held liable for violating the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act. The Karmapa denied all the allegations and said the seized money came via the donations from his followers. A New York Times report on the matter noted an unnamed rival Karmapa candidate has \\"close ties to Indian intelligence officials\\". On 11 February 2011, it was reported the central Indian government had cleared the Karmapa of all charges, finding the money in question had been donated by followers.\\"India: Tibetan Lama Cleared in Cash Inquiry, Report Says.\\" The New York Times, 11 February 2011.

As a teenager, Eberhardt, educated in Switzerland by her father, published short stories under a male pseudonym. She became interested in North Africa, and was considered a proficient writer on the subject despite learning about the region only through correspondence. After an invitation from photographer Louis David, Eberhardt moved to Algeria in May 1897. She dressed as a man and converted to Islam, eventually adopting the name Si Mahmoud Saadi. Eberhardt's unorthodox behaviour made her an outcast among European settlers in Algeria and the French administration. Eberhardt's acceptance by the Qadiriyya, an Islamic order, convinced the French administration that she was a spy or an agitator. She survived an assassination attempt shortly thereafter. In 1901, the French administration ordered her to leave Algeria, but she was allowed to return the following year after marrying her partner, the Algerian soldier Slimane Ehnni. Following her return, Eberhardt wrote for a newspaper published by Victor Barrucand and worked for General Hubert Lyautey. In 1904, at the age of 27, she was killed by a flash flood in A√Øn S√©fra. In 1906, Barrucand began publishing her remaining manuscripts, which received critical acclaim. She was seen posthumously as an advocate of decolonisation, and streets were named after her in B√©char and Algiers. Eberhardt's life has been the subject of several works, including the 1991 film Isabelle Eberhardt and the 2012 opera Song from the Uproar: The Lives and Deaths of Isabelle Eberhardt. Early life and family background Eberhardt was born in Geneva, Switzerland, to Alexandre Trophimowsky and Nathalie Moerder (n√©e Eberhardt). Trophimowsky was an anarchist, tutor, and former Orthodox priest-turned-atheist, and Nathalie was the illegitimate daughter of a middle-class Lutheran German and a Russian Jew. Nathalie was considered to be part of the Russian aristocracy, meaning her illegitimacy was probably kept secret. She married widower Pavel deMoerder, a Russian general forty years her senior, who hired Trophimowsky to tutor their children Nicolas, Nathalie, and Vladimir. Around 1871 Nathalie took the children and left her husband for Trophimowsky, who had abandoned his own wife and family. They left Russia, staying in Turkey and then Italy before settling in Geneva. Around 1872 Nathalie gave birth to Augustin; deMoerder, who came to Switzerland in a failed attempt to reconcile with Nathalie, accepted the son as his own and allowed him to have his surname, but the boy's older siblings believed that Trophimowsky was the father. General deMoerder died several months later, and despite their separation had arranged for his estate to pay Nathalie a considerable regular income. The family remained in Switzerland. Four years later Eberhardt was born, and was registered as Nathalie's illegitimate daughter. Biographer Fran√ßoise d'Eaubonne speculated that Eberhardt's biological father was the poet Arthur Rimbaud, who had been in Switzerland at the time. Other historians consider this unlikely and find it more likely that Trophimowsky was the father, noting that Nathalie and Trophimowsky were rarely apart, that Eberhardt's birth did not impact negatively on their partnership, and that Eberhardt was Trophimowsky's favourite child. Biographer Cecily Mackworth speculated that Eberhardt's illegitimacy was due to Trophimowsky's nihilist beliefs, which rejected traditional concepts of family. Eberhardt was well educated; along with the other children in the family, she was home-schooled by Trophimowsky. She was fluent in French, spoke Russian, German and Italian, and was taught Latin, Greek, and classical Arabic. She studied philosophy, metaphysics, chemistry, history, and geography, though she was most passionate about literature, reading the works of authors including Pierre Loti, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Leo Tolstoy, Voltaire and √âmile Zola while she was a teenager, and was also an admirer of the poets Semyon Nadson and Charles Baudelaire. At an early age she began wearing male clothing, enjoying its freedom, and her nonconformist father did not discourage her. The children of deMoerder resented their stepfather, who forbade them from obtaining professions or leaving the home, and effectively used them as slaves to tend to his extensive gardens. Eberhardt's sister Nathalie married against Trophimowsky's wishes in 1888, and was subsequently cut off from the rest of the household. Nathalie's departure had a profound effect on Eberhardt's childhood, as she had been responsible for most of the home duties; the household subsequently suffered from a lack of hygiene and regular meals. Move to North Africa Sometime prior to 1894 Eberhardt began corresponding with Eug√®ne Letord, a French officer stationed in the Sahara who had placed a newspaper advertisement for a pen pal. Eberhardt asked him for every detail he could give her about life in the Sahara, also informing him of her dreams of escaping Geneva alongside her favourite sibling, Augustin. Letord encouraged the two of them to relocate to B√¥ne, Algeria, where he could assist them in establishing a new life. In a series of circumstances that remain unclear though involving financial debts and ties to Russian revolutionist groups with which he was affiliated, Augustin fled Geneva in 1894. Eberhardt probably assisted him initially but was unable to keep track of his whereabouts despite making constant inquiries. In November 1894 Eberhardt was informed by a letter that Augustin had joined the French Foreign Legion and was assigned to Algeria. While at first furious with Augustin's decision, Eberhardt's anger did not last; she asked him to send her a detailed diary of what he saw in North Africa. alt=A black and white photograph of a young woman, wearing an assortment of Arabic styled clothing In 1895, Eberhardt published short stories in the journal La Nouvelle Revue Moderne under the pseudonym of Nicolas Podolinsky; \\"Infernalia\\" (her first published work) is about a medical student's physical attraction to a dead woman. Later that year she published (), a story about North African religious life. Eberhardt had \\"remarkable insight and knowledge\\" of North Africa for someone acquainted with the region only through correspondence, and her writing had a strong anti-colonial theme. Louis David, an Algerian-French photographer touring Switzerland who was intrigued by her work, met with her. After hearing of her desire to move to Algiers, he offered to help her establish herself in B√¥ne if she relocated there. In 1895, he took a photograph of Eberhardt wearing a sailor's uniform, which would become widely associated with her in later years. Eberhardt relocated to B√¥ne with her mother in May 1897. They initially lived with David and his wife, who both disapproved of the amount of time Eberhardt and her mother spent with Arabs. Eberhardt and her mother did not like the Davids' attitude, which was typical of European settlers in the area, and later avoided the country's French residents, renting an Arabic-style house far from the European quarter. Eberhardt, aware that a Muslim woman could go out neither alone nor unveiled, dressed as a man in a burnous and turban. She expanded on her previous studies of Arabic, and became fluent within a few months. She and her mother converted to Islam. Mackworth writes that while Eberhardt was a \\"natural mystic\\", her conversion appeared to be largely for practical reasons, as it gave her greater acceptance among the Arabs. Eberhardt found it easy to accept Islam; Trophimowsky had brought her up as a fatalist and Islam gave her fatalism a meaning. She embraced the Islamic concept that everything is predestined and the will of God. Although Eberhardt largely devoted herself to the Muslim way of life, she frequently partook of marijuana and alcohol and had many lovers. According to a friend, Eberhardt \\"drank more than a Legionnaire, smoked more kief than a hashish addict and made love for the love of making love\\". She was heterosexual, but often treated sexual intercourse as impersonal. The reason for her Arabic companions' tolerance of her lifestyle has been debated by biographers. According to Mackworth, the \\"delicate courtesy of the Arabs\\" led them to treat Eberhardt as a man because she wished to live as one. Eberhardt's behaviour made her an outcast with the French settlers and the colonial administration, who watched her closely. Seeing no reason as to why a woman would choose the company of impoverished Arabs over her fellow Europeans, they eventually concluded she must be an English agent, sent to stir up resentment towards the French. Eberhardt began to write stories, including the first draft of her novel Trimardeur (). Her story Yasmina, about a young Bedouin woman who falls in love with a French officer and the \\"tragedy this impossible love brings into her life\\", was published in a local French newspaper. Her mother, who had been suffering from heart problems, died in November 1897 of a heart attack, and was buried under the name of Fatma Mannoubia. Eberhardt was grief-stricken. Trophimowsky, who had been summoned when his partner's health had deteriorated but arrived after her death, showed no sympathy towards Eberhardt. When she told him she desperately wanted to die and rejoin her mother, he responded by calmly offering her his revolver, which she declined. Travels to Europe Eberhardt spent her money recklessly in Algiers, and quickly exhausted the funds left to her by her mother; she would often spend several days at a time in kief dens. Augustin, ejected from the Foreign Legion due to his health, returned to Geneva alongside Eberhardt in early 1899. They found Trophimowsky in poor health, suffering from throat cancer and traumatised by the loss of Eberhardt's mother and Vladimir, who had committed suicide the previous year. Eberhardt nursed her father, growing closer to him. She also commenced a relationship and became engaged to Riza Bey, an Armenian diplomat with whom she had been friends and possibly lovers when she was seventeen. Though Trophimowsky approved of the engagement, the relationship soon ended. Historian Lesley Blanch attributes the relationship's downfall to Bey being assigned to Stockholm. Trophimowsky died in May. Blanch attributes the death to a chloral overdose, with which Eberhardt may have intentionally euthanised him. Eberhardt intended to sell the villa, although Trophimowsky's legitimate wife opposed the execution of the will. After several weeks of legal contentions, Eberhardt mortgaged the property and returned to Africa on the first available ship. With both parents dead, she considered herself free of human attachments and able to live as a vagabond. Eberhardt relinquished her mother's name, and called herself Si Mahmoud Saadi. She began wearing male clothing exclusively and developed a masculine personality, speaking and writing as a man. Eberhardt behaved like an Arab man, challenging gender and racial norms. Asked why she dressed as an Arab man, she invariably replied: \\"It is impossible for me to do otherwise.\\" A few months later, Eberhardt's money ran low, and she returned to Geneva to sell the villa; due to the legal troubles there was little to no money available. Encouraged by a friend, she went to Paris to become a writer but had little success. While in Paris Eberhardt met the widow of Marquis de Mor√®s. Although deMor√®s had been reportedly murdered by Tuareg tribesmen in the Sahara, no one had been arrested. When his widow learned that Eberhardt was familiar with the area where deMor√®s died, she hired her to investigate his murder. The job benefited Eberhardt, who was destitute and longed to return to the Sahara. She returned to Algeria in July 1900, settling in El Oued. According to Sahara expert R. V. C. Bodley, Eberhardt made little effort to investigate deMor√®s' death; Bodley considered this due to a combination of the unwillingness of the French to co-operate in an investigation and Eberhardt's fatalism rather than deliberate dishonesty. Word eventually got back to the deMor√®s widow about Eberhardt's lackluster investigation, and she subsequently cut off her funding. Eberhardt made friends in the area and met an Algerian soldier, Slimane Ehnni. They fell in love, and eventually lived together openly. This alienated Eberhardt from the French authorities, who were already outraged by her lifestyle. During her travels she made contact with the Qadiriyya, a Sufi order. The order was led by Hussein benBrahim, who was so impressed with Eberhardt's knowledge of (and passion for) Islam that he initiated her into his zawiya without the usual formal examination. This convinced the French authorities that she was a spy or an agitator, and they placed her on a widely circulated blacklist. The French transferred Ehnni to the spahi regiment at Batna, possibly to punish Eberhardt (whom they could not harm directly). Too poor to accompany him to Batna, Eberhardt traveled to a Qadiriyya meeting in Behima in late January 1901 where she hoped to ask SiLachmi, a marabout, for financial assistance. While waiting for the meeting to begin she was attacked by a man with a sabre, receiving a superficial wound to her head and a deep cut to her left arm. Her attacker, Abdallah ben Mohammed, was overpowered by others and arrested. When asked why he had tried to kill Eberhardt he only repeated \\"God wished it; God still wishes it.\\" Eberhardt suspected that he was an assassin hired by the French authorities. Others attribute the attack to SiLachmi; Eberhardt was his mistress, whom he had grown tired of, and it is speculated he was simultaneously trying to get rid of her and pin the blame for the attack on a rival tribe. She was brought to the military hospital at ElOued the following day. After Eberhardt recovered in late February, she joined Ehnni with funds from members of the Qadiriyya who regarded her survival as a miracle. After spending two months in Batna with Ehnni, the French ordered her to leave North Africa without explanation; as an immigrant, she had no choice but to comply. Ehnni requested permission from his military superiors to marry Eberhardt (which would have enabled her to stay), but his request was denied. She traveled to France in early May 1901, staying with Augustin and his wife and daughter in Marseille. In mid-June she was summoned back to Constantine to give evidence at the trial of her attacker, who maintained his statement that God had ordered him to kill Eberhardt, though expressed remorse towards her. Eberhardt said that she bore no grudge against Abdallah, forgave him, and hoped that he would not be punished. Abdallah received life imprisonment although the prosecutor had asked for the death penalty. When the trial ended, Eberhardt was again ordered to leave the country. She returned to live with Augustin, working with him (disguised as a man) as a dock labourer. Eberhardt and Augustin's family lived in appalling poverty. Eberhardt's health deteriorated, and she repeatedly suffered from fevers. She attempted suicide while in Marseille, one of several attempts she would make over the course of her life. Eberhardt continued to write during this time, working on several projects including her novel Trimardeur. A friend of Eberhardt's gave her a letter of introduction to playwright Eug√®ne Brieux, who opposed French rule in North Africa and supported Arab emancipation. He sent her a several-hundred-franc advance and tried to have her stories published, but could not find anyone willing to publish pro-Arab writing. Eberhardt, unfazed, continued writing; her morale lifted when Ehnni was transferred to a spahi regiment near Marseille in late August to complete his final months of service. He did not require permission from his military superiors to marry in France, and he and Eberhardt were married in October 1901. Shortly before the wedding, Eberhardt and Augustin received the news that Trophimowsky's estate had finally been sold, though due to the mounting legal costs there was no money left for them to inherit. With this news, Eberhardt abandoned any hope of having a financially secure future. In February 1902 Ehnni was discharged, and the couple returned to B√¥ne to live with his family. Later life and death After a short time living with Ehnni's family, the couple relocated to Algiers. Eberhardt became disappointed with Ehnni, whose only ambition after leaving the army appeared to be finding an unskilled job that would allow him to live relatively comfortably. She increased her own efforts as a writer, and several of her short stories were printed in the local press. She accepted a job offer from Al-Akhbar () newspaper publisher Victor Barrucand in March 1902. Eberhardt became a regular contributor to the newspaper; Trimardeur began appearing as a serial in August 1903. Barrucand and Eberhardt formed a friendship, though Barrucand was frequently frustrated with his new employee's work ethic. Eberhardt's articles arrived irregularly, as she would only write when she felt like doing so. Her job paid poorly, but had many benefits. Through Barrucand's contacts, Eberhardt was able to access the famous zawiya of Lalla Zaynab. Eberhardt spoke highly of her time with Zaynab, though never disclosed what the two discussed; their meeting caused concern among the French authorities. Eberhardt and Ehnni relocated to T√©n√®s in July 1902 after Ehnni obtained employment there as a translator. Eberhardt was incorrigibly bad with her money, spending anything she received immediately on tobacco, books, and gifts for friends, and pawning her meagre possessions or asking for loans when she realised there was no money left for food. This behaviour made her even more of a pariah among the other European residents of the town. Eberhardt would frequently leave for weeks at a time, being either summoned to Algiers by Barrucand or sent on assignments. She was given a regular column in his newspaper, where she wrote about the life and customs of Bedouin tribes. Both Ehnni and Eberhardt's health deteriorated, with Eberhardt regularly suffering from bouts of malaria. She was also probably affected by syphilis. Barrucand dispatched Eberhardt to report on the aftereffects of the 2September 1903 Battle of El-Moungar. She stayed with French Foreign Legion soldiers and met Hubert Lyautey, the French general in charge of Oran, at their headquarters. Eberhardt and Lyautey became friends and, due to her knowledge of Islam and Arabic, she became a liaison between him and the local Arab people. While Eberhardt never ceased protesting against any repressive actions undertaken by the French administration, she believed that Lyautey's approach, which focused on diplomacy rather than military force, would bring peace to the region. Although details are unclear, it is generally accepted that Eberhardt also engaged in espionage for Lyautey. Concerned about a powerful marabout in the Atlas Mountains, Lyautey sent her to meet with him in 1904. At the marabout's zawiya, Eberhardt was weakened by fever. She returned to A√Øn S√©fra, and was treated at the military hospital. She left the hospital against medical advice and asked Ehnni, from whom she had been separated for several months, to join her. Reunited on 20October 1904, they rented a small mud house. The following day, a flash flood struck the area. As soon as the waters subsided, Lyautey launched a search for her. Ehnni was discovered almost immediately, saying that Eberhardt had been swept away by the water. Based on this information, Lyautey and his men searched the surrounding area for several days before deciding to explore the ruins of the house where the couple had stayed. Her body was crushed under one of the house's supporting beams. The exact circumstances of her death were never discovered. While some biographers have raised suspicions regarding Ehnni, most believe it more likely that Eberhardt, who had always believed she would die young, instead accepted her fate. Mackworth speculated that after initially trying to run from the floodwaters, Eberhardt instead turned back to face them. Blanch argued that due to Eberhardt's history of suicidal tendencies, she probably would have still chosen to stay in the area even if she had known the flood was coming. Lyautey buried Eberhardt in A√Øn Sefra and had a marble tombstone, engraved with her adopted name in Arabic and her birth name in French, placed on her grave. Legacy At the time of her death, Eberhardt's possessions included several of her unpublished manuscripts. Lyautey instructed his soldiers to search for all of her papers in the aftermath of the flood, and posted those that could be found to Barrucand. After reconstructing them, substituting his own words where the originals were missing or too damaged to decipher, he began to publish her work. Some of what he published is considered to be more his work than Eberhardt's. Barrucand also received criticism for listing himself as the co-author of some of the publications, and for not clarifying which portions of text were his own. The first posthumous story, \\"Dans l'Ombre Chaude de l'Islam\\" (In the Warm Shadow of Islam) received critical acclaim when it was published in 1906. The book's success drew great attention to Eberhardt's writing and established her as among the best writers of literature inspired by Africa. A street was named after Eberhardt in B√©char and another in Algiers. The street in Algiers is in the outskirts; one writer at the time commented there was a sad symbolism in the fact the street \\"begins in an inhabited quarter and peters out into a wasteland\\". She was posthumously seen as an advocate of feminism and decolonisation; according to Hedi Abdel-Jaouad in Yale French Studies, her work may have begun the decolonisation of North Africa. Eberhardt's relationship with Lyautey has triggered discussion by modern historians about her complicity in colonialism. In 1954, author and explorer Cecily Mackworth published the biography The Destiny of Isabelle Eberhardt after following Eberhardt's routes in Algeria and the Sahara. The book inspired Paul Bowles to translate some of Eberhardt's writings into English. Novelist William Bayer published Visions of Isabelle, a fictionalised 1976 account of her life. In 1981, Timberlake Wertenbaker premiered New Anatomies, a play about Eberhardt. Eberhardt has been portrayed in two films. Leslie Thornton directed a 1988 biography, There Was An Unseen Cloud Moving, with seven amateur actresses playing Eberhardt. Ian Pringle directed Isabelle Eberhardt, starring Mathilda May, in 1991. In 1994, the soundtrack for Pringle's film was released by musician Paul Sch√ºtze, titled Isabelle Eberhardt: The Oblivion Seeker. In 1998, John Berger and Nella Bielski published Isabelle: A Story in Shots, a screenplay based on Eberhardt's life. Missy Mazzoli composed an opera, Song from the Uproar: The Lives and Deaths of Isabelle Eberhardt, in 2012.

History Founded by Joseph Deakin in 1891, the Echo has had four editors in its history. It is based in the town of Loughborough, Leicestershire, England, and circulates in the town and the surrounding area. There is also a special edition, the Shepshed Echo, serving the nearby town of Shepshed. Their combined circulation from 3 July 2006 to 31 December 2006 was 21,936. For the period 29 December 2008 to 28 June 2008 the circulation figures had fallen by 15% and according to the ABC (Audit Bureau of Circulations UK) stood at an average of 18,628. This in turn fell again to 17,595 for the period 5 July 2010 - 2 January 2011. The Loughborough Echo started life as a freesheet of four broadsheet pages and became a paid-for 18 years later, with a cover price of a halfpenny. In 1919, a man who was to play a major part in the Echo's success story, Charles Harriss, joined the paper as a reporter on being demobbed from the Army. In 1929, after the death of Joseph Deakin, he took over as editor, with Joseph's son, Arthur, as managing director. Over the years the circulation rose steadily. In 1977, Charles Harriss retired and John Rippin, who had joined the paper in 1955 as a trainee reporter, became the third editor. Within a few weeks, news replaced most of the adverts on the front page, and nearly seven years later the switch was made to tabloid. John Rippin retired in 2004 and was succeeded by Andy Rush, who remains in the editor's chair. Over the years the Echo has won a number of newspaper industry awards, and in 1997 was voted the best paid-for weekly in the whole of the Midlands and East Anglia.

They have flattened bodies as an adaptation for living in rock crevices. They are delicate, readily losing limbs when attacked, and use their large claws for maintaining territories. They first appeared in the Tithonian age of the Late Jurassic epoch, 145-152 million years ago. Description Porcelain crabs are small, usually with body widths less than . They share the general body plan of a squat lobster, but their bodies are more compact and flattened, an adaptation for living and hiding under rocks. Porcelain crabs are quite fragile animals, and often shed their limbs to escape predators, hence their name. The lost appendage can grow back over several moults. Porcelain crabs have large chelae (claws), which are used for territorial struggles, but not for catching food. The fifth pair of pereiopods is reduced and used for cleaning. Evolution Porcelain crabs are an example of carcinisation, whereby a noncrab-like animal (in this case a relative of a squat lobster) evolves into an animal that resembles a true crab. Porcelain crabs can be distinguished from true crabs by the apparent number of walking legs (three instead of four pairs; the fourth pair is reduced and held against the carapace), and the long antennae originating on the front outside of the eyestalks. The abdomen of the porcelain crab is long and folded underneath it, free to move. Biogeography and ecology Porcellana platycheles Neopetrolisthes maculatus Porcelain crabs live in all the world's oceans, except the Arctic Ocean and the Antarctic. They are common under rocks, and can often be found and observed on rocky beaches and shorelines, startled creatures scurrying away when a stone is lifted. They feed by combing plankton and other organic particles from the water using long setae (feathery hair- or bristle-like structures) on the mouthparts. Some of the common species of porcelain crabs in the Caribbean Sea are Petrolisthes quadratus, found in large numbers under rocks in the intertidal, and the red-and-white polka-dotted Porcellana sayana, which lives commensally within the shells inhabited by large hermit crabs. In Hong Kong, Petrolisthes japonicus is common.

After the death of his brother the Great Khan M√∂ngke, Ariq B√∂ke claimed the title of the Great Khan of the Mongol Empire and briefly took power while his brothers Kublai (more commonly known as Kublai Khan) and Hulagu (more commonly known as Hulagu Khan) were absent from the Mongolian homeland. When Kublai returned for an election in 1260, rival factions could not agree, and elected both claimants, Kublai and Ariq B√∂ke, to the throne, resulting in the Toluid Civil War that fragmented the Mongol Empire. Ariq B√∂ke was supported by the traditionalists of the Mongol Empire, while his brother Kublai was supported by the senior princes of North China and Manchuria. Early years Ariq B√∂ke was the youngest son of Sorghaghtani Beki and Tolui, the youngest son of Genghis Khan. When Genghis died in 1227, the leadership of the Empire passed to Genghis' third son (Ariq B√∂ke's uncle), √ñgedei.

After his eldest brother M√∂ngke was enthroned in 1250, his family became even more powerful among the Chingisids. His mother was Christian and Ariq B√∂ke was also known for being sympathetic towards Christianity; this is known from the account of Franciscan William of Rubruck, an envoy of Louis IX of France who wrote that he observed Ariq B√∂ke make the sign of cross and state that \\"We know that the Messiah [Jesus] is God\\".

When √ñgedei Khan died, a power struggle erupted, with leadership then passing to √ñgedei's son G√ºy√ºk in 1246, though G√ºy√ºk died only two years later, in 1248. After another struggle, the sons of Tolui, √ñgedei's brother, took power. The first of Tolui's sons to be Great Khan was M√∂ngke, who proceeded with Kublai to conquer Southern China and the Southern Song Dynasty. Their brother Hulagu led the Mongol advance westward, conquering Baghdad and proceeding into Syria and towards Palestine. During this time, all affairs of the Heartland were left under the control of their brother Ariq B√∂ke. Ariq B√∂ke in traditional Mongolian script. When M√∂ngke died in 1259, Ariq B√∂ke was elected Khan in the absence of his brothers, and had the support of most of the existing ministers and powerful families in the capital of Karakorum, such as M√∂ngke's family, and other princes of the Golden family along with other forces in the capital of Karakorum including Torguud royal bodyguards and White Horde elites, as well as the Oirats, who were allied with him as one of the Oirat leaders was married to his daughter. However, when Kublai and Hulagu received news of M√∂ngke's death, they aborted their own battles in order to return to the capital to decide the matter of succession. In May 1260, Kublai was elected khan by his own supporters, to rival the claim of Ariq B√∂ke. A civil war subsequently broke out between the brothers for the leadership of the Empire. For example, when the Chagatai Khanate needed a new leader, Kublai attempted to send Abishqa, who was loyal to him. But Ariq B√∂ke had Abishqa captured and eventually killed, and instead installed his own ally Alghu. Ariq B√∂ke ordered Alghu to defend the area from both the forces of Hulagu, and the possible presence of Berke of the Golden Horde. But Alghu deserted Ariq B√∂ke, killing his envoys for treasure, while Kaidu remained loyal to Ariq B√∂ke. Alghu and Ariq B√∂ke were soon in direct conflict, with Alghu winning the first engagement, but then at the second, Ariq B√∂ke was victorious, and forced Alghu to flee westward. Surrender Eventually, as the war continued between Ariq B√∂ke and his brother Kublai, the former's forces weakened. Kublai had powerful Mongol cavalry troops, Mongolian, Manchurian, Han, Kazakh and numerous Chinese and Goryeo infantry units. Kublai's supporter Kadan, a son of √ñgedei, crushed Ariq B√∂ke's force under General Alandar, and Ariq B√∂ke twice lost control of the capital of Karakorum. Kublai also blockaded all trade to Mongolia from North China, in order to cut the food supply. Ariq B√∂ke finally submitted to Kublai in 1263. He was imprisoned by Kublai and died mysteriously a few years after his surrender, leading to rumors that he had been secretly poisoned. Legacy Tamgha of Ariq B√∂ke. According to scholar David Morgan, \\"Ariq B√∂ke can be seen as representing an influential school of thought among the Mongols, which Kublai through his actions and attitudes after 1260 opposed. Some Mongols felt there was a dangerous drift towards softness, typified in those like Kublai who thought there was something to be said for settled civilization and for the Chinese way of life. In the traditionalist view, the Mongol center ought to remain in Mongolia, and the Mongols' nomadic life be preserved uncontaminated. China ought merely to be exploited. Ariq B√∂ke came to be regarded as this faction's figurehead.\\"Morgan 2007, pp.104‚Äì105 This legacy was continued by Kaidu (Khaidu). Although Ariq B√∂ke lost power, some of his descendants later became important figures in the Ilkhanate and the Northern Yuan dynasty, and the lineage of both Ilkhan Arpa Ke'un and Yes√ºder can be traced back to Ariq B√∂ke.

Famously, this title was held by the son of Shapur III, Prince Bahram, who was bestowed with the title upon being appointed governor of the province of Kirman (present-day Kerman Province). Later, in 390, when he had already succeeded his father as Bahram IV (388‚Äì399), he founded Kermanshah, and applied his former title to the new city, i.e. \\"(City of the) King of Kerman\\". After the revolution in 1979, the city was named Ghahramanshahr for a short period of time, and later the name of the city as well as the province changed to Bakhtaran, apparently due to the presence of the word \\"Shah\\" in the original name. Bakhtaran means western, which refers to the location of the city and the province within Iran. After the Iran‚ÄìIraq War, however, the city was renamed Kermanshah, as it resonated more with the desire of its residents, the Persian literature, and the collective memory of the Iranians. History=Prehistory A view of Kermanshah in mid 19th century- toward south, Farokhshad Mt. and Wasi Mt. are visible at background Because of its antiquity, attractive landscapes, rich culture and Neolithic villages, Kermanshah is considered one of the cradles of prehistoric cultures. According to archaeological surveys and excavation, the Kermanshah area has been occupied by prehistoric people since the Lower Paleolithic period, and continued to later Paleolithic periods till late Pleistocene period. The Lower Paleolithic evidence consists of some handaxes found in the Gakia area to the east of the city. The Middle Paleolithic remains have been found in various parts of the province, especially in the northern vicinity of the city in Tang-e Kenesht, Tang-e Malaverd and near Taq-e Bostan. Archaeological excavations in late 1940s in the Bisitun cave, where the first Neanderthal remain of Iran was discovered by Carleton S. Coon Neanderthal Man existed in the Kermanshah region during this period and the only discovered skeletal remains of this early human in Iran was found in three caves and rockshelter situated in Kermanshah province. The known Paleolithic caves in this area are Warwasi, Qobeh, Malaverd and Do-Ashkaft Cave. The region was also one of the first places in which human settlements including Asiab, Qazanchi, Sarab, Chia Jani, and Ganj-Darreh were established between 8,000 and 10,000 years ago. Clay human figurine (Fertility goddess) Tappeh Sarab, Kermanshah ca. 7000-6100 BCE, Neolithic period, National Museum of Iran This is about the same time that the first potteries pertaining to Iran were made in Ganj-Darreh, near present-day Harsin. In May 2009, based on a research conducted by the University of Hamadan and UCL, the head of Archeology Research Center of Iran's Cultural Heritage and Tourism Organization announced that the one of the oldest prehistoric village in the Middle East dating back to 9800 B.P., was discovered in Sahneh, located west of Kermanshah. Remains of later village occupations and early Bronze Age are found in a number of mound sites in the city itself. Sassanid Kermanshah Bahram as Hercules carved in 153 BC. In ancient Iranian mythology, construction of the city is attributed to Tahmuras, the third king of Pishdadian dynasty. It is believed that the Sassanids have constructed Kermanshah and Bahram IV (he was called Kermanshah, meaning king of Kerman) gave his name to this city.Dehkhoda: Kermanshah . It was a glorious city in Sassanid period about the 4th century AD when it became the capital city of Persian Empire and a significant health center serving as the summer resort for Sassanid kings. In AD 226, following a two-year war led by the Persian Emperor, Ardashir I, against \\"Kurdish\\" tribes in the region, the empire reinstated a local \\"Kurdish\\" prince, Kayus of Medya, to rule Kermanshah. At the time, the term \\"Kurd\\" was used as a social term, designating Iranian nomads, rather than a concrete ethnic group.J. Limbert. (1968). The Origins and Appearance of the Kurds in Pre-Islamic Iran. Iranian Studies, 1.2: pp. 41-51.G. Asatrian. (2009). Prolegemona to the Study of Kurds. Iran and the Caucasus, 13.1: pp. 1-58.

Wiesbaden: Dr. Ludwich Reichert, 1989, pp. 613‚Äì21. excerpt: \\"The ethnic label \\"Kurd\\" is first encountered in Arabic sources from the first centuries of the Islamic era; it seemed to refer to a specific variety of pastoral nomadism, and possibly to a set of political units, rather than to a linguistic group: once or twice, \\"Arabic Kurds\\" are mentioned. By the 10th century, the term appears to denote nomadic and/or transhumant groups speaking an Iranian language and mainly inhabiting the mountainous areas to the South of Lake Van and Lake Urmia, with some offshoots in the Caucasus. ... If there was a Kurdish-speaking subjected peasantry at that time, the term was not yet used to include them.\\" Within the dynasty known as the House of Kayus (also K√¢vusak√¢n) remained a semi-independent kingdom lasting until AD 380 before Ardashir II removed the dynasty's last ruling member. Islamic era Kermanshah was conquered by the Arabs in AD 640. Under Seljuk rule in the eleventh century, it became the major cultural and commercial center in western Iran and the southern Kurdish-inhabited areas as a whole. The Safavids fortified the town, and the Qajars repulsed an attack by the Ottomans during Fath Ali Shah's rule (1797‚Äì1834). Kermanshah was occupied by Ottomans between 1723‚Äì1729 and 1731‚Äì1732. Modern history Occupied by the Imperial Russian army in 1914, followed by the Ottoman army in 1915 during World War I, it was evacuated in 1917 when the British forces arrived there to expel the Ottomans. Kermanshah played an important role in the Iranian Constitutional Revolution during the Qajar dynasty period and the Republic Movement in Pahlavi dynasty period. The city was harshly damaged during the Iran‚ÄìIraq War, and although it was rebuilt, it has not yet fully recovered. General Baratov, Russian Cossack at a meeting with British officers and the leaders of the Kurdish tribes in Kermanshah 1917 Climate Kermanshah has a climate which is heavily influenced by the proximity of the Zagros mountains, classified as a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Csa). The city's altitude and exposed location relative to westerly winds makes precipitation a little bit high (more than twice that of Tehran), but at the same time produces huge diurnal temperature swings especially in the virtually rainless summers, which remain extremely hot during the day. Kermanshah experiences rather cold winters and there are usually rainfalls in fall and spring. Snow cover is seen for at least a couple of weeks in winter.

Taq-e Bostan Taghbostan is a series of large rock reliefs from the era of Sassanid Empire of Persia, the Iranian dynasty which ruled western Asia from 226 to 650 AD. This example of Sassanid art is located from the city center of Kermanshah in western Iran. It is located in the heart of the Zagros mountains, where it has endured almost 1,700 years of wind and rain. The carvings, some of the finest and best-preserved examples of Persian sculpture under the Sassanids, include representations of the investitures of Ardashir II (379‚Äì383) and Shapur III (383‚Äì388). Like other Sassanid symbols, Taghbostan and its relief patterns accentuate power, religious tendencies, glory, honor, the vastness of the court, game and fighting spirit, festivity, joy, and rejoicing. Sassanid kings chose a beautiful setting for their rock reliefs along an historic Silk Road caravan route waypoint and campground. The reliefs are adjacent a sacred spring that empties into a large reflecting pool at the base of a mountain cliff. Taghbostan and its rock relief are one of the 30 surviving Sassanid relics of the Zagros mountains. According to Arthur Pope, the founder of Iranian art and archeology Institute in the US, \\"art was characteristic of the Iranian people and the gift which they endowed the world with.\\" One of the most impressive reliefs inside the largest grotto or ivan is the gigantic equestrian figure of the Sassanid king Khosrau II (591-628 AD) mounted on his favorite charger, Shabdiz. Both horse and rider are arrayed in full battle armor. The arch rests on two columns that bear delicately carved patterns showing the tree of life or the sacred tree. Above the arch and located on two opposite sides are figures of two winged angels with diadems. Around the outer layer of the arch, a conspicuous margin has been carved, jagged with flower patterns. These patterns are also found in the official costumes of Sassanid kings. Equestrian relief panel measured on 16.08.07 approx. 7.45 m across by 4.25 m high. Behistun The Behistun inscription is considered as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Behistun Inscription (also Bisitun or Bisutun, Modern Persian: ÿ®€åÿ≥ÿ™ŸàŸÜ ; Old Persian: Bagastana, meaning \\"the god's place or land\\") is a multi-lingual inscription located on Mount Behistun. The inscription includes three versions of the same text, written in three different cuneiform script languages: Old Persian, Elamite, and Babylonian. A British army officer, Henry Rawlinson, had the inscription transcribed in two parts, in 1835 and 1843. Rawlinson was able to translate the Old Persian cuneiform text in 1838, and the Elamite and Babylonian texts were translated by Rawlinson and others after 1843. Babylonian was a later form of Akkadian: both are Semitic languages. In effect, then, the inscription is to cuneiform what the Rosetta Stone is to Egyptian hieroglyphs: the document most crucial in the decipherment of a previously lost script. The inscription is approximately 15 metres high by 25 meters wide, and 100 meters up a limestone cliff from an ancient road connecting the capitals of Babylonia and Media (Babylon and Ecbatana). It is extremely inaccessible as the mountainside was removed to make the inscription more visible after its completion. The Old Persian text contains 414 lines in five columns; the Elamite text includes 593 lines in eight columns and the Babylonian text is in 112 lines. The inscription was illustrated by a life-sized bas-relief of Darius, holding a bow as a sign of kingship, with his left foot on the chest of a figure lying on his back before him. The prostrate figure is reputed to be the pretender Gaumata. Darius is attended to the left by two servants, and ten one-metre figures stand to the right, with hands tied and rope around their necks, representing conquered peoples. Faravahar floats above, giving his blessing to the king. One figure appears to have been added after the others were completed, as was (oddly enough) Darius' beard, which is a separate block of stone attached with iron pins and lead. Qajar dynasty monuments Jame-Shafeie Mosque During the Qajar dynasty (1794 to 1925), Kermanshah Bazaar, mosques and tekyehs such as Moaven al-molk Mosque, and beautiful houses such as Khajeh Barookh's House were built. Tekyeh Moaven al-molk is unique because it has many pictures on the walls that relate to shahnameh, despite some of its more religious ones. Khajeh Barookh's House is located in the old district of Faizabad, a Jewish neighborhood of the city. It was built by a Jewish merchant of the Qajar period, named Barookh/Baruch. The house, an historical depiction of Iranian architecture, was renamed \\"Randeh-Kesh House\\", after the last owner, is a \\"daroongara\\"(inward oriented) house and is connected through a vestibule to the exterior yard and through a corridor to the interior yard. Surrounding the interior yard are rooms, brick pillars making the iwans(porches) of the house, and step-like column capitals decorated with brick-stalactite work. This house is among the rare Qajar houses with a private bathroom. Khajeh Barookh's House Interior of the second room of Zagros Paleolithic Museum.  Bazaars  Kermanshah is home to at least one bazaar dating back to the Qajar period. Economy Kermanshah is one of the western agricultural core of Iran that produces grain, rice, vegetable, fruits, and oilseeds, however Kermanshah is emerging as a fairly important industrial city; there are two industrial centers with more than 256 manufacturing units in the suburb of the city. These industries include petrochemical refinery, textile manufacturing, food processing, carpet making, sugar refining, and the production of electrical equipment and tools. Kermanshah Oil Refining Company (KORC) established in 1932 by British companies, is one of the major industries in the city. After recent changes in Iraq, Kermanshah has become one of the main importing and exporting gates of Iran. Education=Higher Education More than 49 thousands students are educating in 9 governmental and private universities in the city. Established in 1968 as the Kermanshah Graduate School of Nursing, the Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences was the first university in the west part of Iran. The medical school as a division of Razi University was established in 1976 and admitted some students in general practice. Razi University established in 1972 was the second university in the west part of Iran and is the most-prominent higher education institute in Kermanshah province and also west part of the country. In 2020, Razi University ranked 24th in Iran and 1300th in the world by the U.S. News in universities of all countries of the world based upon 13 factors.

Following a major fire it was laid up and sunk as a target in 2004. History Inchon was laid down on 8 April 1968 by Ingalls Shipbuilding, in Pascagoula, Mississippi, US with the hull classification number LPH-12. It was named for the Battle of Inchon, a turning point of the Korean War. The ship was launched on 24 May 1969; and commissioned on 20 June 1970. Service historyVietnam War= Inchon off Vietnam in 1973. In 1972‚Äì1973, Inchon circumnavigated the globe and returned to Naval Station Norfolk, Virginia. In February 1973, Inchon was attached to Task Force 78 for Operation End Sweep, the U.S. Navy's effort to clear U.S. mines from North Vietnamese waters after the signing of the Paris Peace Accords. Those operations were suspended from 17 April through 17 June. They resumed 18 June and End Sweep was completed on 18 July. On 9 July 1975, more than 100 sailors and marines from Inchon and amphibious transport dock fought a fire on board a Spanish merchant vessel at Palma de Mallorca, Spain. On 16 December, Inchon and oiler were in a minor collision during refueling in rough seas west of Italy. On 5 February 1980, while involved in an underway refueling with in the Atlantic, the two vessels collided, with Inchons helicopter elevator ripping through a Marine berthing space on Spiegel Grove and destroying one of that ship's 50-ton cranes. There were no injuries, however. On September 29, 1981 LCDR Kenneth Wessel, Inchon's Aircraft Handling Officer, was killed when the UH-1 Huey he was flying crashed off the coast of Virginia Beach. Three other crew members on the helicopter were rescued. http://www.hullnumber.com/LPH-12http://www.kevinflatley.com/lsd-32.htm On 7 October 1981, Inchon suffered a boiler explosion while preparing to get underway from Naval Station Norfolk. =Multinational Force - Beirut, Lebanon= From 29 October 1982 to 15 February 1983 Inchon earned the Navy Unit Commendation and the Navy Expeditionary Medal serving as the flagship of Amphibious Squadron 6, on station at Beirut, Lebanon.

On November 1989 a fire in the hangar deck of Inchon injured 31 people while the ship was docked for maintenance in Norfolk. Inchon played a key role in Operation Sharp Edge in 1990, performing evacuation operations during Liberia's civil war. Shortly afterwards, Inchon patrolled the southern Mediterranean in preparation for emergency evacuations in support of Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm. In 1994, Inchon deployed to the Mediterranean Sea and Indian Ocean to conduct Operation Continue Hope off the coast of Somalia and Operation Deny Flight off the coast of Bosnia. Following a six-month deployment, Inchon remained in home port for only two weeks, before it was called upon to assist in Operation Support Democracy off the coast of Haiti. =Mine countermeasures ship= On 1 March 1995, Inchon was re-classed as a mine countermeasures ship MCS-12 and commenced a 15-month conversion/overhaul by Ingalls Shipbuilding. In July 1996, Inchon changed homeports to Ingleside, Texas, home of the U.S. Navy's Mine Warfare Center of Excellence. Sustaining extended mine countermeasures operations at forward deployed locations required extensive command and control and logistics capabilities. Inchon provided both a landing platform for Sikorsky MH-53E Sea Dragon mine-sweeping helicopters and repair and re- supply facility for Avenger-class mine countermeasures ships and Osprey-class coastal minehunters. Inchon was assigned to the Active Naval Reserve Force, 30 September 1996. From March to July 1997, Inchon made its first deployment in its new capacity. Inchon once again deployed in 1999, from April through August, and the crew provided critical heavy lift support to Operation Shining Hope, the humanitarian relief effort for Kosovar refugees in the Balkans. Inchons final deployment began in April 2001. On 19 October 2001, Inchon suffered an oil fire in the main boiler room while conducting inport steaming for engineering trials and assessments. A fuel oil leak had sprung from a faulty gasket on one of the main fuel pumps. This resulted in fuel oil leaking into the bilge. At some unknown point the bilge caught fire. The actual cause of the ignition to the fuel oil remains unknown. The entire bilge caught fire, and the space immediately filled with smoke. Of the nine enlisted men operating in the space, eight made it out. Petty Officer Third Class Ronnie Joe Palm Jr. of Houston, succumbed to smoke inhalation just after helping one of his fellow sailors escape. He was posthumously awarded for his heroism with the highest peacetime honor the Navy could bestow, the Navy and Marine Corps Medal. =Decommissioning and fate= Since severe damage occurred to her boiler plant the Navy made the decision at that time to decommission rather than repair the ship. Inchon was decommissioned, 20 June 2002, at NS Ingleside, Texas. Inchon was laid up in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet, at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register 24 May 2004 and sunk on 5 December 2004 at , in 2,150 fathoms (3.9 km) of water, east of Virginia Beach, Virginia.

Proprietary traders may use a variety of strategies such as index arbitrage, statistical arbitrage, merger arbitrage, fundamental analysis, volatility arbitrage, or global macro trading, much like a hedge fund. Many reporters and analysts believe that large banks purposely leave ambiguous the proportion of proprietary versus non-proprietary trading, because it is felt that proprietary trading is riskier and results in more volatile profits. Relationship to banking Banks are companies that assist other companies in raising financial capital, transacting foreign currency exchange, and managing financial risks. Trading has historically been associated with large banks, because they are often required to make a market to facilitate the services they provide (e.g., trading stocks, bonds, and loans in capital raising; trading currencies to help with international business transactions; and trading interest rates, commodities, and their derivatives to help companies manage risks). For example, if General Store Co. sold stock with a bank, whoever first bought shares would possibly have a hard time selling them to other individuals if people are not familiar with the company. The investment bank agrees to buy the shares sold and look for a buyer. This provides liquidity to the markets. The bank normally does not care about the fundamental, intrinsic value of the shares, but only that it can sell them at a slightly higher price than it could buy them. To do this, an investment bank employs traders. Over time these traders began to devise different strategies within this system to earn even more profit independent of providing client liquidity, and this is how proprietary trading was born. The evolution of proprietary trading at banks reached the point where many banks employed multiple traders devoted solely to proprietary trading, with the hopes of earning added profits above that of market-making. These proprietary trading desks were often considered internal hedge funds within the bank, performing in isolation away from client-flow traders. Proprietary desks routinely had the highest value at risk among other trading desks at the bank. At times, investment banks such as Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank, and the former Merrill Lynch earned a significant portion of their quarterly and annual profits (and losses) through proprietary trading efforts. Regulatory bodies worldwide require that the proprietary trading desk is kept separate from its client- related activity and trading. This is achieved by the use of information barriers (also known as \\"Chinese walls\\"), which prevent conflict of interest which might, for example, allow a Bank to front-run its own customers. There often exists confusion between proprietary positions held by market-making desks (sometimes referred to as warehoused risk) and desks specifically assigned the task of proprietary trading. Because of recent financial regulations like the Volcker Rule in particular, most major banks have spun off their prop trading desks or shut them down altogether. However, prop trading is not gone. It is carried out at specialized prop trading firms and hedge funds. The prop trading done at many firms is usually highly technology- driven, utilizing complex quantitative models and algorithms. Arbitrage One of the main strategies of trading, traditionally associated with banks, is arbitrage. In the most basic sense, arbitrage is defined as taking advantage of a price discrepancy through the purchase or sale of certain combinations of securities to lock in a market-neutral profit. The trade will remain subject to various non-market risks, such as settlement risk and other operational risks. Investment banks, which are often active in many markets around the world, constantly watch for arbitrage opportunities. One of the more-notable areas of arbitrage, called risk arbitrage or merger arbitrage, evolved in the 1980s. When a company plans to buy another company, often the share price of the buyer falls (because the buyer will have to pay money to buy the other company) and the share price of the purchased company rises (because the buyer usually buys those shares at a price higher than the current price). When an investment bank believes a buyout is imminent, it often sells short the shares of the buyer (betting that the price will go down) and buys the shares of the company being acquired (betting the price will go up). Conflicts of interest There are a number of ways in which proprietary trading can create conflicts of interest between a bank's interests and those of its customers. As investment banks are key figures in mergers and acquisitions, it is possible (though prohibited) for traders to use inside information to engage in merger arbitrage. Investment banks are required to have a Chinese wall separating their trading and investment banking divisions; however, in recent years, especially since the Enron scandal, these have come under closer scrutiny. One example of an alleged conflict of interest can be found in charges brought by the Australian Securities and Investment Commission against Citigroup in 2007. Famous trading banks and traders Famous proprietary traders have included Ivan Boesky, Steven A. Cohen, John Meriwether, Daniel Och, and Boaz Weinstein. Some of the investment banks most historically associated with trading were Salomon Brothers and Drexel Burnham Lambert. Trader Nick Leeson took down Barings Bank with unauthorized proprietary positions. Another trader, Brian Hunter, brought down the hedge fund Amaranth Advisors when his massive positions in natural gas futures went bad. Armin S, a German private trader, sued BNP Paribas for 152m EUR because they sold to him structured products for 108 EUR each which were worth 54 00 EUR.

With the growth of the Welsh Harp as a place of entertainment, Robb expanded the business by engaging engineers to build a new brewery in The Hyde by 1855. Having dug a new well, the water, which was raised by two horses, was itself sold as a valuable source of revenue. The trade was slow, and Robb was only managing to sell one barrel a week in low season. With the fluctuations in demand Robb was unable to meet the repayments of his debt from the expansion, and had to sell the brewery (c1861). The next owner was Arthur Ocran Crooke, who reputedly purchased it for ¬£140. Crooke was only in his early 20s but had come from a commercial brewing family, GW and FA Crooke of Guildford, and was able to manage the changes in supply and demand. With the construction of the railway a few years later he was able to supply the beer directly to Waring Bros and the hundreds of navvies engaged on the building of the line. From the money he made from this Mr Crooke bought up a number of inns in Hendon and Finchley, including the Surrey Arms (which he rebuilt). In 1872 a steam engine was introduced to speed up the process, and in 1874 he expanded. The Brewery was destroyed by fire on 29 August 1878, and was reopened the following year, having been completely rebuilt by J P Dunne of Church Lane, Hendon from the insurance money. In 1892 and 1893 the brewery expanded to twice its size and included property over the road on the Kingsbury side of the Edgware Road. The new site was fitted with a brand new ‚Äútrim little‚Äù steam engine, and ably assisted by his manager of 20 years, Mr H Woolley, Hendon Brewery was now brewing several hundred barrels of beer a week, and distributing it throughout Middlesex and Hertfordshire. It was said to taste not unlike Burton Ale. Compressed Canadian hay, which was stored in the loft, caught light early on the morning of 15 March 1894 and the brewery burned down for a second time. Crooke had gambled on the expansion with the money for the insurance; he was unable to provide the capital to rebuild the brewery again. Forced to sell his interest the following year to Messrs Michell and Aldous for ¬£83,000, he moved to Twickenham where he died in 1902, his will broken. Messrs Michell and Aldous continued at Hendon until 1920 when the site was sold to Truman's Brewery. Hendon Brewery closed in 1959.

When applied to processing of the reflected signal in remote sensing for topography, homodyne detection lacks the ability of heterodyne detection to determine the size of a static discontinuity in elevation between two locations. (If there is a path between the two locations with smoothly changing elevation, then homodyne detection may in principle be able to track the signal phase along the path if sampling is dense enough). Homodyne detection is more readily applicable to velocity sensing. In optics In optical interferometry, homodyne signifies that the reference radiation (i.e. the local oscillator) is derived from the same source as the signal before the modulating process. For example, in a laser scattering measurement, the laser beam is split into two parts. One is the local oscillator and the other is sent to the system to be probed. The scattered light is then mixed with the local oscillator on the detector. This arrangement has the advantage of being insensitive to fluctuations in the frequency of the laser. Usually the scattered beam will be weak, in which case the (nearly) steady component of the detector output is a good measure of the instantaneous local oscillator intensity and therefore can be used to compensate for any fluctuations in the intensity of the laser. Radio technology In radio technology, the distinction is not the source of the local oscillator, but the frequency used. In heterodyne detection, the local oscillator is frequency-shifted, while in homodyne detection it has the same frequency as the radiation to be detected. See direct conversion receiver. Applications Lock-in amplifiers are homodyne detectors integrated into measurement equipment or packaged as stand-alone laboratory equipment for sensitive detection and highly selective filtering of weak or noisy signals. Homodyne/lock-in detection has been one of the most commonly used signal processing methods across a wide range of experimental disciplines for decades. Homodyne and heterodyne techniques are commonly used in thermoreflectance techniques. In the processing of signals in some applications of magnetic resonance imaging, homodyne detection can offer advantages over magnitude detection. The homodyne technique can suppress excessive noise and undesired quadrature components (90¬∞ out-of-phase), and provide stable access to information that may be encoded into the phase or polarity of images. An encrypted secure communication system can be based on quantum key distribution (QKD). An efficient receiver scheme for implementing QKD is balanced homodyne detection (BHD) using a positive-intrinsic-negative (PIN) diode. Homodyne detection was one of the key techniques in demonstrating quantum entanglement.

The foundation of telecom network in India was laid by the British sometime in 19th century. During the British era, 1850; the first telegraph line, was established between Calcutta and Diamond Harbour. The British East India Company started using the telegraph in 1851 and till 1854 telegraph lines were laid across the country. In 1854, the telegraph service was opened to the public and the first telegram was sent from Mumbai to Pune. In 1885, the Indian Telegraph Act was passed by the British Imperial Legislative Council. After the bifurcation of Post and Telegraph department in 1980s, The creation of Department of Telecom eventually led to the emergence of the State owned telegraph and telephone company which led to foundation of BSNL. It continued the telegraph services in India until it shut down telegraph services completely on 15 July 2013. After providing it for 160 years, BSNL discontinued its telegraph service on 15 July 2013. It began delivering telegrams to the public in February 1855; this service was upgraded to a web-based messaging system in 2010 and had been offered through 182 telegraph offices across India.

The organisational structure of BSNL is as follows: Chief General Manager being the head of the Circle who is the officer of HAG+ level, assisted by three or four Principal General Manager(PGM) who is the officer of grade HAG.The districts over a circle is being headed by the designations as General Manager officer of grade of SAG who looks over around two to four districts, while where the connections are less and the smaller district is being headed by Telecom District Manager(TDM) Officer of the grade of JAG and Telecom Divisional Engineer(TDE) officer of STS grade, all the officers above the post of TDE(including TDE) are of Group A and they are the officers of grade of Indian Telecom Service(ITS) directly or promotive. Then the Group B consists of Additional Divisional Engineer, Sub Divisional Engineer and Junior Telecom officer and then the organisation has Group C and D employees. Merger and Acquisitions On 24 October 2019, the Government of India announced revival package for BSNL and MTNL which includes monetising assets, raising funds, TD- LTE spectrum, voluntary retirement scheme for employees. Apart from package, Ministry of Communications decided to merge MTNL with Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited. Pending this, MTNL will be subsidiary of BSNL. Controversies=Cyber Attack In July 2017, BSNL had a cyber attack which affected south India, especially Karnataka, when a malware affected Telco's broadband network using a modem having default passwords. This virus reportedly affected 60,000 modems and blocked internet connectivity. Later BSNL issued an advisory notice to its broadband customers, urging them to change their default router username and passwords.

The palace is the official residence of the current Norwegian monarch while the Crown Prince resides at Skaugum in Asker west of Oslo. The palace is located at the end of Karl Johans gate in central Oslo and is surrounded by the Palace Park with the Palace Square in the front. History Until the completion of the palace, Norwegian royalty resided in Pal√©et, the magnificent townhouse in Christiania that the wealthy merchant Bernt Anker bequeathed to the State in 1805 to be used as a royal residence. During the last years of the union with Denmark Pal√©et was used by the viceroys of Norway, and in 1814 by the first king of independent Norway, Christian Frederick. King Charles III John of the House of Bernadotte resided there as crown prince and later as king during his frequent visits to his Norwegian capital. Construction Charles John chose the site for the permanent royal palace on the western side of Christiania in 1821 and commissioned the officer and inexperienced architect, Danish-born Hans Linstow, to design the building. The Parliament approved the stipulated cost of 150 000 speciedaler to be financed by the sale of government bonds. Work on the site started in 1824, and on 1 October 1825 Charles John laid down the foundation stone beneath the altar of the future palace chapel. Linstow originally planned a building of only two storeys with projecting wings on both sides of the main fa√ßade. The costly foundation works caused the budget to be exceeded, and the building stopped in 1827, only to be resumed in 1833. In the meantime, the Storting refused additional grants as a demonstration against the king's unpopular efforts to establish a closer union between his two kingdoms. In 1833, Linstow produced a less costly project without the projecting wings, but with a third storey as compensation. Improved relations with the king made the Storting grant the necessary funds to complete the building. The roof was laid in 1836, and the interiors were finished during the late 1840s.  The Royal Palace Chapel  The Royal Palace contains its own chapel, consecrated in 1844. The Church of Norway is responsible for the religious services taking place there. It is the scene of many events of the Norwegian Royal Family like the royal baptisms and confirmations. There are also concerts of church music and chamber music.The Palace Chapel Royal House of Norway (in English) During the Bernadotte dynasty  King Charles John never had the pleasure of residing in his palace before he died in 1844, and its first occupants were his son Oscar I and his queen Josephine. It was soon found that the royal family needed a more spacious residence, and the wings facing the garden were extended. Before the official inauguration in 1849, the central colonnade that had been axed in 1833 was reintroduced, and the provisional steep roof was replaced by a more elegant and more expensive flat roof. The next Bernadotte kings Charles IV and Oscar II continued to use the royal palace in Christiania, but spent most of their time in Stockholm. King Oscar's wife, Sophia of Nassau, preferred to spend summers in Norway, but mostly stayed at the country manor Skinnarb√∏l near the Swedish border for the sake of her health. Oscar II was absent from the palace during 1905, the year of the dissolution of the union with Sweden, but his son, then Crown Prince Gustaf, paid two short visits in his vain attempts to save the union.  Permanent royal residence  The Bernadotte dynasty resigned their Norwegian throne in 1905 and was succeeded by Prince Carl of Denmark, who took the name of Haakon VII when he accepted his election as king of a completely independent Norway. Haakon became the first monarch to use the palace permanently and the palace was therefore refurbished for two years before he, Queen Maud and Crown Prince Olav could move in. King Haakon would be the first monarch to greet the children's parade on the palace balcony during the Norwegian Constitution Day celebration in Oslo. It was also King Haakon VII who in 1905 introduced the tradition of weekly meetings with the Council of State, a tradition which is still practiced with the meetings always being held in the palaces' Council Chamber where the King's throne chair is located.  Modernization and public access  During the reign and residence of King Olav V from 1954 to 1991, there was little funds for renovation, something the poorly-built original structure direly needed. King Olav would therefore mostly reside at Skaugum and the Bygd√∏y Royal Estate, but relocated to the palace in 1968 when he gave the Skaugum estate as a wedding gift to his son Crown Prince Harald and his bride Crown Princess Sonja. Shortly after his ascension, King Harald V started a comprehensive renovation project of the palace. The renovations and improvements, all made by Statsbygg, included new fire alarm systems, the construction of new bathrooms, kitchens, offices and a general restructuring of the palace. The King was criticized because of the amount of money needed to bring the palace up to a satisfactory state even if much of this went to rectify construction deficits from a century and a half ago. With the renovations completed, the King and Queen relocated from Skaugum to the palace in 2001 as the Skaugum estate was to become the new home of Crown Prince Haakon and his family. The palace, like all royal residence in Norway, is guarded by His Majesty The King's Guard; the Royal Guards. Since public tours began in 2002, the general public has been able to view and appreciate the renovation and splendor that the palace now boasts. The daily changing of the guards has also become a popular tourist attraction in recent years.

An alternative construction fits the outer races inside a metal tube, while the inner races are mounted on a shaft with a non-conductive section (e.g. two sleeves on an insulating rod). This method has the advantage that the tube will act as a flywheel. The motor rarely starts without assistance, having effectively zero static torque, but once rotation begins the motor will accelerate until it reaches a steady speed, the direction of rotation is determined by the initial spin. Although ball bearing motors can reach reasonably high speeds they are very inefficient, producing significant torque typically requires so much power that the bearings are heated to several hundred degrees. S. Marinov suggests that the device produces motion from electricity without magnetism being involved, operating purely by the resistance heating causing an asymmetric thermal expansion of the balls in the bearings as they rotate. The same explanation is given by Watson, Patel and Sedcole for rotating cylinders (instead of balls). However, H. Gruenberg has given a thorough theoretical explanation based on pure electromagnetism (and neglecting the thermal effects completely). Also, P. Hatzikonstantinou and P. G. Moyssides claim to have found an excellent agreement between the results from the electromagnetic theory and the experiments measuring the total power and efficiency of the motor.

The fair catch kick is a rule at the professional and high school levels of American football that allows a team that has just made a fair catch to attempt a free kick from the spot of the catch. The kick must be either a place kick or a drop kick, and if it passes over the crossbar and between the goalposts of the opposing team's goal, a field goal, worth three points, is awarded to the kicking team. The fair catch kick has its origins in rugby football's goal from mark, which has since been abolished in both major rugby codes; a similar rule, the mark, is a major part of Australian rules football. The fair catch kick is considered to be obscure and unusual, and it is only rarely used. Because most fair catches are made well out of field goal range, and in most cases a team that has a fair catch within theoretical range will attempt a normal drive to score a touchdown, the fair catch kick is most viable to use when a team has fair caught within field goal range and there is insufficient time to score a touchdown. At the professional level, the last successful fair catch kick was made by the San Diego Chargers in 1976. Rule The fair catch kick rule states that, after a player has successfully made a fair catch or has been awarded a fair catch as the result of a penalty such as kick catch interference, their team can attempt a kick from the spot of the catch;NFHS Rulebook, p. 46.NFL Rules, p. 55. the National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS) rulebook also allows a kick to be made if the down following the fair catch or awarded fair catch has to be replayed. Prior to the kick, the opposing team must be lined up at least ten yards beyond the spot of the ball.NFHS Rulebook, p. 52.NFL Rules, p. 59. The kick itself can be either a place kick or drop kick;NFHS Rulebook, p. 32.NFL Rules, p. 57. a kicking tee cannot be used at the professional level, but use of a tee up to two inches in height is permitted at the high school level.NFHS Rulebook, pp. 15, 32. Like other field goal attempts, the kicking team is awarded three points if the kick goes above the crossbar and between the goalposts of the opposing team's goal and did not touch a player of the kicking team after the kick.NFHS Rulebook, pp. 55, 66.NFL Rules, p. 56-59. If the attempt fails, the opposing team is awarded control of the ball from the spot of the kick.NFHS Rulebook, p. 37.NFL Rules, p. 58. The opposing team can also return the kick if it does not go out of bounds. In the NFHS rulebook, the fair catch kick is specifically defined as a free kick.NFHS Rulebook, p. 55. The National Football League (NFL) rulebook specifically states that the fair catch kick is not a free kick, instead considering the fair catch kick to be a distinct type of kick.NFL Rules, p. 13. Despite this, reporters at both levels describe the fair catch kick as a free kick. History The fair catch kick found in American football originated in rugby football. A similar rule in rugby, the goal from mark, allowed a player who had fair caught a ball to attempt an uncontested free kick from the spot of the fair catch. Both major codes of rugby have eliminated the rule; rugby league abolished the goal from mark in 1922, and rugby union removed it in 1977. Australian rules football has retained the rule, and it is a vital part of the Australian game; a \\"fair catch\\" of a ball kicked more than 15 meters in the air is called a mark, and the player making the mark is then awarded a free kick. The fair catch kick has been present in the NFL rulebook since the league's inception, and also remains in the NFHS rulebook.Nelson 1993, p. 235. The fair catch kick is not legal in National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA) football; the NCAA abolished the fair catch in 1950, but re-added it a year later. When the fair catch returned to the rulebook, however, the option to attempt a kick after the fair catch was removed.Nelson 1993, pp. 233-235. Usage The fair catch kick rule is very rarely invoked, and is one of the rarest plays in football. The rule has been regarded as \\"obscure\\", \\"bizarre\\", and \\"quirky\\". A unique set of circumstances is required for a fair catch kick to be a viable option. For one, the fair catch would need to be made at a point on the field where a field goal attempt has a reasonable chance of being successful; most fair catches are made well outside of field goal range. Furthermore, for a fair catch kick to be a viable option near the end of the fourth quarter, the team attempting the kick needs to be either tied or behind by three points or fewer; even if such a situation were to occur, a coach might still decline to attempt a fair catch kick. For example, New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick, known for his knowledge and utilization of obscure football rules, declined the opportunity to attempt a 75-yard fair catch kick at the end of Super Bowl LI; although kicker Stephen Gostkowski was able to kick the ball that far and the game was tied, Belichick felt the risk of a return touchdown by the opposing team off a failed kick outweighed the opportunity to score from the kick. Art McNally, who led the officiating department of the National Football League from 1968 to 1990, said that even in the event a fair catch is made within field goal range, most teams would attempt to score a touchdown unless there is not enough time left to score one. Accordingly, most fair catch kick attempts occur when a team has fair-caught a ball from a punt from deep in their opponent's territory but there is not enough time left in the half to go for a touchdown. Despite its drawbacks, there are several unique advantages to using the fair catch kick. Because the defense is required to be ten yards beyond the spot of the kick, the kicker can take a running start before kicking as opposed to the typical two steps taken on regular field goal attempts. Similarly, the kicker does not have to worry about a low snap because the ball is not snapped. The defense is not able to block the kick, allowing the kicker to give the ball a lower trajectory than usual. The fair catch kick would also be of a shorter distance than a normal field goal attempt from the same spot, because the fair catch kick is taken from the spot of the catch, while a typical field goal is taken seven yards back from the line of scrimmage. Known attempts in the NFL The NFL does not keep a record of fair catch kick attempts, so the exact number of attempts is unknown. Out of the 25 recorded fair catch kick attempts in non-exhibition games, only six were successful; all five known attempts in exhibition games were unsuccessful. With the exception of the second recorded attempt, which was made in the 3rd quarter, all fair catch kick attempts were made within the last 30 seconds of either the 2nd or 4th quarter. The last successful attempt was made in 1976 by Ray Wersching of the San Diego Chargers (45 yards), and the longest successful attempt was made in 1964 by Paul Hornung of the Green Bay Packers (52 yards). The most recent fair catch kick attempt was by Carolina Panthers kicker Joey Slye, who missed a 60-yard fair catch kick wide right on October 13, 2019.

Until 2006, they played in the Isthmian League, but lost their place in that league as part of the 2006 re-structuring of non-league football, and now play in the . They play at Croydon Sports Arena in South Norwood. The club was founded in 1953 as Croydon Amateurs. History The club was founded in 1953 as Croydon Amateurs FC and its original players came from some of the stronger clubs playing in local football. The club was specially formed to play at the Croydon Arena (still its home today) when it was officially opened in 1953. The team made its debut at the Arena against Malden Town on Saturday 5 September 1953, winning 4-3. The club spent their first ten years in the Surrey Senior League but whilst failing to win the championship (thrice finishing runners-up), evolved into one of that competition's strongest teams. In 1963‚Äì64, they joined the Spartan League, winning the league title at the first attempt in their only season in the competition. 1964 saw them join the Athenian League where they spent the next ten years, winning the Second Division title in 1965‚Äì66, suffering relegation four years later and then gaining two successive promotions to the Premier Division as runners-up to Herne Bay (1970‚Äì71) and Harlow Town (1971‚Äì72) under the managership of Jimmy Rose. Rose's departure to Dulwich Hamlet saw a mass player exodus and a season of struggle ensued. 1973 saw the suffix Amateurs dropped due to the impending changes to the status of players and a year later, under the management of Ted Shepherd, election to the expanding Isthmian League. Two seasons later, after an unbeaten 1975‚Äì76 campaign, the club gained promotion to the Isthmian's top division ‚Äì initially titled Division One but then retitled the Premier Division where they spent twelve seasons before relegation to the First Division in 1989. An FA Cup run in the 1979-80 season led to a home draw in the 2nd round to Football League opposition in the shape of Division Three Millwall. The tie was switched to be played at Selhurst Park and in front of almost 10,000 people the Croydon team, captained by Alec Jackson held their League opponents to a 1-1 draw thanks to a Rod Ward goal. The replay three days later could not separate the two sides after 90 minutes with Constable scoring twice for Croydon, but Millwall eventually winning the match narrowly 3-2 after extra time. A further relegation followed in 1994, but following Ken Jarvie taking over as Chairman / Manager and internal reorganisation, they were promoted back to Division One within two seasons. The club's first Isthmian League title ‚Äì champions of Division One followed in 2000, before relegation two years later. Alec Jackson, Captain of the 79-80 cup run team, meeting players of the 19-20 Croydon FC squad. Jan 2020 The non-league scene was reorganised at the end of the 2005‚Äì06 season and this restructuring saw them placed in the Kent League where following a third-place finish in 2006‚Äì07, the club finished in mid- table the second two seasons. 2008‚Äì09 culminated with success in the Kent League Cup after a penalty shootout win over Erith Town. The Croydon team lifting the 2009 Kent League Cup. That turned out to be the club's final Kent League fixture as they shuffled sideways into the Combined Counties League (a competition which evolved from the Surrey Senior League) for the 2009‚Äì10 season. This is effectively back where they spent their first ten years and there is long-term rebuilding underway - the first three seasons in the CCFL saw them finish lower midway. For the 2014-15 season, the club was switched to the Southern Counties East League (formerly the Kent League). The club also runs a successful youth programme, a midweek Under 18 team playing in Ryman Youth League, a second under 18 team playing in the new Combined Counties league and a Sunday team who play in the Croydon Municipal league. In their first season the Sunday side were promoted and won the Leonard Vase Cup (2012‚Äì13) Recent players to have graduated from the youth programme include Danny Mills, Lee Brown and Stefan Payne.

He is considered one of the founders of phytogeography, the study of the geographic distribution of plants. Willdenow was also a mentor of Alexander von Humboldt, one of the earliest and best known phytogeographers. He also influenced Christian Konrad Sprengel, who pioneered the study of plant pollination and floral biology. Biography Willdenow was born in Berlin and studied medicine and botany at the University of Halle. After studying pharmaceutics at Wieglieb College, Langensalza and in medicine at Halle, he returned to Berlin to work at his father's pharmacy located in the Unter den Linden. His early interest in botany was kindled by his uncle J. G. Gleditsch and he started a herbarium collection in his teenage years. In 1794 he became a member of the Berlin Academy of Sciences. He was a director of the Botanical garden of Berlin from 1801 until his death. In 1807 Alexander von Humboldt helped to expand the garden. There he studied many South American plants, brought back by Humboldt. He was interested in the adaptation of plants to climate, showing that the same climate had plants having common characteristics. His herbarium, containing more than 20,000 species, is still preserved in the Botanical Garden in Berlin. Some of the specimens include those collected by Humboldt. Humboldt notes that as a young man he was unable to identify plants using Willdenow's Flora Berolinensis. He subsequently visited Willdenow without an appointment and found him to be a kindred soul only four years older and in three weeks he became an enthusiastic botanist. In his 1792 book, Grundriss der Kr√§uterkunde or Geschichte der Pflanzen Willdenow came up with an idea to explain restricted plant distributions. Willdenow suggested that it was based on past history with mountains surrounded by seas with different sets of plants initially restricted to the peaks which then spread downward and out with receding sea levels. This would fit with the Biblical notion of floods. This was contrary to earlier assertions by Eberhard August Wilhelm von Zimmermann that plants were distributed as they had been in the past and that there had been no changes.

It funds research to beat heartbreak from heart and circulatory diseases and their risk factors. Foundation The British Heart Foundation was founded in 1961 by a group of medical professionals, who were concerned about the increasing death rate from cardiovascular disease. They wanted to fund extra research into the causes, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of heart and circulatory diseases. It is a major funder and authority in cardiovascular research, education, and care, and relies predominantly on voluntary donations to meet its aims. In order to increase income and maximise the impact of its work, it also works with other organizations to combat premature death and disability from cardiovascular disease. Activities British Heart Foundation Cymru demonstrating CPR skills A British Heart Foundation furniture and electricals shop, Gloucester British Heart Foundation shop, King Street, Hammersmith The British Heart Foundation‚Äôs main focus is to fund cardiovascular research, aiming to spend around ¬£100 million a year funding scientists around the UK. They are currently funding over 1000 research projects. Since 2008 the British Heart Foundation has been investing in Centres of Research Excellence. The six current centres bring together scientists from a number of disciplines to work on research projects to beat heart and circulatory disease. The current Centres of Research are: * Imperial College London * King‚Äôs College London * University of Cambridge * University of Edinburgh * University of Glasgow * University of Oxford In 2013 the BHF committed to funding three multi-institution Centres of Regenerative Medicine, investing ¬£7.5 million over four years to fund scientists looking for new treatments for heart failure. Other activities include: * Information ‚Äì BHF will provide information to help people reduce their own heart health risk. * Campaigning ‚Äì BHF will get government to establish policies that minimise the risk of developing heart and circulatory disease * Support ‚Äì offering advice to those with heart conditions via their website, information booklets or heart helpline. * Life saving skills ‚Äì the BHF currently offers free CPR kits to schools and is working with the Department of Health to distribute defibrillators throughout England. In 2015 The British Heart Foundation had an income of just over ¬£133m. In 2015 the BHF spent ¬£102.5 million on funding cardiovascular research and ¬£30.8 million on prevention, survival and support activities. Sponsorship The British Heart Foundation sponsored two television series produced by Twofour, Kitchen Detective and Kid's Fit Squad. Both series encouraged healthy eating and exercise with practical advice for families, and aired on the Discovery Health channel. The BHF, along with Cancer Research UK, is a major backer of the anti-tobacco campaign group Action on Smoking and Health. Facts and figures * There are over 950 BHF Healthcare Professionals caring for patients across the UK. * Over 3,800 Heartstart UK schemes to educate people what to do in various emergency situations (not just cardiac emergencies). More than 3.5 million people have been trained by Heartstart UK in schools (for example via the Saving Londoners' Lives project) and the community. * In 2013, the British Heart Foundation had a gross income of over ¬£133m.BHF Annual Report and Accounts 2013; Facts and figures * Every year 1 in every 145 babies are born in the UK with a congenital heart defect. * The 'heartbeat' logo was designed in 1971 by Sheila Harrison, one of BHF's regional organisers at the time. It's still very much in use today and is now one of the most recognisable logos in the UK. Fundraising The BHF is mainly funded by legacies and wills, accounting for 40% of their income, the rest is made up of other voluntary income (31%), profit from the retail division (23%) and investment income (5%). The charity organises a sponsored skipping challenge through schools, Jump Rope for Heart, in which the participating schools are entitled to retain 20% of the money raised. Other annual campaigns include National Heart Month (held throughout February), Wear Red Day and The Big Donation as well as many other campaigns to recruit volunteers, raise awareness of BHF, sell stock and increase donations. In December 2010 Victoria Wood performed a show called \\"The Angina Monologues\\" for The British Heart Foundation with the strapline \\"Beating Heart Disease one laugh at a time\\". Retail Division Valentine's Day shop window display in Monmouth, Wales. The British Heart Foundation Shops Division was founded in 1986, and was renamed Retail Division in 2010. The BHF run a large chain of charity shops throughout England, Wales and Scotland, as of December 2016 they run 737 shops which include over 160 furniture and electrical shops (or F+E shops), and they are looking to acquire more sites in the coming years. They also have an online shop and an eBay Store. The BHF Retail division makes roughly ¬£30 million every year. BHF shops are predominantly staffed by roughly 22,500 volunteers and each shop also has a paid staff made up of a shop manager, assistant manager and may also have a shop assistant. The British Heart Foundation were the first charity shops to Gift Aid their donations to get extra money by claiming the tax back from the donor. The Retail Director is Mike Taylor and the headquarters of the retail division is based in Claygate, England. The BHF has 730 shops across the UK. Criticism=Animal research The charity is one of four organisations subject to a national boycott campaign regarding their funding of animal research. \\"Animal Aid plans to take out a series of newspaper adverts urging the public to stop giving money to Cancer Research UK, the British Heart Foundation, the Alzheimer's Society and Parkinson's UK unless they end their support for animal testing.\\" In November 2011 a protest took place calling for the BHF and the University of Leeds to stop carrying out co-funded \\"lethal experiments\\" on dogs. The pressure group Animal Aid stated that 100 dogs had died since 1988 during the experiments. The BHF has responded to these criticisms by saying the charity only funds animal research after grant applications have gone through an independent peer review process and follows the three Rs principles when considering such grants. Wealth screening On 6 December 2016, the BHF was fined ¬£18,000 by the UK Information Commissioner's Office which ruled that the charity had breached data protection legislation by employing external bodies to analyse the financial status of supporters in order to appeal to them for further donations, a practice known as 'wealth screening', and by trading the personal details of its donors with other charitable organisations. The BBC reported that, \\"Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham said donors had not been informed of the charity's practices, and were therefore unable to consent or object to them. She also suggested other charities could also be engaged in similar activities. 'The millions of people who give their time and money to benefit good causes will be saddened to learn that their generosity wasn't enough,' Ms Denham added.\\" The same BBC report noted that the charity's chief executive had stated that \\"the ICO's conclusions were 'wrong, disproportionate and inconsistent [‚Ä¶] We find the decision surprising, as earlier this year in June the ICO praised our data handling. Our trustees will therefore consider whether it's in the interests of our supporters and beneficiaries to challenge this decision.\\" See also *American Heart Association *Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada *Heart Disease Research Foundation *National Heart Foundation of Australia *United OneHeart Foundation *Heart Protection Study *Arrhythmia Alliance ReferencesExternal links  Category:Health charities in the United Kingdom Category:Health in the London Borough of Camden Category:Heart disease organizations Category:Organisations based in the London Borough of Camden Category:Organizations established in 1961 Category:1961 establishments in the United Kingdom ","title":"British Heart Foundation"},{"id":"1489438","text":"BHF may refer to: *Bahrain Handball Federation, governing body of handball in Bahrain *Bangladesh Handball Federation, governing body of handball in Bangladesh *Bolivian hemorrhagic fever *British Heart Foundation *BHF Bank *Buffered HF *Bornhuetter-Ferguson method ","title":"BHF (disambiguation)"},{"id":"1489447","title":"Cherie Lunghi"},{"id":"1489460","text":"Cloud 9 is a two-act play written by British playwright Caryl Churchill. It was workshopped with the Joint Stock Theatre Company in late 1978 and premiered at Dartington College of Arts, Devon, on 14 February 1979.Caryl Churchill, Plays: One (London: Methuen London, 1985) The two acts of the play form a contrapuntal structure. Act I is set in British colonial Africa in the Victorian era, and Act II is set in a London park in 1979. However, between the acts only twenty-five years pass for the characters. Each actor plays one role in Act I and a different role in Act II ‚Äì the characters who appear in both acts are played by different actors in the first and second. Act I parodies the conventional comedy genre and satirizes Victorian society and colonialism. Act II shows what could happen when the restrictions of both the comic genre and Victorian ideology are loosened. One of Churchill's most renowned works, the play uses controversial portrayals of sexuality and obscene language, and establishes a parallel between colonial and sexual oppression.Michael Patterson, The Oxford Guide to Plays (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2007) Its humour depends on incongruity and the carnivalesque, and helps to convey Churchill's political message about accepting people who are different and not dominating them or forcing them into particular social roles.

Clive makes passionate advances to Mrs Saunders, his wife Betty fancies Harry, who secretly has sex with Clive's son, Edward. The governess Ellen, who reveals herself to be a lesbian, is forced into marriage with Harry after his sexuality is discovered and condemned by Clive. Act 1 ends with the wedding celebrations; the final scene of the first act ends with Clive giving a speech while Joshua, watched by Edward (who does nothing), aims his rifle at him and fires as the scene ends with a blackout. ; Act II Although Act II is set in 1979, some of the characters of Act I reappear ‚Äì for them, only 25 years have passed. Betty has left Clive, her daughter Victoria is now married to an overbearing Martin, and Edward has an openly gay relationship with Gerry. Victoria, upset and distant from Martin, starts a lesbian relationship with Lin. When Gerry leaves Edward, Edward, who discovers he is in fact bisexual, moves in with his sister and Lin. The three of them have a drunken ceremony in which they call up the Goddess, after which characters from Act I begin appearing. Act II has a looser structure, and Churchill played around with the ordering of the scenes. The final scene shows that Victoria has left Martin for a polyamorous relationship with Edward and Lin, and they are sharing custody of their son Tommy. Gerry and Edward are on good terms again, and Betty becomes friends with Gerry, who tells her about Edward's sexuality. Interpretations and observations ; Act I Act I of Cloud 9 invites the audience to engage with Britain's colonial past, but does so by challenging 'the preconceived notions held by the audience in terms of gender and sexuality'.Shannon Baisden, 'How Feminist Theatre Became \\"Queer\\": A Look into Caryl Churchill's Cloud Nine' (2004), p. 1 Churchill subverts gender and racial stereotypes, using cross-gender and cross-racial casting: Betty is played by a man in act I, but by a woman in act II; Joshua is played by a white; and Edward is played by a woman in act I and by a man in act II. Churchill deliberately uses this cross-gender,-racial and -age casting to unsettle the audience's expectations. In the introduction to the play, Churchill explains why Betty is played by a man in the first act: \\"She wants to be what men want her to be ... Betty does not value herself as a woman.\\" Michael Patterson confirms this, writing that \\"Betty is played by a man in order to show how femininity is an artificial and imposed construct\\".Michael Patterson, The Oxford Guide to Plays (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2007), p. 84 James Harding suggests that by cross-casting Betty and Edward in Act I, Churchill is also playing it safe: It makes same-sex relationships visibly heterosexual and normative.James M. Harding, \\"Cloud Cover: (Re)Dressing Desire and Comfortable Subversions in Caryl Churchill's Cloud Nine\\" PMLA 113.2 (1998): 258-72. The black servant, Joshua, is played by a white man for similar reasons. He says, \\"My skin is black, but oh my soul is white. I hate my tribe. My master is my light\\"; Amelia Howe Kritzer argues that \\"the reversal exposes the rupture in Joshua's identity caused by his internalization of colonial values\\".Amelia Howe Kritzer, The Plays of Caryl Churchill (London, The MacMillan Press, 1991), pp 111-13, 122 Joshua does not identify with his \\"own\\" people; in act I, scene 3, Mrs. Saunders asks if he doesn't mind beating his own people and Joshua replies that they are not his people, and they are \\"bad.\\" ; Act II The second act is set in London 1979, but for the characters only twenty-five years have passed. Churchill explains her reason for this in the introduction: \\"The first act, like the society it shows, is male-dominated and firmly structured. In the second act, more energy comes from the women and the gays.\\" In Act II, British colonial oppression remains present, this time in the armed presence in Northern Ireland. Michael Patterson writes that \\"the actors ... established a 'parallel between colonial and sexual oppression,' showing how the British occupation of Africa in the nineteenth century and its post-colonial presence in Northern Ireland relate to the patriarchal values of society\\"Michael Patterson, The Oxford Guide to Plays (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2007), p. 84. Churchill shows the audience different views of oppression, both colonial and sexual. She amplifies social constructs by linking the two periods, using an unnatural time gap. Amelia Howe Kritzer argues that \\"Churchill remained close to the Brechtian spirit of encouraging the audience to actively criticize institutions and ideologies they have previously taken for granted\\". There is a great deal of difference between the two acts: Act II contains much more sexual freedom for women, whereas in Act I the men dictate the relationships. Act II \\"focuses on changes in the structure of power and authority, as they affect sex and relationships,\\" from the male-dominated structure in the first act. Churchill writes that she \\"explored Genet's idea that colonial oppression and sexual oppression are similar.\\" She essentially uses the play as a social arena to explore \\"the Victorian origins of contemporary gender definitions and sexual attitudes, recent changes ... and some implications of these changes.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Category:1979 plays Category:Plays by Caryl Churchill Category:West End plays Category:Off-Broadway plays Category:LGBT-related plays ","title":"Cloud 9 (play)"},{"id":"1489464","text":"Action Medical Research, previously The National Fund for Research into Crippling Diseases, is a British medical research charity, founded in 1952, that focusses on funding research to prevent and treat disease and disability in babies and children.GuideStar UK: Action Medical Research (accessed 28 September 2007)Charity Commission: Action Medical Research (Charity 208701) (accessed 28 September 2007) Action Medical Research (Registered Charity No. 208701) is based in Horsham, West Sussex.

History Designed in 1959 and first tested in 1961, the R-9 was a great improvement over previous Soviet missile designs. The missile, capable of delivering a 3,500 lb (1600 kg) payload about 6,000 nautical miles (11,000 km) to an accuracy of 1 nautical mile (2 km), was not only very accurate, but was also far more tactically useful to the Soviet Union. Previous Soviet designs, fuelled with cryogenic LOX and kerosene, commonly took hours to fuel and launch. The R-9, on the other hand, could be launched 20 minutes from the time a launch order was given. NPO \\"Electropribor\\" (Kharkiv, Ukraine) designed the missile's control system.Krivonosov, Khartron: Computers for rocket guidance systems First put into active service in 1964, the R-9 carried a 1.65 to 5 Mt warhead. Though the last Soviet missile to use cryogenic propellant, this design is one of the most widely deployed ICBMs to use cryogenic fuel. OKB-456 (later renamed to NPO Energomash) developed the initial stage of the two-stage missile, a four- chambered closed cycle design. The second stage, connected by trusses to the first stage (much like the modern Soyuz rocket) was also four-chambered, but utilized open combustion chambers more suited to very high altitudes. This rocket engine was a product of the OKB-154 design team. Guidance of the warhead, like most ICBMs before and after it, was totally inertial save the final ten seconds before detonation of the warhead, which was controlled by a radio-altimeter correction system. Deployment The initial design called for a mobile surface-launched system, but a changing cold war situation saw a silo-based R-9 developed in tandem with the ground-based system. The ground- based system, however, never achieved the hoped-for mobility of the initial design parameters. In total, three launch sites were constructed, but only two were used. \\"Desna-V\\", the silo launch area, consisted of three underground silos with the ability to launch the R-9 within 20 minutes, and the ability to store the missile in an unfueled ready condition for one year. \\"Valley\\", the first of two above-ground launch sites, was mostly automated and could fire the R-9 within 20 minutes as well, and repeat the process within two and a half hours. The final launch site, \\"Desna-N\\", was also an above-ground site, but was never stocked with R-9s as the site was not automated and needed at least two hours to launch a single missile. In 1971 the above-ground R-9 launch sites were decommissioned, and by 1976 all R-9 missiles had been decommissioned. NATO reporting name SS-8 Sasin is a NATO reporting name that was mistakenly applied to two different Soviet missile systems. The designation was accidentally applied to the R-26 when an example of that missile was revealed in a parade. However, the R-26 program had already been cancelled and no new designation was given by NATO for the R-26 once the error was discovered. 1963 fire On October 24, 1963, an R-9 missile was being prepared for launch in a silo from Site 70 at Baikonur Cosmodrome. The 11-man launch crew did not realize that an oxygen leak from the missile's fuel system had raised the partial oxygen pressure to 32% (the maximum allowed was 21%). The crew was descending to the eighth level in a lift when a spark from an electrical panel started a fire in the nearly pure oxygen atmosphere, killing seven and destroying the silo. The disaster occurred exactly three years after the Nedelin disaster. October 24 became known as Baikonur's \\"Black Day\\", and to this day no launches are attempted on that date.

It was the first political party in Sri Lanka (Then British Ceylon), having been founded in 1935 by Leslie Goonewardene, N.M. Perera, Colvin R. de Silva, Philip Gunawardena and Robert Gunawardena. It currently is a member of the main ruling coalition in the government of Sri Lanka and is headed by Tissa Vitharana. The party was founded with Marxist-Leninst ideals, and is classified as a party with Socialist aims. The LSSP emerged as a major political force in the Sri Lankan independence movement during the 1940s, during which time the party was forced to go underground due to its opposition to the British war effort. The party played an instrumental role in the Indian independence and later Quit India Movement through the Bolshevik‚ÄìLeninist Party of India, Ceylon and Burma (BLPI). Through its efforts, India gained Independence from Britain in 1947, followed by Sri Lanka in 1948. In the late early 1950s, the LSSP took the lead in organising the Hartal strike, caused by vast food price inflation by the UNP government. At the time, J.R. Jayawardena was the finance minister of the country. Maintaining the price of rice at 25 cents had been an electoral promise given by UNP in the 1952 elections, and when the new rates of 70 cents were introduced to the public there was a massive anger against it. From the late 1940s to 1960s, the Lanka Sama Samaja Party served as the opposition Party in Sri Lanka, whilst being recognised as the Sri Lankan wing of the Fourth International, an organisation characterised by Trotskyism. During this period, the party was able to use its considerable political influence to reform the former British Colony of Ceylon into a socialist republic by nationalising organisations in the banking, education, industry, media and trade sectors. In 1964, the party joined the United Front (Sri Lanka), and formed the Socialist SLFP government, leading to its expulsion from the Fourth International. Through their election landslide in 1964, they brought the world's first non-hereditary female head of government in modern history, Sirimavo Bandaranaike to power as Prime Minister of Sri Lanka. The party peaked in political strength in the 1970s, when it was again leading a coalition government with multiple of its leaders in key cabinet roles. In recent elections, the party has served a role in the coalition government. As of 2020, the party holds local government roles, as well as the governorship of the North Central Province.  Name  The Lanka Sama Samaja Party was the first modern political party in Ceylon, later Sri Lanka. It was noted for its choice to use a native name rather than an English name. The party was the first Marxist party in South Asia. The Sinhala term samasamajaya was one coined by Dally Jayawardena in the Swadesa Mitraya to translate the term 'socialist'. However, the usage of samasamajaya has since been superseded by samajavadaya (which corresponds to similar usage in various Indian languages) in everything but in the names of the LSSP and various of its splinter groups. The Tamil term samadharmam was used to translate 'socialist', but nowadays the English term is used.  History  The Lanka Sama Samaja Party was founded on 18 December 1935, with the broad aims of Sri Lankan Independence and Socialism, by a group of young politicians. The group at the foundation numbered a bare half-dozen, and composed principally of students who had returned from study abroad, influenced deeply by the ideas of Karl Marx and Lenin. The original group consisted of Leslie Goonewardene, N.M. Perera, Colvin R. de Silva, Philip Gunawardena and Robert Gunawardena.Leslie GoonewardeneCharles Wesley Ervin, Tomorrow is Ours:the Trotskyist Movement in India and Ceylon, 1935-48, Colombo: Social Scientists Association, 2006  Origins  The LSSP grew out of the Youth Leagues of Ceylon ‚Äì societies of young people, mainly intellectuals, who wanted independence for the British ruled Sri Lanka ‚Äì in which a nucleus of Marxists had developed. The party's leaders were predominantly educated returnees from study in London; youth who had come into contact with the ideas of the European Left and were influenced by Harold Laski, an English political theorist and professor at the London School of Economics. Dr S.A. Wickremasinghe, an early returnee and a member of the State Council from 1931, was part of this group. The Youth Leagues campaigned for independence from Britain, notably organising opposition to the so-called 'Ministers' Memorandum', one which in essence called for the colonial authorities to grant increased power to local ministers. = Wellawatte Spinning and Weaving Mills Strike = The group, through the South Colombo Youth League, became involved in a strike at the Wellawatte Spinning and Weaving Mills in 1933. The mills; the island‚Äôs largest textile factory at that time with 1,400 workers (two-thirds of Indian origin and one-third Sinhalese), gave the members of the Youth League a chance for leadership as well as experience in trade union agitation. During this period, the collective published an irregular journal in Sinhala, Kamkaruwa (The Worker). = Suriya-Mal movement = In 1933 the group got involved in the Suriya-Mal movement, which had been formed to provide support for indigenous ex- servicemen by the sale of Suriya (Portia tree) flowers. The Suriya-Mal movement surged as a reaction to the fact that at the time Poppy Day funds went solely to British ex-servicemen. The movement was honed by volunteer work among the poor during the Malaria Epidemic of 1934-1935. The volunteers found that there was widespread malnutrition, which they helped fight by making pills of 'Marmite' yeast extract.  Early period  In 1936 the LSSP contested the State Council elections in four constituencies and won two of them, Avissawella and Ruanwella. The two new members, Philip Gunawardena and N.M. Perera, worked at the dismay of the British Colonial government; one that they were trying to dismantle. Around this time, the LSSP began fraternal relations with the Congress Socialist Party (CSP) of India. Mrs Kamaladevi Chattopadhyaya of the CSP was invited by the LSSP for a highly successful political tour of the island. Leslie Goonewardene was also sent as a delegate to the CSP. Despite their move towards Indian relations, the LSSP maintained a clear distance from the Indian radical left, and considered the Communist Party of India to be an extremist force. = Bracegirdle Indicent = In 1937, the British Colonial Governor Sir Reginald Stubbs attempted to deport a young Anglo-Australian planter, Mark Anthony Bracegirdle, who had joined the LSSP. He went into hiding in defiance of the Governor and the LSSP started a campaign to defend him. He appeared on the platform at that year's May Day rally, and was able to have his deportation order quashed in the courts. Through this incident, Stubbs was isolated. The incident led to the further strengthening of an argument for independence as the Bracegirdle incident had brought almost the entire State Council into opposition to the colonial government. Bracegirdle had been working among the plantation labourers, who were often working in squalid conditions, receiving very little health care, education and living in 'line rooms'. In 1940, the Lanka Estate Workers' Union (LEWU) intervened in a strike at Mooloya, becoming the harbinger of a wave of trade-union action on the plantations. = Initial Trotskyist ideals = Meanwhile, in the LSSP a number of members had become influenced by the ideas of the Left Opposition led by Leon Trotsky. Individual party members, notably Philip Gunawardena, had encountered Trotskyist groups earlier during stays in Britain and the USA. The Trotskyists within the LSSP came together and formed a secret faction known as the \\"T\\" (after Trotsky) group. The group's original members were Philip Gunawardena, N. M. Perera, Colvin R. de Silva, Leslie Goonewardene, Robert Gunawardena and Vernon Gunasekera, the Party Secretary. They were later joined by Edmund Samarakkody and V. Karalasingham.  Fourth International  In 1940, the LSSP split with the expulsion of the pro-Moscow fraction led by S. A. Wickremasinghe, M. G. Mendis, Pieter Keuneman and A. Vaidialingam. The expelled members formed the United Socialist Party (USP) which later evolved into the Communist Party of Ceylon (CPC). With the expulsion of the communists, the LSSP planted itself as an independent Trotskyist party. In its heyday, the LSSP was the Fourth International's most successful component. At the outbreak of the Second World War, the party was forced to go underground due to its opposition to the British war effort. The two State Council members of the party and others on its Central committee were arrested and jailed, but Leslie Goonewardene evaded arrest and went underground. = New Programme and adoption of Constitution = On 20 April 1941, a secret conference in Kandy, attended by 42 delegates, was held. Leslie Goonewardene, who was in hiding, attended this conference at which the new programme and constitution were adopted. The cover organisation of the party enabled him to work for a period of one year and three months till he left for India. An openly functioning section of the party was established, led by Robert Gunawardena, S.C.C. Anthonipillai, V. Karalasingham, K.V. Lourenz Perera and William de Silva. The 'open' section of the party led a strike wave in May 1941 and strikes in 1942 and 1944.  Proscription and move to India  Following the Japanese raid on Colombo on 5 April 1942, the imprisoned leaders escaped and fled to India. In India, the proscribed LSSPers merged their party into the Bolshevik-Leninist Party of India, Ceylon and Burma (BLPI). Preparatory work had been done in this connection by Leslie Goonewardene, Doric de Souza and Bernard Soysa. The LSSP thus became the Ceylon section of BLPI. Through the BLPI, the Ceylonese trotskyists attained their formal membership in the Fourth International. The Ceylonese Samasamajists who went to India participated actively along with the BLPI in the struggle for independence that commenced in August 1942 in India. It was generally realised that the impending open revolt against imperialism in India was going to be decisive for the future not only of India but of Ceylon as well. Their property and assets back home were confiscated. Various other members were arrested. Only Colvin R. de Silva, Leslie Goonewardene, Vivienne Goonewardena and Selina Perera succeeded in evading arrest up to the end. Procession in Bangalore. During the war there was a split in the movement. N. M. Perera and Philip Gunawardena opposed a merger into the BLPI and formed the 'Workers' Opposition'. After the war, they reconstructed LSSP as an independent party. Members of the other section, formed out of the exiled BLPI nucleus, effectively maintained a separate party, the Bolshevik Samasamaja Party. The latter group functioned as the Ceylon section of BLPI and was led by Colvin R de Silva, Leslie Goonawardene and Edmund Samarakkoddy. The relation between the two groups was often antagonistic. The BSP accused the LSSP of 'organisational Menshevism'. The LSSP accused the BSP of being introvert doctrinaires. LSSP wanted to build a mass-based party, whereas the BSP concentrated on building a cadre-based (revolutionary) party. On 25 October 1945 fist-fights broke out at between the two groups at a meeting of the BSP.  Main party  The LSSP and the BSP were both at the helm of the strike waves that occurred in the post-war period. In 1946 there was a brief reconciliation between the two factions. At the general election of 1947 the LSSP emerged as the main opposition party, with 10 seats. The BSP obtained 5 seats. They also had the support of the Ceylon Indian Congress (CIC - which later became the Ceylon Workers' Congress) of Natesa Iyer, which had 6 members in Parliament and of various independent members. However, SWRD Bandaranaike and his Sinhala Maha Sabha backed the newly formed United National Party (UNP), which was thus able to form a government under DS Senanayake. The BLPI- affiliated BSP became an independent party in 1948, and was recognised as the Ceylonese section of the Fourth International when the BLPI was dissolved. Independence Square by Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester in the presence of Rt Hon D.S. Senanayake as first Prime Minister of Ceylon.  Success in the Independence Movement  In 1948, the country was granted Dominion status by the British. The armed forces continued to be commanded by British Officers and the Royal Navy and the RAF continued to have bases on the island (at Trincomalee and Katunayake). The Government was heavily pro-British and anti- Soviet. The new government proceeded to disenfranchise plantation workers of Indian Tamils descent, using the Ceylon Citizenship Act of 1948 and the Parliamentary Elections Amendment Act of 1949. These measures were intended primarily to undermine the Left electorally. Of these acts, N. M. Perera said: > 'I thought racialism of this type died with Houston Chamberlain and Adolf > Hitler. I do not believe that anyone claiming to be a Statesman would ask us > to accede to a bill of this nature ... We cannot proceed as if we were God's > chosen race quite apart from the rest of the world; that we and we alone > have the right to be citizens of this country.' = Reunification = The split between the LSSP and the BSP had weakened the movement, and in particular the BSP which was clearly the smaller of the two parties. A process of reunification was initiated, and in 1950 the BSP merged into the LSSP. Through the reunification, the LSSP became the Ceylonese section of the Fourth International. However, Philip Gunawardena opposed the reconciliation with the BSP. Thus he left LSSP and formed a new party, Viplavakari Lanka Sama Samaja Party (VLSSP). At the 1952 general election, the electoral performance was harmed by the relative prosperity due to the price of natural rubber being driven up by the Korean War. Also, the disenfranchisement of the Indian Tamil estate workers by the UNP government deprived the LSSP of one of its main bases. Moreover, it damaged the electoral fortunes of its ally, the CIC, which went unrepresented.  Hartal and after  In 1953, the LSSP took the lead in organising the Hartal. The immediate cause for the Hartal was a hike in the price of rice from 25 cent to 70 cent per measure by the UNP government. At the time, J.R. Jayawardena was the finance minister of the country. Maintaining the price of rice at 25 cent had been an electoral promise given by UNP in the 1952 elections, and when the new rates were introduced to the public, uproar ensued. This anger was furthered by the suspension of the meals given to schoolchildren and hikes in rail ticket fares and postal fees. Prior to 1953, the concept of a 'Hartal', of General strike, was relatively unknown in Ceylon. Through their exile, the LSSP leaders had witnessed the immense impact of the hartals during the Quit India Movement, ensuring that this knowledge was brought with them. The Communist Party and VLSSP supported the Hartal and the SLFP and CIC expressed sympathy for the demand of the Hartal, but did not actively support the call for strike. The Ceylon Mercantile Union supported the demands of the strike, but in not take part in it. Rather it encouraged their members to go to work wearing black armbands as a means to protest. The Hartal took the country to a complete standstill. Afraid of a revolution in the making, the government cabinet sought refuge on , a Royal Navy warship offshore. The mass upsurge that accompanied the action of the strikers caused Dudley Senanayake to resign from the premiership. The Hartal emoboldended the LSSP to start to consider that the party might be able to seize state power. In 1956 the LSSP went into a no-contest pact with the Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (People's United Front) of SWRD Bandaranaike, which he had formed with Philip Gunawardena and the VLSSP. The MEP won a landslide in the polls held that year. The LSSP once again became the main opposition party, and N. M. Perera became the Leader of Opposition. Through this, the LSSP supported the reforms initiated by the new government, but strongly opposed the 'Sinhala Only' policy. In July 1959, both LSSP and the Communist Party withdrew their support for the government, as inner-party feuds within the SLFP had resulted in a temporary victory for the right-wing and expulsions of leftist ministers like Philip Gunawardena. In March 1960, the LSSP contested the general elections on the slogan 'forward to a Sama Samaja Government'. The votes won by the LSSP, the Communists and the Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (a new party, not the 1956 front) of Philip Gunawardena, were sufficient to have made them the biggest bloc in Parliament. However, due to their contesting separately, the LSSP and the MEP won just 10 seats each, the CP a mere 3. Elections were held again in July and the LSSP had a no-contest pact with the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) of Sirimavo Bandaranaike, which was thus able to form a government. The Fourth International was highly critical of the electoral tactics of LSSP, and the LSSP chose not to attend the World Congress of International the following year. In 1962, officers of the Army and Police attempted a coup d'√©tat aimed at overthrowing the government and bringing the UNP to power. This plot was foiled, and the SLFP lurched leftwards in terms of policy. The local branches of petroleum companies were nationalised, leading to a boycott of the country by the oil multi-nationals; the boycott was broken with help from the Kansas Oil Producers Co-operative and the Romanian Government. A parallel process was one of increasing self-confidence and unity amongst the Ceylonese left-wing. In the parliament they were in the opposition. On May Day 1963 the three main left parties (LSSP, CP and MEP) held a massive joint rally. That was followed by the launching of United Front on 12 August, the tenth anniversary of the 1953 Hartal. The front launched agitations on issues like bring down the prices of essential commodities, leading it to represent an immediate threat to the governance of SLFP. The SLFP began to offer the left parties ministerial posts and worked intensively to break the unity of ULF.  Trade union activities  The 1950s and 1960s were in many ways the \\"Golden era\\" of LSSP. At the time, the most powerful trade unions in the country supported LSSP politics. The most prominent trade union in the public sector in this period was the Government Clerical Service Union, which gave the a great support to the political struggle of LSSP. The forefront leader of GCSU, I. J. Wickrema, openly appealed for support to the LSSP-CP coalition in order to defeat imperialism. The GCSU publication Red Tape constantly criticised the UNP government and asked the people to support the left.  Coalition politics  In 1964, the LSSP held a conference at which the majority agreed with a theoretical categorisation of the SLFP by Hector Abhayavardhana as a petty bourgeois party, leaving the door open to a united front with it. A minority faction, led by Colvin R de Silva and Leslie Goonewardene, opposed the move but opted to stay within the Party. Another minority faction led by Edmund Samarakkody, Merryl Fernando, V Karalasingham and Bala Tampoe, left the party and formed the Lanka Sama Samaja Party (Revolutionary) - the LSSP(R). Later that year, the LSSP joined the coalition government of Sirimavo Bandaranaike. Three of its MPs became Ministers; Dr N. M. Perera (Finance), Cholomondely Goonewardena (Public Works) and Anil Moonesinghe (Communications). The LSSP was expelled from the Fourth International, and the membership was passed on to the LSSP(R). The Coalition Government fell in 1965, due to the desertion of several members. However, the number of votes won by the LSSP increased at the general election held that year. After the election, supporters of the party were subject to a co-ordinated campaign of victimisation by the new seven-party coalition led by the UNP. In 1968, the LSSP joined the SLFP and the CP in a United Front; one that suffered clashes due to the Moscow-oriented focus of the CP. That year's joint May Day rally was said to be the biggest ever to take place in Sri Lanka. In 1970, the United Front, of which the LSSP was part, was elected to power in landslide. The LSSP had 19 MPs in the House of Representatives. Dr NM Perera, Dr Colvin R de Silva and Leslie Goonewardene became Ministers of Finance, Constitutional Affairs with Plantation Industries and Transport and Communication, respectively. The Party was able to advance parts of its programme considerably: Foreign-owned plantations were nationalised, local ownership was restricted, democratically elected workers' councils were established in state corporations and government departments under the purview of its ministries, and measures were taken that narrowed the gap between the rich and poor. Several LSSP members were appointed to important posts in which they could press forward the party programme: Anil Moonesinghe became Chairman of the Ceylon Transport Board and theoretician Hector Abhayavardhana was made Chairman of the People's Bank and Doric de Souza was appointed permanent secretary to the Ministry of Plantations. Dr Seneka Bibile, a member of the LSSP, became the founder Chairperson of the State Pharmaceuticals Corporation (SPC) - which distributed drugs at affordable rates, by generic name instead of by trade name. The SPC, which became a model for the Third World and remains so today, was based on a report on Pharmaceuticals in Sri Lanka of which the authors were Dr S. A. Wickremesinghe and Seneka Bibile. The Congress of Samasamaja Youth Leagues and the other bodies affiliated to the party (membership of the party proper was still restricted to a small cadre, on a Leninist model) saw unprecedented growth at this time. The leadership looked to Salvador Allende's Chile as a model of revolution through parliamentary means. Leslie Goonewardene, easily the most cosmopolitan of the party's leaders, established contact with the 'Captains' of the Movement of the Armed Forces ('Movimento das For√ßas Armadas' - MFA) of Portugal, after the Carnation Revolution of April 1974; he also became a theoretician of Eurocommunism and its application to Sri Lanka, writing a pamphlet 'Can we Get To Socialism This Way'. In 1975, the United Front broke up with the expulsion of the LSSP ministers. The party then pursued a line of forming a new socialist alliance, the Socialist United Front (SUF). This was finally formed in 1977 with the CPSL and with the People's Democratic Party (PDP), made up of leftist elements from the SLFP led by Nanda Ellawala.  Electoral Struggle (1977)  In 1977, the LSSP and CP lost all their Parliamentary seats, and the Left was unrepresented - something that had not happened in the 46 years since the introduction of universal suffrage. The party and its allies received over 8% of the vote, but this was not sufficient to win any seats under the first- past-the-post system then in place in Sri Lanka. The same year the LSSP suffered another split, as a group led by the youth leader Vasudeva Nanayakkara broke away and formed the Nava Sama Samaja Party (NSSP). This was compounded by the death of N. M. Perera in 1979. His funeral was one of the largest ever seen in Colombo. = The end of the LSSP trade union movement = In 1980, an even worse catastrophe occurred. The UNP Government provoked a strike in the Railway Department. The strike became a general strike. The government cracked down on the trade unions, jailing many labour leaders, including Anil Moonesinghe and G.E.H. Perera of the Government Workers' Trade Union Federation. The strike was crushed and with it the LSSP trade union movement. = Further splits = In 1982 the LSSP split over the question of a coalition with the SLFP. Anil Moonesinghe, Cholomondely Goonewardena, G. E. H. Perera, Wilfred Senanayake and others formed the Sri Lanka Sama Samaja Party (SLSSP), which dissolved the next year and merged with the SLFP. Moonesinghe charged that the LSSP had been taken over by the BSP faction. Scuffles broke out between the LSSP and the SLSSP at the joint May Day procession that year. At the Presidential election held that year, the LSSP put forward Dr Colvin R de Silva as its candidate, the SLSSP backed Hector Kobbekaduwa of the SLFP. Dr Colvin R de Silva was beaten into 5th place. Following the signing of the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord in 1987, the party was at the receiving end of the terror campaign.  1994 and after  The LSSP joined the People's Alliance, the front led by the Sri Lanka Freedom Party in 1994. It had three members elected to Parliament that year. Bernard Soysa was Minister of Science and Technology. In 1999, Vasudeva Nanayakkara was expelled after having publicly criticized the People's Alliance government. Nanayakkara had joined LSSP from the NSSP in 1994 and had been elected MP for Ratnapura. After his expulsion, Nanayakkara floated the Democratic Left Front. When the SLFP shelved the PA and formed the United People's Freedom Alliance together with Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna ahead of the 2004 elections, the CPSL and LSSP initially stayed out. They did however, sign a memorandum with the UPFA at a later stage and contested the elections on the UPFA platform. LSSP won one parliamentary seat. Its lone MP, Tissa Vitharana, was named Minister of Science and Technology. The LSSP has gradually decreased in strength. The Congress of Samasamaja Youth Leagues has been disbanded. The party celebrated its 70th anniversary in December 2005, with a well-attended rally in Colombo. On December 4, 2019, Tissa Vitharana was appointed as Governor for the North Central Province, Sri Lanka, being sworn in before President Gotabaya Rajapaksa.  Organisational model  LSSP's main office, situated in Colombo The LSSP operated as a cadre party on the Leninist model. In order to become a member one had first to be active in the peripheral organisations such as the trade unions, women's organisations and youth leagues. Thereafter it was necessary to serve several months' apprenticeship as a candidate member before being elevated to full membership with voting rights. The basic unit of the Party is the Local, consisting of only full- and candidate-members. Locals also exist inside trade unions. Internally, the LSSP uses democratic process. The supreme body is the conference, which is summoned every few years. The conference decides on policy and elects a Central Committee (CC) to preside over its implementation. The CC appoints members to bureaux to look after specific area, such as the Educational Bureau (EB), Organisational Bureau (Orgburo) and Trade Union Bureau (TUB); The Political Bureau (Politburo) is appointed to deal with day-to-day political matters and effectively provides leadership. The CC also appoints an Editorial Board for running the Samasamajaya newspaper. The Party also has regional groupings, which have conferences and appoint office bearers for the Regional Committees (RCs). Internationally, there was just one Local, the London Branch. This was also known as the Lanka Socialist League, and was anchored around Wesley Muthiah.  General Secretary  There is strictly no General Secretary, but a Secretary to the Central Committee, assisted by a Deputy and an Assistant. Secretaries have been: * Vernon Gunasekera * Leslie Goonewardene * Bernard Soysa * Batty Weerakoon * Wimalasiri de Mel  Electoral results  In recent elections, LSSP has contested on the lists of the People's Alliance and, in 2004, on the lists of the United People's Freedom Alliance.  Leaders and important members  :See List of Members of the Lanka Sama Samaja Party. The LSSP has never had a formal leader. In the period immediately after its formation, Dr Colvin R de Silva was elected President, but the post was later removed. For many years, N. M. Perera was the leader of the LSSP Parliamentary Group and was recognised by the public as the party leader. However, the actual leadership has always been that of a group represented in the various bureaux of the Central Committee. A large proportion of the leadership of the Left in Sri Lanka started their political lives in the LSSP. This is even true of the political right; for example, Esmond Wickremasinghe (the father of Ranil Wickremasinghe) was a leading member of the party - before marrying the daughter of the wealthy press baron D. R Wijewardena and being appointed editor-in-chief of Lake House. W. Dahanayake, the later prime minister, was associated with the LSSP before gravitating right-wards (finally ending up in the UNP). Tissa Abeysekara was at one time tipped to parliament on the National list, however on two occasions he was holding public office (Chairman National Film Corporation) and therefore turned down, but remained an integral member of the party.  Publications  The LSSP's main organ has always been the Samasamajaya newspaper. Its founder-editor was B. J. Fernando, who composed the Sinhala version of the Internationale. Today, its publication is somewhat irregular. For many years it was supplemented by the Tamil Samadharmam which was commenced in 1938. Its first editor was K. Ramanathan, later succeeded by T. E. Pushparajan. In the period of underground struggle, the Kamkaruwa, was revived as a legal Sinhalese weekly the 'open' section of the Party and published until banned by Admiral Sir Geoffrey Layton. The 'open' section also brought out Straight Left in English. In 1960 a special magazine was brought out to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the foundation of the LSSP, Visi Pas Vasrak. The large number of members of the Ceylon Mercantile Union (CMU) who had been sacked from Lake House that year collaborated in its production. In 1965, in response to the need for a broad- left popular newspaper to counteract Lake House's Dinamina, the LSSP and members of the SLFP began the Janadina daily and the Janasathiya weekly newspaper, later supplemented by the poetry periodical Janakavi. The CMU members sacked from Lake House were prominent in these publications as well. A similar task was carried out in English by The Nation; however, when this weekly was taken over by the SLFP, the LSSP started the Socialist Nation, edited by Hector Abhayavardhana. A press, the 'Star Press', was begun as a semi-commercial venture, to print the LSSP's publications and still operates. In 1975 a theoretical journal, Rajaya was published, edited by a board led by Osmund Jayaratne. This and its English version State, were suspended after a few issues.

The missile was accepted into service on 24 April 1961; initial operational capability for the first division of four launchers was achieved on 31 December 1961, with the first regiment organized the next day. By the end of 1962 two regiments were fully operational in the Ukraine and Latvia, with later surface launch pad sites in Kaliningrad and Belarus. A regiment consisted of two divisions, with eight launchers total; by the 1970s one mobile regiment consisted of 3 control units and 4-5 launchers. Upon introduction, the primary targets of R-14s were Thor missile sites in Britain, Jupiter missile sites in Italy and Turkey, and Polaris missile submarine bases in Spain. Production of the missile was initially done at Factory 586 in Dnepropetrovsk and Factory 1001 in Krasnoyarsk, with the RD-216 engine built only at Factory 586. From 1962 onward, production was shifted exclusively to Aviation Factory 166 in Omsk. Prior to the onset of the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, the Soviet Union planned to deploy two regiments with 32 R-14 IRBMs and 16 launchers to Cuba. By the time the United States declared a quarantine of the island, 24 one-megaton warheads had arrived but no missiles or launchers had yet been shipped. The warheads were removed and the deployment of the R-14 to Cuba was cancelled after the crisis was resolved. In May 1960, development of the R-14U (universal) version, which could be launched from both surface pads or 'Chusovaya' complex missile silos, was authorized and test launches began in January 1962. In the silo-launched version, each regiment consisted of two divisions, each division being a single emplacement with a hardened command and control technical point and three silos. The silos were placed at least 100 m from the other about the technical point. Each silo was 30 m deep and hardened to withstand overpressures of . The silo design was accepted for service in June 1963, and the first R-14U silo division became operational at Priekule, Latvia in 1964. Complexes were also built in the Russian Far East, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, and Lithuania.R-14U. Encyclopedia Astronautica. Deployment of the R-14 and R-14U reached its peak from 1964-1969 with 97 launchers. Reaction time in the normal readiness condition is 1-3 hours for soft sites and 5-15 minutes for hard sites. Readiness states for reaction times of 3-5 minutes could be held for several hours at soft sites and several days at hard sites. Phasing out of hard sites began in 1971 and R-14Us (in mixed deployment with mobile launchers) was retired in the late 1970s. Some soft site phase-outs began in 1969, and the missile was gradually replaced by the RSD-10 Pioneer between 1978 and 1983, being completely withdrawn from service in 1984. Following the signing of the Intermediate- Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, the remaining six R-14 missiles in storage were scrapped on 9 August 1989. Derivatives The missile was the basis of the Kosmos-3 launch vehicle family. In 1964, the R-14 was equipped with a smaller second stage to create the 65S3 booster and eight were flown over the next year from LC-41 at Baikonur. By 1966, the fully operational 11K65 booster was in use, but it was flown only four times before being succeeded by the definitive 11K65M launcher, used for assorted light civilian and military satellites, most being launched from Plesetsk (only some of them were flown from Kapustin Yar). This launch vehicle was retired from service in 2010.

It is situated in Helsinki, on the north side of Esplanadi, overlooking Market Square. Origins and early history At the beginning of the 19th century, a salt storehouse stood on the site. , then one of the elite of Helsinki's merchants, purchased the entire lot and erected between 1816‚Äì1820 a stately residence designed by architect . The Heidenstrauch House resembled a palace more than a merchant's house. In 1837 it actually became a palace when it was purchased for the price of 170 000 rubles to be converted into a residence for the Governor-General of Finland. However, Nicholas I desired that it should become the official residence in Helsinki of the Emperor of Russia, the Grand Duke of Finland, and so the building became the Imperial Palace in Helsinki. The necessary rebuilding and furnishing work, carried out between 1843 and 1845, was directed by architect Carl Ludvig Engel, the creator of neoclassical Helsinki and, after his death, by his son, Carl Alexander. Giacomo Quarenghi also looked over the plans. All the timber storehouses behind were torn down and a new wing added. This wing, built along the north of the courtyard, contained on the second floor the chapel (the present library), ballroom, banquet hall in direct connection with the earlier reception floor of the main building, as well as a kitchen. Imperial Palace Swans swimming in front of the building The palace was completed in 1845, though repairs had to be made from time to time as mostly it stood empty and was not regularly heated. It was visited for the first time by a member of the Imperial family nine years later, in February 1854, when Emperor Nicholas I's younger son, Grand Duke Constantine, stayed there for a month. His brother Nicholas stayed there in June of the following year, after Nicholas I's death. In 1856, the palace was also visited by the new Emperor's three oldest sons ‚Äì Nicholas, Alexander, and Vladimir. It was during the reign of their father, Alexander II, that the Palace had its most brilliant time. He visited the city in 1863 and 1876, staying on both occasions at the Palace. In 1863 the Diet of Finland was opened by Alexander II in the Great Ballroom. The Ballroom was accordingly converted into a Throne-Room, with the Imperial throne placed on a dais. Alexander returned to the palace again in 1876 to open that year's session of the Diet. The Throne-Room continued to be used as the venue for the opening and closing ceremonies of the Diet until 1906. That was the last Imperial festivity in the palace. Alexander III did stay there in 1885 (although he resided at his Finnish residence in Langinkoski more often). The palace was refurbished during 1904‚Äì1907 by Johan Jacob Ahrenberg. He built a new suite of reception rooms, including a new Throne Room (the present Hall of State) where the sculpture Psyche and Zephyr by Walter Runeberg was placed, and a reception vestibule facing Mariankatu. The palace was last visited by a member of the Imperial family when Nicholas II visited the palace for one day in 1915. Post-imperial use Mounted police officers patrolling the premises Under the political conditions of World War I the palace was converted into Helsinki Temporary Military Hospital I in October 1915. With the February Revolution of 1917 and the abdication of the Emperor/Grand Duke, the palace ceased to be a military hospital and became the property of the Senate which renamed it as the Former Imperial Palace. From March to April 1918, the palace was used as the headquarters of the Executive Committee of the Helsinki Workers and Soldiers Soviet. With the victory of the Whites in the Finnish Civil War, the Reds abandoned the Palace, which was temporarily used by German and White Finnish military staff. From June 1918 onwards, renovations and repairs were made to the palace in anticipation of its role as a royal residence for Prince Frederick of Hesse, who was elected as King of Finland in October 1918. However, the international political situation in the aftermath of World War I led to him renouncing his acceptance of the Finnish throne in December 1918. Following this, the upper floors served as the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. Presidential Palace and office After the new Constitution was passed in 1919 it was clear that the most suitable residence for the President was the Former Imperial Palace. Complete repairs were made at speed, with the furnishings and art collections of the Palace being returned from storage in the National Museum and the Ateneum Art Museum, and also being supplemented. Since then, it served as the official residence of the President. The Palace was again refurbished and modernised by Martti V√§likangas in 1938. The Presidential Palace served as the official residence of all the Presidents of Finland up to 1993, except for Presidents Ryti, Mannerheim, and Kekkonen, who preferred to reside at Tamminiemi. The Palace ceased to be used as the President's principal official residence during the presidency of Urho Kekkonen. He and his wife disliked the noise of nearby traffic and the lack of gardens, and soon moved to Tamminiemi, which remained Kekkonen's residence until his death. However, the palace again served as the principal residence of the President during the presidency of Mauno Koivisto, until the new residence, M√§ntyniemi, was completed. The Palace contains private apartments and reception rooms for the President on its third floor, including the Yellow Room, the Red Waiting Room, and the President's Study. The Palace also contains the Office of the President, which includes offices for the Secretary General, the Special Counsel to the President, and the Master of the Household. The Palace's State rooms include the Hall of State, the Dining Hall, and the Hall of Mirrors (the small Hall of State). They are used by the President for official functions and receptions. These include the promotion and appointment ceremony for Defence Forces and Frontier Guard cadets, State Banquets, and the Independence Day reception. The latest major renovations to the palace were done in 2012‚Äì2014 when the building services engineering was brought up to date for a cost of 45 million euros. Visitors President Tarja Halonen meeting Russian president Vladimir Putin in 2001, with Walter Runeberg's Law behind them Foreign minister Timo Soini meeting with United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in 2018 In its role as the official residence of the President of Finland, the Presidential Palace has hosted a number of important foreign visitors and dignitaries. Royal visitors to the palace have included Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden, Olav V of Norway, Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom, Juan Carlos I of Spain, the Mohammad Reza Pahlavi of Iran, and Emperor Akihito of Japan. A number of US Presidents have visited the palace, including Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, and George H. W. Bush. Other distinguished visitors have included Pope John Paul II, Josip Broz Tito, Nikita Khrushchev, Boris Yeltsin, Horst K√∂hler, Xi Jinping, Shinz≈ç Abe, and Vladimir Putin. President Donald Trump of the United States visited the palace for the 2018 USA-Russia summit with Putin on July 16th, 2018. Visiting guests do not stay at the Presidential Palace nowadays, although they did in the past. Although the palace has nearly 3 000 square metres of floor space, and private apartments for the President and their family, much of the palace is occupied by offices and accommodation for the Office of the President, including the Secretary General, Presidential Cabinet, military Aides-de-Camp, and the household staff. Foreign guests can be housed at M√§ntyniemi, the K√∂nigstedt Manor in Vantaa, or the next to the Hilton Helsinki Kalastajatorppa Hotel in Munkkiniemi.

It is named after George Washington, first President of the United States. Until it partially collapsed in January 2005, the Washington tree was the second largest tree in the world (after the General Sherman tree). Before damage The tree was studied in 1999 by scientists from Humboldt State University and University of Washington. The tree was tall, with a basal diameter of . Its total volume was , including the main stem and the 46 largest branches . The scientists discovered a large cavity in the trunk of the tree, measuring in height by in diameter. The cavity was accessible only by a hole situated above the ground. The significance of this finding is that the volume of wood in the tree had been greatly overestimated by previous measurements. Damage and collapse After the storm (February 2005) In September 2003, a fire caused by a lightning strike damaged the tree's crown. National Park Service officials decided to let the fire burn without human intervention. The tree lost a large portion of its crown in the fire, reducing its height to about . The structurally weakened tree partially collapsed in January 2005, as the result of a heavy snow load in the remaining portion of its crown. The tree lost more than half its height, most of its branches, and much of the trunk, including the entire hollow upper portion of the trunk. It is now high, with only a few branches living near the top of the tree. The Washington tree is no longer one of the top ten largest giant sequoias, though the National Park Service still lists it as the second largest, due to current documentation policy (trees are calculated as if they did not suffer damage). Even in its damaged state, the tree may not be dying, as it still has half a dozen significant branches. Many other sequoias have survived with less foliage, and the tree might live decades or centuries longer.

The missile and its variants also had the names K-37, izdeliye 610 and R-VD (–†–∞–∫–µ—Ç–∞ –í—ã—Å–æ–∫–æ–π –î–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ (Raketa-Vysokoy Dalnosty), \\"Very Long Range Missile\\"), and the NATO codenames 'Axehead' and 'Andi'. It was developed from the R-33. It was designed to shoot down tankers, AWACS and other C4ISTAR aircraft whilst keeping the launch platform out of range of any fighters that might be protecting the target. History The missile was designed in the early 1980s and first flown in 1989. Testing of the R-37 continued through the 1990s, and in 1994, a trial round scored a kill at a range of . However, the program appears to have been dropped around 1998 on grounds of cost. Work on the missile appears to have restarted in late 2006, as part of the MiG-31BM program to update the Foxhound with a new radar and ground attack capability. In 2018, the R-37M had finished its operational validation tests.https://www.vpk-news.ru/articles/52503 Production The R-37 is now in production to equip upgraded Russian MiG-31BM interceptors. Despite the early intent to integrate the weapon on the Flanker family, this has yet to be reported. Design The R-37 was developed from the R-33. For compatibility with aircraft that did not have the MiG-31's sophisticated radar, the semi- active seeker was replaced with a variant of the Agat 9B-1388 active seeker; mid-body strakes enhance lift and hence range, and folding tail controls allow semi-conformal carriage on planes that are not as big as the MiG-31. According to Defence Today, the range depends on the flight profile, from for a direct shot to for a cruise glide profile. According to Jane's there are two variants, the R-37 and the R-37M; the latter has a jettisonable rocket booster that increases the range to \\"300-400km\\" (160-220 nm). The R-37M designation has since been used for a modernized variant of the missile, also known as RVV-BD (Raketa Vozduh-Vozduh Bolyshoy Dalnosty, English for Long-Range Air-to- Air Missile). R-37M is hypersonic and has range exceeding 300km. It will be carried by the modernized MiG-31BM interceptors and Su-35S and Su-57 multirole fighters. It is not known if the long range air-to-air missile for the Su-57, designated as Izdeliye 810, is a derivative of the R-37M. The missile can attack targets ranging in altitude between 15‚Äì25,000 meters. Missiles can be guided semi-actively or actively through Agat 9B-1388 system.

The original store was established in 1862 in Croydon by Joshua Allder. In the second half of the 20th century, this parent store was developed into a chain of department stores across England and Wales. By the turn of the millennium, the flagship store in Croydon was the third-largest department store in the United Kingdom. The chain was broken up and sold after it went into administration in 2005, although the Croydon store continued trading until 2012, having been purchased by Harold Tillman, the then-owner of the Jaeger clothing company. On 17 January 2013, the company closed the store along with the website, and the brand ceased to exist. Joshua Allder Allders was opened in 1862 at 102 and 103 North End, Croydon, as a \\"linen draper and silk mercer\\" by Joshua Allder (1838‚Äì1904) from Walworth, who had served his apprenticeship in Croydon. His shop was diverse, with special offers on silk dresses and also a morning dress section, and departments offering lower-cost items such as buttons and ribbons. This diversity showed a shrewdness in business and an understanding of his mostly female customers. Croydon was a growing town, and Allder's business grew with it. In 1870, the shop expanded into 104, 106 and 107 North End, although he had to wait for some 20 years to acquire 105, a bakery. The wealth Allder made allowed him to play a prominent part in the local community, on the Local Board of Health, on the council of the County Borough of Croydon for nine years, and in the non-conformist church community. He supported greater rights for his workers, being instrumental in getting local stores closed for a half-day on Wednesdays. Allder died in 1904 leaving a store which had expanded beyond clothing and haberdashery to sell glass and porcelain, among other items. His main residence in Pampisford Road, South Croydon, now houses Regina Coeli RC school, and two cul-de-sacs nearby are named Allder Way and Joshua Close. Growth In 1908 Allder's family sold the business to J. W. Holdron and F. C. Bearman, owners of stores in Peckham and Leytonstone respectively. They developed the store into 50 departments with 500 staff and owned the business until 1921. It then passed to the Lawrence family, under whose control it became a limited company. In 1926, the famous North End facade was erected, uniting the frontage of the Croydon premises for the first time. In 1932 an Arcade from North End to George Street was completed, proving a very popular addition to the store. An extension to the restaurant was opened in the same year. The building suffered considerable damage in World War II but never closed. Improvements during the 1950s included the takeover of a cinema auditorium as the gift department and the installation of Croydon's first escalators, built by J & E Hall, in 1954. By 1958, the Lawrence family was forced to sell as a result of death duties incurred after the death of Daniel Arthur Lawrence, managing director. The store was acquired by Jack & Bernard Lyons' United Drapery Stores (UDS), owners of Richard Shops, John Collier, Alexandre Tailors and several department stores. The son of D. A. Lawrence, S. John Lawrence, was kept on by UDS as Managing Director. Allders continued to expand, reaching ¬£1 million turnover in 1958 and ¬£3 million by 1963. Fashion's importance declined, with household items taking a greater role. In the 1960s there was considerable change in Croydon, particularly the construction of the Whitgift Centre to the north of Allders, into which the store expanded, and the creation of the St George's Walk development. Transport and lifestyle changes led to greater competition with the West End and further improvements were required to modernise the store. The section fronting George Street was rebuilt and expanded, retaining a Victorian facade, alongside a new addition. Rebuilding works continued into Dingwall Avenue and by 1976 Allders had 1,700 staff and 500,000 square feet (46,000 m¬≤) of floor space. It was a Croydon landmark and became the third-largest department store in the UK, after Harrods and Selfridges. It had the largest carpet department in Europe, amongst other claims. Croydon was by this time a major retail centre. Allders' immediate competitor, Kennards, was renamed Debenhams in 1973, along with many other Debenhams stores. To compete with the central buying and advertising of Debenhams and other larger groups, the department stores owned by UDS were all gradually renamed Allders. This process began with Shinners of Sutton in 1979 and later Hinds of Eltham, Medhursts of Bromley, James Page of Camberley, Mackross of Cardiff, Willis Ludlow of Hull and Landport Drapery Bazaar (LDB) in Portsmouth. Only Arding & Hobbs at Clapham Junction in London and the furnishing store of Clover at Kirkstall in Leeds retained their original identities. A new geometric logo of ten orange 'A's arranged in a circle on brown and cream-coloured stationery, bags and carpets appeared across the group, together with the phrase \\"All that a great store should be\\". Allders in 1983 In 1983 the Lyons family sold the UDS Group to Hanson plc and Allders became a flagship company of the group, with Lord Hanson appearing on Allders' roof in TV adverts. Allders expanded with new stores opening in Basildon and Chatham and in many international airports as duty-free concessions. A new 'Fourth Floor' was built on the roof of the Croydon store to house a new Audio and Television Department and two new restaurants as well as a link into the staff areas of London House on Dingwall Avenue. The group's brown, cream and orange livery was replaced with a scheme of light blue and gold lettering on a dark blue background. In 1989 a management buyout saw the international arm spun off as a separate company. There was continued upheaval in Croydon with the complete refurbishment of the Whitgift Centre and of parts of the store. The vast carpet department was contracted to a secondary location allowing for the creation of a new perfumery and cosmetics hall at the centre of the ground floor. A new Allders store of opened at Woking in 1992. Allders plc was floated on the stock market in 1993. The growth of the group rapidly accelerated following stock market flotation with the acquisition of existing stores and the building of new ones. This began with the acquisition of Nottingham Co-op's lease on their Broad Marsh Centre store and the development of a chain of stand-alone home furnishing stores. The opening of a second Clover store at Rotherham was succeeded by the development of \\"At Home with Allders\\" a concept for new stores in out-of-town retail parks, the first of which opened at Aylesford in Kent in 1994. The Clover stores were both rebranded. In September 1996 Allders purchased a number of department stores from the Owen Owen group that traded under the Lewis's and Owen Owen names. This included branches in Basingstoke, Coventry, Ilford, Leeds, Oxford, Redditch and Slough. In 1997 Allders acquired the bankrupt Maples furniture brand and seven of its retail outlets. These stores were integrated into the Allders At Home portfolio and brought the brand to town centre locations in Bromley, Chelmsford, Crawley, Kingston upon Thames, Reading, Sutton Coldfield and Watford. The Bromley outlet, in direct competition with the town's main Allders store, was soon disposed of. The Kingston store, offering a range focussed solely on furniture, beds and carpets, struggled to compete with Bentalls and John Lewis. This competition in the town and the frontage of the store being obscured for some time whilst work on the Kingston Bridge was carried out led to the store's closure within two years. A second Kingston store was later opened in the former C & A building, offering a broader range of merchandise for the home. Decline North End and Allders in 2005 Shares in Allders crashed in 1998 after disappointing sales and difficulties integrating the Maples furniture group. Nevertheless, it continued a policy of expansion, acquiring the premises of the former C & A stores at Guildford, Kingston upon Thames, Leicester, Sheffield (Meadowhall), and York in 2000 and later the large C & A building on the south side of Oxford Street in London. The \\"At Home with Allders\\" trading name was replaced with \\"Allders At Home\\" on conversion of a number of the C&A; stores to an expanded home format. Problems continued, however. In Croydon, there were plans to build a new shopping centre, Park Place, on the store's site and much of the area to the south. A new Allders would be built opposite the Town Hall. Croydon Council's partner in this plan was developer Minerva plc. In late 2002 Minerva was part of a new group called Scarlett Retail, named after Terry Green's daughter, that bid for Allders, with Lehman Brothers investment bank and a management team including Terry Green, the former chief executive of Debenhams and BHS. Some felt at the time that Scarlett's bid was based on Minerva's intention to acquire Allders' site for its Park Place project, in order to sell the plot to another retailer, probably John Lewis. The bid was felt by many to be overpriced. Nevertheless, Scarlett paid Tom Hunter an improved price and they landed the company in early 2003 for about ¬£162m ($316m). Green became chief executive and set about an overhaul of Allders' image. It was claimed that some of the traditional homeware, haberdashery and clothing for middle-aged, middle-income women was reduced, with a new emphasis on young fashion and beauty products, though this was denied by Terry Green. Administration, 2004‚Äì2005 In September 2004, Minerva announced that Allders had made a loss of ¬£22.6m for the year to 30 June 2004,Allders store chain up for sale BBC News, 8 December 2004 blaming the speed of the transformation of the business. In December 2004, it announced the business was up for sale. There was some early interest that Primark was to purchase some of the storesAllders news My Fashion United but no interest was found in taking on the company as a whole and it was placed in administration on 26 January 2005. It was revealed that there was a pensions deficit of ¬£15 million. 130 of the staff at the Croydon headquarters were laid off, including Green and other senior managers. An under- construction store at the Drake Circus Shopping Centre in Plymouth was never opened and was split into stores for Next and Primark when the centre opened in October 2005. Kroll, the administrators, searched for buyers for the chain or individual stores. Of Allders' 50 stores, only 35 received offers, with rival retailers such as House of Fraser, BHS, Debenhams and Primark said to have expressed an interest. The ten remaining stores, including the Oxford Street branch, began closing-down sales on 5 February and had started to close from March 2005: all had closed by May 2005 with the Leeds store being the last to close down on 22 May 2005, with the exception of Croydon.Allders store closing its doors BBC News, 22 May 2005 Croydon store, 2005‚Äì2013 In May 2005 it was announced that the owners of Jaeger would take on the flagship Croydon store and that it would continue to trade as Allders. In the first year of operation the new Managing Director, Andrew MacKenzie, turned the fortunes of the company around and projected a ¬£1 million gross profit. Significant investment was made to attract back to the store its Croydon audience. It was the only Allders store to survive the 2005 administration. In April 2006 it was announced that Allders had secured an extension to their lease through to 2008. The land and store that Allders leased had regular break clauses to the benefit of the \\"virtual freehold leaseholder\\" held by Minerva plc subsidiary companies for 250 years. The freehold interest was held by the Whitgift Foundation. Development plans by Minerva for a 1.08 million sq.ft shopping centre were complicated by uncertainty over its tenancy, and competition from the new 1.615 million sq.ft Westfield development at White City, and the shopping development at Bluewater to the east of London. In December 2011, Allders director Max Menon was named as new chairman of Croydon Business Improvement District.Croydon BID appoints new chairman Croydon Business Improvement District, 1 December 2011 Allders of Croydon was placed into administration on 15 June 2012.

It was reported in Scotland on Sunday that Metis, a Glasgow-based intellectual property firm were looking to sell brands that were owned by Allders.

It was a twin-engined, low-wing monoplane that first flew in 1935. It was the precursor of the Ilyushin Il-4 (originally designated DB-3F). 1,528 were built. Design and development The genesis of the DB-3 lay in the BB-2, Sergey Ilyushin's failed competitor to the Tupolev SB. Ilyushin was able to salvage the work and time invested in the BB-2's design by recasting it as a long-range bomber, again competing against a Tupolev design, the DB-2, to meet the stringent requirements of an aircraft capable of delivering a bombload to a range of at a maximum speed no less than . He had redesigned the BB-2 to take advantage of the radial Gnome-Rh√¥ne Mistral Major 14Kdrs engine, for which the Soviets had purchased a license in 1934 as the M-85, and had begun construction of the prototype of the BB-2 2K-14 as the TsKB-26 that same year.Gordon, p. 81 The TsKB-26 was more of a proof-of-concept vehicle to validate Ilyushin's ideas on how to obtain long range than an actual bomber prototype. To speed the construction process, it had a wooden fuselage and fin with metal wings and tail surfaces. It made its first flight in the summer of 1935 and proved to be stable, easily controllable and highly maneuverable; it performed the first loop made by a twin-engined aircraft in the Soviet Union.Gordon, p. 82 It went on to set six world records in its class, generally in payloads to height and speed over a closed circuit. The real prototype of the DB-3 was called the TsKB-30 and it was completed in March 1936. It had a number of improvements over the TsKB-26, notably an all-metal structure, an extended nose, an aft-sliding canopy with a fixed windscreen and improved engine cowlings. It passed the State acceptance trials and was ordered into production in August 1936 as the DB-3, although some sources refer to this initial series as the DB-3S for seriynyy (series- built).Gordon, p. 84 The DB-3 was not a simple or easy aircraft to manufacture as Ilyushin had pushed the limits of the available construction technology to make it as light as possible. For example, the spar in each wing panel had four parts which had to be riveted together and there were numerous welds that each had to be inspected by an X-ray machine, with many failures. In addition the internal riveting of small-diameter tubing was also a difficult and time- consuming process.Gordon, p. 83 The bomb bay was designed to carry ten FAB-100 bombs, but heavier bombs could be accommodated on external bomb racks up to a total of on short-range missions. The defensive armament for the three crewmen consisted of three ShKAS machine guns. One in the tip of the nose manned by the bombardier-navigator and the two others protecting the rear. The rear gunner manned both the gun in the SU dorsal turret and the gun in an LU ventral hatch. Flight tests of the second example pre-production aircraft, conducted May‚ÄìOctober 1937, revealed that it was slightly inferior to the TsKB-30 in performance, but still exceeded its requirements by a considerable margin. It attained a speed of at an altitude of . It could carry a bombload of to a range of and a bombload to a range of . In comparison, the Heinkel He 111B then in production was slower and could carry only of bombs to a range of and to a distance of . This performance arguably made it the best twin-engined bomber in the world already or entering service in 1937.Gordon, p. 84 45 DB-3s were built that year at Factory No. 39 in Moscow and No. 18 in Voronezh and the aircraft entered service with the VVS. During 1938 the improved M-86 engine, rated at for takeoff, replaced the M-85 on the production line. Aircraft with this engine are properly referred to as DB-3 2M-86, but are sometimes referred to as the DB-3A, after the three-step upgrade program planned for the aircraft. Other minor changes were introduced over the course of the year. Factory No. 126 in Komsomolsk-on-Amur also began producing DB-3s in 1938.Gordon, pp. 85‚Äì86 During 1938‚Äì39 the Tumansky M-87A engine was introduced on the production line in a gradual transition as were VISh-3 variable-pitch propellers. The M-87 had the same horsepower rating at takeoff as the M-86, but produced more power at higher altitudes. The M-87B further increased power at altitude and was introduced in 1939‚Äì40. These aircraft were known as the DB-3B as part of the second stage of the upgrade program. The last production batches in 1940 had the Tumansky M-88 that produced for takeoff. These increased the maximum speed to at .Gordon, p. 86 Nomenclature Great confusion exists in the sources, including original Soviet documents, about the names commonly used for the DB-3. Formally the Soviet designation system used a two-letter abbreviation to designate the role of the aircraft, then a number for the model in that sequence followed by the number of engines, and the engine used. So SB 2M-100A is decoded as twin- engined fast bomber, first in the series, equipped with M-100A engines. Shorter abbreviations were informally used, but the use of them is not consistent between sources. For example, the listing for the strength of the VVS on 1 June 1941 shows a mixture of DB-3A and DB-3 aircraft, with the former predominating. But this does not match the account in Gordon where the DB-3A designation is used for one of the oldest versions of the DB-3. And where are the DB-3Bs? Operational history In 1939, 30 DB-3s were supplied to the Republic of China Air Force during the Second Sino-Japanese War and they saw heavy action against Japanese targets in the Wuhan region from their bases in Sichuan (mostly used by the 8th Group), before being replaced by B-24 Liberators in 1943. Two DB-3s were responsible for shooting down the neutral Finnish civilian Junkers Ju 52 passenger and transport plane Kaleva on June 14, 1940. The Finns captured five force-landed DB-3Ms during the Winter War and during 1941 they purchased a further six DB-3Ms and four DB-3F/Il-4s from German surplus stocks.Finnish Air Force Aircraft (FAF in Color: Ilyushin DB-3) On the night of August 7-8, 1941, fifteen DB-3T torpedo bombers of the Baltic Fleet dropped the first Soviet bombs on Berlin. From August 11, DB-3Fs of the VVS resumed bombing. Variants ;TsKB-26 :Proof-of-concept prototype ;TsKB-30 : First real prototype.

Monino Museum home page The aircraft was found in taiga forests, 120 km from Komsomolsk-on-Amur. It was recovered in September 1988 and brought to the Irkutsk Aircraft Industrial Association (IAIA) factory on board an Ilyushin Il-76 transport. After over a year of restoration, the aircraft was delivered to Monino on board an Antonov An-22. On 22 December 1989, representatives of IAIA, headed by V.P. Zelenkov, handed over the DB-3 to museum officials. This aircraft should not be confused with the Ilyushin Il-4 (cn 17404) exhibited in the Victory Park collection of the Central museum of Great Patriotic War, Moscow.

The net energy gain, which can be expressed in joules, differs from the net financial gain that may result from the energy harvesting process, in that various sources of energy (e.g. natural gas, coal, etc.) can be priced differently for the same amount of energy. Calculating NEG A net energy gain is achieved by expending less energy acquiring a source of energy than is contained in the source to be consumed. That is : NEG = Energy_{\\\\hbox{Consumable}} - Energy_{\\\\hbox{Expended}}. Factors to consider when calculating NEG is the type of energy, the way energy is used and acquired, and the methods used to store or transport the energy. It is also possible to overcomplicate the equation by an infinite number of externalities and inefficiencies that may be present during the energy harvesting process. Sources of energy The definition of an energy source is not rigorous. Anything that can provide energy to anything else can qualify. Wood in a stove is full of potential thermal energy; in a car, mechanical energy is acquired from the combustion of gasoline, and the combustion of coal is converted from thermal to mechanical, and then to electrical energy. Examples of energy sources include: * Fossil fuels * Nuclear fuels (e.g., uranium and plutonium) * Radiation from the sun * Mechanical energy from wind, rivers, tides, etc. * Bio-fuels derived from biomass, in turn having consumed soil nutrients during growth. * Heat from within the earth (geothermal energy) The term net energy gain can be used in slightly different ways: Non-sustainables The usual definition of net energy gain compares the energy required to extract energy (that is, to find it, remove it from the ground, refine it, and ship it to the energy user) with the amount of energy produced and transmitted to a user from some (typically underground) energy resource. To better understand this, assume an economy has a certain amount of finite oil reserves that are still underground, unextracted. To get to that energy, some of the extracted oil needs to be consumed in the extraction process to run the engines driving the pumps, therefore after extraction the net energy produced will be less than the amount of energy in the ground before extraction, because some had to be used up. The extraction energy can be viewed in one of two ways: profitable extractable (NEG>0) or nonprofitable extractable (NEG<0). For instance, in the Athabasca Oil Sands, the highly diffuse nature of the tar sands and low price of crude oil rendered them uneconomical to mine until the late 1950s (NEG<0). Since then, the price of oil has risen and a new steam extraction technique has been developed, allowing the sands to become the largest oil provider in Alberta (NEG>0).  Sustainables The situation is different with sustainable energy sources, such as hydroelectric, wind, solar, and geothermal energy sources, because there is no bulk reserve to account for (other than the Sun's lifetime), but the energy continuously trickles, so only the energy required for extraction is considered. In all energy extraction cases, the life cycle of the energy-extraction device is crucial for the NEG-ratio. If an extraction device is defunct after 10 years, its NEG will be significantly lower than if it operates for 30 years. Therefore, the 'energy payback time (sometimes referred to as energy amortization) can be used instead, which is the time, usually given in years, a plant must operate until the running NEG becomes positive (i.e. until the amount of energy needed for the plant infrastructure has been harvested from the plant). Biofuels Net energy gain of biofuels has been a particular source of controversy for ethanol derived from corn (bioethanol). The actual net energy of biofuel production is highly dependent on both the bio source that is converted into energy, how it is grown and harvested (and in particular the use of petroleum-derived fertilizer), and how efficient the process of conversion to usable energy is. Details on this can be found in the Ethanol fuel energy balance article. Similar considerations also apply to biodiesel and other fuels.  ISO 13602 ISO 13602-1 provides methods to analyse, characterize and compare technical energy systems (TES) with all their inputs, outputs and risk factors. It contains rules and guidelines for the methodology for such analyses. ISO 13602-1 describes a means of to establish relations between inputs and outputs (net energy) and thus to facilitate certification, marking, and labelling, comparable characterizations, coefficient of performance, energy resource planning, environmental impact assessments, meaningful energy statistics and forecasting of the direct natural energy resource or energyware inputs, technical energy system investments and the performed and expected future energy service outputs. In ISO 13602-1:2002, renewable resource is defined as \\"natural resource for which the ratio of the creation of the natural resource to the output of that resource from nature to the technosphere is equal to or greater than one\\". Examples Net energy cliff with degrading EROI During the 1920s, of crude oil were extracted for every barrel of crude used in the extraction and refining process. Today only are harvested for every barrel used. When the net energy gain of an energy source reaches zero, then the source is no longer contributing energy to an economy.

It is the only living member of the genus Neurotrichus and the tribe Neurotrichini. It is also known as Gibb's shrew mole and least shrew mole.http://www.mnh.si.edu/mna/image_info.cfm?species_id=220 It is not closely related to the Asian shrew mole (Uropsilus in Urotrichini). The reason that it is called a \\"shrew mole\\" instead of being called either a \\"shrew\\" or a \\"mole\\" is because of its fur, which is a characteristic of shrews and its large head and heavy dentition, which is characteristic of moles.Ronald M. Nowak, \\"Walker's Mammals of the World, Volume 1\\" Habitat It is found in damp, forested or bushy areas with deep, loose soils in the northwestern United States and southwestern British Columbia. In the most northern part of its habitat, it lives along streams or moist dense woods and in the most southern part of its habitat, it is found in swampy areas that are overgrown with vegetation such as sedges or shrubs.Hartley Harrad Thompson Jackson, \\"A review of the American moles\\" Morphological features Like shrews, it has a pelage with guard hairs and underfur. Its fur is dense and soft. The color ranges from dark gray to a sooty bluish-black. Its tail is about half the length of its head and body. Its tail is also covered with scales and scattered coarse hairs. It has a long, flattened snout, and a short but thick, bristled tail. It is the smallest of the American moles. It is about in length including a tail, and weighs about . It has a zygoma and auditory bullae, which are absent in shrews, but present in moles. The enamel that covers its teeth is white instead of mahogany or reddish-brown, like it is in shrews. It also lacks a penis bone. Its front paws are smaller and do not face outwards from the body as in more fossorial moles, and so are more similar to those of shrews. The front paws are also broad with bifurcate phalanges, which provide more support for the claws in order to dig.George A. Feldhamer, Bruce C. Thompson, Joseph A. Chapman, \\"Wild Mammals of North America:Biology, Management, and Conservation\\" Also, the three middle claws of the front paws are elongated and the eyes are also completely covered by skin. In addition to the front paws, the rest of its morphological features allow it to be highly fossorial and subterranean. It has a streamlined body that allow it to move smoothly through tunnels and short appendages that are kept close to the body. It also has no ear pinnae, which is the external part of the ear. These features reduce drag when it digs and when it moves through tunnels. Digging and burrowing The shrew-mole is often confused with pocket gophers, another group of fossorial subterranean mammals, because they have similar habits but they differ greatly in the methods for burrowing. Most fossorial mammals, including the pocket gophers dig with their forepaws held directly below their body, but shrew- moles dig using lateral-strokes. This method of lateral-stroke burrowing in shrew moles is an evolutionary adaptation due to the modification of the pectoral girdle and bones of the forelimbs. The pelvic girdle is small and unmodified, but the pectoral girdle contains a special joint that causes the clavicle to join with the humerus instead of the scapula. The humerus bones are unique to shrew-moles because they exist as massive rectangular shapes, unlike other fossorial mammalian groups. The humerus also has a large surface area for the attachment of well developed muscles used for digging. The shrew- mole makes permanent tunnels by digging with its forelimbs and using its forefeet to soften the soil that will be removed to make a hollow tunnel. The tunnels form complex networks that interconnect and lead to burrows. The tunnels are rarely ever deeper than 30 centimeters below the surface, so they are not as deep as the tunnels of other mole species. The burrows are made beneath decaying leaf litter and have an opening on the ceiling that leads to the surface, which serves the purpose of ventilation. The shrew-mole also makes shallow surface runways by moving the front part of its body 45 degrees to the right and then to the left. Then back again to the right, then left, and so on. When it moves to the right, the left forepaw is thrust up rapidly lifting soil in the process and when it moves to the left, the right forepaw is thrust up to lift soil. As the shrew-mole continues to dig through the soil, the amount of prey in the soil is significantly less than the amount present in soil that has not been dug through by them. In addition, it spends a lot of its energy to dig through the soil. Due to these factors, it is common for shrew-moles to forage through tunnels that have been dug by other shrew-moles because it is more energetically efficient and more prey might be present in tunnels that have been abandoned. Skull and dentition It has a long and narrow rostrum, which is the projection that forms the snout. The junction between the skull bones turns into bone early on in their age, which makes it difficult to identify their age based on looking at their skull bones. The maxillary only turns into bone in the adults and the roots of the upper molars are exposed in immature shrew-moles. The first upper incisor is flat and it does not have an elongated crown, like shrew do. It has 36 teeth, which consist of incisors, canines, pre-molars, and molars. Diet and digestion This mole is often active above ground, foraging in leaf litter for earthworms, insects, snails and slugs. It is also known to eat some vegetation such as mycorrhizal fungi and even salamanders, but earthworms are the most important food item in its diet. Its diet also depends on the type of available food sources, so it may eat more vegetation than anything else if there are no insects or other arthropods within its vicinity. It is able to climb bushes to forage for food, although that is not its main eating resource. Like all shrew-moles, the stomach size of this shrew mole in inversely proportional to its body weight. Their intestinal tract is quite short and digestion occurs rapidly. Predators Predators include owls, hawks and mustelids such as weasels, fishers, and pine martins. Additional predators include red and gray foxes, raccoons, and skunks. Dogs and cats can kill them as well, but do not eat them. Venomous and non-venomous snakes, bullfrogs, and opossums have also been reported to hunt them. The most common ectoparasites found on these shrew moles are fleas and mites. The endoparasites found in shrew-moles consist of twenty species of coccidian protozoans, at least five species of nematode, two species of trematode, and two species of acanthocephalan. Physiology When underground shrew-moles can suffer from a low levels of oxygen, high levels of carbon dioxide, and high levels of humidity. In order to cope with these conditions, shrew-moles contain lungs that can hold large volumes and sometimes even more than 20% of their body weight. They also experience stages of sleep that are similar to humans such as rapid eye movement sleep. It is believed that the reason why they experience stages of deep sleep is because they are subject to less danger than other mammals. They have well developed hearing. Genetics The shrew-mole has 38 chromosomes. The sex chromosomes are XX in females and XY in males. The Y chromosome in males is very small and appears to be similar in all species. Reproduction It can have several litters annually, though no litters have been recorded between December and January. Females have litters with one to four young. Newborns are about 30 millimeters long and weigh less than 1 gram. In females, the vagina remains sealed until follicles appear in the ovaries. Males lack a scrotum, but the testes and associated glands become enlarged, which increases their weight. These characteristics make it difficult to externally determine the sex of shrew-moles. Social behavior It is somewhat gregarious, which means that it lives in loosely organized communities of about 12 to 15 shrew moles. The only known type of vocalization that they produce is a faint twittering sound that can be heard for several feet. It is both diurnal and nocturnal. Economic status Shrew-moles usually live in areas where it is difficult to cultivate so they are usually economically neutral, but there are some cases where they do damage people's homes. There are many different methods that people use for getting rid of these moles. The most common non-commercial method is trapping because it is practical for homes with little land, but unpractical for large areas of land. Other methods include catching moles by spading where a spade is put behind the mole as it creates a surface tunnel or repairs a tunnel and is then lifted up or by hand, where the mole is picked up by its fur. Chemical control agents can also be used. Using bait is another method used to control these shrew- moles. The bait usually consists of some type of cereal grain that is treated with chemicals. The type of cereal grain and chemicals used depends on the manufacturer, but a common chemical is an anticoagulant that inhibits their normal platelet function in the blood, which causes internal hemorrhaging and leads to death. Some other approaches are to force the animal away somehow or to get rid of their food source. There are also many home remedies that are used to get rid of these shrew-moles, but whether or not these methods are successful are usually not evident. These methods include using noisemaker devices such as placing empty soft drink bottles at an angle with the bottom in the tunnel while the neck is sticking. It is believed by some that the sound that the wind produces as it goes through the bottle scares the shrew- moles away. Materials consisting of offensive and unpleasant smells and materials that cause injury are also sometimes placed in the tunnels such as broken pieces of glass, razors, exhaust fumes, moth balls, gum, and thorns.

Whereas the current account reflects a nation's net income, the capital account reflects net change in ownership of national assets. A surplus in the capital account means money is flowing into the country, but unlike a surplus in the current account, the inbound flows effectively represent borrowings or sales of assets rather than payment for work. A deficit in the capital account means money is flowing out of the country, and it suggests the nation is increasing its ownership of foreign assets. The term \\"capital account\\" is used with a narrower meaning by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and affiliated sources. The IMF splits what the rest of the world calls the capital account into two top-level divisions: financial account and capital account, with by far the bulk of the transactions being recorded in its financial account. Definitions At high level: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\mbox{Capital account} & = \\\\mbox{Change in foreign ownership of domestic assets} \\\\ & \\\\- \\\\mbox{Change in domestic ownership of foreign assets} \\\\ \\\\end{align} Breaking this down: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\mbox{Capital account} & = \\\\mbox{Foreign direct investment} \\\\ & \\\\+ \\\\mbox{Portfolio investment} \\\\ & \\\\+ \\\\mbox{Other investment} \\\\ & \\\\+ \\\\mbox{Reserve account} \\\\ \\\\end{align} International Finance Centre in Hong Kong, where many capital account transactions are processed. * Foreign direct investment (FDI) refers to long-term capital investment, such as the purchase or construction of machinery, buildings, or whole manufacturing plants. If foreigners are investing in a country, that represents an inbound flow and counts as a surplus item on the capital account. If a nation's citizens are investing in foreign countries, that represents an outbound flow and counts as a deficit. After the initial investment, any yearly profits that are not reinvested will flow in the opposite direction but will be recorded in the current account rather than as capital. * Portfolio investment refers to the purchase of shares and bonds. It is sometimes grouped together with \\"other\\" as short-term investment. As with FDI, the income derived from these assets is recorded in the current account; the capital account entry will just be for any buying or selling of the portfolio assets in the international capital markets. * Other investment includes capital flows into bank accounts or provided as loans. Large short-term flows between accounts in different nations commonly occur when the market can take advantage of fluctuations in interest rates and/or the exchange rate between currencies. Sometimes this category can include the reserve account. * Reserve account. The reserve account is operated by a nation's central bank to buy and sell foreign currencies; it can be a source of large capital flows to counteract those originating from the market. Inbound capital flows (from sales of the nation's foreign currency), especially when combined with a current account surplus, can cause a rise in value (appreciation) of a nation's currency, while outbound flows can cause a fall in value (depreciation). If a government (or, if authorized to operate independently in this area, the central bank itself) does not consider the market-driven change to its currency value to be in the nation's best interests, it can intervene. Central bank operations and the reserve account Conventionally, central banks have two principal tools to influence the value of their nation's currency: raising or lowering the base rate of interest and, more effectively, buying or selling their currency. Setting a higher interest rate than other major central banks will tend to attract funds via the nation's capital account, and this will act to raise the value of its currency. A relatively low interest rate will have the opposite effect. Since World War II, interest rates have largely been set with a view to the needs of the domestic economy, and moreover, changing the interest rate alone has only a limited effect. A nation's ability to prevent a fall in the value of its own currency is limited mainly by the size of its foreign reserves: it needs to use the reserves to buy back its currency.By the law of supply and demand, reducing the supply of currency available by buying up large quantities on the forex markets tends to raise the price. Starting in 2013, a trend has developed for some central banks to attempt to exert upward pressure on their currencies by means of currency swaps rather than by directly selling their foreign reserves. In the absence of foreign reserves, central banks may affect international pricing indirectly by selling assets (usually government bonds) domestically, which, however, diminishes liquidity in the economy and may lead to deflation. When a currency rises higher than monetary authorities might like (making exports less competitive internationally), it is usually considered relatively easy for an independent central bank to counter this. By buying foreign currency or foreign financial assets (usually other governments' bonds), the central bank has a ready means to lower the value of its own currency; if it needs to, it can always create more of its own currency to fund these purchases. The risk, however, is general price inflation. The term \\"printing money\\" is often used to describe such monetization, but is an anachronism, since most money exists in the form of deposits and its supply is manipulated through the purchase of bonds. A third mechanism that central banks and governments can use to raise or lower the value of their currency is simply to talk it up or down, by hinting at future action that may discourage speculators. Quantitative easing, a practice used by major central banks in 2009, consisted of large-scale bond purchases by central banks. The desire was to stabilize banking systems and, if possible, encourage investment to reduce unemployment. As an example of direct intervention to manage currency valuation, in the 20th century Great Britain's central bank, the Bank of England, would sometimes use its reserves to buy large amounts of pound sterling to prevent it falling in value. Black Wednesday was a case where it had insufficient reserves of foreign currency to do this successfully. Conversely, in the early 21st century, several major emerging economies effectively sold large amounts of their currencies in order to prevent their value rising, and in the process built up large reserves of foreign currency, principally the US dollar. Sometimes the reserve account is classified as \\"below the line\\" and thus not reported as part of the capital account. Flows to or from the reserve account can substantially affect the overall capital account. Taking the example of China in the early 21st century, and excluding the activity of its central bank, China's capital account had a large surplus, as it had been the recipient of much foreign investment. If the reserve account is included, however, China's capital account has been in large deficit, as its central bank purchased large amounts of foreign assets (chiefly US government bonds) to a degree sufficient to offset not just the rest of the capital account, but its large current account surplus as well.However, in late 2011 China also had periods when it was selling foreign reserves to prevent depreciation, this was due to surges of funds leaving the country through the private sector component of the capital account. =Sterilization= In the financial literature, sterilization is a term commonly used to refer to operations of a central bank that mitigate the potentially undesirable effects of inbound capital: currency appreciation and inflation. Depending on the source, sterilization can mean the relatively straightforward recycling of inbound capital to prevent currency appreciation and/or a range of measures to check the inflationary impact of inbound capital. The classic way to sterilize the inflationary effect of the extra money flowing into the domestic base from the capital account is for the central bank to use open market operations where it sells bonds domestically, thereby soaking up new cash that would otherwise circulate around the home economy. A central bank normally makes a small loss from its overall sterilization operations, as the interest it earns from buying foreign assets to prevent appreciation is usually less than what it has to pay out on the bonds it issues domestically to check inflation. In some cases, however, a profit can be made. In the strict textbook definition, sterilization refers only to measures aimed at keeping the domestic monetary base stable; an intervention to prevent currency appreciation that involved merely buying foreign assets without counteracting the resulting increase of the domestic money supply would not count as sterilization. A textbook sterilization would be, for example, the Federal Reserve's purchase of $1 billion in foreign assets. This would create additional liquidity in foreign hands. At the same time, the Fed would sell $1 billion of debt securities into the US market, draining the domestic economy of $1 billion. With $1 billion added abroad and $1 billion removed from the domestic economy, the net capital inflow that would have influenced the currency's exchange rate has undergone sterilization. International Monetary Fund The above definition is the one most widely used in economic literature,Though with a few exceptions, e.g. International economics by Krugman and Obstfeld which uses the IMF definition in at least its 5th edition. in the financial press, by corporate and government analysts (except when they are reporting to the IMF), and by the World Bank. In contrast, what the rest of the world calls the capital account is labelled the \\"financial account\\" by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the United Nations System of National Accounts (SNA). In the IMF's definition, the capital account represents a small subset of what the standard definition designates the capital account, largely comprising transfers. Transfers are one-way flows, such as gifts, as opposed to commercial exchanges (i.e., buying/selling and barter). The largest type of transfer between nations is typically foreign aid, but that is mostly recorded in the current account. An exception is debt forgiveness, which in a sense is the transfer of ownership of an asset. When a country receives significant debt forgiveness, that will typically comprise the bulk of its overall IMF capital account entry for that year. The IMF's capital account does include some non-transfer flows, which are sales involving non-financial and non-produced assets‚Äîfor example, natural resources like land, leases and licenses, and marketing assets such as brands‚Äîbut the sums involved are typically very small, as most movement in these items occurs when both seller and buyer are of the same nationality. Transfers apart from debt forgiveness recorded in the IMF's capital account include the transfer of goods and financial assets by migrants leaving or entering a country, the transfer of ownership on fixed assets, the transfer of funds received to the sale or acquisition of fixed assets, gift and inheritance taxes, death levies, and uninsured damage to fixed assets. In a non-IMF representation, these items might be grouped in the \\"other\\" subtotal of the capital account. They typically amount to a very small amount in comparison to loans and flows into and out of short-term bank accounts. Capital controls Capital controls are measures imposed by a state's government aimed at managing capital account transactions. They include outright prohibitions against some or all capital account transactions, transaction taxes on the international sale of specific financial assets, or caps on the size of international sales and purchases of specific financial assets. While usually aimed at the financial sector, controls can affect ordinary citizens, for example in the 1960s British families were at one point restricted from taking more than ¬£50 with them out of the country for their foreign holidays. Countries without capital controls that limit the buying and selling of their currency at market rates are said to have full capital account convertibility. Following the Bretton Woods agreement established at the close of World War II, most nations put in place capital controls to prevent large flows either into or out of their capital account. John Maynard Keynes, one of the architects of the Bretton Woods system, considered capital controls to be a permanent part of the global economy. Both advanced and emerging nations adopted controls; in basic theory it may be supposed that large inbound investments will speed an emerging economy's development, but empirical evidence suggests this does not reliably occur, and in fact large capital inflows can hurt a nation's economic development by causing its currency to appreciate, by contributing to inflation, and by causing an unsustainable \\"bubble\\" of economic activity that often precedes financial crisis. The inflows sharply reverse once capital flight takes places after the crisis occurs. As part of the displacement of Keynesianism in favor of free market orientated policies, countries began abolishing their capital controls, starting between 1973‚Äì74 with the US, Canada, Germany and Switzerland and followed by Great Britain in 1979. Most other advanced and emerging economies followed, chiefly in the 1980s and early 1990s. An exception to this trend was Malaysia, which in 1998 imposed capital controls in the wake of the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis. While most Asian economies didn't impose controls, after the 1997 crises they ceased to be net importers of capital and became net exporters instead. Large inbound flows were directed \\"uphill\\" from emerging economies to the US and other developed nations. According to economist C. Fred Bergsten the large inbound flow into the US was one of the causes of the financial crisis of 2007-2008. By the second half of 2009, low interest rates and other aspects of the government led response to the global crises had resulted in increased movement of capital back towards emerging economies. In November 2009 the Financial Times reported several emerging economies such as Brazil and India have begun to implement or at least signal the possible adoption of capital controls to reduce the flow of foreign capital into their economies.

It was formed in 1922 as part of a reduction in the army's cavalry by the amalgamation of the 3rd Dragoon Guards (Prince of Wales's) and the Carabiniers (6th Dragoon Guards), to form the 3rd/6th Dragoon Guards. It was renamed the 3rd Carabiniers (Prince of Wales's Dragoon Guards) in 1928 and amalgamated with the Royal Scots Greys (2nd Dragoons), forming the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards (Carabiniers and Greys) in 1971. History=Inter-war The regiment was formed in 1922 as part of a reduction in the army's cavalry by the amalgamation of the 3rd Dragoon Guards (Prince of Wales's) and the Carabiniers (6th Dragoon Guards), to form the 3rd/6th Dragoon Guards. Both regiments were based in India at the time of their amalgamation; the newly formed regiment departed in 1925 for Britain. It regained its carabinier association in 1928, when it was renamed the 3rd Carabiniers (Prince of Wales's Dragoon Guards). The 3rd Carabiniers was posted to Sialkot in India in 1936 and began its mechanisation process, changing its horses for armoured vehicles, in 1938. Second World War When the war began in September 1939, the 3rd Carabiniers was still based in India. In 1941, a cadre from the regiment was used to form the 25th Dragoons, which saw service in Burma; it was disbanded in India in 1947. Now equipped with the M3 Lee medium tank, the regiment was sent to North-East India with the 254th Indian Tank Brigade in December 1943.Allen 2000 p. 657. It took part in the Battle of Imphal, which began in late March 1944 after the Japanese launched the U-Go offensive. On 20 March, around Tamu, six of the regiment's tanks clashed with six Japanese Type 95 Ha-Go tanks, destroying five of them and capturing the other.Allen 2000, p. 209. Later, in the battle to retake Nunshigum Ridge on 13 April, tanks from the regiment's 'B' Squadron supported the 1/17th Dogras in fierce fighting that dislodged the Japanese defenders.Brayley 2002, p. 43.Allen 2000, p. 254. The 3rd Carabiniers, operating usually at squadron level or lower, took part in the successful advance deep into occupied Burma, taking part in (among others) an intense action at Kennedy Peak. Early 1945 saw the regiment engaged in fighting at Shwebo and Sagang; it took part in the capture of Ava and Mandalay in March, and later around the Irrawaddy River. Post-World War II After the war's official end in September, the regiment was based at Ahmednagar in India up until the British withdrawal. The regiment's departure came in January 1947, when it embarked aboard the Highland Princess at Bombay. The 3rd Carabiniers was posted to the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR) in West Germany in March 1952. The regiment was based in Osnabr√ºck, remaining there until May 1959. After that, it moved to Catterick, England, but its stay there was short, as it joined the Strategic Reserve at Tidworth in July 1960. In July 1961, the regiment deployed its 'C' Squadron to Kuwait as part of a British force charged with deterring Iraq from fulfilling its threats to annex it. A return to West Germany came the following year, when it joined the 20th Armoured Brigade in Detmold. Having been armed with tanks since the early 1950s, the regiment was re-roled to a reconnaissance unit in 1967, first operating the Ferret scout car. Deployments to the British military installations in Libya and Cyprus followed in 1968. A brief posting to M√ºnster, West Germany took place in 1969 before moving to Herford, West Germany. On 2 July 1971, the regiment amalgamated with the Royal Scots Greys (2nd Dragoons), forming the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards (Carabiniers and Greys).

It is the prototype of the R Cor Bor class of variable stars, which fade by several magnitudes at irregular intervals. R Coronae Borealis itself normally shines at approximately magnitude 6, just about visible to the naked eye, but at intervals of several months to many years fades to as faint as 15th magnitude. Over successive months it then gradually returns to its normal brightness, giving it the nickname \\"reverse nova\\", after the more common type of star which rapidly increases in brightness before fading. Nomenclature R Coronae Borealis is a faint naked eye star, but does not have any traditional names. Johann Bayer did not give it a Greek letter designation although it is marked on his map. John Flamsteed numbered all the Bayer stars but did not add any additional designations for fainter stars, so R Coronae Borealis does not appear in either of these two catalogues. At its discovery it was described simply as \\"the variable in the Northern crown\\". It was later referred to as Variabilis Coronae, \\"Variable (star) of Corona (Borealis)\\". It has also been called a \\"reverse nova\\" because of its habit of fading from sight. The variable star designation R Coronae Borealis was introduced, as \\"Coronae R\\" by Friedrich Wilhelm Argelander in 1850. Variability Light curve of R Coronae Borealis from 1990 to 2017, showing the unprecedented deep minimum The variability of R Coronae Borealis was discovered by English astronomer Edward Pigott in 1795. In 1935 it was the first star shown to have a different chemical composition to the Sun via spectral analysis. R Coronae Borealis is the prototype of the R Coronae Borealis class of variable stars. It is one of only two R Coronae Borealis variables bright enough to be seen with the naked eye, along with RY Sagittarii. Much of the time it shows variations of around a tenth of a magnitude with poorly defined periods that have been reported as 40 and 51 days. These correspond to the first overtone and fundamental radial pulsation modes for an extreme helium star slightly under . At irregular intervals a few years or decades apart R Coronae Borealis fades from its normal brightness near 6th magnitude for a period of months or sometimes years. There is no fixed minimum, but the star can become fainter than 15th magnitude in the visual range. The fading is less pronounced at longer wavelengths. Typically the star starts to return to maximum brightness almost immediately from its minimum, although occasionally this is interrupted by another fade. The cause of this behaviour is believed to be a regular build-up of carbon dust in the star's atmosphere. The sudden drop in brightness may be caused by a rapid condensation of carbon-rich dust similar to soot, resulting in much of the star's light being blocked. The gradual restoration to normal brightness results from the dust being dispersed by radiation pressure. In August 2007, R Coronae Borealis began a fade to an unprecedented minimum. It fell to 14th magnitude in 33 days, then continued to fade slowly, dropping below 15th magnitude in June 2009. It then began an equally slow rise, not reaching 12th magnitude until late 2011. This was an unusually deep and exceptional long minimum, longer even than a deep five year minimum which had occurred in 1962-7. It then faded again to near 15th magnitude, and by August 2014 it had been below 10th magnitude for 7 years. In late 2014, it brightened quickly to 7th magnitude but then began to fade again. By mid-2017, it had been below its \\"normal\\" brightness for ten years. It also reached a new record faintest at magnitude 15.2. Spectrum R Coronae Borealis at maximum light shows the spectrum a late F or early G yellow supergiant, but with marked peculiarities. Hydrogen lines are weak or absent, while carbon lines and molecular bands of cyanogen (CN) and C2 are exceptionally strong. Helium lines and metals such as calcium are also present. The spectrum is variable, most obviously during the brightness fades. The normal absorption spectrum is replaced by emission lines, especially HeI, CaII, NaI, and other metals. The lines are typically very narrow at this stage. Helium emission lines sometimes show P Cygni profiles. In deep minima, many of the metal lines disappear although the Ca doublet remains strong. Forbidden \\"nebular\\" lines of [OI], [OII], and [NII] can be detected at times. The spectrum at maximum indicates that hydrogen in R Coronae Borealis is strongly depleted, helium is the dominant element, and carbon is strongly enhanced. At minimum, the spectrum shows the development of carbon clouds that obscure the photosphere, leaving chromospheric lines visible at times. Properties R Coronae Borealis in optical light R Coronae Borealis is about 90% helium and less than 1% hydrogen. The majority of the remainder is carbon. This classifies it as a carbon-enhanced extreme helium star. Modelling the pulsations suggests that the star's mass is . The temperature at maximum is reasonably well known at 6,900K and appears to decrease during the fades as the photosphere is obscured by condensing dust. The distance of R Coronae Borealis is not known exactly, but is estimated at 1.4 kiloparsecs from assumptions about its intrinsic brightness. The absolute magnitude of ‚àí5 is calculated by comparison with R CrB variables in the Large Magellanic Cloud whose distances are known quite accurately. The luminosity is estimated from helium star models to be and the star has a radius around . The Gaia data release 1 parallax also gives a distance of 1.4 kpc although with a considerable margin of error. There is a fainter star 3\\" away from R Coronae Borealis, but it is believed to be a distant class K dwarf. Its colour and apparent magnitude are not consistent with being at the same distance as R Coronae Borealis. Formation There are two main models for the formation of R CrB stars: the merger of two white dwarfs; or a very late helium flash in a post-AGB star. Models of post-AGB stars calculate that a star with the appearance of R CrB would have a mass around so it is thought to have formed by the merger of a carbon-oxygen white dwarf and a helium white dwarf. The detection of significant lithium in the atmosphere is not easily explained by the merger model, but is a natural consequence of a late helium flash. Evolutionary models of post-AGB stars give a mass of for R CrB, but with a considerable margin of error. Circumstellar material Direct imaging with the Hubble Space Telescope shows extensive dust clouds out to a radius of around 2000 astronomical units from R Coronae Borealis, corresponding to a stream of fine dust (composed of grains about 5 nm in diameter) associated with the star's stellar wind, and coarser dust (composed of grains with a diameter of around 0.14 ¬µm) ejected periodically. The obscuration appears to happen closer to the star as clouds of carbon condense at shock regions in an expanding front. \\"Puffs\\" of dust emitted from the star condense at about from the surface, and are visible as cometary knots when they lie to side of the star. There is also a shell about 4 pc wide containing dust at 25 K, which may be a fossil planetary nebula.

He served between February 2, 1973 and March 15, 1975. Brennan had previously been the president of both the Building and Construction Trades Council of Greater New York and the Building and Construction Trades Council of New York, and returned to the former position after leaving the Ford administration. He was a strong opponent of affirmative action measures to increase the number of minority construction workers. After organizing a demonstration in support of the Nixon administration that turned into the Hard Hat Riot of May 8, 1970, where construction workers violently attacked student anti-war protesters, Brennan was wooed by the Nixon administration as a potential supporter in the 1972 presidential election. His work for Nixon in that election was crucial in increasing the vote for Nixon in New York and in the union movement. Early life Peter J. Brennan was born in New York City in 1918.Fink, Biographical Dictionary of American Labor, 1984. His father was an ironworker who died from influenza. He graduated from Commerce High School, then received a B.S. degree in business administration from the City College of New York. While in college, he became an apprentice painter and joined Local 1456 of the Painter's Union. After the USA entered World War II, Brennan enlisted in the Navy, serving as a chief petty officer aboard a submarine home ported in Guam. Brennan's career as a union official started when he was elected business manager of Local 1456 in 1947. In 1951, he became the director of the New York Building Trades Council's Maintenance Division. Brennan married the former Josephine Brickley in 1940, (she died in 1987). The couple had one son, Peter Joseph Brennan, Jr., and two daughters, Joan Brennan and Peggy Brennan. Brennan was elected president of the Building and Construction Trades Council of Greater New York in 1957 and president of the Building and Construction Trades Council of New York.\\"Brennan to Head Building Council,\\" New York Times, October 17, 1957. He also served as the vice president of the New York City Central Labor Council and the New York State AFL-CIO. These positions were influential both in the labour movement and politically. The Construction Trades Council represented 250,000 members from 18 locals and had close ties to New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller and leading politicians in New York City. During the 1960s, these unions were strong supporters of the Democrats and delivered strong voter turnout for John F. Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson and Hubert Humphrey. Affirmative action John Lindsay was elected Mayor of New York City in 1965 as a liberal Republican pledging to take on special interests, including the building and construction unions. In the late 1960s, a diverse coalition of business leaders, construction companies, civil rights activists, reformers and the media wanted to open up opportunities for minorities. A study by the New York City Commission on Human Rights in 1967 found that minority membership in the six most highly skilled building trades was only 2 percent and had not changed since 1960. The reform coalition thought the low entry into the building trades increased building costs above the market rate and cost New York City millions of dollars in increased costs. In 1968, the Lindsay administration issued Executive Order 1971, which required city contractors to sign a non- discriminatory hiring action plan and develop affirmative action plans. If the contractors did not comply with the executive order, they could not bid for city work. Brennan was strongly opposed and promised to take action to have the order rescinded. The Nixon Administration, under Labor Secretary George P. Shultz, announced the Philadelphia Plan in the summer of 1969 to increase minority membership of skilled building trades to twenty per cent within five years. Brennan and the skilled labor unions were determined to stop the introduction of such a system. They persuaded George Meany, President of the AFL-CIO and a former plumbing union official in New York City, to sponsor Congressional and legal challenges to the plans, but these efforts failed.Palladino, Skilled Hands, Strong Spirits: A Century of Building Trades History, 2005. In February 1970, the Labor Department announced that it would support local construction industry affirmative action hiring plans provided that they were consistent with the Philadelphia Plan. Brennan was having a great deal of trouble persuading either the Department of Labor or the Lindsay administration to his way of thinking. The Lindsay administration stated that it wanted 4,000 minority trainees as part of the plan, but Brennan wanted no more than 1,000 trainees. Schultz warned labor leaders that the federal government would implement the Philadelphia Plan in 18 cities if suitable local plans were not implemented quickly. Hard Hat Riot On May 4, 1970, four students were shot dead at Kent State University in Ohio while protesting the Vietnam War and the incursion into Cambodia.Kifner, \\"4 Kent State Students Killed by Troops,\\" New York Times, May 5, 1970. As a show of sympathy for the dead students, Mayor Lindsay ordered all flags at City Hall to be flown at half mast the same day. Brennan organized a rally of construction workers to show support for Nixon's Vietnam policies and American soldiers fighting in Vietnam. At 7:30 a.m. on May 8, several hundred anti-war protesters (most of them high school and college students) began holding a memorial at Broad and Wall Streets for the four dead students at Kent State. By late morning, the protesters‚Äînow numbering more than a thousand‚Äîwere demanding an end to the war in Vietnam and Cambodia, the release of \\"political prisoners\\" in the U.S., and an end to military-related research on all university campuses. At five minutes to noon, about 200 construction workers converged on the student rally at Federal Hall National Memorial from four directions. At first, the construction workers only pushed but did not break the thin line of police. After just two minutes, however, the workers broke through the police line and began chasing students through the streets. The workers selected those with the longest hair and swatted them with their hard hats. Attorneys, bankers and investment analysts from nearby Wall Street investment firms tried to protect many of the students but were themselves attacked. Onlookers reported that the police stood by and did nothing. A postal worker rushed onto the roof of City Hall and raised the American flag to full mast. When city workers lowered the flag to half-mast, the construction workers stormed City Hall, overwhelming the police. Deputy Mayor Richard Aurelio, fearing the building would be overrun by the mob, ordered city workers to raise the flag back to full mast. The construction workers then ripped the Red Cross and Episcopal Church flags down from a flag pole at Trinity Church. They then stormed two buildings at nearby Pace University, breaking windows with clubs and crowbars and beating students. More than 70 people were injured, including four policemen. Six people were arrested. President Nixon held an emergency press conference to defuse the situation before tens of thousands of students arrived in Washington, D.C., for a protest rally on May 9.Foner, U.S. Labor and the Vietnam War, 1989.Freeman, \\"Hardhats: Construction Workers, Manliness, and the 1970 Pro-War Demonstrations,\\" Journal of Social History, Summer 1993.Perlmutter, \\"Head of Building Trades Unions Here Says Response Favors Friday's Action,\\" New York Times, May 12, 1970. Many organizations claim that Peter Brennan provoked the construction workers into action. At least one eyewitness described two men in grey suits using hand signals to direct the construction workers during the riot The disturbances on May 8 became known as the Hard Hat Riot.Bigart, \\"War Foes Here Attacked By Construction Workers,\\" New York Times, May 9, 1970. Brennan led a second rally on May 20 in which more than 20,000 construction workers announced their support for Nixon's Southeast Asia policies.Bigart, \\"Huge City Hall Rally Backs Nixon's Indochina Policies,\\" New York Times, May 21, 1970. Support for Nixon in 1972 On May 26, 1970, Brennan led a delegation of 22 union leaders to meet Nixon and to present him with a hardhat. Charles Colson was put in charge of developing a strategy to win union support for Nixon in the 1972 presidential election. Brennan was identified as a friendly leader of the labor movement for cultivation.Semple, \\"Nixon Meets Heads Of 2 City Unions,\\" New York Times, May 27, 1970. Colson wanted to recruit a senior trade unionist to serve in the administration. Colson wrote in a memo to H.R. Haldeman, \\"If we can follow through on the good start we have, the labor vote can be ours in 1972.\\" That would be a critical blow to the Democratic nominee for President, as labor was normally an essential part of the Democrat coalition. Brennan was granted a private audience with Nixon on Labor Day when 70 labor leaders from across the US were invited to a Labor Day dinner. Shortly after, Governor Rockefeller, Mayor Lindsay and Brennan announced the New York Planning for Training, which specified a goal of 800 trainees, rather than the 4,000 trainees wanted by Lindsay. The labor movement was angered in 1971 when the Nixon administration introduced wage controls as part of a package to try to control inflation and suspended the Davis-Bacon Act, which provides that construction workers on federal projects receive union wages. Brennan accused the administration of treating the construction workers as \\"patsies.\\" Brennan called himself a Democrat but often supported Republicans for office. Despite the setback on Davis-Bacon, Brennan met Nixon again in April 1971 and offered to support his bid for re-election in return for the federal government adopting the New York Plan.Stetson, \\"Brennan Reports Labor Leaders Favoring Nixon Are Organizing,\\" New York Times, September 9, 1972; Stetson, \\"200 Labor Chiefs in City Form Nixon Committee,\\" New York Times, September 28, 1972. Brennan delivered on his word for Nixon in 1972. After a meeting with construction unions in 1972, Nixon wrote in his diary of labor leaders having \\"character and guts and a bit of patriotism.\\" Labor leadership were also alienated by the Democratic candidate George McGovern and his leftist views on domestic policies. On July 19, the AFL-CIO refused to endorse McGovern as President. Meany told Nixon in late July that he was going to win in a landslide and that he was not going to waste AFL-CIO money supporting McGovern's candidacy.Goulden, Meany, 1972; Robinson, George Meany and His Times, 1981. Nixon duly won in a landslide, carrying New York easily with the support of the vast majority of building and construction workers in that state, who, four years, earlier had voted overwhelmingly for Hubert Humphrey. In return for his support, Brennan succeeded in having an audit of the New York Plan deferred until after the election. Political life President Nixon appointed Peter Brennan as his Labor Secretary as a reward for his support and to try to consolidate his support amongst union members.Naughton, \\"Construction Union Chief in New York Is Chosen to Succeed Hodgson,\\" New York Times, November 30, 1972; Shabecoff, \\"Brennan Choice Called Political Move,\\" New York Times, December 1, 1972. Colson recruited Brennan for the post of Labor Secretary days after the November election. In a three-hour meeting, Colson told Brennan that he would have to defend unpopular administration policies, abide by administration policy decisions, and keep Labor Department officials from investigating Teamsters president Frank Fitzsimmons, who had played a critical role in securing limited labor support for Nixon. Colson told Brennan that Nixon would appoint the Under Secretary and Assistant Secretary, but Brennan would have a free hand in appointing all other political positions if they provided unwavering support for administration policies. The Labor Department, Colson said, was \\"infested\\" with disloyal appointees and Brennan was to \\"clean house.\\" Brennan agreed to every condition.Kutler, The Wars of Watergate, paperback ed., 1990. The Senate confirmed him, and Brennan assumed office on February 2, 1973. American labor leaders were initially happy with Brennan's appointment. He was an outspoken advocate for a higher minimum wage, expanding the minimum wage to cover more workers, significant improvement in unemployment benefits, enhanced workplace safety, and worker training programs.Stetson, \\"He Wants Wage Controls Ended and Unrestricted Bargaining Resumed,\\" New York Times, November 30, 1972. But once in office, Brennan promoted a plan to raise the minimum wages in small increments over four years with no increase in the number of covered workers. George Meany, the president of the AFL-CIO, was outraged and rarely mentioned Brennan's name or spoke to him again during Brennan's tenure in office.Shabecoff, \\"$230 Wage Base By '76 Proposed,\\" New York Times, April 11, 1973; Shabecoff, \\"Nixon Defends Brennan In Minimum-Wage Dispute,\\" New York Times, April 17, 1973. Under Brennan, the Nixon administration supported and Congress passed legislation to protect worker pensions, expand workplace rights of the disabled, improve enforcement of occupational safety and health laws, and improve benefits for workers left jobless by changes in international trade.\\"Brennan Is Reactivating Unit on Labor Training,\\" New York Times, July 28, 1974; Herbers, \\"Ford Signs Bills to Spur New Jobs And Expand Unemployment Benefits,\\" New York Times, January 1, 1975; Asbury, \\"Pension Controls Ease as U.S. Law Takes Effect,\\" New York Times, January 1, 1975. Brennan also stalled on affirmative action plans in the building industry, especially the New York Plan. By August 1972, only 534 minority workers had received training, and only 34 had received union cards under the New York Plan. In 1973, John Lindsay, who had become a Democrat, withdrew from the New York Plan and set a new objective to increase minority representation in the building trades to 25%. In response, Brennan issued a directive forbidding local authorities from exceeding the requirements of approved hometown plans and required states and cities to obtain the approval of the Secretary of Labor for plans affecting federal contracts.Delaney, Paul. \\"U.S. Set to Restrict State Hiring Plans.\\" New York Times. June 24, 1973. Furthermore, he froze federal funding for all building work in New York City until the city returned to the New York Plan.Johnson, \\"City Sees Threat In Brennan Memo,\\" New York Times, August 21, 1973. The federal government won the ensuing legal battle, and New York City's fiscal crisis meant that it had to abandon its affirmative action plans.Farrell, \\"NAACP to Fight U.S. Hiring Order,\\" New York Times, September 23, 1973. The Watergate crisis meant that the Nixon administration was unable to do much other than focus on survival. Brennan was unable to develop new initiatives during Nixon's abbreviated second term. President Gerald Ford instituted a general housecleaning among Cabinet officers, and asked Brennan to resign. Brennan did so on February 6, 1975, leaving in March. Ford offered to nominate Brennan to be ambassador to Ireland, but Brennan declined the offer.\\"Brennan Is Slated as Envoy to Ireland,\\" New York Times, January 3, 1975; \\"Labor Secretary Resigns His Post,\\" Associated Press, February 7, 1975.

Apart from some passages for soprano, its solistic interventions are modest; Schubert, characteristically, inclines toward a devotional mood. The First Mass had been successfully performed in the composer's parish the year before. Scoring and editions The Second was originally modestly scored, requiring only a string orchestra and organ in addition to the soprano, tenor and bass soloists and the choir. It was not printed until 1845, some years after Schubert's death, and until then remained one of his less-noted compositions (so much so that that first edition was usurped by one by Robert F√ºhrer, director of music at Prague's St. Vitus Cathedral, a man who eventually landed in prison for embezzlement). But a 1980s discovery at Klosterneuburg of a set of parts dated later than Schubert's full score suggests that his final thoughts about the work were on a grander scale, with trumpet and timpani parts added and minor changes throughout. (The discovery led to recordings of the work by Sony Classical and Carus Classics, in 1995 and 1996 respectively, and to Carus- Verlag's publishing of the enhanced score.) Separately, Schubert's brother Ferdinand wrote parts for woodwinds, brass and timpani in response to the work's popularity. Structure The mass consists of six movements.

Its Gaelic name translates as \\"the house on the ridge\\". It lies in Strathfillan, at the southern edge of Rannoch Moor. Location and facilities Tyndrum is a popular tourist village, and a noted stop on the A82 for road travellers to refresh at the Green Welly Stop or one of the several other cafes and hotels. There is a filling station. The village is on the West Highland Way, and has a campsite, hotel, bunkhouse and bed and breakfasts to accommodate walkers. Overshadowed by Ben Lui, a Munro, Tyndrum is built over the battlefield where Clan MacDougall defeated Robert the Bruce in AD 1306, and took from him the Brooch of Lorn. Railways The village is notable as a junction of transport routes. The West Highland Line railway from Glasgow splits approximately to the south at Crianlarich, with one branch heading to Fort William and the other to Oban. Tyndrum has a station on each branch: Upper Tyndrum on the Fort William line and Tyndrum Lower on the Oban line. Thus unusually there are two stations serving the same small village, only a few hundred yards apart, but about apart by rail. Indeed, Tyndrum is the smallest settlement in the UK with more than one railway station. This is partly a legacy of the history of the railways in the area, after two separate railways belonging to different railway companies were built through the village. However, the main reason is geography: splitting the line in Crianlarich allows the contours of the glen to be used to avoid very steep climbs heading north or west from Tyndrum. Roads mirror this division: the A82 from Glasgow to Fort William passes through Tyndrum, and the A85 to Oban splits off just north of the village. Mines Tyndrum is a former mining centre. The hamlet of Clifton (the row of cottages across the A82 from the Green Welly) is made up of the former mining cottages, and up the hillside beyond them the tailings of a former lead mine can be seen. The site of a proposed gold mine is to the south and west of Tyndrum at Cononish, above Cononish Farm. Work on constructing the mine began in the 1980s but low gold prices forced the closure of the mine before it became fully operational. In October 2011 it was announced that the mine would be reactivated. It was expected to employ 52 people and produce of gold and of silver over the next 10 years, thereby generating an estimated ¬£80 million for the Scottish economy. Following planning difficulties, which featured in the BBC Four programme Tales from the National Parks, and a fall in the price of gold, opening of the mine was again delayed. In an update on the project released by Scotgold in May 2015, total ore reserves are now estimated at of gold and of silver. Work is continuing to update capital and operating cost estimates and include opportunities for savings. This is expected to be complete by the end of July 2015.

The highway links the Darling Downs region with the urbanised outskirts of via Cunninghams Gap. The Cunningham carries the National Highway 15 shield between Ipswich and north of at its junction with the New England Highway at Glengallan where both the Cunningham and the New England head south concurrently to Warwick. Thereafter, the Cunningham carries the National Highway 42 shield to its south-western terminus with the Leichhardt Highway at Goondiwindi. The majority of the Cunningham Highway is a single carriageway with freeway standard and 6-lane arterial road standard towards its north-eastern terminus, near Ipswich. History The highway is named in honour of the explorer and botanist Allan Cunningham who followed a route close to where the modern-day highway runs. In 1828 after discovering the route Cunningham sent a report to Governor Ralph Darling emphasising the economic benefits that a link between the coast and pastoral lands of the Darling Downs would provide. The first road between the coast and the Darling Downs was Spicers Gap Road developed in 1859, which crossed the range at Spicer's Gap and was suitable for the drays used at that time. Although Cunningham's Gap was known at that time, it was considered too steep a route for drays. With the opening of the Southern railway line between Toowoomba and Warwick in 1871, passenger and goods transport switched to the railways and Spicers Gap Road fell into disuse and was not maintained well due to the cost. It was not until the advent of automobiles that a route through the steep Cunningham's Gap became feasible. The original road was built entirely by voluntary labour and Acting Queensland Premier, William Forgan Smith, officially opened on 11 June 1927, the 100-year anniversary of Allan Cunningham's supposed discovery of Cunningham's Gap. Actually, Cunningham discovered two gaps, Spicer's Gap on 11 June 1827 as he approached from the Darling Downs side and Cunningham's Gap on 21 August 1828 as he approached from Ipswich. However, Cunningham mistakenly believed he had found both sides of the same gap and not two different ones. This mistake was then perpetuated on the monument to Cunningham unveiled as part of the official opening of the road, as it gave 11 June 1827 as the discovery of Cunningham's Gap. The road was plagued by problems during this embryonic stage with the Royal Automobile Club of Queensland announcing that the road was closed, less than one month after it was officially opened. In 1935, the Mains Road Commission upgraded the road to highway and named it the Cunningham Highway. The new sealed road through the gap was eventually opened in November 1949. Route The north- eastern terminus of the Cunningham Highway is situated a short distance west of where the Warrego Highway reaches its eastern terminus with the Ipswich Motorway, at , a suburb of Ipswich. From this point, the Cunningham heads south-west as the Cunningham Motorway, bypassing to the south the Ipswich central business district, the original path of the highway, now named Warwick Road. The motorway transitions to the Cunningham Highway, and a further modern deviation takes the highway south of and RAAF Base Amberley through the Scenic Rim region including the towns and settlements of , the Fassifern Valley and . From this point, the Cunningham Highway begins its ascent across the Great Dividing Range via a mountain pass at an elevation of above sea level called Cunninghams Gap, situated in the Main Range National Park, between the peaks of Mount Cordeaux and Mount Mitchell.

Founded as the Gloucestershire Aircraft Company Limited during the First World War, with the aircraft construction activities of H H Martyn & Co Ltd of Cheltenham, England it produced fighters during the war. It was renamed later as foreigners found 'Gloucestershire' difficult to pronounce. It later became part of the Hawker Siddeley group and the Gloster name disappeared in 1963. Gloster designed and built several fighters that equipped the British Royal Air Force (RAF) during the interwar years including the Gladiator, the RAF's last biplane fighter. The company built most of the wartime production of Hawker Hurricanes and Hawker Typhoons for their parent company Hawker Siddeley while its design office was working on the first British jet aircraft, the E.28/39 experimental aircraft. This was followed by the Meteor, the RAF's first jet-powered fighter and the only Allied jet fighter to be put into service during the Second World War. History=1917 ‚Äì Formation In 1917, during the midst of the First World War, the Gloster Aircraft Company Limited was formed under the name The Gloucestershire Aircraft Company Limited.\\"Gloucestershire & Gloster Aircraft.\\" BAE Systems, Retrieved: 14 May 2017. At the time of its creation, its owners were Hugh Burroughes (1884‚Äì1985) and H H Martyn & Co Limited, who held a 50 per cent share between them, and aircraft manufacturer Airco held the other 50 per cent. On the company's board were A W Martyn, Burroughes, and George Holt Thomas of Airco. The firm quickly acquired the aircraft component construction activities that were previously being carried out by H H Martyn & Co Limited for the war effort in order to perform subcontracted work from Airco; the provision of additional production capacity had been a major motivating factor for Airco's involvement in founding the company. H H Martyn were architectural engineers and had produced items such as propellers before moving to whole fuselages for Airco.Until 1914 a firm of specialist woodworkers.page 108, Michael Stratton, Barrie Stuart Trinder, Twentieth Century Industrial ArchaeologyObituary, Mr Hugh Burroughes.

Bristol F.2B Fighter of No. 1 Squadron, Australian Flying Corps flown by Ross Smith in Palestine, February 1918. The firm rented facilities at Sunningend in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire to serve as their works. By the spring of 1918, the company was producing 45 new Bristol Fighter aircraft per week.Obituary, Mr Hugh Burroughes. The Times, Thursday, 31 October 1985; p. 16; Issue 62283.King 1955, p. 173. As the orders for aircraft increased, other companies in the Gloucester and Cheltenham district were contracted with work. Where any flying was involved, the aircraft would be transported (with wings detached) to a newly formed Air Board aircraft acceptance park at Brockworth, seven miles (11 km) away by motor transport. Although Brockworth Aerodrome was used by the company, it lacked any hangars until 1921, after which it would rent a portion of one hangar from the Air Board. Gradually, Gloucester would relocate its operational base to the Brockworth site. 1919 ‚Äì Interwar period Gloster Mars, a derivative of the Nieuport Nighthawk Following the Armistice of 11 November 1918 and the end of the First World War, the company suffered financial losses from the collapse of Airco, only receiving partial compensation for the cancellation of outstanding production orders. In 1920, following the closure of rival British aircraft manufacturer Nieuport & General, the services of its former chief designer, Henry Folland (1889‚Äì1954), were hired by the company; it also acquired the rights for the Nieuport Nighthawk fighter and various unassembled aircraft components. In December 1926, it was decided that the name of the company should be switched to a simplified form‚Äîthe Gloster Aircraft Company. This was reported because customers outside of the United Kingdom found it easier to pronounce and to spell. Typically, locals and employees simply referred to the company as GAC. With the move to metal construction, the Sunningend factory was soon deemed to be no longer suitable; accordingly, in 1928, Gloster purchased the aerodrome at Brockworth, including all of the adjacent hangars and neighbouring office accommodation. In 1934, Gloster was acquired by another British aircraft manufacturer, Hawker Aircraft. Regardless of this change in ownership, the company continued to produce aircraft under its own brand name. In that same year, Gloster produced one of its most famous aircraft, the Gladiator biplane. The 1935 merger of Hawker Aircraft and the interests of J. D. Siddeley (Armstrong Siddeley and Armstrong Whitworth Aircraft) saw Gloster become a part of Hawker Siddeley Aircraft, Ltd. 1939 ‚Äì Second World War  Hawker Typhoon during wartime, with black and white identification stripes under the wings At the outbreak of the Second World War, the firm lacked any modern designs of its own in production, but had significant expertise and production facilities available. Thus, Gloster undertook manufacture for Hawker-designed aircraft to equip the RAF on behalf of its parent company. During 1939, the company constructed 1,000 Hawker Hurricanes within the first 12 months of the conflict; Gloster delivered the last of its 2,750 Hurricanes in 1942. After ending production of the Hurricane, it was decided to manufacture the newer Hawker Typhoon in its place. Gloster proceeded to construct 3,300 in total, almost the entirety of the type. 1941 ‚Äì Arrival of the Turbojet Frank Whittle's memorial showing a full-scale model of the Gloster E28/39 Frank Whittle had first met Gloster's designer and test pilots in April 1939 and an official approach from the Air Ministry followed. As no existing aircraft was suitable for adaptation to take the new jet engine, and Gloster did not have much workload in its design department, Gloster received a contract in early 1940 ‚Äì to design and build Britain's first jet aircraft. Two airframes were built in secrecy. Due to the risk of bombing, one of the aircraft was built offsite from Brockworth at Regent Motors Cheltenham.Buttler, 2004 p190-191 On 15 May 1941, the first official test flight of the Gloster E.28/39 W 4041/G with a turbo-jet engine, invented by Sir Frank Whittle took off from RAF Cranwell (earlier taxying trials, in which the E.28/39 briefly became airborne, and therefore \\"flew\\", were carried out at the company's airfield at Brockworth).James 1971, pp.240‚Äì241. Although the E.28.39 could in theory be used as a fighter, a specific fighter design was required and Gloster began work on a twin engine jet design. Once the E.28/39 had flown, the Air Staff told Gloster to stop work on their F.18/40 nightfighter (other aircraft could be adapted to replace it) to concentrate on the jet fighter.Buttler 2004 p193 The jet design became the Gloster Meteor, the only jet to be used in combat by the Allied Forces during the Second World War. First flying with the RAF in 1943, the Meteor commenced operations in mid-1944, only some weeks later than the world's first operational jet, the German Messerschmitt Me 262. Crucially, it became the first RAF aircraft with a high enough top speed to enable it to fly alongside V1 flying bombs, tip them under the wing so as to render the V1's gyro incapable of recovery and the V1s crashed prematurely to earth in open countryside before they could reach London. 1945 ‚Äì Setting world airspeed records Meteor F.8 in flight at RAF Greenham Common, May 1986 In 1945, a Meteor F Mk.4 prototype, stripped of armament, achieved a World Airspeed Record of with Group Captain H. Wilson at the controls. During early 1946, another F Mk.4 prototype was used to set a world air speed record of 616 mph (991 km/h) true airspeed with Group Captain \\"Teddy\\" Donaldson flying the highly modified Meteor, nicknamed \\"Yellow Peril.\\" The second pilot in the High Speed Flight, Bill Waterton achieved 614 mph. During the record attempt Donaldson became the first man to break the 1,000 km/h barrier, winning the Britannia Trophy and a Bar to his AFC. Meteors remained in service with several air forces for many years and saw action in the Korean War with the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). Eventually, Gloster Meteors in fighter, trainer and night fighter versions were in operational use by 12 nations. 1947 ‚Äì Gloster's heyday During Gloster's heyday, in 1947, S/L Janusz Zurakowski was employed as an experimental pilot. In the following years, he became one of the world's most famous experimental and aerobatics pilots. He developed a new aerobatic manoeuvre, the \\"Zurabatic Cartwheel\\", which held the audience captivated as he suspended the Gloster Meteor G-7-1 prototype he was flying, in a vertical cartwheel at the 1951 Farnborough Air Show, a manoeuvre the announcer declared to be \\"Impossible!\\" Serving for a brief period as the chief test pilot, he tested the many experimental versions of the Gloster Meteor, Javelin and E.1/44 fighters. During the Gloster years, \\"Zura\\" as he came to be known, set an international speed record: London-Copenhagen-London, 4‚Äì5 April 1950 at Gloster's instruction to sell the aircraft to the Danish Air Force. Javelin FAW 7s of No. 64 Squadron RAF in 1959. In 1952, the two seat, delta winged Gloster Javelin was developed as an all weather fighter that could fly above at almost the speed of sound. This modern aircraft proved to be too heavy to take off from the short airfield in Brockworth, and was instead fitted out to the bare minimum and given a very small fuel load. It was then flown in a short hop to RAF Moreton Valence seven miles (11.27 km) to the south west, where the aircraft would be completed. It was this shortcoming of facilities, along with the rationalisation of the British aircraft industry, that would lead to the demise of Gloster. One blind alley was the work done (along with eight other British companies) on designing an aircraft to the same exacting Ministry specification that spawned the BAC TSR-2. The contract was issued to BAC but the Wilson Government cancelled the TSR2 project. 1960s ‚Äì Demise In 1961, the company was merged with Armstrong Whitworth Aircraft Limited to form Whitworth Gloster Aircraft Limited. Following another re-organisation, the firm became part of the Avro Whitworth Division of Hawker Siddeley Aviation in 1963, and the name Gloster disappeared as Hawker Siddeley rebranded its product line under its own name. In the late 1960s/early 1970s the Saunders-Roe Folly Works, by then owned by Hawker Siddeley was merged with the Gloster works to form Gloster-Saro utilising both companies' expertise in aluminium forming to produce fire appliances and tankers in the Gloster factory at Hucclecote, mostly based on Reynolds- Boughton chassis. In 1984 Gloster Saro acquired the fire tender business of the Chubb group with the company merging in 1987 with Simon Engineering to form Simon Gloster Saro.The company eventually was used to manufacture both alloy and, later, fibreglass fuel tankers for Companies such as Shell/BP. The site at Brockworth was sold in 1964. In recent years the runway and old buildings have been demolished and replaced by standard modern industrial estate and office buildings.

The exact constitutional status of the state during this period has been a matter of scholarly and political dispute. The Oireachtas removed all references to the monarch from the revised constitution in 1936, but under statute law the UK's monarch continued to play a role in foreign relations, though always on the advice of the Irish Government. The state did not officially describe itself as the Republic of Ireland until 1949, when it passed legislation giving itself that description.In the words of : \\"After the enactment of the 1936 External Relations Act and the 1937 Constitution, Ireland's only remaining link with the crown had been the accreditation of diplomats. The president of Ireland was the head of state. When opposition deputies asked de Valera whether Ireland was a republic‚Äîa favorite pastime in the mid-1940s‚Äîhe tended to resort to dictionary definitions showing that Ireland had all the attributes of a republic.\\" Background The state known today as Ireland is the successor- state to the Irish Free State which was established in December 1922. The Free State was governed, until at least 1936, under a form of constitutional monarchy. Under the Free State's constitution the King had a number of nominal duties, including exercising the executive authority of the state, appointing the cabinet and promulgating the law. However, all of these were delegated to the Governor-General of the Irish Free State, and in 1927 the King's title within Great Britain and Northern Ireland was changed by proclamation under the Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act passed by the Westminster Parliament to \\"George V, by the Grace of God, of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas King, Defender of the Faith, Emperor of India\\". Edward VIII and the abdication crisis In January 1936, George V died and was succeeded by his eldest son, who became Edward VIII. The new King's reign lasted only eleven months, and he abdicated in December of that year and was succeeded by his brother Prince Albert, Duke of York, who took the name George VI. The parliaments of independent members of the British Commonwealth were required to ratify this change in monarch, and the pro-republican government of the Irish Free State decided to use this opportunity to drastically change the constitution. Immediate post-abdication reforms (1936‚Äì37) The day after the abdication was announced on 12 December 1936, the Free State constitution was amended to remove all mention of the King and abolish the office of governor-general. The following day, a separate statute permitted the King to sign international treaties and to accredit diplomatic representatives, where authorised by the Irish government. In 1937 a new Constitution was adopted establishing the contemporary Irish state named simply \\"Ireland\\" and entrenching the monarch's diminished role, transferring many of the functions performed by the King until 1936 to a new office of President of Ireland, who was declared to \\"take precedence over all other persons in the State\\". However, the 1937 constitution did not explicitly declare that the state was a republic, nor that the President was head of state, and it allowed for the King to have a role in the state's external affairs. The state's ambiguous status ended in 1949, when the Republic of Ireland Act ended the King's remaining role in external affairs and declared that the state was a republic. The status of the Head of the Irish State from 1936 to 1949 was largely a matter of symbolism and had little practical significance. This was because the roles of both the King and the President of Ireland were merely ceremonial, being exercisable only \\"on the advice\\" of the government (Cabinet). However, one practical implication of explicitly declaring the state to be a republic in 1949 was that it automatically led to the state's termination of membership of the then British Commonwealth, in accordance with the rules in operation at the time (Until the London Declaration in 1950, only states with the British Monarch as their Head of state, generally represented by a Governor-general, could be members of the Commonwealth) Constitutional and legal changes of 1936 As founded in 1922, the Irish Free State was, like all other Dominions, a constitutional monarchy. It recognised the monarch of the United Kingdom as monarch of Ireland as well. However, most of the monarch's functions were performed on his behalf by the Governor-General, in practice on the advice of the Executive Council. This remained unchanged when the Statute of Westminster stripped away nearly all of the UK Parliament's authority to legislate for the Free State‚Äìeffectively making the Free State the first internationally recognised independent Irish state. This status remained unchanged until an amendment to the Free State constitution passed in 1936. The Constitution (Amendment No. 27) Act 1936 abolished the post of governor-general and transferred most of the monarch's functions to other organs of government. Thus, for example, the executive power was transferred directly to the Executive Council, the right to appoint the President of the Executive Council (head of government) was explicitly vested in D√°il √âireann (the lower house of parliament), and the power to promulgate legislation was transferred to the Ceann Comhairle (chairman) of the D√°il. However the constitutional amendment also provided, without mentioning the monarch specifically, for the state to be represented by him in external affairs with other countries and their representatives: The nations referred to in Article 1 were the other members of the then British Commonwealth (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, and the United Kingdom), who at that time all shared the same person as their monarch. The External Relations Act, adopted shortly after the constitutional amendment, gave life to this provision by providing that: Constitution of 1937 The Constitution of Ireland, adopted in 1937, filled the gap left by the abolition of the governor-general by creating the post of a directly elected president. The President of Ireland was henceforth responsible for the ceremonial functions of dissolving the legislature, appointing the government, and promulgating the law. Unlike most heads of state in parliamentary systems, the President was not even the nominal chief executive. Instead, the role of exercising executive authority was explicitly granted to the government‚Äîin practice, to the Taoiseach. The constitution also, like the 1922 constitution that preceded it, contained many provisions typical of those found in republican constitutions, stating, for example, that sovereignty resided in the people and prohibiting the granting of titles of nobility. Nonetheless the government of √âamon de Valera, despite its long-term goal of republicanising the Irish state, consciously chose not to declare a republic and decided to name the state simply √âire (or Ireland), rather than the \\"Republic of Ireland\\" or the \\"Irish Republic\\". Thus the new constitution did not explicitly declare that the President would be head of state, providing merely that he would \\"take precedence over all other persons in the State\\". Nor did the new document mention the word republic. Most crucially, Article 29 of the new constitution mirrored Article 51 of its predecessor, by permitting the state to allow its external relations to be exercised by the King. Article 29.4.2 provided that: This provision meant that the External Relations Act continued to have the force of law until the legislature decided otherwise, and so the monarch continued to represent the state abroad when empowered to do so. Debate Nonetheless from 1936 until 1949 the role of the King in the Irish state was invisible to most Irish people. The monarch never visited the state during that period and, due to the abolition of the office of governor- general, had no official representative there. The President, on the other hand, played a key role in important public ceremonies. Asked to explain the country's status in 1945, de Valera insisted that it was a republic. He told the D√°il that: Referring to the External Relations Act he insisted that: Despite de Valera's views, many political scholars consider representing a nation abroad to be the key defining role of a head of state. This view was echoed by the Taoiseach John A. Costello in a debate in Seanad √âireann (the Irish Senate) in December 1948, when he argued that the Republic of Ireland Bill he was introducing would make the President of Ireland the Irish head of state. Despite this conflict, de Valera's party, as the main opposition in the D√°il at the time, decided not to oppose Costello's bill. Republic of Ireland Act The Republic of Ireland Act 1948, which came into force on 18 April 1949, the 33rd anniversary of the beginning of the Easter Rising, was remarkable in that it purported to reform the state into a republic without making any change to the constitution, the ambiguous provisions of which remained unaltered. The Republic of Ireland Act contained three major provisions; it declared that: the External Relations Act was repealed, the state was a republic, and the external relations of the state would henceforth be exercised by the President. The act also had the effect of automatically terminating the state's membership of the Commonwealth. Soon after President Se√°n T. O'Kelly signed the act into law, he commemorated his new status as the clear and unambiguous Irish head of state with state visits to the Holy See and France. A visit to meet George VI at Buckingham Palace was also provisionally planned, but timetabling problems with the President's schedule prevented the meeting. King's title in the Irish state The King's title in the Irish Free State (1922‚Äì1937) and in Ireland (1937‚Äì1949) was the same as it was elsewhere in the Commonwealth, being: * 1922‚Äì1927: By the Grace of God, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British Dominions beyond the Seas King, Defender of the Faith, Emperor of India * 1927‚Äì1948: By the Grace of God, of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas King, Defender of the Faith, Emperor of India * 1948‚Äì1949: By the Grace of God, of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas King, Defender of the Faith The king's title during this period was never simply \\"King of Ireland\\". Traditionally, at least from the reign of William II, in England, and after the Union with Ireland, the monarch's style as king had included \\"by the grace of God\\". Initially, the English king's title in Ireland was \\"Lord of Ireland\\". The change from \\"Lord\\" to \\"King\\" of Ireland was made by the Crown of Ireland Act 1542 passed by the Irish Parliament, the same act describing it as being \\"united and knit to the imperial crown of the Realm of England\\". Soon after the passing of that act, the new title was proclaimed in London as: \\"Henry VIII, by the grace of God King of England, France, and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, and of the Church of England and also in Ireland in Earth the Supreme Head\\"; and this was confirmed by an act of ratification passed by the parliament in England in 1544.England: Royal Styles: 1521-1553 The opening words of Ireland's superseding constitution of 1937 were \\"In the Name of the Most Holy Trinity, from Whom is all authority and to Whom, as our final end, all actions both of men and States must be referred\\", and there was no mention in it of the king or monarch.In the second stage of the D√°il debates on the Constitution, the President, √âamon de Valera, said that the Preamble was \\"a clear, unequivocal statement that authority comes from God\\", which was \\"fundamental Catholic doctrine\\": D√°il Debates 13 May 1937 col 416-417, quoted in \\"In the name of the Most Holy Trinity\\" by Brian O‚ÄòReilly Parliamentary Debates, D√°il √âireann - Volume 67 - 13 May 1937, Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas, Dublin_ After India and Pakistan became independent dominions on 15 August 1947,Section 1 of the Indian Independence Act 1947 provided that from \\"the fifteenth day of August, nineteen hundred and forty-seven, two independent Dominions shall be set up in India, to be known respectively as India and Pakistan.\\" the title \\"Emperor of India\\" was officially abandoned on 22 June 1948, Royal Proclamation of 22 June 1948, made in accordance with the Indian Independence Act 1947, 10 & 11 GEO. 6. CH. 30.('Section 7: ...(2)The assent of the Parliament of the United Kingdom is hereby given to the omission from the Royal Style and Titles of the words \\" Indiae Imperator \\" and the words \\" Emperor of India \\" and to the issue by His Majesty for that purpose of His Royal Proclamation under the Great Seal of the Realm.'). According to this Royal Proclamation, the King retained the Style and Titles 'George VI by the Grace of God, of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas King, Defender of the Faith', and he thus remained King of the various Dominions, including India and Pakistan, though these two (and others) eventually chose to abandon their monarchies and became republics. although George VI remained monarch of India until 26 January 1950, when India became a republic within the Commonwealth, the first Commonwealth country to do so. Outside the Irish state, \\"Great Britain, Ireland\\" was not officially omitted in the royal title until 1953. Then, each Commonwealth realm adopted a unique title for the monarch. No mention of Ireland was made in any except in the title within the United Kingdom and its dependent territories: it was changed from \\"of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas Queen\\" to \\"of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of Her other Realms and Territories Queen\\".

The shooter was Wade Frankum, who killed himself as police arrived at the scene. The incident left eight dead and six wounded. Perpetrator Wade Frankum was born in 1958 and had worked at various occupations including as a retail assistant. In the apartment where Frankum lived alone,(18 August 1991). A Masked Gunman Kills 6 at a Mall in Australia, The New York Times police found a large collection of violent literature and video copies of violent films. One of his books was a well-thumbed copy of American Psycho and although there is no direct evidence that the controversial novel had inspired Frankum, a number of suggestions that it had done so were made in newspapers . Frankum also owned a copy of Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment. Investigators suggested that both his reading and viewing habits contributed to this motivation for the shooting. Rampage At around 1:00 p.m., 33-year-old Frankum went to Strathfield Plaza, a shopping mall in the Inner West of Sydney. He sat in a caf√© called The Coffee Pot, where he drank a number of cups of coffee. At approximately 3:30 p.m., apparently without provocation, Frankum pulled a large knife from an army surplus duffel bag and repeatedly stabbed one of two teenage girls who were sitting behind him, killing the girl. Leaving the knife in the body of the girl, he pulled a Chinese-made SKS semi-automatic rifle out of his duffel and shot around the caf√©, killing several more people. He then shot the caf√©'s owner dead and fled into the main area of the mall, where he killed his last victim. Frankum ran into the rooftop car park and held a car owner at gunpoint, demanding that she take him to Enfield, a nearby suburb. Before the woman could start her car, police began to arrive on the scene with Constable Darren Stewart the first to arrive. He was shot at in his police car by Frankum from the car park rooftop, Stewart had run through the Strathfield shopping centre to engage Frankum, but, upon arriving at the carpark rooftop, Frankum shot numerous rounds into the door leading to the carpark, pinning down Stewart. Upon hearing more approaching sirens, Frankum apologised to the woman and then got out of the car, knelt on the ground, and committed suicide by shooting himself in the head. Victims Frankum's shooting spree lasted around 10 minutes. He killed seven people and injured six, none of them personally known to him. Victims: *Roberta Armstrong, age 15 *Robertson Kan Hock Voon, age 51 *Patricia Rowe, age 37 *Carole Dickinson, age 47 *Joyce Nixon, age 61 *Rachell Milburn, age 17 *George Mavris, age 51(17 August 2011).

Although naturally right-footed, he played as a left wing-back (his favourite position) or, more commonly, as a left-back. He had spells with both AC Milan and Inter Milan, also spending a season at Barcelona. In his early career, Coco showed much promise and was regarded as a possible successor to Paolo Maldini; however, he failed to live up to expectations.What happened to Francesco Coco, once Clarence Seedorf‚Äôs equal? Planetfootball.com, 19 October 2018 Coco won two Serie A league titles, and represented Italy at the 2002 FIFA World Cup. Club career Born in Patern√≤, Coco spent the majority of his club career with the Milan clubs; first with A.C. Milan between 1993 and 2002 and later with Inter between 2002 and 2007; he spent the 2001‚Äì02 season on loan at FC Barcelona, with generally solid performances (he also had loan spells with Vicenza Calcio and Torino F.C.). He was part of the Milan teams that won the Serie A in 1995‚Äì96 and 1998‚Äì99. In 2002, Milan traded Coco to Inter in a part exchange deal for Clarence Seedorf, worth ‚Ç¨28 million. Despite reaching the 2002‚Äì03 Champions League semi-finals and winning the 2004‚Äì05 Coppa Italia, Coco's spell at Inter was blighted by injuries. Coco has since given interviews stating the Nerazzurri made a mistake by letting him undergo back surgery in November 2003, telling him he would be out for no more than a month. In the end he had to recover for two years. In 2005‚Äì06, he was loaned to Livorno, after rejecting a move to Newcastle United despite playing a friendly against Yeading F.C. where he impressed in a 5‚Äì0 home victory. He played one season at Livorno, and after his loan deal he returned to Inter. During the summer of 2006 he tried to find a new club, but in the end all negotiations failed and Coco remained at Inter. In January 2007, he joined English club Manchester City on a trial but after three days the club told him he was not in their plans. Later the English newspapers alleged that Manchester City was no longer interested in him because he had turned up for training smoking a cigarette.\\"Fuma durante l'allenamento\\" Il Manchester City liquida Coco ‚Äì Calcio ‚Äì Sport ‚Äì Repubblica.it After a loan to Torino for the 2006‚Äì07 season, he went back to Inter for the first part of the summer but mutually rescinded his contract with the Milan-based club on 7 September 2007., Later Coco declared his intention to quit football in order to pursue an acting career despite the rumoured interest of MLS sides New England Revolution and New York Red Bulls. International career Coco played for the Italy U18 team in the intermediary round of the 1995 European Under-18 Football Championship and for the Italy U21 team at the 1996 and 1998 UEFA U-21 Championship qualifying phases, playing also in the final round in the successful 2000 campaign under manager Marco Tardelli. Also, Coco played for the victorious Italy U23 team at the 1997 Mediterranean Games. Coco's full debut for the Italy national football team came in a 3‚Äì0 win against Romania, on 7 October 2000, in a 2002 World Cup qualifying match under Giovanni Trapattoni. He also played for Italy in 2002 FIFA World Cup, and was last called up to the national side in September 2002. He achieved a total of 17 caps with the azzurri. Style of play Coco was a quick, physical, and tactically versatile player, who was primarily deployed as an offensive-minded fullback or as a wingback, due to his tenacity, and work-rate, as well as his defensive and offensive attributes. Although he was naturally right footed, he was also capable of playing both on the right and the left flank, and was known for his strong tackling, physicality, determination, and crossing ability with both feet. Due to his pace, stamina, skill, and technique, he was also occasionally utilised as a wide midfielder in a 3‚Äì5‚Äì2 or 3‚Äì4‚Äì3 formation. Despite his talent, he was often injury-prone and inconsistent, while he had a difficult character and lacked discipline off the pitch; his chances were often limited both at club and international level, due to the presence of Paolo Maldini in his position, whom Coco had initially been tipped to replace as Milan and Italy's starting left-back. Off the field Coco was not only a football player but also a businessman. Together with his father Antonio, they own shops and he has his own clothing label called \\"Urban 77\\". Coco is a celebrity in Italy and is well known in the party and society scene in Italy. He also wrote the foreword for the recently published book Mio marito √® un calciatore (My husband is a footballer). Coco also famously had a long relationship with the Italian actress, showgirl, and model Manuela Arcuri. Following his retirement from professional football, Coco stated that he was interested in pursuing an acting career, and accepted to appear in L'Isola dei Famosi, the Italian celebrity adaptation of the TV format Survivor, which he abandoned voluntarily days after the beginning of the show.

It lies within the Altm√ºhl Valley. The local area is famous in geology and palaeontology for Solnhofen limestone. This is a very fine-grained limestone from the Jurassic period which is an exceptionally fine Lagerst√§tte that preserves detailed fossil specimens. Alois Senefelder used specially prepared blocks of the fine Solnhofen limestone for the process of lithography which he invented in 1798. The quarrying of this lithographic limestone subsequently yielded spectacular finds, including Archaeopteryx, commemorated in the bird's full name Archaeopteryx lithographica. All 13 known specimens have come from the Solnhofen area.  Geography  Solnhofen is located on the Altm√ºhl in Bavaria. It contains two districts: Hochholz and E√ülingen. It is adjacent to the cities Pappenheim, Langenaltheim and M√∂rnsheim.  History  The Sola- Basilica Solnhofen was known as \\"Husen\\" in the 8th century. In 750/51 Saint Solus created a church there. On this church, the grave church of him (Sola- Basilika) was built later. In honor of him Husen was renamed in \\"Solnhofen\\". In 1420 Solnhofen was burnt down during the Bavarian War. It also suffered through the Thirty Years' War. From 1649 to the 18th century there was a glass industry in Solnhofen.

Following the Jesuit expulsion, mission activity continued under Franciscan auspices. Roughly 60 missions were founded in total. Scholar Anne Christine Taylor notes that, '[o]f all the western Amazonian mission establishments, that of the Jesuits of Mainas was by far the most important'. She estimates that, at its zenith, the mission field had a population of approximately 200,000. However, throughout their existence, the Jesuit mission settlements‚Äîknown as reductions‚Äîwere marked by epidemic disease (often smallpox) that exacted a tremendous death toll on the indigenous peoples installed in them. 'Maynas' or 'Mainas' refers to the Maina people, indigenous to the area around the Mara√±√≥n River. The area in which the missions were conducted is now largely coextensive with Maynas Province, Peru, which borders Ecuador. The Jivaro, Kokama, Cambeba, Secoya, and Yame were among the other indigenous peoples the missionaries sought to convert.  History  The Mainas missions were one element of the broader Spanish colonial project in the Americas. Taylor characterizes the object of the missions as 'pav[ing] the way for the spread of colonial institutions through cultural means'‚Äîusing religious and other ideological tools to induce indigenous people to conform to colonial priorities. The missions were not completely allied to the colonial state, however. The Jesuits sought to convert indigenous forms of government into reductions, whereas the colonial governors aimed to subject them to the encomienda or repartimiento systems of labour extraction. At times, then, there was conflict between the religious orders and the state with regard to control over the indigenous population. Thus, the two organizations were allied in complex ways in the Western Amazon from the 17th to 19th centuries. Our knowledge of the Mainas missions derives largely from missionaries' own accounts of their activities. Thus, as Newson notes, a complete account is 'difficult to establish in detail'.  Rebellion  The immediate impetus for missionary work in the region was a 1635 (or 1637, or 1640) rebellion by the Maina people against Spanish colonialists. The Maina rebelled against the encomienda system, a system analogous to slavery which 'gave individual Spaniards the right to demand labor and tribute from the Indians assigned to them ‚Ä¶ and also turned them into de facto administrators, responsible for the control and the welfare of these Indians'. Reeve describes the system, as practised in the early 17th century in Mainas, as 'exceedingly harsh': the vast majority of indigenous peoples co-opted into Mainas encomiendas died, and the colonial government used military force to put down those who had not been brought into the system. The colonial strategy changed around 1636‚Äì38, however. According to Clements Markham, Pedro Vaca de Vega (known as Don Pedro Vaca and styled Governador de los Maynas), the colonial governor of Mainas province, had 'despaired of subjugating the Indians by force' and hoped that the Jesuits 'might succeed in tranquillizing them by persuasion'. Accordingly, he hoped to bring Jesuit missionaries to the area. Reeve concurs, suggesting that the governor's change of heart was due to the recent history of violence in the area.  17th century  Mara√±√≥n by Samuel Fritz, who was superior of the Mainas missions in the early 18th century. Two missionaries, then at Quito, initially responded to Vaca's request for mission-founders: Father Lucas de la Cueva (known as Father Cueva) and Father Cujia. Fathers Cueva and Cujia arrived at Borja on , not long after the city was founded in 1619. Mission activity began in the area around Borja, in the valley of the Huallaga River (a tributary of the Mara√±√≥n). The Jesuits sought to 'induc[e]' indigenous peoples to settle in reductions, as opposed to their traditional modes of habitation and forms of government. This would have been a difficult assignment in the best of circumstances, coming as it did shortly after a violent rebellion. More so, because although the Jesuits would ultimately found 'dozens' of missions in the region, there were not many missionaries to go around. Nonetheless, by 1660, the Jesuits had 'catechized' around 10,000 people. Newson estimates that this was about 10‚Äì15 percent of the indigenous population in the region at the time. The missions were backed by colonial forces. The Jesuits travelled with soldiers, and the colonial governor would periodically send his forces on entradas‚Äîa missionary's initial attempt to establish contact with those he sought to convert, using 'food and gifts' as inducement. Reeve notes that the missionaries were largely dependent on 'indigenous guides and interpreters' in seeking out new fields for expansion: guides would bring the Jesuits to territories their people knew well, or with which their people were allied. She observes, then, that '[t]o a remarkable degree, the process of proselytization and mission formation followed indigenous alliance networks across the region'.  18th century  The (in mustard yellow), a district of the Viceroyalty of Peru, as it appeared . Missions were dispersed throughout this area. Samuel Fritz served as superior of the Mainas missions from 1704‚Äì12. Fritz sought to expand the missions further outwards, which provoked trouble with Portuguese slave traders. After the Jesuits were expelled in 1767, Maynas came under the control of Franciscans.  19th century  There was evidently a mission infrastructure in Mainas as late as the 1850s. William Lewis Herndon, exploring the Amazon for the United States Navy, described missions in the Mainas region that traded various goods with Brazil. He further noted: > I know of no legal establishment in the Missions‚Äîthe law proceeding out of > the mouths of the governors. Indians are punished by flogging or confinement > in the stocks; whites are sometimes imprisoned; but if their offence is of a > grave nature, they are sent to be tried and judged by the courts of the > capital. Herndon also observed that the indigenous inhabitants of the Mainas missions, unique among the 'Indians of Peru', had been exempted from the payment of a head tax, because 'these people had the forest to subdue, and were only able to wring a hard-earned support from the cultivation of the land'. He remarked that white settlers objected to this, and thought that 'some law compelling them to work' would be preferable.  Effects  Disease and slavery were common in the Mainas missions. Over the 129 years of Jesuit missionary activity in the Mainas region, numerous epidemics of smallpox and other diseases exacted a severe toll on indigenous peoples. Slave raids, whereby Portuguese colonialists, known as bandeirantes, would capture and enslave indigenous people, were frequent throughout the period. Fritz's tenure in the Mainas missions, in particular, was marked by a number of Portuguese slave raids.

The Bulgarian Exarchate ( B«élgarska ekzarhiya, ) was the official name of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church before its autocephaly was recognized by the Ecumenical See in 1945 and the Bulgarian Patriarchate was restored in 1953. The Exarchate (a de facto autocephaly) was unilaterally (without the blessing of the Ecumenical Patriarch) promulgated on , in the Bulgarian church in Constantinople in pursuance of the firman of Sultan Abd√ºlaziz of the Ottoman Empire. The foundation of the Exarchate was the direct result of the struggle of the Bulgarian Orthodox against the domination of the Greek Patriarchate of Constantinople in the 1850s and 1860s. In 1872, the Patriarchate accused the Exarchate that it introduced ethno-national characteristics in the religious organization of the Orthodox Church, and the secession from the Patriarchate was officially condemned by the Council in Constantinople in September 1872 as schismatic. Nevertheless, Bulgarian religious leaders continued to extend the borders of the Exarchate in the Ottoman Empire by conducting plebiscites in areas contested by both Churches.From Rum Millet to Greek and Bulgarian Nations: Religious and National Debates in the Borderlands of the Ottoman Empire, 1870‚Äì1913, Theodora Dragostinova , Ohio State University, Columbus. In this way, in the struggle for recognition of a separate Church, the modern Bulgarian nation was created under the name Bulgar Millet.A Concise History of Bulgaria, R. J. Crampton, Cambridge University Press, 2005, , p. 74. National awakening In 1762, Saint Paisius of Hilendar (1722‚Äì1773), a monk from the south-western Bulgarian town of Bansko, wrote Istoriya Slavyanobolgarskaya (\\"History of the Slav- Bulgarians\\"), a short historical work which was also the first ardent call for a national awakening. In History of Slav-Bulgarians, Paisius urged his compatriots to throw off subjugation to the Greek language and culture. The example of Paisius was followed by others, including Saint Sophroniy of Vratsa (1739‚Äì1813), Abbot Spiridon of Gabrovo (died 1815), Abbot Yoakim Karchovski (died 1820), and Abbot Kiril Peychinovich (died 1845). Struggle for church autonomy The result of the work of Paisius and his followers began before long to give fruit. Discontent with the supremacy of the Greek clergy started to flare up in several Bulgarian dioceses as early as the 1820s. It was not, however, until the 1850 that the Bulgarians initiated a purposeful struggle against the Greek clerics in a number of bishoprics demanding their replacement with Bulgarian ones as well as other changes such as the use of Bulgarian in liturgy and fixed salaries for bishops. By that time, most Bulgarian religious leaders had realised that any further struggle for the rights of the Bulgarians in the Ottoman Empire could not succeed unless they managed to obtain at least some degree of autonomy from the Patriarchate of Constantinople. As the Ottomans identified nationality (ethnicity) with confession and the majority of ethnic Bulgarians were Orthodox Christians, they were automatically included in the R≈´m millet, a community ruled immediately by the Ecumenical Patriarch in his capacity of millet-bashi and dominated by Phanar Greeks (Phanariots). Thus, if the Bulgarians wanted to have Bulgarian schools and liturgy in Bulgarian, they needed an autonomous ecclesiastical organisation. The struggle between the Bulgarians, led by Neofit Bozveli and Ilarion Stoyanov, and the Phanariotes intensified throughout the 1860s. As the Greek clerics were ousted from most Bulgarian bishoprics at the end of the decade, the whole of northern Bulgaria, as well as the northern parts of Thrace and Macedonia had, to all intents and purposes, seceded from the Patriarchate. Establishment of the Bulgarian Exarchate Firman of Sultan Abd√ºlaziz for the establishment of the Bulgarian Exarchate. Map of the Bulgarian Exarchate (1870‚Äì1913). In seeking to calm down the disturbances, the Ottoman government of the Sultan Abd√ºlaziz granted the right to establish an autonomous Bulgarian Exarchate for the dioceses of Bulgaria as well as those, wherein at least two-thirds of Orthodox Christians were willing to join it, by issuing the Sultan's firman promulgated on . The firman envisaged a broad autonomy of the Exarchate but would leave it under the supreme canonical authority of the Ecumenical See, i.e. not full autocephaly. The Exarchate's borders went on to extend over present-day northern Bulgaria (Moesia), most of northern Thrace, as well as over north- eastern Macedonia. After the Christian population of the bishoprics of Skopje and Ohrid voted in 1874 overwhelmingly in favour of joining the Exarchate (Skopje by 91%, Ohrid by 97%)–¶—ä—Ä–∫–≤–∞ –∏ —Ü—ä—Ä–∫–æ–≤–µ–Ω –∂–∏–≤–æ—Ç –≤ –ú–∞–∫–µ–¥–æ–Ω–∏—è, –ü–µ—Ç—ä—Ä –ü–µ—Ç—Ä–æ–≤, –•—Ä–∏—Å—Ç–æ –¢–µ–º–µ–ª—Å–∫–∏, –ú–∞–∫–µ–¥–æ–Ω—Å–∫–∏ –ù–∞—É—á–µ–Ω –ò–Ω—Å—Ç–∏—Ç—É—Ç, –°–æ—Ñ–∏—è, 2003 –≥. the Bulgarian Exarchate became in control of the whole of Vardar and Pirin Macedonia. The Exarchate was also represented in the whole of Greek Macedonia and the Vilayet of Adrianople by vicars. Thus, the borders of the Exarchate included all Bulgarian districts in the Ottoman Empire. Bulgarian schism  Ethnic composition of the central Balkans in 1870. The first (after Hilarion of Lovech had to resign before being confirmed by the government) Bulgarian Exarch was Antim I who was elected by the Holy Synod of the Exarchate on . On , in the Bulgarian St. Stephen Church in Constantinople, which had been closed by the Ecumenical Patriarch's order, Antim I, along with other Bulgarian hierarchs who were then restricted from all priestly ministries, celebrated a liturgy, whereafter he declared autocephaly of the Bulgarian Church. The Patriarchal Synod reacted by defrocking Antim I and excommunicating others, including Ilarion Stoyanov. Tsarevna Miladinova's Bulgarian boarding-school for girls in Thessaloniki, 1882‚Äì1883 The decision on the unilateral declaration of autocephaly by the Bulgarian Church was not accepted by the Patriarchate of Constantinople. The subsequent Council in Constantinople, chaired by Ecumenical Patriarch Anthimus VI, in September 1872, wherein the Patriarchs of Alexandria, Antioch and Jerusalem (the latter declined to sign the Council's decisions) also participated, declared on September 18 (September 30The date according to –°.-–ü–µ—Ç–µ—Ä–±—É—Ä–≥—Å–∫i—è –≤—£–¥–æ–º–æ—Å—Ç–∏, September 20, 1871, ‚Ññ 258, page 3.) the Bulgarian Exarchate schismatic and declared its adherents excommunicated. The latter were accused of having ‚Äúsurrendered Orthodoxy to ethnic nationalism‚Äù, which had been qualified as a heresy - \\"ethnophyletism\\" (ŒµŒ∏ŒΩŒøœÜœÖŒªŒµœÑŒπœÉŒºœåœÇ). Furthermore on January 21st 1872, on request of the Patriarch and under the influence of Count Nikolai Ignatiev, then an influential Russian Ambassador in Constantinople, the Ottoman government sent into exile in Izmir, Anatolia three Bulgarian clerks Hilarion of Makariopolis, Panaret of Plovdiv and Hilarion of Lovech. The energetic protests of the Bulgarian community in Istanbul, reverts the decision short after. The Russian Most Holy Synod claimed neutrality, but the Russian government, represented by Count Nikolai Ignatiev, actively mediated in the Greek-Bulgarian dispute. The unity of the Orthodox Church was instrumental for Russian's political interests in the Orthodox world. The attempts though to satisfy the Greek Patriarchate by reducing the territories of the Bulgarian Exarchate (noticeably Vardar, Pirin and Greek Macedonia), proved fruitless and against the Bulgarian interests. Simeon Radev, \\"The Builders of Modern Bulgaria\\", volume 1, chapter 3, The Russian Politics and The Bulgarian Church Seal of Bulgarian-Exarchate, 1872 Exarch Antim I was discharged by the Ottoman government immediately after the outbreak of the Russo-Turkish War (1877‚Äì1878) on April 24, 1877, and was sent into exile in Ankara. Under the guidance of his successor, Joseph I, the Exarchate managed to develop and considerably extend its church and school network in the Bulgarian Principality, Eastern Rumelia, Macedonia and the Adrianople Vilayet. In 1879, the Tarnovo Constitution formally established the Bulgarian Orthodox Church as the national religion of the nation. On the eve of the Balkan Wars in 1912, in the Ottoman Macedonian vilayets and the Adrianople Vilayet alone, the Bulgarian Exarchate had seven dioceses with prelates and eight more with acting chairmen in charge and 38 vicariates, 1,218 parishes and 1,310 parish priests, 1331 churches, 73 monasteries and 234 chapels, as well as 1,373 schools with 2,266 teachers and 78,854 pupils. Almost all of the schoolmasters had been born in Macedonia and Adrianople Thrace.Prof. Voin Bozhinov, \\"Bulgarian education in Macedonia and the Adrianople region of Thrace (1878‚Äì1913)\\", Publishing house of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Sofia, 1982, p. 356 (in Bulgarian). The immediate effect of the partition of the Ottoman Empire during the Balkan Wars was the anti-Bulgarian campaign in areas under Serbian and Greek rule. The Serbians expelled Exarchist churchmen and teachers and closed Bulgarian schools and churches (affecting the standing of as many as 641 schools and 761 churches). Thousands of Bulgarian refugees left for Bulgaria, joining an even larger stream from the devastated Aegean Macedonia, where the Greeks burned Kukush, the center of Bulgarian politics and culture. Bulgarian language (including the Macedonian dialects) was prohibited, and its surreptitious use, whenever detected, was ridiculed or punished.Ivo Banac, \\"The Macedoine\\" in \\"The National Question in Yugoslavia.

Bulgarian Men's High School of Thessaloniki in the beginning of the 20th century After World War I, by virtue of the peace treaties, the Bulgarian Exarchate was deprived of its dioceses in Macedonia and Aegean Thrace. Exarch Joseph I transferred his offices from Constantinople to Sofia as early as 1913. After the death of Joseph I in 1915, the Bulgarian Orthodox Church was not in a position to elect its regular head for a total of three decades. Conditions for the restoration of the Bulgarian Patriarchate and the election of head of the Bulgarian Church were created after World War II. In 1945 the schism was lifted and the Patriarch of Constantinople recognised the autocephaly of the Bulgarian Church. In 1950, the Holy Synod adopted a new Statute which paved the way for the restoration of the Patriarchate and in 1953, it elected the Metropolitan of Plovdiv, Cyril, Bulgarian Patriarch.Daniela Kalkandjieva, ‚ÄúThe Restoration of the Patriarchal Dignity of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church,‚Äù Bulgarian Historical Review, Sofia, vol. 4, (1994): 101‚Äì105.

In a psychiatric context, dysphoria may accompany depression, anxiety, or agitation. The term is often used to refer to gender dysphoria, experienced by people whose gender identity does not align with their assigned sex. In psychiatry Intense states of distress and unease increase the risk of suicide, as well as being unpleasant in themselves. Relieving dysphoria is therefore a priority of psychiatric treatment. One may treat underlying causes such as depression or bipolar disorder as well as the dysphoric symptoms themselves. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) categorizes specific dysphoria in the obsessive‚Äìcompulsive spectrum. Dissatisfaction with being able-bodied can be diagnosed as body integrity dysphoria in the ICD-11. Gender dysphoria Gender dysphoria is discomfort, unhappiness, or distress due to one's assigned sex. The current edition (DSM-5) of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders uses the term \\"gender dysphoria\\" where it previously referred to \\"gender identity disorder\\", making it clear that they no longer consider the gender identity to be disordered, but rather the emotional state of distress which results from the gender identity. Related conditions The following conditions may include dysphoria as a symptom: *Major depressive disorder (unipolar) and dysthymia *Bipolar disorder and cyclothymia *Borderline personality disorderBorderline personality disorder *Premenstrual syndrome *Premenstrual dysphoric disorder *Dysphoric milk ejection reflex *Stress *Adjustment disorder with depressed mood *Anxiety disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder *Dysphoric rumination *Dissociative disorders such as dissociative identity disorder, dissociative amnesia, and depersonalization disorder. *Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder *Mixed anxiety-depressive disorder *Gender dysphoria *Personality disorders such as borderline personality disorder, dependent personality disorder, and antisocial personality disorder *Substance withdrawal *Body dysmorphic disorder *Akathisia *Hypoglycemia *Schizophrenia *Sexual dysfunction *Body integrity dysphoria *Insomnia *Chronic pain Drug-induced (dysphoriants) Some drugs can produce dysphoria, including Œ∫-opioid receptor agonists like salvinorin A (the active constituent of the hallucinogenic plant Salvia divinorum), butorphanol, and pentazocine, Œº-opioid receptor antagonists such as naltrexone and nalmefene, and antipsychotics like haloperidol and chlorpromazine (via blockade of dopamine receptors), among others.

T. Barnum. Childhood and early life Stratton at 10 years of age Born January 4, 1838, in Bridgeport, Connecticut, Stratton was the son of a carpenter named Sherwood Edward Stratton, who in turn was the son of Seth Sherwood Stratton and Amy Sharpe. Sherwood married his first cousin Cynthia Thompson, daughter of Joseph Thompson and Mary Ann Sharpe. Charles Stratton's maternal and paternal grandmothers, Amy and Mary Ann Sharpe, were stated to be small twin girls born on July 11, 1781/83 in Oxford, New Haven, Connecticut. Born in Bridgeport to parents who were of medium height, Charles was a relatively large baby, weighing at birth. He developed and grew normally for the first six months of his life, at which point he was tall and weighed . Then he suddenly stopped growing. His parents became concerned when, after his first birthday, they noticed he had not grown at all in the previous six months. They showed him to their doctor, who said there was little chance Charles would ever reach normal height. By late 1842 (4 years old), Stratton had grown only one inch from when he was six months old. Apart from this, he was a completely normal, healthy child, with several siblings who were of average size. His body was proportionate and functional. Adoption by Barnum The Fairy Wedding group: Stratton and his bride Lavinia Warren, alongside her sister Minnie and George Washington Morrison Nutt (\\"Commodore Nutt\\"); entertainers associated with P.T. Barnum. Phineas T. Barnum heard about Stratton and after contacting his parents, taught the boy how to sing, dance, mime, and impersonate famous people. Barnum also went into business with Stratton's father, who died in 1855. Stratton made his first tour of America at the age of five, with routines that included impersonating characters such as Cupid and Napoleon Bonaparte as well as singing, dancing, and comical banter with another performer who acted as a straight man. It was a huge success and the tour expanded. A year later, Barnum took young Stratton on a tour of Europe, making him an international celebrity. Stratton appeared twice before Queen Victoria. He also met the three-year-old future King Edward VII, at that time the Prince of Wales. In 1845, he triumphed at the Th√©√¢tre du Vaudeville (France) in the play Le petit Poucet of Dumanoir and Clairville. The tour was a huge success, with crowds mobbing him wherever he went. After his three-year tour in Europe, Stratton began his rise to stardom in the United States. Stratton's fame grew at an astonishing rate, and his popularity and celebrity surpassed that of any actor within his lifetime. On his return home from his second tour in 1847, aboard the SS Cambria, he attracted the attention of the explorer John Palliser who \\"was not a little surprised, on entering the state-cabin, to hear the most unnatural shrill little pipe exclaiming, 'Waiter! bring me a Welsh rabbit'.\\"Palliser, John. 1853. Solitary Rambles and Adventures of a Hunter in the Prairies, John Murray, London, 326 p. During the voyage, General Tom Thumb contributed to a collection for the relief of famine victims in Ireland.Christine Kinealy, 'Charity and the Great Hunger. The kindness of Strangers' (London: Bloomsbury, 2013). Stratton's first performances in New York marked a turning point in the history of freak show entertainment. Before Stratton's debut, the presentation of \\"human curiosities\\" for entertainment was deemed dishonorable and seen as an unpleasing carnival attraction. However, after viewers were introduced to Stratton and performances, he was able to change the perception people held toward freak shows. Stratton's lively and entertaining performances made these types of carnival shows one of the most favored forms of theatrical entertainment in the United States. From the age of seven, Stratton performed in grand full-length fairytale melodramas under the management of P.T. Barnum. A few of the melodramas that Stratton performed were Hop O' My Thumb and the Seven League Boots. In these melodramas, Stratton was assigned the title role, which he played on multiple occasions. While Barnum sought to capitalize on Stratton's small stature, he also aimed to highlight and showcase his many true gifts as a performer. For example, Stratton was noted to be clever in his acts. Also, he was a talented actor, singer, dancer, and comedian. As a result, certain dramatic critics did not compare his skills to those of the freak show community of which he was a member but preferred to judge him on his merits as a professional entertainer. In 1846 he started to grow for the first time since the first few months of his life, but extremely slowly. In January 1851 Stratton stood exactly tall. On his 18th birthday, he was measured at tall. On his 21st birthday he was 86 cm tall. Stratton became a Freemason on October 3, 1862. Stratton, by now tall, was initiated to be a Freemason alongside a man who was .10,000 Famous Freemasons, William R. Denslow. Missouri Lodge of Research, Trenton, Missouri:1957‚Äì1961, vol 4. p. 200. Marriage and later life The wedding couple as they appeared on the February 21, 1863 cover of Harper's Weekly magazine. Tom Thumb wedding gift photo album His marriage in 1863 to Lavinia Warren, also a little person, became front-page news. The wedding took place at Grace Episcopal Church, and the wedding reception was held at New York City's Metropolitan Hotel. The couple stood atop a grand piano at the reception to greet some 10,000 guests. The best man at the wedding was George Washington Morrison (\\"Commodore\\") Nutt, another dwarf performer in Barnum's employ. The maid of honor was Minnie Warren, Lavinia's sister. Following the wedding, the couple was received by President Lincoln at the White House. Stratton and his wife toured together in Europe as well as British India, in particular the area that would later become Bangladesh. Under Barnum's management, Stratton became a wealthy man. He owned a house in the fashionable part of New York and a steam yacht, and he had a wardrobe of fine clothes. He also owned a specially adapted home on one of Connecticut's Thimble Islands. When Barnum got into financial difficulty, Stratton bailed him out. Later, they became business partners. Stratton made his final appearance in England in 1878. On January 19, 1883, Stratton was staying at John F. Antisdel's Newhall House in Milwaukee when a fire broke out, which Milwaukee historian John Gurda would call \\"one of the worst hotel fires in American history\\". More than 71 people died, but Tom and Lavinia were saved by their manager, Sylvester Bleeker.P.T.

Death and legacy Stratton's grave at Mountain Grove Cemetery Six months after surviving the Newhall House fire, Stratton died unexpectedly of a stroke. He was 45 years old. Over 20,000 people attended the funeral. P. T. Barnum purchased a life-sized statue of Tom Thumb and placed it as a gravestone at Mountain Grove Cemetery in Bridgeport, Connecticut. When she died more than 35 years later, Lavinia Warren was interred next to him with a simple gravestone that read: \\"His Wife\\". In 1959, vandals smashed the statue of Tom Thumb. It was restored by the Barnum Festival Society and Mountain Grove Cemetery Association with funds raised by public subscription.Marker on the side of Tom Thumb's grave marker. The Historical Marker Database ‚Äì accessed February 11, 2010 The cause of Stratton's extreme shortness is still unknown.

He invented the term \\"Whiggish Jacobite\\", used to point out the difference between those who shared his opinions (who included Sir James Montgomery, 4th Baronet and Robert Ferguson), and the nonjuror faction. After the Battle of La Hogue of 1692, the exiled James II of England became more receptive to Lawton's range of arguments. Lawton promoted \\"civil comprehension\\", i.e. the removal of all religious tests for the holding of public office.Monod, Paul Kleber, Jacobitism and the English People, 1688-1788 (Cambridge University Press, 1993, ), pp. 23-26, accessed 17 June 2013 He was a prolific author of subversive literature, to whom some uncertain attributions are made. He is credited with the concept that the Glorious Revolution was a constitutional charade that fell short of its ideals.Glickman, p. 823. Life He was the son of Ralf Lawton, of Egham, Surrey, surgeon general in the army. He entered as a fellow commoner Wadham College, Oxford, 23 August 1677. He matriculated on 7 December 1677, but left university without taking a degree. He became involved in Monmouth's Rebellion of 1685, and had to lie low. For a time he then lived near Windsor Forest.Erskine-Hill (Pope), p. 141‚Äì2. Lawton became acquainted with William Penn by a chance meeting on a coach in the summer of 1686, and the two remained friends for life. William Popple met Penn in 1687, at Windsor where he was staying with Lawton.Robbins, p. 203. Lawton was called to the bar from the Middle Temple in 1688. Aaron Smith was a militant Whig for whom Lawton procured a royal pardon, through Penn, in 1688, and John Trenchard another in the same year; according to Lawton's memoir of Penn, the Smith pardon preceded the Trenchard pardon.Sydney George Fisher, The true William Penn (1900) p. 264; archive.org. After the Revolution, Lawton met the Jacobite envoy Richard Graham, 1st Viscount Preston in 1690.Monod, p. 298. Preston being a Protestant loyalist to King James, and Lawton's faction being a counterweight to the Catholic influence on the exile king, it was a setback when Preston and John Ashton were arrested on a journey to see him (the so-called Whig-Jacobite Plot).Szechi, p. 616. Lawton corresponded with John Drummond, 1st Earl of Melfort from 1692.Monod, p. 298. Subsequently Lawton was in touch with King James's more moderate adviser Charles Middleton, 2nd Earl of Middleton.Erskine-Hill (Literature), p. 24 note 27. He also canvassed for support among the Green Ribbon Club, and flattered Sir William Whitlock, who was in transition to becoming a Jacobite Tory.Monod, p. 300. At the time of the 1696 assassination plot against William III, Lawton was implicated by name as a go-between for James II and Parliament.Monod, pp. 304‚Äì5. Lawton acted in 1700 as Penn's agent in London. At this point, which was during Penn's second visit to Pennsylvania, he was facing determined opposition, in particular from Jeremiah Basse and Edward Randolph.Olson, p. 182. Lawton was tasked with assembling a group of Penn's supporters from his English network, and this involved contacting Robert Harley. Others to be brought in were Sir Edward Seymour, 4th Baronet, Sir Christopher Musgrave, 4th Baronet, and Sir John Lowther, 2nd Baronet, of Whitehaven. Penn was concerned to have his reputation boosted by a pamphlet with a show of strength from the Tory ranks.Olson, p. 188. Lawton then became a close adviser to Harley. Lawton's continuing good relations with the nonjurors were illustrated by a dedication or address of a section in Linguarum veterum septentrionalium thesaurus after 1701; this was the work of George Hickes, one of the pinnacles of nonjuror scholarship, and Lawton was substituted for the late Bartholomew Shower, a Tory lawyer. Not a practicing barrister, he knew prominent lawyers, including John Somers and George Treby; Lawton lobbied Somers over the private act on behalf of John Burke, 9th Earl of Clanricarde.TNA, Somers Cocks Family of Reigate Priory. At the time of his death, on 18 June 1721, Lawton was described as \\"of Northampton\\". Works Lawton was a prolific writer of pamphlets, including an early group of Jacobite propaganda tracts. In 1693 his hope was for a bloodless restoration of James II. Lawton had the co-operation of the printer William Anderton in distributing his work. Anderton was executed on a treason charge. Related are: *A Short state of our condition with relation to the present Parliament (1693)Text on archive.org. This pamphlet was called the \\"hush-money paper\\" because of its criticism of the use of secret payments; Lawton has been credited with inventing the term \\"hush money\\". He alleged that ¬£16,000 of secret service money had been paid out in bribes over three days. *Some Paradoxes Presented for a New-Year's-Gift from the Old, to the New Orthodox, Serving for an Index to the Revolution (1693) * A French Conquest neither Desirable nor Practicable (1693), printed by David Douglas. * The Jacobite Principles Vindicated (1693, later in Somers Tracts); here Lawton argued on contractarian grounds.Thompson, p. 279. The subject was topical, with John Wildman arguing that the \\"original contract\\" for monarchy had been renewed by the Bill of Rights 1689, and Anderton concluding that William III was therefore accountable to it. * A Letter concerning Sir William Whitlock's Bill for Trials in Cases of Treason (1694); Another group were: * A Letter concerning Civil Comprehension, 1705; * Second Letter concerning Civil Comprehension, 1706; * a letter sent to John Tillotson. These were republished in the Somers Tracts. Letters addressed by Lawton to White Kennett are in the Lansdowne MS. 990, ff. 15, 83. Lawton planned to publish memoirs, and was said to have left papers relating to the affairs of his time. One such document, dealing with the life of Penn for a short period after Lawton knew him, was printed in 1834, in vol. iii. of the Memoirs of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania. In literature Lawton is referenced in Waverley, in the company of the other writers James Drake and Nicholas Amhurst. Family Lawton married Margaret, fourth daughter of William Lawton and Hester, who was the second daughter of Sir Edward Longueville, 1st Baronet. He left a son Henry.

The community comprises the village and the districts of Carnetown and Grovers Field to the south, Navigation Park to the east, and Glancynon (or Aber-taf) to the north. The population of Abercynon was recorded as 6,428 in the 2001 Census,Davies (2008), p.4 decreasing to 6,390 at the 2011 Census, despite more than a hundred additional households built over this period (from 2,582 in 2011 to 2,694 by 2011). The electoral ward of Abercynon includes both the community of Abercynon, but also takes into account the nearby villages of Pontcynon, Ynysboeth and Tyntetown further north. Abercynon is approximately north of Cardiff and approximately from Swansea. The rivers Taff and Cynon converge at Watersmeet near Martin's Terrace. Abercynon used to have many churches, chapels and pubs. There are now only four public houses left - The Thorn Hotel, The Navigation, Brownies Bar and the Carne Park Hotel. The only churches still left are St. Donat's Church in Wales, its daughter church, St. Gwynno's, St. Thomas' Roman Catholic Church and the Methodist church in Martin's Lane. Religion St Gwynno's Church The Church in Wales church is St Gwynno and the Roman Catholic church is St Thomas. A shrine and a grotto were built in 1925 on the bank of the River Taff with links to St Thomas' church. It was the idea of Father Carroll Baillie, the first priest of Abercynon who came to minister to migrant Italian and Irish miners and the small local Welsh catholic population. It was built to occupy unemployed miners during the 1926 United Kingdom general strike. The miners used crowbars and ropes to haul huge blocks of stone from the riverbed, then strengthened the banks and terraces with a sloped wall. It was based on the shrine to Our Lady of Lourdes in France.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-12750563 Abercynon had a number of nonconformist chapels that were established in the nineteenth century. Most had closed by 2000, including Bethania (Independent), Calfaria (Baptist) and Tabernacle (Calvinistic Methodist). Transport links thumb The village was the terminus of the world's first steam railway journey when on 21 February 1804 the inventor Richard Trevithick drove a steam locomotive hauling both iron and passengers travelled from the Penydarren ironworks in Merthyr Tydfil to the basin of the Glamorganshire Canal at Abercynon. There are memorials to Trevithick's journey at Penydarren and outside the fire station at Abercynon. The village developed as a transport interchange being at the junction of the Merthyr and Aberdare branches of the Glamorganshire Canal and the Merthyr and Aberdare branches of the Taff Vale Railway. For a time it was known as \\"Navigation\\" and the Navigation Hotel, which was originally the headquarters of the Glamorganshire Canal, still bears this name. Unusually for a village, until early 2008, it had two railway stations. One was on the line from Cardiff to Aberdare, namely Abercynon North. The other, Abercynon South, was on the Cardiff to Merthyr Tydfil line. Following major work, the North station was closed and its services moved to the South station, now named simply Abercynon. Trains are operated by Transport for Wales as part of the Merthyr Line service. A park and ride scheme funded by the Welsh Assembly Government and the European Regional Development Fund and delivered by Rhondda Cynon Taf Council with capacity for 160 cars and free parking was opened in 2010. Designed by Capita Glamorgan Consultancy and supported by the then Arriva Trains Wales rail franchise and Network Rail, the park-and-ride facility was built on former scrubland situated between the River Taff and Abercynon Station. A new bridge with paved footways either side was built to link the park and ride with Navigation Business Park. A direct access through a new upgraded subway was also provided to Abercynon Station. In 2018 Rhondda Cynon Taf Council announced proposals to expand the Park and Ride scheme at Abercynon Railway Station to provide more than 300 new parking spaces. A new parking facility will be built at Navigation Park, on the former Abercynon Colliery site a short walk from Abercynon Railway Station. It will include 310 new spaces including seven disabled bays and 15 motorcycle spaces and a bus stop will be added to the existing car park adjacent to the train station to encourage integration between bus and rail services. Rhondda Cynon Taf Council secured ¬£787,000 from the Welsh Government‚Äôs Local Transport Fund towards the overall cost of ¬£1.2m. Abercynon lies just off the A470 road between Pontypridd and Merthyr Tydfil. Other road links include the A472 road which provides a cross valley link to Ystrad Mynach and the A4059 road to Mountain Ash and Aberdare. Local collieries Abercynon Colliery in 1973 Abercynon Colliery was sunk by the Dowlais Ironworks in 1889 to supply a steel works in Cardiff. Employing nearly 3000 men and part of the Powell Duffryn empire pre-World War II, it was in 1973 joined with the Lady Windsor Colliery at Ynysybwl. Known as the Abercynon Lady Windsor Colliery, it closed in 1988. A memorial marks the location of the colliery in the Navigation Park.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south- east-wales-28452251 Education Abercynon used to have three primary schools and a secondary school but this has now been reduced to one English medium school and one Welsh medium primary school.

He authored Academic Year (1955), Memoirs Of A Mendicant Professor (1969) and a wide range of essays, reviews, anthologies, children's books and poems. Life Enright was born in Royal Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, and educated at Leamington College and Downing College, Cambridge. After graduating he held a number of academic posts outside the United Kingdom: in Egypt, Japan, Thailand and notably in Singapore (from 1960). He at times attributed his lack of success in finding a post closer to home to writing for Scrutiny and his short association with F. R. Leavis; whose influence he mainly and early, but not entirely, rejected. As a poet he was identified with the Movement. His 1955 anthology, Poets of the 1950s, served to delineate the group of British poets in question -- albeit somewhat remotely and retrospectively, since he was abroad and it was not as prominent as the Robert Conquest collection New Lines of the following year. Returning to London in 1970, he edited Encounter magazine, with Melvin J. Lasky, for two years. He subsequently worked in publishing. The \\"Enright Affair\\" Enright gained some notoriety in Singapore after his inaugural lecture at the University of Singapore on 17 November 1960, titled \\"Robert Graves and the Decline of Modernism\\". His introductory remarks on the state of culture in Singapore were the subject of a Straits Times article. \\"'Hands Off' Challenge to 'Culture Vultures'\\", the next day. Among other things, he stated that it was important for Singapore and Malaya to remain \\"culturally open\\", that culture was something to be left for the people to build up, and that for the government to institute \\"a sarong culture, complete with pantun competitions and so forth\\" was futile. Some quotes include: > Art does not begin in a test-tube, it does not take its origin in good > sentiments and clean-shaven, upstanding young thoughts. > Leave the people free to make their own mistakes, to suffer and to discover. > Authority must leave us to fight even that deadly battle over whether or not > to enter a place of entertainment wherein lurks a juke-box, and whether or > not to slip a coin into the machine. The following day, Enright was summoned by the Ministry for Labour and Law regarding his foreigner work permit, and was handed a letter by the Minister for Culture, S. Rajaratnam, which had also been released to the press. The letter admonished Enright for \\"involv[ing] [himself] in political affairs which are the concern of local people\\", not \\"visitors, including mendicant professors\\", and said that the government \\"[has] no time for asinine sneers by passing aliens about the futility of 'sarong culture complete with pantun competitions' particularly when it comes from beatnik professors\\". There was also some criticism that Enright had been insensitive towards Malays and their so-called \\"sarong culture.\\" With some mediation from the Academic Staff Association of the university, it was agreed that to put the matter to rest, Enright would write a letter of apology and clarification, the government would reply, and both were to be printed in the newspapers. Although the affair was \\"essentially dead\\" after that, according to Enright, it would still be brought up periodically in discussions of local culture and academic freedom. Enright gave his account of the incident in Memoirs of a Mendicant Professor (pp. 124‚Äì151).

It is the \\"belief that the Bible is completely trustworthy as a guide to salvation and the life of faith and will not fail to accomplish its purpose.\\"  Infallibility and inerrancy  Some theologians and denominations equate \\"inerrancy\\" and \\"infallibility\\"; others do not.McKim, DK, Westminster dictionary of theological terms, Westminster John Knox Press, 1996. For example, Davis suggests: \\"The Bible is inerrant if and only if it makes no false or misleading statements on any topic whatsoever. The Bible is infallible if and only if it makes no false or misleading statements on any matter of faith and practice.\\"Stephen T. Davis, The Debate about the Bible: Inerrancy versus Infallibility (Westminster Press, 1977), p. 23. In this sense it is seen as distinct from biblical inerrancy. There is a widespread confusion among Evangelical and Christian Fundamentalist circles that biblical infallibility means that the Bible cannot contain errors while inerrancy implies that the Bible contains no errors. However, the concept of infallibility has not relation to errors, but the impossibility of failure. Using non-theological dictionary definitions, Frame (2002) insists that infallibility is a stronger term than inerrancy. Inerrant' means there are no errors; 'infallible' means there can be no errors.\\" Yet he agrees that \\"modern theologians insist on redefining that word also, so that it actually says less than 'inerrancy.Frame, John M. \\"Is the Bible Inerrant?\\" IIIM Magazine Online,Volume 4, Number 19, May 13 to May 20, 2002 Some denominations that teach infallibility hold that the historical or scientific details, which may be irrelevant to matters of faith and Christian practice, may contain errors. This contrasts with the doctrine of biblical inerrancy, which holds that the scientific, geographic, and historic details of the scriptural texts in their original manuscripts are completely true and without error, though the scientific claims of scripture must be interpreted in the light of the phenomenological nature of the biblical narratives. The Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy uses the term in this sense, saying, \\"Infallibility and inerrancy may be distinguished but not separated.\\"Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy, Article XI Biblical integrity The idea of biblical integrity strengthens the concept of infallibility by suggesting that the current Judeo-Christian biblical text is complete and without failing its purpose (infallibility). The proposal suggests that the \\"integrity\\" of biblical text--to include its present-day message, purpose, and content--has never been corrupted or degraded. Background The idea of biblical infallibility gained ground in Protestant churches as a fundamentalist reaction against a general modernization movement within Christianity in the 19th and early 20th centuries. In the Catholic church, the reaction produced the concept of papal infallibility whereas, in the evangelical churches, the infallibility of the Bible was asserted.Ruthven, M., Fundamentalism: A Very Short Introduction, Oxford University Press, 2007, p.47. \\"Both movements represent a synthesis of a theological position and an ideological-political stance against the erosion of traditional authorities.

Electroactive polymers, or EAPs, are polymers that exhibit a change in size or shape when stimulated by an electric field. The most common applications of this type of material are in actuators and sensors. Ionic Polymer Metal Composites (IPMCs) Set, Editor: Mohsen Shahinpoor, Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge 2016, https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/ebook/978-1-78262-720-3 A typical characteristic property of an EAP is that they will undergo a large amount of deformation while sustaining large forces. The majority of historic actuators are made of ceramic piezoelectric materials. While these materials are able to withstand large forces, they commonly will only deform a fraction of a percent. In the late 1990s, it has been demonstrated that some EAPs can exhibit up to a 380% strain, which is much more than any ceramic actuator. One of the most common applications for EAPs is in the field of robotics in the development of artificial muscles; thus, an electroactive polymer is often referred to as an artificial muscle. History The field of EAPs emerged back in 1880, when Wilhelm R√∂ntgen designed an experiment in which he tested the effect of an electrostatic field on the mechanical properties of a stripe of natural rubber. The rubber stripe was fixed at one end and was attached to a mass at the other. Electric charges were then sprayed onto the rubber, and it was observed that the length changed. It was in 1925 that the first piezoelectric polymer was discovered (Electret). Electret was formed by combining carnauba wax, rosin and beeswax, and then cooling the solution while it is subject to an applied DC electrical bias. The mixture would then solidify into a polymeric material that exhibited a piezoelectric effect. Polymers that respond to environmental conditions, other than an applied electric current, have also been a large part of this area of study. In 1949 Katchalsky et al. demonstrated that when collagen filaments are dipped in acid or alkali solutions, they would respond with a change in volume. The collagen filaments were found to expand in an acidic solution and contract in an alkali solution. Although other stimuli (such as pH) have been investigated, due to its ease and practicality most research has been devoted to developing polymers that respond to electrical stimuli in order to mimic biological systems. The next major breakthrough in EAPs took place in the late 1960s. In 1969 Kawai demonstrated that polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) exhibits a large piezoelectric effect. This sparked research interest in developing other polymers systems that would show a similar effect. In 1977 the first electrically conducting polymers were discovered by Hideki Shirakawa et al. Shirakawa along with Alan MacDiarmid and Alan Heeger demonstrated that polyacetylene was electrically conductive, and that by doping it with iodine vapor, they could enhance its conductivity by 8 orders of magnitude. Thus the conductance was close to that of a metal. By the late 1980s a number of other polymers had been shown to exhibit a piezoelectric effect or were demonstrated to be conductive. In the early 1990s, ionic polymer-metal composites (IPMCs) were developed and shown to exhibit electroactive properties far superior to previous EAPs. The major advantage of IPMCs was that they were able to show activation (deformation) at voltages as low as 1 or 2 volts. This is orders of magnitude less than any previous EAP. Not only was the activation energy for these materials much lower, but they could also undergo much larger deformations. IPMCs were shown to exhibit anywhere up to 380% strain, orders of magnitude larger than previously developed EAPs. In 1999, Yoseph Bar-Cohen proposed the Armwrestling Match of EAP Robotic Arm Against Human Challenge. This was a challenge in which research groups around the world competed to design a robotic arm consisting of EAP muscles that could defeat a human in an arm wrestling match. The first challenge was held at the Electroactive Polymer Actuators and Devices Conference in 2005. Another major milestone of the field is that the first commercially developed device including EAPs as an artificial muscle was produced in 2002 by Eamex in Japan. This device was a fish that was able to swim on its own, moving its tail using an EAP muscle. But the progress in practical development has not been satisfactory. DARPA- funded research in the 1990s at SRI International and led by Ron Pelrine developed an electroactive polymer using silicone and acrylic polymers; the technology was spun off into the company Artificial Muscle in 2003, with industrial production beginning in 2008. In 2010, Artificial Muscle became a subsidiary of Bayer MaterialScience. Types EAP can have several configurations, but are generally divided in two principal classes: Dielectric and Ionic. Dielectric Dielectric EAPs are materials in which actuation is caused by electrostatic forces between two electrodes which squeeze the polymer. Dielectric elastomers are capable of very high strains and are fundamentally a capacitor that changes its capacitance when a voltage is applied by allowing the polymer to compress in thickness and expand in area due to the electric field. This type of EAP typically requires a large actuation voltage to produce high electric fields (hundreds to thousands of volts), but very low electrical power consumption. Dielectric EAPs require no power to keep the actuator at a given position. Examples are electrostrictive polymers and dielectric elastomers. =Ferroelectric polymers= Ferroelectric polymers are a group of crystalline polar polymers that are also ferroelectric, meaning that they maintain a permanent electric polarization that can be reversed, or switched, in an external electric field.\\"Ferroelectric Properties of Vinylidene Fluoride Copolymers,\\" by T. Furukawa, in Phase Transitions, Vol. 18, pp. 143-211 (1989). Ferroelectric polymers, such as polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), are used in acoustic transducers and electromechanical actuators because of their inherent piezoelectric response, and as heat sensors because of their inherent pyroelectric response. Figure 1: Structure of Poly(vinylidene fluoride) =Electrostrictive graft polymers= Figure 2: Cartoon of an electrostrictive graft polymer. Electrostrictive graft polymers consist of flexible backbone chains with branching side chains. The side chains on neighboring backbone polymers cross link and form crystal units. The backbone and side chain crystal units can then form polarized monomers, which contain atoms with partial charges and generate dipole moments, shown in Figure 2. When an electrical field is applied, a force is applied to each partial charge and causes rotation of the whole polymer unit. This rotation causes electrostrictive strain and deformation of the polymer. =Liquid crystalline polymers= Main-chain liquid crystalline polymers have mesogenic groups linked to each other by a flexible spacer. The mesogens within a backbone form the mesophase structure causing the polymer itself to adopt a conformation compatible with the structure of the mesophase. The direct coupling of the liquid crystalline order with the polymer conformation has given main-chain liquid crystalline elastomers a large amount of interest. The synthesis of highly oriented elastomers leads to have a large strain thermal actuation along the polymer chain direction with temperature variation resulting in unique mechanical properties and potential applications as mechanical actuators. Ionic *Ionic EAPs, in which actuation is caused by the displacement of ions inside the polymer. Only a few volts are needed for actuation, but the ionic flow implies a higher electrical power needed for actuation, and energy is needed to keep the actuator at a given position. Examples of ionic EAPS are conductive polymers, ionic polymer-metal composites (IPMCs), and responsive gels. Yet another example is a Bucky gel actuator, which is a polymer-supported layer of polyelectrolyte material consisting of an ionic liquid sandwiched between two electrode layers consisting of a gel of ionic liquid containing single-wall carbon nanotubes. The name comes from the similarity of the gel to the paper that can be made by filtering carbon nanotubes, the so-called buckypaper.Fully Plastic Actuator through Layer-by- Layer Casting with Ionic-Liquid-Based Bucky Gel Takanori Fukushima, Kinji Asaka, Atsuko Kosaka, Takuzo Aida p. Angewandte Chemie International Edition Volume 44, Issue 16 2410 2005 =Electrorheological fluid= Figure 3: The cations in the ionic polymer-metal composite are randomly oriented in the absence of an electric field. Once a field is applied the cations gather to the side of the polymer in contact with the anode causing the polymer to bend. Electrorheological fluids change the viscosity of a solution with the application of an electric field. The fluid is a suspension of polymers in a low dielectric-constant liquid. With the application of a large electric field the viscosity of the suspension increases. Potential applications of these fluids include shock absorbers, engine mounts and acoustic dampers. =Ionic polymer-metal composite= Ionic polymer-metal composites consist of a thin ionomeric membrane with noble metal electrodes plated on its surface. It also has cations to balance the charge of the anions fixed to the polymer backbone. They are very active actuators that show very high deformation at low applied voltage and show low impedance. Ionic polymer-metal composites work through electrostatic attraction between the cationic counter ions and the cathode of the applied electric field, a schematic representation is shown in Figure 3. These types of polymers show the greatest promise for bio-mimetic uses as collagen fibers are essentially composed of natural charged ionic polymers. Nafion and Flemion are commonly used ionic polymer metal composites. =Stimuli-responsive gels= Stimuli-responsive gels (hydrogels, when the swelling agent is an aqueous solution) are a special kind of swellable polymer networks with volume phase transition behaviour. These materials change reversibly their volume, optical, mechanical and other properties by very small alterations of certain physical (e.g. electric field, light, temperature) or chemical (concentrations) stimuli. Chemoresponsive Materials, Editor: Hans-J√∂rg Schneider, Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge 2015, https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/ebook/978-1-78262-242-0The volume change of these materials occurs by swelling/shrinking and is diffusion-based. Gels provide the biggest change in volume of solid-state materials. Combined with an excellent compatibility with micro-fabrication technologies, especially stimuli-responsive hydrogels are of strong increasing interest for microsystems with sensors and actuators. Current fields of research and application are chemical sensor systems, microfluidics and multimodal imaging systems. Comparison of dielectric and ionic EAPs Dielectric polymers are able to hold their induced displacement while activated under a DC voltage. This allows dielectric polymers to be considered for robotic applications. These types of materials also have high mechanical energy density and can be operated in air without a major decrease in performance. However, dielectric polymers require very high activation fields (>10 V/¬µm) that are close to the breakdown level. The activation of ionic polymers, on the other hand, requires only 1-2 volts. They however need to maintain wetness, though some polymers have been developed as self-contained encapsulated activators which allows their use in dry environments. Ionic polymers also have a low electromechanical coupling. They are however ideal for bio-mimetic devices. Characterization While there are many different ways electroactive polymers can be characterized, only three will be addressed here: stress‚Äìstrain curve, dynamic mechanical thermal analysis, and dielectric thermal analysis. Stress‚Äìstrain curve Figure 4: The unstressed polymer spontaneously forms a folded structure, upon application of a stress the polymer regains its original length. Stress strain curves provide information about the polymer's mechanical properties such as the brittleness, elasticity and yield strength of the polymer. This is done by providing a force to the polymer at a uniform rate and measuring the deformation that results. An example of this deformation is shown in Figure 4. This technique is useful for determining the type of material (brittle, tough, etc.), but it is a destructive technique as the stress is increased until the polymer fractures. Dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) Both dynamic mechanical analysis is a non destructive technique that is useful in understanding the mechanism of deformation at a molecular level. In DMTA a sinusoidal stress is applied to the polymer, and based on the polymer's deformation the elastic modulus and damping characteristics are obtained (assuming the polymer is a damped harmonic oscillator). Elastic materials take the mechanical energy of the stress and convert it into potential energy which can later be recovered. An ideal spring will use all the potential energy to regain its original shape (no damping), while a liquid will use all the potential energy to flow, never returning to its original position or shape (high damping). A viscoeleastic polymer will exhibit a combination of both types of behavior. Dielectric thermal analysis (DETA) DETA is similar to DMTA, but instead of an alternating mechanical force an alternating electric field is applied. The applied field can lead to polarization of the sample, and if the polymer contains groups that have permanent dipoles (as in Figure 2), they will align with the electrical field. The permittivity can be measured from the change in amplitude and resolved into dielectric storage and loss components. The electric displacement field can also be measured by following the current. Once the field is removed, the dipoles will relax back into a random orientation. Applications Figure 5: Cartoon drawing of an arm controlled by EAPs. When a voltage is applied (blue muscles) the polymer expands. When the voltage is removed (red muscles) the polymer returns to its original state.EAP materials can be easily manufactured into various shapes due to the ease in processing many polymeric materials, making them very versatile materials. One potential application for EAPs is that they can potentially be integrated into microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) to produce smart actuators. Artificial muscles As the most prospective practical research direction, EAPs have been used in artificial muscles. Their ability to emulate the operation of biological muscles with high fracture toughness, large actuation strain and inherent vibration damping draw the attention of scientists in this field. Tactile displays In recent years, \\"electro active polymers for refreshable Braille displays\\" has emerged to aid the visually impaired in fast reading and computer assisted communication. This concept is based on using an EAP actuator configured in an array form. Rows of electrodes on one side of an EAP film and columns on the other activate individual elements in the array. Each element is mounted with a Braille dot and is lowered by applying a voltage across the thickness of the selected element, causing local thickness reduction. Under computer control, dots would be activated to create tactile patterns of highs and lows representing the information to be read. Figure 6: High resolution tactile display consisting of 4,320 (60x72) actuator pixels based on stimuli-responsive hydrogels. The integration density of the device is 297 components per cm¬≤. This display gives visual (monochromic) and physical (contours, relief, textures, softness) impressions of a virtual surface.Visual and tactile impressions of a virtual surface are displayed by a high resolution tactile display, a so-called \\"artificial skin\\" (Fig.6) . These monolithic devices consist of an array of thousands of multimodal modulators (actuator pixels) based on stimuli- responsive hydrogels. Each modulator is able to change individually their transmission, height and softness. Besides their possible use as graphic displays for visually impaired such displays are interesting as free programmable keys of touchpads and consoles. Microfluidics EAP materials have huge potential for microfluidics e.g. as drug delivery systems, microfluidic devices and lab-on-a-chip. A first microfluidic platform technology reported in literature is based on stimuli-responsive gels. To avoid the electrolysis of water hydrogel-based microfluidic devices are mainly based on temperature-responsive polymers with lower critical solution temperature (LCST) characteristics, which are controlled by an electrothermic interface. Two types of micropumps are known, a diffusion micropump and a displacement micropump. Microvalves based on stimuli-responsive hydrogels show some advantageous properties such as particle tolerance, no leakage and outstanding pressure resistance. Besides these microfluidic standard components the hydrogel platform provides also chemical sensors and a novel class of microfluidic components, the chemical transistors (also referred as chemostat valves). These devices regulate a liquid flow if a threshold concentration of certain chemical is reached. Chemical transistors form the basis of microchemomechanical fluidic integrated circuits. \\"Chemical ICs\\" process exclusively chemical information, are energy-self-powered, operate automatically and are able for large-scale integration. Another microfluidic platform is based on ionomeric materials. Pumps made from that material could offer low voltage (battery) operation, extremely low noise signature, high system efficiency, and highly accurate control of flow rate. Another technology that can benefit from the unique properties of EAP actuators is optical membranes. Due to their low modulus, the mechanical impedance of the actuators, they are well-matched to common optical membrane materials. Also, a single EAP actuator is capable of generating displacements that range from micrometers to centimeters. For this reason, these materials can be used for static shape correction and jitter suppression. These actuators could also be used to correct for optical aberrations due to atmospheric interference. Since these materials exhibit excellent electroactive character, EAP materials show potential in biomimetic-robot research, stress sensors and acoustics field, which will make EAPs become a more attractive study topic in the near future. They have been used for various actuators such as face muscles and arm muscles in humanoid robots.http://eap.jpl.nasa.gov/ NASA WorldWide Electroactive Polymer Actuators Webhub Future directions The field of EAPs is far from mature, which leaves several issues that still need to be worked on. The performance and long-term stability of the EAP should be improved by designing a water impermeable surface. This will prevent the evaporation of water contained in the EAP, and also reduce the potential loss of the positive counter ions when the EAP is operating submerged in an aqueous environment. Improved surface conductivity should be explored using methods to produce a defect-free conductive surface. This could possibly be done using metal vapor deposition or other doping methods. It may also be possible to utilize conductive polymers to form a thick conductive layer. Heat resistant EAP would be desirable to allow operation at higher voltages without damaging the internal structure of the EAP due to the generation of heat in the EAP composite. Development of EAPs in different configurations (e.g., fibers and fiber bundles), would also be beneficial, in order to increase the range of possible modes of motion.

The Federation was founded in 1927 as a business association that promotes production and exportation of Colombian coffee. It currently represents over 540,000 producers, most of whom are small family owned farms. While many factors contributed to the impressive increase in production and revenue, the rise and success of the Colombian coffee industry reflects the Federation's rigid adherence to the three objectives which were originally offered to justify its creation: 1) to protect the industry, 2) to study its problems, and 3) to further its interests.Uribe C., Andr√©s; Brown Gold, The Amazing Story of Coffee; Random House, Inc., New York, 1954, Pg 113, Library of Congress Catalog Card Number 55-5793 The Federation supports research and development in the production of coffee through grants to local universities and through Federation sponsored research institutes. The Federation also monitors production to ensure export quality standards are met. The highly successful Juan Valdez branding concept was launched in 1960 to distinguish 100% Colombian coffee from coffee blended with beans from other countries. The trademark character made its debut on a whole-page ad in the Sunday edition of The New York Times on January 6, 1960, featuring a country farmer (campesino) carrying coffee on his mule Conchita. In November 2019, the Federation received the Distinguished Leadership Award for Social Equity from the Inter- American Dialogue. The award was presented by the vice president of Colombia, Marta Luc√≠a Ram√≠rez.  The arrival of coffee in Colombia  First cultivated in the Dutch East Indies, the species of Coffea arabica came to Americas around the year 1690. The Dutch sent the coffee seeds to their colonies in Surinam, and thereafter to the French Guiana and Brazil. The French, through other routes, took it to Guadeloupe and Martinique, their main two colonies in the Caribbean. It seems that the Jesuits were the first to introduce seeds of coffee in the \\"Nueva Granada\\" (today Colombia) by the year 1723. The first experiments in growing coffee in Colombia are recorded in the 18th century. Although some coffee plantations were initiated during the first half of the 19th century, it was not until the second half of the Century that the coffee industry was consolidated as an economic generator of employment, wealth, and hard currencies. Coffee seeds arrived late in Colombia, compared with other Latin American countries. According to historians, the first seeds came in through C√∫cuta, coming from the Venezuelan Andes, and penetrated all across the Santander provinces. From there, its cultivation spread to Cundinamarca and other provinces. Nobody knows for sure who brought the first coffee seeds into the country. Some historians give credit to the Jesuits monks, who had farming lands in the \\"Llanos Orientales\\", Valle del Cauca and other regions. Other historians point to father Romero, the parochial priest of Salazar de las Palmas, Norte de Santander. There are stories that narrate that father Romero would impose to his parishioners, in penance for their sins, to plant coffee seeds in their backyards.  The advancement of coffee in Colombia  It was during the 19th century that the transformation of the Colombian economy took place, going from a system of mules, tobacco and gold into a system based on coffee, railways and the banks, which created the favorable conditions for a robust economic growth.Safford, Frank R.; Commerce and Enterprise in Central Colombia, 1821-1870, CEDE, Universidad de Los Andes, Bogot√°, 1967 The initiative for the development, investment and expansion of coffee growing in Colombia came from a group of national dignitaries and pioneers, who devoted their personal talents and resources into a venture of slow turnaround and high risk. Especially Colombian magnate Mr. Carlos Pinz√≥n, virtually the founder of Colombia's modern coffee export business. In many ways, Mr. Carlos Pinzon's coffee empire was the precursor of the present-day Coffee Grower's Federation, overlording consignments, tying up export orders, arranging insurance, and, in many cases, financing. 1998 Lockwood Trade Journal Co., Inc. From 1870 on, large coffee plantations began to flourish, and this translated into a vigorous expansion of the nation's economy in international trade and commerce. The Colombian coffee industry began to operate as a powerful engine for the development of the nation's economy. In 1879, the Colombian Congress passed the Coffee Act, known as the Law 29, by which the government would foment and sponsor the growing of coffee in the provinces better qualified for it, according to climate and terroir. As a result of this promotional effort, the production of coffee in Colombia grew enormously, which between 1880 and 1920 went from 107,000 to 2.4 million bags per year (60 kilograms per bag). By 1920, small growers had done more to develop the industry than any other group. For many decades they planted, processed and sold their coffee virtually unnoticed by Colombia's government. On the other hand, the large growers began voicing their opinions and grievances against the Government through the Agricultural Society of Colombia (Sociedad de Agricultores de Colombia).Uribe C., Andr√©s; Brown Gold, The Amazing Story of Coffee; Random House, Inc., New York, 1954, Pg 112, Library of Congress Catalog Card Number 55-5793 By the start of the 20th century, there were about 750 coffee farms and plantations. Between 1910 and 1932, this number had increased to more than 150,000 farms and plantations, according to the Coffee Census of 1932. History of the Coffee Federation  Given the positive advancement of coffee growing in Colombia, an important group of coffee growers, dedicated to the export of the beans, organized an association to regulate the market. Thus, in 1904, the coffee producers organization (\\"Sociedad de Productores de Caf√©\\") was established. Although its good intentions, it failed to regulate the industry and the market. It was a difficult task, as the global conditions were complicated due to overproduction, price volatility and the events of World War I. The coffee industry in the nation was evolving and growers, merchants and exporters could not agree on policies and regulations to organize and consolidate it. In the province of Antioquia, Epif√°nio Montoya Uribe, a tenacious and visionary coffee grower, promoted the creation of an association to look after the interest of the coffee growers. He created this organization under the name of Colombian coffee union (\\"Uni√≥n Cafetera Colombiana\\"). His ideas and association efforts were well received by the industry and took hold and, the institution prospered. On August 25, 1920, the First National Congress of Coffee Growers to convene in Bogot√°, promoted and sponsored by the Agricultural Society of Colombia (\\"Sociead e Agricultores de Colombia\\") (S.A.C.). This first congress was presided over by Epif√°nio Montoya. Other dignitaries that attended this event were General Ram√≥n Gonz√°lez Valencia (former Vice-President of the country), General Alfredo V√°squez Cobo (presidential candidate), Antonio Samper (president of S.A.C.), Tulio Ospina V√°squez, Jos√© de Jes√∫s Salazar, Germ√°n del Corral, Luis Montoya Santamar√≠a, Gabriel Ortiz Williamson and Lucas Caballero. This congress laid the foundation for the successful organization and establishment of the National Federation of Coffee Growers of Colombia. Much was analyzed and discussed during this congress, mainly regarding transportation infrastructure, financial institutions, trade association and protection of the industry. The magnitude of the issues studied and the challenges addressed by the delegates were overwhelming. At the end, the congress adjourned without any major resolution adopted. Nevertheless, the delegates returned to their provinces with a fervent desire to create a national trade association capable to protect the industry and guide its members. The response to the efforts and foundations laid by the First National Congress of Coffee Growers would take seven years to materialize. In June 1927, the \\"Agrarian Association of Antioquia\\", (\\"Sociead Antioque√±a de Agricultores\\") (S.A.A.), decide to make a second effort to try to organize and confederate the nation's coffee growers. Thus, the Second National Congress of Coffee Growers convened in Medell√≠n in 1927. The main speaker was former President of Colombia Carlos Eugenio Restrepo, who gave the opening speech. Twenty nine delegates participated in this Congress and several dignitaries from the political and economic elite of the nation, and among them two of the sons of Tulio Ospina V√°squez, Rafael Ospina P√©rez (president of the S.A.A.) who presided over this Congress and Mariano Ospina P√©rez, future president of Colombia. Other participants were Daniel Uribe Botero (vice-president of the S.A.A.), Epif√°nio Montoya, Julio C. Gait√°n (representing the government), Pedro Bernal Escobar and Joaqu√≠n Santamar√≠a. By the end of deliberations, the Second National Congress of Coffee Growers had agreed to establish the \\"National Federation of Coffee Growers of Colombia\\" (Federaci√≥n Nacional de Cafeteros de Colombia). The Federation was created as a trade association, private entity and non-profit organization. Few months later that same year of 1927, the National Congress approved the Law 76, by which duties were imposed on all exports of the country and gave to the National Federation of Coffee Growers the authority to administer and manage all these revenue. Thus, the Federation and the national government signed a contract, on October 15, 1928, by which the government was obliged to transfer to the Federation all revenue generated by this tax. This revenue propelled and fortified the Federation and these resources were used to create the National Coffee Fund. In 1928, the first regional committee was established as the Coffee Growers Committee of Antioquia (Comit√© de Cafeteros de Antioquia). Mariano Ospina P√©rez was its first President, and the first registered member of the association. The first Board of Directors of the newly organized Federaci√≥n Nacional de Cafeteros de Colombia assembled in Bogot√°, on August 3, 1929. Its first members were Mariano Ospina V√°squez, Alberto Camilo Su√°rez, Gabriel Ortiz Williamson, Carlos Caballero, Jes√∫s del Corral and Mariano Ospina P√©rez, for whom the organization of the national coffee industry was one of his most serious and ambitious concerns. In December 1930, the Fourth National Congress of Coffee Growers convened in Bogot√°. Due to the knowledge and experience of the coffee industry, acquired by running his own coffee business, Mariano Ospina P√©rez was summoned by the Minister of Industry, Francisco J. Chaux, and by President Enrique Olaya Herrera to preside over this congress. At the adjournment of this congress, Ospina P√©rez was elected, by the unanimous vote of the delegates, as General Director of the Federation serving in this position for four years, until 1934.Lozano, Miguel Angel ; Mariano Ospina P√©rez, Un Hombre de Acci√≥n y de Principios; Fundaci√≥n de Estudios Historicos, Misi√≥n Colombia; Funadaci√≥n Mariano Ospina P√©rez; Editorial El Globo SA; Bogot√°, Colombia; November, 1991; Page 61.Ospina P√©rez, Mariano; Informe del Gerente de La Federacion al Sexto Congreso Nacional de Cafeteros; Federaci√≥n Nacional de Cafeteros de Colombia; June, 1934; Colombia. Mariano Ospina P√©rez was President of Colombia between 1946‚Äì1950 and General Director of the FNC from 1930‚Äì1934. In the election of members of the Board of Directors in 1954, Ospina P√©rez was installed as President of the Board of Directors. His return to the Federation marked the reappearance of one of Colombia's most important coffee names in an active role in the industry. Under Ospina P√©rez' aegis, the National Federation of Coffee Growers of Colombia successfully consolidated the nation's coffee industry and promoted it in the world markets to great effect. Colombia became the largest producer of prime Coffea arabica coffee in the world. He laid a very solid corporative foundation, and today, the Colombian Coffee Federation congregates and supports over 500,000 independent coffee growers and small farmers.  The managers of the Coffee Federation  The general managers or directors of the National Federation of Coffee Growers of Colombia do not just function as business managers or administrators, given the fact that in furtherance of their normal business activities in running efficiently and effectively a private enterprise, they actively participate in the formulation and implementation of national policy for the coffee industry and they may substantially influence the macro-economic policy of the country. The general Managers have had a seat in the Board of Directors of the Banco de la Rep√∫blica, in the Council of Economic and Social Policy (Consejo de Pol√≠tica Econ√≥mica y Social) and in the Council of International Trade and Commerce. Furthermore, they direct and preside the diplomatic missions that represent the nation in international conferences and forums, which may influence foreign policy as well. Three of the most influential \\"Gerentes\\" (general managers) of the 20th century have been Mariano Ospina P√©rez, Manuel Mej√≠a Jaramillo and Arturo G√≥mez Jaramillo. Ospina P√©rez (1930‚Äì1934), consolidated the organizational structure of the raising institution, promoted the creation of the national network of \\"almacenes generals de deposito\\" and established the \\"Caja Agraria\\" (a credit and financial institution to aid the small farmers and coffee growers). Mej√≠a Jaramillo (1937‚Äì1958), gave to the national coffee industry the international prestige that it now enjoys, was instrumental in the creation of the \\"Flota Mercante Grancolombiana\\" (the nation's ocean freighter company), the creation of the \\"Banco Cafetero\\", and the \\"Compa√±ia Agr√≠cola de Seguros\\". Arturo G√≥mez (1958‚Äì1982), was the leader of the international economic policy in the global markets and the \\"Convenios Internacionales del Caf√©\\" (International Coffee Agreement). Arturo G√≥mez, during his 18 years tenure as \\"Gerente de la Federaci√≥n\\", had a wonderful collaborator as second in command, Jorge C√°rdenas Guti√©rrez, as deputy General Manager. C√°rdenas Guti√©rrez was a lawyer with a master's degree in administration. Prior to working for the Federation he had been vice-president of Ecopetrol. C√°rdenas Guti√©rrez was appointed as \\"Gerente de la Federaci√≥n\\" in 1983, and managed extreme situations form \\"crisis\\" to \\"bonanza\\". By 2001, he was considered as the most experienced coffee leader in the world\\".  The enterprises of the Coffee Federation  The Colombian Coffee Federation has created and promoted various enterprises to further support and provide adequate service to the coffee growers. The most significant of these enterprises are the \\"Flota Mercanmte Grancolombiana\\", the \\"Banco Cafetero\\" and the \\"Compa√±ia Agricola de Seguros\\". Although some of these institutions have faced financial difficulties, and one has been sold, it is relevant to describe the nature of their services and performance.  Flota Mercante Grancolombiana The \\"Flota Mercante Grancolombiana\\" (Colombian ocean freight merchant fleet) was created in 1946, with the purpose of establishing new routes and offering better rates for the exportation of Colombian coffee, and thus, to make this commodity more accessible and affordable in international markets. At that time, the shipping consortium \\"Grace Line\\" dominated the ocean forwarding lines and had very high freight rates. During the time of the postwar, \\"la Flota\\" (the fleet) facilitated the sale and shipping of increasing quantities of coffee to the European and Asian markets. In addition to the substantial reduction in freight costs, \\"la Flota\\" contributed significant dividends to its major shareholder, the \\"Fondo Nacional del Caf√©\\" (the national coffee fund). The globalization of world economies and the interdependence of the ocean freight industry during the decade of the 90s, made shipping business more efficient and competitive. Major shipping companies sought strategic alliances and partners. In order to compete in the global market, \\"la Flota\\", in 1996-97, entered in partnership with the \\"Transportacion Mar√≠tima Mexicana\\", a Mexican company with ample experience in ocean shipping. The \\"Fondo Nacional del Caf√©\\" acquired 40% of the new company, called \\"Transportacion Mar√≠tima Grancolombiana\\".  El Banco Cafetero  \\"El Banco Cafetero\\" (the bank of the coffee growers) was established in 1954 because \\"la Caja Agraria\\" (agricultural financial institution), also created by the Coffee Federation during the 1930s, was not providing adequate service to the coffee growers. This banking and financial institution was created with the purpose of facilitating and financing the production, harvesting, processing, transport and exporting of coffee and other agricultural products. Eventually, the bank established over 300 branches throughout the country; its assets amounted to 10% of the nation's banking assets and handled over one million seven hundred thousand bank accounts. It became the third largest bank in Colombia, offering every financial services to all the industries and sectors of the national economy.  Compa√±ia Agr√≠cola de Seguros  The \\"Compa√±ia Agr√≠cola de Seguros\\" (agrarian insurance company) was created in 1952. The Coffee Federation decided to establish this insurance company because the premiums being charged to its members to insure and protect the warehousing and transportation of coffee, by commercial insurance companies were ever increasing. The company eventually extended its services to cover production risk and liability, hedging, calamity, auto, life and health insurance to all of the members of the Coffee Federation, offering if lower premiums and higher benefits. The company suffered heavy losses during the earthquake that destroyed Armenia, as this was a highly concentrated area of coffee growers.  The National Coffee Fund  The national coffee fund (\\"Fondo Nacional del Caf√©\\") (FNC) has served for several decades as the primary instrument of Colombian coffee policy formulation and implementation. The FNC has two main investment sub-funds, the stabilizer fund and the investment fund. The stabilizer fund manages resources for the internal and external administration of product, prices and commerce. The investment fund manages the resources for the investment in the Federation's enterprises and, for the lines of credit and production financing for coffee growers. During the 20th century, Colombia became the number one producer and exporter of premium mild washed coffee in the world. This has been a very significant achievement, attained by the combined efforts of the private sector, the gremial organizations and the Federation's institutions. The successful model of Colombian coffee production and commerce is the outcome of a well balanced combination of efficient private enterprise and a well planned macroeconomic policy by the government. This economic model has become the organizational archetype for more than fifty coffee producing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America. The 21st century has brought new challenges to the coffee industry, such as the volatility of international prices, the erosion of international agreements and the increased production by Brazil and Vietnam. In order to keep the edge, Colombia must increase its efficiency and productivity, by investing in new technologies, infrastructure, training and replanting. Here is where the Federation and the FNC play a decisive role. The program for restructuring and modernizing the coffee industry in Colombia has estimated an investment of two billion dollars. These monetary funds need to be generated from domestic and international sources. The Colombian coffee institutions and the policy making entities are facing the new realities of globalization and monetary volatility and economic uncertainties. Technological advances are being made in electronic commerce, production engineering and quality control, in an effort to reduce production costs and increase productivity. The historical evidence demonstrates that the institutions, organizations and policy making instruments of the coffee industry in Colombia are very dynamic and shall continue to adapt to changing circumstances and perform with leadership, innovation and positive results.

It is on the eastern bank of the River Taff close to the A470, and historically was in the parish of Eglwysilan. History Rhydyfelin grew from a rural hamlet to a thriving village in the 19th century, due to its location on the Glamorganshire Canal which took iron from Merthyr Tydfil to the city of Cardiff, and linking to this Dr Richard Griffiths' canal and tramway which took coal from the Rhondda Valleys. Also of note was the nearby Iron and Tin works at Treforest. Other minor works included an ironworks on the site of the tram shed buildings. Neighbouring villages are Hawthorn, Treforest and Glyntaff. The village is split into two electoral wards: the lower, largely historic part of the village is in Hawthorn Ward along with the settlement of Upper Boat, which comprises some of the nearby Treforest Estate, while the largely social housing of the estates of upper Rhydyfelin are in the ward of Rhydyfelen Central and Ilan. Rhydyfelin is also known as Rhydfelen, which means Mill ford in the Welsh language. The original name was Rhydfelen, and the version \\"Rhydyfelin\\" is believed to be a corruption. Rhydyfelin was once served by two railway stations: one on the Cardiff Railway, and one on the Pontypridd, Caerphilly and Newport Railway. After the Grouping, the former Cardiff Railway halt became Rhydyfelin Low Level Halt and the halt of the Pontypridd, Caerphilly and Newport Railway became Rhydyfelin High Level Halt. The halts closed in 1931 and 1953 respectively. St Luke's Church The Church of St Luke is in the Church in Wales Parish of Rhydyfelin, Diocese of Llandaff. Population The populations of the Central Rhydyfelin ward and Hawthorn wards, which together serve Rhydyfelin, were 4,672 and 3,652 respectively (8,324 in total) in the 2001 Census (the 2009 electorates were 3,084 and 2,781, respectively) out of the total 33,000 residents for Pontypridd as a whole. Governance Rhydfelen was the name of the electoral ward to Mid Glamorgan County Council between 1989 and 1996. Until 1996 Rhydfelen Central and Rhydfelen Lower were wards to Taff-Ely Borough Council. It is now split between the electoral wards of Hawthorn and of central Rhydfelen, with the more prosperous and historic lower Rhydyfelin falling within the Hawthorn ward to the south. Notable residents Rhydyfelin was home to guitarist Lee Gaze of the band LostProphets. Places of interest Rhydyfelin's war memorial is a Grade II listed building The village is on the 55 mile Taff Trail from Brecon to Cardiff Bay. The view from lower Rhydyfelin of Eglwysilan mountain shows the locally know 'Monkeys Tump'. Education The first Welsh language secondary school in South Wales, Ysgol Gyfun Rhydfelen, was established at Rhydyfelin in 1962. It closed in 2006 when it was relocated to Church Village and renamed Garth Olwg. Schools in Rhydyfelin include Cardinal Newman RC School (Roman Catholic), Hawthorn High School (English medium), Heol-Y-Celyn Primary School (Welsh and English medium). It is the former home of Coleg Morgannwg (English medium further education college) and Glant√¢f infants school (English medium). References *J. Hutton. The Newport Docks and Railway Company.

It contains elements of the technological inventiveness of hard science-fiction with a more contemporary political plotline. The novel follows the exploits of Earth Central Security agent Ian Cormac, as he attempts to discover who or what is behind the destruction of the Runcible on a remote colony. Cormac drops an investigation into Polity separatists on Cheyne III, and takes the starship Hubris to the ruined world of Samarkand to directly oversee the investigation there. Having been directly \\"gridlinked\\" to the Polity A.I. network for too long, Cormac has been slowly losing his humanity, and takes the opportunity of this particular mission to disconnect and solve the mystery the old-fashioned way. Detailed plot summary The book follows two main narrative threads: one which follows the exploits of Ian Cormac, a 007-like agent from ECS (Earth Central Security), and another thread which follows the story of Arian Pelter and his band of Separatists from Cheyne III. Cormac is internally \\"gridlinked\\" to the ECS AI grid, allowing him realtime mental access and control to most devices on the ECS network. The book opens with a Runcible disaster on the ice planet Samarkand, which was in the process of being terraformed by the energy the Runcible produces. The incident destroys a significant area of the planet's surface, while the loss of Runcible heat output plunges the rest of the planet into unsurvivable temperature ranges. On Cheyne III, Cormac has infiltrated the Separatists by becoming the lover of Angelina Pelter ‚Äì sister of Arian Pelter. She and Arian have become suspicious of Ian, primarily due to his increasingly inhuman perspective on human affairs, a problem induced by years of being gridlinked. Cormac is forced to kill Angelina and dispose of her body at sea. After a chase across the city, Arian and his main henchman John Stanton have a shootout with Cormac, during which Arian receives a serious facial injury, and Cormac is called away to look into the Samarkand incident, leaving Arian and his crew at large. Cormac takes a space shuttle to Cereb, the location of the nearest Runcible. While in flight, he runs into Horace Blegg, who briefs him on the Samarkand mission. Blegg informs him that the Samarkand incident was no accident, and also suggests that Cormac disconnect his gridlink, as he has been connected for too long a period of time and is becoming dehumanized. Upon his arrival to Cereb, Cormac takes a Runcible to Minostra, where he boards the starship Hubris for a voyage to Samarkand, where they will conduct an investigation and install a new Runcible. At Samarkand, they discover a not-quite-sane submind of the destroyed Runcible AI. After investigating a heat source at a remote outpost, they find two alien creatures able to live in the extreme conditions. Cormac calls them dracomen, and recognizes them as the products of Dragon, an alien entity he encountered decades ago on Aster Colora; they bring the dracomen back to the Hubris. Subsequent probing of the Runcible site reveals that the Runcible buffers were sabotaged by a nanomycelium, which is still present, endangering the installation of a new Runcible. They also quickly learn that the dracomen have brought the nanomycelium aboard the Hubris, and certain sections of the ship begin to dissolve; the dracomen also inform Cormac that Dragon is on his way. The Hubris AI starts to manufacture and deploy nanomycelium counteragents, both on ship and on the surface of Samarkand. Subsequently, a tunnel is discovered in a remote area of Samarkand which is clearly not of natural origin. Cormac leads a small team to investigate, who, finding that the tunnel is guarded by a large robot, engage in combat that destroys the creature and leads to the death of one man. At the bottom of the shaft they find an empty artefact made of adamantium. The Hubris is attacked by Dragon (actually part thereof, Dragon having disconnected its four component spheres some time previously), who forcibly takes the dracomen. A discussion with Dragon indicates that the artefact held something called Maker, which Dragon claims was responsible for the nanomycelium, and which is now missing from the planet. Dragon allows the crew to install the Runcible; Cormac uses the new Runcible AI to query the old Samarkand submind, and is able to conclude that Maker left Samarkand before the Runcible incident‚Äîits destination Viridian. Cormac decides to follow through the new Runcible, taking the two dracomen along. Meanwhile, back on Cheyne III, Pelter and Stanton have been repaired by black-market surgeon Sylac, and Arian has had a particularly hideous augmentation (an \\"aug\\") installed in his head. Pelter becomes obsessed with finding and killing Cormac after recovering his sister's headless body. They then pull the deranged golem, Mr. Crane, out of storage and escape from Cheyne III on a smuggling ship piloted by Jarvellis. Although Pelter intends to press on to Samarkand, he first makes port at Huma to pick up the necessary weaponry. They find many of the inhabitants on Huma wearing a new type of aug created by a company known as DragonCorp, and Pelter and his crew are all outfitted with them, except for Stanton. While the new aug feeds Pelter additional information about Cormac, he finds it battling with his old one. The Pelter gang is soon acquired and tracked by a group of ECS agents; Pelter and his crew take out the agents one-by-one, including their golem Twenty agent ‚Äî who is no match for the golem Twenty-five Mr. Crane. Communicating directly with Dragon through his new aug, Pelter is told that he will find Cormac on Viridian. Back on Viridian, Cormac makes his way to the Magadar forest, the last known coordinates of Maker, taking a small group of planetary regulars with him. Pelter and his crew glide down to Viridian in a chameleonware dropship, evading the notice of the Viridian AI. Pelter determines Cormac's location by bribing some members of the planetary army. A protracted battle then takes place in the forest; Cormac's crew kills Pelter's crew, the golems Cento and Aiden take out Mr. Crane, and Cormac drills a hole through Pelter's head with his thin-gun. Able to focus on Maker, he detonates a CTD, forcing Maker back toward the Viridian Runcible. Cormac passes through first, deliberately damaging the Samarkand Runcible buffers with a proton weapon, and after flying out of range observes the obliteration of the Samarkand Runcible as the Maker presumably passes through. There is no explanation as to the Maker, its origins or motivations. There is no explanation as to why the Maker followed Cormac and crew through the Runcible or why Cormac damaged the new runcible on Samarkand. Not finished, Cormac takes a dracoman to the Hubris, seals him in an isolation chamber, and leaves orbit. Infuriated, Dragon follows, attacks the ship, and pulls the chamber out. After putting distance between the Hubris and Dragon, Cormac presses a button, igniting the CTD stored in the chamber, taking out Dragon. Maker then comes through the Runcible for real, and congratulates Cormac on finding the true saboteur of the Samarkand Runcible.

Over 30 million copies have been sold worldwide, making it one of the best-selling books of all time.New York Times, 2011 at https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/05/books/books-of-the-times-classic-advice- please-leave-well-enough-alone.html In 2011, it was number 19 on Time Magazines list of the 100 most influential books. Carnegie had been conducting business education courses in New York since 1912. In 1934, Leon Shimkin of the publishing firm Simon & Schuster took one of Carnegie's 14-week courses on human relations and public speaking; afterward, Shimkin persuaded Carnegie to let a stenographer take notes from the course to be revised for publication. The initial five thousand copies of the book sold exceptionally well, going through 17 editions in its first year alone. In 1981, a revised edition containing updated language and anecdotes was released. The revised edition reduced the number of sections from six to four, eliminating sections on effective business letters and improving marital satisfaction. Major sections and points=Twelve Things This Book Will Do For You # Get you out of a mental rut, give you new thoughts, new visions, new ambitions. # Enable you to make friends quickly and easily. # Increase your popularity. # Help you to win people to your way of thinking. # Increase your influence, your prestige, your ability to get things done. # Enable you to win new clients, new customers. # Increase your earning power. # Make you a better salesman, a better executive. # Help you to handle complaints, avoid arguments, keep your human contacts smooth and pleasant. # Make you a better speaker, a more entertaining conversationalist. # Make the principles of psychology easy for you to apply in your daily contacts. # Help you to arouse enthusiasm among your associates. The book has six major sections. The core principles of each section are explained and quoted from below.Each section is a paraphrase of the main ideas written and developed by Dale Carnegie. Dale Carnegie, How to Win Friends and Influence People (Gallery: New York, 1998). Fundamental Techniques in Handling People # Don't criticize, condemn, or complain. Human nature does not like to admit fault. When people are criticized or humiliated, they rarely respond well and will often become defensive and resent their critic. To handle people well, we must never criticize, condemn or complain because it will never result in the behavior we desire. # Give honest and sincere appreciation. Appreciation is one of the most powerful tools in the world. People will rarely work at their maximum potential under criticism, but honest appreciation brings out their best. Appreciation, though, is not simple flattery, it must be sincere, meaningful and with love. # Arouse in the other person an eager want. To get what we want from another person, we must forget our own perspective and begin to see things from the point of view of others. When we can combine our desires with their wants, they become eager to work with us and we can mutually achieve our objectives. Six Ways to Make People Like You # Become genuinely interested in other people. \\"You can make more friends in two months by being interested in them, than in two years by making them interested in you.\\" The only way to make quality, lasting friendships is to learn to be genuinely interested in them and their interests. # Smile. Happiness does not depend on outside circumstances, but rather on inward attitudes. Smiles are free to give and have an amazing ability to make others feel wonderful. Smile in everything that you do. # Remember that a person's name is, to that person, the sweetest and most important sound in any language. \\"The average person is more interested in their own name than in all the other names in the world put together.\\" People love their names so much that they will often donate large amounts of money just to have a building named after themselves. We can make people feel extremely valued and important by remembering their name. # Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves. The easiest way to become a good conversationalist is to become a good listener. To be a good listener, we must actually care about what people have to say. Many times people don't want an entertaining conversation partner; they just want someone who will listen to them. # Talk in terms of the other person's interest. The royal road to a person's heart is to talk about the things he or she treasures most. If we talk to people about what they are interested in, they will feel valued and value us in return. # Make the other person feel important ‚Äì and do it sincerely. The golden rule is to treat other people how we would like to be treated. We love to feel important and so does everyone else. People will talk to us for hours if we allow them to talk about themselves. If we can make people feel important in a sincere and appreciative way, then we will win all the friends we could ever dream of. Twelve Ways to Win People to Your Way of Thinking # The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it. Whenever we argue with someone, no matter if we win or lose the argument, we still lose. The other person will either feel humiliated or strengthened and will only seek to bolster their own position. We must try to avoid arguments whenever we can. # Show respect for the other person's opinions. Never say \\"You're wrong.\\" We must never tell people flat out that they are wrong. It will only serve to offend them and insult their pride. No one likes to be humiliated; we must not be so blunt. # If you're wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically. Whenever we are wrong we should admit it immediately. When we fight we never get enough, but by yielding we often get more than we expected. When we admit that we are wrong people trust us and begin to sympathize with our way of thinking. # Begin in a friendly way. \\"A drop of honey can catch more flies than a gallon of gall.\\" If we begin our interactions with others in a friendly way, people will be more receptive. Even if we are greatly upset, we must be friendly to influence people to our way of thinking. # Start with questions to which the other person will answer yes. Do not begin by emphasizing the aspects in which we and the other person differ. Begin by emphasizing and continue emphasizing the things on which we agree. People must be started in the affirmative direction and they will often follow readily. Never tell someone they are wrong, but rather lead them where we would like them to go with questions that they will answer \\"yes\\" to. # Let the other person do a great deal of the talking. People do not like listening to us boast, they enjoy doing the talking themselves. Let them rationalize and talk about the idea, because it will taste much sweeter to them in their own mouth. # Let the other person feel the idea is his or hers. People inherently like ideas they come to on their own better than those that are handed to them on a platter. Ideas can best be carried out by allowing others to think they arrived at it themselves. # Try honestly to see things from the other person's point of view. Other people may often be wrong, but we cannot condemn them. We must seek to understand them. Success in dealing with people requires a sympathetic grasp of the other person's viewpoint. # Be sympathetic with the other person's ideas and desires. People are hungering for sympathy. They want us to recognize all that they desire and feel. If we can sympathize with others, they will appreciate our side as well and will often come around to our way of thinking. # Appeal to the nobler motives. Everyone likes to be glorious in their own eyes. People believe that they do things for noble and morally upright reasons. If we can appeal to others' noble motives we can successfully convince them to follow our ideas. # Dramatize your ideas. In this fast-paced world, simply stating a truth isn't enough. The truth must be made vivid, interesting, and dramatic. Television has been doing it for years. Sometimes ideas are not enough and we must dramatize them. # Throw down a challenge. The thing that most motivates people is the game. Everyone desires to excel and prove their worth. If we want someone to do something, we must give them a challenge and they will often rise to meet it. Be a Leader: How to Change People Without Giving Offense or Arousing Resentment # Begin with praise and honest appreciation. People will do things begrudgingly for criticism and an iron-fisted leader, but they will work wonders when they are praised and appreciated. # Call attention to people's mistakes indirectly. No one likes to make mistakes, especially in front of others. Scolding and blaming only serve to humiliate. If we subtly and indirectly show people mistakes, they will appreciate us and be more likely to improve. # Talk about your own mistakes before criticizing the other person. When something goes wrong, taking responsibility can help win others to your side. People do not like to shoulder all the blame and taking credit for mistakes helps to remove the sting from our critiques of others. # Ask questions instead of giving direct orders. No one likes to take orders. If we offer suggestions, rather than orders, it will boost others' confidence and allow them to learn quickly from their mistakes. # Let the other person save face. Nothing diminishes the dignity of a man quite like an insult to his pride. If we don't condemn our employees in front of others and allow them to save face, they will be motivated to do better in the future and confident that they can. # Praise every improvement. People love to receive praise and admiration. If we truly want someone to improve at something, we must praise their every advance. \\"Abilities wither under criticism, they blossom under encouragement.\\"Dale Carnegie, How to Win Friends and Influence People New York: Gallery, 1998. 220. # Give the other person a fine reputation to live up to. If we give people a great reputation to live up to, they will desire to embody the characteristics with which we have described them. People will work with vigor and confidence if they believe they can be better. # Use encouragement. Make the fault seem easy to correct. If a desired outcome seems like a momentous task, people will give up and lose heart. But if a fault seems easy to correct, they will readily jump at the opportunity to improve. If we frame objectives as small and easy improvements, we will see dramatic increases in desire and success in our employees. # Make the other person happy about doing what you suggest. People will most often respond well when they desire to do the behavior put forth. If we want to influence people and become effective leaders, we must learn to frame our desires in terms of others' desires. Letters That Produced Miraculous Results :In this chapter, the shortest in the book, Carnegie analyzes two letters and describes how to appeal to someone with the term \\"do me a favor\\" as opposed to directly asking for something which does not offer the same feeling of importance to the recipient of the request. Seven Rules For Making Your Home Life Happier # Don't nag. # Don't try to make your partner over. # Don't criticize. # Give honest appreciation. # Pay little attentions. # Be courteous. # Read a good book on the sexual side of marriage. Origins Before How to Win Friends and Influence People was released, the genre of self-help books had an ample heritage. Authors such as Orison Swett Marden, and Samuel Smiles had enormous success with their self-help books in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Dale Carnegie began his career not as a writer, but as a teacher of public speaking. He started out teaching night classes at a YMCA in New York and his classes became wildly popular and highly attended. The success of the classes in New York prompted YMCAs in Philadelphia and Baltimore to begin hosting the course as well.Lowell Thomas, Shortcut to Distinction Introduction to How to Win Friends and Influence People. (New York: Gallery, 1998) 103. After even greater success, Carnegie decided to begin teaching the courses on his own at hotels in London, Paris, New York, Boston, Philadelphia, and Baltimore. Because he could not find any satisfactory handbook already in publication, Carnegie originally began writing small booklets to go along with his courses.Steven Watts, Self-Help Messiah (New York: Other, 2013) After one of his 14-week courses, he was approached by publisher Leon Shimkin of the publishing house Simon & Schuster. Shimkin urged Carnegie to write a book, but he was not initially persuaded. Shimken then hired a stenographer to type up what he heard in one of Carnegie's long lectures and presented the transcript to Carnegie. Dale Carnegie liked the transcript so much he decided to edit and revise it into a final form.Giles, Kemp. Dale Carnegie (New York: St. Martin's, 1989) 137‚Äì141 He wanted it to be extremely practical and interesting to read. To market the book, Shimkin decided to send 500 copies of the book to former graduates of the Dale Carnegie Course, with a note that pointed out the utility of the book for refreshing students with the advice they had learned.Giles, Kemp. Dale Carnegie (New York: St. Martin's, 1989) The 500 mailed copies brought orders for over 5,000 more copies of the book and Simon & Schuster had to increase the original print order of 1,200 quickly. Shimkin also ran a full page ad in the New York Times complete with quotes by Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller on the importance of human relations. Originally published in November 1936, the book reached the New York Times best-seller list by the end of the year, and did not fall off for the next two years. Simon & Schuster continued to advertise the book relying heavily on testimonials as well as the testable approach the book offered. Reception=Impact How to Win Friends and Influence People became one of the most successful books in American history. It went through 17 print editions in its first year of publishing and sold 250,000 copies in the first three months. The book has sold over 30 million copies worldwide since and annually sells in excess of 250,000 copies.Irwyn Applebaum, president of Pocket Books, Simon & Schuster's mass-market arm, cited that sales of the book had been over one million between 1982 and 1986.work=New York Times, October 25th, 1986. https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/25/books/reluctant-dale-carnegie-s-50-year- old-classic.html A 2013 Library of Congress survey ranked Carnegie's volume as the seventh most influential book in American history.Steven Watts, Self-Help Messiah (New York: Other, 2013) 2‚Äì4 How to Win Friends and Influence People was number eight on the list of \\"Top Check Outs OF ALL TIME\\" by the New York Public Library.https://gothamist.com/arts-entertainment/nypl-most-checked-out- books-ever Critical assessment After How to Win Friends and Influence People was published in November 1936 and ascended rapidly on best-seller lists, the New York Times reviewed it in February 1937. They offered a balanced criticism arguing that Carnegie indeed offered insightful advice in dealing with people, but that his wisdom was extremely simple and should not overrule the foundation of actual knowledge. The satirical writer Sinclair Lewis waited a year to offer his scathing critique. He described Carnegie's method as teaching people to \\"smile and bob and pretend to be interested in other people's hobbies precisely so that you may screw things out of them.\\"Sinclair Lewis, quoted in Tom Sant, The Giants of Sales. (New York: AMACOM, 2006) 96.Giles, Kemp. Dale Carnegie (New York: St. Martin's, 1989) 152. However, despite the criticism, sales continued to soar and the book was talked about and reviewed as it rapidly became mainstream. Scholarly critique however, was little and oscillated over time. Due to the book's lay appeal, it was not significantly discussed in academic journals. In the early stages of the book's life, the few scholarly reviews that were written explained the contents of the book and attempted to describe what made the book popular.Symons, A. E. 1937. The Australian Quarterly, 9 (3). Australian Institute of Policy and Science: 115‚Äì16. As time passed however, scholarly reviews became more critical, chiding Carnegie for being insincere and manipulative.Parker, Gail Thain. 1977. \\"How to Win Friends and Influence People: Dale Carnegie and the Problem of Sincerity\\". American Quarterly 29 (5). Johns Hopkins University Press: 506‚Äì18. Despite the lack of attention in academic circles, How to Win Friends and Influence People was written for a popular audience and Carnegie successfully captured the attention of his target. The book experienced mass consumption and appeared in many popular periodicals, including garnering 10 pages in the January 1937 edition of Reader's Digest. The book continued to remain at the top of best-seller lists and was even noted in the New York Times to have been extremely successful in Nazi Germany, much to the writer's bewilderment. He wrote that Carnegie would rate \\"butter higher than guns as a means of winning friends\\" something \\"diametrically opposite to the official German view.\\" Despite the negative comments from his critics, Carnegie's book established a new genre. Carnegie described his book as an \\"action-book\\" but the category he created has since become known as the self-help genre. Almost every self-help book since has borrowed some type of style or form from Carnegie's \\"path-breaking best seller.\\"Giles, Kemp. Dale Carnegie (New York: St. Martin's, 1989) 147.

Groza was professional football's career kicking and points leader when he retired after the 1967 season. He played in 21 seasons for the Browns, helping the team to win eight league championships in that span. Groza's accuracy and strength as a kicker influenced the development of place-kicking as a specialty; he could kick field goals from beyond at a time when attempts from that distance were a rarity. He set numerous records for distance and number of field goals kicked during his career. Groza grew up in an athletic family in Martins Ferry, Ohio. He enrolled at Ohio State University on a scholarship in 1942, but after just one year in college, he enlisted in the U.S. Army and was sent to serve in World War II. Groza deployed as an army surgical technician in the Pacific theater, where he stayed until returning in 1946 to play for the Browns. Helped by Groza's kicking and play at offensive tackle, the Browns won the AAFC championship every year between 1946 and 1949, when the league disbanded and the Browns were absorbed by the more established NFL. Cleveland won the NFL championship in its first year in the league on a last- minute field goal by Groza. Groza set NFL records for field goals made in 1950, 1952 and 1953. Sporting News named him the league's Most Valuable Player in 1954, when the Browns won another championship. The team repeated as NFL champions in 1955. Groza retired briefly after the 1959 season due to a back injury, but returned in 1961. He was part of a 1964 team that won another NFL championship. Groza retired for good after the 1967 season. Later in life, he ran an insurance business and served as a team ambassador for the Browns. He was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1974. In 1992, the Palm Beach County Sports Commission named the Lou Groza Award after him. The award is given annually to the country's best college placekicker. Groza died in 2000 of a heart attack. Early life Born in eastern Ohio in Martins Ferry, just north and across the Ohio River from Wheeling, West Virginia, Groza's parents were immigrants from Transylvania, Austria-Hungary (today in Romania). His Hungarian mother Mary and Romanian father John (Ioan) Groza owned and ran Groza's Tavern on Main Street. Lou was the smallest in stature of four boys in an athletic family; his brother Alex became a star basketball player at the University of Kentucky, a member of two national championship teams. Groza lettered in football, basketball, and baseball at Martins Ferry High School. The Purple Riders won the state basketball championship in 1941, when Groza was its captain. He was also captain of the baseball team. Groza learned placekicking from his older brother Frank, and practiced by trying to kick balls over telephone wires when he and his friends played touch football in the street. College career and military service Groza graduated from high school in 1942 and enrolled on an athletic scholarship at the Ohio State University in Columbus, where he played as a tackle and placekicker on the Buckeyes' freshman team. Groza played in three games and kicked five field goals, including one from away. In 1943, he enlisted in the U.S. Army as World War II intensified. He first went for basic training to Abilene, Texas, and then to Brooks General Hospital in San Antonio. After a stint with the short- lived Army Service Training Program, Groza was sent with the 96th Infantry Division to serve as a surgical technician in Leyte, Okinawa, and other places in the Pacific theater in 1945. The day he landed in the Philippines, Groza saw a soldier shot in the face. He was stationed in a bank of tents about five miles from the front lines and helped doctors tend to the wounded. \\"I saw a lot of men wounded with severe injuries\\", he later said. \\"Lose legs, guts hanging out, stuff like that. It's a tough thing, but you get hardened to it, and you accept it as part of your being there.\\" While he was in the Army, he received a package from Paul Brown, the Ohio State football coach. It contained footballs and a contract for him to sign to play on a team Brown was coaching in the new All-America Football Conference (AAFC). He signed the contract in May 1945 and agreed to join the team, called the Cleveland Browns, after the war ended in 1946. Groza got $500 a month stipend until the end of the war and a $7,500 annual salary. Professional career Following his discharge from military service, Groza reported to the Browns' training camp in Bowling Green, Ohio. He showed up in army fatigues carrying all his clothes in a duffel bag. There, he joined quarterback Otto Graham, fullback Marion Motley and receivers Dante Lavelli and Mac Speedie to form the core of the new team's offense. Groza was mainly a placekicker in his first two years with the Browns, but he played a big part in the team's early success. In his first season, he set a professional football record for both field goals and extra points. The Browns, meanwhile, advanced to the AAFC championship against the New York Yankees. Groza sprained his ankle in the game and missed three field goals, but Cleveland won 14‚Äì9. Behind a powerful offense led by Graham, Motley and Lavelli, the Browns finished the 1947 season with a 12‚Äì1‚Äì1 record and made it back to the championship game. Groza, however, was injured and could only watch as the team won its second championship in a row. Further success followed for the Browns and Groza, who was nicknamed \\"The Toe\\" by a sportswriter for his kicking abilities. Groza led the league in field goals and the team won all of its games in 1948, recording professional football's first perfect season. As he grew into a star placekicker, Groza began playing regularly at offensive tackle beginning in 1948. One highlight of that year for Groza was a 53-yard field goal against the AAFC's Brooklyn Dodgers that was then the longest kick in pro football history. With Groza, the Browns could attempt field goals at a range many other teams could not. \\"Anywhere from , he was a weapon\\", Tommy James, Groza's holder for eight years, later said. Another championship win followed in 1949, but the AAFC dissolved after the season, and the Browns were among three teams absorbed by the more established National Football League (NFL). The war had shortened Groza's college career, so he continued to study at Ohio State in the offseason in his early years with the Browns. He graduated with a degree in business in 1949. Groza married that year, to Jackie Lou Robbins, a girl from Martins Ferry who was working as a model in New York City when they first dated. The Browns' debut in the NFL in the 1950 season was closely watched; while the team dominated the AAFC in its short existence, some sportswriters, NFL owners and coaches considered the league inferior. Cleveland put all doubts to rest in its first game against the two-time defending champion Philadelphia Eagles, winning 35‚Äì10. In a game against the Washington Redskins later in the season, Groza broke a 24-year-old NFL record by kicking his 13th field goal of the season. He also scored the only touchdown of his career in that game on a reception from Graham. The Browns ended the regular season with a 10‚Äì2 record in the American Conference, tied with the New York Giants. That forced a playoff against the Giants in which Groza kicked the winning field goal for the Browns with under a minute to play. The game-winning field goal in the 1950 NFL championship was the highlight of Groza's long career. Lou Groza \\"The Toe\\" in 1959. The Browns next faced the Los Angeles Rams in the championship game. Groza came into the game as the NFL's leading kicker, both in terms of points scored and accuracy. He had a success rate of 68.4% in an era when most teams made fewer than half of their attempts. The Rams went ahead early in the game on a touchdown pass from star quarterback Bob Waterfield and a scoring run by Dick Hoerner. But Graham and the Browns came back with four touchdowns, two to receiver Dante Lavelli. As time wound down in the fourth quarter, however, the Rams were ahead 28‚Äì27, and Cleveland had a final chance to win the game. Graham drove the offense to the Rams' nine-yard line and set up a Groza field goal attempt. The 16-yard try sailed through the uprights with 28 seconds left, giving the Browns a 30‚Äì28 victory. It was the biggest kick of Groza's career. \\"I never thought I would miss\\", he said later. After the season, Groza was named to the first-ever Pro Bowl, the NFL's all-star game. Cleveland again reached the championship game in 1951, but lost this time in a rematch against the Rams. Groza had a 52-yard field goal in the game, a record for a championship or Super Bowl that stood for 42 years. He was again named to the Pro Bowl after the season. The same scenario was repeated in 1952 and 1953: the Browns reached the championship both years, but lost both times to the Detroit Lions. Groza was playing with cracked ribs in the 1952 championship loss, and he missed three field goals. Groza set a record in 1953 when he made 23 field goals and had an 88.5% success rate, a single-season mark that stood for 28 years. He made the Pro Bowl again in 1952 and 1953, and was a first-team All-Pro selection both years. The Browns came back in 1954 to win another championship. That year, Groza was named the NFL's Most Valuable Player by Sporting News. Cleveland won the championship again in 1955, beating the Rams 38‚Äì14. Groza was named to the Pro Bowl and sportswriters' All-Pro teams in 1954 and 1955. Hurt by Graham's retirement before the season, Cleveland had its first-ever losing season in 1956. Groza's kicking continued to be a strength through the ensuing three years: he reached the Pro Bowl in 1957, 1958 and 1959, and tied Sam Baker for league leader in points scored in 1957. Cleveland reached the championship game in 1957 but lost to the Lions. The Browns lost to the New York Giants in a single-elimination playoff in 1958, and failed to reach the postseason in 1959. Groza sat out after the 1959 season due to a back injury and was presumed to be retired. While his kicking was his most visible contribution to the team, Groza was also an offensive tackle up until his injury, when Brown replaced him with Dick Schafrath. \\"Lou never got all the credit he deserved for his tackle play, probably because his great kicking skills got him more notoriety\\", Andy Robustelli, a defensive end who played against Groza, later said. Groza took 1960 off and did some scouting for the team. He also focused on an insurance business he started. \\"I was 36 and I thought I had retired\\", he said. The following year, however, he came back to the team at the urging of Art Modell, who bought the Browns that year. Not wanting to use a roster spot on a kicking specialist (Groza's back injury prevented him from playing on the line), Brown had signed Sam Baker to kick and play halfback. But Groza was eager to return and Modell insisted. Groza stayed with the team as a placekicker until 1967, and was on a Browns team that won the 1964 championship. Groza scored the first points in that game on a third-quarter field goal. He also kicked four kickoffs more than and out of the Baltimore Colts end zone, preventing a return. Cleveland won 27‚Äì0. When Groza retired for good in 1968 after 21 seasons in professional football, he held NFL career records for points scored, field goals made and extra points made. He had 234 field goals, 641 extra points, and 1,349 total points in the NFL. Counting his AAFC years, his career point total was 1,603. He was the last of the original Browns still on the team. Groza, who was 44 years old when he quit the game, said in his memoir that retiring was \\"the saddest day of my football life.\\" His top salary was $50,000 in his final year. Later life and death After Groza retired, he entertained an offer to play for the San Francisco 49ers, but was reluctant to do so because he did not want to move his family and insurance business to the West Coast. He was offered a spot with the Browns as a kicking coach, helping mentor the young Don Cockroft, but he declined. Later in life, he became an ambassador and father figure for the Browns, inviting rookies over for dinner and helping them find apartments. He continued to run a successful insurance business and lived in Berea, Ohio near the Browns' headquarters and training facility. He and his wife Jackie were known as the team's First Family. Modell relocated the Browns to Baltimore in 1995 and renamed the team the Ravens, provoking a wave of anger and disbelief from fans and former players. Groza was a leading critic of the move, saying it was \\"like some man walking off with your wife.\\" In 1996, Groza wrote a memoir titled The Toe: The Lou Groza Story. The Browns restarted as an expansion team in 1999. Groza was hobbled in the late 1990s by back and hip surgeries and Parkinson's disease. He suffered a heart attack in 2000 after dinner with his wife at Columbia Hills Country Club in Columbia Station, Ohio. He was taken to a hospital in Middleburg Heights, Ohio, where he died. He was buried in Sunset Memorial Park in North Olmsted, Ohio. Groza and his wife had three sons and a daughter. Following Groza's death, the Browns wore his number 76 on their helmets for the 2001 season. Kicking style Lou Groza's kicking shoes Groza laid a piece of tape on the ground for better accuracy before the practice was outlawed by the \\"Lou Groza Rule\\". While field goals had long been viewed as an important part of football strategy, kicking specialists were a rarity before Groza's time. Groza's success from distances of and beyond raised the bar for kickers across the league. He set single-season NFL records for accuracy, distance and number of field goals in his first three years in the league, marks that went unbeaten until kicking specialists became a common feature of the game in the early 1970s. Groza's kicking was the difference in 15% of the Browns' games during the AAFC years, and teams began to take notice when his field goals made the difference in both the NFL playoffs and the championship game in 1950. \\"Everybody started to pay attention to field goals when the Browns started to win games with them\\", Pat Summerall said. Groza led the NFL in field goals made five times in his career. Groza was a straight-ahead kicker. He approached the football in a straight line and booted it with the top of his foot, aiming for the middle of the ball. Early in his career, Groza scraped the ground with his cleats in a straight line to help guide his kicks. Later he put down a piece of one-inch adhesive tape rolled up inside his helmet. The \\"Lou Groza Rule\\" in 1950 banned the use of artificial kicking aids, including the tape. The straight-ahead style used by Groza and other kickers of his era has since been supplanted by soccer-style kicking with the side of the foot. \\"I don't know why all the kids kick soccer-style\\", he said in 1997. \\"They kick the ball with the side of their foot, which is supposed to give them better control. I don't know, I never tried it.\\" Legacy Lou Groza Boulevard in Berea, Ohio Groza was named to the National Football League 1950s All-Decade Team in 1969 and inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1974. The Browns retired his number 76; he is also in the team's Ring of Honor, a grouping of the best players in the club's history whose names are displayed below upper-deck seats at FirstEnergy Stadium. In 1992, the Palm Beach County Sports Commission established the Lou Groza Award, given to the best National Collegiate Athletic Association Football Bowl Subdivision (formerly Division I-A) kicker. One of his kicking shoes is part of the collection of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. In 2006, Lou was inducted into the National High School Hall of Fame for his athletic exploits in baseball, basketball & football at Martins Ferry High School where he earned 12 varsity letters and led the football and basketball teams to State championships. In 1941 as a junior, Lou led the Martins Ferry High School basketball team to the class A championship. He set a State record for points scored in the four tournament games with 51. In the State semi-final game against Xenia Central, he hit two free throws with no time left on the clock to secure the victory. In the title game, he was high scorer with 18 points. He was named tournament MVP, a member of the All-State Tournament Team, and first team All-Ohio center. In 1941 as a senior, he led the Martins Ferry High School football team to a share of the State championship tying Toledo Libbey 14-14. Lou started as offensive and defensive tackle as well as being the place kicker. He was selected first team All-Ohio by both the Associated Press and United Press International. During his high school years, he was named Captain of the football, basketball and baseball teams.

The blue arrows represent the direction and magnitude of the gravitational force on the Earth. Applying this to both the Earth's and the Moon's position does not disturb the positions relative to each other. When it is subtracted from the force on the Moon (black arrows), what is left is the perturbing force (red arrows) on the Moon relative to the Earth. Because the perturbing force is different in direction and magnitude on opposite sides of the orbit, it produces a change in the shape of the orbit. In astronomy, perturbation is the complex motion of a massive body subject to forces other than the gravitational attraction of a single other massive body.Bate, Mueller, White (1971): ch. 9, p. 385. The other forces can include a third (fourth, fifth, etc.) body, resistance, as from an atmosphere, and the off-center attraction of an oblate or otherwise misshapen body.  Introduction  The study of perturbations began with the first attempts to predict planetary motions in the sky. In ancient times the causes were a mystery. Newton, at the time he formulated his laws of motion and of gravitation, applied them to the first analysis of perturbations, recognizing the complex difficulties of their calculation.Newton in 1684 wrote: \\"By reason of the deviation of the Sun from the center of gravity, the centripetal force does not always tend to that immobile center, and hence the planets neither move exactly in ellipses nor revolve twice in the same orbit. Each time a planet revolves it traces a fresh orbit, as in the motion of the Moon, and each orbit depends on the combined motions of all the planets, not to mention the action of all these on each other. But to consider simultaneously all these causes of motion and to define these motions by exact laws admitting of easy calculation exceeds, if I am not mistaken, the force of any human mind.\\" (quoted by Prof G E Smith (Tufts University), in \\"Three Lectures on the Role of Theory in Science\\" 1. Closing the loop: Testing Newtonian Gravity, Then and Now); and Prof R F Egerton (Portland State University, Oregon) after quoting the same passage from Newton concluded: \\"Here, Newton identifies the \\"many body problem\\" which remains unsolved analytically.\\" Many of the great mathematicians since then have given attention to the various problems involved; throughout the 18th and 19th centuries there was demand for accurate tables of the position of the Moon and planets for marine navigation. The complex motions of gravitational perturbations can be broken down. The hypothetical motion that the body follows under the gravitational effect of one other body only is typically a conic section, and can be readily described with the methods of geometry. This is called a two-body problem, or an unperturbed Keplerian orbit. The differences between that and the actual motion of the body are perturbations due to the additional gravitational effects of the remaining body or bodies. If there is only one other significant body then the perturbed motion is a three-body problem; if there are multiple other bodies it is an n-body problem. A general analytical solution (a mathematical expression to predict the positions and motions at any future time) exists for the two-body problem; when more than two bodies are considered analytic solutions exist only for special cases. Even the two-body problem becomes insoluble if one of the bodies is irregular in shape.Roy (1988): ch. 6, 7. Mercury's orbital longitude and latitude, as perturbed by Venus, Jupiter and all of the planets of the Solar System, at intervals of 2.5 days. Mercury would remain centered on the crosshairs if there were no perturbations. Most systems that involve multiple gravitational attractions present one primary body which is dominant in its effects (for example, a star, in the case of the star and its planet, or a planet, in the case of the planet and its satellite). The gravitational effects of the other bodies can be treated as perturbations of the hypothetical unperturbed motion of the planet or satellite around its primary body.  Mathematical analysis = General perturbations  In methods of general perturbations, general differential equations, either of motion or of change in the orbital elements, are solved analytically, usually by series expansions. The result is usually expressed in terms of algebraic and trigonometric functions of the orbital elements of the body in question and the perturbing bodies. This can be applied generally to many different sets of conditions, and is not specific to any particular set of gravitating objects.Bate, Mueller, White (1971): p. 387; sec. 9.4.3, p. 410. Historically, general perturbations were investigated first. The classical methods are known as variation of the elements, variation of parameters or variation of the constants of integration. In these methods, it is considered that the body is always moving in a conic section, however the conic section is constantly changing due to the perturbations. If all perturbations were to cease at any particular instant, the body would continue in this (now unchanging) conic section indefinitely; this conic is known as the osculating orbit and its orbital elements at any particular time are what are sought by the methods of general perturbations. General perturbations takes advantage of the fact that in many problems of celestial mechanics, the two-body orbit changes rather slowly due to the perturbations; the two-body orbit is a good first approximation. General perturbations is applicable only if the perturbing forces are about one order of magnitude smaller, or less, than the gravitational force of the primary body. In the Solar System, this is usually the case; Jupiter, the second largest body, has a mass of about 1/1000 that of the Sun. General perturbation methods are preferred for some types of problems, as the source of certain observed motions are readily found. This is not necessarily so for special perturbations; the motions would be predicted with similar accuracy, but no information on the configurations of the perturbing bodies (for instance, an orbital resonance) which caused them would be available.  Special perturbations  In methods of special perturbations, numerical datasets, representing values for the positions, velocities and accelerative forces on the bodies of interest, are made the basis of numerical integration of the differential equations of motion.Bate, Mueller, White (1971), pp. 387‚Äì409. In effect, the positions and velocities are perturbed directly, and no attempt is made to calculate the curves of the orbits or the orbital elements.Moulton (1914): ch. IX Special perturbations can be applied to any problem in celestial mechanics, as it is not limited to cases where the perturbing forces are small. Once applied only to comets and minor planets, special perturbation methods are now the basis of the most accurate machine-generated planetary ephemerides of the great astronomical almanacs.See, for instance, Jet Propulsion Laboratory Development Ephemeris. Special perturbations are also used for modeling an orbit with computers. = Cowell's formulation = Cowell's method. Forces from all perturbing bodies (black and gray) are summed to form the total force on body i (red), and this is numerically integrated starting from the initial position (the epoch of osculation). Cowell's formulation (so named for Philip H. Cowell, who, with A.C.D. Cromellin, used a similar method to predict the return of Halley's comet) is perhaps the simplest of the special perturbation methods. In a system of n mutually interacting bodies, this method mathematically solves for the Newtonian forces on body i by summing the individual interactions from the other j bodies: :\\\\mathbf{\\\\ddot{r}}_i = \\\\sum_{\\\\underset{j e i}{j=1}}^n {Gm_j (\\\\mathbf{r}_j-\\\\mathbf{r}_i) \\\\over r_{ij}^3} where \\\\mathbf{\\\\ddot{r}}_i is the acceleration vector of body i, G is the gravitational constant, m_j is the mass of body j, \\\\mathbf{r}_i and \\\\mathbf{r}_j are the position vectors of objects i and j respectively, and r_{ij} is the distance from object i to object j. All vectors being referred to the barycenter of the system. This equation is resolved into components in x, y, and z and these are integrated numerically to form the new velocity and position vectors. This process is repeated as many times as necessary. The advantage of Cowell's method is ease of application and programming. A disadvantage is that when perturbations become large in magnitude (as when an object makes a close approach to another) the errors of the method also become large. , chapter 11. However, for many problems in celestial mechanics, this is never the case. Another disadvantage is that in systems with a dominant central body, such as the Sun, it is necessary to carry many significant digits in the arithmetic because of the large difference in the forces of the central body and the perturbing bodies, although with modern computers this is not nearly the limitation it once was. , p. 91 ff. = Encke's method = Encke's method. Greatly exaggerated here, the small difference Œ¥r (blue) between the osculating, unperturbed orbit (black) and the perturbed orbit (red), is numerically integrated starting from the initial position (the epoch of osculation). Encke's method begins with the osculating orbit as a reference and integrates numerically to solve for the variation from the reference as a function of time. Its advantages are that perturbations are generally small in magnitude, so the integration can proceed in larger steps (with resulting lesser errors), and the method is much less affected by extreme perturbations. Its disadvantage is complexity; it cannot be used indefinitely without occasionally updating the osculating orbit and continuing from there, a process known as rectification. Encke's method is similar to the general perturbation method of variation of the elements, except the rectification is performed at discrete intervals rather than continuously. Battin (1999), sec. 10.2. Letting \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\rho} be the radius vector of the osculating orbit, \\\\mathbf{r} the radius vector of the perturbed orbit, and \\\\delta \\\\mathbf{r} the variation from the osculating orbit, = \\\\mathbf{\\\\ddot{r}} - \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\ddot{\\\\rho}}.}} \\\\mathbf{\\\\ddot{r}} and \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\ddot{\\\\rho}} are just the equations of motion of \\\\mathbf{r} and \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\rho}, = \\\\mathbf{a}_{\\\\text{per}} - {\\\\mu \\\\over r^3} \\\\mathbf{r} for the perturbed orbit and }} = - {\\\\mu \\\\over \\\\rho^3} \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\rho} for the unperturbed orbit,}} where \\\\mu = G(M+m) is the gravitational parameter with M and m the masses of the central body and the perturbed body, \\\\mathbf{a}_{\\\\text{per}} is the perturbing acceleration, and r and \\\\rho are the magnitudes of \\\\mathbf{r} and \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\rho}.

Since the osculating orbit is easily calculated by two-body methods, \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\rho} and \\\\delta \\\\mathbf{r} are accounted for and \\\\mathbf{r} can be solved. In practice, the quantity in the brackets, {\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\rho} \\\\over \\\\rho^3} - {\\\\mathbf{r} \\\\over r^3} , is the difference of two nearly equal vectors, and further manipulation is necessary to avoid the need for extra significant digits. Bate, Mueller, White (1971), sec. 9.3. Roy (1988), sec. 7.4. Encke's method was more widely used before the advent of modern computers, when much orbit computation was performed on mechanical calculating machines.  Periodic nature  Gravity Simulator plot of the changing orbital eccentricity of Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars over the next 50,000 years. The 0 point on this plot is the year 2007. In the Solar System, many of the disturbances of one planet by another are periodic, consisting of small impulses each time a planet passes another in its orbit. This causes the bodies to follow motions that are periodic or quasi-periodic - such as the Moon in its strongly perturbed orbit, which is the subject of lunar theory. This periodic nature led to the discovery of Neptune in 1846 as a result of its perturbations of the orbit of Uranus. On-going mutual perturbations of the planets cause long-term quasi-periodic variations in their orbital elements, most apparent when two planets' orbital periods are nearly in sync. For instance, five orbits of Jupiter (59.31 years) is nearly equal to two of Saturn (58.91 years). This causes large perturbations of both, with a period of 918 years, the time required for the small difference in their positions at conjunction to make one complete circle, first discovered by Laplace. Venus currently has the orbit with the least eccentricity, i.e. it is the closest to circular, of all the planetary orbits. In 25,000 years' time, Earth will have a more circular (less eccentric) orbit than Venus. It has been shown that long-term periodic disturbances within the Solar System can become chaotic over very long time scales; under some circumstances one or more planets can cross the orbit of another, leading to collisions.see references at Stability of the Solar System The orbits of many of the minor bodies of the Solar System, such as comets, are often heavily perturbed, particularly by the gravitational fields of the gas giants. While many of these perturbations are periodic, others are not, and these in particular may represent aspects of chaotic motion. For example, in April 1996, Jupiter's gravitational influence caused the period of Comet Hale‚ÄìBopp's orbit to decrease from 4,206 to 2,380 years, a change that will not revert on any periodic basis.

Typically, the general price level is approximated with a daily price index, normally the Daily CPI. The general price level can change more than once per day during hyperinflation.  Theoretical foundation  The classical dichotomy is the assumption that there is a relatively clean distinction between overall increases or decreases in prices and underlying, ‚Äúnominal‚Äù economic variables. Thus, if prices overall increase or decrease, it is assumed that this change can be decomposed as follows: Given a set C of goods and services, the total value of transactions in C at time t is :\\\\sum_{c\\\\,\\\\in\\\\, C} (p_{c,t}\\\\cdot q_{c,t})=\\\\sum_{c\\\\,\\\\in\\\\, C} [(P_t\\\\cdot p'_{c,t})\\\\cdot q_{c,t}]=P_t\\\\cdot \\\\sum_{c\\\\,\\\\in\\\\, C} (p'_{c,t}\\\\cdot q_{c,t}) where :q_{c,t}\\\\, represents the quantity of c at time t :p_{c,t}\\\\, represents the prevailing price of c at time t :p'_{c,t} represents the ‚Äúreal‚Äù price of c at time t :P_t is the price level at time t The general price level is distinguished from a price index in that the existence of the former depends upon the classical dichotomy, while the latter is simply a computation, and many such will be possible regardless of whether they are meaningful.  Significance  If, indeed, a general price level component could be distinguished, then it would be possible to measure the difference in overall prices between two regions or intervals. For example, the inflation rate could be measured as :\\\\frac{(P_{t_1}-P_{t_0})/P_{t_0}}{t_1 -t_0} and ‚Äúreal‚Äù economic growth or contraction could be distinguished from mere price changes by deflating GDP or some other measure. :\\\\frac{(GDP)_{t_1}}{P_{t_1}}-\\\\frac{(GDP)_{t_0}}{P_{t_0}}  Measuring price level  Applicable indices are the consumer price index (CPI), Default Price Deflator, and the Producer Price Index. Price indices not only affect the rate of inflation, but are also part of real output and productivity.SAMUELSON, P. A., NORDHAUS, W. D. Ekonomie. 19. vyd√°n√≠. Praha: NS Svoboda, 2013. 715 s. .

It also encompasses analyses of the potential causes of skin diseases at a basic level. Dermatopathologists work in close association with clinical dermatologists, with many possessing further clinical training in dermatology.http://www.abderm.org/subspecialties/derm.html Dermatologists are able to recognize most skin diseases based on their appearances, anatomic distributions, and behavior. Sometimes, however, those criteria do not allow a conclusive diagnosis to be made, and a skin biopsy is taken to be examined under the microscope or are subject to other molecular tests. That process reveals the histology of the disease and results in a specific diagnostic interpretation. In some cases, additional specialized testing needs to be performed on biopsies, including immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, flow cytometry, and molecular-pathologic analysis.http://www.dermnetnz.org/doctors/dermatopathology/stains.html One of the greatest challenges of dermatopathology is its scope. More than 1500 different disorders of the skin exist, including cutaneous eruptions (\\"rashes\\") and neoplasms (dermatological oncology deals with pre-cancers, such as an actinic keratosis; and cancers, including both benign masses, and malignant cancers- such as basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and most dangerously, malignant melanoma). Non-cancerous conditions include vitiligo, impetigo, purpura, pruritus, spider veins, warts, moles, oral or genital herpes, chancre sores of syphilis, exposure to poison ivy and similar plants or other venom sources, rashes, cysts, abscesses, corns, and dermabrasions or cases dealing with wrinkles, peeling skin, or autoimmune attacks on the skin. Therefore, dermatopathologists must maintain a broad base of knowledge in clinical dermatology, and be familiar with several other specialty areas in Medicine.http://booksfriend.blogspot.com/2010/10/dermatopathology-third- edition-by.html Certification in dermatopathology in the United States and several other countries requires the completion of a medical degree, followed by residency training of 3 years in dermatology or 3 years in anatomic pathology (often completed as part of a 4-year combined residency in anatomic pathology and clinical pathology). Thereafter, an additional 1 or 2 years of post-residency education in dermatopathology is undertaken. For trainees with a primary background in pathology, the fellowship experience includes the equivalent of 6 months of clinical dermatology, and for those whose training is primarily in dermatology, 6 months of the fellowship are devoted to anatomic pathology. In the United States, dermatopathologists are first certified by the American Boards of Pathology or Dermatology, or the American Osteopathic Boards of Pathology or Dermatology, in the United Kingdom dermatopathologist are certified by the Royal College of Pathologist, and in the rest of the world by the International Board of Dermatopathology. Trainees then obtain subspecialty certification (termed \\"special competence\\") or Diploma in dermatopathology by written examination.http://www.abpath.org/ Since 2003, the International Board of Dermatopathology (IBDP)‚Äîheadquartered in Graz, Austria‚Äîalso has certified candidates from countries around the world. This is done by IBDP review of applicants' professional qualifications, and a written and practical examination that is given in Europe each year.http://www.icdermpath.org/1/ In the United States, dermatopathology is practiced in a variety of settings. Some biopsies are interpreted by the dermatologists who obtained them, some are sent to pathology laboratories and interpreted either by general pathologists or dermatopathologists, while others are interpreted at specialized dermatopathology laboratories. Only a few of the latter exist outside of the United States.

His 1962 independent film David and Lisa earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Director and Best Original Screenplay (written by his then-wife, Eleanor Perry). The couple collaborated on five more films including the cult classic The Swimmer starring Burt Lancaster, Diary of a Mad Housewife starring Carrie Snodgress, and the Emmy Award‚Äìnominated A Christmas Memory, which was based on a short story by Truman Capote and also adapted by his wife Eleanor. Perry went on to form Corsair Pictures, which was privately financed by United Artists Theatres, producing two film flops, Miss Firecracker and A Shock to the System, before folding. His later films include the Razzie Award‚Äìnominee Joan Crawford biographical drama Mommie Dearest and the documentary On the Bridge, about his battle with prostate cancer. Early life Frank Joseph Perry Jr. was born in New York City, to stockbroker Frank Joseph Perry Sr. and Pauline E. Schwab, who worked at Alcoholics Anonymous. As a teenager, Frank Jr. began pursuing his interest in the theater with a job as a parking lot attendant for the Westport Country Playhouse in nearby Westport, Connecticut. He attended the University of Miami. Frank also studied under Lee Strasberg in New York. He produced several plays at Westport Country Playhouse and then turned for a time to producing television documentaries. Career A veteran of the Korean War, he returned to the entertainment industry after being discharged and made his directorial debut in 1962 with the low-budget drama film David and Lisa. Based on the novel by Theodore Isaac Rubin, the screenplay was written by his wife, Eleanor Rosenfeld, who received a nomination for an Academy Award for Writing Adapted Screenplay. A character study of two emotionally disturbed teenagers, the film was successful at the box office and met with much critical acclaim, earning him a nomination for an Academy Award for Directing. Both Perrys would eventually join the select group of non-actors awarded membership in Actors Studio. Perry went on to direct and produce a number of films, many based on literary sources or with strong literary associations, including The Swimmer (1968) based on a John Cheever story, Last Summer (1969), and Trilogy (1969), written by Truman Capote. Perry is known for his character studies involving a dysfunctional family, such as that in his wife's script of the Sue Kaufman novel Diary of a Mad Housewife (1970). That film earned a Best Actress Oscar nomination for Carrie Snodgress, and Play It as It Lays (1972), starring Tuesday Weld, brought her a Golden Globe Best Actress nomination. Both of these films Perry produced and directed, though he is probably best remembered for directing the notorious 1981 low-budget biographical drama Mommie Dearest, an adaptation of a biography by actress Joan Crawford's adoptive daughter, which portrayed the famous movie star as a crazed, sadistic control freak and fraud who cared more about money and fame than family. The film became a cult classic despite mixed reviews from critics; it also won the Razzie Award for worst picture and Frank Perry was nominated for worst director, while actress Faye Dunaway received the Razzie booby prize for her performance. Some of Perry's film-related material and personal papers are held at the Wesleyan University Cinema Archives, a collection to which scholars and media experts from around the world today have full access. Personal life and death In 1958, Frank married his first wife Eleanor, who was 15 years his senior. Frank and Eleanor collaborated on many screen projects, including screenwriting the Academy Award-nominated 1962 David and Lisa. They divorced in 1971 on grounds of incompatibility. In 1979, Eleanor Perry wrote the novel Blue Pages, based on their relationship. She died of cancer two years later, at age 66. In 1977, Perry married his second wife, Barbara Goldsmith, founding editor of New York magazine and book author (Little Gloria ‚Ä¶ Happy at Last), whom he divorced in 1992. Soon after, he married his Aspen ski instructor, 22-years-younger Virginia Brush Ford, on June 15, 1992. His sister is pastor Mary Christine Perry, the wife of pastor Maurice Keith Hudson and mother of singers Katy Perry and David Hudson. Perry died of prostate cancer on August 29, 1995, eight days after his 65th birthday, at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. His final film, On the Bridge (1992), is an autobiographical documentary about his illness. His ashes were scattered on the mountains of Aspen, Colorado, where he lived the last three years of his life. Author Justin Bozung, who has been researching Perry's life since 2013, is currently writing an official biography titled Character Is Story: The Life & Films of Frank Perry. The book is due to be released in 2021.

This is done through a mechanical process, frequently via a pole inserted through the lid of the churn, or via a crank used to turn a rotating device inside the churn. Etymology The word ‚Äúbutter‚Äù is believed to be derived from the Greek word bou-tyron, the approximate meaning of which is ‚Äúcow cheese‚Äù. However, some believe the word came from the Scythian culture, as the ancient Greeks tended to herd sheep and goats, whose milk is not as good for butter making as that of cows, which the Scythians primarily herded.Douma, Michael. Butter through the Ages. 2008. Institute for Dynamic Educational Development. http://www.webexhibits.org/butter The word \\"churn\\" is from the Old English ƒãyrin, to churn. This is probably derived from the Old English cyrnel, \\"kernel,\\" due to the appearance of butter grains after milk has been churned.\\"churn, n.\\" The Oxford English Dictionary. 2nd ed. 1989. OED Online. Oxford University Press. The butter churn gave its name to the milk churn, early examples of which were based on butter churns. The milk churn is not, however, used for the act of churning, but rather to transport milk. History Evidence for the use of butter dates back as early as 2000 BC,Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, 6th Edition. 2009 pg:1 -1. ‚ÄúButter.‚Äù and there is mention of it in biblical works. The butter churn itself may have existed as early as the 6th century AD, as can be seen by what appears to be a churn lid dating from that era.National Museums of Scotland, ‚ÄúChurn Lid.‚Äù http://nms.scran.ac.uk/database/record.php?usi=000-100-103-159-C In the European tradition, the butter churn was primarily a device used by women, and the churning of butter was an essential responsibility along with other household chores.Jensen, Joan M. What's in a Butter Churn? Objects and Women's Oral History. 1983. https://www.jstor.org/stable/3345974 In earlier traditions of butter making, nomadic cultures placed milk in skin bags and produced butter either by shaking the bag manually, or possibly by attaching the bag to a pack animal, and producing butter simply through the movement of the animal. Some theorists believe this is how the butter creation process was discovered. Some cultures still use a process similar to this, whereby a bag is filled with milk, tied to a stick, and vigorously shaken. Types of butter churns Artsakh Republic. A selection of steel churns in the Cork Butter Museum, Ireland. The most historically prominent types of butter churns are the plunge churn, which is a container, usually made out of wood, where the butter-making action is created by moving in a vertical motion a staff that is inserted into the top. This type of churn is also known as an ‚Äòup and down‚Äô churn, churning tub, plunger churn, plumping churn, knocker churn, plump-kirn, or plowt-kirn (where ‚Äúkirn\\" is a Scots/Northern English word for churn). The staff used in the churn is known as the dash, dasher-staff, churn-staff, churning-stick, plunger, plumper, or kirn-staff.‚ÄúOld and Interesting‚Äù http://www.oldandinteresting.com/history-butter-churns.aspx Another prominent type of churn was the paddle churn, which was a container that contained a paddle, which was operated by a handle. The paddle churned the butter inside the container when the handle was turned. Paddle type hand-cranked butter churn Churn for making butter - vertical rotation The barrel churn was also used extensively. This type of churn was a barrel turned onto its side with a crank attached. The crank either turned a paddle device inside the churn, as in the paddle churn, or turned the whole barrel either horizontally or vertically, depending on its construction. Agitation of the cream in this manner converted the milk to butter. The barrel churn was one of the agricultural innovations of 18th century Europe.Ellis: Butter and Cheese, Soil And Health Library One particularly novel invention of note was the rocking chair butter churn. This device, invented by Alfred Clark, consisted of a barrel attached to a rocking chair. While the rocking chair moved, the barrel moved and churned the milk within into butter.Sabin, L. ‚ÄúWhat a Wild Idea.‚Äù Boys‚Äô Life, Sep 1990. 80.1, p 32.

The offset overhand bend is formed by holding two rope ends next to each other and tying an overhand knot in them as if they were a single line. Due to its common use in several fields, this bend has become known by many names, such as thumb knot, openhand knot, one-sided overhand knot or flat overhand bend (FOB), though the terms \\"one-sided\\" and \\"flat\\" are considered incorrect. Uses Long used by weavers to join the ends of yarn, the offset water knot is very old. It was one of the knots likely identified among the possessions of √ñtzi the Iceman, who dates from 3300 BC. The knot is also tied in a slipped form by mechanical balers to bind straw and hay, but this bend is not practical to use as a binding knot when tied by hand. In climbing and mountaineering In rock climbing, the offset water knot is a favored knot for joining two ropes for a rappel longer than half the length of the ropes. There is controversy over its safety, as it can fail by capsizing under high loads, and some American climbers refer to it as the European death knot, abbreviated to EDK, with some sources recommending against its use. Failure of this knot has been implicated in some accidents and near-misses. Many sources argue that this is a misnomer, and the knot is safe for abseiling and rappelling, since this does not generate such high forces, and the knot, being on one side of the twin lines used in abseil, sees only half of this force. They believe that with proper attention given to dressing and cinching the knot, the risk of capsizing is highly unlikely. Several sources recommend adding a second overhand as close as possible to the first (a stacked overhand or double overhand) for most situations, which maintains most of the benefits of the single overhand, while preventing it from capsizing. Another option is wrapping the strands a second time before passing the tail through (also called a doubled overhand). Easily formed in most lines, the offset overhand bend is jam resistant at nominal loads of one person (approximately 100kg). The jamming threshold is thought to be approximately 3kN (300kg). The instability threshold is thought to be approximately 5kN (500kg) ‚Äì that is, a capsizing event becomes increasingly probable as loads approach 500kg. It is critically important to pay close attention to dressing and cinching of the knot before attempting to abseil. That is, climbers must exercise due diligence when tying this knot ‚Äì by pulling firmly on each of the four rope segments ‚Äì which is necessary to achieve a properly compacted and cinched dressing state. Despite questions about this knot's security, it does present some advantages for use in rappels. Because the knot is offset from the axis of tension, it can translate more easily over rough surfaces and 90 degree edges than other knots; and it is quickly tied and readily untied. Since a stuck rope on a descent also represents a serious hazard to climbers, these advantages, along with ease of tying, have led to its popularity. It is recommended by some sources with the caveats that the tails be of sufficient minimum length (never less than 200mm), the knot be diligently dressed and fully tightened by pulling individually on all four rope segments, and then subjected only to moderate rappelling loads. alt=Furthermore, the knot can be rotated to induce a choking effect to trap and crush the tails. Virtually all testers appear to only examine this knot in its mid-rotation state. It is theorized that this mid-rotation state is in fact the orientation where the structure is most vulnerable to capsizing. In addition, when tying the offset overhand bend using different rope diameters, the thinner diameter rope must be positioned underneath the larger diameter rope. This tactic further inhibits any likelihood of capsizing. The offset figure-eight bend, a similar knot using the figure-eight knot, has been used in the belief that its greater size and complexity brings more security. But testing and more than one fatal failure indicate the figure-eight variant to be less secure, more prone to capsize at lower loads, and in capsizing uses more of the ends than does a capsizing overhand bend. Moreover, while there is one proper dressing of the overhand bend, there are a couple of dressings for the offset figure eight bend.

He was the first driver to be killed in pursuit of the land speed record. Early life and education Parry-Thomas was born in Wrexham, Wales, the son of the curate of Rhosddu. The family moved to nearby Oswestry when he was five years old, and he was educated at Oswestry School. He went on to study engineering at The City and Guilds College in London. Leyland Motors A 1927 Leyland Eight, with sports bodywork Parry-Thomas became chief engineer at Leyland Motors, a company whose main products were commercial vehicles. He filed for and received a number of patents, in the fields of electrical and automotive engineering. After the First World War he and his assistant Reid Railton designed the Leyland Eight luxury motor car, which was intended to compete with Rolls-Royce. His experience of driving this car around Brooklands in 1920 persuaded him to give up his career with Leyland to become a full-time motor- racing driver and engineer. Brooklands In partnership with another engineer, Major Ken Thomson from New Zealand, he started Thomas Inventions Development Co., based inside the Brooklands circuit itself. After his death, this company became Thomson & Taylor and went on to build such cars as Malcolm Campbell's Blue Bird. From 1923 he lived in the \\"flying village\\" there, in a bungalow converted from a First World War hut named The Hermitage. It was an ascetic life, shared only with two Alsatian dogs and his cars, in stark contrast to the hedonism of the Bentley Boys. Parry-Thomas achieved some success on the circuit, winning 38 races in five seasons and setting numerous records. Land speed record Babs at Pendine in 1926 By 1925 Parry-Thomas realised that commercial success required a higher profile than Brooklands could offer, and switched his attention to the land speed record. He acquired the Higham Special from the estate of the deceased Count Zborowski and rebuilt the car with new bodywork for improved aerodynamics. The car was powered by a huge 27-litre Liberty V-12 aero-engine. Without Campbell's money and prestige, or Henry Segrave's factory connections, Parry-Thomas was unable to obtain a brand-new Napier Lion, as the other record contenders were planning. The car was running in 1925 but did not perform as expected. In April 1926 the car, now named Babs, emerged with another new body. He celebrated by driving the lanes around Brooklands that same evening, despite his lack of headlamps. A few days later, despite the poor conditions and soft, wet sand, Parry-Thomas took the record at Pendine Sands, Wales, the same six-mile beach that Campbell had used in 1924 and 1925. The following day, 28 April 1926, he raised it to over , a record that stood for almost a year. Death During the winter of 1926/7 Babs was fitted with yet another new body, partially enclosing the drive and rear wheels by fairings. Parry-Thomas was killed at Pendine Sands on 3 March 1927 while trying to regain his own world land speed record that had been broken just weeks earlier by Malcolm Campbell on the same beach. At the time of the accident it was thought that the right-hand chain had broken and had hit Thomas, causing a fatal head injury as the car was rolling. During the subsequent restoration of the car, it was found that this could not have been the case and that it was more likely that Thomas had been killed as a result of the injuries he sustained while the car rolled and slid along the beach at more than . Parry-Thomas was buried in St Mary's Churchyard in Byfleet, Surrey, close to the Brooklands Circuit. Following the inquest, Babs was buried in the dunes at Pendine Sands. Some 42 years later in 1969 it was controversially recovered, and over the next 15 years was restored by Owen Wyn Owen, at the time a member of Bangor University. For part of every summer, Babs is on display at the Pendine Museum of Speed, Carmarthenshire.

Country K starts in Autarky at point C. At point C, country K can produce (and consume) 3 Y for 5 X. As trade begins with another country, and country K begins to specialize in producing good X.

He was thereafter a Non-Inscrit. Gollnisch has also been the executive vice-president of the FN from 2007 to 2011. He was also a councillor of the Rh√¥ne-Alpes r√©gion of France. Because of his public comments, and his position in the National Front he is a controversial figure in France. Education Gollnisch was born in Neuilly-sur-Seine. He studied law, political science and far-eastern languages with the view to becoming a diplomat. He met Jean-Marie Le Pen while studying at Nanterre university. He also became a reserve officer in the French Navy. In 1971‚Äì1973 he was granted degrees in Japanese and Malaysian-Indonesian by the INALCO. In 1973, he was awarded a degree in political sciences at Institut d'Etudes Politiques de Paris (Sciences Po). He did a masters (DEA) in public law in 1973. In 1974, he began doctoral studies in Law at Kyoto University (Japan). In 1978, he obtained a doctorate in law at Panth√©on-Assas University. Since 1980, he has been an attorney at the bar of Paris. Academic career After his return to France, he began a career as juridical advisor, then lawyer. He is a specialist in the law of Eastern Asian countries. He became associate professor of Law at Metz university. In 1981, he became professor of Japanese language and civilisation at the University of Lyon III ‚Äì a position which he holds to this day. The humanities division of University Lyon 3 is notorious for the profusion of FN supporters and Holocaust deniers among its faculty‚Äîmost notably, Robert Faurisson. Gollnisch has collaborated with the white nationalist American Renaissance magazine. (French) Political career Gollnisch, who is part of the Catholic faction within the National Front, along with Bernard Antony, joined the \\"TSM\\" faction inside the FN (Tout sauf M√©gret, Anybody But M√©gret) during the 1990s crisis, along with Marine Le Pen, Roger Holeindre, Jean-Claude Martinez, Samuel Mar√©chal and Martine Lehideux.Erwan Lecoeur, Dictionnaire de l‚Äôextr√™me-droite, Larousse 2007, pp.263‚Äì264 Gollnisch served as the President of the Alliance of European National Movements (AENM) from 2010 until 2013, when his party left the AENM to join the more moderate European Alliance for Freedom (EAF) and so unify the National Front under the EAF banner.FN : Jean-Marie Le Pen \\"ob√©it\\" √† sa fille et quitte le parti pan-europ√©en Gollnisch was an unsuccessful candidate for the leadership of the National Front in 2011 when the party's founding leader Jean Marie Le Pen retired. Gollnisch was defeated by Marine Le Pen, Jean Marie's daughter. Controversy Gollnisch interviewed by a journalist at 1 May rally in honour of Joan of Arc, Paris. Gollnisch was condemned in January 2007 to a three-month prison sentence on probation and ordered to pay costs of 55,000 Euros (with interest) by the Lyon tribunal correctionnel on a charge of \\"an offence of verbal contestation of the existence of crimes against humanity,Bruno Gollnisch condamn√© pour ses propos sur l'Holocauste , Reuters cable published by L'Express on January 18, 2007 ‚Äì URL accessed on January 18, 2007 d√©lit de contestation de l'existence de crime contre l'humanit√© par paroles \\" which is punished in France by virtue of the 1990 Gayssot Act. Gollnisch had committed the verbal contestation on 11 October 2004, by declaring: :I do not question the existence of concentration camps but historians could discuss the number of deaths. As to the existence of gas chambers, it is up to historians to speak their minds (\\"de se d√©terminer\\").NEGATIONNISME: Lyon III demande la suspension de Bruno Gollnisch, Le Nouvel Observateur, 13 October 2004 In reaction to a report denouncing the complacent attitude of the University Lyon III with respect to the far right, Gollnisch reiterated his declarations shortly after its publication. Gollnisch's declarations, with their implication of holocaust denial, provoked a scandal, especially in the run-up to the ceremonies commemorating the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz extermination camp. The chancellor of the university asked the Minister of National Education to suspend Professor Gollnisch, and announced the opening of a disciplinary procedure against him. On 26 December, the chancellor suspended Professor Gollnisch's classes for 30 days. Furthermore, on 2 December, the chancellor excluded him from the university, alleging a possible breach of the peace; however, this decision was overturned by the Conseil d'√âtat on 14 January 2005. On 2 February, Gollnisch started teaching again at Lyon III. Students were prevented from entering his lecture room by groups of students from left- wing and Jewish associations. A group of National Front students enabled his students to enter and blocked the protesters. A brawl ensued; police officers arrived on the scene and a National Front student was arrested. Other trouble ensued. On 7 November 2006, at the opening of the trial, Gollnisch was asked whether \\"the organised extermination of European Jews by the Nazi regime (...) constitutes an undeniable crime against humanity, and that it was carried out notably by using gas chambers in extermination camps\\". He replied \\"absolutely\\".Bruno Gollnisch a reconnu l'existence des chambres √† gaz √† l'ouverture de son proc√®s, Le Monde, 8 November 2006 Gollnisch was finally found not guilty by the Cour de cassation on 24 June 2009.Gollnisch blanchi par la Cour de cassation, Le Nouvel Observateur, 24 June 2009 On 23 October 2012, Gollnisch visited Hungary to deliver a speech in honour of Jobbik, a party described as \\"anti-Semitic\\" by the New York Times and as \\"extremist\\" by Marine Le Pen.\\"Viktor Orban Wins a Second Term in Hungary\\", \\"The New York Times\\", 7 April 2014.

In the United States, it competed with, and ultimately lost to, the Zenith/GE system, which the FCC chose as the standard in 1961. While both systems used multiplexing to transmit the L-R stereo signal, the Crosby system used a frequency-modulated 50 kHz subcarrier, whereas the competing Zenith/GE system used an amplitude-modulated 38 kHz subcarrier. As FM is less susceptible to interference and noise than AM, the Crosby system had better frequency response and less noise of the two systems especially under weak signal conditions. However, the Crosby system was incompatible with existing subsidiary communications authorization (SCA) services which used subcarrier frequencies including 41 and 67 kHz. These SCA services were used by many FM stations since the mid-1950s for subscription-based \\"storecasting\\" to raise revenue and for other non-broadcast purposes. They consequently lobbied the FCC to adopt the Zenith/GE system. FCC tests in 1960 confirmed that the Zenith/GE stereo system was compatible with 67 kHz SCA operation, although not 41 kHz. According to Jack Hannold: On April 19, 1961, the FCC released its Final Order selecting the Zenith/GE system as the FM stereophonic broadcasting standard. At 9:59 AM that day, Crosby-Teletronics stock was worth $15 a share; by 2:00 P.M. it was down to less than $2.50. Another (albeit relatively minor) factor in the FCC choosing the Zenith/GE system was the widespread use of vacuum tubes in radios at the time; the additional tubes for an all-FM system would have increased the size, weight, cost of and heat generated by each tuner or receiver.

The Nouvelle Droite is at the origin of the wider European New Right (ENR). The Nouvelle Droite began with the formation of Groupement de recherche et d'√©tudes pour la civilisation europ√©enne (GRECE; Research and Study Group for European Civilization), a French group guided largely by the philosopher Alain de Benoist, in Nice in 1968. De Benoist and other early GRECE members had long been involved in far-right politics, and their new movement was influenced by older rightist currents of thought like the German conservative revolutionary movement. Although rejecting left-wing ideas of human equality, the Nouvelle Droite was also heavily influenced by the tactics of the New Left and some forms of Marxism. Particularly influential were the sociocultural ideas of the Italian Marxist Antonio Gramsci, with ND members describing themselves as the \\"Gramscians of the Right\\". The ND achieved a level of mainstream respectability in France during the 1970s, although their reputation and influence declined following sustained liberal and leftist anti-fascist opposition. Members of the Nouvelle Droite joined several political parties, becoming a particularly strong influence within the far-right French National Front, while ND ideas also influenced far-right groups elsewhere in Europe. In the 21st century, the ND has influenced multiple far-right groups, such as the Identitarian movement and forms of national-anarchism. The ND opposes multiculturalism and the mixing of different cultures within a single society, opposes liberal democracy and capitalism, and promotes localised forms of what it terms \\"organic democracy\\", with the intent of rooting out elements of oligarchy. It pushes for an \\"archeofuturistic\\" or a type of non-reactionary \\"revolutionary conservative\\" method to the reinvigoration of the Pan-European identity and culture, while encouraging the preservation of certain regions where Europeans and their Caucasian descendants may reside. Concurrently, it attempts to sustain the protection of the variance of ethnicities and identities around the globe, defending the right of each group of peoples to keep their own lands and regions to occupy. To achieve its goals, the ND promotes what it calls \\"metapolitics\\", seeking to influence and shift European culture in ways sympathetic to its cause over a lengthy period of time rather than by actively campaigning for office through political parties. History Following the end of the Second World War and the collapse of the Vichy regime, the French extreme-right was driven underground. It resurfaced as a force able to contest elections in the mid-1950s, when some far-right activists successfully returned to the public arena through the Poujadist movement. In the following two decades, the country's extreme-right movement then rallied around the cause of the French Empire, opposing the decolonisation movements that were gaining strength in Indochina and Algeria. A number of far-right paramilitary groups were formed in this environment, including the Secret Army Organisation (Organisation arm√©e secr√®te - OAS) and the Revolutionary Army (Arm√©e R√©volutionnaire - AR). Adopting another approach, a number of extreme-right intellectuals decided that they would try to make many of their ideas more socially respectable through the creation of the Research and Study Group for European Civilisation (GRECE). The acronym means \\"Greece\\" in French, and the organized has emphasized the pagan values of Ancient Greece. Establishing GRECE: 1968‚Äì1974 GRECE was founded in the southern French city of Nice in January 1968, shortly before the May 1968 events in France. It initially had forty members, among the most prominent of whom were Alain de Benoist, Pierre Vial, Jean-Claude Valla, Dominique Venner, Jacques Bruyas and Jean-Jacques Mourreau. The political scientist Tamir Bar-On has stated that \\"the intellectual evolution of both GRECE and leading ND intellectuals is definitely situated within the revolutionary Right milieu\\". GRECE has been described as a \\"logical alternative\\" for those \\"young French nationalist militants\\" to join, given the 1958 dissolution of the Jeune Nation group, the 1962 collapse of the OAS, and the defeat of the European Rally for Liberty in the 1967 legislative election. These young radicals were ultra- nationalists and anti-communists, and centred their beliefs around a defence of Western society, scientific racism, and eugenics. They were opposed to the migration of non-white peoples from former French colonies into France itself, and this led them to adopt anti-colonial and anti-imperialist perspectives. De Benoist, the \\"undisputed leader\\" of the ND, in 2011 De Benoist came to be regarded as the \\"undisputed leader\\" of the Nouvelle Droite, and its \\"most authoritative spokesman\\". He had previously been a member of the ultra- nationalist F√©d√©ration des √âtudiants Nationalistes and involved with the racialist Europe-Action journal, both of which have been characterised as reflecting ND ideas in their \\"embryonic form\\". GRECE inherited a number of key themes from Europe-Action, among them \\"the anti-Christian stance, a marked elitism, the racial notion of a united Europe, the seeds of a change from biological to cultural definitions of \\"difference,\\" and the sophisticated inversion of terms like racism and anti-racism\\". De Benoit was also influenced by the Conservative Revolutionary movement of interwar Germany‚Äîincluding thinkers like Ernst J√ºnger, Arthur Moeller van den Bruck, and Oswald Spengler‚Äîand in the 1970s the ND helped to promote a revived interest in these conservative revolutionaries. GRECE circulated an internal document in which it urged members not to employ \\"outdated language\\" that might associate the group with older fascist sectors of the far right. It also urged its members to socialise with some of France and Europe's most important decision-makers, so as to better set the ground for its goals. GRECE did not remain a homogenous intellectual movement but contained different and sometimes conflicting perspectives. The ND learned from the unrest of 1968 as well as from the wider New Left movement of that decade, adopting the idea that the promotion of cultural ideas are a precondition for political change. De Benoist noted that the French left had not been elected into office since the end of the Second World War but that nevertheless leftist ideas had gained considerable traction in French society, particularly among intellectuals. He sought to change the values and assumptions of French society in a similar way, by shifting the prevailing ideology without the need for any electoral victories. GRECE held a number of seminars and colloquia with varying degrees of success. It also began to issue a number of semi-academic publications through which it could promote its views. Its journal, Nouvelle Ecole, initially circulated among the group's members although went into public circulation from 1969 onwards. A review, El√©ments, was then made public in 1973. Over the course of 1975 and 1976 it issued bulletins promoting its message among medical, educational, and military circles. In 1976, GRECE launched its own publishing house, known as Copernic. Growth and opposition: 1975‚Äì79 The expression nouvelle droite was not originally a term of self-appellation. It first appeared in a series of articles on GRECE written by the journalist Gilbert Comte and published in Le Monde in March 1978 which were titled \\"Une nouvelle droite?\\". It was applied at a time when the appellation \\"nouvelle\\" was being given to a wide range of developments in French intellectual and cultural life, including the nouveaux philosophes, the nouveaux historiens, and nouveaux √©conomistes, as well as nouvelle cuisine. By the late 1970s, the ND had captured the political zeitgeist in France, reaching its mass media heyday. During these years, intellectuals affiliated with the movement published articles in the mainstream magazine Le Figaro, edited by Louis Pauwels. In 1978, De Benoist's Vu de droite won the prestigious Prix de l'essai from the Acad√©mie Fran√ßaise. The ND's growth raised concerns among many liberal and leftist intellectuals in France, who claimed that it was a racist, fascist, and Vichyite movement that sought to undermine liberal democracy, egalitarianism, and the legacy of the French Revolution of 1789. A campaign calling for the rejection of the ND was embraced by media outlets like Le Monde, Le Nouvel Observateur, L'Express, and La Croix, resulting in Le Figaro withdrawing its patronage of the movement. The ND claimed that it was facing a form of intellectual persecution akin to McCarthyism. Now deprived of a popular platform, the ND accelerated away from biological racism and toward the claim that different ethno-cultural groups should be kept separate in order to preserve their historical and cultural differences. In 1974, a group called The Club was established by several GRECE members‚Äînotably Jean-Yves Le Gallou and Yvan Blot, along with Henry de Lesquen,‚Äîto serve as an elite think tank for ND ideas. The Club was frustrated with GRECE's long-term metapolitical strategy and sought to hasten the speed of change, with its members joining political parties like the Rally for the Republic (RFR) and Union for French Democracy (UDF). By the late 1970s, the Club de l'Horloge had moved away from GRECE by both endorsing economic neoliberalism and embracing Roman Catholicism as a core aspect of France's national identity, something in contrast to GRECE's anti-Christian bent. Political influence: 1980-present In the early 1980s, a number of ND- affiliated intellectuals‚Äîamong them Jean Haudry, Jean Varenne, Pierre Vial, Jean-Claude Bardet, and Pierre de Meuse‚Äîcame out in support of the extreme- right National Front (FN) party, which was then growing in support under the leadership of Jean-Marie Le Pen. The FN were influenced by the ND in their platforms and slogans, adopting the ND's emphasis on ethno-cultural differentialism. The Club called for the RFR and UDF to enter into a political alliance with the FN to defeat the Socialist Party government of President Fran√ßois Mitterrand, although this did not happen. In 1994, there were four ND-affiliated individuals on the FN politburo, making it the second most influential faction within the party. Within the FN, there were tensions between the ND-affiliated factions and other groups, most particularly the Catholic faction which rejected the ND's exultation of paganism. There were also tensions between the FN nouvelle droitistes and the wider ND, in particular with the wing influenced by De Benoist.179x179pxDe Benoist openly criticised Le Pen's party, condemning its populism as being at odds with GRECE's emphasis on elitism, and expressing opposition to the FN's use of immigrants as scapegoats for France's problems. He may have been seeking to distinguish his GRECE with the FN, being aware that the two had much overlap. In 1993, a group of 40 French intellectuals signed \\"The Appeal to Vigilance\\", which was published in Le Monde. This warned of \\"the resurgence of anti- democratic currents of far Right thought in French and European intellectual life\\" and called for a boycott against ND-affiliated intellectuals. In 1994, the appeal was again published, this time having been signed by 1500 European intellectuals. Some of the prominent names that have collaborated with GRECE include Arthur Koestler, Hans Eysenck, Konrad Lorenz, Mircea Eliade, Raymond Abellio, Thierry Maulnier, Anthony Burgess and Jean Parvulesco. Although the extent of the relationship is debated by scholars, the Nouvelle Droite, and its German counterpart the Neue Rechte,Hentges, Gudrun, G√ºrcan K√∂kgiran, and Kristina Nottbohm. \\"Die Identit√§re Bewegung Deutschland (IBD)‚ÄìBewegung oder virtuelles Ph√§nomen.\\" Forschungsjournal Soziale Bewegungen 27, no. 3 (2014): 1-26. Read online (pdf) have influenced the ideological and political structure of the European Identitarian Movement. Part of the alt-right also claims to have been inspired by De Benoist's writings. Ideology The ND has gone through several doctrinal renewals since its creation in 1968 and, according to political scientist St√©phane Fran√ßois, \\"it has never been a centralized and homogeneous school of dogmatic thought. The positions supported by New Right thinkers vary enormously, ranging from extreme right wing to variants of anarchism. Despite these, ... GRECE and ex-GRECE thinkers are united by common doctrinal references.\\" Philosopher Pierre-Andr√© Taguieff has distinguished five ideological periods within the history of the ND: the rejection of the Judeo-Christian heritage and the ethnocentric \\"religion of human rights\\"; a critique of the liberal and socialist \\"egalitarian utopias\\" in the 1970s; a praise of the \\"Indo-European heritage\\" and paganism, perceived as the \\"true religion\\" of the Europeans; a critique of a market-driven and \\"economist\\" vision of the world and liberal utilitarianism; the advocacy of a radical ethnic differentialism, eventually evolving in the 1990s towards a cultural relativism inspired by Claude L√©vi-Strauss and Robert Jaulin. Relation with fascism The majority of political scientists locate the ND on the extreme-right or far-right of the political spectrum. A number of liberal and leftist critics have described it as a new or sanitized form of neo-fascism or as an ideology of the extreme right that significantly draws from fascism. The political scientist and specialist of fascism Roger Griffin agrees, arguing that the ND exhibits what he regards as the two defining aspects of fascism: a populist ultra-nationalism and a call for national rebirth (palingenesis). McCulloch believes that the ND had a \\"distinctly fascist‚Äìrevivalist character\\" in part because of its constant reference to earlier right-wing ideologues like the German Conservative Revolutionaries and French figures the likes of Robert Brasillach, Georges Valois, Pierre Drieu La Rochelle, and Thierry Maulnier. The Nouvelle Droite has also revered the Italian far right thinker Julius Evola, who remains a potent symbol in the movement. In 1981, the editorial team of the ND journal √âl√©ments wrote that \\"[w]ithout sharing all his views and all his analysis, the writers of √âl√©ments agree to recognize in [him] one of the most lucid and insightful observers of our times.\\" McCulloch saw parallels in the ND's desire for ethnically and culturally homogeneous European societies, its hostility to egalitarianism and universalist modernity, and its call for a cultural rebirth. The ND rejects the labels of \\"fascism\\" and \\"extreme right\\". De Benoist has himself been described as a neo-fascist, although he has rejected the label of \\"fascist\\", claiming that it has only been used by his critics \\"for the sole purpose of delegitimizing or discrediting\\" his ideas. The ND's members have argued that their critique of capitalism and liberal democracy are different from the criticisms articulated by Nazism and older forms of fascism and the far right.  Left-right wing spectrum  The Nouvelle Droite has distinguished itself from the mainstream right by embracing anti-capitalist, anti-American, pro- Third World, anti-nationalist, federalist, and environmentalist positions which were traditionally associated with left-wing politics. This blend of traditionally leftist and rightist ideas, which has long been recognised as a characteristic of fascism, has generated much ambiguity surrounding the ND's ideological position, and has led to confusion among political activists and even academics. The ND describes itself as situated beyond both left and right. The ND takes influence from Marxist thinkers like Antonio Gramsci The political scientist Alberto Spektorowski espoused the view that the ND \\"has indeed seriously moved from its positions of old-style right-wing nationalism and racism to a new type of leftist regionalism and ethno-pluralism\\". Cultural critics have largely characterised the ND as a right-wing phenomenon, a categorisation endorsed by the political scientist Tamir Bar-On, who expresses the view that \\"ND thinkers have never fully transcended their original revolutionary right-wing roots.\\" Bar-On interpreted the ND's use of leftist ideas as part of its \\"survival strategy\\", also noting that it was \\"a subtle attempt to resurrect some of the ideals of the revolutionary Right\\". McCulloch believed that the ND was \\"a deliberate attempt to paint certain ideological concepts in less compromised colours\\", while Griffin stated that the ND's claims to transcend the Left and Right was \\"an impressive piece of sleight of hand by the ND which disguises its extreme right-wing identity\\". The Nouvelle Droite was deeply indebted to ideas drawn from the New Left movement. ND thinkers borrowed heavily from the Italian Marxist Antonio Gramsci, and its proponents have described themselves as \\"Gramscians of the Right\\". Among the other Marxist thinkers whose work has been utilised by the ND have been Frankfurt School intellectuals Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer and Neo- Marxists like Louis Althusser and Herbert Marcuse. Other leftists have also been cited as influences by various ND figures, with former GRECE secretary- general Pierre Vial for instance praising Che Guevara, the Italian Red Brigades and the German Red Army Faction for their willingness to die fighting against capitalist liberal democracy. During the 1984 election to the European Parliament, De Benoist announced his intention to vote for the French Communist Party, deeming them to be the only credible anti-capitalist, anti- liberal, and anti-American political force then active in France. In 1997, he referred to The Greens as the only French political party that challenged the materialist and industrialist values of Western society. De Benoist states that the Nouvelle Droite \\"has a certain number of characteristics of the Left and a certain number of characteristics of the Right.\\" He has also expressed the view that the left-right political divide has \\"lost any operative value to analyze the field of ideological or political discourse\\", for \\"the new divides that have been emerging for the last few decades no longer coincide with the old left-right distinction\\". Metapolitics and strategy GRECE has promoted the project of slowly infusing society with its ideas and rhetoric in the hope of achieving cultural dominance, which would then allow for the assumption of political power. Vial stated that \\"Politics is not the affair of GRECE. It is to be placed on another, more fundamental level. GRECE intends to work on the meta-political level ... where a collective mentality and therefore a popular consensus is elaborated\\". De Benoist has called for the overthrow of liberal democracy through a long-term metapolitical strategy. Although it rejects liberal democracy, the Nouvelle Droite is not inherently anti-democratic, calling instead for a localised form of what it calls \\"organic democracy\\". De Benoist has maintained that the Nouvelle Droite has never endorsed a particular political party, and that its purpose has been as having \\"always adopted a position of observer, never of actor. It produces analyses and thought; it offers a theoretical corpus; it accomplishes intellectual and cultural work. Nothing else.\\" The Nouvelle Droite critiques both modernity and post-modernity. It opposes global capitalism and liberalism, and valorises regionalism, federalism, socialism and local forms of democracy. It rejects the principle of human equality, arguing that humans are not born free and equal and that society is inherently hierarchical. It stressed the need for elites, claiming that this would allow for harmonious social hierarchy in which all people are aware of their particular responsibilities and tasks. Ethno-pluralism The ND has criticised the liberal emphasis on the rights of individuals and instead foregrounded the rights of groups. The ND exhibits a hostility to multiculturalism and to cultural mixing. Multicultural societies are viewed by the ND as a form of \\"ethnocide\\". GRECE has stated that it is against immigration but that it would not expect settled ethno-cultural minorities in France to emigrate en masse. Instead it favours separation of the different ethno-cultural groups within France, with each emphasising its own cultural identity and not integrating and mixing with the others. It supports homogeneity within a society. GRECE called on Europe and the Third World to work together on establishing this global ethno-cultural segregation and combating any homogenizing identities. Critics have argued that the ND's attitude in this regard is akin to older fascist preoccupations with the ideas of cultural or racial purity. It shares this belief in diversity in isolation with the FN. Spektorowski suggests that the ND's views on cultural difference and segregation seek to relegate the Third World to an inferior position on the world stage, by advising agrarian societies to remain as they are and not industrialise while allowing Europe to retain its more technologically advanced position. The ND advocates for the establishment of a federal Europe based on ethnically homogenous regional communities The ND does not espouse the view that Europe's technological superiority marks Europeans out as a superior race. De Benoit has stated that \\"the European race is not the absolute superior race. It is only the most apt to progress\\". De Benoit long adhered to ethnic nationalist ideas although sought to develop a form of nationalism that deconstructed the nation-state. GRECE promoted the replacement of the French Republic with a \\"a federal republic of French peoples\\" which would in turn form part of a wider ethnic federation of European peoples. According to the ND, the ethnic-region would not have need to establish draconian laws against immigrants who were ethnically different, but would have impenetrable cultural barriers to keep them out. Ideas about such a regionalised federal Europe are akin to those of earlier far right and fascist thinkers like Drieu La Rochelle, Dominique Venner and Jean Mabire. In his analysis of the ND's beliefs about their ideal future, Spektorowski states that any society established along the ND lines would resemble apartheid-era South Africa, would be a form of totalitarianism based on the politics of identity, and would be \\"a permanent nightmare for old immigrants and for political and ideological dissenters\\". Opposing global capitalism and an unrestricted free market, GRECE promoted a communitarian form of capitalism. While celebrating and defending Western civilisation, GRECE condemned Westernisation. The ND was equally critical of both the Soviet Union and the United States. The ND exhibits an intense Anti-Americanism, rejecting what it perceives as the hyper-capitalist ethos of the United States. It claims that both Europe and the Third World are allies in a struggle against American cultural imperialism. Within the ND, there is no overt anti-Semitism. McCulloch argued that anti-Semitic conspiracy theories were nevertheless present in the ND-affiliated members of the FN. In the early 1990s, Georges Charbonneau announced that GRECE officially repudiated Holocaust denial. However, one of the organisation's founders, Jean-Claude Valla, has stated that he personally believes the claims of Holocaust deniers.  Paganism  The ND rejects the monotheistic legacy of the Judeo-Christian tradition. They claim that the Christian heritage of Europe has generated an egalitarian ethos which has since developed into such secular variants as liberalism, social democracy, and socialism. It condemns the monotheism of Christianity as exhibiting a totalitarian ethos which seeks to impose a Western ethos on the world's many different cultures. According to Vial, \\"totalitarianism was born 4000 years ago ... It was born the day monotheism appeared. The idea of monotheism implies the submission of the human being to the will of a single, eternal God\\". GRECE was avowedly pro-pagan, viewing pre- Christian Europe in positive terms as a healthy and diverse, polytheistic continent. The ND's opposition to Christianity has resulted in it rejecting the ideas of the Old Catholic Right and the neo-liberal Anglo‚ÄìAmerican Right. It nevertheless accepts that other cultural groups should be free to pursue monotheistic beliefs if they see fit, expressing the view that \\"Judaism is certainly right for the Jews, as Islam is for the Arabs, and we cannot accept the racist practice of imposing our cultural model on foreign peoples.\\"  Currents  Under the GRECE umbrella have been found a variety of thinkers and activists, including \\"European imperialists, traditionalists influenced by Julius Evola and Ren√© Gu√©non, communitarians, post-modernists, V√∂lkisch nostalgics, anti-Judeo-Christrian pagans\\". Taguieff has distinguished four different currents within the Nouvelle Droite: the traditionalists ‚Äì influenced by integral traditionalism, the \\"revolutionary Traditionalism\\" of Evola, and often by anti-Catholicism ‚Äì, the \\"modern\\", then \\"post-modern\\" neo- conservatives ‚Äì inspired by the German Conservative Revolution ‚Äì, the ethnic communitarianists ‚Äì influenced by the \\"populist-racist\\" V√∂lkisch movement ‚Äì, and the positivist ‚Äì who exalt science and modern technique in a form of scientism. Amidst this diversity, the ideological core of the ND remains \\"the defence of identity (of whatever kind) and a refusal of egalitarianism\\". Beyond France By the end of the 1980s, publications espousing Nouvelle Droite ideas had appeared in various European countries, namely Belgium, Spain, Italy, and Germany. Works by Alain de Benoist and Guillaume Faye have been translated into various European languages, in English in particular by Arktos Media, described as the \\"uncontested global leader in the publication of English-language Nouvelle Droite literature.\\" Although mostly known in France, according to Minkenberg, the Nouvelle Droite borders to other European \\"New Right\\" movements, such as Neue Rechte in Germany, New Right in the United Kingdom, Nieuw Rechts in the Netherlands and Flanders, Forza Nuova in Italy, Imperium Europa in Malta, Nova Hrvatska Desnica in Croatia, Noua Dreapta in Romania and the New Right of Paul Weyrich and the Free Congress Foundation in the United States.  United States  After 2006, Faye has taken part in conventions organized by American white supremacist Jared Taylor, who have favourably reviewed his book in his magazine American Renaissance. Both of them believe that white people need to join in a worldwide fight for their racial, cultural, and demographic survival. His ideas have also been discussed by the American Alt Right website Counter-Currents, and the writings of Faye and de Benoist, especially their metapolitical stance, have influenced American far-right activist Richard B. Spencer. The American New Right cannot, however, be ideologically confused with its European counterpart. The European New Right is similar to the Cultural Conservatism movement led by Paul Weyrich and the Free Congress Foundation, and to the related traditionalism of paleoconservatives such as Pat Buchanan and the Chronicles magazine of the Rockford Institute (Diamond, Himmelstein, Berlet and Lyons). However these subgroups of the New Right coalition in the United States are closely tied to Christianity, which the Nouvelle Droite rejects, describing itself as a pagan movement.Lee Both Jonathan Marcus, Martin Lee and Alain de Benoist himself have highlighted these important differences with the US New Right coalition.Marcus: \\"the label 'New Right' is potentially misleading. For the French nouvelle droite has little in common with the political New Right that emerged in the English-speaking world at around the same time.\\" (Marcus, p.23) *Alain de Benoist: \\"Based on everything I know about it, the so-called New Right in America is completely different from ours. I don't see even a single point with which I could agree with this so-called New Right. Unfortunately, the name we now have gives rise to many misunderstandings.\\" (quoted in Ian B. Warren. \\"Charting Europe's Future in the 'Post Postwar' Era: The 'European New Right': Defining and Defending Europe's Heritage. An Interview with Alain de Benoist\\" in The Journal of Historical Review 14 (2): 28. As Martin Lee explains, United Kingdom Nouvelle Droite ideas have influenced the National Anarchist movement (logo pictured), established in Britain by Troy Southgate The Nouvelle Droite also developed a presence in the United Kingdom, where the term \\"New Right\\" was more closely associated with the Thatcherite policies introduced under the Conservative Party administration of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Britain's far right first collaborated with the Nouvelle Droite in 1979, when a GRECE delegation met with the League of St. George in London. It was claimed that the meeting went well, although there was no further collaboration between the groups. The Nouvelle Droite's ideas were pursued in a more sustained way in Britain when far right activist Michael Walker launched the National Democrat magazine in 1981, renaming it The Scorpion in 1983. Walker had been a senior member of Britain's fascist National Front, and believed that the latter party had failed to achieve its goals because it had neither engaged with culture nor won over intellectuals to its cause. He felt that the Nouvelle Droite thinkers could aid the British far right by challenging two of its \\"sacred cows\\": biological racism and conspiracy theories. In his publication, Walker produced translations of some of De Benoit and Faye's writings. During the 1980s and into the early 1990s, Walker co-organised several conferences with a group called Islands of the North Atlantic (IONA), which was led by Richard Lawson; these conferences were attended by Nouvelle Droite figures like De Benoist.Generation Identity UK also known as the Identitiarian Movement UK bases its ideology on the Nouvelle Droite.alt= After Walker left Britain for Cologne, his role as promoter of the Nouvelle Droite in Britain was taken on by Lawson, who launched the meta- political magazine Perspectives in the early 1990s; this was re-launched as Radical Shift in 1997, but remained uninfluential. In the mid-1990s, some hard right Conservatives co-operated with members of the fascist British National Party (BNP) to establish the Bloomsbury Forum, a self-described \\"New Right\\" group based in Bloomsbury which modelled itself on GRECE. After Nick Griffin took over the BNP in 1999, he reformed it in a manner closely based on the French National Front and thus influenced by the Nouvelle Droite. In certain ways Griffin's BNP remained distinct from the Nouvelle Droite, however, for instance by not embracing the latter's wholesale rejection of Christianity. The terminology of the Nouvelle Droite, in particular that surrounding \\"ethno- pluralism\\", has also been adopted by the British National Anarchist Troy Southgate. The Identitarian Movement UK launched in 2017 espouses the ideas of the Nouvelle Droite citing Guillaume Faye and Alain de Benoist as inspirations. Reception The Nouvelle Droite has gained a wide range of enemies as well as some unexpected supporters. Although many liberals and socialists have claimed that the ND has not ideologically shifted away from earlier forms of the far right, and that it should be socially ostracised, the leftist journal Telos has praised the ND's ability to transcend the left-right paradigm. The ND has been equally criticized by sectors of both the left and the right, for instance having been condemned by both the Anglo-American right for its anti-capitalist and anti-Western views, and by the French Catholic right for its irreligious and anti-Christian views. The Nouvelle Droite has been the subject of various studies since its emergence in the 1970s. De Benoist has responded negatively to Bar-On's work, claiming that Bar-On \\"unceasingly attributes to the ND positions that do not belong to it, and are even sometimes diametrically opposed.\\" See also * History of far-right movements in France * Politics of France * Identitarianism, a similar movement originating in France * Alt-right, a far right movement influenced by the ideas of the Nouvelle Droite References=FootnotesBibliography       Further reading   (adapted from )  * Category:Far-right politics in Europe Category:Political movements in Europe Category:Alt-right Category:Neo-fascism Category:Far-right politics in France Category:Right-wing politics in Europe Category:White nationalism in Europe Category:French words and phrases Category:Neopaganism in Europe Category:Pan-European nationalism eo:Novdekstrismo gl:Nouvelle Droite it:Nuova Destra pl:Nowa Prawica (Nouvelle Droite) sv:Nya h√∂gern (kulturr√∂relse) ","title":"Nouvelle Droite"},{"id":"1490243","text":"The Industrial Bank of Japan, Limited (IBJ), based in Tokyo, Japan, was one of the largest banks in the world during the latter half of the 20th century. It combined with Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank and Fuji Bank in 2002 to form Mizuho Financial Group. History Former IBJ head office building in Tokyo, currently undergoing demolition IBJ was founded as a public-sector bank under the Industrial Bank of Japan Act of 1902. At that time, Japan was in the throes of its industrial revolution, and there was a strong demand for long- term investment capital. IBJ raised funds by issuing bank debentures. IBJ also acted as the trustee in corporate debenture issues - notably, the major Japanese railway company issue of 1906 in London, amount to the then-enormous sum of 1 million pounds sterling. These activities contributed to the building of the Japanese domestic securities market, and to the generating of a higher profile for Japanese borrowers in the international market. This early experience of a sophisticated mix of corporate and investment banking with exposure to trust work is unique to IBJ amongst Japanese banks. In the original Act, there was the wording, ‚ÄúTrust business related to local government bond, corporate bonds, and equities‚Äù. This was the first time for the term ‚Äútrust‚Äù, or , to appear in the Japanese statute book. The 1918 amendment to the IBJ Act permitted the underwriting and offering of equities. At that point, IBJ had the full capabilities for what is now termed investment banking. However, that was at what proved to be the peak of the demand created for Japanese products by the First World War and the consequent economic boom. Thereafter, the next 30 years of Japanese history encompassed many adversities for society in general and for financial institutions in particular: the Great Kant≈ç earthquake, the Showa Financial Panic, and finally, the Second World War and the postwar recovery. IBJ became a private-sector bank in 1950 and took on legal form under the Long-Term Bank Act of 1952. However the Act was framed within the terms of the US-led Occupation policy of compartmentalizing financial services. IBJ was forced to retreat from much of its former investment banking activities and return principally to long-term lending funding by issuing bank debentures. During the high-growth period of the Japanese economy in the 1960s, IBJ was particularly active in financing steel production, shipping, shipbuilding, and automobile manufacturing. Following the first oil crisis, Japan moved to a pattern of lower growth as a mature economy, and IBJ expanded its customer base at home, and started the process of expansion overseas. In Japan, the wholesaling of bank debentures to major financial institutions and the regional banks led to a network of strong relationships. This was all supported by the fact that, originally a public- sector bank, IBJ had no keiretsu affiliations: IBJ has always been independent of the large corporate groupings characteristic of Japan and was hence number 2 banker to each and all of the major keiretsu groupings. Internationally, IBJ was free to pursue its investment banking ambitions.

Thirty two people drowned in the mouth of the River Dee, Aberdeenshire, Scotland when their ferry boat capsized. Overcrowding, fast flowing current and a poorly spliced wire rope were blamed. River Dee, looking towards Victoria Bridge. This is close to the location that the ferry capsized. Context The city of Aberdeen lies at the mouth of the River Dee in North East Scotland. This is a tidal part of the river and can be subject to powerful currents. In 1876 the Royal Burgh of Torry was distinct from Aberdeen and was found on the south bank of the river. Aberdeen lay on the north bank. In 1891 Torry was incorporated into the city of Aberdeen. The ferry route was a busy and profitable route between the Pocra Quay on the North and Torry on the south. It had operated for centuries. At the time of the accident the big ferry boat was operated by a pulley system, attached by a rope to each river bank. This allowed it to be pulled across the river without the need for an engine, sails or rudder on the boat. Other boats continued to transport passengers across the route, particularly on busy days. The wire-boat was crossing the new channel of the River Dee where the current could be faster. The wire ferry boat was built by William Hall, ship and boatbuilder with dimensions of 25 feet length, 8 feet 10 1/2 inches width and 2 feet 4 inches in depth. It was fitted with a large wheel and two friction rollers for the wire that was strung across the river and would carry eight tons. When tested with sixty men on board she was stable in the water, but there was no room for anyone to sit and was therefore toploaded. Oars and rowlocks were available on board. The ferry was licensed by the city council to carry thirty two people, however this was an old agreement and had not been updated for the new, larger wire- boat. The disaster Wednesday 5 April was a Sacramental Fast in the city and the weather was also fine. This encouraged many people to visit the fair in Torry and the Bay of Nigg, therefore crossing the River Dee by ferry or by bridge further up river. After several days of rain, the river was swollen and fast flowing. Snow melt may also have contributed. The previous day the wire- boat was not run for a time due to the fast current, and journeys were made by row boats instead. The boat had already crossed the river a number of times on the 5th of April. On its final journey many people pushed to get on board at the north bank. Policemen had been drafted in by Alexander Kennedy, the tacksman and leaseholder of the ferry route because the day was expected to be busy. They were to help with the crowds, but their role did not include preventing overcrowding on the boat itself. This was agreed to be responsibility of the tacksman. There was no \\"tumult or breach of the peace\\" among the crowds. There were normally two ferryman on the boat for each journey. On the fateful crossing, William Masson, the more experienced of the two, was concerned about the overcrowding and the speed of the current. He testified that he thought the wire-boat would be laid up for about an hour to allow the current to slow when the tide slackened. He also reported that he raised concerns with Kennedy about overcrowding, but Kennedy claimed not to have heard. Masson went to get his colleague a drink of water, and on his return the boat was already crossing the river. It was the only crossing that day that he did not go on the boat. Seventy six people were on the ferry when it entered the river. It began to list as it moved mid-stream and into the faster current. Witnesses reported twice being asked to move around to counter the imbalance. The wire became slack from the Torry side. When this was pulled up the boat jerked and the wire snapped at a poorly made splice. This movement caused the capsize of the ferry. Some of the passengers were able to swim to safety. One woman and others were rescued by the woman's husband in his small yawl. He had launched because he was concerned about the state of the ferry and felt catastrophe was likely. Other small craft came to the aid of those in the water, but the larger ferry boats were too high on the beach to be launched quickly. Thirty two people died in the tragedy. Most were from Aberdeen, and ranged in age from nine to fifty years old. Forty four people were rescued. A full list of missing and rescued people was published in the Aberdeen Journal on 12 April. Inquiry A public inquiry was held in Aberdeen by the Board of Trade. This was the first such inquiry held in Scotland and was chaired by Captain Harris of the Royal Navy. It was well attended by members of the public. Witnesses reported that the river was flowing very fast, and that the wire-boat was more at risk than those being rowed across the water. The matter of overcrowding was also felt to be significant, but the poorly spliced wire was perhaps ultimately to blame. Aftermath A fund was set up to support those affected. Funds were donated from subscriptions and from fundraising. Queen Victoria Bridge There had been plans for some time for a new bridge across to Torry but the final impetus was provided by the disaster and Queen Victoria Bridge was formally opened on 2 July 1881. The bridge was partly funded by public subscription and partly by the Corporation of Aberdeen Council, and provides direct access from Torry into the heart of Aberdeen. A plaque commemorating those who lost their lives in this disaster was erected on the bridge in 2005.

His nickname was Binnu u tratturi (Sicilian for \\"Bernardo the tractor\\") because, in the words of one informant, \\"he mows people down.\\"Profile: Bernardo Provenzano , BBC News, 11 April 2006. Another nickname was il ragioniere (\\"the accountant\\") due to his apparently subtle and low-key approach to running his crime empire, at least in contrast to some of his more violent predecessors.Sicily's Invisible Man , Time Europe Magazine, 29 August 2004. Provenzano was part of the Corleonesi Mafia clan who backed mob boss Luciano Leggio in the ambush and murder of Michele Navarra in the late 1950s. In 1963, Provenzano became a fugitive after a failed hit. Provenzano also participated in the Viale Lazio massacre in the late 1960s. Salvatore Riina succeeded Leggio in the mid 1970s, and Provenzano became the second in command of the Corleonesi. Provenzano took the reins after Riina was captured in 1993, and Leoluca Bagarella in 1995, both having been sentenced in absentia at the Maxi Trial in the mid-1980s to life imprisonment for ordering multiple murders, including the two high-profile bombings (the Capaci massacre and Via D'Amelio massacre) that killed prosecutors Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino. After 43 years living as a fugitive, he was captured in 2006, and subjected him to the stringent Article 41-bis prison regime until his death on 13 July 2016. Early years Provenzano was born the third of seven children on 31 January 1933, in Corleone, Sicily, to farmers Angelo Provenzano and Giovanna Rigoglioso. It was during this period that a series of illegal activities began, especially cattle raiding and the theft of foodstuffs. In August 1958, Provenzano was one of the 14 gunmen who backed mob boss Luciano Leggio in the ambush and murder of Michele Navarra. Leggio subsequently became the head of the Family. Over the next five years, Provenzano helped Leggio hunt down and kill many of Navarra's surviving supporters. In September 1963, Provenzano became a fugitive after a failed hit on one of Navarra's men ‚Äì at this point, he was not running from the police but from Mafia vendetta. Leggio said of Provenzano: \\"He shoots like an angel but has the brains of a chicken.\\"\\"Gangster No 1 \\". The Guardian. 24 April 2001.Longrigg, Boss of Bosses, p. 152. On 10 September 1963, an arrest warrant was issued against Provenzano for the murder of one of Navarra's men. Provenzano participated in the Viale Lazio massacre on 10 December 1969: the killing of Michele Cavataio for his role in the First Mafia War. The attack nearly went wrong, as Cavataio was able to shoot and kill Calogero Bagarella, before Provenzano killed him with a Beretta 38/A submachine gun and earned himself a reputation as a Mafia killer with the attack. La vera storia di Provenzano. Siino: \\"Sparava come un dio\\" . La Repubblica, 14 April 2006. However, according to Gaetano Grado, one of the participants who turned government witness later, it was Provenzano who botched the attack, shooting too early. Processo per strage dopo 37 anni , La Repubblica. 29 May 2007. Leggio was captured by police in 1974, and Salvatore Riina was effectively left in charge. Provenzano became the second in command of the Corleonesi, Riina's right-hand man. Fugitive and later years In 1981, Provenzano and Riina unleashed the so-called Second Mafia War, with which they eliminated rival bosses and established a new \\"Commission\\", composed only of capomandamenti; during the meetings of the \\"Commission\\", Provenzano participated in the decisions and the organization of numerous murders as an influential exponent of the district of Corleone and repeatedly protected, with intimidation, the political career of Vito Ciancimino, the main political referent of the Corleonesi. \\"Provenzano confidente dei carabinieri\\" . La Repubblica. 22 October 2005. Provenzano took the reins of the Corleonesi after Riina was arrested in January 1993, and Leoluca Bagarella in June 1995, both having been sentenced in absentia at the Maxi Trial in the mid-1980s to life imprisonment for ordering multiple murders, including the two high-profile bombings (the Capaci massacre and Via D'Amelio massacre) that killed prosecutors Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino. Evasion and capture Comparison between the last photofit, performed in 2005 and a photo taken after his capture in 2006. Provenzano frowned upon the use of telephones and issued orders and communications (even to his family) through small, hand- delivered notes called pizzini. Many of the notes from Provenzano that police have intercepted sign off with religious blessings, such as one that concluded \\"May the Lord bless and protect you.\\" According to mob godmother-turned- informant Giuseppina Vitale, Provenzano had appeared at a 1992 Cosa Nostra summit meeting dressed in the purple robes of a Catholic bishop.\\"Mafia's boss may dress as bishop\\", Guardian Unlimited, 17 May 2005. Religious behaviour and language progressively became the prominent features of Provenzano's figure. For example, Provenzano systematically underlined verses from the Bible and took notes of relevant passages to be threaded in his pizzini through otherwise routine instructions regarding daily business matters. He also recurrently thanked 'Our Lord Jesus Christ', and referred to 'The Divine Providence' and 'Our beloved Lord', expressing the hope that 'He might help us to do the right things'. In particular, the expression Con il volere di Dio (With God's will), to date has been counted 43 times, and it often appears more than once in the same piece of communication. Provenzano used a version of the Caesar cipher, used by Julius Caesar in wartime communications. The Caesar code involves shifting each letter of the alphabet forward three places; Provenzano's pizzini code did the same, then replaced letters with numbers indicating their position in the alphabet. For example, one reported note by Provenzano read \\"I met 512151522 191212154 and we agreed that we will see each other after the holidays...\\" This name was decoded as \\"Binnu Riina\\". In October 2003, Provenzano was driven to France, allegedly by Villabate mobster Salvatore Troia, to undergo prostate surgery at a private clinic near Marseille.Mafia boss flees Sicily to have prostate surgery in France, The Telegraph, 27 February 2005. Provenzano was also provided with fake travel and medical records, under the name of Salvatore Troia's father, Gaspare Troia, a Sicilian baker. Mario Cusimano, another Villabate mobster who was later arrested, began to collaborate with police in 2005, and revealed to the investigators that the identity card used by Provenzano to go to Marseille had been stamped by Francesco Campanella, former president of the municipal council of Villabate, and in September 2005, Campanella also began to collaborate with police who confirmed that he was the one who had stamped the document. The Italian State Police were able to create a photofit of Provenzano based on the descriptions of informants, as well as doctors and nurses at the Marseilles clinic where Provenzano was admitted for surgery. On 25 January 2005, police raided various homes in Sicily and arrested 46 Mafia suspects believed to be helping Provenzano elude the authorities.\\"Anti-mafia raids net 46 suspects\\" , BBC News, 25 January 2005. Although they did not catch the elusive Mafia boss himself, investigators nonetheless unearthed evidence that the 72-year-old Provenzano was still very much alive and in control of the Mafia, in the form of his cryptic handwritten notes, his preferred method of giving orders to his men. Two months later another raid, which netted over 80 Mafiosi took place, although Provenzano was not among those captured, yet again.\\"Sicilian police arrest 84 Mafiosi in raids on capital\\" , The Telegraph, 8 March 2005. Provenzano had been a fugitive from the law since 1963. Until his arrest, the only known photographs of him were taken during the 1950s; the last-known photo was taken in 1959: a serious youth with greased hair wearing a suit for a saint's festival. Provenzano was finally captured on 11 April 2006, by the Italian police near his home town, Corleone.\\"'Top Mafia boss' caught in Italy\\" , BBC News, 11 April 2006. A spokesman for the Palermo police, Agent Daniele Macaluso, said Provenzano had been arrested during the morning near Corleone, 60 km south of Palermo and was being driven back to the Sicilian capital.\\"Italy's 'top Mafia boss' is arrested\\" , Independent Online Edition, 11 April 2006. Arrestato il boss della mafia Bernardo Provenzano , Polizia di Stato, 11 April 2006. The police were able to pinpoint Provezano's exact location by the simplest of connections; they tracked a delivery of clean laundry from his family to his farmhouse hide-out. After his arrest After his arrest, he was held at the maximum security prison in Terni, and subjected to the Article 41-bis prison regime. After one year, he was transferred to a prison in Novara where he tried several times to communicate through pizzini. The Ministry of Justice then decided to apply \\"special surveillance\\" on Provenzano. In total, Provenzano was given 20 life sentences plus 49 years and one month, and solitary confinement for 33 years and six months. After the arrest of Provenzano, Salvatore Lo Piccolo and Matteo Messina Denaro were thought to be the new leaders of Cosa Nostra. Mafia cerca il confronto con lo Stato , Sebastiano Gulisano, Polizia e democrazia, September 2001Prosecutors fear capture of mafia boss will spark bloody war of succession, by John Hooper, The Guardian, April 13, 2006 However, about 350 pizzini were found at Provenzano's hide-out, some of which had indicated that Provenzano's joint deputies in Palermo were Salvatore Lo Piccolo and Antonio Rotolo, capomandamento of Pagliarelli, a Corleonesi loyalist in the days of Tot√≤ Riina. In a message referring to an important decision for Cosa Nostra, Provenzano told Rotolo: \\"It's up to you, me and Lo Piccolo to decide this thing.\\"Police strike at heart of mafia averts bloody power struggle , by John Hooper, The Guardian, June 21, 2006. Anti- Mafia prosecutor Antonio Ingroia of the Direzione distrettuale antimafia (DDA) of Palermo said that it was unlikely that there would be an all-out war over who would fill Provenzano's shoes. \\"Right now I don't think that's probable,\\" he said. Of the two possible successors, Ingroia thought Lo Piccolo was the more likely heir to the Mafia throne. \\"He's from Palermo, and that's still the most powerful Mafia stronghold,\\" Ingroia said.In Sicily, the end of 'Pax Mafiosa'? , International Herald Tribune, April 13, 2006 Two months after Provenzano's arrest, on 20 June 2006, authorities issued 52 arrest warrants against the top echelon of Cosa Nostra in the city of Palermo (Operation Gotha). In November 2009, Massimo Ciancimino, the son of former mayor of Palermo Vito Ciancimino, said that Provenzano betrayed the whereabouts of Riina. Police sent Vito Ciancimino maps of Palermo. One of the maps was delivered to Provenzano, then a Mafia fugitive. Ciancimino said the map was returned by Provenzano who indicated the precise location of Riina's hiding place.Boss Riina 'betrayed' by Provenzano , ANSA, 5 November 2009.Italy: Top Mafia fugitive 'betrayed' by boss , Adnkronos International, 5 November 2009. On March 19, 2011, it was confirmed that Provenzano was suffering from bladder cancer, and was transferred from Novara to a prison in Parma; on May 9, 2012, he attempted suicide by putting his head in a plastic bag, with the aim of suffocation, but was foiled when it was observed by a prison police officer. On 9 April 2014, he was admitted into the San Paolo Hospital in Milan.

He was at one time a professional boxer, and wrote novels about the sport. Personal life Vernon Scannell, whose birth name was John Vernon Bain, was born in 1922 in Spilsby, Lincolnshire. The family, always poor, moved frequently, including Ballaghaderreen in Ireland, Beeston, and Eccles, before settling in Buckinghamshire. Bain spent most of his youth growing up in Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire. His father had fought in the First World War, and came to make a living as a commercial photographer. Scannell attended the local Queen's Park Boys' School, an elementary council schoolScannell, Vernon, Drums of Morning, London: Robson Books, 1992. He left school at the age of 14 to work as a clerk in an insurance office. His real passions, however, were for the unlikely combination of boxing and literature. He had been winning boxing titles at school and had been a keen reader from a very early age, although not properly attaching to poetry until about aged 15, when he picked up a Walter de la Mare poem and was \\"instantly and permanently hooked\\". He frequently read both the poetry of Thomas Hardy and the thrillers of Edgar Wallace. Scannell enlisted in the army \\" as a lark\\" in 1940, shortly after war was declared. He joined the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders., and two years later was transferred to the Gordon Highlanders, a part of the 51st Highland Division.Cover note, Not Without Glory, London: Woburn Press. The war took him into action in the North African desert. He fought at El Alamein and across the western desert during the Eighth Army's drive to reach Tunisia. Following an assault on an Axis held hill bear Gabes he watched as his Gordon Highlanders moved through the recently taken position, looting the dead, both Allied and Axis. Revolted, he walked away. He was caught and court-martialled for deserting a forward area. Sentenced to three years imprisonment, he spent six months in one of the harshest military penal institutions in Alexandria before being released on a suspended sentence to take part in the Normandy landings. His war ended when he was shot in both legs while on night patrol near Caen. He was shipped back to a military hospital at Winwick in Lancashire before being sent on to a convalescent depot. Scannell had always very much disliked army life, finding nothing in his temperament which fitted him for the part of a soldier.Cover note An Argument of Kings, London: Robson Books. Following the end of the war in Europe (V.E. Day) he deserted again and spent two years on the run, earning his living with jobs in the theatre, professional boxing bouts and tutoring and coaching, all the while teaching himself by reading everything he could. During this evasive time Scannell was writing poetry and was first published in Tribune and The Adelphi. He was also boxing for Leeds University, winning the Northern Universities Championships at three weights. In 1947 he was arrested and court-martialled and sent to Northfield Military Hospital, a mental institution near Birmingham. On discharge he returned to Leeds and then went to London, where, supporting himself with teaching jobs and boxing, he settled down to writing. Scannell, a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature won many poetry awards, including for war poems such as his collection Walking Wounded. A. E. Housman said that \\"the business of poetry is to harmonise the sadness of the universe\\" and Scannell quoted this with approval. Scannell's poems, with their themes of love, violence and mortality, were shaped and influenced by his wartime experiences. Scannell was awarded a Writing Fellowship in 1975 as Resident Poet in Berinsfield, Oxfordshire, an experience he recounts in A Proper GentlemanCover note, New & Collected Poems 1950 - 1980, London: Robson Books, 1980. and later, in 1979 he spent a term as Poet in Residence at the King's School, Canterbury.James Andrew Taylor, Walking Wounded: The Life and Poetry of Vernon Scannell, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013. His final collection, Last Post, was published in 2007; he had been working on it until not long before his death. Teaching In the late 1950s and early 1960s he was a teacher of History, English Language and English Literature at Hazelwood School, Limpsfield, Surrey, teaching 8- to 13-year-old pupils. He brought his enthusiasm for boxing into the school and, while he did not exactly teach it, he ensured there were interesting, sadistic and voyeuristic bouts between boys ill-matched in size and weight. He was also able to write poetry about boxing. Literary life He received the Heinemann Award for Literature in 1961 for an early poetry volume, The Masks of Love, and the Cholmondeley Award for poetry in 1974. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1960 and granted a Civil List pension in recognition of his services to literature in 1981.\\"Vernon Scannell (obituary)\\", The Telegraph, 19 November 2007. Stephen Spender, the poet perceptively wrote to Scannell in a letter in 1953: \\"you write good poetry and that is all that matters.\\"Scannell Vernon, Tiger and the Rose, London: Hamish & Hamilton, 1971. Seamus Heaney in a letter to Andrew Taylor said he admired Scannell's poems \\"not only for their sturdy metrical pace and structure, but for their combination of mordancy and a sense of mortality\\". John Carey, the critic commented: \\"Scannell nearly always works on two levels, one realistic and external, the other imaginative, metaphorical, haunted by memory and desire. A master of the dramatic monologue, his work is drenched in humanity. It resounds with memories.\\"Foreword to Taylor, Walking Wounded: The Life and Poetry of Vernon Scannell, 2013. Scannell also wrote the verse narration for BBC Television film A House that Died.Cover note, Tiger and the Rose, London: Hamish & Hamilton, 1971. He also received a special award from the Wilfred Owen Association \\"in recognition of his contribution to war poetry\\". Scannell's best-known book of war poetry is Walking Wounded (1965). The title poem recollects a column of men returning from battle: \\"No one was suffering from a lethal hurt, They were not magnified by noble wounds, There was no splendour in that company.\\" Scannell is also the author of a memoir, The Tiger and the Rose (1983). The unadorned narrative covers five years' military service and a brief boxing career. Scannell writes about the conclusion to his army life, \\"Twenty-five years ago, 1945...was the year I made what might seem like a desperate decision and performed what might appear to be an act of criminal folly, manic selfishness, zany recklessness, abject cowardice or even, perhaps, eccentric courage. I deserted from the Army. The first recipient of the Owen Award, Christopher Logue, author of some of the best war poetry of the past half-century (in the form of versions of the Iliad), spent two years in a military prison, on a charge of handling stolen pass books. What would Owen say? He'd say: Never trust the teller, trust the tale.\\"\\"Network your poetry\\", The Times, 27 July 2007. Historian Martin Johnes has used Scannell's 1951 novel The Fight to explore racial attitudes in 1950s Britain. He argues that its depictions of reactions to a black boxer illustrate the diversity of racial attitudes, including outright racism, better than contemporary sociological studies where private assumptions and thoughts were hidden. Death Scannell spent the final years of his life living in Otley, West Yorkshire, where he died at his home at the age of 85 after a long illness.

It was promoted by local interests in Kendal when it became clear that the Lancaster and Carlisle Railway would not be routed through Kendal. It was built from a junction at Oxenholme to Kendal to a terminus near Windermere; at the time there was no settlement of that name. The line opened in April 1847. The engineer was Joseph Locke and the partnership of contractors consisted of Thomas Brassey, William Mackenzie, Robert Stephenson and George Heald.Helps, Arthur The Life and Works of Mr Brassey, 1872 republished Nonsuch, 2006, p. 107. Nicholson, Cornelius, A Well-spent Life, pub. Kendal 1890, p78-88 - available on archive.org (Call number: SRLF_UCLA:LAGE-2530919) Excursion traffic and residential development was greatly encouraged by the branch line, and the town of Windermere flourished but the company was not commercially successful and sold its line to the London and North Western Railway. The leisure business on which the branch line depended declined considerably around 1960 and the infrastructure was simplified. It remains open as the Windermere Branch Line. Origin Kendal and Windermere Railway in 1847 In the 1830s the railway network was emerging in England and central Scotland but they were not connected. From 1832 it became increasingly certain that a connection between England and Scotland would be built northward from Preston to Carlisle and beyond. The difficult terrain presented a significant challenge, particularly because steam engines did not have a great hauling power in the early years. A line following the Cumberland coast reached by a massive barrage across Morecambe Bay was proposed, but although it gave access to population centres, it was a very roundabout route and the cost of the Morecambe Bay barrage would be considerable. More direct routes were proposed involving steep gradients and long tunnels and several were viable. Kendal was the only town of any size between Lancaster and Carlisle and there was great dismay in Kendal when the favoured routes by-passed the town. A possible route running north from Kendal along Long Sleddale required a long and deep tunnel to proceed to the west shore of Hawes Water.Later developed as Haweswater Reservoir.Brian Reed, Crewe to Carlisle, Ian Allan, London, 1969, , pages 94 to 97 Finance was hard to come by and proponents of the Lancaster and Carlisle Railway, delayed presenting a Bill in Parliament, but in 1843 their engineer, Joseph Locke, made some modifications to the intended route to save expense, and published a route passing several miles east of Kendal. Interested parties in Kendal decided to build a branch railway to their town from the Lancaster and Carlisle Railway and continue it to the shore of Windermere, which was by then a tourist attraction.Reed, pages 116 to 118 In the 1845 session of Parliament, a Bill was presented for the Kendal and Windermere Railway which was to run from Oxenholme to Birthwaite, a small community in what is now Windermere town. It would make a junction with the Lancaster and Carlisle Railway at Oxenholme. The Bill passed without opposition, and Royal Assent was given on 30 June 1845.Donald J Grant, Directory of the Railway Companies of Great Britain, Matador Publishers, Kibworth Beauchamp, 2017, , pages 205 and 206 THe line would be single track between Kendal and Windermere, although it was changed to double track, without increasing the authorised ¬£125,000 share capital.Reed, pages 198 and 199David Joy, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: volume 14: the Lake Counties, David & Charles Publishers, Newton Abbot, 1983, 0 946537 02 X, pages 201 and 202 Construction was carried out in collaboration with the Lancaster and Carlisle Railway.Reed, pages 139 and 140 Opening Windermere station in 1951 The line was opened ceremonially on 21 September 1846 at the same time as the L&CR; line opened between Lancaster and Kendal Junction. The opening to passenger traffic was on the following day.Reed, page 154 Until the L&CR; line was opened northwards, the line was operated between Lancaster and Kendal. After the opening of the L&CR; to Carlisle, some Kendal trains were worked as a shuttle service between Kendal and Oxenholme, a practice perpetuated when the K&WR; opened throughout to Windermere, on 20 April 1847. Goods traffic on the Kendal line began on 4 January 1847. The junction station was named Kendal Junction and was an exchange platform not accessible other than to change trains.Joy, page 30 Early operation At first there were five trains a day in each direction between Kendal and Windermere, with extra trips to Oxenholme; but by the summer of 1853 there were six trains each way between Kendal and Windermere and nine return journeys between Kendal and Oxenholme. A passenger carriage was attached to the 16.00 goods train out of Windermere. On special holidays a cheap day return ticket from Kendal to Windermere cost 6d. The K&WR; company was constantly in financial and operational difficulty and petty disagreements with the L&CR;, on which it relied for onward journeys were commonplace. By 1848 the K&WR; saw that independence was difficult and made overtures to the L&CR; to lease or buy the line, but was not received favourably. For ten years there was constant friction. K&WR; trains were often late arriving at Oxenholme and main line trains were held until the L&CR; grew impatient and told the K&WR; to get its trains to the junction ten minutes earlier. The branch was worked by the London and North Western Railway as part of the pool of rolling stock it made available to the Lancaster and Carlisle Railway. From summer 1850 the working was transferred to E B Wilson, of Leeds, until the company took on its own working in November 1851. The K&WR; system was leased in perpetuity to the L&CR; from 1 May 1858 and Parliamentary ratification took place in the L&CR; general powers Act of 13 August 1859 when the L&CR; was leased to the LNWR which guaranteed the K&WR; shareholders 3 per cent on ordinary shares and 6 per cent on the preference shares. The K&WR; company continued as a financial entity until 21 July 1879. Development Windermere station in 2008 At first Windermere station stood alone with only the Windermere hotel nearby, but the lake was an attractive destination for visitors and also for residences for the wealthy merchants of Lancashire's industrial towns. The growth of excursion travel and local businesses to support it was phenomenal. On Whit Monday 1883, excursion visitors numbered 8,000 persons. Wealthy merchants were provided with an exclusive club car working in to Windermere on Friday afternoons, but later running each way daily. The vehicle continued in use until 1939.Joy, pages 203 and 205 Kendal station was inadequate and the LNWR reconstructed it in 1861 as \\"a handsome and substantial structure\\". Decline Although Kendal was an industrial centre, the line could not sustain its importance without the leisure traffic, and that declined in the 1960s. The route was reduced to a single line without a run-round facility at Windermere in 1973, and Joy remarks that: > This created the bizarre situation of excursions having to terminate at > Oxenholme and disgorge their passengers on to droves of road coaches while > the trains were worked empty over the 50 miles to Carlisle for turning and > servicing. In 1986 the station site at Windermere was simplified, a supermarket was built on the former goods yard and the station was relocated a short distance from its original position.Railway Magazine, volume 443, 1986, page 443 Opposition Opposition to the line came from people against what they saw as destruction of the Lake District landscape. They included the poet William Wordsworth. His letters to the editor of the Morning Post are reproduced in The Illustrated Wordsworth's Guide to the Lakes, P. Bicknell, Ed. (Congdon and Weed, New York, 1984), pp. 186‚Äì198. His reactions to the technological and \\"picturesque\\" incursions of man on his beloved, wild landscape most famously include the following sonnet: On the opening of the railway in 1847 one of the contracting engineers, George Heald, wrote an impassioned riposte to Wordsworth accusing him of wanting to obstruct the opportunities the railway would bring. It is dated 15 April 1847, the Locomotive at Orrest Head.Reply to Wordsworth's sonnet on the Kendal & Windermere railway. George Heald. Published Orrest Head : s.n., 1847. (Copy in Leeds University Library) He argues for the democratising influence of the railway and the cultural and social benefits it will bring rather than the economic reasons that might be expected from a railway engineer: See also *History of rail transport in Great Britain *List of early British railway companies NotesReferences Category:London and North Western Railway Category:Rail transport in Cumbria Category:Early British railway companies Category:Railway companies established in 1845 Category:Railway lines opened in 1847 Category:Railway companies disestablished in 1858 Category:1845 establishments in England Category:British companies disestablished in 1858 Category:British companies established in 1845 ","title":"Kendal and Windermere Railway"},{"id":"1490310","text":"In economics, the principle of absolute advantage refers to the ability of a party (an individual, or firm, or country) to produce a greater quantity of a good, product, or service than competitors. Adam Smith first described the principle of absolute advantage in the context of international trade, using labor as the only input. Since absolute advantage is determined by a simple comparison of labor productiveness, it is possible for a party to have no absolute advantage in anything. Origin of the theory The concept of absolute advantage is generally attributed to Adam Smith for his 1776 publication The Wealth of Nations in which he countered mercantilist ideas. Smith argued that it was impossible for all nations to become rich simultaneously by following mercantilism because the export of one nation is another nation‚Äôs import and instead stated that all nations would gain simultaneously if they practiced free trade and specialized in accordance with their absolute advantage. Smith also stated that the wealth of nations depends upon the goods and services available to their citizens, rather than their gold reserves. Because Smith only focused on comparing labor productivities to determine absolute advantage, he did not develop the concept of comparative advantage. While there are possible gains from trade with absolute advantage, the gains may not be mutually beneficial. Comparative advantage focuses on the range of possible mutually beneficial exchanges.

The UK is able to produce one unit of cloth with fewer hours of labor, therefore the UK has an absolute advantage in the production of cloth. On the other hand, Portugal commits 90 hours to produce one unit of wine, which is fewer than the UK's hours of work necessary to produce one unit of wine. Therefore, Portugal has an absolute advantage in the production of wine. If the two countries specialize in producing the good for which they have the absolute advantage, and if they exchange part of the good with each other, both of the two countries can end up with more of each good than they would have in the absence of trade. In the absence of trade, each country produces one unit of cloth and one unit of wine, i.e. a combined total production of 2 units of cloth and 2 units of wine. Here, if England commits all of its labor (80+100) for the production of cloth for which England has the absolute advantage, England produces (80+100)√∑80=2.25 units of cloth. On the other hand, if Portugal commits all of its labor (90+120) for the production of wine, Portugal produces (90+120)√∑90=2.33... units of wine. The combined total production in this case is 2.25 units of cloth and 2.33 units of wine which is greater than the total production of each good had there been no specialization. Assuming free trade this will lead to cheaper prices for both goods for both countries. Example 2 You and your friends decided to help with fundraising for a local charity group by printing T-shirts and making birdhouses. *Scenario 1: One of your friends, Gina, can print 5 T-shirts or build 3 birdhouses an hour. Your other friend, Mike, can print 3 T-shirts an hour or build 2 birdhouses an hour. Because your friend Gina is more productive at printing T-shirts and building birdhouses compared to Mike, she has an absolute advantage in both printing T-shirts and building birdhouses. *Scenario 2: Suppose Gina wasn't as agile with the hammer and could only make 1 birdhouse an hour, but she took a screen printing class and could print 10 T-shirts an hour. Mike on the other hand takes woodworking and so he can build 5 birdhouses an hour, but he doesn't know the first thing about making T-shirts so he can only print 2 T-shirts an hour. While Gina would have the absolute advantage in printing shirts, Mike would have an absolute advantage in building birdhouses. Further reading  *.

He was the head of the Corleonesi, the Mafia faction that originated in the town of Corleone. He is universally known with the surname Liggio, a result of a misspelling in court documents in the 1960s.Obituary: Luciano Liggio, The Independent, November 17, 1993 As well as setting the Corleonesi on track to become the dominant Mafia clan in Sicily, he became infamous for avoiding convictions for a multitude of crimes, including homicide, before he was finally imprisoned for life in 1974. Early life Leggio was one of ten children raised in extreme poverty on a small farm. He turned to crime in his teens. His first conviction was when he was aged 18 for stealing corn; as soon as he completed a six-month sentence for this crime, he murdered the man who had reported him to the police. In 1945 he was recruited by the Mafia boss of Corleone, Michele Navarra, to work as an enforcer and hitman. That same year Leggio shot dead a farm-hand in order to take his job, then immediately took over the farm by demanding the owner sign it over to him at gunpoint. While behind bars in the late 1940s he met Salvatore Riina, who was then aged 19 and starting a six-year sentence for manslaughter. The two eventually became accomplices in crime after Riina's release, as did two other young local criminals, Calogero Bagarella and Bernardo Provenzano. On 10 March 1948, trade unionist Placido Rizzotto was kidnapped and murdered. The following year two men confessed to helping Leggio kidnap Rizzotto, who shot the victim and dumped him in a cavern.Dickie, Cosa Nostra, p. 333 Leggio went into hiding, and was tried twice in absentia for Rizzotto's murder.Identificati dopo 64 anni i resti di Rizzotto il sindacalista che combatteva la mafia di Liggio Murder of Navarra Michele Navarra tried to have Leggio killed in June 1958. Leggio was invited by Navarra to meet him at an estate but instead he found fifteen armed men there. The hitmen hired for the task did a poor job and Leggio escaped with just minor injuries. The event left Leggio and his followers with the knowledge that they were as good as dead if they did not strike back soon.Hess, Mafia & Mafiosi, pp. 63‚Äì65 A few weeks later, on 2 August 1958, Navarra and a fellow doctor (Giovanni Russo, who had nothing to do with criminal activities) were both shot to death on an isolated country road as they drove home in Navarra's Fiat 1100. The car was blocked on the open road by two other vehicles and riddled by submachine-gun bullets. A few weeks later, on September 6, three men known as friends of Navarra were killed in a raid at Corleone. Reciprocal killings went on until 1963 and Leggio had to disappear having been condemned for the killing of Navarra.Schneider & Schneider, Reversible Destiny, p. 59-60http://archiviopiolatorre.camera.it/img- repo/DOCUMENTAZIONE/Antimafia/01_rel_p03_2.pdf Leggio thus became the boss of the Corleone Mafia. Among Navarra's suspected killers were Bernardo Provenzano and Salvatore \\"Tot√≤\\" Riina.Profile: Bernardo Provenzano, BBC News, April 11, 2006 Capture The 1964 arrest Leggio was captured in Corleone on 14 May 1964, at the house of Leoluchina Sorisi, the former girlfriend of Rizzotto. Leggio was imprisoned at Ucciardone prison on Palermo, but in December 1968 he was acquitted for lack of evidence in the trial held in Catanzaro against the protagonists of the First Mafia War, and also of that held in Bari in 1969, in which he was accused of the murders that took place in Corleone starting in 1958. The trial was regarded as farcical, with reports of blatant witness intimidation and evidence tampering. For example, fragments of a broken car light found at the Navarra murder scene which had been identified as belonging to an Alfa Romeo car owned by Leggio had, by the time of the trial, been replaced by bits of a broken light from a completely different make of car. The judges and prosecutors were sent anonymous letters threatening them with death. Fugitive again Immediately after the trial, which ended in 1969, a determined Italian magistrate named Cesare Terranova appealed against Leggio's acquittal for the Navarra slaying. After hearing of his indictment to stand trial once more, Leggio checked into a private health clinic in Rome to have treatment for Pott's disease, which he had suffered from most of his life and for which he had to wear a brace. Leggio then relocated to Milan.https://www.camera.it/_dati/leg13/lavori/doc/xxiii/050/pdf003.pdf In February 1971, Liggio ordered the kidnapping for extortion of Antonino Caruso, son of the industrialist Giacomo Caruso, and also that of the son of the builder Francesco Vassallo in Palermo.http://archiviopiolatorre.camera.it/img- repo/DOCUMENTAZIONE/Antimafia/02_rel_6.pdf Leggio was linked to the murder of the General Attorney of Sicily, Pietro Scaglione, who was shot dead on 5 May 1971 with his police bodyguard Antonino Lo Russo.http://archiviopiolatorre.camera.it/img- repo/DOCUMENTAZIONE/Antimafia/04_rel_02.pdf Life imprisonment and death He was finally captured in Milan on 16 May 1974. He was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1975, and imprisoned at the Badu 'e Carros prison in Nuoro, Sardinia. He is believed to have retained significant influence from behind bars, including commissioning the 1977 murder of Lieutenant Colonel Giuseppe Russo. Leggio had ordered the 1979 killing of Judge Terranova as a revenge for the insult at the interrogation in the 1960s; the murder was approved by the Sicilian Mafia Commission. Omicidio Terranova: La verit√† di Di Carlo, Centonove, 6 March 1998 Leggio was charged with ordering Terranova's murder, but was acquitted for lack of evidence, both in the first trial, which was held in Reggio Calabria in 1983, and three years later, in 1986, in the appeal process. L'uccisero i ¬´corleonesi¬ª di Liggio, La Sicilia, 25 September 2011 By the end of the 1970s, his lieutenant Salvatore Riina was in control of the Corleonesi clan. In the Maxi Trial of 1986/87, the jury rejected the prosecution's call for 15 years' imprisonment for Liggio, and the jury acquitted him of four murders that prosecutors charged he had masterminded from his jail cell in Sardinia. On 15 November 1993, he died in prison from a heart attack, aged 68. Luciano Leggio; Mafia Boss, 68, The New York Times, November 16, 1993 He is buried in Corleone.

Biography Born Penelope Loader Maffey, she was the daughter of Sir John Maffey, later 1st Baron Rugby, who was to become Governor-General of the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, Permanent Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies and wartime United Kingdom Representative to Dublin. Earlier, he had been the private secretary to the Viceroy of India and Governor of the North-West Frontier Province, thus Penelope was born in Peshawar and spent her early years in India, where three of her siblings died in childhood. When she was seven years old, she returned to England for prep school, then went on to Sherborne School for Girls. Her parents had a house, Anmer Hall, on the King's Sandringham estate, which led to her socialising with the royal family. Indeed, she became the King's favourite. Maffey was presented at Court and named Debutante of the Year. She was romantically linked with several men, including Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld (later Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands), Esmond Harmsworth and society artist Simon Elwes (1902‚Äì1975), which caused a minor scandal as he was married and a Roman Catholic. Maintaining a platonic friendship, she accompanied Prince Bernhard on his honeymoon in 1937 and became good friends with his new wife, Princess Juliana of the Netherlands. In 1938 she met Canadian William Aitken, a nephew of media magnate Lord Beaverbrook, and a journalist at the Evening Standard. They were married later that year at St Peter's, Eaton Square. Their son Jonathan was born in Dublin in 1942 (Queen Juliana of the Netherlands stood sponsor) and their daughter Maria in 1945. William had joined the RAF and Penelope joined the WRVS, helping to evacuate German children to Ireland. In 1944, her husband was badly hurt in a Spitfire crash. She spent two years nursing him back to health, at a time when her baby son was ill with tuberculosis and the family home in London was bombed. Her husband was elected as Conservative Member of Parliament for Bury St Edmunds in 1950, and he was knighted in 1963, making Penelope Lady Aitken. She devoted herself to community work in support of her husband's political career, becoming a magistrate and running the Clothing Exchange, which played a major role in helping the victims of the East Coast floods in 1953. Eventually she was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE). She lived with the children in Halesworth to be near her father, who died in 1969 aged 91. The family fortune was wiped out by death duties and a stock market crash. She restarted her affair with Simon Elwes, and then had a long relationship with Sir John Davis, chairman of Rank Xerox. Gardening was another passion. She created a garden at Playford, her moated Tudor house near Ipswich. Later she created an English garden at her house near Santa Eulalia on the Spanish island of Ibiza, smuggling sacks of soil and rare plants through customs. Lady Aitken continued to be seen at many parties and with many men. Satirist and broadcaster Noel Picarda instantly fell in love with her, and eventually became her live-in companion until his death in 2003. Her house and her parties were often the scene of political machinations in Conservative circles and she was often seen holding court among politicians or her family, whether in London, her local pub or the Gironde. Aitken died of cancer, She had two children ‚Äì Jonathan Aitken and Maria Aitken.

Miles operated as an independent firm from 1884 until 1979 and as a wholly owned subsidiary of Bayer AG from 1979 until 1995, when it was consolidated into the parent corporation. History By 1890, the sales success of his patent medicine tonic, \\"Dr. Miles Restorative Nervine\\", in treating \\"nervous\\" ailments (including \\"nervousness or nervous exhaustion, sleeplessness, hysteria, headache, neuralgia, backache, pain, epilepsy, spasms, fits, and St. Vitus' dance\\") led him to develop a mail order medicine business. Miles also published Medical News, from 1884‚Äîa thinly disguised marketing vehicle for Nervine, now referenced as advertorials.

In 1932, the company became Dr. Miles Laboratories, then, in 1935, the name was again changed, to Miles Laboratories. During World War Two the company produced various goods for the US war effort, including packaged coffee products for military rations. In 1970‚Äîto complement its existing vitamin manufacturing division‚ÄîMiles laboratories merged with Adventist-owned Worthington Foods of Ohio, opening a new Worthington Foods factory in 1972 to quadruple production capacity for a line of vegetarian foods based on the meat analogue developed over the previous two decades by Worthington, to be marketed under the brand name Morning Star Farm Foods,Worthington Libraries \\"Officers of Worthington Foods and Miles Laboratories\\"; WorthingtonMemory.org; Worthington, Ohio; 16 November 2017.

In 1979, Bayer AG‚Äîafter its U.S. and Canadian aspirin business was seized as enemy property during World War I and subsequently sold as enemy assets‚Äîpurchased Miles Laboratories and its subsidiary Miles Canada to reestablish a presence in North America. In the process, Bayer also acquired products such as Alka-Seltzer, Flintstones Vitamins, One-A-Day Vitamins, Bactine, S.O.S Soap Pads, and Worthington Foods. Bayer continued to operate Miles Laboratories and developed many drugs based upon biological extracts, such as Kogenate, Gamimune-N and other immunoglobulins, and Trasylol, as well as diagnostic products such as blood glucose test strips and glucose meters. Miles also owned Cutter Laboratories, manufacturer of such diverse products as insect repellent and synthetic human Factor VIII clotting factor for hemophiliacs. In 1992, Bayer AG moved the United States headquarters of Miles to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, from Elkhart, Indiana. On April 1, 1995, Bayer eliminated the Miles brand name from all products and facilities after Bayer had acquired Sterling Winthrop the previous year.

The company was incorporated in Mexico City in 1946 by Egon Mabardi and Francisco Berrondo, both Spanish refugees who escaped turmoil of Civil War. Mabe was initially dedicated to manufacture kitchen furniture. In the 1950s, Mabe began manufacturing various appliances such as gas ranges and refrigerators. Rapid growth allowed Mabe to become the leading exporter of home appliances in Mexico as early as 1960. In 1986, Mabe entered into an important joint venture with General Electric to produce appliances for the US market. As part of an effort to move away from controlling Mexican operations from the US, GE decided to enter into the joint venture with a 48 per cent minority stake. While General Electric hoped to gain access to Mexico's low cost labour pool, Mabe was given greater access to the world's largest consumer market through GE's US distribution network. By the mid 1990s, more than two-thirds of all gas ranges and refrigerators imported into the United States were designed and manufactured by Mabe in Mexico, while 95 per cent of those sold under the General Electric names were designed in Mabe's San Luis Potosi plant, the biggest kitchens plant in the world . As a result, Mabe became the leading brand in Mexico, moving ahead of Vitro's Acros brand with a domestic market share of 50%. As the company continued to grow, exports and production remained concentrated in Latin America. By the mid 1990s, Mabe was one of the leading appliance manufacturers in the world with annual growth between 15 and 20 per cent. In Mexico, Mabe all but dominated the market, while in Latin America, Mabe commanded a 70% market share in home appliances. The group also entered into several joint ventures and alliances with other regional manufacturers. Solid sales growth in Latin America all but eliminated the impact of the peso crisis in 1995. In 2016, General Electric sold GE Appliances business to China based Haier. The transaction included the 48.4% shares of Mabe that GE held.

South of ≈åsu is Kanayama Station (straddling the border with Atsuta-ku and Nakagawa-ku), Nagoya's second-most important rail transportation hub after Nagoya Station and a major access point for the Central Japan International Airport. Many izakayas and pachinko parlors can be found in its vicinity. Naka-ku is also home to the city's Opera House and the main government offices, including the Nagoya City Hall and the Aichi Prefectural Government Office.

It spans from the Hooghly River in India's state of West Bengal to the Baleswar River in Bangladesh. It comprises closed and open mangrove forests, agriculturally used land, mudflats and barren land, and is intersected by multiple tidal streams and channels. Four protected areas in the Sundarbans are enlisted as UNESCO World Heritage Sites, viz. Sundarbans National Park, Sundarbans West, Sundarbans South and Sundarbans East Wildlife Sanctuaries. Despite these protections, the Indian Sundarbans were considered endangered in a 2020 assessment under the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems framework. The Sundarbans mangrove forest covers an area of about , of which forests in Bangladesh's Khulna Division extend over and in West Bengal, they extend over across the South 24 Parganas and North 24 Parganas districts. The most abundant tree species are sundri (Heritiera fomes) and gewa (Excoecaria agallocha). The forests provide habitat to 453 faunal wildlife, including 290 bird, 120 fish, 42 mammal, 35 reptile and eight amphibian species. Despite a total ban on all killing or capture of wildlife other than fish and some invertebrates, it appears that there is a consistent pattern of depleted biodiversity or loss of species in the 20th century, and that the ecological quality of the forest is declining. The Directorate of Forest is responsible for the administration and management of Sundarban National Park in West Bengal. In Bangladesh, a Forest Circle was created in 1993 to preserve the forest, and Chief Conservators of Forests have been posted since. Despite preservation commitments from both Governments, the Sunderbans are under threat from both natural and human-made causes. In 2007, the landfall of Cyclone Sidr damaged around 40% of the Sundarbans. The forest is also suffering from increased salinity due to rising sea levels and reduced freshwater supply. Again in May 2009 Cyclone Aila devastated Sundarban with massive casualties. At least 100,000 people were affected by this cyclone. The proposed coal-fired Rampal power station situated north of the Sundarbans at Rampal Upazila of Bagerhat District in Khulna, Bangladesh, is anticipated to further damage this unique mangrove forest according to a 2016 report by UNESCO. Etymology The Bengali name Sundarban means \\"beautiful forest.\\" It may have been derived from the word Sundari or Sundri, the local name of the mangrove species Heritiera fomes. Alternatively, it has been proposed that the name is a corruption of Samudraban, Shomudrob√¥n (\\"Sea Forest\\"), or Chandra-bandhe, the name of a tribe. History The history of the area can be traced back to 200‚Äì300 AD. A ruin of a city built by Chand Sadagar has been found in the Baghmara Forest Block. During the Mughal period, the Mughal Emperors leased the forests of the Sundarbans to nearby residents. Many criminals took refuge in the Sundarbans from the advancing armies of Emperor Akbar. Many have been known to be attacked by tigers. Many of the buildings which were built by them later fell to hands of Portuguese pirates, salt smugglers and dacoits in the 16th and 17th centuries. Evidence of the fact can be traced from the ruins at Netidhopani and other places scattered all over Sundarbans. The legal status of the forests underwent a series of changes, including the distinction of being the first mangrove forest in the world to be brought under scientific management. The area was mapped first in Persian, by the Surveyor General as early as 1769 following soon after proprietary rights were obtained from the Mughal Emperor Alamgir II by the British East India Company in 1757. Systematic management of this forest tract started in the 1860s after the establishment of a Forest Department in the Province of Bengal, in British India. The management was entirely designed to extract whatever treasures were available, but labour and lower management mostly were staffed by locals, as the British had no expertise or adaptation experience in mangrove forests. The first Forest Management Division to have jurisdiction over the Sundarbans was established in 1869. In 1875 a large portion of the mangrove forests was declared as reserved forests under the Forest Act, 1865 (Act VIII of 1865). The remaining portions of the forests were declared a reserve forest the following year and the forest, which was so far administered by the civil administration district, was placed under the control of the Forest Department. A Forest Division, which is the basic forest management and administration unit, was created in 1879 with the headquarters in Khulna, Bangladesh. The first management plan was written for the period 1893‚Äì98.UNDP (1998). Integrated resource development of the Sundarbans Reserved Forests, Bangladesh. Volume I Project BGD/84/056, United Nations Development Programme, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Dhaka, The People's Republic of Bangladesh. In 1911, it was described as a tract of waste country which had never been surveyed nor had the census been extended to it. It then stretched for about from the mouth of the Hooghly River to the mouth of the Meghna River and was bordered inland by the three settled districts of the 24 Parganas, Khulna and Bakerganj. The total area (including water) was estimated at . It was a water-logged jungle, in which tigers and other wild beasts abounded. Attempts at reclamation had not been very successful. The Sundarbans were intersected by river channels and creeks, some of which afforded water communication throughout the Bengal region both for steamboats and ships. Geography Map of the Sundarbans The Sundarban forest lies in the vast delta on the Bay of Bengal formed by the super confluence of the Ganges, Hooghly, Padma, Brahmaputra and Meghna rivers across southern Bangladesh. The seasonally flooded Sundarbans freshwater swamp forests lie inland from the mangrove forests on the coastal fringe. The forest covers of which about are in Bangladesh. The Indian part of Sundarbans is estimated to be about , of which about is occupied by water bodies in the forms of river, canals and creeks of width varying from a few metres to several kilometres. The Sundarbans is intersected by a complex network of tidal waterways, mudflats and small islands of salt-tolerant mangrove forests. The interconnected network of waterways makes almost every corner of the forest accessible by boat. The area is known for the Bengal tiger (Panthera tigris tigris), as well as numerous fauna including species of birds, spotted deer, crocodiles and snakes. The fertile soils of the delta have been subject to intensive human use for centuries, and the ecoregion has been mostly converted to intensive agriculture, with few enclaves of forest remaining. The remaining forests, taken together with the Sundarbans mangroves, are important habitat for the endangered tiger. Additionally, the Sundarbans serves a crucial function as a protective barrier for the millions of inhabitants in and around Khulna and Mongla against the floods that result from the cyclones. Physiography The mangrove-dominated Ganges Delta ‚Äì the Sundarbans ‚Äì is a complex ecosystem comprising one of the three largest single tracts of mangrove forests of the world. The larger part is situated in Bangladesh, a smaller portion of it lies in India. The Indian part of the forest is estimated to be about 40 percent, while the Bangladeshi part is 60 percent. To the south the forest meets the Bay of Bengal; to the east it is bordered by the Baleswar River and to the north there is a sharp interface with intensively cultivated land. The natural drainage in the upstream areas, other than the main river channels, is everywhere impeded by extensive embankments and polders. The Sundarbans was originally measured (about 200 years ago) to be of about . Now it has dwindled into about 1/3 of the original size. The total land area today is , including exposed sandbars with a total area of ; the remaining water area of encompasses rivers, small streams and canals. Rivers in the Sundarbans are meeting places of salt water and freshwater. Thus, it is a region of transition between the freshwater of the rivers originating from the Ganges and the saline water of the Bay of Bengal. The Sundarbans along the Bay of Bengal has evolved over the millennia through natural deposition of upstream sediments accompanied by intertidal segregation. The physiography is dominated by deltaic formations that include innumerable drainage lines associated with surface and subaqueous levees, splays and tidal flats. There are also marginal marshes above mean tide level, tidal sandbars and islands with their networks of tidal channels, subaqueous distal bars and proto-delta clays and silt sediments. The Sundarbans' floor varies from above sea level.Katebi, M.N.A. and Habib, M.G. (1987). Sundarbans and Forestry in Coastal Area Resource Development and Management Part II, BRAC Printers, Dhaka, Bangladesh. Biotic factors here play a significant role in physical coastal evolution, and for wildlife a variety of habitats have developed which include beaches, estuaries, permanent and semi-permanent swamps, tidal flats, tidal creeks, coastal dunes, back dunes and levees. The mangrove vegetation itself assists in the formation of new landmass and the intertidal vegetation plays a significant role in swamp morphology. The activities of mangrove fauna in the intertidal mudflats develop micromorphological features that trap and hold sediments to create a substratum for mangrove seeds. The morphology and evolution of the eolian dunes is controlled by an abundance of xerophytic and halophytic plants. Creepers, grasses and sedges stabilise sand dunes and uncompacted sediments. The Sunderbans mudflats (Banerjee, 1998) are found at the estuary and on the deltaic islands where low velocity of river and tidal current occurs. The flats are exposed in low tides and submerged in high tides, thus being changed morphologically even in one tidal cycle. The tides are so large that approximately one third of the land disappears and reappears every day. The interior parts of the mudflats serve as a perfect home for mangroves. Ecoregions Sundarbans features two ecoregions ‚Äî \\"Sundarbans freshwater swamp forests\\" (IM0162) and \\"Sundarbans mangroves\\" (IM1406).Ecoregions: Indo-Malayan , World Wildlife Fund Sundarbans freshwater swamp forests The Sundarbans freshwater swamp forests are a tropical moist broadleaf forest ecoregion of Bangladesh. It represents the brackish swamp forests that lie behind the Sundarbans Mangroves, where the salinity is more pronounced. The freshwater ecoregion is an area where the water is only slightly brackish and becomes quite fresh during the rainy season, when the freshwater plumes from the Ganges and the Brahmaputra rivers push the intruding salt water out and bring a deposit of silt. It covers of the vast Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta, extending from the northern part of Khulna District and finishing at the mouth of the Bay of Bengal with scattered portions extending into India's West Bengal state. The Sundarbans freshwater swamp forests lie between the upland Lower Gangetic plains moist deciduous forests and the brackish-water Sundarbans mangroves bordering the Bay of Bengal. A victim of large-scale clearing and settlement to support one of the densest human populations in Asia, this ecoregion is under a great threat of extinction. Hundreds of years of habitation and exploitation have exacted a heavy toll on this ecoregion's habitat and biodiversity. There are two protected areas ‚Äì Narendrapur (110 km2) and Ata Danga Baor (20 km2) that cover a mere 130 km2 of the ecoregion. Habitat loss in this ecoregion is so extensive, and the remaining habitat is so fragmented, that it is difficult to ascertain the composition of the original vegetation of this ecoregion. According to Champion and Seth (1968), the freshwater swamp forests are characterised by Heritiera minor, Xylocarpus molluccensis, Bruguiera conjugata, Sonneratia apetala, Avicennia officinalis, and Sonneratia caseolaris, with Pandanus tectorius, Hibiscus tiliaceus, and Nipa fruticans along the fringing banks. Sundarbans Mangroves Ecoregion IM406, also known as the Sundarbans Mangroves ecoregion The Sundarbans Mangroves ecoregion on the coast forms the seaward fringe of the delta and is the world's largest mangrove ecosystem, with of an area covered. The dominant mangrove species Heritiera fomes is locally known as sundri or sundari. Mangrove forests are not home to a great variety of plants. They have a thick canopy, and the undergrowth is mostly seedlings of the mangrove trees. Besides the sundari, other tree species in the forest include Avicennia, Xylocarpus mekongensis, Xylocarpus granatum, Sonneratia apetala, Bruguiera gymnorhiza, Ceriops decandra, Aegiceras corniculatum, Rhizophora mucronata, and Nypa fruticans palms. Twenty-six of the fifty broad mangrove species found in the world grow well in the Sundarbans. The commonly identifiable vegetation types in the dense Sundarbans mangrove forests are salt water mixed forest, mangrove scrub, brackish water mixed forest, littoral forest, wet forest and wet alluvial grass forests. The Bangladesh mangrove vegetation of the Sundarbans differs greatly from other non-deltaic coastal mangrove forests and upland forests associations. Unlike the former, the Rhizophoraceae are of minor importance. Ecological succession Ecological succession is generally defined as the successive occupation of a site by different plant communities. In an accreting mudflats the outer community along the sequence represents the pioneer community which is gradually replaced by the next community representing the seral stages and finally by a climax community typical of the climatic zone. Robert Scott Troup suggested that succession began in the newly accreted land created by fresh deposits of eroded soil. The pioneer vegetation on these newly accreted sites is Sonneratia, followed by Avicennia and Nypa. As the ground is elevated as a result of soil deposition, other trees make their appearance. The most prevalent, though one of the late species to appear, is Excoecaria. As the level of land rises through accretion and the land is only occasionally flooded by tides, Heritiera fomes begins to appear. Flora A total 245 genera and 334 plant species were recorded by David Prain in 1903. While most of the mangroves in other parts of the world are characterised by members of the Rhizophoraceae, Avicenneaceae or Combretaceae, the mangroves of Bangladesh are dominated by the Malvaceae and Euphorbiaceae. The Sundarbans flora is characterised by the abundance of sundari (Heritiera fomes), gewa (Excoecaria agallocha), goran (Ceriops decandra) and keora (Sonneratia apetala) all of which occur prominently throughout the area. The characteristic tree of the forest is the sundari (Heritiera littoralis), from which the name of the forest had probably been derived. It yields a hard wood, used for building houses and making boats, furniture and other things. New forest accretions is often conspicuously dominated by keora (Sonneratia apetala) and tidal forests. It is an indicator species for newly accreted mudbanks and is an important species for wildlife, especially spotted deer (Axis axis). There is abundance of dhundul or passur (Xylocarpus granatum) and kankra (Bruguiera gymnorhiza) though distribution is discontinuous. Among palms, Poresia coaractata, Myriostachya wightiana and golpata (Nypa fruticans), and among grasses spear grass (Imperata cylindrica) and khagra (Phragmites karka) are well distributed. The varieties of the forests that exist in Sundarbans include mangrove scrub, littoral forest, saltwater mixed forest, brackish water mixed forest and swamp forest. Besides the forest, there are extensive areas of brackish water and freshwater marshes, intertidal mudflats, sandflats, sand dunes with typical dune vegetation, open grassland on sandy soils and raised areas supporting a variety of terrestrial shrubs and trees. Since Prain's report there have been considerable changes in the status of various mangrove species and taxonomic revision of the man-grove flora. However, very little exploration of the botanical nature of the Sundarbans has been made to keep up with these changes. Differences in vegetation have been explained in terms of freshwater and low salinity influences in the Northeast and variations in drainage and siltation. The Sundarbans has been classified as a moist tropical forest demonstrating a whole mosaic of seres, comprising primary colonisation on new accretions to more mature beach forests. Historically vegetation types have been recognised in broad correlation with varying degrees of water salinity, freshwater flushing and physiography. Fauna The Sundarbans provides a unique ecosystem and a rich wildlife habitat. According to the 2015 tiger census in Bangladesh, and the 2011 tiger census in India, the Sundarbans have about 180 tigers (106 in Bangladesh and 74 in India). Earlier estimates, based on counting unique pugmarks, were much higher. The more recent counts have used camera traps, an improved methodology that yields more accurate results. Tiger attacks are frequent in the Sundarbans, with up to 50 people being killed each year. Most importantly, mangroves are a transition from the marine to freshwater and terrestrial systems, and provide critical habitat for numerous species of small fish, crabs, shrimps and other crustaceans that adapt to feed and shelter, and reproduce among the tangled mass of roots, known as pneumatophores, which grow upward from the anaerobic mud to get the supply of oxygen. A 1991 study has revealed that the Indian part of the Sundarbans supports diverse biological resources including at least 150 species of commercially important fish, 270 species of birds, 42 species of mammals, 35 reptiles and 8 amphibian species, although new ones are being discovered. This represents a significant proportion of the species present in Bangladesh (i.e. about 30% of the reptiles, 37% the birds and 34% of the mammals) and includes many species which are now extinct elsewhere in the country. Two amphibians, 14 reptiles, 25 aves and five mammals are endangered. The Sundarbans is an important wintering area for migrant water birds and is an area suitable for watching and studying avifauna.Habib, M.G. (1999). Message In: Nuruzzaman, M., I.U. Ahmed and H. Banik (eds.). The Sundarbans world heritage site: an introduction, Forest Department, Ministry of Environment and Forest, Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh. The management of wildlife is restricted to, firstly, the protection of fauna from poaching, and, secondly, designation of some areas as wildlife sanctuaries where no extraction of forest produce is allowed and where the wildlife face few disturbances. Although the fauna of Bangladesh have diminished in recent times and the Sundarbans has not been spared from this decline, the mangrove forest retains several good wildlife habitats and their associated fauna. Of these, the tiger and dolphin are target species for planning wildlife management and tourism development. There are high profile and vulnerable mammals living in two contrasting environments, and their statuses and management are strong indicators of the general condition and management of wildlife. Some species are protected by legislation, notably by the Bangladesh Wildlife (Preservation) Order, 1973 (P.O. 23 of 1973).THE ORIGINAL BANGLADESH WILDLIFE PRESERVATION ORDER 1973 THE DRAFT. nishorgo.org Mammals The Sundarbans are an important habitat for the Bengal tiger (Panthera tigris tigris). The forest also provides habitat for small wild cats such as the jungle cat (Felis chaus), fishing cat (Prionailurus viverrinus), and leopard cat (P. bengalensis). Several predators dwell in the labyrinth of channels, branches and roots that poke up into the air. This is the only mangrove ecoregion that harbours the Indo-Pacific region's largest terrestrial predator, the Bengal tiger. Unlike in other habitats, tigers live here and swim among the mangrove islands, where they hunt scarce prey such as the chital deer (Axis axis), Indian muntjacs (Muntiacus muntjak), wild boar (Sus scrofa), and Rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta). It is estimated that there are now 180 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area. The tigers regularly attack and kill humans who venture into the forest, human deaths ranging from 30‚Äì100 per year. Avifauna The forest is also rich in bird life, with 286 species including the endemic brown-winged kingfishers (Pelargopsis amauroptera) and the globally threatened lesser adjutants (Leptoptilos javanicus) and masked finfoots (Heliopais personata) and birds of prey such as the ospreys (Pandion haliaetus), white-bellied sea eagles (Haliaeetus leucogaster) and grey-headed fish eagles (Ichthyophaga ichthyaetus). Some more popular birds found in this region are open billed storks, black-headed ibis, water hens, coots, pheasant- tailed jacanas, pariah kites, brahminy kites, marsh harriers, swamp partridges, red junglefowls, spotted doves, common mynahs, jungle crows, jungle babblers, cotton teals, herring gulls, Caspian terns, gray herons, brahminy ducks, spot-billed pelicans, great egrets, night herons, common snipes, wood sandpipers, green pigeons, rose-ringed parakeets, paradise flycatchers, cormorants, white-bellied sea eagles, seagulls, common kingfishers, peregrine falcons, woodpeckers, Eurasian whimbrels, black-tailed godwits, little stints, eastern knots, curlews, golden plovers, pintails, white-eyed pochards and lesser whistling ducks. Aquafauna The Sundarbans National Park is home to olive ridley turtle, hawksbill turtle, green turtle, sea snake, dog-faced water snake, estuarine crocodile, chameleon, king cobra, Russell's viper, house gecko, monitor lizard, pythons, common krait, green vine snake, checkered keelback and rat snake. The river terrapin, Indian flap- shelled turtle (Lissemys punctata), peacock soft-shelled turtle (Trionyx hurum), yellow monitor, Asian water monitor, and Indian python. Fish and amphibians found in the Sundarbans include sawfish, butter fish, electric ray, common carp, silver carp, barb, river eels, starfish, king crab, fiddler crab, hermit crab, prawn, shrimps, Gangetic dolphins, skipper frogs, common toads and tree frogs. One particularly interesting fish is the mudskipper, a gobioid that climbs out of the water into mudflats and even climbs trees. Endangered and extinct species Forest inventories reveal a decline in standing volume of the two main commercial mangrove species ‚Äì sundari (Heritiera spp.) and gewa (Excoecaria agallocha) ‚Äî by 40% and 45% respectively between 1959 and 1983. Despite a total ban on all killing or capture of wildlife other than fish and some invertebrates, it appears that there is a consistent pattern of depleted biodiversity or loss of species (notably at least six mammals and one important reptile) in the 20th century, and that the \\"ecological quality of the original mangrove forest is declining\\". The endangered species that live within the Sundarbans and extinct species that used to be include the royal Bengal tigers, estuarine crocodile, northern river terrapins (Batagur baska), olive ridley sea turtles, Gangetic dolphin, ground turtles, hawksbill sea turtles and king crabs (horse shoe). Some species such as hog deer (Axis porcinus), water buffalos (Bubalus bubalis), barasingha or swamp deer (Cervus duvauceli), Javan rhinoceros (Rhinoceros sondaicus), single horned rhinoceros (Rhinoceros unicornis) and the mugger crocodiles or marsh crocodiles (Crocodylus palustris) started to become extinct in the Sundarbans towards the middle of the 20th century, because of extensive poaching and man hunting by the British.Sarker, S.U. 1993. Ecology of Wildlife UNDP/FAO/BGD/85/011. Field Document N. 50 Institute of Forestry and Environmental Sciences. Chittagong, Bangladesh. There are other threatened mammal species, such as the capped langurs (Semnopithecus pileatus), smooth-coated otters (Lutrogale perspicillata), Oriental small-clawed otters (Aonyx cinerea), and great Bengal civets (Viverra zibetha). Climate change impact The physical development processes along the coast are influenced by a multitude of factors, comprising wave motions, micro and macro-tidal cycles and long shore currents typical to the coastal tract. The shore currents vary greatly along with the monsoon. These are also affected by cyclonic action. Erosion and accretion through these forces maintains varying levels, as yet not properly measured, of physiographic change whilst the mangrove vegetation itself provides a remarkable stability to the entire system. During each monsoon season almost all the Bengal Delta is submerged, much of it for half a year. The sediment of the lower delta plain is primarily advected inland by monsoonal coastal setup and cyclonic events. One of the greatest challenges people living on the Ganges Delta may face in coming years is the threat of rising sea levels caused mostly by subsidence in the region and partly by climate change. In many of the Bangladesh's mangrove wetlands, freshwater reaching the mangroves was considerably reduced from the 1970s because of diversion of freshwater in the upstream area by neighbouring India through the use of the Farakka Barrage bordering Rajshahi, Bangladesh. Also, the Bengal Basin is slowly tilting towards the east because of neo-tectonic movement, forcing greater freshwater input to the Bangladesh Sundarbans. As a result, the salinity of the Bangladesh Sundarbans is much lower than that of the Indian side. A 1990 study noted that there \\"is no evidence that environmental degradation in the Himalayas or a 'greenhouse' induced rise in sea level have aggravated floods in Bangladesh\\"; however, a 2007 report by UNESCO, \\"Case Studies on Climate Change and World Heritage\\" has stated that an anthropogenic rise in sea level (likely by the end of the 21st century, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), combined with other forms of anthropogenic stress on the Sundarbans, could lead to the destruction of 75 percent of the Sundarbans mangroves.Case Studies of Climate Change, UNESCO, 2007 Already, Lohachara Island and New Moore Island/South Talpatti Island have disappeared under the sea, and Ghoramara Island is half submerged. In a study conducted in 2012, the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) found out that the Sunderban coast was retreating up to in a year. Agricultural activities had destroyed around of mangroves within three decades (1975‚Äì2010). Shrimp cultivation had destroyed another . Researches from the School of Oceanographic Studies, Jadavpur University, estimated the annual rise in sea level to be in 2010. It had doubled from recorded in 2000. The rising sea levels had also submerged around of forest areas. This, coupled with an around rise in surface water temperatures and increased levels of salinity have posed a problem for the survival of the indigenous flora and fauna. The Sundari trees are exceptionally sensitive to salinity and are being threatened with extinction. Loss of the mangrove forest will result in the loss of the protective biological shield against cyclones and tsunamis. This may put the surrounding coastal communities at high risk. Moreover, the submergence of land mass have rendered up to 6,000 families homeless and around 70,000 people are immediately threatened with the same. This is causing the flight of human capital to the mainland, about 13% in the decade of 2000‚Äì2010. A 2015 ethnographic study, conducted by a team of researchers from Heiderberg university in Germany, found a crisis brewing in the Sunderbans. The study contended that poor planning on the part of the India and Bangladesh governments coupled with natural ecological changes were forcing the flight of human capital from the region Hazards=Natural hazards According to a report created by UNESCO, the landfall of Cyclone Sidr damaged around 40% of Sundarbans in 2007. Man made hazards In August 2010, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed between Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) and India's state-owned National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) where they designated to implement the coal-fired Rampal power station by 2016.New Age  NewspaperFinal report on environmental impact assessment of 2x (500-660) MW coal-based thermal power plant to be constructed at the location of Khulna - India Environment Portal The proposed project, on an area of over 1,834 acres of land, is situated north of the Sundarbans. This project violates the environmental impact assessment guidelines for coal-based thermal power plants. Environmental activists contend that the proposed location of the Rampal Station would violate provisions of the Ramsar Convention. The government of Bangladesh rejected the allegations that the coal-based power plant would adversely affect the world's largest mangrove forest. On 9 December 2014 an oil-tanker named Southern Star VII, carrying of furnace oil, was sunk in the Sela river of Sundarbans after it had been hit by a cargo vessel. The oil spread over area after the clash, as of 17 December.\\"Assessing the oil spill's impact on Bangladesh's Sundarbans forest\\". Deutsche Welle. 17 December 2014. The slick spread to a second river and a network of canals in the Sundarbans and blackened the shoreline. The event was very threatening to trees, plankton, vast populations of small fishes and dolphins. The event occurred at a protected Sundarbans mangrove area, home to rare Irrawaddy and Ganges dolphins. Until 15 December 2014 only of oil from the area were cleaned up by local residents, Bangladesh Navy and the government of Bangladesh. Some reports indicated that the event killed some wildlife. On 13 December 2014, a dead Irrawaddy dolphin was seen floating on the Harintana-Tembulbunia channel of the Sela River. Economy The Sundarbans plays an important role in the economy of the southwestern region of Bangladesh as well as in the national economy. It is the single largest source of forest produce in the country. The forest provides raw materials for wood-based industries. In addition to traditional forest produce like timber, fuelwood, pulpwood etc., large-scale harvest of non-wood forest products such as thatching materials, honey, beeswax, fish, crustacean and mollusc resources of the forest takes place regularly. The vegetated tidal lands of the Sundarbans function as an essential habitat, produces nutrients and purifies water. The forest also traps nutrient and sediment, acts as a storm barrier, shore stabiliser and energy storage unit. Last but not the least, the Sunderbans provides an aesthetic attraction for local and foreign tourists. The forest has immense protective and productive functions. Constituting 51% of the total reserved forest estate of Bangladesh, it contributes about 41% of total forest revenue and accounts for about 45% of all timber and fuel wood output of the country. A number of industries (e.g., newsprint mill, match factory, hardboard, boat building, furniture making) are based on raw materials obtained from the Sundarbans ecosystem. Non-timber forest products and plantations help generate considerable employment and income opportunities for at least half a million poor coastal people. It provides natural protection to life and properties of the coastal population in cyclone-prone Bangladesh. Agriculture During monsoon the paddy fields in the Sunderbans are entirely flooded. Part of the Sundarbans is shielded from tidal inflow by leaves and there one finds villages and agriculture. During the monsoon season, the low lying agricultural lands are waterlogged and the summer crop (kharif crop) is therefore mainly deepwater rice or floating rice. In the dry winter season the land is normally uncropped and used for cattle grazing. However, the lands near the villages are irrigated from ponds that were filled up during monsoon, and vegetable crops (Rabi crops) can be grown here.H.S.Sen, 1992. Research on water management in the Sundarbans, West Bengal, India. Published in the Annual Report 1992 of the International Institute for Land Reclamation and improvement, Wageningen, the Netherlands. On line: Habitation The Sundarbans has a population of over 4 million but much of it is mostly free of permanent human habitation. Despite human habitations and a century of economic exploitation of the forest well into the late 1940s, the Sundarbans retained a forest closure of about 70% according to the Overseas Development Administration (ODA) of the United Kingdom in 1979. Administration Police Boat Patrolling in Sundarban National Park, West Bengal The Sundarbans area is one of the most densely populated areas in the world, and the population is increasing. As a result, half of this ecoregion's mangrove forests have been cut down to supply fuelwood and other natural resources. Despite the intense and large-scale exploitation, this still is one of the largest contiguous areas of mangroves in the world. Another threat comes from deforestation and water diversion from the rivers inland, which causes far more silt to be brought to the estuary, clogging up the waterways. The Directorate of Forest is responsible for the administration and management of Sundarban National Park in West Bengal. The Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (PCCF), Wildlife & Bio-Diversity & ex-officio Chief Wildlife Warden, West Bengal is the senior most executive officer looking over the administration of the park. The Chief Conservator of Forests (South) & Director, Sundarban Biosphere Reserve is the administrative head of the park at the local level and is assisted by a Deputy Field Director and an Assistant Field Director. The park area is divided into two ranges, overseen by range forest officers. Each range is further sub-divided into beats. The park also has floating watch stations and camps to protect the property from poachers. The park receives financial aid from the State Government as well as the Ministry of Environment and Forests under various Plan and Non-Plan Budgets. Additional funding is received under the Project Tiger from the Central Government. In 2001, a grant of US$20,000 was received as a preparatory assistance for promotion between India and Bangladesh from the World Heritage Fund. A new Khulna Forest Circle was created in Bangladesh back in 1993 to preserve the forest, and Chief Conservators of Forests have been posted since. The direct administrative head of the Division is the Divisional Forest Officer, based at Khulna, who has a number of professional, subprofessional and support staff and logistic supports for the implementation of necessary management and administrative activities. The basic unit of management is the compartment. There are 55 compartments in four Forest Ranges and these are clearly demarcated mainly by natural features such as rivers, canals and creeks. Protected areas A map of the protected areas of the Indian Sunderbans, showing the boundaries of the tiger reserve, the national park and the three wildlife sanctuaries, conservation and lodging centres, subsistence towns, and access points. The entire forested (dark green) area constitutes the Biosphere Reserve, with the remaining forests outside the national park and wildlife sanctuaries being given the status of a reserve forest. The Bangladesh part of the forest lies under two forest divisions, and four administrative ranges viz Chandpai (Khulna District), Sarankhola (Khulna), and Burigoalini (Satkhira District) and has sixteen forest stations. It is further divided into fifty-five compartments and nine blocks. There are three wildlife sanctuaries established in 1977 under the Bangladesh Wildlife (Preservation) Order, 1973 (P.O. 23 of 1973). The West Bengal part of the forest lies under the district of South & North 24 Parganas. Protected areas cover 15% of the Sundarbans mangroves including Sundarbans National Park and Sajnakhali Wildlife Sanctuary, in West Bengal, Sundarbans East, Sundarbans South and Sundarbans West Wildlife Sanctuaries in Bangladesh. In May 2019, the local authorities in Bangladesh killed 4 tiger poachers in a shootout in the Sunderbans mangrove area where currently 114 tigers dwell. Sundarban National Park The Sundarban National Park is a National Park, Tiger Reserve, and a Biosphere Reserve in West Bengal, India. It is part of the Sundarbans on the Ganges Delta, and adjacent to the Sundarbans Reserve Forest in Bangladesh. The delta is densely covered by mangrove forests, and is one of the largest reserves for the Bengal tiger. It is also home to a variety of bird, reptile and invertebrate species, including the salt-water crocodile. The present Sundarbans National Park was declared as the core area of Sundarbans Tiger Reserve in 1973 and a wildlife sanctuary in 1977. On 4 May 1984 it was declared a National Park. Sundarbans West Wildlife Sanctuary Sundarbans West Wildlife Sanctuary is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The region supports mangroves, including: sparse stands of Gewa (Excoecaria agallocha) and dense stands of Goran (Ceriops tagal), with discontinuous patches of Hantal palm (Phoenix paludosa) on drier ground, river banks and levees. The fauna of the sanctuary is very diverse with some 40 species of mammals, 260 species of birds and 35 species of reptiles. The greatest of these being the Bengal tiger of which an estimated 350 remain in the Bangladesh Sundarbans. Other large mammals are wild boar, chital horin (spotted deer), Indian otter and macaque monkey. Five species of marine turtles frequent the coastal zone and two endangered reptiles are present ‚Äì the estuarine crocodile and the Indian python.UNESCO World Heritage Nomination, 1997 Sundarbans East Wildlife Sanctuary Sundarbans East Wildlife Sanctuary extends over an area of . Sundari trees (Heritiera fomes) dominate the flora, interspersed with Gewa (Excoecaria agallocha) and Passur (Xylocarpus mekongensis) with Kankra (Bruguiera gymnorhiza) occurring in areas subject to more frequent flooding. There is an understory of Shingra (Cynometra ramiflora) where, soils are drier and Amur (Aglaia cucullata) in wetter areas and Goran (Ceriops decandra) in more saline places. Nypa palm (Nypa fruticans) is widespread along drainage lines. Sundarbans South Wildlife Sanctuary Sundarbans South Wildlife Sanctuary extends over an area of . There is evidently the greatest seasonal variation in salinity levels and possibly represents an area of relatively longer duration of moderate salinity where Gewa (Excoecaria agallocha) is the dominant woody species. It is often mixed with Sundri, which is able to displace in circumstances such as artificially opened canopies where Sundri does not regenerate as effectively. It is also frequently associated with a dense understory of Goran (Ceriops tagal) and sometimes Passur. Sajnakhali Wildlife Sanctuary Sajnakhali Wildlife Sanctuary is a area in the northern part of the Sundarbans delta in South 24 Parganas district, West Bengal, India. It is mainly mangrove scrub, forest and swamp. It was set up as a sanctuary in 1976. It is home to a rich population of different species of wildlife, such as water fowl, heron, pelican, spotted deer, rhesus macaques, wild boar, tigers, water monitor lizards, fishing cats, otters, olive ridley turtles, crocodiles, batagur terrapins, and migratory birds. In popular culture The Sundarbans is celebrated through numerous Bengali folk songs and dances, often centred around the folk heroes, gods and goddesses specific to the Sunderbans (like Bonbibi and Dakshin Rai) and to the Lower Gangetic Delta (like Manasa and Chand Sadagar). The Bengali folk epic Manasamangal mentions Netidhopani and has some passages set in the Sundarbans during the heroine Behula's quest to bring her husband Lakhindar back to life. The area provides the setting for several novels by Emilio Salgari, (e.g. The Mystery of the Black Jungle). Sundarbaney Arjan Sardar, a novel by Shibshankar Mitra, and Padma Nadir Majhi, a novel by Manik Bandopadhyay, are based on the rigors of lives of villagers and fishermen living in the Sunderbans region, and are woven into the Bengali psyche to a great extent. Part of the plot of Salman Rushdie's Booker Prize winning novel, Midnight's Children is set in the Sundarbans. This forest is adopted as the setting of Kunal Basu's short story \\"The Japanese Wife\\" and the subsequent film adaptation. Most of the plot of an internationally acclaimed novelist, Amitav Ghosh's 2004 novel, The Hungry Tide, is set in the Sundarbans. The plot centres on a headstrong American cetologist who arrives to study a rare species of river dolphin, enlisting a local fisherman and translator to aid her. The book also mentions two accounts of the Bonbibi story of \\"Dukhey's Redemption\\".Ghosh, Amitav (2005). The Hungry Tide: A Novel., Boston: Houghton Mifflin, pp. 84‚Äì88, 292‚Äì97 . Manik Bandopadhyay's Padma Nadir Majhi was made into a movie by Goutam Ghose. The Sunderbans has been the subject of a detailed and well-researched scholarly work on Bonbibi (a 'forest goddess' venerated by Hindus), on the relation between the islanders and tigers and on conservation and how it is perceived by the inhabitants of the Sundarbans,Jalais, Annu. (2010). Forest of Tigers: People, Politics and Environment in the Sundarbans, Routledge: New Delhi, London, New York, . as well as numerous non-fiction books, including The Man-Eating Tigers of Sundarbans by Sy Montegomery for a young audience, which was shortlisted for the Dorothy Canfield Fisher Children's Book Award. In Up The Country, Emily Eden discusses her travels through the Sunderbans. Numerous documentary movies have been made about the Sunderbans, including the 2003 IMAX production Shining Bright about the Bengal tiger. The acclaimed BBC TV series Ganges documents the lives of villagers, especially honey collectors, in the Sundarbans.

Biography Rad√≥ was born in Budapest and between 1913 and 1915 attended the Polytechnic Institute, studying civil engineering. In World War I, he became a First Lieutenant in the Hungarian Army and was captured on the Russian Front. He escaped from a Siberian prisoner camp and, traveling thousands of miles across Arctic wasteland, managed to return to Hungary. He received a doctorate from the Franz Joseph University in 1923. He taught briefly at the university and then became a research fellow in Germany for the Rockefeller Foundation. In 1929, he moved to the United States and lectured at Harvard University and the Rice Institute before obtaining a faculty position in the Department of Mathematics at Ohio State University in 1930. In 1935 he was granted American citizenship. In World War II he was science consultant to the United States government, interrupting his academic career. He became Chairman of the Department of Mathematics at Ohio State University in 1948. In the 1920s, he proved that surfaces have an essentially unique triangulation. In 1933, Rad√≥ published \\"On the Problem of Plateau\\" in which he gave a solution to Plateau's problem, and in 1935, \\"Subharmonic Functions\\". His work focused on computer science in the last decade of his life and in May 1962 he published one of his most famous results in the Bell System Technical Journal: the busy beaver function and its non-computability (\\"On Non-Computable Functions\\"). He died in New Smyrna Beach, Florida.
